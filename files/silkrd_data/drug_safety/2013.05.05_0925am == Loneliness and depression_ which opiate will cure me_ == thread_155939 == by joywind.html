				I think opiates will be a temporary cure. And as your tolerance increases and you get more lonely and depressed when you&#039;re sober you&#039;ll need to take more and start doing drastic things to get your fix.<br /><br />Antidepressants work for some. SSRIs like prozac (fluoxitine) etc. have a good evidence base behind them. I&#039;d have them as a baseline if you&#039;re not already one them. You could get some from your doctor.<br /><br />Trying to change your social situation or your view of your situation can work too. I know that&#039;s an easy thing to say but not so easy to do. Online CBT courses can help but you can also go to CBT sessions with a councilor.<br /><br />Self medicating isn&#039;t good. You can&#039;t see the bigger picture.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve tried those maybe you could use something to numb the pain when you have &#039;break through&#039; depression but I really think that it&#039;s a slippery slope if you already have mental illness.<br /><br />Hope you took something from that and don&#039;t just think I&#039;m lecturing you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not got much experience of opiates so I can&#039;t give you much advice on that. Perhaps just oral morphine sulphate. Rectal is better for getting a better high if you&#039;re up for that. Stay away from IV please.

				err, opiates really are a poor choice for depression.&nbsp; They don&#039;t actually cure it, they just relieve the pain and give you the opoid benefits, but then you come down and so on.&nbsp; Worse yet, eventually withdrawal from opiates will exacerbate the depression.&nbsp; The best choice for depression is to get help.&nbsp; If the cause of the depression is loneliness, it&#039;s time to get out and socialize. (health related plug here) A good diet and exercise really does make one feel better overall, plus you have a chance to meet people at the gym

				This ^<br /><br />In general in my experience existing depression + opiates = much worse depression.<br /><br />Even people who aren&#039;t depressed before opiates tend to end up depressed after using them.<br /><br />While it&#039;ll fix it for a few hours, just about anything is better for mood elevation without the risk of exacerbating your existing condition. <br /><br />

				Neither opiates, benzos, or alcohol will cure depression. It will give you a temporary relief and then make the depression much, much, much worse once they wear off.

				If you&#039;re truely dead set against seeing a medical professional, at the very least use an SSRI, not a fucking opiate. In the long run opiates deplete the ability feel pleasure. They&#039;re highly addictive and their effects ephemeral.

				I don&#039;t think there is a cure for loneliness that can be found in drugs. If you&#039;re dead set on trying an illicit substance for depression I would suggest you look into low doses (below psychoactive threshold) of Ketamine. Several small studies have indicated that low doses of Ketamine can have a significant impact on depression for up to 5-7 days after dosing. It&#039;s to early to say for certain but the results look promising and more studies are being done into NDMA antagonists in relation to depression.<br /><br />I should warn that Ketamine used in recreative quantities (grams per day) for long periods of time can cause bladder problems. However, the studies that found these results investigated users who consumed large quantities of Ketamine daily. As an occasional recreational user of Ketamine myself I can only speak from my own experience and currently I do not suffer such problems. I&#039;ve also personally experienced uplifted mood for several days after last use. <br /><br />If you venture into buying SSRI&#039;s from SR you should know that it can take up two to four weeks before you&#039;ll notice any effects. It&#039;s imperative that you continue to take the SSRI during this period.

				Don&#039;t go the opiate route it only works for so long then you feel worst, at least that was my experience. <br /><br />I have been trying my whole adult life to find a balance and I still can&#039;t. Damn near 40 years old and I&#039;m still just as fucked as when I was 16.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is don&#039;t go the self prescribed route because in the end you will regret it if you&#039;re any thing like me.

				coke whores may help the loneliness and depression but they&#039;ll disappear once the coke runs out.&nbsp; Or so I would guess.&nbsp; I&#039;m more of an MDMA kinda guy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been kind of reckless with all of the drugs I&#039;ve tried over the past few years but I thank the Lord that I&#039;ve had the strength never to order any opiates.<br /><br />Ketamine can help certain types of depression but it can also be addictive.<br /><br />Having a fit body and talking to people might help the loneliness thing.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t know enough about your specific issues.&nbsp; Oh and I&#039;m probably not qualified either but hey this is the Internet so I can be a damn physician here if I want.<br />

				Obviously as a poster and long time buyer on here I&#039;m pro drugs, but I&#039;ve got to say drugs are not the answer to your problem. You have it in you to do this yourself, or even get help from a professional. Drugs shouldn&#039;t be used as crutches to get you through life, just use them as a bit of fun every now and again.

				IF YOU HAVE MONEY then heroin . BUT IT WILL ONLY MASK YOUR PAIN. You will be in an opiate bubble I started out like you and my first drug was heroin. . i don&#039;t know how I&#039;m not addicted even though I am IV&#039;ing it but people like you who have serious psychological problems are more likely to get addicted to substances like these.

				traditional opiates would only act as a veil, hiding your loneliness and depression. they would do much more harm than good. since you&#039;re interested in opiates, i would highly suggest getting some kratom. it&#039;s a plant in the coffee family that happens to be an opioid agonist. i find it to be a much more effective antidepressant and analgesic than traditional opiates. healthier too, as it&#039;s an immunostimulant with 20 times the antioxidants as green tea. :)

				I have known a lot of people with depression who took shrooms for it. As funny as it sounds there is some scientific backing for it.<br /><br />Shrooms effect the 5HT receptors of the brain where serotonin bonds. Depression tens to be a low serotonin level for which the prescription is an SSRI or MAOI. Both of which slow down the depletion of serotonin. Shrooms give an artificial boost to the serotonin level.<br /><br />When people I know have used it they start with a good Saturday trip on 2.5g to 3g. Then start taking .5g to 1g every morning. The standard Ps. Cubensis Shroom is used and every one of them has felt better the next day and remained good as long as they kept taking the small dose.<br /><br />The only side effect was that it was harder to trip on 3g after the first month and they had to take more if they wanted the tripping effect.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				hello op. i feel for you cause i too am a manic depressent who haz suffered depression since about the same age as you. i am almost 40 and i never touched a drug of any kind till i was 32 and the day i did it was an opiate. a loratab. it took all my&nbsp; misery and sadness away. i wasike where have you been all my life .but the happiness it brought me soon made my life even worse..i.e withdraws .etc .and pawning my warez and spending all ky koney to get opiates..all opiates.&nbsp; they do turn on you .if you can not control yohr intake and when you are like u and me&nbsp; you wake every day hating life..hating your self and are just miserable...a few happy times .in between but they turn to tears just as fast as they turned to laughs...i havefound that mdma&nbsp; every few weeks..pentadrone..mephadrone .and xanax to sleep have been chemicsls i can control&nbsp; but also keep my depression and misery at bay. i only use a xanax every blue moon to allow me to sleep they dont offer me a high of any kind . if you dont have an addiction gene and can control your opiate intake..meaning just takes opiates three times&nbsp; week..then go for it .but if u dose every day you will soon become a slave to it. its like anything else you must respect it. if you abuse it .it will abuse you.

				Iv sufferd from depression and anxiety for many years.. Opiates +depression = temp Fix then your depressed again..<br /><br />Im addicted to opiates, and now im 3x as depressed whn i run out of H, or my opiate pills i take..<br /><br /><br />I do not suggest u look to opiate for a cure for nothing but a HIGH and true pain releif and then addiction if not careful <br /><br />SSRI dont work for me.. Only thing that works is <br />1.Xanax bars or iv just started the 3mg xr time release triangles so i take 1 in the am and seem to be fine all day... But i like to snort my xanax bars ..It works faster, iv done it since 17. 10 years later still doing it..<br /><br />Klonopin are also good- I sniff those at times not much a difference<br /><br />Valium - are the only benzo&#039;s I take by mouth and work much better that way&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All these r mainly for anxiety but it helps my depression allot. Buspar or wellbutrin also Celexa iv heard great things, Buspar helped me, but dont think its a ant depressant..<br /><br />Also The benzo;s above, NON are water soulbe ,the reason i get the effects from sniffin is cause it doesnt clog my nose it goes st8t to my throat then the drip..but for me it hits allot faster not everyone though.. I have swallowed xanax and it just doesnt work as well as snorting themm..<br /><br />There is a doc on these forums find him speak to him... U dont need to be looking for a solver on SR, U need to see a psychiatrist ... Dont feel embarrassed about it. just do what u need to do to get mentally healthy. Iv found that chaging my eating habits and joggin have made a huge diffrence as well.. I stopped eating junk. And just started with yogurs,fruits etc.. <br /><br />I jog and i make one of those smoothie drinks and have it in the fridge for when i get back.. JUICERS are great too..

Tolerance soon develops and becomes unfordable/manageable. You will be left with worse depression. The best thing to do is to look into CBT and Mindfulness. Both require hard work but they both changed my life. I was unable to function for years and tried every drug, over 10 SSRIs (and simular) but they all made it worse. CBT and Mindfulness gave me back my life but it was hard work.<br /><br />And stop using recreational drugs I am afraid bar the odd beer if you can manage it. All the best I hope you find your way.

				Speaking from personal experience, and my experience working with people who suffer from addiction, please don&#039;t turn to drugs as a fix for mental issues.<br /><br />At first you will find relief, and then very quickly you will be in a hole 10x deeper than before you started, which addiction problems compounding your depression. I don&#039;t believe psychoactive drugs should ever be recommended as a treatment for people who&#039;s problems are psychological in nature.<br /><br />Do some research into CBT, it&#039;s a psychological tool for treating depression that has been proved to be far more effective than any medication on the market, I have seen it work wonders for myself as well as several people close to me. Go and see a specialist who specializes in treating people who suffer from depression, I guarantee they will be able to make you feel far better in the long run than any opiate ever will.<br /><br />Good luck man, depression is a bitch to deal with, don&#039;t give up :)

				depression is a bitch...i&#039;ve been dealing with it on and off since childhood.<br /><br />long walks in the woods seem to help me.<br /><br />on the drug tip, 10mg of MXE under the tongue 3-4 times a day for a few days will stave off the blues for a little while, but you&#039;ll need another session like that in time.<br /><br />although, i think comedy is the best cure.&nbsp; watch funny shows/movies, hang out with your funniest friends, write jokes.&nbsp; <br /><br />and try to lay off the alcohol/opiates/etc.

				Here are some things that have worked for me:<br /><br />1. Realize that you are not your mind.&nbsp; Stop giving it so much power.<br />2. Quit smoking cigarettes if you do, cold turkey.&nbsp; A smoking life is a miserable one.<br />3. Seek out genuine, healthy relationships with friends and family.&nbsp; Talk to strangers.&nbsp; Try to make some connections so you don&#039;t feel so alone.&nbsp; Stop waiting for these relationships to just happen.&nbsp; You have to take some initiative.<br />4. Stop looking to drugs as the cure for everything.&nbsp; Usually, they are only a temporary distraction from a problem that will be permanent if not dealt with head-on.<br />5. Study Buddhism.&nbsp; It has truly allowed me to be happier, less anxious, less depressed, more calm, and has been the impetus for me to begin my journey to enlightenment.<br />6. Laugh a lot more.<br />7. Find something that brings you pleasure (besides drugs).&nbsp; Perhaps it is a good book, or painting, or spending time outdoors.&nbsp; Get out of your head and immerse yourself in something you love.<br />8. Don&#039;t be so hard on yourself.&nbsp; Love yourself and those around you, and you will be surprised how people pick up on your new aura.&nbsp; It truly does attract better things and people.<br />9. Exercise and eat well.&nbsp; I cannot stress enough how important this is.<br /><br />Best of luck to you.&nbsp; It is not an easy journey, but it is ineffably worth it.

				mate all opioid`s, especially h, will comfort you where nothing bad will worry you while your high. so much so that you even care less about the good things in life.&nbsp; when you get a full blown habit, and you will, that comfort only last minutes because you will start worrying about your next hit before withdrawals make your life a living hell. if some cat or chick is bringing down cut them from your life. if you are just depressed go for a antidepressant. there are a&nbsp; few types and one will suit you. lastly and this works, train. get fit. force yourself to go for a run everyday for 6 weeks and i promise you it will become the best part of your day. it release endorphins, gets you fit and costs nothing.<br /><br />if you explained whats getting down you&#039;ll get better advice.

				People who already feel lonely and have depression are naturally attracted to opiates because they are drugs which are lonely and cause depression.<br /><br />If you would like to use pharmaceuticals (drugs) to help you with your loneliness and depression, what you must do is choose a drug that is the opposite of what you are. Not a drug that will cause relief (a subtraction), but one which will temporarily show you a meaningful sense of joy (an addition). MDMA or mushrooms taken in the right settings can change your life. I&#039;ve seen it before.

				i didnt read the comments so sorry if i resay anything.<br />but i was born with depression and eventually got diagnosed with depression that was acquired as well.<br />before i got on anti depressants i started taking pain pills (perc 5&#039;s) and kept moving up till all i did were <br />roxy 30s and oxy80s depending on how much money i had. but when i was sober... it was a level of depression that<br />kills people.. i didnt want to be around anyone ever. anyway skip a year or 2 and i started taking prozac and it didnt<br />work for about 3 weeks but after that it started working more and more for the following 2 months and then after about<br />6 months total of taking them (more than my script because i bought some here of a high dose for cheaper than i paid<br />with insurance) i quit taking them. (about 3 weeks ago) and im started to go back into depressions but i can fight out of them<br />and its no where near as bad as it was. <br />hope that helps!

				All the opiates work for depression but only for short term relief. However when you are not on them Depression, loneliness and the need to redose will be severe. You will just add another problem to your plate.<br />Exercise, yoga, martial arts, meditation, try a 10 day silent retreat no time for depression. <br />The majority of people who fill other peoples seemingly busy social world are just shooting off empty space filling speech. <br />The constant needs of people with heaps of friends is a more severe condition than being alone and uses up resources.<br />Except and celebrate who you are, keep learning and sometimes give spontaneously.<br />You will be suprised who you will meet when you stop trying and just be <br />Good luck
