				Hey.<br /><br />Although I&#039;ve never been the type to experience an awful comedown from MDMA (or pills), I typically get an empty useless feeling for the hours after its effects wear off. <br /><br />I&#039;ve looked into something that replenishes serotonin after the depletion of a roll and have found 5-htp. Does taking 5-htp stop the feelings of emptiness, or is it just for general &#039;health&#039; purposes?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been researching 2cb and some say it really helps evade the mdma comedown - typically I take around 400mg in an evening.. spaced over several hours. When would be the best time to take 2cb? How much of it? And what can I expect from it? (what does it do in general? is it dangerous etc).<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; ;D<br />

				Hey buttonboy1234,<br /><br />&quot;empty useless feeling&quot; sounds pretty awful to me!<br /><br />5-HTP is good as a serotonin precursor and taken post MDMA will def have a positive on effect on your neurological health as well as your mood.<br /><br />Doing MDMA on its own and suffering through the transition from the MDMA space to back to baseline is something no-one should have to endure.<br /><br />Two of the best things for doing this transition more gracefully are 2C-B and GHB. Either can be used and the best time to take is close to baseline of the MDMA, i.e. shortly before it&#039;s over, when then experience is starting to fragment properly and you know it&#039;s going to be ending in the next 20-30 minutes or so.<br /><br />You can also go from MDMA to 2C-B and then on to GHB which is spectacular. In all cases, both the 2C-B and GHB will reinvigorate the MDMA experience and you will have some more hours of roll - and when you transition out of that it will be much smoother.<br /><br />Further guidelines here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90975.0<br /><br />BG

If I take a few doses of mdma throughout an evening (like I normally do - 400-500mg spaced throughout several hours) is it best to take the aforementioned drugs during the last dose&#039;s journey to the baseline?<br /><br />Thanks Again.&nbsp; ;)

				2C-B and MDMA is an amazing combination. I just did this a couple of days ago (for the second time). The ideal is something like 120mg of MDMA and then 15mg of 2C-B at about t+90. I notice no comedown from MDMA this way and it always makes for one of the best nights of my life. <br /><br />The one time that I did this combination when I was redosing MDMA I had not the best time on the 2C-B but it could have been more set/setting. However, I would recommend trying only one dose of MDMA and then one dose of the 2C-B, it might surprise you, and you may feel like you don&#039;t need to redose the MDMA.<br /><br />The next day, I take 5-htp because otherwise I get post-roll depression for the next couple of days. The day after usually isn&#039;t too bad but I&#039;m a couple days out and it was pretty damn bad today, although the 5-htp helps a lot. Let me know if there&#039;s anything else that I can do for you.

				I&#039;m not against re-dosing MDMA per say, but all I am saying is the one time that I tried this combo after redosing was a little difficult. That could just be because I seem to get worse MDMA comedowns than most people or set/setting, all I&#039;m saying is it might be worth a try.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re asking about when you say &quot;baselining with 2C-B&quot;. General oral doses of 2C-B are around 15-25mg orally. You should always start lower if you are trying a new combo though. Shulgin says to treat each combination of drugs as if it were a new drug entirely (start low).<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you would be probably fine taking it even when you&#039;re redosing. When I did that, I took the 2C-B around 90 minutes after my last dose of MDMA. It truly is a magical combination.

				The comedown is actually largely circumvented by the addition of the 2C-B.&nbsp; It significantly lessens the hangover from the MDMA for me, and several of my friends claim it actually completely negates the hangover so they wake up the next morning as if they didn&#039;t just party their face off for 10+ hours.<br /><br />I dunno about waiting 90 minutes after your last dose of MDMA, but everyone&#039;s different.&nbsp; I personally like to wait until I feel the peak of my last dose is half over, then consume some 2C-B orally.&nbsp; Maybe 10mg or so since it tends to multiply effects rather than add them.&nbsp; Alternatively, you could wait till you&#039;re starting to come off the peak of the last dose and snort ~2mg.&nbsp; Give it 5 minutes and snort another ~2mg if needed.&nbsp; On any psychedelic, the effects combined are generally stronger than just x + y.&nbsp; Keep in mind, you can always take more, but you can&#039;t take less once you&#039;ve consumed the drugs.&nbsp; Many people experience a heavy &#039;body load&#039; while intoxicated with 2C-B and that combined with the prominent visuals can be overwhelming if unexpected.&nbsp; It&#039;s always nice to have a xanax or two around in case you&#039;re tripping to hard or can&#039;t go to sleep.<br /><br />Best of luck! :D

If you want to mainly extend the MDMA plateau, no more than 10mg oral I would say. 2C-B is a very interesting and beautiful psychedelic drug, and that will definitely manifest when you take it depending on the dosage. 2C-B has very prominent visuals, a pretty lucid headspace, and a great body high for the most part. The other day I did 110mg MDMA followed by 15mg 2C-B with a 5mg 2C-B booster later and then ended the night with nitrous and it was amazing. All 3 drugs were beautiful in their own right and all had the opportunity to shine and show what they had to offer.

				L-Tryptophan &gt; HTP-5 <br /><br />HTP-5 didn&#039;t help me for shit, in fact, it actually made me feel terrible a few times.

I take it along with a few others on a daily basis and I never get come downs or shitty feelings post rolling. I was even able to roll 3 days in a row at a festival a few weeks ago, all the same dosages each night, and rolled just as hard each night. <br /><br />HTP-5 is trash, everyone I know whose taken it has shown no positive benefits.

One thing to note with any of these serotonergic drugs like 5-htp or l-tryptophan is to be careful with them. They should be treated with equal respect and caution to drugs like SSRIs, that means don&#039;t suddenly discontinue usage. I did that with l-tryptophan and did not have a good night until I took half my normal dose and was finally able to get to sleep.
