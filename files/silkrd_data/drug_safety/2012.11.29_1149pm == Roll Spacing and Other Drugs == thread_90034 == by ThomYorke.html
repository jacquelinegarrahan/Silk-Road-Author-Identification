				Hi guys. I&#039;ve got into MDMA over the last year and now I want to try out some of the other delights that SR offers. I have read a lot about harm reduction and the consensus seems to be leaving at least a month between rolls. I&#039;ve been following this, but I haven&#039;t been able to find how to space MDMA with other drugs to avoid fucking myself up or &quot;losing the magic&quot;. <br />The drugs I&#039;m looking at getting are LSD, shrooms, 2CB and maybe some other RCs like NBOMes. Any scientific or anecdotal opinions are really appreciated. Thanks!

				Sorry to toss another question in the thread, but when taking MDA does it require you to take a few weeks away from it like MDMA? <br /><br />

				Thanks for the advice. I&#039;ve looked into it some more and it appears that 2CB is the only one with significant cross tolerance with MDMA, being a phenethylamine.<br /><br />As for MDA, I believe it has a very similar mechanism of action as MDMA, but with slightly higher efficacy in stimulating the 5-HT2A receptor, which gives it the more trippy feel. I guess that means you should take as much time off after using it as you would with MDMA (sorry!).
