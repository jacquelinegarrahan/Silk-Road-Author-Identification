				Hehe, you won&#039;t get too many lectures from people about drugs on here since we all do em :-&gt;<br /><br />You&#039;ll probably want to lurk the forums for a while to pick up how to do everything. In a nutshell deposit the coins, check the vendors feedback pages, look for one that doesn&#039;t require you to FE and then type in the vendors name into the forum search to make sure people aren&#039;t screaming mad at him before you add to cart and buy.<br /><br />The nice thing about buying from here is you will likely get what you are paying for. Buying acid from a kid at school means you are more likely to get an RC chemical than LSD. Plenty of fun RC chemicals out there, but as a rule it&#039;s best to actually know what substance you are putting in your body since some of these RC&#039;s have dosage curves that can seriously fuck you up with nothing more than a few extra flecks of the substance.<br /><br />Anyway, if it&#039;s your first trip on LSD or 4-HO-MIPT make sure you read a LOT of reports on it so you know the do&#039;s and don&#039;t to make sure you have a good, safe, fun time. Lot&#039;s of info here. Erowid.org and Bluelight.ru are also extremely helpful. Since both of those are hallucinogens, the best bet is to make sure you do it with someone who has done it before. A sitter if you will. So you don&#039;t get caught up in a bad place. Acid especially has the ability to detach you from reality in such a way that you can get a little lost and honestly terrified if there&#039;s not the comfort of knowing that everything is going to be just fine in a few hours.<br /><br />On your specific question of bitcoins, when you look up the info you&#039;ll find you just need to go somewhere that takes moneygram payments, CVS might want ID but the check cashing places usually don&#039;t care, same with convenience stores and the like. <br /><br />Good luck and be safe!

				Hi there Diamondsky and you are not going to get any help from me on getting coins and such as I honestly think you are way too young to mess with psychedelics. You have plenty of time and tripping experiences can be difficult to deal with when you are still (sorry again but facts are facts) immature.<br /><br />It will not kill you or make you addicted or crazy as you probably well know, but the experience can easily be so powerful that it will send your life in a completely new direction. I was in a group of friends that started doing acid at your age though most were a year or two older. We were really into, tripping frequently and spending much of our time discussing what the experiences all meant etc. Most of us dropped out of school. Getting an education, career etc just didn&#039;t seem that important anymore. Having been a bit older I think would have helped to put the experiences into perspective.<br />A couple ended up joining some religious outfits, others just ended on the street, a few made their way through&nbsp; and got an education. Today I wish I had waited. I would love to have gotten a science or chemistry degree.<br /><br />That said, be warned that a lot of the stuff being sold on the street as LSD is not actually LSD but some RC(some of which can be quite nasty surprise) and if it is LSD the actual dosage is often quite different from what is claimed. I have no idea if your local dealer is trustworthy but if you are going ahead,&nbsp; you are better off knowing exactly what you take and how strong it is. SR has some vendors where you can be sure you will get exactly what you order.

				This is one factor which has seen the demise of the forum. When your an adult and are legally responsible for your own actions, do what you want. 16 year olds just shouldn&#039;t be here at all. For fucks sake, wait til your a little older.

Furthermore I know many teenagers that have lived a hell of a lot more than people 2 or ever 3 times their age. But this is not why I disagree with you here. Your stance on not wanting to help anyone simply because of their age is actually endangering the very person you are trying to protect. You are in effect pushing them towards buying drugs from a schoolkid of dubious quality when they could be buying them from a reputable source here... Now imagine that the kid gets sold some weird RC at school and fucks up.. Its about harm reduction with younger people these days, you are not his parents so you donÂ´t need to take the I wont help you stance.. And if you do then dint write a massive post about how you are not going to help.. Simply donÂ´t comment.. <br />Kid, If you are convinced on doing the drug anyway, buying from a reputable vendor here is much less risky than buying from a kid at school. Our drugs for the most part are properly sourced and dosage is accurate. also no animals are harmed when producing them and they are fair trade,.. erhem... Also I sell Acid :D erhem check my vendor page.... speacial offer for under 18Â´s 10% off ... lol I jest.. <br />ACE

				While there are some teenagers using this site, I hardly think we give advice to 16 year olds all the time. That is pure speculation Moon Fried and since this site works on the premise of Anonymity, neither you or I can accurately deduce who&#039;s correct or incorrect with regards to your assumption.

				Part of being a teenager is doing drugs.&nbsp; I used a LOT of acid between the ages of 15-18.&nbsp; I don&#039;t regret any trip I had taken.&nbsp; I feel that my experiences with LSD have grown my mind and awareness of the world as a whole in ways that nothing else could have. Any of you guys who are saying that 16 is too young to do acid missed out big time.<br /><br />So how to get bitcoins? Now that bitinstant cash deposit through bank of america is gone. I use BTC vendors on the road.&nbsp; Go to the &quot;Money&quot; section and find a trusted btc vendor who charges minimal fees.&nbsp; Moneypak to BTC is the best and easiest way to go.<br /><br />Happy Trippin&nbsp; ;D

				I did a speach about safely using halloucinagens in college one time. Its like giving kids condoms. Noone wants kids to have sex, but if they are going to do it lets give them protection.&nbsp; When using halloucinagens there are three things that are important dose, set and setting. <br /><br />Dose- What you take and how much you take. Silk road is good for this because you will find much cleaner stuff here than you will on the street and it acctually is what it is claimed to be. That being said, do not underestimate the power of one hit you get here. LSD is measured in micrograms (millionths of a gram). Most of the stuff you will find on the street will only be about 25-50 micrograms. On silkroad it is anywhere between 100 micrograms and 300 micrograms so one hit from silk road could be 10 hits you find at school. <br /><br />Set- Set is the mindset you have going into the trip. Think positive, be confident, have a good time, be in a good mood etc. Dont do it that day if you have had a fight with your parents or girlfriend or have any other kind of bad vibes going. <br /><br />Setting- Setting is where, when, with who etc. Where you are when you trip is extremely important. If you are an introverted person you should be with one or two&nbsp; best friends. If you are an extroverted person you can be around more people but they should all be people you know well. Dont do LSD with people you don&#039;t know very well you ll start tripping on trust issues. Do it in a comfortable, clean, not cluttered familiar place. Don&#039;t do it in any place where conflict could arise. <br /><br /><br />Finnally please please keep silkroad your little secret. If you talk about silk road news will spread like wild fire. Some kid will eat mushrooms and jump off of a&nbsp; building and it will make the news and america will be emotional and angry and people will demand that politicians do something and silk road will come under alot of heat. Look at the school shooting in conneticet. If some guy walked into a bar and shot 20 drunk ass men they wouldn&#039;t be talking about banning guns by january. When its kids people care. Silk road is a medium that we all use to get our party supplies and make a living please take good care of it. You have stumbled opoun great powers here, please use them responsibly.<br /><br />SDM <br /><br />P.S. I have lots of experience eating acid as a teenager, and all kinds of other drug related experience you can message me any time, if you would like advice.

				I agree with some of the others here, Im not encouraging a 16 yr old to dose. Yes we should inform him what hes getting into but it would be best for him to wait a couple of years or more. LSD is powerful. The first time I dosed I was 15 but I dont recommend it, hell I had a pretty good time but not everyone does and I do believe doing it that young, especially if the person is less than mature, is just&nbsp; a bad idea. It did have serious effects on my mental health taking it that young. Wait until you and your friends are old enough to really understand and enjoy it. You will be happy you did LSD should respected and used safely by adults. <br />All assuming youre not LE, wouldnt put it past them.

				I would just like to point out that the biggest danger this kid probably faces is getting caught somewhere along the line of getting bitcoins -&gt; placing orders -&gt; getting drugs delivered to his house. Then, as has already been mentioned, SR would probably gain the reputation of an innocence-raping factory, poisoning our darling children with health-degrading life-ruining chemicals like LSD, thereby harming the whole community, not to mention fucking this kid&#039;s life up worse than anything sold on this site could.<br /><br />The sensible thing to do, unfortunately, is probably to make sure things go smoothly for him, since at this point he&#039;s likely to try no matter what. Other members have already done that. I would like to contribute that 16 was the age at which I turned into a druggy, and frankly things just totally went downhill for me. Before drugs were ever an option to alleviate my boredom, I made lots of music, computer games, videos, drawings, etc. I know everyone is different but speaking for myself drugs turned me into a less interesting person... At this point it&#039;s hard to stop using them because now I know they&#039;re there, always tapping on my shoulder and whispering in my ear.

				I know how you feel nopuke. I dont think one dose would necessarily destroy someone&#039;s life, even at 16, but the chance is there for things to go wrong, and at that age why risk it? <br />Everyone is different and not everyone goes off the deep end. The risk of him/her getting caught is greater since he/she is probably living with family so I think it is best that we dont encourage him/her.

				Yeah I get the too young thing but I also get the most every freaking one of us did it at his age so might as well tell him how to do it safely and responsibly too. If someone told me at sixteen that smoking pot was bad I would have laughed at them in their face. Same if they told me I was too young to drink or have sex. Being emotionally mature is a dandy thing for sex, drugs and alcohol but I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s a requirement. <br /><br />Doctors force uppers, downers and SSRIs on 10 year olds but taking a tab to let you see pretty colors and explore your psyche are considered taboo at an age of consent in many parts of the world? I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s ideal, I think most everyone should only take drugs when their world is working well for them and on an established path towards a direction they want to go in, but if the do decide to venture into drugs I would much rather they do a tab of LSD than risk death with some unknown xNBOMe substance that wasn&#039;t properly identified or portioned. <br /><br />Anyway, guess I was wrong, some people on here will lecture you about drugs. If you do em, be safe, ask for help and know what you are doing. They can be great but they can also be the root of all evil. Understanding what they do and how you&#039;ll likely react is key to being safe with them.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

Your stance on not wanting to help anyone simply because of their age is actually endangering the very person you are trying to protect. You are in effect pushing them towards buying drugs from a schoolkid of dubious quality when they could be buying them from a reputable source here...

I come from a place where at 16, 15 and even 14 you could see kids taking hard drugs. What you seem to fail to understand is that they will do it anyway. Again harm reduction. I prefer to see to the kids safety than try and give off some image that this place is restricted to over 18 yr olds..&nbsp; &nbsp;No one said anything about explicitly seeking out children and selling drugs to them, That IMO is very wrong, However once a decision has been made by them I would feel a whole lot better knowing that they are safe, not wandering the streets buying dubious substances.. Sometimes by reacting based on personal ideals you can do more harm than good. You have to think of the consequences of your advice objectively. So you say no, you cant buy here. Kid goes out, hes sold tabs with bromo-dragonfly and has a deeply scarring experience... I would rather he just tripped on real LSD and was not in danger... I do understand your view point, but I don&#039;t agree with it. That being said. If it were a drug with overdose potential or a high risk of addiction I would strongly challenge the kid on his choice.&nbsp; But again, in that situation, simply not helping resolves nothing apart from a squeaky clean conscience, until you read a newspaper article about a 16 year old kid that got stabbed trying to buy drugs in a shady part of town... <br /><br />ACE

You have plenty of time and tripping experiences can be difficult to deal with when you are still (sorry again but facts are facts) immature.<br /><br />It will not kill you or make you addicted or crazy as you probably well know, but the experience can easily be so powerful that it will send your life in a completely new direction. I was in a group of friends that started doing acid at your age though most were a year or two older. We were really into, tripping frequently and spending much of our time discussing what the experiences all meant etc. Most of us dropped out of school. Getting an education, career etc just didn&#039;t seem that important anymore. Having been a bit older I think would have helped to put the experiences into perspective.<br />A couple ended up joining some religious outfits, others just ended on the street, a few made their way through&nbsp; and got an education. Today I wish I had waited.

Don&#039;t want to come across as arrogant, but in most factory, menial labour jobs, it feels like one never left primary school, or at least, I did, but the majority of the workforce never did. Not a pleasant future, believe me!!! It feels like an great alternative at the time (when one is 17 or so)- drop-out, adventures etc. But one soon becomes jaded and debauchery leads to greater debauchery, until nothing feels hard-core enough! If I could go back in time, I would have got my life prospects sorted at an age when one should- your age, then there is plenty time for play after!! ++++ NO REGRETS!!!!!!<br />Don&#039;t want to sound preachy, but you are exactly where I was, and so wish I could go back to and take my life in a different direction!

				I know the OP said he doesnt care what people think of him doing LSD at 16 but this is wrong.<br /><br />There is no way in hell you have the experience and will power to take drugs as well as live a fruitful life at that age. I&#039;m glad this website did not exist when I was younger as if I had started on some of the harder drugs back then I would not of been able to deal with it on an intelligent level as I am now. <br /><br />Do what you want but i&#039;m telling you very very very few people can start on drugs under the age of 18 and make it out the other side with good prospects in life. If your still gonna do it, enjoy it because the rest of your life is gonna suck.

				Agreed anyone under the age of 21 should not acquire drugs for their own safety in brain development.<br /><br />Besides that, he is going to acquire them no matter how much people lecture him, so just advise him on how to use the drug safely.

				I see nothing wrong with a sixteen year old consuming DMT, LSD. Magic Mushrooms, or MDMA. In fact I&#039;d probably advise it, they&#039;ve done more than I could have ever imagined before I became experienced.

You have plenty of time and tripping experiences can be difficult to deal with when you are still (sorry again but facts are facts) immature.<br /><br />It will not kill you or make you addicted or crazy as you probably well know, but the experience can easily be so powerful that it will send your life in a completely new direction. I was in a group of friends that started doing acid at your age though most were a year or two older. We were really into, tripping frequently and spending much of our time discussing what the experiences all meant etc. Most of us dropped out of school. Getting an education, career etc just didn&#039;t seem that important anymore. Having been a bit older I think would have helped to put the experiences into perspective.<br />A couple ended up joining some religious outfits, others just ended on the street, a few made their way through&nbsp; and got an education. Today I wish I had waited. I would love to have gotten a science or chemistry degree.<br /><br />That said, be warned that a lot of the stuff being sold on the street as LSD is not actually LSD but some RC(some of which can be quite nasty surprise) and if it is LSD the actual dosage is often quite different from what is claimed. I have no idea if your local dealer is trustworthy but if you are going ahead,&nbsp; you are better off knowing exactly what you take and how strong it is. SR has some vendors where you can be sure you will get exactly what you order.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 Busta, I agree. I also began experimenting with psychedelics when I was a bit too young and didn&#039;t really get that much out of the trips, though I thought I was at the time. I would definitely suggest waiting until being at least 18 so that the mind has some more time to develop certain understandings of the world. With more background information, the trip is greatly enriched. <br /><br />At this point in my life, I&#039;ve experimented so extensively with psychedelics that if I were to trip, I&#039;d miss out on alot of what I could be learning because it just isn&#039;t new or necessary anymore. Also, it&#039;s just not the right time of my life to trip. But looking back I feel like if I had waited to experiment with psychedelics I might have just had one trip when I was 20, lets say, that would have propelled me to greater lengths in the field that I want to work in. Most of the greatest success stories about psychedelics are from adults that used a psychedelic after a whole lifetime of experience without drugs. So the psychedelics actually had a chance to pull all the information together in a revolutionary new way. I think it is better that you&#039;re interested in trying these drugs, but I&#039;m just giving advice I would give my young self if I had the opportunity. Knowing how I was back then though, I would have taken psychedelics anyway. No matter what, something will be learned in the process.

				OP: didn&#039;t yo momma tell you not to tell nobody how old you are on the internet?!<br /><br />I don&#039;t give a fuck what this kid does.<br />Don&#039;t die, op. Use your head, be smart, and figure out what the safest way to do something, and then do it. Whether you figure out that info in days or in years. You&#039;kk be ready to apply the knowledge, when you&#039;re ready. I for one, would like to see you make a smart decision and if that smart decision is buying drugs for you, make sure you know what you&#039;re buying, consuming, etc. etc.<br />Just be safe ok.<br />Be prepared for the changes it will cause, accept that it will take your money, and know that you will like these drugs.<br />Ask for help when you don&#039;t have it under control or are unsure of anything,<br />Best of luck to you kiddo!<br /><br />P.S. And remember-momma knows best. Don&#039;t put your age online, and eat your vegetables, and always know she loves you.<br /><br />eennndd&nbsp; ambien typing. hope it helped kid.
