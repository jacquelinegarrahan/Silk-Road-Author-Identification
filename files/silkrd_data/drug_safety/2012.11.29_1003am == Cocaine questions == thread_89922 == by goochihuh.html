				1. When you snort it is the goal to get it in your nose and let it get absorbed there or do you snort hard so it goes all the way up and you get the drip?<br />2. If cocaine is rocky and really hard to cut up (can never cut it up like you see fine particles on tv) is it a good idea to put it in the microwave for say 30 seconds?

				Normal kitchen plate warmed in the oven nice and hot will TEnd to take any residual moisture away.<br /><br />IT shouldnt be clumping at all. Dry it out so it is a fine powder when you cut it up (Credit Card/Razor all should be fine).

				By the sounds of your coke, you need to dry it out, a hot plate, lamp within an inch of your coke on a plate, or leaving it near a radiator over night are all good choices, I tend to go for a lamp or radiator over a hot plate, but that&#039;s just my personal preference, a warm plate works perfectly well. You need to ensure your coke is dry before you chop it up into a very fine power, take your time over this, your nostrils will thank-you for doing so, and it helps you to get more out of your coke! Before your snort, adopt a good nasal hygiene practice, cleanse your nose with a saline nasal spray, moist mucus membranes make for for better absorption. Cut a straw about 4 inches long, this is far more hygienic than a bank note in my opinion (where has the bank note been, how many hands has it traveled through, what might it be contaminated with, straws do not go through any of this, that&#039;s why I think they&#039;re better for snorting). Do not cut the straw too long because you want your cocaine to go all the way up in one good snort.&nbsp; Rack your lines on a smooth surface. something like mirror or marble surface is a good choice, not wood as coke can get stuck into the grooves, either using a card or razor blade, I think a razor blade makes for finer chopping. I&#039;d recommend two 50-75mg lines, it&#039;s a nice way to start without blowing your head off! Your now ready to snort your first line (save your second for 15 minutes later), put one end of your straw to your nostril and use a fingertip to hold the other, snort your line fairly hard (like when you have a cold). If you have good quality coke your nose will start to feel numb followed by the high shortly after. At this point snort your coke back repeatedly, the drip of the powder will proceed to the back of your throat, by doing this your helping the coke to pass quicker as well, keep snorting back, until you feel the drip at the back of your throat kicking in, repeat as necessary, and enjoy! :)

				Never had big quantities, so never had a problem with huge rocks. I still have some questions. I just dont understand it.<br />1) People say that chunky cocaine is better than powdery one. Why that? Because it comes straight from the anus of the guy smuggled it? Isn&#039;t that a myth?<br />2) One or two times I got coke that was pretty humid. So I had problems to snort it. If coke is humid, what does it mean? Good or bad quality? Does it mean that it has taken a lot of water from the air? Or does it mean that there are some solvents, some chemicals inside?<br />Is it unhealthy to snort wet cocaine?<br />3) Most of the times it is a bit humid. Not really wet, but not like crystals either. I can cut it up without problems and made it powdery. Is it useful to dry it?<br />4) I heard one should dry it as rocks and only cut it out afterwards. Why? <br />5) If I cut the coke out and let it lie there for some hours or days. What happens? Solvens go out, water goes in?<br /><br />
