				A little history, not counting pot, my wife 50+ and I 60ish have been week end recreational drug users for nearly thirty years, coke mdma methylone, shrumes with at least fifty MDMA rides behind us. ;D<br />&nbsp;last week end I added 150mg MDA two hours into to a four hour ride of 150 and 100mg&nbsp; of MDMA taken an hour apart, all was well, maybe a bit intense,&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; my wife and I were enjoying it, about four hours into it she got up to go to the bath room and had a seizure, :o in thirty years of rec. drug use nothing like this has ever happened to us before. Per person we have ingested&nbsp; up to 500mg of MDMA with out ill effects, other than the crash the next day.&nbsp; A normal evening we will each ingest about 350mg of MDMA&nbsp; ;)<br />She is a real trouper and has recovered quite well, scared the living shit out of me, so here is the question, once a person has a seizure are they more likely to have another? I&#039;m planing on backing off for several months and staying with lower doses. <br />Is there any one out there that is pre loading with an anti seizure med? Is there any one out there that has experience with any thing like this? <br />PS. we are both working professionals regarded as top in our field and have been married 30 Year+ and do not live in a trailer.

				Hope I am still hitting the shit at 60.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I am hoping it will be legal by then, we can buy super pure drugs. <br /><br />But yes your brain chemistry changes over time, we lose mental function due to degradation similar to other body parts . Perhaps try some Piracetam taken regularly, and think about a good diet, plenty of sleep and look after your nuro chemistry.<br /><br />Maybe it is time to start thinking about cutting back the doses a little? You brain at 60 can&#039;t cope with the same abuse it did thirty years ago.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

MDMA has been more spiritual to us than any other drug that we have ever encountered. For now I think we will back off for several months and limit the doses and perhaps pre-load with an anti seizure med . If there is a recurrence all will rec. drug use will end with the exception of a&nbsp; little weed.<br /><br />You will know, what you have to do...<br /><br />Tantric Hulk<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				She went down in the hallway I heard her fall, and then knocking on the wall, I called out and went looking for her, she was face down convulsing and bleeding form the mouth, she had bit her tong and lip, the only thing that came to mind is she had overheated I soaked a towel in cold water and wrapped her head and neck, she also had a large lump on the side of her face from falling, in several minuets she started to come around,felt like hours, said she was alright, but she was to fucked up to know any better, her eyes were swinging like spot lights, I spent the next hour looking for signs of a stroke and asking her to count backwards, we were both to wasted to do that, the next morning I repeated all the tests,&nbsp; if I had seen any imbalance in motor function left to right I would have called the paramedics. We have lived our lives pushing the edge in many aspects, we have been rewarded with an exceptional life and life style, what else can I say, the other night we found the edge of the envelope. Does any one know if once this happens is it more likely to happen again? Is there a likley hood of it happening when she is straight? If we pre load with an anti seizure med will it eliminate future episodes?

				Was it a seizure or did she maybe just faint?<br />Older age combined with lack of food skipped meal tiredness low blood sugar etc may cause a black out.<br />Might not be the same as epilepsy.<br /><br />Was there any involuntary spasms? I am no expert but just want to give you a few ideas.<br /><br />I have blacked out once before but it was as the drugs were wearing off. It happened in a few seconds and I noticed the warning signs and had time to sit down instead of fall.<br /><br />It has also happened once when I was drug free just from not eating enough and standing still feeling queasy for too long.

				Not to point out the obvious here but if you sampled all the 50 y/o females out there some portion of them are going to just occasionally go into a seizure so it&#039;s not always drug related even if drugs were being taken at the time. Honestly as a older psyconaut myself I think the best thing to do on future trips is keep a thermometer handy to monitor core body temp, check the pulse and blood pressure every now and then to make sure you don&#039;t accidentally trip into any danger zones. If the seizure was MDMA induced, I would think it was a body temperature thing and that might just be something you want to keep an eye on in the future. Clearly no one wants to lose someone they love as they chase after those bonding highs but get her checked out, keep a thermometer handy and make sure you have a good plan in place in case anything happens. It might be a little embarrassing but something as simple as having a close sober friend you can call or just have stay over on trip nights might not be a bad idea. Making medical decision when you are both tripping balls can be really hard. Hope she is doing great now and you two can safely continue your adventures together.
