				Christ, this is embaressing, after over 20 yrs of drug use, Ive got an order in the mail which i cant identify.<br />I was awaiting&nbsp; gram of Ket. and a gram of Speed, both from UK. I got a letter from UK, it&#039;s a normal satchel<br />of dry, beige/off white crystals.<br />Now, the speed was supposed to be the sulphate which i thought waould be powdery, and the Ket is uaually <br />white as snow, and shorter, almost table salt looking crystals.<br />ANy tips pleeease?<br />

				Easy you can <br />1. get a EZ testkit and see what the results say<br />2. melt test it, im 100% sure ket and amp melt at different points. Double boil it using oil (not water) and a digital thermometer. <br /><br />

And its creeping up n me man, getting stronger as i type.<br />So, thanx for the help guys, Im snrting K, from JOR, and its all-fuccking-right.<br />thanx again<br />HM
