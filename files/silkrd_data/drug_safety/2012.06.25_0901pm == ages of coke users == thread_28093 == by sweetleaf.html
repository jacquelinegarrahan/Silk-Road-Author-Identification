				long time member since the beginning of sr and now a new vendor but just joined the forum....so good to be here.....<br /><br />just curious if anyone feels they are too old for coke due to heart rate increase, elevated blood press and the like. i&#039;ve been a casual user for&nbsp; nearly 30 years and i love coke but i only use it a few times a year for special events/parties I attend.....i wonder if i should be concerned as i approach age 60. I&#039;m in excellent physical condition and can run a mile which elevates heart rate and bp so i figure i&#039;m good. but as a safeguard i pop a few aspirin before i party just to keep my blood thin and flowing. <br /><br />anyone else out there near my age still snortin?

				I don&#039;t mean to be a buzzkill, but I&#039;m going to repost what I said in the &quot;Something that&#039;s been bugging me..&quot; thread.<br /><br />The more you know..<br /><br />Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to other parts of the body, so you are going to have arteries all around your heart and throughout your body.<br /><br />In regards to your use of cocaine, you are putting yourself in danger, regardless of how much you are using. There is an established connection between cocaine use and myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Numerous mechanisms have been postulated to explain how cocaine contributes to these conditions. Among these, cocaine may lead to MI by causing coronary artery vasoconstriction and accelerated atherosclerosis, and by initiating thrombus formation. Cocaine has also been shown to block K+ channels, increase L-type Ca2+ channel current, and inhibit Na+ influx during depolarization, all possible causes for arrhythmia. Additionally, cocaine use has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure if you conitue to use cocaine.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some references for you:<br /><br />Cocaine activates platelets and increases the formation of circulating platelet containing micro-aggregates in humans<br />http://heart.bmj.com/content/83/6/688.abstract<br /><br />Role of Blood Doping in the Coronary Vasoconstrictor Response to Cocaine<br />http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/92/1/96.abstract<br /><br />Mechanisms responsible for the cardiotoxic effects of cocaine<br />http://www.fasebj.org/content/4/8/2469.full.pdf<br /><br />sdesu

As you grow older of course you should try to wean off it. I really doubt the aspirin will be of much help. If I were you I would consider switching to something softer like marijuana/dmt/lsd/etc, bu then again those are nothing like coke. Feel free to practice if you feel safe, but it`ll do you good to stay off it long term.
