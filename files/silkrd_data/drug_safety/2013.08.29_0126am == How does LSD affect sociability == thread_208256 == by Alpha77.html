				I&#039;m gonna try LSD for the first time, (Alex Grey 120ug), I was wondering how it will affect my social behavior around people? At 120ug will it provide stimulant like effects and make me more outgoing, social, carefree like MDMA? I&#039;ll be in a club environment. Only experiences with psychedelics were 20mg 2c-b (enjoyed it, but not that stimulating &amp; muscle tension + waves nausea were annoying) and 200mg MDA which gave me some nice CEV &amp; OEV. Should I take a smaller dose than 120ug?

				I would suggest doing LSD for the first time in a peaceful, positive environment with one or a group of your closest friends to trip sit for you. LSD is nothing like MDMA. When I did it for the first time, all I did was curl up comfortably in my bed, put on some headphones, and went on some wonderful adventures in my own mind. Socializing just feels odd on LSD, and it&#039;s a lot better to use it for self-exploration IMO. I highly suggest not doing LSD for a club situation. If you want to do a psychedelic at a club, 2C-B will give you a far better experience. Or you can just stick to good ol MDA and MDMA.<br /><br />TLDR; LSD is not a great club drug, and it&#039;s a lot better suited for intimate environments

				First, I agree fully with junjo that LSD is not a social or party drug. Seeing as how this would be your first time I would also suggest a comfortable place and a trip sitter. A positive LSD experience is all about SET and SETTING. If you want a good party drug stick with Molly. If you want to go anywhere in the universe from the comfort of your own living room, then LSD is definitely for you! 120ug will be a good strong dose for your first time also, myself, I took 130ug last week and spent the day riding rollercoasters! You gotta learn to crawl before you can learn to walk. Whatever you decide...enjoy!!!

				LSD is a compound for internal exploration, that&#039;s the oposite of a social drug like MDMA.
