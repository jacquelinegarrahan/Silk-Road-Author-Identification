				Over a period of about 5 days I had a minor coke binge where I insufflated about 1.5 grams the most being on last sunday which was 0.6. I did some more on wed 3 days after and did not respond at all! The stuff has great reviews and looks the good and the vendor is 100% legit so it can not be a dud product. I had some more recently and still did not respond at all ( not much of a rapid heart beat and no rise in body temp) and also yesterday I took 70mg of ritalin which is very similar to coke only&nbsp; 1 molecule diff and I normally respond to that good and I did not feel anything from it either.<br /><br />But in the middle of all this I am still responding to oxycodone..... Could it be my body needs a rest as I am just so tolerant already? before my minor binge I had not used for about 3 years.<br /><br />Any help is appreciated.

				Yea, I&#039;d recommend you take a break from it for a bit. You&#039;ll probably feel like shit for a while, but your brain probably needs it.

				I will have a break for say 5 days. Shouldn&#039;t good coke still give you a buzz no matter what though? In saying that though if I get no response from ritalin which I hadn&#039;t taken for a while either there is definitely something up with dopamine or something....

				My situation differs from yours, but it may give you some insight anyway. I have been doing coke on and off (mostly on) for 25 years. For the past few months I have been doing around 2 grams during a single session, once every two weeks or so. I&#039;m a snorter only, and I don&#039;t do any other drugs, apart from the odd ecstacy pill at a party or concert once in a while.<br /><br />Coke still gives me a good rush, but I do notice that I&#039;ve built up a tolerance. The negative side effects also kick in a lot sooner. I&#039;ve always been somewhat prone to paranoia when I&#039;m on the stuff, but whereas it only used to happen towards the end of my 2g binges, it happens a lot sooner now, often after I&#039;ve done less than a gram.<br /><br />Recently I have started to take L-Tyrosine together with vitamin B6 in an effort to combat dopamine depletion. From what I understand, L-Tyrosine is a natural precursor to dopamine, and it seems to help me. You may want to look into doing the same.<br /><br />Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me will be able to comment on whether or not this will work for you.

				Thanks for your response fastcat. You being tolerant after 25 years is more plausible than me being tolerant after a little 5 day binge consistant of 1.5gs??<br />The stuff has a lot of positive reviews I get the drip and that but no numbing and no euphoria. I was doing big lines yesterday and even just stuck a straw in the bag and finished it off which would of been a monster line if I set it up correctly , got a minor buzz but no where near the normal cocaine high which is suspected. With Ritalin not working either there is something that is not right.....quite frustrated.

				I would say your serotonin levels are way down, dopamine produces this and obviously if you are binging coke it doesnt get a chance to get back to normal. Taking a whole week off to recover is my advice, you will not only benefit for it mentally, but you will enjoy your coke a heap better.<br /><br />Taking the coke and not getting the effects is just a waste IMO. If others have had a good experience, then clearly the issue may lie with you. Are you feeling any sadness or irritability? These are tell tale signs of substance abuse. Just slow down a bit. Way too many stimulants.

				Yes, after a 5 day coke binge, you should take a break.<br /><br />Common sense is different than it used to be, I guess.

				Thank you very much for all your input. I find that when I start a session (normally started with 2 big lines) I can never get high like that again in that session...by taking more all it does is avoid the comedown and delays that but no high anymore dopamine must get screwed quick , any one else have the same experience?<br /><br />Basically when you start session nice high for 20-30 mins really intense and all taking more does is delay comedown but I get shakey and the anxiety symptoms etc.
