				I have been smoking weed some years and can say that before I decided to quit the daily use I did it everyday.<br />Still haven&#039;t understand the difference between those two terms. Or maybe I would say, never bothered. But there is indeed so big difference?<br />I don&#039;t know. I always asked from my dealers weed. None ever bothered telling me &quot;hey try this Indica or try this Sativa&quot;.&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />Anyway. <br />Just wanted to say in other words &#039;&#039;I am subscribing to this thread to try and learn the difference between those 2&quot;<br /><br />Really nice thread Railgun!

				Sativa! Energy and still functioning, its a good day smoke and the smoke I prefer. Excellent head-space, its like looking at things from a different angle for me.<br /><br />Indica! Relaxation and MUNCHIES, this shit makes me dumb and want to fuck. Best reserved for night, best before food, sex and sleep. Usually all 3 in that order.<br /><br />

				Posters above me described it perfectly<br /><br />Most of my friends prefer sativa, but for some reason when I smoke large amounts my heart starts beating TOO fast, it&#039;s weird.... SO I personally try to stick to a good hybrid or indica strain.... the BEST weed you will ever smoke will probably be a sativa strain though (in my opinion)

				Sativa, I am chronically tired and Indica just makes me into a lazy couch blob who eats way too much crap and doesn&#039;t want to do anything else. Sativas make me want to go out and be in nature, write, and be creative. For mellowing out a stimulant high though, Indica is good to have around.

				I&#039;m naturally energetic and light depressants just make me feel strange. I like the pseudo-stimulation effects that sativa gives me, it makes me think more and want to do more.&nbsp; Indica makes me just feel anxious, lazy, and makes it hard to keep myself busy.

				I&#039;ve never even smoked weed but I&#039;m seeking sativa.&nbsp; Having a hard time finding it though.&nbsp; SR seems to be mostly indica and hybrids.&nbsp; There is a lot of conflicting about a lot of breeds as well.<br /><br />Reading online there&#039;s a lot of information that the CBD:THC ratio means a lot so I&#039;m not looking for a hybrid although would take one for cheap.

				Go always for the sativa.<br />If you buy...<br /><br />With 9 small fingers on its leaves<br /><br />Indica looks more like a cristmastree and produces a whole lot more weed, but not that strong high.<br />If you want strong weed, always go for the sativa.<br /><br />To make money, you should grow only indica.<br />A indica delivers 80 to 90% more weight.<br /><br />So to grow and sell take the indica, to smoke buy the sativa<br /><br />I do grow weed, every year, for over 30 years now, so I think I have some experience.<br /><br />Look at strainhunters on youtube (Dutch)

				Been smoking for decade(s) before I had the opportunity to choose between the two.&nbsp; Love SR.&nbsp; It has been fun getting to pick without flying to the Netherlands.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been using Leafly (Apple lets them have an app?) and a book called &quot;Buds&quot; by Ed Rosenthal.&nbsp; The book is dated and only 1 of 4 volumes, but has great pictures and info about growing and breeding.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sativas seem to have been the rarity in my smoking career and they seem the be the minority of buds on SR.&nbsp; I just got some quality Alaskan Thunder Fuck from anonymart that was good.&nbsp; <br /><br />From a consumer standpoint, the sativa buds seem to be more hollow, easier to crush and compress with your fingers.&nbsp; That has been my impression so far.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				100% of either is uncommon. Most commonly sold strains of marijuana are hybrids. <br /><br />That said, strong sativas (90%+ or higher) increase your heart rate and can cause an annoying twitch in the eye due to either the constriction or dilation of the blood vessels. I don&#039;t recall which. 80% or so sativa tends to keep you awake and alert, or at the very least a sense of desire to propel or exert one&#039;s self. I prefer sativas for physical exertion and creative work, such as sex and marketing. 100% Sativas give me a fair amount of mental clarity and focus.<br /><br />Strong Indicas (75%+) tend to induce couchlock and and desire to rest, or at least remain at rest. I enjoy these the most when watching documentaries or preparing to go to sleep. I fidget in bed when sober and do not when stoned on a heavy Indica. <br /><br />

				Oh this thread got swallowed up. I thought it had died.<br /><br />Anyway, I prefer leaning hybrids.<br /><br />Sativa-dominant hybrids for day<br />Indica-dominant hybrids for the night.<br /><br />Pure Sativas give me unfocused energy.&nbsp; For example, Green Crack (hybrid but basically sativa) is too much for me. It stays true to its name, and I have a hard time making much sense of things. Great for a party or when you want to just enjoy stimuli.<br /><br />Pure Indicas are a NyQuil supplement. I had some double afghani off the road, and I just fell asleep. The sleep was very restful and deep, even moreover than that of sleeping aids.<br /><br />I think Hybrids are where it&#039;s at.

				I&#039;ve been smoking weed for just over a year now and only because of SR have I recently been exploring different strains. Before, it was like weed was weed- I didn&#039;t have the options to be picky.<br /><br />I just got a sample of a sativa strain (via a pre-rolled joint) and half a gram of BC bubble hash from the vendor leaf to experiment a little. If I like the sativa bud I&#039;ll be ordering at least a half oz of it. I just sat down and smelled my leftover old stuff and the pre-rolled sativa joint- there is definitely a difference.
