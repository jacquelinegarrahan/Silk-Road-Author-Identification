				in one of the new intervention episodes, terry a fentanyl addict, takes a type of fentanyl strip and throws it into a cooker. he adds vit C but he was also adding crack to his injection so maybe he added the vit c to break down the base? the bottom line is id like to know what brand fent patch he was using. it wasnt a gel patch, and he is from canada. aside from the lollipops ive never heard of someone being able to cook up a fent patch.&nbsp; he seemed super trashed after his dose. <br /><br />if anyone knows responde por favor <br /><br />thanks mr v

				i actually saw that too and thought it was interesting<br /><br />first, i have to say in the attitude of harm reduction - i really think extreme caution must be used if attempting to IV fent, just because you may not extract the patch fully your first few attempts and then accidentally get a whopping dose which could easily be fatal <br /><br />I dont know specifics but I did read in another post that someone used to IV fent by adding citric but mentioned that was before a formulation change<br /><br />there are a few threads on opiophile and bluelight, some from years ago mention sandoz and duragesic patches.<br /><br />more recently on bluelight it appears people are attempting IPA extractions or even just vinegar extractions using mylan patches. <br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/488146-Extracting-fentanyl-from-polymer-matrix-patches/page6?s=f97e85878d6a95521336af05592ee94a<br /><br />http://forum.opiophile.org/archive/index.php/t-13840.html
