				So there&#039;s been a strange occurrence in my life that maybe someone here can shed light upon...<br /><br />I&#039;ve experimented with most drugs except the three top tier substances (heroin, meth, crack),&nbsp; pharmaceutical stimulants are the only things I fuck with on a weekly basis and I still indulge in hallucinogens and MDMA for concerts or special occasions. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been known as somewhat of a heavy weight, whether it be drinking or drugging I can always consume an significantly higher amount that anyone around me, and still keep my composure. This is the case with every substance I&#039;ve done with the exception of one....marijuana.<br /><br />Marijuana has been a mystery to me since day one. After the first couple bad experiences I encountered way back in the day, I&#039;ve attempted once or twice each year to smoke it again, convincing myself that the effects will be different and I&#039;ll have a good time. Here&#039;s the jist of the effects I get.<br /><br />20% of the time: Decent experience. Very spacey, IQ seems to plummet. Demeanor becomes childlike and unnaturally gentle and giddy. Very strange sense of weight/pressure on my body.<br /><br />80% of the time:&nbsp; Purely awful experience. An unbearably heavy pressure on my body that quickly turns into nausea. This frightens me as I know that marijuana is boasted to help ease nausea. Vision becomes completely fucked, sometimes I get rapid fire vision and world blurring almost like I&#039;m on a psychedelic. I then usually end up puking, varying in terms of severity depending on how I smoked. If I take a GB, it can be violent projectile vomiting followed by hours over the toilet. I&#039;m talking nausea only matched by when I had the stomach flu and after I drink a bottle of Bombay Sapphire to the face.<br /><br />What do you think the problem is? I&#039;d say it seems to be anxiety related, and I will also note that the good experiences generally come when I smoke very high quality bud, such as some fire Blue Dream. Seems the worst nausea comes from when the quality is sub-par, as I can always tell when shit&#039;s going to hit the fan by how harsh and shitty the weed taste upon the first hit. The wild changes in vision seem to come when smoking a sativa, these I don&#039;t mind so much but generally people don&#039;t expect visuals from smoking weed so naturally it throws me off a bit. Thanks for any info that can put this curiosity to rest. <br /><br />

				Never heard of this particular effect on someone, but everyone&#039;s different.&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually that kind of stuff happens when people mix it with other drugs.&nbsp; I know for example that I can&#039;t mix opiates and weed.. get sick everytime, but most peeps don&#039;t have that problem.

				Well no mixtures are involved, I know that when I smoke on a psychedelic it sends me to another level of hallucinations, but other than that I&#039;ve never mixed weed with anything as I&#039;ve always been nervous that I&#039;ll get sick as usual.

The only way you will know is from the reviews, and the way the vendor promotes their product/ picture but even then you still don&#039;t know for sure.&nbsp; If its super smelly, crystally, and sticky when it arrives its definitely high quality.&nbsp; How your body reacts to it is another story.&nbsp; Always good to get a gram if you can and then decide if want to buy more.&nbsp; <br /><br />Crappy mid-grade and swag can certainly just make you just feel tired (dunno about ill, again depends on person)<br /><br />There&#039;s a reason why there are different strains used for different conditions though (medically speaking).&nbsp; Some offer more pain relief, more anxiety relief, etc, but again needs to be a good vendor for that.

				I suppose my negative reactions to weed can be seen as a sort of blessing, as I&#039;ve saved tens of thousands of dollars compared to the money my pot head friends spend on weed, and the substances I use cannot be taken habitually for the most part so it isn&#039;t much of a financial dent. Whereas I have friends who smoke through 6-8 grams a day and have to be high to even have an appetite or be content with what they&#039;re doing. Plus my productivity hasn&#039;t suffered as marijuana can definitely have detrimental effects on an individual&#039;s work ethic.<br /><br />However, I&#039;d like to be able to sit back every once and awhile and enjoy a blunt for some rest and relaxation.

				Check out gardenfresh (vendor) then, would be interesting to see how bud does you.&nbsp; You can get a gram for like 1 BTC, and the shipping is good / stealth.&nbsp; Its Indica so its more relaxing, in my opinion.&nbsp; Not trying to promote him, but hes new and the price is right :)<br /><br />Heres a link for the sample:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d904a72f24<br /><br />The pic doesn&#039;t do it justice btw<br /><br />Also out of curiosity have you smoked by yourself doing something relaxing that you already enjoy before (vs crowded places , with friends etc)&nbsp;

				Unfortunately this kind of thing just happens to a small amount of people..I&#039;ve never had reactions as bad as you&#039;ve described, but I definitely don&#039;t enjoy smoking weed anymore because I have bad reactions.<br />I used to smoke every single day for months straight and enjoyed every second of it. I quit eventually as I was getting drug-tested, and when I was able to smoke weed again I hated it. It made me paranoid, depressed and slow as hell. I was literally incapacitated mentally for the whole rest of the day after smoking. I couldn&#039;t do basic math, I could barely drive, I had no working memory, etc. It was bad. <br />So, I&#039;ve accepted that I can&#039;t really smoke weed anymore. I think our brain&#039;s just get used to not having it and ramp-up the amount of anandamide resulting in a more paranoid, much more fucked up, experience. <br /><br />Something you might try is taking much, much smaller hits. Try smoking ONE hit off a small pipe, barely burn the weed and see what happens. Torching the shit out of a bowl in a bong is bound to leave you couch-locked and more fucked up than you wanted to be. Also, make sure you stay hydrated...<br />This might be because you are deficient in some essential vitamins or minerals, and smoking is what reveals these symptoms you might otherwise not experience. If it matters a lot to you, you could go to the doctor and get a blood test for vitamin/mineral deficiencies, as well as blood pressure.

				I would also make sure your not smoking too much, specially after alcohol a strong half a J to yourself if your not a regular could turn you into vomiting mush. Its happened to me a few times after i&#039;ve gone a few months without smoking and think I can handle a full J. Next thing I know i&#039;m layed out trying to focus on not vomiting. Maybe you should try doing a small amount and leave 20m gaps to monitor the effects and work your way up.

				Trust me, if you have these experiences stay away from weed. Predisposed illnesses are brought out by weed, and I never knew it until a few years down the line. I started getting very bad anxiety and couldn&#039;t even think straight, I started not even being able to talk to people, and everywhere I went was just constant paranoia and anxiety. I was diagnosed with PTSD as a kid, and the weed brought it back out.

				Nausea:&nbsp; I&#039;m a total stoner with an extremely high tolerance, been smoking weed for more years than I can say here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only felt nausea once and that was smoking some new stuff from a wizard-like grower who ended up keeping the harvest for himself.&nbsp; The stuff brought me to my knees, grower got same report from others so for me, it was the level of THC and taking a greedy hit.<br /><br />@Bluejacuet wants to know: &quot;There seems to be a thousand different types of weed.&nbsp; Well, which are the good ones?&nbsp; Which are the bad ones?&nbsp; Or are they all just a bunch of BS names to make the cannabis to sound attractive to buyers and a buyer never really know what he&#039;s going to get?&nbsp; So, any input any of you may have into picking out good weed would be appreciated.&quot;&nbsp; &gt;BASICALLY:&nbsp; INDICA &amp; SATIVA plus HYBRIDS.&nbsp; It&#039;s all a matter of taste, like having a preference for either red wine or white white. For me, Indica is a heavy duty nighttime weed &amp; Sativa is lighter daytime/creative buzz weed.&nbsp; Sativa sometimes causes me anxiety.&nbsp; I stay away from hybrids. Just my experience.&nbsp; Good resource for starting out: http://www.kindgreenbuds.com/strainlibrary.html<br /><br /><br />

				This reminds me of Dave Chappelle when he&#039;s in the Indian hut screaming &quot;The weed&#039;s too strong!&quot; ....you&#039;d have it to see it, I can&#039;t do it justice haha<br /><br />A lot of people I know seem to think the weed 20 years ago was just not as strong as a lot of the newer stuff that&#039;s out and so when they smoke now they need use less. I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s something about really stong indicas or sativas that makes the difference. We&#039;ve been stocking stuff both very high in THC (like the sativa we have) but also stuff like HQ that is high in CBD with a much lower THC. The higher CBD and lower THC seems to help those with pain who don&#039;t want to get extremely spaced out. Now we&#039;re looking at whether it is better to have an indica dominate hybrid with high CBD or sativa dominate hybrid with high CBD to remain functional but still receive the medical benefits.<br /><br />I know there are a people on here with a lot more knowledge than us in this area which is why we&#039;re taking requests for what people think is best for them and trying to find those.<br /><br />
