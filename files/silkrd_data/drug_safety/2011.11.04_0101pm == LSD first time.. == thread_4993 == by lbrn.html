				At my first I took a quarter and after that another quarter.<br /><br />Just find a calm place, few people, everybody with LSD in brain.<br /><br />Keep in your mind it will not kill you or anything. A half tab of a good one can make a begginer trips a lot, but you just have to stay calm.

				I&#039;d recommend starting with a minimum of 100ug. <br /><br />I tend to have a high tolerance for psychedelics, but my first trip was on a 150ug tab and I certainly would have enjoyed more. Had mild visuals. Some wavyness, brighter colors, trails following things, seeing faces in things and whatnot. Great euphoria that flowed with the music. And as per usual, a wonderful sense of purpose and connectedness.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tripped with some people introducing themselves to psychedelics who started off with 2-3 tabs and still had a blast. In my opinion, you really just need to be in a place where you are comfortable or around people who make you comfortable. A friend who took 3 tabs her first time had a short paranoia attack and was smiling so much she&#039;d thought she would break her face. It&#039;s really only your own fear that can get in your way. Remember you&#039;ll be OK and enjoy the ride, because you will be OK and you will enjoy the ride :)<br /><br />Blotter is blotter, just check the potency and dose accordingly. Being on LSD around other people on LSD is also great because you likely won&#039;t get caught up in your own thoughts of &quot;oh no! what if...&quot; and instead will be off with your friends feeling paintings on the wall or watching each blade of grass in a field react individually to the world.<br /><br />After a long break from acid I split half a dalai lama blotter with a friend. Really wished I had the whole thing, but sharing has it&#039;s own benefits. Anyways, if you need an activity I had a hell of a time that night watching &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (trippy french movie, subtitled in english) with the sound off and Shpongle blasting through the speakers. IT WAS PERFECT!<br /><br />Enjoy though, I hope you have a great experience to add to the books.

				I would just go ahead and take a tab of whatever you have. Don&#039;t take so little that you don&#039;t get the full experience and end up somewhat disappointed. Most blotters won&#039;t have but 100-150ug anyways. Even if you do get a good (and I mean good) 180ug+, you should still be alright as long as you&#039;re in a nice setting.

				LSD is LSD... there aren&#039;t 2 types of LSD. some blotter papers have different amounts of LSD on each hit, but it&#039;s all the same drug. i think this is what you were thinking, but i might be wrong. I do know that a lot of people believe &#039;red geltab is better than pink elephant&#039;, but it really comes down to whether or not it&#039;s actually lsd and how much lsd is in in/on it. that&#039;s the main reason getting acid from a friend that has done some of the same &#039;batch&#039; was always important to me. but i guess that goes for any drug, hopefully i can make some &#039;friends&#039; here :) <br /><br />that being said, i&#039;m with everyone on here for the most part. 100 mcg is a good place to start, and i think 150 mcg is still safe. taking 200 mcg is a fun time, but for some people it may be a bit too &#039;mind blowing&#039; for a first trip. i think 50 mcg would be a disappointment, and i never wanted to take some, and then a little later take some more... but that might just be me being weird.

				oh, and just to echo what some other people are saying here, environment is everything. take it around a few people you can trust, preferably with other people that are tripping, although it&#039;s not a bad idea to have a sober &#039;babysitter&#039; just in case :)

				you have probably already made your decision, but my advice is this.<br /><br />You only get ONE first time, so swing for the fences!<br /><br />that being said, set and setting are most important. as long as you feel safe and secure in the environment you choose to trip in, don&#039;t fear Lucy. She will be whatever you want her to be. LSD is nothing to be afraid of, but my experience is that under dosing causes anxiety, and the fear can creap in. you need to be able to let go and allow the magic to wash over you.<br /><br />Remeber that LSD can&#039;t kill you, but the fear can(your buzz anyway), so keep friends around, and always remember that it is a drug you have chosen to take, and the effects are temporary.<br /><br />Also, as to re-dosing, LSD tolerance builds VERY quickly, so re-dosing should be done within the first two hours of your trip, and most people I know are content with their first peak, and dodn&#039;t re-dose in time, and end up underwhelmed with their experience as a whole, so again my advice is to swing for the fences.<br /><br />My first trip was 2 tabs of ~100µg about 15 years ago, and since I have gone on many journeys with higher doses, but none shine in my memory like the first time. when I look back on that first night, however, I only wish I had taken a bit more.<br /><br />you will not be dissapointed.

				Pretty much all good advice here.&nbsp; In my experience, the most important factors in determining if you will have a good or bad trip is your frame of mind prior to going into your trip and who you are tripping with.&nbsp; Depressed?&nbsp; Don&#039;t drop.&nbsp; With people you&#039;re not quite sure about?&nbsp; Don&#039;t drop with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />The main thing to remember is LSD will amplify whatever vibe you&#039;re on prior to dropping.&nbsp; Do it in an setting you feel safe about, and with friends you trust.&nbsp; The most common trigger for a bad trip is the irrational but unshakable feeling that you are going insane and the trip will last forever.&nbsp; This can get triggered if you&#039;re tripping alone, or if you&#039;re tripping with sober people.&nbsp; But remember this--I&#039;ve probably dropped over a couple hundred times at some pretty heroic doses and never had a trip I didn&#039;t come out of within 24 hrs, so remind yourself of that if you start to freak out.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually a good idea on a first time to trip with a trusted friend who&#039;s tripped before, to act as a kind of guide.&nbsp; But as long as you&#039;re with good people you should have a blast.&nbsp; Go with it and above all have fun!

				Quick question to follow up on the OP&#039;s post. I&#039;ve never taken LSD either, but have done mushrooms and had positive experiences. What would you think of taken half a blotter or so before a 6 hour plane ride? Put some tunes on and look out the window. Would this be chill or potentially too intense? I know I am a calm person and have no fear of &quot;losing&quot; myself. But I also want to be comfortable. What do you guys think?<br /><br />vr/<br />bhenigma77

				Just me, but I can&#039;t think of a more miserable way to spend six hours.&nbsp; Have a few drinks and drop when you get off the plane.&nbsp; The baggage carousel would be a blast!<br /><br />FYI, the experience on LSD is very similar to mushrooms, main difference being that LSD lasts longer and depending on the batch may not be as &quot;clean&quot; of a high.&nbsp; If I know the acid is good and professionally cooked, I prefer LSD to shrooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy travels!

				I have never done lsd(plan on doing it soon) but first time on a plane? I cant think of a more terrifying place to do it. I would say do it somewhere you feel safe and in a constant familiar environment. I tend to have a fleeting imagination while on drugs that would have the potential to send me into a tizzy. I have had mushrooms a handful of times and while I have never had a bad trip, I fucking panic sometimes. Also with the stigma of lsd, if you were to be discovered while one it, even if you were doing absolutely no harm; could result in some repercussions. People are so ignorant of the drug and would assume the worst. Especially in this political environment.

				While we&#039;re on the subject...&nbsp; some friends and I are looking to try acid for the first time.&nbsp; We want to do it outside in nature but now that it&#039;s getting colder, that&#039;s becoming less of a possibility.&nbsp; I was thinking about getting some 120/130 mcg blotters from one of the sellers here on SR now, then storing it until springtime.&nbsp; Or should I just wait and buy it when I&#039;m ready to take it?&nbsp; We have no access to LSD in our town, and TBH I&#039;m a bit paranoid about this place getting shut down and cutting off my only chance to get my hands on some.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve also heard that LSD doesn&#039;t keep well.&nbsp; Any advice?

				im tempted to try again, but woudl appreciate your advice. 1st time i toomk it, i was with mates, all smoking weed getting hihg, i droopped 2 tabs, the rest 1, i remember walking itnot town , all 4 of us, just laughing having a&nbsp; good time, then (we were going to see silence of the lambs at cinema) got to eh queue outside, i suddently said ... &quot;hold on a minute, somehtings different, somegtiungs chnaged&quot;, one of my mattes, had a grin on his face and said he just needded to go for a walk ... i started to feel a bit panickly , or weird, not panic .... but i remember, nby the cinema is a massive open greeen park and i said, &quot; look, shall we just head there for ea bit &quot; ... i needed to figure out what was going on, but my mates were all like ... we cant leave the queue peopel will think were to frighted to see the film! which had the rest of my mate sin hysterics .... anyway long story short, i should have insisted to go and figure it out, as the rest of the time my trip experiece, wasnt good, not full on terror, that came the next time i tripped.... - so decided lsd, not for me ...<br /><br />however, a few years later i tried again, and actually thins time (whilst at back of mind im thinking shoit, hope i dont freak out), was much better had some amazing visuals, just loooking at sky, one minute the moon had clouds with all diferent shapes in it, next time the shapes had chnaged etc etc , so was good, but again had that gnawing sense of almost expecting a para attack ... which for 6 hours aint pleasant. <br /><br />rreason im tempted to try again, is that im much more stable , been with my gilfirend 6 years, feel comfortable in myself (ok, eevryo now and then get moody) so will only drop, when in a good mood .... <br /><br />just think is it worth doing, just to say, ive had my tip and it was all goooooooodd,.....<br /><br />btw - just started smoking dope a little bit now and the and when im with the missus i feel all good, if im in a crowded house and folks drop by that i dont knoiw, sometime,s especially if im teally stoned, i can get teh panic, but usually goes after a while .....<br /><br />MEDIIIIICCCCCCCC !!!!!

				I found that WEED really enhances LSD trips but not if you are a regular smoker. I only smoke once every 2-3 days and in small quantities but over weekends in take LSD and around the 10 hour mark (from the time i first took the acid) i smoke a larger quantity of weed and get so rocked...Last weekend just on 180 mics of LSD and some 0.2g of WEED i felt like i was Alice in wonderland&nbsp; ;D

				Jesus man, I hope you&#039;re joking. Even sober, air travel is at best a tedious, uncomfortable, and claustrophobic experience and at worst a terrifying one (ever rapidly lost altitude in a thunderstorm?). Zazzle your senses on acid and at best you&#039;re going to be clawing your head off in your seat for 6 hours and at worst end up getting tasered by an air marshal, your face all over the evening news.<br /><br />For air travel, stick to benzos.
