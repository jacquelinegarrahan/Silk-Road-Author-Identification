				I recently bought som &quot;pure fishscale&quot; coke from a vendor with a very good rating and no complaints. Since I have only done street cocaine a handful of times, I assumed that this stuff would blow me away. However, when i received the package, I had to do up to .25 before I started to feel any real noticeable effects. From what I read, .1 is enough to fuck up people who do street coke regularly, so I don&#039;t understand why I had such a mediocre experience, since i only do the occaisional line of street coke every couple of months. Does anybody have any clue as to why this is? I remember back in high school, when I smoked weed for the first time, I actually didn&#039;t start to &quot;get high&quot; until about the 2nd or 3rd time that I smoked. Do you think the same thing could happen to me with cocaine? The vendor I bought from has no negative complaints so I want to make sure it has nothing to do with me before I start making accusations. I am going to try giving some coke to one of my more coke-knowledgeable friends to see what he thinks as well. The stuff came in rock form, smelled funny and you had to chop it up before you snorted it, so that seems a lot like fishscale to me.

I really don&#039;t want to believe that though. I&#039;ll get a better idea once i give some to my &quot;colleague&quot;. I already finalized the payment, so i suppose the only option now would be to give bad feedback, and a nasty forum review. I&#039;ve tried messaging him about this issue, but have received no response as of yet, which seems like a bad sign. On the other hand, i&#039;m sure coke vendors get a lot of people trying to scam them into sending free product or giving a refund

				I don&#039;t think doing lines is like smoking joints, where you have to do it a few times to get it right. In my experience, everyone feels almost immediate effects from snorting their first line. My guess would be that the quality was not very good, seems more likely than any other explanation. By all means, contact the vendor to explain your concerns. Also a good idea not to finalize until you&#039;ve tested the product, as you&#039;ve found out, there&#039;s nothing you can do once you finalize before confirming the quality.

				Keep in mind that high purity cocaine will give full effects at about the 10minute mark after snorting.&nbsp; That is when the real euphoria hits you.<br /><br />

				No reverse tolerance to Cocaine - especially if you&#039;ve already used it.<br /><br />You got weak gear.<br /><br />Why would you tell him you&#039;re a newbie before ordering anyway?

				I sent him a message before buying asking him how much i should take since i havent done coke very often. No response from him, so i placed the order anyway figuring he didnt want to answer a dumb newb question. I know know i never shouldve sent that message in the first place. im a retard. Is there any way to tell the difference between fishscale, and &quot;rerocked&quot; stuff?

				Get a second and third opinion on the quality. If it&#039;s bad then talk to the vendor and explain the issues. Try and negotiate a better deal for another purchase. If note, give him a poor feedback and review in the forums.

				It&#039;s either bunk product, or...<br /><br />...you have only previously experienced shit coke with active &#039;upper&#039; cuts...you then tried out some good coke and did not expect the smoother hit which your brain then labelled as &#039;weak&#039;.<br /><br />You&#039;d be surprised at how often the second scenario occurs.
