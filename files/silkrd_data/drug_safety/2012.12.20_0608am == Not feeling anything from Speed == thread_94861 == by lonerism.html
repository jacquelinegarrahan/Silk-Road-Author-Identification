				Hi guys<br />I&#039;ve snorted a bit of Speed (speed amphetamine). Probably about 100mg but not feeling any effects. Been over an hour but heart rate still basically the same etc.<br />It&#039;s weird because on the product page people were reviewing it saying it was &quot;awesome gear&quot; etc.<br />When I did Meth I felt it and knew it was affecting me.<br />Does it just sound poorly cut?<br /><br />

				Sounds like lactose or inositol or whatever the Hell they cut speed with other than caffeine.&nbsp; The feedback system is shit... never trust it.&nbsp; Always research a vendor here on the forums, and if you don&#039;t find enough reviews to make you comfortable, just pass.

				The amphetamines tend to amplify moods and mindsets, so when a negative one comes up it is important to check whether or not it is real before blurting out to the non-tweaker public in a panic (or even tweaker friends for that matter), &quot;Did you see those shadow people?!&quot; The cut conversation is a similar thread of negativity that ought to have some objectivity brought to it.<br /><br />First, it is entirely possible to dose with real 100% pure gear and feel relatively nothing after some period of regular usage. There are sensitivity effects which researchers still do not fully understand about amphetamines. This includes the sensitization regiments for increasing the feeling as well as spontaneous desensitization or sensitization.<br /><br />Second, measure the melting point. Taste it. Smell it (solid and vapor). Write it down. Based on these observations, is it what you think it is? If not, what could it be? What are ways to separate or identify or distinguish those possibilities? Not being high usually helps prevent accidents and breakage along these lines.<br /><br />Third, crush the contents of the stash and mix them together. If there is cut or impurity the average actual dose will be consistent (no ghost hits, phantom rails, etc) and one won&#039;t get shafted on the last dose.<br /><br />

				Same here!<br />Just bought some amph. &amp; didn&#039;t feel a thing! though it burnt my inner brain tissues!<br /><br />.. I also never felt anything from Adderall pills.<br /><br />I concluded that it affects people differently, so it prob not for me&nbsp; :-\

				Any drug can be of high quality without psychologically feeling an effect when you are either on antidepressants or antipsychotics.<br />Or you use A LOT more, while it does a lot more damage as well..<br /><br />If you&#039;re not on meds and speed didnt make you feel anything then it was crap.<br /><br />

There&#039;s no not-noticing it. There&#039;s no amplifying negative emotions, because the dopamine rush will take you over. You will be 100% this is the real deal. Even if you&#039;ve been awake for 3 days. what hl887 is talking about comes with regular (meth)amph usage. My guess: OP bought shit. Most speed on here is.

				I experience the same thing as the OP. When I smoke meth I feel more awake and alert and have only got a few head rushes, never any euphoria. Maybe my lack of euphoria has something to do with my ADHD or my high tolerance ( I&#039;ve been using daily amphetamines for 7 years). <br /><br />OP: If you don&#039;t mind me asking do you have ADHD? I&#039;ve heard anecdotal reports that people with ADHD experience amphetamine highs different than those without.

				Speed was literally invented to help ADHD, powerful stimulants actually have a reversed calming effect. I remember, I took &quot;speed&quot; pills when I was younger to keep me from going apeshit.

I mean no disrespect, honestly. But yes, it has everything to do with daily usage for 7 years. I dare to predict that you probably won&#039;t get any euphoria from amphetamine ever again. 1 months daily is probably more than enough to kill all euphoria. The Euphoria is caused by the dopamine rush the amph causes. If your brain never regenerates and &quot;refills&quot; there can&#039;t be any euphoria. <br /><br />Think about H-addicts: Most (all?) say it&#039;s fun and euphoric at the beginning, but soon you take it only to feel normal. No more fun/euphoria. That&#039;s the point you are at.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94861.msg675496#msg675496">Quote from: MsMETHeMETHics on December 21, 2012, 10:46 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">OP: If you don&#039;t mind me asking do you have ADHD?

But they help everyone to concentrate. If you have difficulties with that, you will notice the boost much more of course. A lot of stimulants calm down kids/young people, so they are generally well accepted among parents who don&#039;t like parenting. I don&#039;t know one single kid (in my generation) or ever heard of one who was diagnosed with ADHD. Interestingly ADHD has a much higher occurrence where the meds (amph/ritalin) are handed out like candy (i.e. US). <br /><br />In Europe almost no one has ADHD, I still haven&#039;t heard of a single occurrence among family/friends and their friends. It&#039;s just a set of annoying symptoms a lot of children have, so they can be labeled ADHD. The kids don&#039;t complain, the boring shit they have to do isn&#039;t boring anymore, parents are happy because their kids are tweaking on homework. <br /><br />my 0.02btc, slightly exaggerated. <br />
