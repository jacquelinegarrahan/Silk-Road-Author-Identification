				I read somewhere it has to do with the release of adrenaline, which basically makes your body go into &#039;combat-or-run-mode&#039;. <br />While fighting or running there is no need for blood in your penis that&#039;s why it gets tiny. <br /><br />And don&#039;t worry it&#039;s only temporary indeed :P

				MDMA can make your penis explode if you use it just once, which is why taking it is called rolling (you roll around on the floor after your penis explodes). The substance itself is often called molly because after taking it that is what people will start calling you.

				Yeah, sex is great on MDMA.<br /><br />As for me I have a mood changes on MDMA: longer periods of euphoria and short periods of disphoria with a quick (seconds) transitions between them.<br /><br />On &#039;high&#039; phases I have a strong boner with no ability to come - so sex seems endless :). But then in a few seconds I have all my libido gone and erection disappears.<br /><br />Weird, but still the best moments of my life.<br /><br />It&#039;s only worth to take MDMA is when there are two of you doing it. Taking it alone is like watching a great movie&#039;s bad sequel: same actors but no magic.
