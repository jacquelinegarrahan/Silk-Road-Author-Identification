				Hi all,<br /><br />I have noticed through talking to other users that not enough people do much about reducing harm from drug taking when there are so many ways of doing so. I think it would be great if more people started looking after themselves and being conscious of ways to reduce harm, especially after doing&nbsp; things like binging on meth.<br /><br />I thought I would make a thread for people to get information on what vitamins, supplements, foods, drinks, physical tasks (like exercise) or any other means to reduce harm from drug taking and to be healthier in general. <br /><br />If people could post what they take, why and for what drug that would be great. For example taking 5-htp after rolls to encourage serotonin reproduction. Any input would be appreciated.<br /><br />Post away, my friends.

				Interesting initiative, however, binging is obviously something to avoid.&nbsp; Be it with illegal or legal drugs.&nbsp; You can even have a potato binge that could ruin your health for that matter.<br /><br />The supplements I take are actually part of my regular diet.&nbsp; That&#039;s mainly because I believe most of the food we get these days doesn&#039;t actually contain all the nutrients we were promised.&nbsp; A whole other matter unfortunately.<br />Of course the quality of the supplements taken is more essential than we think.&nbsp; A lot of over the counter vitamins are very low quality and our bodies have a hard time assimilating them.&nbsp; Main reason is because our organisms are not accustomed to synthesized nutrients and are used to assimilating natural cocktails (veg/fruit/meats/cereal/etc.) that stimulate several bodily functions at once to provide the required sustenance.<br /><br />This is our current dilemma.&nbsp; Maybe if the food we ate today was what our genes are expecting then we wouldn&#039;t be asking these questions.<br />Why does it suck being in the hospital and when you get out you start feeling better?&nbsp; Their food sucks.&nbsp; It&#039;s cheap and you have no idea where it came from.<br /><br />That&#039;s today&#039;s rant...<br /><br /><br />I will go into the supplements I take at a later date, although i&#039;ve already mentioned them on a thread where a user was having trouble recovering from benzo abuse.<br /><br />My main recommendation is diversifying your sources of nutrition.&nbsp; Adding even the smallest things like a herb or exotic sauce in your diet can help.<br /><br />I remember a study (I will have to look it up though it was a good read from what I remember) that linked lifespan and general well-being to the diversity and number of nutritional sources.<br />I cannot remember the exact numbers but the Japanese had about 70 or so different sources of nutrition in their weekly diet.&nbsp; Of course a barbeque sauce can have several nutritional sources all in one.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s good for you though and that you should eat plenty of it.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s clearly the fact that their diet and cuisine is much more complex than those of other cultures.<br /><br />So I suggest trying something new.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t like broccoli when you were a kid?&nbsp; Try frying it up (after steam cooking it) with garlic, a little olive oil and a few anchovies (allow them to dissolve in the oil at a very low heat).<br /><br />Mankind has only developed through diversity, you can develop yourself in the same way by eating different foods and maybe learn a thing or two.

Lamarckian inheritance is the rule; Mendelian inheritance is the exception. Thousands of years of eating meat, dairy, seeds, tubers, and leaves instead of fruits and mushrooms, which epigenetically produced our enormous brains in the first place, has caused progressive neural degeneration. The optimal neurochemical environment is one produced by a predominantly fruit/mushroom diet; short of that, supplements can be beneficial at making up the difference. In particular, B1 (sulbutiamine, thiamine HCL), B2, B3 (Niacinamide, Picamilon), B6 (Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate, Pyridoxamine), and B12 (Methylcobalamin - not found in fruit, but produced endogenously by a healthy gut). Multi-gram per day doses of vitamin C are essential; apes (including humans) are nearly unique among animals in being unable to synthesize vitamin C, and must obtain large amounts from the diet. Ascorbate is an essential cofactor in many reactions, most notably collagen, carnitine, and noradrenalin synthesis, and in most animals is produced in the liver under conditions of stress from gluconorate. Most people suffer from &#039;subclinical&#039; scurvy, as the dietary recommendations published by governments are hundreds of times lower than the requirements for optimal health. <br />Also important is to avoid unsaturated fats, which are potent inhibitors of a variety of essential metabolic functions, including aerobic respiration and proteolysis. When using oil for cooking, use only coconut oil, cocoa butter, or mango butter (or butter or ghee, if you&#039;re into that). Short chain saturated fats can immediately be metabolized aerobically, like sugar, without needing to be transported into mitochondria by carnitine. Avoiding unsaturated fats will substantially decrease the oxidative stress produced by your metabolism, as lipid peroxidation products comprise the major source of oxidative damage in cells. <br /><br />I&#039;ve posted a fair deal about these on my product and review threads, which are in my signature. Start with the newest posts and read backwards.

				Holy cow what a post about nutrition.&nbsp; Not sure I understand or agree with it all though.&nbsp; I thought the paleo type diet - i.e. meat / veg / salad was the best?&nbsp; Plus basic vitamin C + B / general multi-vitamin type thing?<br /><br />I heard that vitamin B before and after a meth trip is a good idea too.<br /><br />I thought we evolved to eat only meat and vegetables and a small amount of fruit though, and that sugar (even in fruit) makes us fat?&nbsp; What&#039;s the best type diet to lose fat and / or put on muscle?&nbsp; I.e fruit makes the body think it&#039;s the end of spring so it thinks it needs to stack on fat for the &#039;coming winter&#039; rather than burn fat.<br /><br />As for fats... you mean like animal fats like beef etc?&nbsp; What about plant fats like avocado or coconut?&nbsp; Olive oil?<br /><br />I felt like a million dollars when I was eating pure paleo - just meat and LOTS of salad and veg, but carbs don&#039;t seem to make me feel &#039;great&#039;... I&#039;m a bit confused about it all.&nbsp; I really thought the paleo diet was the way to go (if balanced with heaps of veg and salad).&nbsp; On the other hand some say you need some carbs in your diet to put on muscle or avoid losing muscle, like have protein with carbs so the body can use the protein.<br /><br />Can you put on muscle while using stimulants like meth?&nbsp; Any ideas on how to to avoid fat gain after coming off meth?

				Vitamineral Green -- can&#039;t recommend it highly enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is as good as it gets when it comes to dietary supplements, but in fact it&#039;s not a supplement, it&#039;s actual food.&nbsp; It is not toxic in any quantity.&nbsp; It&#039;s all organic.&nbsp; I could go on and on but you should research it yourself.<br /><br />Aside from that, make your diet consist of FRUITS, VEGETABLES, MUSHROOMS, LEGUMES, LEAFY GREENS, and other vegetables.&nbsp; Keep grains, dairy, and meats to a minimum.&nbsp; It&#039;s not easy to do at first, but make this your goal.&nbsp; BTW - fuck the paleo diet.&nbsp; It is a crock of shit.&nbsp; How you feel does not correlate with what science shows us, which is that all meat is disease causing.&nbsp; Do I eat meat?&nbsp; Yes I do, so I&#039;m not preaching, but I no longer consider meat the essential part of my lunches and dinners.&nbsp; You can get all the protein you need from nuts, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and some grains like quinoa.<br /><br />If you want to take it a step further, start juicing your fruits and vegetables to maximize their nutritional benefit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many vitamins -- particularly multivitamins -- and other supplements have been studied in the past few years and show some cause for concern.&nbsp; These should be researched before consuming.&nbsp;

				Paleo is a crock?&nbsp; I lost a heap of weight and felt SO much better.&nbsp; Maybe it was just getting of wheat and grassy type foods which I do think are toxic to humans - sure was to me anyway.&nbsp; Dairy just sounds wrong - it&#039;s for cows not humans.<br /><br />So I&#039;m not sure why the paleo thing is so &#039;wrong&#039; when it&#039;s just about eating basic foods with lots of vegetabls and salads, but not so much fruit.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t eating a lot of fruit, being rich in sugar, trigger the body to put on fat?&nbsp; Or is that also needed to put on muscle?

				Paleo is not bad short term, it&#039;s bad long term.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I say it&#039;s a crock.&nbsp; If you plan to only live to 35, Paleo diet is fine ;)<br /><br />Sugars are in both fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; Certain fruits are very high in sugars, for example grapes.&nbsp; But fruits and vegetables are both are very high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.&nbsp; http://www.health-alternatives.com/fruit-nutrition-chart.html<br /><br />For example, one medium avocado contains :<br />4.02 grams of protein<br />322 calories<br />13.5 grams of fiber<br />Potassium - 975 mg<br />Phosphorus - 105 mg<br />Magnesium - 58 mg<br />Calcium - 24 mg<br />Sodium - 14 mg<br />Iron - 1.11 mg<br />Selenium 0.8 mcg<br />Manganese - 0.285 mg<br />Copper - 0.382 mg<br />Zinc - 1.29 mg<br />Vitamin A - 293 IU<br />Vitamin C - 20.1 mg<br />Vitamin B1 (thiamine) - 0.135 mg<br />Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) - 0.261 mg<br />Niacin - 3.493 mg<br />Folate - 163 mcg<br />Pantothenic Acid - 2.792 mg<br />Vitamin B6 - .517 mg<br />Vitamin E - 4.16 mg<br />Vitamin K - 42.2 mcg<br /><br />Leafy greens are really important, so the Paleo diet does get that part right.&nbsp; Kale, Broccoli, Spinach, Arugula are some of the so-called &#039;super-foods&#039; one should try to eat as often as possible.<br /><br />This is a bit of a digression, because certain supplements can certainly be helpful in harm reduction for specific drug use.&nbsp; For example, a Vitamin E supplement might not be a bad idea if you&#039;re a coke user.&nbsp; But don&#039;t go overboard with supplements.&nbsp; And again, Vitamineral Green is good stuff.&nbsp; I have friends who work as nutrition specialists so my knowledge comes from them mainly, not an expert by any means, but they regard that as the best of the best when it comes to dietary supplements.&nbsp; The company that makes it also makes some other good stuff for different purposes;&nbsp; Vitamineral Green is just a general balanced health food.<br />

				A paleo diet?&nbsp; Ok.. why not I suppose.&nbsp; I highly doubt wheat is toxic.&nbsp; Italians regularly eat pasta which is just flour and water.&nbsp; Their life expectancy rates pretty high!<br /><br />In any case, I wouldn&#039;t get too &quot;scientific&quot; about your diet and would only add supplements during periods where you know you&#039;re not getting enough of everything.&nbsp; Just try to eat local seasonal foods, and add in some exotic foods to diversify.<br /><br />Masanobu Fukuoka, the precursor to permaculture only ate what was available around his farm in the mountains each season.&nbsp; He also added all those different wild herbs that most people don&#039;t know how to use to his diet.&nbsp; He lived and worked on his farm in the mountains until the age of 95.&nbsp; He seemed VERY happy as well.&nbsp; I would like to be as happy as that guy was.<br /><br /><br />On a further note, we&#039;re trying to limit the harm of drugs through a better diet however if we don&#039;t eat foods devoid of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, trust me the effort is worthless.<br /><br />There are more trace chemicals in your food than your body can probably withstand in the long run.&nbsp; Regulatory agencies are currently relying on extremely unscientific methods of determining the daily dose without it being toxic.<br />Biological/Natural agriculture is not just good for the planet, its first objective is to be good for the human being.&nbsp; It&#039;s not supposed to be &quot;better&quot; it should be the &quot;standard&quot;.&nbsp; Unfortunately we get poisoned every day in order to thicken other people&#039;s wallets.&nbsp; Farmers themselves don&#039;t even get anything out of it.&nbsp; You can tell as GM seeds have been selling less and less.&nbsp; Hopefully they might realize one day that all the chemicals they buy are useless compared to nature&#039;s inherent genius.<br /><br />There was a great documentary on the subject but sadly it is only available in french and german.&nbsp; Maybe I can track down an english version I would be more than glad to share it. <br /><br />And yes these chemicals are way more toxic than mdma for example.&nbsp; Ooooh if you take 100mg doses of mdma too often it&#039;s &quot;neurotoxic&quot;.&nbsp; Pesticides can kill you quicker at much lower doses.<br /><br />Take care people.

				Wheat appears in some ways to be uniquely toxic, but seeds (especially seeds of monocot plants) in general are not suitable foods for humans. The plant does not want you to eat them, and unless an animal has specific adaptations to detoxify them (which we do not), they are deleterious to health. <br />Seeds are are high in starch and/or polyunsaturated fats, low in fiber, vitamins, phytochemicals. They cannot support the energy demands of a maximally functioning human brain. Sugars are the best source of energy for our bodies, and especially our brains. The fiber in fruits mitigates spikes in blood sugar; in contrast, the continuous release of glucose by starch in our blood produces insulin resistance (and obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome). If you do not eat sugars, your body will produce them (or their catabolites, like oxoglutarate) from proteins and fats; you&#039;re not getting ahead by avoiding them, only forcing your body to take a roundabout way in producing them. <br />All large-brained primates subsist primarily on fruit, which is the only source of food that can provide the energy and neurochemical environment needed to maintain the operation of enormous primate brains. That humans today cannot employ the full power of their brains (except during limited &#039;peak experiences&#039;) is in large part related to their grossly inadequate diets, which keep them alive for a few decades but prevent them from realizing their true potential. <br />Most modern domesticated fruits are higher in sugar and lower in protein, vitamins, and phytochemicals than wild fruits (although some fruits, like apricots, contain a decent amount of protein). Mushrooms are mainly protein, and can be used to make up the difference. <br />With a diet and lifestyle that allows your brain to produce a high level of energy, the increased energy demands produced by stimulants and psychedelics can become a stimulus for growth and development, instead of producing &#039;burn-out&#039; (or even neurotoxicity) as when energy supplies are insufficient.
