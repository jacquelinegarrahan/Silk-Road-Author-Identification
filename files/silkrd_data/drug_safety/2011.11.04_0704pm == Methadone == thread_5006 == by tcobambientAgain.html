				OK.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heroin.&nbsp; I&#039;ve shot Dilaudid before and it was amazing.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m curious about methadone.&nbsp; It seems like it would be a good high and I understand it&#039;s not like other opiates, that it takes some time to hit you so you have to wait it out and don&#039;t take a dose over again.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking just snorting a small amount or mixing it with whatever it is you mix it with to drink it.&nbsp; Again a small amount just to get a nice buzz.&nbsp; If I&#039;m smart about it what are some thoughts from people who&#039;ve done it in the past?&nbsp; And what is a good amount to use to get a happy buzz and not the nods.&nbsp;

				If you don&#039;t have a tolerance to opiate I find methadone to have a very nice buzz to it.&nbsp; Before I had a tolerance to anything I was getting the wafers which are 40mg pills.&nbsp; I would take about 30mg of it and have a great buzz which lasted all day although it took about an hour and a half to come on.&nbsp; I think eating the methadone is you&#039;re best bet man honestly.&nbsp; If you are getting pills just swallow whole, powder just parachute, if its the juice just knock it back like a shot of vodka, refill the glass with water and repeat to make sure you got it all out.<br /><br />I remember thanksgiving day years back I took a wafer and a half 60mg and it was horrible.&nbsp; I was so sick/queazy&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t keep any food down at all.&nbsp; But that was kinda cool I guess...I would eat wait 20min puke eat again repeat.&nbsp; I probably had 8meals that day, my dad was like how the hell are you eating so much? Haha if only he knew...&nbsp; anyway bro be safe don&#039;t do too much and remember you can always do more you cant go backwards...<br /><br />Peace<br />bupebuddy

				Cool.&nbsp; Thanks for the info.&nbsp; It&#039;s the powder form.&nbsp; I think I&quot;ll check it out.&nbsp; Seems like a better/cheaper buzz than pills.&nbsp;

				Hell yea bud do it up!&nbsp; Just be careful it is strong.&nbsp; Kind of mellow with decent euphoria, nothing like the speedyness of oxy or vicodin.&nbsp; I would closer compare it to morphine or H but still not exactly like either of those either.&nbsp; Have fun!<br /><br />Peace<br />bupebuddy

				I just need to find out the correct amount to use of powder.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really understand the whole Gram thing (ugly, stupid American) so I need to do some research.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll parachute it at first.&nbsp; Seems the safest.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				methadone&#039;s boring...unless you&#039;re sick, or strung out, and trying to get off the shit, then it&#039;s useful, but as a buzz, never did nothing for me, and that shit is seriously addictive...wanna have fun, eat some pills, wanna have fun, dangerously, shoot up some h...but methadone...nah...

				I had read that it&#039;s just a long term buzz.&nbsp; Not hardcore but just a steady kind of opiate haze.&nbsp; I&#039;d try H if I had the balls and pills are so just so expensive.&nbsp; Just thought I&#039;d try something else out.&nbsp;

				I use methadone recreationally regularly. I have a solid job that requires me to be &#039;with it&#039; and so far it has provided the perfect mix of being high and being able to function. my &#039;better half&#039; also uses it, at the same rate i do and loves it just the same. we buy it every other week and use for about 9 days and then take a break until it&#039;s time to re-up. <br /><br />it took a month or 2 to figure out the right dose for us, but we stick with 20mg per day in the morning and that&#039;s it. sometimes to make it last, we just do 10mg, and because of the long half-life and the lasting effects from the day before, it&#039;s enough to keep us going. <br /><br />MY WARNING: i got my stuff from a friend that had been on a maintenance program for a long time. he takes a ton, everyday. my first couple weeks i was taking 30 mg. i couldn&#039;t keep my eyes open while driving at night, i would fall asleep smoking cigarettes outside.... then someone recorded me while i slept, and we realized it was giving me apnea (i would stop breathing in my sleep for 30-60 secs, then gasp for air, then do it again, ect... ). It was quite the reality check, and caused me to lower my dose and be happy with it. afaik these results aren&#039;t typical, but methadone isn&#039;t a weak drug. it gets people off heroin, it&#039;s used for pain control because of it&#039;s longevity, and recreationally it provides a great bang for the buck. just be careful, because it&#039;s easy to underestimate its potency, and (to put it in layman&#039;s) it blocks your ability to get high on other opioids for up to 72 hours, which causes a lot of addicts to OD (they try to &#039;break thru&#039; the &#039;block&#039; by taking lots of dope)...<br /><br />just my thoughts and opinions, good luck!

				Cool.&nbsp; I&#039;ll take your advice and start off with 20mg and see how things go.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks.
