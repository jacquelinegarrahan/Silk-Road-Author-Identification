				Hello guys/gals. My only experience with MDVP is with the old bath salts. Ivory and&nbsp; radiance&nbsp; etc.etc and I just&nbsp; placed an order for some MDVP and was hoping someone could tell me what is best to cut this with and what the&nbsp; &nbsp;percentage of each should be for a good batch. Trying to get the most bang for my buck. or do you all just recommend toting it&nbsp; as is?&nbsp; &nbsp;My apologizes if this is a stupid question but I figure since it&#039;s our health and lives on the pine it&#039;s probably best&nbsp; to ask any question even one that might be stupid and get a few chuckles pointed at you. <br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks in advance everyone.&nbsp;

				Hey there..<br />Not being smart, but it&#039;s MDPV! :)<br />I love the stuff, personally. Never used bath salts, just use it pure.&nbsp; Most reports I&#039;ve read suggest a starting dose of 5-10mg, so my best piece of advice is to invest in a set of milligram scales and start low and figure out what your dose is! :) I inject it, and after a years abuse of the chemical, still only ever do about 15mg at a time.&nbsp; Try not to keep dosing over and over again, you will go psychotic eventually.<br />I promise!<br />Hope this helps a little.<br />Research, research and research some more!<br /><br />Stay safe.<br />FB

				What were you considering to cut it with? The only reason i could understand for cutting is if you were selling. But, for personal use i don&#039;t see the point in cutting. To those that are going to call me an asshole for thinking cutting is a good idea for mdpv. If it saved someone&#039;s life because they thought they was a boss. I think it serves it&#039;s purpose to cut. There is always gonna be that one person. No matter how many times you say this shit is strong, don&#039;t do much. They will do the biggest line they can. So, with that thought. Cutting the product may save that one person&#039;s life. But, i wouldn&#039;t cut with anything that would be bad for you. And i sure wouldn&#039;t cut it with another stimulant. <br /><br />The only time i think you should cut is for safety not for profit gain.
