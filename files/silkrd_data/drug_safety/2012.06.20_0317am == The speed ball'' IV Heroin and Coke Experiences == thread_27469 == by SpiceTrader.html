				Anyone had any experience with the speed ball? Did you mix the two together and IV at the same time, or separately ? Or any other ROA&#039;s of the combination that are advisable??

				There have been studies done that found the opiate seems to potentiate the cocaine, especially the cardiovascular effects of the cocaine. So it would seem that the biggest risk would be a cocaine overdose. So if one were to try it I would suggest trying a fairly low cocaine dose.

				you should never mix an upper and a downer. if you mix a drug that raises your heart rate, while the other lowers it, then you are at the risk of tachycardia or arrhythmia. Both of these can lead to cardiac arrest and death. Imagine gasping for air until you die, and then re think a speedball. Keep your uppers and downers seperate, and your heart will thank you for it later.

				I&#039;ve never IV&#039;d anything myself. I&#039;ve had IV drugs in the hospital (one of those times I had a pik line into the ventricle of my heart and had IV Hydromorphone). However... I got adventurous one night and bought some Cocaine and Buprenorphine. I took 16 mgs of bupe then did lines of coke with my friends all night... Good times... I guess you cant call that a speedball but I figure it&#039;s as close as I&#039;ll get.

If you don&#039;t have heart problems(i would hope not if you are doing speed in the first place), then try a hit or two and see how that works. It is 50/50 with me when i try that to help me come down. i either have a panic attack, or actually help myself fall to sleep. You can go on blue-light and research peoples reaction to it. It is all based on the individual, so if you don&#039;t mind risking a panic attack then go for it.&nbsp; Wait till you come down though, because weed does raise blood pressure, and that is the last thing you need on amphetamines.
