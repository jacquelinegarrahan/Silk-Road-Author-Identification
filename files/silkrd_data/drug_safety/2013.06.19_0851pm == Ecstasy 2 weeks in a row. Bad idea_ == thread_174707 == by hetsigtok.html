				I got my white Nintendo&#039;s four weeks ago and last week I couldnt resist anymore, I had to test try em out so I took one. I was gonna save the high for tomorrow since a good friend is gonna come and visit and we were planning on rolling. It was around 8 days ago I took 1 pill (200mgish). Would it be a bad idea to roll tomorrow as well before taking a break?

				I think it&#039;s best to leave some time in between rolls, specially when you are taking rather high doses like 200mg, so personally I wouldn&#039;t do it.<br />It won&#039;t kill you but I it won&#039;t have a positive impact on your brain and serotonin system either. <br /><br />But if you don&#039;t care about feeling a bit down the next week, go ahead and have a good time with your friend. It&#039;s up to you.

				Doesn&#039;t it DRAIN serotonin system ? If so I think it wouldn&#039;t feel as good the next day and so on.

Last week when I took the Nintenodo&#039;s I was feeling a little down the day after but after that it was all fine. You think its possible that I could have a comedown for a week? That doesn&#039;t sound worth it :/<br /><br />

				Most people will tell you it&#039;s a bad idea, it will be a better experience to space out probably but if it&#039;s once doing this so close together there may not be that much harm in it I suppose<br />take a significant break after it if you do so I&#039;d say.<br />

				Hey, you should be fine with a 9 day gap as long as you don&#039;t do this all the time.<br /><br />It&#039;s much better to leave a month or so between MDMA hits for health and tolerance reasons, but if you&#039;re reasonably healthy I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be fine as a one off.<br /><br />Enjoy.

				like everyone else has said, time is best between to maximize potential.&nbsp; when i started on the road i abused mdma really bad.&nbsp; im very healthy however, but it still kills your body.&nbsp; i pre and post load, and it really helps but for awhile i had a goldfish memory.&nbsp; also i could not eat, since serotonin screws with your eating.&nbsp; it wasnt awful, but i would not recommend rolling as much as i did.&nbsp; i would say just go ahead and roll, and then take a nice break to be safe.&nbsp; i mean people at music fests are doing it like 4 days in a row...and their still rolling.&nbsp; my perception of this idea to this question is i love MDMA, but i want to keep it special, and just exclamation point all night long instead of sorta roll and then have a bad hangover.&nbsp; my two bitcents.&nbsp; MDMA is a powerful and amazing drug, but it needs to be respected, or you can possibly lose your ability to roll, and destroy your serotonin system.

				Two weeks is not ideal but it won&#039;t hurt you as long as you don&#039;t do it regularly.
