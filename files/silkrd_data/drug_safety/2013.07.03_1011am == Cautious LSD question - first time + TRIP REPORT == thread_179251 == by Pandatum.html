				Hey people. :)<br /><br />A friend and I have five 150 microgram (seller&#039;s description) &quot;Gandalf Complex Print&quot; blotters.&nbsp; Apparently they&#039;re Avengers-tested.&nbsp; The seller is reputable.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done LSD once before, but it was from EnterTheMatrix&#039;s weak stuff he marketed as 100ug.&nbsp; I got no visuals (some colours seem brighter), but it wasn&#039;t a terrible experience, kind of therapeutic--whatever it was!&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it was a placebo, there was something in it.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve read a few threads here and most recommend starting with 100-150ug, and describe it as colours changing, patterns, textures shifting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve experienced that on MDMA, however, and I&#039;d like a bit more.&nbsp; My friend has done MDMA but no psychedelics.<br /><br />Would it be way too much if we did 2 blotters each?&nbsp; Or even...&nbsp; 2 and a half?&nbsp; Are we being dumb? And how long would the trip last if we did that?&nbsp; Keep in mind we don&#039;t have a sitter--are we likely to freak out or panic?&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;re pretty stable, good health, no mental illness.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done coke, MDMA and pot.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a bad &#039;trip&#039; on legal highs where I&#039;ve had waves of nausea and overwhelming sensation hit me for a good few hours, but I was good at calming myself down and knowing it will pass.<br /><br />My idea for setting:<br /><br />-A good music video selection playing on the HD TV (also have youtube if we can operate the computer)<br />-A good music selection available for playing if we get bored of the music vids<br />-Water bottles, juice, soft fruit available<br />-Some signs on the wall to remind us we&#039;re tripping (if we can read ok when tripping?)<br />-Is it worth going outside for a walk?&nbsp; How about at night (the area is well lit, no crime)&nbsp; Or should we lock the doors and make sure to stay in, for this first trip?<br />-Soft lights,maybe glow sticks<br />-Putting away any dangerous or sharp objects<br /><br />Questions about taking the blotter:&nbsp; How do we do it?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard:<br />-Put it on your tongue (how long for?&nbsp; And do you swallow saliva as it builds?)<br />-Just swallow it, like a tab or cap<br />-Put it on your gums, behind your upper lip (this doesn&#039;t sound healthy...&nbsp; again, how long for?)<br /><br />I think that&#039;s it...&nbsp; so, opinions?<br /><br /><br />Edit: Trip report on second page

				It sounds like you are well prepared so chances are all will go well.<br /><br />With your experience, this being the second time and first (hopefully) serious experience, I would go with two of the blotters. Unless the blotters are weaker than advertized two should get you seriously tripping.<br /><br />If you put them under the tongue for 10-20 mins they will be absorbed quicker than if you just swallow them - but it will work both ways. Saliva (and the half dissolved tabs) should be swallowed too. <br />If you are worried the dealer may be crooked and have sold you something else instead of LSD you can choose to just swallow the tabs. Most RC don&#039;t work when swallowed but LSD does.<br /><br />Going out will probably be fine once you are beyond peak ( typically the peak is from 1 hour after taking tabs to 4 hours after - after which the intensity of the experience starts to wane)

				Thanks for the reply, busta999 :)<br /><br />Yeah,I was thinking two blotters too-300 micrograms.&nbsp; That sounds like a good first time, 375 is probably way too much.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep the fifth blotter, maybe for a candy flip down the line.<br /><br />I&#039;ll do whatyou suggest, keep the blotters under the tongue.&nbsp; That sounds pretty good.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re legit, the seller has a pretty good reputation.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep going outside as an option, play it by ear.&nbsp; Seriously looking forward to this, I want to see what my mind will come up with, and it&#039;s great to be able to do it with a trusted friend.<br /><br />Thanks again!&nbsp; I&#039;ll post a full trip report after, that&#039;s half the fun :D

				Hope you have a good ride 8) and all should go well seeing how prepared u are.<br />I usually just let the trip dissolve in my mouth then just wait for it to kick in. I put 1 in a cup of tea once, that worked brilliantly. <br />Like busta999 said start with 2, that should give u the experience your after 8) <br />Will look forward to reading your report :D

				1-2 blotters at 150mcg each is a decent starting dose. I personally would start with one just because its your first time with any psychedelic. You mentioned you had some freakouts on legal highs, I&#039;m going to guess spice/synthetic cannabinoids, which IMO causes way more anxiety than any psychedelics. Psychedelics cause some intense emotions which could be overpowering but don&#039;t tend to cause that overwhelming physical &quot;I know I&#039;m going to die and its not in my head&quot; that AM-2201 or 5-FUR-144 overdoses can cause (ie: spice blends, k2, ect). If you can handle a massive noid overdose you can handle any bad trip.

				knowing what i know now, i would do at minimum 200 UG.. but everybody&#039;s different, so there is no exact answer. as long as you&#039;re in a safe environment, you should be okay with 300UG.

				Wow, what did infowars post (without going into details of course)?&nbsp; Should I be concerned?&nbsp; Also thanks to the mods for deleting a bad post quickly, whatever it was.<br /><br />Thanks for all the awesome advice, folks :) Yeah, 300 is pretty strong...&nbsp; but I do want a pretty strong trip.&nbsp; Hopefully I haven&#039;t bitten off more than I can chew but I think it&#039;ll be ok.<br /><br />Heh, I&#039;m printing off those signs right now--for whatever that&#039;s worth!<br /><br />As I said, I&#039;ll let you know how it goes&nbsp; 8)

				stagger your doses if your going to take more than 1 hit.&nbsp; Drop, wait to drop again&nbsp; before or after your 1st peak. but dropping 2 hits of 150 mic isnt uncommon, done several times myself.<br />I perfer to focus on the quality of the trip, rather than the quantity tho<br /><br />And you can do anything with the blotter you&#039;d like, swallow it, under. over the tonge, chew it whatever. you can even just hold it in yer hand and the L will go subdermal.

				Be ready because 300ug for someones first time can be a life changer and/or a spiritual event even if it&#039;s your second time with LSD. You may need to get educated about ego death and 8-12 hours of tripping<br /><br />I agree mcrad it&#039;s really great to be out thumping around and come up on some unexpected acid

				I personally always recommend people to get accustomed to psychedelic states of mind with mushrooms before trying LSD.<br /><br />Also LSD can make it hard to just sit in the same room the whole time.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s your thing but I would try it at a psychedelic trance party at a nice location.<br />For me, LSD is not a take at home drug.&nbsp; That&#039;s just me and my friends though!&nbsp; I only take it twice a year max.<br /><br />Finally, you don&#039;t have to take a whole tab each, for a first time on LSD half or a quarter tab can be more than enough.&nbsp; It&#039;s never a certainty though!&nbsp; I&#039;ve met a guy who could ingest several tabs with no effect, even a lot of mushrooms to no avail he even tried mescaline... no game :(<br />I can&#039;t remember if he said he was able to trip before or not but he was definitely quite sad that his friends could have these experiences and he couldn&#039;t.<br />I&#039;ve also met a guy who would take seven tabs or so.&nbsp; He was a bit of a nutcase but quite funny and cool.<br />Then you have me and my mates, we&#039;re still hesitating on taking an entire tab after years of psychedelic experimentation.<br /><br />You have to find what you&#039;ll be comfortable with (in terms of setting and dosage), I recommend taking it slow.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is just my opinion and experience of course, the chances that yours will be different are high.

				Going outside is always good. Acid in a room is one thing, acid in the big wide wonder world another. Many times been sat in a room tripping with people who have dug themselves into a bad trip and me and my mate (who love acid and always found it very euphoric) have been like &quot;come outside and LOOK at this shit!&quot;&nbsp; The world will glow and you will realise how incredible it is to be alive. And trees, one way I can always tell a psychedelic is kicking in is the trees. They look different.....like the solar powered oxygen generators they are.<br /><br />Fuck tripping in a room. Somewhere like a beach or mountains is always going to be more enjoyable. Obviously take safety precautions. But for be the best trips have always been outdoors. Shit, not had any acid for years you&#039;re making me all nostalgic and shit.

				Sorry for the very long delay, but it took me a while to put it all into words.<br /><br />====TRIP REPORT====<br /><br />Well. I&#039;ll be damned.<br /><br />Lysergic acid diethylamide. What a fucking ride.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just had one of the most amazing experiences of my life, over seven hours. Seven hours of good trip, bad trip, controlling the universe in my head and being a slave to my own insecurities.&nbsp; Fucking LSD.<br /><br />Let me begin, as many tales do, at the beginning.&nbsp; I will recap the information previously discussed here, so bear with me.<br /><br />====PREPARATION====<br /><br />I&#039;d purchased five 150 microgram LSD blotters from Dimitry, who I&#039;d narrowed down to be the best choice for Albert Hoffman&#039;s miracle chemical.&nbsp; The blotters had a print of Gandalf on the back; this, in retrospect, is both a promise and a warning.<br /><br />His delivery was immaculate and his stealth was solid, especially for a domestic express delivery.<br /><br />I&#039;d decided to take the trip with my trusted friend, who we&#039;ll call Wolfman (you&#039;ll find out why).&nbsp; I&#039;d never done full-strength LSD before, although I&#039;ve done coke, MDMA and cannabis as well as multiple legal highs.&nbsp; One of those legal highs (herbal ecstasy) had given me the worst trip of my life, or so I&#039;d thought.&nbsp; Waves of nausea and uncontrollable waves of sensation that lasted for several hours.<br /><br />Wolfman had never taken any psychedelics, although he was experienced with MDMA and cannabis. We are both fairly stable guys, no history of mental illness, and had read up on the effects and made a choice to take 2 blotters for the first trip, totalling 300 micrograms.&nbsp; We took the blotters at 7:00PM, then sat back and watched a music video playlist I&#039;d put together featuring a cross-section of music genres to see what we would like.<br /><br />We expected the first session to be strong.&nbsp; We wanted to experience a strong trip without it being strong enough to achieve ego-death or anything heavy like that.&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;m not too keen on experiencing ego-death (my attitude may change in future).&nbsp; We considered taking a light dose but we wanted the full experience on the first try.<br /><br />I prepared my place and removed most dangerous objects.&nbsp; Then I met Wolfman out and unfortunately he was quite hungry, so I joined him in having a light meal (against my better judgement).&nbsp; After that we sat down on comfortable seats and watched a few episodes of funny TV shows to relax.<br /><br />Around 7:00PM, we took the blotters.<br /><br />====DOSE====<br /><br />2 blotters of 150 micrograms per person, totalling 300 micrograms.<br /><br />====7:30PM====<br /><br />I start feeling the familiar physical effects of getting high, similar to MDMA.&nbsp; Clammy hands, tingling and building excitement in my stomach, slight increase in heartbeat.&nbsp; Wolfman is always slower in feeling the effects so he feels something, but is unsure.&nbsp; He suggests taking an extra blotter but I nix the idea, knowing from reading up on the subject that this is quite a common error.<br /><br />====7:45PM====<br /><br />It&#039;s hitting me.&nbsp; The colours of the music videos playing on my TV are changing and the movement of the people on the screen are staggered, slightly choppy, as if there was a bad frame-rate.&nbsp; Wolfman is starting to feel it too.&nbsp; We can&#039;t stop grinning and laughing at nothing in particular, then laughing at the fact that we&#039;re laughing.&nbsp; At this stage it&#039;s quite a happy drug.<br /><br />====8:00PM ONWARDS====<br /><br />We largely lost track of time from this point.<br /><br />The full effects are starting to hit.&nbsp; I first notice when I look up at the ceiling, which is strongly textured.&nbsp; The texture starts to swim, as if there&#039;s a foreground and background to it, and patterns emerge.&nbsp; I tell Wolfman to look as well and he sees it immediately.&nbsp; We stare up at the ceiling, occasionally laughing at the fact that we&#039;re staring at a ceiling.<br /><br />We look back at the TV.&nbsp; Wolfman had reminded me to put some MGMT on the playlist, and I&#039;d put some Marilyn Manson on there as well.&nbsp; MGMT comes on and we&#039;re in shock&#039;these music videos were excellent sober, but suddenly we realise that they&#039;re meant to be viewed on LSD.&nbsp; MGMT&#039;s &#039;Kids&#039; was especially brilliant.&nbsp; Oddly, although these videos had twisted, monstrous imagery, we felt almost comforted by them and quite happy to appreciate their artistry.&nbsp; We are also aware that we&#039;re very much open to suggestion in this state, and that we&#039;re watching music videos and listening to songs intentionally created for LSD--that watching them meant that we are subjected to the artist&#039;s own interpretations, insecurities and neuroses.&nbsp; I think that awareness protected us somewhat as well.&nbsp; The revelation that these artists had painted their art using LSD (so to speak) was mind-blowing for us, especially as we love good music.<br /><br />The visuals are getting more and more intense; the colours on the TV are spectacular.&nbsp; The swirling textures on the walls and ceiling have taken over almost completely.&nbsp; I look at them and see patterns of skulls, strange creatures from the Lovecraftian Mythos and stags, beautiful beasts with antlers patterned over the texture.<br /><br />I suggest a walk outside but immediately say no to my own idea, feeling not ready for it.&nbsp; Wolfman is nice enough to not press the issue, although we both discuss it.&nbsp; I feel very slightly anxious about going outside, but I know it would be amazing as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s difficult to think and stay on topic during conversation, especially to remember what you were thinking or saying, or about to do.&nbsp; It takes at least ten minutes of trying and laughing to finally get to the kitchen (right next to us, hehe) and open the bottle of fruit juice.&nbsp; We both stand there watching it being poured, and realise that the level of the fruit juice was changing constantly, making it difficult.&nbsp; I suddenly announced that I may have spilled some and we both stepped away, seeing the spill on the kitchen bench-top...&nbsp; only to realise, when I reached out to touch it, that it was bone dry and I hadn&#039;t spilled a drop.<br /><br />We both burst out laughing at this.&nbsp; I&#039;m chuckling even writing about it!<br /><br />The fruit juice was heavenly.&nbsp; Cold and sweet and amazing, it went down very well.&nbsp; Water was ok too, but juice really hit the spot.<br /><br />After a while I suddenly had an idea: complete immersion in darkness.&nbsp; Wolfman was up for it, so we went to another room and shut the door, closed the heavy curtains and lay on the carpeted floor.&nbsp; What followed was indescribable.&nbsp; First a kaleidoscope of light and imagery, constantly twisting and changing and forming into shapes.&nbsp; And then, for me...<br /><br />I heard it.<br /><br />Get on youtube, search for &#039;sound of the sun&#039;.&nbsp; The first video.&nbsp; That&#039;s an approximation of what I heard, so similar to the recorded emissions of the planets conducted by Voyager 1 and 2 and converted into sound.&nbsp; The deep, throbbing vibration of the Earth, of existence.&nbsp; I HEARD it.&nbsp; And when I thought, the sound altered gently with my thinking.&nbsp; It was as if I could bend reality itself, change the way I think, watch myself thinking, see my own thoughts form and take shape....&nbsp; I felt powerful, disembodied, a mind floating in the darkness of the space between the stars.&nbsp; I felt no fear but an overwhelming exhilaration.<br /><br />Look, I&#039;m not a greatly spiritual person.&nbsp; I know it was the drug, and I knew it then--but I also know that LSD opens up parts of your brain that aren&#039;t usually operating on the conscious wavelength.&nbsp; Others have reported seeing and tasting music, for example.&nbsp; I heard something...&nbsp; those recordings of Voyager picked up the emissions of planets using technology.&nbsp; Perhaps I picked up the emissions of the Earth?&nbsp; It sounds unlikely to my scientific mind.&nbsp; And yet...&nbsp; That sound, oh dear heaven!&nbsp; That sound!<br /><br />After a while, I asked Wolfman how he was doing and we had a chat, there in the darkness, and then, finally, I realised we needed to go out into nature.<br /><br />This is where habit and routine came in handy.&nbsp; Put on warm clothes, make sure I have keys and phone, socks and shoes...&nbsp; it might have been hard to concentrate, but the habit was ingrained.&nbsp; We left my place, locking up carefully behind us, and ventured into the night.<br /><br />I live in suburbia so we didn&#039;t see another soul.&nbsp; We heard people in various houses having parties and so on, but never saw them.&nbsp; The sound of their voices was comforting, but we were glad they weren&#039;t in the street.&nbsp; We reached the main road which was deserted and walked along it was about ten minutes to a nearby park.&nbsp; To me, the streetlights and the road looked like an old oil painting on canvas, mysterious and distant and beautiful.&nbsp; Wolfman said that the road looked like a black river running at our feet.&nbsp; We entered the park.&nbsp; Across the field there was an outdoor reception centre, where music was playing.&nbsp; As I stared at it, it looked to me like a sad, empty circus or amusement park, the carousels going round and round without anyone on them.&nbsp; It was a picturesque sight that the LSD painted and I appreciated it.&nbsp; We sat for a while on a park bench, amidst the trees, and just let it sink in.<br /><br />Unfortunately the anxiety grew again and I wanted to go home.&nbsp; Wolfman was agreeable (and hell, it was cold outside!) so we walked slowly back again, never seeing another person.&nbsp; We got to my place safely, unlocked the door and we were back in the heated, warmly lit familiarity of my living room.<br /><br />After we settled in and watched a few more stunning music videos, we decided to try the darkness immersion again.&nbsp; We went back to the room, shut the door and lay on the floor, in the darkness.&nbsp; I felt very uncomfortable at this point; my stomach ached with the small amount of food in it.&nbsp; The ache started to enter the trip and turn it bad.&nbsp; I enjoyed the darkness immersion, but not as much as the first time.&nbsp; I thought of the people in my life that I cared about and the ones that were no longer in my life, and my mind saw them as colours, feelings and shapes.&nbsp; The absent ones were distant, blue, cold.&nbsp; The ones I loved were different colours, warm, near, shapes that were alive and happy.&nbsp; It revealed certain things to me that I won&#039;t share here, but were somewhat of a revelation.<br /><br />Afterwards we went back to the living room, as the trip had passed the peak, but I became very anxious.&nbsp; I thought I was sweating and stank (in reality I was very comfortable).&nbsp; Because my palms were partly numb from the LSD, I couldn&#039;t properly feel anything.&nbsp; So I went and had a shower (against Wolfman&#039;s better judgement, but he made me leave the door unlocked).&nbsp; I knew I&#039;d be physically all right, but the shower did nothing to help.&nbsp; On one hand I was enjoying the feeling of the water and the way it looked in the light.&nbsp; On the other hand I was almost paranoid about smelling.&nbsp; Because I couldn&#039;t feel properly with my hands, and I knew I was seeing things, I started to lose my grip on reality a little--I couldn&#039;t figure out what was real and what was the LSD.<br /><br />But I didn&#039;t panic or freak out, because I&#039;d done my research and knew I was tripping balls.&nbsp; I dried off, put my clothes back on and joined Wolfman in the living room.&nbsp; He reassured me that I didn&#039;t stink, was quite fresh actually.&nbsp; I still felt uncomfortable and the stomach ache was still getting to me.&nbsp; It was at this point my friend (we&#039;ll call him Doc) got off his nightshift and called me.&nbsp; I invited him over and he was nice enough to do so.&nbsp; For this last part of the trip, he was my point of reference to reality (and he was happy to sip on some whiskey and coke and hang out with us).&nbsp; So he calmed me down and then I started enjoying the rest of the trip.<br /><br />The visuals were heavy but now interspersed with more reality, which was really effective.&nbsp; I sat there looking at Wolfman and watched as he aged, became younger, his hair shortened and lengthened...&nbsp; and he said he was seeing the same thing with me.&nbsp; And this was the moment where I saw his face grow short, sleek brown fur like a wolf, his features become more angular and the bone structure change.&nbsp; He literally looked like a human wolf.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t frightening at all, I remember describing it to them and we were all having a good time with it.&nbsp; Doc was constantly shifting and changing as well and he was intrigued by LSD, so we invited him to try it with us next time (he was too tired for it after work).<br /><br />Around 2 AM the effects were nearly finished.&nbsp; I took another shower and emptied my stomach (the normal way, heh) and felt much better.&nbsp; I felt calm, happy, rested.&nbsp; I did have a headache throughout most of my trip too, so I took some paracetamol.<br /><br />Around 3 AM it was similar to when we first started feeling the effects.<br /><br />At 4AM, the effects were practically gone and I was back at baseline.&nbsp; At the point, I went to sleep and slept until around 9 AM.&nbsp; When I woke I felt fine, visuals were completely gone although I had some interesting dreams.&nbsp; <br /><br />====THOUGHTS====<br /><br />And that, fellow Silk Road psychonauts, was that.<br /><br />Practically, I know how to prepare for the next time:<br /><br />- Empty stomach.&nbsp; I need this.&nbsp; My stomach ache was what gave me a bad trip at the end.&nbsp; For me, LSD and food doesn&#039;t mix.&nbsp; Wolfman didn&#039;t seem to have any problems tripping on food.<br />- Now I know what to put on my playlist, know what I enjoy when tripping.<br />- I&#039;m confident now to let myself go and not check in with my friend all the time.&nbsp; And I&#039;m confident that he won&#039;t have a bad trip either.<br />- Darkness immersion.&nbsp; Hell yeah.<br />- More nature too, but maybe not in my suburb.<br />- Prepare the fruit and drink better.&nbsp; I had difficulty opening the fruit juice for the first time.&nbsp; Maybe put the juice in water bottles.<br />- Buy a cheap voice recorder, we came out with some weird and wonderful stuff.<br />- 300 micrograms is my limit right now.&nbsp; I&#039;m not ready to experience ego death, hehe.<br /><br />I have one thought that struck me the next morning, and I want to share it with you.&nbsp; LSD opens up your mind, and perhaps frees it from the limitations that the physical body and environment places upon it.&nbsp; These limitations are placed on our minds so that we can function in the physical world--so that we can, primitively speaking, hunt for food, not get eaten by predators, find shelter and so on.<br /><br />When I took LSD it felt like I was free of those limitations and I could control my thoughts, control my mind.&nbsp; I could take it wherever I wanted to.<br /><br />...So...&nbsp; Is that what happens when you die?&nbsp; Your mind gets freed.&nbsp; If you die happy, at peace, then your mind creates a &#039;heaven&#039;.&nbsp; If you die without peace, perhaps with guilt, your mind creates &#039;hell&#039;.<br /><br />Is hell a bad trip?<br /><br />Anyway, questions:<br /><br />- The sound I heard, the vibration/energy sound.&nbsp; Is that common?<br />- The shifting of people, ageing and reversing, hair growing and becoming shorter--that&#039;s pretty standard, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Comments, feedback?<br /><br />Thanks for your patience and advice, it&#039;s very appreciated!

Can&#039;t wait for my next flight ;)<br />for the vibration/energy sound, I sometimes get a kind of buzzing and as for the ppl thing I had that a few times to :D strange, but when ur open to it its pretty funny and creepy to watch at the same time ;)<br />Tripping on an empty stomach is definitely recommended, I hope I will be as well prepared as you have been next time I trip :)

				+1 for a very nicely written report. <br />Also very good to see someone embarking on this journey with respect for the molecule and the abysses that exist in the mind. May you have many more great great adventures and insights.
