				I&#039;m thinking about trying opiates for the first time but don&#039;t really know much about them. I don&#039;t really like the idea of IV so I&#039;m looking at prescription shit. I&#039;ve got a few questions about them<br /><br />1. What exactly differentiates an Oxycodone/Oxycontin/Vicodin high? Do they not all do pretty much the same thing?<br />2. How much Vicodin would an opiate noob need to get the full experience? If I ordered http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a3af5bd167 how many would I need to take at once? <br />3. This is more of a subjective thing, but these prices are quite high. Do you guys consider the experience to be worth it?

				There are a variety of opiates available on the market today.<br /><br />Prescription ones are the most commonly used for recreational purposes. The most popular ones are oxycodone (oxycontin, roxicodone, etc...) and hydrocodone (vicodin, lortab, etc...). <br /><br />For a new user 10 mg of hydrocodone will be more than enough to introduce you to opiate affects. For oxycodone I would recommend between 5 and 10 mgs for your first time.<br /><br />Heroin is also very popular but is harder to dose because it is not regulated. I&#039;d save heroin for once you develop a tolerance and are more experienced. Also snorting instead of injecting is a common practice for beginner heroin users.

				1 - the active ingredient in Vicodin is hydrocodone, it&#039;s very similar to oxycodone, but slightly different and not quite as strong per mg.&nbsp; Oxycontin is a pill that releases oxycodone over a prolonged period of time, while roxicodone releases the full amount into your system instantly.&nbsp; Oxycodone is also the active ingredients in percocets.<br /><br />2 - I&#039;d recommend slightly higher amounts than the above poster for a really good high, but the amount he recommended will introduce you to the effects.&nbsp; You can always take another if you like what you&#039;re feeling and want a stronger buzz though.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; The prices are very high - i love opiates, and have a hard time justifying paying them myself.&nbsp; Definitely more of an occasional splurge than even a semi-regular thing.&nbsp; I also know people who have taken vics or percs after getting a script and deciding to try getting a buzz off them and HATING it...calling me after and saying &quot;you LIKE that feeling?&quot; (and luckily, they&#039;d sell me the leftovers dirt cheap!) - so it is very subjective.<br /><br />Also be careful, if you do try it and like it, keep it to occasional use, tolerance and dependence can go up quickly

				Yes be careful when first starting out. Opiates will affect your respiratory system and make it difficult to breathe if you take to much with no tolerance. I agree with 10mg of hydrocodone as a safe starting dose.

				just dont do it, its a door you dont want to open. Seriously man theres a switch and once that switch is pressed theres no turning it off. sure it probably wont happen the first time you try it but its very risky to do any opiates to get high.&nbsp; i strongly recommend you just dont do them. think of all the things you love about your life, then imagine you have none of them.

				Thanks for the responses everyone. You don&#039;t make it sound very attractive, on second thought I think I&#039;ll stay away for now. Honestly I&#039;m just looking to try something new, was interested in ketamine more than anything but kara isn&#039;t taking new customers now and I don&#039;t do international. My favorite psychedelic vendor has been mia for a bit now and I&#039;m not sure if/when they are coming back. I&#039;m afraid if I order from someone else the product won&#039;t be as good/I will expect it to not be as good and I&#039;ll end up in a shitty headspace. Figure if I try something new I&#039;ll have nothing to compare it to. <br /><br />If only netherlands wasn&#039;t such a security risk..

				How do I keep opiates around?<br /><br />I have them from time to time, and I am perfectly capable of staying away from them for a while, but as soon as I take it once, I keep redosing nightly until the entire product has disappeared. On the one hand, it&#039;s good that it&#039;s all good, but now I want more. &gt;.&lt;

				Remember that opiates occur naturally as well.<br />The choice is not only between pills or heroin.

				I would also third that advice and say just stay away from opiates. Addiction really depends on the person...in my case I cant go near uppers cocaine,meth,speed because I get VERY addicted to them and cant control my use whatsoever. Once I get in that frame of mind ill spend all my money and everyone else money that I can get my hands on ...binge until all the shits gone and basically ruin everything I built up to that point job, relationships etc. On the other hand with opiates I can somewhat control my use, still keep a job, and generally function just the same in my daily life while using(sometimes better)...the scary part about opiates is that I know as a fact Ill always be a user ALWAYS. You dont want to fall into either of those scenarios stick to happy drugs weed, lsd, shrooms...I remember the happy days sigh...

				i completely agree. i have lost everything in my life that has meaning to opiates.&nbsp; if you are to try opiates i suggest trying opium. after you try it, never do it again! you will regret it i guarantee. 5 yrs gone.. lost my house, car, friends, ruined relationships with parents, etc... now im in 40,000 in debt because of spending student loans on heroin... not to lecture but its an ugly road
