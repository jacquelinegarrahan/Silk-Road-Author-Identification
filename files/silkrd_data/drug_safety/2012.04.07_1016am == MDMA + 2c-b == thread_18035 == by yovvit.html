				so I&#039;ve got a party coming up, and I was considering mixing these two. Anyone have any experiences with it? I was thinking something along the lines of 100mg MDMA and 20mg 2c-b.<br /><br />I know that 2c-b affects different people in very different ways, so to give you a little bit of insight I had a very fucking intense trip from 25mg. And I&#039;ve never done MDMA.

				If it&#039;s your first time just stick with the MDMA and maybe a benzo for the comedown.<br /><br />I tried 2-cb and MDMA combo once and threw up, wasn&#039;t very enjoyable for me but a lot of people would say otherwise.

				no go for it its a excellent cpombo if done right and wonderfully touchy feely sexy as they come kind of thing!!<br /><br />MAKE SURE THAT YOU DONT HAVE THE 2CB UNTIL AFTER SAY an hour has passed after the eak on the mdma as it will overpower it if not... whereas at the right time it will work with it and turn the key again and unlock even more majik that you didnt know you had ... it will bring the mdma rush back for a few more hours ... for real... but no drive definatley no drive as you are not in a reesponsible manner and will be silly or worse if you dont heed the advice<br /><br /><br />stay safe and enjoy<br /><br />150mg mdma at 11pm and&nbsp; 15mg 2cb at 2.00am nice flight until 7.00 am

				Fucking awesome combo, sex is ridiculous on it.&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />On a similar tip, does anyone have any experience with cross tolerance between the two? I&#039;m was thinking of taking a small (10mg) dose of 2C-B tonight but I&#039;m taking MD tomorrow night and don&#039;t want to have an MD &#039;misfire&#039; as I only take it around once a month.

				I have heard very good things about this combo, my advice however would be to try MDMA on its own first. I would never recommend combining drugs you have never tried before, just my 2 cents though :)

				beltram16 I&#039;ve heard that it&#039;s fine to take them at the same time, but maybe I&#039;ll take your advice. Thanks :-)<br /><br />zubic09 thanks for the advice, I&#039;ll keep it in mind :D
