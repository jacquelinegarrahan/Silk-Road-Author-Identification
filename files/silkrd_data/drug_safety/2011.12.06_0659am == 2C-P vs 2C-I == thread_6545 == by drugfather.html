				I will assume by the emoticon you are aware of how mindfuckingly strong 2c-p is and how steep the dose/response curve is. Since 10mg is a light dose of I, I would probably go with the P and triple check my measurements before dosing.<br />Just check the wiki on the P and then choose<br /><br />Happy trips :)

Hahahaha. I&#039;m scared / excited at the same time.... I&#039;ve tried quite a bunch of things but I&#039;ve heard some things about 2C-P.<br />The list of hallucinogens I&#039;ve done include peyote, psilocibe shrooms, LSD, 25NBOMe, 2C-E, 2C-I, DMT and more but those are the ones I&#039;ve most frequently experienced with..<br /><br />Could you tell me what 2C-P is like?<br /><br />Thanks for the advice!

				You should try 2C-B it&#039;s a nice trip, especially in hot outdoor countries :)<br /><br />Not really one for a gloomy day/night inside in the UK&#039;s winter though!<br /><br />That&#039;s just my opinion, what&#039;s 2C-I like or DMT (Thinking of trying this stuff with my mates).<br /><br />Share your experiences on here if you ever take 2C-p, I would be interested to know ;)

				From my experience, 2cp lasts a lot longer than e or I. Like 12 hours long. Plan accordingly. It&#039;s heavy like e but not as dark, more like brooding. It helps me with critical thinking. And it&#039;s not nearly as visual a drug like 2ci.

				2C-P lasts too fucking long for my taste<br /><br />And its not a good long either ala LSD... it just drags on and on and on<br /><br />It&#039;s dark and brooding like an above poster said...<br /><br />Not really a happy drug IME, more for thinking and pondering

				I forgot to mention, 2cp takes a long time to hit you. 3 or 4 hours if I remember correctly. So please don&#039;t top off if you don&#039;t feel the effects after a couple of hours, it&#039;ll come, just be patience.

				Oh sweet jesus....2c-p is insane. Prepare to lose a full day if you do take it.<br /><br />I have taken it twice and it is the closest thing to mescaline of any of the 2cs. (for better or worse)
