				hey all, hope everyone is doing well. <br /><br />I have a major problem. I am 23 and have been battling with severe anxiety for years now. My doctor who prescribes my anti-depressions basically refuses to give me a dose of alaprozam higher then .5mg because of my past history of opiate abuse (which was when I was younger and careless). Does anyone have any suggestions of what I could do? I&#039;m getting anxiety attacks every day and they sometimes are extremely harsh. It&#039;s taken over my life and I feel I need a higher dose to help me cope.

				Hi. Im the mom of a 23 yr old that has a severe anxiety problem. He has finally stopped popping xanax - it wasnt the answer. It really didnt help him. Smoking pot actually helps more, IF you can limit its use to control symptoms and dont get all unmotivated from it. As far as medications, there is a timed-release version of Klonopin (I think Klonopin XR) that has helped ALOT. Your doc may prescribe this as it is a long-acting version of the anti-anxiety medication. If you suffer from depression too try Seroquel XR - its heavy at first but you get used to it. It conquers depression and that inner anxiety that makes you feel worried all the time. But only you and your doctor know whats best for you. You have to be honest and almost exaggerate your symptoms to get the doctor to take you seriously. If you are suffering, fess up to you parents or your doctor asap.&nbsp; :)

				Find a new doctor. You&#039;ll find one that understands fairly quickly... it&#039;s only xanax. <br /><br />It&#039;s not &#039;doctor shopping&#039; or anything illegal unless you&#039;re actually getting scripts from more than one doctor at once and don&#039;t tell one about the other.

				Hey man, first know this - you are not alone.&nbsp; Other people fighting the same battle you are and we are wishing positive things for your life.&nbsp; Trite maybe but I like people reminding me of that. :)<br /><br />1)&nbsp; .5mg a day is bullshit, I would find another doctor or buy from here if you have to.<br /><br />2)&nbsp; Are you in therapy?&nbsp; Remember the science shows CBT combined with drugs makes the most difference.&nbsp; Drugs alone cannot match drugs + CBT, there is a lot of data proving this.&nbsp; The only thing Freud got right IMO.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; Have you tried to find activities that help like meditation, exercise, etc (singing obnoxiously to music I love can dial me down a notch)?<br /><br />My point is the anxiety game is not about cure it&#039;s about lowering the level.<br /><br />For example if your anxiety is a 10, maybe drugs can get you down to an 8, add in CBT to get down to a 6, then meditation to get to a 5.&nbsp; <br /><br />At a level of 5 then maybe you can get some things done and enjoy life a little.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10525.msg96037#msg96037">Quote from: njdevils on January 30, 2012, 11:24 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">hey all, hope everyone is doing well. <br /><br />I have a major problem.
