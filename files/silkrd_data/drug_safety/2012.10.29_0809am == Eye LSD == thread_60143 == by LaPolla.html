				Has someone tried the eye-method? Is it safe?<br /><br />I&#039;ve done and it boosts it I think about x2 the effects. You cut it into quarters and then put it into your eyelid like contact lens. The shit is when you wake up you have your eyes red as an apple and very inflamed.<br /><br />What are the risks about this practice?

				is that even a serous question??<br /><br />i have never heard of people putting a freaking tab on their eye, that is as mentioned a very bad idea and could permanently damage the eye <br /><br />the only time i have actually heard of it being done is with drops of liquid... and even then i dont know if its safe or even produces any stronger effects

				Also, it is just an incredibly stupid method to administer something that does not give any benefits at all. For the delivery rout it really does not make any difference if you take something under the tongue, up the nose, or in the eye. <br /><br />They eye may in fact be the worst choice, since it has a very strong immune system that will readily attack any foreign substance introduced, including the material the blotter is made of. <br /><br />Contact lenses have an outer layer of fatty acid tails that naturally occur in the body of all humans to deal with this problem. This is the only reason you can wear them for any period of time. If they were just pieces of plastic you&#039;d cry them out quite readily, and if not, the eyes immune system would kick in very quickly to eradicate the foreign substance. <br /><br />This extremely strong immune response is required because we get all kinds of foreign substances in our eyes in everyday life, and an infection of the eye could make its way to the brain quite easily. Luckily very good defense mechanisms evolved to deal with that, otherwise we&#039;d be better off without vision.

Thanks dude.<br /><br />And yes, it&#039;s serious and I&#039;ve tried. It&#039;s not the same to put it on your tongue or between your upper lip and your teeth than if you put it inside your eyelid. Is not an urban legend. I&#039;ve eaten a quarter blotter and tried the eye method and believe me it&#039;s awesome. It&#039;s true that you&#039;re suffering a conjunctivitis for 1 or 2 days.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m curious why the eye would be a more effective route of administration. <br /><br />The only mechanism i can think off is that you may swallow a significant amount of the substance if you place it under the tongue or lip, causing it to be absorbed in the stomach or gut and then processed by the liver before becoming functional. To get a bit of comparison you should probably compare adminstering it nasally, though that seems impractical to accomplish with a blotter. <br /><br />Anyway, no matter if it provides additional potency: do not put foreign substances in your eyes, unless they were developed for that purpose like contact lenses. You could easily develop a serious eye inflammation that is uncomfortable enough to cost you more in pain medication than it saved you on substances... and thats not even mentioning the possibility of permanent damage to the cornea.

				Analyze the risk vs benefit of this method over others and it is a plain stupid idea! I am never going to risk my eye even if I get 10X effect!<br /><br />If someone is trying to find various kinds of administration methods without assessing the risk then this is a possible method and so does though the penis or vagina!

				I wouldn&#039;t put shit in my eye before tripping even if it was 100% safe to do so. How comfortable you are while tripping largely determines your experience, and deliberately giving yourself an uncomfortable eye sounds like a great way to diminish that experience. I&#039;m not saying you&#039;ll have a shit time but I bet it would be better without your eye being irritated. <br /><br />Even if it is twice as good (I guess you&#039;re effectively snorting it) you&#039;d have a better time just double-dropping orally instead.

				I suppose the downside will often present a fair bit later though. Eye irritation can be immediate, but it often takes quite some time to develop into a serious discomfort. <br /><br />I image it would be something like falling asleep with your contact lenses in, discovering that the next morning since your eyes are bloodshot, and then 1000 times worse ;)

				Tab on eye would be intensely stupid.<br />I know people putting liquid acid in their eyes, like eye drops. I personally don&#039;t get it.

				i was speaking more of in general with administration down there,&nbsp; and thinking of H not lsd actually<br /><br />and rectal just seems disgusting though honestly i have tried plugging H as well as shooting, snorting and even nebulizing just out of curiosity about the differences and effectiveness of each. dont have the option for vaginal or im sure i would have tried it too. never have i ever dosed through my eye though - i value my vision too much and know how easy it is to get an amoeba infection that can blind you <br /><br />but comparing to vaginal vs rectal - i would gladly stick my fingers in one of them but definitely not the other :) both supposedly work very well given the blood vessel density <br /><br />one of my most memorable lines of oxy ever was snorting off my gf&#039;s lovely breast lol that was my favorite ROA

				using a nebulizer is not a very common method, but its pretty effective actually due to the high bioavailability<br /><br />nebulizing is where a liquid is turned into an aerosol, or tiny droplets, via high pressure air and then inhaled and absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream. it requires a special machine and you have to completely dissolve the drug in a sterile isotonic solution <br /><br />generally its used for medicine like albuterol when people have asthma attacks. sometimes alcohol is administered this way for the novelty in a few special bars. hospitals are looking into it for effective administration of other things now including opiates and even insulin instead of having to IV <br /><br />i did it because i had the machine from my asthma and was curious - not very many have ever administered their drugs via this method so i wanted to try, you can get very high absorption rates without having to plug or IV. it was knda a hassle because i unplugged the air hose each when i wasnt inhaling to prevent wasting the solution. i only had a sterile albuterol solution to use as well, which kinda gives a stimulated feeling so i am going to try again when i get an sterile saline solution eventually, but i definitely got decent effects and even a mild rush so i want to try again

				Putting a cut up TAB in your EYE? Now thats something I can actually say Ive never heard of before. Liquid in the eye sure, but never a blotter haha. <br /><br />Definitely not a good idea, and definitely not worth it even if the effects really get doubled by some miracle.

				in my stupid adolescence i once took a drop of liquid LSD on my eye. it was not worth the pain i had to go through. the liquid was being stored in one of those minty breath freshener bottles that seemed to still have a little residue left in it. I dont think ive ever felt eye pain so bad before. luckily i didnt seem to do any damage to my eyes. yes i know that was a really dumb thing to do but i was like 14 years old and 14 year olds do stupid shit.

				I suppose packaging them before you do that would be desirable, both for hygiene and unwanted effects if you sweat even the least bit. <br /><br />Absorption through the skin can be quite effective, but it depends greatly on which compound. Opiates can generally be taken dermally, people even reported getting high from just picking poppies with bare hands for a significant period of time.<br /><br />Some compounds pass the skin at amazing rates. One of the most interesting ones is the solvent DMSO. If you spill a drop of that on your hand, you can taste it in a minute or so - not terribly offensive, but it as a very odd taste to it, almost spicy. This mehanism can also be used to help substances get from the skin into the bloodstream if they dissolve well in dmso, although i would not recommend trying to do that, since it will transport any contaminants and/or foreign substances on your skin into your body as well. The solvent itself isn&#039;t very toxic - quite a number of chemistry students try putting a drop on their hand to see if its actually true ;)
