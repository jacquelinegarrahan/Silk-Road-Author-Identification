				Hey,<br /><br />As the title suggests i want to try DMT! tripping is my favorite thing to do and i&#039;ve heard there is nothing like a DMT&nbsp; trip.

				Well from what I&#039;ve read the best option is a vaporizer. Though a lot of people don&#039;t have this, including me. So what I did when I smoked DMT for the first time. Was that I took my bong. (a normal bong used to smoke marijuana). I packed a bit of ash at the bottom of the cup. Pretty tightly since you don&#039;t want any of the good stuff to be wasted. Then I took the dmt and placed that on the packed ashes. After that i put some more ash on top of the dmt and packed it slightly. Not to hard not to loose. After that I tapped the cup a little to mix the dmt in with the ashe. When you&#039;ve done this it&#039;s ready to be smoked. But since you can&#039;t put a direct flame on dmt you have to be careful when lighting the bong. Carefully put the flame to the ash just so the ash starts burning. Inhale slowly DONT RUSH IT! And take a deeeeeeep hit. Hold it in for as long as possible and then drift away into a place of true wonder.<br /><br />Edit: Ow yeah I should add. This was freebase dmt and not changa.

				I used the bong method a well, I would advise a butane torch lighter, they&#039;re cheap enough to get. It allowed for good indirect heat to be applied as a normal lighter is very unpredictable and when you pull the smoke you can pull the flame as well and burn the dmt.

				I just tried it for the first time a month ago using a vaporiser (Extreme Q). <br />Worked quite well - I just put a little weed in the bottom, sprinkled free-based over the top of that, then more weed on top, packed together a little bit, then heat it at about 180deg. <br />Certainly tripped hard, but from reading descriptions I wasn&#039;t able to &quot;break through&quot; in a couple of attempts so I&#039;m definitely interested in others&#039; advice here too. <br /><br />

				I tried it for the first time on Monday of this week and this is how I did it. I packed some weed into my bubbler just enough to cover the hole so that no DMT would fall through. Then I took about 50-60mg and just dropped it on top of the bud in the pipe. After, I took my lighter and while pulling softly, just enough to guide the flame to barely touch the DMT causing it to melt onto the bud which barely gave me a hit but it&#039;s part of the preparation. Once the DMT was melted, NOT BURNED, melted, then I took two big rips, again not applying too much fire but more than before to make sure the DMT wasn&#039;t burning, and as I felt my vision going and a loss of coordination I put full fire to it and I ripped it one last time following the advice of Terence McKenna, and WOW!!!!!!! I broke through into hyperspace!!! ;D<br /><br />A profound experience.

Another way even easier is with a bottle to which you cut the bottom and you made this last out of tinfoil (there are people that say that tinfoil brings various chemicals in the mix, but if you want to just smoke to try once it is perfectly fine, it is very easy to make a vaporizer in this way; you can find the method in youtube, just search for &quot;how to smoke dmt&quot; and you will find it; the guy there talks about various methods to smoke and in the end he explains the bottle trick. For a first time it&#039;s more than enough, after if you like it etc. you can then go preparing better equipment or buy some).<br /><br />The most important thing to remember with DMT is the set and setting, even more than other psychedelics. If you can and you know how meditate half an hour and hour before you do the attempt. In any case for the first times never try to dictate the trip, let the DMT bring you where it wants to. Don&#039;t fight.<br /><br />Remember that vaporizing you need less than smoking in a pipe or similar, for the first trip something like 25-30 mg should be more than enough. I suggest you to don&#039;t smoke DMT with a pipe because you need much more and after the first toke or so it will be difficult to continue keep track of what you are doing. If you can use the afore mentioned methods to vaporize. If however you decide to use a pipe, then put both at the bottom an at the top a tick layer of hash (much better than herbs) and beware to not burn the DMT.<br /><br />Also remember that if something goes wrong (for example you don&#039;t keep the toke enough time inside and exhale too fast so that you cannot &quot;break through&quot;) you have to wait at last 1 hour before trying again, or you just waste what you use.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />EDIT: Here, I found the links for you so you don&#039;t have to go search for them.<br />Vaporizer out of a light-bulb: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhEGp7aD-qA<br />Bottle vaporizer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtckVptu4I4 (it begins at about 4:30)

				The essayist way if you are not failure with vaporization (and it can be tricky) is changa but you need to look into MAOIs as they react with almost everything and can be lethal (even normal foods). <br /><br />and I would make sure you are familiar with other psychedelics. Enjoy!

				I prefer wood pipes that don&#039;t mind being dropped due to the cubist visuals I experience. Tried a light bulb but didn&#039;t like how it heated up so quickly. <br /><br />I would highly recommend not trying DMT for the first time by yourself.<br /><br />Respect the spirit molecule.

				i would suggest trying changa before freebase dmt, as it&#039;s easier to smoke and it provides a gentler experience, making it better for beginners.

I used to think that trip partners/watchers were silly &amp; for the weak minded. Obviously I had not experienced DMT yet. <br /><br />Sorry for being an alarmist but if dosed correctly in the right setting DMT is one of the most awesome experiences you will ever have. Just hold on to your fucking hat the first few times you use it. Pay close attn to dosing advice people have mentioned, its very important.

Remember this: fear (the real one) is not something that comes from your thoughts, it is a body thing. The point is being to able to function inside that fear. Don&#039;t fight the fear, simply acknowledge it and go on anyway.<br /><br />Your particular fear is the so-called fear of losing your lucidity, your body (your ego in this case) doesn&#039;t want to let the unconscious take the ride and so it tries to block you. If you fight you will lose (both the ego and the unconscious bend only to love); don&#039;t fight the fear and simply accept it as a part of yourself, as a response of your body to the experience, but strive to do what you want to do anyway. When your ego will finally accept the unconscious taking the lead at times this fear will pass.

When your ego will finally accept the unconscious taking the lead at times this fear will pass.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I absolutely love this response, and everyones... and i have checked that thread out, but sometimes certain threads get off topic, and the time i checked it out, it was off topic, and i didnt want to have to change the subject, anyway...i know it is all stupid ass fear, and you are right it is my ego not wanting to let go of its grasp on my body, and it is the wierdest feeling having that pipe in ur hand or that gravity bong ready, and having that power, to go to that place i sooo badly want to go within seconds...but yea i thought of using the gravity bong, cuz i know i wont take enough hits w/ the pipe after i start feeling the initial rush.&nbsp; But if i use a gravity bong, i will just get it all at once, and from what i have heard, that is what you want to do to break through... and i know that i have not broken through, but i have come close......i am sitting here right now, got some of Moon units freebase, and can go there right now if i build some courage to overcome this stupid EGO wanting to keep my sobriety.....I totally want to keep hearing other peoples experiences if any with dealing with that initial fear, and i have tried meditating or relaxing for a little bit, and it works a little.

				IME the best way to smoke dmt is with a crack pipe.<br /><br />There is gerenally a negative connotation with a crack pipe. but if you are wanting to smoke dmt, you shouldnt care =D.<br /><br />I have done it every way that people have suggested. The bong way indeed does work well, but you would only want to do this if you have excess dmt(which you probably dont since you want to know the best way to smoke it), or you cant get a crack pipe.<br /><br />Crack pipes are actually called &#039;oil burners&#039; they can be bought anywhere from $2-10 at your local headshop<br /><br />Happy tripping, and dont forget to combine that dmt with some other drugs to see something so wild become ever so more wild

				You&#039;ll never get a hit from Changa like you do from DMT...although I personally love the stuff.<br />DMT for me is a flat on your back experience with no concept of reality. I like having a smoke of Changa and having a wonder round on a nice bright sunny day :)<br /><br />The first time I had a &quot;breakthrough&quot; hit of DMT was an experience I&#039;ll never forget...but strangely at the same time I can&#039;t &quot;quite&quot; remember it....or not as well as i&#039;d like to anyway :) I remember coming round and just totally understanding everything I had heard about it. <br />Ever since that I&#039;ve not really had the urge to do it again...It almost feels like I&#039;ve been there and don&#039;t need to do it again. It was absolutely beautiful and I&#039;m quite happy having that as my memory of a real DMT hit. I felt totally relaxed and in awe of what was happening. Met some alien type creatures who were clearly showing me something but never spoke. So hard to describe....I think I heard it referred to once as &quot;ineffable&quot; and now I totally get that.<br /><br />I think someone said earlier in this post they&#039;re scared of the initial hit....I know exactly what you mean...I really takes you by force if you&#039;ve had a good hit. Almost overwhelming with a &quot;am I really ready for this right now&quot; feeling! But when your through....that&#039;s gone!<br /><br />Amazing and enlightening stuff but definitely to be respected!!

Don&#039;t fight the fear, acknowledge it.<br />I will make you an example: suppose you have already a male dog in your home and you find another in the street and you bring it home; the dog you have from some time will naturally be jealous and will be angry with the other dog. <br /><br />If you try to force your dog on accepting the other dog, something like &quot;you dog, I do whatever I want, do you understand it? You have to accept everything I do and if I want to bring another dog home you have to just abide to it and be quiet&quot; your dog will simply become even more aggressive towards the newcomer because his frustration on you not understanding him will be channeled on the new dog.<br />If instead you understand why your dog acts the way he acts and you actually pet him more than before, giving him even more attention than before, something like &quot;I understand how you feel and you are right: I&#039;ve brought this new dog home and now you fell your place and leadership challenged by him; but don&#039;t worry, nothing will change, you will feel loved as before and no one will replace you&quot; he will by and by understand that his leadership is not in question and that there&#039;s nothing to feel challenged for and then he will accept the other dog and even befriend him.<br /><br />The same happens with your ego. For the most part of your life it has been the leader of what you call &quot;you&quot;, while the unconscious has been relegated in a little corner with just little peers out while you sleep (or in other similar situations). Now that you try DMT your ego feel threatened by it; it says &quot;what the hell! I&#039;m the leader here, why should I give this thing my place? I will never allow it!&quot; and it will do everything in his power to block the unconscious to take the lead, even if for a moment, and the strongest weapon your ego has is the fear.<br /><br />If you fight the ego (as in the example of the dog) you will lose. The ego will simply grow the sense of fear more and more in return. Instead don&#039;t fight it, understand why your ego feel fear and why it does so and embrace that fear, just don&#039;t have that fear stop you doing what you want to do. Continue to function inside the fear but don&#039;t fight it.<br /><br />Do you understand the difference? (it&#039;s difficult to put in words what I want to say)

				OK BlackIris, i think i get it now!!! i need to acknowledge and accept that it (fear is there), understand why it is there, and continue....Man, remember my last post when i said that i was ready to do it....I STILL didnt do it,&nbsp; but i am not going to fight it anymore, i am going to understand it!&nbsp; I know it is one of the most beautiful things in the world, ya know, so it is soooo very wierd that it gives me this fear.&nbsp; i wish i had someone that was into this experience as much as me, to do it with!&nbsp; &nbsp;my signif. other did it, blasted off, and she doesnt really want to do it like i do anymore.... but i want to exp. that to!!!

From this dose you are not going to get the full effect but there are two reasons why you should begin low: the first is that batches can change and the second that&#039;s the more important is that the first times you are going to smoke/vap (especially if you try to vap) DMT you are most likely to waste a lot in the process.<br /><br />Now, if you start with 50 mg for example (an high dose) you are sure that even if you waste a lot some effect will happen; instead if with 10 mg and you feel nothing at all then you are sure that you are doing something incorrect. Learning to vap/smoke correctly is very important because it naturally waste less product (so more trips in return) and more importantly there&#039;s less casualty tied to the process: if you don&#039;t learn to smoke/vap it correctly and you use always large quantities to receive an effect you can receive with much less, it can in fact happen that for a case or for &quot;luck&quot; you will once in a while be able to smoke it fine and then you will have an effect that you didn&#039;t want to obtain and this can give you trouble. With DMT you want to know what you want from it.<br /><br />When you have learned how to smoke/vap it correctly the usual dose (for a so-called &quot;breakthrough&quot; or NDE) is 20-30 mg; lower doses (10-15 mg) are so-called &quot;plateau&quot; ones and larger doses are for experienced users only if you want to do something specific (if you know how to vap/smoke DMT correctly there&#039;s usually no reason to do that much until you have not a normal resistance to the drug).

				If you&#039;re new to DMT / Changa, which I assume you are, then I recommend you try out Changa first, simply because it&#039;s absolutely foolproof to smoke and you won&#039;t waste it as if attempting to vaporize DMT.<br /><br />All you need is a bong, you don&#039;t need fancy vaporizers, depending on the ratio I&#039;d recommend 100mg Changa, that&#039;d contain approx. 50mg DMT.<br />Asylum and mahakala both have great Changa.<br />I personally prefer mahakala&#039;s Changa, but nevertheless both vendors are amazing and they offer the finest stuff.

				just buy a crack pipe. then you will absorb only dmt, and not any pot. the pot makes it harder to hold in the dmt. <br /><br />You will have an amazing experience if you use a crack pipe. i have only broken through once from a bong and we put like .5 in it. Its really a waste of dmt.

You burned the DMT. Just because you sandwiched it in between weed, doesn&#039;t mean you burned it correctly. You have to take your time and let it slowly melt before you cherry the shit out of the top layer of bud. Bud burns fast, and the flame will start to reach the DMT almost instantly.<br />Just get something to vaporize it with instead.

As I said begin low so you learn and don&#039;t waste product (as you did).<br />Just create &quot;the machine&quot;, it is very easy to do (every little bottle as strawberry extract, single use alcoholics as cognac, a bottle of tabasco etc. can be used) and you will be fine, there are a lot guides on the clearnet on how to do it, one easier than the other; this or do a vap out of a lightbulb (but &quot;the machine&quot; is much better since there&#039;s the brillo in which you can melt the DMT).<br /><br />You can also use a bong, but as in your experience it is very easy to burn the DMT and waste a lot.
