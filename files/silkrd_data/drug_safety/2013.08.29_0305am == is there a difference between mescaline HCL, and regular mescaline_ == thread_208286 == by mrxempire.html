				I have in my possession 1 g of powdered mescaline HCL from a reputable vendor. It&#039;s a little baggie full of white powder. When I show the bag off to my friends, they are surprised that it isn&#039;t in the plant, or &quot;button&quot; form that mescaline usually comes in. Is there a difference between the powdered mescaline, and &quot;regular&quot; mescaline? If so, what are the differences?

				Mescaline HCl is just one of the pure salt forms of the chemical mescaline.&nbsp; Is your stuff from gammagoblin?&nbsp; I tried that recently, and it was awesome.&nbsp; I think outside of silk road pure mescaline HCl is beyond rare so your friends are just surprised you aren&#039;t stuck eating a cactus or cactus extract.&nbsp; Peyote, San Pedro, and Peruvian Torch are cactii containing mescaline and other alkaloids, but they aren&#039;t the same as pure mescaline HCl which is just the primary active drug from those cactii in the hcl salt form.&nbsp; There are some other forms of mescaline (mescaline sulfate and the freebase of mescaline) which would vary in dosage compared to the HCl form slightly.

				yes it is from gammagoblin. I have no doubts about the quality of this stuff, i was just curious why it came in powder form. Very glad to hear that powder form is like the best form of mescaline!

				There is even a route that can get you Mescaline Citrate, which is the salt akin to lemons and limes.<br /><br />You are going to have an absolute blast.&nbsp; 8)
