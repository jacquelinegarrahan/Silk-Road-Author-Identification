				Title: <strong>Cutting Fentanyl</strong><br />

				Ok,<br />I&#039;m purchacing a modest quantity of uncut fentanyl citrate powder, I&#039;m no chemist, but I&#039;ve done my homework, and fell I can handle it a safely as to be expected.&nbsp; The best information I have found as to the proper way to cut it is this:<br />The pure Fentanyl can not be used as is, because it&#039;s much, much too strong and MUST be diluted, else there will be a lot of overdoses!<br />The following procedure gives a white heroin which is the same as very good (30%) street heroin.<br /><br />100mg of Fentanyl. HCl is dissolved in 2ml of Methanol. Weigh up 10g of Lactose and warm it at about 60-70 deg C into a large dish with a hotplate. Add the methanolic solution of Fentanyl dropwise at regular intervals into the warm Lactose for a good pre-mix . Wait until all the Methanol is evaporated and mix the Lactose-Fentanyl thoroughly. This is crucial because if this is not thoroughly mixed, there will be a part of the Lactose without Fentanyl and part of the Lactose with too much Fentanyl, possibly causing dramatic overdoses!<br /><br />Now you have a very high quality of street white Heroin.<br /><br />This type of Heroin was used and sold during a year, and the feedback of the consumers was very good. The consumers were very happy and didn&#039;t want the usual brown Heroin anymore. So be careful, some people (The Mafia and other dealers) will perhaps turn very jealous!<br /><br />Remember that with 1gr of pure Fentanyl HCl you can make 100gr of very high quality Heroin!<br /><br />This seems like solid info, but if anyone out there in internet-land has any supplementary advice, or warning of potential pitfalls I&#039;d appreciate it. Also, I&#039;d like some advice on how to rock it up.<br />Thanky.
