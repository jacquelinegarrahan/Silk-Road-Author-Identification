				Hey guys, ordered 1200 Âµg 25i-NBOMe x5 from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyl3r Durden and have literally zero experience with any sort of psychadelic. Firstly seeing a fair amount of negative stuff about this product recently on here and elsewhere so what is the situation there?<br /><br />Secondly how much should I take for my first trip - go balls out and have the whole thing, is it even a strong dose? I know nothing and all advice is appreciated.

				Ive tried a few of Tylers products. They definitely do the job however i highly recommend you DO NOT take more than one tab. I took two and ended up losing control of what was going on before collapsing into a 35minutes long seizure then waking up after the blackout with no memories apart from a very sharp violent head movement as i entered the seizure. <br /><br />To be honest i feel i am lucky as i know people have died from Nbome related Seizures

				25i-NBOMe was my first psychedelic too, and I must say, it&#039;s not a good first-time psychedelic. The sensation is very recreational and makes you a monkey. You just go all &#039;&#039;uga-buga&#039;&#039;. I took two tabs and okay, had a funny time with my friend whom I also offered some, but it was only all about getting wasted and gives a very bad first impression to psychedelics, I ordered&nbsp; a 25 tab set and gave the rest of them away to another friend. I didn&#039;t like it.<br /><br />Mushrooms and LSD is my type.

This is the third long seizure that i have had (the first i blamed on something different and not the nbome however now believe it was the nbome not the pills i was on with the previous time). <br /><br />From my experiences i would say don&#039;t even bother with it but hey it is an experience and your body may react different to mine :)<br /><br />If you do choose to take it be careful and good luck i hope it all goes well for you :) <br /><br />

				Well here is a bit of science/understanding for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />LSD/Shrooms mimics the serotonin transmitters, and NBOME/Peyote mimics the dopamine transmitter.&nbsp; Now lets look at harder drugs, heroin floods the body with serotonin, and cocaine floods the body with dopamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />So with that basic understanding, NBOME could be considered a WAY more UPPER of a psychedelic.&nbsp; Now when i experimented with this... which was only 2x i had a pretty good time.&nbsp; I took 3 tabs under my lip for about 45 min.&nbsp; Had some decent visual patterns emerge, music felt fucking amazing....infact i think this was what i liked most about it.... personally i also felt like i was tripping bawls but i could still talk to people...&nbsp; all in all decent time, but LSD/DMT is the only psychedelics i need.

				@ typtap<br /><br />yer right, i was misinformed.&nbsp; Mescaline/NBOME are definitely agonist for serotonin receptors.&nbsp; &nbsp;The phenethylamine psychedelics on the other hand, such as mescaline (found naturally in peyote) and compounds of the 2C family (NBOME), more closely resemble the neurotransmitter dopamine.&nbsp; I think this is what confused me.<br /><br />

				Babysteps. Learn to swim before you jump in at the deep end.<br /><br />also, in my experiance, Psychedelics contained in natural substances (mushrooms, cacti) can provide a much more amazing breakthrough into the psychedelic universe than chemicals.<br /><br />just be wary of doseage and setting.<br />also have no requirements the following day.

				I have tried tylers stuff multiple times :)<br /><br />ALTHOUGH<br /><br />with the tabs be extremely careful i took two of them and ended up having a seizure blacking out and waking up an hour and a half later remembering nothing, didnt come off of the trip for two days as was still seeing mild trippy visions.<br /><br />Tylers stuff is legit and good just dont be a fucking idiot like me and abuse it :) <br /><br />The capsules (strawberry snuff caps) that he offers are very good. one of those is a good clean 5-6 hours with a few hours coming down very much less intense.<br /><br />Me and my friend did 7 capsules each this time luckily didnt seizure however it was a brilliant intense experience (best i have had) trip lasted 14-15 hours and were wondering around a village not knowing what the fuck was what. :P <br /><br />Smaller doses it is still VERY intense so if its your first psychadelic i recommend trying salvia or something to see what it is like.<br /><br />Maybe try moving onto shrooms or 2C-B<br /><br />2C-B is a very smooth trip with nice visuals and lots of euphoria and energy, kinda like a much more trippy mdma.<br /><br />my opinion Avoid NBOME. it may be cheaper but shrooms and LSD are very similar... well LSD is very similar to Nbome yet it wont cause near death experiences of which i have had. :)<br /><br />Hope i can be of help, if you want to know anything more or have any questions i have tried tylers Nbome about 10-15 different ocassions and will be happy to help :)<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />CJ

				I&#039;ve done 25i/c several times now and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I&#039;ve previously done lsd, shrooms 2cb and a few other bits but none pushed as far as the 25s which tbf I haven&#039;t gone silly with, nothing over 1mg nasally.<br />I&#039;ve found it far more visual than lsd or shrooms at similar dosages, more visual for the level of headfuckedness, a fantastic music enhancer and usually gives me a profound sense of conectedness with all of creation :) I&#039;d also agree with a previous poster about productivity/learning, not necessarily getting stuff done but being fascinated reading about interesting/complex topics.<br />One thing I keep thinking with all these first time tripper threads is that you need to go into it in the right frame of mind, this will have far more impact than what chemical you&#039;re taking. They will make you question yourself, wonder why you&#039;ve done this to yourself, what was so wrong with being sober ;) You&#039;ve gotta be able to push past that and not dwell on it, or wonder if you&#039;re going to have a seizure (they&#039;re still pretty isolated cases) or you&#039;re gonna have a bad time! Once you&#039;ve taken it, it&#039;s happening, regardless of what you might want, so just enjoy it!<br />The first time I took lcd it was awesome. the 2nd time was about a year later, I was so wound up/expectant about it I got all anxious and thought something was going wrong and nearly had a bad time. once i&#039;d got past that and realised it was just me it was fine. Shrooms I don&#039;t particularly get on with, feel like I&#039;m a passenger rather than in control.<br />So yeah. Do it, or don&#039;t, but be sure of your decision. From what I&#039;ve read, the come up from 25i tabs is much more steady than nasal so it shouldn&#039;t be quite such a shock!

				There are a lot of crazy comments in this thread. You won&#039;t know how 25i-NBOMe affects YOU until you take it. If you&#039;ve never taken a psychedelic before, do not take more than one dose. You may get nausea. I&#039;ve seen 20 people do it before and none of them reported any adverse health effects.<br /><br />&quot;NBOMe&quot; is not the drug. The active part of these drugs is indicated by the letter (i, b, c, d, e). NBOMes are all based on and feel similar to their 2C (mescaline or phenethylamine-based) counterparts.

				edawg ive seen some of your posts and you seem like a cool dude but you have it all wrong. just because a chemical seems to mimic a certain nuerotransmitter, doesnt mean thats where the activity lies. i actually found out just recently that cocaine has a high affinity for serotonin.. and as for the nbomes, they have a higher affinity for the 5ht2a receptor-(the receptor they think causes visuals) than literally any other psychedelic available. david nichols talks about the nbomes in a MAPS video i saw not too long ago. he shows the activity that all sorts of different drugs have on the brain (the dox chemicals have high affinity for 5ht2a as well). really i would just say that every phenethylamine seems to be in a way, a set of fun, active, social psychedelics. indoles that mimic serotonin, seem to hand messages down from higher sources, as well as showing you visions that can truly speak to you and makes sense, where as phenethylamine visuals seem more like distortions most of the time.(to me anyways) my first psychedelic experience was dmt, and i wouldnt ever change that. it was such a real introduction to psychedelics that i have no choice but to take them seriously. the nbomes are definitely fun and you can definitely learn some things but it just doesnt seem like im tapping into a god-like intelligence like i am when im on psilocybin/psilocin, lsd, or dmt. they really are the most acknowledged for a reason.

				well like i said i still think you can learn something from the nbomes, and ive tried a random 2c chem that was being sold around town as peyote...

				Before any of your newbies try any NBOMe (or any RC for this case) Do an allergy test first. Unfold a paperclip and dab it in your HCL and apply it to your gums to see if you&#039;re at least sensitive to the chemical before indulging in that shit!That&#039;s probably the reason for some of these people taking NBOMe and blacking out with seizures. Some of you guys are probably really sensitive if not allergic to this stuff.

				If you&#039;ve never had any experience with psychedelics, why begin with a research chemical like 25i-NBOMe? Wouldn&#039;t it be better to start with LSD or mushrooms, which have been proven to have no adverse effects on the body, have excellent recreational value, and can have tremendous psychological and spiritual benefits?

				Don&#039;t let everyone spook you. If you go into the trip with anxiety the chances of you having a bad trip are increased. I&#039;ve used many NBOME&#039;s countless times. I do what to say that those tabs are pretty heavy. I tend to like my 25I-nbome tabs around 1000mcg. For your first experience i would recommend having a trip sitter that can talk you through a difficult trip as well as keeping some music going, movies going, or some form of activity. It&#039;s an easier experience if you have someone guiding you. <br /><br />I would recommend taking a half tab or even a quarter tab for an allergy test. You also might want to acquire some benzoids in case you want to take the edge off. I would say that 25I-nbome is more on the stimulant side out of the nbomes. It is derived from 2C-I which in my opinion is the most stimulating 2C. <br /><br />I hope you have a wonderful time and i would love to read your trip report. Good luck and stay safe.

Unfold a paperclip and dab it in your HCL and apply it to your gums to see if you&#039;re at least sensitive to the chemical before indulging in that shit!That&#039;s probably the reason for some of these people taking NBOMe and blacking out with seizures. Some of you guys are probably really sensitive if not allergic to this stuff.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This. Seriously. I do an allergy/poison test every time I get a new delivery of NBOMe, ya never know what COULD be in it or if you COULD have an adverse reaction.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;ve never tripped before you&#039;d probably be fine doing just half a tab; I see no reason to potentially get in over your head if you&#039;ve never had a psychedlic experience.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				I&#039;ve dosed 25i-NBOMe well over a dozen times now and I&#039;ve always had marvelous experiences. 2mg, in particular, combined with prolonged staring at a picture of the Carina Nebula, merged my ego with Universality, if that&#039;s even a term. I basically saw EVERYTHING right there in that little picture on my iPhone screen. From the infinite projections of avatara, to flat out cosmic intercourse, the compunded profundity of it all led me to a Cartesian conclusion that the prospect of reincarnation is very real, albeit, just in a different light than most religions interpret it. Sadly, I used the remainder of my HardHustle stash to acheive this state and I&#039;m disappointed that extraneous issues have prevented him from restocking.<br /><br />Anyways, I believe HPBCD complexed blotters are the way to go in terms of administration. I don&#039;t have the pharmacological know how to explain exactly why I feel this way, but complexed experiences seem to feel less &quot;chemically&quot;, if you kinda get the gist of what I mean there. <br /><br />The way I look at 25i, it&#039;s theoretically safe as any coke or horse you get on the street, so proceed accordingly.

				@ wavelength, you are correct i was confused on my research, they look similar but they do affect mainly the h5 receptors....which makes it more similar to LSD and shrooms...still!!!!!!! i heard people can die on NBOME&#039;s....now obviously they where fuck heads about taking it....but i just never do really know where the tabs go after they leave my hands...last thing i need is to be a suspect in a nbome murder case.....yes i&#039;m wearing my tin foil hat....n sorry i didn&#039;t see yer post till now....

				personally, i don&#039;t see a point in any other psychedelics other than DMT...if yer gonna take the ride....might as well be the fucking king of them all...<br /><br />i&#039;ve lived a thousand years in hyperspace....only to die there and be brought back to life here....swallow that pill...i love my DMT adventures...but one thing i found different with DMT from other drugs, was that EVERY time i did it again it got more profound and more meaningful...to the point where i would come back in tears sometimes praying to god or whatever spirits where caring for me....<br /><br />its a wild ride, just be good in your head and heart and your journey will be blissful and pure...go into DMT with an attitude and cockiness...well the deemster goddess is gonna bitch slap your ass and put you in her dungeon for 15 min....<br /><br /><br />peace and love my brothas!

Even if the DMT experience is &quot;real&quot;, it is sensory/cognitive experience information. DMT does not evoke transcendental spiritual experiences -- experiences which are beyond the senses, beyond cognition, beyond thought, beyond emotion, beyond information, etc. Whether the information comes from within the Self or outside of the Self is irrelevant. It&#039;s a sensory/cognitive not a spiritual experience. It is still information.<br /><br />those who believe that the DMT high is a spiritual experience are still seeking spirituality. i know this sounds arrogant, but i say this having experienced satori-samadhi levels of consciousness with the aid of LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, hashish, and meditation. Such people have yet to experience the Unity of the Self with the Godhead which is called Satori in Zen Buddhism, or the unity of Brahman and Atman in Vedanta, etc.&nbsp; they are still looking, and hopefully some day they will experience the Unity.<br /><br />The &quot;spirit realm&quot; is the same as our everyday reality. It&#039;s not some new world outside of this one; it is, however, transcendent to thought and cannot be spoken of, and thus appears to be a new world to our normal everyday consciousness, but when it is found it is recognised as being no different from our own world. If you believe the &quot;spirit realm&quot; is something outside our own everyday reality, you&#039;re still seeking, my friend. :) You have not experienced the Unity.... The best tool, in my opinion, to experience the Unity is meditation, with or without the aid of such substances as LSD, mushrooms, and mescaline. <br /><br />Yes, DMT lasts about 15 minutes. It is an experience inside of time. cosmic consciousness is outside of time. if what you have experienced is within time, it is not the Unity. If you perceive &#039;entities&#039;, as people do on DMT, then it is not the Unity. All is one in Brahman.

				I need a good vaporizor to smoke DMT with. I&#039;ve only tried it on top of weed. <br /><br />How long before 25i breaks free of RC category?&nbsp; They are looking for a street name? It&#039;s cool if you use it how it&#039;s supposed to be used wether your snorting or blotter tabbing and I hear it don&#039;t work well with zoloft. My first time was one of tylers snuff caps and I only did half and redosed the other half later. 25i is definitely different from the rest of the 25&#039;s or 2c&#039;s. That 2cp I tried was pretty fucking stout and was ingested down the throat
