				hello, I personally like taking psychedelics by myself. Even marijuana. Nothing worse for me than tripping with other people. I just get distracted from the experience and get to much anxiety and fear. I always have good trips by myself.<br />However, I really want to take large doses. 5grams and up and around 400-600 mics of LSD.<br /><br />I of course will have benzos handy... however, will I lose my mind completely? The only thing I&#039;m really afraid of is wandering outside or something like that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been really high on LSD before and sometimes I&#039;d have to open my eyes just to check and make sure I was safe psysically because I can&#039;t tell if I&#039;m moving around or not lol. <br /><br />Just wondering what if this is a good idea or not. Thank you :D<br /><br /><br />

				wouldnt recommend it as tripping by yourself can potentially get a little irrational.<br /><br />i once was afraid to leave my home because I was scared of LE finding me because of my SR activity lol i dont even buy that much.<br /><br />surely there is 1 other person who you are comfortable unraveling in front of...?<br /><br />good luck either way<br /><br />---<br /><br />Speegs

				I also prefer lone wolfing it.&nbsp; Not even for the paranoia but for the journey.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t see an issue with those amounts, though it could get a little interesting.<br /><br />Make sure to have your benzos handy and if you&#039;re doing it at home make sure to remove your stash and equipment in case you go a little crazy and 5-0 gets involved.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for pushing back the bounds of insanity but make sure you have some rules in place, for example hide your keys in a way you can&#039;t find them (driving on a 5+ grams of shrooms is a very bad idea, and I&#039;ve done it) and know what your physical boundaries are.&nbsp; If you put some fear &amp; emotion behind your rules as prep you will be less likely to break &#039;em.

				No one can really tell you if it&#039;s a good idea or not.<br />It depends on so many different things.<br /><br />I like to take higher doses when I&#039;m alone (within reason) and have taken 500-600mics numerous times. It&#039;s only around 1,000mics that I usually get a friend around.<br />If you get the set and setting right, are prepared then you should have no problems. I don&#039;t keep benzos on hand as I&#039;ve never needed them, I do have some schizophrenia medication that will apparently stop a trip in ~30 minutes but I can&#039;t say if they work or not as I&#039;ve never needed them. They&#039;re an absolute last resort. <br /><br />I have only taken shrooms once and it was alone. That was around 28grams and everything was fine (these were fresh shrooms not dried)

				Whats the hurry. Work your way up and see how you handle it. I&#039;ve tripped by myself on mushrooms so many times and at doses as high as 70grams fresh. You don&#039;t lose your mind but you may have to learn how to let go. It will help you to strengthen your mind through meditation as well as using psychedelics. They are much better as a tool of mind enhancement.
