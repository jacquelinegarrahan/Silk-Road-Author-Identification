				Hi dear Forum-users,<br /><br />I&#039;ve never done any drug-cocktail before.... (Well I had some drinks of alcohol while on MDMA and while on Speed... but that doesn&#039;t count really...)<br />And I&#039;m a bit scared of doing so as well since you really increase risks of neurotoxicity and body load, and strain on the liver right?<br />Yet... I&#039;m also very curious to discover new experiences, and find the boundaries of my mind and consciousness (that&#039;s also why I started drugs in the first place...)<br />I recently ordered some of those combo-vials davidd is offering ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/16129 ) containing BK-MDMA and 4-MEC...<br />This seemed like quite a good place to start... for as far as this is considered a &#039;cocktail&#039; since both substances are very related...<br /><br />So I was wondering... What cocktails have you done, and what cocktail would you advise to others for good/meaningful/spiritual/amazing/w/e experience?<br />And what would you recommend me, since I&#039;d like to build up gruadually, what would be quite a &#039;mild&#039; cocktail?<br /><br />Might be worth noticing I prefer to stay away from opioids since&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll be instantly addicted to them (I am at some risk of addiction since I already find it hard to stay off amphetamine&#039;s on normal days sometimes)... And I&#039;d prefer to stay away from IM/IV as well (pretty much same reason.... and... well... I&#039;m scared shitless of needles!).<br /><br />Greets,<br />Klaassjaak
