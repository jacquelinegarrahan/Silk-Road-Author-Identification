				I have been off my ADs for a few weeks now and im a little on the moody side to say the least!<br />I don&#039;t really want to go pump myself full of SSRIs again so anyone know any effective mood improving supplements?<br /><br />I have tried a handful already but nothing has made much difference... Open to any suggestions.&nbsp;

				Rubidium chloride seems like an interesting mood improving supplement, but it&#039;d be pretty hard to find. I wouldn&#039;t take any SSRI&#039;s but other antidepressants like tianeptine or selegiline though if you can. 5-HTP is also a good supplement for that but shouldn&#039;t be mixed with SSRIs, if you&#039;ve been off for a few weeks then it should be okay.. There&#039;s also St John&#039;s wort but it doesn&#039;t work very well and lithium but it can be a little dangerous.

				What about SAM-e? Its been recommended to me as an antidepressant and I&#039;ve seen it on the shelves at health food stores. I don&#039;t know anything about its neurochemistry, tho.

				I&#039;m going to recommend Modafinil, especially if you are experiencing lethargy and/or you have trouble getting up in the morning. You may find that alleviating these symptoms helps your overall mood and therefor pulls you out of your depressive slump. <br /><br />Also, whatever you do, don&#039;t drink if you are depressed. I&#039;ve been there and done that -it doesn&#039;t help... it just makes it worse.
