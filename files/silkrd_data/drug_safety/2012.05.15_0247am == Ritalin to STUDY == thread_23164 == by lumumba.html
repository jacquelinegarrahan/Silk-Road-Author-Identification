				Take the ritalin or adderall before you have to do whatever scholastic activity you must. It will last a few hours then taper off.<br /><br />My advice is to cut the addy in half, though. 10mg is sufficient for most people without ADD.

It feels like a more natural stimulation and lasts throughout the day. Sadly I&#039;ve given up stimulants for the most part, it&#039;s just not worth being on them now that I&#039;m out of school and getting older. Luckily I still have about a few hundred left from when I had a prescription, they&#039;re perfect to take for those shitty days at work. ;D

It used to bode well for me, but my inner strength/passion/energy/chi (science calls it ADHD) has learned to override the chemical influences on my conscious thinking. I still have to work hard to keep myself engaged. For me, the AMP&#039;s just give me the chance to artificially instigate sessions of focus by distracting this inner &quot;whatever.&quot;<br /><br />I still believe ADHD is DISASTROUSLY misunderstood and, relatively to other common neuro-behavioral&nbsp; phenomena, unkonwn.

				Take your comfortable dosage of ritalin an hour before you begin to study.&nbsp; About 15 minutes after ingestion, immediately start on whatever you want to focus on.&nbsp; When it kicks in, you will literally be stuck/addicted and forced into doing whatever you were doing when the pill starts to work.&nbsp; So if you take a pill, go play video games and wait for it to kick in, you will probably be stuck playing video games for the duration of the pill.&nbsp; Be in a comfortable environment with no distractions, and start you&#039;re work/study as soon as you can after taking it.&nbsp; From my experience, that&#039;s the best way to use stimulants as study-aids.
