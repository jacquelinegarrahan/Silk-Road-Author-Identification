				I took 2 tabs (the strongest trip to date) of some really strong tabs (they would be worth 5 or 6 other tabs I&#039;ve done). Music was more amazing than it had ever been but one very strange side effect that I have never encountered or even heard of occurred. Towards the end of my trips everything was that I touched was absolutely FREEZING, and it wasn&#039;t a cold night. The leather lounge, the wooden desk, the marble counter top etc were all ice cold. The only thing that was normal were my bed sheets. Has anything like this ever happened to anyone on LSD?

				My best guess is that you were tripping very hard and your sense of touch was extremely heightened.&nbsp; Things that are cool to the touch became freezing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a guess lol.

				I often get temperature regulation anomalies when tripping. One minute I&#039;m burning up and the next I&#039;m freezing. Almost like a fever. But nothing I have ever worried about (just if I&#039;m outside I make sure to layer my clothes so I can adjust as needed.)<br /><br />As for it being items you&#039;re touching and not yourself, I&#039;d say it&#039;s the difference between you and the item. Like when you come in from the cold and someone who&#039;s been in the warm touches you, it feels really hot (like burning) because their skin is that much hotter than yours. Your bed sheets were the exemption as they match your body temperature so there is no difference to feel.<br /><br />Just a theory, but I hope it helps.
