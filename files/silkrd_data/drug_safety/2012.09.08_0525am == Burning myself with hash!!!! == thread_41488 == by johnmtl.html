				Ha another victim of the good old hot rocks. Hurts like hell doesn&#039;t it? Little bastards keep on burning as well.&nbsp; A lot of my clothes have been peppered by hot rocks falling on them, just have the most random assortment of holes burnt through them :P Was that your Moroccan slate you were smoking John?
