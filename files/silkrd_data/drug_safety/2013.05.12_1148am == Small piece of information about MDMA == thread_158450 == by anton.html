				An extract from &quot;ECSTASY: THE COMPLETE GUIDE&quot;<br /><br />MDMA also known as Ecstasy (X, XTC, E, Rolls), is a semi-synthetic drug,<br />since it is related to many chemicals found in nature. The tree that gives us<br />nutmeg and mace (IVlyristicafragrans), as well as its essential oil safrole, is the<br />most commonly known relative of MDMA, but the sassafras root is, in fact,<br />a much more potent source of safrole. Safrole is the major natural precursor<br />in the synthesis of MDMA. Other natural elements that have chemical simi-<br />larities to MDMA are parsley, dill, and the calamus root.<br /><br />I am interested to find out more about the parsley and dill, and if it is in-fact possible to get high on these herbs!
