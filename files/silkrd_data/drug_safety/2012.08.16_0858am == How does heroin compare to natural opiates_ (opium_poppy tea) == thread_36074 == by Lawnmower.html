				I use opium/poppy tea once a week or so (sometimes twice, sometimes not at all), but I can only do this from the end of the summer when my crop comes in until February or so. The rest of the year I have no genuine cravings for it but I would like to have some for when I want some. <br /><br />Anyway the real question is would getting a bag of H be a good replacement? I just like to take some at the weekend and chill watching a movie with my fiance.<br />With the poppies I have absolutely no desire to use them frequently because I don&#039;t like feeling so slow when I&#039;m trying to get shit done. I have been physically addicted to them before, and it was unpleasant but to me it felt mostly like a combination of bad flu and depression. I had plenty of opium but didn&#039;t want to use it for fear of lengthening withdrawal. <br /><br />I would just like to know whether the addictiveness of all opiates is similar or if H is really that much more addictive. With opium physical addiction is managed easily due to the seemingly long half-life and psychologically I have no problems due to the constant drowsiness the day after use.<br /><br />I think it would become a problem for me only if I can function well while on it like with amphetamines. I only like taking drugs regularly if I feel enhanced.<br /><br />I have tried vicodin before and enjoyed that, though it felt a little bit shallow compared to opium and tea. I couldn&#039;t see myself taking it regularly due to the lethargy. <br /><br />Does anyone have any input? I have a feeling I know what the answer will be&nbsp; ;D

				Having cultivated some decent strains of GE poppies and gone so far as to score them and produce domestic opium, I&#039;ll offer the opinion that no synthetic or single opioid will provide the same broad spectrum feeling as opium or poppy tea. Heroin, morphine, buprenorphine, oxycodone, methadone, and codeine all seem to lack the broadness and warm satisfaction that comes form the alkaloid extract that comes form the plant.<br /><br />If you&#039;re anything like me, a bag of heroin won&#039;t satisfy you in the same way that nurturing and using a crop does. I presume the mix of codeine, thebaine, morphine, and other esoteric opioids combine to give a unique experience that isn&#039;t easily attainable with synthetics or single opioids. The bulk of my experience with opioids is from poppies I grew myself, so there&#039;s probably a proper devotee around here somewhere that can provide more information on whether anything else can provide the same wholesome high.

				I know what you mean. Only other opiates I have tried have been hydrocodone, codeine and the opiates&#039; retarded cousin Tramadol. None of them come close in terms of &quot;wholesomeness&quot; to real opium, though hydrocodone can be somewhat more potent in terms of euphoria and Tramadol is better for using when you have things to do. They also both seem to wear off MUCH faster than poppy tea, which usually has a peak of 6 hours or so with no noticeable diminishing of effects. I always fall asleep before it is even remotely wearing off&nbsp; 8).<br /><br />I just dislike going half the year without a substance that I can safely enjoy and benefit from. Buying pods is ludicrously expensive when you are used to growing them so that is out of the question. Nor do I want to pay a small fortune for prescription meds here - at something like 20 euros for a decent dose I would rather be without.<br /><br />Heroin just seems cost effective and readily available.

				Heroin certainly is cheaper than medicinal opiates but a decent proportion of that comes from it being cut down time and time again as it moves around the world. <br /><br />Heroin&#039;s high is very different from my point of view than poppy tea. Heroin is like a rollercoaster, opium is like riding a monorail. Compared to spending a whole day nicely warm and fuzzy with poppy tea, heroin was a kinda rude awakening to me. <br /><br />I suspect that the closest effects you could get would be in time-release oxycodone or similar, which will last you a nice long time.
