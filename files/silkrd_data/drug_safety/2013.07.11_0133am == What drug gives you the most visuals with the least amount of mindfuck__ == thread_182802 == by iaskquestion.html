				4-AcO-DET was almost exclusively visual for me with my 3 or 4 experiences with it. I can highly recommend it with some good amphetamine.<br /><br />2C-B is certainly not the biggest headfuck, neither is 25i-NBOMe, but I don&#039;t know anyone who&#039;s taken them without feeling outside of themselves. I have extensive experience with both substances. Perhaps at up to ~15mg 2C-B you can enjoy the visuals without things becoming too strange, but should avoid 25i-NBOMe entirely if you can...

				Hmm... 4-AcO-DET, you say remoulade?<br />I&#039;ll have to give that a go sometime then.<br /><br />For me, I&#039;d have to go with 2c-e as it&#039;s pretty easy on the mind and lovely on the visuals. <br />I&#039;ve heard that 2c-i is also really visual with less mental stuff, but I&#039;ve heard that it&#039;s often underwhelming as far as psychedelics go.

				I think the term &quot;fuck&quot; is self explanatory, he&#039;s looking for the Matchdotcom of the mind.&nbsp; I agree RC&#039;s are the way to go, if he&#039;s not retarded and/or can measure 25mg accurately.&nbsp; 2Ci will probably meet his needs, really any of the 2C&#039;s

This can mean that you can have or not have a mind-fuck, depending on the type of personality you have, your set and settings, your previous experiences etc. etc.<br /><br />So DMT can be like you are perfectly normal, or feel like you are completely mind-fucked. It&#039;s both things in a certain sense.

				Thought I posted before but it must not have gone through... <br /><br />Anyway, 25i-NBOMe is a psychedelic drug which is considered by most who take it to have very strong visuals but minimal headspace.<br /><br />Just be careful, it has only been on the market a couple of years and has a VERY sketchy safety profile.

I have had some &quot;bad trips&quot; on s-iso ketamine, however. <br />Once I took way too much, thinking my tolerance was really high and I wanted to just finish the bag already. What resulted was me falling into a k-hole and then when I *thought* I was out of the k-hole (able to move, etc) what was actually happening was that I was in ANOTHER k-hole, like one inside of another. I remember it felt like I was in The Science of Sleep&#039;s stop-motion scenes and there were Ketamine Beings operating the stage which was my bedroom. And they were basically telling me that this was the end of my life, that I&#039;d passed on into the next life. I felt very distraught and all I could do was hold onto the notion that I was on a drug and that it wasn&#039;t true. But I felt like my body was withering away and I was just totally gone into another universe. It was a very psychedelic trip and scary, but I gained quite a bit from it (as I think is possible with all &quot;bad&quot; trips). <br /><br />On the whole, I&#039;d agree and say that full mental capacity is there for DMT and not so for ketamine, but that doesn&#039;t make scary or bad trips on ketamine impossible :)

				I&#039;d say 2c-b at around 15-25 mg, but you may be more or less tolerant depending on your own neurological systems.

Either if someone would say to me &quot;now I take you and I will kill you&quot; I would simply reply: &quot;and so?&quot; (or at last I would think so at the beginning; in a situation as that I guess I would after be able to connect the dots, but it was just an example). I always find that when I use K my reasoning ability is much dulled and I cannot really care about one thing or another too much. Yes, I can think but what I think cannot make an impression one way or another. It is like K dissociates also a part of my reasoning ability with my body. For this I did think a real psychedelic crisis highly improbable on Ketamine, since to have one you must turn a generic anxiety into a specific one (elsewhere you can have an uncomfortable experience but not a real crisis), and this usually requires an certain degree of intact reasoning ability.<br /><br />But I guess there are anyway certain thresholds or certain types of experiences into which the reasoning ability can return full force, as in your case, or as in my example if something like that REALLY would happen. I guess that if the general anxiety is strong enough this will happen. Our body is made in ways that there are always some sort of &quot;exits for emergencies&quot;.
