				i had a few years where i did alot of really nice shardy crystal intermittently.&nbsp; since then i&#039;ve done tons of other misc stims, from 4-fa and 4-fma to dex, mdpv, and coke.&nbsp; all are great in their own way but in my mind meth was very unique.&nbsp; totally understanding the neurotoxicity i still have had a strong craving lately to get a little bag.&nbsp; been looking at vortexmilkman&#039;s stuff.&nbsp; anyways i tend to be very controlling and analytical about my drug use now and don&#039;t just want to do key and pen cap bumps and random lines and rails this time.&nbsp; i have a great milligram scale and want to do some more controlled dosing.<br />little info about it.&nbsp; i am very stim sensitive and even now 20 to 30 mg of dex can get me feeling awesome.&nbsp; what kind of bumps should i do?&nbsp; 5 mg or more each time?&nbsp; <br />what about oral admin?&nbsp; <br />seein&#039; if there are ne other geeky meth dabblers out there&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />*destiny*

				It&#039;s about twice as strong as dex so 10 to 15 mg should give you a nice boost without tweaking you out too much. They used to make 10 and 15 mg Desoxyn pills but it looks like they&#039;re discontinued. It&#039;s interesting that the scourge called meth is FDA approved for children as young as 6, and it says &quot;The usual effective dose is 20 to 25 mg daily.&quot; I highly doubt up to 25 mg a day will cause much permanent brain damage if it&#039;s acceptable to give to kids whose brains are still developing.

				awesome thank u.&nbsp; i figured it was a rather low dose.&nbsp; at that rate a quarter G could give u like 10 good doses.&nbsp; not bad for the price, depending on purity.&nbsp; &nbsp;hmm.<br /><br />*destiny*

				Hi sweetie,<br /><br />I don&#039;t really&nbsp; have anything helpful to add unfortunately, but I can say that VortexMilkMan is a wonderful vendor, I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences with him and his product is top-notch. I think he&#039;s the only vendor at the moment, actually, but still he&#039;s a great guy.<br /><br />Anyway, I wanted to say;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7938.msg72600#msg72600">Quote from: candorean on January 02, 2012, 10:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have a master&#039;s in pharmacology. If we look strictly at the ratio between threshold effects and neurotoxicity, methamphetamine has less neurotoxic potential than both l- and d- amphetamines. The &quot;images of meth&quot; we all see are thanks to people who were unable to control their usage. Hell, the Japanese government was distributing meth to workers post WWII to improve productivity. The &quot;safe&quot; neurotoxic threshold dose for daily use is 0.5mg/kg. If you ever find yourself taking more than 0.75mg/kg a day, you should reevaluate your reasons for taking meth.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />candorean is absolutely right, obviously. Having a masters in pharmacology is hard to beat, lol! I just wanted to say thank you for your post, candorean. As someone who has been patronized and preached to far too many times about the dangers of meth, I truly appreciate your scientific and unbiased information.

				popped my meth cherry nye with gear from H&#039;s swan song shipments.&nbsp; We were pulling out of the driveway for our 6hr trip to nyc and I saw the mailman.&nbsp; Made my wife drive back to check mail.&nbsp; After eating a light dinner I bought some liquor and foil, yeah ghetto style I guess.&nbsp; My wife didn&#039;t want to try so I smoked a little while throwing down some vodka.&nbsp; Took the train into nyc and returned about 1 am, smoked some more than figured out the stimulant factor was long.......&nbsp; laid down at two but didn&#039;t really sleep, pretended to wake up with my wife at 7, forced myself to eat breakfast (my favorite meal).&nbsp; Asked my wife if she was driving first she said yeah, so I was like care if I finish this so we&#039;re not riding with it?&nbsp; She said yeah go ahead.&nbsp; I tried but it was 1/2 g I ordered and there was too much to finish smoking.&nbsp; I threw the rest away, I can see where this could downward spiral......&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I liked the energy/state of mind but I didn&#039;t feel real high at any point maybe for 10-15 minutes after smoking.&nbsp; I was getting mad hits off the foil so I think me technique was good.&nbsp; I did like not feeling all shaky/jittery like crack/iv coke does to me.&nbsp; I felt pretty normal at the end of out 6hr drive and could&#039;ve fell asleep maybe 8hrs after last smoking.<br /><br />I&#039;d probably try again for an event, like music festival or something, smoking was pretty enjoyable but I like crack better.&nbsp; Can anyone compare the IV effects of this vs. coke?&nbsp; Are there bellringers or anything like that huge rush you get from IV coke?

				I havent had vortex meth so I dont know the purity. The first thing you need to do is determine the purity of his meth. PM me if you want to learn different ways to determine purity and I will cut and paste some for you. In the US it is not unheard of for police to seize ice that is 90% pure all the way down to 2% pure. If I was to guess I would say its common for ice to be around 70% pure. If I was you I would take 100mgs over 30 minutes. I feel like everyone&#039;s dosages are really low. If your gunna get high get high.
