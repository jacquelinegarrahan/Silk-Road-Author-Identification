				Has anyone done this?&nbsp; Any tips?&nbsp; Is it worth the risk?&nbsp; I want to take some with me when I head home in a few weeks but I&#039;m not sure what the best way to do it is.

				I think your best bet would be to send it to yourself in the mail a week before you leave. Although it&#039;s unlikely that you would get caught by CATSA I just think it&#039;s better to be safe than sorry :)

				You should be just fine with the old powder in a vitamin capsule, stashed in the bottom of a big thing of them trick. Sending it to yourself would likely be less stressful though.

				I find it amazing!<br /><br />How the fuck can you still go full retard when you have so many options?. (NEVER GO FULL RETARD!) <br /><br />Why the fuck would you risk few good years in prison when you could simply ship them to your address and stay 99.99% safe?<br /><br />Please reconsider your options!

Also, sometimes time slips up on you when you&#039;re on coke and you have to move fast. But, i have to agree. If you can use another option OP, it is highly recommended. It has to be excellent quality coke for you to sneak it on the plane. I wish you the best of luck with the decision you make. Keep us updated.<br /><br /><br />Also, i love your sig thecrackhead.
