				this is just a general observation from having done many colors, shapes and forms of mdma. the darker the color the more visual and trippy the mdma will be in my opinion.&nbsp; the darker colors are the presence of precursors (ex: mda, etc) that tend to blur your vision and make you want to sit down.&nbsp; white mdma is the dance all night long stuff. it has a very hard peak, where as the brown mdma is a more sloppy feeling, white is clear.&nbsp; white mdma has much less of a come down, since there are much less precursors and more mdma hcl.<br /><br />this might be a lamen&#039;s description, someone more intelligent please comment

				The only difference is color, if you want to know quality get it tested in a lab<br /><br />White MDMA and brown can both be crappy, quality depends on how it is made

IIRC completely pure MDMA is clear, and both the white and the tan come from different precursors being left.

				Technically white could be clear that has been crushed&nbsp; :P.&nbsp; But yeah, what eskimo said.&nbsp; Discoloration would stem from impurities.&nbsp; Whether they are from unreacted material or a product of side reactions depends on the reaction.&nbsp; MDA will typically never be a precursor.&nbsp; Sure you could use it to make MDMA but why bother?<br /><br />Crystals not powder is always a good sign.&nbsp; Even if the crystals are discolored it&#039;s probably just superficial.&nbsp; Clear and odorless would be the best.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed molly has a slight sassafrasy smell if it hasn&#039;t been recrystallized (even when it&#039;s high purity).&nbsp; Most discoloration can be removed with an acid/base style work-up (that often gets neglected in many reactions even though it should be standard... I&#039;ve skipped it before&nbsp; :-[).
