				i wanted to get your guy&#039;s opinions on dxm/ your experiences with it/ lasting effects (if present from the drug).<br /><br /><br />my reasoning of at least wanting to get some kind of input on this is as follows.<br /><br />there&#039;s a lot of internet literature (well not really literature but a lot of really bad drug rehab websites or psuedo forums full of people who can&#039;t spell) describing instances where people who were occasional users developing lasting negative side effects (severe depression, HPPD, almost psychosis symptoms, etc) after short periods of time. there have also been stories (erowid, various reports) of people with dxm habituation or previous habituation (myself included) but a pretty nice chunk of these reports from people i&#039;ve previously talked to/befriended didn&#039;t report lasting negative effects following cessation.<br /><br />i took dxm pretty much daily for about 8 months following heroin cessation. kind of as an attempt to ween myself away without having to use methadone (which i&#039;ve heard horrible things about) and buprenorphine (which has always made me fucking sick no matter how small the dose and how long it had been since i&#039;d taken opiates). doses were generally around 500-700 mgs in the beginning then a switch to the polistyrex probally about 3 months in due to longer suppression of opiate withdrawls. average doses were between 1200-1800 mgs (usually 1800). <br /><br />my reason for highlighting my own feats in being a freak who pounded cough syrup is that the doses were pretty significant and i personally have never had any negative long lasting effects from my previous use.<br /><br />what are your guy&#039;s stories? have you had complications (liver/kidney/heart damage) or any other crazy fucked up lingering side effects and is there really any truth to the plethora of just mong english written reports of people becoming vegetables or crazy about their &#039;cousin&#039; or whatever. also do you guys believe it really is as dangerous as a lot of people saying it is (discounting serotonin syndrome as a cause of interactions with different drugs) (and also obviously the risk of death increases with dose. i am asking in general with dxm intoxication).<br /><br />i&#039;m also going to say i&#039;m not at all a cheerleader for the drug anymore if that&#039;s how i come across. <br /><br />another serious note: how funny are youtube trip reports with people showing off their stashes of otc cold medicine and ranting about infected mushroom and the universe

				I always keeps a stash of DXM around in my &quot;Opiate Withdrawal Kit&quot; because I find that moderate doses of DXM keep me spaced out when going through heroin withdrawals.

				I&#039;m not sure about DXM for opiate withdrawl, but I took DXM about 2 grams a day for around a year half a decade ago.<br />The only long lasting side effect I recall is being able to close my eyes and VIVIDLY see anything I thought about. Whether it be dragons, race cars, myself getting shot and dying on a bridge, anything.<br /><br />These closed eye visuals lasted for a few months after cessation, and stopped eventually, but it was pretty intense while it lasted.

				I&#039;ve taken about 90 mgs and did a few bags of dope once it was pretty relaxing.<br /><br />The best one to buy OTC in US&nbsp; in most places is the Robitussin 15mg gel caps. They only have DXM in them, none of the Guafenisen or that shit. <br /><br />You get 20 in a box so 20 x 15 = 300mgs , which should be more than enough for a decent trip. <br /><br />Be careful with combinations though

				I did DXM (Tussin, CCC, and Delsym but eventually moving onto pure powder, always orally) 1 - 3 times a week for about 6 months a decade ago, 2nd plateau mostly, and by the end the trips just weren&#039;t the same visually.&nbsp; NMDA downregulation I always guessed.&nbsp; I definitely felt like there were long lasting speech-slurring effects after I stopped using it.&nbsp; Personally I wouldn&#039;t recommend it beyond a couple of usages, maybe not even that.&nbsp; I always mixed with weed and also with acid a couple times which is a crazy experience.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll find my trip reports from that and post &#039;em.<br /><br />Olney&#039;s Lesions were always the concern back in the day however I see on wikipedia that Olney&#039;s Lesions have NOT been found in rats administered DXM HBr orally so that&#039;s certainly good news.<br /><br /><br />edit: CLEARNET LINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olney%27s_lesions<br />

				While I never used it for opiate/opioid withdrawal I did use it quite a bit back in my dissociative days. I really never noticed any long lasting side effects but occasionally got a next day hangover (although sometimes I got an afterglow). I really didn&#039;t like it, seems to be one of the dirtiest of the NMDA antagonists, just the easiest available.<br /><br />Do not use triple C&#039;s as you can have some lasting damage from the chloripheneramine maleate (acts as a bit of a blood thinner, and anticholinergic).<br />I am sure there can be lasting side effects from it as with any NMDA antagonist. Despite some controversy regarding the validity of olnies lesions, there is without a doubt quite a few people reporting some form of cognitive deficit following serious daily abuse of NMDA antagonists.

				I have the feeling DXM has something unique - its just a feeling, as I never tried MXE or Ketamine before so I can&#039;t judge. Well technically, it&#039;s the only drug that blocks one specific dopamine receptor iirc...<br /><br />I originally wanted to use it to reduce my amph tolerance, but I ended up experiencing two trips one in the 1st and one close to 3rd plateau, which was amazing so I&#039;m planning to do this more often ;)<br /><br />Nice thread :)

				DXM does do something unique. It has effects on dopamine and serotonin instead of just the glutamate system. That being said, its the NMDA antagonism that is helping with addiction and lowers tolerance.

				We&#039;re talking about robo tripping here right?&nbsp; If so, I have had some good experiences with it, I haven&#039;t done it in years because it doesn&#039;t really compare to a shrooms trip.&nbsp; I had some difficult experiences with it, where I had trouble really moving, I took about 20 robitussin caps and went to high school and felt paralyzed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very interesting day to say the least.&nbsp; It is a fun time, I think you have to do it in moderation because it will really hit you hard if you take enough, I&#039;m talking walking sideways like a robot forreal.&nbsp;

				DXM capsules indeed. <br /><br />Cough syrup containing dxm often contains so much sugar that it will make you sick drinking an effective amount of it. Capsules are another story though, since you can take 10 or 20 of those to get a beneficialHe effect without ingesting a couple of pounds of sugar in the process.<br /><br />In the netherlands tablets of 7.5/15 mg DXM are available as OTC medication for coughs. These are not cheap opiates though, as the price for a box/strip of 10 of such 7.5 mg capsules is $10&nbsp; retail. On the other hand there is no real restriction on how many you can buy,&nbsp; since these are over the counter medications and are not registered - you could simply pick up a one or two week dose at one pharmacy and get another at the next.

				I began using DXM pretty young, and pretty regularly for about two and half years on the weekends. I lucked out cause some kid in my small town had pure dxm powder, all it took was a half gram with a shot of water to get going. Other times I pounded cough syrup or took a lot of pills to get the same effect. I am also not a cheerleader for the drug like OP said. The downsides were definitely itchiness, hot flashes, and I couldnt for the life of me get stimulated ever while I was on it. This made me begin to wonder if one long term effect may have been a low libido as I have had in the past, but it couldve been the depression too its hard to say for sure. <br />The only really bad trip Ive ever had was on dxm and some other research chemical I was stupid enough to take, not knowing at all what it was though my friend claimed it was a derivative of dxm. Anyways, intense vomiting, wild hallucinations, and impaired movement, loss of balance occured that night and I tripped for about all together somewhere like 12 hours. The next day I had an interview to go to a new school that my parents really wanted me to go to. Needless to say I blew that interview pretty bad, I would have given anything to know what the guy interviewing me thought lol, I looked so strung out and even walked straight into the side of the door frame on my way into his office. I dont recommend DXM to anyone or RC&#039;s for that matter. <br />

				<br />Yes velvet is very helpful in dealing with addictions.<br />Ibogaine is notorious for its addiction breaking properties.<br />It belongs to the nmda antagonists class either.<br />These are not drugs but precious remedies.<br /><br />Dissociatives thread &gt;&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32861<br /><br />Sure enough the diss state is very unique, it strips your soul to the very core.
