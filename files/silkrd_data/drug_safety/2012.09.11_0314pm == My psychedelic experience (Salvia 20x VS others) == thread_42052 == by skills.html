				Yesterday i tried for the first time Salvia Divinorum, and boy, let me say that i was sent to another reality.<br /><br />i&#039;d like to hear from you all, about comparisons between Salvia and other psychedelics :)<br /><br />But first, let me talk about my background with psychedelics. I&#039;ve tried LSD a few times, i&#039;ve tried DMT, and i&#039;ve even had hallucinations with mdma (weak ones). I&#039;m not a regular user of psychedelics, i&#039;ll do it like 4 or 5 times a year max.<br /><br />About the Salvia, that is completely legal in my country, have never tried it before and my friends told me it was mind blowing.<br /><br />First hit: made me feel heavy as hell, it was very physical and in terms of visuals i wasn&#039;t feeling much at start. After a few seconds i felt like i was breaking into little pieces but again, only sensations and not much of visuals. A few seconds later i was laughing so hard i couldn&#039;t breathe, it was funny as hell. I started moving my arms and they looked like snakes but again, not very intense in terms of visuals. It gave me the sensation of heaviness for a few minutes more (10-15 min). This sensation is good, i was stumbling in the room and laughing.<br /><br />second hit: After a few more minutes i tried the second hit with the pipe having more salvia this time and me wanting more of it.<br />Man, that smoke is hard to keep, i took a giant hit, and another one ready after. I started coughing very badly, i thought i was about to puke, and then BAM!!! I was laying down on the sofa, starting to laugh and this time the visuals started to get VERY intense!<br /><br />I hope that from now on i can make some sense , i was laying down, looking to the sealing of a very nice arabic tent, and i forgot who i was and what was i doing, laughing all the time and the tent started to fade into little humans , hundreds of them and i was saying to myself : <br />&quot;Where are those people going? should i join them? I&#039;m lost and i don&#039;t know where i am. Who am i? What is going on?&quot; I can&#039;t remember if i spoke during the high. <br /><br />This was one intense, very pleasant experience. I loved it!<br /><br />But now having all the facts straight, this is a very, very potent drug (i&#039;ll talk about comparisons bellow), you can&#039;t enjoy the trip as you would in acid, because you can&#039;t even stand up and walk. <br />The visuals are MUCH MORE intense than a good acid trip, you would need to take like 4 or 5 tabs of really good acid before you loose your ego and probably you would not get the same intense experience. I didn&#039;t knew who i was at some point.<br /><br />It&#039;s not as fulfilling and spiritual experience as DMT, but if you tried DMT and you think is visually intense, man, salvia will rip you off this reality so hard i can&#039;t even explain to you.<br /><br /><br />Overall: It&#039;s a very nice experience, loved it. It&#039;s a fun psychedelic to try with the closest friends on a relaxing environment.

				Once upon a time in the land of dark and snow, on a cold winter night. I pulled a little 15x salvia divinorum out of this little package I had bought online from some website that sold legal high herbs and such. I had been out of reefer for awhile and wanted to catch a buzz. I had never seen any of the utube videos and didn&#039;t know anything about it other than it was legal and you could supposedly catch a buzz with it. <br />No one at home other than myself, sometime around midnight I load a bit into my pipe and light it up and take a couple big hits.<br />The next thing I can remember is the salvia hits me like a bolt of lightning. I threw the pipe and proceeded to enter the weird world of salvia divinorum.<br />No slow creeping buzz, just a thunderclap and I&#039;m in bizarreville. I can remember letting out some strange laugh and from there my memory gets pretty strange.<br />I can remember a couple of insect/alien beings judging my life to be basically worthless and some other strange phenomena that I wouldn&#039;t even attempt to explain.<br />I have previously done lsd, shrooms and peyote so I have little bit of psychedelic context.<br />Other than the intense bizarreness there was absolutely nothing pleasant about the experience whatsoever. I did feel when it was over (probably lasted about a half hour) that it was one of the most intense experiences of my life.<br />Personally I wouldn&#039;t recommend salvia to anyone.<br />If given the choice smoke another bowl of salvia or shove a bowling ball up my ass I&#039;d choose the bowling ball.

				Salvia scares the shit out of me to this day and I find it spiritually damaging at times.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very unpredictable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very, &#039;set and setting? Fuck that!&#039;

				Salvia is my least favorite drug. Every time I&#039;ve tried it its just been incredible painful and I mean physically painful. I don&#039;t understand how anyone can have a good trip on it.

				here&#039;s a trip report i wrote in 2001:<br /><br />0.375mg of xanax was ingested orally and 0.125 was snorted roughly 20 minutes before the trip to help counteract anxiety...2 cartridges of nitrous were also consumed immediately before the trip...<br />setting:<br />my friend&#039;s garage...car parked on my left hand side...concrete floor...garage was dimly lit by sunlight leaking thru cracks and the small windows on the garage door...no music...tripsitter sat there quietly for the duration of the trip...<br />mindset:<br />&quot;let&#039;s do this...&quot;<br />dosage: 1/5th gram of 6x extract...<br />the experience:<br />all the acid and shrooms in the world cannot pepare you for the power of salvia divinorum...<br />i&#039;m kind of in a state of hysteria, amazement, astonishment, and somewhat disbelief of what just happened...i will try to remember wha exactly happened in chronological order...but my memories of the trip are kinda fragmented so please bear with me...there are no words sufficient enough to describe my experience...<br />i had the bong loaded in front of me...i did 2 cartridges of nitrous to prepare myself for the trip...as soon as the nitrous wore off i hit the bong...all i remember of the real world at that point were my lips lifting off the bong and the bong just melting and being swept away like grains of sand being blown away by the wind...instantly i was in a new world...there was no transition...it felt like i had been in this world the whole time and that reality never existed...reality was forgotten...i felt a sensation of being swept aside...my ego was gone...i was no longer a person...i looked at myself and i was a bristle on a broom...each time i was swept aside...my feet felt like they were dragging on the floor...i felt as a bristle on a broom would feel as it were sweeping the floor...the next thing that happened is kind of hard to explain...but i was piece of rubber on a tire...i was like a lil rubber molecule lined up next to other molecules in the tire...all of a sudden i got this sensation like i was doing cartwheels...the tire was rotating...me and the rest of the molecules were lined up shoulder to shoulder...and our feet would be the part of the tire closest to the outside...anyway...the tire was rotating and everytime my body would touch the asphalt...it would be shredded away...i watched as my fellow molecules were being shredded down as well...first my feet got shredded...then my legs...then my abdomen...this continued till the asphalt shredded thru my shoulder...i could feel the asphalt grind thru my arm...thru my shoulder...thru my back...and thru my chest...and the flesh that was torn off was a dark greenish black which looked exactly like shredded tire rubber...brief flashes of reality penetrated the trip...i saw my wallet, lighter, nitrous cartridges, cracker, and balloon lying on the floor but i did not recognize what they were...i looked at my trip sitter and i did not recognize that he was a person either...he was just another bristle on the broom like me...then i heard a voice saying something about &quot;now you know what a broom feels like&quot; then i said something like &quot;we are all bristles on a broom&quot;...slowly...reality started coming back to me...familiar things took shape again...i remembered that i was a person...i looked at my tripsitter and i still did not recognize if he was real or not...it felt backwards coming back...instead of feeling like i was leaving the trip and heading back to reality...it felt like the trip was reality and reality was the trip...although i had gained conscious vision again...i still wasn&#039;t sure if it was all real...even my tripsitter did not look real...i was so confused...i recall myself trying to talk to my tripsitter as reality reintegrated...i wasn&#039;t even sure if i was really talking to him or if it was part of the trip...i touched the floor to make sure it was real...i looked at my arms and shoulders and squeezed them them with my own hands to make sure they were really there...it felt like a zillion acid and shroom trips compressed into 5 minutes...<br />so basically...i lived the life of a bristle on a broom and a piece of rubber on a tire in my trip...the only colors i remember seeing during the peak were yellow, red, orange, and a dark greenish black...i have no idea if my eyes were open or closed during the whole trip...<br />there was one point where i felt fear trying to surface...but it seemed like the salvia bitchslapped my ego and told it to shut up or the xanax i took earlier held back that feeling so that emotion disappeard quickly...other than that there were no emotions in the trip that i recall of...<br /><br />epilogue:<br />it is now the day after the trip...approximately 2 hours after the trip i left my friend&#039;s house and went home...when i got home i fell asleep [around 3pm or so]...the sleep was deep and restful...i know i had lucid dreams but i do not recall what they were about...i woke up to the sound of my cell phone around 11:30 that night...it was my girlfriend...after i finished talking to her i went online until around 2 in the morning...i then went back to sleep...once again the sleep was deep and restful...i awoke around 9am...i felt reborn...or perhaps cleansed...i have come to many interpretations of my trip from the point where it ended up until now...and i continue to understand more and more as time goes by...i have come to understand the following...<br />1. i am not alone in this world...although my life and experiences are unique to me as an individual...there maybe another out there experiencing the same thing i am...perhaps in some other place or some other time...the things that happen to me have probably happened to somebody else already...we are all bristles in a broom...i am just one of many...<br />2. there is nothing one can do to stop what destiny, fate, or karma has planned for us...certain things are inevitable...all we can do is watch and wait for our turn...what goes around comes around...to be a piece of rubber on a tire...all you can do is wait for your turn to hit the asphalt...and you cannot stop the asphalt from grinding you down to nothing...<br />3. everything has it&#039;s value...no matter how big or how small...i gained appreciation for things we normally take for granted...i considered every speck of dust on the floor...how they must feel as my foot steps on them...how my foot crushes some and picks up others...how only a few steps for me could be miles away or even worlds over for them...and how big i am compared to them...this is what God must feel like...i am just like a speck of dust to Him...but i am still one of many...<br />there are memories of the trip which are resurfacing right now which i forgot about yesterday...i am trying to piece them together but they are too vague to do so...my conscious mind cannot comprehend them anymore...<br />i have reverence for Salvia Divinorum now...reverence that only experience could provide...<br /><br />i am still trying to remember and piece together what happened when the trip initially hit...it&#039;s all a vague blur now...all i remember is that it felt like i was being cut down and then sprouted again...cut down then sprouted again...i died then was reincarnated...died again and was reincarnated again...it was a weird cycle of dying and being reborn over and over again until i became a bristle on a broom...it felt like i was a blade of grass being mowed then growing back or a hair being cut then growing back or a leaf on a tree turning brown and falling off and then becoming a new leaf sprouting and growing back in it&#039;s place...but still i am not sure what happened during the initial impact of the trip...also i recall something me being a part in some ancient machine which runs the universe...that destroys and creates as needed...<br />the word &quot;i&quot; did not even exist at this point in the trip...i&#039;m only using it right now as a reference point for the real world...<br />right now...either there are no words sufficient enough to describe the experience or my mind isn&#039;t sufficient enough to comprehend it...<br /><br />i am now starting to recall parts of the lucid dream i had the night after my Salvia trip... <br />i was driving home and for some reason i was in a hurry...i saw the intersection coming up ahead but there was traffic...i saw that i could pass on the right to get ahead of the traffic so i did...but as i passed the traffic and came to the intersection i saw a sign which said [DETOUR ROAD CONSTRUCTION AHEAD] and the other cars were being directed towards this detour...when i saw that i slammed on the brakes but it was too late...i was going too fast to stop...the intersection was being paved with fresh hot asphalt...it felt like my tires melted and i skidded across the intersection...somehow i made it home after that and i pulled in my driveway...i got out of my car to take a look at the damage...3 of my tires were fine...one of them was shredded away...down to the rim...and even the rim was damaged too...it looked like the rim was ground down to almost the axle...it was no longer round and now flat on one side...the damage to that wheel looked irreplacable... <br />then i woke up...

				I haven&#039;t smoked Salvia in a year now, and probably will never touch it again. Not that I had a &#039;bad&#039; experience, it is just too _weird_ for my taste.<br /><br />A close friend smoked it the first time and was transported to what he describes was hell. Rivers of fire, dark skies with screeching monsters, the works. I was with him at that time and there is no way he could have faked the story. He was fully stretched out on the floor, screaming his guts out that something is gonna devour me.. lol.<br /><br />Another buddy tripped on Salvia and he was transported to a past event in his life.<br /><br />In my own experience I found Salvia to be very spiritual, the first couple of time it dismembered my body into tiny bits, but the last time I tried it I felt a really powerful female presence and it freaked me out bad. I was literally talking to &#039;her&#039; and sharing my troubles. Neither of these trips were therapeutic in the same sense LSD or Psilocybin are. I remained pretty shaken for weeks after that, and the stench of Salvia ruined my favorite bowl :(

				Tried it maybe 3-4 years ago a few times and never had a bad trip on it but always been really really strange and I still have some left somewhere but don&#039;t really have any interest in doing it again. I feel lucky to have not had a bad trip on it but i&#039;m sure its just a matter of time with that stuff!

				I have tried Salvia a few times and each time the effects seemed stronger. Later I read somewhere that a so called &quot;reverse tolerance&quot; applies with salvia. So unaware of that, I was home, bored during a summer afternoon and I thought a little bit of salvia may get me in a nice meditative state. My previous experiences had been quite mild, so I thought nothing could go wrong. Wrong. <br /><br />I put a bit of extract in my pipe, started inhaling and as I put the pipe down, I started to feel it. It was like I was being pulled leftwards, so I sat down and then the room started to fade away. The left &quot;side&quot; of my vision turned into a dark, long corridor with various growth on the walls while the right &quot;side&quot; remained my room for a while, but it soon disappeared and turned into a wall with hundreds of doors. I opened one of the doors and then my vision partially returned to my real room and there I saw my own hand, entering the room...Jeesus! Then the trip turned even wilder. There was no me, I didn&#039;t know who I was, where I was and what was going on. I simply visited various, crazy places. Then I suddenly &quot;woke up&quot; in a completely different room, surrounded by unknown people. I was freaked out because I was sure that my whole life I have known was just a dream and that I just woke up into reality. The scariest, most frightening and depressing moment of my life. After that, I returned to the real world and calmed down. All this seemed like a long time, but all of this happened in just 3 MINUTES!!<br /><br />I never touched salvia again. This experience was so intense, that even today, 2 years after the experience, I question the reality surrounding me. This is a drug that deserves a lot of respect.
