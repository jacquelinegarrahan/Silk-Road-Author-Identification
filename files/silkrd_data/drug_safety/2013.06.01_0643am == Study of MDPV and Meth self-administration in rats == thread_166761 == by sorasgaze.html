				I found this and thought it was interesting. It&#039;s kinda old but whatever. A study was done on the self-administration of MDPV and Methamphetamine in rats.<br />(CLEARNET) http://tlneuro.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/34-methylenedioxypyrovalerone-mdpv-bath-salts-is-a-potent-reinforcer-with-significant-abuse-liability/<br />Look at the rate of which the rats pressed the lever for the MDPV over the Meth. <br />Those rats must have been seeing shadow rats and were tweaked out as fuck.

				Makes sense from my experience with the two. MDPV was nice for like 10 minutes before taking me on a nose dive plunge into hell and the anxious abyss. Its there that you have a choice: redose or though it out. Thank fuck I knew better than to redose. The poor rats don&#039;t knew better.<br /><br />Plus a dose of legit meth makes your feel amazing for 6-8 hrs or more without needing to redose. You can keep that up for days on end. <br /><br />The difference with meth from mdpv is that your not running from hell with meth... you&#039;re chasing a long lasting and satisfying bliss. No hell really.

				Yeah, I agree. I&#039;ve been to the hospital from MDPV binges. With some stuff, you just have to learn the hard way. The psychosis I had was so bad I thought there were military soldiers sleeping in the other room and they were mad at me for making so much noise and said I had to be transferred to &quot;Sargent Daniels&quot;, and I was picturing, for some reason, Justin Bieber cutouts pasted on the window. At one point, I believed someone was outside and called the cops and bomb squad saying I had a drug lab and weapons of mass destruction. LOL... <br /><br />I ended up flushing the rest which was more than half remaining. Scary thing is, I only paid 7 dollars for it. I haven&#039;t touched it since, up to 20 days after that, I was having lucid nightmares, most of them were about PV. Fuck that shit, it&#039;s good in low doses but I lost my control with it after giving up on sleep the first night and ended up redosing. I wish they&#039;d do a toxicity study, I&#039;m interested in seeing if it&#039;s more neurotoxic than meth.

				Dude, that&#039;s pretty extreme shit! But I can totally see how pv could bring someone there real easy.<br /><br />&quot;...and I was picturing, for some reason, Justin Bieber cutouts pasted on the window.&quot;<br /><br />Maybe this was influenced by the Bieber cutout in the corner? j/k&nbsp; ;D<br />He looks like he was binging on his trip around the glance recently from the paparazi shots Ive seen in magazines not long ago!<br /><br />I have little doubt that it&#039;s more neurotoxic than meth. Definitely a better propensity that&#039;s psychosis. I&#039;d take a 6 day meth bender with SRs cheapest and shittiest meth (I have and it sucks) over a single dose of MDPV every single times off I had to choose. <br /><br />Funny that you flushed your bag. I did too, as did everyone I&#039;ve ever spoken about mdpv with. It really boggles my kind that some people enjoy the stuff.<br /><br />It gave me a shitty outlook on RCs for the longest time (until I tried mephedrone).

				Hasn&#039;t everyone had a woman in their life that they were damn sure was killing them, but you keep going back over and over again. MDPV is a seductive mistress. Yes, she&#039;s full of break the whole fucking world dysphorian hell. But she&#039;s still sexy as hell. And she&#039;s a filthy fucking slut. Sometimes you really want a filthy fucking slut, that knows just how dirty she is. And sometimes you just need to keep hitting the feeder bar.<br /><br />What&#039;s a baker act between friends?<br /><br />Meth is so much classier than MDPV. She&#039;s a mighty fine dame.<br /><br />And when she&#039;s good, she&#039;s very, very good...<br /><br />But what can I say. I&#039;m a promiscuous drug user. <br /><br />Oh, and I&#039;ve never been able to get half a key of meth at $4 a gram pre-ban.<br /><br />

Yeah, the first RC I ever tried was Methylone and that amazed me. I took that before I experienced MDMA. I enjoy MDPV during the first or second dose, then I start watching porn, do more, get really paranoid, etc. LOL. It tends to make me really annoying and type PARAGRAPHS to people, just explaining everything in perfect detail with perfect grammar. lol <br /><br />Mephedrone? Eh, I got a sample from the UK, but I read on the forums that the vendor cut his Mephedrone with MSG. I did the entire gram in one night with no effects. The vendor must have been extremely fucking stupid because it had a 90-10% cut, barely any Mephedrone at all, and he did that with samples? If I was planning on cutting shit, I&#039;d at least give some pure samples then maybe cut it at a reasonable percentage. It was extremely disappointing and ruined my interest in Mephedrone until I heard the vendor was cutting it. I&#039;d like to get a pure gram but there&#039;s currently no domestic vendors except for googleyed, but I&#039;d rather buy 2g of Methylone over a g of Mephedrone. Haha.
