				I am a new drug user with little experience who came on SR out of curiosity. After trying a couple of things from here with moderately positive results, I have then come to try out an lsd blotter. It was an experience I never wanted to have. It felt evil. The worst feeling in my mind I ever had in my life. I was lucky I was watched over by a good caring friend, otherwise I would have jumped out the window.<br /><br />I wish I had known it can be this bad. I also wish I had known it doesn&#039;t suit everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;ve now burnt all other drugs I had ordered from SR and intent to never come back to drugs. To leave it all behind and forget about it.<br /><br />Good luck newcomers and curious lurkers, and be EXTREMELY careful.

				Sorry to hear about your bad trip, I had my first LSD trip last week and absolutely loved it. Maybe your dosage was too high? How high did you dosage your trip?

				Yeah man, if it&#039;s not too raw of a topic post up some details. I&#039;ve had bad trips turn bad, but never to the point where I give up on all drugs forever.<br /><br />You&#039;re dead right about these things not being for everyone, but if you want to make this an effective warning you may want to give some more information.

				My first 5 trips were bad trips, so worth it all though. <br />I&#039;ve come to embrace them.<br /><br />But only recently, it was like 6 months of saying &#039;damn, hope I don&#039;t get another one of them!&#039;<br /><br />Became desireless, now I can&#039;t even have a bad trip, because there is no bad or good.

				Set and setting are fundamental and you probably didn&#039;t prepare either.&nbsp; Hell you might have been in a pissed off mood that day before taking LSD (bad idea).<br /><br />Naughty naughty though, these drugs are not meant to be treated lightly, they&#039;re POWEFUL tools for your mind and like everyone&#039;s saying, you gotta read and read and read, even if just reading doesn&#039;t &#039;tell&#039; you what you think your experience is going to be like it provides very important information such as you should always have valium or another benzo on hand if a trip goes bad.<br /><br />I feel bad for you though man, not trying to rip into you.&nbsp; Maybe being scared away from drugs is a good thing, they&#039;re definitely not usually cheap !

				maybe 15 years back I was a young man and thought nothing can beat me, like many party people friends of me, too.<br />We threw in all kind of substances we found. Never had a bad trip. Ok after maybe 5 days without sleep we got some psychotic disorders but well this will not kill us.<br />We loved to surf on the edge, just close to the OD and looked how far we can get. Nothing can beat us and we lost fear.<br /><br />And then there was this Sunday. <br />Ha I was raving from Friday on to Sunday and then chilled somewhere. I took 2 hits of &quot;puple ohms&quot; and one &quot;miraculix&quot; and everything went wrong. (had lsd many many times before I even sold this shit. I was so fucking sure LSD will never hurt me, it simply can not.)<br /><br />Believe me or not. This single trip showed me the terror, just fear of FEAR can show you. I begged to god (and I dont believe) just to end it. I just wanted to be dead. Not in my wildest dreams I could imagine what a bad trip is. Time stopped and does not feel like I will go mad or my head explode. Ha! lol no, I knew it is over now I will never be the same and could not stop the loops. <br /><br />I call this day the day I died on L.<br /><br />A friend found me and was on my side later, till I became a bit more real again. At this day if I had a clue how; I had killed my self just to stop it.<br /><br />After that, every single time I took LSD I automatically slipped in this state of fear. Milder but none of the trips after this were enjoyable. I feared the fear. So I stopped psychs..<br /><br />Years later my GF asked me to try LSD with me because of the stories my friends told about the good old times and she nerver did it before.<br />We did it (very low.. very very low maybe 50-80µg) and she had fun while I fought my demons. <br />Of cause she said something like &quot;he?! this is it, really this is the shit you are scared of? come on you are a pussy&quot; or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />Long story short I organized some liquid L (50 drops maybe 100-130µg per drop) and shoot our mind out. I went through the whole thing and won against the demons. It was a few days and the vile was empty (with some dex-amph) we took up to 10 drops on day 3 just to feel anything. I laughed I cried I had this fear I had sex I fought against my own self. And the resolution was to give up. I just accepted everything especially me and my not so nice parts of me, the evil ones.<br /><br />This was the returning point. Since then I dont fear my &quot;love&quot; anymore. Since this day I know which doors I better not open, not at 50µg nor at 400µg. <br /><br />My conclusion is &quot;One has to die once to full understand how powerful psychedelics are and begin to respect them.&quot;<br /><br />Something that can show you Love and Euphoria and give you the opposite, too.<br /><br />And yes I know (now) that it was not the LSD, it was me and my own problems in my own head. But without LSD .... who knows maybe nothing ever had happened or maybe someday Mr. Hyde had shown up.<br /><br />So,<br />take care<br />12345 <br /><br /><br />

I have experienced this sober and the fear of fear is one of the worst fears imaginable. It&#039;s created completely in your mind and therefore knows no limits. It can make you cry, it can make you run, it can make you freeze. I learned how to handle it though. My way was different and a bit longer, but the result was the same: accept it. It&#039;s a part of you, it won&#039;t kill you. Once you fully understand that, you can live with it. That shit on acid doesn&#039;t sound like fun at all. Depending on where I am and whom I am with I&#039;d go through it though, must have an intense healing effect. <br /><br />I always keep some benzos ready for me and my trip-buddies, just in case something like this happens in a situation we can&#039;t escape. Never used one so far, don&#039;t plan to either. I think if I can get out into nature by myself, put my ipod on, get mindful/meditating I can get quite through some storm. But if I don&#039;t have that, like in the middle of a city with tons of people and noise, it could get ugly. That&#039;s the only thing I can actually imagine that could go very wrong. I have read quite a few horror-trip stories but besides getting anxious I can&#039;t relate to them. Most of the time I think people are just not &#039;respecting&#039; the drug and are pushing it. I&#039;d do that if I had some mental issue to work out, but out of boredom?<br /><br />More bad trip stories please... :)

				It&#039;s totally worth re-iterating that hallucinogens are not for everyone. Most of the people who do use them frequently are very relaxed and have some kind of idea what they are looking to get out of it. If you&#039;re that guy and your drop acid, you normally find what you are looking for and it doesn&#039;t take you badly, and even if it does, you just find out something different. <br /><br />I am not that guy. All the times I have used psychodelics it has been more like a serious head injury than a journey of self discovery. They just are not for everyone. <br /><br />Almost no drugs are really for everyone. They all work as advertised, but everyone has a niche of what really suits them. You ever met people who didn&#039;t like to get drunk ? Drugs are the same deal, it just doesn&#039;t click with them.

				Its unfortunate that things went that way, but judging from the dosages i see here on SR, you probably should have cut that blotter in half. The threshold dose is 20 micrograms, some of the blotters here total in 300-500 micrograms. I know that some vendors add an extra 150 or so to each blotter in case they start to deteriorate in transit. You have had one bad experience, but i advise you to come back to the world of psychedelics. They can change your life in ways you&#039;d never understand otherwise. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be safe<br /><br />Shifty

				I get the same feeling of deep regret and wanting to burn all my drugs almost every time I take DMT. It&#039;s a very strong hallucinogen and once you&#039;ve taken the 3-4 hits, there&#039;s no way back but to ride out the trip, no matter how good/bad it might be. I&#039;m thankful that DMT wears off so quickly (10 minutes to normality), I can&#039;t imagine being in hell that was some trips for longer than that.<br /><br />Of course when I&#039;m back to normal, I don&#039;t end up burning the drugs but rather relax and try to reflect on what happened.
