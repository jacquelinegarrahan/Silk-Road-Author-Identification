				So I&#039;m already halfway through my first batch of DMT... <br /><br />0 Succesful tries.<br /><br />Tried the light bulb vape, no luck.<br /><br />Got the Silver Surfer, tried low,mid and high settings, can barely get any type of smoke going and no effects. <br />Is there some type of noob thing I&#039;m doing wrong and don&#039;t realize??

				the simplest, most foolproof method for smoking dmt is simply sandwiching it between layers of weed (preferably in a bong). makes it very easy to break through. the most important thing is to remember to hold the smoke in your lungs for at least 15 seconds!

				Having wasted my supply of DMT I must have done 2-3 hours of reading on this subject. A few thoughts.<br /><br />First, this is extremely common.<br /><br />Second, your temp has to be just right. Too high and you scorch the spice. Too low and you may just dose yourself enough to ruin further chances this hour (see third, below).<br /><br />Third, you get one shot at this per attempt. If you get a slight dose (wrong temp, or wrong method), you&#039;re going to get some very minor effects, and then (EDIT) *not* be able to properly blast off for the next hour.<br /><br />People recommend a variety of approaches - simple glass and torch is very popular. There is the &quot;machine&quot; (search for it). You can also vape - the aforementioned weed sandwich method is recommended here - but again, your temp has to be right and your methods spot on or it won&#039;t work. A couple of people swear by the Volcano as a &quot;foolproof&quot; method here - &quot;it&#039;s almost too easy&quot;. I&#039;m looking to get one anyway so I&#039;m holding off wasting any more spice till then and taking the easy way out.

				Don&#039;t use weed, it diminishes the effects. It might work, but won&#039;t be as strong of a trip. Best method i&#039;ve found (after wasting a few hits) is to use a bubbler or a small bong. Water filtration gets rid of the nasty taste and burning throat. Get some screens and put a few layers on the bottom of the bowl to prevent the liquid from running down. Then put a screen on top of that and try not to touch the flame to the hit. Take as many rips as you can before you break through. Vape is probably not the best method. Enjoy your journey!&nbsp; ;D

				Geez... so I might of just wasted a good amount of money on a vape....ughhh....great..... I got it so that I don&#039;t have a big ass bong and whatnot, but shit maybe I&#039;ll have to try that this weekend...<br /><br />One last question...would it help if I packed oregano, then dmt,then oregano back on that? Or would I most likely be wasting the DMT like usual.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah I saw the machine as well, just the Silver Surfer looks like a cleaner and healthier way of doing it.

				Well I built my own mini-vape real quick....<br /><br />Threw oregano, then put in the spice, and then some more oregano on top, took 2 hits, felt already getting out of it, when I looked around my room, and my paintings and stuff seemed to be getting bigger and closer to me and my tv was off, but it looked like it almost started to have vein like looks to it...not sure if that was just all the smoke from the oregano or the dmt...<br /><br />Went to go take another few pulls and yeap...my lighter went out...figures..I&#039;ll try again in another few days..

Simply take a few screens sandwich them together, the finer the better. The more screens you have the more the DMT will adhere to them after it is cooled, the easier it will be to take a big hit to break through. I usually also add parsley to allow for a more even burning with less flame as to not burn the spice. Charging your hits is also recommended. Simply apply just enough heat to your DMT so that it melts over whatever your smoking it in. Hold your hits in for as long as possible. At about the 8 second mark during your first hit, you will feel a strong euphoria and you know you&#039;re doing it right, continue to hold it until 15 and exhale. Try to do 2 more hits just like the last one, and make sure to save the biggest hit for last, as I&#039;ve found that really allows me to breakthrough nearly everytime.<br /><br />This is not necessary but I always experience 3 DMT levels:<br /><br />The first being the &#039;everything is alive and conscious around me&#039; stage. Everything will begin to move along with me around me as if we are all connected. Very apparent when looking at grass.<br /><br />The second is the &#039;viewing the barrier stage&#039;. Basically the point where you see the consciousness barrier before your eyes which is what you break through. It always manifests itself as a Chrysanthemum mandala in my experience, just like the one in my profile picture.<br /><br />And finally, the breakthrough. No real words to describe it other than a whooshing and almost sucking sound, breaking thru the barrier and the sound of rustling aluminum foil, and then the rest is generally too profound to describe. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if most experience these DMT &quot;levels&quot;, but know you&#039;re doing it right if you do. I find that breaking through outdoors is the most positive experience. The connectivity you feel to nature and life itself is incredible. Breaking through on a beautiful sunny Summer day has been one of my favorite and profound experiences with any psychedelic.

				DMT can be tricky to smoke. I now use the glass vaporgenie with pretty good results, but when I first started experimenting with it I did waste a lot of spice before my first breakthrough.

				It&#039;s been a long time (about 4yrs now) since I went through a phase of heavy DMT usage/research, but the other day the topic came up w/ a couple friends...&nbsp; <br /><br />Have any of you tried using a hash oil rig w/ a ti nail/skillet?&nbsp; The main concern would be obtaining a precise temp, but nowadays you can buy a relatively accurate infrared thermometer (most commonly used in professional kitchens to check the temp of a pan before throwing a $100 cut of meat onto it) for like $15 online.&nbsp; In theory, it seems like you could figure out the perfect temp w/ some trial and error, grab a precise scoop for how deep you wanted to go, torch the shit outta the ti until it&#039;s red hot, keep the infrared gun on the ti until it reaches the desired temp, and then drop the whole thing on there vaping precisely how much you want at the perfect temp in record time.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Yeah alot of people are talking about Changa, I got to look that up to get more info on what that&#039;s all about.<br /><br />I tried again today, I know alot of people say to get Vaporgenie, but I just want to see if I can get &quot;the key&quot; to work so its small and just looks<br />like 2 normal parts put together.<br /><br />I THINK I almost had a breakthrough today, I didn&#039;t burn any of my stuff after looking over it all. But I can&#039;t get past the euphoria part of it, it gets me soo tired and comfortable I can&#039;t keep on taking hits... What I did see when I looked outside is the grass and everything started to get super twirly and extremely liquified, but thats all&nbsp; I got. Maybe I just need to take way bigger hits since these ones I did today didn&#039;t even bother my lungs...but I feel like I just want to pass out.

There will be no doubt in your mind.<br /><br />I think the mistake made most often is the one you just mentioned there. After the 1st or 2nd toke you begin to get that euphoria and you don&#039;t want to take it any further. That&#039;s exactly when you should be taking your 2nd and 3rd tokes. Once you find your method, you should do the same thing each and every time, and then you&#039;ll find breaking through much easier. I find it to be a very ritualistic process when you get it down pat.<br /><br />The stage you were just describing I experience after inhaling my first toke, nowhere near a real breakthrough. How long are you holding your hits in? Don&#039;t be afraid either. I know there can be some anxiety getting past that first barrier, but just push through it and continue taking your hits, you won&#039;t regret it. If you&#039;re not blowing out decent clouds, something isn&#039;t working right.<br /><br />Oh and the key is very difficult to use in my experience. I probably made the steel wool too dense at the neck of the bottle, but I was never able to get full hits with the key. Always just vapor.

				jmoney-<br /><br />Thats another problem I don&#039;t know with the key...I&#039;m taking in smoke,but I have no idea if thats just the oregano I&#039;m taking in or the DMT. BUT I&#039;m assuming it has to be working if I am getting that euphoria,right?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t got that &quot;burnt plastic&quot; taste, nor bad throat or mouth type &quot;burns&quot;. It&#039;s been extrmely smooth, I can hold hits down for just about as long as I can hold my breath, maybe 20-30 seconds max. But none of it burns or anything. I get no coughing as well.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is kind of why I want to give the key a few more tries, since it&#039;s not harsh on my lungs. When I first tried this all out, I did that lightbulb method and holy hell, that smoke was insanely harsh. I couldn&#039;t even hold it in for more than 5 seconds. <br /><br />Also you mention steel wool...I just used screens and it holds in everything fine, not sure if that makes a difference or what.

				See whenever I inhaled it, it wasn&#039;t really irritating per se, but I definitely get that mothball/burnt plastic type taste. If you&#039;re not tasting it, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re getting enough spice in your hits. Do you have a mg scale and are you measuring your hits? When smoking the product, and I would consider the key smoking due to it&#039;s inefficiency, you generally want to put twice as much spice as you would when vaping. So if it takes you 50mg out of the vape, put 100mg in your pipe. But if you have a scale, weigh it out, and put more than you&#039;d think you would need for a breakthrough.<br /><br />The thing about the key though is the fact that you do not need to put any oregano or any other herb. The steel wool is simply there for the DMT to adhere to after you have melted it and let it cool. Screens aren&#039;t a bad idea, but your spice most likely melts right through them even if they are very fine. Take some steel wool, make sure to burn off whatever finish is on it. It should be charred and black when you&#039;re done. Place it in the neck of the bottle somewhat loosely enough so oxygen flows freely, but tight enough so that the DMT doesn&#039;t drip out. Then all you do is charge your DMT, smoke,&nbsp; and you&#039;re off to experience the realm of hyperspace. If you don&#039;t have much spice for a few attempts, just smoke it as you would a hash on top of some herb in a pipe or bubbler, but make sure to put some screens as well. If you do have spice to spare, then put a copious amount into the key, I&#039;d say anywhere from 150-200mg, and attempt it again and let us know how it goes. Don&#039;t worry about using too much as whatever you don&#039;t use will stay charged in the key.<br /><br />Just make sure to develop a method and stick to it when you do. Hope this helped.

				Well for my key heres what I do:<br /><br />I put around 6 screens on the bottom, put oregano on top of them, then the DMT ( 35-40mg) then oregano back on top of that, then put the top&nbsp; screen to mush it all in. Connected to the key is my tube, its about 2 feet long, I also don&#039;t hold the key horizontal, its vertical so that the DMT really can&#039;t get caught dripping through the mesh. So its basically I hover it over a candle or lighter while taking in hits. So the oregano and DMT doesn&#039;t get torched like this, but I&#039;m not sure if its hot enough to melt the DMT... maybe next time I&#039;ll try double the dosage and manage to keep taking hits when I get tired, or maybe this time around take much bigger hits. <br /><br />I&#039;ll have an update again... I really want to try it again tonight, but not sure if it will work or if I need to wait longer..

				Forget the key altogether then and just use the same method, but using only your tube, as well as double dosage. There is no noticeable tolerance with DMT, so you can try again tonight, but it really depends on your state of mind. Don&#039;t do it if you&#039;re not prepared for whats coming.

				From everything I hear the meth pipe/freebase pipe/&#039;glass rose&#039; pipe is the most foolproof method, the ones that are 3-4&quot; of glass tube with a spherical chamber at the end &amp; a carb on top of the chamber.&nbsp; I use them to smoke hash &amp; synthetics (don&#039;t like syncans but sometimes I need to get baked &amp; run out of hash), they work perfect for any substance that requires slow or indirect heating or anything that gets destroyed too quickly by an open flame.&nbsp; You can buy them online if you can&#039;t find any locally, just search for glass rose pipe or something similar.

				Well after one last try tonight I&#039;ll give up on the key/tube method and will have to buy something else.<br /><br />I did have another question though, lets say I didn&#039;t burn my dmt or it didn&#039;t drip down the tube,etc. Would there still be some left in the key melted to the oregano still?

				what moonflower said. thats the only fool proof method. dont let others confuse u. start sucking as slow as possible to not instantly burn it, and when u feel its almost empty get a last big sucker, hold it in and have a nice ride :)<br /><br />to guarantee a breakthrough take atleast 50 but better 55-57mg (remember a little bit will be burned if u smoke it this way).<br /><br />Special tip: go to the toilette before u do it or u might end up peeing urself.... :D a friend of mine did that last weekend :S poor guy... he said &#039;i piss myself&#039; i thought he said that cuz hes scared of what happening. i said &#039;nono, just let it go, its the dmt&#039; and boom - he let it go. haha (he drank 2 beers an hour before and didnt went to wc before. next time he knows better :D:D)

				Nice thread, sorry OP!&nbsp; I use a volcano, its not cheap, but i crack it up to 9.5 and it bellows out vapor soon as i flip the switch.&nbsp; <br /><br />However i took my first steps on DMT through the sandwich method with works perfectly fine IMO.&nbsp; Just remember to put more weed than on bottom so you have a good buffer zone of weed.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to touch the DMT witht the flame, you merely want to light the top layer of weed and slowly but consistently taking rips to keep a slow roast cherry going.<br /><br />And my understanding of the 3 plateaus, are the first is geographical shapes and patterns, second is the wormhole/gate keeper entity you meet right before, third and final phase the breakthrough where you lose all recognition of self, personally i was on another planet...i was not a biological organism but more a being of light.&nbsp; It was amazing but kinda freaky at the same time....<br /><br /><br />these are just my experiences...DMT is the BEST psychedelic IMO...strongest and more intimate trips, and your back and feel totally back in 15 - 25 min.&nbsp; No body load, but you may be a little speechless from what you just witnessed.&nbsp; At first glance i can definitely see how people relate it to the before death flash before your life.&nbsp; It can be very personal and usually is, but it can also be very sci-fi like also.&nbsp; Not to mention many times i have related the whole experience to an Aztec god contacting me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anywyas DMT is a lot of fun, just be in the right mind right before you go, don&#039;t panic,&nbsp; even if you think you aren&#039;t breathing, because you are, you just have disassociated yourself from your body so much that you can&#039;t feel it.&nbsp; You need to relax and stay calm because a negative emotion can spiral your effect as you smoke, just be humble and accept whatever it shows you, because it is literally the hardest and most intense trip you&#039;ll have...however shroom people always say they have had harder on shrooms, and same for LSD people...but for the amount u see and the come down after i rank DMT by FAR the best psychedelic....

				Bucket Bong def looks really easy!<br /><br />BUT, 2 quick things, wouldn&#039;t the flame hitting the DMT just burn it all? And tin foil...if the tin foil burns, I&#039;ve heard a ton of horrible things about using tin foil to smoke anything... <br /><br />It does seem like a great way to get it all in one massive hit though..

				Shit, I have a gravity bong just chillin at my house, never though of using for the DMT though. I think with a bucket though the smoke would be pretty damn harsh but if it gets me in one go, why not. I will try this in the near future.

I will if I want my trip to have an Italian vibe to it. Meet the spaghetti monster and hang out with Luigi:) <br />I have tried damiana straight up...not a fan. Blends like damiana, mullein, marshmellow, hops... pretty nice. Blue water lily is great... it puts a nice edge on the experience.

				I bought a butane torch lighter and finally broke through with a small bong and the sandwich method. I held the end of the flame a bit away from the bong,&nbsp; just enough to get heat on it rather than flame. The first rip made things start to melt, I had trouble with the second but I managed to get on in.
