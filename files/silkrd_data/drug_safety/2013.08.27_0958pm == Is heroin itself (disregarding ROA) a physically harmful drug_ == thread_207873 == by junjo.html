				Heroin is almost always demonized for being the most dangerous drug in existence, but when you look at all said &quot;dangers&quot; of the drug, they&#039;re almost all solely related to complications from I.V. use.

Yes, it is horribly physically addictive, but other than that, heroin itself doesn&#039;t seem to have any dangerous effects on the body when used in sane amounts.

				Pure diamorphine and most opiates aren&#039;t toxic (they don&#039;t kill cells). Street heroin is probably harmful because of its cutting agents and contaminants though.

				It is the dose that makes the poison, as usual. Large amounts of heroin can kill you quite quickly (respiratory depression, cardiac arrest and such). <br /><br />More reasonable amounts of heroin or other opiates will not do much physical damage at all. The main reason people die due to opiate abuse is the cost of the addiction and the consequences of maintaining the habit. Things like sharing needles that spread disease are essentially also just a cost factor: fresh ones are too expensive.<br /><br />So in reasonable doses it will not be the heroin that will kill you, it will be living on the streets, contracting disease or simple being shot in a deal gone bad. <br /><br />

Heroin has always been just &quot;ok&quot; for me, i&#039;ve never felt the orgasmX1000 feeling as portrayed in the media. It&#039;s just a pretty standard opiate. Oxycontin, once again, isn&#039;t anything godly, but it has something special about it that heroin doesn&#039;t. Oxy IMO is quite a bit more euphoric, but also less sedating, which may be good or bad depending on what you use it for. I think all opiates have some potential for addiction, but you have to be predisposed to it in some way. I&#039;ve consumed opiates, including heroin, for years, but never once experienced physical addiction or withdrawals. If I come across a stash of dope, I will pound it down at an alarming rate, but the second I&#039;m done with it, I can move on my life, and don&#039;t really &quot;fiend&quot; for it.

				I want to quote a bunch of you, but it seems to be from my post down.. SO:<br /><br />I used to get constipated from opiates, but over the years that side affect has seemed to pass. I can still shit daily and consume high amounts of opiates.<br /><br />I do agree oxys have a better euphoria and that awesome full of happy energy to burn a whole shift at work!<br /><br />oxymorphone would be the godly opiate IMO.<br /><br />Addiction varies from person to person in a big way.<br />for example, I am high risk for addiction with just about anything, except alcohol. (hate it)<br />however my cousin takes just as much as me, but he never has a problem with just stopping. (I can&#039;t do that)<br /><br />I do have a question though. How many of you just don&#039;t get a euphoria from snorting heroin?<br />I swear on MANY occasions and with various different vendors even Subsrgood, I would easily burn through 1/2 - 3/4 gram in a few hours and not once get a euphoria, just keeps me from feeling like shit. does this mean my tolerance is that high? hell it takes me 60+mg of oxymorphone snorted to get a euphoria.<br />and I never nod anymore. Used to.. not anymore.&nbsp; <br />I got 10 stamps from a couple vendors and did one.. nothing.. two more... nothing however in a much better mood. in a matter of 2-3 hours I would have snorted all 10 stamps.<br />I need some insight on this.<br /><br />@junjo I have seen WAY more bad shit happen with pharma shit as well. compared to heroin anyway.<br /><br />I can think of a dozen or more drugs that are WAY worse then Heroin. I actually could see living the rest of my life on a regular heroin regimen. Hell look at Leonardo da Vinci - this dude was on opium for much of his life and look how well he did. Edgar Cayce was on opiates and he did good.<br />My point is if you can control it, you can live life happy.

It just makes me tired and almost a bit depressed. Back in the day when I snorted, I would be disappointed every damn time, and just keep taking more until I puked and fell asleep. My ROA of choice for H is plugging, regardless of the stigma associated with it. I get a lot more euphoria through that method, and I think it&#039;s a hell lot less gross than sticking a needle into yourself. For other opiates like Oxy and Hydro, I&#039;ll always just eat them. Nothing really to be gained from snorting filler when they already have great bioavailabilities.

Can&#039;t speak for IVing since I&#039;m terrified of needles though.<br />Basically, I use a 5 mL plastic medicine dropper (kinda looks like a miniature turkey baster) that i bought from walgreens for a whopping 5 bucks<br />I take my H (this works with tar or #4) and swish it back and forth in 5 mLs of warm water in the dropper until it is completely dissolved<br />Next (the most important part), cover the syringe in lotion or lube, whatever you&#039;ve got lyring around, as it makes the next step WAY easier<br />Now, insert the dropper full of your Heroin/Water solution slowly into you-know-where, wiggling it back and forth, until you&#039;re sure it&#039;s about 4-5 inches deep.<br />Lay down on your stomach so the bulb is upright, and squeeze all the contents out, holding the bulb down so you don&#039;t accidentally suck the liquid back in<br />Hold this in place for about 30 seconds, then slowly maneuver the dropper out and put it on a paper towel to your side<br />Continue to lay down for 10-20 minutes to let the H completely absorb, and feel the wonderful rush of it without ever having to touch a needle.<br />Once you&#039;re feeling it, feel free to get up, as it&#039;s not going to come spilling out your ass.<br />And there ya go, that&#039;s how to plug heroin.<br />Make sure to sanitize the syringe with rubbing alcohol and soapy water after each use (even though it&#039;s really not too concerning, considering it&#039;s your own bacteria you&#039;re dealing with).<br />That&#039;s pretty much all there i too it.<br />If you do it right (LUBE!!!), it&#039;s completely painless, miles safer than shooting up, and gives you a slow, but pronounced rush that&#039;s far better than snorting.<br />I think that&#039;s pretty much the extent of it, feel free to ask me questions if you&#039;d like.<br />

				I&#039;ve never tried opiates plugged, butt maybe some day when my veins are all gone.......<br />Works great for MDMA, though, way better than eating. I never get an upset stomach either and don&#039;t even think of my stomach anymore. You have to get anything you want to absorb from plugging into a liquid, it would be really inefficient (and probably take a long time) to just put some sold material up there, your butt isn&#039;t there to digest anything, solid material would probably just sit there. <br />As far as opiates and health, the traditional opiates, opium, morphine, heroin, and the other semi-synthetic opiates too, they don&#039;t hurt you at all. The effect is all on the brain, and on the lower intestine. Really bad constipation can be really bad, it can be much worse than merely &#039;uncomfortable&#039;. Like the others above say, it&#039;s the needles, and the cutters (they used to cut heroin with quinine (like tonic water, I guess)&nbsp; and quinine isn&#039;t good for you at least by IV. They&#039;ve cut heroin with some bad shit over the years. <br />I heard that a lot operations are done under fentanyl, that it&#039;s better is some ways.

And keep in mind that street heroin is ridiculously impure, so you&#039;ll probably end up taking a bit more than that for any real pain relief.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve never stuck anything up my butt, but I&#039;ve always been intrigued by plugging for it&#039;s ROA benefits.<br />Even with lube though it seems like something that would be very uncomfortable.<br />Then again sticking a needle in your arm probably hurts way more.<br />Snorting Meth is like burning your membranes apart instantly, love the rush and quick onset though. <br />Plus it saved my life.<br /><br />Really I don&#039;t plan on dabbling in hardcore drugs, but I do want to keep them locked away - for any emergency&#039;s.<br />Since doctors have gotten to the point where it&#039;s impossible to score anything worthwhile.&nbsp; Especially high potency opiates.<br />It&#039;s not worth the trouble in my honest opinion, and yes I&#039;m well aware of Heroins BA&#039;s.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You don&#039;t have to answer and it is off topic so maybe pm me but how did meth save your life?

				This is of course purely anecdotal, but I have experienced some nasty lung issues associated with insufflating heroin #4.&nbsp; For one reason or another it has given me bronchitis or asthma type symptoms for days after a brief run.&nbsp; The severity has varied but when it is bad it is really bad for days.<br /><br />I am pretty sure it has something to do with going to bed high and the respiratory depression that is natural from opioid use or more likely abuse.<br /><br />I would call this a harmful side effect from opioids, but it will vary greatly from one individual to another.

Can&#039;t speak for IVing since I&#039;m terrified of needles though.<br />Basically, I use a 5 mL plastic medicine dropper (kinda looks like a miniature turkey baster) that i bought from walgreens for a whopping 5 bucks<br />I take my H (this works with tar or #4) and swish it back and forth in 5 mLs of warm water in the dropper until it is completely dissolved<br />Next (the most important part), cover the syringe in lotion or lube, whatever you&#039;ve got lyring around, as it makes the next step WAY easier<br />Now, insert the dropper full of your Heroin/Water solution slowly into you-know-where, wiggling it back and forth, until you&#039;re sure it&#039;s about 4-5 inches deep.<br />Lay down on your stomach so the bulb is upright, and squeeze all the contents out, holding the bulb down so you don&#039;t accidentally suck the liquid back in<br />Hold this in place for about 30 seconds, then slowly maneuver the dropper out and put it on a paper towel to your side<br />Continue to lay down for 10-20 minutes to let the H completely absorb, and feel the wonderful rush of it without ever having to touch a needle.<br />Once you&#039;re feeling it, feel free to get up, as it&#039;s not going to come spilling out your ass.<br />And there ya go, that&#039;s how to plug heroin.<br />Make sure to sanitize the syringe with rubbing alcohol and soapy water after each use (even though it&#039;s really not too concerning, considering it&#039;s your own bacteria you&#039;re dealing with).<br />That&#039;s pretty much all there i too it.<br />If you do it right (LUBE!!!), it&#039;s completely painless, miles safer than shooting up, and gives you a slow, but pronounced rush that&#039;s far better than snorting.<br />I think that&#039;s pretty much the extent of it, feel free to ask me questions if you&#039;d like.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m in favor to agree up until the &quot;you&#039;re sure it&#039;s about 4-5 inches deep.&quot; bit.<br />I used to plug mxe daily and you don&#039;t have to stick it 4-5 inches deep.

The appeal to me is that it&#039;s usually an effective ROA with a lot of drugs and it&#039;s generally a really quick onset in my experience. No more hold up because you have a blocked nose. :P <br /><br />I&#039;m personally glad I tried it. I was at a stage in my life where a needle was the next step I could make, something I didn&#039;t set out to do.<br />Luckily I was saved by this ROA allowing me time to change who I was, while still enjoying relativity strong effects.<br />I would recommend this ROA for drugs with a high bio availability in that area regardless. It&#039;s worth a try.

				On a serious note, (apologies to OP for turning his thought provoking thread into a &quot;Carry On [Camping???? (Apt one in the series to choose, he he he)]&quot; routine, possibly the most crass comedy films in British comedy films&#039; history).<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve never had much success with plugging H, more to do with the &quot;Devil&quot; methadone&#039;s interference in my receptors, more than anything else, but, I swear by plugging coke, unfortunately, my veins are well fucked up (wish I had the internet in those days, to learn about vein valves, etc, and the correct way to jack up, but, hey ho, &quot;No use in crying over spilt milk&quot;, so plugging is my only option, if I want a proper blaster (never &quot;rung bells&quot; with this RAO, though). I&#039;ve been meaning to get a oral syringe for a while now, but usually, I just use a 2 mil works (without needle, obviously), good idea with the lube, I usually just spit on it, but it can still be a bit uncomfortable, one thing I do do, is, always hold the syringe vertically, and make sure I&#039;ve got a good bubble of air in it (keeping the works vertical insures that the last thing to come out of the works, is the bubble of air- insuring none of the precious elixir is left in the nozzle (obviously, this is not something one should do when I.V ing, as it can kill you, but having said that, it does take a lot of air, in my bad days, when I couldn&#039;t find a vein, the works would be full of blood, and all frothy with air in it, but it still went in when I finally found a suitable injection point, without killing me). I only put it in about 2 inches, I read somewhere, that that was the best place due to good blood supply, and avoiding any stray shit, further up the passage, from absorbing the solution. As far as I can see, it&#039;s a win, win situation with plugging, as long as you&#039;re not using it more than a couple of times a week, and not putting too caustic forms of drugs up there!<br />The classic example of the benign qualities of heroin, at least in Britain, is a 70 or 80 year old lady, who has taken it for much of her adult life (prescribed by her doctor after an operation, if my memory serves me correctly)- unfortunately, I can&#039;t find the actual details, but she is always rolled out as an example in various documentaries, at least, the ones that don&#039;t aim to perpetuate the untruths about drugs! She is one of a number of people who have had the great fortune, not to have to rely on black market drugs, not that their use came about from the seeking of pleasure, purely medicinal, of course, lol. One of these examples, at least, injected, and compared it to diabetics; properly administered, using pharmaceutical grade heroin/morphine, the problems of collapsed veins etc, not being an issue!<br />&nbsp;<br />On another note, just want to apologize to you, Remediless, for not getting back to you, mate, I wrote two replies, but each time I lost the connection and gave up, by the time Tor was behaving, it seemed a bit late, so, just to let you know I wasn&#039;t being ignorant, lol.

				Great informative post. I believe most of the heroin propaganda is being kept alive because when people look at all the junkies on the street they see physically broken people.

No one knows for sure where it comes from, some people think it&#039;s the CIA intentionally adding it in afghanistan trying to kill off users or something. It&#039;s kind of scary because there are recent citations backing this phenomenon up:<br /><br />&quot;Thallium poisoning: one additional and unexpected risk of heroin abuse.&quot;<br />https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22889036<br /><br />(All I can find is the abstract)<br />http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/informa-healthcare/thallium-poisoning-one-additional-and-unexpected-risk-of-heroin-abuse-oKbb87J5Rx<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thallium, a naturally occurring trace element widely distributed at very low concentrations in the earth&amp;acirc;s crust, is considered one of the most toxic heavy metals.1 Occasionally, thallium poisonings have been reported as result of suicide attempts, murders, or accidents.2 Most exposures occur after ingestion; however, poisonings have been reported after inhalation of contaminated dust, dermal absorption, and even the snorting of what was thought to be cocaine. To our best knowledge, cases due to intravenous selfinjection of illegal drugs contaminated with thallium have rarely been reported.3 Here we describe three cases of thallium toxicity in patients admitted to a hospital in Mashhad, Iran, for heroin addiction over a 2-month period. All three patients had a 10-year past history of heroin abuse. They lived in Mashhad city. Patients #1 and #2 were sister and brother, respectively, while no relation could be found with patient #3. Thallium intoxication was suspected despite the absence of any previously known occupational or environmental exposure.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />And further...what sort of damage can result to your nose from snorting this stuff over long periods of time? I have heard that cocaine-hcl can actually lead to a slight build up for hydrochloric acid in your nose, which is why some people who use a lot of coke end up with ruptured septums and stuff, but i&#039;ve not heard of anything like this specifically with heroin.
