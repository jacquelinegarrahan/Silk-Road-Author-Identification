				All right, this has never happened to me before and I&#039;ve been using on and off for about six years now. I&#039;ve never ordered from this guy, and I&#039;m not sure if the side effect should worry me?<br /><br />Both ears, every few seconds. It&#039;s really strange. This happen to anyone else?

				Possibly something to do with your sinus.&nbsp; Being that your sinus, ears, and eyes are all connected in some way.&nbsp; Possibly your sinus is getting clogged and causing some pressure to rise in to your ears?<br /><br />Try cleaning your ears and some saline solution to clean out your sinuses.

				No, snorting and also a nasal spray solution. I had a sinus infection last week, so it could be related. But it was really bizarre. Worried me a bit.<br /><br />I read around some and saw that the same happens to some people when they drink too much caffeine. <br /><br />

				It could be from high blood pressure as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I recently had a sinus infection and I could feel the pressure build up in to my ears.&nbsp; And what do you know, the infected pus mucus must up traveled up the tube that connects to the eat and clogged it up and eventually got a ear infection as the damn same time.<br /><br />Best bet is if you have some amoxcillin anti-biotic take it for 5-10 days.&nbsp; As long as you don&#039;t have ear pain you&#039;re pretty good I&#039;d say. You just gotta give it some time<br /><br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; Take some sinus decongestant if it happens again and that will definitely help.

				Are you stressed?<br />Thats the typical reason why you&#039;ve got noise in your ear..Mostly in a high frequency.
