				Hey folks got a sample of some tan MDVP in and been doing a little experimentation type things with it. Gave some to a friend and gave him enough o re dose twice after his initial dose. After I talked to him 14 hours later he was wired up drastically and a little scared. So I been doing a lot of research on this drug and it seems that me and him both could have done a smaller amount and been a little better off maybe. I gave some to a co worker and he was wired to the gills and we both worked our asses off and got off a few minutes earlir then normal. Working on this is crazy as hell. When somebody dropped something or made a loud noise my heart would jump and I would look around for it and see where the noise came from but I played it off and said &quot;I&#039;m awake now thank you&quot;. But it actually scared the shit out of me. <br /><br />I got it yesterday and me and him both did 2 bumps that were around 5-8mg per bump. I went to work and left him enough for 2 more doses for later because this stuff is definitely a moreish type thing that promps you to re dose after a couple of hours. After that couple of hours we both began to get jittery and kind of nervous and so a re dose helps this for another 3 to 4 hours. And of course the redoses were considerably smaller then the first dose. Like 2- 3mg. It was all dosed by the snorting method which caused a little burn with a little itchiness in the nose and a sneeze or 2. The euphoria you get from it with in the next 5-15 minutes is crazy good and last around two hours or more depending on how big your dose is.<br /><br />So yea I went to erowid.com and read all the little info they had on legality, dosage and effects, drug testing for it, and some experiences from people in their vault. I also went to blue light web site and found a lot more experiences to read about and found some people who smoked it.<br /><br />Well I tried to put a little on the foil and chase the dragon but it didn&#039;t burn very well like that and tasted like shit but it did cause some more stimulation effects. This was not what I was expecting since I had red people&#039;s comments where they said it was like crack. I didn&#039;t get anything from it that reminded me of smoking the rock. I might not have the freebase form so maybe I should put it on the foil and add baking soda with just enough drips of water to make it a thick paste and smear it all over the foil and let it dry then chase the dragon that way. Me and a friend used to smoke our coke like that exactly and I red where some people smoked their MDPV like that.<br /><br />What I got is a tan color mdpv I almost thought it was DMT. According to the vendors page this is 98 or 99% pure mdpv so I am thinking it&#039;s nothing like that shit they are trying to ban called Ivory Wave, Ocean, Charge +, White Lightening, Scarface, Hurricane Charlie, Red Dove, Cloud 9 and White Dove because that stuff isn&#039;t 995 pure and it is mixed with the other ingrediates which the other ingredients are the actual bath salts and are un safe.:&nbsp; <br /><br />(clearnet link warning)&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nbc33tv.com/news/33md/dhh-issues-warning-about-copy-cat-cocaine<br />it was uploaded december 21st 2010 and says there was 84 people hospitalized due to using these bath salts and then it says the 2 chemicals used in those bath salts were MDPV and mephedrone. I&#039;m always of the opinion to blame the user for stuff like this because I feel it is up to a person to learn about stuff before he ingest it and parents should be aware of what their kids are into and spending their time on. I do a lot of partying but I keep up with what my 8 year old is into and she don&#039;t want nothing to do with any kind of drugs so far and thank god for that but she know that I use drugs and hopefully she will use that as a reason not to ever do them. <br /><br />I told her if she ever got the urge to do anything to come to me first. I&#039;d rather her do it here where I can watch her and Id rather be the one she gets anything from because I know my shit about it and I don&#039;t want her getting anything from people who don&#039;t know what they are getting. That&#039;ll be when she&#039;s at least 21 and hopefully she will never get curious about it but to be realistic is to admit that you can&#039;t hide the world from your kids and sooner or later they will be forced to make that decision. The best thing we can do to start winning any so called war on drugs is to educate our children about them and not keep it all in the dark as to hide it when it&#039;s a real epidemic. We had better be honest with our children folks. I wouldn&#039;t want her to ever do this kind of drug but I&#039;ll be the first to smoke the holy plant with her when she is old enough and ready. I&#039;d rather her smoke that as to smoke cigs. I find it a mistake to keep pushing against what God gave us and to not tell our children the truth and let them make an informed decision.<br /><br />I hate to post shit like this but what are your thoughts about what is going on with these chemicals? If you go to that link you will see it clearly talks about MDPV and Mephedrone. I really like mephedrone. The jury is still out on this mdpv tho shit man There&#039;s no sleeping on this stuff and it&#039;s an aphrodisiac but I like the aphrodisiac qualities with mephedrone and 25i better so far.<br /><br />Any opinions? Luckily I had some xanax (thanks Maligan) so The guy at work was wired so tight he had to go to the bathroom twice so I had mercy on him and gave him a peach xanax and said Happy New Years as we parted ways after work. I went and saw the other guy after 14 hours and he was fucking shaking and jittery so I gave him 2 of the xznzxes because i had left him a bit to do 2 redosed and that stuff was gone. He had finished it and so me and him did a bit too much like first off I gave him 5-8mg then I left him three lines that were close to ten mg per line and told him to go easy because I had red the reports and this stuff was very strong but he didn&#039;t care he just done it all in re doses one after another. He said he finished the last line 30 minutes before I got there. <br /><br />I believe I did more then him tho because I did 2 small lines before work and did one at work and then snorted some xanax when I got home and started feeling great so then i decided to do a pretty good size line of mdpv which looked like around 15mg and now I cannot stop typing and I am flying like a mother fucker. I sure am glad I got a couple more xanny for later. Damit the mail wont run today so I guess that&#039;s another day of waiting on my UC. That makes it day 22 now which is a record for the longest package to come from The UK. 22 days beats the old record held by my favorite nbomes supplier. <br /><br />Just wanting to ask you all how safe is this MDPV and can you smoke it and what are the best ways to smoke it? Thanks guys

				There is no such thing as &quot;safe&quot; when we are referring to drug use so your poll will be inconclusive no matter the results. <br /><br />Yes, you can smoke it. Using baking soda and water like you said or you can just smoke it straight off the foil. I have noticed better results by turning it into a paste. <br /><br />The thing is with mdpv when i was using daily. I was going through half a gram to a gram a day. Yes i said 500mgs to 1000mgs a day. So i would treat mdpv pretty safe since i&#039;m still around. Also, the desire to redose off mdpv is extremely hard to resist. Especially when smoking.<br /><br />If you find the right dose, mdpv can ring your bell like crack. I wouldn&#039;t say that mdpv feels like crack, but the effects are close to crack when it comes to the aphrodisiac effects as well as the paronria. Oh yeah, if you do mdpv. Eventually you&#039;re going to get paronoid. There&#039;s no way around it, and it&#039;s a different kind of stimulant parnoria that I&#039;ve never got off any other stimulant.<br /><br />So treat it with respect. People tend to forget how strong of a substance mdpv is because of the small amount of product needed to get desired effects. Take it easy my friend and don&#039;t go eating people&#039;s faces. (Mdpv or meph won&#039;t cause you to become a canabial.)<br /><br />Oh, and fucking is amazing on mdpv!

				I can always depend on sniper123 to come back with some help full information +1 my good friend and yea I have been respecting the fuck out of it man and it&#039;s tearing me down tho lol it is very powerful shit just a little and your off to the races. <br /><br />If you have noticed I been talking like crazy in all the threads i have posted it&#039;s some crazy speedy shit and I haven&#039;t been sleepy or in the bed since i woke up yesterday at noon. Wow! man this is some crazy shit and I&#039;m going to crash so hard I know but like i said i got a few xannies for the crash later. I gota work later tonight so it will be a lot of fun i do believe.<br /><br />Yea this stuff isn&#039;t for the UN-experienced drug user that&#039;s for sure. I red all kinds of info on other sites before trying it out. I didn&#039;t get it to smoke right so I guess I have to mix it up with a drop of water and some b soda and rub it in on foil and let it dry and then try to smoke it like that. I think I&#039;ll make a sheet of foil and let it dry while I&#039;m at work then when I get home I&#039;ll test it out with the smoking part of it. <br /><br />yea I am going to have to e dose just to keep mysel going today but small bumps for me you know? I don&#039;t want to look like a crazy speedster at work hahaha but I go in at the closing hours i am the closer so there shouldn&#039;t be any big corporate type bosses there. Most of the bosses I normally work with are cool as hell and they like their own little poisons you know what I mean? <br /><br />Thanks sniper123<br /><br />Oh and by the way did you get your name from me or from the guy who started the nbome thread in the off topics page? Is there a nbome thread in every part of the forum? Do you sometimes think that SR came into being just for the purpose of spreading the nbomes?&nbsp; I mean that could be one reason they created this site couldn&#039;t it? <br /><br />Sorry bro I&#039;m rambling again I know I&#039;m flying off this shit. Oh well cya round and +1 when I can man

				both substances are neurotoxic and can easily cause psychosis if you overdose. Most of the hospitalizations happen because people snort these all the time in ridiculous doses.&nbsp; Most&nbsp; people dont know how to dose. <br />Its hard to eyeball 10 mg of MDPV.&nbsp; Lots of ppl snort 100s of mgs and od.<br />If you dont have a scale you should buy one. <br />i never tried mdpv to be honest but i really enjoyed meph. <br />Be careful,&nbsp; take breaks between doses. dont forget to sleep, eat and drink.&nbsp; and have fun.

I came up with my name because when i found out about the road i was really big on ebay. When you bid at the last moment to get an item. They call this &quot;sniping&quot;. I originally thought the road worked like ebay, but later discovered it was more of a market place. I actually started off on BMR and was weary of the road because of the amount of people using it. So in a sense my username means to out bid someone in a matter of three seconds. (I would wait for the timer on ebay to get to three seconds before sniping the item.)

				Yeah man there is not as much research on these drugs and they may not be the best things for health.<br /><br />Get some mdma, speed and coke along with ketamine, lsd and cannabis. That will rock the boat nicely.<br /><br />You have to be a very brave researcher to dance with the unknown. I am too scared of mdvp, though I would probably try methadone once.<br /><br />But do not take my advise &#039;cause I&#039;m just a drug addled fool!
