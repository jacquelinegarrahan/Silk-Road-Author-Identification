				I am a pain management patient in the us. I take percecet for back and neck disease. I&#039;ll be getting a new meds but can&#039;t get filled till next week. Have to wait 30 days exactly to fill.on insurance. <br /><br />Anyone know if I can get them filled earlier if I pay cash at different pharmacy. There is no more 25 day grace period as far as I know. <br /><br />I have a reliable street connection but won&#039;t be available till thurs or Fri. I don&#039;t have enough stats to buy here yet. Even if I did couldn&#039;t get shipped to me in time. <br /><br />I might be able to get an increase in meds which I think would allow me to fill them right away. It&#039;s hard to say with the way the new rules are and they seem to keep changing. This is the first time this has happened to me. Don&#039;t know what to do. <br /><br />I read on line you can get poppy seeds at the grocery store to make tea with which is supposed to help some. IDK about that. <br /><br />Any advice tips or just support appreciated.

				That depends on how many your script is for. I worked at a pharmacy several years ago (worst job ever for someone like me), so maybe things have changed since then, but at the time there was a state limit of 180 sched III pills per month like lortabs, and I think it was the same for sched II like percs, but can&#039;t remember. I have no idea what state you live in (assuming US), but that may give you an idea if you have a chance or not. If your script is for way less than that I&#039;d say you&#039;re good to go at the same pharmacy if you are willing to pay cash price for them (no insurance). <br /><br />However it wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea to go to a different pharmacy just in case though, because one pharm has no idea what is going on at another pharm. You never know when you&#039;ll get a self-righteous asshole pharmacist that may say &quot;Blah blah you already filled here a few weeks ago durka derr...&quot;<br /><br />And idk about the poppy seed thing that sounds kinda iffy, I think if that was a reliable way to get high then I&#039;d have heard of and done it several times by now :)

				It is a new month and a new script but about 6 days early. <br /><br />Just before sandy I&nbsp; had meds but did try to fill my script 3 days early just in case so I would have them if the worst happened. They claim there is a new law that you can&#039;t fill 5 days early anymore.<br /><br />I looked on line but cannot find any such law or federal regulation that prohibits filling 5 days early. I know the DEA does track these meds and treats Pain Management docs like crap.<br /><br />I am thinking about asking for an increase from 7.5 to 10 mg and taking to different pharmacy and pay with cash.<br /><br />Have a great doc who cares about patients and I hope he will have no problem with this. I used to be able to talk frankly with him and would always just tell him I took a few extra but with the DEA busting their chops plus the new medical director I have to which what I say now. <br /><br />One person at physical therapy as switched to heroine because he tested positive for weed of all things. <br /><br />These new crackdowns are really hurting people. <br /><br />But yea you are right about the pharmacist. Ever since the new one people have been having problems. <br /><br />I get 120 per month and live in USA.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Guess to brake it down more simple.<br /><br />Can I just get my usual script and just take it to different pharmacy and pay cash? Or: <br /><br />Should I try to get a script for a slightly higher amount and just take it to my usual pharmacy? <br /><br />How well linked up are the pharmacies in the us now? If I pay in cash and don&#039;t use my insurance. This has not happened to me b4 and am not sure what to do. <br /><br />Just want to be clear I do not doc shop. Been with the same Dr. Since my injuries. <br /><br />I actually been with my pharmacy too. The pharmacist changed and people have been having problems there since then.&nbsp;

				Depending on what state you are in mate...<br /><br />Your best bet is to get scripted a different drug (if u are in a state that has a medtracker system) and fill it with insurance. <br /><br />Or try kratom! Good luck, I wish ye well

				Thanks everyone for support and advice. Very much appreciated. I have actually heard some good things about katrom and is worth looking into.<br /><br />As it turns out I was paranoid for nothing. I hear so many horror stories from people at physical therapy that it got myself all worked up. But as it turns out she was getting reports from pt and was already thinking about making some changes. She did increase my meds and wants me to keep a pain log and drop it off a week before my next appointment to help her figure out what further changes will help me manage my pain better. <br /><br />But not everyone is that lucky. And these new laws are hurting people that and causing unbelievable and unnecessary suffering. <br /><br />I know one person that was cut off meds cold turkey just for a positive test for weed. I could see if she was drinking or doing other drugs that could case fatal interactions. But this was just weed. <br /><br />Even for some people who have over used their meds wouldn&#039;t it make more sense to just more closely monitor these people. Even in the case of addiction just cutting people off is cruel. They could at least give people the option of cutting them down slowly. <br /><br />Instead the system just kicks people out of the office with not so much as a referral to treatment. Seeing a huge increase in people either buying what ever they can illegally to manage pain or jump straight to heroine. This makes no sense to me at all. <br /><br />If people are not hurting anyone then just let them be. Don&#039;t make the fix for a problem worse than the problem itself. <br /><br />Sorry for the rant but I see so much suffering and frustration from pain management folks that isn&#039;t right. People deserve to be pain free.&nbsp; &nbsp;
