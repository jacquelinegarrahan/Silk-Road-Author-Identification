				Just need a little bit of advice. <br /><br />I tried some of Dimitri&#039; changa for the first time today. As soon as i started coming down, i decided i wanted to order more. <br /><br />Anyways, i also have some lucy i want to take, and i know that changa has an MAOI. <br /><br />My question, is there a period of time i should wait between a changa session and an acid trip (i&#039;m talking days)? Will having an maoi in my system water down any other type of psychedelic trip?

				i think i would be similar to my situation with mdma, smoking changa&#039;s ok but oral stuff like Pharmahausca or something similar would be bad<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30064.0<br /><br />someone will post a more in depth answer for you soon hopefully<br /><br />

				Since the maoi in changa is smoked it will be out of your system very quickly, I would guess within 24 hours or less.<br /><br />So it seems to me the only issue would be cross tolerance between DMT and LSD, which I have not heard of, but could be a possibility since they are both tryptamine indoles.<br /><br />It may not be neccesary at all, but I would say wait 4 days to a week and you will have a full Lucy experience. And smoke some changa with Lucy too :)<br /><br />Happy tripping,<br /><br />weedsaves

				Thank you for your replies :) <br /><br />Yea i&#039;ll wait a few days, nothing worse than wasted acid. <br /><br />Changa and lucy would be fucking intense. I need to go out and buy a space suit for that&nbsp; ;D
