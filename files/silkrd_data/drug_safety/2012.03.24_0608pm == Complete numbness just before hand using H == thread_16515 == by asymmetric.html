				I&#039;ve just injected a shot into what I thought was a vein but I do not have any feelings in the surrounding area of the location and it has gone completely red around the area.<br /><br />To describe where I injected, if you follow the line of your thumb down until just where you get to the wrist, it is basically there, so kind of to the right of my wrists.<br /><br />Anyway I drew up some blood before injecting and I thought it looked okay, about half way through injecting I started to feel a slight burn but it wasn&#039;t much so I continued to inject. I don&#039;t feel very high so I don&#039;t think I got much in the vein but I am now shitting myself about the numbness, I have missed veins before and have never had this numbness (although I&#039;ve never injected much after missing the vein because usually it is too painful but this didn&#039;t seem to happen this time.<br /><br />It has been about half an hour and I do not have any feeling in this part of my harnd, I&#039;ve tried google but couldn&#039;t find out what it was. Has anyone else had this and is it something to seriously worry about? I&#039;d rather not go to the hospital because I know someone in my office is in there at the moment and if I got spotted and they found out what for I would lose my job.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it is spreading but it isn&#039;t getting any better, is this something to really worry about (like losing my hand) or is it likely to be okay in a few hours/days? Has anyone else experienced this? Any idea about what might have happened? I thought that maybe I had damaged a nerver due to the lack of feeling but I would have thought that would really really hurt at first. Does heroin have any anaesthetic properties? <br /><br />Would appreciate any kind and helpful responses to anyone saying &quot;You are stupid for injecting&quot; then I know that already.

				Well now I&#039;m confused as hell.... I think I&#039;m starting to get a little feeling back and I&#039;m definately starting to feel high (no rush though, seems to be slowly happening). Breathing has slowed down a fair bit though. The rea I think is starting to itch, although not much at the moment as the feeling isn&#039;t completely back.<br /><br />Think I&#039;m starting to feel a bruise now as well.... Anyone know what on earth happened here?

				Sounds like you missed the vein.&nbsp; Even if you draw blood you can lose the vein in that one or two seconds from when you inject, especially if it&#039;s a small vein.&nbsp; I would recommend hitting a larger vein, the one half way up your arm opposite your elbow is where I like to hit. <br /><br />It may bruise but will go away in a day or two, don&#039;t sweat it.

				Okay I think feeling is starting to come back now. Bit annoyed though, don&#039;t really want to risk doing any more as I am feeling a little high, means I&#039;ve missed my Saturday night rush for this week though. My breathing is a little laboured so don&#039;t want to risk it.<br /><br />Edit: While I was writing that saw your reply, thanks for the info, the H I have at the moment doesn&#039;t need vitamin C/citric acid which is maybe why it didn&#039;t burn so much when I missed the vein (which I agree with you I think is what happened).&nbsp; When I have missed with citric it hurts A LOT instantly so I never manage to get much of the shot in, but obviously this time I missed and didn&#039;t feel much burning so went through with it, definately didn&#039;t feel right though, should have pulled out.<br /><br />Anyway, glad to hear it is normal and nothing to worry about, much appreciated.

				That is very sensitive area with small veins. You could irritate some nerve also and thus numbness. It will pass but it can be annoying.<br />Some heparine cream/gel can help.
