				Use somebody else&#039;s piss or buy some fake piss from your local headshop :p always worked for me anyway lol. Or maybe buy one of those detox drink that will make you clean for a couple hours I personally havn&#039;t tried them tho. Good luck.

				No way I know of to defeat a hair test for weed except for shaving all body hair off.<br /><br />Urine test can be defeated by cleansing beverages like Palo Azul and such. They sell them at health stores like General Nutrition Centers (GNC).<br /><br />Another way to beat a urine test is to obtain some clean urine and substitute it or use synthetic urine. If they monitor your while psising it can be problematic and they do sell Pissinators and Whizzinators that are basically a strap dildo that holds urine to piss in cup.

				Careful with the drinks and powders because if you pee is too diluted it raises some flags.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been able to pass with Urine Luck.&nbsp; Its a bag that straps to your waist, a warmer to get it to body temp, and a little hose that you can run down your shorts (makes it sound like you are peeing too).<br /><br />As for the hair, don&#039;t think there really is a way that works but hair tests are expensive so they don&#039;t use them as much.

				I sell shampoo for passing hair follicle tests, but it&#039;s pricey stuff. I sell it for Â£25 packet and that does one wash, retail price is 40-45 squids.<br />I used to sell the detox drinks but i stopped selling them because water did as good a job.

				Dilute your system with water until you piss CRYSTAL CLEAR.<br />-This will cause a re-test when they test for creatine levels for dilution but you can beat having to take a re-test by taking creatine supplements found at GNC or anywhere 1-2 weeks prior to test, taken daily.<br /><br />B-Complex Vitamins 2-3 hours before test to make sure your piss is colored yellow. (May be yellow/greenish, like gatorade colored but should pass fine)<br /><br />I believe this method was what worked for me when I had to take my test.... was a chronic smoker for a year before I took the test, and smoked up to 3-4 days before my test.&nbsp; At the time I was still ingesting plant matter so I was burning around ~28 oz of high grade A indoor per 3 days.

				Out of all the drugs pot stays in your system the longest and shows up in urine drug tests even weeks after in some cases. Most other drugs leave your system in 3 days. I suggest using one of the drugs that leaves your system fast.

				I can attest to drinking a lot of water and taking Vitamin B-Complex pills. I drank 2.5 gallons of water several hours before my test and vitamin B-complex pills a couple of hrs later. I, without thinking, ate some rice before I went. When I took a piss during the drug test, my urine was yellow, so I was worried I might of compromised my ability to pass the test.When I called my potential employer about my my job application progress&nbsp; a couple of days later, they told me I had the job. BE prepared to piss like a race horse for the rest of the day. I couldn&#039;t even make it to my then girlfriends house without having to stop and pee every 10 minutes.<br /><br />I found out about the water dilution trick several years ago when I was on the bus (I totaled my car earlier), and was talking to my friend on the phone about how am I gonna pass my drug test, and some guy, who overheard my conversation, told me about the trick.

				i piss out thc crystals for the most part and i know if i don&#039;t do anything, thc will stay in my system for about 50 days. Everyone&#039;s different, so the best way is to do a fat 3 day niacin flush. a couple thousand mil&#039;s a day with a shit ton of water, and you&#039;ll be clean in no time. shit a lot drink a lot of water, sleep, exercise, eat fruits, and take water soluble vitamins. good luck.

				I can&#039;t speak to government/military tests, hair tests, or saliva tests.<br /><br />But I can say that at my local headshop they sell synthetic urine marketed towards urolagnics (LOL!) and I&#039;ve passed many job piss tests using it.<br /><br />Also good if you&#039;re lonely and want a golden shower.<br /><br />I keep it in my sock. On my way to the testing facility, I have the car defrost at its hottest setting and keep the item on the dash above the defrost, with the heating pad on it. If I&#039;m in a hurry, I swing by a gas station and pop the thing in the microwave for ten seconds then stick the heating pad on.

				Do a risk assessment mate, If getting caught out means losing Job, and maybe your house if you cannot find another job (without references or with questionable exit from your last job)&nbsp; then just&nbsp; quit for a while, i am testing clean after 35 days but had a 26 year long daily habit, believe me quitting aint so bad once you get over the feeling of having been defeated by these testing motherfuckers&nbsp; ( for me its recently become part of my health check-ups at work)<br /><br />&nbsp;substitution is an option but read up and know all the facts, IE , sample amount , desired temperature, stashing techniques that don&#039;t taint the sample with strange smell ( i read about non lubricated condoms but when i tested this method the sample had a whiff of rubber about it) Also if you go with substitution do a test run at home to build confidence and get procedure dialed in.<br /><br />best of luck with whatever you decide anyhow..

				Avoid intense aerobic exercise on the actual day of the test. <br /><br />THC is lipid soluble, and so it dissolves into your fatty tissues (this is the reason why THC remains detectable in your excretion products for so long after smoking:&nbsp; when you eventually burn the fat to use as energy, the THC is released back into your blood stream). <br /><br />For this reason, aerobic exercise is a really great idea in the days leading up to the test, but definitely not on the day. Get the bus there, and then take the elevator IMO (I have myself passed an employee drugs test using similar advice to that contained earlier on in the thread)
