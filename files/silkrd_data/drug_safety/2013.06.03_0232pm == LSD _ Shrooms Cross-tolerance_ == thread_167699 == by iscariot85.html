				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve found diverging opinions on this on the clearweb, so I figured I&#039;d bring my question here to the forums.&nbsp; I have some free time all week and have a healthy supply of both acid and shrooms.&nbsp; My significant other and I are planning on eating some shrooms Friday for a Cirque du Soleil show we&#039;re seeing.&nbsp; But I&#039;m free today (Monday) and want to drop some acid.&nbsp; My question is whether taking ~200 ug of LSD today will make the shrooms (~3.5 g) less potent?&nbsp; Anyone have any familiarity with doing both psychedelics within a few days of each other that could advise?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				In my vast experience, it is subjective the individual, but, for the most part, there is a strong cross tolerance between the 2.

				It&#039;s not as bad as the tolerance between LSD and LSD or shrooms and shrooms, but it&#039;s definitely there. Like 85%, if LSD and LSD is 100%.<br /><br />It will, without a doubt make the shrooms a lesser experience.

				I&#039;m interested to know how this turns out OP.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just me, but I am able to trip multiple days in a row alternating between acid and shrooms.

It&#039;s usually a toss up to how much less it is, but it&#039;s always less.

				I think if you were taking them on back to back days, you&#039;d develop a cross-tolerance. But since you have a couple of days in between, shouldn&#039;t be a problem, IMO. But then again, everyone is different.

				I agree with the OP decision to just wait till friday! with these types of substances/experiences they are unique journey that for me anyways I have to be ready for and usually mentally prepare for them and only do them every so often (once a year or maybee every few months tops). And if its a good one its usually very important deep journey that is reflected on for a long time after. Not something that you just kinda do half way or &quot;just catch a small buzz&quot; every few days. Each one is one hell of a long deep spirtual Adventure that you cant just go on regularly. usually there so magical that Im not even ready for another one for quite some time.<br /><br /><br />just my opinion on using Hallucinagens
