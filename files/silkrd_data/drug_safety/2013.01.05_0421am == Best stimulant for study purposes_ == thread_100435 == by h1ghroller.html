				Look into Focalin, dexedrine, and vyvanse.&nbsp; I used to like ritalin/concerta but they made my anxiety crazy worse.&nbsp; <br /><br />But really you should just look each up and see what would work best for you.&nbsp; There is a reason why they are so many different kinds because everyone reacts differently.&nbsp; Honestly the cleanest tweak is from meth.&nbsp; Amazing for studying lol!

				I just realized you asked for a &#039;cheap&#039; stim for studying.&nbsp; For that, yiu could try a high quality european speed or some 3-FA.&nbsp; I like 3-FA a lot because its relatively short acting, so sleep is possible 4 hours after my last dose.

				I&#039;m going to have to second that you should study without the use of harder stimulants if you can, however, this is the SR and we&#039;re not here to tell you what to do.&nbsp; I advise studying without the stims if you can because they tend to be way too easy to start redosing compulsively and really begin to have diminishing returns on your performance as you do more.&nbsp; But if you can self-regulate, I see no reason why some good dexedrine wouldn&#039;t really help you focus without cracking you out too bad in the end.

				Dexedrine is good for studying but the euphoria can be distracting. I don&#039;t want to &quot;waste&quot; the high on studying. I prefer methylphenidate and modafinil for studying.

				I know a straight A&#039;s student who does meth exams days only. Not advising, just saying.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a stimulant too that help me become energetic and talkative in workplace <br /><br />I tried amphetamine and Adderall pills. They were ineffective due to being on antidepressants :( The only effect I got was burning my nasal passage.

I&#039;ve prob used it ~10x or so and tested doses from 5mg to 50, IR. You will need to redose to get &quot;coverage&quot; throughout the day but my amphet tolerance may still be a little high from lots of mdma last year before I quit/took a long break.<br />&nbsp;<br />I don&#039;t use it because of the nasty side of the drug - addictive potential - withdrawl, depression, insomnia.<br />As far as for treating my add, it is pretty dam good and fuck can I get stuff done on it.<br />If you&#039;re an EXCELLENT self regulator (you probably are not) it might be a good option.<br />I find piracetam to work nicely without the nasty side effects and feeling like I NEED it. Just make sure you take it properly.<br />The fact of the matter, bro, is that you need to see a doctor if you have a genuine need to get some help studying or focusing....if you just want a stimulant to help you with cramming for finals or something, go the non euphoric route and use OTC stims such as coffee etc.<br /><br />whoever told you that they took small mdma doses, hey to each your own, but i&#039;d steer far from that. if you insisted on using stims, M1 would be a superior stim than mdma at low doses for that purpose imo.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MDMA makes me too cloudy and unable to focus. I can&#039;t use it for studying.<br />I will try nootropics as soon as they get here, I will take noopept, oxiracetam &amp; aniracetam mainly.<br />My first intention was to stick to nootropics, but I actually fear that they won&#039;t work the way I need to.<br />I have a month left and I have to study for three exams, so I am looking for the easiest and fastest way.<br />I never tried any amphetamines so I don&#039;t have tolerance problems, I need to take them just this time and only for this purpose, when shit will get done i will stick to my weed&nbsp; ;D

				nootropics are just as good as adder for what you need.<br />to each their own im not going to tell you how to live your life.<br />just remember, I SELL the drugs you are asking about and im telling you not to get into it, only a minority do what you&#039;re talking about and almost all of them say what you&#039;re saying. i hope you&#039;re the minority.

				Meth and adderall have basically the same effect on me. They make me focus for hours at a time. I used to be prescribed addies, but i would abuse them to the point where I looked sick. Hasn&#039;t happened with meth. I haven&#039;t ever had that euphoric high from either drug. I&#039;ve never IVed meth though, so maybe that&#039;s why...

				The problem I have with stims and studying is if I don&#039;t keep the dose very low I tend to waste a lot of time on trying to be too perfectionist and not advance until I&#039;m 100% satisfied with how well I know a chapter.<br /><br />College and exams is something from the past and nowadays I only study for fun or work related but it&#039;s still annoying to waste time, so try to keep the dosages as low as possible with whatever you&#039;re gonna take.

I would however like to mention that it becomes very easy to associate amphetamine with studying. Just watch out that your use doesn&#039;t become a requirement before you can do your homework/study, because it sure is easy to pop some amphetamine and feel motivated and alert. Even though it worked really well for me and I wasn&#039;t using it for anything other than homework/studying, I do feel that the potential damage from amphetamine use is not be worth it. <br /><br />If you do decide to use it as a study aid then make sure you keep up your regular eating schedule and avoid staying up for more than 1 day. Even though it might not feel like it, sleep deprivation does chip away at your cognitive abilities. As mentioned in another reply amphetamines can really make you focused to the extreme of obsession. For example, you could spend hours rewriting a paragraph or analyzing an exam question. This becomes especially prominent if you take high dosages. I would also suggest oral dosing for a longer lasting effect and to spare your nose. <br /><br />Also keep in mind that if you&#039;re studying on a drug (also counts for caffeine) to also dose before taking the exam. The way the human learning process works is that your memory stores a lot more than just what you&#039;ve been reading. The context and situational influences are all taken into account. For the best performance you want these to as closely match the exam setting as possible.

				Modafinil would be my choice. It&#039;s anti-narcoleptic so best taken before midday, if you want to sleep normally that night. Concentration and capacity for dull/repetitive work is excellent, and it&#039;s not too speedy or euphoric once you get used to it. 100mg is fine for a whole day&#039;s work. It&#039;s apparently used by fighter pilots on long missions, and some evidence seems to be coming out showing it might have neuroprotective effects...
