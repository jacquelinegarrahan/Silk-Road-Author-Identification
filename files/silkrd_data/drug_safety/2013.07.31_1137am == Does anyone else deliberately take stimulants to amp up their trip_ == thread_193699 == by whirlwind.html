				I enjoy LSD + 10mg Dexedrine at&nbsp; festivals. Makes me less likely to get stuck laying down in my tent and more likely to have a hell of a time dancing around and getting into the music. Also causes me to express more strange acid soaked thoughts and ideas that others (sometimes) appreciate.<br /><br />Probably wouldn&#039;t do the combo in an indoor setting though.<br /><br />Was wondering if anyone else has experience with stimulant-psychedelic combos. Probably wouldnt do it with phenethylamines and definitely not MAOIs.<br /><br />As a side note i resolved not get drunk when i trip on acid anymore because i feel i am losing much of what the compound has to offer to the numbness of alcohol.

				Not me, whenever I take stimulants to amp up my trip,&nbsp; it&#039;s always accidentally.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Seriously though, the acid nowadays is soooo clean, that you almost need a little quality stimulant, like the amph that can be found on SR :D<br /><br />I go back to the 70&#039;s with purple-microdot, and Orange Sunshine. Some shit called Green Moon, or Half-Moon was real popular, but you&#039;d have such a sore jaw the next day. I&#039;m not sure if it was from gritting my teeth or laughing and smiling so much!~ ;D<br />

				I confess to this possibly being a dumb question, but I have taken so little stimulant that one addy will keep me up until the sun comes up. I fucking love the energy and focus but wonder if tolerance builds with stims? Do crashes get really shitty? I can only imagine your body at some point screams SLEEP and makes you crash. I thought about using stims to offset the fatigue too many opiates gives. I like the warm but not the sleepiness I get when I take too many. Taking that extra opiate and then feeling like I have to go to bed seems like a big waste of that last dose and I get pissed the next day that I wasted a dose and went to bed after.

				Ken Kesey was onto something. I bet the Sandoz LSD was probably pretty clean too :D <br /><br />All SR amphetamine will still be racemic though right, and therefore a bit more edgy than straight dex?

				There&#039;s 3 top sellers. Boymaster (Spain)[currently out of stock], CapeCrusader (South Africa) [restocking], and IisthisisI (NL) [will be on Vacation after Friday]&nbsp; - I&#039;ve only bought from the first two, as IisthisisI only recently started US sales. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let the countries of origin fool you. I&#039;ve had Priority Mail orders domestic US, take longer than Spain and South Africa. ( usually a week on the nose)<br /><br />CC&#039;s is smoother, more like Dex, but fucking strong, be careful. BM&#039;s is rocket fuel. Just a dab will do ya. Be extra careful. <br /><br />YES to the question of tolerance build with these stimulants. The fastest tolerance build I&#039;ve ever experienced. <br /><br />For you trippers, my recommendation is to just get some addies. You shouldn&#039;t need more than a 10 mg with no tolerance. I went to 60+ mg a day, in just one month of taking them. Same with buying Amphetamine bulk. I get bingey. Though the smoother stuff, like CC&#039;s tends to make me less so. <br /><br />IisthisisI has the smoothest, or so I&#039;ve heard. Get it while you can! <br /><br />If you really want to speed, try some Meth! (for daredevils only) 8)
