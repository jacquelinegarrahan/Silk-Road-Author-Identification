				Plants such as mimosa hostilis and psychotria viridis are active only when ingested and consumed with a MAO-I.<br /><br />So is there any plant more psychedelic than super premium weed when smoked?

				Thanks but vaping Salvia needs the extracted form to be effective, not sure if it is natural as everyone is smoking salvanorin, and not the natural plant like weed.

				I am pretty sure there are other plants which trip you out, weed isn&#039;t a psychadelic for me. I don&#039;t know what could be, perhaps a cacti, there are loads of mescaline type and legal highs which are natural and kind of trip you out, not any that i can name.<br /><br />And yeah salvia is pretty much a headfuck when it comes to a concentrated version, i still have my 60x in my drawer...

				I&#039;ve only smoked weed about 10 times in my life (not my thing). I didn&#039;t notice and psychedelic effects... Just felt more sedated.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in knowing what the psychedelic effects are... I&#039;ve never heard of anyone &#039;tripping&#039; on weed. But then again I&#039;ve not had a lot of experience with the herb.

				Weed is definitely a psychedelic plant. At high enough doses, THC and CBD have greatly psychedelic effects. Even in the relatively low doses found in most weed, you can experience a low-grade psychedelic trip by smoking enough. The strain matters, of course... and let&#039;s not forget that smoking while on another psychedelic ramps the trip up for nearly everyone.<br /><br />Salvia, although you have to extract it (for most people), is by far more psychedelic than cannabis... for some, like myself, the raw leaf suffices to create a level 2 or level 3 salvia trip. Well, I can hit a shulgin +++ on weed too, so I&#039;m out of the norm. But I digress, salvia is the most psychedelic plant to smoke.

				Psychedelic = serotonin 2A receptor agonist.<br /><br />Weed is not a psychedelic, even if it might put you in a similar headspace at extremely high doses.<br /><br />To answer OP&#039;s question: Salvia, datura, peyote. Also, plants with high enough DMT concentrations on their leaves can be &quot;smoked&quot; - actually vaporized - but it&#039;s usually terribly inefficient. Extracting the alkaloid and then vaping that is a lot better and worth the extra trouble.<br /><br />But since THC isn&#039;t a psychedelic at all, the correct answer is that every single plant in the world is, at least, as psychedelic as weed, and some of them are more so.

				First a question for the OP.<br />Have you ever tried LSD, mushrooms or DMT?<br /><br />Now, I felt a little trippy the second time I smoked real sinse back in the 90&#039;s, but I wouldn&#039;t call it psychedelic.<br />The term psychedelic has changed over the years, as &quot;drug education&quot; has vilified cannabis to a large extent to include it on the list of substances that change your consciousness.&nbsp; I&#039;ve smoked stuff that made me lie there like a little baby, when I was new to it.&nbsp; I&#039;d say now there is no cannabis left in the world that can make me feel that way, not even after taking a month long hiatus.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get giggles when high either.&nbsp; The only stereotypical stoner symptoms I have now are slight munchies and red eyes, otherwise I just feel relaxed.<br /><br />Most genuine psychedelics you cannot smoke as the molecules are so fragile that they break down very easily, and those that don&#039;t you would have to smoke an awful lot of to have any effects.&nbsp; They would be very harsh on the lungs.&nbsp; Could you imagine trying to smoke 600mg of mescaline freebase or five or six big peyote buttons to break through?&nbsp; Cough, cough.<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychedelic_plants is a list of many &quot;psychedelic&quot; plants.&nbsp; Yes it includes MJ/THC as a psych. I just don&#039;t feel as though it has ever really changed my thoughts, or made as lasting an impact as LSD or mushrooms have in my life.<br /><br />Smoking DMT containing plants, and smoking PCP are said to fuck folks up the most.&nbsp; I have yet to try though.<br /><br />One interesting plant I saw on that list is a poppy that contains beta-carbolines.&nbsp; I&#039;ve actually smoked some self-harvested opium from this poppy, and I have to say it was the craziest opiate high I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; Me and a buddy smoked it together and spent the next three hours tiptoing through downtown in slow motion.<br />We were even doing those cartoony huge steps as we were tiptoing.&nbsp; Lots of odd stares from folks, but hey, it was a blast.

I feel that a psychedelic is a drug that induces a state of psychedelia, &quot;mind-manifestation.&quot; I feel that a lot of dissociatives are psychedelic for this reason. So to me, cannabis is psychedelic, although not in a way similar to &quot;classic&quot; psychedelics, because it has the heavy propensity toward shifting one&#039;s style of thinking. I have trippy experiences on weed often, due to low tolerance... so although we may now be disagreeing on pedantic definition, I really do have to say where I&#039;m coming from if only to make sure you know I acknowledge our difference.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23335.msg244504#msg244504">Quote from: ProudCannabian on May 17, 2012, 02:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychedelic_plants is a list of many &quot;psychedelic&quot; plants.&nbsp; Yes it includes MJ/THC as a psych.

				For salvia I was using a normal lighter in a metal pipe. I heard the strong flame lighters are more effective but after smoking a bowl, half way through smoking it hit me so hard I almost fell of my chair and my mates had to bring me back, also I was salivating and I have no memory of it what soever. Strong part of the trip lasted about 3-5 minutes and it gradually was coming down for the next 10 minutes still tripping though. It felt like people were not humans, but spirits, and people who were in the room with me were just beings in this universe with no body or faces. It was so intense it felt like I was trapped in a star and being a witness of some sort of spirit conference. I remember being in a similar place, like in Assasin&#039;s Creed nothing room, where everything around you is white and you are in a big emptiness. I had no laughter that time, the psychadelic part kicked in straight away, but the time I took it few times before it made me laugh to tears.

				Changa is great, got mine today... Smoked a really small dose, 0.05g (15mg of DMT) and I felt great.<br /><br />I am quite sensitive to weed, but smoke a good amount of sativa and come back saying it isn&#039;t psychedelic. I did it (and nearly passed out lol, too much too fast) and I was really tripping. Great OEVs and mindblowing CEVs.

				I&#039;ve only smoked 80x Salvia with a torch lighter through a regular pipe. I didn&#039;t take the time to form a respectful relationship with Sally first, though, and she kicked my ass. 7-8 massive hits, out of my body before the pipe was out of my hand, taken to a very dark place that scared me shitless. I learned a lot about my personal fears, though, and I wouldn&#039;t trade away any of the 4 times I&#039;ve danced with her.<br /><br />As far as the psychedelic nature of cannabis goes, I once saw my friend&#039;s face become a cross between a witch&#039;s face and a rat&#039;s, when he decided to make scary faces and mess with me while we were in his car in the middle of the night. No, it wasn&#039;t the face he was making alone, I perceived him as having a slight snout (not proportionately as long as a rat&#039;s but definitely there), among other less pronounced changes.<br /><br />On separate occasions I&#039;ve had powerful headspace shifts, and I&#039;ve noticed as powerful a coherent increase in creativity as I&#039;ve had on acid or shrooms. I specify coherent because I have more pronounced increases on acid and shrooms but by the time I&#039;m at that point I can&#039;t properly express the creative insights I arrive at, I can only try.<br /><br />I would call particular strains at or above particular levels psychedelic.

				I agree with poolsclosed. &quot;Psychedelic&quot; describes experience, not neurochemistry.<br />Cannabis can be used to produce full-on psychedelic experiences of an unique kind, in higher-than-&quot;getting high&quot; doses.<br />To me, it&#039;s not only a psychedelic, but a very good and interesting one.
