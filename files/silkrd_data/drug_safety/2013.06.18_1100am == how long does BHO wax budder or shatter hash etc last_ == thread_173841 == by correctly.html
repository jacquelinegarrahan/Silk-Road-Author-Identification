				This is something I&#039;d like to know. From &quot;Cannabis Alchemy&quot; oil made from ethanol was of a better quality, I think, but deteriorated the fastest, especially when exposed to light. I had some Nigerian hash oil that I kept in a little porcelain chemistry crucible covered with cling film, in the dark but it was very warm- UK summer- didn&#039;t have a fridge; at first the oil blew my head off, but after a couple of weeks, it had less than half the potency. When I recently bought some budder, for the first time, I smoked it faster than I needed to because I was worried about it deteriorating, but since then, I read an American vendors claim about his glass concentrate that it was very stable, so, yes, I would be very interested to hear what other people have to say on the subject.
