				Well I bought some drugs off the silk road and I gave them to my young friend. It was his bearthday and he had never tried drugs.<br />It woz the other day at his crib, his parents are on holiday and he had the place to himself.<br /><br />I gave him a gram of mdma and a 0.5 gram of cokane.<br />All was washed down with a glass of redbull.<br />After 45 minutes he woz well happy and he wanted more so I racked up some lines of mephedrone.<br /><br />He was passing out almost and I helped him snort a fat line of mephedrone. He took this and went to&nbsp; lie on the sofa now sweating profusely and eyes rolling about not focussing on ne think.<br /><br />After an hour or two he was not talking but his heart was racing I could see it. His eyes were open and looking about. I though he is high and happy and buzzing like ne think.<br /><br />He was no fun now so I put a blanket on him and went to do my own thing, I took his key and came back with beer and munchies for the next day . When I came back like a few hours later he was still. but I thought/hoped he must just be sleeping it off. I was still buzzing by this point (speed, mephedrone and a pill), so just put some more chunes on and played video games.<br /><br />I wanted to go home when I had come down and had a beer and forced a bag of crisps down. This was probably 12 hours after he took the drugs and he was still a sleep.<br />So I just tucked the blanket around him hoping for the best and left his key on the kitchen counter. I pulled his house door closed and locked behind me thinking I&#039;ll return the next day and he will be ok.<br /><br />Next day I get no answer from knocking his door, his phone just keeps ringing out and I can here it from the door.<br />I cannot see in as we had the curtains closed in case any relatives visited.<br /><br />Help, what do I do? It has been a day or two now and I have been back to knock on his door and now his mobile is just ringing out straight to answer phone like the battery is dead.<br /><br />I cannot call police or ambulance because if he really is dead then I will get fucked!<br />If I smash a window to get in then they will ask how I knew he was there and in trouble.<br /><br />I have not texted him ne thing incriminating or ne thing so maybe I should just act normal and deny all knowledge.<br />It will just look like some kid OD&#039;d.<br /><br />I am tearing my hair out over this now but cannot tell ne one!

				Only one way to save your friend and revive him ... MOUTH TO ASS RESUSCITATION - keep blowing air while inserting your tongue every 4 seconds - example blow blow blow thrust then repeat. Keep this going for 3-4hours - HURRY!!!

				I am not irresponsible.<br />I FEEL responsible for this but what can I do now other than hate myself.<br /><br />Spend the next years of my life think WHY.<br /><br />Why did I not look up drug safety?<br />Why did I encourage him to take the drugs?<br />Why did I not just flush the drugs and call an ambulance when I felt uneasy at his lack of life signs?<br />Maybe I am a prick and was just enjoying my roll too much to let some fucked kid spoil it for me.<br />This is what make me feel even more guilty!<br /><br />He might not even be dead. What if he was just pulling a prank on me?<br />What if he is sitting there right now drinking my beer having a laugh?<br />If this is true then I will kill him.

				To all the haters on this thread:<br /><br />I came here for advise, not to be called a dickhead and a troll.<br /><br />How would YOU feel if you had somehow had a small part to play in someones untimely demise?<br /><br />How would YOU feel if some 12 year old young lad wiv hole life ahead of him had possibly OD&#039;d off YOUR drugs?<br /><br />Some people make me sick :(

				Didn&#039;t read the thread (it can only be troll ... really .... ?)<br /><br />Did you seriously give someone 1.0grams of MDMA and 0.5 cocaine at the same time?&nbsp; Do you know the proper dosage of drug&#039;s yourself?<br /><br />That would kill a man easy as far as I can tell.&nbsp; The MDMA alone even if it doesn&#039;t kill you, 10 points of it AT ONCE?&nbsp; WTF?<br /><br />LOL I just read you say that you&#039;re more worried about your mom grounding you then you are about your friend.&nbsp; Great job representing the drug community / children ... community bro, you are more definitely the Einstein or Feynmann of our time.

				Can you come up with a better troll thread next time?&nbsp; Like an adverse reaction to a normal amount. <br /><br />And I could see some dumbass journalist reading the OP and writing sensationalized bullshit about all the deaths caused by SR.&nbsp; Big brother might not be able to do much, but a dead kids mother has lead to the demise of more than one good thing.<br /><br />People are too stingy with drugs for this to have been remotely believable.

				It&#039;s kind of hard to understand slip, he speaks a rare dialect of tard, but I just so happen to speak fluent tard (I studied the tard language in collage), so I went ahead and translated all his posts, turns out he&#039;s saying the same thing in every post:<br /><br /><br />HEY YOU GUYS....PAY ATTENTION TO ME!!!

				OMFG, I&#039;ve just wasted too much of my life reading this BS.<br /><br />At first I thought I felt sick to my stomach. How could you be so cavalier with someones safety?<br />The fear of having someone close to you die because of drugs is a concern many people will have felt in the past and you are playing with peoples feelings and emotions here.<br />But thank god you are just a troll. Looking at your further posts slip, you spout some unbelievable crap and are obviously trolling.

				&#039;some kid can&#039;t handle his drugz&#039;<br /><br />... LOL, you convince this kid that 1.0g MDMA and 0.5g Cocainie isn&#039;t a quantity of drug&#039;s that ... would kill most people (or at least seriously harm them), nevermind just these kids your talking about (are they superman&#039;s children?) that can&#039;t handle taking like 9 tab&#039;s worth of MDMA and a pretty hefty SINGLE dose of cocaine at the same time?<br /><br />No one can handle a fucking gram of MDMA and your admitting your a kid lol (aka you havnt done it for years so have no excuse you have some mad tolerance)<br /><br />This is one hell of a stupid troll thread, I mean now your saying kids are like super children who can eat 10 points of MDMA at once plus like 2 or more fat lines of coke?<br /><br />First if you are real, sorry, but noyou can&#039;t handle your drugs.&nbsp; If you think these quantities are normal, your dealer knows your a complete retard and is cutting your MDMA by like 10x on purpose because you think eating 10 points of it at once makes you like ... gangsta or something?<br /><br />Second, yes, you should kill yourself as you asked.&nbsp; One less troll, and if you&#039;re real, one less scum dealing dealer due to you being gone ... though he probably has a group of you and your friends convinced that 1.0g MDMA is a tolerable dose while simultaneously selling you the sweet n low he took from next to the coffee machine at work and selling it to you for MDMA value lol.
