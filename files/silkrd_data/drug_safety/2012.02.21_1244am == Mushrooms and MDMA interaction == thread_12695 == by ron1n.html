				I&#039;m not exactly sure of their interaction when it comes to brain chemistry and I can&#039;t seem to find any straight answers.&nbsp; The question is as follows:<br /><br />If someone is to ingest shrooms (for example) on a wednesday, and then do MDMA on the following day (thursday) will the MDMA lose any of its potency?&nbsp; Is there any kind of cross-tolerance or anything along those lines?&nbsp; Would it be better to do the reverse and do MDMA and then shrooms?&nbsp; Any input is appreciated, my friend asked me this question and I have no clue what to tell him.

				Do them both at once. Hippy flipping is amazing.<br /><br />And not sure about exact chemistry, but they both utilize serotonin so yes potency would diminish.

				Good question! Based on the experience I&#039;ve read, there should be no cross-tolerance, as they act on different receptors... or something along those lines. It makes sense, since hippyflipping is a pretty popular thing to do, I&#039;d imagine it wouldn&#039;t be so popular if there was indeed any MDMA and psilocybin cross-tolerance.<br /><br />I would recommend doing shrooms first, since there isn&#039;t much of a comedown when it comes to psilocybin. I probably wouldn&#039;t go the other way around, in case you hit the post-roll blues after MDMA saps all your serotonin. Taking shrooms while in this state is probably not so great of an idea, haha.

				I haven&#039;t noticed any cross-tolerance taking them on subsequent days. It&#039;s a good strategy for festivals to trip one day and do some MD on the next so you don&#039;t get burnt out. <br /><br />And yeah, taking them simultaneously is awesome, get the MDMA inside you first then when you start to come up, eat the shrooms. If you do it the other way round you risk vomiting and wasting the MD.
