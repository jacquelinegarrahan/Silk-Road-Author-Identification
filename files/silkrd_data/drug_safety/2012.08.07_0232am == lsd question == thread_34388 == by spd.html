				Kind of an odd question, and one&#039;s that&#039;s probably been brought up a bunch of times in different ways....but having trouble figuring out if the substance i&#039;ve taken is actually lsd, or some sort of RC.<br /><br />i&#039;ve done LSD quite a few times over the past 20 years - definitely enough where I know what to expect/etc.&nbsp; I got a 10-strip off of here from a well-respected vendor who hasn&#039;t sold here in some time.&nbsp; had a couple great experiences with it - was a very clean/profound trip off of 2-3 tabs, and ordered another strip to stock up.&nbsp; <br /><br />the next time i dosed wasn&#039;t at a good time for me - i had some physical issues at the time, but i ignored my better judgment and took 2.5 hits anyhow (this was from the 2nd strip I had just received) - and it wasn&#039;t a good experience - the come-up took so long, i almost thought it was bunk until around 2 hours in - and when it did kick in, it was obviously a psychedelic, but much less intense than i expected from the dosage.&nbsp; and combined with my physical problems at the time, wasn&#039;t a pleasant trip overall either.&nbsp; i just chalked it up to carelessness on my part , and resolved not to dose if i wasn&#039;t in the proper mental/physical state for it....didn&#039;t really think there was anything off with the actual product.<br /><br />Had a couple great trips (from the original strip) after that time....and now after a few months off, was looking forward to having another.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today, i dropped 3 hits off that second strip I received...very ready mentally and physically for an intense time, laid back with headphones on, waiting for the effects to kick in - and after an hour i felt only slightly off baseline, and didn&#039;t really notice anything significant until the 2 hour mark.&nbsp; at this time, felt real horny, and some mild visual distortions...and slightly sick.&nbsp; definitely some sort of chemical, as my appetite was completely gone as well.&nbsp; but definitely none of the trademark LSD effects - especially for 3 hits.&nbsp; &nbsp; just felt speedy and mild hallucinations...at around 5 hours after dosing, i took 2.5 mg of valium to see if it&#039;d take the edge off things, because what i was experiencing wasn&#039;t especially intense, but not enjoyable either.&nbsp; <br /><br />it&#039;s been around 6.5 hours now since I dropped, and besides a basic &quot;drugged out&quot; feeling, and lack of appetite, feel nearly back to normal.<br /><br />any ideas what could be wrong with this stuff/what it is?&nbsp; The first time I figured was just a bad experience, this 2nd time resembles that first time so much, that it seems as though it can&#039;t be coincidence, especially since my set/setting was perfect this time around.&nbsp; was on standard sized tabs, unperfed WoW, and only kept it on my tongue a minute or so, then swallowed.

				You ever swallow your tabs right away like pills?&nbsp; Also what was the sensation of the blotters? Tasteless? Stinging? Numbing?&nbsp; Bitter? Taste like a snickers bar?

				Usually just keep it on my tongue for a few minutes than swallow....that&#039;s the way i was told to do it way back when, and kept it up out of tradition.&nbsp; Plus I figure a few minutes is enough to notice any really odd taste, but not long enough for an NBOME-type compound to take effect.<br /><br />Tabs were pretty much tasteless - and appeared/tasted identical to the first batch i got that was definitely killer WoW.&nbsp;

				Personally, always takes me almost exactly a half hour.&nbsp; And when it hits, it&#039;s a pretty unmistakable feeling, so only feeling slightly odd after an hour was definitely unusual for me.&nbsp;

				The NBOME series isn&#039;t orally active, you have to take it sublibgually. If you&#039;re game to be guinea pig, don&#039;t take any psychadelics for a couple of weeks then try these tabs again and swallow them straight away. If you don&#039;t get anything I&#039;d be betting on NBOME. From your experience I might also lean towards this as it could be a diminished experience from the small amount of time you kept the tabs in your mouth.<br /><br />The other common chemicals on tabs are the DOx series. They are orally active, but you can tell these by the trip length. It can be 18+ hours. If you were down in the time you mentioned I&#039;d say it&#039;s probably not DOx.<br /><br />All of this is from second hand research only though, I haven&#039;t tried either of the above myself, so take this with a grain of salt.<br /><br />One last option is a really low dose of LSD, i.e. it was lower than advertised or has degraded in the heat/air/moisture. If you really want to find out you&#039;ll need a test kit.

				Yeah, definitely wasn&#039;t a DOx compound judging by the length - a couple hours after I took that valium (around 7 hours after dosing) - some of the effects started to intensify again, but more of a just speedy feeling, combined with some weed, it wasn&#039;t unpleasant but didn&#039;t feel like lsd at all.&nbsp; around 9 hours in , got hungry, ate smoked, and it had pretty much worn-off, felt like an acid comedown somewhat, and couldn&#039;t sleep til around 13 hours in when i took some more valium.&nbsp; feel totally normal now after sleeping.<br /><br />Really didn&#039;t seem to be weak/degraded LSD - I&#039;ve taken small dosages plenty of times, and it just didn&#039;t feel the same as taking even a weak 75ug hit, though i supposed took 300.&nbsp; and the speedy effects/visuals/body load weren&#039;t anything like I&#039;ve had on acid before.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t feel like wasting money on a test kit for the small amount I have left...though I might try taking just one hit and swallowing immediately as you suggested.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never taken less than 2.5 tabs of this stuff - and while it wasn&#039;t a good experience, it had enjoyable moments, so i dont see one doing much harm even if it is active when immediately swallowed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wondering if this was just an improperly laid batch or something (it was stored properly on my end, exactly the same way as the first batch which lasted months with no problems).&nbsp; it was the Munchies WoW which I don&#039;t think received any bad reviews on here, and he didn&#039;t even seem to scam on his way out.&nbsp; Not even trying to talk bad on the vendor, as he&#039;s long gone, and I had a lotta great experiences from the first batch I got from him - more just disappointed that I don&#039;t know what I have, and doesn&#039;t look like a great time on here to get more real stuff.

				Hmm. Based on that extra information I&#039;m going to lean towards low dose of LSD with impurities. This is another area I don&#039;t have a lot of personal experience in I&#039;m afraid, but maybe it was enough to get you to a low end area of the sought after effects, but the impurities gave you the negative effects you&#039;ve mentioned and coloured the rest of the experience. If it&#039;s not NBOME or DOx then this is the only scenario I can think of that accounts for everything. I have had really &#039;clean&#039; Lucy and I&#039;ve had less than clean as well, so I definitely see impurities as an option, but it&#039;s hard to say one way or the other without a test or being able to try the product myself :P<br /><br />If it hasn&#039;t done you any harm I guess you take that as a win and a lesson of who to be careful (not talking shit myself, but if a vendor&#039;s product isn&#039;t up to scratch the community needs to know. They may not even know themselves, as not all dealers are users hey?)
