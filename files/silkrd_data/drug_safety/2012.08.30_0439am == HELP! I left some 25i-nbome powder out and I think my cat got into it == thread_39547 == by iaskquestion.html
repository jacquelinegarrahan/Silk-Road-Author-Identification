			<dd class="postbody">
				so last night i had left a line of 25i nbome powder on my desk that was at the concentration on 500ug per 100mg. I had put a small box over it, and when I woke up this morning the box was knocked off my desk and the powder was scattered. Now my cat is missing. I suspect she got into the powder and is tripping right now and lost in the neighborhood. She goes outside a lot, and she always comes in when I call for her. This time, she is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />i forgot to mention that snorting this powder basically feels like snorting air. you literally can&#039;t feel a thing. After snorting it i always think there was some powder left in the straw or something because it&#039;s hard to believe that I had just insufflated something <br /><br />So i guess my question is: Do you think its possible that she sniffed up enough powder to make her trip or even worse OD?&nbsp; Do you think its possible for a cat to accidentally trip off of a powder at that concentration? My cat usually comes up and sniffs stuff that she&#039;s interested in, but she doesn&#039;t full on snort it if u know what i mean. I am really worried. Any thoughts will help <br /><br />

				You&#039;re a bit of a fuckwit for leaving any dangerous materials unsecured with pets around. Take more responsibility for the wellbeing of your pet. This doesn&#039;t go for just drugs, but anything harmful, certain foods/plants/household supplies/etc. Poor cat.

				Get&nbsp; a burlap sack. Find the cat. Gently place her inside said sack. Go to the nearest natural body of water. Ensure it is more then 5 feet deep. +1 If water is moving/running/flowing or otherwise not still. Toss said sack into water with all of might. Profit. Or at least sleep easy. Problem solved. Your 25i will never go missing again.

				That is a harsh and unnecessary reply, Shroomeister.<br /><br />Drugs interact with animals a lot different than they do with humans, and given this is a fairly new substance I bet there is no research at all into effects on animals so there is no way to know if your cat is tripping, poisoned, or completely unaffected and just off for a longer walk than normal. And sadly at this point there is really very little you can do about it.<br /><br />Keep an eye out, keep calling, and just hope the cat comes back ok. It is not uncommon for cats to be sleeping somewhere for a long time or simply ignore you, even if its out of character.<br /><br />And lesson learned for future.

				guys, i know what i did was absolutely retarded. It really doesn&#039;t help telling me how retarded I am. I&#039;m looking for useful information about cats and if anyone knows if when they sniff stuff to check out what it is, if that&#039;s enough to make them trip. Keep in mind that it was only concentrated at 500ug per 100mg.&nbsp; Also, how many micrograms do you think it would take to make a cat trip?<br />

				If it will effect the cat, then doses as a general rule go by body mass, cats are only ~5kg so will take a hell of a lot less than needed for humans...<br /><br />They have extremely sensitive noses, keep in mind how much they go mental just sniffing one leaf of catnip, however since in this case the powder would actually have to go into the cat&#039;s nose, I imagine it wouldn&#039;t have had much at all, but we don&#039;t know how long it sniffed for or even if it tried to lick it.<br /><br />As I said, there is no way at all to know all you can do is wait for your cat to come back. Kinda sucks and for what its worth, I hope its ok and does come back.

				thanks for your informative post.&nbsp; but wouldn&#039;t licking it not have any effect since its not orally active? or are u saying that just having on the tongue for long enough will do it?

				Glad you found her man. If she is tripping I must say I&#039;m surprised. I wouldn&#039;t think a cat sniffing would actually get any powder in their nose (my cats don&#039;t sniff that hard) and you&#039;re correct about NBOME not being orally active.<br /><br />Only thing I can think of is that maybe it absorbed sublingually, or maybe (in fact almost definitely) the enzymes in a cats stomach are different, perhaps enough to allow it to be orally active.<br /><br />Vets is a good idea right now though, just say they&#039;re acting weird and you&#039;re worried. Good luck.

				meh 25i is less likely to cause vasocontriction so I think the cat will be fine *psychically*, however if the cat would have taken 25C or a super high dose of 25D, god knows what would have happened.

				Watch out though your cat might also decide that it want to get away from the man and move out and live in a cat commune where cats spray eachother freely, only eat vegetables, and have catnip every day. Than he might go to new orleans and trip at a cemetary with a kitty night walker. <br /><br />

				be more careful with drugs in the future, cats are not the only thing that could come in to contact with powder just left laying around, this is a lesson so learn it quick next time you might be so lucky, you have to be responsible if you use drugs, there are always inersent people around.&nbsp;

				If you are in the US, i&#039;d reconsider the vet idea. Doctor-patient confidentiality doesn&#039;t really apply if the patient is an animal, and a vet may just inform the police about both animal abuse and drug possession.<br /><br />Since the cat seems to be physically okay for know there would be little reason to assume it will turn for the worse anytime soon. You could even consider administering a dose of diazepam or such to calm it down. It is about as effective as it is in humans, but consider the body weight. 1 mg of diazepam to a cat is probably equal to about 20 mg for you.

				fuck the cat man,&nbsp; the point here is you have to adopt a more grown up attitude when it comes to drugs in general. you cant leave any powder laying about and expect no halm to come of it, it makes no difference if its 25i or wot ever, these are powerful chemicals that can effect other innocent people or a cat in this case, that didnt expect to come across what you couldnt be bothered to put away,<br /><br />Treat drugs with the respect they diverse or you will soon wish you had.......

				Oh no that poor cat. <br /><br />Once Project MKUltra officially got underway in April, 1953, experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes, &quot;people who could not fight back&quot;, as one agency officer put it.[31] In one case LSD was administered to a mental patient in Kentucky for 174 days.[31] LSD was also administered to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions. LSD and other drugs were usually administered without the subject&#039;s knowledge or informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code that the U.S. agreed to follow after World War II. The aim of this was to find drugs which would irresistibly bring out deep confessions or wipe a subject&#039;s mind clean and program him or her as &quot;a robot agent&quot;

				i hope youre cat is ok. myself clean after&nbsp; every line the desk/mirror becuse of my animals i can´t imagine what such an dose would hurt/tripping&nbsp; an animal when the same dose fuck up an human. so please prepare your doses next time and give it away&nbsp; from your pets. i think 25i is so potent that it will maybe bring permanent damage to an animal. but nothing against you my cat had also tryed unfortanely 2-3mg mxe and he was like a crazy cat i´m lucky he don´t die. till this point i alway measure my doses on the bathroom with closed doors. <br /><br />ps: my cat loves the smell of molly :)
