				I&#039;m looking to make some unique molly caps. I&#039;m thinking of using amphetamine (not meth so it lasts no longer then the MD) or 4-MEC, or anything else that is suggested and isn&#039;t dangerous. I tend to take MDMA alone to avoid the increased neurotoxicity from mixing with uppers, but once in a while it&#039;s nice to have an E pill experience without having to buy pills!<br /><br />Any suggestions welcome : D

				Combining MDMA with Amphetamines increases the neurotoxicity, and caffiene has had some nasty combination effects as well. I&#039;d say if ANYTHING, add some magnesium for decrease the jaw clenching, maybe a little ketamine.

				Before you go too crazy adding stuff in there you might want to just try a little MDA and see if that rocks your boat. Lasts a little longer, more visually interesting. Could be the fun you are looking for. I&#039;m pretty sure after doing MDMA and MDA alone I actually like the high I get from MDA a little better. Very similar but MDA just wins out for me.

				I personally recommend combining MDMA with 2c-b. If you take your MDMA per usual habit and take 10-25 mg of 2c-b on the back half of your roll I think your mind will be blown.. It&#039;s a truly beautiful experience. Can be fairly intense though, it would be best to know before hand your reaction to 2c-b so that things don&#039;t get out of hand&nbsp; ;)

				I really appreciate combining the psychedelic qualities of MDMA with other&#039;s that have similar effects but are more prominently psychedelics.&nbsp; These include LSD, mushrooms, 2C-B, and other&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read a lot about taking MDMA and then 2C-B on the downswing of the roll.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried this, but taking them at the same time is INCREDIBLE! :D<br /><br />If anyone is interested in custom caps of these I offer them on my vendor page. :)

				First of all, thanks for All the suggestions! Zubic is the only combo I haven&#039;t tried- I think that&#039;s the winner! <br />A1126 Thanks for pointing out the increased toxicity- I&#039;m a total drug geek as well ; )&nbsp; <br /><br />2C-B on the downswing- Yea baby! It also seems to reduce the neruotoxicity as evidenced by a happier more intelligent recovery time period- I&#039;ma big fan!<br /><br />I&#039;ll never forget being at STS9 at a festival with a lady I (rudely) hooked up with that came with my dick-of-a-weed-dealer at the time- <br />Flying high over the crowd, unable to see my body : D I love impromptu Out of body experiences!!!

Also, I tend to get a fair amount of euphoria/nostalgia from it though it really doesn&#039;t mix well with insomnia. I figure that plus mdma would be a nice mix due to the added speediness and other stimulating effects without adding to the mdma crash that a lot of people seem to get. Personally, I prefer straight mdma, though I haven&#039;t tried candyflipping yet.

				my favorite mdma mixes thus far have been with lsd and dmt on separate occasions... absolutely incredible. mdma + lsd is called &quot;candy flipping&quot; for a reason, that&#039;s for sure! everything looked like it was candy-coated, just so beautiful. i have never felt so full of life and love as when i smoked dmt while rolling.
