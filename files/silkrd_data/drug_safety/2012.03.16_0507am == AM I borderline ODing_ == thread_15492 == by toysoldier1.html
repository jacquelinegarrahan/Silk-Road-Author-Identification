				Just did a shot of heroin 10 mins ago.&nbsp; I can barely stay awake, and everything is spinning like when you get really drunk and you are about to throw up.&nbsp; My pupils are also really small.&nbsp; Feels like if I close my eyes I will immediately pass out.&nbsp; &nbsp;My hands are pretty white as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you guys think I did too much? Im kinda worried.

				How are we supposed to know? If you really think it&#039;s a possibility call 911. At the very least get someone else to watch you while you&#039;re high so they can call for you if it becomes necessary or stop you from choking on your own vomit.

You seem to be somewhat responsive :/ Tell your roommate you ingested way to much alcohol and are worried your going to choke on your vomit and to have him keep an eye on you for a few?

				Sounds like you were just nodding out to me, which is what happens when you do dope. Nausea is also common with new users. If you ODed you wouldn&#039;t be on here typing about . You&#039;re usually out soon after the injection. Out, as in not moving, dead weight, blue, etc...

				Damn, I just did one of tonys pebbles the size of a small matchead.&nbsp; &nbsp;A bit bigger than the dose I did previous where I thought I was ODing.&nbsp; I thought I was ODing before.... this time it was much more intense. Nodded off for an hour after the shot, then woke up sweating then went to the bathroom and threw up.&nbsp; That was probobly from like a 10mg dose.&nbsp; Is it normal to throw up after a strong heroin shot?<br /><br />Tonys pebbles are insanely strong.&nbsp; &nbsp;I see why he wont well to people who have never done heroin before.&nbsp; <br />I got this mosquito looking bite swelling on the injection site, think it is just a histamine reaction?

				are you new to heroin, have friends who do, or talked to anyone about it, really done any research about it? anyone whos got even minor experience with opiods would know about nausea and histamine reactions, and more importantly the things you can do to prevent them and be safer overall. everyone loves a good nod out sesh but be careful dude you cant be that reckless for long.<br /><br />you could also google this but your reaction is typical of taking too much fucking heroin and not using anti-histamine

				wow you don&#039;t really care about risk management do you? ??? <br /><br />If you thought you were ODing on that little dose, what in the hell would posses you to take MORE of the strongest H available on SR???<br /><br />No shit you would be puking your guts out, if you had taken more you would probably had passed out, vomited and choked to your death.<br /><br />Heroin deserves ALOT more respect than your giving it.. a little too much can and will take your life, as many others have found out too late...

				well the not remembering of being awake or passed out and time loss nodding off is most certainly the &quot;heroin experience&quot; along with the complete euphoria and removal of any suffering at all, as well the rush with iv im told. however the nausea, the shakes, and the vomiting are mosg certainly signs of &quot;TAKING TOO MUCH FUCKING HEROIN&quot; you wanna walk that line but also wanna approach it from the safe side if you had one care for your life. you can always take more but you cant go back and take less. any of this setting in? again google this shit, be safe, do less fucking heroin next time to find the right balance on that line. <br /><br />

				a bit careless??? you seriously fail to grasp the seriousness of the situation<br /><br />if you dont value your life than continue your recklessness but frankly you give every responsible user a bad name. your type is a motivating factor for drugs being illegal<br /><br />you are drastically underestimating the mass of a matchstick worth of dense bricked H. a matchstick head of powdered H is generally equivalent to around 30-50 mg, and you did a pebble the size of a matchstick which is going to be way more! why did you pull 10 mg out of your ass? i seriously doubt if weighed that would have been less than 50 mg. its no wonder youre sick...<br /><br />

				This is the last you will hear from toysoldier1.&nbsp; I am done posting on this forum.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are a few good posters here, but the majority have nothing to say that is worth hearing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I make a thread to get some advice if I was taking too much heroin or not and you guys call me irresponsible and throw it in my face?&nbsp; That does not help me be more responsible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, now that im sober I realize that I still had a big margin before I was at a fatal overdose level.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Later guys, thanks for the intelligent input.&nbsp;

Obviously we don&#039;t know all the facts, because that&#039;s up to you to tell us. But based on what you&#039;ve been posting, I&#039;m sure most of us aren&#039;t trying to start a flame-war and are only looking out for your well-being. You asked us what we all thought about the situation, so good or bad you&#039;re going to get our opinions. Now, let&#039;s all keep our cool and just be glad we&#039;re all alive.&nbsp; :D

				This guy makes me sick. OD&#039;ing isn&#039;t something to joke about, and anyone who has been fucked up on H and nodding hard knows that you can&#039;t type like he did in the first post it would look something like &quot;i amss obewadoeing&quot; If he was fucked up.<br /><br />I have tried to type and go to sites on the computer and not even been close to ODing just fucked up and when I read my I.M&#039;s they were just jumbled misspelled words making no sense.<br /><br />Sad attempt at trolling. I want to say really mean things about this guy, but he is even too low for that.<br /><br />Grow up!!
