				Hey guys and girls,<br /><br />Got a few questions for the psychonauts on SR!<br /><br />i&#039;ve never tried any psychedelic, so here goes..<br /><br />Just ordered 100mg of DMT from an vendor on site with good feedback etc.. Never tried DMT before, so, what is a good starting dosage? 50mg? bit more? <br /><br />Also ordered some 25i-NBOMe (600ug) which I&#039;ve also never tried, will 600 be too strong? <br /><br />Got a few coins left on my account, looking at either some TMA-2 or some 2C-C capsules..<br /><br />TMA-2 - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b706b52789<br />2c-c - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5b62e56f8f<br /><br />Which one would you recommend? I&#039;d like to enjoy eye visuals and vibrant colours, but something that leaves me in almost total control? Or what else should I try? <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				For DMT, 50mg is enough to breakthrough if smoked correctly. Some people would recommend that you start with a lower dose, but a lower dose isn&#039;t really going to prepare you for the sheer intensity of a breakthrough in my opinion anyways. Make sure your smoking method is effective though, you don&#039;t want to waste any. If you&#039;ve truly never tried any other psychedelic before, then DMT is going to blow your mind.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />As for 25i, I&#039;ve only had it a couple times and both times its been rather unpleasant. The comeup makes me feel sick and the high just doesn&#039;t feel clean.<br /><br />

				my preferred method of smoking dmt is sandwiched between weed, out of a bong. i always get where i want to be. i have no need to smoke it any other way. i&#039;ve never weighed dmt before smoking it, i just put enough in the bowl to cover the bottom layer of weed. the most important thing is to take big lungfuls, and hold each hit for 15-20 seconds. 600 Âµg seems like a good dose for 25i, i don&#039;t think it&#039;d be too strong. i would most definitely recommend trying 2c-b!

				Don&#039;t overlook LSD on your search. There really is nothing better than good Acid. It&#039;s the king of all psyhedelics, the most fun you&#039;ll ever have on drugs.

				Yeah I&#039;d take LSD over 25i-NBOMe any day. Actually I prefer LSD over all the drugs you mentioned, including DMT....<br /><br />But if you want me to say what one I&#039;d recommend of the drugs you listed...... then I&#039;d go with DMT.&nbsp; Try that first.

Posted for selfish personal gain too!<br /><br />Mushrooms WILL NOT keep you in control.&nbsp; There is a phenomena known as &#039;mind fuck&#039; that is a confusion or inability to use proper rational thoughts or linear logic.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen many people sit there and stare at the clock, able to read the time but inable to determine what the time &#039;means to them&#039;.&nbsp; in other words, how to translate the NUMBERS of the time to the concept of where in the day they were and when they&#039;d have other responsibilities.&nbsp; I have also seen people arguing with themselves about whether or not they should go swimming in the lake(when they don&#039;t know how to swim)!<br /><br />There are other better more gentle and lucid psychs.&nbsp; I would highly recommend LSD and 2C-B. You will be able to think with a clear head with added insight.&nbsp; Honestly some basic thoughts or concepts might be somewhat difficult to grasp and you may have some difficulty forming words and sentances that make COMPLETE sense to people &#039;not on drugs&#039;, but you won&#039;t be running out into the street or anything stupid. ;)<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love me some mushrooms, but I think they&#039;re best suited to tripping with others and a trip sitter.&nbsp; especially on high doses or your first time. I wish you the best of luck. Let us know how it goes! :D<br /><br />I would refuse to buy from Foxy simply based on the fact that this vendor is giving bad advice to people about drugs simply to sell her own wares.

				Be very careful if it&#039;s your first time. Do your research, and do not EVER consider a serious trip while unattended!<br /><br />ALWAYS get a friend to trip sit you! ALWAYS!<br /><br />If a friend who has free time for the block of time you want to trip refuses to trip sit you, he or she isn&#039;t a real friend.<br /><br />Real friends help you bury bodies, and abandoning you to trip solo is worse than snitching on you, because the police might shoot you, but if you trip solo, you might not die immediately.<br /><br />Always, always do research on a psychedelic before scheduling time to trip. PLAN IT IN ADVANCE!<br /><br />Treat the psychedelic with utmost respect, more respect than you would treat a loaded firearm.<br /><br />Remember to keep all aspects of a planned trip safe, sane, and consentual.

Psychedelics are very finicky things. People respond differently to different substances. I have personally been &quot;out of control&quot; on 4 grams of cubes, this included OEV and realistic auditory hallucinations, both of which caused me to flee from imaginary pursuers (pretty much the only &quot;bad trip&quot; I&#039;ve ever had). They were high-quality and very consistent mushrooms I&#039;d been getting from a very experienced grower for a long time, but because of my mindset going into the trip, things quickly spiraled out of control.<br />Acid, on the other hand, does tend to be a lot clearer for most people, but I&#039;ve also had to drag a friend out of a raging crowd at an animal collective concert because his whole body &quot;turned to mush&quot; and the visuals he was having made it hard for him to see. This was a two hit trip. Potentcy can to vary considerably from batch to batch, as can purity. The other thing about acid is that it might not really be acid. This is less of a risk on SR, but you can never know for sure. <br />If it&#039;s not acid than it&#039;s probably a research chemical. These are inherently more risky than shrooms or genuine LSD because of their limited clinical testing and shorter or more limited histories as widely consumed chemicals. A rare few have actually caused known fatalities (e.g. Bromo-DragonFLY). IMO research chemicals are just too risky, and I personally will never knowingly take one again. <br />That said, I think you&#039;re both giving advice that is true according to your own experiences, and reporting anyone to the mods (unless there is a pattern of behavior I&#039;m unaware of) doesn&#039;t seem necessary. <br />OP: remember, you can always take more a chemical, but you can&#039;t take it out once you&#039;ve dosed. Start slow, keep an open mind, and for the love of God try to secure a sitter, at least for your first time.

				Reporting back...<br /><br />Didn&#039;t have a breakthru with the DMT (only 50mg tried) in a glass pipe, another day will try again.<br /><br />Tried the 25i-NBOMe...<br /><br />Took a 600ug blotter thursday, took about an hour to come on, and boy it came on fast! <br /><br />Great mood change, euphoria, objects started to &quot;pop&quot;, things were warping, CEVs, red/green/blue open eye visuals and light trails, watched some simpsons episodes, not a single colour was normal :D<br /><br />Lasted about 4 1/2 hours then came down over another 2 or so hours.<br /><br />Did it again saturday night with 2 mates, took 3, all 2 hours apart, not as strong as thursday. Couldn&#039;t mix on the decks for fucking shit, neither could one of my other mates - and he can usually DJ while on almost any other drug. All in all wasn&#039;t a bad night with pretty much the same, lots of cheese and dead baby tazos LOL

I didn&#039;t advise him to take 2 hits of acid his first trip(though I think most people would be fine with that).&nbsp; I think the first time on a new substance(especially a psychedelic) should be on a low dose, in these circumstances, 1 hit.&nbsp; He can&#039;t for certain ascertain the potency(unless verified by the avengers), and honestly even if he could, he wouldn&#039;t know if it was going to affect him differently.<br /><br />Foxy: Really?&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure I should dignify that with a response, but for the greater good in the Drug Safety forum I&#039;ll elaborate and while doing so I&#039;ll endeavor to utilize monosyllable utterances so as to not be the cause of greater confusion or other discombobulation and discomfort for a personage such as yourself(challenged, shall we say?) you warthog faced baboon!<br /><br />I&#039;m aware that cubensis is a species.&nbsp; Who implied it was anything else?&nbsp; Did you know that not only can different species of mushrooms have differences, but mushrooms of the same species and even from the same patch or growing medium can and USUALLY do exhibit differences.&nbsp; I suppose grinding up mushrooms and encapsulating them as you do would ensure ABOUT as average of an experience as a person can get due to the nature of preparation.&nbsp; That is, the differences will be MOSTLY evenly distributed due to the grinding and mixing of powder of various shrooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition to this it should be noted that most people when growing cubes endeavor to isolate a particular phenotype even from a MS strain.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; That when you got your spore print or solution, it was a multi-spore example.&nbsp; This means there are MILLIONS of different spores all likely to create various phenotypes of the same genotype of a particular strain of cubensis mushroom.&nbsp; People that have some modicum of skill are generally in the practice of isolating the strain to get a more standard appearance and experience when consumed.&nbsp; This is done through various methods I won&#039;t delve into here.<br /><br />Google it, you&#039;ll see. ;)<br /><br />Who mentioned AMANITA&#039;s?&nbsp; I fail to see how they fit in as they weren&#039;t being discussed at all.&nbsp; When referring to a skinny mushroom were you referring to the central American version of the cube, or something else such as the Ps. Cyanescens?&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;ll agree that the smaller skinnier Mexican cube is more potent BY WEIGHT, but smaller mushrooms generally are.&nbsp; Once again, do your research ignoring Wikipedia as it&#039;s unreliable at best.&nbsp; I&#039;d actually recommend written works for reliability.&nbsp; Look into Stamets.<br /><br />What do visuals have to do with the safety and functioning capacity of a person. I can see crazy visuals both when I do and don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea to walk across a busy interstate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">CUBENSIS is DIFFERENT.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You sure about that? Ok, well I&#039;ll bow to your expertise.&nbsp; Since you&#039;re so fluent with grammar I&#039;m sure you know what you&#039;re talking about. Besides, now you&#039;ve posted it on the interwebs so it MUST be true! *rolls eyes*<br /><br />Cubes ARE different from other mushies.&nbsp; Just like they&#039;re different from LSD.&nbsp; In fact, they&#039;re the industry standard.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d think we&#039;re contrasting them to other mushrooms though. We weren&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, you just stated(I&#039;ll quote it for proof) that a person who&#039;s under the &#039;introspective-ness&#039;-ness of cubes is able to make logical decisions and is capable of driving SAFELY?&nbsp; I&#039;m disgusted by this.&nbsp; I&#039;m ONCE AGAIN reporting this to the mods.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a person very close to me decimated to a couch for 10 hours by 1.1 grams of Brazilian cubes I GREW MYSELF.&nbsp; They were nothing special.&nbsp; In fact the night in question I was taking care of others while on 2.5g myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m saying this to contrast the difference in body chemistry and how people react to shrooms.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard people on mushrooms exclaim they&#039;ve figured out where zombies came from.&nbsp; They told me people on mushrooms invented zombies and that in order to get rid of the zombies we should just kill all the people on shrooms. <br /><br />CLARIFICATION:The people didn&#039;t ACTUALLY think we should kill people on shrooms but that the idea of zombies would quit being procreated if such action were taken.<br /><br />That being said, the idea that EVERY person would be able to function in any facsimile of normal is absurd.&nbsp; SOME people have a natural tolerance and MAY be able to function TO SOME DEGREE on a full 1/8th of an oz, but that&#039;s by far the exception. An 1/8 is for most people a full psychedelic dose inducing a full psychedelic state complete with visuals, hallucinations, and often, a trans-formative state in which a person has deep meaningful insights to their psyche and the world around them(this would be the introspective-ness you were referring to).&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure that a person who&#039;s earth is being shaken could be called &#039;capable of doing anything they could do sober with the exception of pupil dilation&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want sources cited for this try reading through some of &#039;The Psychedelic Experience&#039;.&nbsp; There are several vendors selling digital copies here on the road and if you&#039;re too much of a penny pincher to pay for information that could save the lives of your customers there&#039;s a copy of it on Erowid.<br /><br />In fact what you talk about, the &#039;wiping clean of the window&#039; is in fact a good description in some aspects.&nbsp; It strips away some of our misconceptions that society has programmed into us and lets us see things ina new light.&nbsp; However, realizing how impotent a police officer is and telling him so is probably not a good idea.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t seem like a bad idea in such a state.&nbsp; While you may be able to see things in a new way, you won&#039;t have the same filters on in your brain that tell you not to transform certain thoughts into actions(ie: walk into a road, flip off a police officer, not show up for work, call family members and speak with them about topics you&#039;ll regret later, drive a car, kill someone).&nbsp; Honestly, most people won&#039;t do those things as the filters have been HAMMERED into us, but in earth shattering trips(the kind you advertise) these things CAN happen. Telling people otherwise is one of the most irresponsible things I&#039;ve ever seen done.&nbsp; I cannot put into words how outraged I am.&nbsp; <br /><br />/WallOfText<br />/Rant<br />/Ownage
