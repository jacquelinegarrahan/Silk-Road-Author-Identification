				hello everyone. I had a strange, unbelievable lsd trip the other day, and i was hoping someone else has had the same experience. <br /><br />Anyway, I had recently ordered a 5 strip of juergen2001&#039;s lsd, and received them a few days ago. They are advertised as having <br /><br />300mgs per tab (possibly only 250, but thats still alot). Anyway, i have taken decent acid before, 3 or 4 tabs at a time, so i know <br /><br />what its like to trip. Anyway, the other night, i decided to take one and a half hits at around 10 00 pm. about 30 mins into the trip i <br /><br />started to get pretty intense visuals. my entire bedroom was melting. I sort of expected this however. I knew that this was probably <br /><br />the most lsd i had ever taken, so i was ready for something like this to happen. I was not ready, however, for what happened about <br /><br />2 hrs into the trip. I was watching a movie on my laptop in my bed. I was alone (prob a bad idea). It was strange, because while i <br /><br />was watching the movie, i felt aalmost as if i could see a 3d panoramic view of what was going on. This should be impossible, as <br /><br />this is a 2d screen obviously. Anyway. I glanced up from the screen for just a moment. The room was completely black, except for <br /><br />the soft glow of the screen. All of a sudden, as i was staring ito the blackness, the room erupted with these bright neon rainbow <br /><br />shapes that filled the entire room. I looked down at my hands and they looked like they were made of pure energy. I was <br /><br />completely dumbfounded, and just repeated to myself out loud, &quot;what the fuck is going on&quot;. These visions became more and more <br /><br />intense, so much so that it made me forget i had taken lsd, and that this whole event wasnt real. I though the world was ending. I <br /><br />had to keep checking to make sure i was still alive. I started to get a little frightened. I saw things i cannot possibly even describe. <br /><br />It felt as if i was on like a 2 hour dmt trip. I couldnt see my room, or the computer infront of me, only a see of random, impossible <br /><br />shapes made out of bright beautiful colors. When i was younger, i had always heard rumors of people taking acid, and literally <br /><br />hallucinating things that werent there, like cartoon characters or other rediculous objects. After the first couple times i had taken <br /><br />acid, i had assumed this rumors to be false. But what i saw the other night was about 300 times more intens than simple seeing a <br /><br />cartoon character in my room. Anyway, this whole ordeal lasted for a few hours. I actually needed to call my friend to come over <br /><br />and trip sit me, cause i was so surprised of what was going on in my head. Idk if it affected anything, but about 20-30 minutes <br /><br />before i had started to have these messed up visions, i believe i snorted about 100-120 mg of mdma, i am unsure, because i was <br /><br />still hallucinating pretty heavily. After this crazy, 2 hour interdimensional journey, my friend left and i attempteds to lay down and <br /><br />rest at about 3 or 4 in the morning. I knew i would not be getting any sleep for at least a couple hrs, but i could at least give it a <br /><br />shot. Crazy thing was, i ended up having pretty decent visuals for almost a total of 24 hours. From 10pm thursday night, to 10 pm <br /><br />friday night, i lay in my bed, tripping, mentally and physically exhausted, just trying to sleep. Eventually i managed to sleep, and <br /><br />today i am fine. I almost want to consume that same amount of acid again once i get my tolerance down. Now that i know whats in <br /><br />store, i can lay back in the complete darkness in my room, and perhaps listen to some music, while i further explore this new world <br /><br />i have discovered. I was just curious if anyone else had a similar experience on lsd, and if they could name this phenomenon, and <br /><br />explain more about it, and share their own experiences as well. anyone wishing to try this be warned: you will need a prolonged <br /><br />recovery period (over 24 hrs), so dont be expecting to be going to school or work the next day

				Seems like you had at least a +++ ego death trip. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had them triggered watching inception on 2c-I and a stupid strong dose of mushrooms.

				Glad I wasn&#039;t the only one who experienced this.&nbsp; After this I realized what it feels like to go insane from a drug like PCP or meth.&nbsp; You subconsciously know your tripping but you cannot control your actions and your literally on for the ride till it ends.&nbsp; Most insane trip I will probably experience.&nbsp; While the visuals were extremely vivid and detailed I can&#039;t say I enjoyed it.&nbsp; It was way too intense and I was acting like a retard to the sober.

				yea i was tripping so hard that i would completely forget i had took a drug and that nothing i was seeing was real. My point is nothing like thats ever happened to me before on acid. It was like i was in another dimension. What does it mean to have ego death? i forgot who i was for awhile though.

				Sounds awesome. The MDMA will definitely kick it up a notch.<br /><br />High doses of LSD are multidimensional and feel infinite, God-like and insane.<br /><br />Your thoughts basically become crystal clear like parallel dimensions. Anything you think will feel real. Sometimes it can get really out there.
