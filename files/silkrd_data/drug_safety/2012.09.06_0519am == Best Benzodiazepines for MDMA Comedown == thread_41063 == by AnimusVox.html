				This question is for those that have tried various benzodiazepines after an MDMA experience: which have you found eases you best into a deep sleep, and why? Xanax, Valium, etc.?

				I&#039;ve only tried Xanax. It kicks in pretty fast and really took away the edge of the comedown (physically and mentally). Smoking weed helped too.

				Valium. I always find that it will just let me doze off naturally, or even if I don&#039;t make me chill out and not stress about things. Xanax seems too artificial to me and though it can knock you out I will still feel groggy when I then get up. With Valium I just feel nice and rested after.

				If you&#039;re flying still I&#039;d use Klonopin (Clonazepam).<br /><br />If you just need a little help Tylenol pm works.<br /><br />If you want/need to sleep use Restoril (temazepam).

				if sleep is what you desire then i&#039;d recommend the hypnotic classes of benzos more than anxiolytic ones like xanax or valium<br /><br />the best results i&#039;ve had is with temazepam (restoril). after a night of candyflipping, i was tripping pretty hard when i took 3. half an hour later i was snoozing. best benzo for sleep imo

				Nitrazepam (mogadon) or mazzies to sleep.<br />Vallies and a bowl of chronic to chill the fuck out and have a smooth comedown.

				I&#039;ve only really tried valium, for MDMA or other stimulant come downs. It works pretty well, and although it doesn&#039;t always send me straight to sleep. It really takes the edge off the next day&#039;s paranoia/jitters.<br /><br />I wanted to try Xanax, because it seems to be shorter acting, might knock me out better. So I&#039;m interested in the recommendations for things better at actually getting sleep quicker. I suppose a higher dose of valium might do it, but it lasts so long, I wouldn&#039;t want to be too groggy the next day.<br /><br />But, if it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it. I&#039;m sticking with 10-20mg valium (taken at bedtime aka 4am or whatever) for comedowns for the foreseeable future, along with maybe 1 or 2 beers the next afternoon to chill out.<br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke weed, and to be honest, when I did, it didn&#039;t really help me either sleep or comedown. It would just tend to trip things out more! :)

				Valium&#039;s the best benzo for pretty much anything, except getting really fucked up (Xanax).

				I have heard that klonopin works the best from a lot of people.

				I would say Klonopin or Xanax,,,Klonopin has a longer half life,meaning it stays in you longer,<br />Xanax works instanly and u feel calm and can drift off to sleep if u wanna go to sleep..<br /><br />Valium imo as a benzo user of 10 years SUCKS!! Its better than nothing but its nothing compared to Kpins=klonopin<br />or Xanax=Alprozam.<br /><br />AND Indianpilldaddy it does not matter if its the banankins or regular klonopin one wont do any diffrent cause their the same active drug. The ones u speak of just taste good..LOL

				I say none because this is what first led me to becoming addicted to benzos! Try some ghb or something. I had the realization that if I needed the benzos to come off of MDMA, it just meant I was abusing the MDMA...there were some of those days after taking it where I literally couldn&#039;t get off the couch, this is not a good or happy place. If you just space it out more the comedowns arent bad at all.
