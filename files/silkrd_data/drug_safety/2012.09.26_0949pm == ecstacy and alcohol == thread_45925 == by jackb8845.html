				Hi guys! I&#039;m new to ecstacy and I only use alcohol for partying. Now I have some of those blue 200mg defqons and I was wondering is it good to take a couple of beers before I take the xtc pill or maybe I shouldn&#039;t mix alcohol with this?<br /><br />Thanks guys! :)

				Beers before hand goes just fine, just not too much. You say a couple of beers, if you mean like 2/3/4 beer that&#039;s no problem at all.<br /><br />Drop the xtc, I would advise to break it in half because 200mg on the first try is a little much, and don&#039;t drink any more beer for the next 3-4hours as it&#039;ll &#039;ruin&#039; your XTC feeling :)

				Deffies hit hard. Beer more then likely not needed. My buddy Male/Drinker/30&#039;s puke up his deffie 2 weeks ago after only have a &quot;few&quot; beers.<br /><br />Last week I saw someone puke up their deffie....and they werent drinking at all that night.<br /><br /><br />It hits you hard. You don&#039;t need booze. wait until it hits you full force and then see if you want to drink. You won&#039;t.<br />

				Like dude said, a few beers beforehand is fine, eat something I guess to avoid stomach ache, and sipping on a few beers during is pretty nice too if your partying but definitely mix in some, or a lot, of water which shouldnt be a problem drinking fluids feels good you might not have a desire to drink once it hits. For me, I&#039;m an alcoholic so it depends but I have had times when I had absolutely no desire for alcohol in a large social setting cause I was rolling so nicely. H20 though fo sho.

				Yeah eating a few hours before hand prevents stomach ache :)<br /><br />And Shroom, those &#039;deffies&#039; definitely hit hard, they are not to be underestimated. I can only recommend to use them half at a time

				I don&#039;t really like drinking on Mandy before but occasionally I&#039;ll sip something so long as it&#039;s spirits after but that&#039;s rare. I always think it&#039;s best to stick to the Evian...and feel young. :P

				if it&#039;s your first time with any substance i recommend taking only that substance by itself just so you can clearly get familiar with it&#039;s effects...i never mix substances until i know their effects individually....

				Probably best not to mix them. If you need a little to calm your nerves I&#039;d keep it to a beer otherwise you&#039;ll be fine one the M takes hold.

				Bob and Knomo nailed it. I always down about two cans of beer beforehand, then drop the whole pill (if its a defqon). Wait 35 minutes. Enjoy&nbsp; ;D

You cannot build a high stronger after initial dose.<br /><br />The Blue defqons are not 200 this is a straight LIE. They are probably closer to 160. Allmost all X vendors lie about the content, just like LSD.

				thanks for your help guys! :) My defqon pills are from SR and based on the reviews they should be quite good.<br /><br />the problem is that before the club everyone drinks some alcohol and if I don&#039;t they start to wonder why.. so maybe a couple of beers is fine. I just have to drink them very slowly :D when the real party starts no one will notice anymore if I&#039;m drinking just water hehe..<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you know how it goes! :)

				I once chugged 500ml(pint) and took an xtc pill that was probably more bath salts than mdma.<br /><br />Within about 30 minutes after taking it i was the most social person ever.<br /><br />But after about an hour i don&#039;t remember anything.&nbsp; I was lucky that i was in the middle of the woods<br />and didn&#039;t have to talk to authority because by the end of the night I was trying to fight someone <br />and i ran around the outside of my house in my underwear falling down and looking like a mess.<br />I don&#039;t remember anything that night except when i was at the party.&nbsp; I was lucky because when i woke up <br />i lost everything my phone my watch my glasses my hat and my wallet.&nbsp; I found all the items but ten dollars<br />so all and all i had a really fun night, but i made a fucking fool out of myself in the process I was lucky that <br />was in my home, and thats when i learn not to mix esctasy and alcohol.<br /><br />Not to mention the physcial effects i was probably under that could have led to my death.

				This stuff is great! I&#039;m never using alcohol again! :D Here is how the night went..<br /><br />I arrived at the house party around 9pm. My friends new house was very big so there were alot of people partying. Everyone was already VERY drunk so they didn&#039;t notice that I was drinking my first beer. I had a few laughs and some quite interesting discussions with some of my friends because they were so drunk and I wasn&#039;t, but basically I was just waiting for the club ;) At 11pm it was time to leave and everyone was going to the local pub because they have been drinking too much. Because of that I decided to call my best friend because I knew he was already in the city and going to a night club. I told him that I&#039;m going to try something &quot;new&quot; so that he doesn&#039;t wonder wtf is going on if I start to act like a crazy person :D He replied that he want&#039;s to try it too and as you might have guessed I didn&#039;t have anything against that. :)So I took a cab from the house party and told the driver to take me to the capital city center!<br /><br />When I arrived to the club I saw that there was a bit of a line. I guessed it would take about 20min for me to get in so I took a half defqon before I went in the line. This was a very exicing moment for me! After about 15min I got into the club and ordered a glass of water just to be ready for what&#039;s to come. As I was drinking my water it suddenly hit me. It felt like a love grenade had exploded in my head and at the same time my self confidence was extremely high. I literally felt like a king!!! I immediately noticed a couple of girls that were standing next to me at the bar. I thought - Damn! those are two of the most beautiful girls I&#039;ve ever seen! To my amazement I realised I also said those exact words to the ladies haha. I don&#039;t remember what else I said but I definitely said alot :D At this point I remembered that my friend is also here somewhere. I took the girls with me and headed to the tables. I saw my friends sitting so I started heading towards them with the two girls I had just met. Although english is not my native tongue I shouted whazzaaaaa!!! Then I hugged my frend and said &quot;Guys, have you ever seen ANYTHING this beautiful?!&quot; and I pointed at the two girls. Their faces started to become red and everyone was laughing :D So we sat down and had some fun with the girls and my friends. At this time I also noticed that my friend had been drinking very much so I wasn&#039;t sure if I should give him the ecstasy after all..<br /><br />It had now been about 2 hours since I took the first half so I decided to take the other half..another 20min went by and &quot;GODDAAMNNNNN!!!!! :DDDD &quot;Let&#039;s go to dance everybody!!!&quot; It was the first time I felt like a really good dancer ;D Oh well, at least the girls seemed to have fun dancing with me.Then it was time to leave because the night club was closing. One of the girls invited us to her place for the afterparty so we went. It was about 5am so I took another half of defqon. My friend also took a half although he was very drunk. Just to remind you I had now taken one and a half defqon. This half didn&#039;t hit me that hard but definitely felt good. As you might have imagined we had great time with the girls ;) After a few hours people started to get really tired and the girls were asleep. It was now 10am in the following day so me and my friend decided to go to a underground party place in the capital city. So we ordered a cab and off we went!<br /><br />The underground party was crazy. Everybody was on something and acting crazy :D I decided to take another half of defqon so at this point I had taken two. Another hour went by but there was no rush. I barely felt it. Suddenly a girl walked by and I saw that there was a hole in her head and her brains were showing..wtf?! Then I looked at her again and she was completely normal. At this point I knew I had taken too much..<br />So I was seeing all kinds of things and it also seemed like I couldn&#039;t pee anymore. My legs felt like they were made of concrete - I was barely able to move. I sat down and decided to rest until I&#039;m clear headed. I felt very calm and good but at the same time I knew I was completely out of it :D So I rested about half an hour.. or so I thought. When I finally got up and decided to go home from the underground party it was 2pm!<br /><br />So basically with two defqons I partyed nicely for 14 whole hours :D When I got home I instantly fell a sleep and slept like a baby for 12 hours. When I woke up I felt really good and quite refreshed actually :D<br /><br />No hangover, nothing, only fun.. too good to be true. :)

				!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Welcome to the &quot;club&quot; mate.<br /><br />Sounds like you did it right, if not maybe a bit too much ;)<br /><br />Next time (now that you know) You can start with a whole one and then boost once with another half. As you learned anything beyond that will not get you back there, you have milked your brain dry.<br /><br />You may feel refreshed today (the next day), but you still may feel lethargic and &quot;dumb&quot; a bit tomorrow still. That is normal.<br /><br />PS - fuck man after parties till 2pm...... I wanna come hang out in your town!<br />

Surprised you had no hangover from all that, but sounds sweet man glad you had such a blast. I would be careful about replacing alcohol with MDMA, aka getting into the habit of using it every week or more. Thats bad news, but otherwise I&#039;m glad you had such a righteous first roll.

				Oh how I love the blue Defqon, I usually take 3/4 of the pill then about an hour later take the rest. Its hit me hard on both occasions, the panicky, anxious come up for about 5 minutes then BOOM blissful euphoria. NOTHING beats coming up on a pill like the defqons. I know the moment that anxiety and panic hits me and then I&#039;m slammed with beautiful euphoria its going to be a fucking good time. :)

Also, the depression usually takes a day or 2 to manifest. For me it&#039;s less of a depression and more of a general annoyance with EVERYTHING and EVERYONE.<br />However this can be avoided by taking a 5-htp every 8 hours, for the next 3 days after rolling.<br /><br /><br />Also, as for how often, well 3 weeks to about a month is the time required to reach baseline again. The tolerance is completely worn off. I believe the drug to be mildly nuerotoxic. However I think that using it at most every 2 months is probably equivalent to, or healthier than, taking Adderall(which is basically Dexedrine) every day. I wait a full 6 months between uses, but thats mainly because I use it for a semi-spiritual ritual. However I use 2c-i, 2c-e and other phenethylamines on a regular basis (1-2 times a month).

				It my help you get girls but good luck smashing girls, its pretty much impossible to get a boner without Viagra let alone bust a nutt. Not to even mention the shrinkage it does to you whist you&#039;re rollin!&nbsp; <br />I try to leave it one month plus. I have lots of C/B Vitamins everyday though, along with other vitamins. I also take 100mg of 5htp for 2 days after I take MDMA then 50mg for a further 3 days. I&#039;d recommend you drink a glass of full fat milk everyday too as this contains a lot of tryptophan. <br />I&#039;m also about to start taking piracetam daily as well, its a nootropic that&#039;s said to help maintain the MDMA &#039;magic&#039; as long as you keep it sensible. As well as being a very good smart drug!<br />If you take a full defqon in one go, expect it to hit you hard and good. ;) You&#039;ll be nice and fucked up!

Secondly, what country you from? Don&#039;t start thinking that you need ecstasy to get girls man, I guarantee thats not true. All you gotta do is take pussy off a pedestal. Yeah sipping on a couple drinks never hurt with breaking the ice, but dude, you need to build the self-esteem and confidence to get chicks interested because you are cool, because you are smart, funny, whatever the fuck you are I&#039;m sure you something good. That MDMA love is some phony shit.

				Thanks for the advice guys! Yeah It seems to be quite difficult to get an erection with this stuff hehe..&nbsp; ;D I live in Finland so it&#039;s quite normal here that people get wasted every weekend. Drugs are a different story though so that&#039;s why I don&#039;t want to advertise to my friends that I&#039;m &quot;using&quot; something. :)<br /><br />So I should wait one month or longer between rolls. I think this will reduce my alcohol use a little. I suppose I will be sober until my next roll. :)<br /><br />However, I need to purchase more ecstasy though hehe.. I was wondering if I should try those Ferrari/Shield pills or should I stay with defqons? At least I know defqons are good but I&#039;ve also read some good reviews about those Ferrari/Shields too.<br /><br />Let me know what you guys think. =)

				The defqons are some of the best out there. Most people would not argue that.<br /><br />What you SHOULD do is get yourself a test kit. They are easy to use and this way you know you are what you are eating.<br /><br />What you want is a &quot;Marquis test&quot;.

				soooo it&#039;s 5am here and the party is about over. Some people still want to go to the underground club to party through the morning but I&#039;m already a bit tired. Somekind of defqon festival soundtrack is playing here and it&#039;s all good. I had a very fun evening although people in the club were a bit young for my taste and too drunk.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I took the first half of F/shield around 23pm and it was superb. Very smooth and lasted until 1am. Then I took the other half but I felt that I have too much now. Now kick, just basic happy and my legs were like concrete again. <br /><br />Apparently these F shields are very powerful so for me even a full one seemed to be too much. So maybe a 1/2 and 1/3 next time. :)<br /><br />happy day to you guys!

				Does anybody out there do the old &quot;therapeutic&quot; re-dose where you take 1/3-1/4 of the original amount right when you first start peaking (about T+60-90 mins)?&nbsp; We call it &quot;therapeutic&quot; because this was supposedly common practice among psychologists conducting MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with their clients.&nbsp; It is supposed to extend the total experience by about an hour and avoids the &quot;oh, shit, coming down, better take more&quot; feeling that can disrupt the consistency of the roll.&nbsp; It&#039;s also supposed to be less neurotoxic than just a straight re-dose, and it saves a bit more gear for later.&nbsp; The ILF does think it works, but the only problem is remembering to take more when you actually don&#039;t feel like you need anything else in the world to be happy, lol.

				I find that following the initial dose with 1/2 of the initial dose at T+1:00 is perfect in terms of duration, experience, cost, and comedown. Every time I go beyond that I&#039;m disappointed in one way or another. This is assuming an ~125mg initial dose. If you&#039;re dropping full defqons, taking another &#039;half&#039; is totally cheating (you&#039;re forgiven. those blue delights were hard to resist).

By that time I usually get impatient and take some more MDMA :) But my girlfriend (she takes same powder but in much less quantities) starts to roll like in 20 minutes or so. We always roll together, make same spacing and eat at the same time. So there is no difference except body and brain.<br />What would that mean?

				Can&#039;t stand alcohol butting into a perfect roll.&nbsp; <br /><br />But yeah I always usually dose 150-160mg and a 60mg booster about an hour in.&nbsp; Keeps me rolling for ~4-5 hours solid.&nbsp; Lately I&#039;m feeling like maybe my dose is too low, I feel great on MDMA just not really getting the intense rolls my friends get, and my tolerance definitely isn&#039;t that shot, I&#039;m sure.

				I boost MDMA whenever I use.<br />\<br />I rarely do this with any other drugs. However my mother often boost (at the 2 hour mark) when she takes 2c-i
