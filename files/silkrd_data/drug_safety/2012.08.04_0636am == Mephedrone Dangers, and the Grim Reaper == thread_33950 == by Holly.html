				It is no question mephedrone is cardiotoxic, can anyone shed some light on the general consensus on the dangersgeneral of mephedrone?&nbsp; I read a lot of reports on things such as blue knees and limbs,&nbsp; vasoconstriction , things of that nature &amp; even people saying just by looking at the chemical structure to stay away from it

				I was a huge fan of mephedrone like 2 years ago, and after consuming ~2 grams in one night i had worst comedown in my life. I felt very ill, my heart hurt, extreme chest tightness. Can&#039;t say if i had blue knees - all i could was lying on the bed and wishing to die right now. But from reputable sources i heard that blue knees and limbs problem really presents. But it was caused by high dosage, after ~500 mg a day i felt perfectly fine, with some bad mood comedown for few hours. On the other hand its extremely hard to not redose every ~hour, it&#039;s most euphoric recreational drug i used, and its very more-ish. I will remember this euphoria till the end of my life.

				It is a pretty cardiotoxic drug and it can cause massive bouts of depression. You are best off taking it once every 2 weeks or less. And redosing every hour is pretty mild, more like 15-30 mins. It&#039;s about on a par with Cocaine in dangerous levels.

				Would you say there is a honeymoon period with the drug, as without having a comedown or withdrawal effects?

It&#039;s a bit like MDMA in that respect, you can loose the magic on it which is why I&#039;m having a break for a spell.

				There will always be comedows - but even with substantial amounts like 500-700mg (recommended starting dosage via insufflation is ~150mg) it&#039;s not a big deal, short and nothing compared to speed or metamphetamine. Buying something like 5g to use with friends shouldn&#039;t be harmful, from my experience. Remember, everyone have different bodies and health state, and i can&#039;t guarantee it would be safe. But if i&#039;d be you, i wouldn&#039;t be worried at all. I advice you to complete a research on major recreational drugs forums like D-F or bluelight.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know about honeymoon period like MDMA, but i had pretty good effect if not seriously binge. 500 in 2 doses today, same 500 mg tomorrow - effect and euphoria still would be strong - at least in my case. But to be on a safe side there should be pauses. If you can resist temptation - which is pretty damn hard.

				It&#039;s the binging and regular binge shit that kicks your doors down with it, not once-in-a-blue-mood use.
