				Ok so I got some good DMT from MU and have been dabbling in it. Before everyone tells me to get a oil burner pipe, I already ordered one so don&#039;t mention it. I have always just used the &quot;sandwich&quot; method by putting some of it between some bud in a pipe and trying to avoid direct contact with the flame. This method has always given me an amazing body high paired with a really relaxed state and very mild visuals, kind of like clouds are slightly morphing but not really. After getting on here I realized I have been smoking very small amounts probably 10 mg tops. So I decided to try some more and decided I would use the bong since I could take it in one or two big rips rather than 7 off a pipe. So I thought I&#039;d weigh out a bunch more, I got up to about 20 mg and thought it looked like a lot compared to usual so I would do that. Made the sandwich in the bowl of the bong and cashed it in pretty much one big hit. I felt like my brain was going to explode! I didn&#039;t have any amazing visuals, until after the initial 3 minute blast, and even then it wasn&#039;t like everyone has made it sound to me. I didn&#039;t see tons of geometric patterns and whatnot. All I know is that for the first 3 minutes I was in a state of.....idk I was just fucking out there like literally felt like my head was a rocket blasting off, I couldn&#039;t harness or focus on a single stimuli. It was like the whole world entered my brain in a couple minutes and then when I came to and could stand up I had acquired a MOUTHFUL of spit because I guess my jaw was clenched the whole time and for some reason I was salivating hardcore. <br /><br />So what I am asking is was this because I smoked it out of a bong? Do I have a lower tolerance? Was this actually nndmt or could it have been 5meo? I am really just looking for some feedback. I won&#039;t fully judge til I get my oil pipe but I really wanna break this wall everyone is talking about but man whatever I just went through was a crazy headfuck, not saying i don&#039;t wanna do it again but MAN!

				The problem is you&#039;re smoking too little. Generally a threshold vaporized dose is about 20mg, so double that for your threshold dose when you smoke it. I tried using the machine, but I didn&#039;t like it, so I just use the sandwich method like you do and it works fine. I generally dose with anywhere from 100-200mg at a time to achieve a breakthrough. MU&#039;s DMT doesn&#039;t give me geometrical patterns or fractals, but it always takes me to the dome with the reconstructing elves. I&#039;ve yet to understand what they&#039;re saying. And when you&#039;re smoking it, I find that if you take 2 huge hits, and try for a 3rd, you&#039;ll get a breakthrough everytime.<br /><br />From what you said you feel when you dose, it sounds to me like you haven&#039;t even come close to a breakthrough. Keep trying until you do because you&#039;ll remember that first one for the rest of your life.

				Try smoking 60mg, because 20mg will never even come close to breaking through. ;)

It will be harsh as fuck, so you stop when your lungs are at 70% and fill the rest with air. <br /><br />Good Luck Have Fun,<br />Elvenkonge<br />

				The best way to smoke DMT (in my opinion) is with a DMT machine. It&#039;s a home-made vaporizer. It works amazingly well and you get monster hits every time without tasting burnt plastic or hacking.&nbsp; There&#039;s a tek on my onion site with pics (http://426bznbgjzwd2nhp.onion/machine.html). Its super easy. Hope this helps.<br /><br />Oh and DMT in it&#039;s salt form is water soluble. Freebase DMT isn&#039;t - so you can use a bong. We smoke Changa out of a bong all the time and it&#039;s the method I recommend to all my people.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DiMiTri<br /><br />

				if u need 60-100+ mg for a breakthrough, then you&#039;re doin&#039; it wrong... make things simple for yourself and just get a sherlock model GVG in addition with a copper scrubber.

				I&#039;m not going to lie.... after this last dose of around 20 mg I am a little scared to do anything close to double that. I am a very experienced psychonaut and I never take MASSIVE doses but I have done every kind of psychadelic a few times and have never had a bad trip but the first 5 minutes or so of this blast off wasn&#039;t just a mind fuck it actually kind of hurt me. It made my brain stress to an extreme and made my jaw clench and my stomach hurt. If I am a pussy just let me know. Is it one of those drugs that its all or nothing? Trying to think of another drug im relating to but coming up blank, you know what I mean though. A minimal dose only produces the negative side effects and if you do it all then you get the good feelings too? <br /><br />I enjoyed 80% of it, it&#039;s just that blast off part that literally felt like my brain/body couldn&#039;t take it.

				It usually makes me relax hardcore almost like I got an IV of morphine going or something but those first few minutes felt like my brain was twisting or something. I will give it another go in a week or so. Thanks for your help everyone

When I get that strange tightness in my chest after hitting the DMT, that usually means I just need one more big hit to breakthrough. Once it happens, it&#039;s an completely different realm of &quot;what the fuck&quot;. So much so, that you don&#039;t really feel the effects of the DMT. You just feel like you are in your real place if you know what I mean.

				I&#039;ve tried every method of vaping short of buying the genie...<br />finally built a pipe that works 10X then all the other methods I&#039;ve tried including the machine.<br />I built a small pipe from air hose fittings, the kind used to connect air hoses to nail guns<br />get a male and female fitting( 3/8&quot; works fine) , attach to each other, put plenty of screens in smoking end. melt spice onto screen<br />then use virtually the same as machine. regular bic lighter worked for me.<br /><br />if unsure just go to Lowes or Home Depot and look through the air hose fittings and use your imagination
