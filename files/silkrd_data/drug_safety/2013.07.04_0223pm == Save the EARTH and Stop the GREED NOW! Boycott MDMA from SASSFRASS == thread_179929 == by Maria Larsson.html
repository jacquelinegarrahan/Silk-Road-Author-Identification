				TIME TO STOP THIS MADNESS NOW!<br /><br />http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/ecstasy-mdma-threatens-rare-cambodian-tree.html<br /><br />http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rjdoming/<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POKazFc_578<br /><br />...And lot&#039;s more on google.<br /><br />But it does not seem like we need to stop the MDMA to stop the madness. I believe there are some other ways to synthesize it which does not require starving people killing 100yr old trees in the rainforest and fucking it up in their search of new trees &amp; forest labs.<br /><br />Or people could just start playing with bk-MDMA instead?<br /><br />What do you think dear community?<br /><br />

				Well kind of ruined my happy memories of mdma sessions with this fact aswell. but doing mdma, pesticides, cosmetics or whatever which is killing the rainforest &amp; biodiversity in those places are just plain wrong.<br /><br />Is there any way we could steer this ship towards a fair trade market where we at least try to buy from good sources who does not fuck up the world with their profits? I love the description of atlas2012 fairtrade hash, but afaik they could be pedophiles using child slaves for work and profit for terror... but hope is what all on board have so what can we do with it?<br /><br />Would just love to hear the captains view on this point, but I understand he have 1000 other things to tend to so this might be up to us, the crew?

				I think majority of MDMA is made from PMK oil these days.&nbsp; Yes some labs still use sassafras but it is much less common.

				Thanks for your reply!<br />Are there any theories about where coke/mdma profits end up? is it as likely they are going to the poison industry as to guerilla leaders supporting euqality in third world countries?<br />What we know for sure is most banks use the cash for oil/war industry, are drugs as bad?

				Well we know that cocaine funds cartels, government, criminal organizations and gangs.&nbsp; We also know MDMA funds criminal organizations and gangs.&nbsp; There is a lot of violence in the world due to the illegal drug industry.&nbsp; I would say it is bad.&nbsp; Not as bad as the military and weapon industry.&nbsp; That is just death dealing....&nbsp; The weapons industry is one of the most profitable industries in the world.

Only if the PMK was synthesized from piperine would you have successfully not used sassafras to make PMK. And there&#039;s no way to determine (unless you know the person who made it) whether or not a given amount of PMK oil was made from sass or pepper. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think you understand how this works, though. Anyone with any brains (it has nothing to do with the environment), will take a moderate amount of root bark from the tree so as to keep it alive. They want the trees to produce more bark. No intelligent individual would do a one and done approach. Also, there are so many of these trees it is ridiculous (at least in the USA). The first tea produced in the US was from sassafras. It is everywhere. No one is endangering sassafras, its oil, or its root bark by partaking of its wonderful produce. Please do not spread false info. Either way, you or I will not stop sassafras being used as a source for drug production, unless we come up with new methods that can be derived from different sources (and there are; they just take a lot more time, money, and work).
