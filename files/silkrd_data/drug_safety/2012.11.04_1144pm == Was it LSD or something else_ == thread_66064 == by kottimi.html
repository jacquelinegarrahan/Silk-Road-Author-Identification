			<dd class="postbody">
				So about 4 months ago I got a batch of 10 tabs of what I was sold to me as LSD (not on SR, through a friend&nbsp; of a friend). It was my first time taking it, so even though I did my research on what to expect, I still wasn&#039;t sure exactly how I would react. Of course, I took it slow and started off with just 1 tab, and so did my boyfriend. My vision got colorful and sparkly, popcorn ceiling breathing, introspective feeling, etc... however! I suffered from pretty terrible nausea that persisted throughout the entire trip! If I found something to focus on like painting or in depth discussion, I wouldn&#039;t notice it much and I didn&#039;t feel like I had to run to the bathroom and try to vomit; if I was idle or unfocused, though, I&#039;d feel pretty bad.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been able to find any reports of people reacting this way to LSD; most report that the nausea is only on comeup and then it goes away for the duration. Do you think this was actually LSD or some kind of NBOMe or what? Maybe I&#039;m just really sensitive to LSD? I&#039;ve tripped a couple more times and have since used up the initial batch except for a half hit (each time with the same result). I have a new batch from a different source which I haven&#039;t tried out yet. I just want to get opinions on whether or not this is something I can expect to experience whenever I drop or if anyone thinks I might have been given something different.

				you are correct, it sounds like body load associated more with psychedelics such as nbome than i have experienced with lsd<br /><br />but thats not to say someone couldnt feel nausea on lsd, just not as common ime

				the psychedelic amphetamines are generally fairly easy to know you were on because of the extended duration, acid only last 6-12 for full effects to subside from a normal dose, while DOX last for much longer, at least 12 + to 18 hrs<br /><br />nbome can definitely give body load including nausea and is often passed off as lsd so that makes the most sense<br /><br />it would be pertinent to ask if anyone else here gets nausea from confirmed, absolutely known to be, lsd ?

				Like you&#039;ve read in the reports, the nausea is there during the come-up, but it should be completely gone for the rest of trip.<br />If you&#039;re experiencing a lot of nausea, which happens to me and it&#039;s something I&#039;m very sensitive too, then I think there&#039;s 2 possibilities.<br />One is that it isn&#039;t LSD, maybe nbome, and the other is that it&#039;s low quality LSD. <br />When I trip on acid that&#039;s lower purity, I always get bad nausea, which is why I avoid this kind of acid.<br />Same with RC&#039;s.<br />When I have high purity acid there&#039;s no nausea for the whole trip, and if it&#039;s really clean, then even during the come-up the nausea is minimal. <br />There have been a few times where I swore I didn&#039;t have any nausea at any point at all, not even the come-up.<br />I remember a few trips of good WoW where I took the tabs, laid down in bed, and felt the slightest, barely noticeable light-headedness that came and went for about 30 minutes, then boom. I was in LSD consciousness and it was pure and beautiful. 12 hours. :)<br />

				MicroRNA this post comes from the heart, i believe it truly and it is not spam, we just have differing opinions. Please understand this, and do not censor me<br /><br />Body lody is something i have wondered about alot, and it is amanifestation of the mind. I used to puke until two trips ago every time i did acid. It is because your worst fears come true and they manifest in the following way - puking, burping, shitting, pissing, yawning. All are outlets of bad energy. If you believe me understand my story and accept that i am god, whatever it takes

				no - it most definitely is not psychosomatic<br /><br />for example mescaline - it has a strong nausea component to it, not because people think it will, but because it actually makes you feel nauseous because of an interaction with the chemo-receptor that tells your body you ingested something potentially dangerous and thus to vomit<br /><br />in addition, other psychedelics cause body load because of their effect on serotonin receptors - the majority of which reside in the enteric nervous system (the gut) rather than the central nervous system, not because people just think they are going to get sick. most people have no idea or worry it will make them sick until after it does

Did you trip start to subside after about 6-8 hours? and also how long did it take for you to come up? cause by knowing the answer to these questions It&#039;ll be way much easier to weed out the options and come close to pin pointing what you&#039;ve had (Whether it was a 2c-x, 25x-NBOMe, or DOx)

Usually the trip will begin to wane a bit around the 8-ish hour mark, but I&#039;ll still have visuals like patterns and breathing. Except for the time we candy flipped, we can usually get to sleep around the 10 hour mark with a beer and some effort.<br /><br />The nausea isn&#039;t even really a factor for me when coming up if I recall correctly, though that might be because I use the onset of the trip as sexy time; it&#039;s entirely possible that having sex is a distraction from any nausea. Some other effects I&#039;ve noticed are that around the 4-5 hour point, both of us start to notice that our backs are hurting. The best way I&#039;d describe it is as if my spine was being compressed; I just feel tightness in my back muscles. Slight paranoia, not freaked-out-and-losing-it level, but I&#039;ll have small auditory hallucinations like my bedroom door opening or something, and when I turn around kinda startled, obviously no one opened the door and I just imagined it. One other thing I&#039;ve felt is a slightly uncomfortable sudden short buzzy &quot;vibration&quot; feeling through my whole body that will occur at random intervals. To me it feels like I&#039;ve become one of those sonic care toothbrushes for a second or two, hahahah.<br /><br />Does this help at all?

				I dont think i or anyone can really say what your nausia was about. Could have been almost anything. I have droped lots of hits L and a hand full of nBOMES. i also get nasious on occasion that seems to pursist, particularly if i let it get to me. One thing i can say for sure is that the RCs have terribly strong metalic like tastes. like almost unbearably so. and a common side effect is that same disgusting taste coming back on you and totaly canceling out anything that passes your mouth . somtimes a burning/ tingling of the tounge , almost as if you drank somthing very hot and scolded your tounge. hope i helped shed some light.

				I&#039;ve had nausea like this from known LSD. When it&#039;s happened I&#039;ve been pretty sleep deprived when I took it, I tend to find a healthy sleep beforehand makes for a better trip! My stomach isn&#039;t exactly the strongest either.
