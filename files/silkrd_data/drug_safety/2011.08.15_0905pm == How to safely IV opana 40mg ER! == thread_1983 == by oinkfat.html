				I just posted this in chronicpain&#039;s thread so I figured I&#039;d put it where it belongs.<br /><br />First you get the WHOLE momma (that&#039;s what they&#039;re called where I&#039;m from&nbsp; Just bare with it for this TEK) and a shot glass.&nbsp; Noticed I said WHOLE momma?&nbsp; Even if there&#039;s a chip in the momma this will not work.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you know why.&nbsp; Disinfect the f*cking glass!&nbsp; Now go get DISTILLED water.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or at the very least boil some COLD tap water for 3:30 minutes.&nbsp; COLD Tap water (at least in the states) has less bacteria than bottled water, believe it or not.&nbsp; HOT tap water has more... much more.<br /><br />Okay if you&#039;re using 1 momma, place it in the shot glass and put about 4 cc&#039;s of water into the shotglass.&nbsp; Simply let the momma sit for 24 hours (i know, sucks, but soooo worth it).&nbsp; Make sure during this time water remains in the glass.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want ALL water to evaporate, you want at least 3 cc&#039;s to remain.<br /><br />After 24 hours simply pour the water onto a large spoon, add STERILE (boiled) cotton to the solution.&nbsp; Draw about about 90 ml or so and boot off.&nbsp; You should feel a very strong rush, much stronger than oxy.&nbsp; Rush should feel similar to dilaudid but the high that of opana (duh).<br /><br />If you want to expedite the process, put 2 in with 7 cc&#039;s water.&nbsp; It&#039;ll take about 12 hours.&nbsp; Even faster?&nbsp; Put 3 mommas in water, you&#039;ll be able to get high off the solution within 7-8 hours.&nbsp; But you should really always wait the 24 hours or you&#039;ll think &quot;pfft this sucks!&quot;.&nbsp; I promise, it&#039;s worth the wait.<br /><br />Okay, just replace momma-&gt;Opana and you guys now can IV those opana ER 40&#039;s with easy.&nbsp; But remember BE STERILE.&nbsp; My friend did this method 3 times in a row (over 3 day period) without ever washing the glass.&nbsp; He placed a cotton directly in the shotglass the first time he did it.&nbsp; After not washing the glass this allowed that certain &quot;cotton fever&quot; bacteria to grow on the glass due to his negligence.&nbsp; When he did this he got cotton fever THREE times in a day because he didn&#039;t realize (until the third time) that it was his ER IV solution, not the cotton!&nbsp; If he had simply been sterile like he always is, he&#039;d been fine.&nbsp; STERILE!!!!<br /><br />The way this works is the oxymorphone is highly dissolvable in water.&nbsp; So placing a full Opana in water keeps it from gelling, but that oxymorphone REALLY wants to get in that water.&nbsp; So the outerlayer / skin / seal of the opana act&#039;s like the postal service between the timerX and water, and it delivers pure oxymorphone.&nbsp; Best part of this?&nbsp; This no binder that will clog your body up!&nbsp; The opana after 24 hours will be all swollen and gooey.&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; You can re-use it for a second, less powerful batch!.

				In my thread I stated that a friend took an opana and put it in the barrel of a syringe (with water) then waited 24 hours and then shot it. He said it worked great. But, putting all those fillers into your system cant be good. The problem is patience. If you want a &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;quicker&quot; fix, then iso extraction is for that. But, im sure if you let it sit overnight in water and then filtered to get rid of the nasty fillers, you might be ok. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad Im not into Iv&#039;ing so for me its not an issue. I think that snorting one with a high fat meal is best..

				As long as it&#039;s a whole opana, not crushed or scratched, there will be no filler in the liquid.&nbsp; And the opana will be swollen and gooey.<br /><br />And 40 mg opana IV can last someone with low tolerance (Don&#039;t know why they&#039;d have low tolerance and IV) for a week.

				Uhhh there&#039;s a 15 minute prep on shooting opana 40mgs ER&#039;s, that I know.<br />I can&#039;t elaborate on it at this moment but will go into deep depth with it in the morning.<br />I&#039;m much too busy today.<br />It involves using 90% ISO alcohol and evape of the alcohol...if you are too impatient to wait google search IV opana ER and read the link from opioiphile.com<br /><br />Like I said tomorrow I will post the exact directions.

				I have done the iso extraction more than 10 times.&nbsp; It&#039;s quick but not NEARLY as potent as the water method.&nbsp; As in 1 opana 40 with iso will get my friend high for the night.&nbsp; The water method 1 opana 40 will last him two days.

				I think&nbsp; your right, oinkfat. But, not everyone can wait 24 hours, lol... That&#039;s the main issue. When I put that pill in the syringe, it was weird, like the pill expanded. Whatever happened, the&nbsp; guy loved it.

				This is the Technigue I have used many times...true it&#039;s not as potent but you don&#039;t have to wait 24 hours. :P<br /><br />How To Inject Opana ER Intravenously (Mau5-Tek)<br /><br />The following method is how to inject Opana ER (Oxymorphone HCl Extended Release) tablets and beat the patent TIMERx system. <br /><br />For those who don&#039;t know, Opana ER utilizes a harm-reduction gel matrix known as TIMERx. Upon contact with moisture - the pill will gel up and achieve a consistency of snot which renders the pill useless except for a disappointing gulp of of some nasty mess that will remind you of the most gooey disgusting loogie. <br /><br />This of course is a huge dilemma as oxymorphone provides a beautiful rush and has the legs of an ostrich. The constant war between IV drug users and TIMERx has been a brutal one resulting in a huge loss of quality pharmaceutical opiate goodness and a sad frown of failure on the faces of junkie soliders across our great nation.<br /><br />If any of you have seen the amazing movie, Drugstore Cowboy, starring Matt Dillon and a well appreciated appearance by beat literature master and opiate savant, William S. Burroughs. You will notice Matt Dillon&#039;s character&#039;s affection for a pharmaceutical referred to as &quot;blues&quot;. In this day and age, blues are a commonplace term to refer to those sexy Roxicodone 30mg (Oxycodone HCl) but back then they were the Endo Numorphan tablets which were immediate release formulations of oxymorphone HCl.<br /><br />Enough of the background and history lesson and on to the technique that will allow you to introduce your precious veins to the glorious substance that is oxymorphone.<br /><br />Materials Needed:<br /><br />(1) Opana ER tablet (5mg, 7.5mg, 15mg, 20mg, 30mg, 40mg)<br />(2) Insulin Syringes (1cc)<br />(1) Cotton Ball<br />(1) Large Metal Spoon (I used a soup ladle)<br />(1) Shot Glass<br />Electric Heat Source (An electric stove or a clothing iron is suitable)<br />91% Isopropyl Alcohol<br />Water (Distilled if available)<br />Hose Clamp<br /><br />Technique:<br /><br />1. Take your pill and remove the coating. I suggest using a nail file to do so and not use a wet paper towel like you would on an Oxycontin pill because remember that TIMERx? It will gel up upon contact with moisture. <br /><br />2. Decide upon your dose. Please bear in mind that oxymorphone is a very potent narcotic. Injectable solutions come in formulations of 1mg/mL. I had a 40mg ER tablet and I used a little less than a quarter of it. Remember that it is almost inevitable to lose some product in the process so I used a ~10mg chunk and probably yielded ~5mg - 8mg. This is a large dose even for an opioid tolerant individual. <br /><br />3. Grind up your chunk using a hose clamp into a fine and fluffy powder and add it to your shot glass.<br /><br />4. Place roughly 1 tablespoon of 91% Isopropyl alcohol into the shot glass and stir it. Allow this mixture to sit for a couple of minutes - stirring occasionally.<br /><br />5. Take a large cotton and drop it into the solution and filter it out with a syringe. You may use an infant oral syringe (like the ones preferred for plugging) or a 3cc syringe to suck up more liquid. I unfortunately only had a 1cc insulin syringe so I used that to draw up the oxymorphone/alcohol solution.<br /><br />6. Squirt the extracted solution into your metal spoon - it should be free of any visible materials at this point (a speck or two won&#039;t hurt).<br /><br />7. Place the spoon onto your electric heat source. I used an electric clothing iron and simply placed the spoon on the flipped over iron as it was on the highest setting. <br /><br />8. Allow the solution to simmer and evaporate. You can speed up the process by blowing on the alcohol as it simmers. The solution should not be at a rolling boil. Just a consistent simmer and try to breathe in the evaporated fumes as it can give you quite a headache.<br /><br />9. When the alcohol has been completely evaporated, you will be left with a yellowish residue at the bottom of the spoon. This is your extracted oxymorphone. Fill up your syringe with as much (hot) water as possible (preferably 1cc) and squirt it into the spoon and mix it quickly and drop a medium sized cotton in quickly to absorb the liquid. You will see a portion of the product gel up. You can eat the remaining gel or wash it again for a second shot although I don&#039;t really now how effective it will be.<br /><br />10. Inject your oxymorphone solution, sit back and pop in Drugstore Cowboy and feel the connection between yourself and Bob (Matt Dillon&#039;s character in the movie).<br /><br />

				just tried this for first time (iso extract). it kinda sucks. does anyone get a good percentage of opana out of it? i shot over quarter of a 40 and no rush at all and not very fucked up. i can shoot a quarter of a ir 10mg and feel real good but these er&#039;s seem to suck. how long do you guys let the pill soak in alcohol and then how long do you let the film sit in water? i&#039;m very disapoint. i thought the er 40&#039;s would be great value but now i&#039;m thinking not. any other tips let me hear them.

You add warm to hot water sterilized in&nbsp; the microwave and you but 1cc into the dried residue and stir really fast to intergrate the film into your sterile water and you drop a dry cotton filter into the spoon as quickly as possible and the water with the oxymorph in it is absorbedinstantly and you filter it through the absorbed water in it. This should all take place in 30 seconds...the film or whitish stuff in the water after you let water sit in the water is the time release gel. You want to absorb the oxymorphone ASAP before the gel starts forming...this is the reason your &quot;return&quot; is not up to par you let the water activate the little bit of gel left after the after the ISO extraction.<br /><br />I have done this 5 times this week and have in the past, the technique works, until their is human error.<br />Try this again and see if you aren&#039;t swayed by this post.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				@oinkfat<br />Quick question about the shot glass method.&nbsp; How much Opana (oxymorphone) is going to end up in the syringe?&nbsp; You say draw off 90ml (I assume you mean 90units in a 1cc syringe).<br /><br />If there are 3cc&#039;s of water left and all 40mg went into the water the 90u should have about 14mg in it.<br /><br />What type of tolerance would you have to have without that 14mg making you puke.<br /><br />Just trying to determine the safest amount for someone trying Opana for the first time (having tried everything else, including H and methadone).&nbsp; Can go through 100 20mg Oxy IR&#039;s in a week or less. <br /><br />

				i really dont like the opana er&#039;s. they just dont feel right to me. hard to explain but they just seem to suck. i dont think i&#039;ll be getting anymore. i will try the ir&#039;s again and see if they are better. i&#039;m thinking about just going back to dilaudid. to me the rush is just the best. i wonder what a mixed shot of say 2mg dilaudid and 2 mg opana would be like. is it safe to mix them like that? strangely i&#039;ve never heard of doing something like that. when i had the ir&#039;s 1 pill would last me a whole day and i would be nodding out nearly all day. considering how long the 40 has lasted i would say i&#039;m at most getting 50% from the pill. maybe i should have tried 91% alcohol but i already had 99% so i used that. i have seen most people seem to use 91%

				Sorry for my delayed response!<br /><br />@lvlbrained- I agree with you, I think the ISO method sucks balls, never did shit for me.&nbsp; Try my shot-glass method and I gurantee your attitude will change, but you gotta be a big boy and actually wait 24 hours.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think you can wait 24 hours?&nbsp; Then you shouldn&#039;t do my shotglass method because you&#039;ll be dead.&nbsp; Told a kid about this method, he used 4 opana ERs in 1 glass with 12 cc&#039;s water, and forgot about it (probably passed out from benzos).&nbsp; 20 hours later he remembered it, got a huge-ass syringe and baned 5 cc&#039;s of water.&nbsp; He turned purple, I had to inject him with suboxone to save his ass. He had some awful PWDs lol!<br /><br /><br />@captainjojo- I had a 300mg oxycodone IV habbit.&nbsp; Using my method with 2 Opana ER&#039;s sitting in ~9ccs water for like 14 hours.&nbsp; 90ml felt amazing and got me out of withdrawal.&nbsp; It felt so good I did another 90 ml.&nbsp; After the second 90 ml I passed out for 10 hours which NEVER EVER happens.&nbsp; EVER<br />So if you have a strong tolerance, use my shotglass method with 3 or 4 cc&#039;s of water and let it sit for 24 hours.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t do more than 90ml&#039;s within 5 hours of each other, even with a huge tolerance.&nbsp; If you do one of two things will happen, you&#039;ll pass out for a long time and waste the high, or you&#039;ll puke your ass off and get sick from doing far more than you can handle.<br /><br />BE SAFE WITH THE SHOTGLASS METHOD.&nbsp; If done properly with 1, there&#039;s absolutely no reason to do more than 2 cc&#039;s of it in a day.&nbsp; And that&#039;s with a huge tolerance.&nbsp; If you have little or no tolerance DO NOT USE THIS METHOD.&nbsp; You can very easily over-dose and the last thing I need is someone&#039;s death resting on my shoulders, even if it&#039;s some random idiot on the internet. (not calling you an idiot captainjojo, I know your smart).<br /><br />Sorry for how long it took to respond I had to move over 3000 miles driving!!!&nbsp; Im here to stay so ask away!
