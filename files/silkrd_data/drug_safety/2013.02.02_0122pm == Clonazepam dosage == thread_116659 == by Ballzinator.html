				I have a bunch of 2mg clonazepam bars with four 0.5mg segments (like Xanax bars). I have no tolerance to benzos or alcohol. The only other benzos I&#039;ve tried are tetrazepam at 50mg and Lorazepam at 2mg. What dose of clonazepam should I take to get a feel for the drug?

				Benzos are kind of hard to make a call on, for me anyways. What do you define as getting a feel for a drug and what do you want to use it for? If you want to use it therapeutically, I&#039;d start with just .5mg and let yourself go about as normal and see if you can notice the effects. <br /><br />If you want to use it in a more abusive fashion, and if you are pretty confident that you have no tolerance, then I would start with 1mg dissolved in your mouth before swallowing. Give that about 45 minutes and walk around your place a bit (if you are experimenting with benzos I strongly recommend not going anywhere because they can easily ruin your ability to drive/get around) and see if you are feeling physically disoriented (this is indicative of a HIGH dosage of benzos in your system and you should not take anymore unless you are willing to face the consequences of increased tolerance and being extremely fucked up).&nbsp; <br /><br />If you feel you are not where you want to be at 1mg by t: 1:00 I&#039;d pop another .5mg. You could take 2mg at once and definitely feel the effects but you probably wouldn&#039;t be able to do much besides lay around. <br /><br />When I first started 1mg was a solid dose to get into a recreational level of relaxation. It&#039;s tempting but I wouldn&#039;t go further than that (and avoid alcohol). <br /><br />Be careful as I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve read how dangerous benzos can be and it&#039;s all true. Also, you said you have a bunch but unless you want them all to disappear try to taper your use to at least once every three days. Xanax has a relatively short half-life but it will still hang around your system and fuck with your tolerance.<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Thank you very much for the information<br /><br />I took a quarter bar like 20 minutes ago and I can feel first effects. It&#039;s definitely more on the muscle relaxing side. I&#039;m taking another quarter because 1mg clonazepam = 20mg Valium = 2mg lorazepam, a dose that I have taken and liked before.

				Well, its a fair question since numerous people do exactly that.<br /><br />The combination of benzo&#039;s and alcohol certainly has its risks - respiratory depression being one of the mjaor ones.<br /><br />On the other hand plenty of have a few drinks and a mg of xanax&nbsp; or clonazepam as a nightcap. <br /><br />Ii will surely help you sleep, and probably cause some memory loss. Beyond that it is very hard to say what amount will result in a dangerous situation. It all depends on tolerance, individual differences and a fair amount of luck. <br />

				Ben has it right. While I would NOT recommend it, as it is is a slippery slope and you can easily fuck yourself over but, admittedly, I have combined benzos and alcohol and it can be a relaxing evening and it can help you got to sleep but it can also black you out. Be careful and start slow and build your way up or it will catch up to you.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Snoopish

				crazy man, i never even heard of clonazepam bars.&nbsp; i&#039;ve been on 2mg per day for over 8 years now for chronic anxiety disorder.&nbsp; When I first started taking them, I would wait until then end of the day, after work, and take 1mg and just melt into the couch for a few hours.&nbsp; I remember one time, I took 2mg and melted into the floor all night... Crazy low tolerance.&nbsp; Now I am to the point where I can go days without any benzos, feel just fine, and take like 0.5mg - 2mg clonazepam if needed to control my panic attacks.&nbsp; When I take it now, it definitely relaxes me a bit but mostly just makes me feel normal.&nbsp; I recently obtained some 2mg xanax bars and man, those things are FUN!&nbsp; I definitely recommend against starting on benzos but mine legitimately helped me get through crippling panic attacks.&nbsp; I just let it get the best of me, and I have to have some every few days or i feel really &quot;weird&quot;.

				nmac makes a good point. In general, if looking into any benzo please look into the half life for that particular one and remember it takes about 3 half-lifes to get the majority of a drug out of your system. If the half-life is 48 hours that means you will still have a noticeable amount of that benzo running through your system for 6 days after taking it.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				If you wanna Make a benzo hit u harder or as u said make it more intense the best is to drink fruit juice...I forgot which kind ,we hd a convo thread about this the other day, but look it up its very true..<br /><br />Devolving it under your tongue only works faster, there r 2 veins under your tounge, the meds gets into your bloodstream faster.. Many think the Banana kins are stronger but there not, they are just not ment to be swallowed but chewed or sit under your tong causing it to kick in faster.&nbsp; Not to mention they taste great..But iv ever had a Klonopin taste bad, their eaither minty or sweet tasting, Non r bitter like XANAX...<br /><br />Also about the seizures is very true..Iv been on benzos a few diffrent types prescribed for almost 10 years and there have been many times i would take too many f my scrip before i started buying off the net and i would be very depressed and also had to go to the hospital a few times, and tell them a lie and say i washed them in my pants when i was doing clothes...They would give me 20 of some low benzo but it was better than nothing,,, I dont like valium much but they for sure work,just not as strong as the others i mention...

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any question that clonazepam (as well as other benzos) are able to be absorbed sublingually<br /><br />I also agree that the onset via this ROA seems a bit quicker<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say the effects are any stronger than the oral ROA, but I don&#039;t have hard numbers in front of me, this is anecdotal

				Alprazolam is definitely bitter tasting, but for me it&#039;s not so bitter I can&#039;t let it dissolve in my mouth.&nbsp; But different people have different tolerances to bitterness.

				Since you guys mentioned that alprazolam is bitter and some clonazepam pills are minty, I think AnonymousAddict was wrong and my clonazepam bars really were clonazepam because they weren&#039;t the slightest bit bitter and a little bit minty.

				The absolute, 100% accurate, foolproof way to ID a pill is to call Poison Control from a burner cell.&nbsp; Claim to be a law enforcement officer and tell the responder that you have seized some pills and need help identifying them.&nbsp; Nine times out of ten they won&#039;t even ask you your name, and if they do ask, it will just be to be friendly.&nbsp; I know this because I was a cop for many years, and used this all the time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used it since with some pills I bought on the Road.<br /><br />Use a burner cell just in case the protocols are a little tighter in your state than they are in mine.

				I&#039;ve never heard of K-pins in a dosage that high.&nbsp; I kinda think it&#039;s a typo or something, since no doc in his right mind would write for 10 mg.&nbsp; Maybe he meant 1mg.<br /><br />And, maybe I&#039;m just a cranky fuck, but flavored drugs kinda lost their appeal about the same time I gave up Flintstones vitamins.<br /><br />Can you tell my shit still hasn&#039;t come in yet?

				There are two problems I would (&quot;would&quot;, because I&#039;ve never tried them) have with banana-flavored pills:<br />1.) I would somehow feel like the product wasn&#039;t intended for my age group but rather for seven- to twelve-year-olds. I mean, come on! Shouldn&#039;t we keep the worlds of candy and drugs separate? Except of course in the case of cannabis edibles and LSD-laced candy ;D<br />2.) I fucking hate bananas. I don&#039;t know why and I&#039;m the only person I&#039;ve ever heard of who doesn&#039;t like bananas. Which sucks because they&#039;re healthy as fuck.<br /><br />Sorry for this fucked-up post, I&#039;m on 4mg of Xanax plus two beers plus a liter of Afri-Cola (German brand of cola with 2.5x the amount of caffeine compared to Coca Cola :D) plus a 200mg caffeine pill so that&#039;s 450mg caffeine total.<br /><br />In hindsight this is suddenly starting to look like a bad idea :o<br />Oh well, I survived 9.6mg of 25i so my metabolism should handle this one alright, shouldn&#039;t it :D

				Well, I&#039;m no expert on Xanax, but I&#039;m about to be.&nbsp; Just ordered 50 pills from my favorite SR vendor, American Psycho (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6bd48492ef).&nbsp; While Natasha specializes in benzos, AP has a variety of pharmaceuticals.&nbsp; But, he&#039;s been just amazing with customer service and stealth and speed - really has earned all the positive feedback.&nbsp; He&#039;s had some RL health problems, which I can certainly identify with, that limited his listings for awhile.&nbsp; But, he&#039;s better now, and his page looks better than ever.&nbsp; Check him out, and if you order with him, tell him I sent you, would ya?<br /><br />sleepy<br />TorChat: qsy3fzzvw6ug6wbi

It&#039;s a very unpleasant bitter taste, though you may learn to associate that with its effects and care less about it. I&#039;ve found it to taste a bit like paracetamol, but with a really typical after taste that seems hard to get rid off. <br /><br />It is important to notice that there is absolutely no use in chewing on xanax. It is not absorbed in the mouth, the nain route is absorption in the small intestine. Just downing the tablets with some water will mare the effect kick in faster compared to chewing them down and dissolving them in your mouth. This may be different for the time-released xanax capsules on the market, but when it comes in the form on a ordinary tablet, just down the things, on an empty stomach if you want the fastest effect.
