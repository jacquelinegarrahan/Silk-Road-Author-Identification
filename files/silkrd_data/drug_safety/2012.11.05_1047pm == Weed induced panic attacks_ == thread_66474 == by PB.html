				Hey guys, I have a quick question regarding panic attacks induced by weed.<br /><br />The backstory: My girl and I had a bite of a strong hash cookie that my roommate cooked (read: trustworthy). We were sitting on the couch about 30 minutes later and I had forgotten all about the bites we took until my girl starts complaining that her heart feels like it&#039;s being crushed. I laugh it off as unimportant until she starts getting really serious about it - she jumps up off the couch and is pacing back and forth with eyes wider than I&#039;ve ever seen. She was having a panic attack that was brought on by the weed (I know this to be true because it had happened once before, when we took a hit from a gravity bong). I tried to remind her of this and that it was all in her head but she kept worrying with extreme intensity that she was going insane and was going to die. What&#039;s worse is that we had just finished tripping on shrooms for the first time and she was afraid that that had something to do with the attack. I explained to her that the trip wore off hours before and it was purely the weed doing this. Thank God we didn&#039;t eat those cookies before we trippedâ€¦<br /><br />Long story short, we did some breathing exercises and I rubbed her shoulders until she fell asleep, but the panic attack never actually subsided until the high wore off. Has anyone heard of weed induced panic attacks, either first or thirdhand? I told her we&#039;d never smoke again (not that we did much to begin with) because her body can&#039;t seem to handle it, but I wonder why it happens in the first place. She has never had a panic attack before in her life. The weird thing is we&#039;ve smoked maybe 6 times together and only twice has this happened.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

				Do you guys currently use any other substances heavily or have you in the past?<br /><br />I knew someone who used to use a variety of substances (I think most heavily cocaine), who began having panic attacks a few years after he stopped everything but smoking weed. It started out with very sparse attacks only when he smoked, then he eventually started having the attacks without the smoking. He went to a doctor (to whom he disclosed his drug history) who believed that the prior drug use played a part in the panic attacks.<br /><br />The attacks initially started due to his weed habit though. Not sure if this story is particularly helpful, but there&#039;s my related anecdote.

				The first time my girlfriend smoked she also had similar effects. Since then, she enjoys it very much. I also have a neighbor who used to smoke weed as well as other things, but now any time he smokes he has severe panic attacks. Not sure what causes that?

				THIS HAPPENED TO ME A FEW WEEKS AGO!<br />There were several factors that attributed to my panic attack, but something strangely weird is I think mushrooms were involved in mine as well. It was about 3 weeks ago I think, but one night I ate 1g of mushrooms, tripped out and stayed up all night smoking meth. I stayed up all day as well, and then the next night I decided I wanted to smoke some weed and have a nice, deep sleep. So I smoked a relatively small amount of marijuana and curled up in bed. I have a lava lamp that gives my room a pretty ambient glow, and as I laid in bed staring at the ceiling, suddenly the whole room started to look smaller and smaller. I blinked several times, trying to focus my vision, but nothing changed, the room continued to shrink around me and I began to fear that I would be crushed or that I would (for some reason) suffocate. I tried to calm myself down, but I was really scared, my heart was racing and I was afraid to move or close my eyes. Eventually I calmed down a bit and of course, my first instinct is to get on pidgin and find someone to talk to LOL. I came out of it and went to sleep soon after, but it was a pretty scary experience.

				i actually just stopped smoking weed basically completely because of panic attacks<br /><br />i was a daily smoker for years never went a day without smoking when i wasnt on vacation - then all of sudden i started having panic attacks, possibly from stress of other things in my life - and now i havent smoked for nearly two weeks even once<br /><br />weed was once enjoyable, relaxing and even relieved my anxiety, but it has now flipped to where i just become worked up and much more anxious, even to the point of panic attacks unfortunately <br /><br />one of my girl friends refused to smoke and the one time i convinced her to - she completely freaked out and had a panic attack as well<br /><br />i think sativas and very potent strains are particularly worse - lower doses and using indica strains can help reduce the anxiety at least slightly

				I have never experienced a true panic attack after smoking pot myself, though i&#039;ve found it to heighten anxiety on some occasions. <br /><br />That is fairly typical of cannabis though: It often intensifies a state of mind already present, making it a very nice drugs when you are relaxed, preferably hanging around in a hammock on a tropical island with not a care in the world. <br /><br />The flipside is that it will also do that on the negative: if you are already worried, stressed or anxious, smoking cannabis may make that experience worse. <br /><br />If you are worried about these effects, i would suggest against eating cannabis, and stick to smoking instead. Cannabis can be very effective when eaten, but there is little or no way back if you eat it. Even vomiting would probably not have much of an effect since its largely absorbed in the intestines, and vomiting does not remove any material that already passed the stomach. If you are eating spacecake (or coookies, brownies, etc) there is no way to stop it entering your system once it begins to take effect. When smoking the effect is much faster, and you can simply stop puffing the joint to prevent any adverse effects from getting worse.

				True that... i used to smoke and eat cannabis reguarly when i was in school too - pretty easy to obtain bsck then since i grew up in holland and noone cared about age limits and such back in&nbsp; the day.<br /><br />Nowadays i rarely use cannabis anymore, despite its easily available to me. Sometimes i smoke with friends that are having some, but i never buy any myself. I suppose all of the magic has been taken out of it due to common availability by now, and if i want a functional drug there are better options in most cases.

				PriscillaMarie ... sounds like tunnel vision as a symptom of panic attack.&nbsp; Scary shit, indeed.<br /><br />One of the sad consequences of prohibition (needing to cram more drug into less weight) and perhaps weed culture (needing stronger strains with a verifiable metric for the truly hardcore heads) is the way cannabis has been selectively bred to create plants with insanely high THC content.&nbsp; It appears that there is mutual exclusivity between CBDs -- which tend to be anxiolytic -- and THC.&nbsp; So, the price of being able to say that such-and-such a strain is 25% THC is the greater likelihood of people having freak-outs.<br /><br />Also, we&#039;ve noticed that weed-induced panic tends to be centered on even more irrational thoughts than freak-outs precipitated by other causes, including other drugs, though in the moment, this is pretty much irrelevant to the sufferer.&nbsp; Might be weird to say, but some in the ILF wish cannabis would have just stayed seeded-up.

				Maybe the government is dispersing chemical ingredients in the air to make people have bad reactions to cannabis. Of course man-made chemicals are my answer to everything bad.<br /><br />I kinda forgot all about the paranoia/nervousness/stress aspect of cannabis. It was pretty regular when I was a recreational user, all but gone now. There&#039;s a lot people dont understand about how cannabinoids work, we take commercial strain profiles for granted, sometimes I wonder if the affects of cannabis are remotely the same as they were in the beginning of time, because the purpose of its growth has changed from personal usefulness to profit based care. You read strain reviews and people give awful side affects as testimony to a products worth... <br /><br />&nbsp;It could be just too much for someone who doesnt use regularly. Cannabis is something that is supposed to be slowly introduced to ones self. I cant imagine being a non-user and hitting some amazing indo the first time, it might be a bit overwelming, depending on the cannabinoid profile...&nbsp; &nbsp;like gestaltassault2 said, THC is all about the seriousness, and the reason I stopped concentrates. THC isnt even the main contributor to what most people think of when they think of being stoned.

				In some people, it can trigger all kinds of awful things if you&#039;re a new, or even long-term heavy user. Don&#039;t listen to the &quot;weed is harmless&quot; crowd; it has all kidns of strange and wonderful (and terrible) effects on people, it should be respected as a drug. If you want to continue experimenting, please try much smaller amounts in longer intervals. Unless you don&#039;t smoke cigarettes, just a little bit in a rollie is more than enough for a first-timer/casual-ish user (obviously if you don&#039;t smoke tobacco AVOID AVOID AVOID, and use a bong or a pipe instead.

				I don&#039;t think &quot;weed is harmless&quot; is a generally accepted standpoint at all.<br /><br />The psychical risks may be very small, but the psychological risks of cannabis use are something to be reckoned with. <br /><br />When talking about the harm of drugs, physical harm and dependence are often mentioned. Those are important issues ofcourse, but in case of cannabis hardly the thing to worry about. <br /><br />Psychological risks are an entirely different concern. You will not get any brain damage for smoking some pot, nor will you suffer any problematic withdrawal symptoms if you stop doing so. This does by no means guarantee that your look on life will not change however. Cannabis will most certainly not turn your brain into pulp, but in some cases the effects can be about as bad on the long term.

Anyway, I find this generally interesting because I personally have an extensive history of stimulant use during my childhood (Ritalin, Adderall, etc) based upon an early diagnosis of &quot;ADHD&quot; and (later on) Bipolar Disorder. I do not directly endorse nor ascribe to the psychoemotional dynamics of clinical psychiatry or its correlating worldview. However, I do believe chemical imbalance is a primary causal factor in my own personal issues with severely debilitating anxiety. After a solid 6 years of heavy marijuana smoking (which began shortly after I stopped taking stimulants for ADHD from 6-14 years of age) I began to experience attacks seemingly out-of-nowhere. Introspection proved rather useful in dissecting and tracing the source of my thoughts, but I am certainly MUCH more paranoid and &quot;manic&quot; on psychedelics. I do not feel as if I need them to &quot;think outside the box&quot; (if you catch my drift&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />I have drawn conclusions based upon dedicated research of the subject matter:<br /><br />*Marijuana is a mild psychedelic. Psychedelics possess a secondary stimulant component, but it is widely known that one should NEVER combine them with additional stimulants because of the increased risk of psychosis and damaging dopamine-related effects<br /><br />*&quot;ADHD/Bipolar&quot; children are much more likely to have a history of stimulant/SSRI/Dopamine-modulating drug use and thus must be careful when experimenting with any entry-level psychedelic (including marijuana).<br /><br />These factors do not necessarily qualify an individual for a diagnosis of ADHD/Bipolar, but may indicate you possess a neurochemical imbalance predicated either congenitally, developmentally, somatically or based on a history of drug abuse (notably stimulants).<br /><br />This is just one constellation I have formed in the vastness of a stupefyingly complex multitude of interactions the human mind shares with drugs, which of course is deeply relative to each individual. No two brains are exactly the same!<br /><br />Ye be careful with psychedelics, mate!

				From what I&#039;ve read I understood that you&#039;re not a heavy smoker nor your gf. I think that eating shrooms and then smoking/eating weed/hash after so little time wasn&#039;t really a good idea. If you&#039;re not used to these kind of substances you have to do small steps in order to get used to their effect. When you&#039;ll be used to both shrooms and weed with a decent tolerance but mixing them while kinda first timers wasn&#039;t a good idea imo.

				Cannabis maybe a starter drug but is by no means a weak drug. In the media we hear this and it is just not true. And if some of the decider will try this &quot;harmless&quot; drug they will come to the conclusion that they never ever will decriminalize it. (just imagine some of the politicans smoking some hardcore grown indoor... lol)<br /><br />There is not much out there that can compete with the enormous HIT you get of consuming cannabis without a tolerance (but smoked before, sometimes it is hard to feel it the first times I heard).<br /><br />On Topic: I managed to handle my strange films on sativa due to smoke less at once. Well and benzos in the desk help, too. ,-)<br /><br />@OP: you can be sooooo glad you did no weed on your shroom trip! ,-) Nothing beats the confusion caused by smoking during psychedelic trips.

				When I smoke weed alone I&#039;m fine but when I smoke it around other people especially people I don&#039;t know that well I start having panic attacks. I have social anxiety and weed intensifies it so I have to be alone when I smoke it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ironically the person who first introduced it to me said it would help calm me down and make me more social but that is not what happens at all.&nbsp; If I&#039;m going to be at a party I prefer alcohol, that actually takes my fear away.

				Despite being dutch i rarely smoke cannabis, so i&#039;d consider myself to have little if any tolerance. Personally i find cannabis to heighten the mood i am in, which can be a good thing, but also a bad one. <br /><br />I know people that smoke cannabis to relax when they feel worried/stressed/etc like other smoke ordinary cigarettes. For me that doesn&#039;t work at all, smoking cannabis when already anxious or worried just makes that feeling worse. On the other hand, when in a relaxed environment and state of mind it also enhances that. I suppose that actually gives merit to smoking pot in a hammock on some tropical island far away from everyday troubles.<br /><br />For me smoking pot doesn&#039;t bring back any past experiences, but i rarely smoke any, and when i do it&#039;s mostly in a relaxed setting hanging out with friends - if someone produces a joint i&#039;ll smoke along when i&#039;m feeling good.

				I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m stating the obvious here but the anxiety/panic attack you described is brought on by intense paranoia (&quot;worrying with extreme intensity that she was going insane and was going to die&quot;) which is a fairly common side effect of weed.&nbsp; Something similar happened to me after I over did a THC concentrate...I bugged out for five straight hours.&nbsp; It was mentally exhausting as I was spending virtually every conscious moment from keeping my mind from completely untethering itself from reality.&nbsp; Horrible, horrible experience.<br /><br />I think eskimoplea7 hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; Most people seem to overlook the fact some people have a lower tolerance to weed (in the same manner as alcohol), and if so, there can be unpleasant side effects as a consequence (somewhat similar, but very different in nature, to alcohol).<br />The fact that it only happened twice leads me to think that this is a tolerance problem and can be controlled.<br /><br />Try experimenting by dialing back the amount she smokes.<br /><br />Secondly, since this is all self induced, if she does start to bug out you&#039;re gonna have to be her anchor again but she&#039;s gotta be able to mentally &quot;self correct&quot; by recognizing that she&#039;s high and that her perceptions/sensations are no longer reliable as absolute truths (that she might feel as if she&#039;s going insane but in reality she&#039;s not).&nbsp; Once she&#039;s able to do that, hopefully she trusts you enough to anchor her mind with your truths.&nbsp;

				I think the real problem is not about weed,it&#039;s about the phobias and conscious of person.If weed can cause panic attacks for a person,other psychedelics(strong psychedelics like lsd or 2c-xs) can definitely cause much worse panic.Psychedelics(including weed) are not therapeutic substances I think,they are just tools to understand something and if someones want to work with them,should purified from their phobias,should really know what to do and should have a healthy and ready mind first of all.I also lived a very bad panic in the past one time about 15 years ago.But I was having some stupid religious beliefs and have some ridiculus phobias(like dark or demons) 15 years ago.Then a lot of water has flowed under the bridge and there isn&#039;t any panic attacks.No phobias=no panic,it&#039;s not about the substance;it&#039;s just about you.

				I&#039;ve had far more weed induced panic attacks than I can count. Marijuana is an anxiety producing substance as much as I love it, and eating weed is even worse. As someone with generalized anxiety disorder, it always bugs me out when I hear people say marijuana gets prescribed medicinally to treat anxiety. That is a joke.&nbsp; If you are prone to anxiety getting really high will only exacerbate it.

				It&#039;s been the experience of one of the ILF that smoking strong cannabis, particularly strong indicas, often produces greatly increased anxiety, paranoia, and even panic.&nbsp; It tends to be irrational and what the whole experience is about.<br /><br />He&#039;s had many an enlightening experience popping E, sniffing K, drinking cactus tea, eating mushrooms, dropping acid, smoking DMT,, etc.&nbsp; Fear or even &quot;bad trip&quot; moments might come up, but they tend to be informative and by no means define the totality of the experience.<br /><br />He&#039;s seen plenty of other people report a similar dynamic.<br /><br />So, he wouldn&#039;t discourage anyone from experimenting with psychedelics just because they&#039;ve had a bad reaction to weed.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as though psychedelics are just some sort of &quot;stronger&quot; drug experience than cannabis.&nbsp; The pharmacology and method of action of the two categories are totally different.&nbsp; So is the qualitative experience.<br /><br />People&#039;s brain chemistry and life experience can be quite different, and so he also doesn&#039;t begrudge anybody smoking a bowl.&nbsp; When he&#039;s been high on weed without the usual attending paranoia, he can see many of the benefits sought out: greater distinction of the component parts of music, sensitivity to humor, looser and more creative thinking, etc.&nbsp; So if you like being high, more power to you.&nbsp; It&#039;s important to realize that people can state that they tend to react badly to being on cannabis without weed-smokers feeling like they&#039;re being attacked.&nbsp; Likewise, there&#039;s no reason to blame people who don&#039;t like weed by saying that their problems with it are all in their head.

It started out with very sparse attacks only when he smoked, then he eventually started having the attacks without the smoking. He went to a doctor (to whom he disclosed his drug history) who believed that the prior drug use played a part in the panic attacks.<br /><br />The attacks initially started due to his weed habit though. Not sure if this story is particularly helpful, but there&#039;s my related anecdote.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hello all,<br /><br />This is my first post and I am very excited to become a member of this elite, reserved community. Anyway, I find this generally interesting because I personally have an extensive history of stimulant use during my childhood (Ritalin, Adderall, etc) based upon an early diagnosis of &quot;ADHD&quot; and (later on) Bipolar Disorder. I do not directly endorse nor ascribe to the psychoemotional dynamics of clinical psychiatry or its correlating worldview. However, I do believe chemical imbalance is a primary causal factor in my own personal issues with severely debilitating anxiety. After a solid 6 years of heavy marijuana smoking (which began shortly after I stopped taking stimulants for ADHD from 6-14 years of age) I began to experience attacks seemingly out-of-nowhere. Introspection proved rather useful in dissecting and tracing the source of my thoughts, but I am certainly MUCH more paranoid and &quot;manic&quot; on psychedelics. I do not feel as if I need them to &quot;think outside the box&quot; (if you catch my drift&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />I have drawn conclusions based upon dedicated research of the subject matter:<br /><br />*Marijuana is a mild psychedelic. Psychedelics possess a secondary stimulant component, but it is widely known that one should NEVER combine them with additional stimulants because of the increased risk of psychosis and damaging dopamine-related effects<br /><br />*&quot;ADHD/Bipolar&quot; children are much more likely to have a history of stimulant/SSRI/Dopamine-modulating drug use and thus must be careful when experimenting with any entry-level psychedelic (including marijuana).<br /><br />These factors do not necessarily qualify an individual for a diagnosis of ADHD/Bipolar, but may indicate you possess a neurochemical imbalance predicated either congenitally, developmentally, somatically or based on a history of drug abuse (notably stimulants).<br /><br />This is just one constellation I have formed in the vastness of a stupefyingly complex multitude of interactions the human mind shares with drugs, which of course is deeply relative to each individual. No two brains are exactly the same!<br /><br />Ye be careful with psychedelics, mate!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have a feeling you&#039;ve got a lot to offer this forum judging from that post&nbsp; hah, welcome.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been prescribed ADD meds for about 5 years and have smoking pot throughout that time and also experience frequent and sometimes severe anxiety so I am very intrigued by your hypothesis regarding that.

				i have a had a few panics on weed but i just ly down for 5 minutes and tell myself that i have smoked a lot of weed and im okay, however if u suffer panic attacks then sativas will not be a great help indicas shud be better, it is best to try look for a strain with some CBD(anti-psychotic and anti anxiety very medicinal cannabonoid) <br />anyway due to prohibition CBD is hard to come accross in local strains but if you search the road u can find strains with higher cbd than the most common strains for example tangerine dream and g13 have high cbd for mainstream strains (not medicinal like harliqin thats like 12% cbd)<br /><br />another thing is that if you buy commercial weed which has been pulled early the cbd wont have very high<br />also make sure your are in the right mood to smoke ie if your depressed i wouldnt recommend it<br />it is best to know your tolerance and get to know and search for the right strain for you and take time whilst smoking to monitor your high snaps for the bong are good for that <br /><br />and if none of that helps perhaps weed is no longer for you :(

				This happens to me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had anxiety for a while and could still smoke for years with no real problems but within the last year or so I got panic attacks when I was high.&nbsp; I was living with a weed garden at the time so I think that most definitely played a part but now I just don&#039;t smoke really, and have no garden to worry about.&nbsp; I eat a cookie once in a while at night before bed and have anti anxiety pills around in case there is a problem but I do not smoke.&nbsp; You might just want to have her not smoke, different drugs affect different people in different ways.&nbsp; You have to listen to your body, don&#039;t force it to do something it doesn&#039;t want to do.&nbsp; Good luck with everything.

				A couple posters pointed out, the excessively high THC content of todays cannabis in causing anxiety.&nbsp; I believe that plays a part, but what may an even bigger affect on anxiety levels, is how much the ratios of certain cannabinoids have changed due to the high THC levels.&nbsp; A few posters pointed this out, and I really agree.&nbsp; It used to be that&nbsp; cannabis had a higher ratio of cannabidiol to THC than it does now. Cannabidiol has a sort of relaxing effect on the anxiety producing effect of THC.&nbsp; This has been proven in tests. When research participants&nbsp; &nbsp;were injected with solutions of THC and cannabidiol researchers found that the &quot;psychotic like effects&quot; were much less intense than with higher ratios of THC.&nbsp; Things such as racing thoughts, anxiety, panic etc were lessened.&nbsp; Cannabidiol has an indirect antagonist affect on THC.&nbsp; Marijuana is a strange plant.&nbsp; In the same plant are substances that are cannibinoid receptor agonist, as well as cannabis receptor antagonists!&nbsp; ??? The really high THC ratios throws this off though.&nbsp; &nbsp;In weed and hash from the 70&#039;s and early 80&#039;s, it wasn&#039;t nearly as common as it is now, to have these side effects unless you were extremely prone to them.&nbsp; It&#039;s only my experience, but as cannabis became stronger and stronger,&nbsp; I heard more and more often, people saying they quit smoking because it made them anxious.&nbsp; I am convinced it&#039;s because the ratios of THC to other cannibinoids is WAYYY off and research seems to back that up.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;For those that are finding they&#039;re having problems with anxiety, but would like to continue smoking, maybe some of the more old school outdoor African weed I&#039;ve seen here might be better. Pure Sativa though.&nbsp; Also, the more old school hashish, like the Afghans,&nbsp; Indian hash etc, may work better.&nbsp; Unfortunately, people with very low scruples cut hash nowadays. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I too used to smoke cannabis very regularly, and eventually, I suppose the term would be, chronically.&nbsp; From about 14 yrs old, I was smoking a couple times a week and by the time I was 16 it was a daily occurrence for me. By the time I was 20, I was what I consider a fairly heavy smoker, on average of 3 to 4 grams of high THC pot a day.&nbsp; (I now completely disagree with someone that young smoking cannabis regularly.&nbsp; I think it interferes with your normal psychological development.&nbsp; I have nothing against adults smoking it, or even 16 yr olds smoking it occasionally.....)&nbsp; anyway, I&#039;m off topic.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I remember deciding that I was smoking too much and should cut down from my, at the time, usual 3 or 4 grams a day.&nbsp; After cutting down a fair bit,&nbsp; I realized what a perpetual haze&nbsp; ;) (excuse the pun) I was in from smoking that much high test weed everyday.&nbsp; More so, than with lower quality pot.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually, I was just smoking on the weekends or at concerts etc.&nbsp; I did have appetite and sleep problems too, for the first while after cutting down a lot.&nbsp; Before I started smoking chronically, I noticed that high test pot could cause some mild, short term anxiety in me.&nbsp; Now that I was no longer a regular smoker,&nbsp; when I did partake, I began to experience bits of anxiety more often and a little more severely than before. My thoughts would also turn negative. Well, I suppose no one has very positive thoughts when they&#039;re feeling very anxious.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp;Gradually, this anxiety became worse until I could no longer enjoy smoking cannabis at all. For the first 30 minutes or so, I was just one big ball of anxiety.&nbsp; At times, it would get so severe that I&#039;d have anxiety attacks, or be on the verge of a panic attack. After 30 to 40 minutes, when the high would mellow a bit, I would then be okay.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Unlike some people here, for me, I usually was better off with Sativas than Indicas.&nbsp; For some reason, that more up high of certain Sativa strains seemed to counteract that negative thought process so that any anxiety felt more mild.&nbsp; I found it difficult to find pure Sativa strains though. So&nbsp; I just stopped smoking altogether, because to me, it just seemed ridiculous to continue taking a drug that almost always caused a bad reaction in me. That&#039;s not the point of recreational drug use.<br />&nbsp;

				Pretty sure I know what I&#039;m smoking (it aint synthetic lol), I have been smoking mostly dank for about 15 years.&nbsp; Of course there are varying levels and strains.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been in a position until now (SR) where I can pick strains however.&nbsp; Except maybe in AMS, where I was so relaxed that it didn&#039;t matter what I smoked..lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do fully believe its your mind state, anxiety level at the time; however the strain can either compound the issue or alleviate it.&nbsp;

				Some people get muscle soreness from statins (Crestor, Lipitor) and some get anxiety from SSRI&#039;s.&nbsp; Are they prone to those side effects? Possibly, but that doesn&#039;t change the *fact* that those are known side effects of those drugs and some people experience them.&nbsp; Just as a known side effect of higher dosages of THC is anxiety.&nbsp; Some people experience this, some don&#039;t. Are those that do they more prone to anxiety? Perhaps, perhaps not.&nbsp; Either way, that doesn&#039;t change the *fact* that one of the *known* side effects of high dosages of THC is anxiety.&nbsp; &nbsp;Research has demonstrated this effect conclusively enough so that anxiety is considered a known side effect of THC. Does everyone experience this? No, of course not, but some do.&nbsp; With any drug, if a certain percentage of people experience an unwanted, or unintended effect from a drug, it is then considered a side effect.<br /><br />The thing is, marijuana has many more chemicals in it than just THC as everyone here knows.&nbsp; Amazingly, of the hundreds of compounds in this plant, there are both cannabinoid receptor agonists and cannabinoid receptor antagonists. I don&#039;t know if it occurs often in nature, that a plant has chemicals in it that cause an effect in the body and also, in the same plant, a chemical that also counteracts that effect, but marijuana does. Cannabinoid agonists and antagonists in the same plant!&nbsp; As one person mentioned, there are so many different strains now as a result of cross pollination, and those different strains have different levels of these agonist and antagonist compounds. Not to mention, they may have slightly different levels of the hundreds of other compounds contained in this plant. Some, that have very high levels of THC (a cannabinoid receptor agonist) also have high levels of some of the antagonist compounds that level out certain effects of THC. So they may counter some of those anxiety producing effects of THC. Some have lower amounts of those chemicals.&nbsp; <br /><br />Due possibly to marijuana having what is referred to as a mild psychedelic effect,&nbsp; mind set may play a role in anxiety.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s totally down to that.&nbsp; Some people are just more prone to feeling anxious from THC no matter what setting they&#039;re in, or what their mind set is. Are they prone to anxiety? Perhaps, perhaps not.&nbsp; Maybe that is just how their body, or brain reacts to THC.&nbsp; Everyone is different. Everyone has different levels of neurotransmitters, horomones, etc in their bodies. (Within certain parameters of course) So when a drug, or compound has known side effects, some people experience some of those side effects, some don&#039;t. IMO, it&#039;s not just set and setting

Many coffeeshops (i.e. weed vendors) actually have a menu of sorts that describe the effects of particular strains. High-CDB strains are often listed as giving more of a stoned then a high sensation, which is preferred by some smokers. <br /><br />The standard pot has become something with a very large THC percentage, and with no focus on any of the other active substances in the plant. This does have the advantage that smoking a smaller amount will get you high as a kite, but the downside that its almost become a stimulant. <br /><br />If you are looking for the reggae typical &#039;chilling stoned in a hammock&#039;&nbsp; experience, i&#039;d certainly look at different strains than the high-thc ones typically sold. Some people might review those negatively because it took them a larger amount to get high, but that does not mean they aren&#039;t any good for getting stoned on at all. <br /><br />

				My opinion on weed induced panic attacks is that they occur to people who are out of touch with there subconscious, uncomfortable, scared, or stressed. Upon smoking those thoughts that are uncontrolled become widely available and with them the whole envelope to your mind does as well, choices, plans, epiphany&#039;s, good and bad.<br /><br />I almost always have the potential to have a panic attack when I smoke weed, every time I do I have to have the situation and next couple hours planned out or at least be with people I&#039;m comfortable with.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at where it really stems from personally and I think it is from what I am doing(my actions) and how far away from the goals I&#039;ve set in my mind are. <br /><br />It is like there are two of me. The person other people see for whatever reason that is theirs,&nbsp; the person others see us as grows on us mentally, if it is negative and you dont take action then that grows into belief. We are animals and often if you don&#039;t make an effort to show your operating above that basic level you wont be seen as a &quot;person&quot; but as an animal, a product or byproduct of many many things. This usually reminds me to continue to take action and plan ahead.<br /><br />Then there is the person we strive to be,&nbsp; this is the person we see the effects of things outside our control on us in a positive light. This person we remind ourselves we want to be and the actions associated with being that person are our inner motives for what we pursue most of the time. When I smoke I feel a bit more comfortable stepping back and questioning things and allowing the person others see me as to take over. It is like I am giving myself permission to be that person to others, good or bad. It then allows me to see different roads and paths I can take to be a better person to these people or perhaps be something different. <br /><br />I think just by the fact your on this website reading this it confirms that you like I share a desire to rebel(my definition of rebel is to deny the claims of others) and question the workings of this world.&nbsp; Often we want to be somebody so great and we plan and plan for how we are going to be that person, but often those plans exclude the basics, specifically of human interaction and more specifically how you will interact on a higher level of consciousness. We settle for less to &quot;achieve&quot; more. Look at DPR, he is widely loved in this community for two reasons. The actions hes taken, and the choice as to how he will treat you. <br /><br />Many people would love to be the rich and famous, but those are the people who have opened themselves up and feel comfortable enough with there humanity to travel into the psyche of other humans, other animals that are in a different place all together. <br /><br />My solution to overcoming a panic attack is to remind myself I&#039;m not Alone. To be completely honest, reminding myself what I consider one of the most important principles of my life that right now I have everything I need to make a or steps towards being the person I want to be often causes the anxiety to increase. I think this is in fact because it is overwhelming, it is absolutely true but without the knowledge of what to do it causes worry. Being in touch with your inner guidance system helps because if you don&#039;t know what to do, just listen to yourself because your body and mind have all the answers you need. <br /><br />Simply put, Panic attacks occur when you haven&#039;t utilized or exercised that one unique thing you have in this world that is your own(your brain), and then you smoke and you begin thinking and it gets overwhelming and well you know how that feels...<br />&nbsp;

				I know I&#039;m in the minority here, but I disagree with the person who called BS on people using marijuana to treat anxiety. I&#039;ve been doing marijuana therapy with a counselor for six months now, and if it wasn&#039;t for marijuana, I wouldn&#039;t have the &quot;normal&quot; life I&#039;m thankful for today. The panic attacks a lot of people posting here from weed are the kind I deal with just from waking up, and I spent far too long playing guinea pig with my doctors on trying to find the &quot;right medication&quot; for my symptoms (caused from GAD, PTSD, and depression). I&#039;m in debt to 420 because I can smoke a bowl or have an edible and move about my day comfortably. Shame that it causes issues for some people, but hey, that&#039;s why we have many drugs to choose from. Sending good vibes to you all :)

				I don&#039;t want to say panic attack is not a real problem or a simple thing,it&#039;s a big problem I think.But I can say about people are living panic attack or panic disorder,making mistakes much before than the first attack.There&#039;s a problem about these people in defining of life and panic is the result of this inaccurate description of life.I mean we should just relax but not in the middle of a panic attack,much before than that and we should relax everytime in our lives.Cause there&#039;s nothing we can do without that and everything is temporal,we just need to understand this completely...then there is nothing to afraid of.On the other hand all of us live our own lives so I don&#039;t really care about these pointless details and this is the best I can do after all. :)

A lot of people keep smoking and smoking, but marijuana should be treated like every other drug. Start with a dose. But I&#039;ve NEVER had a panic attack high the way I do sober. I can feel my body trying to have a panic attack in certain situations like compact crowds of people, but my body physically can&#039;t do it. And it&#039;s been a gift.

				I&#039;d have to say the weed was the cause of the panic attack. I&#039;m saying this because I use to smoke a lot, without any problems. After a few years of heavy use, about 3-4 times a day, with barely any breaks, I started having incredible anxiety one night. I then went on to have what I believe was a 1 in a half year long panic attack. If you have a predisposed illness like depression the weed can trigger the panic attacks too and make them 100x worse. I am just now regaining my thoughts, and actually being able to think clearly. Although I&#039;m not at all back to normal yet, I&#039;m getting there, but heavy usage of weed is what brought me there in the first place. The moral of the story is, look really closely at how you react when smoking weed, and if you have anxiety attacks or panic attacks, or go into some kind of shock regularly from smoking, it&#039;s best to just stop right there, because it could lead to much worse things. I never really had any attacks before, it kind of all hit me at once, it was a very weird feeling, like I couldn&#039;t control what I was thinking.

				I suppose eating cannabis has that property in general. <br /><br />The problem is that it&#039;s often hard to predict how long it will take between ingesting cannabis, and its effects presenting. <br /><br />I remember eating some spacecake as a kid, which didn&#039;t seem to have any effect. A couple of hours later i was on the coach in my parents living room and it suddenly kicked in. I managed to excuse myself and ride out that one in the privacy of my own room back then without any ill effect. <br /><br />Compared to smoking cannabs which acts very quickly, eating it is tricky. One problem in particular being that you eat some, which does not affect you straight away, so you eat some more. If you do that, chances are it will hit you badly after several hours, and there is no way to stop it anymore.

				Ok I&#039;d like to share my personal story on this matter.<br /><br />I was in the college in a state where weed is highly illegal, while I started having more connections either to buy from, or friends smoking and so on. Through time I established a very good connection. I could have from grams to kg of weed in matter of minutes with just a phone call. So I started smoking and smoking and came to a point where for 3 years I would smoke everyday my favourite plant.<br /><br />Always enjoyed the high, especially at the start, I remember going out high, smoke in parks, smoke with alcohol, smoke before food I always had some joints wherever I was going. Slowly I started becoming anti-social, my university grades were going down, didn&#039;t pass important courses and I remember one day studying for 6 hours for a relatively easy course and still didn&#039;t pass it.<br /><br />Sometimes when travelling to other places where I wouldn&#039;t have weed with me I would get some withdrawal symptoms, like insomnia, lack of appetite, feeling anxious and irritable, of course that was going away soon since I would establish a connection fairly fast. I would get crazy sometimes if I couldn&#039;t find some weed. However this wasn&#039;t enough for me to stop.<br /><br />Then I spent some months to another country as a student where pretty much I abused alcohol, weed and ecstasy. My life there was enjoyable however, very easy to socialize, courses easy and so on. Then summer came when I returned to my country again. Enjoyable summer again with occasional weed smoking and alcohol consumption, ecstasy maybe twice until I returned to the university and to another town.<br /><br />Started again smoking everyday. Panic attacks made their first steps into me. I would think that everyone in the street was talking about me, that everyone would try to provoke me and beat me if they had the chance,&nbsp; that neighbours would talk about me and my habits (lived in a street where mostly old people with their families stayed there, with their bad habit to watch you closely from their balconies and such), and on top of that I was feeling like I was being watched all the time and that someone was trying to get in my house and rob me. As for the last part it actually really happened as one night I was hearing strange noises at the door although I was feeling very afraid to get up and check it. Next day there were markings at the door at the spot where the lock is showing pretty much that a tool was used from someone to try to open the door. This added hell of a lot in my paranoia. I couldn&#039;t concentrate on anything, I remember playing a videogame to try to relax my mind, however I would just pretend playing, when actually trying to hear the sounds around the house to check if someone is trying to get inside from anywhere. During this time I always had close friends to support me in anything but I was either too shy or thinking it would seem strange to them to talk about what I&#039;m experiencing. I could tell myself that I was being paranoid and I knew it but that wouldn&#039;t help, my mind couldn&#039;t remove these thoughts.<br /><br />So anyway I said that&#039;s it, and stopped smoking. One week was hell. Panic attacks, lack of appetite, insomnia. I would try to sleep and the sound of some tree branches outside my windows would keep me awake thinking it might be someone checking on my window. Then slowly started getting better but I wanted to sort some things also. I moved to another neighborhood where only students live around, changed my diet to a more healthy one and so on. Panic attacks totally went away, I was able to eat again properly, be more social, all this paranoia was gone. I cut most of my weed related connections and I stopped going to &quot;smoking sessions&quot; that some of my friends still do. I also passed every course I had, also the one I was studying for 6 h but in this case 1h of study was enough to pass with a descent grade.<br /><br />At the moment I would still smoke a bit maybe once a week or every other week, however just a small joint and to enjoy the high. I don&#039;t feel it offers anymore to me only maybe a relaxation after a hard day. And I feel loads better and with some exercise I put in my schedule things are getting better and better. Maybe I&#039;ve outgrown weed, maybe I already had strange thoughts in me (pretty sure of that) but weed made go through a rough time. I don&#039;t regret it because it was a valuable lesson, however I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be a full time smoker ever again.<br />&nbsp;

				Well Cannabis is a psychedelic in a sense. So it&#039;s gonna have strong effects on the mind. She was just really high that&#039;s all. Nothing serious was really going on other than her just manifesting all the anxiety herself.

Upon smoking those thoughts that are uncontrolled become widely available and with them the whole envelope to your mind does as well, choices, plans, epiphany&#039;s, good and bad.<br /><br />I almost always have the potential to have a panic attack when I smoke weed, every time I do I have to have the situation and next couple hours planned out or at least be with people I&#039;m comfortable with.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at where it really stems from personally and I think it is from what I am doing(my actions) and how far away from the goals I&#039;ve set in my mind are. <br /><br />It is like there are two of me. The person other people see for whatever reason that is theirs,&nbsp; the person others see us as grows on us mentally, if it is negative and you dont take action then that grows into belief. We are animals and often if you don&#039;t make an effort to show your operating above that basic level you wont be seen as a &quot;person&quot; but as an animal, a product or byproduct of many many things. This usually reminds me to continue to take action and plan ahead.<br /><br />Then there is the person we strive to be,&nbsp; this is the person we see the effects of things outside our control on us in a positive light. This person we remind ourselves we want to be and the actions associated with being that person are our inner motives for what we pursue most of the time. When I smoke I feel a bit more comfortable stepping back and questioning things and allowing the person others see me as to take over. It is like I am giving myself permission to be that person to others, good or bad. It then allows me to see different roads and paths I can take to be a better person to these people or perhaps be something different. <br /><br />I think just by the fact your on this website reading this it confirms that you like I share a desire to rebel(my definition of rebel is to deny the claims of others) and question the workings of this world.&nbsp; Often we want to be somebody so great and we plan and plan for how we are going to be that person, but often those plans exclude the basics, specifically of human interaction and more specifically how you will interact on a higher level of consciousness. We settle for less to &quot;achieve&quot; more. Look at DPR, he is widely loved in this community for two reasons. The actions hes taken, and the choice as to how he will treat you. <br /><br />Many people would love to be the rich and famous, but those are the people who have opened themselves up and feel comfortable enough with there humanity to travel into the psyche of other humans, other animals that are in a different place all together. <br /><br />My solution to overcoming a panic attack is to remind myself I&#039;m not Alone. To be completely honest, reminding myself what I consider one of the most important principles of my life that right now I have everything I need to make a or steps towards being the person I want to be often causes the anxiety to increase. I think this is in fact because it is overwhelming, it is absolutely true but without the knowledge of what to do it causes worry. Being in touch with your inner guidance system helps because if you don&#039;t know what to do, just listen to yourself because your body and mind have all the answers you need. <br /><br />Simply put, Panic attacks occur when you haven&#039;t utilized or exercised that one unique thing you have in this world that is your own(your brain), and then you smoke and you begin thinking and it gets overwhelming and well you know how that feels...<br />&nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1, couldn&#039;t have said it better myself mate..

				I dunno if this would help any1 but I got panic attacks from smoking weed everyday. I found that it was do with having a low-self esteem, although it was something that i found hard to admit and come to terms with.
