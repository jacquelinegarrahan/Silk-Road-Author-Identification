				So, i have done my fair share of meph, the most recent of which is Lim&#039;s UC which is top shelf as far as I&#039;m concerned. Never had better stuff. :D<br /><br />Well I&#039;ve attempted to vape it both with Lim&#039;s UC and the previous stuff I&#039;ve had which didn&#039;t compare to the UC with &#039;some&#039; success.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done both out of a standard bubble pipe.&nbsp; Well, It&#039;s definitely had a &#039;mephy&#039; taste and I&#039;ve noticed effects.&nbsp; To be honest, I can&#039;t tell you whether the effects have been pronounced or not.&nbsp; I know that sounds weird, but I take a few fat puffs and i notice this interesting headspace.&nbsp; The feeling doesn&#039;t last very long, but i can&#039;t even be quite sure that I&#039;m feeling it, and at the same time, it&#039;s definitely there.&nbsp; Call me crazy if you want, but i don&#039;t know how to describe it.<br /><br />Anyways, i don&#039;t really feel a need or compulsion to continue smoking it, but i tend to anyways..?<br /><br />Getting to the point of this post, I&#039;m under the impression that the hcl salt of meph(which i believe the UC is) has a relatively low bio-availability when smoked and that it shouldn&#039;t cross the blood brain barrier very well.<br /><br />Is there a relatively easy way to remove the base and be left with a freebase version of the substance with which to vape? On a side note, I really like stimulants and have an addictive personality and for these reasons have never tried smoking meth.&nbsp; If this would cause similar issues maybe it&#039;s something i should avoid altogether? haha<br /><br />I apologize for being long winded.&nbsp; thanks in advance for any input. :D

				Thanks, I appreciate your input.&nbsp; <br /><br />Especially to Lim.&nbsp; He KNOWS I&#039;d be purchasing it from him and he&#039;d be the one making the profits on it. Lim, You&#039;ve just earned a LOAD more respect from me.&nbsp; I appreciate and respect your input.&nbsp; I&#039;ll heed your advice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Though i won&#039;t attempt to break it from the base and consume it I will definitely be looking at making another order of your UC sometime shortly after the new year. :D<br /><br />Although it&#039;s none of my business, Do you know of someone who has gone down that road?

Lim is a great vendor, by advising harm reduction.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t pick up the pipe if you get adequate results from snorting. I&#039;ve read that the only way to make it smoke able is when it&#039;s in an oil form which would be messy and hard to work with and in my opinion isn&#039;t worth the time.
