				While very different in nature, drugs and porn are not that far from eachother from a neurological standpoint. The chief difference is that porn creates the drug in the brain, which does not mean it cannot have adverse effects at all.

				actually from a neurosci aspect, they are remarkably similar. <br /><br />that is very intersting deltaFosB is implicated in non-substance addictions, that i had not previously heard.<br /><br />deltaFosB is the protein isoform which is thought to play a role in addiction after the cessation of use... it is much more stable than most proteins and the levels remain high for weeks to months after stopping the administration of whatever pleasurable stimuli... it maintains the physical changes of the neurons which promote the pleasure seeking behavior. then once you have successfully removed the stimuli and reward the levels slowly decrease and thus so do the cravings to an extent. <br /><br />addiction is such a fascinating topic. woulda thought with my interest and neuropharma knowledged i woulda avoided opiates but know i have true understanding of addiction you cant get from reading. fuck, 21 minutes till i can take my next hit

				human addiction / habbit is very hard to break as the brain becomes trained over time, weather it be porn, chatrooms, stimulants, chocolate etc<br /><br />eg i smoked for 20+ year 20 a day, stopped with relative ease &lt;&lt; i made my mind up that i really wanted to stop, and then found it not a problem, out of sight is a strong factor.<br /><br />smoked cannabis 25+ years, wake and bake, when employed dont toke till evening, but as i cant convince my brain 100% i want to stop, i cant, and appear to be cronically addicted.<br /><br />sugar - due top a sweet tooth and bad diet and cannabis, have a strong sugar addiction, recently tried to cut it out due to health, but can stop for a couple of days but if it is there, eg biscuits in a cupboard they will get eaten, <br /><br />will power is weak unless you can fully commit, many people can fight the addiction, but most need help to fight these battles.

				Real interesting stuff. Makes you wonder about the government prohibition of dangerous addictive drugs, while they invest millions into hyper speed internet so we can all feed ourselves porn?
