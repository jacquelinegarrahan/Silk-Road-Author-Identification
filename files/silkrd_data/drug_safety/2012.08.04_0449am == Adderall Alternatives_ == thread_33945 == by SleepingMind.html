				Methamphetamine in very low dosages may fit to your requirements. It&#039;s also cheap - like 40$ for 200 mg of crystals - and therapeutic dosage would be like 5-12 mg twice a day, depending on purity (good vendors sell 80-90% i believe). It&#039;s sold in 5 or 10mg pill form to help with ADHD - much like amphetamine (adderall), but dosage is lower. It also have less side effects - you won&#039;t feel wired and anxious, but you still would be motivated and full of energy, and even would feel some euphoria. But unless it&#039;s not sold in your area i wouldn&#039;t recommend it - ruining your life has never been so easy. I control my consumption by ordering low quantities, and if i would have access to crystal meth in my country i would be fucked up. It&#039;s an extremely dangerous substance and must be treated with extreme caution.

I bought from a highly rated vendor and took low doses of meth, but I just did not like it. Side effects and comedown of meth were way worse than amp. I was taking 15-20mg oral doses of meth.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a large sample size since I&#039;ve only tried meth from one vendor, but I&#039;ll probably stick w/ amph, even if I have to do it much less often because of the price.

				Meth should do the trick. It&#039;s cheaper per mg. Mix into water, do your math so that you know how many mg/ml. I usually buy 0,5 g and mix it with 50 ml water. I then know that 1 ml is equal to 10 mg. <br /><br />If afraid of neurotoxicity add in some vitamins and nutritional supplements. Most important to me is MAGNESIUM (GLYCINATE or CITRATE, never OXIDE)<br /><br />Others are:<br /><br />RESVERATROL<br />VITAMIN C<br />L-CYSTEINE<br />VITAMIN E<br />L-TYROSINE<br />L-CARNITINE <br />HIGH GRADE FISH OIL<br />COENZYME Q10<br />ALPHA LIPOIC ACID<br />VITAMIN D<br />DMAE<br /><br />MELATONIN to sleep<br /><br />But all this may be unnecessary because you can take 0.5mg/kg - that is 40 mg meth daily if 190 pounds of body weight - without fearing neurotoxicity with confidence 99,999 %. 20-30 mg should definitely put you in the safe zone.<br /><br />But addies are good, I admit. I like the combo of 10-20 mg Adderall and 5-15 mg Meth. Addies crushed, water, mixed with meth-water. Then rectal administration and I&#039;ll have the most productive day! To safe some cash you could go down to 5-10 mg adderall and 20 mg Meth.

				The problem with using meth over adderall is that I feel it&#039;s too euphoric. Especially for studying! I don&#039;t understand why people would take an amphetamine to study when they are better used for a night going to bars/raves.<br /><br />Ritalin in my opinion is the best alternative because it is reasonably cheap, non-toxic (as far as we can tell) and not particularly fun. I personally hate it for recreational use (some people seem to love it!) but it has helped me get a few papers done quickly.<br /><br />Or possibly Modalert (Modafinil), which is again cheaper and even less fun. It didn&#039;t help me with concentration whatsoever and it had some pretty weird side effects. The week I tried taking it I couldn&#039;t smoke any weed because if I did I would get serious low blood pressure/blood sugar and pass out. Also was gurning as bad or worse than on any amphetamine. Other people say that it is good however, so it won&#039;t hurt to try.

				Do you live in the US and have health insurance? If so, just make an appointment with a psychiatrist. I was able to walk in and out on a first time visit with a ritalin prescription, which I said I didn&#039;t like. Then she gave me adderall. Now I have a lifetime supply of adderall legally and for very cheap. $40 for the initial visit, $40 for the followup, and $10 for each 30 day supply of pills.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t go overboard with the ADHD symptoms at your appointment, and don&#039;t act like a drug seeker, and you should be good to go.

Be concerned about side effects, and leave the conversation open so the doctor can be the one making the decision for what&#039;s suitable for you. Unfortunately this easy access to adderall led to several day binges on each refill, so I decided to stick with buying lower doses occasionally instead.<br /><br />I might, however try this method again with a different doctor to save me some money, and I could just sell the excess amount to friends at cost, so I don&#039;t have way too many each month.

But unfortuanately as a stated earlier, I stopped getting refills because of my binges. I really should do this again and start selling addies here.

People think because it&#039;s a pill that it&#039;s different, but it&#039;s not, so that can lead to addiction or binging if you aren&#039;t careful because it seems safer to less experienced drug users.

It&#039;s also cheap - like 40$ for 200 mg of crystals - and therapeutic dosage would be like 5-12 mg twice a day, depending on purity (good vendors sell 80-90% i believe). It&#039;s sold in 5 or 10mg pill form to help with ADHD - much like amphetamine (adderall), but dosage is lower. It also have less side effects - you won&#039;t feel wired and anxious, but you still would be motivated and full of energy, and even would feel some euphoria. But unless it&#039;s not sold in your area i wouldn&#039;t recommend it - ruining your life has never been so easy. I control my consumption by ordering low quantities, and if i would have access to crystal meth in my country i would be fucked up. It&#039;s an extremely dangerous substance and must be treated with extreme caution.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re correct, but Desoxyn is pure dextromethamphetamine, while street meth is usually racemic, meaning it has levomethamphetamine, which is shitty. To give you an idea of how sub-par it is, it&#039;s legally available. In Vicks Nasal Inhalers.<br /><br />Of course methamphetamine is still a good option. Just stick to oral dosing.
