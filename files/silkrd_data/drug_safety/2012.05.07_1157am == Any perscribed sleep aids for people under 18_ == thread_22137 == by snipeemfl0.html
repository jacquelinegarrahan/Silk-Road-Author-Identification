				As it says above, I&#039;m looking for a sleep aid I can get prescribed from my doctor to make sleep possible at all. Since it&#039;s getting warmer out, it makes my insomnia even worse, and even 200mg of benadryl doesn&#039;t do anything. <br /><br />Is there anything you know of that I could get prescribed from my doctor? I live in the US. I don&#039;t want to come off like a druggie to my doc asking for specific medications, but I KNOW ambien/alazropham works VERY well, and is the only medication that has actually made it possible to sleep within 30 minutes of taking it EVERY time (took it 5 times), but certain websites hint the FDA hasn&#039;t approved any sleepaids for people under 18, an I SOL? Fuck health and safety organizations, how the fuck can they make decisions that effect every member of a population?<br /><br />Anyways, anything that I could get from my doc and not going through the road is a +. Hoping insurance can cover the bill :)<br />

				If there&#039;s any other way you could sleep better without drugs you should try that first (more quiet, stop activity half hour before sleep, exercise more etc). in my experience, one builds up tolerance to sleep aids very fast, and you need to keep changing your meds to keep them effective.

				Take some Melatonin. It makes falling asleep easier and it&#039;s not going to come back to bite you in the ass like most drugs will.

				You can get promethazine OTC in the UK, brand name sominex. Doctors (at least here) are very reluctant to hand out benzo sleeping pills. Promethazine is great for me, but I don&#039;t generally find it hard to sleep.
