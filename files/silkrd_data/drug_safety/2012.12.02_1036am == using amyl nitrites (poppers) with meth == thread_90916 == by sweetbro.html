				I wouldn&#039;t recommend, but i don&#039;t recommend mixing anything with meth except benzoids on the comedown if absolutely needed. Meth is such a wonderful drug by itself, and when I&#039;ve used others the results were lacking or uncomfortable. <br /><br />Now that my disclaimer is out of the way. I&#039;ve used poppers two times while on a binge. It added to the experience, but left me extremely exhausted after the binge. It took me a few days to get back to normal. I didn&#039;t notice any adverse side effects. I haven&#039;t done it since, because it leaves me extremely fatigued, and slightly depressed. I wish you the best of luck. :) Stay safe.

But that does seem to be the way they come across!<br />From a medical point of view, I&#039;d have thought you would be putting a massive strain on your heart, already over-worked by the meth- a heart attack waiting to happen, now or in 20 years or so, then if you think about the stresses after a four or five day binge on meth...... Doesn&#039;t bear thinking about!

				actually...amyl nitrate is administered to help treat heart attacks...if you do your research you&#039;ll find that since it&#039;s a vasodilator, it lowers blood pressure and they use it to alleviate angina pectoris...<br /><br />p.s. i&#039;m not gay...i&#039;m just a psychonaut who finds names of substances on erowid and wonders &quot;what does it feel like to be on that&quot;
