				I know it&#039;s late but I got my &quot;bunk police&quot; test kit.&nbsp; I still have a gram of tony&#039;s MDMA, so I wanted to share the results amidst all the speculation.<br /><br />The test went from a yellowish orange to purple to black.<br /><br />This leads me to believe it was a mixture of either methylone or methamphetamine with MDMA.&nbsp; This could explain the reason people needed to up their dosage.

				Someone else with more experience testing might want to comment. I have tested pure methylone and it was very yellow.<br /><br />This tested a darker, more orange/yellow to a purple to black. Based on the chart that comes with the kit.&nbsp; The fact that it turned black makes me think MDxx is present.&nbsp; The orange/yellow color and similarity it appearance/effects, I can only guess it&#039;s Methylone but I can&#039;t say that as a fact, only that it&#039;s adulterated.

I mean yeah I give props to people I buy from on here and recommend them but if they started to ask me to go extra curricular then that all changes. Also I think people seem to forget that even though you buy from us and may engage in a bit of chit-chat you DON&#039;T know us, we might be complete cunts IRL, you just don&#039;t know and you never will until shit goes down. You need to maintain common sense about what you are doing and look at it realistically. Too many people attached relationships with Tony which were simply not there, yeah he sold people drugs...but they gave him money in exchange. You wouldn&#039;t develop that sort of overkill about someone who sold you a chocolate bar, why do it just because you are buying drugs from them?

				+1 and karma to you, sirs. Drug dealing is a business. Drug dealers are business men. They aren&#039;t your fucking friends. Fuck tony, but the fallout from that situation could&#039;ve been minimized if people didn&#039;t worship the dude. Respect your vendors? Yes. But don&#039;t give them 100% of your trust. My opinion at least.
