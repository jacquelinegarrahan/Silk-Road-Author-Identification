				Does anyone else experience visual snow? I havent seen the color black in months after my 25i-NBOMe use. It is most prevalent in the dark obviously but I see it normally too, I can ignore it most of the time but it makes watching movies rather difficult. It&#039;s like an old analogue TV on channel one.<br /><br />Cannabis makes it much much worse so i&#039;ve been abstaining from it.<br /><br />Does anyone else have this? It&#039;s the only symptom of HPPD I exhibit and it&#039;s annoying as fuck, they&#039;re little green dots clouding my vision. I used to get it temporarily with blue and red dots with extreme amounts of cannabis/concentrates but it&#039;s here forever now.<br /><br />I fear I will never see black again and regret ever touching 25i because of this. Others have it much worse than me and their static gets bigger and bigger until they get lost inside it mentally. I sometimes feel as though suicide is the only escape from these dots.

				Sorry to hear the HPPD is bugging you so much, @CannabisConsumer. <br /><br />I also have HPPD pretty bad from all the LSD I did back when I was younger. I&#039;ve had it for many years. And smoking weed also makes mine worse. <br /><br />I get a lot of color distortions and some visual snow, though its different from what you describe. I mostly get this at the edges of things. I also get a lot of afterimages (tracers). I see geometric patterns superimposed over everything. Reading can be challenging sometimes as I see random lines or words highlighted in bright yellow or orange. Every now and then it&#039;ll just be alphabet soup and I&#039;ll have to stop trying to read for a while. Probably the most irritating thing I get are these colorful wavy lines in my peripheral vision. Its pretty hard to describe and doesn&#039;t sound that annonying the way I just described it, lol. But I really wish that would just stop. The rest of it doesn&#039;t bug me so much. I kind of enjoy it, actually. ;D<br /><br />I hope you can find a way to feel at peace with it. For me, it was easy because I intentionally did this to myself. So I can&#039;t really get too upset for getting what (I thought) I wanted. Also, I find it more enjoyable when I can control it. As in, I&#039;ll look at the carpet and command it to swim around. When it obeys, its pretty satisfying ;D Again, smoking weed enhances this ability. Its a good way to ward off boredom ;)<br /><br />Peace
