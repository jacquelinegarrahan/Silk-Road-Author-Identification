				I&#039;m confused. Buyers seem to whinge about the speediness of coke that has been cut with Levamisole. Coke users talk about the good ol&#039; days and the purity level. But the best selling coke, no - the best selling item on the entire marketplace - is one of the cheapest coke products with one of the highest Levamisole % available. Some are saying easily less than 50% cocaine. The market has spoken. You guys LOVE impure, heavily cut, cheap ass charlie. <br /><br />What steps do coke heads take (if any) to use coke as safely as possible? Especially that coke. Are the reports of Levamisole fatalities and immune system damage overblown, or has this mix become the new thing?

				A lot of people don&#039;t even know what real charlie feels like. <br /><br />It&#039;s kinda crazy.<br /><br />But when you receive a batch there are certain tests you cna do at home to figure out how much caine content is in there, and then determine what kind of caine it is. As for levamisole, it&#039;s much harder, takes a specialized test kit that isn&#039;t easy to make. But directions are out there on the net. Alternatively, if your country has a drug safety lab that lets you test your goods, you can take it there.<br /><br />As for the levamisole reports, they&#039;re a bit overblown. Yes, it&#039;s a risk you didn&#039;t have to deal with before. But just because you do charlie with leva in it doesn&#039;t man you&#039;ll start losing limbs.<br /><br />This is a quote from an article on time magazine....<br /><br />t despite the wide use of levamisole, cases of agranulocytosis are relatively uncommon. According to government surveys, nearly 2 million Americans have used cocaine at least once in the past month. &quot;Why aren&#039;t 90% of cocaine users [in San Francisco] getting sick?&quot; wonders Graf, who says he sees about one case every few weeks, mostly in women. He suspects that men are less likely to be affected because they are less vulnerable to autoimmune disorders than women, but says the truth is that no one really knows why certain users become ill. Zhu and Graf urge users who are suffering from fever or unexplained infections to seek medical help immediately — the sooner agranulocytosis is treated, the greater the odds of survival.<br /><br />

				Most of the internet reports on levamisole are 2-3 years old, so I was wondering if Colombian (as well as Bolivian and Peruvian) cola is still being cut with this substance. Seems like it wouldn&#039;t be in the best interest of the major suppliers to use this agent given the publicity.<br /><br />I&#039;m cautiously concerned since I&#039;m a regular user and wonder if levamisole builds up in the body. Last thing I want is areas of my body turning black.

				I remember someone testing a bunch of different batches from the vendors on SR, earlier this year. <br /><br />The testing center found that most samples contained levamisole. But it differed in quantity. Some batches had more than others.<br /><br />You won&#039;t see a build up of it unless you continuously do it day in and day out. If you stay moderate and don&#039;t do an 8th a night, you should be good. Also make sure to take care of yourself afterwards. Take vitamins, eat healthy, get some rest. Try to keep your immune system top notch with everything else you do.<br /><br />The black spotches is a rare reaction, but occurs since levamisole hurts your immune system. So your body cant fight off infection as easily.<br /><br />The good news is that it seems that the dangers of levamisole are becoming more apparent. Some dealers are actually testing for it, and if they find it, look for a new supply. If this happens a lot, then you&#039;ll see the producing countries put less leva in coca, or none at all.<br /><br />For now, your best bet is to moderate consumption.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Moderation is good for many reasons, but I&#039;m like a kid in a candy store since my discovery of SR, so I&#039;ve been going a little crazy. I do keep myself in top health with diet and exercise, so I hope this helps me fight off any of the effects, if any, of leva. Your counsel is appreciated—I . . . just . . . need . . . to . . . slow . . . down.&nbsp; ;-)

				@ Metta - I totally here you on moderation. Until I discovered SR, i hadn&#039;t done blow in god knows how many years, probably about six, ever since SR, it&#039;s almost a monthly occurrence lol. The only reason I don&#039;t do half a ball a night is because I have to wkae up in the Am and my wife doesn&#039;t like me all yakked out (she doesn&#039;t care if I do it, but would rather not see me all tweaked).<br /><br />@baren, there are ways to tell, but none or easy to do or particularly accessible (unless you&#039;re a chemist)<br /><br />Speaking of which, i&#039;m sure some SR users are chemists, or have basic chem knowledge... the instructions for building a leva test are out there, if someone would do it and sell the tests, they&#039;d have a lot of buyers i&#039;m sure.<br /><br />You know, if the source is cutting 5% leva or less to 95% blow, I don&#039;t care. But i&#039;ve seen someone who had way more than 15% leva in their batch.... that&#039;s no good..<br /><br />You can&#039;t remove leva with acetone, and it you cant detect it with a foil or bleash test either. If you can get your hands (or make) chlorophyl, then you could have an idea, but still, leva is somewhat soluble in that, so you&#039;d have to do a quick stir to see what you get.
