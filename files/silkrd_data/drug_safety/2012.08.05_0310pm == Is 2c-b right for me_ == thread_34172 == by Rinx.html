				For a long time I have enjoyed rolling on xtc, however I liked the pills I got when I was younger because it would be more of an uppity roll (I am assumeing they were cut with something). As far as molly goes I find it to feel almost as good but is really missing the rush aspect. I have no experience with LSD, but I have taken shrooms many times in the past as far as psychedelics go. <br /><br />I have done some reading on erowid and looked for some reviews and I noticed 2c-b negative effects list is less than most of the drugs I am interested in trying. I roll every 3~ months or so and my girlfriend and I the past two times we rolled had major issues with Jaw clenching &amp; Teeth grinding resulting in pain for the next 3-7 days. Our last time rolling we took 2 150 MG capsules, about 2 hours later took another 2 100 mg capsules and a small bump 100mg between the two of us since we were coming down and didn&#039;t re-dose soon enough.<br /><br />From everything I have found about 2c-B it seems relatively safe, cheaper than Xtc/Molly, with a longer duration. We generally enjoy taking a day 12-16 hours once a month and enjoying some sort of substance.<br /><br />Activity&#039;s we generally do and don&#039;t want to be prohibited from are.<br /><br />Sex, Swimming, Showers, Walks, listening loud music<br /><br />Also does 2c-b have a high tolerance &amp; is re-dosing ok &amp; safe? I was figuring for a first time taking 20mg each &amp; re-dosing another 20mg 4 hours later.<br /><br />Any feedback would be fantastic! <br /><br />Thanks ahead of time!

				Sounds like you should be okay, dunno why you wouldn&#039;t be. You seem to have the proper mindset and if you enjoy the other drugs you listed, then you&#039;ll enjoy 2C-B as well. I usually do 15mg and redose 2 hours later with 20mg depending on how I&#039;m feeling, and I&#039;ve had no ill effects, but be sure to see what other people say as well because different people experience different things. 2C-B is a great drug, have fun with it&nbsp; :)

It doesn&#039;t interfere with performance like MDMA and M1 can, and it inspires all parties involved to some truly depraved and marvelous acts of lechery.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I were you, I might try 20mg oral and a 5mg intranasal bump when you start coming down.&nbsp; While it definitely burns, I find snorting gives me a nice quick psychedelic rush and gives the experience a delightful kick in the pants.

				go for it dude.&nbsp; its a pretty mild psychedelic.&nbsp; <br /><br />i think you may be expecting it to be similar to rolling though, which it really isn&#039;t IMO.

				Thanks for the responses. I don&#039;t expect it to be the same as MDMA but I am under the impression it does have a very good body high as well as psychedelic properties.

				Haha, I have literally 10 x 20mg caps of 2CB sitting here for months and I just can&#039;t seem to get around to taking any!<br /><br />For me it&#039;s been mostly Molly for the past 6 months, but I&#039;m a little bit over it to be honest.&nbsp; It&#039;s great for about 3 hours and then it&#039;s a slooooowww decline to baseline which I&#039;m finding a bit tedius.<br /><br />From all reports, dropping 15-20mg of 2CB at 4+ hours into taking MDMA is apparently a very nice way to do it, but 90% of the time I only have an 8 hour window before I have to at least appear &#039;normal&#039; so long extended trips don&#039;t suit me at the moment.<br /><br />But hey, if it&#039;s you and your SO having a fun day, I&#039;d give the above suggestion a crack and see how you like it.<br /><br />Just be sure to measure the stuff properly.&nbsp; I wince everytime I hear people eyeballing RC&#039;s.

				I think 2c-b is one of the greatest drugs I&#039;ve ever used, hands down. It&#039;s a gentle, loving psychedelic.
