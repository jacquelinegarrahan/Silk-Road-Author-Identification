				hey guys, so I&#039;m pretty new to mixing my own caps as traditionally I&#039;ve bought street pills and such. recently though I find that mixing my own caps gives me the freedom of putting exactly what I want with it, so after doing a bit of reading here and there here&#039;s what I came up with (from suggestions and making up my own mind):<br /><br />130-140 mg mdma + 25 mg speed + 40 mg caffeine<br />a small redose of say 50 - 60 mg with maybe 10 mg speed + 20 mg caffeine at say T + 1.30 to 2 depending on how I feel<br />and finally to close off the night with 20 - 25 mg 2 - cb <br />would it be advisable to dose the 2cb separately? or mix it in the cap?<br /><br />what are your thoughts on this particular dosage? the speed is mainly just a bit of kick for more energy to dance, also keep in mind this will be an all day festival from 12 noon till 11 or so at night and I plan to take the first dose around say 5-6 in the evening maybe earlier. Suggestions / thoughts will be very much appreciated.

				It&#039;s cool that you&#039;re playing around with mixing your own caps. I remember&nbsp; the days when I was first starting to do that. :)<br /><br />I would personally suggest getting rid of the caffeine. I hate it by itself and hate it even more in combinations with other stims. Too much stimulation in my opinion. Is the speed just regular amphetamine or methamphetamine?<br /><br />I would put the 2c-b in the booster cap. That&#039;ll kick the experience up several notches and blow you into a new world of MDMA/2c-b euphoria. Lose the caffeine. It will most likely make you feel like your heart is about to explode, or make you nervous and paranoid and ruin your roll. Amphetamine synergizes ok with MDMA but in my experience it also caused more anxiety than anything else. <br /><br />If the speed you mention is methamphetamine, then you could very easily dose it as low as 15 mg if you have little to no tolerance and you will experience a rush like no other. Plus, it will help give you the energy you want to keep going all day. Keep in mind that MDMA is a stimulant on its own...<br /><br /><br />Bottom line: If you want to roll, just take the initial 140 mg MDMA capsule first. Don&#039;t add anything to it.<br />When you take your booster dose, that&#039;s where you should consider adding your &quot;speed&quot; (whatever that is) and your 2c-b.<br />Fuck caffeine.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful, and I hope you know that I just don&#039;t like caffeine for personal reasons. Do what you will. :)

				hey there, thanks a lot for the well thought out reply<br />yeah i might just lose the caffeine altogether after reading what you said. the speed is just regular amphetamine, but i just got an order of adderall in, what would you recommend? i&#039;ve basically got amphetamine or adderall to choose from.<br /><br />i have very little tolerance to speed at this point of time. <br /><br />hmm very good point there, just 140 mg of pure mdma and adding speed + 2cb later on.<br /><br />so do you just suggest dropping 2 caps for the duration of the day?<br /><br />edit: if you&#039;re reading this, do you suggest mdma + speed + 2cb all in one cap?

				Since this is a drug safety forum, I feel the need to point out that taking MDMA and speed together is fairly irresponsible.&nbsp; Studies have shown that amphetamine administered with MDMA greatly increase neurotoxicity.&nbsp; If you could take them on separate days, that would be far safer&nbsp; :)

I have seen Supertrips has a blended pill and thankfully he lets people know. Speed in MDMA for me is wicked intense but has a way harder crash and makes it even harder to fuck if it comes up&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I usually do 100mg to start and dose an extra 100mg when I am coming up. I dig a booster with 12mg insulfated or 20mg oral 2CB when the effects begin to wane. Super magic. It was suggested that after the comedown DMT is good but I did not enjoy it. Too fuzzy like I was looking through frosted glass. I am curious about mixing MDMA with a tryptamine like 4HO MIPT which also has great visuals, euphoria and makes me feel like an erotic beast. It is a Psylocin analogue and 30mg alone is great for EDM. A good old fashioned LSD candyflip might be faily energetic, just be sure it is not an NBOME.

Also, I would suggest holding off on the amphetamine til you&#039;re absolutely sure you want to take it. Like I said, one time I mixed MDMA with amphetamine and it just kinda ruined the magic of the roll with a weird rushy paranoia energy thing. <br /><br />So, to sum it all up, here&#039;s my final suggestion for you based on your questions: Drop the cap with 140 mg MDMA first. Then, once you&#039;ve hit one or two MDMA peaks, consider taking a booster cap. In the booster cap, I suggest having MDMA and 2C-B together. They will be lovely. Keep your amphetamine dose in a separate cap and don&#039;t take it unless you&#039;re absolutely sure you want that extra energy. Keep in mind that MDMA and 2C-B are both stimulants and will have your body going already. And, as mentioned before, amphetamine increases the neurotoxicity of MDMA. AKA you&#039;re going to feel alot shittier when you come down if you take the amphetamine than if you just stick to the MDMA and 2C-B.<br /><br />Have fun and enjoy the ride! <br />Let us know how it goes with a nice report :)
