				Howdy,<br />&nbsp; So I&#039;m in need of some advice.&nbsp; I need to find a drug that gives me a nice euporhia.&nbsp; My past history is as follows<br /><br />I smoked/sold weed from 15-18 I mean alot. Like a 1/8 to 1/4 a day.&nbsp; I stopped when I turned 18 and haven&#039;t done an illegal drug since.&nbsp; I also did some mushrooms back then aswell.<br /><br />Since then I have been an alcoholic (~10 years).&nbsp; I went 4 years sober at one point, but relapsed this summer. I&#039;m now two months sober. <br /><br />I use to get a great euphoria from ambien, and would take that daily, during the day, but the effect has worn off and I don&#039;t get it anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any suggestions as to what another substance could be? <br /><br />I won&#039;t shoot, snort. Cocaine and hard drugs are out of the question.&nbsp; I just need a good way to get some euphoria without getting withdrawals if possible.&nbsp; Being able to be discreet would be nice too.<br /><br />Any advice is welcomed. <br />Thanks<br />

				Maybe nitrous oxide.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />No, that&#039;s bullshit advice now that I think about it. Nitrous oxide is addictive and you seem to have an addictive personality.

				Personal truth answer:<br />You are looking for a perfect high that hardly exists in the world of drugs. The best thing for you in this given situation is to spend time learning to meditate. With practice, one can induce euphoria quickly with meditation. Yes, it takes time and effort to learn but this is healthy, progressive, and will fulfill all the needs you have.<br /><br />With regards to drugs, using drugs for their euphoric effects is a direct route to addiction. <br />It turns into &quot;chasing the high&quot;. <br /><br />The answer you are looking for:<br />With that out of the way, it sounds like the drug that would be most euphoric for you is phenibut if used in moderation. With 1-1.5 grams (yes, I mean 1,500 mg) there is relaxation, euphoria, and a sense of well-being. If you do not fall asleep, it can also provide (surprisingly) a good amount of stimulation. Also, this drug is legal and unscheduled. <br /><br />You might also look into drugs like Adderall, Dexedrine, or Vyvanse as those are all somewhat euphoric stimulants. Not exactly sure what would fall into the &quot;hard drugs&quot; category though...<br /><br />Wishing you all the best. I hope you consider staying sober and developing the potential of your mind, which is endless. Only from that is pure and infinite happiness available.<br /><br />Happy Holidays!

				Hey whysoserious :)<br /><br />I felt very moved by your post and wish to respond fully.<br /><br />As an opening disclaimer I want to let you know that I am a SR vendor and that I sell GHB. I sell GHB because I believe in its profound clinical/therapeutic qualities - in addition to its obvious recreational pleasures. I&#039;m mentioning this upfront because someone suggested in a thread I commented on a couple of days ago that I was merely (and inappropriately) promoting GHB because I was selling it. That was not true then and is not true now - but I want to be upfront and transparent before I properly respond to you.<br /><br />I want to say that I feel your search and your need, and I understand it fully in my heart. And I know how deep it goes and how fundamental it is to human existence. And while I do not completely practice this myself yet, I have learned one thing about life, and it is this: Pleasure / euphoria / ecstasy / happiness (all words for essentially the same state) is INHERENT. And to be authentic and constant it needs to be discovered at the essence of who you are, rather than sought for through anything external - whether that be sex, food or a drug.<br /><br />As long as you are looking for a way to induce a state of pleasure within yourself through some &quot;external&quot; metaphor you will be bound and controlled by that thing. And it WILL BETRAY YOU ultimately. If you can understand this - and I believe that you will resonate with I have just said immediately, because you know it is the truth - then there can be a discussion which seeks to answer your question more concretely for the moment.<br /><br />Without this understanding, and your recognition that you ultimately need to find this euphoria in your own heart, you will be trapped in an endless cycle of chasing a pleasure that you can never truly hold onto.<br /><br />However, if you can remember this truth, even while you still use external means to create pleasure, then your true nature will reveal itself to you in time and progressively. And you can then be more conscious in your choices about which external substance / metaphor to use - and do so as part of a process by which you begin to recover the inherent pleasure which is already your own.<br /><br />So holding this knowledge close the following can be spoken:<br /><br />You have a history with Cannabis and most recently alcohol (ethane hydroxide by its formal chemical name), which I sense has probably been a bit of a ride for you...<br /><br />Because of your experience with alcohol (which has a particular pattern by which it induces euphoria) and also your use of Ambien (a GABA-A agonist) which you derived some pleasure from, I want to suggest that you read the content at these links:<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705225/<br />http://users.lycaeum.org/~ghbfaq/alcoholism.html<br />http://biopsychiatry.com/ghbalc.htm<br />http://biopsychiatry.com/ghb/authentic.html<br /><br />With all the caveats mentioned in these articles, GHB may be something for you to look at in order to transition and stabilize prior to the next phase of your journey. It is important, if you choose this course, that you consent to be radically responsible with your use of it, and recognize it as a bridge to get you to a good place of balance. The state it engenders will also allow you to process all the psychological and emotional stuff that you are needing to - and in a smooth and accessible way.<br /><br />Given your previous tendencies with alcohol, you will also need to be extra carefully that you do not merely substitute GHB for the alcohol. Although it is a far more benign substitute, if you merely do this you will miss the opportunity for your greatest possibility - which is to begin to live from your own inherent bliss rather than some temporary chemical-induced buzz. Kinda like getting to be drugs rather than taking drugs ;)<br /><br />Once you are at a place of balance again and beginning to feel the possibilities of your own nervous system (even if only the barest thread) then you may wish to explore, if you have that predilection, using deeper healing drugs, such as LSD, Mescaline, Ayahuasca and Iboga (particularly the last two). With these you can begin to see (and then release) the patterns by which you unconsciously suppress the inherent pleasure of your own nature. And that is when is starts to get interesting! <br /><br />And if deep shamanic work is not your thing then consider doing yoga, t&#039;ai chi and/or working with a therapist who is deeply versed in transpersonal psychology. And, in fact, do these even if you do explore the psychedelics! And consider adding things such as structural integration/Rolfing (a very deep kind of bodywork) and acupuncture - all of which will support the direction you are moving in.<br /><br />And throughout this process (and starting right now ideally) you need to progressively start doing all that you can to improve the functioning of your body and nervous system. In order to tolerate consistent inherent euphoria (and I use the word &quot;tolerate&quot; deliberately) you will need the channels in your body to be open and flowing. And as your body (nerves, brain cells, vital organs, blood and bone marrow) is built directly from what you eat, getting your diet right is fundamental to this. (I have been studying nutrition for nearly twenty years so I can assist you with this if you like - just ask.)<br /><br />What you are wrestling with now is what every human being on this planet is wrestling with (each in our own unique way) - and that is how to feel utterly full, happy and blissful, in every moment, despite our circumstances. And that is ultimately what the spiritual quest and process is about. Welcome! <br /><br />Talk to me more anytime brother...<br /><br />BG

				I chase euphoria and SR is definitely helped me out big time. So here are some drugs I would recommend for euphoria LSD, MDMA, GHB, ketamine, shrooms, and weed. Christy Nugs blue dream really causes alot of euphoria for me I suggest you try that since its just weed, you may be surprised how good it is.

LSD can be very life changing as well and thats part of the true magic. I have had some of the best times of my life on LSD. This holloween I got some acid at like 3AM and all my friends were asleep but I was bored so I took it and i tripped nuts all night having the time of my life watching music videos on Fuze tv. I remember I was watching a flat screen LED tv and I kept thinking how vibrant the colors were. Colors become so beautiful on LSD, its like all of your life before LSD all the colors were faded then when you take acid your seeing the true beauty of the colors.

Like a 1/8 to 1/4 a day.&nbsp; I stopped when I turned 18 and haven&#039;t done an illegal drug since.&nbsp; I also did some mushrooms back then aswell.<br /><br />Since then I have been an alcoholic (~10 years).&nbsp; I went 4 years sober at one point, but relapsed this summer. I&#039;m now two months sober. <br /><br />I use to get a great euphoria from ambien, and would take that daily, during the day, but the effect has worn off and I don&#039;t get it anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any suggestions as to what another substance could be? <br /><br />I won&#039;t shoot, snort. Cocaine and hard drugs are out of the question.&nbsp; I just need a good way to get some euphoria without getting withdrawals if possible.&nbsp; Being able to be discreet would be nice too.<br /><br />Any advice is welcomed. Thanks<br /><br /><br />MDMA has healing property&#039;s most folks don&#039;t understand it, and they rarely get the drug in a pure form,&nbsp; As with all drugs you need enough quantity to learn the drug, proper dosing and your tolerance, MDMA is interesting in the fact that if you use to much you will feel like shit, and if you use it to often you won&#039;t get off, so in some respects it&#039;s self regulating and non adictive. I have been successful using it every two weeks to every two months for over five years. If your going to do this I would recommend buying at least 5G and then grind and clean it with 2 or 3 dry acetone washes to remove the by products of mas manufacturing, expect to loose 15-20% of your product, you don&#039;t want that part any way it makes you sick, there are many posts on the internet on this subject and its not difficult to do.<br />Generally, a&nbsp; 130 lb female will enjoy a 150mg cap and a 80-90mg cap an hour after the first. For your first ride back it off about 20%, like I said, it takes time to learn a drug if you do to much it will make you sick. I have tried most of the other drugs mentioned in this post with little or no luck, MDMA in my opinion is the best therapeutic drug out there. And then there is this: an MDMA roll is how can I say,,,FUCKEN AWESOME!!!!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I come from a (documented) line of alcoholics and 2011 - July2012 was a fucking awful time for me. Had ZERO access to bud, I abused alcohol daily, and became a hermit due to PTSD and a social anxiety disorder. I have a drink here and there now, but I really try not to. Getting buzzed/drunk now gives my body the same discomfort an oncoming panic attack does. And I hate the taste of most drinks now. It is weird, but I am thankful for it. I have since moved to a different location that is even less bud-friendly but now I have SR :) Weed is my DOC and gave me a new freedom to step back out into the sunlight, a start to finding happiness.

				Is an important point being missed here, what setting do you need your euphoria in. Do you need it at home on your own, in a social environment, in a discreet social environment etc? As obviously u dont wanna be walking down the street during the day rolling hard on mdma

				I&#039;m afraid the search for substances just stops.<br /><br /><br />There simply are not drugs that cause euphoria and are non-addictive. <br /><br />I think this is a principal matter though, anything that induces euphoria is something you want to experience again. It doesn;t matter what substance you prefer, its the actual sensation of euphoria that is addictive,

Chasing euphoria normally leads to addiction. Ben couldn&#039;t of said it better.
