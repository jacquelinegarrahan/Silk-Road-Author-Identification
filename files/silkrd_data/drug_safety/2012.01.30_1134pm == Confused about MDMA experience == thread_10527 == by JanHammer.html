				Title: <strong>Confused about MDMA experience</strong><br />

				My first experience on MDMA was fantastic. The second one left me confused. Both times MDMA was pure, but different. So I need to figure out what went wrong and what I&#039;m supposed to feel.<br /><br /><br />FIRST TIME:<br />I used 1000mg of VitC, blueberry pills (200mg), 300mg 5-HTP about an 30mins-1h before taking MDMA. <br />Then I took 100mg-300mg of MDMA - I have no idea of knowing. I eyeballed and thought I was taking 100mg, but now after measuring what is left in the bag, I think it may have been 300mg.<br /><br />I felt stomach churning before onset. Then I felt an aura around me and I felt a little bit intoxicated (like from alcohol). I was very happy,friendly, chatty, caring and enjoying music. I could still think a bit rationally when needed, but was otherwise a little careless and dizzy. Also I could not remember to drink water and couldn&#039;t rememeber all the details afterwards.<br /><br /><br />SECOND TIME:<br />I took 5-HTP in the morning two days before (150mg+150mg) taking MDMA. Took VitC (500mg) and blueberry pill (100mg) ~1h before taking MDMA.<br /><br />I took 100mg of MDMA. An hour later - felt no stomach churning like last time and only mild effect - increased mood but not much else. A bit later (30-40 mins) I took another 60-80mg. Definitely better - euphoric feeling comes and goes, wanna chat but can restrain, am caring, but I can think completely rationally, no intoxication or aura feeling like the first time. I also easily and constantly remembered to drink water, and can remember everything that happened clearly.<br /><br /><br />Bonus info: time between experiences - 1 month; my bodyweight is only 65kg (underweight); I don&#039;t parachute, simply swallow MDMA powder and drink water.<br /><br /><br />MY QUESTIONS:<br /><br />1. How does one supposed to feel on MDMA? (Errowid effects list doesn&#039; really help)<br />2. Is there supposed to be intoxication effect on counciousness from 100mg-150mg or at all on MDMA?<br />3. Is one supposed to be able to think rationally while on MDMA?<br />4. Does one lose more control the higher the dose? Or is there only difference in intesity of euphoria, etc.?<br />5. Is there a difference if one takes, e.g., 100mg and later 60mg versus 160mg at once?<br />6. How does vitamin quantity and their time of usage affect&nbsp; MDMA? What are the ideal conditions?<br />7. How does stomach contents affect MDMA? What are the ideal conditions?<br /><br />Answering these questions or redirecting me to an existing detailed experience report would be greatly appreciated, thanks :) <br />

I take b6 + 5htp + vitamin C every night before I sleep up till two days before I roll, night I roll, and every day after.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">7.

Food just delays the come up and may diminish some of the effects.

				Hello,<br />There is a huge difference between a 300mg and a 160mg dosage ! Of course it could be a difference depending what there is in your stomach but I think it&#039;s really dosage and mood that make differences. <br />Personally I experience a stage around 250 mg and it&#039;s a very different high : it really kicks hard, I sometimes feel sick during a few minutes, I experiment some visual effects and they are phases when I really lose control. Of course comedown is harder too !&nbsp; <br />If I just want nice and mellow effect I stay under 200mg , and I prefer to redose than drop one parachute (120mg and then 60mg is a kind of ideal range for me). <br /><br />And I don&#039;t understand why you don&#039;t parachute : the taste is disgusting and I don&#039;t know if just swallow powder is as efficient.<br /><br />WL

So there may be a difference between swallowing powder and dropping parachute ! In any case it&#039;s very important to really crush the crystal until you obtain a very fine powder.<br /><br />WL

				How does a kid feel when he&#039;s at an amusement park? How does a person feel when they win the lottery? How does a person feel when they got that big job they&#039;ve always wanted? How does a person feel when they fall in love? How does a person feel when they&#039;ve accomplished a major goal of any kind?<br /><br />This is how you feel on MDMA. Everything is happy. Everything is perfect. Everything is bliss. You love everything and everyone. Everyone is your best friend and you feel like you&#039;ve known them forever.<br /><br />At least, that&#039;s my experience.
