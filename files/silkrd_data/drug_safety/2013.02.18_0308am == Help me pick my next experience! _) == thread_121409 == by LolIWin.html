				Hey guys so here we go, I have $70 in my account after sending out 4-5 orders. (Ounce of LL MDMA, QP of NWD Lemon, some hash oil, and some wax) Anyways, I need something new to try and I&#039;m hoping you guys can help me out.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve done:<br /><br />MDMA- (4-5 times) I&#039;ve done the &#039;Defqon&#039; pills 3 times and did SuperTrips MDMA twice.<br /><br />Marijuana- (Not an everyday smoker but normally around twice a month) Done Cocezero and first order from NWD on Silk Road.<br /><br />Adderall/Vicodin- Done Adderall plenty of times, Vicodin a few but not really a fan.<br /><br /><br />So these are the drugs that I&#039;ve consumed so far. I&#039;m looking into trying a psychedelic. I&#039;m very picky when it comes to what I put in my body. I make sure that I&#039;m getting what I pay for, that it isn&#039;t harmful, and that I&#039;ll have a good time. I&#039;ve been looking into my next order of either LCD, shrooms, or RC&#039;s. These are the thoughts I&#039;m having...<br /><br />Shrooms- If I were to go down this path I was either thinking ordering 14 grams of &#039;Foxcave&#039;s shrooms&#039; from what I&#039;ve read it looks to me like I&#039;d need to consume around a gram to have a good trip? Either that or go with the &#039;P. Galindoi Chocolate Bars.&#039; I&#039;m not really sure about the chocolate bars, if i&#039;m going to trip I want it to be pretty good. And do you really get what you pay for them?<br /><br />LCD- I was looking into the 100ug but it seems a lot pricier than the shrooms and I understand that it&#039;s probably worth it &#039;trip wise&#039; but if it&#039;s my first time I don&#039;t want to go to crazy. Plus in my mind (no harm feelings at all!!) i&#039;d feel kind of like a druggy trying it. Idk. We&#039;ll see.<br /><br />RC (2C-B) - I really have no idea about these dose wise, I don&#039;t even know if 2C-B would be considered an RC. They seem cheap, but they also seem like they&#039;re cheap because nobody knows anything about them. Probably won&#039;t go down this path.<br /><br />What do you guys think? I&#039;m leaning towards the shrooms..once I decide what to order I&#039;ll leave a very detailed experience on this thread.<br /><br />Thanks guys:) Love the community here!

				I defiantly recommended LSD over shrooms. stay away from LucyDrop&#039;s 100ug though. People are reporting that they are way lower than advertised <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.5055<br />This thread is perfect for researching LSD venders.<br />If sourcing LSD is too much of headache for you, you can&#039;t go wrong with shrooms either :)

				LSD or shrooms. <br /><br />But don&#039;t use them the same way you&#039;d use the other drugs you listed. These are spiritual substances. <br /><br />LSD is not a &#039;druggie drug&#039;. Quite the opposite, actually. It&#039;s a spiritual molecule with similar effects to mushrooms and peyote.

				Mescaline or LSD is my vote. Shrooms are fun, do them with a couple buddies though I wouldn&#039;t say they&#039;re as much fun as LSD or mescaline alone. If I had to pick one, I&#039;d go with LSD... Fucking crazy experience. Hard not to enjoy or at least learn a lot about yourself/life you never realized before. Make sure to update what you pick and always keep an open mind.&nbsp; ::) There are some crazy drugs out there, it&#039;s up to you to pick the good ones and the bad ones!

				Good choice with Foxcave&#039;s! Yummy stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp;:) Whatever you do, try the molly with the shrooms! Even for a first shroom experience! Did it for my 1st magic mushie experience and it makes for such an awesome mental/happy high. Ingest mushrooms, wait 45 minutes, ingest/snort molly.

				Think you mean LSD, not LCD - seriously don&#039;t eat a Liquid Crystal Display ;)<br /><br />2C-B is good &amp; well worth trying, much smoother &amp; more forgiving than other 2Cs. While the 2Cs are still probably widely considered RCs or Research Chemicals they&#039;ve now been around for about 30 years &amp; there&#039;s a lot known about them. Check out Erowid &amp; you&#039;ll see how much info there is. If you&#039;re interested in trying a psychedelic other than shrooms or LSD I&#039;d definitely go for 2C-B or one of the other widely used common RCs (2C-x, DMT, 5-Meo-DiPT, etc) rather than some of the newer ones.<br /><br />For your first time I&#039;d definitely go with one of the classic psychedelics though, shrooms may be best as for me my 1st LSD trip was a bit of a let down - expectations too high &amp; little effect. If you try shrooms don&#039;t expect to get far on 1g though 3.5g dried (P. Cubensis) is the standard for most peple I think.

				Don&#039;t eat an eighth of mushrooms your first time..&nbsp; I have grown mushrooms in the past, and 1 gram of those was more than enough for most people.&nbsp; My suggestion is, if you get shrooms from a reputable vendor..&nbsp; Get a half ounce, start with 800mg and see where that leads you.&nbsp; Sometimes, with psychedelics less is more.&nbsp; You can always step it up a bit more the next weekend or whatever if you feel that a gram or so didn&#039;t do the trick.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mushrooms can be very, very powerful and the high can get on top of you heavy if you don&#039;t expect it.
