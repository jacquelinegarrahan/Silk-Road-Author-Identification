				No, there is no danger in getting all that crap you described from &quot;moderate&quot; use of meth. If you get brain damaged or retarded from meth then you did a whole lot at once or have done it for a long time, and this isn&#039;t moderate use.<br /><br />I;ve seen some fools do some crazy amounts and not get brain damage. I mean, they aren&#039;t right after they do it, but they aren&#039;t retarded or brain damaged.

				I mean smoking is arguably the most addictive means of consuming meth. Perhaps oral consumption would allow for better moderation. Not much different than amphetamine scripts in low doses.

The meth amplifies all your feelings and emotions and you&#039;ll find yourself getting distracted and overthinking shit WAY too much.<br /><br />I see this happen to my friend all the time. Especially since he hides his use from his girlfriend. One phone call sends him into a panic because he doesn&#039;t know whether to answer it or not. He calms down by trying to smoke more. Not if I&#039;m there, I usually tell him he&#039;s done and to talk to her and just act NORMAL.<br /><br />Someone mentioned that you should be getting the proper amount of nutrition and again this&nbsp; cannot be stressed enough. For us girls the thought of losing a couple pounds really quick can be an appealing and tempting prospect, but in the end, you end up looking sucked in and not very sexy at all. Smoke, take vitamins, drink plenty of water (I prefer Naked juice or smoothies), eat fruit or small meals like sandwiches, exercise a little bit (sex is AMAZING), and just keep your use moderated to your weekend. <br /><br />Whether your weekend is in the middle of the week or Friday-Sun, just remember that your last day is your rest &amp; recovery day, this day is sacred. If you stop using JUST before your go to class or work and haven&#039;t gotten any rest, it WILL show.

				This is a first post for me, I read the forums all the time so I decided to join in.&nbsp; <br /><br />Remember, &quot;methamphetamine&quot; is nothing new.&nbsp; Its been around for many many years.&nbsp; JFK or maybe it was Robert Kennedy took injections.&nbsp; If you want to use meth safely, don&#039;t just jump in and start smoking it.&nbsp; Buy a .5 bag or whatever and crush it up to smitherines.&nbsp; The finer you grind it the better it will work.&nbsp; Weigh out a baby baby baby bump, say 10mg or so.&nbsp; Snort it.&nbsp; Its cool.&nbsp; You will like it.&nbsp; You can add to your dose after an hour or so and play it by ear.<br /><br />We started doing this about 4 months ago and no problems so far but have done the binges, up 36 hrs and stuff but that was by choice it was not like we took a heavy hit off the proverbial Dick and lit up for 3 days.&nbsp; hehe.....&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been around drugs my whole life and there is much worse shit out there than Meth.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meth is cool, meth is fun and safe when used correctly but as always.......&nbsp; R E S P E C T !!&nbsp; Tina gets a few people reeeaaaal bad.<br /><br />CB

				Someone please enlighten me about speed and meth.

Can you replicate the productivity you get on meth by upping your speed dosage?<br />Maximum efficiency with minimal effort is what I&#039;m all about.

They hired me and I did well enough that they fired the guy above me and gave me his job within two months. All the while I was using meth. I don&#039;t use meth all the time, but when I do I catch up on the backlog of work we generally have due to poor management/corporate disconnect. Once a month for about a week straight, my company sees a massive push and they&#039;re always happy with the results. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, meth is fucking hard to use responsibly.

				You really have to know your body.<br />Personally, I have a very high tolerance to any mental addiction. <br />Yes, I feel terrible and my body craves it, but my mind never does.. You just need to know your personal limits. <br />Just look at your normal everyday living, do you get &quot;addicted&quot; to things fast?

Scary and powerful shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Really? For me, even the word commercial/campaign has become synonymous with untrue. I suppose it wouldn&#039;t be propaganda if it didn&#039;t work on some level....<br /><br />Honest to god, I interviewed for the job I have now while on meth. They hired me and I did well enough that they fired the guy above me and gave me his job within two months. All the while I was using meth. I don&#039;t use meth all the time, but when I do I catch up on the backlog of work we generally have due to poor management/corporate disconnect. Once a month for about a week straight, my company sees a massive push and they&#039;re always happy with the results. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, meth is fucking hard to use responsibly. But if you can do it, everyone around you will appreciate your efforts and be none the wiser to your deep and criminal secret. <br /><br />This is a very educated statement.&nbsp; Meth is Meth like I said before.&nbsp; Remember, &quot;methamphetamine&quot; is indeed a legal drug prescribed in the USA under the brand name Desoxyn.&nbsp; Hard as hell to get a script but its out there.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as the guy looking to recreate the Limitless state of mind that brought a big big smile to my face cuz that movies kicks.&nbsp; &nbsp;The one thing you should take away from that movie that is very real is that what you learn or train yourself to do on most drugs you retain.&nbsp; Pull away the drug but it does not matter cuz the knowledge and even sometimes the personality shift is there to stay.&nbsp; Cool shit I guess unless you get stuck as you dont start experimenting with really stupid stuff like PCP.&nbsp; That is probably the only drug I would just not plain not ever fuck with, PCP.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

From an SR vendor?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, although the first time was from one of the very first vendors who started selling on SR about 6 months ago, so it&#039;s not a bad batch. There are a lot of people here who only post about positive experiences and how they&#039;re happy about getting their packages, the high quality of the drugs, and so on and so forth, and rarely does anyone posts about the bad experiences with undeniably good shit - the comedowns and hangovers. SR forums sometimes feel like giant drug-use advertisement, complete with happy customer testimonials, and since they&#039;re built around a marketplace, it&#039;s probably only natural.

				I know people who do meth occasionally. I can limit myself especially if I have other stuff on hand like weed or opiates. The last order I bought lasted me at least 3 weeks and it was only a gram. Less is more with stimulants. If I do big lines my tolerance goes up really fast, whereas if I only do a bump here and there I can keep doing about the same amount and get the same effects for a while.

				It&#039;s a cost-benefit analysis, a personal risk assessment on a number of fronts. Unfortunately the short answer is using meth even in moderation will result in neurotoxic damage; the 3 way serotonin/norepinephrine/dopamine glissade simply burns a bit too brightly, though under small doses of desoxyn in optimal conditions it will be negligible. The good news is a) It&#039;s not necessarily very much damage, b) there&#039;s every chance you can regenerate most or all of the damage, depending of course. A lot of it won&#039;t be perceptible, or will disappear in fairly short order given time and conditions. The complications, naturally, are manifold. Your own biology, reaction to the drug, self control and accompanying particulars all play a part. Some of the harm minimisation advice here is apt, but I would stress in particular the supposed importance of antioxidants in minimising cognitive stress (vitamin C and friends), and monitoring temperature (overheating is bad) fluid intake and so on. <br /><br />Responsible usage of less intensive stimulants/other potentially addictive substances beforehand is important, and knowing your own strengths and weaknesses. If you do decide to go down this route, make a plan and stick to it. Pay attention to dosages, consider how much you&#039;ll have on hand should you curve towards a bender, and having someone responsible hold onto the remainder &amp; keep you accountable to some degree: to many it will sound laughable or paranoid, but on cost benefit it&#039;s a pretty easy safeguard. You may not end up fiending terribly, or even liking it, but at the end of the day as people have said (albeit in a very polarised fashion) the real harm doesn&#039;t show up overnight or from a single cause. If some measure of risk and damage is consistent with your lifestyle and goals then you may well accept all of this. If so, I would urge you to stay smart and play it safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;
