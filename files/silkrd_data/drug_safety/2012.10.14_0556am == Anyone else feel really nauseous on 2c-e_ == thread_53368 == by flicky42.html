				Had my first experience with 20 mg of 2c-e today and holy fuck was it powerful. That was the strongest trip of my life the only problem was the unbearable stomach discomfort I had the entire time. How can I reduce that?<br /><br /><br />Also I really couldn&#039;t keep my thought straight either, I had some really special ones but they just kept getting lost. Nothing really beats LSD or Shrooms I guess.

				Can&#039;t say that I have, but I use zofran for drunk spins, nausea/vomiting.... it&#039;s really for cancer patients suffering from nausea but there are so few side effects I&#039;ll take 2 IM or 3 orally. also worked alright when I had a bad flu (gave myslef 1000cc of fluid too), I usually throw a couple extra in free if you order a few.... and what ever other free samples you want that&#039;ll fit in the box<br />It&#039;s pretty much side effect free but let me know what meds you&#039;re taking and I can check interactions

				I take a dramamine or 2 about 30 minutes before my trip.<br />Usually I take 1 before and if it&#039;s still bad then I take another.<br /><br />I have a friend that swears by promathizine AKA:Phengren. She says nothing else fights nasuea as well. However it makes a person quite tired and results in a dreamy, surreal trip.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that taking a bendryl will remove most of the body load, though I&#039;d think it would also create a woozy trip.<br /><br />Personally I find that with 2c-x chems if I feel like I&#039;m really gonna puke then I just go and do it. Once you&#039;ve puked you feel much better, it removes most all of the naseua.

				@Novartis thank you but I&#039;m going to explore cheaper more accessible medicine first before I look to SR.<br /><br />Ianfleming. Good advice but I&#039;m not sure if I want the drawbacks. I think I&#039;ll split my doses up and take an overall smaller amount next time to see how that goes.

				Yeah I&#039;ve puked off 2c-E before from snorting 6mg but after I puked it was one of the coolest trips I&#039;ve had from a OEV standpoint up there with a couple acid and 25i trips. I was throwing a light up frizbee on the beach at night and when my friends would throw the frizbee to me 7 other different neon colored frizbees would shoot out of it but I was still able to catch the real one, also all the sand was moving like it was water.

				Huh... I only got tracers and brighter-lights from 2c-e. And massive diarrhea. And a mind-state that constantly fucked with me. I wasn&#039;t a fan, personally. It turned me off psychedelics for the past year, actually.

				Yeah overall I really am not a fan of it and would never go out of my way to do it again when there are chemicals with less of a body load than 2c-E. And that burn is like nothing I&#039;ve ever experienced followed by my entire body feeling hot and nausea to the point of vomiting is never fun..

				I never had a problem with 2c-i, assuming the stuff I got long ago was 2c-i. I also never got visuals from it. That&#039;s the most I can really say in regards to it.
