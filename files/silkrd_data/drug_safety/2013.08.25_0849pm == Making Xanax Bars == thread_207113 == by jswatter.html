				So I&#039;m writing a story about a group drug smugglers. Currently in the story, I am working on a scene where the individuals involved are making xanax bars. So far, they have obtained a pill press, milligram scale, powder mixer, and alprazolam. I would like the story to continue by describing the actual process of making the bars. I am stumped and not sure where to go from here. What is the procedure to make the bars? Also, what binder is recommended for manufacturing such a pill? Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks

				look up youtube videos of people who have those little hand presses, they usually tell you the ratio of binder /color/substance needed. And probably point to popular manufactures of products used for this process.&nbsp; If you&#039;re infact writing a story i&#039;d love to read it!

				im surprised to not find much more talk about this on the boards but guess its not the place for it. <br /><br />maybe ask the guys that sell the xanax powder in bulk? they should have an idea. i was going to suggest lfa like mentioned but i think what they have will suit you better for x pills.<br /><br />google lfatablet they have a ready-mix which contains the binder and lubricant etc.<br /><br />do you have the xanax mould or die?

None of them knew and many were curious about manufacturing them. In one instance, a vendor was very rude about me asking.<br /><br />Secondly, yes, at this point in the story, the mould has already been obtained from China.

				ive been wondering this for a long time too, since its simple to get a press mg scale and raw powder, its uncommon to actually get to press it with the right binders and equip, i dont see many people do this but its definitley possible if you have the tools
