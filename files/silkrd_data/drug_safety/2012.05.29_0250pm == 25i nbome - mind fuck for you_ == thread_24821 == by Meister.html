				I had never taken, or heard of, 25i nbome before SR. Plenty of experience with other psychedelics but I got some of kwiktrips 25i nbome a couple weeks ago and my first trip (4x 550ug tabs) was great, I actually preferred it to LSD and until LSD prices come down I think I&#039;ll stick with 25i. However, everything I read about others experiences with 25i nbome was that they didn&#039;t have a mind fuck, I went into the trip thinking I wouldn&#039;t, and was wrong and had a very intense mind fuck early on in the trip.<br /><br />I thought perhaps it was because it was my first time with the drug, and my first times with LSD and shrooms were intense as well. This weekend I did another trip (4x 550ug tabs, another 2 tabs a couple hours into the trip) and it was a great experience, both visually and mentally, but I just don&#039;t see how anyone can say the mind fuck component isn&#039;t there as it&#039;s quite prevalent to me.<br /><br />Visually it was top notch, surpassed any LSD trip I ever had which is impressive, but mentally it was a roller coaster, each &#039;trip wave&#039; being either extremely calming and relaxed or overwhelming and anxiety causing. At one point I broke down into tears crying, probably the first time I&#039;ve cried in I don&#039;t know how many years.<br /><br />So I&#039;m curious if I&#039;m in the minority and 25i nbome is purely visual like many claim it to be, or if others have had mind fucks identical to LSD as well.

				Personally I&#039;ve only tried 2 tabs 1100mics 25i for kwiktrip with little mindfuck. While smoking cannabis. Amazing visuals,super connected with nature. <br /><br />When people say there is little mindfuck I think they refer to dosage around 1000 mics. Most people report mindfuck at larger dosages. In my experience there is alot of potential for mindfuck at larger dosages. <br /><br />Im looking for the PERFECT day to up the dosage., it will come.

				Personally I find that 25I does have a mindfuck aspect to it, but it&#039;s pretty betwixt and between. I found that when I was trying quite hard to focus on something, such as giving a friend directions to come hang out at a park, I just could not grasp the understanding of direction, how long a mile was, or street names. I knew what those concepts where, but just trying to explain them had me taking long pauses on the phone while I stood there, looking like a fool because all the pretty colors and patterns were so much more interesting than a phone conversation. It seems that 25I is mostly clear-headed, which is always a plus. Makes going for a bike ride so much easier.

				Yeah, I&#039;d say there&#039;s definately a mindfuck aspect to it. I can forget what I&#039;m doing 10 times while I&#039;m doing it. A little bit of jitteryness, but nothing I find annoying or anything compared to uppers. It also tends to make me kinda confused about general shit, even when I know exactly what&#039;s going on. I also tend to see demons/weird creatures (not frightening ones) on the walls staring at me, and music coming from nowhere. The vaccum cleaner also became a transdimensional being and gave me advice.<br /><br />My friend decided he wanted to put a blotter of 25i from SR in his eye and see how it worked. I told him I wouldn&#039;t recommend it since I didn&#039;t know too much about the actual chemical, but he&#039;s a grown-ass man and can make his own choices. He got higher than us sooner and came down quicker, and everything turned out fine, other than him complaining about a headache. I just figured out I&#039;d let people know that it won&#039;t make you go blind by taking it that way if you so choose.

I had so many visuals it was highly entertaining. I had all the color in the entire room wash upwards and out the window, lot&#039;s of &#039;melting&#039; visuals identical to what I see on good LSD trips.

I&#039;ve put a lot of stupid shit in my body, but somehow I trust my stomach more than my eyes. Feel very odd putting any chemical in my eye, let alone one I know very little of in his case.

				Why&#039;d you take 2200Âµg for your first time? That&#039;s such a waste if you ask me. :-\
