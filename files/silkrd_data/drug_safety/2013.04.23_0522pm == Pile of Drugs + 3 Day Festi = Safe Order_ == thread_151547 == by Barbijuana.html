Fear and Loathing style. Just say a prayer to the virgin mary you make it out with your life and sanity. <br /><br />lolol just messin.... I couldn&#039;t really speak to the schedule for all of them. I would definitely suggest you NOT take the acid or other psychs while on dexedrine. Speed + psychs can make for a disaster. It happened to me once and it was the worst trip of my life. Made me never want to nbome again. I&#039;ve heard of a handful of people who really enjoy speed/amp/other uppers with LSD/nbomes and the like; however, a majority of first hand accounts suggest otherwise. I would just leave the dexedrine out of the equation altogether (maybe save it for the trip back so you&#039;re not a zombie).

				id go with only doing the 25i lsd shrooms and mdma. <br />Normally when i rave at a 3 day rave ill roll 2 of the 3 (im irresponsible at festivals, but hey i dont roll oftern (:)<br />The first day ill do only lsd and smoke pot.<br />the next ill do mdma with shrooms<br />the last day ill throw down hard due to tolerence. Ill usually do mdma mda smoke, and newly added some k.<br /><br />Best part is,<br /><br />HAVING A FUCKING BLAST<br /><br />because all of my drugs except pot i do now-adays are off of the road and i never have to deal with whether or not itll work.<br /><br />Another tip, do the most forgiving/draining healthwise drugs the first day,<br />the slightly less forgiving/draining the second day,<br />and the least forgiving/draining the third day<br /><br />Best of luck to you this weekend and remember we are all there together.

				Day 1. <br /><br />25i, whatever your normal dose is. A single mg would do it for me but I don&#039;t do it often.<br />I would then use the Xanax that night, 25i keeps me up for hours and I would want to be well rested for the rest of the week.<br /><br />Day 2.<br /><br />Shrooms. These don&#039;t take much energy out of you so you should be good for the next day.<br /><br />Day 3.<br /><br />LSD + MDMA. You don&#039;t know how strong the LSD is, so you don&#039;t want to waste a day if it&#039;s a small hit. Just mix it with the MDMA and go hard for your last day. The MDMA will probably bring you down the next day so definitely save it for the third, plus you said the third day was the best.<br /><br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t touch the dexedrine during the week, just not exactly the type of thing I&#039;d want at a rave. It may come in handy for the drive home though if the MDMA takes too much outta ya.<br /><br />Good luck.

				I would look at a 3 day festival more like this.. <br /><br />Day 1.. Set up and get situated, meet people NIbble on a cheeba all day as you go..&nbsp; Maybe have some shrooms<br /><br />Day 2. Take the LSD ... Half way thru ( and after the peak period) Take the MDMA.... Half way thru (and after the peak) Take the 25I ... and follow up with the Shrooms ... Nibbling on the Cheeba all day and night again.. <br /><br />Day three, Well by this point I would guess you are at least half way thru it. LOL.. eat the Cheeba all day again and enjoy the shrooms.. <br /><br />Save the Xanax for the way home (if you are not driving) or once you get home and sleep it off! <br /><br />

				Thanks for the responses +1 to all <br /><br />I really wish I would of read that tip about the Dexedrine... Lol<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it went and where I fucked up. I&#039;ve ate edibles before and was convinced they either A, didn&#039;t affect me or B, were pussy shit:<br /><br />Day 1: <br />11am: 20mg Dex (Mistake)<br />4pm: 1/8 of DecaDose Cheeba 218.75mg THC (Good Move)<br />5pm: 1/2 of DecaDose Cheeba 875mg THC (Big Mistake)<br />6pm: 1.5G Mushrooms (Relative Mistake)<br />7pm: Edible kicks in, Mushroom kicks in, Comedown on Dex kicks in (Shit)<br /><br />Very rapid heart palpitations, muscle tensions, unable to urinate, sweating profusely, anxiety, nervousness, extreme paranoia, auditory hallucinations. I was seeing people turn and watch me which increased the paranoia which increased the sweating which increased the anxiety which caused people to actually start watching me. Very vicious cycle, but was fully aware of it and yet could not stop it. My biggest fear and some of the auditory hallucinations was that after all the Boston Bombing news; I looked like a very suspicious character at this public event. Not to mention I had to piss so badly, but didn&#039;t want anyone to think I was planting the bomb in the urinals so I held it (3 beers, 5 waters held it)<br /><br />9pm: Proceed to load bowl after bowl and take the most monster tokes able until brain becomes absent of thoughts. In turn, this saved my night/life/festival exp - Thank you MJ &lt;3<br />1am: Xanax to reset<br /><br />Day 2:<br />4pm: 1/8 Cheeba Chew (Good move)<br />6pm: 180mg MDMA (Feels Good move)<br /><br />Wanted to save roll for Sunday so I didn&#039;t have to Tuesday Blues whilst there, but also wanted a therapy session to save the experience - It did, just as molly always does, and made it the best place in the world at the cost of a serotonin crash the next day.<br /><br />Day 3:<br />6pm: 4g Mushrooms + Weed <br />8pm: 2g Mushrooms<br /><br />Felt the full brunt of the MnextdayMA compounded with the focus of your body that psychedelics can do. Didn&#039;t care - ate enough where the visuals and music appreciation dominated the bodily focus. <br /><br />Kept the 25i and LSD for later - Still have 1 Cheeba and few grams of Mushies left. <br /><br />--------<br /><br />Will work on a better order for next time, definitely with no fucking Dexedrine nor the gram of THC orally (shit ain&#039;t no joke)<br />
