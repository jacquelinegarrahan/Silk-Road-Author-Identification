				okay lately i have started to get a weak stomach.&nbsp; it used to be strong, and still is for opiates.&nbsp; but seratonigenic substances (4-FA 4-MEC and MDMA) seem to make me gag thinking about them, taking them, and finally when the effect comes on i have been getting sick.&nbsp; i have some awesome molly from two sources here and a special day is coming up and i want a good roll without losing my goodness.&nbsp; i also want to be able to redose properly at the peak (whem my tummy is at the worst)<br /><br />any secrets to keeping the tummy happy with MDMA?&nbsp; i am going to be at home and can use any remedies safely.&nbsp; i&#039;ve tried capsules and liquid suspension but got sick both times.&nbsp; had empty stomach, just dry ick.<br /><br />*destiny*

				I got really sick once on MDMA, and the thought of it would make me sick to my stomach. I dont know your preference on weed, but I found smoking some before I dropped eliminated all my nausea. Plus I think weed compliments just about any drug.

I try to eat Tums between 5-45 minutes before taking the MDMA. But even then, I almost always throw up. This generally isn&#039;t a problem as long as you aren&#039;t throwing up immediately and wasting drugs. <br /><br />However, I have also found that this is likely because of taking MDMA on an empty stomach (which is best for absorption purposes), but perhaps it wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea to have a small, light meal about an hour or two before dropping to test out how your stomach deals with it when it is full. <br /><br /><br />

				thanks everyone!&nbsp; i do smoke, but i usually limit it for the tail end of the roll..&nbsp; but i may take a hit beforehand to help calm my stomach.&nbsp; it shouldn&#039;t interfere too much with the roll?<br />and tums is something i have never thought of.&nbsp; i know tums can decrease elimination of amphetamines so maybe it also will do the same with MDMA?&nbsp; would be a happy bonus if it make my stomach better and extended the roll by a few minutes.<br /><br />i&#039;ll report how well it works.&nbsp; i may eat a piece of fruit or a salad beforehand too.&nbsp; no harm in trying it all.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />*destiny*

				Snort it like cocaine. Nobody here eats MDMA they snort lines at danceclubs<br />Instant effects, you can control dosage better, good MDMA won&#039;t burn your nose.. many benefits unless you are a heavy user.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d like to also emphasize eating before dropping. Not directly before, and only a small meal, but the odds of you puking after dropping is a lot bigger if there&#039;s nothing else in your stomach. This coming from someone in your position- I get nauseous just thinking of parachuting that foul powder/crystal.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17075.msg170559#msg170559">Quote from: mdmamail on March 31, 2012, 04:37 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Snort it like cocaine.

You must be joking. Eating MDMA makes it last for a whole lot longer than snorting. Unless you need to ROLLRIGHTNOW, you really should think about swallowing it.<br />

You don&#039;t get as much out of it as you do if you consume orally (parachute is best IMO). Sure, it hits you fast and hard... but it does not last nearly half as long. And I beg to differ, I&#039;ve had pure MDMA that burned the SHIT out of my nose and I would never snort it again. <br /><br />Another way to avoid nausea if you&#039;re up to it is plugging.. haha, friends of mine have never gone back to oral or nasal administration since they tried plugging.

				Eat a light meal before rolling. I&#039;ve been told that helps ease the nausea. But if I consistently got nauseous each time, I&#039;d probably just say fuck it and get it over with instead of fighting it. Trying not to puke is way less fun than puking and rallying.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17075.msg170559#msg170559">Quote from: mdmamail on March 31, 2012, 04:37 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Snort it like cocaine.

Whether you&#039;re weighing out a dose to snort or parachute or plug, you&#039;re still just figuring out the right amount of molly. People who measure molly in lines or caps piss me off, because nobody&#039;s lines are the same and most street dealers would jump at the chance to screw you with light caps. <br /><br />That said, I personally love snorting this shit. It burns, yeah, and there&#039;s a drip, but it&#039;s not much more bitter than some good ole black coffee. I&#039;m starting to think I just have some sort of nasal fixation, like smokers do orally, but who cares. It&#039;s fun to do and gets me blitzed. I like the rush more. i&#039;ll never crush one of these speakers though or any other good ecstasy pill.

				I used to get this like the plague but yeah I found tums. I also think that making sure your stomach is empty helps personally. For example if I was going to a rave I would have a salad maybe 4-6 hours before I was about to drop. Staying on the Volvics helps too. If you can&#039;t get Tums then maybe Alcasaltza? :)
