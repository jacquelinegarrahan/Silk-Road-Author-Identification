				So yeah as the title says, I have no idea how many moles are in the solution as it only states it&#039;s &#039;99.9% GBL&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;m speaking of jennifers GBL which I intend on converting to GHB.<br /><br />No prob calculating conc. for NaOH, and of course I have the Mw of GBL :P but &#039;99.9% GBL&#039; in solution doesn&#039;t tell me much about it&#039;s concentration.&nbsp; Any clues?&nbsp; Or just keep adding GBL to NaOH until pH is 8.0? (that&#039;s dirty chemistry though lol)

				99.9% means 99.9g of GBL in 100ml of solution (you can figure out the molarity from this information but it&#039;s not required)<br /><br />You know that the number of moles of GBL is going to equal the number of moles of final GHB<br /><br />n(GBL)=n(GHB)=n(NaOH)&nbsp; (one to one to one ratio)<br /><br />Using the MW<br />86.089g of GBL will make 104.1g of GHB (requires 40g of NaOH)<br /><br />If you do some cross-multiplying, you can figure out the quantities of anything you wish

				Hrm, the first line is all I needed (I know chemistry, just having a brain fart, or rather a brain diarrhea)<br /><br />Are you sure that the % yield in solution = mass of GBL?&nbsp; You&#039;re saying 200mL would have 199.8g of GBL?&nbsp; <br />Dunno why but this seems very odd to me, but then again like I said i&#039;m having a brain diarrhea shitstorm atm :P<br /><br />Thanks for advice though, and not berating me by telling me step by step how to do high school chemistry haha.&nbsp; I&#039;m a trained biochemist whose currently just being an extreme idiot and i&#039;ve been outta my field for quite some time.&nbsp; I&#039;m used to my solutions being depicted in molarity (mol/L) which makes it .. obviously much simpler to determine the # of moles :D<br /><br />PS: Yes I know that 199.8g of GBL is 2.32mol and that the reaction is equimolar, aka 92.79g of NaOH (Mw = 39.997) is needed.&nbsp; Damn I feel like an idiot lol, just still tryin to get over &#039;99.9%&#039; = 99.9g ... in ... 100ml ... not 1L?

				@yasusta<br />To get weight of GBL in a solution you need to include density of GBL in your calculations.<br /><br />@DigitalDream<br /><br />Calculate weight of GBL in a certain volume, use the equation below and you&#039;ll get molarity of the said volume.<br /><br />grams of GBL/molar mass of GBL = x mol<br /><br />

				amount * density<br /><br />100 ml * 1.1286 g/ml = 112,86 g<br /><br />or use 99.9 ml (99.9 ml in 99% v/v solution) to get 112,75 g

				I guess I could also try not being an idiot (and doing exactly what you said)<br /><br />GBL has a density of 1.1286 g/mL&nbsp; &nbsp;... so 1.1286 g/mL * 200mL = 225.72g<br /><br />Thus 225.72g / 86.089g/mol = 2.62 moles<br /><br />Yay for being stupid lol !<br /><br />... and yeah, you beat me to it lol, thanks !<br /><br />May as well for posterity sake finish .... Mw NaOH = 39.9971g/mol&nbsp; <br /><br />39.9971g/mol * 2.62 mol = 104.869g of NaOH !<br /><br />------<br /><br />*drool* 330.35g NaGHB assuming 100% yield (which won&#039;t happen, but still 330g !)

				Something if quoted in % it normally refers to the solute and solution state at room temperature.<br /><br />eg.(which a biochemist like urself would be more than familiar with :D) <br />0.9% saline solution = 0.9GRAMS NaCl in 100ml of water<br />5% dextrose solution = 5grams of glucose in 100ml of water<br />20% olive oil in cream = 20ML of of olive oil in 100GRAMS of cream<br /><br />Since both water and GBL are liquid at room temperature, i am more inclined to now believe that it is 99.9ml of GBL in 100ml of total solution.<br />So yeah you do need density ;D<br /><br />I just also like you to keep in mind that most densities are quoted for 100% pure substances, as more impurities are added, the densities change. In this case the solution is so close to 100% you can use the quoted density, but it will make a difference when you deviate from purity (eg a 70% solution)

				Usually a reference like 99 or 99.9% indicates that you are purchasing the pure chemical, apart from 1 or 0.1% impurities or solvents that remain in the product. You can safely do your calculations based on either mass or volume/density with known values. <br /><br />If you are considering reacting it to GHB, just consider it to be 100% GHL to begin with. You will need to neutralize the end product anyway, at which point you can compensate fore any excess reagent prseent. <br />&nbsp;

				You are correct in how you found moles GBL but if I&#039;m not mistaken you mentioned that you are titrated with NaOH? I don&#039;t know the molecule of GBL but you need to factor in how many protons you plan on titrating. If the number is 1 than yes all you need is a 1:1 ratio of NaOH to GBL but if its more than you have more calculations to do.
