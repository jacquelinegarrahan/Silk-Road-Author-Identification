				I tried 25i-NBOME for the first time today, thought I&#039;d share my experience. Call it trip report if you like, it&#039;s just what happened.<br /><br />Body weight - 220lbs.<br />Not eaten all day.<br />No other drugs in system. <br /><br /><br />16:00 - Popped a 1000ug blotter on my tongue. Held it against the roof of my mouth for about 35 minutes, resisted the temptation to swallow any saliva during this time. Eventually washed it all down with water. <br />Almost immediately after putting it on my tongue I noticed a numbing sensation. This gradually spread to my lips, and remained there throughout the whole experience. It wasn&#039;t unpleasant, but it did make smoking cigarettes a bit of a drama. <br /><br />16:35 - The onset of this drug took me by surprise and was a bit of a shock. <br />I suddenly became incredibly anxious. Clammy hands, and some really painful cramps in my hands and wrists. My fingers felt clenched and twisted.<br />I realised I was starting to lose the plot a bit so I put on some music. It took me a good 10 minutes to sort my head out.<br /><br />16:40 - Now starting to relax and enjoy it. I could definitely feel a stimulant effect and some euphoria, as I stood up to get a cigarette I noticed that I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Kinda like being drunk. Wasn&#039;t a fan of this. <br /><br />17:00 - Standing up, my legs seemed very far away but too short at the same time. A very odd sensation, similar to what you might see in a Fun House mirror. Walking wasn&#039;t really an issue, that is to say I wasn&#039;t at risk of falling, but if someone saw me they would definitely think I had issues. lol<br />Other changes in my visual scope manefested themselves in the form of a near-crippling, inability to judge perspective. Kept putting my cigarette in my eye, pressing the wrong buttons on a remote, etc..&nbsp; <br /><br />18:00 - Around about this time I noticed that surfaces around me had started to breathe. I also started to notice some &quot;fluttering&quot; around my peripheral vision. Imagine someone a long way off has a strobe light, and you can just make it out in the corner of your eye. This is what it felt like. <br /><br />19:00 - At this point I was bored. The stimulant effect was still very much present, and now I started to feel some cramps in my neck. Again, quite painful. I think I may have been clenching my muscles without realizing it. The visuals were still present, but now I could see the same strobe effect with closed eyes. <br /><br />19:30 - Over about half an hour the visuals seemed to rise to their peak. Slight swirly patterns with closed eyes, colorful and quite enjoyable. Surfaces are still breathing, but now they seemed to be sort of twitching. Like the way a person&#039;s chest moves when they cough.<br /><br />20:00 - At about this time I could feel the drug winding down. The stimulant effect had diminished considerably. Walking was no longer a drunkard&#039;s outing, and the closed eye visuals had stopped.<br /><br />20:45 - Seemed like it was all over. I had a really dry mouth, and my neck &amp; wrists ached like a bastard. Hunger descended and a made some toast.<br /><br />00:14 - Logged into SR Forums and wrote this.<br /><br /><br />_______ <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure what to make of this tbh. I didn&#039;t do myself any favours by almost freaking out at the start, but I&#039;ll chalk that up to experience. <br /><br />I *was* hoping for some more interesting visuals. <br />But as it stands, I&#039;ve experienced the same hallucinations from simple sleep deprivation. <br /><br />I think next time I will take 2000ug and see what occurs. <br /><br />Summary?&nbsp; Disappointed, but still got x5 1000ug blotters left. Will try again. <br /><br />

				It certainly gets MUCH more interesting as you up the dosage, assuming you don&#039;t have a tolerance.<br /><br />I do recommend staying very well hydrated before and throughout the experience. Also, don&#039;t be afraid to take a few cold showers during the trip, it will significantly increase your body temperature.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a post trip report of when I did 6 tabs if 25i with no tolerance (I don&#039;t really recommend this to anyone; it can get potentially very dangerous, and the neighbors may be calling the cops if they can hear the noises you&#039;ll be making):<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36654.msg728108#msg728108

				for most psychedelics, i like to watch some kind of nature film or visual movie during come-up as it alleviates the anxiety. also, taking chelated magnesium about an hour beforehand helps prevent muscle tension. <br /><br />next time you might try putting the tab above your front teeth (tucked between the gum and cheek), it&#039;s a bit more comfortable and you wont have to taste it so much.

				sitting at home while on psychedelics should be your last option!!!<br /><br />enjoy nature!! <br /><br />i&#039;ve tried 25i and its more of a bodyload euphoric feeling.. not bad for partying though..<br />but if you want to have psychedelic expiriences stick with lsd,meskalin,shrooms

				Why do people bother with NBOMe compounds? they are incredibly dull psychedelics, may be good for a first time tripper but that&#039;s it, ive done 25c and that was pretty boring, but at least didn&#039;t have any sort of camps or muscle soreness or any other negative effects that 25i has, if you are adamant about trying an NBOMe, then do 25c, 25i seems really sketchy and most of the deaths/complications by the NBOMes have been caused by 25i, but i think to be safe they should all just be avoided.

That&#039;s what happens when stupid 17 year old snort 0.2-3 grams of a drug that should be consumed in quantities 400 times smaller. <br />On the other hand, I tried this recently (1200ug Tyler tab) as a neophyte and I must say that I agree with your assessment of its quality. Side effects outweigh the benefits: tremors throughout the trip, severe loss of mental faculties (I estimate my IQ dropped by 40-50 points), increased anxiety, inability to communicate verbally, loss of balance, poor concentration, poor memory, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />To OP: a 2milligram dose is considered excessive by everyone who has an opinion on this drug. Taking more of the drug will only increase negative side-effects, even if you do get more visuals in return.&nbsp;

And frankly, the opinion stated above seems to have a very uneducated/inexperienced basis to it.<br /><br />NBOMe is certainly not dull or boring (assuming you don&#039;t have any psychedelic tolerance or are on any meds that prevent it from working) and negative side effects are most typically experienced only at large doses.<br /><br />I personally enjoy NBOMe&#039;s very much, and would encourage anyone who is interested in them to responsibly see what they have to offer firsthand.
