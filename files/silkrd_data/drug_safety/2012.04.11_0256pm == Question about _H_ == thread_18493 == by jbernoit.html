				So I have a moderate opiate tolerance and can handle a decent amount of OC and dilly etc... Whenever I do these types of opiates I snort them and find that they really give me the munchies. Anyone else experience this? Tonight I&#039;ll be trying H for the first time and I plan on snorting it. I&#039;ve done all the research about taking it slow and starting off with match-head size bumps but I&#039;ve heard that most people get nausea and/or vomit. Given that I usually get the munchies from other opiates, can I expect the same from H?

				ime if you have a decent tolerance to other strong opiates as you say then you shouldnt really get too much nausea unless you are just prone to it every time. H isnt too special (dont get me wrong I am addicted so kinda love it partly... and with the price of oxy I wont go back now, but i started with the old school then on to roxy then to the powder also just snorting) but its really just efficient (lipid soluble) morphine quickly passing through a monoacetylated stage if you are snorting it. idk necessarily cause it really is pretty different than oxy but neither give me any nausea if i do the right amount, unlike hydromorphone which always made me feel a little woozy and wasnt my favorite. <br />i always smoke some nice herb too but depending on the dosage i will either get the munchies like crazy, generally with lower doses, but at higher doses I find myself not even really thinking about eating anything but cravings for sweets and have no motivation to cook or anything. I used to snort oxy to just help get my appetite up before meals in the past though actually thinking about it more and cant tell if I still do that, cause without the opiates now i will just be sick and not really want to eat for sure. <br /><br />if you do enough H though you will wake up with you face nearly in your food :) so even if you have the munchies cooking is definitely not a good idea if it has the potential to catch on fire or something if neglected... <br /><br />be safe, <br />- miR

				Thanks for the info. I tried it last night and it was pretty decent but I didn&#039;t get that H rush or warmth that I hear so much about. Is it because I snorted rather than IV?<br />Also, does H kill your memory like drinking does? I got up this morning and realized that a few of my OCs were missing. I&#039;m wondering if I snorted them and have no memory of it... does that type of memory loss happen with H?

				Hey,<br />New guy to the SR here (and Im in LOVE!!). definitely keep this little jem to myself. I&#039;m excited to place my first order, just figuring out the whole BC thing.<br /><br />Anyways, I guess id have to say yeah i have. I&#039;m pretty sure that means i did way too much. But i woke up in a strange place and everything.<br />A blackout (or as i like to call them &quot;Time Travel&quot;) I think are a pretty good sign your pushing your tolerance limits. I&#039;m a daily consumer of the wonderful white, or brown grains, but on the weekends sometimes i like to do some coke maybe have some drinks. I&#039;m sure they all play a vital roll in how my evening progresses.<br />about the puking. I think it just has to do with the way your body is chemically wired. I have a couple buddies that puke every single time, no matter the dosage. Myself, I&#039;ve never puked (unless i don&#039;t have any, then i get a bit pukey&nbsp; :P ) Getting sick sucks! <br />Hope this helps.<br />And yeah, I get the munchies like crazy! Peanut butter and jelly straight out the jar Brother!!

				I&#039;ve used Oxy and Methadone for pain (and recreationally) on and off now for quite a while. <br /><br />I just tried H recently (snorted it) and I&#039;ve gotta say I wasn&#039;t too impressed at all. I personally like the amazing motivation/feeling excited about life/thinking everything is awesome feeling I get from Oxy and &#039;done... <br /><br />H made me really damn tired.. Felt kinda warm and fuzzy, but couldn&#039;t think propery - all I wanted to do was sleep. I didn&#039;t get sick though.<br /><br />I certainly won&#039;t be going back to it anytime soon. Not my kinda thing. <br /><br />Man - I reckon that&#039;s so strange you get the munchies from opioids! Does anyone else out there get that? I could not eat all day after a few...

				jbernoit to answer your question the &quot;rush&quot; only comes from IV&#039;ing H.&nbsp; Give it about 8-12 seconds from when you inject till pure euphoria comes.&nbsp; I have snorted and smoked H but nothing compares to the IV.&nbsp; That being said I highly recommend you not do it.&nbsp; Once I injected it seems all other methods of administration are inferior.&nbsp; It, to me, is way more addictive than snorting or smoking.<br /><br />You can add other drugs to the mix to make it even more euphoric, especially cocaine, or ingest simple things like grapefruit juice or tagament to make the high last longer.&nbsp; The last two work with snorting, however if you ingest your opiates there is a chance the acidity of the grapfruit juice may breakdown the opiate and actually reduce the high.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yes, I get the munchies, usually sweets, like a motherfucker!!

				When I first started using Heroin I would get the munchies like crazy. I would order a large pizza, get high, eat like half of it, projectile vommit, get high again, smash that other half pizza, then probably puke that out as well. I would eat like mad all day and still lost 30 pounds my first year on H.

				Not usually...it&#039;s more an appetite suppresant, to me...can eat if I want to, but don&#039;t feel the &#039;need.&#039;&nbsp; What I will say, that used to happen a lot, is that if I do too much, I can&#039;t swallow on &#039;automatically&#039;, it can be hard to swallow, and easy to choke on food.&nbsp;

				I am kinda weird when it comes to H and my appetite. If I haven&#039;t eaten all day, and I do a shot, I lose any hunger I had going on. However, if I do come across food while I&#039;m high, like dinner is on a table in front of me, I scarf a lot of food down. I think for me it&#039;s just that satiated feeling of a full stomach on top of the dope nod -- its that extra dopamine release I guess. When I come home at night I like to do my evening shot and smoke a bowl to get my appetite going, then I eat my dinner. Most nights after dinner I nod out on my porch smoking the post-meal cigarette. I&#039;ve burned holes in many pairs of pants that way.

I asked on the forum if I could use a meth pipe instead of having to use tin foil - everyone said No to the meth pipe, but later I got a bunch of PM&#039;s saying they smoke #3 H all the time with a meth pipe and went on to explain what I need to do in order to get it to run v sitting in one spot and burning,<br /><br />might I suggest you give tony76 a try? he sells in small amounts -1/4 grams (.25g), so you will not have to buy more that you need to get a good taste and that should be enough to get you high and more than likely (depending on tolerance) get you on the nod. I find his &quot;regular&quot; H - not the pebbles - to be great quality product at a fair price. I only snort and I can nod very easily with his gear, or just keep a nice steady buzz/high chipping throughout the day.<br /><br />sickboy - good to see you back.<br /><br />I lost between 20-25 pounds the first two or three months I started snorting H (when I first started here at SR with Aphex, nucleo and tony76)&nbsp; - and when I am off the gear, I gain it all back...

				Thanks for the info everyone.<br />I had a great H purchasing experience with the vendor from SR, much faster delivery than I expected and it was packaged very well.<br />I snorted a half gram over the span of 2 days and it was ok. I definetly didn&#039;t get the rush I was hoping for but I won&#039;t be IVing any time soon. It really just felt like OC. I doubt I&#039;ll rush to do it again.
