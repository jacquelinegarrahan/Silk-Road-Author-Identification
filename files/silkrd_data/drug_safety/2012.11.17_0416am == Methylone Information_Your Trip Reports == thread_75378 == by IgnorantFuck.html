				I&#039;ve purchased and used methylone from SR previously, so the dosage and effects I somewhat understand. I just have a few questions/things I&#039;d like clarified from anyone with sufficient experience with the drug, and I&#039;d love to hear trip reports from you guys.<br /><br />First and foremost, I&#039;m trying to get some more for special holidays and such with my girlfriend. Will the methylone&#039;s potency ever expire? and if so, how quickly will it expire and how should I store it? Given I&#039;ll be saving it for holidays, I can only hope it will last at least several months.<br /><br />Another thing I&#039;d like to ask is about the dosage. I previously used 150 mg to start, and then bumped it with 100mg as it was ending (both taken orally). It was an awesome trip, but I&#039;m just curious if any of you have a better recommended dosage/method of ingestion?<br /><br />What is the likelihood of an overdose, and how much is needed to cross that line?<br /><br /><br />I would also LOVE trip reports that you guys could give me.<br /><br />I should also mention that while I&#039;m posting here, I&#039;m also reading up on erowid. I just prefer forum posts because I can&#039;t ask an internet webpage a question.

				I love MDMA, but MDMA is something that should only be used so often.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that methylone can be used more frequently without building up tolerance as easily so I&#039;m interested in it but haven&#039;t yet tried.<br /><br />As for storing methylone for the holidays, aren&#039;t the holidays upon us?&nbsp; Regardless it should store fine for several months in a cool dark dry place.

				I had a lot of fun with methylone. I gave it up because I was getting depression symptoms for almost a week after every roll, but that was after a period of weekly use. My wife and I had a lot of long, really powerful talks on M1. I think it really strengthened our marriage and helped both of us talk about things we&#039;d never really been able to before. It also makes just about everything fun. One of the best times I ever had on it was just getting caught up on housework and listening to music.<br /><br />You want to keep it away from light and most especially moisture. It can be stored in solution for a little while, but it will breakdown and oxidize (ends up looking like piss). I kept 10gs for about six months without noticeable potency loss. I kept it in in a baggie inside of blacked-out mason jar. If you&#039;re thinking longer term you might want to invest in some amber vials.<br /><br />Re: dosage, waiting until the comedown to redose is a waste in my experience. I usually took a bump (about 50% of original dose) right after the plateau. It&#039;s tricky, since M1 comes and goes in waves. M1 is pretty forgiving compared to harder drugs, but it can get unpleasant if you take too much (brux
