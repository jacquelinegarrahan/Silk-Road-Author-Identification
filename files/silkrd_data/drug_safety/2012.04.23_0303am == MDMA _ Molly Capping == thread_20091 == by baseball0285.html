				Hey, wanted to know if anyone had any tips on capping molly,<br />trying to get them into like size 4 caps, those seem to weigh out around .1 to .12 per capsule<br />wanted to know if anyone had any tips on capping them?<br />seems tedious as hell doing them by hand

				My girlfriend is a total pro at that, like Breaking Bad levels of getting them in capsules. What she usually does is weighs out the powder/crystal on a very thin piece of tissue paper as close to the corner as possible. Then I hold the capsule for her and she just kind of flips the corner over, carefully letting the powder into the capsule. I don&#039;t know, I guess it is pretty tedious. I can&#039;t imagine having to do that for a lot of capsules at once since we usually only do it for personal use. Hopefully you can find an easier way!

				it&#039;s just a bitch dude. best way ive found is making a 2 line assembly line.<br /><br />You need an area where the two man team is working. We used this big glass mirror that I have and set it up on my kitchen table. One person is working with pouring molly into capsules while the other is weighing out the powder. We used two notecard pieces of paper creased in half. we made sure the two notecards weighed exactly the same, that way you don&#039;t have to keep hitting tare between each weigh. So u scoop into the pile with the first notecard, and get the 100mg on there. Then, you hand that carefully to your partner, who begins putting it into the capsule. As soon as you hand it off, you grab the other notecard and begin to weigh out the next 100mg.<br /><br />The glass mirror was great cause if there were any spills in handing off or scooping with the notecards, excess powder just falls on the glass and can be pushed back into the main pile. Whoever is doing the capping should always knock loose molly back onto the glass since their job is going to be slightly faster.<br /><br />There&#039;s another thread on this that I&#039;ve seen. It&#039;s pretty long and idk if anyone has listed a better method there but I&#039;d search for it.

				Use a spoon(drop measurement) it fits inside a cap. Internet edit- http://www.amazon.com/Dash-Smidgen-Pinch-Measuring-Spoon/dp/B002X9I4RC<br />It does not take long to get your eye in with exact weight on the spoon.<br /><br />BTW caps are pricks. Depending on brand, they can have different weights from one cap to the next from the same batch. I have had some caps with a difference of 40mg from the same batch.<br /><br />So weighing each cap before filling and spooning exact weight makes my rectum pucker up every time I have to do it. <br /><br />If I lived in the US I would be buying a hand held press via evilbay..$150?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Herbal Vitamin Press Pill Press Tablet press Pill Maker.....&quot;makes a pill every 30 sec&quot;&nbsp; ;D

Awesome for herb/ fungi(it doesnt matter if you are out 100/200mg). Not so awesome for powders because of the weights you are trying to achieve capping MDMA.

				My personal way of doing this is really simple but relatively effective. <br />Take some printer paper and cut a piece of it and fold it into a funnel and tape is so it won&#039;t open up. Make the funnel so that it fits the gel cap half tightly.<br /><br />Then get your scale ready and weigh your &quot;goodies&quot; on top of a piece of paper. <br /><br />Pour desired amount through the funnel into the cap.<br /><br />iherb.com is really good for getting cheap empty gel caps. Try to avoid vegetarian ones, as they dissolve veeeeery slow in your stomach resulting in slower MDMA release. I always go with animal gelatin caps.<br />But yea, just type gelcaps in the search in iherb and select &quot;sort by&quot; &quot;cheapest first&quot; or something<br />500x 0-size caps are like 9 dollars... I recommend ordering some heavy duty b-vitamin complex tabs also along with 5-htp. Now Foods is a good brand and also cheap.

				Yeah, it&#039;s pretty tedious. <br />Selling molly i&#039;ve capped up hundreds of tenths over the years<br /><br />My scale has a little tray thing, so i&#039;ll weigh out the 100mg, put it in the middle of card or dollar bill, fold it in half and pour into a capsule.<br /><br />If i have a lot to cap up I&#039;ll usually recruit a friend to help.

				I would use a device to hold one half of the cap upside down so the opening is on the top. Then, weigh your mg amount on the scale. From the scale, pour the powder onto a piece of crisp printer paper folded in half (baking the paper at low temps, 200*F, can dry the paper making it less susceptible to the power sticking). Then use both hands, lightly tap the paper as the powder flows into the cap, then remove the cap and add the other half. <br /><br /><br />Pretty tedious, but can work when doing relatively small amounts &lt;50 or so.

				What&#039;s everyone&#039;s opinion of capping powdered MDMA/MDA vs in original form including small/larger crystals?<br /><br />Logically the capped crystals would take longer to dissolve, absorb and hit you, however I would think that given the strength of our stomach&#039;s digestive juices coupled together with MD&#039;s high water solubility, the difference would be minimal - if any..

				I always cap by hand but then again I cap maybe a dozen or so at a time so it&#039;s not much.<br /><br />I weigh my cap first and level off the scale then scoop up some powder with the cap and weigh the cap again to see where it&#039;s at + repeat if needed.
