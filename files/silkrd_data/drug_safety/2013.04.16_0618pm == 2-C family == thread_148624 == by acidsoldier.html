				Hi! <br />My friend have a question connected with his party plans and I will be grateful, if you help me with that. He&#039;s on a break right now and he&#039;s tolerance is zero.<br />1. He&#039;s planning to drop about 25mg of 2C-I on following friday and then on next friday about 25mg of 2C-B. Will there be any problem with that and is there any possibilty that he will feel this second dropping any lighter than standard one?<br />2. After dropping this 25mg of 2C-B he&#039;s thinking of adding 150-200mg of MDMA. Will there be any problem with order (MDMA after 2C-B) and if not, is the dose of MDMA right?<br /><br />I&#039;m giving +1 for anyone who will help me! Thanks and all the best! much love bro,<br /><br />acidsoldier

				A week should be a good amount of time for physical tolerance to get back to baseline (or close enough it won&#039;t be noticed).&nbsp; Psychological tolerance is another factor though and depends completely on the person.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never taken 2c-b before MDMA but I&#039;ve heard that 2c-b AFTER MDMA is supposed to be really nice.&nbsp; Generally speaking I like to take my psychs on the comedown of MDMA rather than vice versa.&nbsp; The Ecstasy afterglow really cuts the anxiety out of the trip for me.&nbsp; But I think doing it in reverse could be okay too.&nbsp; &nbsp;As to the dose of MDMA 200mg is pretty high unless your friend has a tolerance.&nbsp; Another option would be to go 150 with a 50mg booster an hour and half after you drop the first one.&nbsp; But I think between 2c-b and MDMA a booster dose might be a bit much.<br /><br />Good luck to you guys, hope you have a blast :)
