				I&#039;m a regular mdma user... I typically wait a month to roll, but occasionally longer or shorter.<br /><br />I realise there&#039;s a massive depletion of serotonin which is one main reason to wait a period for it restore.<br /><br />However amphetamines or mephedrone don&#039;t deplete serotonin, they drain dopamine. And to my knowledge dopamine doesn&#039;t take very long to restore.<br /><br />If I&#039;m correct, does this mean theoretically I could use mephedrone a lot more (weekly, fortnightly)? could I use mephedrone in between mdma usage because the discrepancy gives chance for serotonin to be built up again?<br /><br />Any informed input will be appreciated.<br /><br />thanks guys.

Wouldn&#039;t really recommend<br /><br /><br />I myself did it sometimes 3 times a week while it was legal. Though i&#039;d say its still good to take a couple weeks off after a session.<br /><br />Im not 100% sure but I feel about right a month after a session. might just be me though, but I have a very healthy lifestyle

				http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12727693<br /><br />&quot;RESULTS:<br /><br />A 25%-30% decrease in the maximal extent of dopamine stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity was seen in the striatum (nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen) of the methamphetamine users. No changes were found in basal or guanylyl-imidodiphosphate-stimulated enzyme activity.&quot;<br /><br />Not sure how similar mephedrone is in relation to amphetamines but DA down regulation will occur with long term use.

				Just because dopamine doesn&#039;t take a long time to restore doesn&#039;t mean there aren&#039;t other negative side effects.&nbsp; You can end up damaging your prefrontal cortex over time, which has a wide range of implications, one of the main ones being problems with impulsivity.&nbsp; Alcoholism has this type of effect.&nbsp; You might be able to restore your dopamine but you need to have a better understanding of what happens when you mess with your brain chemistry and how the brain changes over time as you do so.
