				I have seen listings here at SR containing tan, caramel and just most recently dark brown (WTF? http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/187f51b732) colored MDMA and MDA. Many vendors say it is a result of the precursors used during the synthesis, most noting safrole. Some of it has even earned an undeserved reputation of being superior to white MDMA and it&#039;s popularity seems to be causing a shift in the market from a pure product to a poorly synthesized product. <br /><br />MDMA / MDA is a crystalline white powder in it&#039;s purest form. This tan and carmel color is due to a lazy chemist. <br /><br />Some vendors / users will point out that the chemist simply didn&#039;t do a final wash.&nbsp; When synthesized properly MDMA falls / crystalizes from solution in a pure white form. It is a very fine powder and will cake easily while drying. A &quot;Final Wash&quot; is not required although usually done to remove trace impurities. <br /><br />Some Vendors / users claim the off color is due to left over safrole. Safrole is colorless! It has some interesting refractive properties, but it otherwise as clear as water. More importantly NO safrole should be present during MDP2P Reductive animation which would them yield MDMA before it is crystallized in solution to MDMA.HCL<br /><br />When MDMA production moves to large scale money making operations then shortcuts are made. It is leaving unknown impurities in MDMA. Do yourself a favor and stick to white. If you can&#039;t find it in your area do your body a favor and at least attempt an acetone wash of the product. <br /><br />We as consumers need to demand a better quality and hold manufactures responsible for an inferior product. Purchasing off color, poor quality MDMA only reinforces the use of poor synthesizing techniques and floods the market with inferior quality product because the think they can get away with it.<br /><br /><br />

				The colour comes from the different synthetic route used to make it, there are lots of different ways to make MDMA. Also you should be aware that the slightest impurity can effect colour, just because it&#039;s brown doesn&#039;t make any less strong. Also with MDMA you can only really get to 84% purity anyway. <br /><br />It seems to me you don&#039;t quite have all the facts before making your judgement mate.&nbsp; :-\

				Lim -<br />&nbsp; Regardless of the route used, the end result should be the same. That is my point. Chemist, large scale operations are using shortcuts to save money and produce product. <br /><br />Some things to consider:<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Regardless of the route, the goal is to reach MDP2P of good quality<br />&nbsp; When done properly and with quality precursor when Crystallized the product is white.<br />&nbsp; Impurities are the result of impure precursors. Impurities also add weight to product.<br /><br />Believe me, I am intimately aware of the facts.

				Theres also stereo-chemistry- basically when the 1st molecule is forming, it has no idea what it&#039;s going to be- so it copies whatever it sees around it-and all the other forming molecules imitate whatever the 1st forming molecule did. If it sees a color its like it says I must be that same color- RED - I must be RED also!<br /><br />Kinda kiddie way to explain the workings, but thats pretty much what goes on. Sees a red funnel it decides to be reddish.<br /><br />But brown n tan makes me think dirty stuff , heroin cut, or smuggled up someones ass.

MDMA is an oily liquid at room temperature.<br />The molecular weight of the hydrochloride ion attached to MDMA to make it a crystalline salt is 36.4<br />It follows that the molecular weight of MDMA.HCl, the most commonly encountered salt of MDMA is 229.6.<br />Therefore, of a given weight of 100% MDMA hydrochloride 84% is MDMA, with the remainder being the hydrochloride radical. It&#039;s still 100% pure MDMA hydrochloride, and 118mg of it will yield 100mg of MDMA into the body.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35280.msg402243#msg402243">Quote from: paxpax on August 11, 2012, 04:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lim -<br />&nbsp; Regardless of the route used, the end result should be the same.

I&#039;d argue in favour of A/B followed by fractionation under vacuum of the MDMA freebase before converting it to the salt. Nice. Clean. Pure. Consistent.
