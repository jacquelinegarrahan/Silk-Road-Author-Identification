				<br />175mg mescaline HCl from gammagoblin was measured with a scale accurate to Â±5mg (probably).&nbsp; This was mixed with 7 drops from a sterile saline water ampule (available at chemists) that had previously been warmed in a spoon.&nbsp; Dissolution was fast and complete.&nbsp; The solution was taken through a cross-section of new microslim venturi cigarette filter into a 29G 1cc Terumo syringe.&nbsp; The solution was measured at 75 units volume.&nbsp; Half of the solution was removed from the syringe and saved for later.&nbsp; The remaining half I shot into my arm.&nbsp; <br /><br />That all happened about 3 hours ago.&nbsp; Right now I am cruising comfortably with minor colour amplification and some diffraction grating effects associated with contrast edges in my visual field.&nbsp; I would compare this to the effect of &gt;2.5mg of DOM taken orally at the 4 hour mark, or maybe 30mg AMT taken orally (It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve seen Amy T., so my memory may not be accurate).&nbsp; <br /><br />So, this is very manageable, but it is certainly super-threshold.&nbsp; This is interesting, because Pihkal quotes threshold at ~100mg.&nbsp; I am of average size and weight for an adult.&nbsp; Several days ago I took 150mg of the same salt orally, and did not quite reach threshold. <br /><br />So, we have learned that you can save some money and get more out of mescaline by banging that shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />This does make sense in the context of what I think I know, because I know that DMT, which is broken down very quickly, is effective via inhalation or injection.&nbsp; So, the mescaline in this case probably missed a chance to get eaten by MAO&#039;s during a first-pass metabolism.<br /><br />Too bad I can&#039;t get funded for this shit. ...hey, there&#039;s an idea...<br /><br />-Issuvi

				Interesting... <br />maybe because Sasha is referring to a more pure product than is sold on SR
