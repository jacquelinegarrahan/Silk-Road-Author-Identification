				Thinking about selling some SR MDMA at upcoming festivals this summer and would like to ask for some advice from my peers or anyone who has experience with dealing/soliciting at various events.<br /><br />Some info I&#039;m looking for:<br /><br />1) How to get it in: <br />I&#039;ve heard of secret backpack compartments and the good ole&#039; crotch, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s better ways.<br /><br />2) Advertising: <br />Who to ask, what to say.<br /><br />3) Avoiding Undercover/LE: <br />Probably what I&#039;m most concerned about. Maybe avoid muscular people who look like cops(?) How can you be sure they aren&#039;t a cop? Ask some questions, whatever?<br /><br />4) The actual transaction:<br />Where to conduct your business? Should you work with a partner and have 1 person hold the stuff while the other handle the $? Good quick ways to not be too shady?<br /><br /><br />Can anyone help me out with some tips or advice on distributing at concerts/festivals/events?<br /><br />Just want to learn from the best&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Thanks

				If you know the festival ground well, it is not too difficult to sneak in. <br /><br />Wired fences in the way? Metal plyers solve that easily. Quick way to get free admission and your stuff into the grounds no problem...<br /><br />Selling is super easy, just have to shout out what you are selling and people will be in front of your face in no time. People go to festies for this...<br /><br />Yep, seen a fair share of under covers bust others. A few things to pay attention to:<br /><br />big muscles, very good dental hygiene, clean shoes. Keep in mind that under covers know what hippies look like, so it&#039;s easy for them to mock their appearance. I&#039;ve seen dreaded and tatooed under covers. Scary shit. Another thing is that there is always at least two. <br /><br />Grab people in the public areas, but take them somewhere secluded/secretive. You dont want to be dealing out in the publics eye, trust me.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br /><br />

				Thinking about doing this at one festival this summer.&nbsp; This will be one that I can make decent money at just selling to people I know and their direct referrals.&nbsp; If I were to sell to randoms I would approach their tent, ask them if they need anything, then signal to someone else to come over with the product.&nbsp; That way you can roam around and select a group who definitely are not cops.&nbsp; Pick people who are blatant traveling space cadet hippies and people smoking weed at their camp site.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp; Do you research on the festival, some have cooperated with pigs in recent years and even set up cameras on poles so pigs can spot hand to hand dealing.

				Best thing to do is go with a friend or two. Keep a few of whatever your selling on you and have a friend have the rest. Worst case if you get caught you only have a small amount.<br /><br />Or using 2 people again, they give you the cash and another guys drops it off..<br /><br /><br />Keep your sales to someone who looks college age and you&#039;ll have better chances.

				i did this when i was young and dumb. (lsd @ festivals)<br />One person held one person advertised and felt people out. if you can&#039;t spot the wrong types you have no business doing it. remember that they&#039;re not going to stick out if they&#039;re cops but you dont have to worry tooo much about them esp if its a big fest. but take precautions.<br /><br />but its not really the best idea.<br /><br />what i would suggest, is make friends with people and give out samples :)<br /><br />I remember giving away about 20 hits of acid one festival and feeling kinda dumb as I left. one of the people I gave it to ended up buying 200 hits a week after that though.<br /><br />with mdma etc its always good to &quot;know&quot; the people. make friends, hang out, and enjoy the festival. give your number out and network. the calls will follow. distributing is possible but not the best imo. id rather enjoy myself and not spend the whole time peddling drugs. let them buy the drugs before and after the show, imo, thats my style.

				&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) How to get it in &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Getting what you need into the festival grounds will be the easy part.&nbsp; Generally for any size of festival besides very small local ones, they&#039;ll have a quick car search.&nbsp; Their sole purpose in this is to make sure you don&#039;t have any glass or wood from off the property (has to do w/ insects/diseases that put their trees at risk).&nbsp; Just make sure you don&#039;t stash anything in the cooler, and chances are they won&#039;t even come close to finding it.&nbsp; You really have to play it by ear, but worst case scenario if I see they&#039;re ripping apart cars I&#039;ll often just get out and walk to the ticketing area.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95420.msg677003#msg677003">Quote from: opensky on December 22, 2012, 08:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you know the festival ground well, it is not too difficult to sneak in. <br /><br />Wired fences in the way? Metal plyers solve that easily. Quick way to get free admission and your stuff into the grounds no problem...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would absolutely NOT suggest sneaking in if you plan on vending unmentionables, unless you have a plan for getting a wristband or (preferably if you&#039;re a pro) credentials for VIP/vending/press/artist/staff/production.&nbsp; Having anyone w/ any sort of authority catch you w/o a wristband/laminate/sticky is just asking to be searched.&nbsp; <br /><br />Getting what you need into the concert area (if you&#039;re at a larger festival that has security between the stages and camping) is where things get a little more difficult.<br /><br />1. ALWAYS smile, and NEVER do anything to suggest that your time is being wasted by the 300lb dude cupping your balls in search of a flask of apple pie.&nbsp; They&#039;re working while everyone else is partying, so anything you can do to make them feel like they&#039;re a part of the party vs being the person trying to harsh your mellow helps<br /><br />2. My GOLDEN RULE is to show them you&#039;ve done this before and have nothing to hide by removing everything from your pockets (I like to throw everything in my hat and hold it in front of me), and if you&#039;re wearing a backpack have it in front of you with all the pockets open.&nbsp; If you have a hoody or something in there they&#039;re going to have to remove to search you, remove it for them and drape it over your arm.&nbsp; Anything you can do to speed up the process and show them you know you&#039;re about to get searched up and down is going to make it a lot less likely that they scrutinize your bag/pockets.&nbsp; Often I&#039;ll see the people in front of me get their shit RIPPED apart, and then when I walk up w/ everything presented in front of me ready to go I just get waved by w/ hardly even a glance into my bag.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use obvious/well-known places like your shoe, tucked in your belt, or openly in your hat.&nbsp; If you have a Grassroots hat w/ a secret pocket I&#039;d also be wary of using that, as security has caught onto that after 4yrs of that crew running around festivals lol.&nbsp; Secret pockets in backpacks, underwear, belts, shoes, etc are a good idea as long as they&#039;re well placed and well constructed.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use a pocket w/o a zipper and risk losing product just b/c it&#039;s a sly spot.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest against using battery compartments in flashlights as they often get checked, but usually cameras are ok (make sure you have press credentials if it&#039;s a DSLR though).&nbsp; Generally security doesn&#039;t want to touch your expensive camera, but they&#039;ll rip apart the $5 flashlight you have sitting by itself at the bottom of your bag.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to refrain from going over some of my more stealth methods publicly, but just use your head and you&#039;ll be able to think of a million sly spots to stash stuff.&nbsp; If security allows flags/blow-up toys and whatnot that&#039;s a good place to start brainstorming, especially if you&#039;re trying to get something bulky in like weed.<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Who to sell to/where to sell/how to avoid LE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />This will largely depend on your friend group attending the festival.&nbsp; Obviously it&#039;s always MUCH safer to only deal w/ friends of friends who are referred, but some people justify the risk of working w/ strangers is worth the reward.&nbsp; I generally will never mention anything to strangers, unless I&#039;ve spent a few minutes chatting w/ them already and can tell they&#039;re on the level.&nbsp; If you do decide to sell to complete strangers...<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Don&#039;t yell like many people have suggested already in the thread - feel like this should be common sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; Don&#039;t be that shirtless sweaty rolling bro that darts through the crowd super fast whispering &quot;flame molly, WoW family fluff needle point&quot; into people&#039;s ears.&nbsp; It&#039;s creepy, and it won&#039;t attract the heads who know how this system works and will make transactions run smooth, but rather the first time fest goer who was just openly yelling asking if anyone had seen their sister molly or lucy a moment ago.&nbsp; I always prefer to have a very brief conversation w/ a group of kids that look cool, and then casually ask if they&#039;re doing good on [insert whatever I have here] tonight.&nbsp; More personal interactions make people feel much more comfortable, and give you a chance to briefly evaluate your future clientele before even mentioning anything.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; For something that samples are often asked for, have a little tool (mini coke spoon, key, etc) to hand a small sample that YOU&#039;VE measured out of a bag other than the one you&#039;re selling out of.&nbsp; Do NOT just hand people you don&#039;t know gram of moon rocks and expect them not to take a point rock as a &quot;tester&quot; then not buy anything.&nbsp; Generally I just prefer to say &quot;I&#039;ll stand here while you take a dip of what you buy, and if you don&#039;t like it you can punch me in the face&quot; instead of giving out samples.&nbsp; If they&#039;re not ok w/ that, then they were probably just looking for a free dip anyways. <br /><br />4)&nbsp; As I rule of thumb I will NEVER, regardless of whether I&#039;m selling to strangers or not, do business w/ someone who approaches me.&nbsp; Instead, only work w/ those who you&#039;ve approached.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if they have dreads and are rocking some limited release flatbrim w/ GDF wings on it and a $5000 wrap around their neck - kids who know what&#039;s up are NOT going to be asking randoms for drugs at a festival.&nbsp; Undercovers are not limited to people hired to do that at the festival.&nbsp; Often LE will get kids busted to flip on others by having them run around trying to find drugs while they follow them, watch the transaction, and then bust both of you (then obviously separate you and let the other guy go w/o charges).<br /><br />5)&nbsp; Try to do the majority of your business during the day and within the camping area.&nbsp; This eliminates a lot of the undercover presence, as generally undercovers are in the concert bowl looking for dumbasses, not sitting at a campsite smoking a bowl w/ a bunch of other wooks.&nbsp; Besides, you should be enjoying your festival and getting down to music at night.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; Space out the exchange of money and drugs - do one first, wait 30sec-1min, then do the other.&nbsp; Change of hands w/ a small something followed by change of hands the opposite direction w/ a wad of cash is what LE is looking for, and they generally won&#039;t do anything if they don&#039;t see money handed off right away.<br /><br />7)&nbsp; Do NOT sell drugs at your own campsite to people you don&#039;t know.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need word getting around that you&#039;re the man in the area w/ the fire shard, and that your tent is &quot;right over there ::points at tent::&quot;.<br /><br />8)&nbsp; I would highly suggest have a cheap wirelocked safe well-hidden in a car that you can drop stacks of cash off in.&nbsp; It&#039;s not gonna stop someone who&#039;s determined, but is enough deterrent to keep your friends girlfriend from trying to pluck a couple bucks off your stack when she goes back to the car to get sunscreen.&nbsp; Putting a luggage lock on your tent is NOT going to deter anyone, so have a plan as to how money and excess product will be stashed.&nbsp; However, keep in mind the melting point of whatever you have and how hot your car is going to get.&nbsp; Also, make sure there is a backup key or two w/in your crew for when one of you inevitably loses theirs.<br /><br />9) For powder drugs, keep quantity stashed in something that absorbs moisture if it&#039;s going to be humid.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen ounces of cocaine basically ruined for the time being at festivals before.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and update this w/ any other info I think of, and feel free to pick my brain about anything I haven&#039;t mentioned.<br /><br />Cheers! -Drippy<br />

				+1 drip, really great post. i have to highly agree, the best place to sell is in the camp ground during the day. walk around, chat n smoke a bowl, then offer your wares. if you are camping by your care, you can keep money in the glove box as long as you lock it. good luck and be careful, its really easy to sell at festivals but also really easy to get busted, look up what went down at gnarnia the past summer, around 400 people or something were arrested.<br /><br />edit: also, be careful on the drive into the festival! there are often many drug traps on the highways and roads into the festival where they will stop everyone and search. if you are lucky, they will just seize your stuff and let you go, a friend of mine got stopped on the way to all good and had a pound of weed and 2 jars of chicago mints taken without being arrested.

				I am very excited to sell at fetivals this coming summer. My friend and I have been selling locally for quite a while but we&#039;re going to go to a nearby festival next summer with an ounce of molly and have a great fucking time!<br /><br />Really nice tips in this thread, I&#039;ll keep checking back cause I&#039;ve learned quite a bit.

Various colors of A&#039;s, Bowling Balls, =&#039;s, even blanks. They are generally crumbly and sketchy looking. My connect says he grabs from a handful of polish/lithuanian/east european people most of the time. Although I haven&#039;t seen those guys distributing at festivals/raves around here, most of the time its Hispanics or white dudes, I have a feeling the higher power has got &quot;people&quot; doing the dirty work for them. Who knows? Personally every single batch of Molly and Press i&#039;ve gotten off of SR has been much more high quality than any local press, in my opinion.

				not to be a bummer but LE isn&#039;t as dumb as we wish. I got caught up at a festival and the main detective and his buddy blended in pretty well. I probably would have thought his buddy was rolling. I LIED and said the E was herbal ecstasy. I seriously think that might have ticked him off more and made him want to get me in as much trouble as possible. He tested the pill. If its a semi big to big event they probably know what they&#039;re doing so consider just telling the truth and being cooperative. But not too much truth. I guess at some point i said how much i like weed and mdma and the DA tried to hold that against me in court.

				speaking from experience at music festivals, LE would sometimes just stick out like a sore thumb ass they&#039;re usually a bit older and mature looking for the crowd and just seem to be fixated on scoring gear. They don&#039;t really seem to enjoy the music as much and also tend to dance a lot less. Try to avoid from selling / dealing around those individuals if you happen to see them around. Also trust your gut feeling and you have to be extra careful about this one especially if you&#039;re already rolling as I&#039;ve was lucky enough to sell to people that when I look back seemed pretty suspicious but because I was so loved up rolling I didn&#039;t really care who I was giving it out or selling it to. It&#039;s always good to just take a step back in the heat of the moment and quickly give it some thought as it could be the deciding factor who you sell to.

				Do you really make that much money at festivals that it&#039;s worth the risk? It just seems like a terrible idea to me, the consequences of getting caught are so significant legally and all the money you made would most likely be confiscated. That&#039;s the type of charge that will stop you from getting a job loooong time. <br /><br />And LE doesn&#039;t even have to worry about fitting in necessarily, i&#039;ve heard of them paying kids to find dealers at festivals kind of how they pay underage kids to try and buy beer and then bust stores.

				Getting it TO the festival is sometimes the biggest trick. When driving there, don&#039;t wear tie dye or band shirts, pull back that long hair and wear a hat.Make sure your vehicle is in proper running order or consider renting a car so the police can&#039;t seize yours.Keep drugs shrink wrapped in the trunk.&nbsp; NO drugs in&nbsp; the passenger compartment, especially don&#039;t smoke weed or drink in the vehicle. No Grateful Dead stickers on the car, don&#039;t stop and piss on the side of the road.I used to leave my pipe at home and just buy a new one at every fest. Try to use a little common sense, it can go a long way in an atmosphere like that.don&#039;t get all fucked up until after you&#039;ve done your dealing, watch out for people who look out of place and avoid them. If you look at an area as a whole for a while and watch the traffic and the lurkers, you may save yourself a whole pile of trouble. Having several people in on the dealing[a talker, a holder, a cash guy and a guy to watch the stash vehicle is ideal] makes things go smoother.Stay away from your campsite and vehicles when dealing and make sure people don&#039;t follow you to either. Keep most of your shit hidden in a vehicle preferably with someone nearby to watch it.Re-up as needed and leave extra cash under your buddies watchful eye. We used to vend nitrous oxide all over the Eastern US at shows and festivals, retired now ;]

				We sell at loads of festivals every summer. <br />&nbsp;The first few sales you need to seek out, wear distinctive clothes, then find a nice patch of grass to sit on and let the sales come to you. You meet some cool people like that,. Always have a little bit separate for yummy ladies and testers. Good idea to have some muscle with you if you can´t handle yourself, you get a higher amount of alcohol at festivals than other places which means more people wanting to test the drug dealer. personally I keep an extendable cosh and my great dane with me if selling alone. <br /><br />As for getting it in. I prepare g wraps and have a secret compartment in my boxers. :) <br /><br />LE- with practice they will get so easy to spot. look for bulges on their waste, thick jackets camouflaging their vests. people looking around, look for ear pieces before engaging in conversation. A really good method I came up with is when you go to talk to someone new pretend you cant hear them, lean in and put your ear to them, as you do gently put your hand on their waste and have a feel for their radio. Look for people that dont fit in... <br /><br />Have drop locations predefined, if you get bother run there out of site dash the drugs and have a friend keep an eye to retrieve them. if they cant find the drugs they cant arrest you.
