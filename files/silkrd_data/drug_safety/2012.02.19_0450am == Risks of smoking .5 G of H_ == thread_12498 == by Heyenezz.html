				I want to smoke heroin just once but am not sure how much different quantities of he drug last. Could I, for example, smoke .5 G in a night?

				Yeah, you&#039;ll prolly get nauseous smoking that much in a night if you&#039;ve never done H.&nbsp; I used to smoke black tar and I had to take it easy when I first started.

				Actually H is more physically addictive than almost any other drugs, so having or not having personal issues will be rather irrelevant to getting addicted.&nbsp; If you only have once you will not get addicted, but some people get physically addicted in a short period.

				I would suggest to reconsider smoking the H in the first place, depending on what exactly youre looking for in the experience. Is there a reason you want to go with that method over just snorting some of the #4? <br /><br />You could smoke #4, especially if you have no tolerance, you will still get some effect but largely waste most of what you have which is what you need anyway really. Even #3 degrades under heat some, H just isnt even really meant to be smoked (except for the bioavailability) because the molecule is so unstable. <br /><br />You could ask a vendor to put up a smaller sample, most would prob glad to help you, but it will certainly cost disproportionately more to be worth their time, effort and shipping costs. <br /><br />Also, one problem is that you will have a hard time buying a quantity that is small enough for just one use, because even .1 may be enough for multiple uses depending on your sensitivity and the quality. Or you may end up wasting it all accidentally, or may have a unique resistance and require more than expected... hard to say how much you will need.<br /><br />You could always buy a sack and give the rest to your friends if they are interested/experienced or a local homeless addict who would be more than happy to keep you from using it I am sure. or you could be shady and cut it, then sell it to make your money back and more as some do I am sure... (please do not do that)<br /><br />You *may* also be able to base the H back out from the salt, but this is in theory and I have never heard of it being done.<br /><br />I would recommend you just stay away from opioids completely honestly. Please be safe.<br />- miRNA

Most 1st time users being this way.<br /><br />Besides, smoking it does take some skill/experience/tutelage I&#039;ve heard. That dragon is a bitch to chase on foil unless you know how.

				If you are just wanting to try out of curiousity, and think the .5 g is too much, buy the .5, throw half away (not where you can get it back), and .25 g is probably a more sensible amount to satisfy your curiousity.&nbsp; I have tried smoking the dragon once and wasnt overly impressed.

Yeah, mixing downers, I know. The quantities I use are quite small.<br /><br />But I was addicted to another drug (not gonna say which one)&nbsp; for years and I know how bad the life of an addict can get. So if I buy .5g of H, and start out a few little puffs, graduating to regular puffs later that day, then end up smoking the whole bag in three days, I pretty much know what to expect. The fourth day is gonna suck really bad. Not to worry. I have those benzons and some hash to keep me on the couch watching TV all day.<br /><br />The listings I&#039;m looking at say &quot;pure Afghan heroin&quot; or &quot;right off the block&quot; or something similar. But they don&#039;t say #3 or #4 and I have no idea what the numbers mean. One says you can &quot;snort, poke, or smoke&quot; it.<br /><br />Another vendor&#039;s product is reviewed thusly: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11627.msg121580#msg121580<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">SMOKING: The product smoked more nicely than any other I&#039;ve tried. Probably did about 0.05. On the foil it turned into a glorious liquid that burned for a good long time. I was able to chase the stream back and forth along the foil and get a good 5-6 hits before it burned up completely. (I smoked after I shot), and the hits made my high keep building, each one giving me a nice head rush. I&#039;d actually say that this product is better off being smoked than IV&#039;ed.<br /><br />Insufflation (SNORTING): I didn&#039;t try this one, but my friend did. He said it burned a bit in the nose, but it gave him a nice high. He snorted and then chased with a few hits of smoking, and he felt quite good all day, but he doesn&#039;t have the tolerance I do at all</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>.<br />So That&#039;s all I know about the subject of Heroin right there and I&#039;m just about ready to pull the trigger on this listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/17817

				woah there cowboy, you may be about to buy #4<br /><br />you can smoke 4, you will just waste most of it... up to you, just dont tell people here :)<br /><br />tony, wumg, dolfan, all have #4 salt<br /><br />psilocin, noriega (the review you quoted) have #3 for smoking<br /><br />tar is also good for smoking, so JD2012<br /><br />honestly, tony has some of the best but I would recommend you get .5 of noriegas for 60 if you are willing to do netherlands<br />if not, then the ninety dollar .5 tar from JD&nbsp;

				like I said, you can smoke tony&#039;s #4... its just not the best route and you will waste most of it. Even PJ said you can snort his tar... and yea you can dissolve it in water and snort it, but its a pain in the ass so people dont say tar is for snorting. PJ was just trying to sell his product. <br /><br />If you are going to buy tonys, why buy the .5 and not the .25 anyway? If youre gonna buy #4 just buy a bag or two from dolfan, who also mentions you can smoke his but its the salt too.<br /><br />You just really dont need an entire .5 if you just want to smoke some once<br />

Mistakes will likely be made and substance wasted. For instance: Do I, or do I not, neet to add citric acid to the granular heroin to make it dissolve in water for spraying up my nose? And is this preferable to snorting the dry powder? How does the nasal route compare to just eating it? I have more research and experimentation to do.<br /><br />The Roxycodone and Oxicontin pills on SR seem far too expensive. I don&#039;t know much about codeine. I ate a 30mg (That could be wrong. It was small and orange.) morphine sulphate once and felt nothing. There&#039;s no way I&#039;m going to abuse my liver with the acetaminophen in Vicodin and such. So that leaves me with brown heroin as the only affordable opiate to experiment with.<br /><br />I tried poppy pod tea too with no success. So .5g heroin it is. Thanks to microRNA for the info and to the OP for asking the question. My apologies if I&#039;ve hijacked the thread.

				rocketdog, I actually didnt realize where your first post was. I thought you were one who was simply interested in only trying H once, and were set on smoking it...<br /><br />If you just want to experiment with an opiate be very careful! addictions take grab of you and you slip into it without realizing deep you are. My DOC is actually oxycodone and I am resorting to H for both my medical and recreational purposes given the ridiculous prices I can no longer afford unfortunately.<br /><br />That being said, definitely would recommend tony if you are looking for good H in general. I am eagerly awaiting my own order. I was very pleased by wumgs and tony should be just as good. <br /><br />If you are buying from tony, its salt 4, so it will dissolve readily without acid, but it is not really intended for smoking. Just try snorting a tiny bit of the powder to begin though... no need for all the hassle of using water when figuring out your dose. Also, dont orally ingest the H, the bio-availability is really low and you will waste most of it.

				My advice. Snort a match head size bump and wait 20 minutes. The effects of H are very subtle in the smaller dose range. Learn your body and pick up on the change. if you like it re-dose the same size. if you do it like this chances are you will throw up when you find you body&#039;s limit, without getting close to OD and excessive respiratory depression levels. My OPINION anyway. onset from snorting good H is a stronger rush then smoking. All that smoke your blowing out... what a waste!

I just bought some #4. I don&#039;t intend to go on a three day run with it but if I do, I&#039;m prepared for that fourth day where my body does not get its expected dose of whatever. <br /><br />Is .25g enough for a first time user to go on a three day run? Hopefully I won&#039;t have to pull out the hash and benzos just to bring my first heroin binge to a soft landing.<br />

				.25 of good H using any route besides I.V. isn&#039;t going to last you 3 days of being high. I would say all day one day and maybe half of another at most if you are conservative.<br /><br />
