				When I was living elsewhere I happened into someone who shot heroin where I got to experience it. I did it a handful of times and tried shooting for myself, but I wouldn&#039;t be comfortable doing that alone yet. Where I live now I don&#039;t know many people who use anything and definitely not any that would be OK with heroin use.<br /><br />Would you have any tips or suggestions finding someone responsible to shoot with until I was comfortable doing it myself?

Avoid it like the plague. I lost 10 years of my life to the needle and I am still a heroin addict after 20 yrs.<br /><br />Secondly, no easy way to find IV users who are capable of showing you how to IV safely. You are just going to have to go out and make friends. Is there a needle exchange type place in your area where you can go for anonymous advice and help with IVing drugs?
