				I&#039;m not going to share a needle because I&#039;m not going to inject myself with anything (in the near future), but I have a question. Is there a problem sharing a needle with your partner if you are sure they don&#039;t have HIV or hepatitis or any other blood-borne disease?

				Needles are designed to be single use these days, and using them multiple times on yourself, or shared with disease-free others is recommended against. In medical practice it is common to first disinfect the injection site (using isopropanol wipes or such) to prevent transferring anything on the skin into the bloodstream. Pulling the needle out and re-inserting it later on would compromise that sterility, even apart from what could contaminate it between injections when stored in a non-sterile environment.<br /><br />Realistically you will exchange bacteria and viruses with your partner in any case, so the added risk of sharing a needle is not that enormous if you&#039;re both free of any infectious disease. If you are of different blood types (as in the AB0 +/-) system it would be important to ensure that you never accidentally inject blood from someone with type A/B/AB to type 0. The risk of this resulting in disaster isn&#039;t very high if the amount is minute (&#039;what sticks in a needle&#039;), but on the other hand it often only takes a single blood cloth to kill you.

				If holy Jesus himself comes down in a chariot carried by angels riding on a big bright light and says, yo&#039; wanna share a hit? The simple answer is: NO<br /><br />Never ever ever ever share a needle. Never!<br /><br />The fucking things cost next to nothing these days and are readily available in most EU countries. <br /><br />DO NOT SHARE NEEDLES. EVER! HIV and Hep are only two of a gazillion things you can contract from sharing needles. Do not do it, ever ever ever.<br /><br />I think I know what country you are located in. If I&#039;m right, just look up the next pharmacy with &quot;Nachtdienst&quot; if need be. They&#039;ll be cranky but give you the gear.
