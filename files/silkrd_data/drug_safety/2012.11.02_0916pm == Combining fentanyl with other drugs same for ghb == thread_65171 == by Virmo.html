				I&#039;ve read that both fentanyl and ghb should not be used with alcohol. And F and G not with eachother.<br /><br />I have a way too gigh tolerance for G, and can drink with it (though I did it a few times and never do it again since it can be lethal).<br /><br />Im just clueless as to why fentanyl and ghb cant be combined. I read that F is used together with benzo&#039;s in hospitals. GHB is a barbirature (like benzo but older and stronger, as far as I know (although the effects feel different). Correct me if I&#039;m wrong...<br /><br />

				GHB most certainly is not a barbituate, its most similar to the neurotransmitter GABA<br /><br />barbs have a specific chemical backbone and gamma hydroxybutyrate has a different structure<br /><br />GHB effects GABA-B receptor, while alcohol and benzos effect GabaA receptor<br /><br />also, GHB specifically targets its own receptor <br /><br />therefore the effects are potentiated when you mix two drugs that alter the activity of the same transmitter<br /><br />opiates are dangerous to mix because they too impact GABAergic transmission, just at the mu receptor increasing gaba which then effects the gabaA receptor... <br /><br />&nbsp;so basically it causes much greater respiratory depression and can result in death if mixed with alcohol or opiates - which is why its not recommended...

				Indeed. Even if you factor out alcohol, taking ghb and fentanyl at the same time is risky arealdy.<br /><br />Combining drugs that affect different receptors simultaneously is a very tricky business. It can be very enjoyable to do so, but also very dangerous. Getting advise from a forum like this may be useful to avoid the worst problems.
