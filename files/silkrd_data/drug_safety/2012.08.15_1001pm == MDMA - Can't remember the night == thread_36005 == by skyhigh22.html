				Only a light user and had two batches off SR.&nbsp; First made me really happy and I could remember the night.<br /><br />Second batch no happy feeling and have big blank periods in my memory.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do it too often and only have 100mg.&nbsp; I had plenty of alcohol with both in nightclubs / festivals.<br /><br />Could it be something other than MDMA or be cut with something?&nbsp; Or could it be my brain changing?<br /><br />

				It&#039;s the alcohol.&nbsp; I once ate .1 after drinking all day and night (stupid, I know), and didn&#039;t even remember taking it/feeling it until I went into my bag and some caps were missing and asked a friend.<br /><br />Lesson: don&#039;t drink and drop...or at least don&#039;t drink like you normally would and throw in some water every now and then

				MDMA is a type of amphetamine.&nbsp; Alcohol when drank too much will pretty much kill the roll.

				I find that if I&#039;m using MDMA fairly regularly I started to get big blank spots in my memory. If I use it say once or twice a month for a few months, when I take it (always at a rave) I remember dropping, vaguely remember vomiting, dancing and dropping again and then the sun is up and I&#039;m all sleepy and looking for a cuddle. I never use more than a quarter gram over 6-8 hours either - less if I haven&#039;t taken it in a while. The more you use MDMA, the side effects seem to grow exponentially unpleasant. I never used to vomit when I first started but now it&#039;s pretty much routine. I don&#039;t drink alcohol at all.<br /><br />I think the stuff really plays with your memory and has to be treated with a lot of respect. It&#039;s treated like aspirin by a lot of people (in the UK especially!) and has an undeserved reputation for being harmless.

				The thing that gets me- I know people say you shouldn&#039;t drink and then take MDMA.&nbsp; But realistically, I&#039;m gonna take MDMA at a club or at a house party. I&#039;m also gonna take it at least a couple of hours into the night (who the f... takes a pill when they walk in the door?)<br /><br />So in that case, I always have had a few drinks. The only time I&#039;ve not been drunk is if I&#039;ve had a cheeky home session with my partner, and even then I&#039;ve probably had 2-3 drinks before dropping. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how some people manage it...

				The only time I can&#039;t remember anything after taking MDMA is after drinking, smoking weed or taking it in high doses - 200mg+ :)

				Cheers for the replies.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to forget the night so I&#039;ll try either cutting down the booze a lot (very hard!) or try a different batch - like I said, the first batch put a big smile on your face, second batch no smile so could have been different stuff e.g. MDA or cut with something.

				Yeah switch out the alcohol with juice / water / OJ and you will be in for a much better night
