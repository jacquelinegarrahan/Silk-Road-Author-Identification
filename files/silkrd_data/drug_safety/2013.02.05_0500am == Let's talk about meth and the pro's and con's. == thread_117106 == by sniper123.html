				I&#039;m curious of what side effects the members of our fine community suffer from. What are the pros? They don&#039;t have to be scientifically accurate, but you can only post about things you have observed yourself about your body. (Don&#039;t even think about posting on my thread if you start with the following words. &quot;i don&#039;t do meth,but.&quot;)<br /><br />Pros<br />Mental and body Euphoria.(Best sex of my life.)<br />Able to complete tasks that are normally mind numbing with ease.<br />Less appetite<br />More energy<br />Enhance music appreciation.<br />Talk more<br />More social (Because of the ego boost.)<br /><br />Cons<br />Muscle pain<br />Fatigue<br />Battling starvation and mal nutrition. (Forcing myself to eat three meals a day and take vitamins.)<br />Eye soreness.<br />Teeth clenching and grinding<br />Saying a million words, but feeling as if i can&#039;t reach my point.<br />Chest pain (Sharpness when breathing and shortness of breath.)<br /><br /><br />My most used route of administration is smoking. That explains why i get chest pain. I have been switching to snorting and orally and i have noticed a decline in chest pain. I&#039;m starting to wonder if the vapor causes inflation leading to pleurisy. I have had it looked at many times by medical professionals and they can&#039;t seem to find a cause for the pain. Heart is good, blood pressure is good, and so are my lungs. My doctor informed me that people who smoke many cigs a day can have chest pain due to the lungs constantly trying to heal against damage. (i think he was hinting at my meth use.) <br /><br />I was just wondering if anyone else has the pros and cons i have. What are your pros and cons? You might remind me of some i forgot to list. I personally feel that meth like any substance can be used responsibly and i believe the health issues are from a combination of mal nutrition, fatigue, dehydration, and possible the route of administration. i know that meth in itself is corrosive to the veins which can lead to cardiovascular health issues. So i could only imagine the cons i would suffer from if i had stuck with the needle. <br /><br />So i invite you to come on in and type up your pros and cons. Maybe share a story or two. Spread the knowledge to fellow tweakers. I&#039;m beginning to come to the conclusion that it isn&#039;t&nbsp; reason &quot;why&quot; we tweak, it&#039;s the fact we &quot;love&quot; to tweak that brings us closer to one another.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				One of the things I don&#039;t like about it is the way it makes my mouth dry. I think it drains the body of fluids. So my mouth gets dry and sticky with that nasty build up on it so I have to carry around some chap stick. Oobahs latest batch is just unreal sniper. It is better then what Kush411 sent me last time. When I have access to the camera I&#039;ll post you a pic to look at. He sent me 3/4 gram that consist of 2 solid chunks. They are glassy and have a flat not glossy surface. All I did was a crumb snorted and it last forever. Within ten minutes I could feel that warm feeling crawling up from my stomach. What a game changer!<br /><br />Yes another con is that it&#039;s hard on my body as well. I can see how them before and after pictures came about now on people but I figured that was just nasty shake n bake shit causing that premature old age to kick in on folks using it. I wish I had a prope meth pipe and I am thinking of getting one for the rest of this killer shit. I used one once a couple years back and it really was the bomb and gave smoking meth a completely different meaning. After that I could see how people were getting addicted. I am still going to do a tester on an aluminum boat in the mean time. I agree with all your pros and cons except I have not experienced eye soreness but I have had blurred vision have you?<br /><br />The sex is crazy. I mean you find yourself reaching down into those regions without even noticing it a person has to stand fast and not do that kind of shit. I saw a documentary on it where they had a guy in an observation room and he had jacked off for 7 or 8 hours straight. That&#039;s crazy sounding to me but with what some of these folks write in the forums it isn&#039;t to off base.<br /><br />The burst of energy you get along with the euphoria can sometimes send a person into a state of confusion but mind control comes into play. It&#039;s hard to talk to somebody who is tweaking because you can hardly get a word in edgewise. I think using a vapor pipe and smoking at night may be a viable solution because snorting seems o be really hard core with this stuff. I don&#039;t know about you but I can snort ten mg and be up for 2 days and one night. You gota be careful who you introduc it too also because a lot of people haven&#039;t got the mentality to handle it and still function. They do too much and stay up a week then sleep for 4 days then wake up feeling like they are dead.<br /><br />You definitely got to force yourself to eat and drink. Eating and drinking while using this is not for the pleasure but for the health reasons. The smell of foods while on this stuff will make you sick little lone try to eat something so you have to force it. It&#039;s like a chore.<br /><br />Yes there is teeth grinding and jaw clenching. Haven&#039;t had no chest pains yet but The shortness of breath comes to me when I am crashing and need sleep. One morning I woke up in shear agony because my calf muscle was cramping. It&#039;s very important to drink plenty of fluids and may be helpful to take vitamins.

				the pro is the awesome high<br /><br />the cons are really coming down to how damaging it is on your brain and the dopamine system, and your body.. plus the toxic bake and shake methods, and its addictive potential. allot more cons but the high is great.. i just wont be doing it more than bi-monthly basis and you really have to prepare for the whole experience.<br /><br />when i got my first high a week or two ago i drank 1.5 litres of water before i snorted it just in case i didnt drink water much while on&nbsp; it.. and im glad i did cos i didnt end up drinking much water on it!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				a con would be that this ice from SR is a lot cleaner then shake n bake stuff. Does it cause &quot;meth Sores&quot;? I don&#039;t know but I know that shake n bake stuff does. I knew people who had big holes in their back where half inch round strings of puss and infection would exit. It&#039;s gross as hell

				from personal experience....please...PLEASE do not abuse the amount you take in<br /><br /><br />i cant stress that enough...aside from making sure you drink a lot of fluids and eat healthy meals with vitamins...and no sleep deprevation...TAKE IT EASY ON THE AMOUNT YOU TAKE IN...cause you begin to reverse any pro&#039;s<br /><br />example, 20-40mg&nbsp; is good for that energy and whatever good feelings.....<br /><br /><br />me?&nbsp; after a day or two did a MINIMAL of 80-120mg...what ended up happening?&nbsp; was not able to talk..normally...for a while...like anything in my head was not verbally shown, ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;i was misrepresenting myself ...lost a substantial amount of weight...and lost one HELL of a job. <br /><br />I rebooted myself...paused for over 1 and a half months...and ready to, whenever I get back to it...take it..sparingly&nbsp; and NEVER more than 40-50mg at most.<br /><br />do not ever do what some do...a point.&nbsp; seriously. u will go down a path that will make you want to rip off your dick and suck on it.

				I&#039;ll go ahead and chime in because I don&#039;t want this thread to die on the note of a couple people saying meth kills your brain. As one pointed out, you could say that for any drug, especially used unwisely. <br /><br />I tried meth despite warnings and can say that it hasn&#039;t taken over my life. You have to know to say no and when. I&#039;ve used it for staying up all-night but not very often, typically it&#039;s a small dose to get me going, work and play all day, and crash that night (and I always keep myself hydrated and start off the day with vitamins and supplements). I don&#039;t use daily and I keep myself in a range of around 20-40mg (snorted) for the most part.<br /><br />So here are my cons--what I&#039;ve experienced only(can&#039;t say I&#039;ve &quot;experienced&quot; any brain damage):<br /><br />ADDICTIVE--it&#039;s easy to want to do more, yes, but not compulsory. Set limits for yourself and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Loss of sleep/nutrition (byproduct)--To me, it&#039;s not fair that people associate this with a &quot;con&quot; of meth as the user is the one fucking this up but I&#039;ll put it here. As stated above, I usually make effort to sleep as well as normal and take plenty of supplements as well as eat something. I find it to not be a problem to eat fruits while on meth (and they double for hydration and lots of vitamins). <br /><br />Dry mouth--awful and no amount of liquid seems to ameliorate this. Very gross<br /><br />Loss of focus/inability to communicate--this is at higher(higher being relative) doses when your thoughts scatter and it becomes harder to stay on one thing for long. To me, this is indicative that you have/are taking to much and need to taper back.<br /><br />Comedown: As the effects wear off I can end up feeling pretty bad/fatigued/depressed but nothing that I would consider particularly harsh. <br /><br />PROs(according to what I experienced, I have not went on any crazy sex binges or anything while doing meth):<br /><br />Energy--like I got up on the right side of the bed for days!<br /><br />Enthusiasm--I&#039;m down for anything, anytime--social, work, whatever<br /><br />Happiness--Euphoria would be too strong of a word but I feel good, better. I&#039;m more okay with everything and I just feel happier.<br /><br />Focus--At the proper doses and with the right mindset I can get a large amount of work done, no problem<br /><br />Fun--This gets its own category because I&#039;ve found it to be a nice social and enjoyable activity: get some people together and have a little smoke and talk, move, do, whatever you want<br /><br /><br />So there you go-- a 5 con vs 5 pro list of what meth does for me. No brain explosions, no ungodly sexual feats, just some good feelings, some bad feelings, and some things in-between. <br /><br />One other bit of advice: if you don&#039;t have any benzos, don&#039;t take any meth/stimulants. The most damaging part is denying your body sleep/nutrition and benzos will help with the first if nothing else. <br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Pro: gives you energy, but makes you less efficient (makes your mind disorganized unless perhaps you have attention deficit.)<br /><br />Con: a very toxic drug which will destroy your physical and mental health with regular use. Also can keep you from sleeping for much longer that planned, days sometimes. Personally, it makes my body feel nasty. I would much rather do some fine blow or Dexedrine if I need a stimulant.<br /><br />oxyhoot

				Pros: enjoyable high, smoking makes me extremely relaxed and happy; extra energy to complete projects you&#039;ve been putting off; intense focus on whatever you are doing; amazing sex; the ritual of smoking is quite fun.<br /><br />Cons: I get very jumpy, like from a loud noise (a Benzo helps with this); smoking a lot will give me a cough (does not linger); sometimes I get the shortness of breath, I really don&#039;t think this is from the smoke itself but from exertion on the body (elevated heart rate, breathing, etc.); I also find it difficult to socialize with anyone other than my gf. No one else knows that I dabble and I would probably be judged harshly if they found out I was high. The teeth grinding/biting is a major con, but just remember to chew gum.<br /><br />Mouth dryness is easily solved with water, chapstick, cough drops. Loss of appetite I don&#039;t consider to be a con, you can lose weight, just be smart by taking suppliments, and drinking protein shakes, eat small meals when you can. I don&#039;t experience a harsh comedown, I can almost always sleep after using. I do use very clean gear though, from vendor hammertime if anyone&#039;s curious.<br /><br />Question for those who keep talking about .mg dosages, do you actually use scales to weigh out how much you use? Or do you just eyeball it?

I seem to be in a minority in this regard but I feel it&#039;s an important aspect of health to have a good idea of how much you have taken for your own benefit if nothing else. Example: I snorted 65mg one morning couple with some nootropics and my standard supplement regimen when I am using meth and experienced a side effect I&#039;d not encountered before: dizziness but specifically the world was actually spinning in my perception when I looked further away than a computer screen. By knowing my dosages of that morning and the previous days (even if only generally), it gave me an idea of how to either avoid or achieve that level again if I wanted. By eyeballing, I&#039;ve found that I can be fairly accurate (The other day I would grab a small shard and was able to come fairly close to calling the weight of pieces 20-60mg in weight just because of my frequency of sizing up said doses--same with cut lines) it is not always a sure thing and not something I&#039;d want to rely on. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				For me the biggest con is I totally forget about eating or drinking, and any aches or muscle tension is amplified when you&#039;re dehydrated. I&#039;ll tell myself &quot;I&#039;m going to drink at least 5 glasses of water today!&quot;, only to get lost in some project that diverts all my attention - 9 hours later that first glass of water is still only half empty. Same think with eating. I&#039;ll be like &quot;fuck! I haven&#039;t eaten since yesterday, everyone&#039;s gonna know I&#039;m tweaking!&quot; then force myself to eat. I know from long experience that you can&#039;t drop over 10lbs in one week without someone noticing.<br /><br />The biggest pros are intense focus and total elimination of fatigue. But these are only really achievable in small doses. Do a cocaine-sized rail and you&#039;ll be spun inside out into a jabbering spazz flying in hypervigilant multitasker-mode, which is fine as far as it goes. But after a day two of no sleep it starts degenerating into completely scatterbrained thinking and eventually a loopy delirium edging into &#039;schizophrenia-lite&#039; where only paranoid delusions make perfect sense. But you have to be going at it pretty heavy to get there (not recommended btw).

				Pros:<br /><br />- Already said multiple times above<br />- Also end to end completion of random mini&quot;projects&quot; around the house/on computer/etc that normally are put off for whatever reason suddenly become of paramount importance and this seems to overcome the whole getting distracted aspect of tweaking.<br />- For many people ice can end up being a trigger to start looking after their health better EVEN while continuing their ice usage<br />YES the above is not a typo or trolling, I have come across mountains of info regarding different kinds of vitamins, supplements and minerals that I know were already missing from my diet while researching a loosely related topic about ice! I can also say with honesty that keeping up the right level of nutrition and rest allows me to function and maintain a decent mood even while in the coming down phase after a binge.<br /><br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*****This one is very important I think*****<br /><br />- Unpredictability of the result when ice is mixed with a pre-existing mental health issue, made a fukload more unpredictable if you don&#039;t actually know your own general mental state. This is why if you must try ice, begin on the ground floor and take the stairs up slowly - ie start off with tiny amounts and really know and understand what &quot;typical&quot; effects are and whether yours differ substantially. Obviously a lot more common sense things you need to do to keep yourself (and others around you) safe, which have been mentioned above.<br />- Time Machine, or &quot;Back to the Future 1c3 - The Crystal Stole my Time!&quot;<br />The 2nd Pro above is also a Con given how much time you can waste on doing something as useless as creating a new cushioned box for your pipe collection although the current one is perfectly fine. Staying up for the whole night, being perfectly awake but no matter what you do, you cannot avoid coming late to work. Somehow it&#039;s nearly impossible to plan the pre-work things that need to be done!<br />- Obvious one, $$$, although depending where you live this can be anywhere between $$ and $$$$<br /><br /><br />Lastly I feel compelled to write something about mr Brain Damage<br />**Disclaimer - I do not work nor have I completed any professional studies within the Health field, brain or otherwise, the below are purely my opinions and speculation reinforced to me by a highly evolved set of analytical skills and logic**<br /><br />1 - The old adage,&nbsp; &quot;We only use x% of our brain&quot;, rings true to me and begs to question what the other 100-x% is/will be doing..<br />The human physical body is highly adaptable to the environment, damage (internal/external) included. Is it then not logical to surmise that the remainder of our brain matter is (at least partially) available to be activated when required due to reduced capacity in a neighbouring brain cells that have ceased to function for whatever reason?<br />I also believe that at least some of the &quot;surplus&quot; brain cells are activated and used&nbsp; when the need arises - a high pressure situation perhaps where you surprise yourself with your ability or knowledge you didn&#039;t even know you learnt.<br />RESILIENCE - we all really need to learn our own levels of this and there&#039;s something to say for people who know themselves to be in the low end of the resilience scale ensuring they minimise//cut off any ice use.<br /><br />2 - Brian vs Mind - I&#039;m sure we all get this one and right now I&#039;m running out of the desire to continue typing..<br /><br />3 - Other factors - the infamous cat scan of a brain after ice use with &quot;holes&quot; in a number of spots and assuming they were made without using an apple-corer, could have been caused by anything! From overheating, to repeated long periods of dehydration to a heavy depletion of the many minerals, vitamins, nutrients and fats our brain matter requires to maintain a healthy physical state,<br /><br />4 - The existence of Forums... &#039;nuff said :)<br /><br />

You said a lot of good things but especially this is something I agree with. I think I&#039;ve taken a lot better care/been more aware of my body and how I should/do treat it since trying meth. With any drug it&#039;s all about how you approach it (for me, I know there are people with addictive personalities that have a harder time with this sort of thing) and meth use for me has been an overall solid experience in regards to helping me look at my health and encourage me to eat healthier, exercise, etc. <br /><br />Also, what you said about it&#039;s unpredictable effects on certain personalities in the Cons was a solid point also. It can definitely fuck with people who have latent/manageable (and especially un-manageable) psychological issues. <br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

Truth is until we witness a thing happening right in front of us, most will never believe or understand what any one of the Pro or Con points is.<br /><br />Unfortunately my warning regarding meth&#039;s interaction with the human psyche is based on 1st hand experience with someone who is/was very close and dear to me.<br /><br /><br />I think above all else however, we all need to try to remember this FACT:<br />Science may have made progress understanding the physical aspect of our body, the brain for this particular discussion, albeit this progress has only made it clear that there is a lot more to research than was thought initially. HOWEVER, this is all regarding the physical side - what about he mental side? The Mind? The Psyche? The inexplicable? etc...<br /><br />Person A has a certain kind of mental &quot;instability&quot; so he is prescribed pharma speed.<br />Person B is completely healthy and enjoys street speed which may create mental instability.<br /><br />Granted, B doesn&#039;t become A in the above example, and yes it&#039;s very simplistic, but fuk me - these &quot;doctors&quot; have dozens of ulterior motives to give you multiple prescriptions; and they claim you need to take this pill, and the other half dozen because you are addicted to a street drug! meh.. <br /><br />Anyways, keep smiling people and do all you can do maintain positivity within yourselves first and foremost! I can guarantee you from personal experience, the mind can make a sugar pill give you the same positive effect (minus the negatives) that anti-biotics are trying to achieve.<br /><br />:D

				I feel for ya, man, really. I too have had some experiences involving people close to me (and hell, myself too) who&#039;ve had some psychological issues in general and it becomes fairly observable the negative impacts meth, and other stims/psychedelics, can have on a vulnerable psyche. Thankfully my own problems I&#039;ve been able to cope and handle but there are others who aren&#039;t as fortunate. <br /><br />As long as governments maintain blanket bans and upholding negative stigmas the research in these areas will remain inert. Turning a blind eye to the problem doesn&#039;t make it go away: people will continue to abuse drugs and the best method of protecting the populace is to invest in harm reduction by researching the observable effects that come as a result of meth abuse. You&#039;re right that the sober mind is a conundrum that we are far from solving. I think one of the most effective ways to gather knowledge on how the &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;average&quot; mind/brain work is to examine how we can manipulate it and then interpret that information back to a general level. Drugs like meth are a great way to see what role certain brain parts and brain activity/communication indicate. <br /><br />We&#039;re a long way off from this way of thinking from becoming widespread and, until it does, I&#039;m afraid people are going to continue to have to discover the harmful effects of meth the hard way. Even worse, it will likely continue to receive a bad reputation due to dangerous/misinformed use habits and may keep people away from trying it or stop people who have already tried it from enjoying some of the many benefits responsible meth use can provide. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Oh my how embarrassing...<br />Chalk another con for ice - &quot;Temporary blonde syndrome&quot; (No offence to blondes here, clearly you&#039;ve already proven yourself to be above the envelope given that you&#039;re reading my post on the silkroad forums ;) )<br /><br />While you definitely did deserve that +1 Kharma Snoopish, I was sending it to thank for starting this thread lol...<br />Sniper123 - I&#039;m sure you&#039;re getting tons of good kharma coming your way IRL but I&#039;ll send you a token of it on here when I can :)<br /><br />I feel like I may have partially sent this topic on slightly diverging tracks but still in the same direction kinda.. I really like that this thread is sort of evolving into an open discussion on the topic without all those annoying vendor reviews LOL (now no one&#039;s gona take me seriously...)<br /><br />Snoopish, thank you I appreciate the sentiment and it goes almost without saying that my thoughts are with you. No matter the length of time passed, these type of memories linger and may indeed never completely evaporate.<br /><br />There are only a few people that know I take ice and also about the terrible experience I mentioned before where the same ice played a big role, and yet not a single person has questioned why I still take it. There are days where I feel I&#039;m betraying this person by even just thinking about ordering more or planning to have some later..<br /><br />Now, that is a pretty good demonstration of the commanding POWER this molecule has...<br /><br />I feel that 1 year after trying it for the first time I am further from being addicted to it now than I was say 9 months ago. I won&#039;t go into detail because this thread isn&#039;t about me but about the point I&#039;m trying to make (hopefully I remember it...), but these days I can be just doing my thing in the middle of the night and I know the pipe is right there within easy arm&#039;s each and loaded with a delicious chunky rock already cracked back a few times.. But instead I continue doing whatever useless thing I&#039;ve been doing on the laptop, maybe even catching up on work etc.. and 2 hours later I notice I&#039;m yawning heavily and eyes are getting heavy which is when I finally have a puff or 2 if I don&#039;t just fall back on the couch and fall asleep instead...<br /><br />When I first started taking it on occasion I recall how after a week off it my senses would start to get effected in an odd way:<br />I would come home after work and as I open the door a scent hits my nasal passages, an unmistakable musky scent of cleanly vapourised ice. No one at my place, no ice at home anyway, I know 100% it&#039;s my mind trying to remind me of a way it can feel rewarded via that uniquely and supremely strong rush of dopamine. The mind remembers previous times it experienced that feeling, a unique scent was in the air - quick learners these CPUs we have in our skulls.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure everyone here has experienced a forgotten memory being triggered and brought into the open when one of your senses processes a stimuli which has been associated with that memory since it was written into your hard drive. Amazing then, that the mind tricks US - itself really, by producing the illusion of the very stimuli it needs to fully access what in fact is a recent memory.<br /><br />So as I close the entry door already being engulfed in that scent, I start to experience a dopamine rush not unlike one I would get from cooking up a small crystal in the pip.. This in turn reminds me that I could feel a much more complete rush with an actual crystal in a pipe and my partner in crime on my lap....

				I think it depends on what you are looking for. My regimen of vitamins and supplements are:<br />multivitamin<br />Chelated Magnesium (heart health)<br />Garlic capsules (heart health)<br />Vitamin C <br />Vitamin B Complex (has high concentrations of several B-vitamins)<br />Additionally I also have some other antioxidant pills that I&#039;ll take to try to reduce the issues with meth<br /><br />And also I usually use nootropics when I take meth (and when I&#039;m not) and I prefer about 2g of Oxiracetam and 1g of Sulbutiamine to increase focus and energy. Aniracetam/Pramiracetam with Sulbutiamine is another combo I&#039;ve been using and is probably my second favorite to use.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;m also interested in other people&#039;s vitamin and supplement regimens because I feel I&#039;m probably missing some things. Anybody try taking a fiber supplement? Another con to meth is that it seems to really...accelerate the digestive process in a way that&#039;s not conducive to an enjoyable bowel voiding. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				I was always fairly healthy but only once I started zooming through them interwebz in search of (ice potentiators admittedly and) neuroprotectors did I realise how much nutrients do we actually lack even in the healthiest of diets...<br /><br />Magnesium, the vitamin B range, different types of anti-oxidants, etc...<br />For the most part we all survive just fine due to mainly our amazing built in resilience which allows our bodies and, most importantly, minds adjust to just about anything.<br /><br />Snoopish has mentioned most of the important supplements, my additions to these are:<br />Vitamin B3 (Niacin) in addition to a heavy B complex - aside from helping your body generate energy Bs are vital to healthy brain function<br />Vit A<br />Zinc<br />L-Tyrosine<br />L-Theanine<br />BioPqq - best taken together with CoQ10<br />CoQ10 - taken as Ubiquinol<br />Astaxanthin - Known as the most powerful anti-oxidant with strong penetration of the Blood/Brain barrier<br /><br />The above mainly assist with brain and body protection as well as faster recovery (and stronger meth effects during next use)<br /><br />I have read that Piperine can be used as a good potentiator to meth and other similar stimulants by inhibiting the production of certain enzymes which would normally reduce the effectiveness and/or length of meth/etc effects.<br /><br />I have found taking 1 or 2 tabs of BioPerine seems to lengthen the effect of ice however I caution anyone thinking of using this to read about it A LOT first. Especially if you are under some other medication etc, this may impact something else you are taking so please be careful first and foremost!<br /><br />Lastly be very choosy about what vitamins etc you buy as many will be a waste of your money. Not all vitamin compounds and/or forms absorb into your body the same way and never go for the cheapest purely based on price. Also I encourage giving oral sprays (maturity please :p ) a go as they have extreme bio-availability and very high absorption rates however are pricey.<br /><br />With Nootropics I went for Noopept and Choline combo which is interesting but too early for me to give any useful info.. Once again RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH - and don&#039;t just go by what one source tells you... :)<br /><br />Anyways feel free to ask more questions, and don&#039;t focus too much on supplementation but remember to look after your body all the same!<br /><br />

Some of those I have heard of, some I haven&#039;t, and all of them I haven&#039;t taken before (except for Niacin which I forgot to mention--it&#039;s on my shelf of supplements but one I don&#039;t take as much because my multivitamin covers the minimal daily amount). I had kept looking for this thread in my updated topics hoping somebody would give me some more supplements to look into and now I have a promising list to go off of (I know I&#039;ve heard about L-Tyrosine but that&#039;s as familiar as I get to any of those in regards to what they do and how they work). <br /><br />Very informative post with a lot of other good advice (the oral sprays I had not considered and of course researching is essential). <br /><br />Would you mind sharing your Noopept doses/regimen? I&#039;ve tried it and have not found a level in which I enjoy it. I took it at around the 30-40mg level and didn&#039;t seem to feel the effects the way other -racetams have given me and at about the 90-100mg level it didn&#039;t seem to have much impact either, and may have made me a little more scattered in terms of my thoughts. Have you had any success with combining it with others? That is something I have not experimented with much. Perhaps aniracetam/noopept? <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

While nmac retracted the assertion of &quot;junkie&quot; (props to nmac for realizing the term has a negative stigma), I think SS makes a good point in addressing the stigma surrounding meth users. I have never lost more than one night of sleep using stims and typically use on a regular basis although I usually keep my nutrient intake controlled as well as get to sleep that same night. <br /><br />However, the difference between an addict and a junkie is a line of life-quality I think. In my view, addicts can still be functioning but have problems being without their drug of choice. A junkie, to me, is someone who has begun to hurt themselves or others for their drug--selling shit, stealing, making unwise use choices (dirty needles, questionable product) because they need the drug. Addicts need the drug also, but they have not lost their values for the sake of it. <br /><br />And for completion&#039;s sake, you can be an abuser/user and simply use drugs recreationally but be in control of your habits. It may not be easy or fun to cut back/quit but you could. <br /><br />These are my definitions anyways and I think it would be a nice step forward if we could agree on a common definition for some of these terms so that we can use them without being misinterpreted (as seems to have happened here--I don&#039;t think nmac meant to be offensive [especially since he politely clarified his position] but I too would take it offensively if I was addressed as a junkie or even an addict when I see myself more as a user). <br /><br />Anyways, just did some coke so I hope I was able to write this coherently and came across well-meaning. There are people with problems using meth but that is the same with any drug (look at another thread talking about people addicted to weed). Meth is harder to control your use of than many drugs but it can still be used responsibly if one is careful. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Be careful when using the term medication: because that can be interpreted as needing to go to a doctor and have him prescribe an amphetamine complex with amphetamine salts mixed in with the sole purpose of exacerbating negative symptoms. Also, if taking into account bioavailability and RoA if I choose to administer crystal nasally as opposed to popping a pill, if those doses are equal, can that be medicinal? <br /><br />Not trying to pick your comments apart but it&#039;s easy to be misinterpreted. Being pedantic one more time, I see a difference between recreational, habitual, and therapeutic use. As an example, I may smoke some crystal with some friends tonight. That would be recreational. If I snort a line of 20mg crystal because I want to be more productive, that&#039;s therapeutic. If I have to snort a line every morning to get up, that&#039;s habitual. <br /><br />Those are again my definitions and people are welcome to have their own (clearly there are a lot of use gaps between those three examples). My main point is to continue to address that we may all actually be agreeing with each other but simply defining our terms differently. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

I tried meth for the first time in october 7 days, with 4-6 hours sleep a night. then a second time a month later , same thing 7 days, 4-6 hour sleep. Although i lift heavy, i lost quite a bit of fat/muscle as i later found out. It is great for losing fat. Then i had a bout from before christmas time to the first week of january (once again 4-9 hours sleep) . But this trip ended me up in the hospital with circulation problems, and bad vasoconstriction. Being a health enthusiast , and vitamin/herb connoisseur, i am almost always on top of the food/hydration and supplementation thing. I think on an average day i take around 15 different vitamins (yes, really) !<br /><br />Well, during that two week span i was smoking and snorting. And after the hospital visit i got sober for about a week 1/2(complete hell) , and also not knowing that 5-htp and l-tyrosine/l-dopa were godly like until much later i found out.. Anywho i noticed that SMOKING METH is the best way to get addicted to this drug, and is likely to send your life into a hole much faster than any ROA. I ended up going to my friends house and smashing my pipe with a hammer, never to come back to smoking =) Too many heart problems, and lung issues, fuck that. <br /><br />Well, getting sober and losing a bunch of muscle (3-4 pounds of muscle in that 2 week period and 10lbs) . I noticed that self-image, and my beautiful brazilian girlfriends(sluts) telling me i should be a model came into big affect.&nbsp; It really fucked with my muscles, and i thought my bones deteroriated, but i later found out that it was just a bunch of bullshit, and i am still smashing the weights.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, i am back to working out. And do i feel brain damage ....definitely not anymore than the damage i did from my past drug use, definitely not. But i have noticed drooping under my eyes, and some slight dark circles. My work schedule now, let&#039;s me get back on track, get my internal clock back to normal and whatnot. SO , working out and getting back into physical shape and pounding out the gym is amazing. I highly reccomend it when NOT on meth. <br /><br />thank you for this post snoopish &amp; qeu. <br /><br />pros: talking is a natural form without the anxiety<br />energy is phenomenal<br />confidence is incredible<br />picking up women = 100x better<br />i rather take meth than mdma at a club, although the combo is amazing<br /><br />cons: muscle loss<br />weight loss<br />pychosis<br />knowing it is a devil drug (not cool)<br />hard to hide meth use at work<br />skin damage<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Meth is terrible for your health.&nbsp; There are many less toxic stimulants out there.&nbsp; 3-FA and 4-FA come to mind as options.&nbsp; The high from these is probably not as nice as meth, but they&#039;re far less likely to rob you of your health and well being.

				I&#039;ve been thinking about that lately, and I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that methamphetamine really is worse than amphetamine; just not for the obvious reasons.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s significantly more neurotoxic (not from my subjective experience, and there are a number of studies that agree -- also ones that disagree though), but when you take the amounts that I do orally these days, it ends up lasting a fucking long, long, *long* time.&nbsp; With amphetamine I end up on my way down if I don&#039;t redose every 2-3 hours.&nbsp; But once I&#039;m on a run and a good amount of meth has built up in my blood from repeating moderate doses, it just hangs out in my blood hour after hour after hour.&nbsp; I mean it&#039;s 6-8 hours before I really feel like it&#039;s about to slip away from me sometimes.&nbsp; That&#039;s nearly three times the duration of amphetamine at high dosages.<br /><br />That translates to longer runs, much less rest when I finally do get to sleep because there&#039;s more amphetamine still disrupting my natural cycles, and if I take really large doses of meth I almost feel like I&#039;ll go into convulsions sometimes.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t happen with &quot;pure&quot; (pharmaceutical grade) amphetamine, but sometimes on meth I get these full body chills/spasms that rip through me and leave me with an intense dizziness for a second or two.&nbsp; I have no idea why.&nbsp; None whatsoever.<br /><br />Yes... I know.&nbsp; That could be bad.&nbsp; It could even be as bad as things can get, maybe.&nbsp; Honestly I&#039;ve been at this for so long I think I&#039;m damn lucky to be in such good health :)&nbsp; Besides, I think I&#039;ll be okay for the time being.&nbsp; My feeling is that I&#039;m just walking the thin line between my health crumbling and being able to maintain at this level for awhile longer.&nbsp; Yes, I know I can stop.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t want to for now -- and that&#039;s that.&nbsp; I mean God forbid I actually get out while I might still be fine &amp; die of old age, right?!&nbsp; &nbsp;:P&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know; it is what it is.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll stop someday.&nbsp; Or drop dead from acute myocardial infarction, one or the other.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty uncomfortable talking about it frankly, but... well, I don&#039;t think I would have made any different choices if I had known that years of amphetamine abuse were going to start damaging me in ways that I can&#039;t even find other examples of... hey, at least it&#039;s only on the inside still, lol.&nbsp; If I didn&#039;t eat a healthy diet and spend half of my time working my brain, I think I&#039;d be long gone by now.&nbsp; Gotta keep learning, studying, anything at all to replace some of those neural connections I burn away.&nbsp; Seriously!&nbsp; If it helps stave off alzheimer&#039;s for awhile longer, I don&#039;t see why it wouldn&#039;t help stave off total meth burnout too.&nbsp; I&#039;m not joking, look it up: learning and developing new skills is a tremendous help in keeping alzheimer&#039;s and dementia at bay.<br /><br />... So anyway; I&#039;ve had enough of this woe-is-me shit for now -- no more being the poster boy for why meth abuse is bad tonight.&nbsp; Do what you like with the information, whatever that may be.<br /><br />tl;dr: yeah, I think meth is worse than amphetamine.&nbsp; But again, not for the reasons you might think.

				I&#039;m glad my countless nights staying up tweaking while researching supplements etc can help others as well :)<br />You don&#039;t even have to be taking any kind of stim/etc drugs to benefit from a lot of these as the food most people eat contains nowhere near enough nutrients for a healthy body.<br /><br />Forgot to mention another thing that&#039;s possibly even more beneficial overall than most of the other supplements put together - Vital Greens or Spirulina. Also sold as Wheat Grass.<br /><br />Essentially ground up dark green leafy vegetables that you can scoop into a shake or just drink with water etc... The list of the different vitamins, minerals and nutrients contained in each spoon is amazing and I&#039;m confident this on its own does more good than all of the other supps... I usually mix mine with a scoop of protein, ground flaxseed and heaps of some kind of juicy fruit (blueberries/kiwis/etc) which help to mask the flavour of the green plus of course add its own goodness.. perfect as breakfast or in the middle of a prolonged tweak to keep your body fueled!<br /><br />Lastly, whenever I see mention that something is &quot;Clinically tested&quot; I don&#039;t know whether to laugh or cry.. Specific drug examples aside, do you really believe the Pharmaceutical industry&#039;s goal is to help Mankind? Yes - but only the portion of Mankind who hold shares within that Pharma company. Can&#039;t really be bothered expanding on this, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one with this mindset.<br /><br />*** edit<br />Sorry Snoopish forgot to answer your Nootropics question..<br /><br />I started off taking 10mg Noopept with 100mg Choline in the morning but couldn&#039;t tell you if I felt anything different...<br /><br />Then read up a bit more and found people usually notice a difference after consistently taking 30-40mg daily which I&#039;ve now started doing.<br />I have felt a few interesting effects, but prefer to give it some more time to eliminate the dozens of other factors that can influence results... I can say with certainty though - Noopept is the single most vile tasting thing I have ever eaten so I&#039;m waiting for some gel caps to cap the shit up... Also make sure you take all Racetams and/or Noopept (which isn&#039;t technically a racetam apparently) with Choline which helps absorption. I also wouldn&#039;t recommend going over 40mg daily of noopept from other people&#039;s experiences - scattered, irritable, libido reduced - some of the effects..<br /><br />Play safe :)

				Con : neurotoxicity<br /><br />Same goes for mdma - Basically why I only do coke not meth or mdma, from the studies i&#039;ve read it appears meth &amp; mdma&nbsp; neurotoxicity is alot more significant and perhaps permanent than coke. On the other hand, chronic coke use has the potential for cardiac issues however at the end of the day I will preserve my mental health before anything else.

				..so if heroin is less neurotoxic than cocaine should we all kick the meth habit for a smack habit?<br />...dont think frequency =neurotoxicity but yeah for sure you could snort blow 4times a week and get away with it for months on end maybe meth a few times&nbsp; and mdma even less so.

				Pros,<br />&nbsp;Having access to all the intelligence stashed in your brain, it makes me so smart. My uke and guitar playing go from mundane to inspired, at first, thought this was me being high but have recorded sessions and with editing there is no doubt about the improvement. Some good lyrics and pros&nbsp; Sexually adventurous in action normally in thought only. Been thinking about big&nbsp; &nbsp;backyard project but no action and then... chainsaw is out, ladder up, hanging arse 8mtr up and lovin it. Got a richter scale hangover, gone by the 3rd lungfull.<br />Cons<br />Denied all access to any intelligence locked away in brain.After 10ish hours can get stuck on same riff, can right some good lines but the path goes bush. Slight problem, when wifes best friend took clothes off in front of me forgot to be cool and wife saw my eyes popin from pleasure and is now jealous. Now have a huge pile of tree that has to be tacken away and a whole on the fence line has to be filled.<br /><br />The high is so complete that all previously fun drugs are no longer required, the high is so complete that previously other fun things to do are no longer required. The low spot come down is complete and holds like glue untill you have slept and eaten, then 10 days of the living dead until your brain calls out &#039;&#039; get them now, bak in stock, dopamine, serotonin etc&#039;&#039; 25mins after that announcement, the sweet whisper starts, lets get high, I have a win[willpower] loss[ scored no matter] of about 2/1000.<br /><br />When you get away and stop or you stay and your dealer moves states,&nbsp; seems to be a sentence served in purgatory, no color, no joy, no wonder, no laugh, empty flat lands. Then awareness of your body, aches and feelings of tiredness, wear and tear issues. Then your teeth start up, grinding, dry mouth and chemicals that eat calcium have turned your mouth into a personal loan if you want it back.<br />The affair were having has not been sanctioned by the universe, your daughters and your wife is not ok you have been breaking her heart. The women you have been loving is using you as an emotional/sexual husband removal service and is the most expensive sex you have ever had....<br /><br />The cons can be a litany of heavy lifting but qualify as life lived intensely. These experiences were achieved using Meth or top shelf speed 3 times a week for about 4 years, the previous 5 years about once a week with no meth and no extreme down times.<br />Eat whole foods, drink lots of water, dont always use benzos for sleep, exercise up to aerobic, 14 days between sessions, limit booze and chuff. <br />Recognize if you are prone to any of the Mental illness symptoms, meth is and can be permanently damaging to some minds.<br /><br />There you go<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Pros:<br />The drug is very potent. The high is amazing and lasts very long.<br />Your dopamine availability is much higher than that of other transmitters.<br />Your body restores in no-time from the temporal damage caused.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The comedown is noticeable.<br />You feel the low dopamine levels for at least 1-2 days.<br />It&#039;s highly psychologically addictive.<br /><br />You need a very strong mind to resist on taking more, especially while and directly after coming down.<br />In bad times you may be looking for the drug, but overall it can be dealt with.<br />I guess abuse will reward negatively and casual use requires a lot of mental strength.<br />You need a lot of self control and then it can be used recreational or even regularly.<br />If one cannot be happy otherwise then addiction may be on its way.<br /><br />After a lot of abuse long-term and short breaks the body gets too little chance to restore and the physical damage to transmitters may cause a lasting state of depression. <br /><br />Also the quality and purity varies greatly and its variation is noticed a lot, but I guess this counts for most other drugs on the road.<br /><br />Own perspective and experience...<br /><br />Crystal Meth is good &lt;3

Also, you may not snort Adderall but meth might tempt you more. <br /><br />Meth can be a dangerous drug but if you can be careful I would say you&#039;d end up preferring it to Adderall. <br /><br />Please ask many questions, do your homework, and consider what you are looking for before diving into the crystalline world of meth.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Snoopish i would like to interject on the fact that it is possible to work on a stable basis and be on meth.<br /><br />-I abused adderall for over two years a while back. -<br /><br />If you work in a hotel, or convention center, or back offices for instance:<br /><br />usually it is dark and dimly lit, making the paranoia to be in the vicinity of light asap<br />co-workers may think that since the pupils are moon circled that &quot;he must be on drugs&quot; (srs)<br />the pupil dilation is enormous, alike mdma/lsd. can not compare meth v adderall in these terms.<br /><br />think about it from a non-drug users stand point. they can suspect anything i suppose, as long as you don&#039;t talk a fuck load and are able to function and work normally, okay. but the paranoia/anxiety that you can bring out within a work setting can be hectic on your body.<br /><br />i have contributed here to this thread before but will do it again:<br /><br />pros:<br />extreme energy<br />music is king, enjoy it more than mdma<br />sextasy on meth , my god<br />talking about amazing things to random people<br />in-depth, introspective/insightful conversations with friends<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />once abused, you lose the i can conquer the world feeling<br />once abused, you lose the magic euphoria of meth<br />can be a very anti-social drug (anyone notice this?)<br />muscle loss/weight loss, no matter how much you eat while on it<br />tweaking isn&#039;t really that fun, don&#039;t stay up past 45 hours or so.

				@TacoDisco: +1 to you for accurate and insightful post. I&#039;ve never noticed my pupils being especially large on adderall or meth but it may be the kind of thing that varies between people/batches, etc. <br /><br />I have noticed the anti-social thing: I think it&#039;s mostly when I begin coming down and sometimes it seems to depend on how much I&#039;ve been using -- sometimes I&#039;m enthusiastically interacting with people and other times I&#039;m withdrawn. <br /><br />The conversations though -- man I&#039;ve had some great conversations on meth. You can really have some energetic, insightful discourse. Me and a good buddy were doing lines and must have talked for 2-3 hours nonstop and it was great. That&#039;s a big plus in my book. <br /><br />I&#039;m currently taking about a month off because my tolerance had went up and the effects weren&#039;t as great. It is a hard drug to part with once you&#039;ve begun to appreciate the joys. <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				I get no euphoria at all from meth just get a painful jaw and a constant desire to re-dose. Its not for me that&#039;s for sure. Also makes me very dizzy when I stand up (almost blacked out). I wont be using again.

This may include the absence of Euphoria.

				pro: feels good, man!<br />con: highly addictive...<br /><br />my advice is only bother with meth if you have strong self-control. otherwise it can be a quick downward spiral.
