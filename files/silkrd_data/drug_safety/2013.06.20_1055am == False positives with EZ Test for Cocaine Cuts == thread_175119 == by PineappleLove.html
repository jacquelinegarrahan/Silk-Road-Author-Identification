				As some of you know I regularly post lab test results of cocaine sold by vendors on SR. I&#039;d like to share my experiences with the EZ test for Cocaine Cuts because it appears I got some false positives. The EZ Test for cocaine cuts should test for levamisole, phenacetine and ephedrine (see eztest.com).<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the EZ test for cocaine cuts on two samples that were lab analyzed and came back as adulterant free. With both samples I got the same results. After adding approximately 10 mg of cocaine to one of the testtubes the yellow substance turned into a colour I&#039;d put somewhere inbetween the colourindicators of phenacetine and ephedrine. You can find a chart with the colours at the EZ test website (http://eztest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cocaine-cuts.png). I always make sure to use clean tools when handling the samples. The sample size is really small so I can&#039;t claim with a high certainty the test is faulty but I do reckon that caution is warranted. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried the test on a sample that contains levamisole, I will when I come across a sample that contains levamisole. I&#039;m very interested in hearing your experiences with the EZ Test for cocaine cuts! And it would be great to hear from someone with knowledge about chemistry why the test could possibly give a false positive.

				im also curios about those tests.<br /><br />yesterday i testet the same cocain twice. once i got a very dark brownish reaction, once a ephedrine like reaction.&nbsp; You recently tested it and it is supposed to have no active cuts. ofc its not steril here or anything but i tried to make it as clean as possible. <br /><br />i personally think its good and i cant notice any cuts...weird<br />
