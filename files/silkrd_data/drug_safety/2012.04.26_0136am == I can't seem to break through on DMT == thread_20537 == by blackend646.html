				I&#039;ve tried a few times now and I haven&#039;t been able to achieve a breakthrough. I&#039;ve had 2 really intense trips with vivid hallucinations and definitely saw these entities people talk about, but I haven&#039;t been able to have that out of body experience. The problem is I&#039;m running out of product and would be really bummed if I used it all up and never broke through. Would it pretty much guarantee me a breakthrough if I just dumped 1/8 tsp or so into my pipe and ripped it? From what I understand DMT isn&#039;t likely to harm you physically, the only thing stopping me is fear that it won&#039;t work and I&#039;ll have just wasted even more product for nothing.

				I would hardly say doing more would be a waste unless it failed to produce more effects. I&#039;m no scientist but I would say doing more would certainly help in achieving a breakthrough as you would be absorbing more. Either way, it&#039;ll be a worthwhile adventure. Don&#039;t be in such a rush by the way, even if you toast the last of your stash, you can always save up to try again later. Patience is a virtue.

				Then you obviously have never tried 5-meo-DMT. Trust me, you WILL break through and you will probably piss your pants. I GUARANTEE this will do it. Typical dose is about 10-15 mg. Try 30 mg. Hold tight and make sure you freebase it.

				I read that 5-meo doesn&#039;t give you visuals though? I&#039;m not really clear on the difference between the two.

Some people say that 5-meo is more visual, or that it&#039;s less, or that it&#039;s impossible to break through on, or that it&#039;s easier... You get conflicting reports all the time. It depends on your body chemistry.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had trouble breaking through on 60mg of DMT. Maybe you&#039;re just not doing enough, or not holding the smoke in your lungs long enough.
