				I bought some MDMA off the road recently and ive had some very bad times since. This is the exact truth and i am not out to hurt any mdma vendors rep. I am actually posting this to see if anyone else had had the same reaction because im thinking it might be just me and my chemically unbalanced brain causing the issues.<br /><br />I wont say who it is from. It was bought in March from a vendor who seemed legit and i received the product in escrow.<br /><br />I dont know if it was mda, or mdea, or some mdxx possibility as I really have no experience or way of chemically testing it. <br /><br />It was gram, heavy with the bag. The product was white with small crystals. There was some powder in the bag but could be considered small crystals as its hard to tell. The taste test did not remind me of mdma. I havent tripped in a long time prior to this, but the last time i tripped some 10 years ago, was on pure mdma that tasted very distinctively, and this did not taste the same. This was bitter and similar to mdma, but was salty and slightly different. I dosed about 100mg my first dose and proceeded to trip balls.<br /><br />The trip reminded me of an acid trip as the walls were breathing and changing colors with each breath. There was no lovey dovey feeling of mdma, and i began to panic as the trip increased. I ran to the bathroom and vomited violently for a half an hour. As i puked i began to think how stupid i was for trusting silkroad and some person who i did not know and I began having a panic attack. I looked at myslef in the mirror and my pupils were so dilated i could not tell what color my eyes were.<br /><br />I was home alone and my wife was visiting family. She knew about the order so i told her my situation and she reassured me i would be okay and to relax. I was able to calm down but still was so high that i could not relax. I took an anti psychotic that I had laying around and when it kicked in i slept for 8 or so hours. I awoke feeling run down and hungover.<br /><br />I puked again and ate some soup and took a multi-vitamin.<br /><br />This was my first experience on this gram. I still had plenty and took a break after this bad trip. My wife wanted to trip, but because i was worried i denied her any. I took some a week later this time about 50mg poured in my drink. Came up feeling pretty happy and upped the dose. I ingested about 150mg this night over a period of 3 hours. The trip was manageable but i still vomited twice. I went to sleep around 5am that day and woke up an hour later sweating and with my heart rate extremely high. I woke up my wife and told her i had taken more. She got pissed and told me i would be ok. I made it through the night but felt extremely sick and loaded with anxiety.<br /><br />I was convinced this shit was sketchy but gave a friend a small dose of around 50mg. He enjoyed it and felt the effects strong enough to not want anymore for the whole night! I kept trying to offer more but he declined saying he was tripping balls from the small amount i gave him! I still have doubts about this as my friend is a known bullshitter who is capable of bullshit for sure. The only thing that bothers me is that i offered him free drugs and he wouldnt take them! This dude is the most drug hungry fiend i know and he still declined after the initial dose!<br /><br />So i was still confused about the potency at this point to say the least. I figured i had pure shit that was fire and at this point i still had over half the bag left! I made up some gel caps and continued to believe it was mdma. I sold some of it to a friend who took it. He loved it and told me shit was great except that he threw up as well! I warned him to go easy and he slowly increased his dose through the night. He to this day said he loved it and wants more. <br /><br />At this point i was thinking it must be me and my chemical imbalances. Maybe i just wasnt allowed to enjoy mdma anymore. I should mention that i did abuse the shit back in my late teenage years and contiuned this abuse for a few years. I decided to take it again a week later. I had no problems during the night and felt really good. I dosed in small increments (10 to 20mg snorted) until i felt good. I ended up using approx 150 mg this night as well. I felt good all night and fell asleep after the trip came down. I woke up an hour later and proceeded to projectile vomit for some of the worst hours of my life. I was puking and shitting at the same time. All the while I had extreme cramps in my intestinal area. After hours of torture I shit one last time and laid back down. Fell asleep for an hour and woke up and puked and shit again! This happened for the rest of the day. I vomited over five times and shit countless times. After a week of rest i am feeling fine again. <br /><br />I am sitting on my couch looking at the last 100mg or so...I dont know what to do. I really think this shit is fucking me up. I dont think its mdma at all but probably some mdxx. I never tasted anything mdma that tasted like this. I will remind you that I havent tripped on mdma since the late 90s. Ad the last legitimate&nbsp; trip i had was on 300mg of pure mdma that was spaced out in 3 100mg gel caps. I have attempted to trip since then, but i received bunk ass shit that i knew immediately was not mdma. <br /><br />Is anyone else in the same boat as me that remembers the good old days of mdma where you felt nothing but bliss! This is what i was loking for and got the exact opposite! I guess the reason for this post is to see if anyone else can relate to me. I feel like im poisoned on all the x ive done since the late 90s early 2000s. I mean that bitter taste i would get when i put the hit in my mouth has not been in any of the shit ive done in the past almost 10 years!<br /><br />This is a crazy long post, and thanks for reading. I just want to know if its me, or if other people are experiencing the same effects. I mean this shit isnt fun. I felt like i was dying! Thats not ecstacy! So did i ingest some suspect shit, or am i just so far chemically imbalanced that i will never be able to enjoy that mdma feeling again? <br /><br />Thanks again for reading this any any responses.&nbsp; <br />

				Daamn that sounds wild, sorry to hear that. I have enjoyed the MDMA I recently received and plan on trying others (might wanna know where you went for yours to avoid similar experience).

				I think OP posted this here by accident. See original thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17593.0<br /><br />He was taking SSRIs, which may be the reason he experienced such a dysphoric, inhibited reaction to the molly.

				Reagent test kits are cheap.&nbsp; Always, always test everything before ingesting it.&nbsp; Even with reagent testing, it&#039;s not 100% guaranteed to be what you think it is, but you mitigate your risk substantially.&nbsp; If you value your life/sanity greater than $50, then you need to get a set of reagents.<br /><br />https://www.dancesafe.org/

				Hi People, <br /><br />Look.&nbsp; I know some stuff.&nbsp; Chemistry stuff and brain stuff.&nbsp; I know a lot of peeps here on the road and they&#039;re stuff is good.&nbsp; If it&#039;s making you sick, I&#039;ll jump the gun for a sec and presuppose it has something to do with you&#039;re body-chemistry interacting with various serotonin and dopamine levels in your head. We do a ton of x and yes, I&#039;ve seen a few problems with my people, however, it has to do with drug and food interactions (my reasoning) rather than the drug itself. If you&#039;re insistent I would suggest preloading with HTP. Or not do it and try something else. Know your body and know your mind.<br /><br />Peace and Entropy,<br />DiMiTri

				sounds to me like you got mda instead of mdma. dosage is similar, but mda is much more psychedelic than mdma, and also less predictable. i actually had the same experience a few weeks ago, but it was a wonderful surprise for me. tripping when you&#039;re not expecting it can definitely be hellish.

				yeah. pure m shouldn&#039;t alter your vision in a psychedelic kinda way, at most just enhance it, make it feel more intense.

				I don&#039;t think it would hurt the reputation of a vendor. Actually, I believe you should share who you purchased from in case other buyers have adverse trips too. I&#039;d prefer not to purchase MDMA if I were to receive what you did. However, it is true that everyone reacts differently to different substances.

				Alcohol + MDMA + SRRI&#039;s sounds like worst combination ever, all that would make me pretty sick as well.
