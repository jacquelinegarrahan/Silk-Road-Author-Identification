				So, I recently got started with vaping with an e-cigarette after I quit smoking. And the first thing the vapor reminded me of was when I used to smoke meth...oh the good old days. Then, since the flavor was a menthol with the cooling sensation, when I french-inhaled it (exhale through mouth and inhale vapor through nose) it felt cool...and kinda numbing for a second. And you can guess what that reminded me of.<br /><br />According to wikipedia, cocaine has a melting point of 208 F and a boiling point of 369 F. Meth seems to be a little higher. Well, you probably know where this is going by now...regardless, I&#039;ll just say it: Is it worth trying to mix in some cola or crystal into my e-liquid and vaping it? If it fucks up the atomizer I can just replace it for a few dollars, and this just seems like too great an idea for me to pass up. I mean, jesus christ, people vape these things inside restaurants and schools, how great would it be to do the same...but with COCAINE? (Yes, I know getting high in public is not a good idea, and I&#039;m not seriously considering it.) <br /><br />Is this a bad idea? I don&#039;t want to become &quot;that guy who killed himself smoking coke&quot; but coke+menthol= a great combination (jn theory).

				its worth a shot but just remember how its smoked in a crack pipe! it takes a while just to master a cracky so i dont thinka e-cig will be as good as a cracky....haha<br /><br />being smoked in a crack pipe allows you to put the correct amount off heat on it to vape without buring it and u can also roll it a little if need be.<br /><br />just try a little bit and get back on to us on the results. ;)<br /><br />im keen to hear how it works for ya mate.

				I suppose there are options here. E-cigs are relatively new, but have been used to take cannabis. Using them to smoke meth or coke does not seem far fetched at all. I have no experience doing so, but i think it should be possible to use them for such purposes. <br /><br />I suppose it would just require experimentation to see how well this works - the solvent for e-cigs usuallly is&nbsp; something like ethylene or propylane glycol, both of which would allow you to disssolve meth and coke.
