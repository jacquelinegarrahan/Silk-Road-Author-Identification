				Title: <strong>4-aco-dmt fumarate or hcl?</strong><br />

				I recently picked up some 4-aco-dmt and to my surprise i found a nice bit of both the fumarate and the hcl packaged and labeled separately. I am really pretty new to Rcs and I want to make sure I understand the differences in the two before I proceed. Is there a benefit to one or the other, or can they be equally dosed? would one last longer than the other in cold storage? is one more water soluble than the other? I have been looking around, and I have seen some mention to them but not really an explanation of the differences. And please before anyone gives an answer, just know that I am not a chemist, aspiring or otherwise. <br /><br />thanks in advance<br />wretched

				really it just is from which acid was used to salt out from the non-aqueous layer. <br /><br />the biggest difference is the fumurate molecule has a larger molecular weight, compared to the measly hydrogen and chloride, so the actual accurate dosage should be adjusted slightly to compensate: (stolen from coolio, d-f)<br />&nbsp;<br />-AcO-DMT freebase has a molar mass of 246. Fumaric acid has a molar mass of 116. Hydrochloric acid has a molar mass of 36.46.<br /><br />2000mg of 4-AcO-DMT HCl is therefore equivalent to 1703mg of 4-AcO-DMT freebase.<br />2000mg of 4-AcO-DMT fumarate is equivalent to 1057mg of 4-AcO-DMT freebase.<br />2000mg of 4-AcO-DMT fumarate is equivalent to 1241mg of 4-AcO-DMT HCl.<br /><br />To calculate an equipotent dosage of the Hcl salt to those who are using the 4-AcO-DMT fumarate salt you would multiply their dose by 0.62. <br /><br />Also, both the salts are going to be fairly stable, and 4-aco is relatively stable overall anyway. Generally the fumarate is common due to its long term storage potential but I think both would be fine. <br /><br />4-aco is definitely one I really want to try, enjoy it! <br />- miR

				thank you for the quick responce. Just to make sure I understand the math, I should take 62% of a fumarate dose when using hcl. to for dosage testing, fumarate seems better since lower potency by weight is easier to gradually increase to find the sweet spot, then once that has been found, the hcl would be roughlt 60% of that.&nbsp; &nbsp;thanks!

				i really want to try this, and was wondering if there are any possible negative side effects with the trip? any nausea or heavy body load?

Mine is Freebase though so it&#039;s much stronger than the HCL or Fumarate salts.
