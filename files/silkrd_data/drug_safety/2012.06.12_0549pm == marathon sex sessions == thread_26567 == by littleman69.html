				Whats the best drug for marathon sex sessions (this includes asexual action :)) in your opinion?<br /><br />cant beat pure coke (if you can get it) for making you feel horny and wanting to go all night on this side.

				I think quality is more important than quantity (length). <br />It&#039;s been the labrat&#039;s empirical observation that: <br /><br />* long-lasting sex: opis/LSD (very pronounced delay in ejaculation, but not that &quot;sexual&quot;) <br />* best sex: GHB+cialis followed by (IV) MA&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />Coke&#039;s too short-lasting once it hits the nasal passages, and in combination with G, the latter usually wins.&nbsp; <br />There&#039;s also less of that dirty animal sex feeling on coke compared to MA.<br /><br />Mephedrone definitely carries a prize too. <br />* much more forgiving than MDPV (no paranoia/tachycardia)<br />* less lovey than methylone (sometimes preferable) <br />* relatively short-lasting (for those who want to be done with their binge and asleep in t&lt;12hrs)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Amphetamine, makes your &#039;little man&#039; a little bit smaller but prolongs ejaculation by many hours.<br />MDMA same effects as Amphetamine but with a nice euphoria &amp; sensitivity to it ;D&nbsp; <br /><br />My fav is phet tho, really keeps you going. On MDMA you tend to just start cuddling and all that sooner.

				The 2 times I have taken 25I I have not really enjoyed it like I enjoy LSD or mescaline but it did give my partner and I some of the most intense and pleasurable sex we have ever had. An extremely erotic drug for me with astounding orgasm control. Probably the only time I would take it again would be before an orgy or sex marathon.

				Foxy is the best drug I have ever done for sex. It beat MDMA, shrooms, coke, meth, and everything else out of the water by far for me. Every thrust gave me chills and an orgasmic feeling throughout my body. It also made the girl I was with who way beautiful anyway look like she was glowing as if she was a goddess of beauty. It was unworldly. I can&#039;t even really put how amazing my experience was with 5-MEO-DiPT.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got mine in a form of a pill that was given to me as ecstacy, but thanks to pillreports and actually doing real ecstacy I know what the drug was. It did ruin actual MDMA for me as it was nothing compared to what I got off of that pill with around 20 mg 5-MEO-DiPT in it.

				Coke has NEVER been a sexual stimulant for me. I couldn&#039;t be less interested in sex when I&#039;m zooted. I just want to smoke cigarettes and talk about everything. <br /><br />I do tend to get frisky off pills though....and either I can fuck for an hour and feel like a wyld stallyn, or I fuck for an hour and can&#039;t actually cum and I finally just collapse from exhaustion, but at least my girl is satisfied.

				MDA - Hands down!<br /><br />Definitely, a close relative to meth only gives a guy the &#039;John Holmes&#039; tool (like in his first films before he started doing cocaine), the ability to cum repeatedly without loosing that tool and a mind so incredibly filthy that EVERYTHING is not just alright. Both female and male alike can immediately do anything and everything with anyone and everyone, without guilt or feelings of misgivings that we social animals (in America anyway) are taught and threatened or tricked into believing that NOT acting so promiscuous and naughty is in any way wrong.<br /><br />I have pictures, lol!<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m trying to remember if when I was in my 20&#039;s I could get it up on Molly, but fuck, last week I was rolling on my day off and needed some skin, so I went for a R&amp;T which involved a lot of R&#039;ing and not so much T&#039;ing hahaha!<br /><br />Still, when your whole body feels like your cock, who cares!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Historically though, the weirdest most full on sexytime I&#039;ve had has been LSD, so I gotta vote for that.

				Another vote for MDA / 6-APB here too.<br /><br />Utterly soul melting sex.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />And marathon sessions here mean that we just lose ourselves in the substance and then consciously lose ourselves in each other. We&#039;ll stop lots, laugh lots and generally get very hot and sticky. <br /><br />For those who are so inclined, seriously explore combining this with tantric yoga or other subtle energy practices. Helps with refraction time too.<br /><br />

I have trouble getting an erection. Plus in all honesty sex wouldn&#039;t live up to how it makes me feel. Same with all opiates/heroin. MDAa/MDMA are my favorite drugs though.<br /><br />Speed, coke, and meth make me into a animal.. more primal... and sex is all that is on my mind. Once I get going nothing else matters .... i&#039;ve never had trouble getting an erection with these drugs. <br /><br />If someone want to send me a gram of meth i will video myself having sex with escorts, masturbating, and maintaining an erection for 3-4 days :) I can still do it, no problem.<br /><br /><br /><br />
