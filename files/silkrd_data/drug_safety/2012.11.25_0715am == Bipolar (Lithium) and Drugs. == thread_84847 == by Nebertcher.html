Try a dissociative like ketamine or MXE. Those might actually benefit you.

				Personally, I would stay away from all drugs while on lithium. <br /><br />Don&#039;t know much about pharmacology, but Ketamine and Lithium both work on the sodium and calcium channels in the central nervous system. I wouldn&#039;t chance it.<br /><br />You&#039;ve only got one brain. Best not to fuck it up. Lithium isn&#039;t a very safe drug to mix anything with.

				I appreciate the advice you guys!&nbsp; I really do I looked into it also and I found that Ketamine would be a bad idea...Do you guy know any alternatives to Litium that I could switch to so that I could explore a larger variety?&nbsp; I also plan on buying weed regardless.

				The only other thing I can think of that you might be prescribed is an Anti-Psychotic?<br />These can effect your experience on psychedelics in different ways.

				They put me on lamictal as a mood stabilizer. Not sure if that&#039;s lithium but you could look into it. <br /><br />But honestly if you have some mental disorders psychedelics may not be your DOC, ya know? I&#039;ve got a weird mental health history and my trips...well it kinda sucks a lot sometimes lol.

				The mood-stabilizers, anti-psychotics and anti-depressants I&#039;m on seem to stop me from being able to trip on LSD despite repeated attempts. Mushrooms effects seem to have been blunted too. I would say give psychedelics a miss as the other poster said.

				yeah dude, you might want to stay away from psychedelics. Try dissociative instead ie: MXE, Ketamine, DXM etc. Not PCP though. Fuck that shit.

				&quot;warning clearnet link&quot;<br />&quot;http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/lithium.html&quot;<br /><br />Most of the stuff is out. everything hallucinogenic and stimulant is bad for someone with a mental disorder! <br />Maybe benzos and opiates?&nbsp; if you can get something that also comes in a form of prescription medication you can use that website above to check for interaction.<br />Maybe you could ask your doctor to put you on something else?

It was an absolutely non-claustrophobic experience that said ‘you can live here.’ And I was absolutely happy to do it,” Dreyfuss says. “I married with it. I had children with it. I reclaimed a career if you want to put it that way.”

				Although it has been said countless times, just steer clear of using drugs while taking Lithium with or without any other medications. From personal experience and having some severe clinical depression and anxiety issues, the Lithium and SSRI trials that I was put through almost made me end my life. Stupid me even tried rolling hoping to take the edge off during all of this and woke up the next day with the worst migraine ever after feeling nothing from the MDMA. I hope you find answers to your issues without medication one day.

				I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 with psychotic features when I was 18.. they hospitalized me, and medicated me, and monitored me for about 18 months before I realized that the &quot;medication&#039; that they kept feeding me (lithium, zyprexa, abilify, lorazepam, depakote, zoloft) was literally destroying my mind and body.. so I skipped town in the dark of night and never looked back&nbsp; 8)<br />Years later looking back i would say that my saviors have been pot, ecstasy, psychedelics, a positive attitude, and lots of personal examination. Today I am off meds still, and for all that it has cost me to get where I am it&#039;s worth it to never go back to those monsters in the mental health system. I&#039;ll spare you all the telling.. but I&#039;ve got a mile of stories illustrating how the psychiatric field today is worse than Mrs Ratchet in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest could ever be.<br />If your doctor ever ever offers you lithium or zyprexa walk out of his fucking office.. seriously. :(
