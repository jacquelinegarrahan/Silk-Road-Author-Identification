				Hi there, <br /><br />Myself and a few friends are going to try coke for the first time, I purchased off Mercury31. His coke seems to be good. <br /><br />We have a few queries, <br /><br />1 What are the main effects of coke, we have heard Confidence and euphoria?<br />2. Is a nightclub a good setting to take coke?<br />3. What sort of dosages would you recommend?<br />4. How long does Coke last?<br />5. Can you sleep after, or would you recommend Benzos?<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Many thanks.

				1. Yes. Don&#039;t forget to stand in front of a mirror and tell everyone how good you look. <br />2. Do you like dancing with scantly clad women? Will you like it when you are twice as fucking awesome as you are now?!? Haha, nightclub should be fun.<br />3. I dunno, do a 25-50mg line and see how it goes, repeat as desired once you know how it affects you. It&#039;s entirely probably I have never had as good coke as you&#039;re about to get, so I can&#039;t give an exact dosage, just be careful. <br />4. Depends how much you do. I would say somewhere in between an hour or so and whenever you decide to stop/run out.<br />5. Really depends on how much you do/how long before bed you stop. Coke comedown can be shitty, I always like to have benzos around, no matter what.

				Cocaine at a nightclub can be a bit tricky because you&#039;ll probably wanting more every hour or less, and sometimes security can be patrolling the washrooms trying to catch people doing lines. Crush it up nicely before you go to the club, and either bring a key for bumps right out of the bag or a small straw and a flat surface (Iphone or similar works well) for lines. <br /><br />Coke and alcohol can be a super fun combo, but it puts extra strain on your heart so try not to go overboard on either if you combine the two.

				<br /><br />1. I always get an uplifting feeling, but it seems to be all downhill after the first few lines.. especially when I&#039;m railing lines at a club. <br />I&#039;ve done around a kilo in my day, so the effects have changed now from how great they used to be. So to say coke will always be fun if you don&#039;t let yourself get all twacked out <br /><br />2. Nightclub was the first place I ever did coke. free little keys bumps in the bathroom get passed around like std&#039;s in some of my favourite ol&#039; clubs. <br /><br />3. Take 50mg bumps <br /><br />4. The high for me lasts maybe half an hour. I&#039;d quit after a couple lines and start over the next day if I want, to avoid having to up my dosage as my tolerance starts to go up.. just ends up being a waste of good candy unless you really space it out. <br /><br />5. Benzos will be your best friend as with pretty much any other upper to killswitch your high.. good thing bars are super cheap on here ;D<br /><br />have fun and don&#039;t get too yipped out!!!!!<br /><br />

Is a nightclub a good setting to take coke?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t have much experience using coke in clubs but I&#039;d imagine it is if you can do it without gettin caught.&nbsp; Most of the clubs here have a bouncer chilling in the restrooms though so it could be pretty obvious depending on where you go.&nbsp; Some people use a nasal spray technique though to get their bumps.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. What sort of dosages would you recommend?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you don&#039;t know how strong the batch is start low, 25mg, then titrate upwards and see how comfortable you feel with each amount.&nbsp; Some people have more intense reactions to it at lower doses, find your comfort zone but always start low and figure out what you can handle and what feels &quot;right&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. How long does Coke last?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The full high from dose to peak, to the crash is about 40m-1h or so total, but around 20min you&#039;re probably gonna start itching for another bump.&nbsp; 30min is manageable but you&#039;ll be up and down a lot if you wait too long, and it can be kind of uncomfortable going from high to low all night like that.&nbsp; I tend to start with a 100mg line split into two and then do 50mg bumps 20-30min apart for a couple hours and then I&#039;m good for the night usually (helps me get motivated to clean house, get things done).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5. Can you sleep after, or would you recommend Benzos?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d say stop coking up about 3-4 hours before you want to sleep.&nbsp; Some people can get to sleep without much of a hassle in an hour, but I have a hard time.&nbsp; Some weed helps me a bit about 2hrs after my final dose, I don&#039;t have/use benzos so I couldn&#039;t tell you but I hear they&#039;re a commonly used way to kill coke insomnia.&nbsp; Some people say drink a beer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other tips I&#039;ve figured out (I first tried coke about a month ago, also):<br /><br />Vitamin C after your last dose helps with the crash.<br /><br />Always eat before you start doing lines.&nbsp; Once you&#039;re up you won&#039;t feel hungry, and once you start coming down, if you&#039;re riding on an empty stomach you&#039;re going to feel like absolute death and then it becomes a game of fiending just to avoid feeling sick.&nbsp; Eventually you&#039;ll have to stop, and my worst night with it I was going to only do 3-4 lines but the nauseating feeling I was getting as it was coming down made me go through the rest of my 3/4g, ultimately leading to me being up till 6am and feeling overly toxic, sick, gross, it made me swear off coke for good for a good week...and then of course I came crawling back, great!&nbsp; But after that experience I&#039;ve been able to avoid getting addicted and now only do it once a week or at the occasional house party.&nbsp; It&#039;s really easy to convince yourself you can keep it under control but the first day or two after your first time you&#039;ll probably get the itch to try more, and then I could easily see how it consumes someone&#039;s life<br /><br />The good news is its not hard to quit cold turkey, easier if you just don&#039;t buy more, but when it&#039;s in your closet it&#039;s hard to resist pulling it out.&nbsp; Or you could just do what I did, go on an empty stomach binge and train your brain that it&#039;s an awful thing to make a more-than-once-a-week habit at the very most.&nbsp; You&#039;ll feel like absolute shit but it will most definitely kick in some respect for the drug sooner than later.<br /><br />Honestly it&#039;s fun to have around, but I cannot stress enough how much you need to be in control of the drug instead of the other way around.&nbsp; I seen too many smart people fall victim to coke addiction and it becomes #1 priority in their life before they even realize it.&nbsp; You also should let your nose heal so you don&#039;t do too much damage too quickly, coke nose feels dry and annoying (I couldn&#039;t stop rubbing my nose the day after that horrible binge night I had..)&nbsp; But with responsible use it&#039;s just another drug that&#039;s fun.&nbsp; I caught up with lots of old friends and got to talk with some of my closer ones on a deeper level, so there are some positives to it.<br /><br />Oh, and snorting is the least addictive ROA though, I&#039;d suggest sticking to that.&nbsp; Smoking it is the most fiendish and IV is probably the riskiest in terms of physical health.

				Well setting is not really important, its not like LSD where you can have a bad trip if you are not in the right setting.<br /><br />Just snort small bumps, give it a good 15 minutes to kick in, and do more if you don&#039;t feel anything.<br /><br />It helps if you have a mg scale so you can measure how much it takes to get high and then next time you can do it all in one bump.<br /><br />Expect effects similar to adderall and ritalin if you&#039;ve ever tried them, increased confidence and wakefulness and of course, euphoria.<br /><br />BE AWARE! Some people (like me) don&#039;t like certain drugs, I never really liked coke, I love amphetamines but Ritalin and coke never did much for me (I definitely felt an effect, but not much euphoria).

				As to #1, get ready to feel like you&#039;re ready to conquer the planet with your bare hands.&nbsp; Then get ready to want more coke...&nbsp; If you want a really evil experience freebase it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like coke, it leaves me wanting more so bad what&#039;s the point unless you want to get addicted.
