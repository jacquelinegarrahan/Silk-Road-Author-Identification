				Hello fellow users,<br /><br />Im going to keep it short.<br /><br />If I have a gram of good coke(or 2) I won&#039;t stop until it gone.<br />I keep telling myself to save some for later, but nek minute<br />the plate is in the microwave again. :o<br /><br />Now I know that it is a known phenomenal with coke that<br />you want more once&nbsp; it wears off but fuck I just can&#039;t help<br />myself.<br /><br />I stopped smoking ages ago and program myself <br />when I know I am going to take coke that It will make me<br />wanna smoke bad but to fight it and to not give in. BOOJA<br />First line goes up the nose and straight away im on the way<br />to the servo for smokes and bottle shop after for booze.<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of phatectic really, but in normal life I have a great will power.<br />But coke manages every time to completely destroy this.<br /><br /><br />Are there others with the same problem?<br /><br /><br />And could someone explain why coke makes you crave cigarettes and alcohol BAD.<br />This is obviously because I used to smoke I don&#039;t think non smokes have this issue <br /><br />Also what amount of coke could make you overdose?<br /><br />Any info or personal experience story&#039;s are welcome.<br /><br />Peace

				Seems like merely a lack of willpower.<br /><br />That being said, I don&#039;t get much of an urge to redose at all on either coke or meth, in fact, if I take a bit more than my std dosages I tend to get the opposite effect.

				Yup I&#039;d say that&#039;s normal. Couple weeks ago while driving home from work I randomly ended up with a couple g&#039;s of coke, first time in years. I went home and did some fuckin coke. Took some benzos since Ihad work early in the morning. Woke up late, no big deal though. Next 3 days I did the same with just taking the benzos earlier so I could wake up. Did some other drugs for the weekend, then was sober all the next week. Then Friday night, when I had an early morning work appointment that I needed to be on top of my game for, indulged a little.. took my last benzos. So I get home early Saturday and within 10 minutes blew the biggest lines I&#039;d done yet. Contiued for 9 hours untuil it was gone knowing I had no benzos. Then I ended up doing cwe on some fuckin vicodin and had a not so bad comedown. <br /><br />My take on this and all my other experiences is basically this. If my inner/logical part of my brain knows damn well I have a solid reason not to do something, then I won&#039;t do it and it isn&#039;t a problem. If that part of my brain isn&#039;t sure, than I will do it. For example the first time I quit smoking weed was just a one day thing, all the people offering me bowls didn&#039;t even phase me, because I knew I was done. I only bring that up because I had tried to quit smoking for a period before but it was a total wash because I had no real reason to quit. Many many other examples of this in my life as well. Daily thing. So for me it is just willpower, but if my willpower holds depends entirely upon what fuel the willpower is burning on.<br /><br />Hopefully that makes some sense to someone...

				I&#039;m the same mate! Coke is so good it can make you trick yourself into falsely believing the sensible things you tell yourself i.e. &quot;one more line before I go to bed&quot; or &quot;I&#039;ll call it a night at 1AM&quot; and so on!<br /><br />I posted this in another thread:<br /><br />&quot;Third bloody night at it which I don&#039;t like doing as I think it&#039;s a waste of coke!<br /><br />I have a new plan to cut down on doing too much of the stuff which is to keep it in a place I can&#039;t access it during evenings at home. Once it&#039;s not near me I&#039;m OK but if it&#039;s in the house, it calls me! :-)<br /><br />I put my stash away in it&#039;s hiding place this week but had a small bit put by for the bro and tricked myself into believing I&#039;d do a line or two and leave it at that but if I don&#039;t go to bed soon the whole lot will be gone!!! :-)&quot;<br /><br />So happy I left a gram of really good stuff in my place or I would start at it tonight and it would carry into tomorrow and would be a total waste.<br /><br />Other than the odd slip up, my plan is starting to work. I take .25 or .5 out for a night and when it&#039;s gone, although I would do more or the whole lot till it&#039;s gone, I&#039;m happy I can&#039;t access it and go to bed with some still left!<br /><br />If you don&#039;t live with your folks you could hide it in the attic or something but it would have to be a non accessible place and defo not in the hands of another coke user! <br /><br />

				That is just the nature of cocaine, it&#039;s constantly making you want more. I understand this and I feel this, but apparently I have some sort of super willpower, because I got 2 G&#039;s about a month ago, and I&#039;ve only done about half of it! Just a little bit here and there is enough for me. Sometimes I&#039;d just love to blow it all in one night, but it&#039;s expensive and I wanna make it last. I&#039;m taking a break from it tonight, but it&#039;s hard, it&#039;s always in the back of my mind, the craving. But tomorrow I shall feast!

				Where are you guys getting your cocaine?&nbsp; I&#039;m so not-amazed with it, even from the vendors with good reps.&nbsp; I mean, nothing wrong with it but I&#039;m just not interested in paying more than $90/g for good coke.&nbsp; Otherwise I&#039;ll spend my money on other things to keep myself entertained.&nbsp; 4g of coke lasted me a year once.

				As you can see your not alone mate, I know people who can keep it in there top draw and not touch it for a month but its very very very very hard to do for 90% of people. Best thing to do is just not buy it. Now days I manage to just buy it around once every 2 months and then go cold turkey on it for another 2 months seems for me having none around is just the only way to stop it.<br /><br />If your really rich I read on here before about a guy who made and started selling time lock safes where you put it in the safe and it is impossible to open for x amount of hours .

				same here PePinJeNek, doesn&#039;t matter if i am snorting, smoking, or banging it. i won&#039;t stop till it is gone and i can&#039;t get more. That is why i avoid it like the plaque. i used it for years, fucked a lot of shit up, wasted a lot of energy and resources on it. And in hindsight, i understand the buzz-it made me feel good, normal, &quot;happy&quot;&nbsp; as defined by modern society, sexy, like a winner as defined by Charlie Sheen, and animated at the expense of everything else. For me cocaine is a trap. Good Luck

				To the OP.<br />Yeah, I have the same problem with coke. I start off a night with a line or two and always feel disappointed, like I&#039;m not quite &quot;there&quot; yet. I never drink alcohol, but whilst doing coke I love to have a few beers because of the warm buzz that accompanies the coke so well. It just takes the edge off the jittery feeling from the coke and makes the comedown easier too in my opinion. I&#039;m a smoker, and like alcohol, nicotine gives a nice buzz that goes with the coke all too well. Plus, I love numbing my gums with the coke and then smoking, the feeling is hard to describe but it&#039;s just so nice and smooth. <br /><br />The problem, I think, stems from the fact that cocaine severely inhibits one&#039;s willpower, and that it is so moreish. I&#039;m always left grasping for more of that smooth euphoria, and so more coke goes up my nose. But doing coke on its own doesn&#039;t give me the same feeling it used to, and so I resort to alcohol, tobacco and weed to get a better buzz. A chemical named cocaethylene is produced in the liver when coke and alcohol are taken together and it&#039;s more potent than either of them alone, and also more toxic. This is why these two go so well together. I guess after a while, everybody feels that straight coke doesn&#039;t cut it anymore (get it? ;) )<br /><br />So far my problem hasn&#039;t been too bad; it only starts once I start snorting blow. The only way I&#039;ve been able to help myself is by only picking up a gram at a time, and starting a session after at least 11pm with a couple of beers at hand. This way, after a couple of hours have passed or when my coke / booze runs out I can&#039;t be fucked to go out and pick up any more, and so I just go to sleep. <br /><br />Basically, I feel for you bro, and I hope you can help yourself. Limiting the amount available to you is in my opinion the way to go. I know you&#039;ll finish a session wanting more, but just remind yourself, &quot;The last time I did more, did I really feel that much better? Was it really worth my time / money / braincells?&quot; Hopefully the answer to these questions is, &quot;No&quot; and you&#039;ll gradually be able to shorten the length of your binges and the amount that you indulge in. I&#039;m not a pharmacologist, doctor or therapist, but I do love coke, and this method helped me cut back from about using about 4g a week to never more than 1.<br /><br />Good luck,<br />- JH

Alot of people were injecting cocaine, Sherlock Holmes was injecting cocaine, it is that just now its a drug associated with rich sissy kids snorting it in parties or so on. I haven&#039;t done cocaine in a few months now I only tried snorting it abit and mostly injecting, I have some craving when i think about it but I&#039;m OK. And still I think a shot of cocaine is cool. Crack - I&#039;m gonna try just to try it but sitting at the crackpipe whole day isn&#039;t cool really. Especially cocaine base reputation brings down it&#039;s name crack which is associated with stupid black people, also crack whores without teeth giving blowjob for a rock.. But buying a 10 pack of insulin syringes 6 shots - strong bellringers are enough for me - then i just start to have a headache and it becomes boring - then you gotta have heroin and do speedball as a last shot. Sorry for repeating myself. Just telling how to do it properly.

And still I think a shot of cocaine is cool. Crack - I&#039;m gonna try just to try it but sitting at the crackpipe whole day isn&#039;t cool really. Especially cocaine base reputation brings down it&#039;s name crack which is associated with stupid black people, also crack whores without teeth giving blowjob for a rock.. But buying a 10 pack of insulin syringes 6 shots - strong bellringers are enough for me - then i just start to have a headache and it becomes boring - then you gotta have heroin and do speedball as a last shot. Sorry for repeating myself. Just telling how to do it properly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br />Just terrible, awful advice. Ignore this BS<br />If you only snort, or even smoke, picking up the needle is bad fucking news<br />Every single iv coke user I have ever known (quite a few) totally regrets the day they picked up a spike. It&#039;s an endgame situation, especially if you&#039;re having troubles with keeping a lid on it when you just snort.

				No disrespect to anyone but I don&#039;t get the whole love of stimulants.&nbsp; Cocaine is fun to do at a party because it is ... cocaine but I&#039;ve found the effects mild and short-lived.&nbsp; Meth is a different story but I&#039;m not into taking huge doses of meth and staying up for 2-3 days as I just don&#039;t think that&#039;s very healthy and my personal belief is that it may easily have long-term consequences.&nbsp; But I&#039;m getting off topic now.
