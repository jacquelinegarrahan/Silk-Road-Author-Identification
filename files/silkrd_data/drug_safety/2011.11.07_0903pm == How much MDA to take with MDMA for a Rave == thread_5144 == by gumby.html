				How much would be a good about? I was thinking around 100mg of MDA and 80 MDMA. Is that safe?

				I was looking at combos with MDA too. I don&#039;t see much of point using it with MDMA. Might as well take a threshold dose at ~150 feel the full effect of the MDA, and then top up with a half dose of MDMA. <br /><br />Ive done 100mg MDA plus LSD ~100ug before - awesome - was bouncing off and seeing walls of fog like emotions very floaty fun trip. <br /><br />MDA + 2cb looks like the way to go from what I read - lucid dreaming states almost like you gain control of the hallucinations you want to experience. But I&#039;m still waiting for my MDA to arrive - fingers crossed :/<br /><br />MDA + 25i&nbsp; any reports yet - safe ?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I guess I&#039;ll just try some MDA, if I&#039;m weaning off of it or want more just take a little bit of mdma?

				I am going to post to this old thread. Just ordered some MDA. Sounds like around 80mg of MDMA mixed with around 50mg of MDA is what is recommended.<br /><br />But I have some 2CB as well as some 25i on hand. I would like to know if anyone has combined MDA with either of these, and if so, how much.

				According to a synth guide that someone wrote<br /><br />&quot;After the acetone wash, dry the crystals. You should have around 15g of dry crystals. That&#039;s 150 hits. The now &#039;almost white&#039; crystals have melting point values over the range from 145-153 Â° C, depending on how much water was in there during crystallization. And these crystals are ready for consumption. 60mg is not enough. 80mg is great for my wife. 100mg is a great dose. 125mg is balls-to-the-wall. 150mg is too much. For me at least. Fun for me is actually 80mg MDMA+70mg MDA in one pill. WHOH. But I guess you&#039;ll have to do another synth - right?&quot;

				lol, do any of you remember pills called snowballs in the uk in the early 1990s ?<br />they were 20 pounds each. there were one the strongest pills i ever done.&nbsp; heard snowballs had 177mg of mda in them. and they were made in latvia i think. in the goverments chemist labs. hence when you looked at them hard and smooth. they had no split line on them either! oval at the top and bottom. hence the snowball shape! well all i can say is miss them pills! and i dont think in my life time they will ever return! and for all the people out there who did try them! they would say the same. fucking mental Es

				I took 200mg of MDA my first time I took any MDXX type substance. I tripped and rolled so hard, didn&#039;t remember anything the next day, and with 2-3 hours, was too intense. Honestly, 125 mg of MDA would be enough to make you roll/trip hard for a while. Then take a bump of 50mg of mdma T+2-3 hours.

				50mg MDA plus a nice 125-150mdma mix is a hell of a time for dancing.&nbsp; You will get the speediness of the MDA without the harder &quot;trip&quot; that goes along with higher mda doses.&nbsp; Worked out well for me at electric forest fest one night with my leftover 100mg of sass split with a friend.&nbsp;
