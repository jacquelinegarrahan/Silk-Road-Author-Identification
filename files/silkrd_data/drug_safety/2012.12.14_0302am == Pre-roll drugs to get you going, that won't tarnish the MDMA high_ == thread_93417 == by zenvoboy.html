				So... what drugs are there that I could take before MDMA to &quot;get me going&quot;, get me in more of a happy, confident party mood, that won&#039;t harm the MDMA high too much, if at all?<br /><br />Could be anything, as long as it&#039;s (generally) safe. I&#039;ve heard of things like GHB being good towards the end of a roll, but what about before? (I heard taking GHB before MDMA can be dangerous...?). Even the old alcohol would be a decent enough drug, but we all know that&#039;s not a great idea with ecstasy.<br /><br />Just wondering cus I plan on going to a rave on NYE, and want to start rolling around 12 ish, but I&#039;ll be going by myself (which I&#039;m already a bit anxious about to start with), and I&#039;ll definitely enjoy it more if I&#039;m not totally sober while I wait.<br /><br />Tell me some stories of your pre-roll drug-related antics. What worked? What didn&#039;t?

				I was also gonna say GHB<br />My best guess is that its safe and does not interfere with the roll.<br />As far as i know these drugs work on different systems in your brain.<br />GHB is a natural occurring substance in our bodies and gets processed very quick.<br /><br />Other one i know is weed, being stoned improves a roll in my book.<br />Alcohol also adds another flavour to a roll, just dont be off you face drunk prior.<br />All downers i see while i&#039;m typing.<br /><br />Drugs that really fuck up your roll are stimulants :<br />speed and coke will almost sober your up and totally kill a roll, although some sensations remain. I hated mixing those...

It&#039;s sometimes called the MDMA of the tryptamines because of the emotional opening, increased tactile sensations and erotic feelings it causes. Despite these similarities with MDMA it feels vastly different (at least for me). It gives you a happy, sometimes giggly headspace that can change to loved-up and erotic, given the situation. The body-high is extremely speedy but at the same time much more clean and nice-feeling than cathinones, amphetamines and phenethylamines. It also doesn&#039;t have side-effects like jaw-clenching and the comedown is essentially non-existent but most importantly:<br />No more erectile dysfunction! You just poached that hot chick using MDMA as a confidence-booster? You&#039;ll realize what a no-brainer that was when you&#039;re about to plow her vagina to shreds and you can&#039;t even get your fuck-stick up. You don&#039;t need to worry about that with Moxy. It is amazing for fucking without making you trip like 2C-B does.<br /><br />If you have any questions, just ask me ;)

				Do you have a vendor account? Haha I actually really want to try it. With a dose like 10mg though I would likely need a microgram scale or it pre weighed, I sometimes have really strong reactions to drugs and I&#039;m pretty small (150lb female) <br />My boyfriend is really against all &quot;RC&#039;s&quot; though so I&#039;d have to convince him it&#039;s okay somehow.. what&#039;s it&#039;s status as an RC, and negative health effects?

Same username.<br />I wouldn&#039;t call it an RC, just a lesser-known psychedelic because it has been around for like 30 years. Some people report circulatory problems but for me its body load, although strong and speedy, is very enjoyable. Erowid lists &quot;anxious stimulation&quot; as a negative effect but as long as you&#039;re healthy and the dose is appropriate, you&#039;ll be fine.

It gets even better when you bomb or smoke it before taking some 4-ho-met or 4-aco-dmt too besides MDMA. Probably some of the most sexual sex I&#039;ve had in my life if that makes sense at all, it&#039;s like girls become Aphrodite herself and you suddenly grew a horse cock with insatiable lust for the female body.&nbsp; ;D

				<br />So it says dose b/t 2 and 7 mg. Is this correct? <br /><br />Also, is what&#039;s being sold on SR able to be smoked&nbsp; ? Like on foil or a pipe or something?

When smoked, 5-MeO-MiPT is said to produce immersive experiences similar to 5-MeO-DMT. The salt form is for eating, snorting or injecting. I have never snorted it but it should be possible. Be careful though.

				I have done coke and amps pre rolling to give myself a boost beforehand, then taking the molly when I start to come down a little.
