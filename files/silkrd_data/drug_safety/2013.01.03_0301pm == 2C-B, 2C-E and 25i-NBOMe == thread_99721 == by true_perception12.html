				Hey I&#039;m semi new to the forums but this is my first thread so a little background info about myself. I&#039;m 17 and&nbsp; my drug experience: LSD-25, DMT, shrooms, DXM, MXE, 25i-NBOMe, 25c-NBOMe, various benzos, various stims, MDMA, methylone, and weed. So it has been a few months since I&#039;ve tripped and have been planning a nice solo trip for tomorrow or saturday. I have 2 blotters of 25i with 1 mg each, 25 mg of 2c-b, 20 mg of 2c-e and 6 grams of medical grade weed. Side note: I haven&#039;t smoked since the last time I tripped so my weed tolerance is low to. I was just wondering if anyone knows any potential danger if I take it all. My plan was taking the 25i first and when I first notice the onset then take 15 mg of 2c-e orally and 2-3 hours later take 20 mg of 2c-b orally and snort the rest of the 2c-e and then around 2 hours after that then snort the rest of the 2c-b and obviously smoking on the onset and hopefully they all peak together and go on a joint walk and smoke on the come down. Should I only do 1 tab of the 25i or only the 2c&#039;s or just one of the 2&#039;c over the other or less of any of the 2c&#039;s doses? Any input would be greatly appreciated. I also have 1mg clonodines, would it be wise take one at the start of the trip to take any possible edge off and then 1-2 after to help get to sleep? I hate tripping in the winter so I&#039;m trying to have a good enough one to last me till summer&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />~New Age Hippy~

				I would leave out the 25i, by itself it&#039;s dangerous, also don&#039;t separate doses, take what you&#039;re going to at the same time, because you will have tolerance from the first dose, also don&#039;t snort the 2Cs, its like snorting glass.<br />Ive never done two 2Cs at the same time but i assume they will potenate each other, so take that into consideration as well.

				My original plan was just the 2c&#039;s but ended up with 2 blotters also, if I decided to do half a blotter or a whole one tonight do you think there would be any cross tolerance with the 2c&#039;s? And I was goin to space the doses between the b &amp; e because the b is shorter acting than the e and I wanted to try to get them to peak around the same time. I probably won&#039;t sniff the e but maybe the b cuz i hear mixed remarks about how bad it really burns and wanna experience the rush I&#039;ve read about atleast once, always love a good flooding of dopamine.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />~New Age Hippy~

				Man if I were going to hero dose any 2C would not be on my list. Straight up tested LSD would be the way because it is not toxic and massively beautiful (fucking expensive these days, I used to buy sheets for $50 on Dead tour). If you took NBOMe (2CE too) in massive doses you could die. 2CE from what I have read can be pretty wild all by itself. I don&#039;t know what the benefit of mixing them would be.<br /><br />I do love 2CB with MDMA, usually midway through the roll because they are not cross tolerant. 2CB alone insulfated with fuck your world at 25mg. I did that once and it hit quick and hard and the world went fractals and trails in like 3.5 min. <br /><br />Don&#039;t drive.&nbsp; :o

				I would be careful with that combo.&nbsp; 2C-B is pretty forgiving, but 2C-E not so much.&nbsp; If you do decide to snort the 2C-E, be very careful with your dosing.&nbsp; People have died snorting it.&nbsp;

				snorted 2c-e is wild as fuck. hurts like hell. makes you puke (nothing comes up tho) <br />15 mg of 2c-e orally is a lot! (i can snort that much not sure about purity tho) but the first time i took it 10 mg oral kicked my ass. <br />i dont think that your listed substances combine well with each other! <br />take them alone and smoke lot of weed.<br />you are going to have problems with cross tolerance and i think since these things work on the same part of the brain you could overdose!!<br />dont be stupid. <br />if you want to combine these with something&nbsp; do it with weed and acid. <br />&nbsp;take 10 mg of 2c-e and smoke weed on it!<br />next time : take the 2c-b and smoke weed on it. <br />etc...&nbsp;
