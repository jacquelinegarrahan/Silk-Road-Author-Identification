				New SR user here,<br /><br />I&#039;m having some problems with trusting sellers here, i am a benzo &#039;freak&#039; and i see some nice offers here that look really legit.<br /><br />But how legit are they ? <br /><br />Of course i have common sense, i check the feedback and ratings, check if there are any suspicious things on the seller&#039;s page and i use a Pill identifier.<br /><br />But since pills are easy to recreate, i&#039;m just quite too cautious with this.<br /><br />How common are fake benzo&#039;s on here ?<br />Is it really true that there are lethal substances in these fake ones ? (I don&#039;t see any sense in this one since good quality means more money)<br />But still, there are crazy fucks on this planet that don&#039;t care if they sell fake medicine and kill a few hundreds or thousands people.<br /><br />So any tips are welcome.<br /><br />Thanks!

				There is no finite answer here, but:<br /><br />Yes, there are plenty of fake benzo&#039;s on the market, most of which are imitation tablets that do not contain any active substance, but nothing dangerous either. Apart from withdrawal symptoms, they will do you no harm other then waste your money. <br /><br />Another class of &#039;fakes&#039; are tablets pressed &#039;at home&#039; - they are not legitimate pharmaceutical products, but can and sometimes do contain the amount of active substance claimed. These may be considered fake, but if they actually do contain the claimed dose of active substance they can be just as safe and effective as the real thing. <br /><br />Odd generics are another class: these often come from india, but are the real deal. They will not carry a western brand name, but do contain the active substance at the indicated dose. There is no reason to avoid such tablets since they deliver exactly what you order, albeit without the Roche stamp of approval on them. <br /><br />The worst thing that you could get is tablets with a different active substance then the one claimed. These are not all that common, but they are something to keep an eye on. <br /><br />I suppose reading reviews is a good thing before ordering: synthesis of these compounds is not that difficult, and neither is precuring the pure substance in powdered form. Personally i would suggest against ordering &#039;msj blue&#039; tablets as they seem to contain less active substance then claimed. Generics sold by vendors like pillpopperz and flaxceed seem to contain (roughly) the claimed amount of active substance, despite looking nothing like the original roche/pfizer tablets.
