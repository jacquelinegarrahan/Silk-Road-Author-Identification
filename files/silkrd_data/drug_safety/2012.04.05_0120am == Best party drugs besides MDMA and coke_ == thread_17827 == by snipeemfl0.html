				Methylone fer sure. Quite similar to MDMA and doesn&#039;t juice yer brain&#039;s seritonin. Have you tried 2C-B?

				If you were taking a lot of MDMA, MBDB is supposed to be a non-neurotoxic analogue (look up Nichols). Though it is less euphoric, it is similar indeed. 2C-B is pretty great, but it is possible to be tripping too much to be appropriate for a party setting. LSD is also a very great party drug, but with the psychs I would want to be careful about where exactly I am. For example, if I were to go to a drinking party on 2C-I (similar to 2C-B), I would get seriously upset by the drinking activities at the party. There are lots of other RC stimulants you could look up, but I don&#039;t suggest you get into those, either. They&#039;re very toxic and very addictive. =/

				Along with the other suggestions so far, I&#039;d add 25i-NBOMe to the list. It felt like a light mix of both MDMA and LSD. I prefer actual MDMA and LSD though, because 25i just felt like a much weaker substitute for the two. The more subtle effects might be exactly what you&#039;re looking for. :)

				Methylone for sure, 4-fa is also pretty good but for me it didn&#039;t last very long. 2c-b if you want a mild trip with no comedown, it&#039;s also quite euphoric I find.

				Something I&#039;ve not considered, maybe not doing drugs that often? Haha, its a stretch. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking to spread it out, making it more memorable.<br /><br /><br />I guess &quot;varying&quot; it up will also help, while using drugs on other parts of the brain that the last didn&#039;t use. Sounds stupid, but basically it will probably help me in the long run so I don&#039;t A) get tolerant of any of the drugs or B) Addicted/constant user

				Maybe look into Ethylphenidate, I haven&#039;t tried it but I&#039;ve heard a lot of good things about it and it&#039;s pretty cheap. Apparently a very clean stimulant, that doesn&#039;t induce anxiety and a horrible comedown.

				Methylphenidate and alcohol go pretty good, liver turns it into ethylphenidate in the liver.<br />It&#039;ll keep you partying, keep you drinking, make you outgoing etc.<br /><br />The only thing is, when everyone else drops and you lay there with your whole body moving back and fourth because your heart is pounding.

				Another vote for 2C-B here. I went to a club last week and railed 15mg before going in and it was incredible! The lights, poi, glovers..everything had trails in such an awesome way. I feel like 2c-b is extremely easy to &quot;act normal&quot; on but at the same time, still be tripping balls, which makes socializing easy!! I gave a friend 30mg and he took it orally, and he was tripping hard the entire night; extreme time dilation and intense hallucinations. While I was dancing and running around the club on 15mg railed, he was holding on to the railing to stay on his feet at 30mg orally. So if you can manage yourself on a low dose, I would definitely recommend 2c-b. I have not tried 2c-i yet, but I definitely want to because I&#039;m told it makes you a lot more energetic.<br /><br />I would probably vote against LSD, only because it is a significantly longer trip..I don&#039;t want to be tripping from 11pm till 11 or so the next morning. I would suggest LSD for a festival though, Ultra was incredible candyflipping :)

				I would actually say for me I would use LSD, or Weed or combined as last time I went to see an MC live, I did weed and that was pretty awesome but I think LSD would be better as for me I get some crazy visuals and with the flashing lights etc, I think it would be awesome, as it is like a nightclub atmosphere.

				2c-b makes me a little bit paranoid. And i find it to be very very mind fogging personally. I&#039;d go with Mephedrone...&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m currently very happy with this drug. Since losing the MDMA magic, Mephedrone has been a good replacement. Very very euphoric, music sounds amazing, and a great confidence booster.

				Good choice on the 4-MEC. I like that. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like drugs that mess with your mind, leave you upset and then turn distort reality. I REALLY need to be in control.<br />I&#039;ve long given up using LSD, Shrooms, PCP(they called it mesc (!) here), Salvia. Off and on, marijuana. So it&#039;s weird that I did 2C-B. I had no problem taking charge of the trip, but I had taken some pill(s?) earlier. I never would have chanced the 2C-B otherwise. And I really enjoyed it. I&#039;d like to take it while camping or at a festival. <br /><br />I did not get to experience my Methylone when I tried it. I had done the entire gram of 4-MEC, and being on an SSRI, couldn&#039;t feel any of the methylone when I started on it. I&#039;m amazed I didn&#039;t do myself harm. So people, if you&#039;re not feeling it, don&#039;t just keep taking more. <br /><br />I did not enjoy 5Meo-DiPT. Gave me a dirty feeling in my veins as the blood flowed up and down. And no, I don&#039;t shoot up. That&#039;s just how my body expresses impurities upon my senses. Like this gross warm buzzing that just overtakes me and even Lorazapam nor Klonopin help. It&#039;s all emcompassing.&nbsp; Urgh. Makes me shiver just to think about it. I get this same feeling with Pipes and DXM. Weird, huh?<br /><br />I would think 4-MMC (Mephedrone) would be a lot of fun. I really want to buy some soon. Saw some guy on this in a video... maybe a documentary for BBC? Anyway, looked just like someone&#039;s first time rolling. And in a way, I guess it was ;). Looked hella fun. Like something one wouldn&#039;t wanna miss out on.<br /><br />Dextroamphetamine (Dexadrine)<br />I like these for doing housework. Or for hikes in the woods. Basically for getting shit done.<br /><br />Methylphenidate (Ritalin)<br />Crushed and snorted these once about a dozen years ago. Could not pay attention to anything. Ran around in a circle for like 15 minutes looking for a jacket that was piled in the middle of the circle I was running. Frustrating.<br /><br />MDPV<br />Too scared to try it. It&#039;s just wasting away in a box.<br /><br />MDAI <br />Put me to sleep, but was insufflated in poor setting twice in low doses. The color, odor and smell just turn me right off. <br /><br />3,4 DMMC<br />Haven&#039;t tried it. Wish I had bought this instead of the MDPV. Looks stimulating.<br /><br />

				My good sir, erowid experience vaults will teach you plenty. :) <br /><br /><br />Also, another review from a member here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14136.msg188608#msg188608 says:...&quot;It felt as if my whole core and heart just opened in that moment, and all I felt was security and pure bliss.&nbsp; According to a friend, this was my heat chakra being opened.&nbsp; Also, pretty sure for a while I experienced almost total ego death.&quot;<br /><br />Not sure if that helps, but I&#039;m excited as fuck.
