				okay i have had a bag of strooms sitting here for a while now and i think i have finally plucked up the courage to try them,&nbsp; so tonight will be the night, what i really want to know is what to expect, i have done acid, amt, dmt, 25i and 25c NboMe and am really starting to full in love with psychedelics, are the effects similar in anyway to any of the ones i have already tried? or would someone be nice enough to explain the best they can, also i have 5grs here and unsure of how much i need to eat to get an effect, i find low doses of acid boring and its not until i hit 500-600ug that it becomes interesting so does the same apply here? and do i eat just the heads or the crispy nasty looking steams as well? not looking forward to actually munching on them although it could be worse and once there down it done. <br /><br />any advice would be great thank you in advance <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				LSD would be closest, although much more mellow and lay-down then lsd.&nbsp; Shrooms are&nbsp; aslo one of the most&nbsp; mystical (similar to DMT) psychedelics. <br /><br />Good luck.

				I can answer your dosage question, though this may be more info than you wanted.<br /><br />From my profile page.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A dosage of 4–10 mg of psilocybin, which corresponds roughly to 50–300<br />micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, based on the average weight of<br />65kg, is required to induce psychedelic effects. 1g of dried Ps. Cubensis<br />mushroom contains between 4-8mg of Psilocyben. This means that 1g of mushroom<br />may produce a minimum effect provided you weight under 143lbs however the<br />average American will need 2g to get a noticeable effect.<br /><br />Although some users eat just one gram of &quot;shrooms,&quot; dried weight, I find this<br />produces little more than threshold effects. Two grams should produce a mild<br />psychedelic high, three grams is the suggested dosage and will provide full<br />visuals, and five grams should produce an experience of similar intensity to a<br />250 mcg. LSD trip.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have found that 3g of dried Cubensis is good for me, lots of visuals and a great peak!<br /><br />I have also found that good music helps and once tripping clothing tends to feel cumbersome so it gets removed.

				I have tried tea and did not like it. Personally, I like to grind them up in a coffee grinder and mix them with a small chocolate milk shake. Some times I will make chocolate bars or cubes with it. But that is just me. <br /><br />So far I have ground them and mixed it with<br /><br />Cranberry juice and Apple juice<br />Chocolate<br />Made a tea with them<br />Sliced them fresh and put them in an omelet<br />and even eaten them fresh picked off the substrate.<br /><br />Fresh picked had a bad taste but was one hell of a strong trip!

				Eat 2.5 grams right off the bat.<br />With shrooms, unlike acid, you can eat more and increase the high once you start tripping.<br />Therefore, if 2.5 grams doesn&#039;t have you where you need to be, start munching on some more.<br />3 grams should definitely do the trick.<br /><br />The most important thing with shrooms is Setting.<br />Mystical was used earlier as term to describe mushrooms. That is very on point.<br />It is a completely different animal than LSD. Hard to explain. <br />Seems ancient when you are tripping. Kind of like ayauascha or DMT, were one gets visions of the jungle and animals.<br />I prefer LSD b/c I love LSD with all my heart and think it is mystical as well but I still eat my boomers because they are very special.<br /><br />As for the trip:<br />Incredible OEV&#039;s. Last trip I had amazing trails, wallpaper was morphing.<br />Geometrical CEV&#039;s.<br /><br />I feel shrooms are more intense. The come up makes you sweat, sometimes puke (i never have), one can easliy become confused.<br />Hence why I prefer to be in my house or my buddies house.<br />I do not like to be in public or around others not on mushies.<br />Obviously, camping is an ideal situation as well.<br />Being alone or with one other person is ideal and the trip will be more focused.<br />You don&#039;t want to be worrying about anything but enjoying the magic.<br /><br />Remember to just let the mushrooms take you wherever because you have no say in the matter.<br />If you let go it will be an amazing, healing trip.

				Spread some peanut butter over a slice of bread, grind the shrooms up as close to a powder as you can and pour on top of the peanut butter, now just fold it in half and enjoy with a nice glass of chocolate milk. Easy as pie! ;D I guess 3 grams would be nice to start with but 5 grams is preferable in my experience so it&#039;s up to you. You can always work up to it so have a great time brody. ;)

				Be ready for sensory overload OP&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />You must go with the amount you are comfortable. You want to have a good trip?&nbsp; You got to be content with everything and not be anxious because you think you ate too much.<br /><br />If they are good boomers and it is your first time, 2 grams should be good but 3g if you really want to experience visuals and a more intense trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are tripping too hard just lay down. breathe slowly, acknowledge that you are in a trip and what is happening is normal and enjoy it.&nbsp; During the peak if you are staying still your vision may make you feel like you are melting in to the seat/ground since your eyes can not focus what is in front of you and the muscles are so relaxed you can&#039;t feel your body. Each eye is dilating differently constantly, that is why you get visuals and morphing of objects and walls.&nbsp; Don&#039;t bug out if people&#039;s faces on tv or in real life start looking weird too, it may even look funny!&nbsp; Faces could look odd like the eyes could be different sizes and the face can change shapes slightly.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is all part of the trip.<br /><br />Enjoy man and have fun

				Eat all you have(stems, powder, caps), up to an eight at once for your first run. I find spreading the dose mellows it out too much, but YMMV and starting at a lower dose is NEVER A BAD IDEA, just merely trip-reducing.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll throw my experience in, although its late and I&#039;m sure its over for you - the description makes much more sense post-trip anyway.<br /><br />I used to take anywhere from 5 - 7g p. cubensis, and the experiences were all similar.&nbsp; I never reached any reported &quot;ego death&quot; like levels, and in all actuality I would say they were all mild trips. A few hits of acid did far more visually for me. However, I feel mushrooms to be a more &quot;emotional&quot; experience.&nbsp; It is as unique as the feeling of &quot;comfort&quot; is, or of &quot;fear&quot;. Its like describing the taste of banana to someone that has never had one, but on an emotional level.&nbsp; All of my trips were enjoyable, but made me anti-social (except to those close to me/trusted) and pretty awkward.&nbsp; Good times, though. Give us a report!

				RR. how about a little advice for tripping alone.<br /><br />Plan the night. I mean everything, the music the setting all of it.<br /><br />I have found that dim lighting helps bring out the patterns. If you can turn the lights down low, do it.<br /><br />Music is important while tripping. Listen to everything before you trip and ask yourself, is this happy, sad, mellow, etc. etc. Sarah Mclachlan sounds great when sober but is a real downer when tripping. I tend to go with late 60&#039;s psychedelic rock, the Doors, Cream, etc. The music was made for tripping ;) Come to think of it, I am just over the hill and love the old music.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Remember, the trip is 6 to 8 hours so make sure you have enough music.<br /><br />The best movie I ever watched while tripping was Star wars the empire strikes back.

				For mushrooms you can&#039;t beat the Ozric Tentacles, there aren&#039;t words to describe the sounds you&#039;ll hear :)<br />For more recent stuff I&#039;d recommend Shpongle or Hallucinogen :)<br />Don&#039;t bother with a movie, if the mushies are good you won&#039;t watch it, but a few drops of liquid at the bottom of a crystal glass had me amazed for hours :)<br />Pre roll your spliffs or it will take forever to roll one once the tobacco starts writhing around in the papers :)<br /><br />

				definitely eat all 5 grams last time i tripped i ate 15 grams you can&#039;t od on shrooms so the more you take the better trip and if you split them into 2 trips you more than likely would&#039;nt feel the second one

				Ok I had to log in to talk a bit about safety here. Telling a person to take all 5 grams is not a good idea, especially a person who has never done shrooms. <br /><br />I remember long ago my first trip I ate 3.5g&#039;s and had a very mild trip; pleasant but mild. The next time, I ate another 3.5 from a different place and was blasted into oblivion. Mind you these shrooms looked exactly the same as the first batch. I couldn&#039;t even read my vision was so distorted. First point here being that mushrooms vary greatly in potency from one batch/seller/type to the next. Luckily the road helps us determine the type but the potency can still vary greatly depending on the care put into growing them. Your best bet is to see what works for you! Start small and work up from there. Just because it may be physically safe to take a high dose does not mean it will be the trip you are looking for. It could be way unpleasant.<br /><br />A second point, is that each one of us is slightly different. Not only in weight but in your bodies processing capabilities. 300ug of lsd is a wonderful dose but would cause my friend to wig the fuck out. It is just too much for her. She gets the effects I do with generally half the dose. I would never give a first-timer the dose I take because I know what works for me, no one else. I always scale people up. Start slow, wait an hr or so, take more if desired. We can guide you as to what you may experience, how to arrange for your trip but when it comes to dosage it will be unique to you.<br /><br />To sum up just be careful and go slow. No need to rush into it especially with shrooms. There are shrooms everywhere and they are really fucking cheap (also you can grow and harvest them for even cheaper/free). I hope you have a blast!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m certainly not a shrooms expert but I would go for tea which I have done many times with light mushrooms but my advise would definitely be to take it step by step, meaning, take a little and go on about your eve, wait a while, don&#039;t be eager for more straight away, when they kick in they kick in fairly hard if you had too much, you can always top them up later if you are so inclined, I had many &quot;kind of too much&quot; trips on mushrooms because I was impatient.<br />as far as effect, if you are used to acids, which I was, it feels a little bit like but it feels in somewhat more natural and easy going.<br /><br />Let me also say that they are better taken with friend on the same level and on mushrooms too, and if you guys are planning to take them properly a trip buddy is in my view advisable, I certainly would not do them at home on my own, it would be boring and possibly paranoic, it&#039;s much better to have a laugh with friends and possibly trip together. it&#039;s also good to have somebody that is somewhat sober just in case. <br /><br />I disagree with whoever wrote saying you can&#039;t add to them while you are on it, from my experience you can and it&#039;s actually better, especially if it is the first time, I would highly suggest to&nbsp; you to start by taking it easy, get the feel for it and then up the dose when you are comfortable to do so. if you go over what you can deal with it&#039;s not pleasant.<br /><br />anyway I am not an expert I just talk out of personal experience.<br /><br />having said that you are probably off on one now anyway so enjoy ;)

				When doing any psychedelics make sure you are in a good frame of mind and avoid anything that will negatively effect your mood. I once did very strong shrooms just after being rejected by a girl I was really into, and whilst watching a news report about the Palestine conflict. Was not a nice experience! lol<br /><br />Make sure you are comfortable and relaxed and have some nice chilled music you enjoy playing. Or find a nice garden or field to lay back in and contemplate the universe haha<br /><br />Most importantly, have at least one sober friend there to &#039;sit&#039; you. Preferably someone with experience in what you are taking, They don&#039;t take anything psychedelic themselves,&nbsp; they are there to give you reassurance and calm you down if you freak out. This bit is essential. Just having someone to remind you that you are just tripping, it will be over soon, and things will be back to normal is invaluable. <br /><br />NEVER trip alone and NEVER trip when you are down or depressed. <br /><br />I can recommend a little 2CI (5 to 10mg) before you start. It is a little trippy itself, but it&#039;s first affect is to make you feel like a million dollars! This puts you in a real nice place to start with, a bit ecstasy-like.<br /><br />Hope this helps and you have a good experience.

				Just curious, you think 3.5g is too much for my friend&#039;s first time?&nbsp; He sounds confident and I know he&#039;s tripped on acid, DMT, 2c-b countless times so I&#039;m sure he can handle it.&nbsp; What would you compare an 1/8th of shrooms worth to in acid, perhaps?

				British Liberty Caps are some of the best mushrooms you can get :) They look very like my mushroom pipes but you can google them easily enough, check sheep fields and moors if you&#039;re out of town, and golf courses and parks in town. When you find one you know there are lots more nearby, and after you get your eye in they&#039;ll seem to pop up all around you :) take a pic of any you&#039;re not sure of and we can soon tell you if they&#039;re the right ones.
