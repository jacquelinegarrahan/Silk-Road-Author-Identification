				&nbsp;Sorry if this is in the wrong place; I just wanted to introduce myself and proudly proclaim that my first transaction here on SR was a complete success! (Cheers to Dolfan!) Anyway, I was wondering how to compare or reliably estimate the quality or potency of H? I am an experienced oxy user, but my first sniff of H (Which could not have been anymore than ~10-15 mg) got me pretty damn high...or at least much higher than I had anticipated it would from snorting such a tiny amount. How can one estimate a good strong high with a bit of nod without overdoing it? I know pretty much all H is different, but any tips for a newby are greatly appreciated! Thanks guys!

				that&#039;s the thing about dope. everyone&#039;s tolerance is different and on top of that the quality of the dope you can get is always different. So you can never pin point exactly how much to take and not OD. I&#039;ve done 5 bag shots and not gotten high and i&#039;ve done a 1 bag shot that almost took me out for good.<br /><br />It is a little less dangerous sniffing it but i&#039;d still ease into it if i were you. with new supplier or new stamps just do a little taste maybe half a bag and then judge from there.<br /><br />good luck and be safe.<br />-JD

				And don&#039;t potentiate it unless you ordered a decent quantity where you can test the potency first. <br /><br />Always order more then one dose worth so you can test it out to see how strong it is. Then you can tell how much you want to do for real. Some vendors on here have consistent quality. But I would still test it out on each order first before going for the full dose. <br /><br />Better safe than sorry.

				&nbsp; I completely understand all of you. That is one reason I enjoy oxys; you always know what to expect. But thank you for the warnings, I&#039;ll be sure to indulge with care.
