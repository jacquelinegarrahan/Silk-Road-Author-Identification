				I assume a vast majority of rolls happen at night and overnight. So the result for me is a really rough day after. But is that hangover because of the MDMA or is it just from staying up all night? <br /><br />So I&#039;m thinking about trying a roll during the day...say around noon. Does anyone have any experience with this and what was the hangover like compared to a night roll?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				are you taking pressed x pills or mdma crystals? if you got the mdma from a vendor on SR who were they?<br /><br />x pills have always given me hangovers, but once i went to straight mdma those awful hangovers went away and i almost never feel bad the next day, even if i only had a few hours sleep. this always surprised me.it could also possibly be a health issue if you are just taking mdma crystals, nothing serious probably but something to get checked out, either that or the mdma is cut/unpure.<br /><br /><br />as far as rolling during the day, i know some people who frown upon doing that because they say you need to be at an event or with friends etc. but it is a very serene and beautiful thing if you take a walk or something on a normal to moderately high dose during the day. i dont think rolling face and walking around during the day would feel much fun. but recently i was 100mgs of mdma and walking through my neighborhood on a beautiful day. everything looked so magnificent and it just felt so good to be alive in that moment. felt like a kid again. and i mean that in every sense. <br /><br />hakuna matata - i think i spelt that right - meaning no worries. <br /><br /><br />just me and nature, the wind blowing and all sorts of activity going on. it was just your average day but everything that was normal seemed to mean so much more. like i was discovering everything for the first time. anything and everything was awesome.<br /><br /><br />felt very much like a shroom trip without the visuals in the sense that i was in a totally different state of mind and i thought about things in a different way and i could appreciate all life. itsa&nbsp; very gratifying feeling when you feel so much love for everything at once :)<br /><br /><br />all in all i think you should try it out at least once<br /><br /><br />it might help you sleep better too if you time it right lol<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

Just make sure you get some sleep, even if just a little. I think the general feeling shit the next day that some people talk about is from being deprived of sleep more than the affects of the MDMA. For a few days before rolling i always make sure I get a few good sleeps in. Rolling in the day can be fun, if somewhat surreal. <br /><br />If your still having problems have a look at the pre/post loading thread on here somewhere. I don&#039;t use it myself but I know a few people that swear by it.<br /><br />J1782G

				I sell pills on SR that prevent most of the side effects of MDMA. You can try those, or you can pre-load with things like vitamin C, flavonoids, and 5HTP to mitigate the &#039;hangover&#039;.

				clean molly rarely gives me any next day troubles, although its been my regime since 15 years old that i take 2 multivitamin caps before any experience and it seems to have always stopped any sort of hangover (except of course one caused by booze, fucking awful drug alcohol) but personally id say if you fancy something for in the day id go with something a little trippier like acid shrooms or a 2c though, ive only done it twice now but i really like tripping outside on a nice sunny day

				Its going to depend how you define &#039;hangover&#039;. The up-all-nite + mdma hangover is going to be worse than the daytime + mdma hangover by way of reason (think about it.. you feel worse after being up all nite, even without drugs). Either way though, a brain depleted of its serotonin supply is going to feel affected no matter how pure the MDMA, and if day or nite wont matter what. There are ways to minimize effects such as pre-roll and post-roll vitamins and 5ht etc (as others already mentioned)... But these are slow processes and even with all minimization techniques accounted for, there will still be a lull period where, if you are in tune with your senses and emotions, you will feel the negative effects.<br /><br />The simple fact is, a good roll will deplete your brain of a good amount of serotonin and in most cases the person&#039;s going to feel somewhat eff&#039;d up afterwards. Of course there are always exceptions to the rule, and there are some friends who report no negative after effects at all. These people are probably simply not as consciously aware of changes to their serotonin levels and unfortunately probably also get less enjoyment from their high (less awareness of the low in congruence with less awareness of the high).

				I agree with cali about the awesomeness of daytime walks. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never gotten a bad hangover or hangover at all with good powder, crystal mdma.&nbsp; Only a nice afterglow the next day.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always expect a hangover with pills regaurdless if i drop in the morning or in the middle of the night.&nbsp; <br /><br />Majority of the pills aorund me are pipez, or meth bombs mixed with mdma which mean shitty hangover terrible next day no sleep.

				Rolling during the day is great.&nbsp; I&#039;m rolling right now and it&#039;s only 4PM! ;)<br /><br />Sleep deprivation can make the next day much worse.&nbsp; If somebody stays up all night and doesn&#039;t get enough sleep they may feel like shit the next day without having taken any drugs.&nbsp; Because staying up all night dancing is very much associated with MDMA, it&#039;s hard to know exactly what it is that&#039;s causing the hangover effects.&nbsp; Unless you try it out for yourself of course, without staying up all night and getting some good sleep.
