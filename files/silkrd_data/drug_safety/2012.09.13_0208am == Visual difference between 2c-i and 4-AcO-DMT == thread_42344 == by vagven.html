				Welp I&#039;ve gone and placed 3 separate orders at the same time for 2c-i, 2c-e, and 4-AcO-DMT all the same quantity and I have a real predicament on my hands.&nbsp; I see that 2 of the orders have shipped and 1 arrived yesterday.&nbsp; The problem is, is that I don&#039;t know which one I received!<br />The packaging has no indication of of which one it is or which vendor it came from, obviously&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; I have emailed the vendors to try and figure out who&#039;s package I might have received based on the description of the stealth packaging but I am not getting much of a response.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to do anything with this until I can figure out which one it is, for safety reasons (don&#039;t want to dose the wrong amount).&nbsp; Does anyone know how I could visually tell the difference between 2c-i and 4-AcO-DMT before I try it?&nbsp; Or is there a difference in smell?&nbsp; If anyone knows a difference between the two, please help me out!&nbsp; Thanks!

				You can&#039;t tell the difference by appearance.&nbsp; They are both white powders, and both could have colored impurities.&nbsp; Your best bet is to use reagent tests, such as those from Dancesafe (Mecke, Marquis, Simons).<br /><br />The 4-aco, being an acetylated compound, was likely synthesized using acetic anhydride and *might* have a slight vinegar smell if it wasn&#039;t purified well.&nbsp; <br /><br />But if you are going to use these compounds, you really need to get reagents and learn to use them.&nbsp; See (CLEARNET) http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/512598-Marquis-Mecke-Mandellin-results-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more

				If you&#039;ve ever done mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT will be very similar if not identical.<br /><br />2c-i is more colorful and body load may be more pronounced. <br /><br />4-AcO-DMT will make you trip with 8-9mg (depending on what kind you have). 2c-i will let you feel effects at 9mg but it won&#039;t be much of a trip, just stimulation and brighter colors.

				you should buy a reagent testing kit...<br /><br />also space out the time between orders more so they arrive on different days and you can label them accordingly...

				10mg of 2c-i is easily a trip.<br /><br />Just eat 10mg of them, if it takes 2 hours to trip and it&#039;s mild then it&#039;s 2c-i, if it&#039;s headfucky and shoomish then it&#039;s 4-aco
