				Ok, so im ordering some more lsd cause my last trip was a failure. I fell asleep after i took the blotters cause i did too much xanax that day. But, this time im ordering 5 hits and im going to take 2 1/2 blotters and it should be 300ug. Could anyone tell me what a 300ug lsd trip is like, and if it will be way to strong?

				way too much if you have to ask... seems like you dont have experience tripping so you should definitely start with less<br /><br />dont do any benzos for at least 24 hours because they essentially kill trips<br /><br />then start with one good quality tab 100 - 150 ug

				Well i have plenty of experiences with psychs. Ive done 8mg of nbome one time.. I have done 2c-e and 2c-p plenty of times. Done all the nbomes, i have done 5-meo-mipt, and my hardest trip was on AMT when my soul went out of my belly button. Shit was crazy

				honestly sounds irresponsible to me imo, 8 mg of nbome could be extremely dangerous - people have died from less<br /><br />if you have that much experience tripping, why would you drop after taking so much xanax <br /><br />read trip reports for around 250 ug, because blotter are generally claimed to be more than they actually are... like the first trip ever, which would be about the same amount. if you just have a naturally high tolerance then no one can answer your question, you would know that by comparing your previous doses and the experience by the common dosage - then you just need to adjust accordingly
