				Any experience with variants of this combination?<br /><br />Another approach to this topic might be &quot;MDMA vs. amphetamines&quot;, because while LSD + MDMA and shrooms + MDMA are classic combinations, I can find no discussion of speed being used in such a combo.<br /><br />Now maybe this is because I haven&#039;t had a particularly good roll on MDMA yet, while I have enjoyed myself on some pressed speed (specifically Mr. Ouid&#039;s ICE - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/81cef0d593), so maybe I&#039;ve yet to experience how different, and how much better, MDMA can be. Nothing I have experienced on MDMA explains to me why someone would think to call it &quot;spiritual&quot;. So maybe that&#039;s just down to finding a better product. <br /><br />Is that likely to be the case? Anyone tried such a combo?

				LoL does anyone else think this a bad idea? I couldnt think of a more un appealing combo to me? a never ending Mushroom trip or acid trip does not sound fun!!!<br /><br />i can just imagine a bad acid trip while cranked out! or taking mushrooms after youve already been up for a few days!!! <br /><br />the idea of that scares the shit outa me lol no thanks.

				Balestirieri (1957) gave amphetamine (20-30 mg, i.v.) to subjects at the height of LSD activity (open, n=8,200ug, p.o.). The effects of both substances were intensified, but not qualitatively modified, accoridng to his observations. <br /><br />Ritalin is a sympathomimetic drug related to the amphetamines. It was used from 1954 to support psychotherapeutic treatment with LSD (Sandison &amp; Whitelaw, 1957; Ling &amp; Buckman, 1963). ...<br /><br />In combination with LSD, ritalin caused, 15 min after i.m. injection, perceptual changes with withdrawal tendencies, distortion of the surroundings, and augmented mental activity. Changes in body image and proprioception were noted, as were changes in mood anf effect. Ritalin modified the LSD effects and allowed the application of lowered doses in LSD in therapy (Ling &amp; Buckman, 1963).<br /><br />In the course of 370 LSD sessions, Kristensen (1962) additionally gave 23 seriously neurotic patents methylphenidate (Ritalin, 30-50mg, i.v.) during 220 sessions. Methylphenidate was administered additively at the height of the LSD effect (150ug, p.o.). The two substances supported each other in their effects. The author developed the hypothesis that LSD caused a process of successively augmented tension, which was discharged by methylphenidate administration. Ling and Buckman (1963) gave methylphenidate 30 min after LSD and observed a reduction of LSD-induced anxiety. Leuner (1981) described the same effects as those described by Ling and Buckman (1963) and Kristenen (1962), based on many years of clinical experience with combination treatment using LSD and methylphenidate. Methylphenidate was administered when the LSD effect began to wane.<br /><br />Methamphetamine (20-40 mg, i.v.) partially inhibited the effects of LSD when it was given after the start of LSD action. It also shortened the duration of action of LSD to 2-3 h, and modified the LSD-induced perceptual changes and disturbances in spatial-temporal orientation. The subjects became more open to the researchers and their actions were more related to reality than on LSD alone. However, Hoch (1955, 1956b) gave no exact details about the subjects and the experimental design.<br /><br />From Pharmacology of LSD: A Critical Review by Annelie Hintze, pages 119 to 120.

				Sounds like a bad idea to me. MDMA is a different story imo because it doesn&#039;t make you feel bugged out.

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />Well, with a proper source of MDMA, I&#039;m set to see the difference and then maybe I&#039;ll agree that one is a natural combo and not the other. I hope to! By all reports, MDMA is a much better time than I&#039;ve had so far.
