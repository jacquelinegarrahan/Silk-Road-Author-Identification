				Though it would be a good idea to have a drug test info thread, lots of people have questions, so I wrote a basic guide :)<br /><br />Drug tests look for the drug itself plus their metabolites, which can remain for hours, days or sometimes weeks (with long term heavy use) after the drug&#039;s clears your system. The most common drug tests you might have to take are urine, saliva and blood tests. You&#039;re most likely not going to see a hair test unless its a really high profile job or you&#039;re applying to the secret service.&nbsp; <br /><br />Drug tests can only be for a specific drug (like if you&#039;re boss thinks you&#039;re on heroin), but most tests you will have to take, like for a new job, will test for multiple drugs. The 2 most commonly used are 5 panel and 10 panel tests:<br /><br />5-panel tests for: amphetamines, methamphetamine, cannabinoids (THC, Marijuana) cocaine, opiates (Codeine, Morphine, Heroin, Oxycodone, Vidcodin, etc.) and Phencyclidine (PCP)<br /><br />10-panel tests for: cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, cannabinoids (THC, Marijuana), methadone, opiates (Codeine, Morphine, Heroin, Oxycodone, Vidcodin, etc.), phencyclidine (PCP), barbiturates, benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium, ect) and tricyclic antidepressants.<br /><br />Drug tests look for commonly abused drugs. If its a rare or not very commonly used drug (like salvia), its not going to show up on a standard test, unless its chemically similar to a common drug tested for. Magic mushrooms are not tested for on a standard drug test.<br /><br />-saliva test-<br /><br />Taken using a swab to collect oral fluid from you&#039;re mouth. Generally the shortest detection times compared to other methods. Can generally detect use during the previous few hours to 1–2 days. It&#039;s most likely not going to detect anything after a couple days of being clean. Is currently the least sensitive test for weed. THC may only be detectable for less than 12.0 hours in most cases, but they are working to make the test more sensitive for THC, so the newest tests may be more accurate. The easiest test to pass if you know its coming up, just stay clean for 3 or 4 days before the test and you will be fine.<br /><br />-urine test-<br /><br />Just like it sounds, you pea in a cup. Generally longer detection time that saliva tests, can range from a couple days to up to 30 days, depending on drug type and usage.<br /><br />-Blood test-<br /><br />Are mostly used to find out if you are currently intoxicated. Like if you get arrested for driving while intoxicated. Short detection times, they mosty mimic that of saliva, except for THC and benzodiazepines, which are longer.<br /><br />Detection times list the lowest and highest amount of time an average person can expect to be clean after last use. Sometimes only the longest time is listed. But everyone&#039;s situation and body is different, times are highly dependent on multiple factors like drug amounts, length of use,&nbsp; frequency of use,&nbsp; metabolic rate, body mass, age, overall health, and urine pH. In general though I&#039;ve found that most people don&#039;t take as long as the highest detection times listed, unless they are a long-term, daily, heavy user, or they just happen to have a real slow metabolism.<br /><br />Use detection times as a guide while taking into account your own personal factors. (information is from&nbsp; LabCorp)<br /><br />-Amphetamines (except methamphetamine)-<br />Urine: 1 to 4 days<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 12 hours<br /><br />-Methamphetamine-<br />Urine: 3 to 5 days<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 1–3 days<br /><br />-MDMA (Ecstasy)-<br />Urine: 72 – 96 hours<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 72 – 96 hours<br /><br />-Barbiturates (except phenobarbital)-<br />Urine: 1 day<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 1 to 2 days<br /><br />-Phenobarbital-<br />Urine: 2 to 3 weeks<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 4 to 7 days<br /><br />-Benzodiazepines (xanax, valium, klonopin, ect)-<br />Urine: Therapeutic or occasional use: up to 7 days. Chronic, daily use (over one year): 4 to 6 weeks<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 6 to 48 hours<br /><br />-Cannabis (weed, pot, sweet sweet mary jane :p)-<br />Urine: Infrequent users: 3-4 Days; Heavy users: 10 days; Chronic, daily long term users and/or users with high body fat: 30 days or up to 3 months<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 2–3 days. in blood, up to 2 weeks in blood of heavy users. However, it depends on whether actual THC or THC metabolites are being tested for, the latter having a much longer detection time than the former. THC (found in marijuana) may only be detectable in saliva/oral fluid for 2–24 hours in most cases.<br /><br />-Cocaine-<br />Urine: 2 to 5 days, with exceptions for certain kidney disorders<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 2 to 5 days<br /><br />-Codeine-<br />Urine: 2 to 3 days<br />Hair: 2 to 3 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 2 to 3 days<br /><br />-Morphine-<br />Urine: 2 to 4 days<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 1 – 3 days<br /><br />-Opiates (oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin ect)-<br />Urine: 2 to 4 days<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 1 – 3 days<br /><br />-LSD-<br />Urine: 12 to 24 hours<br />Hair: currently undetectable<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 2 to 4 days<br /><br />-Methadone-<br />Urine: 7 to 30 days<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 24 hours<br /><br />-PCP-<br />Urine: 3 to 7 days for single use; up to 30 days in chronic users<br />Hair: up to 90 days<br />Blood / Oral Fluid: 1 to 3 days

				Great thread, there&#039;s a lot of useful info here! A lot of the detection times are lower than I thought. I usually smoke cannabis 4-5 times a week so I&#039;m guessing this would be regarded as heavy use?<br /><br />I read on another thread (can&#039;t remember which) about rubbing some sort of chemical into your hair a couple of times a day before the test and it&#039;ll help reduce the amount of the drug that they can detect in your hair. Do you have any tips for reducing the detection times?

				If anyone&#039;s on criminal drug testing, most of them around my area use 6 panel drug tests which do NOT test for PCP. Therefore, ketamine is a safe drug to abuse whilst on probation. Well, safe in some ways.
