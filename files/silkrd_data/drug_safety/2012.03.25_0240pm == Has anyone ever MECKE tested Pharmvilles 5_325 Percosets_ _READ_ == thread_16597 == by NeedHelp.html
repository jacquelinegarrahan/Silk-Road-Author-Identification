				I just recently got some eztests from eztest.com and it is the Mecke version. It says that the test will turn Olive Green when presented with Oxycodone. I tested Pharmvilles 5/325 percosets and it&#039;s coming back Redish/Brown. I&#039;ve tested a few pills from them and they all come back Redish/Brown NOT Olive Green.<br /><br />What&#039;s up with this? Normal?

Both of what you said are the same. Mixing APAP with Dextro or Darvon with APAP is the same thing because if you mixed APAP and Dextro that would be Darvon so Darvon with APAP is the same thing.<br /><br />So the question is this... do these pills really contain OXYCODONE??? I don&#039;t think so.

				Stupid thing on my part is I had one of the OC40&#039;s and I didn&#039;t end up testing it to see if THAT was even what it REALLY should be.
