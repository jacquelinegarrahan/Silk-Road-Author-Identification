				So my question is, what are good vitamins to take while at a 4 day festival.... My system will be hit with a lot of Lucy and Molly, so I&#039;m curious as to what would be good vitamins or supplements to take before, during, and after all of this. I know my brains going to be hurting by the 4th day regardless but if anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated!!!! :)

				I&#039;m thinkin about ordering a bottle of raveaid, but I don&#039;t like the fact that it has 5-htp in it, I&#039;ve heard a lot of bad things about 5-htp..... Does anyone know of any good multivitamins without 5-htp?

				I take a multivitamin + fish oil supplement daily, as should pretty much everyone. When rolling I&#039;ll take some magnesium beforehand to help with jaw tension, and then some 5-HTP daily for a few days afterwards....<br /><br />This is a good article:<br /><br />***CLEARNET***<br />http://thedea.org/preloading.html<br />***CLEARNET***<br /><br />This Raveaid stuff looks interesting, anyone have experience with it? It would be nice to have all of my rolling supplements in one pill than in 3-4.

I passed them out to about 15 people at an after party and felt like I was giving a sales pitch, lol, I was really just looking out for people health. It has everything in it that seems to be recommended for preloading and post roll. Contains all the antioxidants, magnesium, and 5-htp needed. Usually preload 2-3 days in advance and post load 12hrs after and 2 days following.
