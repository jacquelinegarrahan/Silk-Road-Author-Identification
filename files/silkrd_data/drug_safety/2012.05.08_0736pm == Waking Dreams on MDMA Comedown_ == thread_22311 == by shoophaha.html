				This happened to my friend and I when we did MDMA and I have never heard this effect of MDMA described before so I am intensely curious as to why it happened. Basically, we had waking dreams. I had smoked some weed to help me sleep (he didn&#039;t) and when we tried to go to sleep we were instead distracted by these dreams. We saw our friends in dream-like situations and wanted to talk to them and the weirdest thing is I nearly did even though I was wide awake; I remember mouthing some words while thinking that it was weird that I was talking to them at all because I knew they weren&#039;t real. I pinched myself and it hurt so I knew it wasn&#039;t a lucid dream. I was aware that my phone was under my pillow (where I always keep it) but I also had a phone in the &quot;dream&quot; and when I tried to read my texts they were all garbled letters and numbers like onion URLs and the letters kept dissolving and changing. Eventually I ended up just passing out and going to sleep. Does anyone have any similar experiences or insight?

				Had a similar thing in my teenage years after a bit of an amphetamine bender, coming back from the coast in the car and kept envisioning the motorcyclist in front of us crashing our car about to hit him, granted I was drifting into sleep before snapping back to reality. Was grim. Lasted for about 2 hours<br /><br />Had you been partying for a few days previous? Sleep deprivation induced hallucinations?

				Had some super strong haze before and experienced similar. Basically I forgot even how to walk normally or cross the road. I was high and stranded in a park at night alone, all in partial darkness. I drifted in and out of dreaming state with my eyes opened and closed all the time while sitting, I got a shock and kept looking at my watch kept thinking I fell asleep.<br /><br />I was scared shitless and the only thing I did to keep calm was to walk around the park straight for 1 hour before regaining my senses. That was the only thing I knew how to do because I forgot even how to walk diagonally and find another seat, not to mention being unable to cross a traffic properly.

After being out rolling all night, I usually come home and smoke some weed before me and the lady lay down. As we are both laying there trying to sleep, I will be playing whole dreams in my head while I&#039;m still awake, but on the verge of sleep. Then subconsciously I&#039;ll say something to her or ask her a question in real life, and she has no idea what I&#039;m talking about and I so I try to brush it off.&nbsp; Sometimes it happens a couple times in a row because I can&#039;t help it threading my dreams and reality. More recently it happened to my girlfriend for the first time, I thought it was a bit humorous..and grateful that it&#039;s not just me with this side effect.

				I went on a pretty retarded MDMA binge one month and it led to me having really weird dreams. I don&#039;t even know if I could call them nightmares because they weren&#039;t particularly scary, but they were very dark and all involved death
