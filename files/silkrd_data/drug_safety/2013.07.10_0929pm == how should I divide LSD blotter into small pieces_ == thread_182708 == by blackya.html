				You don&#039;t divide you eat it all at once.<br /><br />JK LOL!<br /><br />Acid is always layed 1 gram=10 tenpacks. A tenpack is tensheets. 1gram=10,000doses. If your laying needlpoint your doses will be 95mcg, because your crystal is 95% pure. If your laying amber your shit will be 70mcg, because it`s 70% pure. got it<br /><br />Now you get a glass pyrex pan to dip your tenpacks in. Your crystal is dissovled into 110ml. of everclear per gram.The purer crystals dissolve instantly with a little stirring. The not so pure take a little shaking. Champange is damn near impossible to get to dissolve evenly.<br /><br />Paper-for white blotter standard watercolor paper#14 or equivalent is used. It`s critical you get the right paper. If you don`t it won`t absorb right and you`ll fuck it all up.Print`s are made up ahead of time and perferated.<br /><br />OK so you got your crystal dissolved and your paper cut and ready. There are 2 schools when it comes to putting it on the paper. First dump the solution in the pan and dip each tenpack into it then lift it up and let any excess solution run off into the pan. Second method is to put the tenpack into the pan and squirt the solution on it with a baby syringe(the ones they give little kids medicine with). I Have done both and prefer dipping them just because its quicker .Then the tenpacks are layed out to dry which doesn`t take long since alcohol evaporates quickly. If you did it right there will be very little residue left in the bottom of the pan.This redidue is extremely potent and is either soaked up with a piece of paper(called mop up) or made into potent liquid(called wash). Whatever you choose this is saved for your personal use. While your doing all this you get very,very high. As soon as you open the jar of crystal it intoxicates the air. Most people were rubber gloves when doing this some don`t. Just don`t have any plans afterwards.<br /><br />There might be slightly different methods used when laying, but this is how the dead family does it. After the tenpacks are dryed there distibuted and eaten up. Since the end of the Grateful Dead the massive distribution network that used to get rid of so much acid has been broken up badly.

				Provided that the acid is evenly divided over the blotter, cutting in into equally sized pieces with scissors is perfectly fine. <br /><br />As for not touching it with your hands: how about gloves? Wearing lab gloves with any substance some is going to ingest (or even inject) would be a basic sanity requirement. This also goes when handling tablets and such - its not strictly required in that case, but would you really want a tablet of xtc that has litterally passed through several hands?

				Instead of cutting it into miniscule pieces, you can chuck it in a few mL of distilled water or everclear or very high proof vodka, and microdose off of that via dropper if you measure the liquid out correctly. The LSD will dissolve into the water/alcohol just fine, as long as you make sure to give it a good stirring/shaking.

				Hey @blackya, I&#039;ve been microdosing with LSD bloter and cutting it the following way:<br /><br />I used an X-Acto knife, medium thick blade. First I scored the blotter into however many pieces I&#039;m trying to cut. I cut mine into 16ths but this is totally up to you. Then I will cut a piece off as needed. That way I dont have to mess with 16 little tiny squares; it all stays together and I just cut one off and eat it. <br /><br />When cutting a piece off I just cut along the scored lines. You only have to make 2 cuts at any time, so its not too difficult. I just repeat the stroke slowly along the cut lines until the knife cuts all the way through. If you do it too fast or use too much force, you run the risk of sending a little tiny LSD square flying through your house. Trust me, they&#039;re a bitch to find ;) so I just prefer to go slow and deliberate.<br /><br />I hope this helps!
