				Smoked some weed last night and got a call from the PO about taking a drug test in about 4 hours. I&#039;ve been drinking water, took some creatine, and some b12. Any other suggestions?

				Dude. You&#039;re probably fucked. Sorry to say. <br /><br />You could take niacin. That may help. I&#039;ve heard it takes THC out of your system. Just keep drinking a shit ton of water and Gatorade. <br /><br />Good luck.

				Drink vinegar and inject your bladder with a saline solution prior to the test.

				Run to your local head shop, pick up some synthetic urine. You can heat it up in the microwave and strap the included handwarmer on to keep it the proper temp for hours. Smuggle it in somehow (crotch it, tape it to leg etc.). If they watch you piss get a urinator (fake dick that the piss goes thru).<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />weedsaves

				Just drink a shitload of water+ cranberry juice + a cup of vinegar and piss as much as you can before the test.&nbsp; &nbsp;Niacin doesnt do jack.&nbsp; They can see high levels of creatine i believe.&nbsp; Your best bet is too simply wash out your bladder as well as dilute your piss a bit to pass. Good luck

				This always worked for me in the past, but I&#039;m not sure why you would want to go through all of this anymore when there is synthetic weed now...<br /><br />1. Get a jug of Ocean Spray 100% Cranberry Juice (Make sure you get the one that says 100%) - Try to drink all of this in less than 20 minutes<br /><br />2. Take vitamin b12 (B12 Pills work, but I&#039;ve found the B12 liquid works best for making you urine more yellow)<br /><br />3. Start drinking water like crazy for the next few hours....about 20 fl oz bottle of water every 10 minutes (Occasionally take more b12)<br /><br /><br />Every 5-10 minutes you should have to pee like you haven&#039;t pissed all day! If 10 minutes goes by since you last took a piss, and you don&#039;t have to pee so bad you can&#039;t stand it...then you didn&#039;t drink enough water.<br /><br />I recommend starting this whole process about 4 hours before you have to take the test and continue to drink water and take b12 up until 30 minutes before you take the test.<br /><br />

				First and foremost, any tampering of the urine is an automatic positive. So if its watered down so much that is bascially water coming out, that is a positive. If it is too acidic (i.e. drinking vinegar) it comes out as a positive. They screen for all masking agents.<br />The only option is goto the headshop buy a fake dick to pee out of and someone else&#039;s urine.
