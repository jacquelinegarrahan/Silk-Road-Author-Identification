				I&#039;m watching this incredibly fucked up movie/documentary called &quot;Snow On Tha Bluff&quot; and this dealer is carrying a camera around with him through all his daily shit, and at one point they go into a normal looking house but there are 2 women making crack on stoves in the kitchen and they&#039;re both naked. Everyone else in the house is clothed but them.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know shit about crack or the practices of making it, but this is not the first time I&#039;ve seen this practice either... what is the purpose? I&#039;ve always wondered that and figured you guys know.

				Also, residue from the process gets all over your clothes.&nbsp; So when the cops bust in with a warrant and everyone is flipping to flush everything they have, the cops take anything they can as &#039;evidence&#039; to incriminate those involved.<br /><br />It&#039;s taxing and often costly to obtain a search warrant (most of the time), so they do everything in their power to find ANYTHING they can to arrest you and not have to walk away empty handed like the loser cops they are.<br /><br />With a warrant they are permitted to seize any property (clothes included) they wish, and i&#039;m sure cops know 1000 different things by now to look for to take into evidence.<br /><br />But it could also be just that naked chicks are better then clothed chicks :P

				That&#039;s what I originally thought it might be, something to do with the clothes and chemicals on them or something.<br /><br />But I&#039;m pretty sure it was not just to see them naked, as these women were NOT the kind you would want to see with or without clothes :)

				Its more because of the stealing aspect, they do the same thing in the cocaine processing plants<br />and money houses - the money is counted by nobodies since its a long and tedious task that most large scale dealers<br />need done but don&#039;t want to do personally.<br />honestly the guys working those houses don&#039;t give a shit if the cooks get caught, its easy to find a new cook and it stops them from getting tagged.

				Despite some &quot;fake&quot; things, the wikipedia entry for the movie says:<br /><br />It is the story of Curtis Snow, a real Atlanta &quot;robbery boy and crack dealer whose livelihood revolves around armed robbery and drug pushing&quot; who &quot;sought out [director] Damon Russell to make a film about his life.&quot;<br /><br />An attempt on Curtis Snow&#039;s life occurred in December 2011. He survived a grisly box-cutter knife attack<br /><br />So maybe they had to stage stuff to film it, but apparently the main dude is real.

And certainly not nearly as effective at communicating and speaking on the level of the masses. I recommend checking out some of Degrasse Tyson&#039;s videos with TED; they&#039;re brilliant and accessible. That being said, I&#039;m guilty of hyperbole here as well, saying to find any person that&#039;s smarter. My point is that saying that all black Americans are uneducated and ignorant is, itself, ignorant. And retarded. I could counter with a comment that the guy who posted that is likely French, and launch into a tirade over France&#039;s history of cowardice and just being an overall cunt of a country, but that&#039;s not relevant. <br /><br />Documentary on crack looks interesting though - gonna check that out.
