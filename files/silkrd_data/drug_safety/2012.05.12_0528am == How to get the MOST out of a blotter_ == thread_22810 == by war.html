				Ive been experimenting around with between 500mcgs and 2.5mgs of 25i for a while now.&nbsp; I still think I had my most vivid trip off of just 1mg.&nbsp; What I have been doing with these tabs is just placing them in my upper lip and swallowing 30 mins later.&nbsp; I only have a single tab left and want to trip again before my re-orders arrive.&nbsp; What is the BEST way to get as much 25i out of the tab as possible.&nbsp; I did some research and saw that keeping it in your cheek and then chewing it every few minutes may be a good idea but I was under the impression saliva was bad on these blotters.<br /><br />Any insight/ideas would be great :)<br /><br />Thanks guys

				Only thing I can think of that would affect is is the time it&#039;s between your upper/lower lip and gum line.... It&#039;s destroyed by your stomach acid when you swallow it, so technically there&#039;s no difference between swallowing the blotter and spitting it out. I&#039;d just try to keep it in there as long as possible. You said you&#039;ve been toying with 500-2500 mcgs... I&#039;ve only eaten up to 1.25 mg and I thought that was PLENTY although I&#039;ve yet to make a SR purchase so I suppose I could be wrong about the doses I took... How was 2000+ mcgs for you?

				To get the most out of it, make sure you do not swallow your saliva.&nbsp; Lightly brushing your gum beforehand can aid absorption.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />@sl1pknot - yes, there is a difference between swallowing it and spitting it out.&nbsp; If you swallow it,&nbsp; it gets converted into 2c-i, which is 16 times less potent (than 25i-NBOMe).

				@sl1pknot - Honestly I could probably handle ALOT more than 2000+ mcgs however don&#039;t take that to mean my trip wasn&#039;t incredibly intense.&nbsp; There were definitely points in my 1.5+ 25i trips where my conciousness felt so open/alive that I could communicate with my friend and barely say any words out loud.&nbsp; Im not sure exactly how he felt but our conciousness seemed to interpret situations in very similar ways and when we would talk we would barely say any words as we could completely understand each other.<br /><br />Is telepathy possible on psychedelics?&nbsp; imo, DEFINITELY<br /><br />Could I just be insane? imo, DEFINITELY&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />@JellyLegs - Never nasally done any drug, im definitely willing to stick a sheet in my nose though just need some more insight from someone else on forum.&nbsp; I kinda think just leaving it in my nose during whole trip would be best idea.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Never taken 25-I, but my experience with LSD-25 is similar. <br /><br />I was tripping teeth on cid one night many moons ago, and playing a chess game with my buddy. We didnt speak for hours yet we were reading each others minds and we didnt have to say a word. Fucking intense night to say the least.

				There&#039;s barely any information about nasal administration, that&#039;s why we need someone to do some tests and write up an article or something.<br />Rectal and IV are always the most efficient ROAs (usually, unless they need liver processing and other things)<br /><br />With blotter, I assume it&#039;d probably be like, extract the chemical and then inject it.<br />Bit that&#039;s a pretty hectic process.<br /><br />Sublingual/buccal is most common, and I want more info on nasal.<br />

				I&#039;ll try a nasal test sometime this weekend/week.&nbsp; Are there any ways to increase absorption in my nose besides just leaving tab there?&nbsp;
