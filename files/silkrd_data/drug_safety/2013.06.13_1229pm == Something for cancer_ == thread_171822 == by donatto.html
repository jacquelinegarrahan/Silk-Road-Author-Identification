				Seriously though don&#039;t lose time with alternative medicine, it is nothing but a very very very very expensive placebo. <br />If its not something terminal he should just improve his overall health, eating varieties of food or taking multivitamines, doing exercise, etc..<br />A good safe trip with psychedelics can help him to deal with the situation, there were some recent trials with magic mushrooms for terminally ill patients with very positive results.

				It depends on what kind of cancer it is and what stage is has developed to.<br /><br />But if its considered to be fatal by oncologists, no drug will provide a cure - if it did they would be happy to prescribe it. <br /><br />That said one could use something like cannabis to make life more bearable, or perhaps curtail the effects of chemotherapy to some degree in earlier stages. Cannabis will probably not cure cancer, but once you are dying from it i see little reason not to use it if makes you feel any better even for a short amount of time.

				yes, some of you got it right, thanks anyway all of u. The thing is, not a terminal cancer for sure, high chance of total cure (said by oncologists), but, the onco said not smoke weed, but after smoke, he relief a lot of the nauseas and stomach issues, so that help a lot&nbsp; at least. I was talkin some more of, like the guy said AHCC, ganoderma lucidum, some natural things to get the immune system up and ready to fight back, i mean, after all, cancer its a sickness and weakness on the immune system cells, so, thats the reason. I&#039;ll be lookin at this thread for something to come up, will take care of all the responses and thanks again fellas.

				If being treated by chemotherapy or radiation, often you find cannabis is good if the person is struggling to put on weight.<br /><br />Cannabis can also ease the nausea bought on by treament.<br /><br />Smoking it may not be an opion, but eating it can help. It does help if the patient uses cannabis. Not everyone enjoys the effects of cannabis but at low doses, it can ease symptoms and help appetite.<br /><br />

				Dont let your friend smoke weed, let him vape instead. I recommend the Volcano for vaping, I have one myself and its the only one im really happy with after trying a few others. hxxp://volcanovaporizer.com<br /><br />And ofcourse, dont fall for any homeopatic bullshit, let regular healthcare do its job. The best of luck to your friend!

				Cancer is curable. Watch &#039;Race from the cure&#039; on youtube. <br /><br />Or watch Tommy Chong go on mainstream news and tell he has cancer but plans on beating it with hemp oil.<br /><br />Then watch the follow up with him back on the news a few months later 100% cured.<br /><br />Stay away from chemo.

				Seems like many people were cured eating only raw vegetables &amp; fresh juice. Helps to clean the body, and a diet with low proteins would prove good too... You might be able to find some interesting books about that in organic food shops and that kind of places..<br /><br />Herb juice (wheat, mostly) seems to be really interesting too, I know someone who got cured with that...<br /><br />Good luck to your friend :)

				A high alkaline diet helps with cancer, because the tumor cells cannot thrive in an alkaline envrionment. It needs an acidic environment to thrive.<br /><br />Also, ignore faggot doctors who say you can&#039;t smoke marijuana. It helps cancer. Ignore that fucking shit. Smoke up, eat some edibles, whatever helps your comfort. Because that is ALL that matters.<br /><br />Cancer is SHIT and I know this first hand.

				1. I love that there are so many people here that aren&#039;t taken over by that homeopathic garbage. That&#039;s what I think separates the SR community from the stupid, brainless drug users that want to just &quot;fuck the system&quot; including the whole healthcare system. I mean, it is a bit of a mess. I&#039;m not gonna overlook that. But it&#039;s definitely based mostly on hard science. So find a good doctor. A good doctor will do what is medically and scientifically proven to help. A bad doctor will just act like a robot. Don&#039;t pay a robot.<br /><br />2. This is going to sound totally new-age and &quot;homeopathic&quot; but I&#039;ve read several scientific and medical studies which show that Ayahuasca administered by shamans in South America has, in fact, cured cancer. Totally cured it. Every trace of the cancer gone after 2-3 sessions. Possibly consider taking your friend to South America to try Ayahuasca? If you look it up on google I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find the sources pretty quickly.<br /><br />3. Marijuana is DEFINITELY a good option here. It doesn&#039;t necessarily work for everyone, but if it helps your friend then by all means: GIVE HIM DAT DECA DOSE ;)<br /><br />Much love, y&#039;all.

				I wouldn&#039;t go as far as to state that ayahuasca can cure cancer, but it is a DMT rich plant resulting in experiences equal to taking pure DMT as a drug. <br /><br />As a herbal concoction it will usually come with other active, plant derived, ingredients such as MAO inhibitors that increase the overall effect of the brew, even is the DMT dose is relatively low.<br /><br />Should you test this when diagnosed with terminal cancer? I don&#039;t see why not really. It may not cure your ailment, but even if it doesnt it will be a nice experience especially when you take a trip to south america to try. Everyone will die at some point, and if that point comes closer due to cancer i see no reason not to explore what is out there as long as you can do so comfortably. <br /><br /><br />

				You will not/not find a cure for cancer on SR. You may hear all kinds of anecdotes about this or that curing cancer but there is no hard evidence to back it up. The thing about cancer, though, is sometimes people DO go into remission. And it is human nature to attribute whatever it was they were doing or taking to that remission. But all evidence points to it just being coincidence. If you went into remission while taking Ayahuasca or some other substance you would have gone into remission without it.<br /><br />Think about it, if such a substance were proven to cure cancer someone would have been awarded the Nobel prize for it already.<br /><br />Now, there are plenty of things available at SR that can help you with the discomfort of cancer and with the discomfort of going through treatments like chemo.
