				Hey guys with Coachella coming up next week, I am hoping to get some input from some educated individuals on possible 3 day festival &quot;drug line-ups&quot; that minimize risk of neurological damage and other physical harm. With current research we have seen that taking MDMA 3 days in a row is not practical and can definitely have negative implications. <br /><br />Any input is much appreciated!

				This would be my personal lineup. I would seriously keep the MDMA for the last day so to avoid it potentially draining you the rest of the days you are there. MDMA can definitely exhaust your body if you do not properly supplement, overexert your body (keep your body temperature low!), and get a good nights rest. I would also highly recommend grabbing a few benzos (etizolam is my favorite) so you can sleep like a baby each night and wake up feeling refreshed. :)<br /><br />Day 1: 400ug LSD<br />Day 2: 30mg 4-AcO DMT, then 30mg of 2C-B 4 hours later<br />Day 3: 100mg MDMA/80mg MDA, then a 50mg/40mg booster 2 hours later

				AnimusVox has a pretty good layout right there. Maybe slightly less 2C-B if you haven&#039;t done it before, 22-25mg maybe. You&#039;ll more than likely be fine with 30mg but hey, just my opinion :)<br /><br />Good idea with the benzos too!

				The rise in 2C-B dosage is due to the cross tolerance experienced from taking the 4-AcO-DMT. :) While 4-AcO-DMT is a tryptamine and 2C-B a phenethylamine, you will still notice a slight cross tolerance and it&#039;s always good to plan your dosage accordingly. Also, you&#039;ll be taking LSD the day before which also exerts a slight cross tolerance on both 2C-B and 4-AcO-DMT, so that&#039;s another reason I advise such dosages. Much love! :)

I knew there would be slight cross tolerance with LSD, hence the 25mg choice, I personally started on 20mg and found it incredibly satisfying. Lovely colour enhancement and CEV&#039;s. Thought it was perfect. I recently took 25mg and the dose/response curve is pretty steep. Still bearable but maybe a bit much.<br /><br />All personal preference :) If you choose exactly as AnimusVox says then you won&#039;t go far wrong at all :D Hope you have a great time azmotox1 :)&nbsp;

				Yes, the cross tolerance isn&#039;t all that extreme, but it&#039;s definitely notable in my experience. :) As you&#039;ve stated, it&#039;s very much recommended to adjust your dosages based on how we each personally feel with each substance. The dose/response curve for both 4-AcO and 2C-B is quite steep and caution should definitely be advised. :) Everyone&#039;s mileage certainly varies!

So much knowledge I bow down to you! I have actually never tried 4-aco-dmt or 2c-b so that seems like a very wild day!

				I&#039;ll be at Coachella too, only wk 2. And hilariously enough, my drug combo plan is nearly identical to the one suggested, with a little craft beer to round out the evening, once psychs have trailed off (that was a pun.) My alterations are ~30mg 4-HO-MET after 3 hits of HollandOnline&#039;s ~113ug verified/ ~130ug claimed acid that I tested a few weeks ago and was quite nice. Never tried 4-HO-MET but liked psilocin, so should be pretty good. And instead of 2CB, I&#039;ll likely take 1mg 25i, but unsure if to take on evening of day 2, or along with/ post MDMA day 3? Oh, and no MDA combo in my schedule, though I like the thought and would surely include it if I had some. And some etizolam powder if dude comes through with it, hopefully some sort of benzo to come down with but its getting down to the wire for shipping times and what not. Ah, man, drugs and music... its like they were made for each other.

				Happy Prechella guys! I am super worried as I ordered 100g from both Dutchtrade and Interways 17days ago and nothing has shown. Most people are getting them in around a week&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />What are the rules for redosing on LSD? If I take my first 2 tabs around 2-3 in the afternoon it&#039;ll be done by the last shows at 10-11pm is there a latest time after initial dose to redose?

				Day 1: LSD<br />Day 2: MDMA, bit of weed on the comedown<br />Day 3: 2CB or 2C-X, take random drugs from strangers<br />Day 4: Ketamine or MXE<br />Day 5: When you get home take Soma or Vicodin to help with how sore your body will be, but I wouldn&#039;t take a big recreational dose because it might kill the &quot;afterglow&quot; of your experiences.<br /><br />Also, I advice against benzos at the festival. You might forget a lot of the experience. Someone said to take Etizolam, it might be a good idea but I wouldn&#039;t take more than .5mg or 1mg. However, I am a hypocrite and that&#039;s how I slept during a festival last year.

				It&#039;s good to have some nice coke too. A good little pick me up when the energy levels start to drop, although 20 years ago I had much better powers of recovery!<br /><br />Depending on the festy though a lot of people just take whatever they can get their hands on!

				I&#039;m heading to a 4 day fest in a few weeks. My schedule looks something like this:<br /><br />Day 1: Beer/Moonshine/Pot<br />Day 2: LSD<br />Day 3: LSD + MDMA<br />Day 4: Even more LSD + even more MDMA<br /><br />I love LSD. Of course there will be beer/moonshine/pot the whole weekend. I don&#039;t typically like to mess with 2C&#039;s or other RC&#039;s, just like to stick to the old tried and true.

				For me it would be:<br /><br />Booze, Methadrone (I now find MDMA too intense (sp?)), Oxycontin or Herion, base (speed, just to keep awake not for the high) and K (lots of). Oh and some Xanax for sleeping. And a bit of whats going around. <br /><br />
