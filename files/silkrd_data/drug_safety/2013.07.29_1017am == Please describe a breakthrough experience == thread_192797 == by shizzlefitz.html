				I&#039;ve never had one and would like to know what it&#039;s like. After reading dozens or hundreds of erowid reports I still can&#039;t get a sense of what a profound breakthrough is like on DMT, Salvia or strong LSD.<br /><br />Tonight I flared up about 75mg of DMT in three big bong hits and while it was a pleasant 10 minutes or so it was far from what the CGI scenes in Enter The Void appear like. I&#039;m still aware of my surrounding and with eyes closed I still see basically the same dark red background you and I would normally see when sober. Just some faintly colored patterns overlaid and a general feeling of being really stoned. During my trip I remember saying to myself &quot;shit when I die my brain better put on a better show than this!&quot;<br /><br />I wonder if there is a dose or method strong enough that it will basically take me away to a different reality that seems every bit as real as the here and now. Kinda like being shot into a Dali world where I don&#039;t even remember having toked up. Is this possible?

				A breakthrough experience is where you jist don&#039;t exist and your floating through hyperspace. Only had two. But like the guy said hold in your hits

				One of the most intense feelings one can go through.&nbsp; It happens so quick.&nbsp; I see people dancing around, waving their hands in front of me, kinda like playing with me, because Im not really dying and they know this.

				An out of body experience, something of spiritual significance, the feeling of you disolving into surrounding, becoming everything, and everything becomes you, unable to know your ego for some moments, sort of enlightenment...

				Yup, these replies have it right. It hits you so fucking fast it&#039;s easy to be overwhelmed. It&#039;s nothing like acid where it builds up gradually so you&#039;re prepared for the weird shit to happen, you go from being normal to absolutely fucked in a matter of seconds. Then there is also the fact it&#039;s not uncommon to completely forget you&#039;re on drugs after you&#039;ve broken through. When I broke through bigtime on salvia I had no idea who or what I was, I had no concept of what a human was.
