				Just got some Oxycodone from RoxiPal as a sample:<br /><br />I think I&#039;ve tried Oxy before, but that would be like two years ago and at 5mg. This was a 30mg. 48 12 V.<br /><br />I&#039;m feeling fucking awesome, plus I smoked two blunts.<br /><br />Is the comedown bad?

				Not from just one 30mg Oxy.&nbsp; You might feel a little bit down, but odds are that you will feel fine.<br /><br />Now, if you start doing 30mg Oxy&#039;s every day for a week, yes, you are going to probably feel like shit about 1-2 days after you stop taking them.&nbsp; <br /><br />The trick is to not do them more than a day or so in a row, and wait at least 1-2 weeks before doing more.&nbsp; The more you do, the more your tolerance will build and the worse you will feel when you stop taking them.<br /><br />Keep in mind that Oxy&#039;s are just Heroin by another name (some forms of Oxy such as Hydromorphone are even stronger than H).<br />

				Thanks captainjojo, +1. Basically what was going through my mind last night was, &quot;Man, this feels way too good for me to just slowly come off this with no regrets.&quot; Turned out to be absolutely fine though. I decided to just get some sleep and dozed off very comfortably, which is amazing due to my sleeping problems. I felt very slightly overwhelmed at random points throughout the night - maybe the better word is anxious. Turned out to be a great experience though! ;D
