				That really depends on your age and the type of person you are. If you&#039;re willing to research the shit out of everything you do and take responsible doses, there&#039;s little I&#039;d recommend that you avoid. If you&#039;re a mentally unstable and inexperienced 16 year-old who just wants to get &quot;high&quot;, then I&#039;d ask that you take it easy until you mature, both mentally and physically.<br /><br />That being said, starting off with weed isn&#039;t a bad idea. Although I&#039;m not a huge fan of it, marijuana is a fairly benign and safe drug. After that you can delve into psychedelics like LSD and mushrooms, although only if you&#039;re mentally healthy and in a good setting. MDMA is also a must, both for use in public settings (like a music festival) and alone for therapeutic purposes. <br /><br />If you like feeling in control when you&#039;re under the influence, you could also check out stimulants like speed/adderall. If you don&#039;t mind having the trip take over, exploring other psychedelics is also good option.<br />

Probably a good thing in the long-term though!) <br />19: Cocaine <br />19: MDMA <br />19: Tobacco (hate that shit, only did it when really drunk or when rolling)<br />20: Mushrooms <br />20: LSD <br />20: OxyContin<br />20: Ketamine <br />20: 2C-B <br />21: MDA

				I would say it depends on why you want to do drugs. Drugs shouldn&#039;t be done just for their own sake, but should be used as tools, whether it be for medication, consciousness exploration, relaxation, sleep, ease in social situations, or concentration/productivity. That said, the best drug is carfentanil, according to op-heads who have had it. Totally objective, haha.<br /><br />First drug? I have a very old memory of sipping some wine around the age of three or so, thinking it was water. I may have had caffeine by then though since my dad worked for Coca-Cola.

				my first drug was heroin. well first nicotine second alcohol but third heroin.<br /><br />at 6 years old my first cigarette<br />at 15 years old i buy cigarettes and alcohol myself but never get into them<br />at 18-19 years old (before 19 birthday basically) i start snorting to build up tolerance and already have bought needles before even trying heroin lol<br />Later i start using benzodiazepines and have tried alot of them for the withdrawals and so on. I also shot diazepam and midazolam liquid.<br />Then i try shooting simple amphetamine (not meth)<br /><br />well now i&#039;m 20,5 years old.<br /><br />i suggest you look up effects of the drugs and see what you want. i personally ordered some amphetamine , crystal meth and cocaine but orders keep saying processing so i really don&#039;t know if they,ve been shipped yet. im gonna shoot these 3 too.<br />

				If you want to start out slow you can take some lighter drugs with similar effects to the more popular ones. For instance 4-HO-MET before taking shrooms, bk-MDMA before taking MDMA, 25i-NBOMe &amp; 25c-NBOMe can be like LSD and Mescaline, there&#039;s quite a lot if you research them.<br /><br />In the long run I definitely advise trying the various forms of cannabis to love yourself (concentrates, edibles, caviar, etc), Psilocybin Mushrooms to love the earth, MDMA to love humanity, LSD to love the universe, Mescaline to love music (or just creativity/art in general), any form of DMT to love existence (spice, changa, ayahuasca, etc), Ketamine to love your mind, Salvia to love your reality, and because I could go on and on I&#039;ll make it easy on you and say research the hell out of every new psychedelic you can find the name of and if the pros seem to outweigh the cons try it because you&#039;ll never know what you might enjoy and you&#039;ll learn more than you could ever imagine about how you fit into this crazy little thing called life. ^-^

				Honestly I would recommend your research the shit out of every drug you are interested in, erowid would be a good start. Google will be your friend in this decision. after you have done your research, the only other advice I would have is to obtain only a small amount to see if you like it, and do it somewhere that you are comfortable (ie your house) and make sure you have no where to go during the duration of said drug (erowid can help with that too). Also make sure you have some food for munchies and a drink for cotton mouth (some drugs can cause said symptoms) so you do not have to go anywhere.

				Dude honestly, If you come here asking this question. Then It&#039;s obvious that you really don&#039;t know what your doing. That&#039;s all I have to say about this thread. I originally came here for the &quot;LSD&quot; because I wanted some and had no hooks IRL for that. I found this place all on my own.
