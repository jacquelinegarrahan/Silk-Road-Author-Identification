				If you have the choice, go for LSD. 25i is worth the experience though. So if you like to experiment you should probably try both. Be careful though, some unlucky individuals get seizures or allergic reactions on 25i. And don&#039;t listen to the 25i haters. For some reason they think it&#039;s okay for them to try to scare people away from NBOMes instead of educating them on the matter objectively. They think they&#039;re so much better than those anti-drug fearmongers while in reality they&#039;re clearly not.<br />/rant

				never tried nbome. but people have died from it. no one has died from LSD. When I trip, the knowledge that no one has ever died from the drug helps my anxiety if I get a bad trip.<br /><br />So I would go with LSD

				I tried 25i-nbome recently. I was attracted by the cheaper price compared to LSD. <br /><br />Fuck me sideways. Never again.<br />Muscle cramps and awful anxiety. Horrid stuff.<br /><br />Stick with LSD, I know I will be. <br />An infinitely better experience.<br /><br />25i-nbome will make you see stuff it&#039;s true, but it&#039;s fucking nasty.

				&quot;Research chemical&quot; is a term given to these chemicals so that they could be sold legally before they were legally changed to controlled substances.&nbsp; But to some the term means other things.&nbsp; Since it means different things to different people and because most of these drugs/analogs are now controlled substances it is a meaningless term now.<br /><br />As for 25i-NBOMe I&#039;ll never use it after bad experiences with 25c-NBOMe.&nbsp; Some people like NBOMe chemical but a lot of people hate them and they definitely don&#039;t have the proven track record of LSD.<br /><br />I do however enjoy 2C-B.<br /><br />LSD is wonderful though.&nbsp; Go with that if you haven&#039;t tripped in a year.&nbsp; There is finally lots of quality LSD available on the road.

Research chemicals are chemicals designed for research purposes. 2Cs were designed as psychedelics so they aren&#039;t research chemicals. 25i for example on the other hand was designed as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography. Many stimulants on the RC market today are actually anorectic drugs which have failed in testing for inducing euphoria and being too addictive.

				^ That last link is new, and as far as I know is the only reported death from 25C. Very sad. Selling this stuff as a powder seems inherently irresponsible. It is of course going to end up in hands of teenagers, and then it&#039;s just a matter of time before someone just says &quot;lets have a line&quot; and racks up a line of white powder the size of any other.<br /><br />The number of people with scales up to the task of measuring out doses of this stuff must be very very small. Research chemicals like this are dangerous enough, no need to sell them in the most dangerous way possible.

				I agree with those stating that the 25 series can be dangerous.&nbsp; I have tried 25i and 25b.&nbsp; I would say that if you can get LSD, do LSD.&nbsp; The problem, is making sure it is LSD.&nbsp; With the ridiculously cheap price of Nbome&#039;s, it is very hard to be sure you are getting pure LSD.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I did 25i I was by myself.&nbsp; I started with 1 1000ug tab, waited about 1.5 hours, and took another tab.&nbsp; At this point, they both kicked in very hard.&nbsp; I was at my house, sitting outside, watching a fire.&nbsp; I found that the come-up was very pleasant, and there was very little body-load.&nbsp; To me, it was like a good mushroom trip times 10.&nbsp; It lasted about 8 hours, and the come-down was very easy.<br /><br />Now to 25b.&nbsp; I took this with my brother and his wife.&nbsp; We again started with 1 tab (1000ug), and waited about 45 mins, then took another tab.&nbsp; Again, the come-up was very nice, but the body-load once tripping was very heavy.&nbsp; We tripped for about 4 hours, then my sister-in-law went to lay down, as she had to work in about 4 hours.&nbsp; My brother and I decided to take another tab (my mistake).&nbsp; He wasn&#039;t tripping as hard as us, so I figured another tab couldn&#039;t hurt.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t notice that I was tripping any harder, but he did notice additional effects.&nbsp; He decided to go lay down for a bit, and this left me to my own thoughts.&nbsp; I was still tripping pretty hard by the time my sister-in-law got up to go to work, and this started to worry me.&nbsp; I worried that she was still tripping, and had to go to work, and I worried that I was tripping too hard to drive home and deal with my wife.&nbsp; This made me go through some bad looping, and made me feel very hot and nervous.&nbsp; I started sweating really bad, and felt like the drug was never going to let go.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t until about 8-10 hours later that I felt fairly normal.<br /><br />These chemicals are all about setting, and mind-set.&nbsp; If you go into the trip in a bad mood or with bad thoughts, you will have a bad time.&nbsp; If you go into it knowing that everything is okay, and realizing that it WILL end, then you will most likely have a life changing experience.&nbsp; These chemicals are very potent....so start small, give it plenty of time before re-dosing, and make sure you are in a comfortable place that you can hang out at for a long time.&nbsp; These are not horrible chemicals, but should be treated with respect like any other drug.

				I have lots of experience with the NBOMe series and I think they can be fun, but if you offered me LSD instead hell fucking yes I would take that over an NBOMe. They&#039;re fucking dangerous. They don&#039;t have a safety profile like LSD and considering that a relatively minor miscalculation in dosage can be fatal I don&#039;t think anyone but the most responsible and experienced drug users should have access to it. It&#039;s not surprising at all that some dumbass teenagers have died doing it, but hey, that&#039;s just another result of our wonderful war on drugs.

This guy has the right idea.&nbsp; I agree that this chemical should NOT be put into the hands of the inexperienced.&nbsp; 3 tabs of this could certainly make someone who is not experienced with psych&#039;s freak out.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even imagine what those who got it in powder form and did lines went through.&nbsp; People really need to understand that not all drugs are like weed, and not all people can handle the effects of psychedelics.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been tripping for 10+ years, and this chemical made me question whether I should be doing psychedelics anymore (I decided I should...but still).<br /><br />
