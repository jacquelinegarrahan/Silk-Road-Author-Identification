				Hey guys, <br /><br />In my area, pure DMT is rare, but the ayahuasca plant (B. Caapi) is sold freely for &quot;medicinal purposes&quot;. I&#039;ve tried shrooms and LSD, but somehow an 8 hour DMT trip scares the shit out of me, so I decided to purify it and give me a 20 min trip to another galaxy ;)<br /><br />I was wondering, any cooks here recommend a certain tek ? There are multiple, but I was wondering if any of you guys have experience with a simple,effective one ;)<br /><br />Oh, and I&#039;ll be making it in my kitchen, so how bad does it smell ? ;)<br /><br />Peace

				From what I&#039;ve heard,&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />A/B Tek (acid-base extraction) is best, certainly for mimosa, and probably caapi too.<br /><br />Can smell pretty bad depending on which A/B&#039;s you use: citric acid is best (odorless), vinegar is worst. Hydrochloric/muriatic fastest, and somewhere in the middle (pool smell). You tend not to notice any odor whilst cooking, your nose must &quot;adapt&quot;. Then a friend will stop by, freaking out about the weird smell down the hall... It&#039;s worth trying to preserve your sense of smell by using a respirator, and occasionally checking the ambience by removing it...<br /><br />Solvent choice can be a bit complicated, depending on what you can obtain. Understand polar &amp; non-polar solvents and don&#039;t try to substitute polar for non-polar, or vice versa... The &quot;best&quot; solvent (i.e. evaporates fastest, to give you your product quickly) will be the stinkiest, cos it&#039;s evaporating so quickly!<br /><br />Then you just have to learn how to freebase it properly... 8)<br /><br />Loads of info at www.dmt-nexus.com<br /><br />Good luck

				B. caapi would not be the recommended plant material to use for extraction.<br /><br />In general, M. Hostilis is much preferred due to lower price compared to overall higher alkaloid content and less tannins. There are many possibilities however.<br /><br />

				This guide could be adapted for other dmt containing plant material, but as mentioned B Caapi is just half of the ayahuasca, it stops your body breaking the dmt down before it gets to the head.&nbsp; <br /><br />If your in Latin America then you should be able to get the other half of the ayahuasca recipe, you need to talk with the shaman or some one who knows, there is often confusion amongst the indigenous as to what the ayahuasca is, many believe it is just the maoi containing part indeed, however this is always mixed with another thing (often root bark)<br /><br />There&#039;s an exhaustive list of dmt containing plants at http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=8680

				Seems I was looking at the wrong plant ;) I see M. Hostilis is also sold here, so I&#039;d get that one. Is it worth to pay more for the powdered form of it or is it easy to crush it yourself?<br /><br />

I also recommend the STB Tek for a first timer. Very simple and straightforward. Perfect for a first timer. Comes with easy pictures to use. Check it out on the shroomery.
