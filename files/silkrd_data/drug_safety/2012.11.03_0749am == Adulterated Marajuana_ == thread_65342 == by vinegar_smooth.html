				So a little while back I was at a music festival, very good times, lots of people tripping balls. Well, there was this one dude that rolled over to our area and made friends with a buddy of mine. This guy was dealing coke and E, so I knew he was slinging his stuff. My buddy bought some of the coke and they were hitting that all night. Well, at some point this guy busts out a jar with some funky ass buds. I&#039;m not really a pharma or narcotics guy myself, but I appreciate hallucinogens. It&#039;s pretty dark so I didn&#039;t get a good look see. Now I have smoked a fairly decent number of varieties and basically it usually takes a minute to set in. I took a hit of this out of a vape and it immediately hit me in a way that does not usually happen; and I&#039;ve gotten some very good material from SR. <br /><br />Do people spike their weed when they are selling? Maybe sprinkle it with something else to make it seem more appealing? To be honest I didn&#039;t trust the guy, but I had been smoking a lot so perhaps I just got the paranoia. What do you think? Does that shit happen? How often?

				It does happen - tainting pot with substances that are (more) addictive to retain customers.<br /><br />Its mostly a street thing, and what substances are used can very wildly. In some cases opiates are added in order to fuel addiction, and that obviously is a serious health hazard. Reputable cannabis vendors would not resort to this, but on the streets these things happen.

				I want to say that I have had some stuff hit me INSTANTLY, before. Just one, from a vendor on the Road that I trust, but I was high literally before I exhaled. It was some thc-oil stuff and it only happened on the final dose I had from it, but still... it can happen.

				i dont think its very common, but its always a possibility<br /><br />i dont really think opioids are feasible - many dont smoke well with open flame but instead degrade and it would not be economical because of how expensive opioids are in comparison to the price of green<br /><br />what does occur in places like the NL bars evidently is adulteration using substances that enhance the look of the bud and adds weight - which is the main motivation, greed - add weight and you sell less actual bud for more money<br /><br />also i have heard of people spraying synthetic cannabinoids on low potency bud to try and pass it off as higher quality and worth a higher price unfortunately

				Some vendors spike lousy herb with research chemicals like JWH-*** or other synthetic cannabinoids.&nbsp; I would be mad as hell if someone spritzed chems on the top-shelf stuff, but I don&#039;t see a downside for regular commercial weed if the buyer knows that they are getting spritzed product.&nbsp; The problem is that you have to trust that the vendors knows about RCs and actually knows which RCs are on the product.&nbsp; Personally, I like to know what chems I am ingesting and in what amount.<br /><br />Some recreational users will spritz stuff on their weed for fun or an enhanced high.&nbsp; These people need to be careful.&nbsp; Some people used to put PCP on their weed and then say that they had spiked it with embalming fluid.&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s cute, but this idiot in one of my college courses (we&#039;re talking a decade back here) actually spritzed formaldehyde on her herb.&nbsp; Ugh.

				she should actually be able to spray all the formaldehyde on her bud she likes i believe, without any danger - as long as it is pure formaldehyde and as long it was allowed to COMPLETELY dry before anyone used it&nbsp; - it would all just evaporate away <br /><br />just like using acetone for a solvent for synthetics and spraying it on - it will just evaporate away and leave the solute<br /><br />not saying anyone should ever actually use formaldehyde as a solvent - it might not actually completely evaporate, but formaldehyde is actually a common pollutant in the air so people inhale it in small amounts frequently <br /><br />pretty sure that is more of a myth - did you actually smoke that bud and get sick?<br /><br />(hey blargh! i havent seen you around lately)&nbsp;

				Formaldehyde would be one of the oddest things indeed, especially since its a gas at room temperature and pressure. The solution in water (formalin) as used to preserve tissues in museum jars would be something else, but still pretty idiotic to use. Also, formalin (and formaldehyde) have a very nasty smell to them, making it easy to detect even for someone who has never smoked pot before. <br /><br />Research cannabinoids could be an option. With rising THC levels in the stronger strains of pot, users expect much bang for the gram all the time. If you were to grow plants that were perfectly good in the 70s and 80s, they would now be considered to be very weak, and adding research cannabinoids to their product may &#039;improve&#039; their effects to modern standards. <br /><br />I suppose the concept of variyng strength in pot has faded a bit. Its can be like having wine and vodka, and expecting the same effect from an equal amount of each - it simply doesn&#039;t work like that, though there are plenty of people that prefer drinking wine over drinking vodka. The problem arises when you are selling them wine as vodka and they start complaining it doesn&#039;t work. In that analogy you may simply add ethanol to the wine, which would work, but probably be frowned upon as well.
