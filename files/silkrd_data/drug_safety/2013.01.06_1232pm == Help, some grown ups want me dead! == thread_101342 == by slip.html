				Hi, I thought I had recently killed my friend.<br /><br />My friend took 1 gram of mdma and a 0.5gram of cokane, washed down wiv a cola drink.<br />He went into a spazmo mode, the fool.<br /><br />Turns out that he had freaked out and called his mom who was on holiday at the time, leaving him in the house by himself.<br />He woke and called her when I had gone back to mine. He must of left his mobile in the house coz I cud hear it ringing the next day.<br /><br />The fool took drugs and was freaking out, this is why he called his auntie across state. Auntie must off started freaking out too and drove all the way over to go and get him and take him too her house.<br /><br />Basically those Cruel Bastards just left me hanging and let me believe that he woz dead from a OD. Now my freind turns out to be a grass and told them everything. He sed that it woz me who gave him the drugz!<br />Fuckin snitch!<br />Now his mom and pop came back to his house and they get a phone call that sayz aunti and uncle are on the way over with my little &#039;snitchy&#039; friend. <br />Snitchy friend&#039;s mom is real mad and she phoned my mom.<br />Now my mom is real mad, at me.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT FAIR!<br />The little bastard took the drugs off hiz own free will and I spent 2 day sick with worry that I might get wrong for murda!<br />He is ok medically (apart from needing dialysis for rest of his life),&nbsp; but is not my friend ne more coz of wot he did 2 me.<br /><br />So his mom is on the way over to my mom and I need to run away from home until shit calms down.<br />I think his dad might have a gun, so should I order a hit off the internet and get his dad killed before he gets to me.<br />I listen to rap, I know how this shit works.

				Are you fucking kidding me...&quot;some grown ups want me dead&quot; really?<br />Get the fuck off this site you little bitch tween.<br />You gave your 12 year old friend-who&#039;d never done drugs before-that much drugs, watched him deteriorate, left him by himself all fucked up and now you&#039;re pissed because he told his parents that you gave it to him...and now since you fucked up his liver and he needs dialysis for the fucking rest of his life?! And YOU&#039;RE pissed at him?<br />You need to fucking get off the crack, meth, whatever that you&#039;re on, and do some serious thinking.<br />I cannot believe you&#039;re that stupid of a person...but then again you are a little bitch tween.<br />Like a told you before...you sir. are an idiot.<br />I can&#039;t believe you even said in another thread &quot;yeah, dare fuck with me...blahblahblah&quot; <br />I&#039;m not threatened by 12 year olds...who think they&#039;re bad asses...who almost kill their friends...and then talk about how that friend is a snitch...and get their diaper in a wad...<br />Go get your pull ups on and your big boy pants and grow the fuck up, bitch.

				Damn it! How are people under 18 getting on here! Isn&#039;t there one of those buttons that say don&#039;t enter if under a certain age on this site?! HOW CAN THEY BYPASS THAT!!!<br /><br />Seriously kid, smarten yourself up. Do your research and be careful who you&#039;re dealing with. Don&#039;t fuck up your life before you have a chance to live any of it. I made a few close calls back in the day and I&#039;m grateful for all of the free passes I must have gotten to escape certain situations. <br /><br />I still had to learn the hard way so I mean this kindly: educate yourself. Not just whatever mandatory schooling you need but start questioning your thoughts. You are cursed with poor common sense and I&#039;ve been there. You made several mistakes: giving a kid an entire gram of MDMA and letting him eat it all...then letting him chase it with other drugs. <br /><br />Did he rat on you? Yes. But you should have had his back first by only giving him about a tenth of what you did (in reality, at that age, neither of you should be fucking up your bodies like that but I can&#039;t throw these stones what with the glass house I used to live in). <br /><br /><br />Long story short: cut back on the drugs. The goal should be to be completely clean or use small amounts of weed if you have to until you get to 18 at least (20 would be better) before you start abusing drugs that can seriously fuck with your body. You&#039;re at a point in your life where your body is fucking with you constantly, try to avoid adding more fuckery on top of that. <br /><br />Good luck, and, for your sake, get off these forums before you really get in trouble. <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Snoopish

The education, however, should not be! None of the vendors on SR, and certainly no street dealers, have time, or even necessarily care, to teach safety fundamentals to buyers. Instead of money being wasted on &quot;fighting&quot; drugs, money should be used to educate people on drugs (which does not mean invoke fear-mongering and biased views). The vendors are out to make money. It&#039;s the consumer&#039;s job to take care of themselves. But some consumers suck at their jobs and need help so drugs stop getting such a bad rep. <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Snoopish

I imagine spammers and trolls are the same way in terms of finding a solution. It&#039;s an open forum so mods could constantly ban users and delete threads and those same users could just keep coming back if so inclined. <br /><br />I agree more moderation would help keep the boards clean but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s something that has a lot of priority simply due to the number of man-hours the mods have + the practicality of available solutions versus the other goals they need to meet.

				Carnt beleive all the shit I am taking for this. From the forum and my fokes.<br />At 1st my freinds mom woz threatening to call the cops on me.<br />Then later on my freinds father actually came down to my house in his pickup truk. He screached onto my mom&#039;s lawn and did a handbrake turn! I thought this woz cool and ment he had forgiven me. But oh noh, he woz furious.<br />He had a crow bar and was yelling and angry. He smashed a garden gnome with his crow bar. He was shouting about wanting to hurt me real bad.<br />My dad came out with a baseball bat and told him to get off my property. Then my mom came out crying. After a bit of yelling and crying he left in his truk.<br />Now my mom and pop are even more mad at me.<br /><br />To top it all off I have to pay for that gnome out of my allowance (if I ever get an allowance eva again).<br />So my shit is fucked up real bad even when I did nothing wrong. Just bad place at wrong time. There is alot of hurtful people here who get a kick out of insulting my misfortune&nbsp; :(

				slip are you that blind to your own actions or are you just a marathon troller?<br /><br />you damaged your friends mind man.... a gram of mdma is without a doubt going to leave some damage and cocaine is known to damage as well.... <br />you literally took away from the quality of that mans life, if you really did this. so fucking ask yourself, was it worth it?<br />you made a guinea pig out of your friend and fried his brain. you are a fuck and if it was my child you did that to, i would either kill you or beat you to the point of being unrecognizable. im all about love and peace and understanding but dude you didnt think you should look into taking that amount of drugs before you gave it to someone? you didnt think you should inform him of the dangers of his drug use? you are the worst friend i can imagine. through my exploration of drugs my friends havent always been the most educated but they always had the right information to prevent harm regardless of how many drugs they wanted to sell to people.<br /><br />go away slip. dont kill yourself, dont show your face to that kids family, just forget this ever happened and move on with your life.

				Every time I read this post, I think I loose some of my brain cells. You&#039;re a naive child, and you shouldn&#039;t be messing with things you know little to nothing about. Also, if you still live with your parents, what the fuck are you doing using drugs like this. I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re under 18 if this is what&#039;s happened. You need to re-think what you&#039;re doing with your life. <br /><br />Sorry for the harshness, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;re ready for what you&#039;ve been doing.

				I understand him telling his mom, but going to the cops. I find it hard to believe you are providing the full story. Also, it wasn&#039;t smart posting publicly on the threads about it. Now denying that you had involvement with silk road will be hard for your lawer.<br /><br />If i have learned anything in life. Don&#039;t do drugs with people you don&#039;t know. Don&#039;t sell drugs to people you don&#039;t know. Don&#039;t give drugs to people you don&#039;t know. If you would of known this person better. You would of known that they had low or no tolerance and you would of adjusted the dosage accordingly. What angers me is that you&#039;re trying to blame him for your mistake. If you&#039;re going to use drugs and sell/give drugs to other people. You need to be responsible or you&#039;re going to suffer legal consequences. You&#039;re very luck that the person didn&#039;t die from an overdose because you wouldn&#039;t be writing your rant behind prison bars. <br /><br />If they had to pump his stomach, YOU gave him way too many drugs. Then, you&#039;re going to retaliate by attempting to poison him? You just dodged the bullet of involuntary manslaughter and you&#039;re already plotting homicide? I understand your anger towards your friend. But, did you help him in his time of need? Did he contact you when he suspected an overdose? <br /><br />I hate snitches and they piss me off, but so does ignorant people that put others at risk of being harmed. (Especially when someone is oblivious to their mistake that almost cost someone their life.)<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that you forced him to consume that much. But, when it comes to noobies. I feel it&#039;s a veteran drug user&#039;s duty to instruct them of the dangers, as well as proper dosing etc. After you have done that, i feel it&#039;s out of your hands if they are not with you with they consume. Someone obviously didn&#039;t know how much mdma to dose if they took a gram. (If it was in fact real mdma.) Sometimes the most dangerous thing to people are their lack of knowledge. <br /><br />I don&#039;t feel it was right that he tricked you into thinking they were dead. That sounds like some kid shit right there. I&#039;m assuming that you&#039;re a teenager and don&#039;t belong here on the road anyway. I&#039;m also assuming your friend was younger than you.<br /><br />I truly hope for you and that person&#039;s safety that this is just a troll. The trolls are mighty hungry recently.
