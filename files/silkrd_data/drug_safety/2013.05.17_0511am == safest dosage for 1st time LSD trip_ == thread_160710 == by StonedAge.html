				They say &quot;take two&quot;- that&#039;s about 100ug on the street, give or take. You&#039;ll remain grounded and have mild to intermediate visuals. It&#039;s a great time! If you&#039;ve done shrooms, you&#039;ll dig the standard acid dose no problem. I find it much easier to handle, and think the whole &quot;shrooms before acid&quot; suggestion perpetuates a misunderstanding of LSD simply because it&#039;s synthesized in a laboratory.

				&nbsp;:) starting with 2 tabs of ~100 ug is safe 3 would be optimal.. but its always wise to have someone watching out for you when your experimenting with drugs like lucy.. :P<br />use your best judgment and be safe! enjoy.

				Start with 100ug -- no more.<br /><br />Then on your next trip, you can try a higher dosage.<br /><br />Why start low? See here for answer:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158139.0

				I agree with the above: start with 100ug. <br />If you want to be &quot;immersed&quot; in the world of Alice you can try a 200ug first experience, but I would recommend doing that ONLY if you have a sitter/guide.

				100 micrograms should do the trick for the first timer. <br />Some say that if you take less than that, you might be having trouble of &quot;letting go&quot;. Don&#039;t try to hold back, just let the LSD take you where ever it wants to take you. Also, Set-and-setting is the key to a good experience. Get a close, good, sober friend to watch over you and possibly comfort you. Drop the LSD at day time and eat well before.

				Dont try to re-dose, after the initial dose. Its some what pointless. <br /><br />I suggest going in, your a big guy, id say no less than 3.

One of my best trips to date. <br /><br />&nbsp;I advise you go hard, or go home. Just keep good company, that you trust with your life preferably. No cell phones, no obligations.

				The papers are not properly dosed.<br /><br />The one can be twice as strong as the other.<br /><br />Often you see a print on the paper.<br />&nbsp;Like the sighn -Omegega- or the face of Bart Simson, but fruit as strawberry or something is common to. I have to say was, I see them less and less.<br /><br />They are very, very small, but still you have to cut one of those papers in 4 parts again.<br />It is hard to do, because of the size already small.<br /><br />You start with 1/4 of a paper, after&nbsp; 1/2 hour or so you take the second quarter.<br />If . after an hour the first quarter kicks in, you know that still 3/4 has still has to come.<br /><br />Seek someone confident and knows it is the lsd that gives the people animal-like faces.<br />Do not be afraid.<br />Seek reliable friends to sick it out.<br /><br />It happens 1 in a 100 times, so bad trips are rarity in low doses.<br /><br /><br /><br />A good combi described in erowid is s low dose of 2c-b with a normal portian mdma.
