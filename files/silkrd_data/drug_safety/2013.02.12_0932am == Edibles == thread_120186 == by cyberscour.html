				I have purchased some marijuana edibles recently, and although I have done extensive research on them, I still have some concerns.<br /><br />Will edibles keep my eyes red even after I fully come down to about baseline?<br />I&#039;ve heard that edibles can cause hallucinations like a low mushroom dose, or even slight dissociation, is this true, and should I expect this on a normal dose? <br /><br />Also anything else I should know about these (what to do, what to take caution of, etc)?

				Edibles are almost exactly the same as marijuana except that it takes longer to affect you and takes longer to go away.&nbsp; Edibles likely will cause less redness of the eyes since there is no smoke to agitate them, but I wouldn&#039;t rely on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />They don&#039;t cause hallucinations any more than normal weed.&nbsp; Except perhaps that people can get carried away and eat too much and just get incredibly high.

				I second that, especially that last part.&nbsp; There&#039;s a vendor on the Road, I think goes by Angelina, makes these lolipops with THC.&nbsp; They taste like butterscotch with an aroma of weed, but you feel nothing - nothing - so you have another.&nbsp; And, if you&#039;re doing it to get high, another.&nbsp; And, about an hour and a half into it, the high starts to kick in, and it hits you hard and it stays for a long damn time.&nbsp; You don&#039;t get any more high than if you&#039;d smoked a few joints, it&#039;s just about the time.&nbsp; It&#039;s great if you live in an apartment or somewhere smoking isn&#039;t practical.&nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about any train wreck experiences if you eat two, you&#039;ll just be feeling gooooood. <br />Also of note: eat on empty stomach for getting higher quicker.<br /><br />

				Well, guess I don&#039;t need this thread anymore, Angelina closed my order for no apparent reason after keeping me waiting 3 days and never responding to my 2 messages... Kind of a shitty buyer experience in my opinion...

				Do you have a good buying history?&nbsp; What was your message?&nbsp; The THC suckers are so cheap, you should probably just buy one or two, y&#039;know?&nbsp; On the other hand, I get that &quot;cheap&quot; isn&#039;t what it used to be, since BTC&#039;s are going for, like, $26 lately.
