				EZ!<br /><br />Thru the forum I&#039;ve been reading about MDA and also M1 just wondering about the effects of these chemicals? I&#039;m a seasoned MDMA user and can&#039;t imagine anything can equal the tried and tested. But seeing the pictures of MDA I can only speculate whether Ive been sold it on the street before?<br /><br />Whats the deal with MDA surely it cannot compare to MD?<br /><br />Love &#039;n&#039; Chaos<br /><br />J.K<br /><br />(Joe Kalius - It&#039;s a Joke Alias)

				From some brief research, MDA seems to be quite similar to MDMA but more psychedelic.<br />Haven&#039;t tried MDMA before, but it kinda makes me want to try MDA more...

				Seen, but I&#039;m very much the opposite. When MDMA is so available, cheap and pure I find it hard to understand why anyone would try MDA or M1.<br /><br />

				MDMA vs Methylone (or M1): Methylone is basically MDMA-light. This also means that it&#039;s after effects are less worse. Combined with the fact that it hits your serotonin less, makes it a lot better to handle for more frequent use.

				Isn&#039;t methylone just the &quot;bath salts&quot; that were all over the news a couple years ago. This is what has steered me away from it.&nbsp; The seller I got my mda from actually sells a mda/m1 combo but I am unsure to try it, would prefer mda/mdma.

				MDMA - Body roll much more present, euphoric, tactile, should be quite calm and will make you melt, less neurotoxic<br />MDA - More speedy, body roll less present, less intense euphoria/tactility, more psychedelic than MDMA, more neurotoxic, great to have sex on<br />Methylone - Like a toned down version of MDMA, light body roll, short duration but can be topped up over and over<br /><br />Perfect balance for me is 100mg MDA and 150mg MDMA in one go. It rocks your face off because you get the best of both worlds and is all I need for 1 night. In fact, I&#039;m going to buy some MDA now to go with the MDMA I already have lol...

They are sort of like two sisters, they have similarities as all sisters do but at the same time they have their own distinct personalities. One should try MDA to experience MDA and try MDMA to experience MDMA. As I said above I like them both at the same time because you get the best of both ends of the spectrum but before you do that I HIGHLY recommend enjoying them individually first. :)

Totally different substance.<br /><br />Methylone is very comparable to mdma. So not only does it have similar effects, but the damage it can do to your body will probably be similar to what mdma can do.

				In-fact, bath salts are MDPV!! - But probably contained a number of other Cathinones....

				I love MDA. Once tried a combination of an 8th of cubensis (shrooms) and +/-100mg of MDA. My god. It was fucking amazing. The body load was pretty intense, and I could have possibly thrown up for a good 3 hours of the trip, but with the caliber of visuals I was receiving, and the overall intense psychedelic experience, I wouldn&#039;t trade it for anything and would DEFINITELY do it again. Similar visual experience to 2 hits of good LSD, but obviously much different. I really want to try to mix LSD with MDA. Anyone had any experience with that?
