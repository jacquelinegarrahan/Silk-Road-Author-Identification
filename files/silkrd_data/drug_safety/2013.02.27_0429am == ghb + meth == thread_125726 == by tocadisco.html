				Thanks for pointing out :)<br /><br />GHB + coke is awesome too. <br /><br />Essentially all stimulants are mediated, smoothed out and made more euphoric when combined with GHB - it&#039;s a beautiful thing!<br /><br />BG

				i&#039;ve been using this combo all day - it feels fantastic... quit the meth about an hour ago - starting to feel sleepy (I&#039;m usually ambien-dependent, so this is awesome) I think I&#039;m about to have a little bit more ghb and then i feel like i&#039;ll get some&nbsp; nice sleep tonight. :)
