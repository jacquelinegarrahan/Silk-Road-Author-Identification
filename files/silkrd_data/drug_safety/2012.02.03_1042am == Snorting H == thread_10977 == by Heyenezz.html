				I&#039;ve never used heroin and have rarely used opiates. I was thinking of sniffing heroin or possibly smoking it. I only plan to use heroin once.<br /><br />Which of these two methods would you recommend? (I will never shoot anything)<br /><br />What quantity would you recommend for a first time user like me?<br /><br />What feelings, onset, side effects, after effects, etc. should I expect?<br /><br />Which vendors/product listings would you recommend?<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				I smoked it; I always prefer oral then smoking then snorting, and just am not willing to IV.<br /><br />It&#039;s not too difficult compared to other substances, you just have to be sure (as with any powder) that you go more slowly than if you have crystals. (ie, you can smoke the meth crystals faster than the heroin powder.)<br /><br />I measured out 10mg for my first time, and 20mg for my second time. I screwed up the first time, but I smoked it very well the second time. I honestly didn&#039;t enjoy it nearly as much as I would have expected. I suppose I&#039;m just not really an opiate-type person; the intoxication and lack of motor control disappointed me overall.<br /><br />I also got pretty screwed over for a couple of days when I smoked more than once in a row; wouldn&#039;t recommend it. Idk, just don&#039;t like it as much as I would have expected, and don&#039;t really expect to be using it that often at all.

Do you just use a regular glass pipe with a screen in it or is there a preferred method? I supposed I could just Google this, but if anyone can provide some tips or insight, I&#039;d appreciate it. I have experience with most opiates aside from H and the thought of &quot;chasing the dragon&quot; a few times intrigues me. I&#039;d been leaning towards just insufflating a miniscule amount of some of the raw available on SR, mostly because I want to be able to strictly control my dosage, but I&#039;d definitely be interested in smoking a bit, too. <br /><br />Actually, now I have a number of questions. For instance, would tar be preferable to powder for smoking? I assume powder is much better for snorting. I won&#039;t be injecting, given my extreme distaste for needles, but would you guys recommend one type over the other for my purposes? Does H (in either tar or powder form...) burn relatively slowly, like opium, or will it be more like a quick, single hit and then BAM, you&#039;re on the nod? If I&#039;m only aiming to do a very small amount at first, should I just put a pinhead-sized sprinkle on top of some weed and gradually increase my dose? Please, teach me your ways! <br /><br />

				I&#039;d like to see more replies on this thread as I&#039;ve some similar inquiries. I recently tried H for the first time and it disappointed me. But I, on the other hand, am pretty well opiate-versed, and H just came in miles below my pill experiences. I snorted it-- perhaps smoking would have been the better option?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if the batch I got was bunk though. I didn&#039;t nod so much as pass out. It did however have a brilliant synergy with adderall. :D

				Used to have an addiction problem with H for about 6 months. Stopped using ~11 months ago.<br /><br />Originally started insufflating it, which is good but not as potent as smoking. Snorting effects tend to last longer, but require slightly more powder than smoking to reach same effects.<br /><br />I am not sure how people over the world prefer to smoke H, but in our community freebasing it off of tin foil with a straw was popular and my method of choice. It can be tricky not to waste, especially first few times trying. Start with a little until you master the technique. Eventually it is easy and highly effective. Effects do not last as long but are more potent.<br /><br />For new users to substance starting out with insufflation, a matchead size bump is probably a good starting place. You have to really assess the quality to determine if you want/need to take more.

				Thanks for the response, Ungoliant. <br /><br />From what I understand, a matchhead sized bump of a lot of the H available on SR may be too much for beginners. Who knows, though? I usually try to start off ridiculously small with new substances, especially those that can kill you fairly easily. I figure it&#039;s easier to play it safe and maybe have a less-than-mind-blowing first experience rather than overestimate and end up having a horrible experience. You can always take more. Taking less...not so easy. <br /><br />My friends sometimes give me shit about my methodical approach to drugs. I&#039;d rather enjoy relatively responsibly than look like a badass or get absolute instant gratification (though those things are appealing, too). Apparently I&#039;m no fun. But hey, I&#039;m alive and I have very few drug horror stories about my personal experiences. <br /><br />Anyway, I know you were suggesting exercising caution. I can just see somebody with virtually ZERO opiate tolerance getting some serious raw and then way overdoing it despite trying to be conservative in their dosing. Again, though, I have no idea what a matchhead sized bump of the stuff available on here (like from wumg or tony) is equivalent to...does anybody have a guess? I can look at conversion charts all day, but it might be nice to hear anecdotally that a matchhead sized amount feels like taking __mgs of oxy or whatever. <br /><br />TL;DR:&nbsp; I saw some novice H users in the forums say a matchhead sized bump was too much for their first time. Depends on the person, I&#039;m sure.

				I suppose you&#039;d be right. I was going off of earlier users post about match head and tended to agree. At the point of my transition to H I had already been using pharmaceutical opiates/had a tolerance. Quality does matter. Starting off smaller is not a bad thing, if you feel nothing after ~5 minutes you can always do the same small quantity again until you find what is right for you. Eventually if you keep using a tolerance will obviously build up.<br /><br />Also, I am in no way familiar with black tar. All H coming in our area has always been whitish/tan rocks AKA powdered H and not black tar. Unfamiliar with quantity/quality if you are getting the prior.

				alright, so I used to be a regular H user - not so much anymore thanks to SR and the high quality dope and waiting period (which is a great thing) but I always bump (snort) my H. now until recently, I would always bump around two bags (.1 each) for a good high. but this was with street dirt. so I would usually have to do one or two more two or three hours later. now, with this awesome selection of high quality dope here on SR, only a very small pinhead sized amount gets me going. and that&#039;s fucking great because the bag last longer, with a much better and longer high. <br /><br />but for me, bumping is the way to go for two reasons: 1. I have a very pussy like phobia with needles. I&#039;m an adult and even doctor related needle shots freak me out&nbsp; :-\ :-\ and 2. it&#039;s the ritual. the routine of it all. and for many, the routine is shooting. but for me, I absolutely love the process of bumping. the act of actually using a razor blade to move it around; the act of rolling up a bill to the perfect size; and the thrill of it when you wedge that perfect rolled bill into the crevice of your nose and let out a strong breath of air preparing yourself for the snort. ahhh, it&#039;s fucking great. then there is the drip. frankly, my favorite part. now, I&#039;ve heard from many people that with H, you actually get a larger bio when there is no drip, since when it rolls down to your stomach, it wastes some of it. but for me, I can&#039;t help it. that sweet and sour taste in the back of your throat when you know in a matter of minutes everything in the world will be okay again. there isn&#039;t anything else in the world that is nearly as satisfying. <br /><br />shit. I cant wait for my H to come now. haha fuck. waiting sucks.

				I would not recommend putting H into any spliffs. at all. when you smoke H, you don&#039;t actually put a flame to the powder. it would just burn up and waste ALL OF IT. that&#039;s why people chase the dragon off of tin foil. trust me, they wouldn&#039;t do that if there were an easier way or if you could just sprinkle it onto a blunt. if you were to put it in a spliff, the cherry would absolutely destroy the heroin and it would just be a complete waste. putting coke on a spliff is one thing because it burns at a much higher temp. not heroin. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend that brother if you are thinking about smoking H. use tin foil and a toilet paper roll for the greatest effect when you are first starting out. then once you get the hang of it, move down a level to a straw.
