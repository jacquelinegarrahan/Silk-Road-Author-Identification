				Hi Guys,<br /><br />I really want to buy from SR but with the BTC conversion and shipping delays it wont make it for this weekend :(<br />But I will defiantly buy my future order from SR vendors.<br /><br />But on to the point at hand, my contact gets cocaine from dealers and then sells it to me as the dealers don&#039;t want to deal direct were I live. I only buy bullets of cocaine and twice the guy has given me bullets from other dealers and not the guy I wanted from. And as such it was 100% not cocaine, the first one he took back and exchanged and the second one he told me basically I did not know what I was talking about &quot;asshole&quot;. So about a week back when I&#039;m out clubbing he sees me and says his contact told him to tell his friends that he as some really good bolivian cocaine coming in this weekend. I&#039;m paying 900 euros for about 10g which I think is very expensive.<br /><br />So the last time a bought a bullet not from him but someone else for 600 euros I put a line on a spoon and add water and tried to dissolve it and allot of white stuff was floating on the top and even after heating it, it still would not dissolve so I think that means that cocaine was quite badly cut with crap.<br /><br />I have bought some eztest (eztest.com) for cocaine purity and cocaine cuts but that has not arrived yet, so I was wondering before I buy the complete bullet and get ripped again I want to do some kind of street test. <br />Test options??<br />1) Maybe I take some water in a vial and take a test portion of either a gram I buy or some of the bullet and add it the water and see how it dissolves<br />2) I read on the forums that someone test a vendors stuff and siad it was good as it was oily after he rubbed it between his fingers. Is that a test I can do as well?<br /><br />Please if you guys can help out or list me url / link on these forums that I can find out how to do some basic test before I was good money on crap and get caught again.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.
