				Aside from the obvious response, breathe in through your nose, how do you go about snorting coke?&nbsp; For me it seems to be 100mg initial dose, then 50mg boosters roughly every 45 minutes about 5 times over the course of the night, 3-4 hours.&nbsp; Does this sound reasonable or is this excessively high?&nbsp;

				Nah doesn&#039;t seem excessive at all, personally approx 200mg doses 5 times over the night if I grab a gram. Once an hour or so. Break it up into a really fine powder, use a box cutter blade or something, more surface area to absorb and its much easier on your nasal cavity.. been using on and off for close to 5 years and no nosebleeds yet.<br />If Im doing it out at the club I usually keep in a cigarillo tube and put out some bumps off my phone in a low key spot, careful though bouncers will often open them if you&#039;re getting searched on entry.<br />Personally I&#039;m not a fan of mixing it with other things except liquor, and a joint to take the edge off when its done.

				i like to snort about .5g in about 3 lines to start just to get a nice fat initial rush, than do .2 every 30 mins or so for a couple hours. i have kind of a high tollerance though.

				<br />Interesting topic.&nbsp; I actually bought a scale to measure my doses and intake over the course of a night.&nbsp; Pre-measure into a bullet if I&#039;m out.&nbsp; Also keep track of exactly how much is left.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anybody else do this?&nbsp; I might be anal or just enjoy &quot;the process&quot;.

				Sorry to butt in on your thread, but I have a few questions too if it&#039;s okay..<br /><br />I was wondering a few things:<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard when snorting cocaine, it causes a numbing feeling. Is it entirely numbing or does it hurt too?<br /><br />Is the initial buzz typically a happy feeling? I know it varies depending on how good the product is, but if it&#039;s good coke, do you feel really anxious and worried like you&#039;re late for something (might be a weird analogy), or is it more like warm, happy energy?<br /><br />I understand if it&#039;s too hard to explain. I&#039;ve not tried cocaine yet and the many listings seem so tempting.

				First, everyone is different, will respond differently and even the environment will influence your experience... I know, &quot;no shit sherlock&quot; but I just somehow feel obligated to say it. Other disclaimer: it will also depend on what your coke is cut with (I think its safe to say that we all assume it&#039;ll be cut with something, its just a question of what).<br /><br />So, with all of that out of the way, normally it only numbs or at worst might feel like you inhaled something dusty for a moment. Even the one batch I had that stung, only did so very briefly and didn&#039;t stop me from doing it all eventually.<br /><br />The initial buzz for me takes about 3 minutes to really start and usually hits its stride at about 15 minutes. It&#039;s energetically happy. It&#039;s talkative and you talk to people because you think its something they&#039;ll want to hear or be entertained by. <br /><br />It&#039;s like getting out of a warm bath on Christmas morning.<br /><br />I generally don&#039;t get paranoid. I may tend to get anxious during the worst of the comedown, but I know why I&#039;m feeling it so that helps to not believe it. Usually I time things so that I&#039;m asleep when it might happen.<br />

				One more thing.&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably get into &quot;the process&quot; of preparing your stash for snorting.&nbsp; If you have a scale, you might measure out how much you want.&nbsp; Then, drawing out the lines to the thickness and length you like, chopping them as fine as possible (better for your sinuses too), and finally using the snorting device of your choice. :-X<br /><br />My chatty ass is really finished. :-X

				chop it up, into something you think you can handle. Someting small at first works good, snort it up. and dont forget to share.<br /><br />Its better if everyone around you is bent. <br /><br />rail it up and regret it all later. Enjoy. Dont get addicted tho. Thats a bad side effect. and when you feel your heart racing and your sweating give it a break for a while ok and dont hurt yourself.

				It all depends on the quality of the product.<br /><br />Start with tiny lines and feel the effect.<br /><br />I assure you you&#039;ll be bumping up pretty often.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Snorting coke is very good, but addictive.<br /><br />Be careful.

				From a different thread, BigFlake had some great advice that I think belongs here as well (I removed some text for brevity):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5210.msg44141#msg44141">Quote from: BigFlake on November 09, 2011, 06:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...I generally keep my consumption around .5g over an evening.&nbsp; I measure it out before I start, then put the stash away.<br /><br />As far as your lines, draw &#039;em any way you like &#039;em.&nbsp; Thicker, longer lines puts more powder up your nose all at once possibly meaning more waste and sinus irritation.&nbsp; If you get like me, and enjoy the process of measuring, chopping, then drawing the lines (all the &quot;prep&quot; work), you&#039;ll probably do more, smaller or thinner lines.&nbsp; Mine tend to be on the order of 20-25mg so over the course of 6 hours, I would do 20-25 lines vs. 3-4 @ 1.5g or whatever.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know that I&#039;ve been going to longer, thinner lines that I vary the strength of my inhale on. I go from gentle to intense on the same line. However, I hadn&#039;t thought to take the bumps to this extreme. It makes sense and I see how it could actually reduce the amount done in an evening without lessening the effects. Plus, anything that might be easier on my sinuses already has my attention.<br /><br />BF, thanks for the suggestion!

				Thanks Torn for the props.&nbsp; I guess regular coke users develop some seemingly strange habits.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a friend who used to &quot;stretch&quot; his supply by cutting it with mannitol...yes, he cut his own already cut coke.&nbsp; I think he&#039;d throw .5g mannitol into an 8 ball.&nbsp; Not sure that made a huge difference, but it made him feel better and it was his way to reduce intake.&nbsp; Those were leaner days for him.&nbsp; Now, he does an 8 on the weekend mostly himself (unless I drop in) and he doesn&#039;t think twice about it.<br /><br />Now I haven&#039;t done this in awhile:&nbsp; got involved in some computer crap, kept doing lines, and here it is 6 a.m.&nbsp; Time for bed, or a nap.<br />Hope this thread keeps going.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good one.<br /><br />Good night/morning everyone.<br /><br />BF
