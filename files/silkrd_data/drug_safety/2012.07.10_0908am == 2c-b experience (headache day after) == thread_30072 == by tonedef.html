				2c-b, very nice drug it seems!<br />the experience was just fine and enjoyable: some euphoria and nice visuals, yep i liked it.<br /><br />there is just one thing that bothers me, i had it 2 times:<br />first time one capsule (18-20 mg) had an annoying&nbsp; headache in the morning after<br />second time 2 capsules (18-20 mg) had a very nasty headache when waking up in the morning which lasted for hours, did not get out of bed til much later in the day.<br /><br />Is this common on 2c-b? could it be there are different types of quality 2c-b? maybe the 2c-b i had wasnt so good?<br />or maybe it is just my body chemistry that i react to it that way...<br /><br />any experiences?

				The headaches could be something to do with Serotonin syndrome. I have no idea though because I&#039;m no expert on it.. Have a look around on Google about it though. <br />Or it could just be lack of hydration when you&#039;re on the 2c-b?

				isn&#039;t serotine syndrome when you have have fucked up your serotonin receptors from taking too much, too frequently e.g. MDMA?<br />i doubt that is the case, when it take xtc pill/mdma i&#039;m just fine the day after. Dehydration is unlikely...i drink all the time<br /><br />Also i hardly ever have headaches, but now twice after 2C-B <br /><br />I guess i will just have to try and see if it happens again, although it&#039;s not so tempting after these two times.

If you snorted them, I might chalk your experience up to lingering sinus pain.<br /><br />Did you make sure you were well-hydrated and adequately fed on both occasions? I often find psychedelic experiences can get me so distracted I forget to drink or eat and wind up feeling shitty until I put something on my stomach.&nbsp; <br /><br />Barring either of those, it is difficult to say.&nbsp; I know that Mahakala has clean 2c-b available and there are a few other well-regarded 2c-b vendors on here as well.&nbsp; If you dosed a third time with a known amount of clean 2c-b and woke up again with a headache I&#039;d say it could be an idiosyncratic reaction your body has to 2c-b and you probably should avoid it going forward.<br /><br />Have you tried other 2c-x&#039;s? If so, what kind of reaction did you have?

				I sometimes get a minor headache after the come down of 2C-B.&nbsp; Ibuprofin takes it away easily.&nbsp; Yours sound a lot worse.&nbsp; You should probably avoid 2C-B, unfortunately.&nbsp; I seriously doubt it&#039;s due to an impurity, but it&#039;s not out of the question.

				Yes both times orally one time 1 cap swallowed the other time the content of two caps put into a drink<br />Was well fed and hydrated and keep drinking all the time (like i usually do and i drink all the time)<br /><br />the second time was a big dose i guess: close to 40 mg maybe a little much but the experience itself was fine (like i could have taken much more)<br />This was my first of the 2c-x&#039;s...<br /><br />I guess i will try another vendor&#039;s 2c-b i am getting curious now if it was the 2c-b or if it is just me after all!

				Maybe try 2C-C and 2C-I and see if you don&#039;t get a headache with those.
