				Jenkem? How much do you think it would go for? Ive got a couple of bottles of 1994 vintage jenkem im letting age in my basement. 1994 was a good year for jenkem.<br /><br />Im pretty sure krokidil is just poor mans H. They make it in piss poor third world countrys where if you go on vacation and go out to dance clubs you can fuck hot chicks, but its all a set up and then you end up in a weird old factory where people come and pay money to kill you. <br /><br />Its an injectable form of opium that hasnt been refined with the proper chemicals and as you stated can cause all types of permanent damage if its injected from infections and other issues. <br /><br />Id try it, lol.

				As already said, pure Desomorphine has the same (low) toxicity like the rest of the Opioid-Family, the problem with Krokodil lies in the crude Synthesis via Iodine, Phosphor+Codeine.<br /><br />The chances that it will show up on SR are pretty small imho,<br />as the reason for itÂ´s consumption in Russia is a combination of the high prices for Heroin in RU, a lack of alternatives and the wide availability of precursor chems.

				The whole point of Krokodil is that it is very cheap and easy to make. That&#039;s why it wont ever be sold here because it simply isn&#039;t economically worth it, you can purchase the ingredients cheaper than the shipping cost. <br /><br />The ingredients are particularly easy to get hold of from chemists in Russia and eastern Europe, which is why it&#039;s such a huge issue there. That tied with the fact that shipping to Russia is a nightmare means Krokodil has taken off there big time. The Russian government either needs to ban the ingredients (which they won&#039;t do as they&#039;re in cheap common painkillers), or open up the borders a bit and allow safer, cleaner hard drugs such as Heroin though a little more (I thought I&#039;d never be saying that in my whole life!). <br /><br />It&#039;s a whole world of irony really. Prohibition is literally killing people quicker than the alternative.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28318.msg311592#msg311592">Quote from: overman on June 27, 2012, 05:46 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I heard there&#039;s another scary drug out there called &quot;tobacco&quot; which kills 6 million people a year.

Krokodil omits any of those steps though, it simply is the result of reacting codeine to desmorphine leaving all the reagents (spent or not) in the mixture and then injecting it. <br /><br />I imagine this goes like people getting codeine tablets and adding a dash of X, then Y, and simply injecting whatever remains after that. The nasty graphic results you see online are not caused by desmorphine at all, but they are simply the result of injecting the crud that remains after the synthesis reaction. Even if the end product contained no desmorphine at all, results would be equally bad if people kept injecting it - though i don&#039;t suppose they would since there would be nothing addictive.<br /><br />Krokodil is really a drug used in poverty, not unlike sniffing glue and such. Far safer substances that give the same effect are on the market, just at a higher price.<br /><br />The active substance, desmorphine, isn&#039;t particularly dangerous compared to other potent opiates. While it is about 10 times more potent than morphine, if taken at equally effective doses it is no more dangerous. <br />

The Russian government could ease this by relaxing restrictions on imports of softer drugs such as weed, mushrooms and MDMA which would negatively affect people physically a lot less than home made krokodil.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah but to be honest, when it comes to shit like this I just call it natural selection. That may be a bit controversial for some and sound harsh but it is just how I see things. Life weather you like it or not is survival of the fittest rather than survival of the shittest. The shittest can mean anything from being a bastard and having karma bite you in the ass or it can mean making the decision to use a drug like Krokodil. <br /><br />And yeah but that is the case of all governments, if they allowed it then there wouldn&#039;t be half as many issues but that just ain&#039;t gunna happen.

I&#039;ve never touched the stuff, came as close to an invalid credit card payment from getting it. I had no scales, I needed some sort of benzo at the time. If I didn&#039;t discover AirMailChemist I would have bought the stuff and undoubtedly overdosed and done something spectacularly insane. Phenazepam is showing up around here in legal headshop products. It&#039;s really bad shit. I&#039;ve read countless horror stories. I feel humbled having come so close to experiencing it.

If that isn&#039;t enough to put someone off taking Phenpam then you need to punch them in the back of the head shouting FUCK PHENPAM over and over. If that isn&#039;t enough just break their hands and feet so they can&#039;t get to the Phenpam and shout FUCK PHENPAM while you do it.<br /><br />FUCK PHENPAM. IMO that stuff is easily up their with Meth/Smack/Crack/PCP on the &quot;Dangerous drugs I will not even consider trying&quot; list. In a lot of ways I would say it&#039;s even worse. <br /><br />The Soviets invented Methcathinone as well yano and that shit is rougher than a sandpaper anal bead too.

				I have seen a few documentaries on this drug.<br /><br />Its like meth in that anyone can read the recipe and be a one trick chemist.<br /><br />Unlike meth it does tend to actually be VERY destructive and users injecting this will almost certainly not be having a 50th birthday party.<br /><br />A horrible drug.<br /><br />And if they are using codeine to make it, it would be wiser to just use codeine which is benign on the body. <br /><br />I would ban this drug - more out of concern for people who must surely have issues if they are prepared to use this shit.<br /><br />Heroin, I can let that go.

				Well, if they ever do legalize recreational drugs, krokodil would be a prime example of something to ban afterwards because of its dangerous and inactive components. If they politicians ever get their heads around it, we should make use of of the FDA to take contaminated batches of desmorphine off the market. <br /><br />Reality probably is that some DEA spokespuppet will state that krokodil is equally dangerous to cannabis, -because- both are illegal, and all illegal drugs cause limitless harm to both the user and society as a whole.

				There might be clinics in the UK, i wouldn&#039;t know.<br /><br />I suppose the regiment is to slowly but steadily taper off doses though. Cold turkey cessation could certainly result in a fit, but tapering off use is far less risky, and would in most cases not require hospitalization at all.
