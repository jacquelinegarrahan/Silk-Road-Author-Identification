				I&#039;m not cooking. A friend of mine got some bad meth and assumed that there was left over freeon in the product. I personally feel that he was just dope sick, because his symptoms didn&#039;t progress to deadly manners. Vitals are good. (Pulse, bp, and respirations.) No coughing up blood or blood found in stool. <br /><br />This brings me to the question. Is it possible for left over freeon to be left in meth?&nbsp; What about refriges. Can they leak?

				Freon...&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty volatile.&nbsp; It Vaporizes/evaporates really quick, so I&#039;m not sure how much residue would be left behind if even used by the cook... probably not a significant amount whatsoever.&nbsp; It depends on which Freon we&#039;re talking about as well.<br /><br />Like they used to use Freon in cigarette production I guess: (people weren&#039;t keeling over)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Freon<br /><br />Tobacco used in cigarettes may be &quot;puffed&quot; or expanded by a variety of processes. Expansion decreases the mass per unit weight, which is one way to reduce &quot;tar&quot; delivery and total tobacco content of a cigarette. In the 1970s R. J. Reynolds developed a process called G-13, which used Freon-11 for expanding tobacco (11, 12). The process was used by RJR, Liggett &amp; Myers, American Tobacco, and Lorillard. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft8489p25j&amp;chunk.id=d0e7723&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress<br /><br />Yes, your refrigerant can leak out of AC units/Refrigerators, but not to the&nbsp; concentration in air needed to poison you.&nbsp; There&#039;s not that much coolant in the system, plus as it leaks out it&#039;d be absorbed into the walls etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;d notice this though since your fridge wouldn&#039;t get cold anymore.<br />http://www.ehow.com/info_12168386_much-freon-central-air-system-lose-over-time.html<br /><br />Impurity wise... meth can have a whole slew of impurities left in it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Without lab analysis, one can only guess to what they are in that batch.&nbsp; (especially if you don&#039;t know the synthesis route)&nbsp; But it is plausible that your friend is reacting to something in it, yet I highly doubt it&#039;s Freon though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hopefully you&#039;re correct in your original assessment of him just being dope sick.&nbsp; &nbsp;If these symptoms come back (and it&#039;s not just sick), I&#039;d definitely seek professional help.
