				hash can be pretty psychedelic, but lsd is far more so. if you&#039;re scared of the effects, i&#039;d recommend just taking one tab your first time. that should be a very mellow trip. read up on psychedelics and learn as much as you can. there is nothing to be afraid of. psychedelics are powerful tools. treat them with respect and don&#039;t resist if things get bad (that will make them worse).

				if it is truly 150ug then you will definitely be acting odd. i would suggest taking it alone or with one or two really close friends that are either tripping with you or that have tripped before and are baby sitting you. at that dosage you can expect mild visuals, a pretty intense head trip (especially if this is your first psychedelic), time dilation, a moderate intensifying of everything you experience (e.g. music is more intense, watching a movie, even thinking). the most prominent effects will be the mental aspect. in regards to comparing to hash, if i had to give a quantitative estimate off the top of my head, you&#039;ll probably be like 3-5 times &quot;more high&quot;, but the two can&#039;t exactly be compared like this. the first time i tried LSD i had supposed 150ug blotters (were probably in the range of 110-150ug) and had a blast, due to the novelty of the experience. it&#039;ll be like nothing you&#039;ve experienced before. i notice with other drugs like opiates, stimulants, benzos, etc., a good writer can describe the effects pretty reliably. however, the mental &quot;trip&quot; of the psychedelic experience is near impossible to convey without actually experiencing it (the visuals are pretty much just icing on the cake).

				No, you&#039;re worrying way too much, just don&#039;t leave any room for accidents.<br /><br />Make sure everything dangerous is put away, make sure your house is clean so you don&#039;t kick anything and fall on your head.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve prepared your environment and you feel 100% safe, you should feel really excited that you&#039;ll be taking your first trip (When you have the blotter under your tongue for the first time ever and you&#039;re waiting for it to kick in, it feels like you&#039;re waiting on a $1 million check in the mail).

				The first thing to know is that throughout the experience you are still yourself. Depending on dose, you might see patterns emerging and walls shifting, bursts of colour and objects warping. You will also think and feel different. It&#039;s very fun.

You still have self-control and can coordinate your body just as easily. Just stay far away from traffic and you should be fine. (for me at least, the movement of cars can be very confusing on LSD. I tend to be unsure how far cars are away from me, etc)<br /><br />the reason that you may not appear &#039;normal&#039; is that your pupils will dilate, and you may have difficulty talking articulately or making sense of what people are saying.&nbsp; my posture also changes because of the tension in my back that LSD always produces, i don&#039;t know if this happens to everyone though.

Make sure you&#039;ve taken the time to get everything done that you needed to do before hand. Your productivity may be hindered slightly and every task may end up being quite a quest (which is actually fun sometimes if you creatively employ it as such) -- I lock the doors, turn off my phone and create a good time where I can be uninterrupted during the trip. If you do end up having to be in public then just be a crazy fuck ass, it will be a much better time than trying to hide it. I don&#039;t say this like go out of your way be socially weird, but if something is funny then laugh your fucking ass off if you want too and then make a hasty exit.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m really envious of your first time experience&nbsp; :) -- My perspective of the world completely changed for the better in terms of meaning, relativity and mystery after my first psychedelic experience. If you enjoy alcohol too - I&#039;d recommend getting a bucket of ice and a high dollar six pack of cold, rich and flavorful beers. Take each and every drink with full appreciation of sensory input. The coldness of your hand holding the bottle, the pressure on your bottom lip, the flow of the beer waving across your taste buds, the coldness passing through your body and feel that buzz. <br /><br />TL;DR<br />Keep blotter in mouth until starts kicking in, then eat it or toss it (I eat)<br />Get music playlist ready (not optional) -- Music and math are the answers to the universe.<br />Get movie playlist ready (optional)<br />Make sure you&#039;ve got a good whole day where you can be just lost<br />Let at least 1 other person know what you are doing

				its usually best to have a friend with you for the first time using psychedelics, just in-case anything happens, very unlikely but..<br /><br />likely, you&#039;ll be convinced that everyone can tell your tripping, but in reality you&#039;ll barely be off, they may tell somethings off but think tired, groggy, or just off. but really a lot of the times dealing with sober people while your tripping can be a total headfuck and quite annoying, usually the last thing a guy with a head-full of acid wants

				110µg should be perfect for the first time.<br /><br />Take a good friend with you. She/he can trip with you or just chill with you. So if you loose the connection to reality this person can calm you down. If you are alone make sure someone knows about it and you can go there or call this person if you need it. <br />A 10mg diazepam is handy, too. 2.5 - 5mg will soften the trip and for me 10mg is enough to stop a 150µg trip and &quot;sail it out&quot;.<br /><br />But all in all. If you want take a trip just take it. It is not THAT big deal. And have fun!

				In regards to being &quot;normal&quot; it depends, I remember a few years back a mate of mine took one tab of LSD(not sure of the potency) and got pretty retarded. He was completely disinterested in conversation (understandably so) but also rather incapable of it. <br /><br />At one point a caterpillar managed to climb onto his hand and he thought it was a dragon that then transformed into a broccoli, then to a tree and then vanished. I was sober and watching his face trying not to laugh at his look of pure awe and amazement at this caterpillar and laughed quite hard when it &quot;vanished&quot; (he just dropped it) <br /><br />So in that respect people might think you were acting a bit strange depending on your tolerance/dose but if you are in a safe environment with a good sober sitter(or by yourself if you&#039;re of good metal state and health) you should have a blast.<br /><br />Drop a tab and enjoy&nbsp; ;D

				yeah i chilled with a friend that was his first time taking acid and it was pretty fun and i was basically sober that night. he had also taken lots of molly with the acid but it looked like he had a blast for the most part. not sure if him taken molly and acid together had something to do with it but he was literally humping everything for about 8 hours non stop lol. i know it sounds ridiculous but i watched it all night and i know he wasnt faking it or anything stupid. He also had alot of moments like thguardstgeorge mentioned. He would start spacing out on shit and get this stupid look on his face like he was in awe of what he was feeling/seeing. not too mention the 8 hour orgasm he had aswell looked pretty amazing. Iv seen him on just molly(MDMA) and its nothing like what i saw that night. HE WAS FRYING BALLZZZZZ!! I think the molly just made way more intense lol. So yeah the acid looked fun but i think way more fun is candy flippin looked FUCKIN CRAZY! lol have fun..........

				The first time SWIM dropped 150mics and it was a pretty fun experience, but SWIM felt as if he were on a border of extreme introspection and knowledge, which he was just hopelessly grasping to reach the entire trip. I would say 200-250mics (may not be the best for a first timer), but will be SWIMs optimal dose.

				Oh my god!<br />Yesterday I smoked more hashish than before and my heart started pumping nearly 200 ppm for 3 hours I felt it would stopped and I would die, I also listened to fake voices from the radio that told me good advices on my actual situation but like a sing.... it was a good experience but i&#039;m scared for my heart, how will it be with 110 mics of LSD?

				thizzlemonster&#039;s candy flipping story sounds pretty funny. humping things for 8 hours has got to be up there with the Guinness world record :P <br />I&#039;ve always wanted to go candy flipping but it always seems I only have one of the two magical substances at any one time, though this has made me more keen to try it.<br />As for scientifico&#039;s heart thing, that sounds intense, I&#039;ve had elevated heart rate on shrooms and Lsd but nothing like 200bpm, just a slight raise in heart rate, so I wouldn&#039;t think you would have to worry about it too much. Just be cautious as always with any drug.

				I can&#039;t give you any science to back up why it happens but it does seem to be quite a common occurrence when getting really high and since you were smoking hash which is generally stronger than bud I would assume the high THC and whatever else content caused the raise in heart rate. So I would think its nothing to worry about but if you are concerned talking to a doctor may be worth it even if it does nothing but put your mind at ease.
