				I am subject to mandated random drug testing. I am 99% certain that this will be a urine test. I just can&#039;t afford to risk testing positive at the moment. I am just wondering how sensitive hair tests are in the off chance I get asked for that. Currently I&#039;m clean and have been so for almost a year. My drug of choice would be mdma. I am confident I could be clean for urine test but I don&#039;t think I could do anything for a hair test other than to abstain from using. From what I understand hair tests are more sensitive/accurate. I would think that since the hair test is looking at 90 days, to reach the threshold to test positive you would need to have repeatedly used in that time period. This is pure speculation however. Even if I could only consume mdma once every 90 days it would be better than abstaining completely. <br /><br />I&#039;ll probably just not use mdma(or any of their big 5) while I still have this limitation at work, but if anyone has more knowledge I&#039;d love to hear it. I am pretty sure all I can really use safely is LSD and DMT as they are not tested for.<br /><br />
