				So, the bees are fun, but a good dose past threshold usually ends up making me nauseous, or makes my stomach or GI tract rumble. Not gas or anything else worse, just this weird unpleasant feeling that distracts from the other more pleasant effects. I&#039;ve tried drinking Pepto and I think I gave Immodium a try, but it&#039;s quite distracting to have this sort of effect going on when I&#039;m trying to enjoy the experience otherwise. <br /><br />Anyone else have this happen, and/or have any suggestions on suppressing this side-effect?

				I have had this unpleasant feeling in my stomach once when I combined MDMA with Coca Cola. Now I&#039;ll only drink water when rolling, also it feels much better to drink water when rolling. Never had that problem again.<br />Fuck Coca Cola.<br /><br />Maybe something like hydrotalcide or another acid binding substance will help.<br /><br />Or maybe you should eat a little bit of food that does not have acids or fat&#039;s so it&#039;s not going to make your stomach very active. Just a bite or too, not a whole meal.

				Some stomach discomfort is common with 2C-B and the other 2C-X.<br />What dose are we talking about btw?<br />What did you eat? When did you take the 2c-b?<br />For me a &quot;good dose past threshold&quot; does not cause stomach discomfort (maybe because I just dont think of it...donno :) )<br />you could try taking it in the morning on an empty stomach and later eat a little, that would work for me I think...<br />Everyone is different but that should maybe help with the rumble...

				The dose was about average, 20-25mg raw powder, either parachuted or placed in a gelcap before ingestion.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken it in the evening, usually on an empty stomach (a few hours after eating, and only keeping hydrated; the mention of nausea or GI distress made me wary of getting sick). Sometimes there&#039;ve been no effects, other times I&#039;ve felt like my intestines were rumbling and writhing slowly (like the smooth muscle of the lower GI going into overdrive now and then).<br /><br />It&#039;s also varied from vendor to vendor; one seller had some stuff that promoted fun empathics and some mild visual, and had almost no stomach issues. The other vendor&#039;s product, at the same dose, was WAY more colorful and kaleidoscopic, a little less empathic, but was much more likely to make my stomach ache, etc.

				Ginger Root works wonders for me.<br /><br />I have 500mg ginger root caps, I&#039;ll take 4 of them before I do any psychedelics.
