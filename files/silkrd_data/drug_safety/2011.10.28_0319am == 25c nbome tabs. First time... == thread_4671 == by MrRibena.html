				What would you suggest? Slip it onto the tongue? For how long?<br /><br />Never done a psychedelic before and this will be my first try. They are on blotted paper. Some tips and advice would be great!

				Fair enough, cheers! I decided on 25c nbome because research told me it wasnt as big a hit as LSD. what do you think about that? I didnt want to go into it blazing but will do LSD eventually. what do you make of the differences between nbome and the 2c drugs?

				First piece of advice.... don&#039;t listen to BlackOps&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Firstly, he&#039;s experienced in psychedelics, you are not, he can handle higher doses, you may not be able to.<br />Secondly, he&#039;s given you advice on how many to take without even asking what the dosage on your blotters are, are they 375ug, 800ug, etc - it will make a huge difference.<br /><br />He is spot on about the ingestion method however, so he&#039;s not all bad&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Brushing your teeth and gums with toothpaste beforehand will aid absorption as well. It&#039;s fine to swallow the blotter after leaving in your lower lip for the half to one hour (I leave it for 1).&nbsp; It&#039;s not dangerous to swallow it at all it&#039;s just that NBOMe is orally inactive so if you swallowed it as an ingestion method like you can for an LSD blotter it wouldn&#039;t work, that&#039;s all.<br /><br />I had a single 800ug 25c-NBOMe blotter the other night and it was a very strong trip. As an experienced psychedelic user I could handle it fine, but I do remember thinking at the time that I wouldn&#039;t want it to have been my first time ever having a psychedelic.<br /><br />I did find it very easy to control the trip though, easier than LSD, so if you do start having overly negative or scary thoughts at any time&nbsp; just think of things/people/events that make you happy and you can get back on track very easily.<br /><br />Have fun! It is a really nice drug, I wouldn&#039;t want a bad first experience to turn you off it.&nbsp; <br />

On LSD i tend to get fractal type visuals but on 25c the visuals were more &#039;artistic&#039;. Very colorful and fluid. At one stage everything looked like it had been painted by brush like in an oil painting.&nbsp; At other times it was more cartoony. I remember thinking I was working my way through all the photoshop filters with all the different effects I was getting.<br />

				I bought from aus2aus http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/42388<br /><br />He&#039;s out of stock of the blotters at the moment though, only has the HCI salt that you dissolve in water, which would be dangerous in your hands haha.&nbsp; He ships the blotters international but the HCI only domestic Australia.<br /><br />I highly recommend this vendor, I&#039;ve ordered from him several times.&nbsp; He has the best prices too, it was less than $5 a blotter. This may have been an introductory price though so they may go up when he restocks. Worth keeping an eye out for though.<br /><br /><br />

				I bought 25 25c-NBOMe tabs from ENBOOM and took them with my roommate on Tuesday. He started with 3 grams of shrooms and 1 tab of lsd and I started with 2 lsd tabs and 2 boom tabs. Throughout the night we kept taking more boom tabs and now there is 6 left. We took 19 between the both of us but I am not sure who took how many. The visuals were extremely intense and it lasted about 16 hours + the next two days we both did not feel sober and had some lingering effects. The 25c-NBOMe tabs were 500 micrograms each and we kept them between the gums and lip for about 45 minutes then chewed them for the next 15 minutes and swallowed them.<br /><br />We probably shouldn&#039;t have taken that many since theirs not much research done but we&#039;re both fine.

Don&#039;t get into a pissing contest with anyone who has 5 tabs, because 25c has a definitive &#039;ceiling&#039;, after which the trip&#039;s positive effects diminish and some unwanted physiological effects come up (heat, sweat, cramps)... when you&#039;re tolerance is zero, eg you had zero trips of any kind in the last week, then the max 25c for me is like 1200ug.. Keep it under 1200ug and you will have an excellent experience.<br /><br />As for comparison with LSD... 2x 500ug tabs has a more pronounced visual effect than a single 150ug LSD (for me anyways), and at these low doses I find the 25c to be more pleasurable. I think the bonus with LSD is that you get take more tabs and get insanely fucked up without the overwhelming physiological changes you would get if you pushed 25c too far. So, LSD will feel safer to flirt with deeper trips. 25c up to 1200ug though is pure bliss and hard to beat.<br /><br />As for ROA, if you do your buccal right, then 15 mins is all you need. Considering your peak will be 3-4 hours, you don&#039;t want to waste the first whole hour maintaining the tab on your gum. The secret is to:<br />(i) Clear your gums of any residue or film. Do this by rinsing with a carbonated water (you know the real fizzy water, no sweeteners). Or if you want, just wipe the gum and make sure its clean. Avoid toothpaste or mouthwash though because these tend to leave a chemical film on your gum which will potentially inhibit absorption of the 25c.<br />(ii) Apply the to the top gum. The top gum stays nice and dry, and this is how you want it. Bottom gum works fine too, but saliva tends to accumulate in the bottom lip, and saliva will wash away the 25c to your stomach where it is wasted. If you do insists on bottom gum, then be sure to save your saliva. However you will get dry throat if you save the saliva for that long, so use top gum.<br />(iii) after 15 mins on gum, swish it around, bring it under your tounge or whatever for a few mins, then spit or swallow.<br /><br />If you&#039;re all good, then at the 20 min mark you will see some subtle changes. Give it an hour or two hours to plateau. With re-doses be careful. 1 quarter or 1 third of a tab at a time. A re-dose can have the effect of taking all the hit at once, so be mindful of that.<br /><br />The main point though is just to Enjoy! Just know that with the dose carefully measured its impossible to have anything except a brilliant experience.

The alcohol in mouthwash would also aid both extraction from the blotter and absorption through the mucous membrane.<br /><br />I know I get stronger effects from brushing than if I don&#039;t. In another thread about 25c you recommend 800ug-1.2mg as being good for watching tv, walking the neighborhood, or doing college assignments. When I have just 800ug I might be able to watch TV, would be wary about being able to walk the neighborhood, and most definitely would not be capable of completing any sort of written work. I also get some body load and thermoregulation effects that you only associate with much higher doses. So it would seem I&#039;m getting more bang for my buck.<br /><br />Of course this could be due to individual sensitivity levels, so I could just be lucky&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ll try just carbonated water next time and see how it compares to no brushing/brushing.<br />

				Hey bjhaus.. haven&#039;t seen ya round, very nice to meet you ^^. I&#039;m all for the spreading of knowledge of what is best, and if its true, I&#039;ll spread the same word as you are, about toothpaste etc. Keeping in mind that mouthwash and toothpaste have a very extensive list of ingredients and not just peroxide and alcohol (for example, some mouthwashes, including mine, are fluoride based with no alcohol whatsoever.. the fluoride def leaves a layer of &#039;protection&#039; on the teeth and gums)... I personally did try a full mouth clean with toothpaste/toothbrush followed by mouthwash and didn&#039;t realize any actual increases in dose. Not conclusive by any means.. It might be the variables that can interact too (tolerance, batch, type of mouthwash, whatever else). <br /><br />I tried batches from both enboom and aus2aus. Both awesome and both with their subtle differences in come up and intensity.. the tabs are on difference size/thickness blotter. Enboom has a new 1mg per tab batch coming soon it might be available already.. aus2aus has a perfect 800ug dose.. <br /><br />My mission when recommending 25c to people is only this: Just to share enough info that they take a dose large enough to get great enjoyment, but also to share enough info that people can judge how much to *not* take, because when I took too much (what I consider too much for me anyways) I I made a mental note to myself its a place I don&#039;t want to return to and I don&#039;t want to be responsible for bringing someone else there. People will go there I know, but at least they can own that experience and find out how I did.. by experimenting, but not through misinformation etc etc. Thats why in this &quot;help I&#039;m a noob&quot; thread I don&#039;t really like seeing &quot;Yeah I took 5 tabs and it was great&quot;, or &quot;me and my mate too 16 tabs in 1 nite, it was awesome&quot;...&nbsp; that&#039;s the kinda bad example that can get a noob in hospital and bring RCs into bad light.<br /><br />All good.. and thank you for the tips on peroxide and alcohol.. I&#039;ll look into it... And good to meet another enthusiast. Well that&#039;s what I am anyways...

				Cool...looks like more experimentation is required&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />Have you tried lower doses? I haven&#039;t yet but will try this next, just having a break in case of tolerance.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read mixed reports on tolerance buildup, some say fast, some say slow.&nbsp; What&#039;s been your experience with it?<br /><br />Looks like enboom is looking into HPBCD enhanced blotters as well which will boost absorption dramatically and remove the need for enhancement tricks of our own. <br />

				Hi All - Yeah i&#039;m just starting off with experimenting some of these goodies on SR<br /><br />So I went through some 25i blotters - with extreme caution vs what some of the other people here did (I appreciate we have those that journey ahead and give us an indication of maximum doses and the safety of these).<br /><br />I had just 200ug of 25i after a period of long Abstinence. Although I have had hundreds of Lucy trips in my life and did find that it certainly did have a good effect , that I got visual warping and very intense closed eye visuals. My interest is to use it for artistic and creative design purposes, i have no interest in getting f**k up. For that it is perfect and 200 - 400 ug will give a wealth of valuable creative ideas to play around with. Past 750ug you become rather impaired in motor judgement etc - I found it hard to concentrate - it become more of a getting &#039;hi&#039; experience where you sit back and take it in and enjoy . It really does seem pretty strong stuff to me. I think if you need to go past 2 of these blotters you have some serious tolerance which must be costing you a fortune, but each to their own.<br />&nbsp;

				That&#039;s right. Contaminating with what ?&nbsp; - no the only issue with handling these chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin - but this stuff isn&#039;t as sensitive as say LSD. So no real issue here.<br /><br />Oh the spread of the chemical on the paper might be uneven, so the exact dosing is always a bit approximate.
