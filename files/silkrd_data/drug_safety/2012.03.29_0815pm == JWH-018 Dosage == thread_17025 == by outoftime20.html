				I believe the orginial JWH-018 (not alternatives like am-2201) is safe if dosed correctly. I am making my own spice with this chem. I&#039;d like to know from someone else with experience making spice what dose to use. I&#039;m buying an ounce of marshmallow leaf, should I use 1 or 2 grams of jwh-018? I&#039;ve heard some people say a dose is 2mg and other say 5mg. Trying to get an idea of how much to actually use.

				Start with 1 and if it is to your particular liking then stick with it. <br />I think at one point I have used up to 4(by request)and that was fucking dumb. Some friends ended up in hospital and that was the end of my spice making. Im not 100% sure that maybe they smoked a hot spot in the mix but generally speaking it was way too much. Dont make it stronger than you would personally smoke it even if your friends beg you ;)<br />Other material that makes a nice smoking blend is Damiana, Mullien, Hops, Blue water-lilly, peppermint, and a few others I cant remember off the top of my head. ;)

				I use JWH quite a lot but I never exceed 5mg. If you haven&#039;t done it before I would stick to 2mg, it&#039;s one of those substances that is good but if you tip over the edge it&#039;s gunna be whack because it will spin you out/give you a panic attack. Start slow and build up, don&#039;t hit the bricks and kill the goodness. :)<br /><br />Also doing JWH samples at the moment, if you are interested shoot me a PM.

				I blend JWH-018 with green tea. This might not be marketable because a lot of people want a smell and look more like real pot. Green tea is very mild on the lungs and does not smell like pot which is a plus for me. Whatever you use play it safe and use a smaller 018/herb ratio. even a slight overdose of 018 is not fun (vomiting, anxiety). Your tolerance will build rather quickly and then levels out. I think I started with 1 gram of 018 to 2 ounces of foliage.Within 6 month of only using at night, I had to make it stronger. I went to a 1 gram to 30 gram mixture. I am also not sure if JWH-018 degrades over time or if it is a tolerance build up because my initial in purchase was&nbsp; Dec of 2009. I am now mixing 1 gram to 15 grams of green tea. this is one hit shit to me but this would be an instant overdose to someone who is not tolerant if the 018 has not degraded.
