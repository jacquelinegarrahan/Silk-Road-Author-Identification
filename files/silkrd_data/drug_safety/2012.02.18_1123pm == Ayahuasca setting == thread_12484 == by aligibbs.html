				Title: <strong>Ayahuasca setting</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I recently read in another thread about having an ayahuasca ceremony at a Daime. I&#039;ve been researching ayahuasca for a while and have decided I&#039;d like to take the plunge at some point. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering what people who have taken it before feel about the importance of the setting? There&#039;s places here in my country that are centers that offer varying packages containing a varying number of ceremonies, which sounds appealing. But in talking to people who have done it there&#039;s a frequent insistence that it be done &quot;right&quot; and that seems to mean in the middle of the Peruvian or Brazilian wilderness.<br /><br />Do people have any thoughts on this? Id be interested to hear where people did it, who with, and what effect they think this had on the effectiveness/scariness.<br /><br />I guess my thinking is that if I&#039;m going to be having that sort of (probably terrifying) experience, do I want to add my small phobia of insects into the mix (I know this makes me slightly ridiculous, but some creepy crawlies just freak me out)? Or will I be so involved in my own head that it won&#039;t make much difference?<br /><br />Oh, I should probably say that in any circumstance I&#039;d have an experienced Shaman there.<br /><br />Thanks :)

				As long as you have an experienced shamen, you are in complete darkness(or as dark as possible), are safe from being disturbed and free from outside noises, you have followed the ayahuasca diet for at least 24 hours beforehand, and haven&#039;t eaten 4-5 hours before the ceremony, you should be fine. Have faith in Mother Ayahuasca to show you what you need to see. You will face more fears than what you think, but that&#039;s what the shamen is there for.
