				I&#039;ve been smoking DMT and gradually getting to the breakthrough stage. So far I&#039;ve seen a few weird creatures (which I&#039;ll describe now). What I want to hear from you is - which creatures have you seen? Can you briefly describe them? Has anyone seen &quot;DMT elves&quot;? I&#039;ve read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_elf but I&#039;ve not encountered anything like that yet.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve seen so far:<br /><br />* I&#039;m stuck between moving giant worms (kind of like being stuck inside giant intestines) and I see that some people (humans) are stuck inside those worms. One human has tried reaching me with her hand (as if asking for help) when she was being swallowed.<br />* Some giant alien-looking creature trying to stuff me into its belly. Like, a giant kangaroo. I resist, the whole vision goes away.<br />* A giant man right above me trying to &quot;lift&quot; reality. As he&#039;s doing that, the reality (room) around me has this wireframe mesh that appears to be lifting up. I get scared and vision goes away.<br />* At the beginning of almost every trip I see these fractal shapeless colorful creatures that are getting closer and closer to my face, it&#039;s an uncomfortable (weird) feeling. They don&#039;t seem friendly and I feel like they&#039;re trying to &quot;snatch&quot; me. I feel like their &quot;hand&quot; are stretching towards me and trying to grab my face.<br /><br />Share what you&#039;ve seen, especially about the elves! What are they like?

				the &quot;elves&quot; is a meme that needs to go away.&nbsp; its way overblown and just a figment of terence mckenna&#039;s imagination.&nbsp; i guess i&#039;ve encountered what seemed to me to be a swarm of mischievous faces, but they aren&#039;t solidly formed, and in my best guess, representative of something to you personally.&nbsp; or maybe we just see so many faces and encounter so many beings in our day to day lives that when we trip that far out we just superimpose those experiences into the dmt world.&nbsp; <br /><br />i dunno, i wish there was some way to study it, but the more i contemplate reality and psychedelic experiences i get an ever stronger hunch that everything that happens in your waking, dreaming, and tripping world is just some extension of yourself.<br /><br />so don&#039;t think about elves.&nbsp; it&#039;ll just mess with you.&nbsp; try to just be.

				after using salvia about ten or fifteen separate times, I always get brought back to the same world with the same strange elf like peoples looking at me but never engaging me. they aren&#039;t &quot;elves&quot; per se, but they are smaller types of people in a different world. Every single time I enter this world I get the feeling of &quot;you did it to yourself again? Why are you here? Go away.&quot;<br /><br />no experience with DMT yet though

				the best hallucination i saw was on acid and MDA when i was tripping in the woods. i saw this insane staircase wrap around this huge tree all the way to the top and was this rainbow castle with windows that i could see inside with little elves. i literally looked in one of the windows in this castle and saw two elves fucking, very trippy to say the least&nbsp; ;)

My body becomes foreign to me and I start to get weirded out by it in a way. I don&#039;t recognize myself in the mirror (well, I know it&#039;s me, but my mind doesn&#039;t accept that). As far as colors, everything around me does tend to shift into orange/red spectrum, if I keep my eyes open to look, of course. Any patterns/shapes (shadows on the wall, for example) will start to resemble beings/faces and start to move. With eyes closed it&#039;s a completely different world, sometimes very familiar human setting, and other times completely unreal.<br /><br />Back to the &quot;elves&quot; though. I guess it&#039;s just a nickname for any entity met in hyperspace (that&#039;s another word..). DMT has some weird vocabulary that first seemed funny to me but now I kinda got used to it.<br /><br />Cool thing about DMT is, though, every trip is very different. Can&#039;t get easily bored of it. Also, it doesn&#039;t make you want to do it every day. In fact, I have to build up courage before my every trip.

				Honestly, No. I have never seen anything that made me think elf, dwarf, etc., But I have seen some sort of an entity, It was a face with multi colored squares that were constantly changing colors and the face would jump out, kinda like those 3-D arts you have to stare at for a sec. B4 you can see it. That&#039;s it though

				I&#039;ve seen the machine elves, but I read nearly every trip report for DMT that I could find and a lot of them mentioned the machine elves, so I was expecting it to happen. That might have had an effect on why I saw them. They&#039;re wonderful creatures, always excited that I&#039;ve come to visit them.
