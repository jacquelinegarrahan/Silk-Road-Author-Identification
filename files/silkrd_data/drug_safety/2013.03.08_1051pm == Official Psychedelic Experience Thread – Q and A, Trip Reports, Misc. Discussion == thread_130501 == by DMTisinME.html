				I have created this thread to funnel all non-essential posts from vendor threads, but also to create a one-stop place to stop and chat, have questions answered, and post your experiences in regard to these amazing chemicals – natural and synthetic. <br /><br />Have at it! Any and all psychedelic discussion is welcome.

				Psychedelics are my DoC, but I generally prefer to solo trip.&nbsp; I find company too distracting, and my close friends don&#039;t even know I do it and I wouldnt want them to do it (they dont do drugs besides EtOH and THC).&nbsp; I also kind of like having it as my little secret.<br /><br />So now that I have access to so many great things, I need to find good things to do while tripping.&nbsp; Any suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; I usually watch weird movies, walk around outside... I always intend to draw or play piano but I&#039;m usually too fucked up to focus on it for more than a minute.&nbsp; What does everybody else like to do?

				***************TRIP REPORT*********************<br /><br />I&#039;ve had to split this report up into two posts because it exceeds the maximum post length.&nbsp; Please read on.<br /><br />TL;DR: People sent me drugs.&nbsp; They worked. -_o<br />Also: HOLY FUCK SHIT!&nbsp; Nothing clears the mind quite like having the universe crammed down your eye-holes several times over.<br /><br />SUMMARY: &quot;I was exploring around the falls in the forest and accidentally spawned the universe. sorry.&quot;<br /><br />***********************************************<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I have been using psychedelics for over a decade and am a VERY experienced tripper.&nbsp; I also meditate regularly and practise other forms of mysticism.&nbsp; This means that I have a tremendous amount of control over my trips in general and also have the energy stores to find my way back from wherever the trip takes me.&nbsp; That said, this trip was intense enough to make me freak out a bit.&nbsp; If you are a beginner, do NOT try this at home (I&#039;m really not kidding about this).<br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />RECIPE: Unfortunately, I don&#039;t often have days I can commit to tripping anymore.&nbsp; If I&#039;d had more time, I&#039;d have tried the pharmahuasca and the LSD separately (probably more advisable).&nbsp; Because I only had this one day to work with, this trip turned into sort of a smorgasbord of everything I had.<br /><br />QTY&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DRUG&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SOURCE<br />~85mg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;harmala alkaloids extracted from syrian rue&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;amazon.com (extracted myself)<br />3 pills&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hash oil capsules&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hashman<br />2g&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50X standardised, enriched salvia leaves&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://arenaethnobotanicals.com<br />2 tabs (overcut)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LSD, Tess&#039;s latest WOW doubleprints&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tessellated<br />~150mg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pale yellow DMT (very pure)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pimpit<br /><br />*************************************************<br /><br />PREP DAY: Novices should not trip alone.&nbsp; Even if you&#039;re an experienced tripper and you&#039;re going to trip alone, you need to choose your location wisely.&nbsp; The place where you trip should be within easy walking distance of the place you intend to sleep; it should shelter you from close contact with the general public; it should be somewhere you won&#039;t get lost; and if possible, it&#039;s usually best to go somewhere &#039;natural&#039;.<br /><br />I&#039;m tremendously fortunate in that I have a range of options meeting all the criteria above within the immediate vicinity of my house.&nbsp; I knew about where I wanted to go, but needed to take a scouting trip the day before to choose the exact spot and familiarise myself with the area.<br /><br />The place I chose was a couple of hills in the forest and the small gully between them.&nbsp; I had plenty of space to roam, the hills were steep and I had to clamber up the muddy slopes by grabbing roots and fallen trees (which is a lot of fun while tripping).&nbsp; The stream in the gully ran down a gauntlet of stepped limestone strata, creating a series of smallish falls.&nbsp; This place was ideal.<br /><br />****************************************************<br /><br />THE TIMELINE:<br /><br />T = 0:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Took harmala extract and hash pills.<br />T = 20-40 mins:&nbsp; &nbsp; Drank salvia tea.<br />T = ~50 mins:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began chewing tabs; left home.<br />T = ~1:15:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Took DMT capsule; arrived at chosen location.<br />T = ~4 hrs:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began to head home.<br />T = ~6 hrs:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Came down from pharma.<br />T = ~15 hrs:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smoked DMT.<br />T = ~17 hrs:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Went to bed, nearing baseline.<br /><br />*****************************************************<br /><br />THE EXPERIENCE: I should really start by saying that the trip I&#039;m describing was very much THE trip.&nbsp; Having tripped as much and as hard as I have, I did not think I could possibly be having THE definitive trip this late in the day ... but there it is.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to describe the trip in as much detail as words permit, including things which &#039;go without saying&#039; for acid heads.<br /><br />I started with a hardy (if silly) breakfast of eggs and berries.&nbsp; The diet restrictions for those taking MAOIs are pretty hard to work around, and this was all I could come up with ... at least it was nutritious.&nbsp; I took the harmala on a mostly-full stomach.<br /><br />One thing I was not allowed was caffeine, which is really rather unfortunate.&nbsp; I normally make salvia tea by steeping the salvia leaves once (for a full 15 mins in water brought to a full boil) on their own, retaining the used leaves, adding a liberal amount of strong tea on top and then steeping this (mixing the results of the two brews).&nbsp; Salvia is incredibly bitter, and the tea helps to mask and disperse this flavour.&nbsp; Rerunning the salvia leaves helps the process to be a reasonably efficient extraction of the salvorin compounds desired.&nbsp; Instead of doing this, I reran the leaves with only a small amount of re-boiled water, and added honey to the result to calm the gag reflex the taste of salvia induces.<br /><br />The salvia and hash were kicking in before I left the house, and I had some pre-echoes intimating to me that the trip I was embarking on was going to be something quite significant.&nbsp; I took the tabs on my way out the door, having concealed the DMT capsule in a tin of breath mints in my pocket.&nbsp; I set out on my way, armed with a canteen, a pair of high-quality headphones (not earbuds), and a 12-hour playlist that I specifically designed for acid trips.&nbsp; Tess&#039;s blotter paper was unusual and took lot of jaw work, but I eventually got it down.&nbsp; I waited to dose the DMT until I was clear of the park which lies between my house and my chosen trip spot.<br /><br />I decided to base my operations at a spot higher up the gully than I&#039;d come on my scouting trip.&nbsp; Here there were three short (~2m) falls arranged in a semi-circle draining into a wide, shallow pool which then spilled off into a larger fall.&nbsp; By the time I got there, the LSD was beginning to kick in. For a short time, I had to sit, feeling as if I might get ill.&nbsp; I belched up shrooms for a bit, but this discomfort passed fairly quickly.<br /><br />As I got over my queasiness, I began to climb up the slopes and play all around in the trees.&nbsp; The trip was coming on very strong by now and felt entirely like a very heavy acid trip.&nbsp; I was thrilled at how clean and strong the acid was.&nbsp; I was never actually able to isolate the pharma in this trip, the LSD was dominant the whole way.<br /><br />I felt very close to the trees, and I began to try to extend my feelings into one to feel its life force, as I had done with other trees on other acid trips.&nbsp; Nothing immediately happened.&nbsp; What I came to realise was that I could choose what I would feel ... if I chose to feel something, that experience would make itself &#039;real&#039; in the sense that what I&#039;d be feeling would really be the tree&#039;s feelings in some way; on the other hand, if I chose to think there was no way I could feel what it was like to be a tree, I would be right and feel nothing.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t make any choice, but did stop trying.<br /><br />I went back down into the gully and played in the waterfalls for a bit.&nbsp; I was overjoyed, feeling the utter idyllicness of this setting; the only word was &#039;lavish&#039;.&nbsp; Every moment&#039;s desire and whim was immediately quenched, and I was overwhelmed with the sheer exuberance of being.&nbsp; I experienced total pleasure simply because I could. &#039;All hail me, the mind that is,&#039; I thought, &#039;simply because ... why not?&#039; (in other words, all things served at my pleasure out of a simple lack of anything else to do).<br /><br />As I stood in the middle of this stream, I began to feel very much like it.&nbsp; I, too, was not a fixed constant, but merely a flow---I could feel the life and awareness flowing through me and knew I was all the more permanent for being ever-changing and inconcrete. With this awareness began my ego death, and the stream was again the ideal model for it: a drop which comes to the edge of the waterfall doesn&#039;t worry the other drops with his doubts about the situation ... he tells the drop behind him that everything&#039;s going to be okay.&nbsp; The drop doesn&#039;t KNOW that, but he does it because ... well, wouldn&#039;t you?&nbsp; When two partnered drops of water are parted to go around a rock, they will not come together again in the same way on the other side, but each resolves to make friends with the drops he finds when he gets there.&nbsp; So it was with the pieces of my self; as they came apart, they filled each other with a comforting sense that it would be alright and chose to be friends with each other, and I was very glad such friendliness was in my nature.<br /><br />The strange thing is: I had experienced all this before.&nbsp; Not simply the ego death, but the exact analogy with the water drops and this exact scene I was in.&nbsp; I had mostly forgotten it until then, but I had flashed on this place with the waterfalls on a trip years before I actually moved here or ever saw the spot where I was.&nbsp; I now know where it is of course, and I wonder if other scenes I have flashed upon while tripping will be realised like this in the future.<br /><br />In any case, I had handled the actual ego death quite well, but after a while of being very undefined and liquid, I received a jolt.&nbsp; Reality flashed red and there was a message: &quot;This is the point at which you would have died.&quot;&nbsp; Somehow I was in a simulation.&nbsp; Some kind of anti-drug group had obviously tampered with the drug experience building in this safeguard/control mechanism.&nbsp; Immediately following this, some computer code appeared in my visual field and the warning went away.&nbsp; The drug makers must have hacked the security system to allow the trip to continue.&nbsp; I thought &#039;the tripping community sure has come a long way since I last dropped L.&#039;<br /><br />The hack was not to last, however, and almost immediately another warning flashed.&nbsp; It was again followed by another hack.&nbsp; This happened over and over. Each time the warnings and the hacks got more and more sophisticated, measures and counter-measures evolving through their mutual struggle.&nbsp; They grew like warring colonies of bacteria---like a game of Wei Chi.&nbsp; The warning messages kept appealing to different forms of authority: some told me I was under arrest, others were really irrelevant to me---there was even a &quot;THIS IS YOUR MOTHER&quot; message designed for high schoolers.<br /><br />At one point, I became aware that the entire experience was a recording of sense data being used as evidence in a court proceeding which I had brought to trial or which had been brought on my behalf (it was unclear whether I was indeed dead or had merely suffered some sort of massive brain damage). I didn&#039;t want to think I&#039;d do such a frivolous thing, but I was no longer &#039;me&#039; and so there was no telling.&nbsp; This too was interrupted by further cycles of warnings and hacks, as well as another new component, advertisements.&nbsp; Windows would flash open to show me places that I could go and carnal pleasures that were mine for the taking.&nbsp; Most of these were various bizarre forms of sexual perversion, and none of them appealed to me.&nbsp; I had also seen something like this in previous trips, but it had felt less digital---more like the temptation of Christ than a marketing ploy.&nbsp; Somehow, this all was taking place in the future, and all the interruptions I kept seeing were superimposed&nbsp; onto a reconstruction of my experiences.&nbsp; The digital overtones of this trip were very pronounced, fairly dark, and entirely new to me.<br /><br />I was trapped in the middle of this whole clash, just some dupe.&nbsp; I could follow what was going on, but could do nothing about it.&nbsp; I thought the whole thing was extremely unfair to me and began to feel as though someone was having a laugh at my expense.&nbsp; As things progressed, the whole complex system evolved: control mechanisms, counter-measures by freedom fighters, a ridiculous lawsuit, and an entire pleasure industry.&nbsp; As they evolved together faster and faster, I saw them at higher and higher levels of organisation, traces of the forces shaping and controlling this future society.&nbsp; As I saw this from further and further back, I realised the whole complex had made up the living system contained in a single drop of water where I stood.&nbsp; As my perspective pulled further and further out, the same evolutionary processes created the whole stream, the forest, the world, and the universe in successive layers of complexity.<br /><br />My mind was reeling at this point.&nbsp; Still convinced I had died, I decided I needed to get out of there.&nbsp; Somehow, I had the presence of mind to grab my jacket, sunglasses, and canteen before leaving.&nbsp; I climbed down the gully believing I was now stuck for eternity in a hellish trip in the middle of a universe reconstructed from the mind of a dirty hippie post-graduate student who&#039;d died and didn&#039;t know shit.&nbsp; The &#039;dirty hippie&#039; part surprised me since I&#039;d never really thought of myself that way ... but it&#039;s what I was thinking at the time.<br /><br />I walked home through a dream.&nbsp; Things appeared out of a blank fog as I created the scenery around me.&nbsp; I was despondent and did not create complete or detailed surroundings, and the whole setting looked like a scene out of &#039;Waking Life&#039;.&nbsp; The way home was not the way I&#039;d come: everything was utterly generic and the walk was exaggeratedly prolonged.&nbsp; I felt as though I were walking on a treadmill in front of a screen which recycled the same block for me to walk over and over.&nbsp; I began to wonder if my mind would actually allow me to get home at all or if I&#039;d have to just walk indefinitely.<br /><br />For a while, I saw movie credits like the ones at the beginning of a John Wayne film.&nbsp; &quot;Starring: Guess Who?&quot; All of the credits were me, of course, although this wasn&#039;t self-agrandising as it may sound, but rather extremely sardonic, as if to say &#039;Hey big shot.&nbsp; That&#039;s right, you did this.&nbsp; Welcome to your death, you fucking asshole.&#039;<br /><br />For a bit, there was a policeman on a bike ahead of me.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if he was real or really a policeman, but he had on a yellow reflective jacket which made me think so.&nbsp; Knowing that I was walking through my own mindscape, I realised that I could make him go away entirely, but instead I just pushed him a bit farther up the street to a distance calculated to give the comforting illusion of a presence of authority without being a threat to me.&nbsp; I recalled having seen this before too, and found it strange as I had never before found comfort in the presence of police.<br /><br />As I neared my house, I kept getting messages flashing at me that something was very much not right and I needed medical attention.&nbsp; Although I was very confused, I was pretty sure it was too late for that and that I was actually dead up in the gully I had left.&nbsp; In any case, I had no idea how to seek medical attention in my frame of mind at the time.&nbsp; Eventually, I did arrive home, and I immediately went to the computer.&nbsp; I pulled up the internet browser, but no one was online (at least, no one I wanted to talk to).<br /><br />I was still fairly certain that I had died and that anyone I might actually reach would only be an extension of my own mangled mind.&nbsp; At the same time, I knew that I had lost my grasp of the situation and thought that in case I actually WAS still alive and simply ABOUT to die, I ought to say something to someone.&nbsp; The fact that no one was there only convinced me further that I was dead.<br /><br />I took a shower and for a long time, walked naked around the house, looking for a specific pair of shorts I wanted to put on (apparently I never thought to look in the drawer where I keep them).&nbsp; I did not want to be found dead of an overdose in my home and be naked to boot.&nbsp; Finally, I settled on a pair of sweats instead and lay down on the floor.&nbsp; I felt slightly better than I had, but still expected to die at any moment.&nbsp; I put on some Eddie Izzard to watch while I waited for this.<br /><br />Watching this comedy routine soothed me immensely.&nbsp; I was also beginning to come down.&nbsp; This part frightened me a bit.&nbsp; Was I now going to come down and continue to lead my life as if this wasn&#039;t a completely pretend universe I had spawned with my death?&nbsp; Could I bear such a thing?&nbsp; Again, the humour helped with this.<br /><br />I repeatedly stopped to check if anyone was online.&nbsp; When I finally saw a friend, I messaged him.&nbsp; I had something so catastrophic and important to tell him, but I now had to articulate it, something I was in no condition to do.&nbsp; What I ended up writing was:<br /><br />&quot;I was exploring around the falls in the forest and accidentally spawned the universe. sorry.&quot;<br /><br />I think this is hilarious now, but at the time I was not trying to be clever.&nbsp; His response was sarcastic and, to my mind, ambiguous.&nbsp; It did not quell my misgivings about what had happened.

				***************TRIP REPORT*********************<br /><br />THE EXPERIENCE (cont&#039;d): By the end of the Eddie Izzard routine, I was pretty much okay.&nbsp; I was certainly still tripping, but the pharma had run its course, and I was left only with the acid---this I could handle.&nbsp; I was now able to piece together what had happened.&nbsp; Although I had indulged in many negative feelings, I had shattered and had not only succeeded in rearranging and reassembling my self, but had at the same time rearranged and reassembled the universe.&nbsp; To a large degree, I had chosen the life I already had (as I&#039;ve done before after an ego death), but I had also made changes, both in myself and in the universe.&nbsp; I had sacrificed myself to spawn the universe from within itself.&nbsp; In this way, I was like an ancient god (Dionysus? Osiris? Attis?&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find the name of the god I&#039;m thinking of).&nbsp; In any case, I had to recognise that this was a true feat of witchcraft*.<br /><br />*I referred to practising mysticism earlier.&nbsp; I should say these practises are concerned with exercising control over my own mind and body, obtaining information, and probing the mysteries of the universe.&nbsp; They are ordinarily a very far cry from &#039;practical magic&#039; or anything termable as &#039;witchcraft&#039;.&nbsp; I know I lose some people by even using such a word, but nevertheless, this was my realisation.<br /><br />I continued tripping on the acid for the rest of the day and night.&nbsp; It was a bit of a shame to have come home so early, but it was now too late for me to try to go back to my spot.&nbsp; I wanted to get back outside, but had nowhere to actually go, and so I just hung out on my patio and listened to Lustmord&#039;s &#039;Rising&#039; (great LSD album, BTW).<br /><br />The day and everything in sight was perfect in every conceivable respect, and I contemplated my deep affection for the tree that grows at the end of my patio as I felt its stabilising influence.&nbsp; As the sun came out from behind some clouds, I looked at it.&nbsp; I had heard of sun gazing before and had been intrigued by the idea.&nbsp; I realised that we go through life ignoring the sun.&nbsp; We look askance at it and avoid acknowledging it, and in general treat the sun with an aloofness which is downright shameful considering all it does for us.<br /><br />I had already opened Pandora&#039;s box that afternoon, playing with things that must not be touched.&nbsp; I had already been looking behind the veil, and i wouldn&#039;t hesitate to look in the forbidden direction.&nbsp; When you think about it, there is a direction in which we never allow ourselves to look---that is, directly at the sun.&nbsp; In fact, I used to look directly at the sun as a kid (mostly I think because I&#039;d been told not to).&nbsp; Despite this, I&#039;ve always had very good vision, and I&#039;m quite skeptical of claims that it causes retinal damage (you&#039;ll&nbsp; have to come to your own conclusions).<br /><br />Anyway, as the sun made its way toward setting into the crotch of my tree, I stared into it.&nbsp; Embraced it.&nbsp; It felt like finally acknowledging an old friend you&#039;ve been neglecting for peevish and silly reasons.&nbsp; I stared the sun in the eye, recognising not only our friendship, but our oneness.&nbsp; The sun in the sky is really me, only I project my experience down below into this human animal so as to see by my own light.&nbsp; The sun burnt warmth and love into my heart ... it was an indescribably beautiful moment.<br /><br />After the sun had gone down and the album was over, I resumed the playlist which had been interrupted when I got home.&nbsp; I spent a long time simply watching electric sheep and contemplating the experiences of the day.&nbsp; Hours later, as the trip was winding down, I decided to smoke some DMT.&nbsp; I&#039;d tried smoking DMT on acid before without much success, but I wanted to give it another go.<br /><br />I turned out the lights and sat in bed with my headphones.&nbsp; I took a small lungful of DMT and lay back.&nbsp; I could feel the DMT hit and saw visuals, but they did not conform to their usual pattern.&nbsp; The visions were scattered and remained almost completely abstract rather than resolving into the intricate beings and worlds I normally see.&nbsp; I had the distinct impression that the presence of the LSD had somehow confused the DMT crystals.&nbsp; I experienced the usual DMT mind trip nonetheless, but considering the mental state I&#039;d started from, this amounted to only a small shift in perspective.&nbsp; I will not repeat this experiment.<br /><br />After a couple more hours, I decided to go to bed.&nbsp; I was able to get to sleep after 30 or 40 minutes, still tripping but nearing baseline.&nbsp; Although I had not been able to distinguish its character, the pharmahuasca had left a clear impact on the trip&#039;s profile, lasting a total of 3.5--4 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;The LSD, by the time I went to sleep, had lasted over 16 hours.&nbsp; Thus I was tripping on LSD alone for much more than long enough to judge its quality.&nbsp; This blotter was laid with WOW, so the quality was supreme.&nbsp; The advertised strength of 200ug per tab seems accurate to me if not even a bit understated.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely that the unusual length of this trip was due to the harmala alkaloids and possible that these also affected the intensity of the LSD experience I had, but I still believe these tabs to be&nbsp; accurately dosed at 200ug (I&#039;m not sure if this was still in any doubt, but if so banish it).&nbsp; This was LSD of a really fantastic quality, and I will definitely be ordering more.<br /><br />I will have to play with the my pharma recipe in future as I had been hoping for something of longer duration (and maybe less intensity).&nbsp; One problem was that I gathered conflicting information from erowid about the appropriate harmala dosage---in one place it said 50mg and in another 1.5mg per kg body mass ... which amounts to about 120mg in my case (I split the difference and hoped for the best). Next time, too, I will try the pharma without any LSD.<br /><br />I consider this to have been the best trip of my life.&nbsp; It&#039;s true that it was pretty unpleasant for a couple of hours, and I wish I could have stayed in the forest longer as I&#039;d planned to do, but the net result was incredibly positive.&nbsp; Since coming down, I&#039;ve begun to suspect the &#039;bad&#039; trip I had was partly the fault of my playlist.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve tripped successfully to this list before, I think the music had taken a turn that was too dark for the extreme intensity of this trip around the time things started to go bad.&nbsp; On the other hand, it&#039;s also been my experience with psychedelics that things have to go a bit bad before they can get really good in any meaningful way, and I certainly wouldn&#039;t trade this trip away for anything.<br /><br />This is the end of my rambling report.&nbsp; I hope it has been informative to you.&nbsp; Happy tripping and be safe.<br /><br />*******************FIN************************

				An excellent report Great Green Arkleseizure. It was a pleasure to read. Here is mine from this weekend, which too was very profound.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3/09, at 9 PM, I ate 6.5g of penis envy shrooms. They were from TheGoodGuys when they had them listed in Nov/Dec. I had already taken them 3 or 4 times and they are simply phenomenal.<br /><br />I felt very full as it was hard to wash down all of them and did so with the help of a few cereal bars. I began to read a chapter in the Dhammapada, The Just. I read only a page in a half before quitting because at first it was somewhat difficult to process the information, but then ultimately too hard to even read the words. I had been planning to listen to the playlist “Transcendental Xperience” I made for the trip, but wanted to be peaking during. So I put on a soothing album – Illinois by Sufjan Stevens – in an attempt to curve the possible onset of any nausea, due to the combination of the “mush” bars and quite a few shrooms.&nbsp; With the lights on I began to think about the experience I had ahead of me. There were still no noticeable open eye visuals – at least in the light. I closed my eyes and had definite closed eye visuals, with beings. They were not quite scary but so foreign in a way that made them seem frightening. After thinking this I was thought, “What kind of a person is afraid of something just because it is different than they are?” “A bad person; a prejudiced person,” was my answer. So to this end I came up with the idea that if you wholeheartedly love what you fear, then fear ceases to exist, and applied this. The beings in my CEV’s immediately became friendlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After clearing my mind a few minutes longer with the music and then without, I decided I was tripping hard enough to start the playlist. So I turned out the lights, put my headphones (quality pair) back on and started the playlist, which entailed of:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midnight in a Perfect World (Gift of Gab Mix) by DJ Shadow<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood on the Motorway by DJ Shadow<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exogenesis: Symphony Part One by Muse<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know the Way by Grimes<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gem by Matthew Dear<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggot Brain by Funkadelic<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything in Its Right Place by Radiohead<br /><br />TOTAL – 38:47<br /><br />The visuals were full on at this point. I immediately succumbed to the experience, letting myself drift into the music &amp; visuals. I remember the hallway light being on, which allowed the room to be subtlety lit which allowed me to see the outline of the room. This allowed the OEV’s to be much more “real” and defined. I kept seeing groups of 3 dots in a triangle design that were swirling constantly, then I would close my eyes and they would envelope my body, if my body was still there – they more accurately enveloped me. I was in a phantasmagoria of blue dominant visuals that seemed to move with the music. When the playlist reached “Know the Way,” my ceiling became as smooth as an ice rink and the dots and patterns swirled around on it like Olympic figure skaters, with such grace and skill. I noticed that I liked the open eye visuals a little more because they were more constant, but it was best to change it up frequently – the COV’s were most intense right when I closed my eyes. Starting in “Gem” and continuing through “Maggot Brain” I experienced a powerful ego death. I was completely outside my body. I was only my soul floating through the visuals of what could have been other, long forgotten souls that were delighted by my company. I began to return to my body during “Everything in Its Right Place.” Everything did indeed feel exactly as it should, I was extremely refreshed, amazed, and uninhibited – reality was perfect the way it was, I did not need to alter it a bit. Funnily enough, immediately, like the second the song came on, a women’s face in the outline of a certain artwork from the Warhol type art era came into the visual – hundreds of them. They were flying and swirling and they stretched with the direction they moved, exactly like ghosts. I tried to look up the artwork today but couldn’t find it.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got up after the playlist and sat contemplating what I had experienced while stetching – which felt utterly fantastic as I had been extremely tight from exercise. This continued and was very liberating, and afterwards I felt very, very relaxed. I then looked in the mirror and decided to actually look at how I might conduct myself during the day – something that I never do because I would feel too egotistical doing so. But it was very educational and I compared the differences between remaining expressionless and just subtly smiling and could not believe the difference it made. I then vowed to always smile when feeling happy or neutral and only not smiled when I was feeling sad/mad, which I joked to myself would be never. I was listening to the Beach Boys at this point and the album, Today ended with the song “Bull Sessions with Big Daddy,” which isn’t actually a song, but them just chatting and talking, totally care-free and perfectly expressed the mentality of what I assume they are like. I thought, “I absolutely love this,” and wanted to conduct myself in a similar fashion, totally carefree, loving everything – sharing the conversation, sharing the love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this I felt the need to share this profound experience and called a friend, but mostly to just “pass on good vibes” rather than entail the experience, because it was beyond words, and would have been difficult to explain in my state of mind.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this I found my brother, who was in town but had decided not to trip, and explained what I had experienced to him and we talked about society, life, and our father. I realized that he was likely depressed and whenever I was around him always hostile and defensive and never laughed, except in a sarcastic cynical manner. I felt bad for never noticing this before. I knew he wasn’t happy, and I knew that he was almost “choosing” to remain unhappy, as I said: “He’s just swatting happiness away when it comes to him. Happiness isn’t something you can actively seek out, it’s something that comes to you, and if you actively choose not to take it, isn’t that what depression is?” I though back to my dad listening to certain songs in the car with us as a kid, and realized that only then was he actually happy, and I desperately wanted to see him that way again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this perhaps the most powerful experience that has happened to me on psychedelics came into being. My brother and I began to listen to the Beach Boys Hits, which I had not heard in years, but was my absolute favorite growing up. I began to become flooded with thousands of memories from early childhood that had not occurred to me in years. I could have given every detail of all the places I’d been, and especially the things that were “taught” to me. Looking back I would describe this as a “death of time.” All the memories of my life had come to the surface simultaneously, which is different from just having recent and frequent memories at the surface. I was myself from every year of existence. I was me from all ages. I began to realize exactly how I viewed the world as a child and how corrupted my view has become with knowledge, just how beautifully pure my mind was. I really became aware of how everything I had been taught contradicted something else I had been taught. My mind was absolutely flying at this point, so it is hard to remember all that I thought. All I wanted as a child was to be good to everyone, but everyone taught me that to be completely selfless was to be irresponsible, essentially that you succeed by being evil &amp; selfish. My mind was reduced from thinking of all the possibilities to a essentially a single track mind. You are taught that ONE thing is right as child, when you inherently know that there are many, many ways to accomplish or look at anything. I was deeply saddened when I realized how desensitized so called “education” had made me become. I was taught to repress everything that was not socially tolerable, I was taught not to be what society wanted from me and not what I wanted to be. I was taught not to be me, and this was the most unnatural thing I could think of. You are taught to be stone-faced and not approach strangers, that it is somehow wrong to or not masculine to express love and kindness to everyone – you can only do this to certain people and then still only so much. By repressing yourself, you lose touch with yourself, you become a person outside of yourself – you become what society, the government especially included wants you to be. It struck me as incredibly immoral to try to shape anyone into something you want them to be. The more I was taught, the less I knew of my own natural perceptions. I was corrupted by “facts” and the unchangeable morals of society, thinking of how I couldn’t believe as a child that witnessing murder was ok, but seeing a naked body was not. I thought of my childhood perception on firearms and realized that as a child I could not fathom the use or need for them. I pointed to a movie poster where two men are holding guns, “essentially, guns are used to protect your stuff. ‘If you take my shit, I will kill you.’ How can your shit be worth more than someone else’s life?”&nbsp; This was a tipping point for materialism, and I realized that as a child I was so free because I didn’t have anything. I was free of possessions. The biggest corruption was being taught that you have to have shit to be successful &amp; happy and in order to be successful, you should do immoral things along the way. No thank you. I value myself more than my things. At this point I wanted to leave all my shit behind and live in the wild, and if I died, it would be ok, because at least it would be right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that I was close to “conquering the human brain.” Or basically understanding it so fully that I had complete control over it – “I’m a genius. This is what being a genius means!” I had unlimited creativity: all my thoughts were pure like they were as a child. I felt like I could have done something amazing but the trip was nearing the end, and I was too focused on the amazing experience I was having at the moment. Eventually, my mental endurance began to falter, and as I tried to fall asleep at 4:30 or later, I still could not remember how long I had been tripping, what year it was, or who was still alive, I would see when I wake up, and which “me” I would return to when I woke up. The last thing I thought to myself was, “oh well, I may have been tripping for a year today, but when I wake up I’ll be normal. I think.” I woke up myself in 2013, feeling ever so refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I experienced I would call a rebirth. I felt 100% cleansed of all external stimuli and was one of the most liberating experiences of my life. I re-experienced all the changes to my personality &amp; perspective and critically analyzed the influence of them. I think that the unlocking of this was due to music I head heard so long ago and not often since, after all after smell, sound, especially music is most associated with memories. I thank the Beach Boys and the TheGoodGuys.

Although I did not come here with an experience, I left here with more than that. My non-psyechedelic travels have lead me to the conclusion that as Humans, we have been put in this physical body and this planet, to create. We ALL create whether it is one way or another, but we all either do it consciously, or sub-consciously; manifesting those wavelengths in reality. When one begins to create everything in their life consciously, then one has made a huge stride whether Spiritually, Psychologically or both, and closer to being in complete harmony with existence.<br /><br />Hopefully the boomers I&#039;m supposed to grab in the next week or two will give me an opportunity to add to this thread. :)<br />While talking out the trip I described above with the buddy whom I had messaged mid-trip, I was lead to summarise things this way: &quot;Absolutely everything&#039;s a choice.&nbsp; The whole trick is being conscious that you&#039;re making it.&quot;&nbsp; This is the essential lesson that every psychedelic experience I&#039;ve ever had has been teaching me time and time again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				i would like to share an experience i had a couple nights ago. took 400 mcg lsd, 3 g shrooms, 250 mg mdma (in two doses), and an unknown amount of ketamine and nitrous. i dosed in half hour intervals, and that combo was just what the doctor ordered!&nbsp; the chemicals meshed together so perfectly... one did not overpower the others. my girlfriend kitty flipped and we spent most of the trip growing closer and merging into one. it also helped her conquer her anxiety. sometimes you just need to reset your brain. what better way than to moon flip? :P

				I&#039;ll chuck my first time 25i report in, reposted from Tyler&#039;s Big&#039;n&#039;Dandy thread...<br />---<br /><br />First Time 25i-NBOMe trip report. Apologies for the length, but felt this fine substance deserved a bit more that &quot;Fuck! This shit is mental!&quot;&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Male, late 30&#039;s, no underlying health/psych issues, very experienced with a wide range of RC&#039;s. Have not tried 2C-I or 25i before though.<br /><br />Setting: nice room, big windows looking onto trees &amp; sky, bright wintry day. Alone, and not likely to be interrupted, apart from by our cat…<br /><br />The tabs arrived that morning, and this was my last free day for a while, so wanted to give them a shot ASAP. Always special to try something new for the first time…!<br /><br />1100&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two pieces of toast with thick Marmite on each, had read elsewhere that niacin helps counter potential vasoconstriction issues with 25i. Certainly did no harm anyway.<br /><br />1205&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insufflated a tiny 50mg line of MXE, again, the combo gets good reports and I like MXE a lot, so was a no-brainer, even though part of me thinks you should try to get to know a new substance in isolation.<br /><br />1215&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 x 1200 mcg tab into lower left cheek pouch. Taste barely noticeable, and the tab stayed there with no discomfort or effort.<br /><br />1240&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling really pleasant, but no visual effects. Remember thinking &quot;like licking butter&quot; a lot, don&#039;t know if this was the MXE helping but the come-up was far smoother than say, 2C-B. Really nice gradual glow, warm feelings, minimal rushes, not so much as a hint of nausea. Vague erotic thoughts, but would have been unable to act on them I think… ;-(<br /><br />1250&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;At Les&quot; by Carl Craig comes on, and a flood of blissful memories washes over me.<br /><br />1256&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Going off baseline, all still smooth and great. Chew &amp; swallow tab, blotting paper it ain&#039;t! Still firm and chewy, but no danger of it breaking up too soon I suppose.<br /><br />1330&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gentle pulse and throb to everything, colours richer, but not electric like with say 2CB. Fractal patterns rippling through things though. Can type easy enough to text tho. Become a bit concerned I&#039;ve maybe not had quite enough, and am in for just a few hours of &quot;wavy gravy&quot;, and this causes my mood to take a sharp dip, so weigh up taking a second tab…<br /><br />1340&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2nd 1200 mcg tab goes in. Change music to Alex Picone (Cadenza Cycle Podcast) to celebrate!<br /><br />Notes dry up now, but at 1504 I managed a shaky &quot;+++&quot;!<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I can recall. I got the feeling that &quot;this was a psychedelic that would teach you how to use psychedelics&quot;, and it was important I emptied my mind, and didn&#039;t force anything. I took lots of deep breaths, and with eyes wide open, emptied my mind, and my field of vision seemed to reset like an Etch-A-Sketch. The scene in front of me was replaced by a composite of many fractals, again not brilliantly coloured, or especially dynamic, but more than enough. Nothing was going haywire, but I was definitely not seeing the room anymore. Throughout this stage I felt very warm, happy &amp; relaxed. There were strong empathogenic sensations. The music (Mano Le Tough, Resident Advisor podcast) was phenomenal. There&#039;s a track early on (&quot;Nards&quot;) that has some looped dialogue: a man says &quot;Sir!&quot; (or possibly &quot;Sub!&quot; knowing the Berghain crowd…) and a woman whispers &quot;Geddup!&quot;. I&#039;ve never had the misfortune to be on the end of a policeman&#039;s boot, but I swear I felt like that was happening to me then, but I could see the funny side of it, and began laughing a lot. I&#039;m lying there, essentially catatonic/mesmerised, and an imaginary copper is trying to &quot;bring me round&quot;… The little narrative voice in my head was functioning clear and normal, and reassuring me that &quot;you&#039;re just tripping, this is what the trip is like&quot; but 25i is possibly one of those special substances that can sometimes cause you to &quot;forget&quot; you&#039;ve taken it…<br /><br />The other thing that now seemed to be occurring was some serious time dilation. The music was chugging away, measuring &quot;normal time&quot; and sounding normal, but there was so much going on in my real eyes and my minds&#039; eye, that time seemed to expand to allow me to try to take it all in. It&#039;s as if I was watching a film, running at 24 fps, and was now able to see each single frame presented in turn. I had the feeling of images (generated by the music) and memories (stirred by the images) all unravelling like rolls of old film. I could focus on any or all of it, but there was always more beyond, fractals unfolding again.<br /><br />I was barely aware of my body by now, and the &quot;narrator&quot; was wondering if this was what a &quot;fugue state&quot; felt like? It seemed similar in some ways to a K-hole, but with eyes open, and none of the &quot;roller coaster&quot; propulsion of a Hole. Music felt as good as it does in a good hole too.<br /><br />Like an old book, whose pages have become stuck together, I felt me/myself/my experiences peeling apart to be revealed/explored again, everything was accessible. The narrator didn&#039;t want to steer in any particular direction, but I was keenly aware of at least one memory I&#039;d never consciously recalled. I was small, it was snowing, my feet were cold in the slush, and I was pressed against the fake-fur of a woman&#039;s coat (my mum&#039;s?). It&#039;s so hard to explain, but a thought kept coming to me of &quot;time&#039;s velvet&quot; as if my entire past was now a deep soft velvet, that I could part and stroke anywhere. Layers of everything, and the special time progression enabled you to just get stuck in. It&#039;s really hard to explain, but was easy to grasp, although I think my mind&#039;s CPU/GPU were probably maxed out trying to keep up with all the extra frames/fractals, like running Flash on an old PC, I didn&#039;t crash tho… None of this felt dark or weird or intimidating, but I had to remind myself to take deep breaths every so often, and not try to steer the experience. Again, the empathic qualities flowed through everything, although if you&#039;re unlucky enough to have some dark memories locked away, you might want to exercise some caution, as you would with any other powerful psychedelic.<br /><br />I&#039;d say this peak state ran on for the best part of two hours, but it felt much longer, in a very good way. The come down was as smooth, warm and pleasant as the come up, the visuals splitting into clear CEV stuff &amp; undulating OEV distortions.<br /><br />Was fully down to baseline by around 2000. My gf was commented on how happy &amp; chilled out I seemed, which made me laugh, cos I like to think I&#039;m like that most of the time… The whole experience felt very clean and therapeutic, and I&#039;m already looking forward to my next dive in. I&#039;m writing this the day after, and enjoyed a great long deep sleep last night with no noticeable after effects.<br /><br />Heartfelt thanks to TD for an amazing product!<br /><br />Random observations for other new users: Time-dilation is awesome, but might prove a bit tough for some. This stuff packs some serious horsepower so I&#039;d be wary of using it outside of a &quot;controlled setting&quot;, initially at least. Sounds corny I know, but opening your mind and discarding any preconceptions is possibly more important with this stuff than for many other psychedelics. Personally, I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t have anybody else around &quot;distracting me&quot; on this occasion, and I was able to give myself fully over to it.<br /><br />

				@ GGA<br /><br />I have always enjoyed reading your trip reports, the level of detail and professionalism is truly enjoyable to see. As you said in your report, &quot;What I came to realise was that I could choose what I would feel&quot; that has been something I have worked with throughout my career as a psychonaut, that feelings, when on drugs or not, are choices. Subconscious or conscious, they can be controlled. Keep up the reports. I&#039;ll probably be posting one on here soon, as soon as I get my new Rega.

				CAUTION: This report contains descriptions some may find disturbing. They are included in the spirit of honesty. You might wish to skip parts of it...<br /><br />So, after another heavy 25i session with my gf yesterday, I wondered if I might be discovering some of the &quot;archetypes&quot; of the 25i hyperspace?<br /><br />The more I use it, the more I start to recognize phases/aspects of the experience, and how to operate within them. I think this also enables me to attach names to the concepts, and thus print them in memory to better recall them...<br /><br />We had been out for a good, relaxed all-night party. Got home early morning, having consumed nothing more than about 200mg of 6-APB each. This was my second time with this (her first) and I felt the experience had not delivered as much as I had hoped, but still, alert and in good mood.<br /><br />I had prepared 2.5 x 1200 ug tabs of 25i, in vodka, (24h soak) with 100 mg MXE, all dried back to a powder for insufflation.<br /><br />Crucially, as it turned out, this was 25% more 25i than we had used before in this combo (only 2 tabs). I offered to adjust the lines so she would likely only have 1200 ug, and I would have the &quot;extra&quot; but she declined this offer, and said she would have the same as me. 50/50 it was. Launched about 10.30 am.<br /><br />We quickly came into what I will now call the Euphoric Phase. We were still close enough to the launch point that we could comfortably recall how we had got there, yet everything was pleasantly strange. Basically, we could drill down a fractal path to occupy the smallest perceptible unit of time for the longest apparent time. I &quot;demonstrated&quot; this by asking her to notice how the music had apparently stopped, we laughed and chatted about the strange things we could do, and after a good while I said, look, we can go back now, and the music will come back too, which it suddenly did. The best analogy I can come up with is we went from looking at a forest, to inhabiting a single dew drop on the tip of a single pine needle, and back again. It was that shift in scale, but in time terms, not spatial terms.<br /><br />I gave her a bit of a talk about how things basically operated now, and how we could manipulate things. She later recalled that I looked like &quot;Aslan&quot; (from the Narnia movies) at this point. More handsome, chiselled, and with orbs of light dancing around my head. But she could not easily recall my &quot;explanation&quot;, possibly because she was not herself yet familiar with all the various concepts.<br /><br />I reckon we spent at least an hour in that phase, but it seemed to be much, much longer. A few days maybe in apparent time. Fractal paths were available in the present, and to the past and to the future. I felt we strongly we traveled together in various directions, happily, as our connection with the &quot;real world&quot; grew fainter and fainter until it had disappeared completely, i.e. ego death.<br /><br />Another effect now becoming apparent was &quot;haptic dissociation&quot; in other words, not only did things look different, but they felt different. At one point we were lying on a beach, in the surf. The couch felt like wet sand beneath my fingers, and my gf had wet hair, and sea-foam on her face, which I could feel as I wiped away. Visual transitions were occurring very rapidly now, and her face seemed to cycle between that of a very young child and a very old woman. <br /><br />Presumably, I was doing something similar, as she began to get quite agitated. She said she found the experience too much, and it was not what she had set out to do. I reminded her of all the events leading up to this point, explaining &quot;where we were&quot;, but this was of little consolation.<br /><br />She also began to act out something. As a young girl, she had experienced a couple of traumatic events, and although she has since told me of them, albeit with no specific details, she never told her mother or any other relative at the time they occurred. She now seemed to revert to one or other of these events, and relive the conversation, either as it actually occurred or as she wished it had occurred. She also seemed to conflate me with the (male) abuser. A lot of this seemed to come to me non-verbally, possibly even via telepathy or something. Very strange, but very powerful and potentially very useful. <br /><br />We had been through this process at least once before, a long time ago, so I felt a certain sense of familiarity with the situation. I hugged her, reassured her, and told her that she had wrongfully been burdened with the bad actions of another, and she was now free to cast the burden aside. It no longer had any place to remain with her. She was crying a lot now, and I think her inability to fully confront/examine whatever had occurred was preventing her from getting rid of it completely. Even in my state, I knew the potentially dangerous implications of embarking on any gonzo-therapy at this point, so I thought it was time to calm things down.<br /><br />Again, this stage seemed to go on forever, so much so that I wondered how long we had actually been &quot;in here&quot; now? She must have sensed this, and asked me that very question. Clearly a subconscious fear of mine manifested itself (the Rausing couple in London, one of whom lay deceased in a bedroom for a couple of months while the other continued on their crack binge…) and the room we were in suddenly seemed very old and dusty, dust particles shimmering in the light. <br /><br />My gf began to turn dark blue, and wither down to the skeleton, and as I looked at my hands, they were doing the same. I knew we were now entering some kind of &quot;voodoo parlour&quot; or &quot;charnel house&quot; phase. Her skull-like face called out to me &quot;Why are we here? We shouldn&#039;t be here! Help me!&quot;<br /><br />This was definitely a bit too much. I ran out of the room to get the downers, and returned pretty quickly with some 10mg diazepam. Leaving the room was sufficient to reset the horrific appearance it had when I left it, and things looked better, although still not great.<br /><br />I explained what the tablet was, and placed it in her mouth, but she protested that &quot;You think I&#039;m going mad don&#039;t you? This is why you want me to take this! You want to turn out my lights!&quot; I hugged her, reassured her, and slipped the pill onto her tongue, but it just hung there, stuck to her dry mouth. She began to laugh &quot;Swallow? Swallow? How can I swallow anything? I haven&#039;t even got a mouth any more!&quot;<br /><br />I removed the pill, and asked what she needed, and she said she needed to use the bathroom. The long journey to and from the bathroom was not easy, but did a lot of good. The change of scenery and glimpses of new yet familiar objects seemed to drain a lot of the energy from the trip, and when we returned to the couch, she had stopped crying and was able to sit up. A bird called outside, we both heard it, and that single chirrup was the most beautiful sign of reality starting to return.<br /><br />Slowly, the pieces started coming back together. It was about 3.30 PM (so T + 5h) when I could finally fix us something to drink, and sort some music out.<br /><br />We chatted about what had happened, and she said she was desperate to remember what &quot;it&quot; was, but I cautioned her that it was not good or safe to try and do that just yet, and certainly not without some professional guidance. <br /><br />She also struggled to recall much that had happened during the trip. Again, I think this is due to being still somewhat inexperienced, and easily overwhelmed, so things cannot be processed or labelled as they should to survive in memory.<br /><br />We were both very hungry now, so I fixed us something to eat, and that along with some funny TV allowed us to unwind slowly for the rest of the evening.<br /><br />By about 10, she said she was ready for bed, and would like to try half of the diazepam, to &quot;make sure&quot; she got to sleep. She took it, and lay with me on the couch for a further 30-45 mins. She became dozy, and when I suggested we go to bed, she woke with a start and said she had seen lots of &quot;weird stuff, like it was all having a last attempt to get out, but it was OK now.&quot; <br /><br />Observations:<br /><br />1. This shows how critical dosing is important with the Nbomes. My gf had a blissful experience with 1200 ug 25i insufflated, yet 1500 ug proved way too much. Myself, my max is 1200 ug 25i + 800 ug 25c simultaneously. That was full on, quite scary, but visually neutral (i.e. didn&#039;t see any bad things)<br /><br />2. If you&#039;re tripping as a couple or group, you&#039;re only really as strong as the weakest participant! Once one person starts losing their shit, it can be difficult for the other(s) to avoid following suit, especially on &quot;large&quot; doses. Alone, I&#039;m pretty bomb-proof, but auto-suggestion and feedback loops are easily picked up…<br /><br />3. Never thought I&#039;d say this but yes, a non-participating sitter would&#039;ve been highly welcome on that occasion. Would also have been fascinating to compare time-spans against a report….<br /><br />4. As far as I can tell, what 25i does is enable a hyperspace where normal time can be disregarded. This is utterly captivating, but potentially profoundly disorientating, especially at higher doses. It seems to alternate in waves between the generative i.e. stretching out/growing and the degenerative: shrinking, compressing etc. Fractal paths seem completely plausible. <br /><br />5. In addition, I have not encountered &quot;haptic dissociation&quot; with any other substance before. I thought this was actually called &quot;kinaesthesia&quot; but it&#039;s not, so that&#039;s my attempt at a label.<br /><br />6. It&#039;s important to point out that, as troubling as the skeletal images were, I understand why I saw them. WIth time zipping forwards and back, it was sort of inevitable. It was definitely not pleasant, and my sanity was probably straining at that point, but I can look back on them with equanimity. Many psychedelic experiences enable us to face or rehearse death, and I think this is a powerful benefit. In a weird way I almost feel &quot;fearless&quot; now, after that ordeal. But at the same time, I would not wish it on the new, nervous or inexperienced, so go easy kids!<br /><br />7. The 5 hours definitely seemed to encompass several days. I wondered at the time whether the skeletal phase was because we had apparently gone days without eating. <br /><br />8. Has it put us both off Nbomes? Not at all. We&#039;ll have a bit of a break, and re-enter a bit lower down the slopes. Can see why some people think they&#039;re a bit dark though. The dose/response curve seems more exponential than linear, in other words 2x the amount may give you 4x the effects…<br /><br />9. Need to revisit LSD! Only had some weak stuff years ago, wasn&#039;t too impressed. Now that fine specimens available here, feel like a fresh comparison of the two realms would be useful.<br /><br />10. Had a tiny amount of DMT the next day, about 30mg. Absolutely stunning, had forgotten how beautiful that can be. Shimmering stillness over everything, practically orgasming with blissful feelings. And only 15 minutes long! <br /><br />11. Haven&#039;t had a cigarette in the two days since! Seems like something may have gotten reset along the way ;-))<br />

You have strong visuals but they feel sort of fake and are no where near as fascinating as the ones from traditional psyches. Whereas on LSD or mushrooms I feel &quot;smarter&quot; because my mind is moving faster / using more of it, I feel more stupid on 25i and I think I am using less of it. I felt numbed. <br /><br />I tried it 3-4 times and concluded that there is absolutely no reason to take it, especially when you have excellent LSD and mushrooms on hand. But really I would honestly rather just stay sober than dose 25i. It provides no &quot;insights,&quot; which is what I look for more than the visuals, which is all that 25i is.<br /><br />A good report though, yoshitoshi.<br /><br />I totally agree about only being as strong as the weakest participant. Because of this, I like to trip alone because when with a group I am frankly almost always the &quot;strongest&quot; participant, so I can go &quot;furthest&quot; solo.<br /><br />About dosage being critical, I would advise that 25i is notorious for having uneven dosages, so it is possible that you actually took a bigger/smaller dose than you thought. The powder in the capsules provides a better, albeit shorter, experience IMO, but they are also more accurately dosed, than blotters, and I haven&#039;t tried liquid, but from what I know, the 25i chemical is not quite stable in liquid and this is the worst for inaccurate dosage.&nbsp;

But with 25i I felt like all it&#039;s effects could be found within the LSD experience, which has so much more to offer. That said I actually forgot about when I combined 3mg of 25-i with 4g mushrooms or so. It was a fucking good time. The visuals were nuts. Everything I looked at was moving so much from the mushrooms and the 25i gave it huge tracers. I was in the car with a friend who was driving and it felt like I was in Tron. The street-lights stretched all the way past my vision. It turned single sources if light into &quot;bars&quot; of light or lasers. And this guys car is low to the ground and his front seats are closer to the from of the car than usual, so looking out at the road, it felt like I was gliding at car speed. That ride was a roller coaster. <br /><br />I did a similar dose of both another time and it was equally thrilling.<br /><br />So yeah, 25-i on it&#039;s own was underwhelming / boring to me, but I may try to combine it again sometime to mix it up, mostly to &quot;enhance&quot; the visuals. It did something different than what LSD does when combined with shrooms (which I LOVE).

In fact, I&#039;m sure I did this with shrooms at some point, hitting up some &quot;Thai&quot; for the pretty lights, or maybe some Mexican, and only occasionally going the full-on (&quot;Hawaiian&quot;, heavier dose) soul quest.<br /><br />May have to give the 25i a try. I&#039;m happy, to a point, to play the psychonaut footsoldier - I prefer explorer - charting unknown lands, but 25c felt like it was a matter of time till it did me harm.

So, if you just have a gram then try the 300mg first and then 700mg or just take the whole gram at once. I don&#039;t think there is any danger.

				I tried mescaline a couple of times around 9 or 10 years ago.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t tell you the actual dosage: I bought pre-measured gel caps, and my dealer warned me to only take one at a time.&nbsp; I felt very playful and saw rainbows everywhere, but at the end felt like I came up empty (as GSE said).&nbsp; I wished I had taken both caps together.&nbsp; I should try this again sometime, but I&#039;m out of budget for drugs at the mo.<br /><br />@GSE: One thing that totally confounds me is people talking about having sex (or masturbating) while on LSD and other psychedelics.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of talk of this on the Avengers thread, but I fail to understand how it is even remotely possible---let alone tempting---in that state (for males, that is).&nbsp; On the one hand, I want to say you&#039;re incredibly lucky to have the option, and on the other, it seems like you spent a lot of this trip obsessing about sex ... of course, I can&#039;t actually say you missed out on anything else because of it, but all the same, I don&#039;t fancy the notion of spending my tripping hours watching porn (for example).&nbsp; In any case, thanks for the report.

				Specifically: my bollocks retract entirely up into my body and my cock does its best to do this too.&nbsp; My genitals are quite simply closed for business on a full dose of any psychedelic.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible this could be reversed by adding MDMA to the mix, but I don&#039;t take amphetamines.&nbsp; Because my modus operandi on psychedelic trips is complete deconstruction and ego death, sex is not too compatible with the mental side either ... but that much is a choice, and I would be willing to try it if it weren&#039;t for the physical obstructions.

				tried 3 weeks ago my first DMT and i have to say it has been the experience i was looking for all that time<br />I&#039;ve been using various drugs for about 8 years now <br />but i never had that &#039;entering in another world&#039; expirience i was looking for when i took psychedelics.<br />..well maybe ketamine came close regarding the bodiless feeling.<br /><br />so i ordered 100mg from &#039;digne merces labore&#039; and it seemed like very clean lab dmt. (the white type)<br />after researching various types of techniques for smoking i decided to go for the bottle method&nbsp; and it seemed to work perfectly for me.<br /><br />&#039;http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/661304-Smoking-DMT-the-Bottle-method&#039;<br /><br />at the first go with 30mg i was kinda overexcited and too less chilled.. the taste was pretty strange/ugly.<br />the dmt kicked in after about 3 seconds i had it in my lungs. i was kinda shocked from the kick and released the smoke way to early and the trip wasnt really a breakthrough since i was still fighting against it.<br /><br />the second and third go was all i could wish for&nbsp; :)<br />it was the same day in the evening, put up some ravi shankar &amp; tabla sound, lighted up some aroma sent stuff my girlfriend brought from india and was chilled &amp; ready to go.<br />the first toke (20mg) i took out of the bottle was a pretty small one and i didnt break through. Still.. it was very pleasant and it got me ready for hyperspace.<br />the second toke (30mg + some remained from the previous toke) was the best dmt trip i got so far, i&#039;ve never experienced such beautiful/strong visuals! heavy colored beautiful complex patterns, but then again also light colored cloud similar colors in black background. i was in another world! finally! all the lsd, meskaline, shroom trips i was looking for a breakthrough like that but imo those substances interact with reality that surrounds you. DMT on the other hand kicks you into hyperspace regardless of the surrounding.<br /><br />the third toke was pretty much the same, maybe a tiny bit lighter, but still very euphoric and interesting.<br />after this intense experience i was lying in bed awake for 1-2 hours, totally overwhelmed and touched to tears.<br /><br />DMT is one of my new fav. drugs&nbsp; :) done some research and i think I&#039;m going to try DMT orally (possible thanks to MAO - inhibitors) for a longer trip. <br />but be aware that MAO - inhibitor can be toxic, special diet is needed!!<br /><br />I&#039;m very curious about combinations like Lsd + Dmt while peaking <br />or Ketaminte + Dmt while going down the K-hole.<br /><br />great experiences ahead&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />cheers minchia<br />

				Minchia, have you met any of the hyperspace entities yet?<br /><br />I think we&#039;re about at the same point, I&#039;ve been giving some thought to utilizing MAOIs.

But there will be more tolerance issues with LSD then LSD than LSD then shrooms or vice versa. But really unless you&#039;re planning or going to a festival or something similar it&#039;s best to wait at least a week, but two weeks to be back to baseline.

				Well guys here is my trip report from my first time ever tripping.<br /><br />Drug: 3.5gs of PE shrooms from a friend<br />Setting: Awesome zoo<br />Duration: Aprox 12 hours<br /><br />This was my first trip report ever written so sorry if it&#039;s hard to follow.<br />__________________________________________________________<br /><br />My first experience eating psychedelic mushrooms was quite an experience. I felt like I needed to document it when it was still somewhat fresh in my head. Before I get into my trip I would like to say I went into this trip “blind.” Before taking mushrooms the only thing I really knew about them was you get visuals, I knew nothing about losing reality, how confusing things could be, the concept of ego death and how powerful this drug really is. <br />Me and one of my buddies decided we were going to trip shrooms. He was a somewhat experienced tripper and this was my first trip. I didn’t tell him it was my first trip, and I still don’t know why, and he planned everything out. He thought I had tripped before. I took an eighth all at once and chewed them up as much as I could. According to him they were the most potent shrooms he had eaten. (Now I know they were Penis Envy shrooms) After about 30 minutes I became very nauseas and almost threw up. We smoked a few bowls on the way to the zoo and then when I stepped out of the truck it hit me like a ton of bricks. All of a sudden I felt euphoria. I felt the most amazing feeling my body has every experienced, just standing outside felt amazing. It was like the second I stepped out of the truck I stepped into a new world for me. I saw the world in a new light. I felt like I could see the sunlight travel all the way from space and then kiss my skin. We were in the parking lot of Audubon zoo in New Orleans when I got my first visuals off of this beautiful young ladies shirt, just some spiraling and breathing and I thought that’s cool so this is tripping.&nbsp; They were asking us for directions, I held the conversation, but I felt myself slipping. I saw these crows flying in the distance behind them and I saw that the birds just seemed to be flying differently than I’ve ever seen before. (Now I realize I was tracing hard as fuck)<br /><br />We then went and bought tickets and went into the zoo. At this point I felt like I could not stop walking. I instantly began to peak. I was getting amazing visuals off of everything I looked at. The zoo was very well done and there were stone carvings and all kind of already interesting things that just intensified my trip. After about what seemed like hours the zoo sent me off into my own world. As I was walking through the trails and paths the trees and vines would follow me and swirl as I walked. My friends that were with me were gone and only their voices would affect my trip. The zoo began to turn against me. The sounds of all of the animals began to get to me and I thought that the animals were all free inside the zoo, but I couldn’t remember we were at a zoo, all I could think was how did I get here, where am I, and why are these people so close to these huge elephants! As I walked through exhibits I felt as though I was walking through plains in Africa.&nbsp; Every animal I looked at appeared to be some crazy mutant of what it really was. I couldn’t look at them for more than a second without getting scared. I remember stopping to buy a bottle of water, I knew that when I got up there I would have to pay her, but I went blank. What seemed like hours later I remember seeing a water bottle in my hand and it appeared to me misshaped and ‘melting.’ <br /><br />I finally made it out of the zoo, which was a challenge in itself, and was walking back to my friend’s truck when things got crazy. Cars were disappearing in the parking lot my friends seemed to be teleporting all over the parking lot, my depth perception was completely gone.&nbsp; I remember not being able to open the door of the truck because the truck kept moving. (it was parked) I remember repeatedly getting into the passenger’s seat and then the back seat, because I was confused on where I was supposed to be. I remember my friends saying “What are you doing” and it would register so late in my mind. I felt like I could not stop walking and I was so confused on why I couldn’t stop and why I couldn’t remember where I came from. I felt like every time I stopped everything became way too intense and I could not control it and would get scared. I remember at one point I simply asked “where are we going” and my friend said “I don’t know, we just need to keep walking” In my head this fucked me up for some reason. In my head this made me think the whole world was just a bunch of people walking to endlessness, if that makes any sense. At this point I was in what I describe as a cartoon world. Nothing reminded me of reality, I was no longer on earth. <br /><br />We then walked over to the fly to watch the sun go down over the Mississippi river and according to my friends I stood on the train tracks without moving or saying a word for about 5 minutes. I finally made it to the river and I looked down at the rocks and the trash and it seemed as though I witnessed the rocks age over millions of years within just a few seconds. I saw them detererate and wither away. I looked up at the river and the sun was giving me amazing visuals and I saw the ships strangely float down the river. After they made it all the way past me they seemed to reset and skip back to where they started at. I want to say I remember everything around me disappearing and then all of a sudden instead of south Louisiana I was on top of a mountain looking at how beautiful the world is. After this point I did not remember much of everything. There were a couple hundred people at the fly (it was a popular place to hang out on weekends, people drink, bbq, smoke bud, trip whatever hah) and everyone I looked at I would see a past version of someone in my life. I was looking at people and seeing my friends, my family, but at different periods of time. Like I would see my friends, but a 5 year old version of them, and everyone was staring at me, everyone. This completely fucked my head up. I started to think, “is this death?”<br /><br />&nbsp;Apparently we were walking back to the truck and all my friends stopped and I continued to walk and would not respond. They had to physically put me in the truck to leave. I have no recollection of this. This is when my mostly nice enjoyable trip turned for the absolute worst. They put me in the backseat of an extended cab truck. I then felt as if the truck was morphing and molding around me and then I saw the truck age over millions of years. I then began to think that I had died and I was in the afterlife. I was stuck in this endless loop. I was visualizing my entire future, but I was stuck in a trip. Everything began to repeat and I thought this was what happened after I died. I was stuck watching my life play out, it seemed like an answer to what the afterlife was. So seeing this happen got me thinking that maybe I am in the afterlife and just watching the world until it ends. I then laid down in the back and I was ‘hallucinating’ that we were running over pedestrians and killed people and cops were trying to get us. (I later realized I thought this because my trip sitter was talking about cops and that stuck in my head) Since I thought I was dead and laid in the backseat and literally watched my life flash before me. I thought that was death. I thought death was sitting in a universe alone just watching your life happen. <br />Then the most confusing/remarkable thing happened to me. I saw my dead grandmother and held her hand. This has me thinking about it every day. It had me truly convinced I had died. It was a very scary experience, but I am still happy with what happened. I didn’t know who I was for the longest time and it scared me. I didn’t know who I was, who was I to become. It was a very scary experience. <br /><br />According to my friends the whole time I was in the backseat, about 4 hours, I was crying, speaking gibberish and eating magazine paper. The whole time I was back there my eyes were closed and everything was closed eyed visuals. I freaked out and punched both of them and tried to jump out the window, we were parked. I then threw my scale, my friend’s hookah base, and a few other things, breaking them all. I believe I did all of this in confusion because it was the first time I snapped out of it after I had accepted the fact I had died. Life is really different once you feel like you have truly accepted death. Then after all of that I was conscience of my surroundings and was still getting visuals and I calmed down for some reason I was convinced that the earth and everyone on it was a figment of my imagination and that when I woke up I was in my next life yet still in the same form. I was very confused and it took me about another two hours to completely come back to reality and understand everything that happened. The whole experience was about 11 hours, peaking for about 8 of them. <br /><br /><br /><br />Edited for paragraphs, fucked up copy and paste

I had not taken any psychedelics for the past 22 days. <br /><br />Time: 6:00 PM<br />Dose: 4 mayan calandars<br />Vendor: albionessentialols<br /><br />After taking them, I began to finish up some things I needed done and my friend, who ate 5 yellow gandalfs from jerseycow helped me out. This lasted until I began to feel them faintly, which was after about a half hour. We then began to walk around my backyard aimlessly, just talking, until tracers began forming and the LSD began seeping into my mind nicely. We then laid down in some outdoor lounge chairs, which I felt like I was melting nicely into. My muscles began to glow warm and euphorically – it felt too good to move. I took in the sights of the tree’s – which looked oddly pointy and blocky, like green confetti – and the sky, which was full of clouds that were flying by at an abnormal speed. They looked more like objects than normal, but nothing to speak about. At about T+1:15, I was keenly aware of very detailed fractals that filled my vision. <br /><br />A bit later, we went back inside, mostly because we wanted to hear some music, and settled on playing some ping pong, as the immobilizing aspect of the come-up had mostly worn off. The games were very close – they usually are on acid – and we were thoroughly enjoying ourselves at this point. It’s worth noting that inside was more a wash of colors vs. the splintered fractals of outside. The breathing of everything was much more noticeable. <br /><br />We then lounged inside and talked about our pasts and futures and perceptions, etc., while listening to good music. Putting thoughts to words was a challenge at times, but nothing out of the ordinary for a large dose. <br /><br />At about T+4:00, we began to have an impromptu exercise session, which felt very, very good. After the grogginess of the come-up wears off, I am always left extremely nimble and full of energy. Putting this energy to use was quite pleasurable. <br /><br />At T+4:45, we went outside, where there was a thunder and lightning storm happening without rain. It was quite the event for us. We laid on my back patio and stared straight up. The sky was kind of glowing from behind the clouds. I assume it would have been a very bright night if it wasn’t so cloudy. At first as I looked up I could see a rainbow colored chain link spread circularly across the sky. This is a staple of the visual aspect of a high dose LSD trip for me. It flowed around and changed shape and color before turning into a swirl of 60’s acid inspired type graffiti writing written in the sky. I could not read what it said, but it was fascinating. This then began to turn into a very, very vivid mayan (or other south American native) art display. It was fully detailed and constantly moving across my field of vision. This lasted for quite a bit of time, and I was blown away. <br /><br />Sometime later, we went for a walk 10 minute walk down the street and a surge would run through me after each time lightning would strike in the distance and the entire world would light up. It was invigorating. <br /><br />We then went back inside and watched some of Mr. Show, which I had previously watched the last time had taken acid. The humor of that show matches LSD quite well. It’s a great show, and terrific fun on LSD. <br /><br />At T+8:15, my friend decided to go to bed after giving two thumbs up for the yellow gandalfs. As I was going to my bed, I saw that the storm was full on now, and decided that I was not quite tired and sat out on my front porch. Here I reflected on the decisions I had made the last few weeks and whether they were the right ones. Heavy rain always soothes me and did so here and the thunder and lightning added some theatrics. Being somewhat outside myself, the objectivity came very easily, and the reflection will likely prove to be life-enhancing. <br /><br />These tabs are top notch and took me on a visually packed and mentally and emotionally fulfilling experience. <br /><br />Thanks albion. Thanks SR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I had not taken any psychedelics for the past 22 days. <br /><br />Time: 6:00 PM<br />Dose: 4 mayan calandars<br />Vendor: albionessentialols<br /><br />After taking them, I began to finish up some things I needed done and my friend, who ate 5 yellow gandalfs from jerseycow helped me out. This lasted until I began to feel them faintly, which was after about a half hour. We then began to walk around my backyard aimlessly, just talking, until tracers began forming and the LSD began seeping into my mind nicely. We then laid down in some outdoor lounge chairs, which I felt like I was melting nicely into. My muscles began to glow warm and euphorically – it felt too good to move. I took in the sights of the tree’s – which looked oddly pointy and blocky, like green confetti – and the sky, which was full of clouds that were flying by at an abnormal speed. They looked more like objects than normal, but nothing to speak about. At about T+1:15, I was keenly aware of very detailed fractals that filled my vision. <br /><br />A bit later, we went back inside, mostly because we wanted to hear some music, and settled on playing some ping pong, as the immobilizing aspect of the come-up had mostly worn off. The games were very close – they usually are on acid – and we were thoroughly enjoying ourselves at this point. It’s worth noting that inside was more a wash of colors vs. the splintered fractals of outside. The breathing of everything was much more noticeable. <br /><br />We then lounged inside and talked about our pasts and futures and perceptions, etc., while listening to good music. Putting thoughts to words was a challenge at times, but nothing out of the ordinary for a large dose. <br /><br />At about T+4:00, we began to have an impromptu exercise session, which felt very, very good. After the grogginess of the come-up wears off, I am always left extremely nimble and full of energy. Putting this energy to use was quite pleasurable. <br /><br />At T+4:45, we went outside, where there was a thunder and lightning storm happening without rain. It was quite the event for us. We laid on my back patio and stared straight up. The sky was kind of glowing from behind the clouds. I assume it would have been a very bright night if it wasn’t so cloudy. At first as I looked up I could see a rainbow colored chain link spread circularly across the sky. This is a staple of the visual aspect of a high dose LSD trip for me. It flowed around and changed shape and color before turning into a swirl of 60’s acid inspired type graffiti writing written in the sky. I could not read what it said, but it was fascinating. This then began to turn into a very, very vivid mayan (or other south American native) art display. It was fully detailed and constantly moving across my field of vision. This lasted for quite a bit of time, and I was blown away. <br /><br />Sometime later, we went for a walk 10 minute walk down the street and a surge would run through me after each time lightning would strike in the distance and the entire world would light up. It was invigorating. <br /><br />We then went back inside and watched some of Mr. Show, which I had previously watched the last time had taken acid. The humor of that show matches LSD quite well. It’s a great show, and terrific fun on LSD. <br /><br />At T+8:15, my friend decided to go to bed after giving two thumbs up for the yellow gandalfs. As I was going to my bed, I saw that the storm was full on now, and decided that I was not quite tired and sat out on my front porch. Here I reflected on the decisions I had made the last few weeks and whether they were the right ones. Heavy rain always soothes me and did so here and the thunder and lightning added some theatrics. Being somewhat outside myself, the objectivity came very easily, and the reflection will likely prove to be life-enhancing. <br /><br />These tabs are top notch and took me on a visually packed and mentally and emotionally fulfilling experience. <br /><br />Thanks albion. Thanks SR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Awesome trip report man! I would absolutely love to watch a rainless lighting storm wile tripping. I feel like that would just blow me away.<br /><br />My next trip, I&#039;m pretty sure, is going to be 2 of tessellated&#039;s tabs and sharing an eighth of shrooms with two or three people. The setting is going to be the beach at night. <br /><br />I feel like the &#039;endlessness&#039; of the waves will be awesome and soothing, but I&#039;m wondering if the beach will get somewhat boring. I mean all that is out there is sand and water and maybe a pier or two. I like experiencing new things during my trips. Anybody have some input on night tripping at the beach? I think it will be a good place to really get lost in my own head, but I still love getting intense visuals from trees, landscape, and even just indoors.

				Hey everyone, I&#039;m coming off SSRI&#039;s shortly and was wondering how long it takes for it to leave your system so that I can take acid again with full effects?&nbsp; Would it be a matter of days or weeks?&nbsp; And the same question for MDMA, how long do I need to be off SSRI&#039;s to be safer from serotonin syndrome when taking MDMA?

				I posted this on SR already, but I wanted to post it here too.<br /><br />The Sands of Time<br /><br />Duration: 12 Hours<br />Dose: 2 200µg Tessellated tabs<br />Setting: Beach at night with two friends, both on same dose. <br /><br />7:30: Arrived at the beach, weather isn’t looking too good. We decided; fuck it we drove out here. Dropped two tabs and brought our chairs out to the beach. It started raining a little bit, but we just stayed out there. The rain eventually stopped, but there were storm clouds everywhere. My two other friends were messing around digging holes in the sand with their feet, and for whatever reason it turned into a competition between them. We didn’t know that it would be an important part of our trip. I started feeling a tingle in my balls, I’m going to be tripping soon. <br /><br />8:15: Definitely tripping pretty hard already. I am leaning back in my chair watching the clouds turn and dance, like a kaleidoscope. Sun is going down and we are just enjoying the weather.<br /><br />8:15-11:00: All I can say is that I will never be able to experience what I experienced this night again, everything worked out as perfectly as it could have. Everywhere but where we were was storming. Every direction we looked there was lightning bolting across the sky. The sky was clear above us and the stars were bright. Mother Nature put on a show for us. We just continued to talk and stare in awe at the weather and the stars. By this time my friends gave up on their competition and decided to break down the wall between their ‘holes’ and make one big pit so I could fit in there with them. Once we were all in our hole that we dubbed, the trippy pit, I put on my pink Floyd playlist and just kept watching the lighting. At times the lighting would work in perfect sync with the music. It was the most amazing experience of my life. By this time I was peaking extremely hard and I texted this word for word to my other friend who was supposed to come.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dude. You must come. I’m experiencing pure beauty right now. I’m being kissed by Mother Nature. God is putting on a show for us. When that movie ends, come. It will be the best decision of your life. With love, *****”<br /><br />I have no clue how he didn’t show up after getting a text like that. Hahah. I know I definitely would have come. I remember closing my eyes for a while and I had some of the most elaborate, unexplainable, beautiful CEVs I’ve ever seen. It made me want to become an artist, but then I remembered I suck at art haha. <br /><br />11:00-2:00: I remembered I bought a shitload of glow sticks, time to bust them out. I had five packs of glow sticks, each pack a different color with three in each. My buddy had three big ones each a different color. We cracked all of them open and just played with them for a little while running around watching the amazing colorful traces. I felt like I was in Tron. Then we decided to stick all of them in the sand in our ‘trippy pit’ and I cannot even begin to explain how cool the glow mixed with the texture of the sand was. It was the weirdest visuals I’ve gotten yet. Then I came up with an idea, a brilliant one I must add. I ran and grabbed my knife and started cutting the glow sticks open. Then we all took a different color and began to splatter them on the sand inside of our pit. It looked as though we were throwing stars and galaxies on the ground at our feet. It was amazing. After coloring our pit with space we looked back up to see that some clouds had passed and the real stars were back out. Since I was staring at our glowing pit for so long, when I looked up at the stars they were all different psychedelic colors. Purples, oranges, blues, reds, it was crazy. <br /><br />2:00-5:00: We decided to go get our towels and lie in our pit and look up into space. It was amazing. It looked as though I was just lying in space and I was on the same level as the stars. For most of this time we talked about life, death, religion, society, friends, happiness, drugs, and about how this is the purest cleanest acid we’ve ever had. During this time I took a little walk down the beach to think about my life and the direction I am headed. I got a good bit of thinking in, but I was still tripping pretty hard so I couldn’t concentrate for too long before my mind drifted away to something else. <br /><br />5:00-6:00 We are beginning the come down and it was very smooth and gentle. We just sat in our lawn chairs and talked as we watched the sun come up along the coast. I am still getting slight visuals and pretty elaborate closed eyed visuals. <br /><br />6:00-7:00 Drive home. Very relaxing visuals are starting to fade out completely besides when I try to read. Stopped to get a big breakfast at a diner and then headed back to my buddies house.<br /><br />7:00-8:00 Trying to sleep, when I closed my eyes the weirdest thing happened to me. It seemed as though I watched my trip play through my head in super fast forward, but I could also hear things that my friends had said during the trip for me. I finally faded away to sleep ending the most amazing night of my life.<br /><br />I am planning on adding more details to this trip report but I wanted to write up a quick one when everything was somewhat fresh in my head. In the end this is the best LSD I’ve ever had and me and my friends are planning to stock up on a lot very soon. So Tess, I’ll be back! <br /><br />I think if I would have tried to go in public where people were two tabs might have been too much, but this is some good shit. If you are looking for a ‘mild’ trip, one tab is definitely enough . And I learned that you can never have enough glow sticks haha. Happy tripping. <br />

I have felt something of the sort. Sometimes when I am tripping on a higher dose, I feel as if my body is somehow useless because I don&#039;t need it for anything in that moment. This makes me think of it as something that I just drag along with me (like a hammer or cell phone) just to accomplish some dull task. It really makes me feel like more than just a flow of thoughts in a brain in a body. But I can&#039;t rightly say it&#039;s anything more than a feeling. <br /><br />Also, sorry for the lateness of the response. I&#039;ve been really busy the last few days.

				Ok, here&#039;s my first DMT experience:<br /><br />I was sitting on my bed, bored as crap, right? Sitting there with my pipe smoking weed, typing up on the computer, just relaxing. I wanted to do something. So I decided to try some of the DMT I bought earlier. I&#039;ve never been very successful with it, and I&#039;ve only seen minor changes in wall-texture, but this time... this time.<br /><br />I loaded the pipe and held my lighter below. The lights were off, and Lord of the Rings was looping, as it usually does in my room. I put a good amount in. I&#039;m not sure, I didn&#039;t measure it. It was probably too much considering... but think of it as about the amount that would fit on the end of a little potato peeler. That&#039;s what I used to fill my pipe. I didn&#039;t completely fill up the &quot;scoop&quot;, I just took a couple chunks and dropped &#039;em in.<br /><br />As the vapor started to form, I was really liking the way the pipe lit up with the fire beneath. I was hoping for a great time. I was in a good mood, yeah I was in pain, but I&#039;m always in pain. So I took that picture in, the billowing vapor clouds zipping into my lungs through that freebase pipe. I laid back and held it in for a good 20 or more seconds. As the time passed, I saw patterns on the wall changing, morphing. The blinds covering my window seemed to breathe, and I had never experienced that before. It REALLY seems like breathing, for anyone curious about it. (Look at your stomach. Suck it in and push out. That&#039;s what it looks like... real breathing. It&#039;s weird).<br /><br />From the breathing came tendrils of light that was reflected through the blinds. It was night time, but there are lights outside, so there were shadows. At first the light seemed to morph, but it quickly turned bad. To the shadows.<br /><br />The shadows started to turn into monster-like creatures and I knew that I was definitely NOT in the right setting (clearly I was a fucking retard for doing this in the dark). I had no idea it could be like this, I thought what I was getting was &quot;about it&quot;. Boy was I wrong, and I was NOT prepared for it. The monsters swooped around my face, the character&#039;s faces on the TV kept swirling, sounds seemed VERY psychedelic (it&#039;s crazy how well people interpret the hallucinogenic experience in music and art) and colors did too. It was INSANE, and I was NOT prepared for it. It immediately turned bad. I was absolutely terrified. I thought to myself, &quot;What is going on? Wow. I can&#039;t believe DMT is like this. I must turn the light on. I have to fight away these shadows.&quot; Turning the light on helped, and looking back on it, I can&#039;t exactly remember how felt once the light went on... I know it didn&#039;t turn good. I sat there heaving, taking controlled breaths and hoping for it all to end. But you see, I think I only felt BAD because of the panic, which only amplified the bad I was feeling from the harshness of the smoke settling into my lungs. <br /><br />When I finally came to and the DMT wore off, I was thinking, &quot;Wow, DMT is insane.&quot; And it is... for real. I was totally unprepared for it. It picked me up, took me off, and I was held in its grasp for a good ten minutes. It seemed to go by rather quickly though, at least. Thankfully. It could&#039;ve been hellish.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t used it since. I&#039;m a bit scared to.<br /><br />

				@iLoveTaffy: DMT in the wrong setting can be quite a shock to the system. What I would recommend is in your room, with the lights dimmed down so you can barely see, but it&#039;s not absolutely dark, and with all interferences quelled. That last one is most important. Turn the tv and everything else off. I&#039;d recommend going with silence until you are experienced enough to experiment with music, and even then it should be very soft. <br /><br />Take your hits, set down the pipe, lay back in your bed, and close your eyes.

The &quot;noise&quot; you are speaking of is visual snow and is a very common attribute to HPPD. If you go to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hppd) they have a couple examples of what this looks like. <br /><br />What makes me think that this isn&#039;t HPPD is a few things:<br />-It occurred 8 days later instead of immediately after.<br />-It included paranoia and breathing of objects, which are not typically involved in traditional HPPD. <br />-You are normal now. <br /><br />I have never had an LSD flashback and no one I have spoken to has (many, many people, with many years experience), therefore I have assumed that they were propaganda. But this 25i could be different. It&#039;s really hard to answer your question.

				I was wondering about 25i vs. LSD-25. I heard that Nbomes are dangerous and can kill you. LSD, on the other hand, is supposed to be one of the safest drugs (toxicity wise) and overdosing near impossible. Then there&#039;s shrooms, which I&#039;ve heard pretty much the same thing about.<br /><br />If that&#039;s true, I&#039;m going to stick to LSD and shrooms. Can anyone shed any light on this for me?<br />

				Slade, you&#039;d have to take a LOT in order to kill yourself, so I wouldn&#039;t worry. You&#039;re not going to die off of one tab, man.<br /><br />Speaking of, I just used LSD last night. I wish you could use multiple days in a row. In two weeks or so, when I use it next, I&#039;m going to take three times instead of one and taking in the afternoon so I can go outside without freaking myself out in the dark, haha.<br /><br /><br />Also, just had some LSD last night and I had a pretty good time. I think I&#039;m going to try three tabs next time, though. I&#039;ll brave it out.

I heard that Nbomes are dangerous and can kill you. LSD, on the other hand, is supposed to be one of the safest drugs (toxicity wise) and overdosing near impossible. Then there&#039;s shrooms, which I&#039;ve heard pretty much the same thing about.<br /><br />If that&#039;s true, I&#039;m going to stick to LSD and shrooms. Can anyone shed any light on this for me?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Toxicity: The toxicity for LSD and mushrooms are both so high that it isn&#039;t known with any accuracy what dose would be fatal. There have been confirmed reports of people taking 250mg and being fine and according to chinacat72 (the thumbprint storyteller) a person he knew took a gram and was fine after. <br /><br />25i on the other hand has for certain a toxicity that is much, much lower but again, not quite pinned down. Fatal overdoses are thought to be from badly laid blotter / liquid where the actual dose is exponentially more than the advertised dose, mostly because since it has such a low cost, amateurs are able to distribute it. I have heard people say that as low as 5mg and as high as 25mg is the overdose point (nonfatal, but od nontheless). <br /><br />Personally, in my 5 experiences with 25i-NBOMe (compared to hundreds and hundreds of LSD/shrooms experiences)&nbsp; the most I took was 3mg. I just felt like it gave me fake-ish visuals that felt like plastic, and the body high and universal connection due to reduced ego were completely absent. I personally like the effects from traditional psychedelics more. I felt that (and this is a totally subjective call) that 25i was doing more harm to my neurological system than all other psychedelics. I felt stupid while I was on it, compared to how I feel brilliant on LSD or mushrooms or mescaline. <br /><br />The only experience that I enjoyed enough to recreate was when I took 4.5g of cubensis mushrooms and 2mg of 25i. That was a very fun night mostly because all the 25i did was enhance the mushrooms visuals. A sober friend was driving us around and the street lamps light stretched on 50 ft. It felt like I was in tron, speeding along, burning a glowing path in our wake. It could be noted that it changed the trip differently than adding LSD to shrooms did. <br /><br />So, in summation, I personally would not take 25i for anything other than a trip enhancer, and even then, only sparingly. <br /><br />DMTisinME

				DReaMensioN&#039;s LSD is great too. I used one tab, 160mcg, and it was fantastic. I&#039;m going to use three next time. It&#039;s a bit on the pricey side, though. 4 tabs for $80.

				I have a question....<br /><br />If I had a 160mcg blotter the other day nd enjoyed it with some woven colers, EXTREMELY uncontrollable laughter (that was weird, something I&#039;d read or see on a show would cause me to CRACK UP), but nothing more, do you think taking 3 blotters would be better next time? Considering that last time was my first time doing LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;m just worried that I&#039;ll end up outside of my head and not be able to control myself if I see spiders all over my skin or something.... I DO have Valium....<br /><br />Would it be smart to take 5-10mg Valium BEFORE tripping, or would that just lessen it?

Thus, you are experiencing a different &quot;reality&quot; on a higher dose of certain psychoactive chemicals. <br /><br />Do you think your interpretation changes on a moment to moment basic, if only minutely? <br /><br />Edit: and +1 to each GGA and GSE.

I&#039;ve talked about this elsewhere before, and I won&#039;t get into that aspect of it here.<br /><br />I am also a monist ... but for me, the one thing that exists is spirit.&nbsp; The physical is entirely a consequence of the mind, not the other way around.&nbsp; Of course this is not entirely accurate either, I inflect my understanding this way as a way of pointing out the flaws in what&#039;s generally believed.&nbsp; What is actually true is that the entire notion of causality as we understand it is bunk.&nbsp; The physical and spiritual are mutually consequences of one another.&nbsp; However, if one is going to favour one or the other, I find thinking of the mind as primal and the physical as secondary to be a much richer and fuller way to interpret the world.<br /><br />I have an entire semi-comical spiel I could launch into at this point ... but I won&#039;t, because I have plans to perform it in person as a monologue later.&nbsp; What I will say is that every conceivable moment exists &#039;simultaneously&#039; as it were.&nbsp; The fact that we are able to step from moment to moment, forging a continuous chronology from these fragmentary moments is literally magical.&nbsp; And yes, we do become entirely different people with each passing moment, with different thoughts, impressions, paradigms, units of meaning, etc.&nbsp; To expand on this a bit, I&#039;m reposting a trip report from my pharmahuasca trip a few weeks back.&nbsp; Also: +1 right back at you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.msg1186533#msg1186533">Quote from: Great Green Arkleseizure on June 01, 2013, 06:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">TRIP REPORT:<br /><br />I tried another pharmahuasca experiment last night.&nbsp; This time, I took ~550mg of harmala extract in two gel caps and 220mg of rough MHRB extract in a single cap a full hour later (I had prepared a second 200mg cap just in case ... but this turned out to be utterly unnecessary).&nbsp; What can I say ... except &quot;Oh my fuck!&quot;&nbsp; I guess my last attempt (and the previous trip) were simply under-activated, and my harmala extract must not be as potent as I&#039;d imagined ... but 550mg definitely did the trick.<br /><br />Last week, I wrote about a harmonic awakening I&#039;d had with MXE + DMT ... and this trip completed the job that one started.&nbsp; As the DMT began to hit, I had a lot of gastric discomfort, and I lay down in bed and killed the lights.&nbsp; Then a procession of DMT gods and goddesses appeared to me in succession.&nbsp; Each one approaches and greeted me, and then touched me lightly on the genitals and on the chest in a sort of gesture of blessing (I could feel their hands touch me).&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t tell you how many there were ... at one point, I realised that they were in fact Platonic forms for things for which there are no words ... &#039;ways of being&#039; which are complete unto themselves.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been busily making music for a demo album lately and was listening to the 1.5 songs I have recorded thus far in the effort.&nbsp; The music was wildly successful with the pharma, and the gods and goddesses approved ... they were essentially telling me (without words) that I make the best DMT music out there.&nbsp; I became addicted to my own music and listened to the same 9 minutes of music repetitiously for hours.<br /><br />After the last of the DMT gods had shuffled by, I got up and began to walk around ... literally dancing around the house in the dark to the music in my headphones.&nbsp; It struck in the most emphatic way that I&#039;ve become good at this music thing in a way that&#039;s no longer just a &#039;hobby&#039;. I realised that it&#039;s time that I started making a living this way ... more than that, it was already real: the only way I can explain it is to say that in the future, I already have a music career, and I was simply getting an early glimpse of that.<br /><br />I realised that this new life I was getting drawn into was a choice.&nbsp; Each instant, we step from one moment into another ... and that is an act of magic.&nbsp; We have unlimited freedom of choice in this matter, and I simply chose to step into the life of my dreams.&nbsp; There are plenty of other moments out there where I am frustrated and unhappy ... but I choose to direct my awareness into a universe where I am happy and successful.&nbsp; Can you imagine what it would mean for all your wildest fantasies to come true?&nbsp; Probably not ... but you should try, because if you can imagine it, you can choose it.<br /><br />I have no idea how long the pharma trip actually lasted, but as I was beginning to come down from it, I decided to do some MXE and keep smoke DMT.&nbsp; I was still tripping when I measured out the doses of these drugs and inadvertently got out massive doses of each.&nbsp; Not wanting to waste drugs by re-transferring things around, I just went with it and took it all.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much DMT I smoked.&nbsp; Perhaps 100mg?&nbsp; Perhaps more?&nbsp; I was in hyperspace for a period of time which felt like a year (I&#039;m not even exaggerating), just floating from reality to reality through existences I&#039;d had no idea I even had.<br /><br />At one point, I was in a very geometric-looking space---it was like a colony of bacteria and I was just a single cell, or like a giant computer program and I was a single function in it.&nbsp; There was a matriarchal entity---a sort of supervising subroutine in the software analogy---which took notice of me and downloaded all the information about me.&nbsp; She docked alongside me to give me a tune-up ... she left me feeling more well and whole than I ever have.&nbsp; I was again listening to my own music on an infinitely repeating cycle.&nbsp; Everywhere I went, beings started taking notice of me, and I began to realise that the DMT gods were like my groupies ... I had brought music with me that pleased them immensely, and that were giving me all sorts of attention for it.<br /><br />It&#039;s impossible to describe in detail everything that happened in a year of tripping that night ... but the upshot of the whole experience is that I am now a shaman.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I even need the drugs anymore, because I now know how to choose my own reality.&nbsp; I will keep up my role as godfather to this thread until someone else steps up to take over, but I have no immediate plans to order any more drugs through the mail (cool as that idea is).&nbsp; Nonetheless, I am deeply grateful to SR and to you all for being a part of getting me to this point.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=130501.msg1249171#msg1249171">Quote from: CiscoYankerStuck on June 18, 2013, 06:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=130501.msg1249052#msg1249052">Quote from: lunarpursuit on June 18, 2013, 05:40 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Insufflating clean DMT is the SHIT.

				In the post above, I sort of abused the terms spirit and mind, treating them almost as the same.&nbsp; I think a breakdown of my own metaphysical scheme deserves to be given here.&nbsp; These are the terms I will use in increasing specificity:<br /><br />soul &gt; spirit &gt; mind &gt; personality<br /><br />As before, the body can be regarded as the projection of one&#039;s mind into the perceptual world one is experiencing at the time.<br /><br />SOUL: There is only one soul.&nbsp; It is all of us.&nbsp; Its only defining attribute is awareness.&nbsp; It experiences everything imaginable from all possible perspectives.&nbsp; Each such experience is what I was calling a &#039;moment&#039; above.<br /><br />SPIRIT: Each moment balloons out into various dimensions.&nbsp; Because the all-seeing eye (the soul) is located everywhere, its presence is like a sea saturating every moment.&nbsp; This stuff is what I call spirit.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t single &#039;spirits&#039; ... spirit comes in indefinite quantities and all flows into itself (or each other ... however you prefer to phrase that).<br /><br />MIND: This is what we usually call a &#039;self&#039;.&nbsp; If you are familiar with Carlos Castaneda, there is an equivalence of terms: &#039;spirit&#039; = &#039;nagual&#039; and &#039;mind&#039; = &#039;tonal&#039;.&nbsp; The mind is actually a pool of spirit which inflects itself against the rest and makes itself into a semi-definite unit.&nbsp; I like to think of minds as like swirling eddies in the sea of awareness (or spirit).&nbsp; The mind is an identifiable unit ... but if you look closely at the boundary, you&#039;ll find there is no true distinction between it and the rest of the spirit around it.<br /><br />Having a mind is necessary for us to think and act like single, cohesive beings ... but especially under the influence of an unhealthy culture, the mind easily becomes bloated and cumbersome.&nbsp; Each time you experience an ego death, your mind shatters and melts back into the pool of spirit it always was.&nbsp; In order to come out of an ego death, you must build up a new mind from this pool.&nbsp; If you do it correctly, each time your mind becomes smaller, simpler and more manageable ... less burdened down with its own self-importance.<br /><br />Ours minds are like threads of soul woven through reality.&nbsp; At each instant we are the one soul experiencing that unique moment ... but what we do which is really amazing is to string these moments together into a chronology.&nbsp; We weave from one moment to another to define a lifetime ... and although our minds are in constant flux, the lifetime we assemble from the moments we&#039;ve experienced gives us a sense of continuing identity.&nbsp; When we harness the possibilities of one moment and choose the next one we step into, we have truly mastered our own experience ... and that is called witchcraft.<br /><br />PERSONALITY: In the same way we are all threads of the soul, we (the mind) are composed of threads.&nbsp; Each thread is dominant at some times and suppressed at others---these are personalities.&nbsp; A personality is simple and pseudo-algorithmic so as to be ALMOST Turing: a programmed response, which articulates a single, particular way of looking at and interacting with reality.&nbsp; The way they weave together forms the complex behaviour we exhibit and creates the whole we call &#039;ourselves&#039;.<br /><br />Of course, others use these terms differently or use other terms for the same things.&nbsp; This is just how I speak of these things.&nbsp; There are other relevant things I could detail here, but I think this is enough to chew on atm.

				GGA, what you describe is perfect. Thanks for going into glorious detail. I have no further thoughts or questions. You said it all. <br /><br />You are great. :)<br /><br />Also, I can confirm what you say about insufflated DMT. Freebase is much, much worse than fumerate and it cannot even compare to smoking it in terms of efficiency. Our lungs are the most effective way to intake any drug. Period. That&#039;s why I wish LSD could be inhaled. But, honestly it&#039;s efficient enough as is. Any smaller dose would be impossible to manage, especially since it would have to be crystal.

Since there are so many of them you absorb the drug more efficiently and more of it is brought to your brain, where it takes effect.

				Physicist don&#039;t all agree on what &#039;time&#039; means, and while &#039;fractal&#039; is a mathematical word, it is not used consistently with any very precise definition.&nbsp; Fractals are generally taken to be geometric sets which exhibit some kind of structural self-similarity.&nbsp; Even smooth things can be fractals; for instance, the unit circle is the Julia set for the squaring map on the complex plane.<br /><br />Time on the other hand is a tangent direction at each point in space-time distinguished by being the negative eigenspace for the Minkowski metric (of course, it can be defined other ways).&nbsp; If you are a string theorist, this may not always be a single direction, but may balloon out to be multi-dimensional in very strong gravitational fields (i.e., in the presence of a black hole).&nbsp; Even if you&#039;re not a string theorist, in physics, time isn&#039;t a geometric set, but rather a tangential direction at each point.&nbsp; Its flow from any point is a geometic set, but because time is tangled up with the spacial dimensions, the starting point you chose could greatly affect the type of set you ended up with.&nbsp; Basically, it&#039;s silly to try to put a precise meaning to the statement &#039;time has a fractal nature&#039; and defend it with models from physics.<br /><br />Rather, I think what GSE said already explains what he meant by this statement, and it is about as precise an interpretation as you&#039;re likely to come up with.&nbsp; Our experience of time is scale-independent.&nbsp; Under the influence of drugs or while dreaming, our experience of time is drastically dilated without any other apparent change in its nature.

				Trip report.<br /><br />Menu:<br /><br />6 tabs 3Jane&#039;s LSD (estimates 90-110ug so let&#039;s say 100 apiece, 600 total)<br />Approx 110mg 3Jane&#039;s MDA (my first time)<br />(Very) approx 15mg 2-CB (also my first time) (eyeballed; after warnings in 2-CB thread, re-capped a smaller dose)<br />Intermittent mj <br /><br />Set and setting: 8 hours sleep, fitness level: high, nutrition: good, stress level: low-medium, safety and privacy: high but not complete.<br /><br />T:0&nbsp; &nbsp; 6 tabs LSD. <br />T+35 vasoconstriction.<br />T+45 visual waver, colour and brightness enhancement, audio enhancement<br />T+1h OEV and CEV - getting into the swing of things.<br />T+75 psych patina over everything; undulations<br />T+90 paranoia, unfortunately. Pacing. Worry and stress. Loss of balance 3-4 times (catching myself noisily but safely). Decide to advance MDA dose.<br /><br />T+110 MDA <br />T+120 Still in the throes of the LSD trip; riding it out, picking up some focus and calm.<br />T+155...<br /><br />Everything goes black. I&#039;m looking at blackness, except for pinpoints of hard, bright stars. I&#039;m aware that I&#039;m on my couch, in my living room, but I&#039;m seeing infinity. I quickly turn my senses back on myself and there is no question that this is the molly - a bright star burning in my head, that expected positive push but... either on its own or with the LSD *everything* has changed. Unfortunately, I remember only two *moments* from the next couple of hours. The field of stars and blackness, and upon getting up and walking around, self-examination again, to find that I am burning - blue-black flame, head to toe. I am aflame, and, well, it feels like I am a god, or part of a god, alive, awake, aware. <br /><br />Wish I could tell you more than that. This is the most ephemeral experience I&#039;ve had, sadly, for a substance I can&#039;t use very often. I awake some hours later and take the 2-CB - but either because I prepared a cautiously small dose or because there is too little LSD left in my system for any beneficial synergy, there&#039;s a slight come up - more visual waver - but not much else. Oh, and thought loops. Ugh. Terrible thought loops. Some kind of obnoxious commercial message. And a little puzzle I can&#039;t solve. Over and over.<br /><br />Things are... misplaced in my house. My toothbrush is not in its holder but perched, balancing, on a shelf above. Other things like that. I have no memory of moving any of that stuff. Where things have ended up doesn&#039;t make a whole lot of sense.<br /><br />Day after: a terrible headache that lasts the day and I am completely run down. I take vitamins, eat soup, and rest up. <br />2 days after (today): feeling fine. Not 100% and not... quite the same. Kind of an altered mental state, prone to psychedelic thoughts and imagery, especially with music. Or maybe it&#039;s just the serotonin depletion making me feel off-balance and prolonging the sensation of the not-everyday. <br /><br />Will definitely be trying that again - more 2-CB. Maybe a little more molly. Hopefully to retain more of the experience next time.<br />

				Oh, the headache may have been due to jaw clenching/grinding. There was a lot of that, even across the recovery day.

It is all of us.&nbsp; Its only defining attribute is awareness.&nbsp; It experiences everything imaginable from all possible perspectives.&nbsp; Each such experience is what I was calling a &#039;moment&#039; above.<br /><br />SPIRIT: Each moment balloons out into various dimensions.&nbsp; Because the all-seeing eye (the soul) is located everywhere, its presence is like a sea saturating every moment.&nbsp; This stuff is what I call spirit.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t single &#039;spirits&#039; ... spirit comes in indefinite quantities and all flows into itself (or each other ... however you prefer to phrase that).<br /><br />MIND: This is what we usually call a &#039;self&#039;.&nbsp; If you are familiar with Carlos Castaneda, there is an equivalence of terms: &#039;spirit&#039; = &#039;nagual&#039; and &#039;mind&#039; = &#039;tonal&#039;.&nbsp; The mind is actually a pool of spirit which inflects itself against the rest and makes itself into a semi-definite unit.&nbsp; I like to think of minds as like swirling eddies in the sea of awareness (or spirit).&nbsp; The mind is an identifiable unit ... but if you look closely at the boundary, you&#039;ll find there is no true distinction between it and the rest of the spirit around it.<br /><br />Having a mind is necessary for us to think and act like single, cohesive beings ... but especially under the influence of an unhealthy culture, the mind easily becomes bloated and cumbersome.&nbsp; Each time you experience an ego death, your mind shatters and melts back into the pool of spirit it always was.&nbsp; In order to come out of an ego death, you must build up a new mind from this pool.&nbsp; If you do it correctly, each time your mind becomes smaller, simpler and more manageable ... less burdened down with its own self-importance.<br /><br />Ours minds are like threads of soul woven through reality.&nbsp; At each instant we are the one soul experiencing that unique moment ... but what we do which is really amazing is to string these moments together into a chronology.&nbsp; We weave from one moment to another to define a lifetime ... and although our minds are in constant flux, the lifetime we assemble from the moments we&#039;ve experienced gives us a sense of continuing identity.&nbsp; When we harness the possibilities of one moment and choose the next one we step into, we have truly mastered our own experience ... and that is called witchcraft.<br /><br />PERSONALITY: In the same way we are all threads of the soul, we (the mind) are composed of threads.&nbsp; Each thread is dominant at some times and suppressed at others---these are personalities.&nbsp; A personality is simple and pseudo-algorithmic so as to be ALMOST Turing: a programmed response, which articulates a single, particular way of looking at and interacting with reality.&nbsp; The way they weave together forms the complex behaviour we exhibit and creates the whole we call &#039;ourselves&#039;.<br /><br />Of course, others use these terms differently or use other terms for the same things.&nbsp; This is just how I speak of these things.&nbsp; There are other relevant things I could detail here, but I think this is enough to chew on atm.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I do not take any of this back, however things have changed profoundly for me in the last several weeks.&nbsp; The terms I described above and their relationship to one another took a lot of experience to understand and describe as I did: years of off-and-on meditation and other mystical exercises as well as hundreds of trips, including many dozen ego deaths.&nbsp; For all my effort in describing the general outline, I have come to learn that people have studied these matters in much, much greater detail than I originally understood.&nbsp; The system I described above is a system of knowledge that I &#039;earned&#039; by discovering it for myself .... but these answers and a lot more have been open secrets for thousands of years.<br /><br />So far, so obvious ... right?&nbsp; &nbsp;The difference is that lately, I find I know things without having an experience to point to that explains how I came to know them.&nbsp; The point is: I have begun a journey into the unknown.&nbsp; I am apprenticed to an invisible guru.&nbsp; He&#039;s never in, or else he leaves a curtain or a shade between us ... and yet he leaves me messages, suggestions, and gifts to help me on my way.&nbsp; Although there are many references for information and many accounts of such journeys, I am perhaps more &#039;real&#039; to some of you than the authors of these.&nbsp; I would be happy to start a thread and try and document my progress if anyone cares enough to read it.&nbsp; That&#039;s the offer.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested, say so.&nbsp; Cheers.

				My first trip soon, going to use HollandOnline&#039;s LSD 110ug tabs. I&#039;m starting with 1 tab (low dose).<br /><br />My question is, how do you guys feel about redosing? Adding half a tab later in the trip if I don&#039;t think the effects are that strong?<br /><br />At what point should I reach my peak if I don&#039;t eat much before? I don&#039;t want to think &#039;this isn&#039;t strong enough&#039;, redose and then trip way too hard and too intense.<br /><br />And is redosing effective? Will I start tripping harder if I redose 2h in? Is it just intensity or more the length/duration/time of the trip that&#039;s affected?<br /><br />And maybe a silly question, but is the LSD evenly spread out over the tab? If I cut it in half will I get half a dose (approx) or is it possibly the LSD is mostly contained to a certain part of the tab.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
