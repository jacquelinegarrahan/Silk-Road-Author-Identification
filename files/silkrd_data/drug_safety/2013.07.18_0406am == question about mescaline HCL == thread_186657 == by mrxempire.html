				I&#039;ve had my hands on a gram of Gammagoblin&#039;s mescaline for quite some time now, and I am planning on finally taking it at a music festival in about a week. I want to take enough to have a good trip, while also sharing some with friends. I hear anything over 500 mg is a strong dose, so I was planning on taking .4 for myself, and giving two friends .3 each. Do you think this amount will be enough for us to have a good time? People tell me i handle my psychedelics very well, so I&#039;m worried that I won&#039;t be satisfied with .4. Since this is such a rare substance, I want to feel its full effects, yet at the same time, i&#039;ve never done it before so i don&#039;t wanna take too much for my first time. What do you guys think? Should I take .4 and give two friends .3, or maybe just split the gram with one other person?

				I did a cacti mescaline extraction a couple months ago and it was the best idea i&#039;ve ever had.<br />mescaline is a beautiful substance and should be treated like one<br /><br />first time dose id say .35 or .3 depending on the quality <br />look into extraction methods for yourself, its cheaper and always a better experience;)

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried Gamma&#039;s on two occasions. On a empty stomach with no other substances for a week or so 300mg hit me nice but not what I wanted.<br /><br />Weeks later with lots of substances mixed 450mg didnt do much. I&#039;d go right for 500-600mg for a wowing time.<br /><br />

				First time... music festival... might be OK to do 0.4 and have it be not too full-on in that context. There&#039;s always another opportunity to push the dose to 500mg+ and perhaps in a less &quot;busy&quot; environment... Also sharing is nice!<br /><br />BG
