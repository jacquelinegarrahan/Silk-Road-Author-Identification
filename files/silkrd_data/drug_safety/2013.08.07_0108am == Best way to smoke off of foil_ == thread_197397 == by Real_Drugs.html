				Hello all.<br /><br />Every time I smoke off of foil I find myself inhaling fumes from the foil and sometimes burning it. I don&#039;t smoke with foil often nor do my friends so I need a bit of help.<br /><br />Thanks.

				1 - Always heat the foil a little from both parts so as to remove some noxious coatings before beginning.<br /><br />2 - Put the shiny part of the foil above, where the drugs is, because that&#039;s the part that releases the most chemicals and it also permits a better &quot;chasing&quot;.<br /><br />3 -&nbsp; Fold the foil *slightly* into half and put the desired drug on the line that you created with folding the foil; heat the drug a little so it just sticks to the foil before starting trying putting it as high as possible on the foil (so you have more room)<br /><br />4 - Put straw in your mouth and tilt the foil so that the top piece (where you put the drug) goes towards the straw. Keep the straw slightly down the bottom and on top of where the drug is.<br /><br />5 -&nbsp; Heat the foil from below and follow the oil that forms with heating the drug and that rolls down with the straw while keeping the&nbsp; position as in number 4, inhaling the smoke (continuously, in a steady toke).<br /><br />6 - Don&#039;t put the flame too close to the foil or it will start to burn causing noxious smoke to rise and it will also burn the drug not enabling oil to be formed. Don&#039;t use a too high flame.<br /><br />7 - When you reach the end of the foil, roll from top to down inverting the tilt and begin anew.<br /><br />8 - Continue till there&#039;s no more oil formed.<br /><br />

				Thank you very much BlackIris +1<br />Just to confirm, you have the drugs on the shiney side and you light the dull side?

				Yep. Just remember to don&#039;t put the flame too close to the foil or you both burn the drug without liquifying it and burn the foil that&#039;s not good at all.

As a heroin smoker of 20 + years, as well as beginning with hash oil smoked on foil, I can say with no doubt that you use the shiny side to heat, and the dull side to put the drugs on- the shiny side reflects the heat better- thereby stopping you from getting your drugs too hot and frazzling them. The other point being that you are more likely to burn the foil and ingest aluminium. <br />It is always good to lightly heat the foil before use, to burn of any oils that may be left from the manufacturing process

The shiny part is where the most noxious chemicals reside, so in case it burns it&#039;s not fun. If it happens with the dull part you can (if you are lucky) stop the process and maybe not inhale the smoke before the burning reaches the shiny part, but if it happens immediately with the shiny part you have neither this chance.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=197397.msg1426787#msg1426787">Quote from: bobhope333 on August 08, 2013, 12:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It is always good to lightly heat the foil before use, to burn of any oils that may be left from the manufacturing process<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what I said myself.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used heroin extensively when I was young (sadly given the way I used it at that time) and I&#039;ve known a lot of very old users and all of those that smoked with foil used the shiny side above and not below.

It can also be a difference concerning different cultures in different countries (as it happens for example with using certain paraphernalia as the cillum).

				I didn&#039;t really mind which side of the foil that was used.<br /><br />There were people who used to tell me that toasting the foil will get rid of chemicals coating the foil that may be harmful when directly inhaled (Foil used for cooking is eaten, not inhaled).<br /><br />After toasting the foil,&nbsp; the shiny side becomes dull.<br /><br />Some have also linked smoking off aluminium foil to alzheimers but not sure of this.

				I was just stating a matter of fact, commenting on your statement:<br /><br />&quot;There&#039;s no difference there. Think about it and why what you say makes no sense. Heat is stopped in the exact same way, because anyway heat has to pass both sides (it&#039;s not that one part has no heat transfer capability and the other yes, as it can be, for example, a side with rubber and a side with metal) so before or after the amount of shielding to the drug is the same. However, for what it concerns putting the shiny part above: that is the side on which side the oil slips better and is also the part which on close contact with direct heat releases more chemicals, so putting it on top provides two purposes.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Heat is not stopped in the &quot;same way&quot;, dark surfaces/ matt absorbs heat at a greater rate than a reflective surface of the same material. That is basic thermo-dynamics.<br /><br />As to your statement about the shiny side of the foil:<br /><br />&quot;The shiny part is where the most noxious chemicals reside&quot;<br /><br />I would like to see some material to support that claim. According to Wiki, (who&#039;s information, I realise and fully accept, can&#039;t always be trusted):<br /><br />&quot;Aluminium foil is produced by rolling sheet ingots cast from molten billet aluminium, then re-rolling on sheet and foil rolling mills to the desired thickness, or by continuously casting and cold rolling. To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, beta radiation is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity becomes too high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities become too low and the foil has become too thick, the rollers apply more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner. The continuous casting method is much less energy intensive and has become the preferred process.[7] For thicknesses below 0.025 mm (1.0 mil), two layers are usually put together for the final pass and afterwards separated which produces foil with one bright side and one matte side.[8] The two sides in contact with each other are matte and the exterior sides become bright, this is done to reduce tearing, increase production rates, control thickness, and get around the need for a smaller diameter roller.[8]<br />Some lubrication is needed during the rolling stages; otherwise, the foil surface can become marked with a herringbone pattern. These lubricants are sprayed on the foil surface before passing through the mill rolls. Kerosene based lubricants are commonly used, although oils approved for food contact must be used for foil intended for food packaging. Aluminium becomes work hardened during the cold rolling process and is annealed for most purposes. The rolls of foil are heated until the degree of softness is reached, which may be up to 340 °C (644 °F) for 12 hours. During this heating, the lubricating oils are burned off, leaving a dry surface. Lubricant oils may not be completely burnt off for hard temper rolls, which can make subsequent coating or printing more difficult.&quot;<br /><br />As wiki says, the foil is composed full of alumium, the shiny side is produced by the rolling process and by running two layers of foil together, there are no &quot;noxious chemicals&quot;, it is food grade lubricant oil.<br /><br />Actually, in my first post I was just commenting on the side of foil that should be used for putting the gear on and the side for heating, the conventions for which, are based on basic physics, I was rather forthright about it and for that, I really do apologize because, disregarding the issue of &quot;foil side&quot;, I rather thought you had the rest explained down to a &quot;T&quot; Plus, you did mention, as well, about burning of the oil.<br />
