				This my first post but I&#039;ve been lurking around for a while now trying to get as much info as possible in order to gain the courage to place my first order. I have learned so much on this forum and am so happy to find out this board isn&#039;t full of creepers and crazies (which, of course, were my general feelings of the deep web until recently). I feel really lucky to have learned of SR. <br /><br />Anyway, I am here to buy some molly. The stuff I&#039;ve had before from a very trusted friend was supposedly 100% pure. I have looked around and seen listings for pure and 86% pure MDMA. My question is what is the 86% usually cut with? and is 100% vs 86% that huge of a difference? And what is the dark/brown/tan stuff I see in listings?<br /><br />Sorry if this has been answered already... I swear I looked!!!

				100% pure is a logical fallacy,&nbsp; its impossible to get 100% pure anything.&nbsp; 86% MDMA means they haven&#039;t separated the MDA from MDMA, probably just because its too hard/time consuming to do.&nbsp; MDA gives fairly similar effects anyways so you can assume they mean that it is pure MDMA(I&#039;d say anyone advertising 86% MDMA is more likely to have good quality gear as opposed to someone offering 100%)

MDMA freebase is an cautic oil and its possible to reach 100%. then they bubble acid through the MDMA freebase to get the salt form - MDMA HCL. max purity of the hcl salt is about 84% because of diff molar weights they have.<br /><br />here&#039;s some info about molar weight of freebase and hcl:<br /><br />MDMA: 193.2457 g/mol<br />MDMA-HCl: 229.7 g/mol<br />-&gt; 100(193.2457/229.7) = 84,13% <br /><br />@TrashBox: what was the mdma you got looking like? did you do a lab-test? if it was normal molly (crystals or powder) you can be sure its not 100% pure. <br />i think it was just standard molly with purity about 70-85%. so don&#039;t worry, most of the mdma isn&#039;t cut, just beware powder and buy crystals from a trusted seller.<br />
