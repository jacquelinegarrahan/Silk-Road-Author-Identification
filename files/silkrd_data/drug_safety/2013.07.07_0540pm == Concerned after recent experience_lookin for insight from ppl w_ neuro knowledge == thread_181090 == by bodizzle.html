				Thanks to anyone who can offer any insight here.<br /><br />I am currently rather concerned after an experience I have had and hoping maybe you could offer some insight:<br /><br />Last tuesday and wednesday I did some pretty pure coke I bought from here on SR. Only 1 gram total for both days. I also had on hand, about 70-80 mgs of valium to help with the comedown and increased heartrate/nervousness. Besides having the valium on hand, having to do with history before taking the coke, I have also been taking 10 mg lexapro as well as 250mg Rhodiola Rosea 2x day for 2 years. Lexapro is an SSRI and rhodiola seems to be a dopamine/serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well (also read it could be a slight MAOI). But overall rhodiola has a very safe track record.<br /><br />So on the 2 days I did the 1 gram coke, I had taken my regular dosages of 10 mg lexapro and 500 mg rhodiola. Alongside those, I also ended up taking all of my valium (maybe 80-90mgs) as I hate the jitteryness of coke (do it for the euphoria) and I hate the comedown. <br /><br />The following days, starting thursday, up until now, I just feel so very very down, unable to feel back to my normal self and really unable to feel any sort of happiness. Just an overall feeling of shit basically. Like there was some overload of dopamine or serotonin maybe and some possible damage to synapses in my brain that are just not regenerating. I understand 1-2 days of rehab time is normal, but it is going on 4 days now and I still feel like shit. I have never felt like this after doing coke before in my life (but had not been on the lexapro/rhodiola combo) and I am feeling very very concerned that some kind of permanent damage might have taken place? Something to do with dopamine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors being maxed or damaged? OR could it just be I am still detoxing from all that valium? (4 days doesnt make sense though...) <br /><br />Do you think my brain could regenerate from this? Any ideas on what is going on? Should I stop taking the lexapro and rhodiola for a couple days to try and initiate a reset of my brain chemistry?<br /><br />Any feedback is massively appreciated.<br />

				I would suggest you ask your question on 1 of these 2 forum pages (or both): <br /><br />- http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.0&nbsp; (Drug Expert Physician)<br />- http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176073.0 (Pharmacology student)<br /><br />Good luck with your situation - but personally I wouldn&#039;t panic about any residual effect of drugs for at least 5 to 10 days after ingesting the products; especially not when I read what kind of cocktail you took...

				Yep, I wouldn&#039;t worry.<br /><br />If you did deplete all Serotonin it will get back to normal in about a week/ten days, and even in the case (as it happens with MDMA) you could inhibit the enzyme responsible for producing more serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and the inhibition is permanent, your body would create a new enzyme altogether to compensate. This restoration takes from 1 to 3 months.<br /><br />In the case you altered instead your MAO levels as in reducing or increasing them drastically they return to baseline in about 2 weeks.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible (if there is not something I miss, but I don&#039;t think so) to have a totally permanent alteration on your serotonin and/or MAO (I think it&#039;s even difficult to have a full permanent change even if you continue cyclically to do so as for example continuing using MDMA for a very long period of time without pauses; it is indeed neurotoxic but anyway your body will reproduce TPH anew after some time - but in this case I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a way after a while to stop the production altogether, but surely NOT from one use or even ten; for MAO or Serotonin alone it&#039;s impossible no matter what and the levels will return to normal after a while).<br /><br />The time lapse you waited to worry about is too short. Don&#039;t panic, you will return to normal shortly (I highly doubt you inhibited THP permanently so that your body has to recreate it as it happens with MDMA, most likely you depleted Serotonion or changed MAO levels).

				Thank you for your responses.<br /><br />BlackIris:<br /><br />Do you think I should stop taking lexapro and rhodiola all together for about a week? Lexapro is an SSRI and rhodiola is a very very mild MAOI along with being a dopamine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (but it is adaptogenic and natural so works along different mechanisms). I was on these both while doing that 1 gr of coke so Im feeling maybe I should completely DROP everything for a week to give my body a reset? Part of me thinks that if I continue to take these things, it wont give my body a proper chance to reset? (although they never really recommend cold turkeying SSRI&#039;s, maybe in this situation it would be ok as I would be going back on it...)

				I know you would like to &quot;reset&quot; but the problem, as you yourself noted, is that Lexapro is an SSRI and you cannot go cold turkey with it. Your body is now accustomed to it, so you would do even worse if you altogether removed it from your system (moreover if you are having a Serotonin depletion you do worse by removing the Lexapro).<br /><br />It&#039;s difficult to understand if you are having a case of low serotonin or higher amount of it. If you would be sure it was a case of depletion you could try using 5-HTP for a day or two, but if then it&#039;s the opposite case you can either risk of worsening things. Leave things as they are for now and wait a little longer. If the problem persists then maybe it&#039;s better if you go for a professional advice in person.

				Thanks.<br /><br />Yeah, what concerns me is that in the past (4-5 years ago) I had done coke while on lexapro and didnt get these effects...<br /><br />The difference with this time is that the coke was most defnitely more pure and I am taking rhodiola as well.. The reason I mentioned getting off the lexapro temporarily is I read a wiki answers topic on this, and the guy said he tried coke w/ lexapro once (did more coke than me though) but said the following days when he continued with his lexapro dosage he experienced a reverse effect where he felt the lexapro was now doing opposite of what its intention was. Like the coke had distorted its mechanism of action somehow and it was further throwing things off chemically. He mentioned he felt a suicidal depression for a week after and had to stop the lexapro.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was the reason for my concern. BUT, everyone is different, he did do more coke than I did, and maybe his body chemistry was just different. This is what gets me confused on whether or not to stop the lexapro for a &quot;body reset&quot; or not.<br /><br />Uhg, decisions decisions. I should probably stay on the lexapro as the experience I read of was only one person&#039;s but I square yesterday I was definitely feeling a massive deep, dark, and very bleek depression..

				You can try cut on the use of Lexapro by and by and see what it happens (instead of going completely cold-turkey). If symptoms seems to improve then continue cutting it until you are out of it for a while, if symptoms gets worse or don&#039;t change you have nothing to do but simply start taking the usual dose again.<br /><br />I would not immediately go cold turkey because if the problem is not the Lexapro you risk of having a couple or really bad days in that case, but with slowing down the use in steps you can do it without repercussions and see what it happens.
