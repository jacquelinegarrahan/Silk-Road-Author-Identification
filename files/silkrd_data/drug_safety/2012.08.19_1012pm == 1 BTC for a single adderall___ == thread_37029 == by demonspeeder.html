				I&#039;ve finally bought adderall here because I wanted to try it. Man, the stuff is expensive! 1 BTC for one pill. So I take adderall 10mg for the first time and you know what I felt? Nothing! It was like I took a damn sugar pill! I&#039;ve never taken any stimulants before so there&#039;s no way I have any kind of tolerance. How much of this stuff do you have to take to feel something? Okay I&#039;m going to take 20 mg and see if that works.&nbsp; Absolutely ineffective. Not what I was expecting especially considering how much people sell them for. It was a generic cor 132 brand. Does the brand make a difference? And no, I was not taking any depressant or anything that could counter the effects. What the Hell, man?

				10 mg adderall wont do much to most people, especially if you are big, or ate it in on a full stomach.&nbsp; I will be offering 20mg adderall for less than a bitcoin and 30mg for just a lil more here in the next week. Those pills will definitely make you feel it :) <br /><br />http://www.silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/66b212575c<br /><br />That is my vending page, keep an eye on it and in the next few days I will have all my listings up for way cheaper than yall are paying currently!!!

				Back when I was in high school I always thought adderral was for the kids who couldn&#039;t find real drugs, so it is ironic for me to see people on this forum paying such high prices when there are better drugs or the same drug (amphetamine) for so much cheaper.

				I would say 2 hours is enough for the sandwich to have a minor effect. Internet search suggests there could be some cross-tolerance with caffeine, but I didn&#039;t click any of the results for more details. (I believe I have personally experienced cross tolerance with caffeine/amp). And, yeah, it&#039;s overpriced, so hopefully you can find a way to make it work.<br /><br />I take drugs wrong, so I can&#039;t really recommend a dose if you want to feel it, but I will say you can try it sublingually or snort it (even if it&#039;s IR). The bioavailability does not increase via these methods on average, but if for some reason your small intestine doesn&#039;t absorb amphetamine as well as other people, you might get better luck under your tongue or through your nose. Plus, it hits faster, and your stomach contents don&#039;t matter. I almost always do it sublingually due to impatience, but I know people who claim it makes no difference in their experience. If you have some left, I&#039;d try it.<br /><br />Is it possible you couldn&#039;t feel it but it still affected your mood and behavior? I think it&#039;s commonly difficult to notice your own behavior changes unless they are pointed out or you know what to expect. Like, did you accidentally research encryption for an hour and talk a lot?<br /><br />Peace

I tried to write something not long after I took it and I couldn&#039;t concentrate so I ended up playing video games instead like I normally do. After a few hours of taking the pill I actually felt hungry and ate something. Had no problems going to sleep. If I wanted to I&#039;m pretty sure I could have gone to sleep a couple hours after taking it.&nbsp; I did not feel anything.

				From what I have heard the right dose to get anywhere noticeable is at least 30mg of adderall. Remember that if it comes in a single pill, its unlikely to really get you going. One pill normally means that it will treat what it is supposed to without any major side effects, and thats certainly true of stimulants. <br /><br />I do agree about the prices though. They are psycho-high for the product. I guess that aderall is popular among the all-night-cramming college student types and that drives the price up (ie people who don&#039;t know much about drugs). A lot of people who wouldn&#039;t even think about touching speed will snarf down a bunch of aderall to get three extra marks. C&#039;est la vie.<br /><br />Personally, in college I either nailed six red bulls a night or just went and bought speed if I needed to stay up for like 4 straight days. If you want stimulant, either stay within the legal boundaries or go get the stuff that&#039;ll damn sure keep you trucking. Adderall is the same risk as getting caught with any other drugs, and less effect and costs more... economics man.

				You usually need 20-30 mgs to get a buzz.<br /><br />1 BTC is also fabulously expensive for one pill. That said, a product is worth exactly what its buyer will pay for it. If you bought it for that... well, that&#039;s up to you.
