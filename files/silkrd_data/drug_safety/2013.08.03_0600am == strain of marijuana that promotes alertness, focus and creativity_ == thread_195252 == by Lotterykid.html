				I figured i would ask this here.. does anyone know a strain that does that? i don&#039;t smoke marijuana, but i&#039;d like to get into it, but i want something that makes me want to do work versus making me want to relax.. <br /><br />A friend suggested Sativa.. is this true? is there anything else? if there are more than one, is a combination helpful/necessary?<br /><br />Help me out :D<br /><br />Lotterykid.

				You&#039;ll definitely want a sativa dominant plant versus an indica dominant. Every person is different as some strains work differently for some people. I prefer a nice hybrid<br /><br />Some good strains that people commonly report creativity as an effect are any Hazes, Jacks, or Blues. My personal favorite being Brainstorm Haze and Blue Dream. <br /><br />Other examples:<br />Blue Haze<br />Jack Herrer<br />

Sour Diesel is an excellent Sativa. What doesn&#039;t work for me may work for you. Also... I hate to suggest it because it&#039;s an extremely addictive drug... but cocaine. This is the drug that a million of our forfathers (Freud, Einstein etc) used. Watching a documentary on the Eagles and reading Al Jourgenson&#039;s new biography, I realized how many creative people use cocaine.<br /><br />On the light side, you could legally (legal in the US) get some Nootropics and experiment. Perhaps there is some cool mix of Sativa and (I don&#039;t know) Noopept that would be killer.

				I hate to say this but after 10 years of doing drugs I&#039;d have to say that nothing you take is going to promote creativity or focus, maybe alertness but that&#039;s it. Different drugs may open your perception to see things in a different light which can allow you to get good ideas or you may take something and convince yourself that it&#039;s the drug that&#039;s giving you those ideas but truthfully your creative energy has to come from within. You can allow the drugs to amplify this energy but the more you practice the belief that creativity and focus comes from within, it will become easier and easier to be creative.
