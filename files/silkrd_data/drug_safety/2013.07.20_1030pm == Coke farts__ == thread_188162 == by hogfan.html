			<dd class="postbody">
				I recently bought 2g fishscale cocaine. It was very good product, very euphoric. No unpleasant drainage or nose bleeds. The only thing I experienced is what I like to call, Coke farts. The day after I did it all, I had the loudest, hardest, driest farts I&#039;ve ever had in my life. To the point where they physically hurt and I asked my roommate if he thought something was wrong with me. I couldn&#039;t understand what he told me because he was laughing too hard at me. Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe it was from juicing while I was high as I didn&#039;t have much of an appetite. If anyone would like to share similar experiences, let&#039;em rip.
