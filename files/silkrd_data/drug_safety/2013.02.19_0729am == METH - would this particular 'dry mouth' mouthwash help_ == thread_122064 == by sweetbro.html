				I found a mouthwash product called Biotene that is specifically created for people with a dry mouth. apparently contains some special enzymes that &quot;clean refreshes and relieves oral irritations associated with dry mouth&quot;<br /><br />have you tried something like this ? i tried it last night and it did seem to cure my dry mouth but the problem was that i neglected my water intake.. very bad of me... next time im drinking 1.5litrs of water an hour before i even hit the meth again. then i&#039;ll have another 1.5 litre ready to be poured in a glass.. <br /><br />as well as drinking water, would squishing this product around in your mouth regularly during use be of any benefit? especially after taking a hit?<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering also about the use of non-achohol based mouthwash products - swishing that around during a session?

				Not sure if the mouthwash will work. Definitely avoid sodas and sugary beverages.

				The more meth you take, the less hungry you&#039;ll be.&nbsp; Take moderately large doses and you start not being thirsty too.&nbsp; It can become a serious problem, quite frankly: dehydration isn&#039;t unpleasant for no reason -- it&#039;s awfully unhealthy.<br /><br />Yeah, the mouthwash will definitely help your teeth not erode.&nbsp; They&#039;ll still decay, unfortunately, but apparently it causes a lot of bone and tooth loss if your mouth is dry all the time.&nbsp; I guess our saliva is kind of like a mild acid bath for bacteria that eats our teeth, so it helps kill them.&nbsp; Without it they just feast.
