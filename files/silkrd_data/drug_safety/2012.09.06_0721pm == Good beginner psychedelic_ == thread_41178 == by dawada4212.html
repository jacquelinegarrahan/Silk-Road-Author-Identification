				Hello, I not that experienced with &quot;drugs&quot;, I smoke marijuana from time to time but that&#039;s it. Now I wanted to get into some psychedelics and I was thinking that maybe a shouldn&#039;t start with something like LSD or DMT, but rather something lighter. What would be a good one to start with? I was thinking of ordering 25i/c-NBOMe, mainly because it&#039;s cheap, what do you guys think?

				2c-B.<br />First psychedelic I ever took and it was an amazing experience. It has a real nice body high and I remember seeing bambi and beautiful birds dancing about in the woods we were in, it has some really nature oriented visuals ime. At one point in the trip though, I visualized a scary clown in front of me, but because it feels too good I didn&#039;t give a shit. It also gave me the ability to &#039;come out&#039; of the trip if i wanted too (not that I did want too!). You should give check it out man, its really nice imo. Especially after an MDMA peak.

				Here&#039;s my opinion in order. <br /><br />1) 2C-B-It has an amazing body high and last&#039;s around 3-5 hour&#039;s from my experience&#039;s. I would say start out with a dose around 20mg that should have you feeling quite well :). Another thing is I have never read anyone having a bad trip on this drug I&#039;m sure it&#039;s happened before but it must be a pretty rare occurrence so this is a very good thing for some inexperienced.<br /><br />2) LSD-The reason I placed this as number 2 is because people do have bad trips if your heads not in the right place. If you do choose to do this I suggest you start out with 1 or 1 1/2 tabs (125mcg) from a good vendor on here. Also remember this drug last&#039;s quite a long time 12hrs or so could be good or bad depends on your living situation and shit.<br /><br />3) Mushrooms-If you enjoy a major mind fuck and your walls melting this may be the psychedelic for you. If you have good dry shrooms I&#039;d go with 2 or 2.5 grams for your first time. Shrooms also can be a good teacher (Along with LSD) and help you reflect on your problem&#039;s in life, it has personally helped be though things quite a bit.<br /><br />Hope this help&#039;s you out buddy. Also if your have someone close to you that you trust I suggest a trip sitter it will help ease the mind well it does for me anyway when I was inexperienced. Have a good time!!

				People seem to ignore OPs request for something lighter. Suggesting &quot;if you don&#039;t mind a little mind fuck&quot;, LSD, mushrooms, etc. Well I&#039;m guessing the OP has never experienced mind fuck, and probably doesn&#039;t want to in a hurry :-)<br /><br />I had 25c NBOMe, and it&#039;s basically like LSD, perhaps a little shorter acting but it may depend on dose.<br /><br />The first time I did mushrooms, my and GF picked around 100 in the field, made mushroom soup with the whole lot, and within 5 minutes there were rivers of colour on everything. Within 10 minutes we didn&#039;t know which way was up. We planned on going outside, but basically at the 10 minute mark, we were too scared to go outside. At one later, after coming back inside, for a long time, we had to hide in bed. To this day I have no idea how much 100 little mushrooms is in terms of dose. It was interesting at times, but mostly, we were too fucked and paranoid to enjoy it. This was very early on in my use of psychedelics.<br /><br />So, I would suggest Ketamine, for these reasons. It is mildly psy, however the dose can be adjusted carefully. If you drop an LSD tab, or snort a 25c cap, and it&#039;s too much for you, well what may only be 6 hours of tripping, actually seems more like days of thinking &quot;OMG am I ever going to be normal again&quot;. With K, you can bump 20mg, and be back to normal in 45 minutes. Then try 40mg, and so on. It will give you the experience of being &quot;out of your body&quot;, get used to some visuals, and sensations that are completely alien. Besides, I love Ketamine!<br /><br />If you did do LSD or 25c, both of which are lovely drugs you should definitely try, if you seem to like psychedelics, you have to be more careful or where, and who you take it with. You bring along a guy who starts freaking out, and he will freak you out as well. Ensure you have 36 hours before you need to be normal again. Plan a day of resting, drinking beers, watching a movie, getting sleep, etc.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t done MDMA though, hmmm, MDMA is perhaps the best drug in the world. Until the magic wears off. Go to a nightclub that is generally full of MDMA heads, take 100-120mg of crystal MDMA, a few close friends, and you will be so glad you did.<br /><br />So. 1: K, 2: MDMA, 3: 25c/i NBOMB<br /><br />I would leave LSD out, it&#039;s expensive, dose is unpredictable. You&#039;ll probably take a tab and nothing much will happen. Then take 2 and be out of your depth for what seems like an eternity. At least with 25c you can snort half a cap, and see how it goes. Then try a whole cap the next week, or later. I did 2 caps of tyler&#039;s 25c, and there were times if I didn&#039;t know how to handle it better, I would be very worried.<br /><br />Actually knowing how to &quot;handle it&quot; is usually not to try to handle it at all. Change something, music, room, go outside, lie down etc... Remember you are on drugs, and drugs wear off. :-)<br />

				I&#039;m normally against RCs, but I&#039;ve come across the curiosity to try 2c-b and honestly, this is the easiest psych in the world.&nbsp; I have never heard of anyone having a bad experience with it unless they overdosed (I read some erowid reports about people dosing upwards of 300mg of this shit, and even they still weren&#039;t traumatized by it, they didn&#039;t have a great time but they did mention they&#039;d still do it again, albeit at a &quot;normal&quot; dosage).&nbsp; While I usually would say &quot;Don&#039;t go near RCs&quot;, 2c-b has a lot of time on the shelf and no one has reported ill long-term or even short-term effects that are unusual for a typical psych...<br /><br />Depending on how confident you are, I&#039;d say acid is just fine for your first trip.<br /><br />I&#039;m also not the most experienced and haven&#039;t ventured far past the gold standards, with the exception of 2c-b now.&nbsp; I would recommend not going anywhere near the NBOMes, as they&#039;re still relatively unknown and have not stood the test of time like the rest of the psychs out there.<br /><br />1)&nbsp; 2c-b <br /><br />Will never do you wrong, but its not really the deep mental headspace you get on &quot;real&quot; psychs, which is why it&#039;s a &quot;sometimes&quot; drugs for me.&nbsp; I like it for the short trip in an evening after work, when I don&#039;t have time for the 12 hour haul LSD can put you through.&nbsp; I also like it as an alternative to molly for dancing, the body high has some reminiscence of MDMA without the intense &quot;FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRGH I WANNA DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE&quot; feeling I get from it (which is awesome, but sometimes you just want a very casual body high).&nbsp; This is actually the ideal party drug for my g/f because she can&#039;t handle ecstacy and she&#039;s still kind of taking it slow with psychadelics, so she&#039;s come to enjoy this one for it&#039;s mild and energetic high.<br /><br />2)&nbsp; LSD<br /><br />This is really my favorite psych, just because it gives me a very logical trip, and I&#039;m a very logical guy.&nbsp; It helps me sort out my emotions, how my mind works, and how I integrate with others. It gives me a glance into things that might be subconsciously bothering me that I didn&#039;t know were the root of a problem in the real world.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; I do NOT recommend taking ANY psych if you&#039;re not in a reasonably good mindset.&nbsp; Being depressed, or anxious, or paranoid can lead to 12 hours of absolute mental hell if you aren&#039;t experienced with psychs.&nbsp; At least, make sure you respect set and setting with this one.&nbsp; 2c-b is more forgiving if you fuck that up, acid not so much.&nbsp; If you take it with friends and stay within the confines of comfortable places, people, and settings, you&#039;ll have a great time, and the drug becomes a lot more recreational in the company of other people tripping.&nbsp; If you do this for the first time DO IT WITH FRIENDS AND DONT GO ANYWHERE UNFAMILIAR, I would not recommend solo tripping until you start to understand how real psychadelics can steer your mind the wrong ways.&nbsp; Acid is not nearly as scary as I&#039;m probably making it sound, but the potential exists for a bad trip, unlike 2c-b which requires a lot more bad vibes to even have a remotely unsettling trip.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; Shrooms<br /><br />Once you&#039;re at least comfortable with acid&#039;s headspace, you should take a look into mushrooms.&nbsp; Now I do not have extensive use of shrooms because I have a pretty intense phobia of mushrooms (as silly as that sounds), so I only can take it in tea, chocolates, capsules, basically anything that I can&#039;t visualize or taste, feel the texture, anything can really set my phobia off, which usually features uncomfortable feelings, nausea, just a general sense of unease.&nbsp; Looking at shrooms makes me kind of jittery and weird...I can&#039;t explain why I am this way about them.&nbsp; Either way, I HAVE done shrooms at least 4 or 5 times and the experience is a bit more intense than acid.&nbsp; There&#039;s a definite body load present (mild nausea) when I use them, your mileage may vary though.&nbsp; The visual aspect of it is much more interesting and &quot;cartoony&quot; I guess than acid, which I tend to have more fractalization and logical headspace.&nbsp; Shrooms make me feel more empathic and curious, explorative.&nbsp; I have not had a bad trip but I hear a bad shroom trip can be traumatizing because of how intense your fight or flight response ramps up on them.&nbsp; Again, not the most experienced, but I&#039;d approach shrooms more carefully than the previous 2.<br /><br />4)&nbsp; Mescaline<br /><br />The one time I did it there was a body load throughout the trip.&nbsp; This has a pretty long duration too, I think my trip lasted about 14 hours total, so it&#039;s up there with acid.&nbsp; You&#039;ll end up in so many corners of your mind, and there will be unpleasant and pleasant thoughts throughout the trip, so I&#039;d say mentally prepare for this substance before trying it, once you&#039;re comfortable with all the above it&#039;s really not that intense or overwhelming if you stay at a common ~300-400mg dose or so.&nbsp; It&#039;s very enjoyable, and you might vomit during the comedown, or during the trip, which in hindsight wasn&#039;t all that painful.&nbsp; I hear there&#039;s a lot of cases of nausea during a mesc trip, and I did vomit myself, (so did my partner), but afterwards I felt good again and the comedown was pleasant.&nbsp; There was definitely some times, maybe an hour total where I wandered to dark places in my mind but I could steer myself back to a positive place since I&#039;ve done that many times on acid, and have had practice concentrating on that.&nbsp; I also felt very intense emotions and connections with objects that weren&#039;t really alive.&nbsp; I think I pondered how rocks feel when they&#039;re handled by people for a good 30 minutes, and it made me very sad knowing they couldn&#039;t experience their role in life.&nbsp; Strange feelings like that, you may not be familiar with relating to how a rock feels, so it can be awkward if you&#039;ve never done psychs before.<br /><br />5)&nbsp; DMT<br /><br />I think this is a very intense psych and should be approached carefully, at least get into your head with some of the other psychs first and get used to the comfort of the headspace.&nbsp; I myself have yet to breakthrough on it, but even a non breakthrough is wild.&nbsp; On the plus side, it&#039;s a very short trip, and you feel fantastic after it starts to come down, like I usually feel as if I&#039;ve just woken up from an awesome dream.&nbsp; Of course, I still get tired hours later as my body hasn&#039;t actually slept, but the cool thing is the duration, and the almost near zero tolerance buildup (wait a few hours, hit it again, enjoy the ride.&nbsp; it&#039;s pretty cool!)<br /><br />I do get a little uneasy when I smoke DMT, just because I know how mentally intense it is, and sometimes I&#039;ll take months off from using it again just because I get this indescribable fear of &quot;what if I do breakthrough, will I be able to handle it?&quot; and end up low-dosing just for the fun mind ride for 10 minutes or so.&nbsp; It also tastes gross, but that&#039;s easy to get over.&nbsp; The smoke can be harsh even vaped, so it&#039;s easy to lose some of the hit when it hits your throat and you&#039;re like &quot;BLECH!&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s also VERY sensitive in how you smoke it, its very easy to lose a good half of your hit if you fuck it up.&nbsp; Make sure you pick a really good smoking tool and stick to it once you master it.<br /><br />So really I&#039;m ranking this last just because of the intensity, and how difficult it is to really get the smoking technique down.&nbsp; If you have a friend who is experienced at smoking it, it makes this part much easier, but I don&#039;t have that liberty.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried &quot;The Machine&quot; which is really effective but also gets gross really fast.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried a normal glass bowl, too easy to burn the crystal, even being super careful.&nbsp; I tried VaporGenie but I don&#039;t have the glass one, hard to gauge how well I&#039;m hitting it and I seem to lose half of my hit every time.&nbsp; I&#039;m now using &quot;The Key&quot; which with my first two attempts I think the tube is too long, so I&#039;m running out of breath inhaling before it hits me.&nbsp; I might give it another go with half the tube length, because I had a pretty good trip on 40mg last night and I know I fucked it up a little.&nbsp; Having a friend on lighter duty also helps a lot because I tend to clam up when I&#039;m about to hit it, mostly nerves.&nbsp; I don&#039;t knwo why but DMT makes me nervous whenever I smoke it.&nbsp; Some day I&#039;ll breakthrough but I&#039;m content just riding the DMTeeterTotter for now.<br /><br />====<br /><br />And thats really all I can say off my experience.&nbsp; Psychs aren&#039;t really that scary once you try them, but anxiety about taking a drug can also affect your trip, being in a panic while you wait for the comeup can have adverse effects on the drug (my friend told me a story about a girl he gave her first acid to, who had major anxiety issues, she hyperventilated as it kicked in and thought she was dying, it took him 3 hours to get her back to a positive state of mind, so yeah even low dose can fuck someone up if they&#039;re prone to anxiety when sober, or have other mental issues to sort out) -- &lt;- keep this in mind too because not all drugs affect everyone the same.&nbsp; Mental issues, disorders, can all affect tripping both positively and/or negatively.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;re confident in your mental stability (which 95% of the time, I think anyone could handle acid easily), just go for acid and make sure you have a whole day set aside to explore it comfortably.&nbsp; 2c-b if you&#039;re hesitant to dive right in though.&nbsp; My first drug was acid, then E, then I started experimenting with other things.&nbsp; 2c-b I tried for the first time way late in the game, and while I like it, it&#039;s not really &quot;psych&quot;-ey enough for me.&nbsp; It is fantastic for raves, parties, social settings when you just want to trip but not be too fucked up to socialize, and don&#039;t really feel up for the intense MDMA roll.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps, OP.&nbsp; Happy travels!<br /><br />PS:&nbsp; Not sure why people are including MDMA since it&#039;s not a psychedelic, I&#039;ve never had visuals on it, occasional tracers, but that&#039;s as intense as it gets visually.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a strong body or empathic high really.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t tried it I&#039;d highly recommend doing it at least once with people you love, but it&#039;s a completely different experience from any psychedelic drug.&nbsp; Ketamine is also a dissociative which may not be something you feel comfortable playing with, I&#039;ve never done it though, and don&#039;t plan on trying it, so I just say for most other drugs out there: it&#039;s your body.&nbsp; Most standard psychedelics are pretty damned safe to your body&#039;s physical state, and over-use of psychs in rare cases causes HPPD, or triggers latent mental problems like schizo, everything in moderation and you&#039;ll never &quot;Lose the magic&quot; of most drugs.&nbsp; Like MDMA, some people report this loss of &quot;magic&quot; to it, but I have rolled for a good few years on a monthly basis or so, and every roll has been at least up to minimal expectations at various levels, it really depends with a drug like that, though.&nbsp; But I also don&#039;t ever overstep my comfort line with molly, so she stays good to me :)<br /><br />

				2c-b is pretty benign and can definitely give you a solid psychedelic experience without too much ego-shredding and general unpleasantness.&nbsp; It&#039;s also pretty short-acting: if you get uncomfortable, you&#039;ll likely be back to baseline within a couple hours.&nbsp; It&#039;s also got a good safety profile: I&#039;ve heard reports of people IVing 250mg of 2c-b with no lasting physical effects.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since the Grand Wizard is always happy to help a novice (and is also a shameless self-promoter), I&#039;m going to make the OP an offer.&nbsp; Buy 50mg of 2c-b at the Grand Wizard&#039;s Lair and hit the &quot;Combined Shipping&quot; option: I&#039;ll send it without charging for postage.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have a good time -- two or three good times, actually -- and that should give you some basic idea of what psychedelics can do.&nbsp; After that you can decide where you want to explore next.<br />&nbsp;<br />Other than 2c-b, I&#039;d also recommend mushrooms.&nbsp; Psilocybin is a lovely and benevolent ally, and you should have a good time with a reasonable shroom dosage.&nbsp;

				Do you guys really consider 2c-b to be a psychedelic though?&nbsp; I think it still has that &quot;forced&quot; euphoria and really isn&#039;t helpful in preparing you for other true psyches like LSD or Psilo.&nbsp; Just my opinion.&nbsp; If anything I&#039;d say 2c-i is closer to being psychedelic.&nbsp; But neither is a good place to start in my opinion.&nbsp; LSD is just so good, so pure, so right.&nbsp; Even a difficult experience is productive.&nbsp; There is no such thing as a bad trip.&nbsp; I love the cleansed feeling I have after a good acid trip.

				I fucked around with shrooms a lot in high school, because it was a common notion that it made sense to do boomers before acid, as a logical progression kinda like you are tlaking about. False, just skip mushrooms altogether they fucking suck. No control whatsoever, the drug literally does what it want and you are along for the ride. Acid is simply the best, its amazing. About 50% of my shroom trips (about 10 or so) had at least a bad part, if not just sucked in general. A couple were pretty sweet, but overall fuck shrooms. I;ve never had a bad trip on acid, because you are just clean, clear, and in control.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had experiences where I could literally decide what I wanted to see visuals wise. Just by thinking about a certain color scheme I could make it appear, or manipulate shapes by opening my eyes wider and then squinting. Acid is just so fucking cool, I wish someone had told me to skip shrooms and just try acid, theres no reason you can&#039;t do it first just take a fairly small dose your first time and pay attention to set and setting type stuff as people have said, but don&#039;t even worry too much about that, it will be great.

				2c-b is a psychadelic but it&#039;s also got a little hint of an MDMA high too...I really don&#039;t know what to call it but most people consider the 2c family to be psychedelic.&nbsp; Erowid has it labelled as a psych, and so does SR so...-shrug-

				Agree w/ Bob.&nbsp; While I wouldn&#039;t say shrooms suck they definitely seem more like you are just at the mercy of the &quot;drug.&quot;&nbsp; I had the same feeling before I was &quot;experienced&quot; that shrooms were less intense and therefore I should try them before LSD but that is entirely unaccurate.&nbsp; Also a small percentage of people (like me) are hyper-sensitive to mushrooms.&nbsp; For me 1g cubensis is roughly equal to 2 hits of decent blotter although the duration is much shorter.

Unlike other drugs such as stimulants and opioids which induce familiar states of consciousness, psychedelics tend to affect and explore the mind in ways that result in the experience being qualitatively different from those of ordinary consciousness. The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as trance, meditation, yoga, and dreaming.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />2C-B is without a doubt a psychedelic you can&#039;t really even argue with&nbsp; Alexander Shulgin lol...

				LSD<br /><br />50-100ugs would be good for a first timer. i am like 95% sure that if you stay hydrated and mind set and setting that you&#039;ll have a fine time.<br /><br />if it makes you feel any better you can keep a xanny on hand.<br /><br />I wouldnt recommend experimenting with any RC&#039;s at this time seeing as how new they are. its just common sense. people havent been binging on RC&#039;s for years and then come out unscathed afterwards (like LSD). no offense to anybody who uses them, i just dont feel comfortable encouraging another to try it out for this reason.<br /><br />peace and boobs to you. psychedelia is a wonderful place thats within us all! i hope you have a wonderful time there

				LSD<br /><br />Once you have the Experience every other psych will be BORING.<br />Seriously, MDMA ain&#039;t fun no more. Not that I lost the magic, but it is just so insignificant compared to the magic of LSD.<br /><br />Shrooms are great. <br />However, like others have noted, they are more difficult to handle. <br />Therefore, just go with LSD at a 100 mic dose.<br />Not only is it the most profound and most magical experience, it also floods your body with absolute ecstasy.<br />I honestly have felt like I was having a six hour orgasm many times just tripping in my bed listening to Hendrix or the Dead.<br /><br />100 mics may not give the full effect but you will get your feet wet.<br />Then wait a week or two and take it up to 200 mics and get ready for the most amazing time of your life.

				If you want to start with something light, you could always take half a tab of LSD. At 50ug you would get a good feel of the drug, but it probably wouldn&#039;t be intense enough to lead to a bad trip.&nbsp; Just make sure you are in a comfortable set and setting.

				What about 2c-p?I&#039;ve tried LSD(80-100 ug),2c-p and ketamine.I can&#039;t offer ketamine to everyone but really there are some people have to know it...on the other hand it is not a substance related to this subject I think.I snorted and swallowed after snort 2c-p many times.Total dose was 8-10 mg per trip I guess.I think it can be very stong somewhere inside the trip sometimes.Especially CEVs are very intersting for me,colorfull but very smooth geometrical 3D shapes or designs...actually I could create those architectural designs and also could look them from the outside or/and the inside of them...and lots of letters(like A,B,C not digits) I don&#039;t know where they come from.2C-p trips really interesting for me.Then I took LSD(80-100 ug),I felt better ofcourse be physical but not deep enough.I&#039;m sure it may be so different&nbsp; and deep at high doses but moderate dose 2c-p is much better for me than low dose LSD, psychedelically.
