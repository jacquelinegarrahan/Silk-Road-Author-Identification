				Hi silkroaders,<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in getting some meth in Australia. I&#039;ve smoked it before but I&#039;ve never bought it myself so I don&#039;t know what is a fair price and right size.<br />How much is a decent amount of meth to be buying in one hit? I&#039;m seeing people selling points and grams but the grams in Australia are just ridiculously expensive. If I bought a point, how much does that give me smoke wise for someone that is not meth tolerant at all? How long would it likely last if I wasn&#039;t going crazy with it? What is the ballpark street price for a point or a gram?<br /><br />Also does anyone know if you can still buy the glass pipes over the counter in Australia? Is there some code name (like buying a &#039;tobacco pipe&#039; for weed pipes) I have to use to get one?<br /><br />Cheers guys.

				I was once asked for $1600 for a gram! Apparently Jebus himself dropped these godly shards from his nostrils into the baggies... fkn crazy!<br /><br />There&#039;s also an online bongs shop that sells all the different kinds of sweet puffs and other pipes you could ever need! Forget the exact name right now, but something like bongs online or onlinebongs.. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll figure it out :)<br /><br />As long as you&#039;re easy on the flame and know what you&#039;re doing vaping-wise, 1 point should last you and a mate 1 night if the shit&#039;s good and your tolerance is low.<br />Beforehand and throughout keep taking antioxidants, vitamins C and E, magnesium and zinc. Not only will you feel better later on, but your short-term tolerance should also slow down with these vitamins..<br /><br />If you want 1 point to go fast though but really smash you in the nuts in one go, crush it up real fine and hotrail 1/2 a point at a time, then perform all sorts of sexual acts on your partner/member/etc...

				Hey dude, I was also curious about this so I grabbed&nbsp; a point and a sweet puff pipe and had a crack. Here is what i did / my experience.<br /><br />I had one point, its what I order, im guessing if it was over by any it wouldnt be by much, so I started smoking it at about 11:30am, finished smoking the one point by about 4pm, ended up staying up till 7am. I dropped a full xanax 2mg bar at 9:30pm and didnt have much affect on me, I didnt try to sleep but neither felt sleep,until about 7am when I couldnt keep my eyes open.<br /><br />I had about 7 little smokes over those 4 or so hours, so must have been about 20mg smokes or something, not sure didnt weight it out. I didnt feel that fucked at all, just a bit of confidence very mild euphoria, felt like having conversations a lot but wasnt an issue when I didnt. I chilled at my computer must of the time and listened to music etc, Mate came over about 10pm and we dropped 50mg of mdma (was all I had left from the night before which I dropped 300mg) mdma didnt do much to me but hit my mate kinda&nbsp; hard so he basically talked heaps and I just listened, which I was content to do, until I started getting really tired, I had one meal about 4pm and took some multivitmains and C through out. <br /><br />Lessons learnt, if I was to do that same thing again, I would do 50mg hit! then a few hours later smoke the rest :) but I wanted to take it easy as I have BP issues to deal with as well.<br /><br />I find it very moreish especially because it doesnt rip your throat apart like smoking bongs and is basically odourless (basically however when I went back to my room after smoking it was pretty easy to smell it, open the windows for a bit and was all fine) smoking inside also makes it more fun and easy.<br /><br />I did find that it had a very strong pull afterwards even though I took it very cautious, that was last weekend and I wouldnt mind smoking a bowl right now, except my life cant allow that, I have a job, a gf etc etc <br /><br />I will defiantly do it again! I even booked holidays so I can hit it up again, except they arent until several months time :(<br /><br />Overall , it wasnt what I expected but I still really enjoyed it, I think the power of meth for me (from what I have found) is in its subtlety, in you could hit it and go to work and get shit done. But I dont know, I need more experience before making that judgement I guess.<br /><br />Anyways hope it helps! If you dont have anything to lose and tend to fiend on drugs, stay away, I thought I would have no pull but it was defiantly there and made me feel uneasy.<br /><br />Also no real come down either, I sleep for 5 hours , felt tired for about a day, and at work for a day or two I felt uncomfortable and felt like I should be doing something else, wasnt too bad but defiantly was not a pleasant feeling.
