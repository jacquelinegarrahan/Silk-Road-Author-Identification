				I&#039;ve seen on SR Heroin sold as #3, #4 and black tar and I couldn&#039;t find what they mean.<br /><br />So, what&#039;s the difference between them? Also, what&#039;s their market value weight for weight? how does 1g of #3 compare against 1g of #4 or 1g of black tar in terms of market value/price?

				#3 is primarily snorted and smoked. It can be injected but it has to be dissolved in citrus instead of water.&nbsp; #4 is primarily IV&#039;d, Black Tar is smoked. #4 is a more refined version of #3, in layman&#039;s terms.

The Midwest and East Coast number four prevails. South West and West Coast is where tar dominates almost exclusively.

				#3 and #4 , <br /><br />is revering to the times of chemical purification.<br /><br />#4 you say &quot;&quot;number four&quot;&quot; ,<br /><br />&nbsp;is just a number three but cleaned one time extra, usually with chloroform or ether.<br /><br /><br />In short;<br /><br />boil opium, clean it trough a sheet or piece of cloth, add vinegar -acid (azijnzuur/-anhydride in Dutch) and let it stay for 6 hours on 80 degrees Celsius. <br />A acetylgroup will be added and bound to the morphine. All is soluble in water. When a base is added, most of the times that will be agricultural calcium, the water can no longer obtain the (now) di-acetymorphine, witch will combine at each other and fall to the bottom.<br />A preplaced sheet can catch the heroin, the water runs through the filter (sheet) and the heroin #3 can be laid down in the sunshine to dry.<br />usually there more then one type of cloth, the one is woven more tight then the other so you filter it twice. With a fine filter and less tight woven sheet.<br />Water can be drained differently and you can catch the heroin that has fallen through the finest filter, it lay&#039;s just at the bottom of the pan.<br /><br />So #4 is#3 refined one time more.<br /><br />

				Would anybody like to overview any differences in experiences in terms of form? I&#039;ve unwittingly smoked small doses of black tar before and enjoyed it. I&#039;d like to know if anyone else could tell me more of what to expect if I acquired some and tried to smoke it in slightly large quanities/frequency. (I checked erowid but there were only a couple that specifically mentioned tar and maybe two that actually smoked it). <br /><br />
