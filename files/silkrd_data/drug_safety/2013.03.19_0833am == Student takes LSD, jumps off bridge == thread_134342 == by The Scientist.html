				(...)<br /><br />Levine, having taken two hits of blotter acid, trashed a Simon’s convenience store in Colchester near St. Michael’s College at about 11 p.m. that night, ran through campus and led campus security to the Lime Kiln Road bridge, according to Colchester Police Detective Tyler Kinney’s affidavit.<br /><br />Levine then jumped off the bridge and fell about 40 feet onto the railroad tracks below, according to the detective. Rescue workers responded to the scene and transported the student to Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington.<br /><br />Levine shattered his spine, fractured nearly all of his ribs and damaged several organs when he hit the tracks, according to the affidavit. His condition had improved to good by Wednesday morning, according to a hospital spokeswoman.<br /><br />http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20130227/NEWS02/302270012/?nclick_check=1

				I haven&#039;t clicked the article, but I wonder if he was tested for LSD or if the article was just going off of what he told them. Not saying that kind of thing can&#039;t happen on acid but still, too bad he didn&#039;t think to have anyone with him to make sure he didn&#039;t do anything stupid&nbsp; :-\

				Wait... If I understand this correctly: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ran through campus and led campus security to the Lime Kiln Road bridge, according to Colchester Police Detective Tyler Kinney’s affidavit&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Then it means that campus security *chased* him to the Lime Kiln Road bridge. He had trashed a convenience store so it seems logical. Then having nowhere else to go... <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Levine [...] jumped off the bridge and fell about 40 feet onto the railroad tracks below</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>...breaking every bone in his body. Why? Because he was afraid of getting caught being high. Thank god he was high, otherwise the campus security might have gotten some of the blame :/ Like if he was in a normal sober psychosis or just plain desperate. I think many of us would jump in that same situation if we thought we had a chance of getting away.

				I get the sense that there are a lot of people defending the acid around here... I personally don&#039;t have any romantic ideals for psychoactives, so the story isn&#039;t really that big of a deal. Campus security was doing exactly what they are supposed to do.<br />If you are doing acid, don&#039;t be stupid. Acid fucks you up in the head, act accordingly. <br /><br />Like valakki said, good riddance.

				This can happen with legit LSD, unfortunately. I know we would love it to be otherwise, but it&#039;s not limited to recent or weird RCs. A similar incident stopped one of the secret CIA MKULTRA subproject trials, which was experimenting with LSD on unwarned people&nbsp; in the 70s (unwarned or irresponsible gets you the same results - but you can&#039;t wish every drug user to suddenly become responsible). You can read some declassified FOIA documents about it on .gov sites.

It can also cause you to do insane stuff in the hands of the careless. <br />Is there any real evidence that he was on another substance, other than your personal desire to see LSD in a perfectly harmless light?

In a way it is the same with food; fast food is useful at times, but abuse it careless and harm will come to your body.<br /><br />I can admit that I do many things on acid and shrooms that most would consider stupid. I love climbing trees, train martial arts (with weapons), bicycling and some acrobatics. If it came out that youngsters were doing martial arts on acid that would create headlines in the small town I live ::) But by considering the risks, making sure we got our set and setting right, we manage to avoid accidents and we learn a lot from our sessions. You can push the limits of the body when you trip, but you need to be aware that you are doing that, otherwise you might push them too far at the wrong time. Safety always needs to be considered.<br /><br />The best we can do is to learn from each others and avoid doing mistakes that has already been done before. That is why forums like these are so valuable, maybe more than Silk Road itself. The market place helps us find each other so we can tell and listen, learn and teach. I admit I downplay the risks at times :( Your points are very valid and necessary.<br /><br />Be safe.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Do not do martial arts while high unless you have a lot of training and experience under your belt!
