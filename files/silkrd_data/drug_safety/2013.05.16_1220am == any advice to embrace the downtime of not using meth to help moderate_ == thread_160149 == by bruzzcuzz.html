				the other day i was telling this guy about meth and how i was like hanging for some and he told me &quot;mate sounds like you need to embrace the wait as much as the event.. i used to be like you many years ago until i learned to accept the time without&quot;<br /><br />was gonna ask him to elaborate but he&#039;s not been on.. his words resonatedf with me though.<br /><br /><br />i can stay off the meth but just dont like waiting/dreaming or thinking about it.. when i crave it its not a 5 minute crave that you can surf the wave these are 8 hours long and im kinda stupid and immature.<br /><br />id just like to be able to get on with things u know.<br /><br /><br />sometimes i hear low income bingers go a whole month and then binge... im like how fuck do they do that?<br /><br />i dont binge i just need a little advice.. id be happy to do it just every 2 or 3 weeks.. it easy to stay off but you know - sometime i treat it like im &quot;in deep love&quot; with the shit.

I don&#039;t know why you think an 8 hour craving isn&#039;t surfable. When I gave up injecting smack I had incredible cravings, would go on for days let alone hours. You have to surf it dude. Take each minute as it comes and surf it. Gradually you will learn what distracts you from the craving, what makes you feel better without scoring. It&#039;s all about discovering and learning new techniques.<br /><br />You took the plunge to take a potent drug and you now have to put effort into controlling your behavior or you know where you could end up... &quot;Faces of Meth addiction&quot; anyone?<br /><br />Don&#039;t take this like I am lecturing you, just trying to offer my experiences in addictive class A drugs.<br /><br /><br />The less frequently you take a drug the easier it becomes to deal with the cravings. The more you fill your life with things that keep you active and happy, the easier it will become to deal with cravings. Do you have a good friend you can call at any time of the day/night when you feel like you can&#039;t handle the surf/craving and you feel like you&#039;re going to bail and score? Someone who can keep your spirits up and listen to you, support you. Don&#039;t underestimate the power of healthy eating and exercise.<br /><br />You have to become a warrior mate, strong, disciplined and in control of your mind.&nbsp; Only then will you be able to carry on using meth occasionally and retain some form of decent life.<br /><br />All the best.

				I know that feeling. You have to realize that no matter how much you crave the stuff, it&#039;s not going to change anything about your shortage. You need to keep your mind in the present moment and accept it (the moment) as perfect.<br />Eckhart Tolle shows you how:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ja75T5wF1U<br />The video is a response to a severely depressed individual but the technique works for cravings too (at least for me).

				yeh thanks.. ive had addictions before.. plenty of them.. i just think this type of craving for me needed some kind of advice because meth is a different kind of love..<br /><br />with this drug i know that we see the totality of meths possibilities as a pool of quicksand and that we can take a step in, and we can take a step out of that quicksand.. but we must never think that we can just &quot;walk right in&quot; and expect to &quot;walk right out&quot; again. <br /><br />please people.. dont try this drug with a predetermined attitude that you can control your usage! and if you have such a high opinion of your strength prior to trying it that you will never consider a &quot;what if i cant&quot; then you are BONKERS! you have to have a plan b at least.<br /><br />please dont go into it saying you are just going to &quot;try it once&quot; especially if your usage has anything to do with sex or porn.<br /><br />if you ever want to give yourself a gift that may save your life please give yourself the honesty within yourself that you know any understand &quot;the denial phase&quot;.. please don&#039;t go into this shit not even realizing you are in denial! denial takes the form of thinking you can control your usage and thinking you can stop whenever you like.<br /><br /><br />thanks for the Eckhart Tolle suggestion.. seen him before.. he&#039;s a legend.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				What goes up- must come down.<br />In one way or another.<br /><br />When someone starts doing meth on a more than regular basis , it becomes..... something different.Something I dont recommend. It&#039;s a totally different world ,almost.A darker, more treacherous place where you meet new more exciting and dangerous people.<br />It is much more fun tobe an occasional user,and the key to doing that is:Not going into Desperado mode, like chasing a bag when you run out ( or about to ). Also occasionally not touching the stuff for periods of time.<br /><br />THe difference is when you abstain now and then , it&#039;s about getting high, instead of maintenanceNo one likes to come down, but it&nbsp; clears your head, and let&#039;s your body recover.<br />
