				I suffer from slight social phobia, what would be the best drug for increased sociability and confidence as well as considering all negative side effects?<br /><br />Cocaine seems to do the job for me, I remember the first time a did a line (high quality coke) I wanted to talk to everyone, the effects only lasted about 30 minutes. The only problem is the price, I get an 8-ball for $160~ mediocre quality and I can go through 1/2 that in 1 night, $80/night is a little too steep for the effects it gives me.<br /><br />Adderall does the the job too, but not as good as cocaine and it&#039;s not as smooth. It has a slower but longer duration and I get a lot more physical sides like jaw clenching. It&#039;s a lot cheaper for me though, $4 for 20mg IR.<br /><br />I was thinking of MDMA, but not sure if the effects would be too intense and people would know I was on drug.

				MDMA , if you do plz post the video on youtube :-).<br /><br />You&#039;ll be trying to say something, forget what halveway through, then start again few moments later and on and on. That is if you can stop hugging people instead of talking to them.<br />Should be great fun to watch, but i wouldnt advice it hehehe.<br /><br />Coke never worked for me, i blame the quality. I liked speed myself, but only on low doses and in the first 6 hours.<br />Most common is still to have a beers.&nbsp;

				Alcohol would work. Have you tried looking into Mephedrone? It&#039;s effects do only last ~30mins but its a hell of a lot cheaper than cocaine and very euphoric + chatty! <br />With MDMA people would likely know you&#039;re on it lol.<br />Amphetamines? Cheap but apparently the comedown is pretty bad.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as OP.&nbsp; I have social anxiety and I would like to use something to enhance my sociability at work or at social gatherings.<br /><br />So far, Xanax works GREAT for me but I try to limit my use to just 2-3 times a week since benzo withdrawal can be hellish.<br /><br />Cocaine and amphetamines would cause too much crash if used frequently so they are out of the question for me.<br /><br />I hate alcohol.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shitty drug for me, not worth the nausea and hangover.<br /><br />Low dose MDMA could be a potentially okay choice but I don&#039;t want to be rolling at work or at social gathering all by myself.<br /><br />Opiates seem to be another good option, but does it really increase sociability?&nbsp; When I tried hydrocodone, I only had good body buzz but not necessarily became outgoing or more social.<br /><br />Some people say tramadol makes them energetic and outgoing, so I might try that out soon.&nbsp; But, opinions seems to be very mixed about tramadol in general.<br /><br />I want to throw something in the mix so I can alternate with Xanax thorough out the week.<br /><br />Mephedrone seems interesting but its effects doesn&#039;t seem to last that long.

				I too have social phobia, I am self-medicating with alprazolam / valium, I seem to need about 4mg alprazolam to sort me out and then i&#039;m calm as a cucumber and can talk to anyone, but it only lasts a few hours :(

				Small doses of benzos (don&#039;t go crazy: .5-1mg should be fine of lorazepam, alprazolam, or...klonopin [I&#039;m sure I butchered spellings]) be careful when drinking if you go this route. Also, as said a little liquor can help. I find it&#039;s difficult for me to hit social drunk without stumbling into sick drunk [weak alcohol tolerance]. <br /><br />My vote is for moderate meth dosages(30mg or so snorted works well for me) or MDMA: both are hard drugs that need to be respected well and I&#039;d take it easy on the alcohol for either or but meth has me feeling more chipper and engaged with people much the same way as MDMA does--except MDMA also makes me feel loved and loving and warm and fuzzy.<br /><br />Cheers and good luck! Remember, anxiety is all in your head so if you can use drugs to help you feel sociable. After you get that success on a few occasions, believe that you can taper off your dosaging and you&#039;ll notice you are still able to talk and function because the anxiety will be less. Continue to do this until you are ready to face a social event (maybe a small one) without being on any drugs [take an emergency benzo with you for peace of mind]. <br /><br />Drugs are a great way to better your life but believe that you can ultimately make things better! The drugs are just a stepping stone!<br /><br /><br />Okay, good-feely speach over. <br /><br />Cheers!

				Hey Snoopish,<br /><br />How is the crash from meth compared to adderall?&nbsp; I feel that most of people with social anxiety should try to stay away from stimulants as it can exacerbate anxiety after the come down.<br /><br />I have tried adderall before and it did make me very euphoric and chirpy but the crash from it was just not worth it.<br /><br />I did try meth long time ago, but I don&#039;t remember crashing from it as hard as I did from adderall.&nbsp; Meth just rather kept me up and I just felt out of it for a while.<br /><br />I&#039;m not too keen on the idea of using MDMA for social anxiety since MDMA can result in depression in a lot of people after frequent use.

				MDMA if you keep it to strict moderation (~1 time a month seems to be okay for most people, at least for me I can handle 1-2 rolls a month with no long term effects.)<br /><br />MDMA is quite simply the most social drug I have taken.&nbsp; You lose all sense of self-image or social anxiety and become a complete and utter social butterfly.&nbsp; I&#039;m very introverted myself, but at my last rave I rolled and was asking random chicks if I could touch their fuzzy things, or pick them up, or just hug them, and it was amazing how accepted I felt just letting myself go and exploring my social space.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely some of them were also rolling so didn&#039;t mind, but it really opens my eyes about how my own negativity is probably the reason I feel so sketched out around strangers.<br /><br />It&#039;s a wonderful drug though, even after the magic of the night ends, you still reflect on your actions and realize that people aren&#039;t so scary after all, and maybe it would do well just to hug random strangers at parties.&nbsp; Everyone could benefit from random and consensual hugs.

				It&#039;s very hard to pick a best solution for a problem like this.<br /><br />If anxiety is the sole cause of your problem, something like xanax can be effective. Since it also has sedative properties it may not be a good recipe for a nice night out though. You can to some degree counteract the sedative properties with caffeine, but in some cases that will also bring back the original problem leaving you exactly where you started. <br /><br />Moderate amounts of alcohol seem like a good idea to me - the axiolytic effect is clear, and as long is its not so much it will impair you, it will be fine. Offering someone a drink is also part of social life, so that&#039;s an added bonus. <br /><br />Things like mdma or cocaine will surely help, but they will probably also alter your personality when you are taking them. This doesn&#039;t have to be a big problem, but it will become one if you build friendships and plan to be around the same people while not on drugs.

				1. MDMA, but it&#039;s not something that I take regularly in view of its potential neurotoxicity. It eliminates social anxiety and increases self-confidence like no other drug I&#039;ve tried. I become extremely talkative,&nbsp; empathetic, witty in conversation, and deeply interested in what other people are saying. I find it very easy to make new friends on this drug. But unless I exercise some self-restraint, it can sometimes be quite obvious that I am on something.<br /><br />2. (Dextro)amphetamine. Greatly increases social confidence while improving verbal fluency, but lacking the empathetic component of MDMA (seems even to reduce empathy).&nbsp; Unlike MDMA, I find it beneficial in virtually any social situation. The only draw-back is the come-down (which can involve irritability, aggressiveness, and depression).<br /><br />As for alcohol, I suppose it does increase my self-confidence to some extent, but it also makes me feel kind of dumb. Not really useful if you want to make a positive impression on people.<br /><br />Never tried cocaine or opiates, so can&#039;t comment.<br /><br />

				You should also consider the dose, ofcourse.<br /><br />Perhaps a lower dose of mdma will still get you the effect you like without making it obvious you are taking drugs,<br /><br />@painbow:<br /><br />That is certainly true. If you want to depend on benzo&#039;s for bascially the rest of your life is another matter though. The sedative effects will often diminish within weeks, but the withdrawal problems will not be any less if you decide to give them up after long term use. I would consider this before deciding they are the right class of drugs for you, although dependence on something commonly available does not have to be a big problem per se.

				I doubt 50mg once a week will be all that detrimental if you eventually ween yourself off of it.&nbsp; Maybe just use it as &quot;training wheels&quot; to get used to approaching people.&nbsp; But pretty sure almost no one here is qualified to give you a confident answer.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t enough study to back up a lot of the rumors.

				I hear alot of people talking about uppers and downers, but nobody talking about sythetic hormones...<br />Has anybody every tried Testosterone Suspension for social phobia? Id say just a squirt (25mg) would do the trick. and no side effects if taken just once.<br />Plus, the effect would last for hours and hours without the withdraw symptoms..<br />The first time I did steroids my confidence and sense of well-being was almost too much to handle.<br />I talked my way through work and got in trouble alot for it, which was weird because I&#039;m the quiet one.<br />I was chatting it up with every girl I saw no matter what she looked like and had 4 fuck buddy&#039;s by the end of the first week.<br />Just sayin, it might be worth taking a look at.

				I think stimulants (including MDMA) aren&#039;t good options as they will lead to comedowns that will exacerbate anxiety and introversion afterwards.<br /><br />Depressants, opiates or dissociatives may be better option if one can find the right drug and dose for them to feel comfortable in their environment without being too intoxicated. <br /><br />@psychedelia&nbsp; -&nbsp; Do you not suffer from comedowns from MDMA like you do on amphetamines?<br /><br />@JasperShopRep&nbsp; -&nbsp; I don&#039;t think most people will be interested in IM injections everytime they go into a social interaction.&nbsp; Also, the high level of ethanol (alcohol?) in test suspension hurts pretty bad for most people.&nbsp; Plus, casual injection of test will shutdown HTPA.

				I can see where JSPrep is coming from on this, but ya not too many people are interested in injecting something.

				So far I have only been snorting it for work/productivity purposes. I haven&#039;t strayed from that goal yet but it&#039;s early in my experiments. I do plan to smoke it at some point but that point keeps getting put back because I hear smoking it is really tempting with addiction.

Also, I may try to use it recreationally at some point but right now I want to limit it to work-related purposes.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t believe you didn&#039;t mention alcohol in your initial post. Why???<br /><br />Confidence and sociability? Alcohol, duh... that is exactly alcohol&#039;s primary function<br /><br />Alcohol is the correct answer to this question. I know how bad it can be, believe me, oh boy do I know. I get hungover extremely easily too, abnormally bad hangovers for me so if you are trying to avoid that, maybe you want to consider something else but if you are able to drink in a disciplined manner (aka knowing when to stop) than it will do the trick.&nbsp; It is the answer to this question which is why it is the most popular and widely available drug on planet earth...<br /><br />Benzos are also great for the purpose you describe, mainly because they target the brain in an extremely similar way to alcohol. I guess if you really suffer from &#039;social phobia&#039; (which I admittedly cannot relate to) then benzos might actually be your best bet. Or just some booze. Or some benzos and booze, but be careful with that combo...

				Yes, alcohol does the trick if you&#039;re around other drunk people, but it has never given me anything close to the level of confidence I get from stimulants. It usually just makes me want to take a nap. It doesn&#039;t really change my personality. I just slur my words and have trouble thinking clearly, but I&#039;m otherwise the same introverted person.

				Small doses of MDMA can bring about the social and empathic feelings without risking the telltale sighns of a fullblown roll.<br />Try 40-50mg<br /><br />Also low doses of 4-fa are great. Mild entacnogen effects. I find myself being interested in and contributing to conversations that otherwise would not have interested me at all (eg; woodworking). As long as you keep the doses low then no one will be able to tell. It also produces some mild stimulation, i just wouldent mix it with coffee.

				My big three would probably be<br />Alcohol - hate the next day, but it sure kills my inhibitions...I mean I kinda doubt I would have had sex on a beach surrounded by 6 other people if I was at my normal level of inhibition.<br /><br />Low dose MDMA - I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about neurotoxicity if you are taking 40-60mg every week or every two weeks. the comedown from that low a dose shouldn&#039;t be that bad either, although I guess it depends on how you personally react.<br /><br />DOx (DOB) - makes me happy and energetic for about 10-14 hours, tolerance seems to be gone after about a week, lights, colors sounds and tactile senses are all enhanced, inhibitions are lowered, and you can still speak normally, and function normally. The comedown is normally a headache (at least for me, my friends never seem to get the headache), and feeling tired the next day because of all the activities you do on it.

				Amphetamine party dose. There is currently some near 100% purity stuff on SR. The bad comedown primarily is caused by the speed cut with caffeine which is not the case with the products from Boymaster and&nbsp; CapeCrusader.<br />It&#039;s not that much of a rush like with MDMA, but it&#039;s safer.

Self-administering a IV or IM injection would probably be a bridge too far for most casual substance users. I&#039;m not saying its very hard to do or overly risky per se, but it feels like you a crossing a line no matter what. Also, i think its not a line worth crossing for the problem presented. There are plenty of options to try that only require taking something orally. <br /><br />Using something injectable also requires extreme trust in the vendor, since this basically bypasses all defense mechanisms.

				Interesting thread.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty socially retarded myself, and an extra 20mg adderall (already take 2/day by &#039;scrip) and 50-80mg mdma works all right for most social events. More mdma if it&#039;s going to be a bar/dance, as I HATE being touched. Can&#039;t really say anything with respect to comedowns/neurotoxicity; I plan on being dead by thirty anyway. <br /><br />All alcohol does is make me want to sit in a corner and hurt anyone that initiates contact, but maybe that&#039;s just me.

				Are you looking to fix your issue and eventually be drug free? Or just looking to mask it for the time being?<br /><br />I personally love self confidence more then any other effect I get from drugs. For me this has only come from speed (not adderall and shit but bikie speed here in Aus) I don&#039;t even get the confidence from coke but I have only used coke in a social scene once.

				Although I can&#039;t say i&#039;ve had a huge amount of experience with all the other suggestions I find that a low dose of LSD (25ug ish) works best for me. <br /><br />Alcohol works well sometimes but most of the time I wake up with the sensation in the back of my mind that i&#039;ve done something embarrassing. It just gives me a false sense of security, I never feel any more intelligent whilst drunk than I do sober.<br /><br />MDMA just makes me feel everything as though everything is perfect and I can talk to anyone without feeling any trace of anxiety. However, I feel I become a spiritual guru for a couple of hours but I have no urge to socialise or have a laugh with others, I just want to sit on my own and think about the world.<br /><br />A low dose of acid however has blown my mind. (this coming from someone who completely loses it whilst stoned, I become a gibbering, drooling, anxious and paranoid wreck) I&#039;ve only used low dose acid twice but both times i&#039;ve felt much more intelligent, jokes and laughter come to me like a dream, I feel as clear minded as a do on MDMA, stimulated but not overly so and there seems to be a background euphoria that you can tap into but isn&#039;t overwhelming. These benefits come with pretty much no drawbacks, I&#039;ve found acid at low doses isn&#039;t at all psychedelic and you look and act as though you are sober. <br /><br />Sleeping on low doses of acid is quite hard though, it might be 12 hours after you dose that you can finally drop off.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				I recently found out that a SMALL dose of heroin with a SMALL dose of methamphetamine is a great combo for social interactions :) The methamphetamine fuels conversation while the heroin helps with anxiety and takes the edge off the meth and the comedown :)

If you believe you have some condition that cannot be solved by &#039;just talking about it&#039;, chances are this is in fact true. Therapy could in general be useful, but not for someone in a mindset that excludes therapy as a solution. <br /><br />Sometimes it&#039;s hard to tell cause and effect apart. In moderate depression for example, you can observe an imbalance between serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain. It is, however, not completely clear if this imbalance is caused by depression, or if it the cause of depression. It is, however, known that having this imbalance will cause depression. <br /><br />The presents a situation where restoring the balance with SSRIs would seem a feasible method of treatment, regardless of the causal relationship. <br /><br />While this is a very simplified example, medical practitioners often follow such reasoning and would be inclined to choose medication over therapy as the best cause of action. Statistically it probably is, but on the other hand it will put a number of people of medications (with unpleasant side effects) that could have been avoided.

IMO drugs are used as a bandaid fix and should be taken long term. Example I have high BP and Im on two types of drugs to control it, my goal is to get physically fit and healthy and get rid of these medications. Even though my DR said that it won&#039;t have any negative effects after long term use. I call BS how can something that changes your body&#039;s reactions and functios not have effects. Anyway its my long term goal to rid my self of medication.<br /><br />Going to the gym is a snow ball effect, it doesn&#039;t matter if you dont see results immediately it will still make you feel like your arnold every time you walk out of there plus with the added bonus of releasing endorpins it will become addictive because without the gym you simply wont feel as good.<br /><br />If going to the gym is causing pain then your doing it all wrong, simple.&nbsp; Granted you might have a small amount of lactic acid build up which after a few weeks will be fine, but you don&#039;t have to train to fatigue so you should have minimal soreness and with nutrition you will be fine.<br /><br />I&#039;m no DR but aren&#039;t depression and potentially anxiety both chemical imbalances? Gym could help potentially help but will not repair a chemical imbalance.<br /><br />I have a mate who has anxiety and he has been doing self help things its called &quot;being relaxed&quot; by Dr Alan Fahey he has had great success.<br /><br />All I&#039;m saying is that IMO drugs will not fix a social issue, it will only mask it and this will lead to other problems later on down the track. I suggest counseling or therapy for a permanent more healthy fix, it may be an ongoing struggle but IMO its the only logical way.

				Going to a gym can have useful effects with social anxiety. This has very little to do with exercise itself, but you interact with people while in discomfort and such, which can be useful experiences. They could also make things worse as you are in a state you don&#039;t like to be in (sweaty, catching your breath, aching etc) while forced to interact on some level. <br /><br />Endorphins and pain go hand in hand though, if it doesn&#039;t seriously hurt it will not release useful amounts of endorphins. I suppose this is one of the reasons some people are into SM and similar activities, though that&#039;s probably far beyond the scope of the topic. Muscles acidifying will certainly count as a source of pain though, even if it not directly damaging. Its just one signal to stop whatever you are doing if you possibly can, and if you decide to ignore it and proceed increasingly painful signals will result. Overloading tendons (or even bone structural load) and such is often painful as well, but also damaging at which point you should really stop doing whatever you were doing.<br /><br />As far as drugs being unable to &#039;fix&#039; a problem: Sometimes they actually can. There is something described as the fear spiral. Firstly you get anxiety attacks in some situation, but after that you actually become afraid of having an anxiety attack, even if you somehow circumvent the original trigger. This cycle can sometimes (only) be broken by a regiment of anxiolytic medication, ssri, benzo or otherwise. <br /><br />Breaking such a cycle can sometimes be very effective: doing the exact same thing a week ago resulted in severe anxiety, while you experience little to none on medication a week later. This re-enforces the idea that the situation as such is, in fact, nothing to be afraid off, and that concept often sticks after ceasing medication. Especially medications like alprazolam allow people to undergo the same experience with and without medication within a short period of time, and leave the conclusion that the situation is not that threatening at all.

				I was more talking about cardio exercise than lifting weights, go for a 5 mile run and then tell me your anxious. Or play basketball for 3 hours or so, since running isn&#039;t that fun. You do that regularly, and stay relatively drug free, you will look good and feel good, assuming you don&#039;t have some very, very serious mental health issues that preclude you feeling good without medication, which I realize is the case for some people. (My ex girlfriend was bipolar, took Lithium)<br /><br />But really, I have some natural anxiety issues, I assume largely because of having an extremely nuerotic mother, but my anxiety is VERY manageable when I am drug free (which isn&#039;t often). But pretty much every single substance can exacerbate anxiety in one way or another, believe that.<br /><br />Granted my anxiety issues are generalized and are definitely not &#039;social anxiety&#039; so I can&#039;t really speak on that. I&#039;m cool and good looking, and am grateful for that (not trying to be an arrogant prick, seriously I am) and so I&#039;ve always had a pretty rich social life. But I have had more panic attacks than I can count, and been hospitalized a few times, mostly due to alcohol rebound shit, the vast majority of my serious anxiety episodes are drug related in some way, just sayin...

				Since pretty much every drug has been spoken for, I feel I may as well put in a vote for exercise. Don&#039;t get me wrong, exercise isn&#039;t enjoyable for everyone, but consider walking--find some parks or trails or sidewalks around where you live. It&#039;s a nice, relaxing experience that you can invite people along to join you but can also go on your own. If you go on your own, challenge yourself to approach a person or two, maybe a group and interact. Nothing big your first time out: make eye contact, smile, greet them. If they slow down, make a little small talk: weather, how they enjoy the trail. Ask them if they know other good trails or good spots to stop for scenery. If they don&#039;t slow down just pass them by or whatever. <br /><br />Give yourself small goals and meet them. Set yourself up with goals that you can succeed and work your way up: and give yourself some drug help beforehand if you want. ;)<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />@Painbow--I find doses of ~70mg MDMA is plenty for getting me to feel social for a couple hours and leaves me feeling good with no comedown. It all depends on how often you need/want to utilize it I think though.

				GBL/GHB seems to work fine. It&#039;s nothing too special but it can be pretty euphoric and it doesn&#039;t fuck you up if take it often (3-4x a week).

				Lots of people have said MDMA however if you&#039;re looking for a longer term relief of social anxiety I suggest Methylone instead, even though it&#039;s an RC. To me it feels a lot more clean than MDMA - I&#039;ve had weeks where I rolled every day on M1 ( having to increase the dosage dramatically at the end of the week - started at 150 mg a night and wound up being 400 - 500 mgs a night by the end of it ) and even after being high 24/7 on it for 10 or so days coming off of it didn&#039;t give me a hangover or make me feel bad in any way. In fact, most of the social anxiety I had had before that experienced pretty much dissappeared from my life altogether; now I have very little trouble talking to people or conversing and I only do M1 every week or so when I&#039;m going out to a place with a lot of people I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve met a lot of good friends on it, and I personally love the stuff. Although it does have the tendency to keep you up at night - I slept maybe an hour a day when I was on it for a long period of time. That being said, I didn&#039;t feel tired at all because I was so high, but you do start to feel your body becoming taxed after a week or so.<br /><br />Altogether though, it&#039;s a nicer experience than MDMA, to me at least. More calm, less side effects. Mixing Methylone along with 25i-NBOMe led to some very personal revelations about myself as well. Very easy to psychoanalyze yourself with those chemicals. <br /><br />Anyway, hope you find something to help you out! I suffered for a long time with that sorta thing... I know how horrible it can be.

But it hurts like hell and the drip is ungodly. If I&#039;m alone I plug it - it&#039;s WONDERFUL like that, however a lot of people aren&#039;t into plugging... I crush it up and put it in a vegan gelcap and it dissolves pretty quickly and you come up in 30 - 40 minutes. It&#039;s great, too, a lot more euphoric and empathogenic when plugged too. Oral gives a similar feeling. Snorting it however just gives me a speedy amphetamine feeling for the most part, although that&#039;s not to say that the euphoria and empathy isn&#039;t there. But if I wanted it speedy, i&#039;d go and get adderall and take that.<br /><br />One thing about methylone that I&#039;ve experienced is it ranges dramatically in quality between different batches. I&#039;ve had Nevita&#039;s M1 and it was amazing, but the M1 I got locally was absolute shite in comparison. But my dealer is pretty sketchy so he probably cut it with something. Hahaha.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, exercise isn&#039;t enjoyable for everyone, but consider walking--find some parks or trails or sidewalks around where you live. It&#039;s a nice, relaxing experience that you can invite people along to join you but can also go on your own. If you go on your own, challenge yourself to approach a person or two, maybe a group and interact. Nothing big your first time out: make eye contact, smile, greet them. If they slow down, make a little small talk: weather, how they enjoy the trail. Ask them if they know other good trails or good spots to stop for scenery. If they don&#039;t slow down just pass them by or whatever. <br /><br />Give yourself small goals and meet them. Set yourself up with goals that you can succeed and work your way up: and give yourself some drug help beforehand if you want. ;)<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />@Painbow--I find doses of ~70mg MDMA is plenty for getting me to feel social for a couple hours and leaves me feeling good with no comedown.
