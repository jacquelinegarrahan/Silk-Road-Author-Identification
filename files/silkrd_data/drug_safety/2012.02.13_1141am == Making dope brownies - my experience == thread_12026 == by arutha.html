				I did tons of research on this before starting, and was involved in at least one thread a month or so back on here. The most recommended method was to use a saucepan of water, melt some butter in it, and simmer for up to 6 hours then refrigerate overnight to separate the weed butter from the water. Tried and true, I&#039;m sure it works well.<br /><br />However, I wanted a much faster method that I could do in an afternoon. I also didn&#039;t want to make up a huge batch using half an ounce or more as many recipes describe. And I wanted it to be dead easy. So if you have never cooked with weed before, hopefully this thread is a nice start.<br /><br />I used Betty Crocker&#039;s Triple Choc Fudge brownie mix as a starting point, which tasted fantastic. The recipe calls for 1/4 cup of oil, 2 Tbs water and 2 eggs. The quarter cup oil was to be my starting point.<br /><br />My research has lead me to a ratio of 450g butter for every ounce of weed as the optimum. Thats about 16g of butter for every gram of weed. A quarter cup is 60g, so I chose about 2-2.5g of weed. Use more if you have low quality weed.<br /><br />First thing was to make sure the weed is super dry so you can chop it up really really fine. The smaller it is, the more THC you will extract. I put it all in a bowl, broke it up a bit, then put it in the oven on defrost setting (~30oC) for 20 minutes. Then I spent a while chopping it up fine. <br /><br />Now, here is where I got a bit creative. Cooking straight in oil it is very difficult to judge the temperature, and easy to burn the weed. Thats why water with melted butter is used - water will keep it all around 100oC. In a small saucepan I placed the oil, weed, and 4 tablespoons of water. Keep the heat quite low, probably as low as your stove will go. Mine has a scale of 1-9 heat (4 is about right for spaghetti) and I changed between 1 and 3 depending on what it was doing.<br /><br />The water is going to go a bit crazy in the oil and bubble. You want it to bubble, but not a lot. Basically if you can&#039;t safely hold your hand just inside the saucepan without hot water jumping up, its too hot so lower it. The gentle bubbling tells you it is at 100oC though, and the water helps keep it there. In effect a miniature version of water and butter.<br /><br />The water is going to completely evaporate, so put a lid on it to keep it going longer, but let it evaporate. Should take about 45 minutes to evaporate (you will be able to tell because the bubbling doesn&#039;t happen anymore and steam will stop coming out) and over that time, you should give it a small stir every 15 mins or so. Take a few deep breathes of it, you will get a very nice energetic buzz! :)<br /><br />Now, place another 3-4 Tbs of water in and repeat the same thing; simmer it until the water has boiled out. Make sure you are adding hot water though, and add it carefully. Hot oil and cold water do not like each other.<br /><br />At that point, I stopped. If you wanted to extract more from the weed, I am sure you could add more water and do it again. Important part (for the recipe anyway) is to boil the water out.<br /><br /><br />From there, I used a fine sieve to run the oil through and get the weed out. Make sure you squeeze it a lot to get as much oil out as possible. Also put the oil straight into the bowl you are using to mix the brownies. Make it the first thing to go in though just in case weed gets through and you need to remove it or filter again. As the recipe called for 2 Tbs of water, I ran that over the weed in the sieve as well to extract even more of the THC oil.<br /><br />Then, just follow what the packet says. Add the powder and eggs, mix it up well, cook for about 25 minutes. Important note about temperature; the packet says 170oC for the oven I think, you don&#039;t want the temp to go above 160oC or the THC starts to break down. I set my oven at 150oC and found no problem, cooking time was about the same.<br /><br /><br />All up, from weighing weed to cooling brownies, was probably about 3-4 hours. Also very easy; most of the time was just letting it do its thing while I did other stuff.<br /><br /><br />About the smell for those that it matters; it produces a very strong smell while the oil is cooking. Something like a mixture of popcorn and crisps I think. Not like weed at all, but strange enough that anyone who smelt it would ask what it was. Keep the fan on and windows open. The brownies just smell like normal brownies, and it is an amazing smell that easily overtook the previous smell.<br /><br />About the high, my gf and I had 1.5 each and within 30 minutes we were couchlocked; stupidly high. Put on some music to up the energy and had a great night! Next night I had 3-4 but it was hard to tell how high I got just from them since I was smoking as well; we stayed really high for a good 5-6 hours though.

				Nice write up mate! good read<br /><br />As you know I want to make some edibles soon, waiting to buy some trim if I can to do it<br /><br />Although I&#039;m very tempted (today especially as it happens) to do like you did just use 2g or so for a personal 1 time use<br /><br />Could do butter or olive oil, not sure if its a waste of good weed though<br /><br />2g would normally last me at least 3 days of getting high, and its in one experience so would have to be a good one! but the 16g butter to 1g weed ratio was very helpful

				Thanks a lot for the write up! I will try this for sure. Been looking into edibles for a long time, but there&#039;s not been much to choose from here on SR.

				No worries, glad it was useful. :)<br /><br />And I knew I had forgotten to add something as I was posting, but didn&#039;t remember until now. Can the cooked weed still be used after? I expect I didn&#039;t extract all THC from it so probably yes. However, you would need to be very careful to make sure all the oil was drained away from it. Smoking cooking oil would not be pleasant. I ran water over it in the sieve for 10 minutes and am now drying it, I&#039;ll have to see if I can detect any oil still stuck to it. Otherwise might be able to cook it again.
