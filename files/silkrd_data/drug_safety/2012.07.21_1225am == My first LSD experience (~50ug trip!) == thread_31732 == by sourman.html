				For my first time, we went to a place out in the woods that we&#039;ve only been to a few times. We had a great day hiking, fishing, exploring, etc. and at the end of the night, my friend and I split a single tab down the middle and popped the cid as we sat around a bonfire with a bunch of other people. Keep in mind that this was supposedly a 100ug tab, from momiji right here on SR. We both tripped balls for around 10-12 hours from those halves.<br /><br />The tabs were miniscule, had no taste, and did not take effect instantly, so I doubt it was a RC. I remember seeing the embers at the bottom of the fire begin to form shapes and figures. At this point, it felt like I &quot;smoked 10,000 joints&quot;, to quote another trip report, but it did not feel like I took anything new. Before I knew it, I was staring into the base of that fire, checking out the skulls and endless caves to hell as the stars above me would shoot apart and then contract across the night sky. My briefcase would &quot;feel&quot; small, and then &quot;grow&quot; to normal size despite it looking the same to me visually. Everything was profound and felt new, like I was a little kid again. Everything was bright, kind of like my internal &quot;digital vibrance&quot; and highlights settings were set higher. Music was intensified in a way similar to cannabis, but the experience was way stronger and more profound. We began making fun of new rap lyrics and then sitting around solemnly listening to old Biggie tracks while passing around a spliff. Did I mention we smoked like 3 blunts of AAA medical bud plus honey oil? I also drank the equivalent of a two cups of vodka. Perhaps that had something to do with the intensity of the this trip?<br /><br />After we got back to our room, shit really started getting freaky. Paintings would melt and change into other paintings, reflections in the mirror looked like a window to another time and place. Then we got to talking about the government and how it brainwashed the older generations into thinking LSD and weed were these terrible substances. After getting sad and freaking out for a bit, we regained our composure and continued to avoid the introspective parts of the trip. At this point, I noticed a purple tint to some things in my visual field that were out of focus, and all those songs with lyrics referencing a &quot;purple haze&quot; started to make sense. I then became conscious of the roller coaster type feeling in my gut that was ongoing for the past 6-8 hours. It was like smoking 7g of bud to the face as your first time, then sitting backwards in a reclining chair with your eyes closed. Remember that face tingling and falling backwards in a roller coaster feeling you felt the first time you got high? That&#039;s what it felt like, except it didn&#039;t stop and I didn&#039;t have to lay back or close me eyes. My friend, who is more experienced with psychedelics but never took LSD, said the roller coaster thing reminded him of 2 C-I. He was actually freaking out more than I was at this point.<br /><br />Although the effects wore off about 12 hours after administration, we both got flashbacks for the next day or two. I took a tramadol the following evening and it almost brought the trip back, which makes sense given the seratogenic effects of both drugs. Just don&#039;t ever take tramadol and LSD in the same 24 hour period. After 3 days, all effects were completely gone. I am still the same person as before, with no changes to my personality or sanity. No HPPD either. I learned a few things and got to experience some shit I never felt before, but it did not change my life at all. Then again, despite the fact that I personally feel as if I tripped balls, this was still a tiny dose.<br /><br />But yeah, that&#039;s about all I remember of that night. As awesome and weird as the trip was, it still felt oddly familiar. Perhaps that&#039;s why I don&#039;t feel any different. Remember when you were young and everything was still new and impressive; back when you&#039;d notice scary things in your room at night while looking at shadows and objects in the dark? It was like returning to an even more exciting rendition of those days with the knowledge and maturity of my adult self. I am definitely going to do more LSD. It&#039;s like weed when you first start smoking, except far more intense and profound. And that was just half of a 100ug tab.

				...well, that definitely doesn&#039;t sound like 50mcg.&nbsp; Pretty sure you had several times that amount.&nbsp; So whatever your source is, stick with them, as those sound like some good tabs.

				It definitely does not. I wish the vendor (momiji) was still around. IIRC, he sold a bunch of tony&#039;s acid over the 4/20 sale and then quit. I ordered that single tab for $12... best twelve bucks I ever spent. Now I have to buy at least a 5 strip, which I wouldn&#039;t mind actually now that I know how awesome LSD is.

				Well, it certainly did feel similar to trip reports I read in the past. I guess I had a typical experience. The only thing I took from another report was the &quot;10,000 joints&quot; line. Again, this was what happened when I took half a tab of momiji&#039;s acid along with some weed and liquor. Believe it or not...

				Tends to happen when smoking large amounts of marijuana. Glad you had an interesting first experience.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tripped super hard off half a tab myself, but my friend and I did smoke tons that day.

It seems like he experienced too much from the other substances and not enough of the LSD. I know we&#039;re all different and experience things uniquely from one another, but shit...I&#039;ve take 50µg just as a basic Nootropic in college. ;D Definitely not anything special enough to write about. I mean without being too specific I weigh around 120lbs and am well above 6&#039;3 in height so obviously I&#039;m more sensitive than everyone when it comes to drugs, so unless he&#039;s younger than 23 and still developing or somehow capable of being thinner than me there&#039;s no way the majority of that trip was due to LSD. It sounds like the LSD just greatly amplified the alcohol and marijuana which is a damn shame. :-\<br /><br />There&#039;s always the possibility the tabs were well above 100µg though, but there&#039;s no way to tell and either way he had a blast so whatever. :P I can confirm that Placebo effect can be quite profound on it&#039;s own as well. Either way I just really really want him to try a bigger dose is all, I&#039;m a bitch like that. ;)<br /><br />+1 for the wicked trip report broseph. ^-^

				It could definitely have been more than a 100ug tab, and it&#039;s also possible that smoking tons of weed and drinking contributed to whatever I felt. At first, it really did feel like I was just drunk and very, very high. Then it kind of went &quot;beyond&quot; the shallow weed high into melting objects, super intensified colors, patterns coming to life, stars in the sky moving around, objects breathing, etc. As high as I&#039;ve been, I never actually witnessed patterns in objects turn into the things I imagined them to be. lol. It&#039;s very had to describe or even remember some of these things. Had I been sober, it would probably have been easier to recall the event.<br /><br />I&#039;m not particularly tall (at least not in the 6&#039;3 range) but I&#039;m way over 120lbs and in good shape. My friend is around your size and 150lbs. He did seem to be tripping harder than I was, but not by much. I guess the only way to find out is to do MOAR. Now that I found a few reputable vendors in the LSD thread, all I gotta do is buy the damn btc (gonna be fun with the rampant deflation) and wait for a suitable listing. I plan on doing at least 100ug this time, so whatever tab I get is going down whole this time as long as it&#039;s under 150ug. Only reason I split up the first one is so I wouldn&#039;t be tripping alone for my first time (and I kinda owed that person). Now that I got a taste of it, I&#039;m willing to sit down and try a real trip at home with no adulterants other than a little bit of bud.

				All three times I tried LSD, it didn&#039;t work at all :(<br /><br />The first time was half a tab, smoked load of duub, nothing...<br /><br />The second time was at the IMAX, had a 150ug tab and I felt a feeble &quot;mushroom like&quot; wavyness to everything but that was it.<br />I also felt a strange body sensation I find hard to explain, almost like &quot;feeling&quot; the water in your own body and this was 10h after dropping<br /><br />The third time was two days ago, I dropped two 150ug tabs and again, I felt nothing noteworthy. WTF? Am I not meant to experience LSD?!<br /><br />Last night, I tried 2C-B (out of frustration) because I had some left in my drawer. I had some amazing CEV!

				I&#039;ve tripped a few time on acid and weed was always a game changer. Every trip I had was moderately intense until I smoke some decent weed and get really nutty. If I don&#039;t smoke during a trip its way less visual.
