				Hey folks,<br />Lately i&#039;ve noticed that tolerance with the NBOME series (in my case 25-c NBOME) has a significantly less period to diminish, for example i dosed 2 days after a trip (both on 1005 ug 25c) and felt the effects nearly as potently as the first time. <br />I was just posting this to see what other people had to say about NBOME tolerance and whether they are experiencing the same thing as i am, because these are relatively new research chemicals it&#039;s hard to find accurate information on topics such as tolerance.<br />I was also wondering whether there is cross tolerance between psychedelics. For example if you were to take a medium dose of lsd and take shrooms the next day, would there be tolerance build up or would there be no tolerance due to shrooms&#039; active ingredient being psylocybin?<br />Thanks people.<br /><br />Evelynn op needs nerf<br />&nbsp;

				Interesting ... saw some talk on bluelight that 25-I was leaving people with some pretty serious tolerance, as much as two weeks before *total* reset in the most drastic cases.&nbsp; If we recall correctly, this included cross-tolerance with classic psychedelics.<br /><br />There is definitely cross-tolerance between mushrooms and acid.&nbsp; Different active molecules, but their effect on the serotonergic system would seem to be rather similar.&nbsp; This varies a bit between individuals, but the general rule of thumb we&#039;ve heard is that if tripping on successive days, double the dose is required the second day to get the same level of effects produced on the first.

				It&#039;s really a question of how the &quot;tolerance&quot; works exactly. Is it that you&#039;re body builds up a quick defense to the point where the molecule will no longer cross the blood brain barrier with high affinity for a little while or is it that the actual receptors have a decreased threshold potential for those molecules. <br /><br /><br />Most psycs work on similar receptors regardless of the molecule (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychedelic_drugs). so the 25i have main effects on similar receptors as LSD. I really wish I could find the study I read a while ago that detailed the action of many psycs on different receptor sites. It showed that psychedelics are not nearly as selective as once thought and the differences in the effects are most likely due to the activity on other receptor sites. Some even work on histamine sites which I found interesting.
