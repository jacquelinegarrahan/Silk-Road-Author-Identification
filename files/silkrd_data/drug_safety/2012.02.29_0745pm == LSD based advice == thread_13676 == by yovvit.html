				so after ordering for my first time from SR and getting over the disbelief when it actually arrived, I&#039;m gonna try acid, also for the first time, this Saturday. I used to do a load of weed but it sort of killed my motivation towards everything so I stopped it, and LSD obviously isn&#039;t going to be a regular thing for me but it sounds awesome, I&#039;ve barely stopped thinking about it since it arrived&nbsp; ;D.<br /><br />I was just wondering if anyone could give me any advice whatsoever, be it dos or dont&#039;s, music to listen to, films to watch etc.<br /><br />cheers guys,<br />yovvit.

				don&#039;t-----stress<br />do-------have fun<br /><br />remember, LSD can be whatever you want it to be! The human mind is capable of so many things, and LSD allows you to experience them in ways you can&#039;t imagine. Set and setting are key.<br /><br />music and movies...will be easier to connect with IMO, so whatever movies/music you are in to will be just that much better.<br /><br />and last, you only get one first time, so don&#039;t shy away from the experience!

				I bought a WoW blotter from TheEmporium, a UK based seller. His packaging was great, and he was very communicative, great vendor overall. I&#039;m only going to have 1 blotter, and although he said he wasn&#039;t certain about the dosage, they&#039;re around 150ug, which allegedly is alright for a first-timer :)

				i love just listening to music and kicking back, watching smoke from incense curl and dance while getting lost in my thoughts. <br /><br />if you start feeling anxious, just remember lsd has an amazing safety profile, is essentially completely non-toxic, and although you may feel like you are completely losing your mind (in a good way, but it definitely can get draining), dont forget its just the drug and you WILL return to normal after some time.

Also candles ( just place them so that they would be safe burning there if you went outside and forget them)<br />&nbsp;I would also put all my plants in sight/near me. Release your inner child and just use imagination and do whatever you want to make a most safe place in the universe withstanding postmans dropping mail and nuclear wars :D

				If you generally enjoy drawing or painting etc, I would have some paper and supplies out and easily accessible. Once tripping even digging through a closet for some markers can seem like an utterly daunting task at some more intense points. <br /><br />For example, the first few times tripping on acid, packing bowls was particularly difficult, the little pieces of weed are crawling all around the table and you cant distinguish if you got all of it in the bowl, or if theres specks all over the table, and then why its all over your lap, and well... you get the idea. <br /><br />Some of my favorite things to do are look through books like really colorful and detailed book about the milky way galaxy... or one of Dali&#039;s paintings. Lots of amazing images to get lost in and they are perfect catalysts for getting your brain off wandering through previously inaccessible passages of the universe. <br /><br />I always enjoy fruit juices, some of the flavors are so incredibly overwhelming its surprising and unbelievably satisfying. Personal preference really. <br /><br />If you ever get the chance, swimming is an incredible experience just fyi, being under water and the tactile sensations are incredible (or even a shower) <br /><br />You really dont need anything to make your environment more trippy, the thing about acid is it just promotes this child like sense of wonder and even the most mundane and uninteresting objects become more fascinating that one could ever imagine. Simply examining all the various textures of a room could drive one mad. The main thing is just to make your environment comfortable for you. <br /><br />If you do start to become uncomfortable while tripping or become focused on something and need to distract yourself, simply get up and turn the lights on, change the song, or move to a new room and the entire feeling and attitude of the trip will change. <br /><br />You will have a great time!

				I suppose my hopes were slightly too high, I just feel really stoned. My pupils are dilated, my jaw, my gums and under my tongue where I had the blotter have been aching since it was I dropped it. It&#039;s a possibility that as I started to eat pizza right before I put the blotter in my mouth it was less potent or something.. When I was coming up I was listening to strobe by deadmau5 and that was great, time was going really slow and I just felt euphoric in general. Since then there have been moments where I actually doubted that I was tripping so.. I&#039;ll try and sum it up.<br /><br />t00: put blotter in my mouth, much smaller than i expected. I left it in for 5 minutes then swallowed, and I was obliged to eat more pizza as my friend&#039;s dad hadn&#039;t left yet he was expecting me to. <br /><br />t+45 minutes: pupils began to dilate slightly as noticed by my friend, I couldn&#039;t feel anything though<br /><br />t+1 hour: started listening to deadmau5 on my ipod, was laying on the sofa with my friend&#039;s dog, felt like our hearts were beating as one haha. Also felt like the lamp was the source of everything good in the world.<br /><br />t+75 minutes: lamp began to scare me, asked my friend to turn it off, I began to laugh quite a lot randomly<br /><br />t+90 minutes: walking around, legs felt really heavy as did my arms, I ate some ice cream and it was very strange in my mouth. I was euphoric and my mood was lifted. As I waved my phone in front of my face it left a light trail which was pretty cool.<br /><br />t+3 hours: went to the park and met up with a couple of others, shared a joint which didn&#039;t affect me much, just made me laugh even more, had some odd theory about circles. Walked to town and my friends got chicken and I was laughing loads still.<br /><br />t+4 hours: went to my friend&#039;s girlfriend&#039;s house and sat and felt weird and once again laughed randomly and said weird shit<br /><br />t+5 hours: first sign of proper visuals.. I was looking up at the moon and after a while it morphed into a cats eye and kept changing colour<br /><br />t+6 hours: has just gone, more of above, feeling super stoned..<br /><br />barely any open eye visuals and no closed eye visuals at all. Either 150(ish)ug isn&#039;t what people make it out to be, OR it wasn&#039;t 150ug.<br /><br />thoughts?<br />

				@MailMaxDev: Still don&#039;t feel at baseline after 2 weeks? Yikes! I&#039;d say you&#039;re experiencing symptoms of HPPD, or perhaps were having a flashback whilst staring at your carpet.<br /><br />@yovvit: You probably just had a weak blotter. Low-dose trips kind of suck, in my opinion. Just make me feel wired and strange for 12 hours, with nothing really enlightening or profound about the experience. Take at least 2 blotters next time and see how you like that.

				I&#039;m not an expert, but I&#039;d say it&#039;s probably not full-blown HPPD or anything to worry about, perhaps just a mild symptom of it. It&#039;ll probably go away with time.<br /><br />The same thing happens to me randomly when I stare at stuff occasionally, but it&#039;s not debilitating or anything.

				sorry if i got your expectations too high,&nbsp; i would probably say they were just kinda week too. its definitely not all about the visuals, its largely the mind-fuck too but seems like it took a long time to get going.<br /><br />some people fast before psychedelics, and some may say you didnt trip quite as hard because you were eating as you dropped. I hold blotter in my mouth for a long time too and have never experienced discomfort. <br /><br />who did you get the blotter from? has it been confirmed as legit lsd?

				Hey yovvit, how much research did you do into LSD before dropping? I&#039;m not having a go, just curious because this reminds me of my first time (180 ug from a reputable vendor right here on SR) especially with the visuals.<br /><br />Personally, reading things like Erowid had me thinking that dose would be a mind blowing experience, but after dropping I realised my expectations were far above reality.<br /><br />I will clarify that I&#039;m not ripping on Erowid either. The advice and experiences there helped when I worked up roughly 1000 ug. That was a night to remember.... ;P<br /><br />As for philosophical/outlandish/unconventional thought patterns, I think this is a lot more subtle than most people make it out to be. From my experience I didn&#039;t get much of this at all, even on high doses. By that I mean my thought patterns didn&#039;t change noticeably which I put down to 2 things; 1) I have a natural tendency to think unconventionally sober, and; 2) the changes I did notice were definitely subtle. Enjoyable, but you needed to know what you were looking for to recognize them (which is good advice for the visuals actually.)<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this might help should you be planning another session. If you are you may want to consider not eating right away so that it comes up quicker (but that&#039;s just me.)

				@spunkaroo I did loads of research, I was interested it in a year ago and began researching, but couldn&#039;t get my hands on it. One day a fortnight ago I began to read Steve Jobs&#039; biography and got very interested again, and the day after that I found Silk Road (or did Lucy find me? haha ;)). After I went to bed at 3am, I started getting lots of visuals, really bad tracers and looking at my hands they would swirl and ripple, and I couldn&#039;t sleep at all till 6. I got back ache so I had to lay looking up dead straight which was quite uncomfortable. When I did get to sleep, I woke up at about half 9, feeling normal(ish) but my pupils were still dilated.<br /><br />@microRNA now that it&#039;s wore off, looking back it was actually really fucking awesome (apart from the annoying ache in my mouth/jaw), so even if it was weak I&#039;m very excited to try more around the 300/400ug range. Based on what I said previously about not being able to sleep, and the visuals I got then, it was certainly LSD, other people have also confirmed.<br /><br />@blockrockinbeats it did make me feel weird for 12 hours, but it was a good weird. I&#039;m definitely looking forward to taking your advice and having two blotters.<br /><br />thanks everyone for the replies :D

What I mean by &quot;safe&quot;--is that people won&#039;t fuck with you on your trip just &quot;for fun&quot;<br />First time I tripped, did so with my next door neighbor in College...and his roommate was trying to fuck with me--kept getting in my face like &quot;BLAHHHHH, the boogie man&quot;...just shit like that....I&#039;m trying to relax and watch the worms crawl across the ceiling to the beat of the music. <br /><br />Just know, it&#039;s natural to have Anxiety when you first start tripping (if you&#039;ve never done it)---because when the trip starts...it comes it little bits (before you start tripping balls)---so you&#039;ll see &quot;little things&quot; happen--and wonder &quot;is it the drug, can&#039;t be the drug, I&#039;m not tripping yet&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;d also advise being around someone that&#039;s done it several times before...In case you have a bad trip, they&#039;ll know how to handle you. And no, you&#039;re not gonna jump off any 20-story buildings....or set yourself on fire----stupid Propaganda footage. <br /><br />All a bad trip is you get super Anxious and you want &quot;off the ride&quot;----but you can&#039;t...so you get kinda &quot;Panicky&quot;--so if you have a trusted friend that knows how to &quot;chill you out&quot;---it&#039;s all good (example, had a friend I did it with...was my 4/5th time...I actually had him there as he had done it 100&#039;s of times <br /><br />Well because my buddy is 6&#039;2&#039; 300+ lb and he wanted to do it..and if shit went side ways...I wanted &quot;the expert&quot; there&nbsp; to help talk him down (as my buddy could snap me in two---if he went Psycho). <br /><br />Anyway-turns out I had to talk my buddy off the cliff---I knew Dead Music would help him...so just talked him into listening to the Dead in my car (friends driveway)...and all was well. <br /><br />Don&#039;t know if this is a wives tale or not (my 100-tripper buddy)--said if you drink Orange Juice---it heightens your trip....not sure....Was definitely the best trip I ever had.....but not sure the Orange Juice helped or not (can&#039;t hurt). <br /><br />Ironically

				Well yovvit, I&#039;m not sure if anyone said this already, because I only skimmed through the other posts, but I&#039;m pretty sure I didn&#039;t see anyone say this. I feel like you were a little bit underwhelmed because you took such a small dose. 150ug isn&#039;t much really, just getting your feet wet, so to speak.<br /><br />I took 4 hits my first trip, and it was at least 400ug, probably more, but definitely not less. I say this because 1 hit of that acid would give me nice visuals and a great trip, so it was at least 100ug a tab, but again, probably more in all honesty. It was clean white-on-white blotters, and let me tell you man...it fucking BLEW my mind. I completely understood the 60&#039;s and hippies, and how/why LSD had such a huge impact. I wasn&#039;t underwhelmed/disappointed at all. It was magical. I felt so happy, so alive, so fresh...ah man I really hope I&#039;ll be able to feel that again before the world ends in December. ::) :D<br /><br />I had really strong visuals too, but one of the best parts of the trip was the laughter. I don&#039;t think I had laughed that hard before at any time in my life. It was different laughter too. It made me feel so genuinely happy,&nbsp; because it wasn&#039;t just that I thought something was funny so I laughed, it was that I was so happy with myself and life in general, that all I could do was laugh as an expression of pure happiness. I wasn&#039;t even laughing at anything most of the time, and whenever I would realize that, that I&#039;m not even laughing AT anything, I would laugh even harder. Ah man, so beautiful. Remember that. Good LSD makes you laugh like you&#039;ve never laughed before. You also have to dose high enough though for that to happen. I&#039;m not so sure that 150ug is enough for that. I never remember laughing that much on 1 tab trips.<br /><br />That&#039;s one of the criteria I base my judgement of the quality of LSD I get on. If it doesn&#039;t make me laugh a deep, genuine laughter, that refreshes my being, then I usually reach the conclusion that it was low quality LSD. Of course there&#039;s many other factors as well, though.<br /><br />So basically what I&#039;m saying is, that&#039;s kind of how an LSD experience is supposed to be. If you feel underwhelmed, or like your expectations weren&#039;t met, then you didn&#039;t dose high enough. Because when you dose right, you KNOW you dosed right. ;) There&#039;s no lingering questions,&nbsp; unmet expectations, or uncertainty as to whether or not you had a proper trip, just pure bliss and happiness, and a feeling of contentment, knowing that you definitely just had an LSD experience.

				@2012NewTimes2012 I had a blotter, but I think as robotzombies said it was just too low a dose.<br /><br />@robotzombies the only reason I went by 150ug was because of the dosing suggestions on erowid.. which I guess are mostly incorrect. Next time I have it I&#039;m definitely gonna go at least 300ug, possibly 400ug like you said, but by no means was what I experienced bad, it was just a little underpowered I suppose. <br />Would you suggest when I take this slightly higher dose that I do it alone? Or with friends I know and trust..
