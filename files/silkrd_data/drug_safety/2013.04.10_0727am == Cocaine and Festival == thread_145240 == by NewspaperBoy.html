				There is a festival coming up that I will be going to goes for around 10-11 hours. Have 1g of Loyds Charlie that I will be having I am wondering if its better to save it for the last 6 or so hours, does Charlie lose its potency the longer you ingest? Have done Charlie numerous other times but nothing close to 10 on it.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />NpB

Are you planning on eating the cocaine or snorting it? I&#039;ve heard eating it works. Never tried it, but I can&#039;t imagine it would be anywhere near as good as snorting it.<br />Cocaine + Music festivals aren&#039;t the best idea. Cocaine has a short high and you&#039;ll have to be topping up all the time. Because music festivals usually don&#039;t have many toilets, and you can&#039;t snort cocaine in public, it would be very difficult to do. However if you do use cocaine at the festival, I&#039;d recommend using it in the last few hours because yes, every line of coke you have after the first few will be weaker than the last. Also you will feel very tired and fatigued after it wears off and you don&#039;t really want that for the ending of a music festival.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend amphetamine &amp;/or MDMA for a music festival. Their highs last a lot longer and are more suitable for music festivals because you don&#039;t need to keep having more.<br />For music festivals in the past, I&#039;ve found my favourite thing is to have amphetamine in the morning before the music festival, and as that is wearing away as it heads into the evening I have MDMA. I wish Icould take MDMA for the entire thing, but MDMA isn&#039;t really made for using over an 11-12 hour period. 6 hours is probably the most you&#039;d get from MDMA. After that when you top up, it will be a lot weaker and the comedown will be harsh.<br /><br />Be careful though because mixing 2 stimulants can be dangerous and some people cope better than others with speedy drugs.

				Yes I have used cocaine a number of times used the wrong word should be snorting. I usually take MDMA + Combos this will be my first festival not to take it I want a break from the substance, every festival I over do it and end up not remembering most of the day&nbsp; :P and this one I want to remember. <br /><br />I have a powder snuffer so taking it in public won&#039;t be an issue just trying to gauge when to start to have the best time possible, thinking 6 hours on will have plenty of rack hopefully as it is good quality.<br /><br />

Here in Australia, getting into a music festival is like getting into an airport. Loads of police with sniffer dogs, metal detectors, etc. People have to get so creative to get their drugs in! It does more harm than good anyway because people try and take 10 hours worth of MDMA just before they walk in. Seen it countless times.<br /><br />Yea the last 5-6 hours would probably be about right. Have you used amphetamine before? It&#039;s similar to cocaine. Not as euphoric, a bit more speedy but it lasts for a very long time. SO you could have it for the entire 11 hour music festival.

				Yeh it can be hard there are ways to get personal amounts into the festivals just have to know the right ways&nbsp; ;). <br /><br />I have had what I was told to be &quot;Gas&quot; a few times which is some sort of watered down amphetamine from what I know but apart from that no. I want to stick with something Iv had experience with for this festival so I&#039;m not let down but it&#039;s on my list of substances I want to try.

Enjoy the festival! Festival season just finished here in Australia :-(<br /><br />Gas is a nickname for speed. I&#039;d recommend trying Amphetamine. I&#039;m not sure where your from, but in Europe and the US the street speed is very low purity. I&#039;d recommend getting some from BoyMaster if you ever want to try it. 1 gram is about $30 I think. Cheaper if you buy bulk. 1 gram would be 20 doses for a beginner. And it lasts a very long time. If you were at a music festival, you&#039;d probably start with 50mg at midday and then have another ~30mg or so at 6pm and that&#039;d keep you going through the night and until the next morning. It lasts a lot longer than MDMA and weed or a benzo (xanax, etc) is good for the comedown. Never use more than 100mg at one time unless you have a high tolerance.
