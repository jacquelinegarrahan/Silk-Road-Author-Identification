				May sound like a daft idea, but I am wondering if there is anything that is very harmless when snorted (or least harmful), even good for you , that can be used to pad out high purity cocaine. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t for cutting to sell, but to make the powder easier to use for myself and friends.&nbsp; Used to street stuff normally, so big fat lines.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want that, just some ideas.&nbsp;

				just made smaller lines in the end - which is obviously the best thing to do, but they can be fiddley and more risk of losing I guess.<br /><br />

				The come down on coke that&#039;s been cut seems to be worse compared to purer stuff. Isotol is normally what I see used a lot. It&#039;s also the reason some old heads get the urge to take a crap when they smell coke since it is sold as baby laxative. Creatine can be used also, but I wouldn&#039;t risk it since different manufacturers mix in other bs with their creatine that can cause some serious burning when snorted. The isotol cut is what *soin* used to re-rock coke into bricks back in his more adventurous days.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t laugh but I&#039;ve used mannitol to add a little cut to my own stash.&nbsp; If I&#039;m using a bullet, it&#039;s partly to stretch out the supply but also to keep my intake down a bit.&nbsp; Crazy sounding, but it&#039;s psychological I suppose.<br /><br />Mannitol is a sugar and doesn&#039;t bother my sinuses but we&#039;re not talking 50/50 cut...more like adding 5-10% to the stash.<br /><br />BF

				Pardon if this is not helpful, but I would suggest if you want to reduce the potency the best thing to do is reduce the volume you are consuming.<br /><br />Putting things up your nose isnt any better for you than putting things in your eye.&nbsp; Therefore it seems natural to me that if you are intent on putting something up your nose you should put the lowest amount possible to get have the desired affect.<br /><br />If you had a desire to get a different effect I could see adding another compound, but since your desire is just to reduce the affect this can be done by reducing the amount of coke you snort.<br /><br />-tt<br /><br />

				inositol <br /><br />Smells like coke and everyone uses it can be bought at any GNC<br /><br />anything that generally ends with itol is safe dont buy it online! unless its only a very small amount<br /><br />Ive heard of people using -cane cuts for added numbness but this isnt as easy to source
