				the venders on local bitcoins know that there is no place to put reference numbers on bank deposit slips, so thats why you should be in contact with them. If you click &#039;marked transaction as complete&#039; and they see a 200$ deposit just before that, they know its you.<br /><br />If you want to be extra careful, do an odd number of dollars... like 200.11. so they know its you

Haven&#039;t had any benzo&#039;s for three days now, so I&#039;m not mixing them together. Just wanted to be distracted from the wd&#039;s by using the oxy&#039;s. Have taken 60 mg&#039;s of oxy in the last 24 hours now, and only have 3 left. I don&#039;t wanna help a seizure come along by taking another drug is all. I think it&#039;ll be alright. I&#039;m experienced with opiates, and know how to use them without taking too many. My goal is to quit cold turkey, because i have to be clean by next friday so i can get back to work. I would rather taper off, but that&#039;s not an option unfortunately. I&#039;m supposed to have a few valiums available here by tomorrow, so i will be taking those if they arrive. Other than that, i guess i&#039;m just gonna have to suck it up push through while keeping what little bit of sanity i have left. Lol

				You&#039;d be better off with phenibut or phenobarbital for benzo withdrawals than with roxies... Alcohol would help too if you don&#039;t have anything else and think are at risk of having seizures. I also heard that valerian root was useful for benzo WDs, but I imagine you&#039;d have to take a lot of that.<br /><br />If you wanna be clean though, why would you take the valium when it gets there?

I think this is partly because of its long half-life and comparatively low euphoric effects at equivalent doses, and it&#039;s generally easier to titrate the dosage in the physical form it&#039;s delivered in. If you sense that you&#039;re withdrawing from benzos, it may not be something you can just stop at the drop of a hat. The risk of seizures, as in alcohol withdrawal, is not to be taken lightly.<br /><br />OP, I don&#039;t believe the opiates would be harmful unless you were to combine them with the Valium, although they could lower your seizure threshold slightly (probably not to a worrisome level, but it&#039;s something to keep in mind). The only relief they would give would be psychological, though--the main problem is going to be your GABA system being all fucked up, and that&#039;s a physiological problem that only GABAergic drugs like barbiturates, alcohol, GHB, etc. can help treat (of course, you don&#039;t want to end up addicted to something else either). But going back to the opiates, from my own experience, I think they might actually make you feel worse as you&#039;re withdrawing just because of how confusing/nauseating the experience is on its own.
