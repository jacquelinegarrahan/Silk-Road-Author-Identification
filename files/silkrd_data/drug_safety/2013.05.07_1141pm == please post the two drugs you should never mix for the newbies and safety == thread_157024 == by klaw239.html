				benzodiazepines and heroin... is xanax special ? i know it&#039;s very strong benzodiazepine alprazolam it is - 2 mg bars is INSANE . I mean starting dose should be 0.5 mg .. US doctors in my opinion prescribes too much and too large doses of alprazolam.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />A bar of alprazolam (xanax) equals 40 mg of diazepam or 4 mg&nbsp; of flunitrazepam. thats 2 roofies or whatever you call them right there. So no wonder if some kid takes a bar and shoots some H then never wakes up. Alot of died this way. In my country there&#039;s max 1 mg alpraazolam in other there&#039;s not even 1 mg but 0.25 and 0.5.

				He was really drunk and sniffed a big line i&#039;m guessing about 0.4g, I think the panic factor is a part as he was expecting a completely different effect. <br /><br />Just some really nasty people around, another one of my friends got offered a line of &#039;coke&#039; which was actually 2cb probably about 45mg, not a nice thing to do especially when he had never had trippers before. Put him off for life now which is sad :(&nbsp; (but thats a different story)<br /><br />But yes, I love ketamine i just have never seen anything good come of it when its been mixed with alcohol.

				MAOIs are serious biz<br /><br />Deadly combos with MAOIs (taken from erowid):<br />&nbsp; **Amphetamine, speed<br />&nbsp; **MDMA, (I believe any MDxx form including MDE, MDA)<br />&nbsp; **All SSRIs (prozac, zoloft, and several other anti-depressants)<br />SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin in the brain. Because MAOIs inhibit the breakdown of serotonin, the combination of MAOIs and SSRIs can lead to dangerously high levels of serotonin in the brain (serotonin syndrome). Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include nausea, vomiting, blackouts, memory loss, increased blood pressure and increased heart rate.<br />&nbsp; **Cough medications containing decongestants, Dextromethorphan (DXM), or Demerol

				GHB and alcohol!!! <br />never, ever, ever, god**** NeVeR<br /><br /><br /><br />but ketamine + alcohol&nbsp; is something I very much enjoy... <br /><br />MAO&#039;s are dangerous to combine with almost everything, do research...<br /><br />psychedelics and stimulants can be great together, but harder to trip out (paranoia!). Speed and LSD were a common combination for me and my GF some years ago. We had no problems with it, it even seems that taking some speed prior to taking LSD can enhance the experience (or make it deeper/more intense). <br /><br />shrooms and LSD can be fun... I did it some times years ago, but can&#039;t really remember the dosages, only that I had a good time when I combined them... <br /><br />LSD and xtx/mdma is off course one of the best (and safe!) combo, just remember to stay away from alcohol when using MD&#039;s. <br /><br />And coke and alcohol are fun, but the combination of both products in your body is not so nice... especially on the longer term!

				well if the combination isn&#039;t very toxic (use google) and newbie is curious then i would say go for it!<br />many posts here are subjective opinions, you gonna have to see for yourself in the end..<br />alcohol is mainly in here cause you will loose self control and overdose the combining substance<br /><br />its all about setting and dosing. start small, get experience and have fun<br /><br /><br />cheers minchia

I mean starting dose should be 0.5 mg .. US doctors in my opinion prescribes too much and too large doses of alprazolam.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />A bar of alprazolam (xanax) equals 40 mg of diazepam or 4 mg&nbsp; of flunitrazepam. thats 2 roofies or whatever you call them right there. So no wonder if some kid takes a bar and shoots some H then never wakes up. Alot of died this way. In my country there&#039;s max 1 mg alpraazolam in other there&#039;s not even 1 mg but 0.25 and 0.5.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Couldn&#039;t agree more. They hand that stuff out way too easily. I find that 0.5mg hits me within 15 minutes and puts me right out. I took one once before I drove a car (newbie mistake) and I nearly fell asleep at the wheel. I can&#039;t believe how easy it is to get this stuff. And the addiction potential is high as well. Xanax is always good to have around in case you overdo the stim&#039;s though. It&#039;ll bring you right down and cancel out and symptoms of an overdose.

				Coke and Speed. Worst combination I&#039;ve ever taken. I don&#039;t like MDMA and Coke either... there&#039;s no synergy. <br /><br />Oh and the best combo M1 + Meph, I just thought I&#039;d add that ;)

				Amphetamine sulphate and alcohol.<br /><br />Although the two are not killing people off on a daily basis, I would caution anyone who is a regular user of amphetamines and alcohol. The speed ups you alcohol tolerance big time. Your taking a stimulant and a downer, but although you may not feel like you have drank 15 pints and a hlf a bottle of vodka, your body will let you know the next day!<br /><br />I know speed is popular with younger people. Helps many keep up drinking when they should just drink less! <br /><br />I no loger use speed but will have the odd rare pop of 10-15mg dexamphetamine, no come down, no massive tolerance in alcohol and you can eat on it. Use too often and you will complain that 100mg is not cutting it anymore. Less is always more with any stimulant in my book. I am also gobsmaked that any doc could prescribe dex to a child. Its a drug! A very real drug! I think the jury is out on tha issue. Attention deficit? Give them speed? What next, heroin if your yawning? <br /><br />Also on a serious note, NEVER mix sleeping pills with alcohol. <br /><br />And mixing cannabis with alcohol takes lots of practice to get it just right. I prefer to hit the pub at 7-8pm, drink a few, sneak out to the beer garden and light up a sly one. Sometimes we slip a little piece of hash into a ciggarette, that gives a nice little hit so you can walk back into the pub a little high. I like a joint walking home also. Prefer hash as the skunk is like a cop magnet. They can smell it a mile off! All depends on wind direction really. The local cops know a lot of the guys and girls toke, but you play the game, hide it and they drink in the local so we don&#039;t want to take the piss!<br /><br />Smoke in the high street as women and kids are walking past and your asking for a grilling and possible on the spot fine. Keep it discreet and most cops don&#039;t give a momnkeys as they got better things to do and thats a fact most concede in private. So no smoking skunk in your car! Don&#039;t walk around the middle of town on a pub crawl with a rocket hanging out your mouth.<br /><br />Alcohol and many drugs get people arrested every hour of every day of the week. All year round. Always take precautions when going out to get a bit wrecked. Stash your substances or disguise them. Women have it easy really for stashing.&nbsp; ;D All me have is an uncomfortable and unhygenic stash. Its hardly convinient or cool to grab a wrap of coke out of your ass for your buddy to rail.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Like, some good shit dude!<br /><br />I&#039;d be punched.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Wise man say<br /><br />Don&#039;t stash the hash<br />Up your ass.<br /><br />Good stuff this Maroc No ! I&#039;m smoking with my buddy. Work tomorrow but got a lift in and can get a bit high as we check out what treats we need for upcoming parties!

				Xanax and Heroin as noted. Leads to respiratory failure and/or seizures in a rather large number of cases. <br /><br />Doses don&#039;t have to be high, it&#039;s all a matter of toxicity in your system, but anything over 1mg Xanax and .025 of Heroin can and does often cause problems. I find that most of the cases I see in the ER are from regular Xanax users who pop 2-4 MG a night and decide to try heroin. On the flip side, I know from first hand experience that .25 MG xanax or klonipin with the same dose of heroin snorted is fine, if not a waste.&nbsp;

				I generally wouldn&#039;t recommend mixing and two downers, two uppers, or an upper and a downer. You may not die, but it&#039;s usually much more unhealthy than using just one of the substances.
