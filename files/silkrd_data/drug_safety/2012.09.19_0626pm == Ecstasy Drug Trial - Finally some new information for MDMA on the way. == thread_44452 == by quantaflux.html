				Crossposting this from Bluelight so more people can see it.<br /><br />Read this - http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22280-a-real-fmri-high-my-ecstasy-brain-scan.html<br /><br />The programme will air on the 26th at 10PM, channel 4 in the UK.<br /><br />I was worried that they were only going to study the therapeutic effects of the drug, but according to the Channel 4 website:<br />&quot;The programme also looks at the potential side-effects and dangers of taking MDMA and includes a discussion with an expert who disagrees with the study and is sceptical about its purpose.&quot;<br />(This &quot;expert&quot; who disagrees with a scientific study sounds like a complete retard, I can&#039;t wait to see Nutt thrash him)<br /><br />http://www.channel4.com/programmes/drugs-live-the-ecstasy-trial/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1<br /><br />So, finally we will have some new information about MDMA, thanks to David Nutt, who is a hero that was on the drug classification board in the UK, until they got rid of him because he wouldn&#039;t be the governments puppet and play ball.

				I&#039;m looking forward to this, ch4 are certainly hyping it up.<br />Back in 2001 there was a Horizon programme about Ecstasy and it&#039;s effects on Parkinsons Disease, it was an excellent episode and I&#039;ve been searching for a copy for ages.<br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/ecstasyagony.shtml<br />It was incredible to see this young guy with Parkinsons take an E and an hour later he was perfoming backflips<br />If anyone knows where to find a copy of this i&#039;d be most grateful :)

				To be honest I was expecting more, I know more about MDMA than they talked about on the show (aside from the new findings regarding what happens in the brain while on it, obviously) however, it was hilarious watching the &quot;opposition&quot; try and pull 20 year old studies out of their arse and say things like 1 person had a bad reaction therefore it is bad and must be banned (didn&#039;t say the last part, but yeah)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why they didn&#039;t give David Nutt more time to talk, you could clearly see the facepalm on him and that woman scientist next to him while the other guy was rambling on. The studies the opposition guy talked about from 20 years ago affecting memory were from groups of people who also took other drugs and had that general lifestyle, which he failed to mention, basically just read http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_neurotoxicity.shtml<br /><br />He did manage to say something like it causes no permanent serotonergic damage when they let him get a word in.<br /><br />Also, the so called &quot;scientist&quot; when asked if he thought the study was worthwhile or not and said &quot;it depends on the results&quot; (or something) doesn&#039;t deserve to be called one. What a douchebag. That isn&#039;t science. Made me so mad that nobody called him on his bullshit during the show.
