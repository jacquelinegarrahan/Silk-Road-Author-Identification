				Hi,<br /><br />A few days ago I bough 1g od diazepam, this was the fastest way. Previously I red that it dissolves in ethanol quite well. I tried it now and I was very surprised when I noticed that it did not dissolves at all (maybe a little). Can anyone tell me what is wrong? I know that there are others solvents, but they are beyond my hands. I have a scale up to milligrams, but I would not trust it. Profesional ones are to expensive. Any ideas what to do?<br />:(

				It should dissolve quite readily in pure alcohol really, up to concentrations of about 50 grams per litre at room temperatures. <br /><br />If you are attempting to dissolve tablets, however, there may be many other components in the tablets that do not dissolve well - filtering off whatever dissolved out of tablets ground to a powder should contain all the diazepam. <br /><br />Note that readily doesn&#039;t mean rapidly though. Especially when dealing with tablets it may require mortaring those down to a fine powder and even some patience after that while stirring things to get the diazepam to actually dissolve.

No open flame! Use a water-bath or similar.<br />Or use Propylene Glycol, it is a very good solvent, but taste horrible. No heat, just stir.

				I too wish to dissolve my DZP such that one drop=1mg dose. (roughly 20mg per ml)<br />The goal being to fit 100mg into 5ml of fluid to put in a nice little amber glass eye dropper.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
