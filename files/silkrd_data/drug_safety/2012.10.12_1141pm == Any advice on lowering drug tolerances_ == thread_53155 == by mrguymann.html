				Ive been taking Generic D-amphetamine at the highest avail dose for some time now, and my tolerance toward it has almost quadrupled from the prescribed amounts over the past few years.&nbsp; Unfortunately abstaining from them is not an option due to my narcolepsy and the work requirement&nbsp; that I take the medication.But the expense is getting out of hand.<br />I was wondering if anyone had any techniques for lowering their resistances to drugs they take on a regular / semi-regular basis?

				I have -heard- (don&#039;t take my word for fact) that Ibogaine has some magical power to reset tolerances to certain drugs and get rid of addiction.&nbsp; Research it a bit.<br /><br />The only other way is to not use the said drug for an extended time, I&#039;m pretty sure.&nbsp; There&#039;s no real magic cure for tolerance though, AFAIK.&nbsp; Ibogaine MIGHT do it though.

				Ibogaine is not without fatal side effects though. It may be useful in treating addictions in a controlled setting, but its definitely not a substance to take at home expecting it will &#039;magically&#039; remove any tolerance, addiction or other problem.

				Take a week or two week vacation, quit the amph and let your tolerance reset.<br />Ibogane is a weird and risky path to go solo with.

				Have you considered trying a different class of stimulant to ward off narcolepsy? I&#039;m not aware of any method that allows the user to reduce their tolerance to amphetamines apart from abstinence to allow your nervous system to reattain homeostasis. <br />Modafinil is a stimulant prescribed for narcolepsy. If you&#039;re in a country without some kind of pharmaceutical subsidy program or are purchasing the amphetamine through illicit channels then modafinil might well be an alternative you could look into. It can be had affordably if you opt for one of the generic manufacturers&#039; products, and it&#039;s available both through Silk Road and traditional medical channels in quite a few countries.

				With amphetamine, taking a holiday is most definitely your best bet at reducing tolerance.<br /><br />There&#039;s a post stickied at the top of this forum&nbsp; that describes a method to sensitize yourself to amphetamines by spending a week taking very small doses. This might not work for you, since you&#039;ve been using for a while, but one never knows.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard some anecdotal evidence that taking Magnesium supplements (specifically chelated Magnesium) can help with amphetamine tolerance, but I haven&#039;t seen any papers on it. The post I referenced earlier also suggests that Zinc might be helpful. YMMV<br /><br />EDIT: Here&#039;s the abstract of a journal article suggesting that Magnesium increases Amphetamine potency. This is good news. CLEARNET: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2349266

				if there are certain days you only have a low dose which isnt enough to get the NEEDED effects you can look into potentiating the effects of the dose<br /><br />but first, be warned only to do this occasionally or you will get to a point where your tolerance is even more out of control (so this will have the opposite effect of what you are asking actually)<br /><br />one of the best ways if you are taking orally is to take an antacid 45 minutes before dosing. by raising the pH it actually facilitates absorption, increasing the bio-availability so you get more out of the same dose and less is wasted

				Following what micro said, quicker absorption also means less neurotoxicity, which is good if you&#039;re taking reasonably high dosages daily.

				can you explain why quicker absorption would mean less neurotoxicity?<br /><br />i dont know if raising the pH makes you absorb it quicker anyway, thats not what i said... it just means you absorb more but this could be over a longer period of time - the same dose will produce higher plasma levels eventually resulting in more crossing the blood brain barrier than a standard dose without decreasing the acidity<br /><br />to me it seems this would actually mean higher toxicity due to increased amounts of the drug able to effect more transporters - thus greater depletion of neurotransmitters and more stress on the cell<br /><br />but increased desirable effects obviously too

More potentially hazardous over time and not - as far as I&#039;m aware - available as a generic is the forebear to modafinil: adrafinil. One person I know who took it said that the effect didn&#039;t justify the expense, and it increased his already prehypertensive blood pressure to an unacceptable level. Long term use requires monitoring of liver enzyme levels, but it might be worth a shot. I find it indispensable when I have to present at work after 2 hours sleep due to insomnia, but given the extent of your issue I have the feeling it won&#039;t be sufficient for you.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking, how much dexedrine are you taking daily, and how much does it cost you? It&#039;s not a difficult molecule to synthesize, and I can&#039;t imagine the pharmaceutical companies would be able to charge much for it, but I&#039;m sure this changes from country to country, and so I&#039;m curious about your dosage and the expense involved.<br /><br />Many people aren&#039;t able to manufacture amphetamines and maintain a normal life. Having nearly unlimited access to stimulants for less than a dollar a gram when synthesized in a clandestine setting provides too much temptation for the majority of people to maintain sensible usage levels, or such has been my observation. You might be different and entirely capable of managing it, but on the balance of probabilities having access to stimulants you synthesized yourself might not actually be the panacea it appears to be.

				nice strenuous exercise with a sauna shower afterwards and lots of water along with abstinence and balanced lifestyle.&nbsp; Keep in mind that our bodies are composed of mostly water so you want that liver and brain to be regularly &quot;washed&quot;.&nbsp; The healthier you are, the less tolerant you will be to your favorite poisons.&nbsp; ;)
