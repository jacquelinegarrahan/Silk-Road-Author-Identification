				Hi Guys<br /><br />I was wondering (and google doesn&#039;t seem to wanne answer my question) if MDMA is besides the molecule most of us use it for still doing what it was originally make to do? I mean, it was created to stop abnormal bleeding, does MDMA still have this capability? For example, if you found someone who cut his/her wrists, would it be smart to give the person a threshold dose of MDMA (if available)&nbsp; after you tried to cut blood flow as much as possible? I was just wondering....

				Well yes theoretically. It has anticoagulant properties and vasoconstrictive properties. There are much better drugs for this though and if someone is seriously bleeding you would likely need something much stronger and faster working... best to just go to the hospital.

				If somebody was ABOUT to attempt suicide, shoving MDMA down their throat and restraining them until it peaks might be helpful.<br /><br />At least until the next day, where they&#039;ll be even more suicidal.
