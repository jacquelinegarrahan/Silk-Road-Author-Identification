				no you will not die. if that would be the case , you would be the first in history. chop em up in 2g&nbsp; . easy to eat. if you want to do it the safe way. get some cellular plastic foil. cover the hash 2 times with the plastic. Then you should if you can . Get some beeswax . heat it up and dip em 2 times. get some yogurt. and start eating. good luck.

				Don&#039;t they have those full body scanners that check for that kind of thing?&nbsp; I guess it depends where you are and where you&#039;re headed, but be careful.

				Lol. Body scanners just check for items hidden under your clothes. There is no way to check what is inside of your body. If they suspect you of smuggling, they can detain you and put you in a cell where you are monitored until you take a shit and they collect the drugs, or you can agree to an xray. LE cannot xray your stomach without your permission. <br />

				yes it is a risk. but they cant force you to take a dump. typical stories about people getting cough as mules . Are people that actually admits it. <br /><br />&nbsp;Is cellular plastic foil the same as clear plastic wrap? Or is it made of cellulose? guess its the same thing. and depending on your travel time. the first &quot;dump&quot; you do is the next morning. first it comes out just a few. then the rest some hours later. never liked the idea of eating condoms and beeswax seals it and protects the product. and its easy to swallow. makes the &quot;cleaning&quot; job easy as well. :o did it this way many times in my youth. and I never got cough. one time they gave me a hard time the costumes , maby because I looked tired from the trip or just very stoned 8) but I just refused to take a dump.&nbsp; 50g can be worth a lot of trouble. You can have some good smoke for the late summer. And for a cheaper price compared from were you are going and compared to the quality. Thats a risk it self I would take and jail time for 50g ?&nbsp; well that depends. the risk you take at your home country , with meting a dealer? every other day . Iam to old for that. gives me grey hair . that&#039;s why I stick to SR.

				And don&#039;t get worried about anything getting stuck in your insides. I had that confirmed with my doctor. A period after one of my trips it felt like I had my prostate up my trout . T ought something got stuck in my insides. Because I was having a piss every 30min. But that was not related to eating chunks of wrapped hash.
