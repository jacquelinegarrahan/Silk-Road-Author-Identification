				Hows it going guys, <br />I have a few different things I would like to talk about and would LOVE some feedback!<br /><br />My situation.. <br />About 5 months ago I discovered the amazing drug Adderall. I had stayed up all night long doing lines of coke and being generally irresponsible while full knowingly having work at 8am. As 8am came closer and closer... no more coke... tired... sleepyyy... uuuughhh............My good friend hands me this little orange pill and told me to take it right before my shift starts and I will be perfectly fine..... My life has not been the same since that day...<br /><br />For thos of you who don&#039;t know what Adderall is, all it REALLY is is pharmaceutical amphetamines prescribed to thos deemed by a &quot;doctor&quot; to have ADD or ADHD. They come in 2 different forms excluding name brand and generic.. <br />IR or &quot;Instant Release&quot; and XR or &quot;Extended Release&quot;<br />IR: Generally prescribed for ADHD,&nbsp; comes in lots of different sizes colors etc.. 5 - 30mg&nbsp; &quot;Crush-able&quot; <br />XR: Generally prescribed for ADD, multiple sizes and mg, in a GEL CAP with little beads. Ive seen 10 - 30mg <br /><br />That day at work, despite pulling a coked out all-nighter, was the BEST day at work to that date! I was absolutely amazed! Running at 110% efficiency kicking ass and taking names! Complemented by my managers from my outstanding customer service :) Needless to say I bought more...<br /><br />After buying them off of my friend for a couple weeks, I decided to look into a Non-street alternative to get my medicine. I scheduled an appointment with a family medicine doctor.... 30 minutes in the doctors office + 2 forms filled out... I walk out with my first months prescription for 30 x 30mg XR...&nbsp; Yeah.... I was pretty happy!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Now mind you.. I DO NOT have health insurance.. so filling one month supply of the GENERIC, WITH a 50% discount was MORE than it cost me to buy it street... So since then, I have created a network of friends who I can get these from when I need them... I even trade one of them for weed :P<br /><br />so..... why the hell are you telling me all of this... whats your point?<br />Well for the past couple months, since I am able to get a pretty much unlimited supply.. I have been slowly (but not necessarily intentionally) increasing my total daily mg intake. When I look back at the first time I took it, and the experience I had and what I accomplished the first couple weeks, I realized its not even anywhere near the same. NOW I take the shit like candy, poping 20mg irs every couple hours... why?.... Because I&#039;m addicted that&#039;s fucking why.....<br /><br />My theory on Adderall.. <br />I believe, Adderall and Amphetamines in general are miracles and WITHOUT A DOUBT have a place in the medical field. Infact...&nbsp; I believe (like im sure MOST of you believe here) that NO molecule is responsible for any &quot;drug addicts&quot; addiction problems..&nbsp; I FIRMLY believe that ANYONE can benefit from the OCCASIONAL use of Adderall as a tool! It really is the most amazing drug I&#039;ve ever taken (besides DMT hehehe) and has SO MUCH potential to help people who DO have problems with motivation, waking up in the morning, and staying focused.<br /><br /><br />This all brings me down to one last thing... <br />Last night I overstepped all of my life long established morals and bought half a gram of Crystal Meth....&nbsp; I did this with the SOLE intention that I was going to find a way to create my own Adderall that would be more potent but still remain as least bodily damaging and morally acceptable as possible (and possibly, a TEMPORARY &quot;turn to tolerance re-gainer&quot; to switch to for a bit.) The obvious delivery method would be X ammount of mg in a cap.<br />First 40mg - Took a LONG time for me to really feel the effects.. yup feels like adderall.. but juuust a little different.. cant put my finger on it..<br />Then after about 3 hours I noticed I was starting to slip back into fatigue.. so I loaded the next cap at 50mg.. I have to say.. This works!<br /><br />So what do you guys think? You know how hard it is to quit something cold turkey... I mean if I don&#039;t take ANY Adderall, I CAN survive.. But I will suffer from being EXTREMELY tired and unproductive/lazy all day. I have already made the decision that I will be making a vendor account and having my Adderall that I get available to all at WAY lower prices on SR...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />But seriously.. am I crazy? weak? a fool for taking street meth?... Currently I&#039;m having a very intense internal struggle trying to figure out what to do from here...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Low doses &gt; 100mg a day spread out.. safe or out right stupid...? Alternative? Anything?!??! <br /><br />Best Regards<br />~MasterCrash<br />

				Sounds to me like you&#039;re going down a slippery slope and fast. Dont mess with meth.....period. There are plenty of other drugs to do that wont destroy your life. You already need more adderall to sustain. You really think it wont get worse with meth? Run while you still can and go drink a RedBull! :)

				Don&#039;t do it dude. <br />You sound like you&#039;re a person who easily gets addicted to stuff so I&#039;d tell you to stay the hell away from Crystal Meth.<br /><br />Advice for you is to slowly build off your dose Adderall till you&#039;re at ZERO and quit taking them forever.

				Stop now, before you permanently get addicted to speed and can&#039;t function without it. I took it for about 6 months straight a couple years back... I finally got off because I realized, it isn&#039;t ME doing all this crazily amazing stuff, it&#039;s amphetamines sending my body into overdrive. After I finally convinced myself to stop, I had to spend the next 6 months stabilizing and healing my brain what it was before amphetamines. <br /><br />Bottom line, it&#039;s hard to understand this; to stop self-rationalizing what speed does in the long run. It causes heavy brain damage dude. I came out of my adderall binge a simple shell of what I used to be. It sucked so bad&nbsp; :&#039;( Luckily, after the addiction ended I learned to eat healthily and workout, both of which helped me recover from the brain damage. Please stop from going any further. Look yourself in the mirror and have pity on yourself that you need amphetamines 24/7 to function. You know what amphetamines actually do? They use your maximum potential. YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO FUNCTION LIKEWISE WHEN YOU&#039;RE SOBER!<br /><br />It just takes strenuous effort to make it your habit.

				You guys are right, Although I wouldn&#039;t say that I get addicted easily, I can imagine that ofter x amount more doses, I could become dependent on that now instead.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent a ton of time on Google searching got&nbsp; info on Crystal orally and cant really find anything good. I can say tho, after the amount that Ive done and since I wrote the initial post Ive noticed an substantial onset of stomach pain accompanied by a considerable headache. Now it maybe that I took it on a semi empty stomach but regardless, I think its best I ween myself of this altogether. <br /><br />A couple addy every once in a while issnt bad, and like I said earlier, I believe it has its place in the medical world. But after daily use, the very noticeable benefits start to fade and the dependency becomes visible. <br /><br />This is really going to be tough for me, I will be selling what i get now on SR.. Hopefully it goes quickly so im not tempted and goes to a responsible person.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you, Budtender01, Knomo, and Caparino<br />It was quite a big self realization night for me. <br />Throwing away the rest of this meth shit.. <br />On to day #1 of Amphetamine sobriety... wish me luck.<br />

				Eh, meth and adderall aren&#039;t really that different. Only difference in the effects is that I&#039;ve noticed meth causes mydriasis. As for culturally, adderall isn&#039;t ever really smokeable whereas meth is, so that leaves room for much more compulsive redosing.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong with meth in particular, nor with adderall, but I don&#039;t like to take either with any frequency. I haven&#039;t had addiction problems, but I never find the high to be worth the comedown. I&#039;d suggest you always let yourself come down. =/

				wow, i literally just posted my first experience on meth,<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25517.0<br /><br />all i can say is, if you dont have the will power, back off. I know my limits and thankfully i have willpower, it was a cool experience to experience, ONCE. but being addicted to that is sending your body and mind through a fucking paper shredder.<br /><br />by the sound of it, your abuse on adderal is not a good sign, ease off bro! I recommend running or working out to get a natural energy. dont depend on a drug to move your day (although ive done that alot with coke...but when its offered all the time for free, thats cool..also im over coke...i think the last year ive been just insulfating straight baking soda)<br /><br />all the&nbsp; best bro! and dont go that route you are paving.

				Anyone who thinks that trying to kick a drug with a more potent version of the same chemical family is foolish to say the LEAST. <br /><br />Don&#039;t touch the Ice again and kill the Adderall usage now before it&#039;s too hard to do. Yeah going CT will be shit but you just have to be a man about it and take the pain. This may be a controversial opinion but I think addicts who want to get clean but don&#039;t are, to be frank, pussies. Just kill it and let it be a character building experience.

I don&#039;t think there isn&#039;t an emotional side to it, of course there is and it should be dealt with but the bottom line is that you have to stop taking drugs. I see people talking about &quot;managing their addiction&quot; on here quite a lot (particularly in the Heroin threads) and they always say the same old shit about trying to cut down. It&#039;s just a crock of shit that means &quot;Oh I will try and reduce my dose for a few days or weeks max but then I&#039;ll just give up&quot;. I mean, would you buy a recovering alcoholic a Vodka when you were down the pub? I wouldn&#039;t (and I would hope nobody would here). It&#039;s the same with all drugs whether they are physically addictive, cause mental dependence or both. Annoys the fuck out of me as well when an addict who goes CT on one drug then switches to another drug thinking they wont get addicted to it knowing full well they are mentally susceptible to addiction. Where the fuck is the fucking common sense in that? <br /><br />I&#039;m not having a rant at you here OP, I&#039;m just ranting in general. I stand by my previous post though, go CT and don&#039;t touch amphetamines again apart from maybe the MDxx class because they aren&#039;t physically addictive like the straight-amphetamines are.

				I am a big fan of testing the boundries of your mind and body. I take comfort in knowing I have control of this and know my limits. For instance, Ive done the following stuff in my life for those intentions and I recommend some if not all!<br /><br />Fast 3-4 days a year on a complete 3 drink organic juice diet (when you make it to the 3rd day it is complete euphoria, heals the body/digestive system, extends your avg life)<br /><br />Pesca-Vegetarian for 2 years (i dont know why i did it, i guess that was just stupid, i definitely was the person that would say to people &quot;oh im sorry i dont eat red meat or poultry, &quot;...<br /><br />Ran a Marathon (whatever)<br /><br />No drugs of any sort for 2 months in college (went a little nuts and wanted to know i could not drink and shit, it was kinda fucked up though, fucking girls that were drunk when i was dead sober, i didnt take advantage though and i was fun enough i guess where they thought i was drunk i guess)<br /><br /><br /><br />im gonna stop cause you know what? as im typing this out i realize i sound like a complete fucking tool. hahaha, whatever, just take control of you mind and body people!

				well, i wanna know how hard you were tweakin when you wrote that first post, lol<br /><br />my advice would be to be glad you had some good times, but stop ASAP; this isn&#039;t a sustainable habit.&nbsp; it will suck for a week or two and you probably won&#039;t do anything productive, but its worth it to get back to your old self.&nbsp; if the withdrawals are really fucking up your work life or school life or whatever, maybe take a couple sudafed to get you through the first few days.&nbsp; its not the same, but it&#039;ll give you a little kick.<br /><br />methamphetamine is a legit demon, avoid that shit like the plague.&nbsp; at first you&#039;ll think its great and controllable, but its pure evil and way too powerful for 99% of humans to control.&nbsp; the best option is to just not use it.<br /><br />good luck, bro, hope you make the right choice.

				Methamphetamine is significantly more neurotoxic than dextroamphetamine/amphetamine salts(Adderall).<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure why anyone would want to try to end a drug habit by substituting it with an even stronger/more toxic/more addictive drug of the same class.<br /><br />sdesu

Before you get too entrenched in a high dose meth habit, please read this thread on safe meth use: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25287.msg270036#msg270036">Quote from: MasterCrash on June 02, 2012, 03:48 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br /><br />NOW I take the shit like candy, poping 20mg irs every couple hours... why?.... Because I&#039;m addicted that&#039;s fucking why.....<br />(1) It sounds like you need to take a step back here and get your tolerance down. In mine an probably most peoples&#039; opinions. <br /><br />Last night I overstepped all of my life long established morals and bought half a gram of Crystal Meth....&nbsp; I did this with the SOLE intention that I was going to find a way to create my own Adderall that would be more potent but still remain as least bodily damaging and morally acceptable as possible<br />(2)Morals? I don&#039;t mean to be harsh here, but you stopped being true to your health and yourself in general when you started popping 20&#039;s every few hours. Yes, methamphetamine is more potent and more neurotoxic, but don&#039;t bring morals into it. Chemicals are just chemicals and in my opinion meth really isn&#039;t an immoral or far off jump from amph. <br /><br />&nbsp;(and possibly, a TEMPORARY &quot;turn to tolerance re-gainer&quot; to switch to for a bit.) The obvious delivery method would be X ammount of mg in a cap.<br />(3) Nope, your tolerance will skyrocket if you use meth the way you&#039;ve been popping adderall. Being that they are very chemically similar, they will cause you to develop tolerance in the same receptors in your brain.<br /><br />First 40mg - Took a LONG time for me to really feel the effects.. yup feels like adderall.. but juuust a little different.. cant put my finger on it..<br />(4) If it&#039;s pretty pure, thats equivalent to 80 mg of adderall, aka a hefty amount for non-recreational use.&nbsp; <br /><br />But seriously.. am I crazy? weak? a fool for taking street meth?... Currently I&#039;m having a very intense internal struggle trying to figure out what to do from here...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Low doses &gt; 100mg a day spread out.. safe or out right stupid...? Alternative? Anything?!??! <br />(5) First of all, 100 mg a day of meth is not a low dose at all. It&#039;s a horrible idea for the long run. Seriously, I think you need to take a few steps back here and evaluate your drug use. And I&#039;m only saying this because it seems like you care about your health and want opinions.<br />(6) Yes, I think meth is a very viable alternative to ridiculously overpriced adderall. But if you want to avoid frying your brain, I think it&#039;s a terrible idea to use more than once or twice a week, if that. And if you can keep your tolerance low, you save money and dopamine, which at this point your brain is becoming depleted of. Tapering down would probably be a good idea. Your brain will be used to the dopamine it squeezes out, cold turkey is hell.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

A person who is taking 10mg a day will be able to stop and recover quicker than someone who is taking say 60mgs a day. For higher doses, it becomes a step-downward ladder. <br />rolling too hard to type much so here a link<br /><br />http://quittingadderall.com/how-to-wean-yourself-off-of-adderall/

				Adderall and meth are cruel mistresses, they wont let you go easily, and your gonna have to fight as hard as you can to stay clean from them.<br /><br />I was addicted to adderall for a very long,long time. I was up to about 70mg a day, sometimes more.<br /><br />After a while, my doc stopped perscribing them, so i turned to meth. Luckily, i have alot of junkie and tweaker friends i&#039;ve know since i was a kid, and have been through some shit with. I never had to pay for my habit, it always came free. And due to recent circumstances, i no longer get it for free, and wont for few months. <br /><br />So, i turned to my Bit wallet, and purchased my first amount of actual meth. <br />I&#039;ve done it for a while now... And i&#039;ve tried to quit numerous times. But she always gets the best of me...<br /><br />Hopefully, you can be stronger than i an so many others. If you really think you cant do it on your own, try seeing if your state or country offers some sort of free drug rehab program. Cause honestly,&nbsp; wouldnt it be better to spend a few months off, with other people dealing with the same problems with their addictions?<br /><br />I hope to someday overcome my addiction to this devil of a drug, but as of right now. Due to where i live, and money issues, i cannot escape the hell i have created for myself here.<br /><br />Just try to be strong, and remember you can do anything you set your mind to, anyone can. You just have to want it bad enough<br />

				Well,&nbsp; i have been fortunate enough to never have to had pay for the drug until recently, so at least i do not have a theiving mentality torwards the dope, like most common street tweakers. <br /><br />I&#039;m actually a very functioning Addict, i can hold a job, i don&#039;t need to lie or steal for my habit, I don&#039;t use everyday, Just when i know i need to focus. ( And being a Graphic design major, who does custom graphics for a living, detail and focus is key ) <br />So im usually pretty ripped from the moment i start working, till early the next day. <br /><br />Luckily it hasnt effected my appearance, except for some minor weight loss. <br /><br />But thank you for your concern and prayers stranger

				Well bynter, it started off like this...<br /><br />I was diagnosed with ADHD from my &quot; Dr &quot;&nbsp; ( he was a family friend, and has been scripting drugs to my family for years now. ) <br />So, i started out on 10mg pills, ever 6 hours like the bottle states.<br /><br />Well, right out of the gate, once i got that first high, i was hooked. i loved what it did for me mentally, and physically. <br />I was a chubby prick until i got on adderall, so i started increasing my dosage cause 1. I wanted to get more high, and 2. I had the notion, if i took more pills i&#039;d lose more weight by eating less and going for walks when i was torqued.<br /><br />Well this went on for several months, slowly increasing the dosage as i developed a tolerance.<br /><br />The moment i knew i needed to quit, was when i having withdrawls from E, and Weed, i was out of Adderall, so i began freaking out mentally, i was craving that drug, cause i felt like it was my miracle cure to everything....<br /><br />Just, when you think your doing to much.....chances are your doing to much...<br />It doesnt hurt, to stop for a week or a few weeks, and let your tolerance build back up if you can.

				Yea... i had a very very terrible E problem in highschool and college. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been hospitalized about 3 different times for Taking to much.<br /><br />I always got it from the same source, and it was always cut with the same things. Meth, and MDMA ( sometimes a muscle relaxer to ) <br />There were nights where i remember buying 20 or more pills, pulling out half them, and then eating one every 30 - 60 minutes for the entire night. and i would do this several days in a row. ( also, there was one time where it was lack of water. I was living in hawaii at the time, and it was my 3rd time on E. i forgot to bring water, and dehydrated like astronaut food in the sun hahaha.

				:(<br /><br />AncietX.....i hope you learned from that, and im sorry you went through that. You definitely understand the way to space out the drug now and stuff right? I hope such actions have tapered off and you know how to have a much better moderation.<br /><br />Just curious, have you like, lost completely, all the &quot;magic&quot;? cause i know a distant cousin of mine that dropped molly for like 30 days straight then butt chugged them...then just kept doing it 2-3 times&nbsp; week for a year.....<br /><br />.....this man i speak of hasnt done molly in 5 years....LITERALLY...and know SSRI, or whatever the fuck kind of anti-depressants or other drugs that fuck with your serotonin or dopamine...<br /><br />well, last week, I, as a gentlemen gave me 2 freebies of Supertrips VERY FINE, molly, measured out 2 pills clocked in at 175mg each<br /><br /><br />he dropped one then in the next hour the other one.....nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp; magic. gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;:( <br /><br />me on the other hand?&nbsp; i can take 120mg and another 75mg an hour later&nbsp; and you might as well call me a tuna salad, cause im on a rollllll&nbsp; (wow that was fucking corny but worth it)<br /><br />haha

				Oh, now? I&#039;ve never been better. I still get very high on Molly and the like. <br />I hardly ever do it anymore, just cause 1. i cant afford a weed habit, an E habit, and a limited dope habit.<br />and 2. Its just not as fun anymore, alot of my friends live very far from where i do, so im usually indulging by myself, at least as of lately, And being high on Molly, or any other trips, makes me feel like a serious junkie. Which, i know im not. I have very good self control over my drugs ( Now i do anyway... ) <br />After several scary experiences, i learned to be safer, always do plenty of research on chemicals and drugs before even attempting them, regardless of what the majority of its users say about it ( such, as &quot; oh, this shit will blow you to the fuckin moon bro... &quot; ) an other Upselling lingo to make it sounds &quot; Cool &quot; or &quot; Whats in &quot; <br /><br />Im just a simple guy, with a love for Drugs and life :D
