				Title: <strong>MDA Dosage? </strong><br />

				Alright, I&#039;ve rolled a ton of times on MDMA, but bought MDA for my first time this week and plan on doing it next weekend. My question is how much approx should I take? <br /><br />With MDMA I generally start with ~100mg and boost with another ~100mg when I feel like I need it.<br /><br />Is the amount of MDA I should take comparable to this?

				From my experience, I usually take about 3/4 of what I would take of MDMA for similar strength of roll. So in your case I would start with 75mg and a 75mg booster. To be honest though, in my opinion, I think 110-120mg to start and 50-60mg booster would be more fun. You should be aware that the higher dose you take, the more psychedelic your experience will be, 200mg gets a little trippy for me.<br /><br />MDA is fun&nbsp; :P

				How trippy will the experience become at higher doses? Should I expect colors to be enhanced or will things begin to turn into a mushoom/lsd effect? I am going to take it at an outdoor EDM event.Wondering what my energy level will be like, compared to MDMA.I recently grabbed some MDA off the road and plan on trying it in a week or so. I am pretty sure I might have came across the substance during my travels, but I cannot be 100% certain.

				<br />Above advice is spot on. I ONCE took 200mg mda, not a good idea. I was not right for many days. Keep it lower

				MDA dosage can be ever so slightly more temperamental than MDMA imo.<br />I&#039;d say definitely start below 100 mgs. Around 80 mgs should do ya if its good stuff. Redose 50 mgs in another hour if you are still not feeling it.

Regarding what stinky said, I have also noticed that the recovery period is a little more harsh. Just make sure you eat well after your roll, take some supplements, get sleep, and having nothing important to do the following today. <br /><br />Happy rolling friend&nbsp; :)

It was Montell Williams MDA. I have never had this trouble with 3Jane or The ILF MDA before. Nevertheless it scared the shit out of me. I felt DUMB, like really stupid and couldn&#039;t do simple things normally. Problems lasted for days, not my usual hangover that I can fix. NOTHING&nbsp; would make me feel better but time. I felt normal after about a weak. 80-100 mg would be fine with good stuff. I mix my stuff though. 70mg mdma+70mg mda. Something like that. Feel wonderful the next morning. I still have some of MW mda, I have played with it in tiny doses and was fine, I will use that as a last resort. I cant bring myself to toss it just yet!

				<br />Yeah come to think of it I KNOW it was the chem. MW at high dose was horrid, 3Jane at high dose was bliss! Heaven! I have played with The ILF and moderate doses and was LOVELY, I haven&#039;t gone full bore on theirs yet. Haven&#039;t felt the need to, great stuff!!!

Just got my first order from them and it looks similar to ILF but I have not sampled it yet. <br /><br />Your right the real magic comes from mixing MDA and MDMA, I think this is why you see MDA in pills sold as E sometimes. It is possible to have some leftover MDA when cooking MDMA, but that route MDA to MDMA is not a popular one, usually you have MDA on purpose.
