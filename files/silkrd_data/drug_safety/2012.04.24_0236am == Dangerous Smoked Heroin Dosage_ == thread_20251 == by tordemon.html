				I just smoked 80mg of #3 heroin, and I felt kinda uncomfortable with my high heart rate and depressed breathing for about 15 minutes, though that anxiety really quite possibly could be drug-induced, causing at least the first effect. I&#039;m curious what would be considered the absolute maximum safe dosage for somebody with no tolerance (although I have some, I figure it&#039;s safer to stick to that number...)

It&#039;d be very hard to OD by smoking heroin. You could probably smoke 300mg+ (NEVER TAKE THAT MUCH IF YOURE SNORTING/INJECTING. YOU WILL PROBABLY DIE!!!!) and be fine. The thing is I don&#039;t think you&#039;d manage to smoke it all before having to put it down due to being overwhelmed.<br /><br />How was your first time anyway dude? What was the high like?

My very first time went pretty poorly. I was bowing down to the porcelain gods for a good 4 or 5 hours straight, and couldn&#039;t sleep because of the nausea for around 36 hours, returning to the bathroom every so often to pay my respects once again. First times usually kick the shit out of me, and that was no exception. I&#039;ve since never had any nausea with heroin. I also didn&#039;t get itchy my first time for whatever reason, but I now love the itch. =]

				ahh your fine mate ive been smoking h since i was 15&nbsp; im now 31 and i can tell you with conviction you&#039;ve got nothing to worry about concerning od&#039;s when smoking trust me when i used to sell it before i got nicked and sent to jail i was smoking anything from 2grams to 3.5 grams everyday without fail all that happens wen you od from smoking is non stop being sick and the worst hangover effect the next morning,1 new years eve i smoked so much with my mate that every line we did we were sick even wen nothing left to frow up that&#039;s not nice as it can fucking hurt being sick without sick coming up.but i don&#039;t recommend doing that much as beleave me it makes you fucking ill i ended up being 6stone with scabs all over my body from scratching so much i looked like walking death and to be honest if i hadn&#039;t got nicked and sent to jail i probably would of been dead not from an od but just the real poor health doing that much daily gets you in i wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone.anyway if you ever need to ask anything about smoking the stuff just message me would be no problem
