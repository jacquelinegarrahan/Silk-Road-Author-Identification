				Hi everyone just looking for some advice. To make a long story short I had surgery last month and was prescribed vicodin ES.&nbsp; I have no insurance so going to the dr is actually more expensive than coming here.&nbsp; I was taking 3-4 of the vicodin ES (by mouth) a day but for the past week had none.&nbsp; Am looking to switch to opana since that seems to be cheaper than vicodin here (and I&#039;m not looking to find anyone locally to buy them from).&nbsp; If I&#039;m taking these by mouth how much (about) would I start with?&nbsp; I did the opiate conversion and it says to only take 2mg of the opana. thanks and sorry if this is a totally stupid question&nbsp; :)

				Opana Vs. Vicodin...<br /><br />Opana is a very VERY strong opiate!&nbsp; I believe the conversion you used is probably pretty close in dosage conversion.&nbsp; However, Opana has a super low oral bioavalibility meaning taking oral is pretty much a waste.&nbsp; I suggest you snort the opana if you do decide to go this route.&nbsp; Just remember if you are snorting the opana you will want to cut that 2mg dose in half.<br /><br />Something else to do with opana is that it is crazy addictive!&nbsp; Be careful with it as your tolerance will skyrocket on it in no time at all.&nbsp; Also opana withdraws are horrendous so be very careful, I would say that opana withdraw is IMO the worst of all opiates I have used on a reg basis, and I have used almost all of them.<br /><br />I am not trying to scare you away from opana, I am simply trying to warn you of the consequences so you can make a more informed decision.&nbsp; I really think if this is going to save you money in the long run that you should go for it!&nbsp; Just be very careful my friend, I hope you the best!<br /><br />Peace<br />bupebuddy<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />If you need anymore info PM me or we can keep your thread going.&nbsp; More people can learn if we just keep the thread going but I support your decision either way.

				Hi, thank you for the response.&nbsp; I am not going to snort them so that is out of the question.&nbsp; I should probably look to get something else to control my pain.&nbsp; Snorting them just seems like it would be wayyy more addicting (I used to do cocaine on a regular basis and I think even crushing something up could trigger that feeling again if you know what I mean).<br /><br />It seems like what you are saying is that I should look for another opiate.&nbsp; It just seems like all the other ones here on SR are wayyy mmore expensive per milligram (namely vicodin and percocet which are the two things my dr had prescribed me).<br /><br />I did take just a piece of the opana orally and literally felt nothing, no pain relief no nothing.&nbsp; Before when I would take the vicodin I would feel that warm fuzziness too and with this I just got a headache.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also the withdrawal doesn&#039;t sound fun at all.&nbsp; When I stopped the vicodin (which I had been on for about 5 months) I didn&#039;t even feel anything except for a little RLS at night when I would try to sleep.<br /><br />It&#039;s so weird to me that the opana could be so strong when storted and so weak when taken orally, that&#039;s just crazy to me!<br />Again, thank you so much for the response and I look forward to any other advice/suggestions you or anyone else could offer :)

				It makes a lot of sense actually given the oral bioavailability is ten percent and snorting is up around sixty percent. If you are going to use oxymorphone the suggested route is insufflation. <br /><br />I would avoid opana honestly except for special occasions. The tolerance and subsequent withdrawal issues just seem too significant. <br /><br />There is another thread regarding this similar topic on the main SR category titled about the prices of opiates skyrocketing. We were discussing the use of diacetylmorphine for pain management instead. If you are not open to another route of administration than oral, your options will be limited to the expensive mainstream pharms unfortunately. <br /><br />Some people use low dose buprenorphine for pain and they dont seem to be as expensive, but also prevent you from the enjoyable feelings for the most part.

				No offense microRNA but bupe for pain management is utterly worthless IMO.&nbsp; I use it for maintenance after being strung out on H for years and it does nothing for my pain.&nbsp; I think advil or aleeve is beter for pain management than bupe.&nbsp; I may get prescribed 60 8mg pills a month but to be honest I only use 2mg a day.&nbsp; I take 1mg when I wake up and then one more mg before bed.<br /><br />I feel less is more with bupe.&nbsp; When I first started I was taking the full 16mg/day and I felt horrible.&nbsp; No sex drive, no motivation, I always had headaches, all in all I felt like shit.<br /><br />On a side note I have heard of buprinex (the injection form of bupe) has been used for pain management.&nbsp; The only thing is I have not know anyone IRL who gets the stuff, I have just peoples posts about it on various forums and they all have mixed reviews of the stuff.

				well I took the whole opana yesterday by mouth and didn&#039;t feel anything (in bits and pieces).&nbsp; This might be a stupid question but you said that tolerance skyrockets with these so will just taking that one 20 mg pill yesterday make my tolerance for opiates higher?&nbsp; If so I won&#039;t take any for a few days and just take motrin.&nbsp; thanks ;)
