				Hello Walkers! (I call you that because it&#039;s a Road)<br /><br />I&#039;ll be attending an awesome EDM rave later this year, and I was wondering what the wise walkers of the Road could recommend/suggest on what I plan to do.<br /><br />The event will have a couple of filler DJs that I plan on not really seeing, but once the main event starts here&#039;s my current (changeable) plan on rolling:<br /><br />(modified to reflect updated learning)<br />00:00 150-185mg of Cloudsurfer MDMA (I&#039;m thinking of 170 because of what&#039;s next, advise me otherwise if I should just drop 200)<br />00:30 MDMA kicks in<br />02:00 50mg MDMA<br />03:00 20mg Ivory 2-CB<br />06:00 Time to go home! (or the afterparty)<br /><br />My question to you is this: <br />1. Should I be boosting the MDMA, or just going straight for the 2CB? What kind of effects does 2CB have during a roll? I&#039;ve always been curious but haven&#039;t had the opportunity to try it in a home setting.<br />2. Is that dosage going to make me sick? I actually have not tried MDMA on its own in a cap before. My previous experiences were all with pills. To compare, I have done Supertrips 200+mg speakers (though they had ? on them<br />3. I&#039;ll be supplying to some girls as well. What kind of dosage would be good for them, in light of the two questions above? 100? 125?<br />

				Taking the 2C-B that late will definitely have you tripping well into the afterparty...

				@Mochill<br />I would take your booster of MDMA at 1:30 in...then take the 2cb about a half hour after that.&nbsp; Also, read up on your appropriate MDMA doseage but its said to be 1.5mg/Kg of your body weight.&nbsp; *And that your booster should be half your initial dosage.&nbsp; You could always up it a little bit I suppose, but I would never advise against redosing with MDA, I was in pain the next day bc I redosed on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The 2cb will be fun...the ecstacy will carry into the trip nicely, but dont take ecstacy while on 2cb.&nbsp; They kind of counteract each other...I staggered my hits of MDMA capsules and 2cb capsules one night and I wasn&#039;t a fan...It was much better to roll then take a RC from the 2c family.&nbsp; <br />

				I understand that dosing the B after is the best choice. I&#039;m just wondering about dosages and timing. When will the 2CB wear off? +4-6 after dropping? I&#039;ve driven on MDMA before, and it&#039;s great. I focus better! Could I drive after the 2cb?

				Hey man ! its funny because the two MDMA i tried from the road was from SuperTrips(Crystals) and the 2nd time it was CloudSurfer , so we are kind of in the same situation :) I highly invite you to drop 170mg with no booster or a 130-140mg with a 50mg booster after 1hour or so. I tried 130mg of ST stuff and 140mg of CS stuff and omg man ......... I can tell you that ClourSurfer stuff is 10000000000000 times better and stronger ;) If you weight under 160 lbs i highly recommend you to stay away from the 200mg and above mark. This stuff will kick you on your ass xD. And if the girl weight in the 100-130lbs range i think that 100-110mg should do the job since girls are normally weaker than men(Im not trying to be sexist or anything but i found it being true with all the grils that rolled around me). Anyway , i dont know your rolling experience too and&nbsp; how much you weight and what not. Stay safe and be sure you are around people you love ;) Have a nice time !

				So that rave was insanely fun.<br /><br />I did everything I listed out previously, dropping 175 then 100 after 2 hours, then using 2cb 3+ hours in. It was crazy!<br /><br />The MDMA was clean as expected. I like to describe it as seeing everything in HD. Colors and lines were crisp and easy to define. The music progressively got more exciting and fun to jump to. Clean MDMA is like alcohol in a way: you gotta put in the effort to party to really go all out, but you could also sit down and have a chat and a smoke if you so chose. The dose was good for the occasion, though I think I could have gone lower if I had wanted to; maybe next time!<br /><br />What made the whole thing bizarre was the 2CB. Is it normal for me to kind of zone out once I start peaking on it? The first 45 minutes of coming up was exciting; colors were starting to vibrate and everything started becoming HD again. Then shit just got weird... I could not focus on anything and all I could do was trance out and start swaying my head to the beat while weakly fist pumping. The experience was starting to get scary but I was reassuring myself by knowing it&#039;s just the 2CB and it won&#039;t last long. Does this happen to everyone? Is this the &#039;magic combination&#039; everyone is talking about? I don&#039;t know if I like it! I had a 20-25mg dose and it felt like I was just tripping insanely.<br /><br />Near the end of the last act (about 3 hours after I dropped the 2CB) I heard Levels and was instantly snapped back to HD reality. This is when the epic happened - but only for one song! After that I felt totally burnt out and tired... something that usually doesn&#039;t happen with just MDMA (though this is the first time I followed rolling guidelines of redosing 1.5 hours) For about half a week after that I felt zapped out and tired from serotonin depletion.<br /><br />My question now is: Is this the typical experience that I can expect when flying with the bees? How could I have made it better?
