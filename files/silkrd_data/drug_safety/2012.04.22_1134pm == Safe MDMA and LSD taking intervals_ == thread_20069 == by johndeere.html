				I take the health of my brain very seriously. From all the reading out there I have came to conclusion:<br />One can safely take MDMA every three to four weeks, so brain can restore serotonin levels. (average dosage: 1.5mg/kg)<br />One can safely take LSD every 7 to 14 days. (avg dosage: 1 ug./kg)<br /><br />Is this true or I have missed something?

				Yeah that&#039;s a pretty good general rule. But as always, everyone&#039;s body chemistry is different. You may notice that taking LSD every 7 days will end in diminished effects when you drop that frequently (like me), or it may be the perfect amount of time for you to receive an awesome trip. MDMA once a month is a pretty good rule of thumb though, but some people can get away with doing it every 3 weeks or so. Best course of action is to try these time intervals and see how you feel afterwards, and adjust accordingly.

				Those time frames sound about right mate. Also im sure you are aware that it can vary from person to person but also from time to time for a specific person depending on diet and such things. Personally i can get away with every other weekend with mdma (not that i always drop this often) without any visible or mental effects (that iv noticed). Experiment and find a time your comfortable with :)

For all we know, taking MDMA only once a month may have an accumulative effect on the brain that only manifests itself in old age.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One can safely take LSD every 7 to 14 days.

If you wanted to, you could safely take LSD every day of the year; you just wouldn&#039;t notice any effects after a while. It&#039;s physiologically harmless and less toxic than caffeine.

				In the last 5 weeks I took MDMA week 1 week 2 week 3 then skipped week 4 and then took week 5. I never took more than .2mg of MDMA crystals (I weigh 70 kilos, 150 pounds). I haven&#039;t noticed any significant negative effects on my mental status...is this out of the norm for most people? Would most of you be feeling really shitty by now?<br /><br />I&#039;m curious because I don&#039;t really know what&#039;s safe to take...but I could never see myself doing acid this often.

I mean personally I never get that hangover, but I probably would if I did it that much. I would say be careful about doing it that much, because you&#039;ll find that your tolerance grows relatively quickly, and although MDMA isn&#039;t even remotely physically addicting, it can be mentally addicting and that would suck. I try to keep at least a 2 month space between my MDMA uses, although you don&#039;t necessarily need to wait that long. I just like making sure I have the best roll possible.

				For LSD, one week will return you to a 75% to 80% baseline and after 2 weeks you&#039;ll be back at 100% baseline. MDMA is more of a fickle bitch and you should wait at least 1.5 to 2 weeks before doing it again for the bare minimum, one month to be good to go, and 2 months to be just primed for it. Green teas or green tea extract supplements, 5-htp, grapefruit juice, Vitamin A,C,E pills or foods naturally high in those vitamins such as broccoli are good to have consistently included into your diet and daily regimen to minimize oxidative stress put on your brain and make the MDMA hangover a bit more bearable. Hope this helped ya out and stay safe.

				Moksha,<br /><br />To answer your question, No not really, pre and post-loading does not mean you can take MDMA with less breaks. The goal of pre and post loading is not to shorten intervals between usage, but rather to mitigate or prevent any potential damage that can result from MDMA use. 5-HTP is a source of debate right now in the psychopharmacology community ( which I am a part of, so hopefully that maybe helps my credentials) as there has been confounding and conflicting evidence about its effectiveness in &quot;restoring&quot; serotonin reserves. Serotonin is the key neurotransmitter involved with MDMA and it will always &quot;regenerate&quot; pretty much at a fixed rate, regardless of what you take. Unless you&#039;ve got some sort of neuromuscular illness like Parkinson&#039;s or have destroyed your brain with synthetic opioids, your personal serotonin stashes will come back at the same rate.&nbsp; As for your diet vs occasional supplement intake inquiry, it depends. A multivitamin and foods &amp; drinks high in anti-oxidative properties should be part of your diet anyways as it&#039;s just a matter of maintaining decent health, something those of us who engage in illicit drug use should ensure anyways. As for magnesium and 5-HTP, it seems you will be alright with taking them for a week before your planned roll and a week after your roll. For the few times I have rolled I always make it a priority to have a mug of green tea, a multivitamin, a bottle of Gatorade in my system beforehand or during if I am out for the night. LSD is a funny chemical too, depending on individual body chemistry, tolerance can diminish as quickly as yours. What I report is just averages from what little clinical research has been done and an amalgamation of all the trip reports I have read and taken note of. Hope this helped and if you have any other questions, please ask.
