				I soon want to try LSD with 4 good friends. We will do it in nature, taking a walk and chilling indoors listening to music. I really look forward to it. Now I think there may be 1 problem:<br />-I have had 1 very rough year in my youth, wich made me quite depressed that year.&nbsp; However that&#039;s all past now ( 6 years ago) and I have a good happy life now.<br />Now if I&#039;&#039;m going to trip on LSD for the first time, do these experiences come back? Currently, I have not put the memories away, but thought a lot about them last years, but now I really almost never think about it again, so i&#039;&#039;m not forcefully putting them away.<br />I do not want to revisit these experiences (although I do want to sometime, to fully face it all again and work it out completely) this trip,. but just trip, appreciate nature and talk about things. Is this possible or will LSD force me in that direction when I think about it?<br /><br />What dosage is fine for the first time? We have the rolling stones tabs from FlyingDutchman, these are supposed to be 150 mics, but are they? I do not want to be overwhelmed, but also want a convincing first trip. I was thinking about taking approx 100mics? Is this dose low enough to avoid the problem I stated above? Are the rolling stones tabs indeed 150 mics? I was thinking of taking 3/4, but I am afraid that with a little bad luck the dose will be a lot above 100 mics. Any advice?<br />Must tell, I do have experience with MDMA, weed, ketamine, moderate-high doses of 2c-b (once 30mg), speed.

				Hiya Bluegreen<br /><br />My advice is not the most current. I haven&#039;t taken any decent acid for 10 years, but was spoiled rotten with quality business at high doses between &#039;98 &amp; 01-02ish.<br /><br />First off, you are going about this in best possible way as far as I can tell and that counts for alot. I had difficult experiences related to childhood sexual &amp; psychological abuse that were catalysed/crystalised in my mind<br />by taking LSD, generally at doses a fair bit higher than 100mics and usually as a result of making stupid choices about where and when to dose.<br /><br />It is possible that you will end up revisiting the bad times, but that really isn&#039;t anything to fear, the setting your going for sounds perfect, just make sure your friends are supportive and that you have sweet FA to do for at least the following day<br />and you&#039;ll be fine. <br /><br />If you practice any form of meditation that can also help enormously in directing your attention if things become a little dark. Breathing is fucking amazing :)<br /><br />As to the quality/dose of those blotters I haven&#039;t got a clue, seem to remember there being discussion of them in the Avengers thread in the rumor mill section though so have a look there. 100mics should be an excellent starting dose to shoot for though. <br /><br />Hope you and your mates have a really good one. <br /><br />

				Hey! My first acid trip was with 120 mics. I think if you have good, supportive company, and a good setting, you should be just fine. If you haven&#039;t thought about your past issues recently, they&#039;re unlikely to surface. It&#039;s not guaranteed obviously, but I personally found my trip to be focused on my current situation and I didn&#039;t really think about the past much. It could have been my company/setting.<br /><br />Do you like to smoke weed while doing psychedelics? Smoking during the middle part can accelerate the trip into crazy territory (where reality truly started to deconstruct for me and some bursts of paranoia which I found easy to fend off started creeping in), probably more like what you&#039;re familiar with on such a high dose of 2C-B (especially with regard to visuals), but otherwise it should be pretty chill, which sounds like exactly how you want it to be.<br /><br />The Erowid Guide to the Psychedelic Experience is fucking fantastic and does a great job of explaining how to prepare and what to expect: *CLEARNET* http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_experience_faq.shtml *CLEARNET* <br /><br />Hope you have a great trip! :)

				if you live a good happy life now then i&#039;m fairly sure the LSD trip will help you realize all the great accomplishments you have achieved to escape your past...<br /><br />LSD has always been an &quot;in the moment&quot; drug for me...it never really made me think about my past...i was more concerned with whatever was right in front of me at the moment and more of the world as a whole rather than being introspective...<br /><br />Shrooms on the other hand do make me think of the past...but didn&#039;t make me feel guilty or ashamed about it...it was more of a lesson to be learned sort of thing...

				Hello,<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about those negative experiences you&#039;ve had in the past. You will probably not think about them during the trip, and if you do she will probably help you look at it from a different perspective. We believe this is the strongest power of LSD. It does not help you to forget, or put away any negative experiences, but helps you look at it from a complete angle.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid of her, embrace her. We without a doubt reccomend 1 tab.<br />Just let it sit on your tongue, close your eyes, and let the Lysergic-Acid slowly<br />take over your mind.<br /><br />Thank you for your purchase and enjoy the trip! Let us know if you&#039;ve managed<br />to completely let go of your problems.<br /><br />Greetings,<br />The Flying Dutchman Team
