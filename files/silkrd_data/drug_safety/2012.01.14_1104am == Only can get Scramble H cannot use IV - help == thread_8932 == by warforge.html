				i know have access to scramble, and due to medical conditions i cannot shoot it. I sniffed oxy IR for many many years and always from day 1 it really pumped me up to get through the work day, sniffing 30-60mg every hour, normally 200-300 mg a day. Now i&#039;ve been off for a good 6 months, did the suboxone shit, but i ended up getting pancreatitis. So when i eat, drink a lot of fluids, it hurts like a gall stone all the time. So anyways I have no insurance, I can&#039;t IV, cannot afford OXY, but I can sniff. So with me loving opiates, in pain... what is the best way to sniff this stuff, since its cut up how can u tell how much ur getting in you to start, do u wanna sniff it hard into the membrain? or sniff it slow and soft?<br /><br />any advice would be great. <br /><br />stay healthy and safe everyone.<br /><br /><br />

				a decade ago the only H i could get was scramble.&nbsp; we used to get some really horrible stuff like right off the street corner, points for $10 each and 10 for $80.&nbsp; there was a TON of white powder to snort through to do what would basically be a bump of the raw brown powder.&nbsp; they put nasty stuff in it, like talc and even found grains of sand once.&nbsp; nosebleed city.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-[<br />i did some local scramble a few years ago and found it way more potent (but still powder heavy) with little brown flakes in it.&nbsp; either way the stuff hammers ur nose..&nbsp; i think the best thing to do would be to take a syringe and remove the needle.&nbsp; prepare it like u would for IV, with a filter, and load the syringe.&nbsp; then spray one half of the load up each nostril.&nbsp; don&#039;t tilt back too fast.&nbsp; should hit quickly and u won&#039;t have to wait for ur mucus membranes to produce enough fluid to absorb all that dry, water-absorbent cut.<br />at least then you&#039;ll get out the solids and make the process alot more gentle.&nbsp; <br />hope that helps!<br /><br />*destiny*

				I remember reading about a drug-administering device which was very helpful, and I still use on the off-chance that I snort something. Basically what you do is get a bendy straw and cut the longer end so that both ends are almost the same length. Then you wrap masking tape around one end until it is just the right size to form a seal around your nostril. Then you can load powders into it, stick the taped end into your nostril, the other end into your mouth, and with a sharp exhale your epiglottis (somebody verify this) will close, spreading the drug throughout your nasal cavity.

				hmmm sounds like a interesting idea. I know there has to be some creative minds and ideas, I mean i&#039;ve been high out of my mind and found some very creative way to get a drug to hit harder/faster.

				yea that straw device sounds interesting..&nbsp; hehe would be kinda funny.<br /><br />if you run it through a cotton or other filter first it should at least get the non-soluables out. so it can&#039;t hurt.&nbsp; <br />when i used to squirt the liquid solution up my nose it often came on faster.&nbsp; of course you can&#039;t squirt four or five loads up in a row cause eventually it will start to run.&nbsp; you have to give time for ur mucus membranes to absorb.<br /><br />*destiny*

				Plug it or smoke it. Whenever I get scramble I chase the dragon (unless it&#039;s really good scramble, but that hasn&#039;t happened for a while). Smoking it gives me a really good rush after about five minutes. Some people say smoking it is a waste, but I think scramble is usually a waste, so it works out right? There&#039;s no way I&#039;m IVing anything but pure after some experiences with a certain scramble vendor on here.<br /><br />Trying getting pure once and a while via SR. It really pays for itself.
