				Hey there, well while I dabble in a good amount of drugs recreationally, my uses of these other substances (psychedelics and ecstasy mostly) are keep decently moderated. However, for some reason or another Adderall is one that I love to use, and with this and its productivity increases I use it habitually, taking breaks only when I sense a potential addiction problem. (addiction in this case defined as an absolute need to take the substance once a day.)<br /><br />The problem with this habitual use, besides underlying medical problems that I&#039;m sure are progressing with all the usage, is the fact that my tolerance is sky high through the roof, and as such I have a couple of questions:<br /><br />1) Is my tolerance to Adderall normal for heavy users, or am I taking an uncanny amount even for hardcore recreational users? With a couple off days 60-80 mgs will get me a decent high, with a couple of continious days of use I need anywhere from 120-160 for desired effects and sometimes on rare occasion I can drop +200 mg with no noticeable side effects besides an elevated heart rate and possible insomnia.<br /><br />2) Are tolerance breaks effective for you? It&#039;s said you&#039;ll never obtain the high you did during the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase with addy, but regardless are these breaks very effective and if so how long do you typically break for?<br /><br />3) Is there a better alternative to Adderall in terms of a recreational drug that is a stimulant? This being so I get the good social effects, body buzz but also an increase in productivity.<br /><br />4) What kind of negative effects are bound to come from this type of use? Just want new opinions, I&#039;ve done plenty of research on the matter but you never know what someone may know that you don&#039;t.<br /><br /><br />.....okay, this shit is wordy as hell, my bad....fuckin&#039; adderall.<br /><br />

				You know, no answers to these questions needed. Rereading this was a slap in the face, I sound like a strung out retard.<br /><br /><br />Stopping use tomorrow, any suggestions on how to fight the grogginess and lethargy of amph. withdraw?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll leave this post up for comical purposes I suppose. And please don&#039;t consider me a crazy bastard, sometimes you just gotta really read the shit your saying to notice how fucking desperate it sounds.

				Good luck man. Adderall is my DOC (as of now, I plan on trying bunch of new things in the coming months). I&#039;ve been taking it off and on over the past 3 years. However I was fairly lucky that I never had a constant supply, just a friend who was on it that would give me 4/5 pills a month. At one point I had saved up a bit and took one every other day for about 2 weeks and realized that my tolerance was way to high at that rate. Now I take a 30mg no more than once a week. At that rate tolerance is not a problem at all. Ive found that if I have an excess supply that I will almost always take it more often then I should, so I would suggest just keep your supply at a minimum and you will hopefully take it less often.

				Yeah no shortage of addy around here. <br /><br />In a months time, through a network of people I&#039;ve met locally over the past year or so since I started use, I can come up with at least..<br />60+ Adderall 20&#039;s monthly<br />30+ Vyvanse 60&#039;s monthly<br />30+ Adderall 25&#039;s monthly<br />30+ Vyvanse 40&#039;s monthly<br /><br />Then a wide variety of various amounts of addy 10&#039;s, dexadrine 15&#039;s, addy 30&#039;s, vyvanse 50&#039;s, and I could potentially get vast amounts of ritalin but I never found it of much use.<br /><br /><br />So looks like it&#039;s gonna be all willpower from here on out man, thanks for the words of encouragement. Hell, looking at these numbers maybe I should open up shop haha.<br />

				I had a mild overdose of adderall once. I did a lot (300mg+)over a span of&nbsp; 2 days with no sleep. <br /><br />I had chest pains for 3 or 4 days after that binge and thought I was gonna have a heart attack. It hurt to breathe and I think it was vasoconstriction. I still take it occasionally here and there but learned my lesson not to binge on the stuff.

				I&#039;ve been taking, and selling, them for several years now. I take half of a 30mg IR each morning before work, keeps me super alert and focused at work naturally. My only problem with that is I can&#039;t go to sleep at night unless I either have a couple bowls of weed or 4 or so beers (real beer, not Miller Light and shit). I also don&#039;t take them on weekends, unless I&#039;m doing a project or something.<br /><br />Now that works perfectly for me, I have no dependence on it and I never abuse it.<br /><br />On the flipside, I sell them to people and explain this to them but I&#039;ve seen one after another completely abuse these. One woman is a stay at home mom and was taking 120mg+ per day. I was like what the fuck are you doing with all that energy? Running 6 mile laps around the neighborhood with a kid in each arm?<br /><br />I think it&#039;s much better served as a medication than used as a recreational drug, especially when there are so many recreational drugs that do the same thing, only better. Difference for me is the speed from addys I can focus on work, speed from coke is completely unfocused for me.
