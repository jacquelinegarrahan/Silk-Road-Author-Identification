				&nbsp;Tomorrow I&#039;ll be dropping my last two hits of lucy. It&#039;s a perfect day no responsibilities. I&#039;ve already tested the stuff and came to the conclusion that one hit is week, so instead I&#039;ll drop two hits at once instead of 2 hour intervals like the previous time. <br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways what should I expect? I&#039;ll be alone and dropping in the morning but being alone doesn&#039;t bother me. I&#039;ve had numerous mushroom experiences so I&#039;m no stranger to psychedelics.&nbsp;

				I probably spent months researching LSD and hearing what people had to say about it before I actually tried it. You have to see it for yourself. You may be able to get a general idea of what it&#039;s going to be like, but even the best descriptions don&#039;t give the experience justice. Make sure that when you drop you completely let go and just &quot;ride&quot; the trip.

				Set and Setting. Be in a comfortable place with people you are comfortable with. If things get difficult tell yourself that you&#039;re going to be ok and it&#039;s only going to last half the day. You&#039;ll probably be having too much fun to give a shit though.

				I would suggest drop both tabs at once rather than spaced apart, especially if you already know they are weak. Otherwise you are just going to extend the time but find its not quite as much of a high overall as it would be if you did both at once.<br /><br />Have some light hearted comedy tv shows nearby that you can focus on if you ever feel you need to escape the craziness for a while, and just relax and go with the flow. Don&#039;t try to control anything you see or experience.

				drink water, eat trail mix, smoke weed, listen to psychill, stay open-minded &amp; calm, turn off your phone &amp; hide your clocks, try not to interact too much with non-trippers if you can help it; if you must venture out into civilization I recommend wearing sunglasses.&nbsp; I agree about the lighthearted comedy shows in case something goes sour...laughter is truly the best medicine; listening to stand up comedy on acid is also incredible...these men are our modern-day prophets and sages.&nbsp; George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Mitch Hedberg, Jerry Seinfeld, Steven Wright....these are all good dudes to have around when you&#039;re trippping.&nbsp;

				If you know shrooms well, you should be pretty well-prepared. The main things I&#039;d advise are smoking some weed as it enhances the experience (especially the visuals), and just keep it mind it can last 12+ hours (ie: you can&#039;t really do work or drive or anything the whole day). I loved shrooms but then I did acid and now I love acid, so hopefully you&#039;ll have a fantastic experience!

				SET and SETTING - cannot be stressed enough.<br /><br />Chill atmosphere with good music, no non-trippers around, and no responsibilities the next day. Drink water or some nice cups of tea (just be careful not to burn yourself with the boiling water). Maybe buy yourself a glow stick too!

				1- Take always two blotters for a good trip, because blotters those days are weak (exception made for rare special batch)<br />2- Trip with a friend that you can trust<br />3- Take the two hits at the same moment than your friend (to get high at the same time)<br />4- If you like smoking weed, roll some joints BEFORE you trip (because when tripping it&#039;s very difficult to roll a joint!)<br />5- Go OUTSIDE your fucking home, take a bicycle ride (not a car ride!) the external world is beautiful and you will discover it&#039;s truly nature on LSD<br />6- ENJOY !

I may be misquoting this, and I forget which comedian said it but, &quot;LSD : the only drug that can truly turn your toaster into an entertainment center.&quot;<br /><br />Of course, that would have to be some damn good acid, heh.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to add some favorite comedians who talk about tripping a lot in&nbsp; their acts and podcasts, Joe Rogan and Duncan Trussel. They can go &#039;deep into the rabbit hole&#039;, and still pull out some laughs.
