				Hey guys. I know there&#039;s a ton of other threads out there just like this...but let&#039;s be honest, I don&#039;t want to sift through 10, 20, 40 pages of (helpful) crap. I&#039;m lazy. Get over it.<br />On to the good stuff!!<br />I&#039;ve been taking some pretty high mgs of oxycodone (hydrocodone too) every day for the past year. Only a handful of times I&#039;ve run out (like back when sr crashed in nov. and a couple of times this past summer) but it was never for more than a few days to a week at most that I didn&#039;t have anything.<br />Now, I can&#039;t imagine what heroin withdrawal would be like, because, I&#039;m telling you, the few days that I&#039;ve been out before, have been absolute hell.<br />I&#039;m actually going to quit, or at least try my best-right? I have my boyfriend&#039;s support and the semi-support of a co-worker (who&#039;s an ex-addict but doesn&#039;t actually care really). My parents don&#039;t know, actually...everyone outside of those 2 people don&#039;t exactly know about my use (nor my desire to not use).<br />So, I need some advice.<br />I&#039;m going to make the remainder of this short and sweet for those that are too lazy to read the above.<br /><br />Detoxing from: oxycodone<br />Time to do it: 2 weeks-ish (For just tapering off of the oxys. I may take longer, it may be shorter. depends)<br />Prescriptions/Drugs I take: Ambien. Weed, pre-natal vitamins (i&#039;m not preggers, they&#039;re just good for me)<br />What I have on hand: Flexeril, zanaflex, methocarbamol, imodium, more weed, benedryl/zyrtec/various cold medications<br />What I&#039;ve tried in the past: Lying on the bathroom floor/sucking it up (not effective-impractical), coke (small amounts helped with the lethargy, sleepiness, and depression-i don&#039;t want a cocaine habit though), weed (helps a bit at night, but I can&#039;t smoke during the day), all of the muscle relaxers above (either put me to sleep or just make me feel slower and nothing else)<br />What I will NOT try: suboxone/methadone (it&#039;s really impractical for me-sorry), kratom (freaks me out-don&#039;t know why, oh well)<br /><br />I do work about 4 days a week. My job DEMANDS my physical ability to perform well. But I&#039;m planning my taper and such around work, so it should be ok. I can&#039;t get time off. I won&#039;t need any drug tests performed.<br /><br />Any benzos, other medicines, suggestions, practices I can explore and utilize?<br />What can I do once the actual taper is done? I get bored easily, and obviously have access to unlimited amounts of every substance.<br /><br />I really do appreciate all the responses!!<br />To any newbies reading this who can&#039;t reply and want to offer advice or whatever, pm me.<br /><br />Oh btw-I&#039;m starting this Saturday if all goes according to plan. And my nose runs and bleeds like a motherphucker when I quit.<br /><br />Help, I need somebody! Help, not just anybody. Help, you know I need someone, help!!

				Wow, that was long. Sorry.<br /><br />One other thing I should mention, I am constantly in pain after a HUGE car accident a couple years ago plus with my work being so physically demanding.<br />No ketamine either....<br />I took 11 ibuprofen yesterday. :o Helped me get through a little bit, but no other otc does anything. Excedrin typically makes things worse too.<br /><br />Again, thanks!!

				Well congrats obviously for getting off the stuff! Drugs are great but obviously there comes a point when they start taking over and you have to sort of bite the bullet like you are doing.<br /><br />So this particular piece of advice is going to suck a little and totally understand if you can&#039;t do it but if you are positive you want to change and are sure you don&#039;t want to go back...<br /><br />Think about including your family in your recovery.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the deal, we&#039;ve all be there. The game of drugs is hide and go seek. How much can we take before we start fucking up too much? Does my boss know, friends know, parents know? We push it as far as we can go until we realize that we really can&#039;t push it any more without fucking up what&#039;s left of our &quot;old&quot; world. <br /><br />Most every addict is TERRIFIED by the possibility of their family finding out they are an addict and it becomes one of the biggest lies we tell and one of the greatest generators of the shame spiral that keeps us going. To protect the lie of our innocence we convince ourselves that we just need a little fix to be normal for a little while so no one finds out. If you&#039;re at the point of dosing yourself at just the right times of day to hold things together you&#039;re living it right now. <br /><br />If you can try to figure out a way to talk to the parents / siblings and just say I&#039;m a little fucked up, I want to clean up, I might need a little help or a shoulder to cry on the odds are you&#039;ll find out that they already knew there was a problem, they love you anyway and they will be a huge ally in getting you good again. <br /><br />Hope this doesn&#039;t come off as preachy. I know you know detox is going to suck a bit regardless of what you end up taking for it. I just know that my addictions are fueled by privacy and secrets. They grew up out of them and the only way to squash them is with openness and honesty. If you have family or friends that are emotionally available enough to be there for you the more of them the better. It creates accountability, something you need when you&#039;re feeling like crap on that 5th day and need to go to work without a fix.<br /><br />Anyway, the meds will help. Sleep is a good thing and can never get too much of it when flushing a drug out. One of the things that helps me effect change in my life is just writing down a list of what I want to do that I am not or can not do now. Save for a trip, get a better job, finish school, whatever it might be. Having something in writing that you can reflect on in those moments of decision can be a real help.<br /><br />So best of luck to you!

				i highly suggest getting your hands on some kratom... it&#039;s a plant in the coffee family with opiate-like effects, and has been used successfully to treat opioid dependence. it also happens to be an immunostimulant with 20 times the antioxidants as green tea. it&#039;s legal in the usa and i actually find it to be much more effective for pain relief than the standard opiates. this is coming from someone who suffers from chronic pain. kratomcaps.com is a good clearnet source with excellent quality and price. hope this helps. :)

				stopped reading when you mentioned heroin withdrawals would be much worse even though you took oxycodone for a year straight. thsese opiates differ mainly in potency but I understand that everyone needs some scapegoat to justify what they&#039;re doing. Anyways pull yourself together you&#039;ve been under an opiate buzz in heaven for a year so a week in hell is a small price to pay.<br /><br />One more thing better prepare for mental cravings after physical withdrawal cause it will look fun compared to them.

				I quit Heroin for good by using Psychedelic Therepy. I was going to group therepy, and to be honest, it made me worse. All you do in therepy is talk about being addicted. Twice a week I would have to be reminded about what a scum bag I was. I decided to try LSD and it completely removed the desire to use Opiates from my brain. It was as if Acid hit a reset switch in my mind. I can now say that I am entirely clean and I have no desire to use a pain killer ever in my life.<br />&nbsp;<br />My suggestion for you: Get off the pills first before you trip. Stay clean for a month or two. Then when you are feeling good (the dangerous time when most addicts relapse) take a really good LSD trip, and repeat the experience as many times as you feel you need to. My cravings disapeared,&nbsp; I don&#039;t think about needles anymore, I&#039;m not depressed, and the only drugs I need now are LSD and Cannabis.<br /><br />Good Luck. It&#039;s easy if you are brave.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Just wanted to say Good luck bro, this is coming from an ex heroin addict,<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know anything about tapering but if you could set aside 2 weeks to fully commit to quitting (i.e. call off work) and staying home I could tell you the way I quit. It was a combination of 3 8 mg suboxones, a lot of xanax, some cocaine, ketamine, and exercise.<br /><br />You also need to also have the willpower of Iron because after you finish physically withdrawing, then comes the mental withdrawal. You will have dreams of using, You will have cravings. You will dearly miss the feelings that opiates gave you. <br /><br />What made me decide to quit was the feeling of being a slave to the drug. Every waking moment was spent figuring out how to get funds for my next fix. Spoon and syringe in my pocket everywhere I went. Planning my days around my fixes. God thinking back on it I wouldn&#039;t wish opiate addiction to my worst enemies.<br /><br />Anyways I digress, I really hope you pull through with this. Rooting for you. Keep Strong

				I wish you the best.&nbsp; As other posters have said, the mental aspect of withdrawl is the worst.&nbsp; Keep your mind as busy as you can and exercise, exercise, exercise.&nbsp; When you don&#039;t want to move, get up and walk.&nbsp; Benzos help with the restless legs and sleep.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; Good luck and a quick prayer for you.&nbsp; <br />ML.

				Hey hey heyyy!!<br />16 days later, I come back...Just wanted to say thank you to everyone that replied.<br />I do appreciate all the support-more than you know. (Plus, I gave everyone a +1)<br /><br />Little update::<br /><br />I took all of your suggestions into consideration. Honestly, I kinda didn&#039;t follow a lot of them...but I really do appreciate it. Seriously! Just...some of them weren&#039;t right for me-and that&#039;s ok, I&#039;m sure it will be right for someone else.<br /><br />I&#039;m on day 3 of being clean. It&#039;s small, but I&#039;m celebrating every time I think about how I&#039;m not thinking about how much I have left--I know it&#039;s all gone, haha.<br />Last night was a bit rough. I think I just needed a good cry and temper tantrum session...I couldn&#039;t shut my brain up-the voices of the addict inside would not stfu so I haven&#039;t slept a wink. It was interesting being fucked up on ambien a good portion into the morning...<br /><br />The only thing that&#039;s bothering me (other than the insane mental desire to use, and the lack of energy I used to have) is my nose won&#039;t stop running (out of my nose and down my throat-making me cough nonstop) and I&#039;m sneezing blood. I&#039;m heading to the doctor today for that and a couple other things but...<br />Anyone have any good suggestions? I&#039;ve been eating some serious tictacs to help with the need to cough but nothing is working for this runny nose (which also consequently means I&#039;m constantly rubbing it and making it red and raw :/ help?)<br /><br />Thanks again guys. :)

				Glad your taking the steps.&nbsp; I dont take that sort of thing just because of such happenings but have had family that was way in depth.&nbsp; Its not a fun process but has its rewards, you just have to fight long enough to stay till you reap them.&nbsp; Much good luck to you.&nbsp; You have already accomplished the first step... which is only you can make you decide when is when.

				I am sure you will be successful as you sound determined. You are already doing good by coming up with a plan.<br /><br />Most of the stuff I would suggest you are already doing.<br /><br />You might want to get peppermint oil. You can have someone massage you with it which helps with sore mussels and nausea. It will help.<br /><br />This is hard to find but a tense unit can also help with pain. If you can get one it will be worth it.<br /><br />Definitely stick to your exercise routine as much as you can.<br /><br />Stock up on lite food and sports drinks to stay hydrated and get some food.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tylonal for aches and pains and fever.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t be alone. Have someone with you that will support your success and be there if anything goes wrong.<br /><br />If you are going to use benzos the best one in my opinion is Xanax. <br /><br />Distraction, distraction, distraction it will help take your mind off things. <br /><br />Use this forum or any forum to reach out for support. <br /><br />Other medications that help has pretty much been covered already so I hope this is helpful to you.<br /><br />Wish you all the success. <br /><br />

				Theres a guy called Allan Carre who wrote several books the first one being the easy way to quit smoking. I used it and it is so simple and strait up, it can be applied to anything. You are not giving up something! You are just becoming un addicted to a chem. So every time you feel sensation from that withdrawl, celebrate the fact that you are less addicted. Dont mope rejoice in being a non addict. Support your new self with good whole food, exercise and develop hobbies to keep you interested and motivated. Good luck, you can do it, do it in your mind and it will be done. Oh and if you fall , be forgiving on yourself, take breath and start again.

It is also very effective. You will find yourself doing a lot of negative self talk when going through wd. It&#039;s important that you catch yourself and change the dialogue to something more along the lines of what the poster is talking about. <br /><br />Hope you are doing well.

				All of you are so helpful, and I truly appreciate it so very much!! Once I can give karma again (72 hour rule) there&#039;s a few of you who haven&#039;t gotten any from me yet :(<br /><br />Just a little update: had the doc switch me from ambien-it stopped working-to trazodone. So far no side effects and it knocks me out.<br />Have had a sinus infection for the past few days but it&#039;s clearing up-yay!<br />On the plus side, withdrawl hasn&#039;t been too bad. Nothing I can&#039;t handle.<br />Downside-drug dreams the past couple of days. It hasn&#039;t been horrible things happening...it&#039;s just dreams that seem like every day life (in the past). I&#039;m not high in my dreams, it&#039;s just a simple using and being &quot;normal&quot; (lol)<br />Any thoughts on how to make them stop or how to better deal with them? It does bother me in the sense that I do tend to dwell on using throughout the day at least once...<br /><br />P.S. Day 8 clean!!!!! :)&nbsp; I can do it-just gotta figure out how to combat this boredom once this infection is done keeping me in bed most of the day. (I have a few ideas)<br />And...final question: any tips on getting the energy back that the drugs once gave me?<br /><br />P.P.S. It kinda makes me sad because I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be able to enjoy opiates again...at least that&#039;s what I thought just before waking in last night&#039;s dream
