				I have decided to write an essay on the safety of LSD. Obviously I think it&#039;s safe, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas or reasons to put in the essay other than all the obvious things.&nbsp; Also if anyone knows any good scientific sources other than errowid (obviously I&#039;m using that as just a starting point) that would be great too. I&#039;m hoping this will come out well, it could possibly serve the basis of a future essay I&#039;ll write about legalizing LSD for when I become politically active when I&#039;m older.

				I really don&#039;t have much to add, but I&#039;m curious about what sources other than Erowid you&#039;re looking through for your essay.

				So, with reluctance I tell you that Dr David Nutt is conducting clinical trials on the use of treatment resistant depression (in the UK)...As far as I&#039;m aware this isn&#039;t meant to be mass public knowledge but there are articles online that say this and explain it in more detail (and that also obviously reference safety) that you can use to quote from. Also, he&#039;s a Professor at Imperial in the UK and his page there should mention something about it.<br /><br />Similar trials are being conducted in the US for people with PTSD (can&#039;t remember the state, sorry). Equally, google or journal search for research done on the effectiveness of LSD as a treatment for helping people come to terms with a fatal illness. <br /><br />Recently there was research that came out of Norway or Sweden (sorry, one of the two, can&#039;t remember) on how effective LSD was at treating alcoholism and it had a success rate that far surpasses any other form of treatment.<br /><br />I know these aren&#039;t specifically on safety but I think there&#039;s an argument to be made for its use by esteemed researchers and doctors (David Nutt, is a big deal!)<br /><br />With re: safety the only thing I can think of off the top of my head is the report of the 4 guys who did mg&#039;s of it thinking it was coke (as opposed to ug&#039;s). They were taken to hospital and (from memory, so could be wrong) at least 2 of them were released after 12 hours. I think the other 2 stayed slightly longer and were followed up on for a year but were deemed perfectly healthy. <br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d look for literature that was attempting to use it in a safe and effective way (clinical trials, LSD therapy - look up Grof) and look at how they justify their use/counter the &#039;safety&#039; issue. Any study conducted within the past 20-30 years will have to make some mention regarding safety given the bad press the drug has.<br /><br />PS. Just in case you don&#039;t know who David Nutt is, in brief, he was senior drugs adviser for the home secretary in the UK and he was fired for criticizing the UK&#039;s decision to toughen the law on cannabis. He accused them of &#039;distorting&#039; evidence. Despite this he&#039;s one of the most respected Neuro-Psychiatrist&#039;s in the academy.<br /><br />

				Oh, because the guy who told me did so in a very cloak and dagger way. I asked my psychiatrist if we could try some form of LSD treatment for my mental health problems (mainly, treatment resistant depression and PTSD, lol) and he literally blurted it out like he&#039;d been waiting years to tell someone this huge secret and then looked very remorseful! I suspect his remorse was about reaffirming LSD as a treatment option :) But who knows, maybe the whole thing&#039;s a huge secret. <br /><br />Plus, I&#039;d taken lots of adderall to work on my own paper and it just seemed to sound good :)<br /><br />Good luck!

				There is a documentary about LSD called &quot;Beyond the Within&quot; which tells a pretty cool history, the comments from professors and historical events may give you avenues to explore. It tells how the first drug safety experiments were conducted and stuff, quite a cool movie.
