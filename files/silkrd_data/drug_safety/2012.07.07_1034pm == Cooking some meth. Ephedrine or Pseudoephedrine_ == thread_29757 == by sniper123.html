				so you end up with some peanut butter type stuff or what? couldn&#039;t you wash that with acetone repeatedly until you get it as clean as you want and then, rock it to shard with an alcohol evaporation?

				Right on, its funny, even when the dope is super clean you can still sort of taste the method that was used for the reaction.

				i have been watching the show &quot;breaking bad&quot; and i have to say, im not a meth user but after seeing all those wads of cash i think it would be a good business to get into. does the shake and bake method actually yield a decent amount?

				bro biggest problem with the meth game is feds, they can wrap your ass up in a conspiracy case so quick you won&#039;t know where teh 120 months they judge just hit you with came from. had a cellie who had just gotten sentenced for a meth ring. 18 years give or take some good time, who knows if his stash will still be there after his bid. you have to weigh cash vs a long time behind a fence.
