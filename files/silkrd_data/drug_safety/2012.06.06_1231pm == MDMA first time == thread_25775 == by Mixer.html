				Hi guys :)<br /><br />Next saturday me and a friend of mine are going to try MDMA for the first time. We&#039;ll take 80-100mg each (we&#039;re splitting a 160-200mg pill). We are both sensitive to pretty much anything so I think this dose will be fine.<br />We are going to have a small party with some of our classmates, about 20 people. I&#039;m also djing the party. But we don&#039;t want others to know we are rolling (fucking propaganda, they all believe it fries your brain and shit). Most of them haven&#039;t any experience with drugs (I came into class stoned as hell and they just thought I was a bit ill...) and they will be tipsy/drunk.<br />Can we hide the fact that we&#039;re rolling? Maybe saying we are drunk?<br />I can hold myself pretty well (I talked to my parents tripping on 1mg of 25I without much problems) but my friend is paranoid about it...<br /><br />Thanks :)<br /><br />BTW, we have brown eyes so dilated pupils isn&#039;t a problem and we&#039;ll take magnesium for jaw clenching. We&#039;re going to drink a bit of alcohol (like 1 drink every hour or so). Don&#039;t say don&#039;t drink, I have done my research and a little bit of it stops the hypertermia, reducing sweating and neurotoxicity. It also helps with jaw clenching.

				You&#039;ve pretty much answered your own question there buddy, you&#039;re taking all the relevant precautions etc.<br /><br />I can guarantee you that the pill you have doesn&#039;t contain anywhere near&nbsp; 160 - 200mg MDMA though. And personally when I split a pill, even good ones, with alcohol, I don&#039;t feel a thing. I usually take two pills to get a party started and I&#039;m still fine, can still work etc.

				Hmm well, might want to start off with a quarter. <br />You say you&#039;re both pretty sensitive, so I&#039;d start it slow. <br />Also I&#039;ve seen a friend of mine DJ at a gig before when he was rolling out of his mind, everything sounded like crap but he had the time of his life lol.. <br /><br />But question yourself, do you really want to do MDMA for the first time in a crowd full of people who despise drug use? <br />Why not save it for after the party or something, or another time.. Not having to worry about people noticing makes the experience even better.. <br /><br />Just my thoughts here :P

				Nothing makes my high worst than having to hide it, I haven&#039;t been in that situation with rolling since the people I know I would be better off hiding that I have it or they&#039;d be on my ass trying to get some rather than hiding the fact I&#039;m on it.<br /><br />If they&#039;re going to be drinking heavily then I&#039;d imagine you can hide it pretty well as long as your friends aren&#039;t the types that the first time they take it they spend most of their time talking about it, describing how fucked up they are and asking how you feel etc.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t know how you would hide taking nbome from your parents, even with brown eyes if the rooms decently lit it&#039;s quite a shock to see someone&#039;s pupils looking like dinner plates.

				I&#039;d save it for when you&#039;ll be in a setting that you&#039;ll be completely comfortable with. Worrying about people &quot;finding out&quot; is the quickest way to ruin a trip for me, personally.

				like others have said that isn&#039;t really a nice setting, do it with people you are comfortable with even together it would be great (make sure you have the opportunity to dance though!! :D)

				Dude dont try and hide it, it will just ruin the roll and make you paranoid... <br /><br />Secondly once you start rolling , your gonna want to tell&nbsp; EVERYONE how fucking great you feel and thats best part of MDMA!<br /><br />Just embrace it dude, or just try it with your mate somewhere more private...<br /><br />
