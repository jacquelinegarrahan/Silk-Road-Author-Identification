				So I have a small straight tube bong that I want to use for concentrates.&nbsp; I&#039;m stuck between buying a nail/dome setup or a curve/pad rig.&nbsp; Pros/Cons of both as far as price vs quality?<br /><br />I&#039;ve hit both and was impressed by a sweet nail/dome but I just love the way the skillet looks and performs.

				Go for the domies!<br />I own both a nail and a skillet.&nbsp; The skillet was my first piece and I thought it could never get better than that.&nbsp; But then the day came where I had the money to invest in a titanium nail and dome setup, complete with water filtration.&nbsp; I was literally blown away and passed out in the middle of the day after 2 hits. Now the skillet just collects dust in my closet.&nbsp; The major pro of the nail setup is the heating process, it is SO much easier to get my nail red hot, due to its smaller size.&nbsp; Also, the nail&#039;s small surface area ensures that no oil goes astray.&nbsp; Just my 2 cents :)

				They are both fun.&nbsp; Its hard to say one is better than the other.&nbsp; However I will say that although it is pretty straight forward to vape using a skillet it does require a little more practice that a dome and nail.&nbsp; They really end up costing around the same price just don&#039;t let yourself get screwed on a nail.

				I prefer ti nail/dome setup, but it&#039;s really a personal preference thing.&nbsp; If you take earth-shattering sized dabs and aren&#039;t accident prone I&#039;d vote skillet, otherwise nails are just more my style.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen some pretty gnarly burn marks from people getting too high and grazing the back of their hand on ti-pads though, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />If you go w/ a nail setup, I&#039;d highly suggest spending the extra bucks on one of the adjustable ti nails.&nbsp; That way if you ever get a new dome/female you won&#039;t have to worry about the height of the nail being correct.&nbsp; Also, some of them come w/ different nail heads, so you can keep a small one on most of the time to minimize heating time and then screw on the big boy when you&#039;re trying to get weird with it.<br /><br />My buddy was trying to explain to me these new domeless nails the other day, but I couldn&#039;t really grasp the concept/don&#039;t smoke enough to care lol.&nbsp; I&#039;d say do some research into those though - he&#039;s a huge oil-head, and was pretty fucking excited about them after hitting one.
