				Hopefully after someone falls out of their chair from laughing they will have a truthful answer for my questions.<br /><br />I got a ten strip from the Flying&nbsp; Dutchman and everything is great but my girl friend is all worked up from reading about people passing off RC&#039;s as LSD so we decided to test the shit out. So I&#039;m at my, I&#039;ve got my ten strip and my stupid fucking narco pouch ehrlich&#039;s reagent test thing and I&#039;m ready to go. I chop off like maybe a quarter to a third of a hit, wasteful I know but we want to know what crazy chemical we&#039;re eating, and I toss it into the pouch. I start breaking up the ampoule things from left to right like the directions indicate when jesus fucking Christ the mother fucker cut me. I&#039;m all like, what the fuck, I&#039;m squeezing the plastic part in the middle so why is this thing cutting me, I&#039;m trying to wipe the blood off the thing as I pass it to my girlfriend. So she is checking it out and it&#039;s starting to change color which is cool so she shakes it up a little bit when HOLY SHIT a fucking dollop of the chemical crap splooges all over my acid. Obviously, not the acid in the pouch, no,&nbsp; the rest of my stuff that I had carelessly left unprotected on the counter. A big&#039;ol drop of that chemical crap just splashed down all over my LSD.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m all pissed off and freaking out because my shit&#039;s all soaked. The only saving grace is that it turned bright fucking purple so it&#039;s good fucking acid but it really sucks that like a third of my shit is covered in this crap. Anyways, since it was just a drop I let it dry into the mother fucker. I figured if I shook it off or dried it with something else I might remove some of the lsd along with the wet. So it&#039;s just sitting there, drying out in the open air and I hope I didn&#039;t ruin it.<br /><br />My primary concerns are these:<br /><br />Is there anything in that test kit that will destroy, neutralize, or otherwise degrade my LSD?<br /><br />Is there any danger or concern with ingesting the acid that was exposed to the test reagents?<br /><br />I looked it up and there is some messed up things in there,&nbsp; p–dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, ethanol and of course... mother fucking&nbsp; hydrochloric acid.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping that the the&nbsp; hydrochloric acid and the p–dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (what ever the fuck it is?) are in such small quantities that once mixed with the ethanol and left to dry they will no longer be at toxic levels.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, did I kill my acid?

				dosent sound good id be sketch on eating it now considering there is stuff in there i couldnt pronounce. maybe since it was just a ten strip you could get another fresh one since u know its real now? sucks what happened but it would suck more if u ate sum n got sick or started trippin n had a bad trip cuz u were thinking about the shit that spilled on the paper. maybe u could research the chemicals n see if their not sum fucked up shit that will poison u. also thinking about it if it wasnt bad for u / ruin it people would let their test pieces dry out n consume it. the moisture alone from the liquid may have compromised the strip especially if it were soaked.

				Just make a sacrifice to the acid gods. Do heroic amounts of acid. It says in your post that Flying Dutchman&#039;s LSD is legit right? So get more while it lasts and dose it up :) Good to know that Flying Dutchman hooks up the killer L tho cuz my guy just got some from him too...

				Hello Everyone!<br /><br />We test every batch of LSD with the Ehrlich reagent test :) to make sure everything is up to standard. You can order with ease as both our Albert&#039;s and Avatars are top of the line Acid. <br />Then we act as guineapigs and try them out :) this is the best part of the job if you ask me hehe<br /><br />Anyways FeelingStupid we understand your frustration and these things can happen we have done some clumsy shit ourselves overtime so just shoot us a message on the main site and you will receive 5 LSD blotters free of charge.<br /><br />Now i don&#039;t want to see more of these topics of people saying their dogs ate their acid lol<br /><br />Let me also take this opportunity to promote our MDMA we have temporarily lowered our prices to get some feedback going :) Our pure clean MDMA crystals lovely stuff!<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6128024690<br /><br />Thanks and hope that we can serve everybody soon so we can spread the message that LSD carries!!! <br /><br />Greetings, The Flying Dutchman Team

				Those chemicals are usually very toxic, I don&#039;t know whats in the erlinch test but the marquis is mostly a strong acid and after the reaction is unsafe to ingest. I wouldn&#039;t eat any part of the strip that the chemical got on, only eat clean tabs. Sorry bro :(

HCL is used in very high concentrations in reagent tests. HCL can dissolve an entire human body if the concentration is high enough. When it&#039;s used in pools I&#039;m sure its a very low concentration.

				Wow, thank you, you really are one friendly flying dutchman...<br /><br />I would have never asked for someone to pay to clean up my mistakes and honestly I would almost feel bad having you reimburse me. I just wonder if I would feel worse eating poisonous tabs? Considering the data sheet lists some of the ingredients as toxic there is a real chance that eating the tabs would literally make me feel worse.<br /><br />Also, after the reagent test and prior to writing the original post I did a dose test, on the clean acid obviously, so please forgive the way I wrote that story because I was tripping balls. I usually don&#039;t curse so much, especially in my writing.<br /><br /><br />http://www.forensicssource.com/UserFiles/Documents/Product/MSDS_Test%20D.pdf<br /><br /><br />Thanks again!

				Even if the chemicals in the test kit were in small enough concentrations to be harmless...<br />I think I&#039;d have a sketchy trip just knowing that I ingested a caustic substance. Thats just me though, if you take the tabs, let us know how it goes.

I rescued a dog a while back and it had a sore, they said it would heal in a week but it didn&#039;t and after 2 months it turned into a giant boil that they had to lance and they gave me a script for tramadol. My sister had come over and her loser boyfriend was with her and he swiped the tramadol from the counter, how I get what was left of that back is a whole different story. <br /><br />But my dog was obviously in pain, blood running down him but they told me to let it run. There was no way they would give me another prescription, so I gave him the only pain relief I had - a fentanyl patch. I figured I would dose it by cutting a strip off it for him, what I didn&#039;t know is that if you cut fentanyl patches they release faster and are more intense.<br /><br />He was nodding out, I was scared at first, Googling everything I could find but he seemed OK. He just sat in the kitchen I blocked him off in, licking stainless steel appliances for 4 or 5 hours straight.

				The Flying Dutchman is simply a god among men, he actually fallowed threw and mailed me a replacement 5 strip!<br /><br />The dutchman has saved me from my own stupidity and proved why he is the best vendor on SR. <br /><br />I also want to add that when he asked me to PGP him my address again so he could send the replacements he scored some extra kudos from me because that proves he doesn&#039;t save address&#039;s because I had originally placed my order only a week before and he had already deleted it. No fear of my personal info being left on his computer, very professional in my book.<br /><br />I simply can&#039;t pile enough praise on the Flying Dutchman, thank you, thank you and thanks again.
