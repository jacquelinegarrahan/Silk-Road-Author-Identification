				For me adderall does the trick...but enough about me.&nbsp; As far as any new kinds of stims that have the desirable effects that you are looking for...I don&#039;t believe that there are any others that will not be addictive.&nbsp; It all depends on the persons self-control and also the tolerance.&nbsp; You could look into a couple of different variations of mephedrone, such as Camfetamine, but I am not sure they would have any major differences.&nbsp; Hope this helps

				I want to try Modafinil, by the research I did it sounds as what you are looking for, it basically is like adderall without the high, only the alertness, so id suggest you to try that, I want to see if any drugstore sells it to me without the Rx. I read that in the US it is sold as Provigil in my country it is sold as Ritalin, it is used for add and adhd but also for narcolepsy so it should be easier to get than adderall (legally).
