				Good morning, Silk Road travelers.<br /><br />A friend of mine often uses me to buy drugs from the Silk Road, and this time he wants some heroin. He&#039;s an experienced user, but his only route of administration is injecting.<br />He asked me if I would like to try some with him when he gets it, and I told him I would love to. I have never tried heroin before, and I can NOT inject it even if I wanted to. I&#039;m more interested in smoking it.<br /><br />I just have a few questions:<br /><br />It&#039;s vaporized, just like meth when you smoke it, right?<br /><br />Is a glass meth pipe acceptable to use to smoke heroin?<br /><br />Does it matter if it&#039;s powder or tar heroin? Is one less suitable to smoke than the other? He is going to inject his, so I want to make sure I get the right kind for him.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if there is an existing thread on this topic, but I couldn&#039;t find one.<br /><br /><br />Thank you my darlings.

				I dont know anything about smoking heroin.&nbsp; But just IV it, its 100x better :D&nbsp; Get your friend to inject it in you and youll be gtg. Just use the smallest amount though, a few grains of sand bascially.

				Don&#039;t listen to him!!!!!!! that is VERY bad advice <br />you DO NOT want to start using heroin IV&#039;ing, either snort or smoke it to begin with.<br />This is coming from a EXPERIENCED user, heroin dealer(IRL) and future vendor.<br /><br />Depending on the strength of the dope you get, you can start off with like a fraction of powder(like 5mg or so, very small amounts) As you can always take more later, but can&#039;t take less..<br />If your thinking about getting something stronger(IE pebbles), DO NOT as some of the stronger dope out there is very potent(1/4 a point gets an experienced user a good high, more than likely give a opiate naive user a BAD time full of puking.)<br /><br />I am sorry for the lecturing, but I rather someone be fully informed about the strength of the drug they are going to use. <br /><br />since you want to smoke it, #3 would be better as its in base form, but your friend will need to add some citric acid to turn the #3 into a HCL. <br />Alternatively you could get #4 and just snort a little bit instead of smoking.<br />

				yea def dont start out IV. i would suggest like opi get the #4 and he can iv and you can snort, very small amount at first. OR there is the option of tar. if your friend wants to go that route or just get some of each. PJ has some bomb tar and imo its very fun to smoke especially for first time and it has an extra oomph on the high with the presence of 6-mam. get some tinfoil and half a fingernail amount, put some straw in your mouth and flame about 1inch +/- away from the foil. then chase the dragon! hopefully your friend has some experience here or you can research more, as it can be a bit awkward at first, like hitting a bong for the very first time haha.

				If it is for your friend and he is injecting then I wouldn&#039;t get No. 3 but if you want to smoke and he injects get some of the good tar from Pharmer John. Both of you will be really happy.<br /><br />Other than the normal stuff from W007 or Tony, but I wouldn&#039;t waste it by smoking, and would snort it instead.<br /><br />Tar is the best bet for inject and snorting, although long term use (years of regular use) isn&#039;t good on the veins, but I can&#039;t imagine putting No. 3 with citric acid in your veins is any better.<br /><br />Just my opinion from a 3 year daily ex-user who has done lots of No.4 and a little tar.
