				Hi All, <br /><br />My second post so go gentle!<br /><br />I&#039;m slowly working through my &quot;to-do&quot; chemical list on SR and I&#039;m now onto LSD.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my first purchase resulted in two tabs that didn&#039;t have an effect.<br /><br />I&#039;ve eye&#039;d a new seller but having read about a potential - &#039;bad trip&#039; - I&#039;d like to have a &#039;survival pack&#039; on hand just in case.<br /><br />Part of this kit will be some Benzos but this is a whole new area to me too.<br /><br />I&#039;m unsure whether this topic can discuss specific sellers - but can someone point me onto the right Benzo type &#039;specifically&#039; for LSD.<br /><br />I can see lots of lists in the Benzo section but I&#039;m not sure of what chemical/mg to get and indeed how many would be needed for safe passage of the first trip - It&#039;ll be the g/f and I dropping and we weight about 9 stone each.<br /><br />Cheers for the heads up.

				Hey man,<br /><br />I suggest Diazepam (Valium) as the benzo of choice to smoothen out a bad trip. For your weight, 10-20 mgs to &quot;mellow&quot; out the bad vibes, and 40-50 mgs to flatten out the LSD almost completely and get some sleep.<br /><br />That is, if you don&#039;t got tolerance to the stuff (popping them for fun).<br /><br />There are faster working benzo&#039;s, but Diazepam is the &quot;golden standard&quot; and is easy to dose IMO, thats why I always keep it on hand in case shit happens.<br /><br />I heard Xanax is good too, but I vouch for Valium.<br /><br />Have fun!<br /><br />dry<br /><br />

				Good direction.&nbsp; I&#039;d agree - if you are really in a bind mentally, then from personal experience, 10mg diazepam should take the edge off a bit, 20mg diazepam should relax you enough to chill it right the fuck out and take the pressure off.&nbsp; This is assuming you are in a bind on say... 200 mics.&nbsp; I can&#039;t really speak for higher dose trips.&nbsp; Your mileage may vary of course.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think you want something too intense as I&#039;m guessing you want to stay in the trip rather than knock yourself out of the trip and into sleep.

				@aurorag<br /><br />Welcome to SR :)<br /><br />Sorry to here that your first purchase resulted in 2 bad tabs :/ . A number one rule is that you should always do your research into your vendor! even if it means reading 500+ pages of reviews.<br /><br />Also you need to make sure that what you get is real lsd and not some nasty research chemical like DOB (Dimethoxybromoamphetamine) it&#039;s poison and can kill if you OD on DOB.<br /><br />If it&#039;s real lsd you will know it in about 60 minutes+ after taking your first tab if it&#039;s DOB it will be more like 3+ hours before you feel the effects.<br /><br />Since this is your first time taking lsd I strongly suggest reading my post about my first lsd trip experience as it contains some important safety information and insight into using lsd.<br /><br />My First LSD Trip (Trip log included)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12204.0 <br /><br />Oh and as for Benzo&#039;s I use 10mg Diazepam (Valium) tablets. Just to warn&nbsp; Benzo&#039;s wont abort a trip but it will calm you down. Once you have taken the tab there is no going back.<br /><br />Best regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				LSD usually kicks in in 90-120 minutes with me, but maybe that depends on metabolism I guess. On Erowid they keep the max range for effects to kick in at up to 120 minutes. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard the old saying, &quot;if its bitter its a spitter&quot;, but usually LSD has an unpleasant metallic taste for me, so I don&#039;t know if its true or not..and that was lab tested LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that DOB and other research shit is put on blotter paper that is thicker than normal blotter paper, but since this is your first trip I don&#039;t expect that you see the difference ;)<br /><br />Just use a trip sitter, common sense and do it when the vibes is right, and i&#039;m 99% sure you won&#039;t need the benzo&#039;s. And don&#039;t go over 150-200 mics the first time, although I suggest you use at least 100 mics the first time. I used 60 mics the first time and although it was brilliant, the second time (120 mics) was MUCH more intense (but not frightening).<br /><br />Have fun!<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t take clonazepam before a trip. It will totally kill the trip. Not literally but it makes it no fun.<br /><br />Clonazepam is also long acting a consistent release benzo just fyi.

				No, xanax is a benzo, about 2-3 times stronger than valium IMO.&nbsp; Aka alprazolam.

				I&#039;d say no more then 5mg of Valium (Diazepam) if you start to think about negative things. Really just maybe take 10mg after the trip is over and you want to get some sleep. However, a Far more effective solution is to change your Setting i.e. Go outside, or back inside.<br /><br />Your preparation for an LSD trip should be 99% concerned with Set &amp; Setting. Don&#039;t trip if your dog just died, or if your head is full of stories about &#039;Bad Trips&#039;. Go camping, or at least have the ability to go outside to a privet fenced in backyard. Don&#039;t be anywhere where you will come in contact with non-tripping people and certainly not a Bank or your at home with your mom. Eat healthy food an hour before, and have food on-hand but you probably will not be hungry. Also, get a gallon of Orange Juice to drink during the trip.<br /><br />Just chill out, you are about to become the Buddha.<br /><br />I&#039;m totally disagree with the idea of having a &#039;Sitter.&#039; Someone around that is not tripping will freak you out and/or prevent you from progressing through the bardo&#039;s on the path to enlightenment as a buddhist&#039;s call them i.e. your sober sitter will act at a tether to Ego Centric thought patterns. A non-tripping sitter around could really make you have negative thoughts about your current state of mind by acting as a reference which could show you how different you perceive the world which is an idea that could scare you. Your not going to die, or jump in-front of a car or anything. LSD dose not make you a dumbass. There is ZERO need for a sober sitter. Now, if you tripped with someone who has tripped before, that is a good idea.<br /><br />DO NOT read about bad trips. You will NOT have one. They DO NOT EXISTS i.e. they are fictional made up bull-crap. All people mean by &#039;Bad Trip&#039; is they started to think about negative stuff for a period of time. It is just like normal life, some times you start to think about your dead dog, but all you have to do is turn on the TV or go for a walk to clear your mind. People also define their trip as a &#039;Bad Trip&#039; if they spent a portion of their time trying to fight against the effects i.e. trying to stay grounded, but if they would have just gone with the flow they would have been fine. There will be NO long term effects i.e. &#039;Flash Backs&#039; are 100% fictional bull shit. LSD dose not effect the functions of any vital organs and can not kill you. LSD&#039;s effects will NEVER be permanent.

Xanax is more addictive and produces more pronounced withdrawal and overdose symptoms. Xanax overdose or withdrawal is far more result in seizures then Valium. Transition to Valium first and then dosage lowering is suggested for cessation of Benzo&#039;s, for safety reasons.<br /><br />Basically, there is a whole line of Benzo&#039;s but Valium is like the mother to them all. Valium produces the same effects as all the other Benzo&#039;s, but different versions of the drug are more effective at producing certain effects i.e. Xanax is reported to be better at reduce anxiety. However, almost all the other versions have more pronounced side-effects and withdrawal symptoms and are more addictive.<br /><br />I strongly recommend to everyone to only ever take Valium (Diazepam) if you want a Benzo, and only take it every now and again to avoid addiction. <br /><br />Also, you need to know that complete tolerance to all positive effects of Valium is developed in a relatively short amount of time. You also need to know that Benzo addiction has life threatening withdrawal symptoms, and should Never be cut off Cold Turkey.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the input Valium (Diazepam) is now my permanent benzo of choice that I will stick with.<br /><br />Xanax sounds a bit dangerous to be playing about with compared to Diazepam.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for hearing me out. I am happy to hear you agree with my assessment of LSD usage.<br /><br />I am Vary happy to hear you will stick with Valium (Diazepam) and say away from all the other Benzo&#039;s. I just got done reading a vary detailed scientific report backed by proper scientific studies about Benzo&#039;s and Diazepam. (Also, one on Amphetamines see post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13244.0). What I said about them is vary true. However, I&#039;d like to say that Valium is a vary useful drug if used for the right reasons with proper dosages and time frame, and vary hard to OD on. There have even been ER cases of non-tolerant users taking 2,000mg! of Diazepam in one gulp which resulted in complete recovery. Still don&#039;t take more then you need.

				I do agree with beastie&#039;s POV on &quot;bad trips&quot; it has always been my experience that the &quot;bad&quot; is a necessary part of tripping, and without the &quot;bad&quot;, the good doesn&#039;t quite feel as good. That being said, on low doses, I usually have a great deal of anxiety (probably from trying to fight the effects), and just having benzos around really help calm me and allow me to let go, because I know I can take one if the anxiety gets to be too much

				agree, diazepam is the way to go here, to &quot;take the edge of things&quot;. On a side note, alprazolam can induce paradoxal reactions (=the contrary to what you want to achieve), I would not take this while on acid. Or in any circumstance. I consider it some of the weirdest compounds in the benzo-class. Also, withdrawal is hmh HELL.<br /><br />You are also right about (mind) set and setting being the single most important thing while on an LSD voyage.<br />However, Beastie, you&#039;re wrong about the flash-backs and LSD not having permanent effects on some people.<br />Permanent effects are in most cases linked to dosage (read up on HPPD), flash-backs however are not.<br />It&#039;s the same for all psychedelics I guess, your predisposition/genes have a lot of influence. You wouldn&#039;t be the first to go on a voyage, and come back schizophrenic/psychotic. Which means you had a predisposition for one or both, and LSD just &quot;triggered&quot; your underlying (possibly undetected) disease. Same with cannabis btw.<br /><br />The only way to really abort an acid trip is administering a 5-HT2A antagonist, in the lines of risperidone (Risperdal), chlorpromazine (thorazine) or clozapine. You will be &quot;sober&quot; in an instant. Whether you will like thàt is a totally different subject... :-)<br /><br />Keep it safe!<br /><br />Love :p<br /><br />/edit: it is also true that anxiety/chance of going &quot;bad&quot; decreases with increasing dosages. But increasing dosage, yeah, well, see the above

				I have to disagree with what some people have said regarding &quot;There&#039;s no such thing as a bad trip.&quot;<br /><br />Sometimes people accidentally, unknowingly dose way too much and freak the fuck out, and end up have terrifying hallucinations and thoughts than can leave them disturbed for a quite a while. <br /><br />This probably isn&#039;t going to happen if you&#039;re just having a couple of tabs, mind you, but it still can happen.<br /><br />Lucy will kick the shit out of you if you get arrogant, try to take a heroic dose and aren&#039;t prepared.<br /><br />[Edited because I spelled a word incorrectly.]

Really just maybe take 10mg after the trip is over and you want to get some sleep. However, a Far more effective solution is to change your Setting i.e. Go outside, or back inside.<br /><br />Your preparation for an LSD trip should be 99% concerned with Set &amp; Setting. Don&#039;t trip if your dog just died, or if your head is full of stories about &#039;Bad Trips&#039;. Go camping, or at least have the ability to go outside to a privet fenced in backyard. Don&#039;t be anywhere where you will come in contact with non-tripping people and certainly not a Bank or your at home with your mom. Eat healthy food an hour before, and have food on-hand but you probably will not be hungry. Also, get a gallon of Orange Juice to drink during the trip.<br /><br />Just chill out, you are about to become the Buddha.<br /><br />I&#039;m totally disagree with the idea of having a &#039;Sitter.&#039; Someone around that is not tripping will freak you out and/or prevent you from progressing through the bardo&#039;s on the path to enlightenment as a buddhist&#039;s call them i.e. your sober sitter will act at a tether to Ego Centric thought patterns. A non-tripping sitter around could really make you have negative thoughts about your current state of mind by acting as a reference which could show you how different you perceive the world which is an idea that could scare you. Your not going to die, or jump in-front of a car or anything. LSD dose not make you a dumbass. There is ZERO need for a sober sitter. Now, if you tripped with someone who has tripped before, that is a good idea.<br /><br />DO NOT read about bad trips. You will NOT have one. They DO NOT EXISTS i.e. they are fictional made up bull-crap. All people mean by &#039;Bad Trip&#039; is they started to think about negative stuff for a period of time. It is just like normal life, some times you start to think about your dead dog, but all you have to do is turn on the TV or go for a walk to clear your mind. People also define their trip as a &#039;Bad Trip&#039; if they spent a portion of their time trying to fight against the effects i.e. trying to stay grounded, but if they would have just gone with the flow they would have been fine. There will be NO long term effects i.e. &#039;Flash Backs&#039; are 100% fictional bull shit. LSD dose not effect the functions of any vital organs and can not kill you.

				Okay, I came on too strong about &quot;Bad Trips&quot; not being real. What I mean is that ya,... it&#039;s like a &quot;Bad Trip&quot; is not induced by the LSD/trip, (like say red wine gives me a horrible hangover, but beer dose not). I just meant that if you are excited to trip and read a lot of cool trip reports and stuff and you are not depressed you will not have a bad trip. Unless, like ya you try to fight it, don&#039;t let go and ride the wave. Like it is not the trip that is bad it is your perception of it.<br /><br />With that said, I have taken Trip&#039;s when I was depressed, in a bad place mentally, or stressed about not knowing which life path to take and then deliberately trip at troughs times to just dive head first into my problems and ya sometimes I wish I didn&#039;t trip that day (during the trip) I spend the whole time thinking about my problems really deeply (sometimes as soon as the trip starts a clear course of action so deal with the situation came clear right away and it was a good happy trip), BUT after the trip is over I almost always know exactly what I need to do to fix my life. Sometimes, not... Like instead of just keeping the stress all bottled up for months and not dealing with it, I sometimes think is worse then taking a Trip by myself and just feeling that pain and stress head on to solve it once and for-all.<br /><br />I can&#039;t stress enough how much one enjoys nature while tripping. Camping is the best thing. But then again it is nice to be in the safety of my own apartment while tripping sometimes too. I also &#039;personally&#039; have almost always not reacted well to having someone around that is not tripping. If &#039;I&#039; trip with someone ells it is like we both go on the exact same journey together and it is magical. However, &#039;I personally&#039; prefer to trip by myself all alone. I find it to be a more spiritual and enriching experience..<br /><br />Okay okay, I guess maybe in rare cases with specific people tripping could trigger some unwanted long term personality changes. I still say &quot;Flash backs&quot; i.e. actually experiencing a trip again without taking any LSD/shroom/trip have never happened from LSD/Shrooms/2C-*/TMA-2/(NormalTrip Here) and don&#039;t know how that phrase even came into existence.... Maybe because of US Government tests with really messed up drugs like BZ under the &#039;Artichoke Poject&#039; &amp; &#039;MK-Ultra&#039; (they were all really all the same program they just changed the name every 10 years so it didn&#039;t look like that big of a project on paper. Also, some branches of government where concurrently running tests).<br /><br />---My own personal permanent physiological change, story---<br />Also, I will admit my entire view of &#039;Life, the Universe, and Everything&#039; which directly effected what I valued in life changed 100% after my vary first trip (which happened to be on LSD, probably why I think it is the best trip). Before I tripped I was of the Skateboarder (punk rock band) Penywise philosophy that there is no point is thinking about Religion or Spirituality i.e. you&#039;ll find out when you die. I just thought Religion meant going to church on Sunday and believing in stories on &quot;Faith.&quot; HOWEVER, I just took like a half a hit of LSD.. maybe 60mic&#039;s barely really tripping in retrospect (with my friends but then had to go home only one hour after I dropped it. Then tripped by myself in my bedroom). I experience true 100% &quot;Enlightenment&quot; (I don&#039;t freaking care if you don&#039;t believe me. There is no way you could understand if you have not experience it too) true &quot;One with the whole universe&quot; everything made complete scents, everything is beautiful, everything is 100% interconnected even the spots on the wall, all of existence became perfectly clear. (Now I don&#039;t mean I am &quot;Enlightened&quot; right now... there are two schools of though on Enlightenment, one &quot;It is possible to experience Enlightenment forever&quot; and two &quot;Enlightenment is only a temporary experience that you have and try to take knowledge back with you from&quot;) After that first trip, I became 100% devoted to Spirituality. I now believe that I know the true meaning of Life and the Universe. I now truly believe I know what consciousness is, where we go when we die, and why we all exist. Now just after that first low dose LSD trip, I wholeheartedly believe I know what Buddha experienced under that tree and tried to tell the world about. I know what Jesus was talking about. No one can shake my foundation because I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES..... Yada yada, in the next paragraph I&#039;ll attempt to tell you what I think.... Anyway ya, that &#039;1&#039; One Single&nbsp; LSD trip completely changed me forever. However, I think for the best.<br /><br />---Okay, read if you want, There is no way to put into words the meaning of Life and the Universe but I&#039;ll try.<br />I can give you the end resulting reality, however it is impossible for me to prove it to you.<br />You just have to experience it yourself----<br />...<br />The Whole Universe, Everything your Mind to your body, to the speck of dust in outer-space, to the space in outer-space itself, is All ONE thing. Your &quot;Mind/Psyche&quot; is NOT Created from input, instead it is just the opposite. All of our &quot;Minds/Psyches&quot; are really all the SAME Singular &quot;Mind/Psyche&quot;, It is not just in Humans it is the entire Universe. What your Brain dose is not create a thought instead the &quot;Thoughts&quot; you have are really what is left over after your Brain has &quot;Filtered&quot; out the rest of the Universe i.e. Your brain is not a Computer, it is a Filter. This Brain aka Filter is crating your Personality not by Construction but by Destruction. Your unique Personality is created by the removal of the knowledge of what goes on in the rest of the universe. You can have a unique personality because of the ability to &#039;Not Know&#039; that the filter aka brain allows for. E=MC2 Energy is Matter... Matter is Energy, man f***ing mind-blowing dude. We are all the same thing.<br /><br />Several profound conclusions can be derived from this realization.<br /><br />When you Die, you Will Live On Forever. Your filter will cease to exist. As the filter is fading away in and is in it&#039;s last moments of functioning you will slowly realize everything is Okay, everything is as it should be, otherwise it would not be. During this time (to steal from Jacobs Latter but I thought the same just didn&#039;t have the words) &quot;When you die you can ether see Delves tearing your life away, or Angels freeing you from the world.&quot; However, after your brain is completely dead your personality will be completely gone, but All of your memories and experiences/love/hate/enjoyment will all still exist as part of the ONE Single Consciousness is still there which you were apart of the whole time. The One Single Consciousness will still know everything about your life, but also knows everything else about the whole universe because it is it. There is no reason to fear Death. Death is beautiful, so is birth. There is also no reason to fear life, because whatever happens to you is Okay in the end. I promise you, you will understand before it is all over with. Life is beautiful, even the parts that seem bad, even unspeakably bad things, just try not to take life so seriously. You can not fail at life.<br /><br />That realization then points to &quot;The Meaning Of Life.&quot;&nbsp; The Meaning Of Life is to create Your Own Personality, Your Own Ideas, Your Own Religion. Everyone at some point tries to understand The Meaning Of Life. I believe it is a natural drive that we all have. Sure you can look to the big Catholic Church, Universities, Philosophers, Military, or &quot;Spiritual Leaders&quot;&nbsp; and they will Give you an answer, they will give you a path, they will give you reason to live. However that is defeating the reason to exist in the first place. Think For Yourself ! Develop your own religion. Talk about religion/Philosophy with anyone you can, but Think For Yourself. Take away what you want from it. Except how who YOU interpreted what the person said. It is TOTALLY okay to go to Church on Sunday if you like to think the thoughts you do while you are there. HOWEVER, Be Honest with yourself, and the rest of the world. Don&#039;t call yourself a &quot;Christian&quot; or &quot;Buddhist&quot; don&#039;t blindly &quot;Have Faith&quot; tell people what YOU THINK what YOU BELIEVE, how you interpreted the bible passage. Maybe it is vary vary close to your “Spiritual Advisory” however it is not identical, don&#039;t group yourself in, and through in the towel by calling yourself Christian. Also, encourage others to Disagree With You, encourage others to develop their own Religion, their Own beliefs, their Own Way Of Looking At The Universe and The Meaning Of Life. We all are part of ONE ALL KNOWING CONCISENESS, but that ONE CONCISENESS developed You, YOUR BRAIN, Us, Humans to Un-know it all so each of us can develop our own personalities and solutions. The existence of the brain which servers to disconnect us form reality MUST mean The Meaning Of Life is to develop something NEW. Sure, it is easy to just fill that whole in your hart/mind with Christianity or something, but if you are just going to do what everyone else dose, or believe what your &quot;Spiritual Leader&quot; tells you to, there is no reason for you to exist in the first place. You may as well just be the ONE ALL KNOWING SINGULAR CONCISENESS which is already all the same thing.<br /><br />Think For Yourself, Develop your Own Religion, Embrace Uniqueness=That is the Meaning of Life<br /><br />In fact,&nbsp; (if I remember correctly the Gospel of Thomas agrees with my next realization about the teachings of Jesus) Jesus Himself was trying to tell the world the SAME THING I just said. When people speak of &quot;GOD&quot;, God is not some separate conciseness that created everything, &quot;GOD&quot; is the &quot;ALL KNOWING SINGULAR CONCISENESS.&quot; When the bible says we are made in God&#039;s Image what it means is we truly ARE made in God&#039;s image i.e. your personality is a peace of the one singular universal conciseness. When Jesus says, &quot;God is in the mustered seed.&quot; He was trying to tell you that EVERYTHING is ONE. Yes, God is Omnipotent he is even in the small mustered seen, God CAN Hear you Pray, God Dose Answer Pairs, because we are all part of the same thing. What you do effects everything in the universe and everything in the universe effects you. When Jesus said, &quot;The Only way to Heaven is Through me. Believe in me and you will live forever in the kingdom of Heaven&quot; He didn&#039;t mean literally believe in HIM, he meant believe in what he was trying to teach you. He didn&#039;t mean Heaven as a physical place your soul goes to when you die. He was simply saying you need to let go when your brain/filter starts to stop working i.e. see &quot;Angels Freeing You from the world.&quot; This also explains why the 10 commandments are what they are (okay, first of all, as you now know I believe all advertised/organized strict religions are fake, simply tools created by people used to exploit the basic human drive to define the meaning of life.... So, some the the 10 commandments are simply for that goal. On top of that &quot;King James&quot; was a ruthless leader who wrote the King James Bible from a collection of writing simply to force upon his empire which had gotten to large. He used this Bible he wrote to instill a common view of the Universe into all the people. This way there is a common Moral structure and the blatant Dictator role God has in his book is clearly there to make Dictatorships seem natural. This makes people fare easier to control. Look at India....see people far less easy to control with such religious thinking.) Back to the Ten Commandments meaning {or at least a proper way to interpret} them such as, if you are longing for and/or seal something from someone it separates you from God in the scents that it reinforces the idea that there is a separation between you and the other person i.e. sealing or longing for someone else&#039;s things is reinforcing the false view of reality that you and the other are two separate things. When you realize you only have a short time to exist, (yes but your memories will live on in the &quot;Unified Consciousness&quot;) you only have a short time to develop your own views of the universe, create your own life, be free of the &quot;All Knowingness&quot; to create your own &#039;Knowing.&#039; These realizations also support the idea of &quot;Karma.&quot; Sure, everything you do will come back to you because we are all the same thing.<br /><br />Think For Yourself, Develop Your Own Religion !<br /><br />Even while within the Ego Centric plane of consciousness that is &quot;The waking state of consciousness&quot; it should be easy to comprehend the &#039;concept&#039; of how your unique personality [aka Ego], view of the universe, is purely the result of &quot;Filtering&quot; of your connection to the universe, as opposed to &quot;Construction&quot; of your connection to the rest of the universe. Consider this, you &quot;See&quot; because your eyes only interpret a vary small part spectrum of electromagnetic frequency range referred to as&nbsp; &#039;Visible Light.&#039; If you could &quot;See&quot; the whole electromagnetic frequency rage it would be far more difficult to tell the difference between where you think something begins and where it ends. Consider this, the reason any physical object can exist is because of attractive and repulsive forces we call + Positive and – Negative. The elections are negatively charged, protons positively charged to the same amount electrons are negative, and neutrons have no charge. Also, know that opposites attract and likes repel, also every election has exactly the same charge and mass as every other election, same goes for protons and neutrons{{side,.. side note, for got the physicists name but.. he called his friend and said, “I”VE GOT IT!!!! every electron has exactly the charge and mass because they are all the SAME ELECTRON, it is just bouncing in and out of our [universe/dimension, I can&#039;t remember the word he used] into different spots super fast ”}},.. Also know that the Electron orbital&nbsp; cloud or subshell wants an evenly balanced electron pair spinning in opposite directions i.e. -1/2 ,+1/2 as well i.e. &#039;like Take&#039; I=subshell-states I= 0,1,2,3 aka I=s,p,d,f then this equation 2(1*I+1)=number of electrons wanted to be in that subshell. Then consider Oxygen with atomic# 8 i.e. 8 Protons, which you know with simple Logic will want 8 Electrons, However the subshells of Oxygen want two more electrons, i.e. Oxygen O8 Electron Subshells s^2,2s^2,2p^4 ..that&#039;s.. 2+2+4&nbsp; leaving. the 2p wanting 2 more electrons i.e. 2(1*2+1)=p^6 not p^4... (6 - 4 = 2electrons). This is why Oxygen will bond at Two places with other atoms. Like Hydrogen with an Atomic# 1 i.e. 1 Proton, which logically will want 1 Electron, however subshell 0 which is an &#039;s&#039; wants one more, 2(1*0+1)=s^2...(2-1=1electron). Therefore Oxygen will bond to TWO Hydrogen&#039;s to form H2O i.e. two hydrogen and one Oxygen. Then so yes there is vary strong inter-molecular bonding in water, because the Oxygen now has a charge of Negative Two...i.e. O8 =.charge.+8 plus -8 electrons originally plus the -2 electrons from the two Hydrogen atoms i.e. Positive8 + Negitive8 + Negivitve2 = +8/-10 that is vary strongly negative with little positive repulsion. This inter-molecular bonding is strengthened even more by the fact that because the Hydrogen only has One Proton it&#039;s Electrons are completely forfeit to the Oxygen with Eight Protons. This creates a Water Molecule H2O with a -2charged. Oxygen atom that only has a repulsive positive force of +8 &amp; negative -10 and 2 Hydrogen&#039;s Protons at a pure +1 &amp; and no Negative charge at all. This leads to vary strong inter-molecular bonding of the +1Hydrogen atoms the water molecule are vary strongly attracted to the +8/-10 Oxygen atom&#039;s of adjacent water molecules. This is why bugs can walk on water, and why the water level in your class is so much higher on the sides of&nbsp; the glass then the center. The molecules in the center are being pulled down by inter-molecular bonds from all directions, as opposed to the ones on the side only being pulled from below and one side. Furthermore, the +1 Hydrogen nuclei push each other away so they bond to the Oxygen at 104.5degrees instead of 109degrees like they should be in at the 2p subshells. These properties are why frozen water is less dense then liquid water by 9%. The +1 Hydrogen atoms on the water molecule inter-molecularity bond to the +8/-10 Oxygen atom of the adjacent water molecules at a wide angel which leaves a big gap i.e. when water is liquid it has enough kinetic energy to brake the inter-molecular bonds, but in Ice form the bonds are formed. So back to the point, the entire existence of different molecules are the result of a “Filtering” property not “Creating.” The atoms can only bond in a cretin way this is what enables them the ability to make different things. If every atom could form any type of bond there would be no-matter. Now consider Energy, because Any energy from any source in any for can be converted into any other form of energy, we humans took a long time to notice Energy even existed, but I guarantee you that even a cave man knew matter existed. It is purely the ability to limit somethings interaction with something ells that makes something exist. The same is true with one signaler conciseness and&nbsp; your personal perspective..<br /><br />Think for yourself, Develop Your Own Religon

				Whoa boy that&#039;s a lot of text.<br /><br />There is no point to this post other then I got a kick out of &#039;election&#039;s&#039; :D.&nbsp; <br />Bugs can walk on water and water form&#039;s a meniscus because of surface tension.&nbsp; <br />The 2, 8, 8 orbital thing doesn&#039;t work once you hit the metal&#039;s, it&#039;s a function of the HOMO and LUMO of the atom which orbital an electron will occupy.&nbsp; <br />Once covalently bonded the oxygen in water doesn&#039;t carry a charge, nor do any of its atoms, or water itself.&nbsp; The molecule as a whole has a slightly -ve oxygen and slightly +ve hydrogen&#039;s because of the geometry of the molecule and the fact that oxygen is a far heavier (more protons if you wish) element.<br /><br />I ... don&#039;t know why i&#039;m correcting you, lol, pure boredom.&nbsp; I shall stop now, cool story though :D

				2mg of Xanax should knock you out enough to sleep through the trip. But I would definitely do some research about depressing your breathing while tripping. Sounds like you need someone to sit with you to supervise you and reassure you. One thing when I trip and things would hint to bad is remind yourself. It&#039;s a drug and it will wear off, you will not be like this forever.

				Ya, I was vary high when I wrote that. I should have just stopped at least after the Visible Light thing.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that many tests have shown that Psychedelic drugs create vary similar measurable changes in the brain to the effects of Buddhist monks in deep meditation. Furthermore, many of the meditation techniques employed cause the brain to create elevated levels of DMT.

Entertaining is what I was going for.... It is also a vary real permanent physiological change many people who take a trip may develop. Many books have been written discussing the Enlightened/Deeply Spiritual experience reported by many who have used psychedelic drugs, it&#039;s significance and it&#039;s resemblance to states of deep mediation.

				Going into a trip with benzos is a bit of a cop out. With acid you need to deal with the good trips and the bad ones. I wouldn&#039;t give up any of my bad trips because they taught me so much. Taking acid you need to be prepared for the good and the bad and all the weirdness in between.
