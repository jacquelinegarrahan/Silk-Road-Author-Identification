If i hadnt know what was happening and left it much longer the wall on my heart would have thickened and i would have had a heart attack (Know this due to my girlfriend being a nurse and being with me at the time). Be careful! <br />

				Smoking Changa while on MDMA is safe.&nbsp; Taking Pharmahausca or something similar is not.&nbsp;

				When smoking an MAOI it leaves your system too quickly for there to be much danger of serotonin syndrome. With long-lasting oral MAOIs it is a different story.
