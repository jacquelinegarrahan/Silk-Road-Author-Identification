				Hello, <br /><br />Now i know my own MDMA tolerance, I know my sweet spot. My question is about a person i know and I need a little advice to keep their rolls safe. <br /><br />They had never taken MDMA before, now i started them on a domestic pressed xtc pill dosage of maybe 80mgs. They took one and experienced nothing at 45min. Took another but crushed it, felt the effects for only 1 hour then no come down at all. <br /><br />A little about them, they are about 6 foot, 90kgs. Works out (body builds) and does take pre workouts regularly including DMAA, caffeine, creatine etc etc They hadn&#039;t for the previous day before the roll. Didn&#039;t consume alcohol and only energy drinks pre roll. <br /><br />The second roll i capped up one 120mg capsule and they had the capsule and another one of those 80mgs ones (should have been 200mgs). They didn&#039;t feel anything... at all... now even if the 80mgs was under that or a dud this person should have rolled off 120mgs (calibrated scale before weigh/cap). <br /><br />Now this person is under the impression that their tolerance is very high and that they require 200mgs+ to roll... In my experience i think this is dangerous. <br /><br />I have given them 1x NL 160-170mg Green grenade. I know this is tested and of good quality. If this person takes just this alone and doesn&#039;t roll... what is your advice? Seeking the advice of all MDMA lovers and users! :)<br /><br />Thanks for reading. <br /><br />

				If they don&#039;t roll balls from the green grenade then they must be on some sort of medication thats working on the serotonin receptors. Such as SSRI&#039;s or MOAI&#039;s? It may have been dud MDMA you gave them before but who knows, maybe they just have a massive natural tolerance to it. The most MDMA I&#039;ve ever consumed in one night was about 350mg&#039;s as well as 20mg&#039;s of 2c-b. Although I felt shit the next day, as long as you post/pre-load properly I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s no long term damage, so giving him 200mg&#039;s shouldn&#039;t be that much of problem. He will probably just be quite fucked up and loving life lol.

				some people just react differently to certain chemicals, there is a chance that person may have an unnaturally high tolerance but not likely for a fifth gram of mdma - that much should have at least had moderate effects<br /><br />dmaa is a norepinephrine releasing agent. since it acts a stimulant in a way it might also have slight effects on or at least downstream on dopamine and serotonin too. that could have at least made him insensitive to the strong stimulant effects on the peripheral nervous system. <br />&nbsp;<br />or is he possibly taking an antidepressant, some of which can produce desensitization to mdma? with dmaa, it could be just like people on SSRIs, they basically cant roll because the receptors are down regulated to maintain homeostasis and thus pretty much tolerant to the effects of mdma releasing serotonin, but in his case its mainly norepinephrine, so he should have gotten a positive mood lift at least just maybe not as much energy <br /><br />tell em to stop wasting your drugs :)

				Hey guys, <br /><br />Thanks for the replies. I think i might actually ask him if hes on any SSRI&#039;s, that seems like a good reason for it. <br /><br />He has also been taking dexies for study and he again noted he had to take a whole hand full to experience what was his &quot;level&quot;. Im not sure but i do agree than 200mgs+ shouldn&#039;t hurt him. If he needs 300mgs for a decent roll then i wouldn&#039;t supply him.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t mind him buying my drugs haha It just feels shit telling someone about ecstasy and having them try twice to roll and get nothing at all... I personally believe that its an amazing/life changing first trip if it lasts 6 hours and your &quot;free&quot; in the love haha :P<br /><br />

				Hi!<br /><br />I did my first roll a while ago and I&#039;ve also been using DMAA almost a year now. A half defqon pill made me roll quite nicely so I would imagine a full one (around 200mg) should be quite crazy :D I took one half at a time and a total of two pills which was a bit too much. :)<br /><br />It would be quite strange if 200mg hit doesn&#039;t do anything for your friend.&nbsp; :)
