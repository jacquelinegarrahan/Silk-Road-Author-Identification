				I&#039;m new to SR and just getting ready to make my first purchase.&nbsp; An occasional H user I&#039;ve only ever used the brownish/ white powder that comes in little blue stamped bags.&nbsp; Common in the NJ, Ny, Philly area. During my search on SR I&#039;ve come across H with numbers in front of it....Like #3 or #4, I also see a lot of black tar.&nbsp; What do the numbers mean, and what is the best H for IV usage?&nbsp; <br />My apologies of this question has already been asked.&nbsp;

				Mate if your wondering why nobody has answered, It&#039;s probably the fact you have to read and research every vendor and the information will be here, People don&#039;t want to answer questions that could have and will have been&nbsp; been answered&nbsp; with a click or 2. Search for your topic. Don&#039;t ask silly questions dude, People won&#039;t walk through it with you holding your hand mate, They figure ,if you can&#039;t work it out for your self then you probably shouldn&#039;t be here. Think about it&nbsp; in the real world. And why let people know you hit up shoot up heroin? there is no need, You know heroin&nbsp; addicts get zero respect on the street it&#039;s no different&nbsp; here don&#039;t broadcast your drug/drugs of choice, Unless It&#039;s&nbsp; a pm for vendor and even then you should read all and&nbsp; every bit of the vendors profile. Hope&nbsp; this helps&nbsp; a bit.Feel free to PM&nbsp; if you&#039;re really stuck but just devour everything on here OK.

				heroin is a bad drug. A lot of h sellers here on SR buy cheap stamp bags and then cut those and sell em for a&nbsp; high prices. Do a lot of research before you buy. Look for reviews from respectable members. Be safe. My recomemdations are, <br /><br />FOR #4 Power- 1gram from Tomorrowman BEST IVE EVER DONE BAR NONE.<br /><br />FOR BTH (#2?)-1 gram from NOD.Very good for smoking on foil or cooking up a nice shot.<br /><br />Do a lot of research before you buy.
