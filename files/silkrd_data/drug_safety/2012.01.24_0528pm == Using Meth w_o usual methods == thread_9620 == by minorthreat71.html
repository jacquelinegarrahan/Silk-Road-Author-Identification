				I want to try it, but I&#039;d rather not snort, IV, or god forbid - plug.&nbsp; <br /><br />Could in be dissolve it in water - or better yet - coffee, and simply drink&nbsp; it?&nbsp; I&#039;m aware that the potency will likely be diminished; how much I haven&#039;t a clue.&nbsp; I&#039;m sick of buying way overpriced adderall and thought of this as an option. <br /><br />Feedback much appreciated.

				its just as potent taking it orally as it is the other methods -- the bio-availability of the drug isn&#039;t more than 20% difference in all the methods... IV being the highest (98%), orally being the least (i think around 78-80%). the only real difference is that the &quot;rush&quot; from either smoking or banging isn&#039;t as pronounced. the euphoria, concentration, and energy is definatly as effective via all the methods. it also lasts longer... don&#039;t take 10mg of meth at 1pm... or you&#039;ll be up till 6am.<br /><br />this is how i use the drug, i made my own stacks (pills) by combining meth, caffiene, and dmaa along with glucosamine in a capsule.<br /><br />The thing with meth is it&#039;s potent... 5mg will feel like 20-30 of adderall (this is subjective of course). It&#039;s also water soluable so it&#039;ll soak right through your skin when handling - I suggest using latex gloves and a precise MG scale when dosing.<br /><br />It is a pain in the ass to handle/dose compared to adderal, but it&#039;s so much cheaper -- worth it imo.

				If you don&#039;t have a good mg scale, there is another option - volumetric measurement.&nbsp; Basically, dissolve 100mg in 2.5 cups of water.&nbsp; Then, when you want to dose, measure out 1/4 cup of water (after mixing, just to be sure) and drink it.&nbsp; Since there is 100mg in 2.5 cups, each 1/4 cup contains 10mg.&nbsp; You can play around with the measurements as you wish, just double check your math if you are at all unsure.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if there is a danger of meth degrading if stored in water over time.

				Excellent. <br /><br />Primarily, I&#039;m concerned with the varying degrees of potency as related to addy.&nbsp; I suppose moderation is key, whatever that means.&nbsp; Oh well, I&#039;ve taken upwards of 100 mg of adderall over a few hours, so I suppose my tolerance is higher than normal.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Anyhow, thanks for the tips, much appreciated.

				For me meth seems about twice as potent and lasts around twice as long as Adderall. Amphetamines last 4-6 hours and meth 8-12 hours or more depending on the dose I take.<br /><br />If you take 100mg of Adderall then you might need 50mg of meth to get where you want to go. I&#039;ve never taken more than 60mg Adderall and I was speeding off that. <br /><br />When I did meth everyday I could fall asleep about 4 hours after my last bump and had no trouble eating. The side effects mostly went away, but so did many of the positive effects. <br />

				A few beers helps me sleep after taking it, if no beers maybe 36-48 hours no sleep, with a six pack after last smoke maybe only 24 hours, and beers always make you feel like a kebab.&nbsp; Woke up with one on my pillow after much beer one night.

				I dissolve mine in water for work, use bottled though. Coffee with meth in it is called &#039;truckers coffee&#039;.<br /><br />Its one of those drugs you can do pretty much do in any way possible.<br /><br />Meth is a great alternative to adderall, cheaper and more bang for your buck. In fact if you stick to oral use you probably don&#039;t even have to worry about developing a habit unless you&#039;ve got an extreme addictive personality. <br /><br />Ingested meth lasts a good 8+ hours for people not tolerant to it.<br /><br />Just remember once you try meth your probably not going to want to use adderall anymore unless you can&#039;t get more meth. I said the same thing, I just want to try it, next day I&#039;m like yeah think I&#039;ll switch to meth for a while, lol.

Lol<br /><br /><br />Yea I only put it in water so I can vary my dose, otherwise I would always end up taking too much because I was afraid I wouldn&#039;t take enough, lol. Best way if your trying to replace adderall would be to (providing you know your tolerance/limit) just take a small shard or two and put it inside an emptied gel capsule or wrap in a piece of tissue and parachute. <br /><br />If you do use water you gotta let it dissolve a bit, the shards will sink to the bottom and dissolve away over a minute or two.<br /><br />First time I ever tasted meth I thought it was going to be tasteless, I was unpleasantly surprised.

				I measure out my chosen mg dose and do exactly what Lucky7 suggested; pop it in an empty gel capsule and swallow it with water (or whatever). I find it kicks in after about 10 minutes. Lasts me all day. I used the tip of my finger to pick up a tiny shard that fell out when I was measuring and licked it off rather than put it back into the pile. It tasted like I imagine toilet cleaner would taste. Sour, bitter, and very, very strong. I had to drink something highly flavored to get the taste out of my mouth. Unpleasant to say the least.

				I did it this week.&nbsp; Just a very small amount, which I dissolved in water.&nbsp; Tastes like shit, but not as bad as those nootropics like piracetam.&nbsp; While I got a lot of work done, I did not experience euphoria.&nbsp; Granted, I&#039;m old and since I don&#039;t consider my self a serious drug-user, and this was a big step up for me, I took little girly amount.&nbsp; Parenthetically, I do so because I get addicted to everything I do - not just drugs.&nbsp; Needless to say, I stated awake for 48 hours even after taking 6 mg of Xanax.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I suppose I&#039;m glad it was not mind-blowing because I&#039;ve spent a shitload of money on dental work, ha-ha.&nbsp; Nice justification, eh.&nbsp; I suppose it&#039;s time to show some self-restraint (yea, right) and cut back on taking so much adderall.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyhow, thanks for the advice.

				I&#039;ve never experienced a &quot;chemical burn&quot; when drinking it, but it is incredibly bitter. For this reason I use apple juice, which masks but does not eliminate the bitterness.<br /><br />It is very, very soluble in water so if dosing that way only a small amount of liquid is needed, which makes absorption fast. Like, 80mg will disappear in half a shot glass of apple juice or water. Take it on an empty stomach to improve absorption speed.<br /><br />Someone mentioned coffee. Meth + coffee is &quot;biker coffee,&quot; breakfast for the Hell&#039;s Angels back in the day. They probably drank it black but with a little milk &amp; sugar the meth taste is better masked than with apple juice.<br /><br />An acidic GI state accelerates elimination of meth. So, to help you get clean if you expect a UA, drink a quart of OJ a day or so before, HOWEVER this does not clean your system, it only helps eliminate the meth. Acidic foods in general will speed elimination. And this works no matter how you take it: if meth is in your system, it doesn&#039;t matter how it got there, it is all removed the same way (metabolism + elimination).

				It is raising the pH of urine that increases excretion of amphetamines<br /><br />Also on a related note, and to get the most out of your adderall, lowering (edit, raising) the pH of the stomach with antacids increases the absorption of amp by increasing the bio-availability to make sure you get the most out of the dose. I dont think it is probably necessary with meth, since people are already staying up 48 hrs :P <br /><br />Just dont abuse the antacids and use them too regularly or this may lead to gastrointestinal disorders I believe. <br /><br />Edit: Im stoned and dont even use stimulants... raise, lower whatever... tums was the point. When I said lower the pH I meant reduce the acidity, so raise the pH, sorry for my lack of clarity (F104, Id appreciate a little more respect, or I can treat you the same way: who has to use wikipedia to know the pH scale? english is my problem not ignorance. However, do not insult me for a simple mixed up word when you go and quote wikipedia which isnt even completely correct, because technically the pH extends beyond that into the negatives... so dont go spreading that bilge. It didnt make my entire statement worthless as you said, the point is still pertinent)

You need to invest in some Valium (diazepam) to protect your dopamine receptors form the toxic effects of amphetamines. However, if you are going to use a small dose everyday like a ADHD prescription style this is not am option because Benzo&#039;s addiction has deadly withdrawal symptoms. Stop working in a few months and the withdrawal symptoms will start even though... bla bla bla they are not an option for long term use. Even tough miss-informed MD&#039;s proscribe them long term.
