				okay guise, i can be of use here because i have tried 5-meo-mipt!&nbsp; ;D<br />and a riotous defect reported on 4-ho-mipt, which is miprocin (i got somma dat too XD)<br /><br />i would say 5-meo-mipt is a very social, friendly tryptamine. the visual effects for me were barely there. very vague tints of colors over my vision, some patterning but the experience was more about the euphoria/sensations it provided than it was about it being a &quot;trip&quot;<br /><br />ive heard it described as a tryptamine roll and i can totally see where they were coming from with that. <br /><br />i put about 10 mgs of moxy in a giggle stick full of medical marijuana and a tenth of dmt, and i must say that was UNCOMFORTABLE. it was the most stoned ive been from psychedelics that i can ever remember. when i came down i felt quite at peace but it was a hell of a ride when it was there for sure!

Duration of effects seven hours. It&#039;s sometimes called the MDMA of the tryptamines because of the emotional opening, increased tactile sensations and erotic feelings it causes. Despite these similarities with MDMA it feels vastly different (at least for me). It gives you a happy, sometimes giggly headspace that can change to loved-up and erotic, given the situation. The body-high is extremely speedy but at the same time much more clean and nice-feeling than cathinones, amphetamines and phenethylamines.

Both are good for dancing on.<br /><br />Both are relatively &quot;gentle&quot;psychedelics, but both can spank you hard if you push the dose; 2C-B at 30mg+ and Moxy at 12mg+<br /><br />I would say that Moxy is warmer and fuller, and 2C-B is more sparkly and playful - but these are all just subtle, and very general, impressions.<br /><br />You&#039;re gonna have to take &#039;em both and compare :)<br /><br />BG<br />

Both combine very well with GHB to create excellent tantric psychedelic aphrodisiacs. Moxy is probably more stimulating than 2C-B in the final analysis. I would also say I feel that 2C-B is more grounded in natural bio-chemistry, i.e. it feels as though it exists in the natural &quot;non-human&quot; world somewhere, whereas Moxy does not feel like that to me.<br /><br />Both are relatively &quot;gentle&quot;psychedelics, but both can spank you hard if you push the dose - 2C-B at 30mg+ and Moxy at 12mg+<br /><br />I would say that Moxy is warmer and fuller, and 2C-B is more sparkly and playful - but these are all just subtle, and very general, impressions.<br /><br />You&#039;re gonna have to take &#039;em both and compare :)<br /><br />BG<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>this is exactly the kind of information i&#039;ve been looking for!! +1<br /><br />the reason i ask is because i&#039;ll be attending a 3 day festival in a few months and these are a couple of the substances i&#039;m interested in taking with me...<br /><br />i&#039;m interested particularly in the musical and tactile enhancement without all the mindfuck of classic psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin...

				Body load is minimal on Moxy depending on your dose of course.<br />I had around 14-15mg&#039;s of Moxy 2 weeks ago and body load was insane, not really heavy, but heavy, it was still very nice though and energy levels were amazing.<br />Kept me going for nearly 8hrs.<br />Had zero comedown and felt perfect the next day.<br />I&#039;ve had 8mg of Moxy around 12hrs after rolling on Molly and it was very nice and smooth.<br /><br />If i was to mix MDMA and Moxy together, i would have the Moxy, around 10-12mgs, an hour or 2 in.<br />

				hey guys great thread, never tried this yet but it&#039;s gonna happen soon&nbsp; :D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, I&#039;ve done some research in the last half hour and it turns out I was... well, not really wrong but I wasn&#039;t correct either.<br />This is the most detailed pharmacological profile of 5-MeO-MiPT I could find:<br />4.00 5-HT1A<br />3.79 5-HT7<br />3.74 5-HT1D<br />3.32 5-HT2B<br />2.98 5-HT6<br />2.85 Alpha-2A<br />2.61 5-HT1B<br />2.44 5-HT2A<br />2.29 Alpha-2C<br />2.15 Imidazoline1<br />2.13 Sigma-2<br />2.11 5-HT5A<br />1.86 Alpha-2B<br />1.75 5-HT2C<br />1.70 D3<br />1.55 5-HT1E<br />1.41 H1<br />1.29 D4<br />1.28 SERT<br /><br />Sooo, this is very interesting. Not much is known about the pharmacology of 25b except that it has a crazy affinity to 5-HT2A. It&#039;s also standing to reason that it has at least some affinity to 5-HT2C because it&#039;s an analog of 2C-B.<br /><br />You said that you needed a long break for Moxy to work again, which should not happen because 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C are a rather minor part in the pharmacology of Moxy so even if those receptors downregulated themselves because of the 25b, the effects of Moxy shouldn&#039;t be affected very much.<br /><br />So, what does this mean? The only explanation I can come up with is that 25b binds to some of the receptors that Moxy binds to, resulting in downregulation and cross-tolerance.<br /><br />Of course there is no proof for this hypothesis until 25b is tested for its affinity to other receptors.<br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions or finds any useful info on this, please post them here :)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;btw&nbsp; I dont want to come across as a dick,&nbsp; I only want to help clarify some good data,&nbsp; :D&nbsp; &nbsp;and so,&nbsp; I&nbsp; just thought I&#039;d mention that the numbers here that denote&nbsp; receptor &quot;affinity&quot;&nbsp; mean&nbsp; that closer&nbsp; the number is to 4.0&nbsp; the higher the affinity (attachment to the receptor) of the compound to that receptor<br /><br />So, on the above chart it shows that moxy has the &#039;highest affinity&#039; for&nbsp; these guys<br />4.00 5-HT1A<br />3.79 5-HT7<br />3.74 5-HT1D&nbsp; &nbsp; and so on down the chain.......which means that this compound has the &#039;highest affinity&#039; to the 5-HT1A receptor and so on <br /><br />&nbsp; the thing about these numbers is that all neurotransmitters, is that they&nbsp; are &#039;complimentary&#039; and affect each other and SO many &#039;other&#039; body functions, e.g. via&nbsp; hormone&nbsp; regulation<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As much as medical science would LOVE to be able to &quot;categorize&quot; the &#039;actions&#039; of these neurochemicals...it still has a long way to go, although one can at least get an idea of which compounds affect which &#039;neural pathways&#039;&nbsp; and so might have &#039;similar&#039; actions . . . we&#039;ve still got heaps to learn&nbsp; ???<br /><br />&nbsp; A bit like how until anandamides&nbsp; (our &#039;natural&#039; aka endogenous cannabis receptor &#039;chemicals&#039;)&nbsp; were discovered, the effects of cannabis were only being described through known biological processes,&nbsp; which was completely logical, of course, but not completely &#039;accurate&#039;&nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Currently, they are discovering &#039;new&#039; neurotransmitters and/or their effects&nbsp; regularly, and the results of some studies have only posed more questions than they&#039;ve given answers ! :)<br /><br />Great thread good read, and here&#039;s the post from on silk road referred to earlier&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A fine creation of the illustrious Dr. Alexander Shulgin, 5-MeO-MIPT (5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine) is one of the very rare Tryptamines that is both a Psychedelic (ala LSD, Mescaline, DMT) and an Entactogen (ala MDMA, 2C-B, MDE).<br /><br />Chemically, it is a small adjustment (replacing a methyl with an isopropyl group) on the more well-known 5-MeO-DMT, which is found in the venom of the toad Bufo Alvarius and in the resin of the Virola calophylla tree - both used as traditional Shamanic medicines in the Brazilian Amazon.<br /><br />This replacement of the methyl group with an isopropyl group makes this substance orally active at low doses without needing an MAOI, and also makes the experience less psychedelic and more heart-opening, tactile and pleasurable.<br /><br />Moxy is an excellent aphrodisiac and sexual enhancer. It is definitely psychedelic at higher doses, but comes on through the body, opening the lungs and creating a deep emotional and tactile fullness. It improves sexual function, increases desire and profoundly enhances mental eroticism, emotional openness and tactile sensitivity.<br /><br />While it is not the same as empathogens like MDMA, it can be used in a similar way and in similar circumstances. It requires more participation than traditional empathogens and does not “push” you into an opened state. Rather it allows choice on how to feel and act while providing a similar heart-strength. And it creates a more natural, intelligent and coherent euphoria, with a clear mind-space and good energy. Communication is easy.<br /><br />Moxy works best when it is participated with – through breathing, moving, stretching, dancing and fucking. Any form of light touch or massage will also invigorate and expand Moxy’s activity. Being gently stimulating, it combines well with relaxants such as alcohol (just a little), GHB and 2C-C.<br /><br />It is also a full Tryptamine with all the associated richness, opulence, class and depth of this family of compounds. Larger doses will definitely provide a deep psychedelic space and will readily open all kinds of doors. But it always maintains the heart and has exquisite balance, so deep states are easily handled and integrated.<br /><br />Body-load is minimal to non-existent. The experience ends clean without much of a tail, and there is no post-trip downer.<br /><br />As 5-MeO-MIPT is very potent it, requires very accurate, precise and properly calibrated scales to weigh it safely. This is why we have bulked it up 110:1 with L-Arginine (with a dash of beetroot powder to create a fetching pink colour!) and packed it in Size 1 vegetable cellulose capsules. The L-Arginine is also a vasodilator which works to balance out the mild vasoconstricting effects of nearly all psychedelics - and will allow blood to flow strongly to those organs it needs to flow to ;)<br /><br />Material identity confirmed by GC-MS and NMR (and of course, bio-assay by me personally). Minimum purity assay of 99.5% by HPLC.<br /><br /><br />Dosage and Duration:<br /><br />1-3 capsules, 4-6 hours.<br /><br />One capsule: Kiss you…<br />Two capsules: Love you…<br />Three capsules: Spank you…<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />peace love and foxy mungs beans amicos&nbsp; :)<br />

				@ Motek +1 karma to you,&nbsp; excellent post and contribution on how to use powdered bulking agents for dosing at the microgram (ug) level accurately, without having to source various liquids, containers, syringes, and a calculator. Just what the doctor ordered!<br /><br />As we posted earlier (while high) there are cross tolerance issues, allow us to expand on that earlier post:<br /><br />&nbsp;We got our Moxy on Thursday, and were in a position to use it immediately (during the day) 300ug that amount came in a baggie smaller than a regular postage stamp! <br /><br />From the 300ug we combined an eyeball dosage of what may or may not have been 20-30-40ug with a measured 2g GHB around noon Thursday, and had a great sexy time! <br /><br />Friday evening, we then used used 2400ug (two blotters) 25i NBOMe with THC bumps every whenever the hell we felt like it, and had a euphoric roll.<br /><br />Last night (Saturday) we eyeballed 20/30ug Moxy but never got any of the earlier sensations (Thursdays roll) , so either the Moxy is cross tolerant with the 25i NBOMe or Moxy is cross tolerant of re-dosing with itself within three days (more likely -as the cross tolerance should have theoretically kicked in Friday) or maybe its cross tolerant 25i to Moxy and not Moxy to 25i?<br /><br />Further research is needed, anyone please weigh in if you have info.<br /><br />We do know now that 1g of GHB does NOT get us there (We have learned that with practically every substance we use except alcohol, we need to double the regular dose to get the &#039;standard&#039; effects regular users get. This sucks because it means our chem costs effectively double and/or our stash-life halves!) *&#039;We&#039; means me, not two users*<br /><br />Last night we tried, as suggested on Blue Giraffe thread, 2g of GHB with titrated re-doses, we did &#039;feel&#039; it, as a woozy feeling, we did not get jiggy at all on this dose, so we think that we used too soon after that first dose on Thursday. <br /><br />We also re-dosed GHB 1g at 45 mins, <br />and nothing much happened,<br />&nbsp;then .60g at 40mins further in, <br />and finally 1g another 30mins in,<br />&nbsp;thereafter we decided to save what was left of the GHB cos this is just wasting it, to NO EFFECT. <br /><br />Bear in mind we&#039;re also bumping a shitload of good resiny weed, about every ten to twenty minutes, this combo should have knocked out a racehorse, but we&#039;re like &#039;Ok when is this combo of aphrodisacs gonna show us some love?&#039; <br /><br />We just got moderately (THC) high last night, the rest was wasted. <br /><br />Maybe we should set the THC bumps aside and space out the using by at least a week, to get our moneys worth out of these chems.<br /><br />BTW, were not a daily user of drugs, these are all first time chems for us except the 25i &amp; THC, and we have been totally clean until this month since last April when we used JWH, 2CB, LSD, and 25i NBOMe all in minimal (too small for us) doses. <br /><br />We know this post features a lot of other drugs, but as moxy was used with them, we thought we should share..

				I tried 6 mg of moxy a couple of weeks back, which I understand is quite a low dose.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, it was my first foray into RCs and was quite strange.&nbsp; I&#039;d describe it like kind of having the &#039;weirdness/trippyness&#039; of LSD but without any mental effects, improved appreciation of music and a generally kinda fucked up feeling.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t really get much euphoria -nothing comparable with MDMA anyways- more just a strange pleasantness (this might improve with a higher dose?).&nbsp; Visually there was some slight depth perception change and a slight movement of a shodowy pattern on the ceiling, but nothing very noticable at this dose.<br />&nbsp;;D

				Indeed it does... I think I&#039;ll just use my mg scale and aim for around 10 mg, that way if I am off by 2mg my range is only 12mg-8mg. Still enough for a decent experience i think.

				Hi all, just wondering about body weight to dosage ratio. I weigh around 185-190lbs and am planning on taking 10-12mg. My partner for the experience weighs only 115lbs though and is much less experienced with psychedelics. I was thinking of giving her around 9mg. What do people think about that dosage? Or is there more information about dosage by bodyweight?

				Tried 4/5mg of Moxy on the weekend and the comeup was pretty weird.. but when it hit me I&#039;d describe it as enjoyable. A lot of things seem to be happening which would have usually stressed me out but I just sat there laughing at the situation. Felt quiet nice, almost tingly. Very minor visuals, almost unaccountable. A friend also came over out the blue when the high was wearing off and I could hold a conversation easily with them. <br />One thing I did notice is that for the next couple of days my dreams where very weird.

Do it outside because the smell will stay in the air for a long time. It gave me a weird trippy buzz for a few minutes, with lingering after effects for a few hours (so Erowid is correct on this). It was kinda like I imagine coming up on DMT feels like.<br />Is freebasing necessary with this substance?

				I tried Moxy for the first time yesterday, I did 3mg from BlueGiraffe. Pretty intense! Took about 45 minutes to start showing signs and it got more pronounced at 1 hour mark, tons of energy, body felt light, tactile sensations were enhanced, sex/masturbation is nuts on it, really impressed me on that part! Also music is incredible on the stuff! I felt like the music was vibrating at a physical level through me, very intense! Felt like my senses were amplified and my vision was faster.<br /><br />Pretty good lil drug I must say!

				just got around to trying some of awakened350&#039;s moxy i bought a few months back<br /><br />first time trying this so i measured 10mg on my .001mg scale and mixed it with 10ml water to control my dosage at 1mg per ml roughly.<br /><br />0:00 took 4ml to start. bitter with bitter aftertaste but not awful. doesn&#039;t really wash away with more water so i ate a candy and that took care of it<br />0:30 starting to feel something. i don&#039;t feel like myself but i don&#039;t know what i&#039;m feeling yet. noticing time dilation already<br />1:00 slightly heavy body load. feeling a bit tired and slow and buzzy all over. slight happy feeling<br />1:05 redosed another 2mg redose<br />1:40 feeling more energetic and more happy. kind of feels like i&#039;m drunk. body still tingling and there&#039;s a noticeable element of sensualism<br />1:50 starting to see some open eye visuals. very slight breathing/pulsating of things. peripheral vision is very distracting<br />2:05 redosed another 2mg<br />2:30 still feeling good. really weird mix of body load but also energetic<br />3:00 cev kicking in more noticeably. visuals start as fractals but then join to form solid shapes that form scenes that are very realistic and lifelike.<br />3:30 just laying around and i feel like my body is not my body. i felt like i&#039;m a house and my brain is walking through my body and opening different rooms. kind of weird. some visuals are a bit overwhelming in that it&#039;s an image just zooming in and out of itself. not unpleasant but definitely new<br />4:30 visuals are mostly gone. still feeling body buzzing and slight tired happy sensation<br />5:00 had some food and felt some nausea<br /><br />overall it was an interesting experience. i can definitely see how the characteristics of the drugs changes in the low, medium, and higher doses to go from something very party-friendly to very psychedelic. i&#039;ll need to experiment more
