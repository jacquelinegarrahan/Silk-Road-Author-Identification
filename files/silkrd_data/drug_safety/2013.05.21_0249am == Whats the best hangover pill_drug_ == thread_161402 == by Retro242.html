				I&#039;m confused.&nbsp; Are you asking for a drug to get high or to cure your hang over.....?<br /><br />Unless you have a tolerance to oxycodone or heroin, you will feel more nauseous and get headaches if you do too much.&nbsp; If you know exactly how much to use to get the best effects then be my guest.<br /><br />I was assuming you were asking what was the best to take away the foggy headed, lethargic, groggy mood of your hang overs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another tip is drink a lot of water right before you sleep after a long night of drinking.&nbsp; Preferably coconut water or a bottle of gatorade at the least.

				oxycodone&nbsp; was just an example. yes, i was asking what would work to rid the fogginess, headaches, etc. i know a line of coke helps, but i figured there was a relaxer med or something that would be suitable for hangovers.

				There&#039;s no real drug to cure your hang over other than to really mask it by getting high.&nbsp; Which is easily bud, coke, opioids, etc.<br /><br />NAC and TUDCA can be very good for liver protection.&nbsp; But a good multivitamin, water, food, and ample rest will be the only thing to take it away.

				a lot of water, maybe some electrolytes dissolved in water are a good start. Add a good breakfast, some protein powder.<br />If it&#039;s really bad, I like to take a small dose of some opiates (codeine, tramal). That helps to relax.

				A good tip is drinking salt water (not too concentrated, like saline) instead of normal water before going to bed, or the best is taking one of those dehydration cocktails. The salt is important because when you drink a lot you&#039;re not really rehydrating because the sodium in your blood gets dissolved, which isn&#039;t so good. The best is buying those oral rehydration solutions that you get when you have some severe diarrhea.

				If you prefer pills, you can take succinic acid in pills. It will make same effect. Succinic acid as lemons and honey will help to boost this:<br /><br />[clearnet] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle<br /><br />Citric acid cycle (aka Krebs cycle) is the process that oxidizates alcohol and metabolites.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are some remedies in pharmacies that to that shit too, but I don&#039;t know American pharm market.

				Fructose is also good to take before going to bed, or whenever you feel like you&#039;re done drinking, because it makes the alcohol metabolize more quickly. A gallon of salt water-ground banana-fructose-citric acid mix could be actually pretty good to avoid a hangover, or/and to cure it the day after.

				Honestly wake up and eat as much as you can manage of a super greasy breakfast with 2 or 3 caesars. Definitely helps. That&#039;s what I always do, then smoke a joint after and you&#039;re good to go. You can skip the joint, if that&#039;s not your thing I guess.

				Most depresants even pain killers can have opposite effect on hangovers. Some people its the stomach, some its the headache and for some its as the Irish call it THE FEARS.<br />Drunk like a fish for 25 years and other than a heap more booze nothing worked except for good quality amphetamines.<br />A few times have had hangovers where i could barley talk with my daughter at breakfast and the mailman has delivered, one small spot smoked on foil and instant and total cure but then high for the next 2 days and needing to smoke pot and drink hard liquor to steady the ship.<br />No matter what you hear, read or are told by experts, Booze is far and away more damaging at every level of health than the hardest of drugs.<br />If you can train yourself to enjoy social intercourse without booze you get at least a 20% and up appreciation of life.<br />I now only drink on one of special occasions, ie Kids weddings, births and parents 80th birthdays. Even then i take a little speed and dont drink like a beast.<br />If you find that hangover pill you are going to be remembered as doing more for the human race than Jesus but you will have supported the people whe profit so heavily from booze sales, taxes etc 8)<br />

				Water is great for everything involving life on earth.&nbsp; Including drug abuse and hangovers!<br /><br />And I second the coconut water recommendations.<br /><br />I wonder if all alcohol hangovers are created equal.&nbsp; For example it strikes me that some people have the consistent headache symptom, some don&#039;t.&nbsp; Some have gut symptom, some don&#039;t.&nbsp; Etc.<br /><br />I have found that opioids can improve an alcohol hangover, but can also put your head over an edge of a toilet bowl if you don&#039;t dose right.<br /><br />I was recently surprised at how effective alprazolam was for a standard mild hangover.&nbsp; Not to fall back asleep, but to actually get through the day and feel better.<br /><br />Personally cannabis does nothing positive for me if I am hungover.&nbsp; Same with greasy food which some people crave.<br /><br />Everyone&#039;s mileage is going to vary on this one.<br />

Greasy food will poison your system and give a hard time to your liver and pancreas. If you are hangover you are not able to process greasy food. So it is just more poison.<br /><br />If you want to get better you have to detoxicate your body, not intoxicate.

				i can vouch for the saline drip - the BEST cure. i go out with some nurses occasionally and go to work with them the next morning - 5 minutes on a drip and you are peachy :)<br /><br />otherwise it&#039;s a couple of pints of water before hitting the sack, a line of coke and a couple more pints of water when i wake up and a fry up/maccy d&#039;s brekkie. not a &#039;cure&#039; as has already been said, but stops you feeling like a peanut in a piece of poo

				Don&#039;t use more drugs unless your an addict which is favourable reason to binge. Food and liquids and research and activity. I say research because some more knowledge added to what you already know makes you feel good about your day. You were productive. All adds up then equates to a healthy state of mind. <br /><br />But if you can&#039;t be arsed to do it the RIGHT way then the other option is the wrong way.

				&nbsp;The only drug I use to help cure a hangover is weed.&nbsp; Pretty much any other drug will just mask my symptoms, postpone my hangover, and make it worse.&nbsp; Weed masks all my symptoms, relaxes me, and helps me do what is most important get over a hangover - EAT AND DRINK.&nbsp; This is my typical &quot;morning after&quot; routine.<br /><br />1. Smoke 1 or 2 bowls immediately after waking up to cure nausea and give me an appetite.<br />2. Eat peanut butter toast and a glass of orange juice. (You can obviously eat something different.&nbsp; I just like that because it&#039;s super easy and gives me a nice amount of energy.)<br />3. Down as much water as possible.<br /><br />Following those steps, I can typically go from feeling like complete shit to functional within an hour.<br /><br />(This morning I was extremely hungover, and I realized I forgot to post an important step.)<br />4. Take a long hot shower.&nbsp; This is a lot like going to the sauna, like b0lixtrader mentioned in a previous post, but more convenient.&nbsp; It will help relax you, and also gets rid of that annoying, grungy feeling that comes with hangovers.<br />

				I love that some people here actually do an IV saline drip for a hangover cure.&nbsp; Rock and roll!<br /><br />I forgot to add that one of the most common recommendations that does help is orgasm.&nbsp; Ideally with someone else, but solo works if needed&nbsp; ;).&nbsp; It helps kickstart the neurochemical recovery.<br /><br />I also like the previous recommendation of doing something productive with your day.

				If you live in an apartment complex that has a sauna or have a sauna near you, go to it after drinking a lot of water.&nbsp; Take a cool wash then head in to the hot room and not the steam room.&nbsp; Sweat it out for 15-30 min depending on how much you can take. Wash off and go in again for another 15-30 min.&nbsp; Obviously you should take a good time to cool off in between.&nbsp; <br /><br />This helps immensely obviously because you sweat like a dirty bastard but feels amazing after.

				I read you&#039;re supposed to drink two glasses of water per 1 alcoholic drink, but fuck that noise.<br /><br />I don&#039;t get bad hangovers, but when I do get a hangover it&#039;s usually because I didn&#039;t get a good night of sleep.<br /><br />Weed worked magic for me though.<br /><br />I would just try to drink a lot of water before you go to sleep, and take two advil or whatever you like. <br /><br />Have you tried different drinks? What kind of drinking habits do you have? Are you mixing all kinds of shit? Are you just sticking to a single type of alcohol all night?

				I am surprised nobody has mentioned Hovenia Dulcis aka Oriental Rasin Tree, active ingredient dihydromyricetin.<br /><br />The Chinese have been using it as a hangover remedy for 500 years, finally the west is hearing about it more recently. <br /><br />It also sobers you up if you take some when drunk. And it&#039;s quite good for the liver.<br /><br />For a hangover, take your dose before bed with some water.

				1+ on the protein powder comment above. One thing that causes headaches besides dehydration is a lack of amino acids. Protein powders have the full RD for all the amino acids your body needs. Meat, protein, in general is a good idea, but different meats and protein sources have different amounts of various amino acids, so if you go with the powder, you&#039;ll be sure to get everything you need. <br /><br />I believe the only meat that has 100% of the amino acids you need is human flesh.... so unless you&#039;re a werewolf&nbsp; or did too much PCP and thought you were one...&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />

				This is what I do and it works very well for me:<br /><br />Before bed:<br />- Standard dose of soluble Alka-Seltzer (the one with aspirin) in a pint of water<br />- Sleeping tablet (I use a tablet with active drug diphenhydramine hydrochloride in it which is OTC in my country)<br /><br />Next morning:<br />- Standard dose of soluble Alka-Seltzer (the one with aspirin) in a pint of water<br />- Nothing with caffeine in it, esp. black coffee (sits heavy in stomach, causes dizzyness and annoying mild shakiness)<br />- Foods easy on the stomach and bland. For me: potato chips, soup, toast.<br />- Drinking pints and pints of cold water makes me feel worse, I sip caffeine free tea all day (camomile for example, naturally calming)<br /><br />Weed, vitamins, fruit, never did anything for me in a hurry.

				Excuse me if someone mentioned this already: a Bloody Mary is an old-fashioned hangover remedy.&nbsp; A little bit of alcohol -- meaning, ONE drink -- will cure a hangover, providing you can stomach it.&nbsp; The Bloody Mary is supposed to be the best choice, as the horseradish in it will dilate your blood vessels, improving blood flow, which helps your body process the alcohol and get it out of your system faster.
