				This is a guy who has never taken it before, I told him what it was and that they were 1mg each (Righteous Tabs) but he insisted on taking 3 after me stressing for him not to. I tell him to take only one tab and the dumbfuck thinks he&#039;s god and takes three!?!?! WTF! Will 3mgs kill someone that has never taken it before? He claims to have a lot of experience with LSD, DMT etc.. But I told him that even though he has that experience it doesn&#039;t mean shit. Any advice?

				I took 7 25c tabs once, I tripped really hard, and kept saying incoherent things. The world turned a crazy grey scale checkerboard eventually after convincing my friend that we should go longboarding (I have no clue why he actually let me) I had some of the best boarding of my life, Did fall and hit my head once, but I was ok. So in all I would say it was positive experience, but I did get kicked out of the party I was at. I don&#039;t plan on doing such a dose ever again, and don&#039;t recommend it to anyone. <br />High doses of LSD are much much more pleasant.

				Yeah, he&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />It&#039;s gonna be one hell of a trip if he doesn&#039;t have any psychedelic tolerance though. He may want to drink lots water and take some cold showers throughout the trip.<br /><br />I think even if one is super experienced with typical psychedelics (LSD, shrooms....) 3 tabs of 25i with 0 tolerance packs a very strong and different type of punch.

				My friend regularly takes 2-3 mg of 25i at a time. It&#039;s generally pretty mindfucky for him, as a pretty strong trip would be, but he&#039;s been developing a mild long term tolerance to it. He also handles himself pretty well with psychedelics (though he has a tragic flaw: he&#039;ll be in public places while tripping and say shit like &quot;EVERYONE CAN TELL I&#039;M ON DRUGS!&quot;). I personally could never see myself taking that much, because 1 mg is already generally pretty strong for me. If he really is experienced with LSD and, most importantly, taking higher doses of it, 3 mg of 25i probably won&#039;t be too overwhelming for him. I&#039;ve never tried LSD but I hear that one of these ~1 mg 25i tabs creates an experience much more intense than an &quot;average dose&quot; LSD tab, so that should be considered.

				I dunno, I love LSD. 150mcg is perfect. There are some being sold with 160mcg tabs. That&#039;s just the perfect dose IMHO.<br /><br />Add some valium after the peak and returning to realty is so calm and peaceful.

				Holy shit, Jack. LOL.<br /><br />Anyway yeah, psychedelics scare the shit out of me... I had a really bad DMT experience and I don&#039;t want to have another bad one again. I stay low on the LSD because I&#039;m worried that I&#039;ll see spiders crawling all over me or something. I&#039;ve never taken more than one hit of acid, and I&#039;ve never done any of the 2Cs, just LSD and DMT. Not even shrooms. I&#039;m just terrified of it. I can&#039;t think of a good time of day to do it or exactly what to do in my situation. I already have anxiety issues, so doing them freaks me out. I love 160mcg of LSD because it&#039;s just not too much, I still have my sanity. I&#039;m worried that if I take more I might lose touch and if something goes wrong I won&#039;t think &quot;Hey, I have seroquel or valium if necessary and this is going to end in a few hours if anything&quot; and I&#039;ll do something... bad. <br /><br />I have a lot of fears, like of bugs and other things.... also, when I&#039;m tripping, I usually see skulls when blinking or staring at something too long. It happens more when I don&#039;t have REALLY happy music on too. I think it might be because I do it during the night every time? I&#039;m not sure.... I like it, I just wish I wasn&#039;t so scared.

One of those drugs that are awesome wherever you are. It just makes everything super great.<br /><br />It is perfect in a group of friends either at home or out doing something fun like hiking or a nice warm day at the beach. Or running through the rain!!!!!! <br /><br />You can try it at home on your own, it&#039;s pretty fucking fantastic, but if you can find someone to come over and join you, all the better... Watch some cartons, jam out to some music and just dribble shit all night. It knocks down social barriers like a motherfucker, and even with your best friends, it can lower inhibitions and barriers that would otherwise stop you from saying things you want to say, but too worried about sounding gay or retarded.<br /><br />I kiss all my male friends when I&#039;m on MDMA, and I&#039;m straighter than a monkey&#039;s dick. It&#039;s a fabulous drug.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let your parents see you on MDMA, they will be weirded out by your excessive affection and nostalgic talk. :P Been there, done that. It gets weird when you come down hahaaha

Crazy bitch.<br /><br />And yes, a lot of us are alike on here. We&#039;re all criminals, but the great majority of us aren&#039;t violent... we&#039;re just people who enjoy drugs.

It is as if we are the counterculture of the 2010&#039;s. Sure, the counterculture of the 60s was huge with all of the LSD, but this is worldwide, in front of the law, illegal in their eyes, and right in their faces. Yet they can&#039;t do anything. It&#039;s definitely a huge movement, and we are soldiers against this ridiculous War on Drugs.<br /><br />I consider those of us whom are non-violent, as I&#039;m sure there are some of us who ARE violent (it&#039;s a given in a market such as this), as very good people fighting for a terrific cause. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172757.msg1250931#msg1250931">Quote from: Jack N Hoff on June 18, 2013, 09:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172757.msg1250516#msg1250516">Quote from: Baggie on June 18, 2013, 06:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172757.msg1249679#msg1249679">Quote from: iLoveTaffy on June 18, 2013, 11:51 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172757.msg1249536#msg1249536">Quote from: gwendlesphere on June 18, 2013, 09:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172757.msg1248481#msg1248481">Quote from: iLoveTaffy on June 18, 2013, 02:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m not a clubbing type of person. I prefer to stay inside, but I also like to experiment with drugs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m so much like this. <br /><br />MDMA is... One of those drugs that are awesome wherever you are. It just makes everything super great.<br /><br />It is perfect in a group of friends either at home or out doing something fun like hiking or a nice warm day at the beach. Or running through the rain!!!!!! <br /><br />You can try it at home on your own, it&#039;s pretty fucking fantastic, but if you can find someone to come over and join you, all the better... Watch some cartons, jam out to some music and just dribble shit all night. It knocks down social barriers like a motherfucker, and even with your best friends, it can lower inhibitions and barriers that would otherwise stop you from saying things you want to say, but too worried about sounding gay or retarded.<br /><br />I kiss all my male friends when I&#039;m on MDMA, and I&#039;m straighter than a monkey&#039;s dick. It&#039;s a fabulous drug.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let your parents see you on MDMA, they will be weirded out by your excessive affection and nostalgic talk. :P Been there, done that. It gets weird when you come down hahaaha<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, none of my friends know about my drug use. I USED to have a girlfriend with whom I would&#039;ve shared this MDMA with, but she turned out to be fucking insane, so NOPE.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got two pills and I&#039;ll take them by myself, home alone, and listen to some music, haha. <br /><br /><br />Thnks. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It amazes me how much we are all alike in some aspects. I had a girl who turned out to be insane too :( Sorry to here the same happened to you Taffy :/ I hope all is well with you dude<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think we&#039;ve all had the insane girl/woman before.&nbsp; Actually, I think all women might be a little insane. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I concur Jack hahaha Women are (for the most part) fucking psycho ::) But I&#039;m almost positive they would be able to say the same about us men, as psycho as they are lmao.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Psycho. As. Hell. It&#039;s because women want the &quot;bad&quot; guy (and we are technically &quot;bad&quot; guys, we just have to keep it under wraps!!), and they are usually jackasses; thus psycho. The girls who call the good guys psycho are likely just psycho themselves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Taffy!(: Dude we really are right in front of their faces aren&#039;t we! Ahhh Man doesn&#039;t it feel so great to be a part of the greatest anti war on drugs movement in history! ;D I would prefer our people be non violent as it only makes our &quot;Counterculture&quot; look bad but I will agree that violence is something which can be very helpful in certain instances. Viva la Revolution as the Addicts would Say!!! Oh and Murder the Government as NOFX would say!!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				I&#039;m perfectly happy being non-violent... I&#039;m totally, 100%, completely against violence. And we all ARE part of the greatest anti-drug war movement in history. <br /><br />We&#039;re doing a good thing here. If we get in trouble, so be it. Some of us inevitably will, sadly. But we&#039;ll win. I know we will, in the end. We have to. They cannot beat us.

				So be it indeed dude! hahahaha You&#039;re absolutely correct bro, They cannot ever bring us down. Even if they managed to take down the road it wouldn&#039;t stop us. I am so Glad that The Dread Pirate Roberts created this!! Sometimes I do feel like a nut though hahahahaha But hey, We all know we are in the right. I&#039;m a salesperson of happiness but I don&#039;t sell that happiness to kids :D We have Morals, We know when is when and There are so much more of us than &quot;Them&quot;. We are global hahahaha, I think that&#039;s the second most amazing thing about SR. I&#039;m thinking every government would really have to crack down on mail (domestic and international) to slow us down. But by the Time the U.S.A does that I&#039;m pretty sure that the majority of the citizens will revolt and we will have another civil war. But if it takes a civil war to get rid of all these patriotic lies then fuck yea dude, Bring it on ;D
