				What are the differences?<br /><br />Which holds it&#039;s potency longer?<br /><br />Which is more difficult to store/ are there different storage methods required?<br /><br />Generally what are the pros/cons of each?

				Being both lsd Its just down to preference, as long as you store them in a dark cold place they will retain the potency.<br /><br />You can have more lsd in the microdot than a blotter but I have not seen many around in a long while, the ones on the road now are around 130ug<br /><br />I just seen some dali lama blotters that have 210ug so its really just a novelty at this point.

				Being someone quite knowledgeable about LSD, In my opinion I prefer blotters, They are easier to store, and as you probably know microdots can be strange after certain periods of time. <br />They can still be kept for quite sometime, But *in my opinion* not as long as blotters. All stored in the right condition.<br /><br />As someone else said, Microdots used to be able to hold a lot more LSD, But nowadays I have not seen any microdots over 150ug. <br />I have the dalai lamas in stock now and they are lab tested at 200-210 ug. They are very nice for the price, and some of the best acid I have seen/tried from the road and off it. <br /><br />Feel free to message me :)<br />SW

				I love microdots and I actually prefer them to blotters. A friend of mine has this little tic tac container full of red, blue, yellow, and green little dots and it just feels more unique and fun taking a little candy shapped drug rather than a piece of paper.

				I am always worried about drugs that look like candy, I think kids will get into them.
