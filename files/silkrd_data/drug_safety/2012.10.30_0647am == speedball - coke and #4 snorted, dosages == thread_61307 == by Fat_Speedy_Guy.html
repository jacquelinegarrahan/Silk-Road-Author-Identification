				Hey,<br /><br />Reasonably accustomed to coke, but tolerance of the H is pretty damn low as I&#039;ve managed to avoid it until now, but temptation finally got the best of me so I got some nice quality coke and some of FM&#039;s #4 on the way.<br /><br />I was thinking 100mg line of coke (tolerance is reasonable), 30mg of H #4 spaced a couple of minutes apart, both insufflated.<br /><br />New to speedballing though, understand it can be risky but will end up giving it a shot anyhow. Just any advice on dosages would be appreciated.

				I&#039;d start smaller on both ends. <br /><br />When you combine drugs, you can get a much stronger reaction than you anticipated. Only way to be sure is to start off small.<br /><br />So start off small to get a feel for it, and work your way up to where you want to be.

				my friend and i worked it out for iv to roughly be half your normal dose of each (iv doses are way less than insuff doses also). for insuffation i would probally go about the same. don&#039;t do a lot of heroin since your body isn&#039;t used to it and it can fuck your shit up. i&#039;d say start at around 1/3 your normal dose of coke and like 1/4 of your normal dose of heroin (if you don&#039;t test the purity the day before hand i would say do a very very tiny bump to see how it gets you feeling).<br /><br />&nbsp;i still wouldn&#039;t go over say 3/4 of your normal dose of coke and don&#039;t go crazy with the h. obv insuffated speedball isn&#039;t in the same ballpark as IV speedballing but combiing an upper and downer can still not be good news.<br /><br />

(dosages are approximations since i have no idea what your tolerance is to either).<br /><br />post is kinda ranty but i think the point is put across
