				Now I might be making it, or what to know more about something I&#039;m buying, but either way, I&#039;d like to know how to measure purity. This is mainly for meth, but could work for just about any solid, non-water soluble drug. I thought of a technique, but I&#039;m not sure how I&#039;d go through with some of the things....<br /><br />Now the technique I was thinking was something like this: measure the weight on a scale, and then measure the volume in a graduated cylinder of water(I). Then, after I&#039;ve formed that ratio, I need to find the ideal volume of however much meth I have(II). Then, I just cross check these(III)<br /><br />Now here are the issues I&#039;ve run into:<br />I: Is crystal meth water soluble? If so, is there a liquid thatd be safe that it wouldnt be water soluble in?<br /><br />II: Any idea how I&#039;d go about finding the equation for number of moles/mass to volume? <br /><br />III: When comparing the ideal weight to volume ratio and the real weight to volume ratio, would this not even give me an idea of the purity? As in, would some impurities be heavier than the meth, while other&#039;s were lighter, thus cancelling each other out? <br /><br />

				Also, I&#039;d like to be able to measure the purity without having to have knowledge of the synthesis process

				Yes, meth is very soluble in water.&nbsp; It&#039;s insoluble in acetone, but the acetone you&#039;re going to be buying has enough H2O in it to suck out some of your meth along with the acetone. You can use baked epsom salts to draw some of the H2O out beforehand, but it&#039;ll still have some.&nbsp; Google it if you want to pursue this, it&#039;s trivial really.<br /><br />... I don&#039;t think your idea would work.&nbsp; Chemistry is not my thing though, so I can&#039;t really tell you why.&nbsp; For one thing though, in the real world and not the ideal situations that are so useful for learning, things are really messy.&nbsp; Like really, really messy.&nbsp; There&#039;s probably a dozen different things in random amounts that will always change from one order to the next, so you can&#039;t really count on that.&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t see how you&#039;re going to measure with the kind of accuracy you&#039;d need to make this feasible.<br /><br />I&#039;m always open to being told I&#039;m just plain fucking wrong though, so speak up if somebody knows I am.
