				Narcotic Potentiation Techniques<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Antihistamines and anticholinergics<br />First generation antihistamines and other drugs with anticholinergic properties have long been known to potentiate narcotics, many prescription medications utilize this combo including most of the opiate based cough syrups and a few pills.<br />&nbsp;<br />Drugs in this category which may potentiate narcotics include the following (there are more)<br />Diphenhydramine and dimenhydrinate<br />Scopolamine and other tropane alkaloids (not including cocaine)<br />Meclizine<br />Hydroxyzine<br />Promethazine<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors<br />Most narcotics are metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6. Drugs that inhibit these enzymes may drastically potentiate the effects of opiates by blocking these drugs from being rapidly broken down and eliminated.<br />Drugs in this category include but are not limited to:<br />&nbsp;<br />strong:<br />SSRIs<br />fluoxetine[8][9]<br />paroxetine[8][9]<br />bupropion[8] (non-SSRI antidepressant)<br />quinidine[8][9] (class I antiarrhythmic agent)<br />cinacalcet[8] (calcimimetic)<br />ritonavir[9] (antiretroviral)<br />Moderate<br />sertraline[8] (SSRI)<br />duloxetine[8] (SNRI)<br />terbinafine[8] (antifungal)<br />weak:<br />buprenorphine[13] (in opioid addiction)<br />amiodarone[8] (antiarrhythmic)<br />cimetidine[8] (H2-receptor antagonist)<br />unspecified potency:<br />antipsychotics<br />haloperidol[14][8]<br />perphenazine[8][14]<br />thioridazine[14]<br />zuclopenthixol[14]<br />risperidone[14]<br />chlorpromazine[8]<br />bicalutamide[15]<br />hyperforin (St. Johns Wort)[16]<br />antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists)<br />Promethazine[17]<br />chlorphenamine[8]<br />diphenhydramine[8]<br />hydroxyzine[8]<br />tripelennamine[8]<br />some SSRI antidepressants<br />citalopram[8]<br />escitalopram[8]<br />clemastine[8] (antihistamine and anticholinergic)<br />celecoxib[8] (NSAID)<br />clomipramine[8] (tricyclic antidepressant)<br />cocaine[8] (stimulant)<br />doxorubicin[8] (chemotherapeutic)<br />metoclopramide[8] (antiemetic, prokinetic)<br />methadone[8] (analgesic and anti-addictive)<br />moclobemide[8] (antidepressant)<br />ranitidine[8] (H2-receptor antagonist)<br />doxepin[8] (tricyclic antidepressant, anxiolytic)<br />halofantrine[8] (in malaria)<br />levomepromazine[8] (antipsychotic)<br />mibefradil[8] (calcium channel blocker)<br />midodrine[8] (Î±1 agonist)<br />ticlopidine[8] (antiplatelet)<br />Quinine (tonic water) and grapefruit juice may also be used for this purpose.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Clonidine<br />Clonidine is an alpha-2-noradrenergic agonist, and has been used for a good while to potentiate narcotics. Clonidine generally increases the sedation of opiates quite dramatically; however,&nbsp; its effects on the painkilling ability of narcotics are not well understood.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Trazadone and Cyclobenzaprine<br />Cyclobenzaprine adds to both the sedative and painkilling properties of narcotics. This is a tricyclic antidepressant which has mild to moderate muscle relaxing properties, antidepressant, and anticholinergic effects. Trazadone has similar effects to cyclobenzaprine but without as much muscle relaxation.<br />&nbsp;<br />5. Dextromethorphan<br />Therapeutic doses of DXM have been said to potentiate the effects of narcotics.<br />&nbsp;<br />6. Loperamide (Immodium): This drug is related to meperidine/pethidine (Demerol) but does not cross the blood-brain barrier in sufficient quantities to cause euphoria. However, the consumption of doses of 150-300% of the therapeutic dose when mixed with high doses of codeine or meprobamate have been reported to produce a weak Darvon-like buzz aside from the effects of the other drugs.

				The interaction between tropanes and opioids was used also in sorcery, in witchcraft times.<br /><br />The (in)famous &quot;witches salve&quot; was composed just by belladonna alkaloids + poppy pods. Now in a salve the most toxic elements of tropanes don&#039;t get absorbed by the skin, but scopolamine yes, and this tied with the effect of the opioids caused a much more vivid &quot;opioid dreaming&quot; state, with the added &quot;reality&quot; caused by tropanes.<br /><br />Still the ointment is risky; a too higher dose can cause permanent brain damage or even death, so caution is to be used.

				What about grapefruit juice and citric acid as opioid potentiators? I know it&#039;s not as strong as using other drugs to potentiate, but I feel like they do work somewhat.

				I&#039;m not so sure about SSRI&#039;s being strong potentiators, I&#039;ve been on Fluoxetine and Seroxat whilst I was addicted to heroin, and never experienced any potentiation, certainly not noticable, even when I have started a course of SSRI&#039;s or when stopping taking them. It might seem theoretically possible on paper, but in real life I would have to say NO, and I have tried Diphenhydramine, which did work, but not in a particularly pleasant way!

				I never found too much of a difference using potentiation techniques for opiates. The main thing that will increase your high is getting better dope or more pills really

				^^ It would depend on the SSRI and whether or not it inhibits P450 enzymes, GFjuice is a P-450 inhibitor I believe. I did not list them all, I just found a list of P-450 inhibitors so take that for what its worth. Tropanes will work like DPH by acting as an anticholinergic. If using datura seeds only 5 or so seeds are necessary, not enough to cause delerium.
