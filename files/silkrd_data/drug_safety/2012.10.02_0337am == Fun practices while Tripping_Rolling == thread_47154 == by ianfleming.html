				Ok, so I wanted to start a thread about fun suggestions on things to do while tripping or rolling.<br />Please suggest ideas, activities, or practices and if possible provide the drug that you do this with, or think it would go well with.<br /><br />Here are some of mine so far.<br /><br />-Wait till night or dusk and turn off ALL lights in the house. Throw some cool colored glowsticks in the shower (I suggest 2 of the large ones as putting 8 or so small ones might make it easier to slip and bust your ass). Take a cool (or warm shower). If your with someone try caressing them. Watch out for your tempreture if you are using hotwater. This is especially fun to do after taking a long walk or hike and working up a sweat. I find that the ideal drug for this is 2c-i thought Im sure it would be fun with MDMA or probably anything trippy.<br /><br />-(Another involving water) Be CAREFULL with this one. Fill a bathtub with hot water and salt the ever-loving shit out of it. Try to only put enough water to barley allow you to float (which is much easier with all the salt). Wait for the water to get lukewarm. Then turn out all lights (or blindfold yourself). Eliminate anything that might make noise (expect maybe a trip sitter (which is suggested if your playing with water)). Now sit and float in your own personal sensory deprivation chamber. It&#039;s QUITE interesting to see where your mind will go when you remove most external stimuli. BTW having someone else to talk to you and watch over you dosent diminish the sensory deprivation effect much and I think it&#039;s worth it to not drown to death. This works GREAT with 2c-E<br /><br />-Lastly, when rolling try getting a vicks inhaler (the ones with L-meth in them). These are fun alone but are increased 10 fold when you have someone take a hit, hold it in their mouth and slowly blow it out across your face (the eyes feel great). Also fun to kiss someone after they&#039;ve taken a hit.<br /><br /><br />Post some of yours.

				Good idea for a thread man!<br /><br />This might sound stupid but whenever im tripping i always get up real close to stuff and examine it, be it a rock a flower or whatever, everything has much more noticeable amazing detail ha ha! i have marine fish tank and its literally after taking up hundreds of hours of constant staring into in pure awe, when i take DMT every grain of sand on the top layer stats to grow a tiny green stem from it and then emits a led type brilliant blue light from the top as if its an electric flower, its unreal, all the fish have their own individul see through cloured auora around them too, i would love to record what i see sometimes, its made for sci fi!

				I tripped shrooms in the shower for the first time last week, it was one of the greatest drug experiences I&#039;ve ever had. Just make sure you have someone setup the water temperature (very confusing when you&#039;re tripping) and yell at you when its time to get out.

				I&#039;ll second that!, what i love is a nice long shower when im high rolling on MD, it feels so sensory as if all your nerves are tingling with delight. I got nothing to do today but damn its way to early to do a line!

				I love to play with my light gloves(other people like it when i do too!) and listen to music.&nbsp; When i&#039;m tripping i enjoy long nature walks and i frequently end up closely(in physical proximity as well as detail) examining my surroundings.&nbsp; Especially the ground cover in nature.<br /><br />rolling during the day is really fun and not something most do.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found everything&#039;s brighter and more intense.&nbsp; The brightness probably due to pupil dilation, but colors are incredible!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, when tripping sunsets and sunrises are EPIC! As is watching some huge cumulonimbus clouds rush up on you(though it actually takes a while, haha) or watching a lightning storm.<br /><br />I&#039;ll think of some more.

				Sounded like a great idea at the time, but my friend and I got home from the club one night after rolling and thought it&#039;d be a GREAT idea to go running around his block.<br /><br />At 4 in the morning.<br /><br />In downtown Los Angeles.<br /><br />BEST. RUN. EVER.<br /><br />Well, except for all the barking dogs and drunks flopped about.<br /><br />But the act of running was awesome!

				I call it &quot;Fresh High&quot;.<br /><br />Whenever I get my hands on quality marijuana I roll a spliff that I would normally smoke with 2 friends and smoke it all by myself. As soon as I finish smoking I go for a shower, not long, not short, not cold and not hot. Just a normal quick shower and then I head outside, the effect is great I always feel fresh even tho I&#039;m high as fuck, Your friends wouldn&#039;t even realise you&#039;re high.<br /><br />I also have a friend that is quite good at drifting (Every month I buy 2 tires for him lol) the adrenaline rush is amazing on any drug (even sober). Last time I was on cocaine and I couldn&#039;t enjoy it more. One of the positive things about me is that I don&#039;t panic no matter what. If you know you are going to be scared then don&#039;t bother because is going to be a shitty trip I&#039;ve seen people almost crying sober.<br /><br />Btw Nice topic.

				speaking of roller coasters there&#039;s this old raver trick called the roller coaster that me and my friends used to do to other people who were rolling at raves....<br /><br />what you do is stand back to back with the person and hook arms with them...<br />then the person giving the roller coaster leans forward so the other person&#039;s feet are lifted off the ground...it helps if you have an extra person hold the other persons feet so they don&#039;t swing too wildly...<br />then the person giving the roller coaster bends their knees and does a squat and sways to one side and then repeats the process swaying to the other side...<br />for added effect have someone give the person receiving the roller coaster a lightshow...

				I agree with the N20. <br /><br />Nitrous with the whip cream canister thats meant to make homemade whip cream. Put 2 NOS cartridges in and hold in each hit as long as possible. <br /><br />You will travel to a different dimension. ENjoy!

				How about snorkling on LSD? I&#039;m going to try it in California next month. If the thread is still going I&#039;ll let ya know how it goes. Probably awesome.<br />When I was in high school we used to go swimming tripping. We had this big bucket and one of us would stand on it and push the bucket to the bottom while the other guy was breathing the air inside the bucket (like a diving bell). The visuals inside the bucket were amazing. No one drowned.
