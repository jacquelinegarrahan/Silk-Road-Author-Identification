				I want to hear some experiences doing this. I don&#039;t mean &quot;mixing them together&quot; and snorting lines with both or anything, just maybe doing a few coke rails, waiting for the comedown and smoking some crystal, or vice versa... just curious to know if anyone&#039;s done this and what it&#039;s like. Thanks.

				Simple answer: it&#039;s a waste of coke.<br /><br /><br />Long answer:I&#039;ve smoked meth and bumped during the high buy snorting lines of coke. Both high quality meth and coke. I felt the rush of the coke, but it seemed to be less of a duration, and even less of a rush. It elevated my pulse greatly (which is expected.). Every time i did a bump of coke was to stretch my ice. It seemed i was just longing for the meth. So in my opinion, i just wasted my coke because i didn&#039;t feel it to the full extent and the high just had me eyeballing my ice. I wish you the best of luck with this combo and hope you have some form of downer on hand just in case. It can easily get intense. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also seen someone iv coke and meth in the same shot. She became un responsive for about ten minutes, a giant smile crept over her face, and replied. &quot;You fuck me now!&quot; It was a fun night, but for those ten minutes i was concerned for her. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;ve known her for a long time and i know she goes hard. But, i could tell it was intense for her.

				coke and meth = myocardial infarction. We had a girl in her 20&#039;s have ST elevation and died in ICU a while later. not sure the quantity and she was diagnosed in the field by dumbass medics as having a panic attack.... then we did a 12 lead and her labs confirmed it. if they had followed protocol and treated her for chest pain with nitro, O2, and morphine and sent her to a cardiac center she might have survived.

They are now in a law suit with the hospital because they didn&#039;t even administrate oxygen or put them on a heart monitor when they were complaining of extreme chest pain, and not being able to breathe. This was from a meth overdose and i doubt they would still be alive if it was poly drug use.

				yeah you have no idea how fucking pissed we get when this shit happens. and the CQI motherfucker reviewing the cases is a fuck who lets these other fucks get off with what we call murder with nothing more than a slap on the wrist. We all get jaded because 9 times out of 10 it is bullshit, but with that mentality many people die or end up with CHF and die decades earlier than they should.... alright enough ranting, off to bed.

				I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s it&#039;s impossible to mix them safely but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it at all. To make a long story short you are mixing two drug that more or less increase dopamine levels but do it totally different ways. One binds to post-synaptic dopamine receptors and sort of acts like &quot;fake dopamine&quot;, and the other stimulates the release of the dopamine you already have (it&#039;s much more complicated than this but I think it&#039;s sufficient). In a nutshell, they can be more powerful with the sum of there parts being greater than the whole. It&#039;s kind of as mixing benzos with alcohol. Then comes the myocardial infarction and the extremely unpleasant trip to the ER will,in the worst case, impede your treatment because you are a &quot;druggie&quot;. They are so used to people coming in with panic attacks and complaining and it usually often turns into nothing (not this is any excuse).

Yeah, this happens all the time. I can&#039;t stand that scare the shit out of them and they might learn their lesson mentality. If someone is complaining about chest pains and stuff you have to treat that shit seriously, worry about all the other bullshit later.

I&#039;d stick to the purely medical sites (of course using a computer unaffiliated with tor or this website or anything else that could connect you to this).<br /><br />I think people put less thought into the long term effects of drug combinations and overdosing than they should. A lot of chronic use/overuse/habitual combination leads to stuff down that line that is both serious and mild that people aren&#039;t made aware of. Chronic depression, schizoaffective disorder, COPD, CHF, artherosclerosis, liver failure/dysfunction, kidney failure/dysfunction ---&gt; dialysis and the long list of complications that com from dialysis (or any of the above conditions)... oh lets not forget hypertension (high blood pressure) chronic anxiety, etc WHICH then cause the older patient to &quot;self medicate&quot; when an incompetent or arrogant doctor cannot or will not prescribe a proper medication to treat the patient&#039;s problems and so that patient uses some substance to excess and ends up in even more trouble.<br /><br />As you can see, I&#039;m not at all pleased with the state of our health care system - but as I&#039;ve gotten off topic, I&#039;ll stop, sorry about that haha.<br /><br />Yeah tho, ANY patient with chest pain CANNOT be diagnosed in the field and so they MUST receive full chest pain protocol - sue any fucking lazy medic who does this or any ER staff who shit on you because you&#039;re a &quot;druggie&quot; or whatever the fuck. It&#039;s their job - get paid a shit load to make 100% sure&nbsp; NO SINGLE PATIENT falls through the cracks but it still fucking happens and it&#039;s up to the public to make the complaints because they&#039;ll listen to them..... another staff member MAY have some say, but it&#039;s really the public comment that gets shit looked at (and especially a letter from a law firm). SUE SUE SUE for ANY damages physical or psychological.
