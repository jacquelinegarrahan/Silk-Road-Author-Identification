				Why is&nbsp; this combination so great?&nbsp; Many celebrities and performers have died from this combination so it&#039;s not just junkies and experimenters that mix these.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to get feedback from experienced users of this combo and see how you&#039;re mixing/dosing.&nbsp; I have been doing this on and off for a little while and I can see/feel very clearly that the addiction factor is extremely high.&nbsp; Right now, I mix the coke at a 2 to 1 ratio to the #4.&nbsp; I only insufflate (snort) but I find I still have to be very careful when dosing as I may not feel overwhelmed but I will definitely be high.&nbsp; And the more you snort/shoot, the more you want to do.<br /><br />Anybody?

				No idea why it&#039;s so good but fuck yeah it rocks. Careful with the H though, the coke leaves the party early and it&#039;s easy to OD at that point when the H catches up to you. I&#039;ve nearly done that before smoking crack and doing H. The Crack wore off and I stayed up all night puking my guts up with a cracking headache feeling truly terrible too freaked to go to sleep for fear of stopping breathing/ puking in my sleep. I always hoped I&#039;d be a rock star, rather than have a rock star style death :-/<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard shooting meth and H together is a very easy train to get on too.....

				Thank you for your reply, Remediless.&nbsp; That is very good advice about the H.&nbsp; I wonder if it&#039;s been studied as to what actually kills the O.D. victim.&nbsp; Coke or H or the combination?&nbsp; Seriously, from a medical standpoint, do you think they can be that definitive with the analysis?&nbsp; All I know is that I love it and can see rehab in the future if I don&#039;t watch it.<br /><br />What I found interesting is the fact that I really do not like either of this mix alone.&nbsp; Not saying I wouldn&#039;t do it if it&#039;s all I had but I&#039;d rather save the one for when I get the other.&nbsp; It&#039;s sooooo satisfying.

				Yeah, I love this combo. I am very careful when mixing the two though. Say I do a fat line of coke...I&#039;ll only take half or less of heroin or whatever opiate I&#039;m using than normal. So say I take 30mg of heroin or 20mg of oxycodone normally, I&#039;ll only take 15mg heroin/10mg oxy. I typically redose on the cocaine a lot more than the opiate too for whatever reason.<br />I&#039;d rather not accidentally overdose. If I&#039;m going to overdose and die, I want it to be intentional...and awesome. Just sayin&#039;<br />I&#039;m also a snorter so I feel like it&#039;s a bit easier to control the dose than IV. I feel like I&#039;ve heard way more stories about overdose with this combination in IV users than snorting...but it&#039;s still dangerous. Too much of the opiate is what causes death typically. The stimulant causes your heart rate to rise and then when it wears off your heart rate falls dramatically because of the opiate and when it goes too low (or you nod out) your heart will stop/you&#039;ll stop breathing and never wake up :/ <br />Stay safe friends (and high!)

				The speedball effect is so great because you feel the best of both different types of drugs in harmony.<br /><br />The euphoric stimulant of coke that may have a slight tweakiness/speedy feeling is neutralized by the heroin a euphoric downer.&nbsp; They balance each other out in the best way so you feel the best of the both.<br /><br />But since heroin lasts much longer, you need to be careful to not dose the dope too high over the coke.&nbsp; Remember a heroin high will last more than few hours while a line of coke or two will only last 40min-1 hours.

				Thanks for the input saintgabe and bOlix.&nbsp; You both make very good points.&nbsp; The best description of the high for me is &#039;Normal&#039;.&nbsp; I truly feel that the state of mind and overall body high should be our constant state, not just a recreational vacation.&nbsp; I know this is selfish and possibly self-destructive but the high/low that this combo brings can take me places I&#039;ve never been.&nbsp; Okay, I might have been there before but that&#039;s not the point.&nbsp; It&#039;s just so goooooooooooooood.

				Thanks for the advice bOlox.&nbsp; Sometimes I don&#039;t have an &#039;off&#039; switch and I distinctly remember (even though it was many years ago) most of my school report cards saying &quot;lacks self control&quot;.&nbsp; If I go from this combo it wouldn&#039;t be too bad though.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather do that than fade away...

				Just becarefull with Alcohol. A lot of people died for that combination. For example Janis Joplin dead this combination.<br />So alcohol and heroine should be a no go.

				Also remember speedballing is not always just heroin and cocaine.&nbsp; Although that is the real deal &quot;classic&quot; speedball.<br /><br />Speedball can be any type of upper and a downer at the same time.<br />&nbsp;<br />Examples: Redbull and vodka/ jager bombs<br /><br />speed(any amphetamines) with any opiates or benzos<br /><br />I like to substitute heroin or oxycodone with a benzo like xanax, klonopin or valium.&nbsp; It&#039;s great as it takes away almost all edginess and anxiety and lets me cruise just on euphoria.&nbsp; Also great on comedowns.&nbsp; It&#039;s a win win situation.

When you have a high tolerance, there seems to be a greater difference between a fatal shot, and a recreational shot.
