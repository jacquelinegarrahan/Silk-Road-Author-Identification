				The only illicit drugs I&#039;ve done are LSD, MDMA, amphetamine, and marijuana.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t like marijuana (I think it makes me less intelligent, even if only temporarily), and due to the neurotoxicity of MDMA, and the quick tolerance build up of LSD, I can&#039;t do these drugs every day of the week - otherwise I would.&nbsp; I need a drug, preferably a psychedelic or a stimulant, that I can safely do at least once every day.<br /><br />What illicit drugs do you feel safe and comfortable with consuming every day of the week? What illicit drugs have no serious adverse long-term physical side effects?

				I&#039;m not really sure anything is safe to do everyday if you want no long term side effects. Marijuana is probably one of the safest drugs there is. Some amphetamines can be relatively safe in moderation, but they do cause cardiac stress. <br /><br />&quot;To go beyond the bounds of moderation is to outrage humanity. The greatness of the human soul is shown by knowing how to keep within proper bounds. So far from greatness consisting in going beyond its limits, it really consists in keeping within it.&quot;

				Well, I would say it depends on what exactly you are trying to achieve, and what you consider &#039;safe&#039;.<br /><br />I once experimented with low doses of 2c-e over an eight month period with very good results... There is almost no tolerance effect that I noticed, even with consecutive low doses over one-week periods. But still, this is a research chemical and as with most RCs there is little actually known in terms of processes or long-term effects. Use at your own risk, etc.<br /><br />But &quot;feel safe and comfortable with consuming every day of the week&quot;: Pretty much narrows it down to weed and chocolate for me.

				we have to split this question.<br /><br />1. what drug can I do every day without&nbsp; dieing or serious harm.<br /><br />&nbsp;... there should be some but I dont care.<br /><br />2. Can I get high the whole time 24/7 just full of joy and greatness?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;... well here is the problem. and a simple answer. NO! Your brain does not work like that.

				Honestly?

				I&#039;ve taken Tramadol almost every day for the past three years. Mostly just one 50mg pill, but occasionally I will take two or three. It doesn&#039;t really get you all that high (at least not any more for me, unless I take a few), but it will take away a hangover quickly, which is basically why I take it.

				Opi is totally right here, and take benzos off your list too. I decided a few years ago to detox from Ativan and Zoloft, both of which I had been taking daily (prescribed) for over 6 years. While opiate withdrawal truly does suck (from what I&#039;ve read...I&#039;ve never been truly physically addicted), they only last about a week. SSRI and benzo withdrawals last MONTHS, and even now a few years later I still feel the &quot;brain zaps&quot; sometimes. My serotonin levels are likely permanently fucked up. Long story short, don&#039;t get a tramadol habit. It will be an incredible bitch to withdraw from.

LSD, for instance, is physiologically non-toxic. The problem is that you build up tolerance to it so quickly that it won&#039;t have any noticeable effect if you do it every day, unless you constantly increase the dosage. But it can safely be done. (Caffeine and alcohol can also be safely taken every day, depending on dosage, but I am talking specifically about illicit drugs.)

Tramadol is a weird drug in that it affects people in different ways. For some people it does nothing, for others it&#039;s a nice buzz and for some it makes them sick. I don&#039;t know how long it would take to start withdrawing, but I have been without them for at least 7 days without feeling that bad. I mean, obviously I wanted more, but I wouldn&#039;t have described the feeling as anything like an opiate withdraw. Maybe I don&#039;t take enough (50mg a day for the most part)? Or maybe I just haven&#039;t been without them long enough? I don&#039;t know, but since they aren&#039;t very expensive at all, I&#039;m not super worried. I&#039;m more worried about the damage I am doing to my liver, since I take them to get rid of the hangover I have almost everyday from drinking too much the night before. And it works like a fucking charm every damn time.

				withdrawals start after about 4 days of constant heroin use..<br /><br />I would imagine if you start taking them for more than a week you will start feeling withdrawal(wd) effects, when you wd you basically feel like you have a bad cold, constant runny nose, your stomachs all fucked up I mean REALLY REALLY REALLY badly, you sweat and shiver and your not cold or your cold and you can&#039;t stop sweating. There&#039;s also the EXTREME leg pains, I mean I start punching my legs just hoping it will hurt less from the wds. Oh I forgot if your a IV user you will be vomiting for who knows how long... Luckily I have never had that withdrawal symptom as I have never IV&#039;d heroin. <br /><br />this goes on for a bout 5 days.. 1st day is ok 2nd is bareable, 3rd day it starts to get better then 4th day you are in fucking hell you will do just about anyting to get another dose to get away from withdrawals day 5 you start to smell things again, the world looks like a better place, then the dark forsaken hell hole that you had spent the last couple days in...<br /><br />

				Weed/hash is likely the safest.<br />After a few months of constant ingestion your tolerance changes, and you don&#039;t get those &quot;stupid&quot; highs, you just feel tweaked.&nbsp; I love hash, just for the reason that it energizes me and I can function while doing literally anything.<br />The only down side is expense and lack of the ability to get truly ripped.<br />I smoked this way for 14 years before I found this road and swallowed some fresh LSD.<br />I realized that my expensive smoking has been holding me back, and that I need to take care of my business for the sake of my kids and wife.&nbsp; I was smoking around $200 worth of product a week.&nbsp; Before last year, that was about half my monthly earnings.<br /><br />LSD could be taken every day... but the tolerance factor sets in so quickly the expense would quickly climb higher than the cost of most drugs.&nbsp; Basically double the cost/dose every day.

				DMT is the active component in ayahuasca which does not develop a tolerance, no physical dependence and has been used by some tribes in the amazon rain forest daily for generations. I wouldn&#039;t suggest it because the tribes entire daily routine revolves around the consumption of the sacred brew but meh... it&#039;s all about your own perspective on individual happiness right?

				If you browse through the experience reports of Erowid you will find a ton of reports of bladder damage from Ketamine.<br /><br />Here is a list of substances I would not expect to damage my health if used daily for a few months.<br /><br />DMT<br />Salvia<br />Coca Leaves<br />Nitrous (a couple hits per day). Take b-vitamins if used excessively or longer term.<br />Cannabis<br />LSD (not that it would work)<br />Psilocin (not that it would work)<br />Kratom (if a light dose is used once per day. Not &quot;illicit&quot; in many places though)<br /><br /><br />

				I smoked cannabis for about a year daily and I noticed that it impaired my memory by a noticeable amount. After a while I stopped getting the munchies too and it became difficult to eat if I didn&#039;t smoke that day. You also lose out on some REM sleep. Cannabis is mostly harmless but daily use of ANY drug will lead to some problems eventually. Regarding LSD, if you trip everyday you&#039;re likely to lose out on a LOT of sleep and eventually develop severe HPPD.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you can take any drug daily without it altering your brain chemistry in one way or another. If you feel like you can&#039;t cope with day to day life without being high every day then maybe you should be getting professional help.

				There is no substance that you can take every day and avoid harm to your system. <br /><br />You can drink water and eat meat and vegetables every day, that&#039;s about it. Everything else has to be moderated. <br /><br />Weed every day will most certainly impair your cognitive abilities in the long-term. It&#039;s safer and more rewarding to indulge in a controlled fashion rather than becoming a chronic user. <br /><br />We all have a beautiful, natural base-line that you can enjoy without using drugs.

LSD, for instance, is physiologically non-toxic. The problem is that you build up tolerance to it so quickly that it won&#039;t have any noticeable effect if you do it every day, unless you constantly increase the dosage. But it can safely be done. (Caffeine and alcohol can also be safely taken every day, depending on dosage, but I am talking specifically about illicit drugs.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is a difference between physiologically safe and psychologically safe.

				Ketamine was used recreationally for decades, by some very heavy users at that, before any reports of bladder damage started to surface. It is far more likely that a by product of clandestine ketamine synthesis causes bladder damage, than ketamine actually causing it.
