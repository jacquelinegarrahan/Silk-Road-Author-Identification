				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to the crazy night rave party and i&#039;m planning my menu... :) And would like to know what do u think about redose 2C-B...? I have quite big experience with psychedelics, but with 2C-B it&#039;s gonna be my only third time... First time it was 20, second 22-25mg... Want to have some good time with my best friends, amazing music etc... Hope that ur knowledge will help me as always with choosing best solution&nbsp; !:) +1 for everyone who helps me ! :) Much love,<br /><br />acidsoldier<br />

				in my experience redosing any kind of psychedelic (after the effect of the first one is in action) will result in a weak effect. Tolerance builds up fast. <br />i have no specific info about 2c-b.&nbsp; Redosing might just result in a speedy effect. <br />But try it! Its gonna be fun!

				I generally agree with what valakki said.<br /><br />However, I bought a gram of 2c-b a few months back and I literally had to get rid of the shit because it was to easy to redose and the tolerance build up was to small.&nbsp; I was starting to feel like a junkie.

				Never tried 2ci but I&#039;m pretty familiar with 2cb and a fair few psychedelics.<br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much of a tolerance after one week but I have read that it can take up to two weeks for tolerance to come completely down. FYI I have heard that 2cb is better as MDMA wears off so you/he may want to google the combo to find the perfect timing. Personally i have done 2cb one weekend after another and sometimes you get where you want to be and others times it seems a little to light even at the same dose (but then this seems to happen with me and 2cb anyway even with weeks in-between uses... maybe i need slightly more accurate scales...). All to do with set and setting I suppose.<br /><br />He may have a little diminished effect but the MDMA will probably make it negligible anyway

				valakki is dead wrong. and i do not mean that in a mean way.<br /><br />it most certainty does not make u more speedier.<br /><br />again, what i previously wrote holds true. i am well experienced with this drug and many of my friends with exact dosages and success (8-10 people)<br /><br /><br />and yes,&nbsp; mdma followed by 2cb approx 2 hours after ingesting molly is THE best chemical love duel ever.<br /><br />the. end

				no need to apologize bro!<br /><br />i most certaintly see where you can derive that educated guess..seeing it being a speedier result.&nbsp; molly can be like that, especially if snorted with no prior oral ROA.<br /><br />with 2cb it most def has a visual re-up.&nbsp; and speediness really isnt that pronounced.&nbsp; eg- i once snorted 20mg and a girlfriend of mine carlessly snorted 15mg and went off on a part of the table that had an additional 10mg after a 10-15mg oral intake 4hours prior...thus snorting 25mg..possibly more...we are talking about a very small girl here<br /><br />she was reaallly re-tripping hard and i made her lie down and do breathing patterns and made us fall asleep in 30minutes.....wake up an hour later and have a greeaaattt visual multicolored kaliedoscope ever changing blow out.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I would drop 15mg and then another 15mg as I was peaking to both extend the dose, increase the effects, and ease the come up.&nbsp; Or sometimes I&#039;d drop 5mg and then 15 or 20 after that with another 5 or 10mg booster dose later that night to extend the duration.<br /><br />Then I&#039;d do it all over again the next day.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn&#039;t find it to be a very enjoyable chemical and it would leave me with a bad headache on the comedown (and sometimes into the next day) not to mention terrible nausea on the come up.&nbsp; I know a lot of people love 2c-b but it didn&#039;t agree with me.&nbsp; Most of the time I dosed out of pure boredom :/<br /><br />2c-e on the other hand...&nbsp; fucking amazing.
