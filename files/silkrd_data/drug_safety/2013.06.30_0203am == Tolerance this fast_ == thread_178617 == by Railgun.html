				I&#039;ve been a somewhat heavy pot user for about a month, but took about a week or so off to tend to other shit.<br /><br />I got a vape, and some sour D.&nbsp; It was good, but I don&#039;t think I got too high.<br /><br />The next day, I tried some edibles, and got super baked. It was the highest I&#039;d been in my life, and at one point, uncomfortably so.&nbsp; I came down, ate the rest of the edibles.<br /><br />The next day, when I try to vape, I get such dimished effects. The high lasts perhaps 45 minutes and takes significantly longer to reach.&nbsp; At this point, I&#039;m not vaping because it&#039;s almost like a waste of weed.<br /><br />Anyway, is it possible for tolerance to build up that high after 3-4 days of heavy use of vape/edibles?<br />Thx

				well normally the tolerence does\nt last long.. take a wqeek off and see how the vape goes.. but seeming you tried edibles and got so high you might find that thats your new high. Thats what happened to me so i used edibles all the time, exclusivley even.. smoking was just &quot;ice on the cak&quot; and not the cake itself - the edibles were.<br /><br />when you get stuck into your comfortable d9ose of edibles you will probobly find all smoking is not going to get you as high

I&#039;m used to it being intense, but I double dipped so I was high all last weekend essentially.<br /><br />Jut not used to vaping being this dull. A full vape bowl gets me for like 45 mins to an hour tops.&nbsp; Never had anything that weak.&nbsp; I guess tolerance can come in quickly from high doses.

				Yes, its possible for tolerance to build that fast. The edibles are the culprit. Just give yourself a break for a couple of days and you&#039;ll be back to normal
