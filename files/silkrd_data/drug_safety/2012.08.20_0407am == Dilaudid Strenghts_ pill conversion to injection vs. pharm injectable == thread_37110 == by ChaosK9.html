				Hello-<br />I have a question regarding the strengths of converting lets say 2mg of a Dilaudid tablet to an injectable vs. what you would get in the hospital, normally 1mg of Dilaudid injection.<br /><br />Not getting the expected rush of the equal strength from a vial. <br /><br />The process of conversion is as follows:<br />The tablet is crushed into a fine powder and mixed with Bacteriostatic water, loaded into a syringe and pushed through a 5 micron filter.&nbsp; The result is roughly half the strength of what one would expect out of a pharmaceutical vial of the same stuff.&nbsp; The filter isnt too strong is it?&nbsp; The 5 micron filter came from a hospital where they use it to draw up fental or other injectables from glass vials.&nbsp;

				Heating pills will cause the binders to coagulate. Bigger particles = more damage and higher chance of a capillary getting blocked. Strokes are no bueno. However, if you have a micron filter, this might not be a problem. There was a chart on how much safer it is to shoot pills after using a wheel filter and the difference was amazing. Like 80-90% less particles compared to using a piece of cotton or a cigarette filter. Plus looking at all the particles in a magnified pic that would be circulating through your vascular system (forever?) was very off off-putting and I don&#039;t even shoot! I hear dilaudids are relatively easy to break down compared to like the new oxycontin pills and opanas. Keep in mind that most if not all opiates (salts) are very water soluble. So chances are you&#039;re just dissolving non-drug material into your solution... I&#039;d suggest going to one of those specialized opiate forums. Those junkies spend (give?) their life trying to find the best rush and are usually on the up and up on the subject of defeating the anti-abuse mechanisms of pills. Good luck and be careful!

				Im guessing heating the water could help with the dilution of the narcotic thru the water.&nbsp; Everything I have read states that Dilaudid is as highly soluble in water as hydrocodone or oxycodone..so I should be getting all of it dissolved into my solution.&nbsp; I will also try a 22 micron filter and see if that makes any difference.<br /><br />Anyone else have any thoughts or direct experience with this?<br />

				Don&#039;t believe me?...I was cooking Dilaudid before your parents ever met and sold them for YEARS. Maybe I just forgot how to get high.... but, I doubt it<br /><br />

				There is merit to the difference in generic and brand product when you are attempting to dissolve the tablets for injection. <br /><br />While the active substance in brand and generic medicine is exactly the same (and so is the effect when taken orally as intended), the fillers used can vary wildly between generic versions of a drug. This could, for example, cause the brand product to be quite soluble in saline while the generic is not, leaving particles that clog the filter and bind some of the active substance to that even if most of the liquid appears to pass though the filter. <br /><br />Obviously dissolving tablets to make injectable solutions is generally advised against, but if you decide to do so, make sure the solution is completely clear (as water) before attempting any filtration. Particles too small to be seen (bacteria, but also inorganic) may still remain, but if the solution is cloudy/milky to the slightest degree microfiltration to remove bacteria will certainly fail.
