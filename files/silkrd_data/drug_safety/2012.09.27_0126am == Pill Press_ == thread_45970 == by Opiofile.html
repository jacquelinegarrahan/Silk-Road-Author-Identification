				Does anyone know if people have access to a pill press? My buddy is looking to throw down with me on one to split costs. Can you get a good one for around 6500$? <br />Possible to get on clearnet or would I have to find a vendor somewhere over here? I remember looking a long time ago on clearnet with not so much luck.<br /><br />Any info is much appreciated.

				Ebay for &lt;$1000 out of china.<br /><br />They will even make custom die&#039;s with your own logo.<br /><br />You can get just about anything on E-bay from radioactive material to DNA sequencers and Gene Splicers.<br /><br />I am waiting for some weed grower to figure out that with a DNA sequencer, a gene splicer, and a couple of other pieces of equipment they can isolate the gene that produces THC and splice it into a tobacco plant, corn plant, or even green beans. Once that happens, well lets just say the government has no chance of stopping all plants from growing.<br /><br />What ever happened to ABC (Australian Bastard Cannabis)??? Some plant in Australia that supposedly crossed with weed and was producing THC.<br />

				Didn&#039;t know about that on ebay, i&#039;ll have to check that out.&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />Ya those are sweet. They did not have those 7 years ago when I first started shopping around. Pretty awesome you can get a crappy one for like $650.<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably get a tdp 1.5 or a tdp 5 if I have enough. You can press unusual shapes with a 5 ton. 1 or 1 1/2 isn&#039;t enough tonage to do anything but round I think.

				Like all things prices range from how good your press is. Automated ones are dear yeah but you can get them cheap like James says.

				Just a friendly reminder to be careful where you buy your tools. Whether it&#039;s precursor, lab equipment, pill presses, etc. you must be cautious, especially on sites like eBay. Your name is on your PayPal account, and making any purchase leaves a paper trail. Also, who&#039;s to say that the vendor isn&#039;t being paid (or required) to report all sales to the govt.? You don&#039;t want your name on some &quot;Pill Press&quot; list in some database, especially if you get caught one day.
