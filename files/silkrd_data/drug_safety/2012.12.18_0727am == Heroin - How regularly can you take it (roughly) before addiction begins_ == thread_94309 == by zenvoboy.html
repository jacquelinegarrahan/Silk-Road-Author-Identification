				I know this is a pretty flimsy question, with everybody reacting differently to drugs etc.<br /><br />But I was wondering, how regularly do you think you would have to take Heroin for a genuine physical addiction to start setting in?<br /><br />If you had only one single session taking a &quot;moderate&quot; amount per year, I imagine you wouldn&#039;t feel addicted.<br />But if you took a &quot;moderate&quot; amount every single day, I imagine you probably would become addicted (with bad withdrawal symptoms and huge cravings if you were to stop taking it).<br /><br />So whereabouts do you think the threshold is for this? What do you think is the most often (and in what dosage) you could expect to take Heroin without feeling addicted?<br /><br />Probably a stupid question I know... but still, any input would be good.

				As few as one or two times using H, your body will begin to crave it, then short after need it.

				Addiction risk of heroine is well known... (read above post).<br /><br />It also depends on your personality and off course I can&#039;t read your mind. But I have one experience... you can NEVER thrust yourself on the statement &quot;I will only do it once&quot;.<br /><br />

				if you use on weekends you won&#039;t get physically addicted. physical addiction won&#039;t occur if you use for less than 3 days. however if you go over that you will get mild flu like symptoms but nothing major

				To put a definitive range on it, I&#039;d guess that you would have to use it everyday for 3 to 6 days depending on the variables that apply to your own body to develop a physical addiction(i.e. withdrawal sympt. when you stop). Psychologically, it can start sooner...<br /><br />If you are the strong willed type, and wanted to use it as much as possible w/o getting physically hooked, you could do it 2-3 days in a row, break for 4 days(at least) and start again, which is essentially, this...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94309.msg666763#msg666763">Quote from: grdr on December 18, 2012, 08:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if you use on weekends you won&#039;t get physically addicted.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And also, as a person with a 6 year relationship with opiates, I wholeheartedly second this...<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94309.msg666740#msg666740">Quote from: Eternal Sunshine on December 18, 2012, 07:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you can NEVER thrust yourself on the statement &quot;I will only do it once&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Just be careful, and take every step possible to prevent yourself from getting mentally/physically addicted if you go down this road.<br />
