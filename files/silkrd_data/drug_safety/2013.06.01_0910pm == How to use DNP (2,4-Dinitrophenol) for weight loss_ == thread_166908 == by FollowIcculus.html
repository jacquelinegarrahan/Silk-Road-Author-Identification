				I would personally advise not to, just stay away from it. If you really need to take it i would start with a very low dose 80-100mg for a few days and see how your body reacts. You will be sweating like a pig, having to change your clothes twice or more a day and your sheets every night. It makes you very lethargic, you will not be able to goto work on it, please remember at higher doses this shit literally cooks you inside out.

				Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; Maybe I should stick to good old fashion adderall and diet and exercise.&nbsp; Are you speaking from first hand knowledge or you have just done some research on it.&nbsp; I would like to hear from someone with some first hand experience.&nbsp; I would also be willing to take other advice and/or supplements for weight loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any suggestions or knowledge is appreciated.

				Id advise against it as well.&nbsp; I tried it once I&#039;ve a decade ago. Fully informed, fully prepared. Talk about an absolute and complete living hell that week was before I aborted. This stuff just is not worth the suffering it brings and is far too dangerous for anyone imo. Its an extreme you can&#039;t even fathom until its too late and you can&#039;t do a thing to hide the profuse sweat dripping down your forehead 24/7 orv the several days after you quit.<br /><br />It also dyes your jizz bright yellow. Not fun.
