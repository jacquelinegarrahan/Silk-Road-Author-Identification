				I got some LSD for the first time, will try it when i have a couple of days off from work in a couple of weeks. My question, since this is my first time taking LSD, does anything speak against having a couple of beers before and during the trip? I&#039;m not talking about excessive amounts of alcohol, basically just enough so there is no anxiety, like 2-3 bottles before, then a couple of bottles over the course of 12 hours or how long the trip will take, without being seriously drunk. I have had the best experiences with stimulant type drugs (amphetamine, mdma, meth) when i&#039;ve had some drinks before, because basically you still feel the stimulation and hi, but without the anxiety and edginess you may feel on stimulants otherwise, especially if you accidentally take a too large dose. I imagine the same way with LSD, if you feel nice and relaxed after 2 or 3 bottles of beer, you&#039;ll also rather have a nice and relaxed trip. I bought 5 blotters 150 Âµg, plan on taking 2 or 3 at once for the trip, since i don&#039;t have so many occasions where i have a couple of days to myself to try this, so i want the real experience the first time. Is that dosage ok?<br /><br />Trip settings, I plan to book a hotel room where nobody should disturb me, watch some movies and listen to music on my laptop during the trip. Any recommendations for a movie or tv series to watch while tripping?

				A few beers will be just fine my friend, just a few to ease into it comfortably will be just what you need. Same goes for the dosage, 2 tabs would be perfect since you have 5, that way you&#039;ll have 3 for next time and it will be equally fun. ;) I wouldn&#039;t really enjoy being stuck in a hotel the entire time, so I would bring a bike to just cruise around on outside for at least the peak, but that&#039;s just me. :D Some good movies to watch would be your favorite Pixar films if you have any, other than that Wes Anderson&#039;s film are brilliant on acid. Hope you have fun with whatever you decide on, and be sure to bring some really good earphones. :)

				I would rather get a weak benzo like valium. Just pop one 10mg valium right before you take a tab. Then if the trip is too overwhelming take another valium or two. Be warned though taking too much benzo will really kill the trip.

I have however only done it in situations where I could not drink any alcohol, like when I was hi with other people around me who aren&#039;t into drugs, you basically still feel speedy and euphoric, but the edge is taken off, like you aren&#039;t shifting your feet and body around all the time. Right now, after a three week drug break I&#039;m on amphetamine (about 100 mg oral so far) and I took a diazepam before I started (about 3 hours ago) to combat any anxiety that might turn unpleasant. Works fine so well: Euphoria, stimulation, hardly any anxiety.<br /><br />In the case of MDMA benzos seem to really kill an MDMA-hi, which I would describe as pretty much the best drug experience one can have, while MDMA with moderate amounts of alcohol works very well for me, and you aren&#039;t clear-headed while hi on MDMA anyway, so the alcohol doesn&#039;t steal much from the experience. Just pure MDMA without alcohol or benzos doesn&#039;t work for me, because if I take it in larger amounts (like 300-400 mg) to get a really great hi, I start to panic if i haven&#039;t taken any sedatives like alcohol to calm me down. Smaller amounts of MDMA (I&#039;ve tried dosages of 50 or 100 mg) which I can take without any other medication to calm me down basically just give me a pleasant tingling sensation and mood lift, but nothing like the total euphoria and magic and sunshine you have with higher doses, which can really be described as pure ecstasy.<br /><br />The advantage of benzos is of course, that while you might become drowsy, you are clear-headed, not inebriated like with alcohol, so if you want to use LSD to think about some deeper personal issues you are still clear of mind to think about them, even while the anxiolytic properties of benzos make weird and unusual experiences you may have during such a trip less scary. I don&#039;t mind just watching some movies and listening to music during my LSD trip, so I don&#039;t think alcohol will destroy it for me. And what I really, really DON&#039;T want is a panic attack and horror trip in my vacation from reality. Just a fun departure from reality and a new, interesting and entertaining experience like you can&#039;t have in real life without any drugs.

				I&#039;ve had three failed LSD trips so far. I would not think booze will be detrimental but I would personally stay away from it.<br /><br />I keep Xanax with me just in case. Chewing the pill to speed it up working is best but I won&#039;t take it with the LSD as suggested earlier.<br /><br />Benzos do work really quickly so there&#039;s no need to &quot;dampen&quot; the trip initially. I think maybe the tabs I got wasn&#039;t as strong as advertised.<br /><br />Lately, I received 3x150ug. I took 1 and felt nothing, I then took two the next time and felt something but not really anything noteworthy.

				From my personal experience, I wouldn&#039;t recommend combining alcohol and LSD. <br />Granted, the worst-case-scenario is that you get too drunk/buzzed and the LSD makes you nauseous, leading to vomiting in most cases. Following this period of vomiting, you may start to have an even more intense trip and increased level of intoxication due to dehydration from vomiting. Which can really increase your anxiety. <br /><br />If anything, I&#039;d recommend taking Midazolam if the trip begins to become too intense. It&#039;s a quick acting benzodiazepine that has a very short half-life compared to most other drugs in the same class. <br /><br />I hope this helps,<br />sdesu

				personally, i&#039;ll never mix alcohol and psychedelics again... did it once and it was very unpleasant. i suggest smoking weed and meditating. both should help with anxiety. just remember to accept whatever lucy shows you, even if it&#039;s negative. resistance will only lead to worse vibes. complete acceptance of everything you experience will keep you in the light.

				In my experience, psychedelics and Alcohol is never the best combination.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking back to the time I threw up on mushrooms, but that&#039;s besides the point.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be a pussy, you&#039;ll be fine.

				I personally would keep some benzos.I prefer LSD to shrooms or MOST other psychedelics because its so clear and its not cloudy and alcohol makes everything cloudy and hazy for me without acid.For me personally I always have clean,clear headed,rational trips on LSD and I think for me that alcohol would just mess that up.

				From personal experience, I find that people can drink way harder after dropping L.&nbsp; You become Bender essentially.&nbsp; I used to do it all the time, but I have stopped drinking.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t bad.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t good.&nbsp; If you like to drink, you may as well.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t over do it first time.
