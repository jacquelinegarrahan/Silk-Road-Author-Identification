				Hey guys, I recently acquired some MDA from 3Jane and I was wondering if anyone knew a good dose for it? I saw on Erowid to take 1.4mg/kg. I weigh around 70kg so that&#039;s not even 100mg, yet I see people in BlueLight saying to take 160mg+ for your first dose. I have dozens of experiences with MDMA, Amphetamines and Coke so MDA wont be entirely new to me. <br /><br />I have been extremely sensitive to MDMA in the past though, 100-120mg is usually a good dose for me. Ive done 150mg before and I couldn&#039;t move, speak or think clearly for several hours, it was the one time I actually did not enjoy MDMA at all. I never thought 150mg would be overdoing it considering I have heard of people doing half Gs and being fine (The MDMA was from Symbiosis). So im not sure if that sensitivity would apply towards MDA too.<br /><br />Im going to a music festival this weekend so whats a good dose for it?

				I&#039;d start with 80-100mg. But that&#039;s just me.

				Maybe 250mg.&nbsp; MDA is great.&nbsp; I hit my face on some tile on a gram of it.&nbsp; I was walking and rolling so hard and just kind of blacked out.&nbsp; I would close my eyes and watch the fish swim around inside my head. :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why you had a problem on 150mg of MDMA. :-\&nbsp; That&#039;s why I suggested what I consider a lower dose of MDA.<br /><br />Erowid has incorrect dosages or subjective dosages to say the least.&nbsp; The trip reports are even worse.&nbsp; Too many fabricated trip reports.

				No clue, honestly one of the most fucked up times Ive had in my life on M. I sat on the edge of a bed with my face in my palms for 2 hours not able to move, it was Symbios&#039;s too so I&#039;m sure it was pure. I&#039;m definitely just sensitive to it.<br /><br />I might try 150 and see what that&#039;s like, then add another 100 after an hour or so of tripping. Hearing that you did a full gram makes me a little more comfortable with it now. But Ive also heard that 3Jane has an incredible product which may have been slightly purer then what you had at the time (no clue though).

				You say you&#039;ve been sensitive to MDMA in the past, so I wouldn&#039;t go ANY larger than 120mg for your first dose. MDA kicks MDMA&#039;s ass in terms of power. I had a friend eat some of 3jane&#039;s mda last weekend and he was out of his mind off around 100mg

				Oh and on that note. I have zero tolerance right now as I took a break from MDMA a while ago. My brain is weird anyways, I never get comedowns from MDMA and I can do it on a weekly basis and get the same effects from the same dose.

				A few months ago now, it was pure white. Looked and smelled like it should (I dont bother with reagent tests). I knew it was MDMA though. Absolutely no doubt. I had given some of the batch to a few friends and even tried it myself in lower doses before.<br /><br />I was doing 100mg perfectly fine the first two times I tried it and fucking loved it. I was having people tell me it was the best they had ever had. When I did the 150, I literally felt the smile drop off my face. I had a completely neutral expression the entire time, showing no emotion at all as well as not knowing whether to feel happy or concerned. That was actually the last time I did MDMA... it freaked me out so bad I took a fairly long break as a result. Never had that happen before, I could have just been getting shit MDMA all my life until now and gotten the really pure stuff (which is most likely what happened).
