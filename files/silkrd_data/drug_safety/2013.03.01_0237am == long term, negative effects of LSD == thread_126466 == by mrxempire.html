				Are there any proven long term negative effects of LSD? I&#039;ve heard from some sources that taking a lot of acid throughout your life can lead to a permanantly &quot;spaced out&quot; state. I would assume that you would need to pull a Syd Barrett and eat a shitload of L for this to happen though. There was a rumor going around my area back when I was in high school about a kid that was being chased by the cops with a large vial of acid in his pocket. While he was running, he tripped and fell, and the vial broke and all of the acid soaked into his leg. He is now in a mental institution because he thinks he is a glass of orange juice. Noone can approach him because if you do, he cries &quot;DONT TIP ME DONT TIP ME!&quot; I was very skeptical of this rumor, even back when i was a kid, despite claims that some of my friends &quot;knew the kids brother&quot;. Obviously this can never happen to you. I am aware that if you have a diagnosed mental disorder, abusing LSD can worsen your condition permanantly. I&#039;m no retard, although some of my earlier posts may imply otherwise. I&#039;m just worried about &quot;frying my brain&quot; if thats possible. I love my LSD but I wouldn&#039;t say I abuse it in any way. The most frequently I did it was two summers ago, i tripped once a week from june until august. Minor doses as well. I have just gotten concerned because now that I have discovered the glory of Silk Road, I can have LSD available to me whenever I have the money, and i frequently find myself with extra money to throw around. Advice would be appreciated

				Use of psychedelics can give you HPPD,<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: wikipedia</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a disorder characterized by a continual presence of sensory disturbances, most commonly visual, that are reminiscent of those generated by the use of hallucinogenic substances. Previous use of hallucinogens by the person is necessary, but not sufficient, for diagnosis of HPPD. For an individual to be diagnosed with HPPD, the symptoms cannot be due to another medical condition. HPPD is distinct from flashbacks by reason of its relative permanence; while flashbacks are transient, HPPD is persistent. HPPD is a DSM-IV diagnosis with diagnostic code 292.89.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If one gets symptoms one should avoid use of hallucinogens and the HPPD should subside :)

				Strangely enough, over a decade ago, i too was told that BS OJ guy story, only i heard it that he was so convinced that he was a cup of OJ that when some one pushed him over, he actually died. LMFAO such nonsense, its amazing how far the smell of bullshit will travel! <br /><br />As far as im concerned, LSD has no long term effects, unless you had serious mental or personality disorders deep in your lineage, that was brought to the surface by the use of LSD, which i have heard many cases of. <br /><br />EDIT; i have eaten more LSD in that past 12 years than most people have in three times as long. Im sharp as a tack friend 8)<br /><br />EDIT; copied and pasted from wiki. Man permanently thinks he is a glass of orange juice (or becomes an orange)<br />&nbsp;<br />Another common legend, again dating back to the 1960s, was that a man who took LSD went insane and permanently thought that he was a glass of orange juice. Because of this, he could never bend over, slept upright and did not make any sudden movements. Alternative versions sometimes have the man thinking he is a glass of milk or a whole orange. Another version of this myth states that the man believed he had become an orange, and was afraid he would be &#039;peeled&#039; by his friends. This particular tale is now considered to be unfounded...[<br />

				The main danger with LSD, and all other psychedelic drugs, is that it can reveal things about yourself that you may not have been prepared to know. it really gets to the heart of your identity. the danger here is not so much psychological as existential and spiritual. for many people the revelation is beautiful, but it may be not be good for people who have a weak sense of identity. i can see the LSD revelation having a negative impact on a minority of individuals, although it is hard to say whether it would be long-term or not. the negative impact would be from the experience, not the drug itself.

				There have been a few studies about the long term effects of heavy LSD use. Heavy LSD generally being defined as some total life time number of trips, usually a few hundred. The available results show that LSD does cause some changes in your brain, but they are give and take. Heavy users have brain wave profiles more consistent with a relaxed and anxiety free state. They have quicker visual response reaction times. They have a near complete lack of certain tactile perceptual illusions that are very common in most people. They also can differentiate between slight color variations better than average. There are several other positive long term effects as well, however I cannot recall all of them. They also are shown to have a somewhat decreased cognitive capacity for organizational tasks versus control groups. There are a few other negatives as well. <br /><br />In my personal experience, as a heavy LSD user, I would say that I have not really noticed any negative effects from LSD use, despite having tripped several hundred times over several years. As far as negative physical effects, they are essentially non-existent. There is of course the risk of HPPD, but it isn&#039;t horrible in most cases anyway and almost always fades away after you stop using. Of course there is also the risk of triggering a latent psychological disorder such as schizophrenia, however LSD will just lower the age of onset it wont cause it to happen if you were not already predisposed to it. <br /><br />Pretty much LSD is one of the safest drugs to take and with the least negative long term effects of essentially all other recreational drugs. Some may be about on par with it, but I cannot think of a safer recreational drug than LSD. The noted cognitive changes are give and take between positive and negative, and in most all cases are mild, and only in the heaviest of users (several hundred total trips in a lifetime).

This is all exactly right in terms of the documented scientific studies that I know of.<br /><br />I can add a few comments from the collected lore of the psychedelic community over several decades, beyond the more authoritative scientific literature. <br /><br />The advice I always got when I was younger was to leave at least&nbsp; 2 to 3 weeks between trips if you&#039;re tripping regularly, although much smaller gaps won&#039;t do you any hard over a relatively short period of time. My own view is that if you&#039;re very experienced and sensitive to the effects then you&#039;ll notice that tolerance lasts a bit longer than is usually stated and believed (I think it can last up to 3 weeks after a really big trip). Well with any drug you should always give yourself&nbsp; as long as it takes for tolerance completely to subside between dosing, unless you&#039;re trying to&nbsp; make a permanent change to your physiology. <br /><br />Another issue is how you are tripping: set, setting and how they or are not evolving. If your tripping is integrated into a relatively healthy lifestyle or even into a long-term program of meditation training, yoga or whatever then the effects will be much more positive than if you &#039;re someone who is just looking to totally lose it for the sake of losing it, frying your brain without putting that experience into any wider personal context that helps your brain process it in a useful way. <br /><br />&nbsp;If you&#039;re losing a whole night&#039;s sleep every time you trip, smoke a fuckton and mix regularly with other drugs, then&nbsp; you&#039;re putting much more strain on your brain, endocrine and nervous systems etc. than if you just trip in the daytime with no other drugs and eat a healthy vegetarian meal at the end of the day. For example&nbsp; I don&#039;t know to what extent the studies that kmfkewm refers to controlled for heavy cannabis use. I suspect that it would be very difficult for them to find a large enough sample of subjects who have tripped that much but don&#039;t smoke a lot of weed, although I could be wrong about that, and all of those negative effects are associated with heavy weed use. <br /><br />Just some additional thoughts anyway.

				interesting thoughts. It&#039;s good to know that LSD doesn&#039;t &quot;put holes in your brain&quot; or &quot;gets stored in the creases of your spine&quot; like the ignorant masses like to preach. I feel much safer using it now, even though i&#039;m pretty sure I wouldn&#039;t be categorized as a heavy user. I get what sitdown was saying about losing a full nights sleep when taking L. Due to my schedule, I can usually only take acid at night, unless i take a few days off of work. When i take acid at night, I usually don&#039;t get any sleep (especially if it&#039;s a high dose). The next day i&#039;m usually slightly depressed and in a mental fog. I usually have trouble engaging in conversations with people for that next day. I was worried that prolonged heavy usage of acid would lead to a permanent state of this. The next time I consume a moderately heavy dose, I am going to take 3 days off of work, one day to trip, and two days of rest just to be safe

				It&#039;s something flow oriented, kind of like poi but different.&nbsp; It&#039;s just something I seem to be able to very vividly visualize motion and the flow kind of feels natural under the influence of acid.&nbsp; I am not talking large doses, maybe 2 tabs of average dosed (~100-150mics total), it&#039;s pretty inspiring to say the least, and it feels awesome being outside and spinning stuff around like that.
