				Hi guys/girls<br /><br />I used MDMA 3 times over a 9 month period. First time was fine (I mean, AMAZING).<br /><br />Second and third time, i start getting immense headache after about 300mg.<br /><br />I usually dose like<br /><br />t+0: 100 mg<br /><br />t+1h = 100mg<br /><br />t+3-4h (comedown) : 100 mg<br /><br />Anyone having the same experience ?<br /><br />I googled but most of them talk about headache the day after , i don&#039;t have that.

				Take less? 300mg is an immense amount, even at a rave. Try halving that.

				Many users complain of headaches either during the MDMA experience or shortly afterwards. There are a number of factors that could be causing them.<br /><br />First, serotonin may play a role in the cause of migraines. Serotonin releasing/depleting drugs like reserpine can induce a migraine. So it follows that MDMA, which causes the brain to be flooded with serotonin, could cause headaches.<br /><br />Second, MDMA is a stimulant, and stimulants raise blood pressure. Increased blood pressure is known to cause headaches.<br /><br />Third, the muscle and jaw tension caused by MDMA&#039;s stimulant effects can cause or contribute to a headache.<br /><br />Fourth, nystagmus could possibly cause a headache, especially if a user was attempting to focus his/her eyes.<br /><br /><br />I would advise taking a smaller dosage overall. Also up the initial dose by half, lower the second dose slightly and make it an appropriate booster, and remove the third dose completely as it&#039;s most likely causing more harm than good and due to tolerance will only exacerbate the negative effects while diminishing the positive. After all, you only have so much serotonin to give out before it&#039;s depleted right?<br /><br />So try taking a 130mg-180mg dose to begin with, followed by a 50mg-100mg booster after an hour or or even two at the most. :)

You&#039;re trying to increase the length of the high which just isn&#039;t going to flow well with a substance like MDMA, if you really wish to keep the trip going you&#039;ll need to invest in some other drugs. Several of my favorite drugs to do at the end of a roll are any of the 2C-X&#039;s, Ketamine, and any shroom or shroom like substance such as 4-HO-MET. They bring the euphoria back almost instantly and combine very nicely together. If you aren&#039;t rolling hard enough from a regular dose of MDMA then buy some MDA to kick it up a notch. ;)

				Hey Eternal Sunshine :)<br /><br />Re-dosing twice is never a good idea - once is better- and 300mg in total is stretching it a tad...<br /><br />Would suggest a dosing protocol more like:<br /><br />t+0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100mg - 150mg<br />t+1-2h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50mg - 100mg<br /><br />i.e. a bit higher initial dose, a lower 2nd dose and lose the third one.<br /><br />And keeping your total dose in the 200mg - 250mg range.<br /><br />It&#039;s probably your 2nd re-dose at t+3-4h that is causing the stress.<br /><br />If you want to extend the experience (we all do!) then I suggest using GHB instead of more MDMA - see my detailed post on this here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90975.0/index.php?topic=90975.0<br /><br />BG<br />

				<br />Quit screwing around and just take a 150-180mg dose, then at the 4 or 5 hr mark cap up 15-30 mg of 2c-b. Lovely time! Every time.
