				ok I can&#039;t be assed googling the exact link it is easy to find in todays news but apparently a psychiatrist has had the official OK in the USA now for some time to use MDMA to treat PTSD.<br /><br />The early results are that one dose, supervised, with lots of talking, fixed their shit right up because they were able to think through all their demons with clarity and without fear, and come to terms with &lt;whatever&gt;. A year later, they&#039;re still testing normal, unlike the control patients. The shrink has a queue out the door to get into the program.<br /><br />Hopefully this will eventually get MDMA off schedule 1. It definitely has a place in psychiatry.<br />

				Yes, I totally agree. A well supervised session of MDMA can be very valuable for PTSD. The powers that be know this, they are just corrupt psychopaths that will not listen to any sort of logic. It&#039;s totally sick. Our men and women in uniform usually mean well in my experience,and they go and take bullets for us and they are tossed aside like garbage and told to &quot;man up&quot;. PTSD is extremely well studied and usually no amount of courage or trying will work for these people without qualified medical help. As you say, it can help people dispassionately relive these experiences and process them and learn to cope. It&#039;s also valuable for rape victims for the same reason.<br /><br />Maps.org is doing great research in this area all the time. If you feel strongly on this subject please look them up and consider a small donation or if that&#039;s not possible volunteer some of your time possibly. IHMO, these people are fucking heroes. (As are our the vast majority of grunts in uniform, even if I don&#039;t always agree with the our foreign policies.)<br /><br />One caveat though, I&#039;m talking well controlled MDMA sessions. I can&#039;t necessarily recommend non supervised use, but I understand it, and punishing people for it is,of course, totally ludicrous.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh yeah, please provide that link if you can find it please. There are a few doctors doing highly controlled trials I know of, but if this is something new I would be interested. There are quite of few docs that have lost their licenses and even doing hard time for upholding their oaths,albeit illegally.
