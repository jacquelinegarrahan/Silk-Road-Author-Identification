				&nbsp;Never done it. My man wants to though. I have read up on it and it seems not to bad. Anyone care to share experiences here? The whole history is just so interesting.

				I&#039;ve never had it but would LOVE to, since I like opiates.&nbsp; A friend had some at a traveling concert a few years ago, and mentioned that smoking it &#039;tasted like flowers.<br /><br />I can only imagine it just as good if not better than pharm opiates.

				from a person with an H dependence, it is imo very poor advice to suggest someone smoke H when they express interest in trying opium. do you actually have experience with diacetylmorphine kap? (fucking stupid were the initial thoughts, but i restrained myself... H is on a completely different level) not to say opium is not also dangerous and addictive, but occasional use is fairly safe. <br /><br />i definitely you should try smoking the opium if you are interested, it is certainly a substance worth the experience. similar to a moderate opiate but also very different given the alkaloid composition. i appreciate the opportunity to sample opium given its rich history and importance/impact throughout history for the past thousands upon thousands of years<br /><br />one of the best things about opium is a delicious taste of earthy and fragrant floral aromas. produces lots of dense smoke and one of the best parts is just toking as you become more and more relaxed, mixes awesome with some fine bud too <br /><br />frogger, if you are expecting smoking small quantities to be as clean and potent as strong pharms your may just be slightly disappointed if it doesnt live up to your expectations. the buzz from opium is very enjoyable but pretty mellow...

If you haven&#039;t had other opiates, I think you could really enjoy it a lot. If you have very much experience with any other opiate, I think you will end up being disappointed. Having smoked heroin previously, I found it almost worthless. I had to go on a two-week break for me to even feel the effects. It was definitely worth the novelty of having smoked opium, but I won&#039;t be investing in any more of it, seeing as I honestly probably won&#039;t smoke the rest of my opium, anyway.

				I&#039;ve had opium once or twice. The last time was between three friends and myself, we rolled up a fat joint and threw in some hash and opium into it and it felt like a very very heavy stone. I was sitting on my couch for a while just buzzing in a great way.

				I actually used to opium for really lcheap not too long ago but that all dried up. Here&#039;s some things I can say about it:<br /><br />---It&#039;s much more mellower than say heroin, oxycontin, or even some lighter perks. I would say it&#039;s more on par with a calmer weed high, minus any indica effects.<br />---It&#039;s smell and taste is like inhaling vicks vapor and is actually a VERY pleasant smell. <br />---It&#039;s a great thing to add to a bowl of weed and mixes very well with the weed high<br />---Tend not to nod like on heavy opiates<br />---Looks like dark hash, black on the outside, brownish-black on the inside and is physically just like hash: sticky, but easily pulled apart, people to tend to roll it in a ball.<br /><br />Overall, I really like it and I don&#039;t see it at all related to oxy&#039;s or heroin.
