				Hello SR. I am a younger male who is 6&#039;2 ft. I weigh about 150 pounds. <br />I infrequently lift weights but I run on high speed on the treadmill for 1 hour daily.<br /><br />I would say I have a average looking face and a nice body type, I want to bulk up A LITTLE BIT. Not too much. I don&#039;t want to have huge abs and stuff I just want too be a little more muscular and be able too maintain it.<br /><br />What effects would steroids have on a younger male? (17)? Will it make my penis shrink and my balls go bigger?<br />How long would I have too do steroids to get a good build? Again, nothing really big, im just kind of a thin boy with lots of endurance but no muscle.<br /><br />What steroids would you recommend? I don&#039;t have a problem IMing it.<br /><br />How long would I have too do steroids to bulk up? When I was at desired muscle mass could I stop doing them but then go too the guy 3 times a week to maintain it?

				To get bigger, especially just a little bit, steroids are NOT the answer. Especially at 17. You&#039;re body isn&#039;t done fully developing until 21-25 and it is fairly accepted that taking steroids, synthetic testosterone, before you&#039;re done developing can cause serious, possibly irreversible, issues. <br /><br />To get bigger, you need to eat more. Get your protein/carb/fat macros in check. <br /><br />You&#039;re body CAN NOT magically make muscle. You&#039;re going to have to eat to pack on the muscle. That means dealing with slightly more body-fat as well depending on how much you bulk. <br /><br />Once you get to your desired size you&#039;re going to have to eat a fair amount, again depending on how much you gained, to stay big. <br /><br />Protein is the #1 key to gaining muscle and maintaining it. Do your homework.<br /><br />Go to bodybuilding.com forums<br /><br /><br />I would like to tell you steroids are the easy way out, but they aren&#039;t. Especially if you&#039;re not looking to get to 190lbs+ at 10% bodyfat. <br /><br />

To answer your question, yes, some steroids will make your testes shrink.&nbsp; However, there are numerous prescription drugs on the market to counteract that side-effect.

				There are two different effects to consider: Shrinkage of what is already there, and impeding growth of what will still develop. <br /><br />Especially the latter is sensitive to hormone balance disturbing substances like steroids, and would be reason to avoid them until your body has fully matured. 17 may seem a pretty mature age for most things, but development continues into your mid twenties, and you probably should not interfere with the natural process unless there is real medical need.

				At 17, it won&#039;t be too hard for you to bulk up a little without ever touching steriods. Don&#039;t mess with that stuff until you stop growing. Just hit the gym hard and lift heavier; keep raising the weights until you can only do 5 reps per set. Don&#039;t do stupid isolation exercises like bicep curls, rather do compound lifts like the bench press, dead lift, power clean, and SQUATS. At 6&#039;2&quot;, it will take a little longer for your mass to show compared to someone of average height. Don&#039;t get discouraged, as you have the capacity to be bigger than average sized people in the end. It&#039;s just that 5lbs of muscle is more noticeable on a slightly smaller frame with shorter limbs.<br /><br />Also, be sure that your diet is appropriate for muscle building. Eat at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. Stick to lean cuts of beef and chicken breast; shit like that. Make sure you drink lots of water and eat your vegetables too (I&#039;m serious). Also forget about legal supplements and protein powders until you&#039;re already somewhat big. That shit has more harmful chemicals in it than whatever it claims it has to make you big/cut/whatever. It&#039;s probably healthier for a 17 year old to take low levels of test than it is to take NO Explode and all that garbage.<br /><br />Now as for your question, no, most steroids will NOT shrink your dick. Testosterone, the most common anabolic steroid, MIGHT make your BALLS shrink because they will no longer be working as hard to produce your own test. If anything, your actual schlong will get harder when you are horny. Harder = longer and thicker than you are used to normally. And you will be horny often. LOL

				LOL sqautss all dayy boyy!!<br /><br />I used to take ON&#039;s 100% whey all the time until I found out about the high Cadium levels and shit. Once you get to a certain point though, it just becomes practical to use whey versus stuffing lean breast meat (huh huh huh) and steaks down your throat all day. I just wouldn&#039;t recommend it to beginners, that way you minimize exposure to whatever is in there while you don&#039;t really need protein powder. I don&#039;t think the Cadium levels would harm you unless you take it for years without stopping. Then again I&#039;m not entirely sure about that last part. Gonna do some reading...

				Yes, steroids will make your dick small, thereby depriving you of your masculinity. You will also not be able to have children, to a certain probability, and therefore should by all means purchase as many steroids as you can. I would recommend 250 mg trenbolone acetate, sustanon 250, masteron 600 mg, perhaps some peptides, and shit, why not 100 mg dianabol daily. Do this for 49 weeks, as that is an even number and is divisible by 7 which is God&#039;s number, thusly ensuring your safety as well as place in a future, completely healthy and self-fulfilling male hierarchy. Do not worry about your blood pressure, or the constant erections, or the faintness of breath. Also; you do not need a PCT, as it is an acronym for Pussy Crap That you don&#039;t need to get stacked and laid. As evidenced by the nature of that acronym, you can see why this so-called PCT, as it were, is an unnecessary protective step that insures nothing other than being a gigantic cracker jack Wimp. <br /><br />In retrospect, you will probably conclude it would be cheaper to overdose on heroin or merely jump off of a bridge. Or, you could just surpass all of this useless shit and go read a book if you would like to learn a little bit about being a healthy, productive human being rather than utilizing steroids or other substances to fulfill voids present within your own psyche. I.e, rather than being the type of poster/individual whom journalists and agents would love to jump on for a news story, be an intelligent functioning user of this great service rather than a Gigantic Asshole. <br /><br />If this is too hard, several options are available for you- such as the exciting prospect of working on your car until you get old and die, or perhaps you could simply revisit that old bridge or overdosing on H dichotomy, I suppose you could even stylistically insert some Pulp Fiction throwbacks. I know I would enjoy it. <br />

				You should not take steroids till your after at least 25! Yes they will make your balls shrink temporarily as your body doesnt need to produce test any longer as you are injecting! I would ditch the 1 hour hardcore running and swap it to 30 mins HIIT training. Long periods of cardio especially running kills your gains! Oh and do squats and deadlists FFS!

				REAL food only, please.&nbsp; Egg whites, fat free milk or yogurt, chicken breast, tuna, almonds and brazil nuts.&nbsp; Sleep 9 hours!&nbsp; Heavy weights.&nbsp; Forget the steroids because you have plenty of natural testosterone at 17.&nbsp; If you are serious about sleep, diet, and workout you can develop a very nice body using your body&#039;s own natural testosterone.&nbsp; Guys later in life WISH they could have all of the testosterone coursing through your veins now!

				When I was hitting the gym I made some really good gains using nutrition, after my workout I had a whey protein drink with creatine and glucose. Several people in work asked me if I was using steroids so I must have made some good progress<br /><br />Imo you don&#039;t need steroids at least for the first few months, I said to myself that I would consider them if I was finding it difficult to gain muscle but that time never came. Eventually I ended up getting another job that wore me out and ate all my time so I quit the gym, wish I hadn&#039;t tho. I&#039;d be bench pressing entire solar systems by now&nbsp; :P

				ROFL @ Shannon.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Yes, drink a lot of fat free milk!!!!!!&nbsp; Milk is the bomb for building muscle.&nbsp; Milk and meat, meat and milk.&nbsp; Hamburger helper?&nbsp; OK- but make it with very lean protein like ground turkey.&nbsp; Or red meat is fine but lean like ground sirloin instead of fatty ground beef.&nbsp; Did we tell you to eat?&nbsp; You can&#039;t get big without eating!

				&nbsp;:( NO steroids until you&#039;ve been lifting and dieting your ass off for at least until your 21 Period. You are really young and trust me i graduated high school at 18 at 5&quot;10 165lbs and couldn&#039;t bench 135lbs (not that bench is important its the most overrated things guys use to measure themselves against each other but that&#039;s beside the point.&nbsp; When i hit 21 i got into lifting pretty heavy since i&#039;d grown up to 6&quot;2 and weighed 178 dripping wet, I still felt like a bean pole and wanted to get bigger.&nbsp; I was lucky and got with a couple of veterans that pointed me in the right direction on training diet and gear once they saw I was dedicated they helped me get into the right direction. but to answer your original question steriods don&#039;t shrink your penis they can shrink your balls since your body stops making natural testosterone once it realizes it has a surplus in its system if your on a steroid cycle&nbsp; they are ancillary drugs that are safe that you can use such as clomid and HCG but i&#039;m not sure the HCG they sell in bodybuilding stores is the real stuff that will help bring your natural test back on line and reduce losses in gains once you quick the cycle. If you use the proper PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) you can keep approx 80% of your gains if you keep training and eating your ass off and keeping your protein high with proper rest.&nbsp; Just think about it a little, if a drop in male testosterone leads to erectile dysfunction and muscle loss how would a serious increase in testosterone have a negative effect on libido, hell when i&#039;m on cycle I can barely control myself from humping the greeter if she&#039;s at least a 4 at the nearest Walmart, most of the shit you hear about juice is bullshit and most of the negative affects that makes the news come from kids using at way too young of an age, when their body hasn&#039;t ben given a chance to fully grow up and develope especially with all those raging hormones in adolesce. and guys using way too high of doses which just give them worst side effects like water retention and acne so stay away from that stuff until your ready to make that committment and watch the documentary bigger faster stronger and order a couple books off Amazon on the subject by guys like William Lewellyn and others don&#039;t just buy one book buy a few and compare what they say and don&#039;t take anyone for and end all be all expert including myself but there is alot of useful info in there.

				And as a point of information, some balls don&#039;t shrink.&nbsp; Even on a very heavy cycle of test my boys stay the same size- or there is no discernible difference.&nbsp; I do get the dull ache though.&nbsp; That was only bad when I didn&#039;t know what it was!&nbsp; LOL.

				Why?&nbsp; you want to get buff for chicks, I assume, but your dick shrinks....&nbsp; major conundrum.&nbsp; This is so wrong on so many levels.&nbsp; Once you&#039;re past 17, you should not be worried about your dick size.&nbsp; Just learn to use it.&nbsp; Women don&#039;t care, in fact, too big is bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wear a size 12.5 shoe, so it&#039;s not an issue.&nbsp; But I did marry an 90 lb Asian woman, so my dick looks like an arm in her mouth.&nbsp; <br /><br />I commented on a kids post that went something like, &quot;because are dicks are bigger, you cracker.&quot;&nbsp; First question, how do you know?&nbsp; Do you watch a lot of gay porn? Do you run around measuring other men&#039;s dicks?&nbsp; If you got a small dick learn to eat pussy, you score way more points.&nbsp; <br /><br />If only I knew what I know now, back then.... you&#039;re worrying about minutia.&nbsp; After 25, it&#039;s all down hill for women.&nbsp; Old man - out!<br /><br />

				Steroids don&#039;t shrink your dick.&nbsp; Let me say it again:&nbsp; steroids don&#039;t shrink your dick.&nbsp; MAYBE your nuts will shrink while you are on cycle, but they will rapidly regain their normal size with proper PCT (post-cycle therapy- usually Nolvadex and Clomid) as they resume their normal testosterone production.

				I&#039;m prepared to answer any question you might have about anabolic steroids, diet pills, Kamagra or Apcalis [viagra/cialis], or any other product I sell.&nbsp; What do you want to know?
