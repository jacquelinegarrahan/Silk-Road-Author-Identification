				I tripped on LSD for the first time alone it made me really sad I usually don&#039;t get lonely or unhappy I usually don&#039;t give a fuck about a single thing, but just the fact that I had just about no one to talk to at the time made me almost cry. it was weird. I usually prefer being alone but while I was tripping even the lightest bit of small talk with people kept me sane/happy. it made me kind of understand why we have small talk, I&#039;ve usually talked shit about like it was just point and useless tranmitions with no data like parrots, but while I was tripping just the small bit of conversation brought immense amounts of comfort/relief. I also had some trouble with clammy feeling I just felt like everything had a slimy cover of oil over it was disgusting, and it made me feel bloated...I couldn&#039;t even think of watching tv the commercials and tv shows made me look down on society and the media as if it were openly corrupting everything good in society. idk this is just a rant, but what do you think of a bad/good trip. after having my semi bad one I feel like I was glad to have the experience but I&#039;m going to take a break for awhile, it brought up a lot of negative emotions that I&#039;ve been holding back for a very long time. and they just all bubbled up to the surface and exploded in mind for hours.

				also are their any solid methods for reducing trip anxiety? or is that something you just have to deal with?

				If you&#039;re more experienced with tripping and know what you&#039;re going in to by being able to control a bad trip coming on, tripping alone can be a beautiful and amazing thing. <br />Most people would rather trip with a group because when you&#039;re alone you are more inside your<br />head and have to deal with what ever you decide think up.<br /><br />Tripping with good friends is always fun were as being alone is more of a serious thinking session. Just my opinion though.

				there is pros and cones for both actually.<br />I like tripping alone because you don&#039;t have to worry about anybody else, I have time for my thoughts , My music and it&#039;s a really good way to know yourself.<br /><br />Maybe those negative emotions you mentioned came up for a reason, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s healthy to repress these feelings because you will have to confront them some time or another.. <br /><br />- And i heard Xanax pretty much kills the trip.<br /><br />cheers , hailsatan :)<br /><br />

				The last few times I have tripped alone :) sometimes the trip starts going weird, but just convince yourself its you and no one else controlling it and turn it around :D it all depends on your state of mind and where you want it to go. If there is too much negativity in your mind then I would recommend tripping in a group. 8) the distraction of other people can take your own thoughts away and focus on other things.

				It&#039;s better alone for me. Tripping with friends can be fun but honestly it&#039;s just a distraction from the experience.<br /><br />I consider psychedelics a connection to something higher though so yeah... Seems like most people who haven&#039;t taken high doses consider that type of thinking &quot;crazy&quot; and that&#039;s plenty okay with me :P<br /><br />as far as crying goes.....<br /><br />Psychedelics dont create imaginary situations, they just magnify everything so intensely that you can&#039;t ignore them.<br /><br />Every time I&#039;ve cried while tripping has been a magical soulful experience.<br /><br />also, all emotions are fueled from perception, so maybe try working on the way you see the world?<br /><br />hope you find this helpful.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just though I&#039;d ask for some advice on this topic..<br />I always trip and take drugs with others, but I&#039;m really up for trying Mescaline (HCL) but I heard it&#039;s best to use it by yourself. Can anyone give me any tips from first hand experience?

				I&#039;ve tripped with others and by myself. I find that when I&#039;m alone it&#039;s more of a time to listen to music and ponder the universe and when with others it&#039;s time to chat and run around in the woods. Both are great fun.

				It&#039;s certainly better to trip alone then to trip with the wrong people. I did it alone the first time and it was perfect like this, but I really want to do it with friends now as this is the better experience I guess. You just need to choose the right people, people with a brain.<br />Stay away from drunk people. Not good. ;)

				I suppose the key to tripping with others is to find others that have experienced it before. People that have no experience with psychedelics may misjudge your condition for something&nbsp; serious and call ambulances and such. <br /><br />These people are not to blame a they just respond to a situation which is in&nbsp; their view dangerous. Sometimes they are not mistaken either, but people with some experience will go about things differently, like taking your blood pressure, heart and respiration rate and consider those before calling 911.
