				What&#039;s the best way to obtain a supply of needles without having to meet face to face IRL, or order with my name off the clearnet?(for exorbitant prices I might add)<br /><br />I know you can order kits on the road but they are pricey and I want to use the road as little as possible for things that I can not get anywhere else.<br /><br />I have heard of needle exchanges but the means a face to face with someone IRL and they might ask my name or some other info about me I would rather not give.<br /><br />thanks in advance

				You can buy amazon gift cards or paysafecards with cash and then order then from clearnet anonymously, they&#039;ll only have your address but even if it&#039;s your own it&#039;s anonymous enough I would think, it&#039;s nothing illegal.<br />Needles on clearnet are extremely cheap, amazon.de has like 12 different gauges of needles and also wheelfilters, sterile empty injection bottles, etc. (a lot of other medical supplies too). 100 needles costs a couple euros there, syringes cost around the same (they&#039;re sold separately). Amazon.com only sells syringes and blunt needles last time I checked though so you&#039;ll have to order needles from germany... You&#039;ll pay more in shipping than in product but it&#039;ll still be cheap. Maybe $10 for 100 needles. You can buy insulin needles at drugstores in the US too in some areas, or you have to go to the pharmacy. <br /><br />In a pharmacy, buy some vitamin B12 (injectable), so you can just be like &quot;Oh yeah, I&#039;ll need needles too please&quot; and avoid suspicion. I prefer amazon but it&#039;s up to you... There&#039;s also needle exchange.

				You didn&#039;t mention where you live.<br /><br />If you can get away with insulin syringes then you can just go into the pharmacy and buy a box in most of the world.&nbsp; There are so many diabetics that nobody even notices.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in the US, then many states allow you to buy syringes without a prescription.&nbsp; They are also available at countless places online for reasonable prices (eg $0.15-$0.20 for a 3mL syringe+needle) from places ranging from vet supply to research chemical.&nbsp; I suppose if you don&#039;t want them to have your name you could use a pre-paid credit card and a fake name.

				If you are UK the needle exchanges are anonymous and very helpful.
