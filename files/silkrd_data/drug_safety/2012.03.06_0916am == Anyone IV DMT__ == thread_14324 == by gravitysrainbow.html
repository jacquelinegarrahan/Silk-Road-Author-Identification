				I heard it was the bees knees but I&#039;d rather make sure it&#039;s legit before I fuck myself for good. I&#039;ve only heard of one guy doing it and he said to mix 25mg of freebase with water and a couple drops of distilled vinegar or lemon juice. I don&#039;t want to try this based on this-one-guy I&#039;ve never met before... so any experience with iv-ing dmt or any advice with iv-ing in general that you might think might be relevant is appreciated.

				Thats pretty much standard procedure for IV, with the exception of you start tripping your balls off before the needle is out of your arm, so an experienced sitter administering the dosage is probably required. i would head over to drug safety for some advice though if you dont know what youre doing.<br /><br />in order to convert to the salt, preferably you use the dose and the molecular weight to determine the moles of dmt, then use the same moles of acid to fully convert all the freebase to a water soluble form, without overly acidifying the solution. blood is an amazing buffer however, so this may not be an issue give the way people IV acidified heroin<br /><br />also, there was a clinical study done involving IV doses of DMT in human volunteers by Dr. Strassman, it is an excellent read and highly recommended before you consider such a profound and intense experience. <br /><br />

If I were personally dosing I would choose the fumarate over any of the others. Converting to the fumarate salt is both easy and gives theoretically controlled yields and a very clean and safe product which is HIGHLY soluble. AFAIK, this is the salt Strassman used in his studies as well.

				Question: I have heard that smoking DMT produces a foul smelling plastic odor that can be quite strong, does this not have the potential to skew your trip in a negative way?<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried DMT, a shame since I live a couple of hours from amazonian jungle where I could legally try ayahuasca, but I have read The Spirit Molecule and would highly recommend it to anyone with interest in the soul and/or psychedelics.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really can&#039;t stand needles and I&#039;m unlikely to be able to get hold of smokable dmt so I will at best get to try drinking it with maois one day.

I have a friend who struggles to take a hit of DMT just due to the taste. However, I don&#039;t believe it would alter the trip just an uncomfortable time dosing. Personally, after returning from a breakthrough I find the smell to remind very relaxing. I&#039;ve probably just associated the taste and smell with my DMT trips which are pure bliss.<br /><br />To the OP, I hope you report back on your experience! Smoking DMT is already very intense so I would love to hear a personal report on an IV dose. Best of luck!

As far as ruining your trip,&nbsp; ime natural taste will be a completely foreign concept to you and will have no effect on your trip.

				I wouldn&#039;t IV it unless it was synthesized by a professional in a lab.&nbsp; Not shit that&#039;s been extracted from plants.&nbsp; I know purification is the same either way, but I wouldn&#039;t trust that the hexane is ONLY pulling DMT.&nbsp; You don&#039;t know what else was in the plant material, what it was extracted with or what it has come into contact with.
