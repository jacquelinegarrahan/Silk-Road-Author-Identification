				Hey guys we should really have a Trip Report part to the forms no?<br /><br /><br />But anyway took 1.5g of T. Leary shrooms and it was amazing so here is what happened <br /><br /><br />I took them at 12:15pm and they tasted like complete shit but I ate em and all, my good friend comes over and he is my sitter and we are just talking normally. It&#039;s about 15 minutes into my trip and my stomach hurts. We go to Wendy&#039;s I get a burger and a soda and we just talk and it hits me a little bit, so we get back home and its about 45 minutes in and I am feeling it I am VERY GIDDY though I had no visuals an awesome body high my pupils were huge as fuck and I was just giddy and it was awesome. Went for a walk at a local park and it was just pure bliss alhough no OEV or CEV but still had over four hours of in depth heart to heart conversations. Anyway he leaves and these girls knock on my door and they come in and we all smoke bud and chilled on the couch haha . Over all it lasted 4 1/2 hours long, overall I was sad that I had no visuals but had a great trip

				cool thing that u decided to try them..<br />however, id recommend doing a &#039;real&#039; dose next time. you barely got a whiff of what shrooms are really like <br />it&#039;s like going drinking and just having one drink..you gotta go for the full bottle if u wanna get drunk :) (obviously its just an analogy, not proposing alcohol poisoning or anything lol)

				again, i dont want to come off like im trying to undermine your trip<br />1.5g is a good starting dose but it really depends on the mushies themselves<br />from your experience report it seems like you werent fully blown away<br /><br />it really depends on what you want to experience<br />if your interest is just having a good mellow time then by all means keep that dose<br />but if your interest is getting the full shroom experience, go for 3-4g :)<br />its not a huuuge dose but its enough to give you a full trip<br />anything lower is just an &#039;almost there&#039; dose without the full range of effects that this beautiful substance offers
