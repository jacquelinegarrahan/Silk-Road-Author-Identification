				So i have a lot of experience with cocaine of the road but mainly just with good quality street cocaine. I see a lot of listings on the road that are offering uncut cocaine but i was just wondering how true these claims are?<br /><br />Any cocaine buyers advise on this?

				Bungee54 and ItalianMafiaBrussels supposedly have some close to pure/uncut coke. Do a search and read up on it and decide for yourself.<br /><br />I have found that, at least for myself, it&#039;s more useful to conceive of all cocaine as cut--that way I don&#039;t have to spend time searching for the Holy Grail of uncut fairydust cocaine. I only have to try to find the better stuff, not the perfect stuff.

It was more just a general question after seeing listings for uncut cocaine I just wanted to know if this was true! I would have preferred left my question unanswered than waste my time sifting through a load of reviews for something I&#039;m not going to buy! However I did look at the thread with lab tests and this is actually very good and answered my question a lot better than than the review thread so thanks for pointing me in that direction! <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to be rude either but it makes me scratch my head sometimes when someone moans about a question that has already been asked and this probably takes more time than just giving a simple answer even if for the millionth time! An answered question is only good if you have seen the answer!

				I understand. <br /><br />I guess it&#039;s just me and my not wanting to clutter up the forums unnecessarily but whenever I take the time to create a new thread, I want to make sure I&#039;m not making a redundant thread. The nature of your question led me to believe that you hadn&#039;t looked around the forums AT ALL. <br /><br />It&#039;s like asking someone to Google something for you. <br /><br /><br />

I&#039;m not usually a lazy forum user, like i say i think its just because I&#039;m not actually planning on buying any cocaine just wanted to know if the claims of uncut coke could be backed up by any buyers! Also its sometimes good to have an up to date answer as I&#039;m sure vendors products change (The lab test thread is perfect though as this appears to be kept up to date)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165795.msg1178230#msg1178230">Quote from: ozymandias2013 on May 30, 2013, 09:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s like asking someone to Google something for you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t feel its like that at all! I couldn&#039;t find out from Google if the coke on SR is uncut or not! Even after searching on the forum again I&#039;m finding it hard to quickly locate where someone has answered this question accept the lab tests thread which answers the question but indirectly!<br /><br />This is something i do hate with a passion though is when somebody asks something that could be answered with a quick and easy Google search!!<br /><br />Anyway.... it was you that pointed me in the right direction so thanks, I really do appreciate it! I didn&#039;t mean to come across as one of them lazy forum goers and i apologize if any of my responses to your post sounded rude.... that wasn&#039;t my intention!<br /><br />

				My pure cocaine is pure. I know everyone say&#039;s their cocaine is pure and I know they are full of shit. I think I would be one of the only people in the world selling pure cocaine on silkroad. I am from Australia so the prices are way to high for most of you so this will mean nothing. <br />I can stand by my cocaine 100% because I get it from Peru before it&#039;s even finished. I import directly to Australia and there is nobody in the middle who can touch it. My cocaine can be lab tested to prove I don&#039;t talk shit.<br />If someone can prove to me that they can have a lab test done I will be willing to send them a free sample to have it tested. They will need to provide the lab test results for this forum.<br />&nbsp;;)
