				My friend is buying crystal mdma here and selling it on the street. He has been crushing rock salt up and cutting it with his molly which is causing problems with stomach aches.... i told him not to cut it and to just charge more for purity but he refuses. So my question is: what is the best substance to cut mdma with and have no negative effects from? I was thinking crushed vitamins that are safe to take in larger doses such as calcium magnesium, etc. what do you guys think?

				If you are the ony suplying your friend by SR i would just stop man. This is complete bullshit to who ever buy his md and i guess its affecting the experience of mdma. What happens to people selling for the love of the drug they have .... its just 100% retarted imo.

				I guess I&#039;d rather have my molly cut with vitamins than fucking rock salt. Than again you could always do the moral thing and not cut it at all.

				Hahaha well obviously it would be best not to cut it at all, but it&#039;s going to happen anyway doesn&#039;t help OP at all to tell him he already stated that&#039;s what he recommended.<br />I&#039;ve heard of people cutting with baby laxitives (pisses me off, LITERALLY) and lactose. But easiest is just to sell it in capsules because then weight is irrelevant

				like everyone else, i agree, it is morally wrong to cut it and be selling it as pure MDMA. that being said, sucrose is a good thing to cut it with and is harmless. if your friends wants to be cool, and cut it like old school rolls, he could cut it with ketamine. that would be a pretty fun time :)

				Cutting MDMA before you sell it is short sighted and greedy so I suggest you persuade him otherwise. If not then crushed 5 htp pills will not be noticed by the average Joe and is similar in appearance.

				Get a ball mill, and use glass or ceramic balls as the medium. You can micronize your mdma crystal

				WTF Cut MDMA is why I only buy it here now and use a reagent to test. Your friend needs to be cut off from supply. Cut MDMA is a health hazard and if i knew who this guy was I&#039;d tell him to go fuck himself. Drug impurity is a direct byproduct of prohibition and SR is a way to liberty for freethinkers. If he wants to sell drugs sell good clean drugs that are what he says they are. He will gain a great rep and customers will return. Cut is sprungface crackhead behavior.

				It shouldn&#039;t be cut. Just put less in a cap is $$ is a problem for you or him or whatever. My buddies like getting doses from me and I usually put 120mg-150mg in a cap. You or your buddy honestly can&#039;t sell 100mg of pure MDMA? Shit what&#039;s the world coming to....<br /><br />I love when my friends call me &quot;YOOO BEST ROLL OF MY LIFE SERIOUSLY I LOVE YOU&quot; it&#039;s a fantastic feeling to know you made a bunch of people&#039;s night even better.<br /><br />so...stop your friend from being a scum bag.
