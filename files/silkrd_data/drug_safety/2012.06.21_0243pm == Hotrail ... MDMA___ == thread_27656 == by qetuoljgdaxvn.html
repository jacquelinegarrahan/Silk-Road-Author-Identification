				was chilling with my partner at home last weekend, did a hotrail or 2 of ice and got to thinking how what mdma would be like hotrailed..<br /><br />For curiosity&#039;s sake I&#039;ve chucked small (20mg or so) md rocks into a clean pipe a couple of times before but while I could feel a tiny bit of a buzz all over the body, it not only made me waste 5 mins cleaning the super sticky brown/orange goo that md melts into, but stunk up my place and my lungs no doubt. A hotrail is a bit different though since the MD doesn&#039;t get the chance to sit in a hot spot as the powder literally gets superheated in milliseconds as it rushes into the nostrils, and I Just received 5g of PF&#039;s md and thought why not, let&#039;s give it a shot.<br /><br />made a line of 20mg first to test it out.. Doubted I&#039;d feel anything from it but I wanted a half decent amount of powder without it being too much in case the vapor is really bad or it ends up being shit, etc...<br /><br />Heated up the pyrex straight pipe I use for hotrailing to about the same level as I do for meth, maybe a tiny bit less and railed the powder, and then................<br />Surprise! <br />Barely got the terrible smell/taste when you vape in a bowl, blew out a great big cloud of vape and i around 30 seconds started to feel a very mild come up/rush...<br />The &quot;hot&quot; tip of the pipe did get some goo on it as the powder unavoidably got stuck to part of the wall near the entrance, so I&#039;d guesstimate me on only consuming 15g -ish<br /><br />Partner wanted to try next and wanted a decent dose to begin with so I laid out 60mg which was hotrailed in 1 impressive motion.. This time there was considerably more goo on the tip of the rail (used a different) and I realised this happened because I heated the pipe too much. It seemed that when you hotrail mdma, you want the glass to be colder somewhat...<br /><br />My turn agani! Laid out 60mg for myself and this time heated the pipe a bit less while still being very hot of course..<br />Railed the entire line, very minimal goo on the pipe&#039;s tip and not much on the mirror..&nbsp; MASSIVE cloud of vapor and another 20 seconds later mdma signs everywhere! As soon as I uttered my first word I knew MD was hitting me because my voice sounded different, then so did the music, etc..<br /><br />Didn&#039;t last a whole lot of time however and so in my opinion it&#039;s a petty wasteful ROA, however brings the fun of hotrailing - yes it&#039;s fun when you are good at it! Plus if you&#039;ve eaten heaps and haven&#039;t had vitamins etc, your absorbtion would be pretty poor if you eat a cap but smoking bypasses all that.<br /><br />Next time I do md which will of course be a standard 125 - 150mg cap, I mght do a hotrail once to top up, see how it goes!<br /><br />Any thoughts on this? Or have others tried this already?

				I never thought to rail MD but it sounds like most drugs when you smoke them, quicker onset, shorter duration.<br /><br />I think I will probably stick to caps but if i get bored or have some extra laying around I may give it a shot just out of curiously.

				the vape tastes pretty horrible if you do it in a bowl, which I learnt not to do after trying twice with 2 different batches.<br /><br />But, the taste/smell is virtually non-existent if you hotrail it correctly - don&#039;t heat the pipe as much as you&#039;d do for meth,<br /><br />I&#039;ll eat my regular dose in a cap this w/e and at around the usual 25 - 30min mark when it hits me i&#039;ll hotrail a bit to see if the rush is a bit different and stronger.<br />will let you guys know anyway :)
