				What do you overall consider the best hi, excluding the hangover, physical harm etc, just regarding the pleasurability of the hi?<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve tried alcohol (often), meth, amphetamine, mdma, various &quot;research chemicals&quot;, cannabis, opiates (no heroin so far, I may pass on that one), cocaine.<br /><br />I have to say the best hi i have experienced is from mdma + some alcoholic drinks taken before for relaxation. I would describe that feeling of taking maybe 300-400 mg of MDMA on a relatively clean brain (other drug consumption paused 2 weeks before) as the best one can achieve, the closest to pure happiness and ecstasy (as the name implies), no aggression, no ill will, forgetting one&#039;s problems, feeling with others and just feeling great. Wish that was possible every day, instead of once a month, then I guess I would be a junky. But what&#039;s your opinion? <br /><br />I am of course ignoring the next day and all the depression etc. that follows.

Even the humble beer tastes better and gets me to a better place when I&#039;m with great people in a good venue.<br /><br />Point is, some people may say that Heroin is the best high they&#039;ve ever had, and I&#039;m not going to disagree with them. But for me I&#039;d be freaking out about the dangers of the chemical, real and perceived. And I can almost guarantee that would put me in a bad place.

				For me it&#039;s definitely doing a shot of high potency, high-quality H. I try not to use very often to keep my tolerance down, so that I get the max amount of pleasure from every mg I use. It&#039;s hard to describe the feeling - still in control of my body and thoughts (which is why I&#039;m not a fan of psychadelics - I&#039;m not a fan of hallucinating or feeling out of control) but just in a mental place that fees perfect in every way. It doesn&#039;t just feel good, it feels beautiful.<br /><br />That said, if you have the will power, please don&#039;t get started. Since I started shooting my life is the same in terms of job, relationships, etc. - but i sometimes feel like I&#039;m walking the razor&#039;s edge and could easily fall into the abyss.

				I&#039;ve never had such wonderful euphoria as on LSD. I&#039;ve been blissful on MDMA, but when I compare it to LSD it&#039;s like true euphoria has multiple facets and MDMA is missing one or two while LSD isn&#039;t.<br /><br />Put another way, Molly is really fun to spend time with, she&#039;s a great gal and always makes for a really enjoyable night, but Lucy likes to go out for more intimate experiences, spiritually speaking, and she still knows how to be tons of fun like Molly.<br /><br />Of course, if LSD exhibited every effect except euphoria I wouldn&#039;t know, because merely experiencing the other effects (perspective shifts, thought form shifts, visual effects) would elevate me to euphoria because I enjoy them so dearly in and of themselves, and this only adds to the euphoria I personally experience.

				In terms of sheer physical sensation peaking strongly on some great MDMA is about as good as life gets. Period.&nbsp; Add to that the euphoria and happiness that it induces, and it&#039;s got all bases covered.<br />The thing i&#039;m taking from reading this thread though, is that a lot of people get high and euphoric from the effects of their drug of choice, indirectly, as in, they enjoy their psychedelic-induced realisations and visual effects so much that the euphoria almost takes on a more natural form than something like MDMA, which I completely agree with.<br />I remember seeing my bathroom wall turn into tiny little mouths in the texture of the paint and seeing symbols from ancient civilizations jumping off the wall from 2mgs of 25i nbome.<br />While not outright &quot;euphoria&quot;, it was a breakthrough experience for me, visually, and that made me happier in a more real way than MDMA can, which itself is hugely euphoric, but a lot more pushy.<br /><br />My vote goes to MDMA though, in terms of sheer rushing amazing feelings and physical sensations.

				If you like psychedelics, the best high you can achieve in terms of straight pleasure is 5-MeO-DiPT.<br /><br />But nothing can ever compare with states of deep and immersive, peaceful self-aware consciousness that manifests by some drugs. The personal revelation and true understanding of God, melting into the infinite unity of the All... things like that are not comparable and unnameable.
