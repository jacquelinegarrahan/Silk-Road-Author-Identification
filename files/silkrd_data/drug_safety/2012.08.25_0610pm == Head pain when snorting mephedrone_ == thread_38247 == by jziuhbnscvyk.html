				Immediately after doing a line of it I feel pain at the top of my head for a few minutes before it goes away, I haven’t had this for anything else I have snorted.<br /><br />I think it could be the pain it’s causing to the nose as it’s the least pleasant powder I’ve sniffed, and this could be similar to brain freeze?<br />The pain is immediate so I don’t think the mephedrone could have of gotten into my system quickly enough to cause the pain from it taking effect.<br /><br />Has anyone else experienced this or heard of it?

				You are sticking foreign objects into your nasal cavity, what do you expect?<br /><br />It happens sometimes, don&#039;t worry about it unless it is consistent for a while after.

				Yep Mephedrone does this to me sometimes, its the second most painful chemical i&#039;ve ever snorted (closely behind 2C-B). <br />I&#039;d recommend after you snort the line, leave it two minutes or so then snort a small amount of water through you&#039;re nose it helps, I also usually find after about the 2nd line my pain threshold is much higher. <br />OH and also make sure the powder is crushed up as small as you can get it. Place it on a hard surface, grad a debit card or something and push down on the powder as much as possible until its completely crushed fine.

				Methadrone is all about the IV.<br /><br />Tried it every other way and by 100 miles IV is the way to go - major rush, instantly&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Not that I&#039;m promoting IV&#039;ing....so for those that don&#039;t IV don&#039;t start FFS as it can lead to a slippery slope.

				Lol yeah I always build it. Why do 100mg of pain when you can do 2 x 75mg or 4 x 50mg in quick succession and avoid it? <br /><br />And you wont need 100mg of the new shit anyway + it&#039;s much smoother.
