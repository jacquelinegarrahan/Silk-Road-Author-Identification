				Have been on klonopin for awhile now. Takes about 7mgs to get me to &quot;that special place&quot;. Was wondering if anyone with more experience could tell me roughly how many mgs of diazepam(valium) that would be equal to? Thanks guys.

				It takes me roughly 4MG of xanax to get me to my special place and about 50-100MG of valium to even feel anything at all. Never been to the special place with Valium

Benzos are Benzos they all get the job done. I prefer a Xanax high over any other Benzo. I know ppl who like Valium just like I have a friend who swears by Temazepam (I call him crazy but he insist it&#039;s the best) Either way I think you will enjoy one thing I will say about Valium I take large amounts and not appear to be fucked up, Like If I take 2-3 Bars I start to slur and have an over all fucked up demeanor, Which is not always good.

				Thanks CC. I have the strangest relationship with kpins. I can go days/weeks without taking a single milligram. Then i get an itch to chill out, take 3mg, nothing, take 4 more mg, and finally get where i wanted to be. I feel like my benzo tolerance never goes down. Only up and up! Ugh.

Coming off any Benzo can be extremely dangerous and deadly. I have had seizures from Xanax with drawl which is one of the worst experiences of my life.

				..and please don&#039;t forget Valium has a half-life of 100 days (!)

				Thats true. Valium has a lot of attractive qualities if used as an anxiolytic or mild sedative. For clinical application the long half life (including metabolites) may be&nbsp; a good thing, making it a drug that you only need to take once a day to remain a decently constant level. <br /><br />For recreational use something like xanax is more attractive because it doesnt last that long. If you want to space out on benzo&#039;s you&#039;ll probably don&#039;t want to have that effect remain for the next day or so. <br /><br />As far as tolerance/addiction goes all benzo&#039;s pose a risk, and the cross tolerance is very large too. The mechanism of all of these drugs is nearly identical. While valium may take a very long time to break down, withdrawal from valium is not much different then from xanax or clonazepam. Taking a different benzo will usually alleviate withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />I suppose the biggest risk for addiction is that you can take moderate amounts of benzo&#039;s while functioning normally. Just take some to take the edge off, and regular use just creeps up on you, resulting in eventual tolerance and dependence. Most people get addicted taking prescription doses regularly, not taking recreational doses occasionally. <br />
