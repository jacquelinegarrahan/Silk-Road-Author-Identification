				I&#039;ve recently made a purchase of two grams of &quot;pure, fishscale cocaine&quot; from a reputable vendor. According to him, this coke comes in rock form. I also know that crack cocaine comes in rock form. I feel that as soon as I show my friends what I got, their first assumption will be &quot;HOLY SHIT BRO YOU JUST BOUGHT CRACK!!!&quot; However I know this is not the case. Can anybody educate me to the differences between the two drugs so I will be able to explain to my skeptical uneducated friends?

				Crack is cocaine in base form, so it&#039;s undergone a chemical reaction from the powder form. Fishscale is definitely not crack, and can&#039;t be smoked.

				&quot;Cocaine&quot; (for snorting/injecting) is actually cocaine hydrochloride and &quot;crack&quot; (for smoking) is freebase cocaine.
