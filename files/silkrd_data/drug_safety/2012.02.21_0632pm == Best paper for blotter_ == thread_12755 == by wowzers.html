				I&#039;m going to try making some 4-AcO-DMT blotter for summer (the local free party and psy scene will love it ). I&#039;m starting experimenting with solvents, printing, perforation etc this weekend and I&#039;m buying supplies tomorrow. Planning on laying them at about 5mg/cm2 if it will take. I realise degradation will be a problem, so as well as freshly laying them before sale I&#039;m going to look at ways of pre-treating the paper to slow hydrolysis + oxidation.<br /><br />To save me spending loads on different types of paper, does anyone here have any recommendations as to which type is the best?<br /><br />I spent the afternoon making some designs, they all look pretty fucking cool- I&#039;ll post some images here later and see what you think&nbsp; :D

				sounds like the tatse would make it not worth it, unless the dose subliminally was at least 1/2 of the oral dose

				The HCL doesn&#039;t taste too filthy, a vendor gave me some very good advice and I made a pilot batch last week. I took some shrooms last Thursday and some friends tried the blotter (15 min under the tongue) and had a good response. Beats chewing up 4 grams of dried mushroom :D<br />Blotter has novelty value and sell well and the way I&#039;m laying them allows the user to finely adjust their dose (5mg per square).

				I have no experience laying blotter, but I have often read that quality watercolor paper is what you want.&nbsp; It&#039;s thick and porous.&nbsp; If you knew that already and are just asking about brands/varieties, I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t be much more help.

				He just said to use 100% unbleached cotton paper and not to use commercial home-printer ink. Looking into it further, unbuffered neutral cotton paper is available, designed for long-life applications such as archiving important documents. <br />Obviously heavier paper is better for higher compound loading and small grain size allows accurate dosing on smaller hits as there is less spread resulting from capillary action.<br /><br />

				Honestly Smarties also works (its how I sell 4-ACO and 2c-b) as they are easy to dose out and have a pill quality to them. However, blotter sounds quite nice. I get 1mg of 25i and 9mg HPBCD on a hit so I am pretty sure it would be possible. <br /><br />Also maybe you can try complexing the 4-ACO-DMT with HPBCD.
