				Receive 1G of something. How does everyone dish out 10mg? Do you use a sensitive scale or something? Lots of checmicals are in powder or crystal form. Is it best to crush the crystals up as much as you can, or if just weighed properly doesn&#039;t matter? Any good source for a good miligram scale or something real precise? How do you do it?<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

				Depends what it is, how dose sensitive it is.<br /><br />Cocaine. Don&#039;t weigh anything. End up doing a quarter gram line. - Not for beginners<br /><br />MDMA- Use a 0.001 scale to measure out 0.100 or so. Depends how much wanna do at that time. Maybe a little more, or a little less. Am I going out, or staying in?<br /><br />Any 2C`s... be very careful. These are very dose sensitive. 0.001 scale a very good idea.<br /><br />Other stuff. Use best judgement. Weigh it if you can.<br /><br />

				If you know exactly how much stuff you have to begin with, dissolving it to an appropriate solvent and then measuring the doses in volume could work.

				If it&#039;s water soluble ... add 100ml of distilled water, let dissolve, mix well, and use an oral syringe to measure out 1ml (for 10mg).

				All the advice so far is exactly right: for accurate dosing of just 10mg, volumetric measuring is your best bet.&nbsp; Simply weighing out 10mg on most scales would be unwise, since the error of the scale could easily have you ingesting twice what you intended.<br /><br />I would get a moderately-priced milligram scale (measures in 0.001 grams), and measure out a medium portion of the gram, say 200mg (0.200g).&nbsp; Then, add this to an appropriate solvent (water or alcohol, depending on the chemical), and measure out the proper volume.&nbsp; I would use the ratio l1llykins suggested (10mg:1mL), as well as an oral syringe for measuring.<br /><br />So, using the above numbers, you would weigh out 200mg and dilute it in 20mL of solvent.&nbsp; To dose, draw out 1mL with a syringe, squirt it into a glass of your favorite juice, and enjoy!<br /><br />Save the other 800mg as a powder away from oxygen, light, and excessive heat (room temperature is usually okay, refrigerator is fine too) until you need it again.&nbsp; Many of these chemicals tend to be at least a bit more stable in the long-term if stored as a powder than in solution, assuming they&#039;re stored properly.
