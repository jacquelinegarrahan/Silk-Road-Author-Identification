				Hey guys!<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for reliable sleeping aids. I have a hard time falling asleep every night, takes me at least an hour, most of the time even longer, to fall asleep and I don&#039;t like that as the next day I either will sleep longer than I want to or I will be tired the whole day..<br /><br />Do you have any recommendations on substances or practices which can help? Preferably legal products, but any advice is well appreciated!<br /><br />I tried smoking weed and hash, but either I&#039;m really stoned and can sleep instantly but will oversleep the next day or I will just be high and don&#039;t get tired.<br />Kinda the same thing goes with alcohol, not really a big drinker, some beer once in a while, but that&#039;s it, didn&#039;t really help me either.<br /><br />Thanks for your help.

				Try, Valerian root or Passion flower extract, these work well for sleep.<br />Also If youre in the US, i know this sounds strange but.. get some Marleys Mellow Mood drink, and have it 10mins before you wanna go sleep. The US version contains extracts that make me feel very sleepy, including melatonin, Valerian root and passion flower. All good sleeping aids. <br />Outside the US, like me in the UK, the drink doesnt contain melatonin :(

				Thanks for your response gtgeorgz. I will give that a try.<br /><br />Sadly I live somewhere in western europe, so probably also no Marleys Mellow Mood drink for me.<br /><br />Just looked up the melatonin and you need a prescription for it in my country.

				wow you need a prescription for melatonin?<br />That&#039;s nuts.. you should be able to acquire it with relative ease.<br />melatonin will DEFINITELY put you out if you take enough of it<br /><br />Look up 5HTP (not a sleep aid but a serotonin precursor)<br />also Kava Kava will get you pretty drowsy

				Legal is a bit of a vague term (valium is perfectly legal is presribed), so i&#039;ll keep it to things available OTC in the US and most of europe:<br /><br />The most obvious and advertised choice is diphenhydramide (benadryl). This is a fairly old (but effective) antihistamine that makes you more drowsy compared to more modern ones (like cetirizine/zyrtec). The typical dose as a sleep aid is 50 mg. Its efficacy in terms of inducing sleep vary wildly between people. Some are out cold after a 25 mg dose, other are perfectly fine after 100 mg. Combining with alcohol increases the effect, but is advised against by the manufacturers - no specific risk of combination is cited or known though.<br /><br />Antihistamines may have side effects though. You could find yourself still feeling tired in the morning after taking them, and you could experience mild visual distortions, balance issues and ataxia. This side effects aren&#039;t that common, but you should be aware. <br /><br />Doxylamine is very similar to diphenhydramide and usually dosed at 25 mg, sold under the unisom brand name in some countries. <br /><br />Melatonin is something very different, and reports on that vary wildly. It&#039;s definitely not likely to put you to sleep by itself, but it seems to be somewhat useful for people that have a problem maintaining circadian rhythm or even mild jet lag. It has very little, if any, side effects, so its something you can experiment with at little risk. <br /><br />5-HTP is an interesting substance: it has been demonstrated to cross into the brain and be converted to serotonin, but clinical studies on its further effects are weak. There seems to be some evidence it&#039;s effective against depression in some conditions, but none of it being something that puts you to sleep. If you are on antidepressants like prozac (SSRI&#039;s), you should not take 5-HTP as it risks buildup of serotonin levels. This condition begins with heart palpitations, sweating, wide pupils and such, and is a serious situation that can escalate and sometimes result in death. Trying a single 200 mg dose of 5-HTP isn&#039;t going to kill you by a long shot, but if you take them over a long time combined with ssri&#039;s and/or mdma, you should know you are at risk. <br /><br />Unfortunately that more or less completes the list of viable non-prescription legal options. <br /><br />As glocks mentioned there could be another issue at hand. If you suffer from sleep apnea it is very important to know about that before you start taking sleep medication. Especially using benzo&#039;s and/or alcohol to fall a sleep is very dangerous if you suffer from apnea since your reflex to grasp for breath when oxygen levels reach a critical low will also be reduced. If you sleep with a partner ask them if you ever seem to be grasping for air during sleep. <br />

				Maintaining sleep is a different issue from inducing it.<br /><br />Things like diphenhydramide or benzo&#039;s may proof effective in putting you to sleep, and maintain sleep for quite some time too. You do require a certain amount of normal sleep with REM stages. Using any drug to pass out may compromise that sleep phase, often leaving you feeling miserable in the morning after a few nights. <br /><br />If you do wake up during the night despite taking substances hat induce sleep, consider a consult with your GP. Difficulty falling asleep are common, but difficulty maintaining sleep once you&#039;re out is nt.

				yeah it seems the US is the only place you can freely get Melatonin, plus tolerance is apparently a bitch on that stuff. Benzos work, I&#039;ve tried Xanax but i usually wake up feeling a lil drowsy, plus you need to get a prescription if you want it legally and its extremely addictive and the withdrawal can actually kill you&nbsp; :o

The condition is fairly rare though, but that doesnt mean you should not seek medical attention if you suspect it. Unfortunately my mother also suffers from it, and it resulted in all kinds of (mostly cardiovascular) problems before it was diagnosed. <br /><br />As far as the danger goes it should be taken seriously. Things that you would typically seek to help you sleep like benzo&#039;s, alcohol and especially a combination of both can cause dangerous respiratory depression in healthy persons, and this risk is severely aggravated if you suffer from a condition like sleep apnea.&nbsp;

I use it (I find the liquid forms work best for me) two to four nights a week, and I sleep great when I&#039;m on it. I find it works as well as 10mg of diazepam. Weird that it&#039;s prescription only in many other countries. For once the US is the place where you can get a reasonably powerful, probably harmless drug OTC.

You would stop breathing briefly, and resume grasping for air after a short while, or something similar to that. I think it would be a good reason to have it investigated further. Not remembering the episodes is perfectly normal, but that does by no means indicate they aren&#039;t dangerous.<br /><br />You may not suffer for a serious condition at all, but its worth figuring that out. Living with apnea in the long run can cause all kinds of problems, up to dangerously high blood pressure that is not controllable by the usual medications. <br /><br />Perhaps you just snore in a peculiar pattern that seems odd to others, but having that confirmed would be a relieve too i suppose.

				I&#039;m surprised that nobody has mentioned meditation. Historically I&#039;ve been one to lay in bed for up to a few hours waiting for sleep to come, but I find that about 20-30 minutes of a breath concentration practice before bed usually enables me to fall asleep in minutes. <br /><br />The style of meditation I refer to involves gently placing your attention on the breath at a single physical location (such as the tip of your nostrils or your upper lip), maintaining constant awareness of the breath, and returning your attention to the breath without judgement or analysis when you are distracted by thought. Don&#039;t try to control the breathing, although it&#039;s good to take a few intentional relaxed breaths to establish a pattern at the beginning of the sitting. Sit in a way that is comfortable for you (this means a chair for most westerners), as you don&#039;t want to struggle with your body when you&#039;re trying to relax before sleep.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve never meditated before it might take some time (couple weeks, couple months?) before this really works reliably, because your mind is going to resist being ignored. It&#039;s like a toddler in that way. But if you stick to the practice, eventually those psychological structures that keep you agitated will become de-energized, and you&#039;ll be able to repeat the procedure reliably.

				How about Diethyl Ether? As far as I know it is legal in most places? I believe you can drink it though I never have. As an inhalent it puts me right to sleep and I rarely wake up again. The downside of inhaling it is that your breath stinks the next day, but you feel very rested!

				Or chloroform for that matter. Side effect of that is that you will probably have the worst headache in your life if you wake up. <br /><br />Both were used as hypnotics in the past, but even controlling the dose such that it is sedating but not fatal is difficult to do for a medical practitioner as it is. Trying to self-administer these agents would in most cases prove to be either ineffective or fatal.

				naaaah chloroform is a level 2B carcinogen with a high level of toxicity, as far as I know ether is not particularly toxic in any sense, plus ether has a nice shallow dose/response curve so with a little common sense this would not be a problem.

				@bogben: just kidding ofcourse. I&#039;ve worked with chloroform enough to discover that the headache happens long before any sedative effects are noticeable, which is why its best handled in a fume hood.<br /><br />Etizolam may be a good drug if its easily available to you. In europe its not a commonly prescribed drug, but there is no reason to assume its less effective then any short acting true benzo. It&#039;s probably quite comparable to xanax at double the dose, and to nitrazepam (mogadon) at about 1/5th the dose. <br /><br />Substances like ambien (zolpidem) may also prove useful to induce sleep, despite not being benzodiazepines in the narrow sense. <br /><br />Things like melatonine are not effective though. Some people may claim so, but i can assure you taking a whole strip of those will not actually put your lights out. <br /><br />

Make sure you excersize a bit every day and get some Vitamin D, Before I go to bed I smoke a small cone of good Indica weed, do some deep breathing and I&#039;m fast asleep before I know it. I&#039;ve had insomnia for years and this has been my cure.

				I&#039;m sure someone already said this, but weed and diphenhydramine work great for me :)<br />1st Generation anithistamines make you drowsy as fuck, especially if you take more than 100mg. However, I WOULD NOT recommend this dosage for daily use. I occasionally use diphenhydramine to come down from an amphetamine binge if I don&#039;t have any benzos around &gt;.&lt;&nbsp; It certainly doesn&#039;t work as well as benzos, but it&#039;s better than nothing and you don&#039;t have to worry about the physical dependency issue that sometimes becomes a problem with benzos.<br /><br />Ultimately, these are all temporary fixes. I recommend that you visit your doctor and tell him you have problems with insomnia. He can give you a more permanent solution.

				I mentioned diphenhydramide before indeed. As far as fully legal, OTC, sleep aids go, i think its one of the best available. <br /><br />The downside is that they do have their side effects, including visual hallucinations, when taken in large doses. Combined with alcohol they are even more effective, but the side effects get more pronounced too. <br /><br />I need to take antihistamines for allergies in some situations, and i do prefer first generation ones taken before sleep. More modern antihistamines like cetirizine (zyrtec) don&#039;t cause as much drowsyness in most people while equally effective in controlling allergies. Taking larger amounts then recommended dosages still cause a rather unpleasant depressing effect though.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a downer i prefer benzo&#039;s over antihistamines, but perhaps mostly so due to lack of side effects and shorter duration of action. Having a couple of beers and a couple of benadryls may put you in for the night, but somehow you&#039;ll mostly regret that option the morning after ;)<br /><br />

				Just be careful with the perscription sleeping aides as they can be quite difficult to get off when you want too. Taper slowly.<br /><br />Right now, I tend to have a beer or two and 25 milligrams of dipenhydramine.. I have always responded very well to it though.

				I&#039;m not sure what country you are in but in the US there is a nutritional supplement that is legal called Phenibut. I believe it is a&nbsp; or has been used as a prescription. It is very closely related to GHB. It is listed as a hypnotic in the Merck Index. It acts similar to other GABA agonist and binds to the sedative GABA receptors it also binds to the GHB receptors. It is an anti anxiety mood enhancer and sleep aid. I highly recommend it. Its sleep aid effect are a very deep and natural sleep in which you don&#039;t feel sluggish when you wake up. When I first used it as a sleep aid, I slept through 5 alarms and was late for work but I was wide awake when I awoke. So make sure you have 8 hours to sleep and/or someone to wake you if you oversleep, lol. You may feel a slight Valium type buzz the first few times you use it but it goes away after a few uses (damn!). This Valium effect does not increase with dose. You build up a tolerance very quickly and then it levels off. The starting amount amount for the mood enhancing effects are 1-2 scoops 4 times a day. More truthfully it should be 4 scoops every 6 hours and your tolerance will build rather quickly to where it will level out at about 8 level scoops (1.5 grams). This is a lot but it is on par with the active dose of GHB which it very closely related to. At the 1.5 gram level the mood enhancing effects are very noticeable. For a sleep aid the dose is 2-8 scoops and you should start at the lower end to assess tolerance. Phenibut does act as a&nbsp; benzodiazepine drug at the higher doses and with that it does cause the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and it happens very quickly. So the bottle says to only use it 3 days in a row with a 3 day wash out which is very good advice. They do sell it it capsules but you will want the pure powder. It is commonly sold in 300 gram jars and I have found it from 25.00 to 35.00. I&#039;ve heard rumors of fake Phenibut being sold by nutritional stores. I don&#039;t know if I am allowed to give brand names on this forum, PM me if you want a reputable brand name.

The hyptnotic effect seems to very a lot between persons though - some people are knokced out from 2 beers and 50 mg diphenhydramide while other handle double that dose without apparent drowsiness at all. It doesn&#039;t seem to be a matter of tolerance alone either - the hypnotic effect doesn&#039;t seem to disappear for those sensitive to it. <br /><br />Personally i&#039;m not very sensitive to the hypnotic effects, but get side effects like visual hallucinations when taking larger doses. I take antihistamines for allergies sometimes, and combined with a few beers i&#039;ve had pretty odd (and unintended) side effects.

				Its still a precription-only drug, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />As i&#039;m in western europe i really do not care that much about the legal status of medications - i doubt anyone will make a fuss about possession of a few blisters of diazepam or alprazolan here, regardless if you can produce a prescription document or not. As long as its feasible that the amount is for personal use i really do not see the problem. These things may be different in the US however, i have no idea if it would be likely there to get in trouble when caught with a strip of valiums without a script there. <br /><br />Where &#039;natural&#039; alternatives like melatonin or herbal concoctions are concerned i really advise against spending any money on them. When you read the label on these products, there is probably a warning like &quot;This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.&quot; - which is simply means it was never demonstrated that it actually works. The product will (probably) still contain whatever is declared on the label, but if effectiveness cannot be shown in clinical trials, why bother with it?

				I have sworn by diphenhydramine for years.&nbsp; My sweet spot dosage is 75mg a couple hours before bed.&nbsp; It causes sluggishness in your movements and a feeling of fullness and pressure in the front half of your brain around the eyes especially, but underneath it there is a small feeling of euphoric relaxation.&nbsp; So the hour or so before I actually call it a night there is time to enjoy it.

You have to take it a few hours before you plan to sleep for it to really kick in, and you have to take more than the recommended dosage (I take 3g, but I don&#039;t recommend taking more because you might wake up in the middle of the night barfing you brains out). From my experience phenibut&nbsp; is definitely not placebo and definitely stronger than supplements like valerian, melatonin, etc. I get kind of high from it like GHB. The only thing is you can&#039;t use it every day. I use it at most every 2-3 days and I will also take breaks of a week or longer every now and again. And, like I said, high doses (or mixing with large amounts of alcohol) will leave you feeling verrry nauseous the next day. <br /><br />I get a container of 100g of phenibut powder for $26. If I take 3g each time that is $0.78/dose. Not too shabby.

				I have some seroquel tablets, given to me by a friend, but never ventured to take them. <br /><br />As i understand a dose like 50 mg should be reasonably hypnotic to someone not used to the drug, but i wonder what the benefit is compared to benzo&#039;s or even diphenhydramide. This is assuming only the hypnotic qualities are required and its not taken for any mental problem where the difference is quite clear, ofcourse.

				I&#039;ve never used it before, but i figured the effects would cause amnesia too, so i woulnd&#039;t prefer to use it when given another option. <br /><br />I suppose its one of those things i keep on hand in case badly needed, but don&#039;t regularly use. I usually take tramadol with me when i travel too, just in case i get injured to a point where &#039;regular&#039; pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen just doesn&#039;t cut it.
