				Paperchasing had personal life issues IIRC, and stopped due to them. I had good luck with HybridMike, but quite a few people said they were scammed by him. I got some of Tetravort&#039;s, and it was good, but it wasn&#039;t quite as good as the batch I got from HM before he was sort of shunned away for scamming.

				from personal experience - Tetravort. without a shadow of a doubt. i&#039;ve actually had coins sitting in my account for nearly 2 weeks now waiting for that sumbitch to show his face so i can get more off him. and i am CLUCKING.<br /><br />its expensive, i could probably get a g and a half from other vendors for one of his g&#039;s. but you have to pay for quality
