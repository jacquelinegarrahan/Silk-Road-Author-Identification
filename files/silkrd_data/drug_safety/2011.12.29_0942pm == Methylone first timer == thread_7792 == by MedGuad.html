				Ok so I picked up a vial of 350mg Methylone from a vendor here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done ecstasy in the past (about 9 years ago) but never pure MDMA.&nbsp; Methylone seemed like a good way to &#039;roll&#039; back into it.<br /><br />Do the same rules apply to Methylone as MDMA/X (juice up, stay dehydrated, etc...)?&nbsp; I&nbsp; had planned on only taking half of the vial now and half at a later date, but reading through the forums it seems most people suggest doubling what you would take if it was MDMA.&nbsp; How is the comedown?&nbsp; Any advice will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!

				I picked up a 200mg sample from DigitalInk a while back which was uber high quality methylone btw, and thought that was a perfect dose for me.<br />Reports vary&nbsp; from people saying 180-200mg is the sweet spot and anything above that does not increase euphoria/empathy feelings, only speediness and sweat.&nbsp; There are also reports of people going as high as 350 and having a grand ol&#039; time.<br />If I were you I would drink half since it has been 9 years since your last roll.<br />You definitely want to stay hydrated but I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about pre/post loading as you don&#039;t imbibe often.<br />The comedown from Digi&#039;s methylone was nice and easy with unassisted sleep about 5 hours after dosing.<br />Have a great time! :D

				...If I were U, I would get a nice sample of the real stuff. after 9 years of not rolling you will get a fucking good ride on 120-150mg.<br />If you wanna try the bk-MDMA first, just do 150-200 and half an hour later the rest.<br />It is quite nice, but there are some feelings I miss from real MDMA.<br /><br />Love &amp; Peace

				Thanks for all the info!&nbsp; <br /><br />So I dosed 175mg about 2.5 hours ago.&nbsp; Feeling euphoric but not ROLLING major.&nbsp; Feel good though and I have small waves of pleasure. Music is fun.&nbsp; Should I dose the rest or just save it?&nbsp; Would it be pointless at this point?<br /><br />Oh and what do you guys do about the taste?!?&nbsp; It was AWFUL.<br /><br />Thanks!!

				I believe that MDMA is a very fun drug and I would never buy methylone if MDMA was available.
