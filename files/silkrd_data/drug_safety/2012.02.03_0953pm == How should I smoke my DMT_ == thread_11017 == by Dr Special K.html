				Okay now I have a bowl. and I can easily get my hands on a bong. but I hear smoking it out of a &#039;Crack Pipe&#039; as people call it works good.<br /><br />Can anyone tell me how they smoke there DMT? <br /><br />I would like to smoke it out of a bong as that would be much easier for me to get than a &#039;Crack pipe&#039; lol<br /><br />Many thanks!

				I would suggest for a first time smoker:<br /><br />Use a normal pipe (which you might use for MJ), fill about 1/2 bowl with some inert herb: Parsley, or shake or something similar, or better yet some kind of nice herbal blend which tickles you right...<br /><br />Sprinkle the required amount of Deem powder lightly over this nice bed you just made.<br /><br />Use a match (!) not a lighter, and hold it as far above the bowl as possible... Lower it slowly while inhaling and stop when it gets close enough to melt the DMT without burning it!!! This is important, as you want to *vaporize*, NOT burn the DMT. This is the number one reason IMO that people fail to &#039;break though&#039; even after many tries. If your herbs are burning, it&#039;s too hot!<br /><br />Inhale slowly and deeply, for as long as possible. Hold it. Hold it...<br /><br />Keep holding it.<br /><br />Now, do it again.<br /><br />Three times... Each time, inhaling as long and slowly and evenly as possible!!!<br /><br />That&#039;s it. You&#039;re gone... or, HERE!<br /><br /><br />** Bonus Tips **<br />-Don&#039;t use your &#039;everyday&#039; pipe... People have been known to load a bowl the next day or weeks later and get some very unexpected bonus.<br />-Enlist a close friend to help. When you succeed you will be very happy someone was there to grab the pipe from your hand...<br />-Light a candle to light your matches from, and put a glass of water next to where you are sitting to drop the match into after. Less to worry about.

				^ lol at not using same bowl. I love surprizes haha :p. A bong is also very good. put a small amount of bubble hash at the bottom and fill that bowl up pretty good. Then put a light pretty high above the bowl and keep on going till its all vaporized. And take it ALL in one hit. IT WILL ROCK YOU haha.<br /><br />THe bubble hash makes smoking dmt really easy because of its slightly solid/bubbly texture. Out of body everytime fosho fosho with only 40mg(maybe 50 :p)<br /><br />Idk though, I make my own and smoke my own haha. No scale. Just try out a decent amount and see what happens :D

				Build The Machine. It&#039;s thought to be the best way to smoke DMT.<br /><br />1. Get an empty alcohol bottle.<br />2. Drill/file a hole in the bottom.<br />3. Get brillo or other metal mesh and burn the coating off.<br />4. Fit it into the neck of the bottle so that its tight but not blocking air flow. <br />5. Put the dmt on top of that and heat the sides of the neck of the bottle to melt the DMT into the mesh and let it cool.<br />6. Flip it around and apply the flame to the mesh while inhaling from the hole.<br /><br />

				Crack pipe type pieces will work, I&#039;ve used one called the Ubie. But with larger doses I find that the melted DMT can be somewhat messy. I&#039;d recommend a bong/bubbler, but a regular pipe will work too. It&#039;ll help to put multiple screens in the bowl to help stop the melted DMT from falling through into the piece. I&#039;ll usually leave a bit of ash on top of the screens and then lay the DMT directly on top. Laying it on weed always seems to alter the trip for me a bit, but it&#039;s a bit easier to smoke that way and the trips tend to be more strange.<br /><br />Tagore left some great tips though and highlighted the most important. Keep the lighter a couple inches away and instead of letting the flame burn the DMT, let the heat vaporize the DMT. <br /><br />I also find it helpful to slow my breathing before hitting it, but make sure that once you inhale you hold it for 15+ seconds. I count to 15, then keep holding it in longer w/out counting, then exhale. I usually feel an electric tingling sensation rising up from the bottom of my body to the tip of my head as I hold it in longer and longer.<br /><br />

				Crack Pipes easily burn the DMT lowering the amount you actually get into your body<br /><br />Glass pipes or Glass pieces in general are not advised - DMT sticks to glass once liquified and it is difficult to actually get the full dosage you are expecting due to this<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You want a wooden pipe.&nbsp; Any type will do, i suggest just a functional cheap one I paid about 7 bucks for my wooden D pipe and its very trippy/colorful and does the job fine.&nbsp; Now you can either do it one or two ways:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Put a metal screen down.&nbsp; Take a cigarette or similar tobacco product and smoke/burn it, put the ash in the bowl on top of the screen(about half a cigarette&#039;s worth of ash).&nbsp; Now take your finger and pat the ash down into a little &quot;pillar&quot; shape; this is where the DMT will go, on top of this pillar.&nbsp; DO NOT PACK THE ASH DOWN ALL THE WAY, IT WILL CLOG THE PIPE.&nbsp; Just enough to make a pillar down inside the bowl.&nbsp; Take the D and put it on the pillar, take your lighter and when you hit D you never want the flame to touch it; you want to vaporize the DMT.&nbsp; Take your time with it and dont rush things and you will get the correct dosage you planned out.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Instead of using ash, you can use a bunch of metal screens all on top of each other, and then use the same smoking method as above.&nbsp; Just load the D in the middle of the screens and blast off.&nbsp; I do not advise marijuana to be used at any point near or during the trip - it tends to cloud the mind slightly.<br /><br />Another great way, my personal favorite actually is by Volcano Vaporizer.&nbsp; You just need to do a quick google search and find the right temperature setting so it doesnt destroy the deemster. <br /><br />Have fun.

				I just smoked my DMT out of a bong. by the time I exhaled my 2nd hit I felt it. then I hit it again and about mid hit it ROCKED ME. I had some scary visuals and some very odd ones. but with all the drugs ive fooled around with I have learned to calm myself down. it was a little harder on DMT because I was a little sketched out at first. but after tripping I have nothing to be afraid of. I still feel very euphoric. Thank you guys. DMT is a trip forsure!

Gotta go for that 3rd hit, even if it seems impossible at the time! You won&#039;t regret it.<br /><br />When you really break through there&#039;s no &#039;calming yourself down&#039; or coming back until the DMT says it&#039;s time. :o

The regular size ones, like 4-5 inches tall.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think a tabasco is too small. If I remember correctly, &quot;The Machine&quot; is made out of one of those airplane sized shot bottles you can pick them up for a couple bucks.<br /><br />As for a freebase pipe, I&#039;ve used one and it works great. The tricky part is that you will get DMT resin coated on the inside of the glass if you don&#039;t smoke it quick enough. Possibly losing some of the initial dosage with this, but I still blast off quite far compared pipes. I love scraping the DMT resin out though, it turns to a tannish brown which smokes for a different trip imo. Much more strange when I trip off of the resin. Saw a self-transforming McDonalds bench, which was beautiful but entirely unexpected to see on a breakthrough, that ended up finally changing into a being with huge lips and when I felt her (it, etc.) touch me with her lips it was orgasmic. Great fun on the trip but had me questioning McDonalds afterwards.<br /><br />I still feel a bong with a small amount of water is the best though. I feel it is key to hold in each hit for 15-20 seconds and a bong will give you the ability to take in the most in the shortest time. I&#039;m usually tripping too hard to count by the time I&#039;m taking hit number 3 or 4, which is good because the next thing I know I&#039;ve had a breakthrough.

				The atomizer bridge in most e-cigs doesn&#039;t get much hotter than the melting point of DMT freebase, and the element is just about at the exact temperature of the freebase boiling point in most models.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t you be able to create a suspension, drop it in an e-cig, and vape away?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t use DMT.&nbsp; Maybe build a vaporizer for DMT using a an old ATX PSU, a Peltier, and a microcontroller with a thermistor and variac to control the temp?&nbsp; Or just nichrome...
