				Not that I&#039;m permitted to suicide, since I have friends who rely on me, but how much downer does it actually take to make me not wake up ever again?<br /><br />Thank you for your input.

				Im not doctor, but it would all depend on your weight,&nbsp; what you took,&nbsp; what you took it with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I have taken enough xanax to choke a super goku ape and still have a heartbeat.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I think you could google how much **** is overdose level and get a better answer.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Either way,&nbsp; I hope you or I never find out first hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Mixing downers and alcohol seems the best way to actually be dead.<br />I dont know about barbs, but i do know comitting suicide on only benzo&#039;s requires alot higher doses then one would suspect.

				Ahh you must not be from the good ole USA then. Hank Williams was a popular country singer in the late 40&#039;s early 50&#039;s. Like many hillbilly singers of his time,&nbsp; he was an abuser of various barbs, alcohol and morphine/downers. <br /><br />He reportedly had been injected with vitamin B-12 and a half-grain of morphine by doctors to ease severe back pain caused by spina bifida occulta. Little did the medical personnel know, Williams also consumed an unknown amount of Chloral Hydrate, morphine and various painkillers on a regular basis. Additionally, he was a pretty bad alcoholic and at the autopsy of his body, doctors determined he was drunk.<br /><br />To answer your question more directly, I have no idea, but it would be fairly easy to combine said barbiturates with other substances like morphine and alcohol, to achieve heart failure.

Pancuronium, is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (a paralytic agent) that blocks the action of acetylcholine at the motor end-plate of the neuromuscular junction. Binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the end-plate causes depolarization and contraction of the muscle fiber; non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents like pancuronium stop this binding from taking place. <br /><br />then 100 mEq (milliequivalents) of potassium chloride is administered to stop the heart.

Obviously taking such doses is very dangerous for all kinds of reasons. But when push comes to shove the type of suicide-by-pills as portrayed in movies and such i actually not that realistic. <br /><br />I&#039;m certainly not going to try it myself, but i would not be totally surprised if someone took something like 30 mg of alrazolam and surviced that ordeal, especially in a hostpital setting where ventilation and such are available.&nbsp;
