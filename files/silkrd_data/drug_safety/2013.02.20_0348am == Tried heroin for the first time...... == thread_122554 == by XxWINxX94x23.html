				and it was an incredibly shitty experience that really let me down!<br /><br />Snorted maybe about 25mg, probably the equivalent of 2 or 3 bumps all in one. After about 5-10 minutes I felt a little warm inside but it progressively got worse. I started to feel a little dizzy, disorientated and actually pretty sick. Started sweating a little and getting restless. Couldn&#039;t really sit still or focus on anything, just kept pacing around feeling kinda fucked up, but not in a good way. I ended up puking about 30 minutes after I snorted it and felt a lot better after that. I still remained very drowsy, tired, weak and fell asleep about an hour and a half later.<br /><br />Granted, I am an amateur to this drug, but could someone maybe explain why this happened? Is it like the first time you smoke weed? Maybe I took too much, too little (I don&#039;t think this is the case)? Unfortunately I was expecting a warm/fuzzy relaxed high that I could just sit here and feel good, but what I got was quite the contrary. The dope I used is supposedly pretty good, as I&#039;m sure all those people on deluxedelivery&#039;s page aren&#039;t lying.<br /><br />Would any more-experienced member care to enlighten me on my negative experience? It&#039;s really changed my opinion on the drug and I&#039;m normally a pretty open person.<br /><br />Thanks!

				You could have taken too much for sure.&nbsp; It could have been a diphenhydramine cut?&nbsp; &nbsp; Some people just get sick off dope and never touch it again.<br /><br /><br />I have been using dope on and off for 13 years, and some of those bags from DD got me fucked up big time.&nbsp; So who knows.

				do you have any opiate tolerance?<br />&nbsp;25 mg is way too much if you got no tolerance. try like 5-10 first and work your way up. <br />if you don&#039;t get the feeling you want you should just flush it. it could be cut with bad shit. or maybe the problem is you. people can react differently to it...

				did too much and heroin starts to get good after you do it for more than 3 days straight. It can be done recreationally but you won&#039;t know what it&#039;s all about unless you get yourself addicted to it.

				Usually every throws up the first time. Shit&nbsp; I have a decent tolerance and if I shoot to much I throw up everywhere. I have&nbsp; got some stuff off of here that made me throw up off 50mg injecting, and that&#039;s with a long time tolerance, so 25m snorted first time user with quality could def do it. Also to the one guy just cause he chucked doesn&#039;t mean its cut, plenty of people chuck of pills also. There is just a f line sometimes between feels good and feels bad lol.

				that&#039;s pretty much my experience as well, minus the puking. Sweaty. Itchy as all hell. Warm but not in a great way. Nausea. No longer give a shit about anything much - true - but don&#039;t feel amazing either.<br /><br />Next day or two, back to normal mentally but my body felt like it had the flu. Felt mild desire to do more, just to make that shitty feeling go away.<br /><br />Like smoking tobacco I&#039;m sure if I apply myself to the habit I can find space for a relationship with H, but it wasn&#039;t for me I prefer drugs you can have a one night stand with, not the ones you have to marry.

				Ok I think I&#039;m beginning to understand. A body probably has to adjust to the drug before you receive something other than unpleasant effects. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be doing it any more than 1 day in a row, I really don&#039;t need to get hooked on anything! Will maybe give it another shot sometime soon when the time is right.<br /><br />Thanks again for the input everyone.

				I hate to be a downer or come off judgemental, I&#039;m not an opiate user so I very&nbsp; likely just don&#039;t get it. I&#039;m a psychedelic kind of guy. But just to be the voice of reason, maybe don&#039;t fuck around with heroin? Just saying.<br /><br />When you think of most drugs....I like to think, would the average user of this drug think other people should follow there path and use?&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; most pot smokers I know would recommend smoking marijuana.&nbsp; As an advocate of LSD, I think its something people should try. Does the average heroin user recommend his friends/family and peers should perhaps try some heroin.?...Ill for now ignorantly assume not. I only aim to help.

I&#039;ve got a pretty long checklist of substances I&#039;ve done, want to do, and don&#039;t even know about yet. Heroin was one of the last &quot;big ones&quot; on my list. Doing it is for trial purposes only, and have no intentions of developing any kind of habit with it, or any other substance for that matter. Just checking off the long list, and, with the help of Silk Road, has made the checking go alot faster and even adding more items to the list. If you catch my drift.
