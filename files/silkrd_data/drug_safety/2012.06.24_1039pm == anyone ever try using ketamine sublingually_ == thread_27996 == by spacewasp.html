				I would check around erowid but I personally don&#039;t enjoy snorting anything so when I took MXE I dosed sublingually... Ketamine should be the same although when I tell people that they give me a really weird look haha...&nbsp; I think the dosage is sightly higher sublingually then if insuffulated but research that instead of taking my word...<br /><br />Cheers :)

				i took 30mg sublingually the other night and all i felt were the sedative effects and none of the psychedelic effects.&nbsp; seems that MXE is better for sublingual use, but i could have just been having a weird night.&nbsp; not sure I want to use any more of my precious ketamine in this experiment though

				I have always been taking it orally, not sublingually but rubbing it on my gums.<br />Entered the K-hole the very first time because I was using way too much.<br />contrary to my fore-poster it works for me with K but not with MXE, I need to take about 3-4 times as much MXE as K to get a similar experience.<br /><br />Also consider the extremely rapidly building tolerance with K, If you use it daily for a week you will probably need at least twice the amount at the end of the week.

				I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;d want to take ketamine sublingually, personally I love snorting it, and failing that it&#039;s good in a drink too.<br /><br />I know for a fact that orally in a drink you are supposed to use double the dose, so for example whereas I would take 80mg snorting, if I drink it I will take 160mg orally to get the same effect. It seems Erowid confirms this on their dosing page.<br /><br />I should point out that the effects of taking ketamine nasally by snorting and orally by drinking are very different for me and many other people I know. When snorted I get a mental high with minimal physical effects, whereas when drank I get a physical high almost like being paralyzed but still remain mentally quite sharp. Just an observation...
