				Hello everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some 6-APB in 60mg capsules that I would like to get rid of at the next upcoming music event. The product is legit 6-APB, has been tested by me at various doses, works, is good, etc.<br /><br />Now are there any objections to selling 6-APB as ecstasy? After all, it is a roll, with a slightly hallucinogenic/trippy twist to it. Being an analogue of MDA, I feel this would be great for fellow concert-goers.<br /><br />Any opinions? I know that selling it as MDMA would be wrong, but I don&#039;t see too much business asking &quot;You looking for 6-APB!?&quot;<br /><br />Looking for some opinions, as this stuff is just sitting around and could be $ in my pocket.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I really hate when people selling pills or caps as ecstasy when there is not a bit in it!<br />No matter if it is a good roll it&#039;s not really right to say it&#039;s X.<br /><br />With that being said must people at music event could not give a shit what they are taking as long as it is a buzz.<br />I guess it&#039;s really up to you as to what you want to do with it.<br /><br />If I was trying to sell some thing like this I would ring a few mates who know there drugs and offer it to them saying exactly what it was.

				Well I suppose half the issue is that I&#039;m not looking to distribute at this event but rather try to get rid of what I already have, because it does have value, to the right person.<br /><br />I will probably just market it as a trippy roll and if they actually want more info I&#039;ll tell them its 6-apb and hopefully they are still interested.

				If you want to be a reputable dealer, never sell somehting as something else.<br /><br />You may get away with it once or twice on the streets, but if your customers find out, your reputation is lost forever.<br /><br />This doesnt mean you cannot sell it though. Just be honest about it - if it gives as nuch or more bang for the buck your clients will be pleased.

				There&#039;s very little known about the safety profile of 6-APB.&nbsp; There are no studies on the effects of this drug. Therefore, it would be wrong to sell it as anything other than 6-APB.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I were you, I would sell it on Silkroad as 6-APB.

				And not only on SR, but in general.<br /><br />The chances of getting caught selling something counterfeit are larger on SR, but you should principally never do that. <br /><br />It may seem trivial to sell something with a similar effect for something more valuable, but this can backfire. Consider the situation of a user taking an overdose and seeking medical treatment after. The best course of treatment can differ between substances that have similar effects, and if someone is treated for an overdose of mdma while the actual culprit is 6-apb, that can result in complications. <br /><br />Perhaps this may seem far fetched, but would you even consider risking your clients life by telling such a lie? You can sell something as &#039;equally effective&#039; or &#039;similar&#039;, which is all fine if that is the case, but never make someone think they are using a different substance than they actually are.

				Ok cool thanks for the advice everyone.<br /><br />I will most likely just market it as &quot;like MDA&quot; and if people start asking specifics I&#039;ll be honest. Hopefully these sell quick looking to make around $50 for all the capsules I have gonna do like 2 for $20 and tell them to play it by ear, they are 60mg caps by the way.<br /><br />

				Never ever sell a drug under the disguise of another drug...that&#039;s how overdoses and bad interactions happen...when people expect to feel a certain way and they don&#039;t they end up taking more or taking another drug that is contraindicated with the drug they just took...<br /><br />Just make up a clever street name for it and tell them it&#039;s something new that feels like MDMA but it&#039;s not....<br /><br />Tell them that it&#039;s Holly...like Molly&#039;s cousin Holly...

I haven&#039;t been able to find any studies on the effects of this drug.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;:D<br /><br />Being that the drug is only about 3 years old, no professional studies have been done. The line of drugs prioritized to be put into clinical trials or laboratory studies, is a long one. However, a drug-study is merely an examination of the body and mind, health and function on a drug that virtually nothing is known about. I know, because I have been paid to do them in the past.. plenty of smart, and willing soldiers have stepped into the line of fire for drugs like 6-APB outside of a lab setting, however. And while there isn&#039;t a whole lot of official data out there on the web, there are definitely plenty of communicated &quot;experiences&quot; and the general effects and side effects are known. <br /><br />Not much study has been brought to 5-APB and 6-APB because they&#039;re simply analogues of a well known drug. And they themselves are designer-drugs, created for the sole purposes of evading the law. As long as you educate yourself on others experiences and know your own body it should not be too hard to make a decision on whether a drug is right for you, or not. My point is that no drug is risk-free the first time one puts it in their body. But once a large number of people do? And live to tell about it... a study, in one form or another, has been conducted.<br /><br />Here are some clearnet links that you can use to get educated on the effects of 6-APB: <br /><br />http://knborganics.com/6-apb_educational_primer.html<br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_6APB.shtml<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=6-APB<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So you are in agreement with me that there are no studies on the effects of this drug.
