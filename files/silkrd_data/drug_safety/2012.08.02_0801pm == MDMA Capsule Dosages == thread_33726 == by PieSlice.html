				Just a quick curiosity for those that fill MDMA purchased from SR into capsules: how do you typically dose your caps? I was thinking 100mg would be ideal (as I rolled hard off 100mg weighing at 80kg), but I&#039;m interested in knowing SR&#039;s dosages. Thanks!

				I hate selling caps for people that just want .1. More risk as theres so many more sales.<br />Buy large caps and fill them to .5 and make people buy .5 or 1g. Wont work if you dont have a monopoly, but honestly, you probably have a monopoly on pure mdma in your area.

				I&#039;m selling the caps to very few individuals who will then resell them themselves (festival coming up). I refuse to branch out to random people and I&#039;m very cautious about it as well. I&#039;m the source with three intermediates. The consumer does not reach me. The thing is I am the only one that owns a proper scale, gelatin capsules, intricate knowledge of dosing, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;Honestly, these kids don&#039;t know much about the Shulgin scale nor do they seem to give a shit. They&#039;re idiotic enough to redose a full sized cap T+3:00 expecting to prolong their roll. What I&#039;m honestly worried about them underestimating the purity and dropping 3 of the capsules at once, thinking they can take the blunt of it because they&#039;re &quot;experienced&quot;. While I suppose that&#039;s not my problem, I still want the end user to have a good time.

				For one of my future events I will be getting powder to put into caps. My motto for the stuff I provide is &quot;A Fully Customizable Experience&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be filling caps of varying sizes. Since SR stuff is about 80% pure, you could do it like I will by filling:<br /><br />175mg Big Boy Bombs for people 80kg and above and those who want to fly hard.<br />125mg Rock &#039;n&#039; Rollins for anyone interested in having a good, manageable time<br />100mg Loving Ladies for smaller people under 60kg and women<br />50mg In Flight Meals as boosters<br /><br />It would be easy enough to set prices based on the dosage amount. It&#039;ll be a pain to individually measure out this many types of doses, but I think the customer service that will be felt from such care and thought makes up for it. Charge a little more :)<br />

				I do &quot;one size fits all&quot;&nbsp; 140MG.&nbsp; I myself, I take one of these, followed by a 70MG booster about 30mins-1 hour later, and another hour later I do about another 70mg, but I am a veteran.&nbsp; I have been giving people 140mg, all different types and sizes of people, skinny girls, big guys etc.&nbsp; Some need 1, some need two, never had someone say they got sick on 140mg, it is a standard dose.&nbsp; I tell people to buy two to be safe if they have a high tolerance, and open the capsule, split it in half with a buddy or something.&nbsp; Some people I know put them in their drinks, some swallow the capsule etc.&nbsp; But I have done this to 100+ people and no complaints, just people loving me&nbsp; 8)

				People in my area really wanted some 200mg capsules, so I decided to sell them for a little bit to see if it was worth my while. A few people believed me and loved them, and some stupid kids assumed I was selling the usual 75mg cut with filler powder and took several at a rave. They got pretty sick but ended up okay, and then tried to blame me for having a bad time. Fuck that shit, kids are stupid. Selling crystals or powder is the way to go so people can decide the dose themselves.

				120mg then an 100mg boost. The boost feels more like a rocket though&nbsp; :D

				I dosed up a couple of Ivory&#039;s grams into some vegetable based AA size caps the other day.<br />They look so sweet! I like buying caps as small as I can, then putting a nice moderate to hefty dose in each.<br />I&#039;ve chosen 150 mg to be my sweet spot with a low to medium tolerance. This is the tolerance to the drug I wish to maintain by spacing rolls at least a few months apart.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think, when deciding what dosage your caps should be, if you do want them all one dosage, you just need to follow your heart!&nbsp; Trust in your perfect experience, and trust in that when you sell one to a friend, you&#039;re giving the closest thing to that!&nbsp; Plus, I kinda like thinking I have a lesser amount of stronger caps than a greater amount of weaker caps.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sidenote: can&#039;t wait to mix 3Jane&#039;s MDA and Ivory&#039;s MDMA some night soon!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been sitting on Ivory&#039;s for a while now, have shown more self control than I ever thought I would have - considering the rave reviews and the fact I still haven&#039;t tried it.&nbsp;
