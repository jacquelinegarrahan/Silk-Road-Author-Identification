				Once suspect substance would be atropine. In the nehterlands there have been several incidents of cocaine cut&nbsp; with atropine, which would result in the effects you describe to some degree.<br /><br />Atropine will actually inhibit sweating to some point, but you may feel the sensation of overheating and break into sweat at some point beyond an initial small dose. If you experience this you need to be very weary as in many cases relatively small doses of atropine (about half a gram) can be fatal.

				thanks Ben,<br /><br />bought stuff from 3-4 different retail guys and noticed the same thing - got to do almost 0.5g in an hour to get some weak buzz and then some real nasty sweating sets in, apparently mephedrone could cause that kind of effects.<br /><br />since i&#039;ve never intentionally used speed, meth, molly etc, just trying to figure it out.

				Mephedrone is a bit sweaty, and the only time I feel myself getting overheated on coke is with shitty stuff. I don&#039;t think they use meph as a cut but whatever it is it&#039;s definitely more sweaty than coke itself.

				no idea what it is, but got that kind of a side effect from 3-4 different retail guys and it was supposedly &quot;cocaine&quot;<br /><br />was some weak short lasting buzz followed buy hot flashes and sweating, freaking dangerous i think<br /><br />what i could find on the web was that some &quot;club drugs&quot; could cause increased temperature, freaking nasty feeling
