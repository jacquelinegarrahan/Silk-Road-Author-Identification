				I&#039;ve only done it once, it was on the comedown from my last mdma trip. My friend had done it the week before (just 2cb alone) and had a lot of cool visuals. However neither of us got any visuals, I&#039;m assuming the mdma overpowered the 2cb. On the positive side I did feel much better in the morning then normally after taking e. I&#039;m definitely anxious to try it solo sometime. Maybe tomorrow!

(Full disclosure: the 2c-b in the Grand Wizard&#039;s Lair comes from Mahakala).&nbsp; &nbsp;I find it to be an entirely pleasant experience with a warm fuzzy body feel and a nicely trippy but not too intense headspace.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t find it as visual as 2c-b or 2c-t-7, I&#039;ve definitely had some great CEVs and OEVs on 2c-b. <br /><br />20mg oral should be a fine first dose.&nbsp; I&#039;d try it sober for your first experience just to get a feel for the substance.&nbsp; But a dose of 2c-b coming down from MDMA has been highly recommended by none other than Alexander Shulgin himself... so that should be a good situation.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be too worried about your girlfriend freaking out on 20mg, but if you are concerned you could give her a lesser amount i.e. 1/2 or 2/3 of a capsule. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30489.msg341105#msg341105">Quote from: tonedef on July 12, 2012, 06:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i am thinking of letting two people (guy/girl) let this be their first experience &#039;tripping&#039; (well the visual part)<br />they only know mdma! <br />is this a good idea?&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d say 2c-b is the most gentle and benevolent of the phenethylamines and should be an excellent introduction for people who already have some experience with Molly.

				I know these guys who sniffed 70MGs of 2C-B by accident the first time they tried it and still love 2C-B. For me 2C-B has entirely replaced MDMA. No come-down. No hangover the next day. Plus: awesome visuals.<br /><br />Try plugging it. You will never go back.

				I got 20mg caps from Mahakala. <br /><br />They were very good, I took one sober last night and wow. Much nicer than molly, bit of nausea on the come up, but clear head space. Visuals were great I just sat on my balcony watching the clouds, sun and leaves.<br /><br />I live in the attic space of a house, below me are a family with 2 three year old twin girls. They saw me and laughed and kept shouting &quot;monsieur ,monsieur ,monsieur &quot; I live in a frenchspeaking country. I had a conversation with them and their grandparents, and my French is rubbish. I was able to focus on chatting without too many problems. This was still fairly early on in the trip. <br /><br />Music was just sublime, listening to anything with lots of layers in it Shpongle etc was out of this world. I turned on the visualizer for iTunes and got lost in that for 30 minutes.<br /><br />No comedown, no hangover.<br /><br />The only down side is I really wanted to have sex with my missus, but A she wasn&#039;t in and B she is not into drug taking anymore. Apparently&nbsp; we have to stop once we reach our 30&#039;s&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I would say take a lowish dose, sober, be in a comfortable space. You will have a blast, not saying that you will get the same effects as me. But don&#039;t hang out too near the threshold dose, I find that uncomfortable, all the come up effects without the benefits.

I like it but on the comedown I realized why I stopped taking it. Weed makes it easier but I still feel shit and crashed out.<br /><br />Plugging is something I am thinking about. I thought about doing a 20% Isopropyl alcohol/water solution at 1-1 (50mg to 50ml) then starting out with 10ml. Sound like a plan?

				No need for alcohol. 2C-B HCL will disolve in plain water. It will take some stirring but it will disolve. 2C-B HBr will almost instantly disolve. It is slightly less potent by weight though.

				so me and my buddy dropped 20mg yesterday<br /><br /><br />it was so fucking relaxing and pleasant...slight visual..cool breathing but a very uplifting feeling....intense giggles and a very carousel like up and down of it coming back and forth.....1st hour was hilariously hard to walk..then it was VERY controllable.<br /><br />i was soo close to snorting another 10mg....and i kept saying we should maybe add 5mg or 10mg more next trip..but again, VERY relaxing and fun. <br /><br />i hope that is kinda what people expect?&nbsp; let me know..definently going to do it again soon...any input on spacing this drug? harms? etc?<br /><br />thanks guys<br />

				I took 20Mg last night, up from the 15mg I did first time round. <br /><br />Wow what a fucking drug.<br /><br />We popped around 4 in the afternoon, left work and went into the center of the city. Slight visuals but great feeling of connectedness with all around me. But especially my mate, we were like fucking the borg. It felt like my forehead was trying to break out of my skull though. So much extra cognitive ability. I could take everything in and assess exactly what I needed to say to someone to keep them engaged in conversation.<br /><br />We took a hit of weed about 2hours in and that took it to another level again. Colours so bright and clear, food tasted great!<br /><br />On the metro home I started listening to Shpongle on my ipod. That was mind blowing and another wave hit me.<br /><br />Would like to do some more to get better visuals. How long should I wait now, is tolerance a big thing with 2C-B?&nbsp;

				Looking to try 2C-B for the first time soon. Plan is to combine with MDMA and as suggested take the 2C-B at the tail end of the MDMA.<br /><br />What i am hoping to achieve i guess is taking things to another place and hopefully feeling a heighten body experience. Getting euphoria, added emotional connectivity and a sexual intimacy with the wife is what i am looking for. Being able to explore each other and connect and converse on another level. Being able to have a clearer mind as well.<br /><br />From reading about 2C-B on erowid and looking at the effects and description, that is exactly what i hope for. Never done any form of a psychedelic before and not after anything to extreme, just some mild visuals would be nice. Brighter colours etc.<br /><br />Thinking of maybe a 10mg dose would be good for starters, what would you guys think ? Being a first time using this drug do you think i could achieve what i want out off it ?<br /><br />Should i have any other concerns or take any precautions ? Appreciate the help&nbsp; :D<br /><br />

				I have had about ten trips on Ivory&#039;s 2cb to date, having never had any prior experience with the substance before SR.&nbsp; All I can say is, what a wonder it is!&nbsp; To think a drug could be so many things in one, with relatively few negative side effects when dosed appropriately. <br /><br />Last weekend I had my best 2cb trip to date.&nbsp; I took around 40mg with 4 friends and just hung out in a suburban park at midnight.&nbsp; Out of all my trips so far, my favourite ones are the higher dosed ones (30mg at least).&nbsp; When I dose higher the visuals increase greatly in strength and clarity. There&#039;s lots of slow-motion frame effect on moving things like trees, curtains etc.&nbsp; Also, I love the whirling colour impressions of pink and green hues, especially when the wind blew at night!&nbsp; Also, the other night when we were in a park staring into the moon-lit clouds, a fully realised illustration of a highly detailed oil-painting jumped out at me.&nbsp; Kind of like seeing mayan symbols on my bathroom wall on 25i.... except up until this point I didn&#039;t think 2cb was capable of that extra depth.&nbsp; It continues to delight and surprise me.<br /><br />As for how much I would recommend newcomers dose, it really all comes down to your comfort level with new things.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve gotten as far as being on SR, I would take a guess and say that you&#039;re probably good to at least dose 30mg straight up (obviously this doesn&#039;t apply to everyone), as 2cb certainly is most forgiving (of 2c&#039;s anyway).&nbsp; I have never insufflated 2cb however, not sure I really want to either... Snorting mdma is bad enough for me! lol<br /><br />Whereas on low dose 2cb I can stare at a greek cyclops mythology painting on wikipedia and space out and see the picture expand and shrink, while feeling a nice body high, I don&#039;t experience more than this on a low dose.<br /><br />Ogg^^^ If I were you I would do it the first time by itself.&nbsp; That way you get a chance to space molly use out, and honestly 2cb is so much in itself that I would want to experience it by itself first.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to try this combination, but everyone says it&#039;s legendary!&nbsp; I would just advise you do the 2cb by itself, and dose a bit higher and I&#039;m sure you wont be disappointed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had up to 45ish mg, and not once did I feel overly confused, or like things could get scary at all.&nbsp; But hey, everyone&#039;s different.

				this was bought from mahakala<br /><br /><br />i only snorted half the capsule had a mild anxiety inducing rush...controllable due to my buddy who kept me cool..lasted bought 5-10minutes then i was soaring from the blast off...good thing was it didnt last as long as oral..but i know for a fact orally is the way to go<br /><br />but again, being so clear, and smoking DMT (Changa) on it was SO. FUCKING. INCREDIBLE.<br /><br /><br />i had my body lifted, entering a bright city, i replied to the creature &quot;yes..take me&quot; and all i saw and felt was so indescribable that as i was coming back i kept saying (or yelling ) &quot;i wont remember! i wont remember this! my body cant take this in&quot;<br /><br />opening my eyes, my sister said i did not move or say a thing....and that was my breakthrough. beautifully incomprehensible

Then go for the 15-20mg range, I like to start low on new drugs. But hanging out around threshold levels is never comfortable for me. <br /><br />Up to you though to gauge unemotionally where you think your limit is. I found the body load on 20mg to be overwhelming in terms of the intensity sometimes, lucky that it came in waves. But I need to up the dose to get to a level where I get decent visuals with the headspace.<br /><br />Still plugging next, too much of a wimp to inhale it.<br /><br />

				Alright so perhaps i take the advice and maybe try this drug on it&#039;s own first, maybe 15mg just to sus things out.<br /><br />Will keep reading this thread and read up on other trip reports but so far from what i hear 2C-B could become a wonderful experience&nbsp; :)

I think I sent one of those along as well. I&#039;m trying to get more feedback on the t-7.&nbsp; Personally I like it a lot - it&#039;s got the best visuals of any 2c-* I&#039;ve tried to date. But it&#039;s a lot less forgiving than 2c-b dosage-wise and a lot more idiosyncratic.&nbsp; (Some people will get incapacitated off a 10mg oral dose of t-7 while others will barely feel 50).&nbsp; And it mixes very poorly with MDMA and can kill you if you snort it, so I can see why it has a limited market. But I can also see why Shulgin named it and 2c-b among the &quot;magical half dozen.&quot;

				To all who has taken 2c-b after the mdma peak is winding down, can i ask...<br /><br />What differences have you felt as opposed to taking it on it&#039;s own ? And have you found you needed to take more or the same dose when combining than opposed to on it&#039;s own ?
