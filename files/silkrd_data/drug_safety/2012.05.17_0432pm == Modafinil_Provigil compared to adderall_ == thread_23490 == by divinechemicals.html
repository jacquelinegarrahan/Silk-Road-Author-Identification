				I&#039;ve taken 30mg XR adderall before. I see that Modafinil (200mg) is sold on SR, so I&#039;m wondering if anyone here has done them both and can compare? I&#039;ve heard from some people that modafinil is like super adderall, and others tell me that it&#039;s not as good, and none of these people really know what they&#039;re talking about anyways, so I turn to you.

				Real, legit Provigil is much stronger than adderall.&nbsp; I feel no adverse side effects when taking Provigil, and it lasts a good 12 hours.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very clean, very pleasant high.&nbsp; It&#039;s an amazing drug if you can get your hands on it.&nbsp; Name brand I think its like 950$USD for 30 200mg tablets from a pharmacy (outrageous imo).&nbsp; To my knowledge, this is what they give the Air Force pilots for long flights.

				Holy shit, are you sure it&#039;s $950 for 30 pills?? 30 pills on SR is only $70 which seems impossible compared to that outrageous price.

Does it give you a stronger euphoria? My understanding is that Modafinil produces no euphoria, but only increases alertness. Is it a better study drug than Adderall?<br /><br />

				I have been prescribed both Modafinil (as Provigil) and Adderall for narcolepsy.<br /><br />Modafinil is not a classic CNS stimulant. It is stimulating but it&#039;s nothing like amphetamines (or cathinones or pyrrolidines or piperidines...). It&#039;s a &quot;wakefulness promoting agent,&quot; i.e. it keeps you awake for 12+ hours. It&#039;s prescribed for narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder (basically people who work the graveyard shift), and in some cases ADHD.<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot preference for Modafinil simply because it comes with little to no euphoria. It&#039;s Schedule IV in the US, meaning it has a very low harm/abuse potential. In other words, you can&#039;t take a ton of Modafinil and geek out for three days. In fact, it&#039;s hard to have a good time on Modafinil at all. It just keeps you up. You can&#039;t really get high on it. Some people report a small mood boost or focus boost, but it&#039;s insignificant compared to Adderall. There is a market for stimulants that don&#039;t come with manic symptoms or jitters, and that&#039;s why Modafinil was made.<br /><br />It is by no means stronger than Adderall in any way. 200mg of Adderall would kill most people, but 200mg is a common starting dose for Modafinil. At 20mg everything about Adderall is much more so than everything about Modafinil at 200mg. This is not subjective, this is fact.<br /><br />The reason why Modafinil is so expensive is the fact that there is no generic for it in the United States. It is a very new drug, I think it was only created in the past 30 years. It has only been a prescription in the US since 1998 (Provigil). The brand name is VERY expensive, and when it comes down to it Modafinil is just a plain joke of a drug, at least, at its current cost.<br /><br />Although many people benefit from Modafinil, I personally detest it. When I took 200mg, a perfectly normal dose, I experienced terrible anxiety. I don&#039;t suffer from chronic or recurring anxiety at all, and on Modafinil (and for a day or two after not taking it!) I felt like a chronic anxiety case. I had no benzos to help with the anxiety so I began to drink during the day and chainsmoke... I took melatonin to go to bed and it didn&#039;t work... the only thing that ended up working was chewing ice, strangely. Furthermore, it didn&#039;t prevent me from going to sleep during the day, but it did so at night!<br /><br />The reason my doc put me on Modafinil at first was worry that stimulants would incite mania in me. I suffer from bipolar II so there is a distinct probability of mania when stimulated. In fact, after Modafinil, I was placed on Concerta (methylphenidate) which made me manic. Adderall ended up working for me, albeit not perfectly... still working on a better solution.<br /><br />Apparently I am QUITE the exceptional case, though. Most people don&#039;t get anxiety from Modafinil - it&#039;s a very rare side effect for the drug. And those who do get anxiety from it don&#039;t usually do better on amphetamines! But here I am.<br /><br />Oh, and for posterity&#039;s sake, Adderall is mixed amphetamine salts... about 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine. It is a CNS stimulant and it is a good compromise between the euphoria of dextroamphetamine (known as Dexedrine in the Rx world) and the body stimulation of some of your OTC stimulants, like caffeine.<br /><br />Personally, Adderall adds just the tiniest bit of extra good mood to my day. At higher doses I get bad jitters, but no mania. I feel that there is a reason why the Ritalin craze ended and people went back to prescribing amphetamines... they&#039;re just plain better for most people. Not all, but most.<br /><br />On the topic of price, generic Adderall is in short supply due to some funky legislation. Both drugs are very expensive if you don&#039;t have good health insurance.<br /><br />Oh, and finally, while Modafinil is generally non-recreational I found that snorting 200mg (OWCH) gave the Modafinil some chattiness and euphoria, but I can get that more so with 10mg of Adderall, or 20mg of caffeine (low tolerance)... however it&#039;s still not that great at what it does and for mission-critical stuff the armed forces use amphetamines, not Modafinil. Hitler gave his blitzkrieg army methamphetamine...<br /><br />Bottom line: Modafinil isn&#039;t super Adderall, and it isn&#039;t &quot;as good,&quot; because the two drugs do different things.
