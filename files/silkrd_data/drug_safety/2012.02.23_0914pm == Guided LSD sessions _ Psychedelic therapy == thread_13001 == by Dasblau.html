				Hi all. I am interested in therapists or guides that do psychedelic therapy, that is therapy that involves the use of LSD. <br />I have read it in many books, Stanislav Grof and James Fadiman among others, and saw it recently in a documentary called &quot;Inside LSD&quot;. <br />I recommend this documentary, it is available in the internet. In it appears a lady that goes to a new agey house in the woods in California and undergoes a guided session with LSD. <br /><br />This is illegal in the US and searching on the internet has not given any results. Does anyone know about this? Does anyone know how to find persons providing this kind of guidance in the realms of psychedelics? Has anyone done themself and can explain how it went, what results they got, how different was it than to take LSD in other environments??<br /><br />Please don&#039;t hesitate in sending me a PM if you want to preserve any contact information. I&#039;m in the US and would be only interested in finding it here, or in Canada. <br /><br />Thank you very much, you help would be much appreciated. <br /><br />best

				I do this IRL using my own home.&nbsp; Talk and lecture about the tool of LSD, proceed to giving 200-300mcg dose to client/friend, have them blindfolded or something.&nbsp; Put some easy listening music on their headphones.&nbsp; Keep watch over them, at some point in time they&#039;ll want to take the blindfold off.&nbsp; The blindfold is for pure introspection, visuals are kinda distracting IMO.&nbsp; Discuss what they&#039;ve learned.&nbsp; Follow through with a follow up session at the end of the week to see what they have retained.

				Bumping again--<br />Also looking for a guide/sitter/therapist for psychedelic therapy sessions.<br />I&#039;ve read Stan Grof&#039;s Doorway to the Numinous and Christopher Gay&#039;s The Acid Diaries. I&#039;m slowly working my way through Grof&#039;s LSD Psychotherapy (long sentences and psychologist lingo make for slow going...)<br /><br />If there&#039;s a psychedelic &#039;scene&#039; where I live, I haven&#039;t found it yet.<br /><br />Suggestions on how to proceed on my search are appreciated.

				This is something I&#039;m also interested in trying. I have a friend who is willing to sit me but I know he&#039;s nervous about it and I fear that will ruin it for me, and also stop me being as introspective as is needed.<br /><br />If anyone knows of any of these in Europe then please let me know.<br /><br />I did consider asking my therapist if she&#039;d be willing to do it...she used to take a lot of acid in her younger days, and speed, and basically lots of other stuff and she thinks it can help treat some mental health problems. But I&#039;m not sure if this is advisable...

				I think an experienced hypnotist (reliable and with years of experience, there are a lot of fake out there) cuold be an excellent guide, infact hypnotist work with a natural alteration of state, even Aldous Haxley studied hypnosis, and in my opinion a long hypnosis session with LSD cuold be a very effective session.<br />

				I honestly think that, when it comes down to it, you are your own best sitter. At the same time, I wouldn&#039;t recommend that you go at it alone. I&#039;ve found that what works best for me is to take the psychedelics with a few friends. There is a certain amount of camaraderie that comes from taking the drugs together and keeps everybody close. You can be introspective together, discussing things that are of importance. If you want, you can still fade back and think by yourself, but you are still able to reach out to your friends to discuss what you were thinking.

				Pain<br /><br />LSD was studied in the 1960s by Eric Kast as an analgesic for serious and chronic pain caused by cancer or other major trauma.[36] Even at low (sub-psychedelic) dosages, it was found to be at least as effective as traditional opiates, while being much longer lasting in pain reduction (lasting as long as a week after peak effects had subsided). Kast attributed this effect to a decrease in anxiety; that is to say that patients were not experiencing less pain, but rather were less distressed by the pain they experienced. This reported effect is being tested (though not using LSD) in an ongoing (as of 2006) study of the effects of the psychedelic tryptamine psilocybin on anxiety in terminal cancer patients.<br /><br />Cluster headaches<br /><br />LSD has been used as a treatment for cluster headaches, an uncommon but extremely painful disorder. Researcher Peter Goadsby describes the headaches as &quot;worse than natural childbirth or even amputation without anesthetic.&quot;<br />Although the phenomenon has not been formally investigated, case reports indicate that LSD and psilocybin can reduce cluster pain and also interrupt the cluster-headache cycle, preventing future headaches from occurring. Currently existing treatments include various ergolines, among other chemicals, so LSD&#039;s efficacy may not be surprising. A dose-response study testing the effectiveness of both LSD and psilocybin was planned at McLean Hospital, although the current status of this project is unclear. A 2006 study by McLean researchers interviewed 53 cluster-headache sufferers who treated themselves with either LSD or psilocybin, finding that a majority of the users of either drug reported beneficial effects.Unlike use of LSD or MDMA in psychotherapy, this research involves non-psychological effects and often sub-psychedelic dosages.<br /><br />some more info on the research <br /><br />http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=pl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fbazonline.ch%2Fwissen%2Fmedizin-und-psychologie%2FPsychiater-Gasser-bricht-sein-Schweigen%2Fstory%2F25732295<br /><br /><br />a friend of mine that has cluster headaches had a half blotter of jurgens 300ug&nbsp; . He actually took off his fentanyl patch.&nbsp; :)<br />

				Since my last post in this thread I&#039;ve done some digging and was eventually offered a place on a research study studying the effects of psychedelics on treatment resistant depression. These studies are going on all over the world from what I can tell (definitely in the UK there are several, likewise in the US so I&#039;m guessing Canada will also have some) and for a wide array of conditions. Perhaps do some research and try and get yourself into one of these studies if you&#039;re really serious? They&#039;re official studies with authorization and funding etc (one of the ones in the UK is spearheaded by David Nutt, and there&#039;s studies going on in Oxford) so it seems a fairly safe way of trying it?

				I think your best bet is to find a therapist /life counselor who is into the whole scene - possibly smokes pot, or goes on &quot;hippie&quot; retreats. Then ask him if he would be willing to do a guided experience for you. I had a therapist like this in high school, and I&#039;m pretty sure that if he felt it would have helped/if I had access to the substance he would have done it.<br />That being said though I live on the west coast of the US in a very liberal area and that was a few years ago to boot.

				I can tell you from1st hand experience that taking LSD helped me to overcome a horrible case of PTSD.It was bad, ahd violent breakdowns,get delusional , itd overwhelm me and scared the hell out of me because the fits were so uncontrollable.&nbsp; I regard LSD as an honest miracle- the best way I can explain the experience is: I was hiding a multitude of fears in the back of my mind, trying to ignore they existed, but with the LSD those fears became visual and had substance, so i had to deal with them.It truly changed me for the better.

				My closest psychedelic friend and I are far from doctors or anything like that, but we frequently take friends who are interested or seem to be struggling with their psyche on very controlled trips in the great outdoors, providing some guidance and perspective.<br /><br />so far its been going great, and has been EXTREMELY rewarding.&nbsp; there is nothing like somebody shaking your hand (while we&#039;re both coming down) and thanking you sincerely for spiritual guidance.&nbsp; <br /><br />you might want to check out some websites, OP, if you&#039;re actually interested in psychedelics and academia.<br /><br />here are just a couple useful links of events I will probably be attending and a group that I volunteer for:<br /><br />http://www.maps.org/<br />http://psychedemia.org/<br />http://www.horizonsnyc.org/site/<br /><br />also if you&#039;ve read &quot;the cosmic game&quot; by stanislav, you know whats g00d.<br /><br />I feel that I learned and changed so much with the help of LSD all by myself, so I can only imagine how wonderful a professionally guided session would be.&nbsp; yeah, I&#039;m lookin&#039; at you; future!
