				Hi!<br />I&#039;m wanting to order this:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/18008<br />And have no idea what &#039;full spectrum extract&#039; means.<br />Is it smoke-able? And if it is, same doses as freebase DMT?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Garlic

				DMT is one of many alkaloids that in each plant. A full spectrum extraction would include all of these alkaloids, rather than processing the extraction further to remove the additional alkaloids and purifying the DMT. For M. hostilis, this is generally only going to impact the actual trip minimally, except that the entire 200 mg is not going to be pure. Sometimes an additional product known as &quot;jungle spice&quot; is removed I believed, although I am not clear (and am not sure if anyone is) on the exact composition of this alkaloid mix. With other plants, they contain higher levels of other psychoactive compounds, including 5-meo-dmt which would effect the trip more. <br /><br />Whether the extraction can be smoke efficiently depends on whether the extraction was finished as a freebase or a salt. Most commonly, DMT would be left as a freebase for smoking if the person understands what they were doing during the extraction. If it is a salt, the vap point is much higher, and you must calculate the mol weight of the salt and subtract that to obtain your relative dmt weight with purity taken into consideration as well. I am unsure if the salt can be smoked, but I think not. The salt is good for snorting or oral use (with an maoi, which are dangerous)
