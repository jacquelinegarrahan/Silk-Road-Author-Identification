				Just come up with a good story and then keep trying from doctor to doctor. It does not matter if you see 100 doctors in a month trying to get certain scrips as long as no more than 1 doctor writes the script. Its alot of money to see many doctors but some are against xanax and you wont know until you get there in many cases. Plus most smart doctors will do anything they can to avoid prescribing a younger person narcotics. Try to find a doctor that holds stock in a company that makes the kind of drugs you want and you will have the most chance of getting that drug.

				for Xanax, tell the doctor that when you&#039;re driving, sometimes for no apparent reason your heart starts to race and you fear that you&#039;ll die at any second from a car collision (this is anecdotal, taken from my sister) <br /><br />Also - I know a guy that is going through a divorce. His &quot;ex&quot; wife has long term depression, bipolar disorders, etc etc. When she told her psychiatrist that she was going through divorce and stuff he x2 her Xanax script. <br /><br />So I figure, the more messed up your life is, the better the chances of getting Xanax. Tell him someday&#039;s, it&#039;s easy to go outside and get the mail - and other days that you&#039;ll feel so &quot;vulnerable&quot; that you&#039;ll just look through the window, afraid of going outside. The thing with panic disorders is that some people become &quot;flight or flight&quot; over the smallest things. These people are also sensitive to words and criticism. Not sure if it&#039;s true with everyone on Xanax but these are just some of the characteristics that stick out to me. <br /><br /><br />Hydrocodone - some doctors will want to see a compound fracture (like a broken bone protruding from your leg) in order to OK narcotic painkillers. They want pain that they can visually see on an xray like cancers and shit .&nbsp; The most convincing thing to do is have your mom or someone come in with you and have her tell the doc how you can&#039;t sleep at night because of whatever pain you have. <br /><br />But before you start rehearsing stories, It&#039;s better to just let the peeps going through chemo and the elderly with broken hips get the narco pain killers. Doc&#039;s put their careers on the line everytime they write out scripts for painkillers. Painkiller joyrides sometimes end up as OD&#039;s and the first person the family and police are going to look at is the Doctor that acted as an enabler.

				Well I moved from FL a year ago but I was heavily involved in the clinics for 8 years before that. Regarding getting what you want, you may present additional documentation beyond the MRI. A prescription history showing you were already receiving whatever you want (know the reasonable limits, in my day it was 210/120 on 30mgIR/80mgER oxycodone with 90 2mg alprazolam). The trick to using fake ones is to take real ones and alter the information (to get a perfect copy you can re-type it all)- the phone numbers should be changed to lines you control and can be answered by someone who knows what to say if they choose to verify it. The shady clinics know the game, but they&#039;re only interested in covering their asses. I wouldn&#039;t try any of this outside of known-crooked FL clinics.

				Luckily something like 75% of spines look damaged on an MRI, so depending on your location, it shouldn&#039;t be hard to find an interventional pain management specialist or neurologist that&#039;s compassionate.<br /><br />I actually have horible back injuries and would be fucked if my dr wasnt so understanding.<br /><br />I get 60 30mg Oxycodone, 90 10mg Oxymorphone IR and 120 Sioma each month for&nbsp; a $200 office visit.<br /><br />I&#039;m moving to florida because most Dr are even more lax about rxing SCIIsl so with a legit MRI and rx report I will get no less than 240 30mg Oxys, 180 15mg Oxy and 120 2mg Xanax.

				Florida has really cracked down. The people telling you that you can come to Florida and get easy pain pill and xanax scripts were correct at one point in time but it is no longer the case. There has been legislation passed against Florida pain clinics and now Florida has a ton of people that used to get scripts for roxies, xanax, perks, and somas that cant get anything. Its all about finding the right doctor. You can convince the right doctor that you need xanax but the pain killers are more difficult. I would recommend studying what an anxiety attack is and then going to a doctor and then when he asks whats wrong describe a situation and make it sound like you had an anxiety attack. Also research what types of things cause anxiety and then tell the doctor about a few different events that would cause anxiety. For instance losing a loved one causes anxiety so you could tell your doctor that you recently lost a close family member. Relationships can cause anxiety, for instance if you loved your significant other and they dumped you.......As for the pain pills be careful getting a fake MRI if you get caught its a serious charge.
