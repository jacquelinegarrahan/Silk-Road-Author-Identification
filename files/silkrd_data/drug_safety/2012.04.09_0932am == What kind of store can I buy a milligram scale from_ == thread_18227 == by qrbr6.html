				What kind of store can I buy a milligram scale from? I don&#039;t want to buy it online because I don&#039;t want to get it delivered and I want to buy it tomorrow. By the way I live in Australia, though that shouldn&#039;t change much.

				Try ClubX or another sex shop, Tattoo/Piecring places are another option. If you&#039;ve got a medical/science supplies place they would be another bet. If your near gold or precious mineral territory, try a metal detector/prospecting supplies place! Failing that, a catering supply place might be another option!<br /><br />I&#039;m in Aus too, I always get mine from eBay. Got an associate whose happy to bring &#039;em in for me! I go thru &#039;em a fair bit!!!

				say you&#039;re pulling them out of your safe and they slip and hit the deck... they then become unreliable, especially if you&#039;re weighing powders! After a certain amount of weighing all scales need to be recalibrated and sometimes a new set of scales is cheaper than buying an accurate calibration weight!

				Every now and then I&#039;ll buy one from a nearby smoke shop. Most shops only carry 0.01g scales, but it&#039;s worth a shot.

				All great options were listed above of where to find it locally, but I&#039;d recommend you invest in a pretty good (ie $50) scale from Amazon if you&#039;re going to be weighing small powders because accuracy can be very important.

				JimPooley, sex shops sell them? Really? What for?<br /><br />I got mine off of ebay. If you&#039;re getting drugs delivered, it really shouldn&#039;t be a problem getting scales delivered! :P Mine also came with a few calibration weights, which is handy.

				I bought this one (seems to be the most popular model) from this vendor on ebay. There are tons of vendors who has it. Arrived quick and works great. Really cheap too.<br /><br />http://www.ebay.com/itm/120846724059

Low quality - high quality and cheap - expensive. In general a MG scale will run you a fair amount but its worth it especially if you are using drugs that are active in small doses.

I&#039;ve actually been into a couple, and the most I saw besides directly sex related things was legal herbs that are meant to increase horniness and/or sensitivity, which I guess are still directly sex related. Never seen anything like pipes or other paraphernalia.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also found that there are two distinct types of sex shops. One is dark and dingy, has a creepy guy behind the counter, and makes you feel dirty just for being there. The other is slightly more brightly lit and has sexually open and friendly staff (usually women) who are happy to talk about what you are looking for and give you advice.<br /><br />We&#039;re probably getting a little bit off topic now though. :)
