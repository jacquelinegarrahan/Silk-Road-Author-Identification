				I need to have my blood tested due to vegetarianism, and i&#039;ll have to do it to get a ritalin prescription for my ADD. <br />Never done it before, but it scares the shit out of me; so much that I think I might faint. Which drug can I use to overcome this problem just this one time, without altering the results too much ? valium? xanax? is weed fine? (dislike pills)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				i think youd be better off fainting then taking drugs <br />hard to fathom whats going on in that head of yours<br /><br />just explain to the nurse you dont like needles and they&#039;l make it as easy for you as possible<br />

				Here&#039;s the idea brother... I&#039;m guessin they&#039;re testing your blood before your script to make sure there&#039;s no other drugs in your system. Because there is still a war on drugs, anything other than prescription drugs that u can prove u have a script for will deny you the ability to get your add meds. Why they need to test u for the eating habits... probably to make sure you&#039;re not developing any deficiencies. The best idea is to look the other way and think of something nice... I had to get epidurals for my back and leg pain and the needle for that procedure is the size of Texas and goes into your spinal cord. My option was to lay still and think of a pretty girls face and smile. JKust think happy thouights, and it&#039;ll be over before you know it...&nbsp; just like the song says: OK, Just a little pin prick. There will be no more AHHHH! But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up? I do believe it&#039;s working, Good! That&#039;ll keep you going for the show... C&#039;mon it&#039;s time to go.

				how&#039;s fainting better than taking drugs? not talking about heroin or anything (especially not IVing heroin!)<br /><br /><br />Drksdfmn138 - With it would&#039;ve been that easy&nbsp; :( I literally get sweaty just picturing it, which is inevitable.<br />The psychiatrist said I should ask the nurse (doctor?) to give me some Valium, but if there are other drugs that suit my purpose better and/or not make me dizzy for the rest of the day, they would be preferable.
