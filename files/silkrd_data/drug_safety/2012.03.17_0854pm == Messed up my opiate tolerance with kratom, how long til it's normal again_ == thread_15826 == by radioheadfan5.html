				Hi SRers,<br /><br />Just wanted to see if anyone had any experiences similar to mine, or advice to offer. In a nutshell, I&#039;ve done pretty much every opiate there is, but due to a recent job relocation/getting tired of dealing with sketchy street dealers, I decided to try kratom in late 2010. While it obviously doesn&#039;t have the strong effects of real opiates, it&#039;s been a great substitute for me. It doesn&#039;t get me &quot;high,&quot; but does give me a pleasant, drowsy feeling if I take enough.<br /><br />Fast forward to today, and I&#039;ve been using about 10g of Bali kratom pretty much every other day for over a year. I&#039;m not physically addicted (as I recently took a week-long vacation to a SE Asian country where kratom is illegal...so didn&#039;t try to smuggle any in with me!) and felt totally fine - no withdrawals whatsoever. I do enjoy how it feels though, and know that I&#039;ve developed a tolerance to it and that there&#039;s definitely something of a psychological addiction at this point.<br /><br />Basically, I love real opiates (H, oxymorphone, hydromorphone to be specific) and feel that because of my kratom tolerance I&#039;m not able to enjoy these to their fullest extent anymore - there&#039;s definitely a cross-tolerance at work between these and kratom, even though kratom is not a real opiate. I&#039;ve decided to stop use of all opiates/opiate imitators until my tolerance goes away so I can enjoy all the wonderful products for sale here on the SR to their fullest extent. What I&#039;m wondering is, how long will my tolerance take to subside? Kratom is a nice crutch for me and not using it will be hard, but I&#039;m going to do my damndest to stay off it - just hope this process doesn&#039;t take too long.<br /><br />Would love to hear you opinions&nbsp; :)<br /><br />RF5
