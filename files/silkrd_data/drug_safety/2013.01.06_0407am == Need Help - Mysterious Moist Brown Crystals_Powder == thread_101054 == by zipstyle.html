				Recently I received in the mail a baggie from a vendor that was reshipping an order that had been messed up before. It was in addition to another package which contained a reship of an item that I had ordered before. Upon opening the package and finding the baggie I thought &quot;Oh goody! An extra something for me to enjoy :)&quot; But then I realized that I had no idea what it was. <br /><br />Information I&#039;ve gathered by observation:<br />-The substance is brown and crystalline, like brown sugar<br />-It is moist<br />-It barely smells like anything, maybe FAINTLY like sassafras<br />-It tastes quite bitter like MDMA or MDA (or some other MDXX?)<br />-Doing a reasonably sized finger dip (which looked more like putting a small glob of it in my mouth) resulted in mild euphoria and feelings of well-being for maybe 3-4 minutes. I would like to say it was not placebo, but that is hard to determine since I&#039;m the only one to have tasted it.<br />-I also considered the possibility that it could be DMT or some other tryptamine but I think it would have tasted differently if this was so.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a scale or a testing kit so it&#039;s merely speculation and conjecture but that&#039;s better than nothing.<br />I have considered doing an acetone wash, would anyone recommend this?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Update: About 30-40 min after taking the finger dab I still feel somewhat good/happy and speedy alternating with feeling tired and sleepy. Kinda like when dexamphetamine putters out. Gradual comedown though, nothing too sharp. I&#039;m suspecting MDA but since there isn&#039;t much smell, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s very likely.

				Why not just message the vendor and ask? My opinion is that it&#039;s just probably good old mandy.

				It sounds very much like sand MDMA. This one douche bag vendor pulled a bait and switch on me a few months back, and I received a gram of substance that fits your description exactly. What I received was MDMA cut with some type of speed. Honestly it wasn&#039;t bad stuff, I just wouldn&#039;t have ordered if the vendor had been upfront about what he was going to send me, and overall he was a real asshole about the whole thing. I&#039;d be curious to know which vendor you received this from, as the one I reference made claims about getting only better stuff in the future.Any chance the vendor&#039;s initials are FB?

				No, what&#039;s even weirder is that the vendor doesn&#039;t sell any MDXX related substances so that totally threw me for a loop!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />The vendor only sells once product, which I got a reshipment of, and I also got another package (which I assume is from the same vendor due to packaging) that contained this brown, gooey, crystal substance. After letting it sit out overnight, it&#039;s dried a little but it&#039;s still gooey. Also, it kinda smells like saliva.

				I have had tryptamines that when fresh were near white, globby sort of powders that over time degraded into a gooey brown caramel looking substance without any noticeable loss in potency.&nbsp; And moist, brown clumpy powder was one of stages along the way.&nbsp; That has been my experience with 4-AcO-DMT at least.&nbsp; Any idea how much you consumed off your finger?&nbsp; I would be more careful with eating things off your finger because some of the tryptamines are quite potent.

				I would say that the glob I consumed off my finger would be about 10-15 mg.
