				This didn&#039;t happen to me, but a friend of mine said he gave his friends some MDMA and some had weird next-day effects. One reported having vertigo and dizziness. My friend seems to be implying that I cut my shit with something else, but this just isn&#039;t true, and I know for a fact that the stuff I had was pure, as it has always been. So I&#039;m wondering, what could cause these side effects? I suggested to him that maybe they didn&#039;t drink enough water the night of, and therefore got dehydrated the next day, but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s true.

				Vertigo and dizziness are two different symptoms, are you sure that your friend is experiencing vertigo and not just dizziness? Ask your friend to stand on one leg and close his eyes, if he doesn&#039;t feel like the room is moving around him while he does that he is not experiencing vertigo.<br /><br />Vertigo has multiple causes however the most common ones all relate to problems with the inner ear. Although it is possible for a certain select group of drugs (typically powerful antibiotics given to cancer patients) to damage the inner ear and cause vertigo, this is exceedingly rare. Generally the problem relates to an inner ear infection or an auto-immune condition that has damaged the inner ears functioning (Such as Menieres disease). Occasionally vertigo can be associated with brain problems including stroke or hemorrhage however this is accompanied by extreme symptoms including an inability to walk, blinding pain and difficulty moving the eyes, and your friend would already be in hospital if this happened to him.<br /><br />The likelihood of any common recreational drugs or impurities actually CAUSING your friend to experience vertigo are slim to none. Most likely he had an inner ear infection he possibly didn&#039;t know about and getting fucked up on MDMA made him sicker, or he is just mistaking dizziness for vertigo.
