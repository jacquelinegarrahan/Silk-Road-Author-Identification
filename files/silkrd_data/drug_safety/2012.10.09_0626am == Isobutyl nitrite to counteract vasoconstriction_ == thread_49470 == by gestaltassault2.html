				Would it be dangerous to use isobutyl nitrite to try and counteract the vasoconstriction caused by drugs like MDMA or NBOMe&#039;s?

				Niacin (no flush version) tends to work well for counteracting the vasoconstriction caused by MDMA. Avoid taking it with LSD, though, as it diminishes the effects. I&#039;m unsure of how it effects NBOMe.

				yes it has health risks and i survived.. done it lots and lots.. when sniffing the amyl you will have a rapid decrease in blood pressure.<br /><br /><br />ive been doing loads of reasearch into combos with poppers cos &#039;i dont do drugs without poppers&#039;.<br /><br />done stacks of lsd, alchohol, weed with it - 25i and&nbsp; mdma twice.. last time was just ***so good*** and so intense...(during a candyflip, right on the peak)<br /><br />but the doctors ive spoken too never seem to concerned about me using it<br /><br />you gotta remevber the anti-vasoconstriction effect with only be a temporary thing and the boosted high might make you pass out.. if you could find some kind of drug like that niacin stuff the dude above talked about you might be right.<br /><br />remember too any medications that raise of lower your blood pressure must be taken into account.<br /><br /><br />medically teh only massive warnings about poppers is never to use them with viagra because with both drugs causing very low blood pressure you could stroke, ciadiac etc<br /><br /><br />think im really eager to find out is about meth use and poppers.. <br /><br /><br />try find as much as you can about natural supplements that lower vasoconstriction if you want a lasteing benefit
