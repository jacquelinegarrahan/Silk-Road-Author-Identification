				Originally posted by me in another thread. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24610.msg306126#msg306126<br /><br /><br />I buccally took two of duderugs&#039; 1mg tabs every four hours or so for an 18 hour + trip that was fucking magical. Ten Strip (10 mg in 18 hours) overall. <br /><br />Not from the start, not even for the first six hours really, didn&#039;t really get much off it until I smoked weed and got in the company of good people. Before that, It did a good job keeping me awake (I had been up 16 ish hours before I took the first tabs). I drove to town under the influence of two tabs. Felt awake and alert. Semi-robotic even. Got to town, got in some good company, and then smoked a blunt. Thought 25i was only good for keeping me awake before smoking said blunt.<br /><br />THIS IS WHERE SHIT JUMPED OFF<br /><br />I go to take a leak. The bathroom where I was at had four different paint schemes and colors. The clouds to my right turned to the face that chases you in Mario, Only they were backing away from me, The brown bricks behind me turned into Howard Marks-esque plaques of hash and I almost tried to eat them, until I stopped myself laughing hysterically. I left the bathroom and was immediately greeted with a smell like I had never smelled before. <br /><br />It took me a minute to realize I could smell electricity, not burning outlets, nothing was hot, nothing melted. Just the smell of electricity. I rejoined my friends to tell them what is happening to me and instead I returned to find out I could see peoples auras and all forms of energy in general. I proceeded to proclaim &quot;I can see and smell energy!&quot;, Laughed for a half-hour. Then we all went our separate ways. As I was leaving, I turned to my friend (who I had given two tabs to) and said &quot;this stuff is NEATO. That&#039;s the only word I can describe it with.&quot; <br /><br />I drove to my dad&#039;s farm, clearheaded as fuck, completely at ease and drove better than usual actually. Went to help my dad (who is anti-drug because my brother is an addict of opiate-painkillers) do a bunch of farm work in 90+ degree weather STILL HIGH ENOUGH TO SMELL ELECTRICITY AND SEE ENERGY (didn&#039;t see anything unless I wanted to though), didn&#039;t get too hot. Hauled out a pickup-truck bed full of corn using wheelbarrows, dug 200 pounds of potatoes, and carried 5 bushels of green beans all over creation. Did this all perfect, my pops suspected nothing. Got done farming, took a shower, and then went to a party. <br /><br />Felt much the same as before I smoked earlier in the day. Took two monster hits of hash (second time ever BTW), and after that was blown the fuck away. Real hard to describe what was going on after that. <br /><br />Next day I was tired as fuck, but felt great. <br /><br />Never have I seen anything that synergizes so well with cannabis. NEVER.<br /><br />

				I know you thought you were fine, but please do not drive under the influence.&nbsp; Because the reality is, you aren&#039;t fine, or at the very least you can&#039;t objectively tell if you are OK to drive.&nbsp; And I can tell you - if you are high enough to be seeing energy, you are high enough that it isn&#039;t safe for you to drive.&nbsp; Yes, you may think you can get from A to B without a problem, and you may have been fine this time...that doesn&#039;t mean you were OK, and it isn&#039;t just your life you are gambling with when you step into the drivers seat of a motor vehicle.<br /><br />Yes, I have extensive experience with 25i and marijuana.&nbsp; And I wouldn&#039;t drive on the two.&nbsp; Your decision to drive on the combination for your FIRST EXPERIENCE with it, quite honestly, sickens me.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason this stuff is getting banned.&nbsp; Responsible use would go a long way towards that not happening.&nbsp;

				Psst, I&#039;ve been doing hard fucking drugs since I was 11. Smoked at least a half-ounce of pot pretty much every day since I was big enough to hold a lighter pal. I smoke more pot during the fall harvest season than you would in a lifetime. I had already been on it for fucking ten hours, and felt next to goddamn nothing.till the weed was added. I was in complete control of everything at all times, period. <br /><br />You don&#039;t know a goddamn thing about me, yankee, and for you to pretend so is stupid. For you to pretend like you are some kind of goddamn expert on a substance that has ONLY EXISTED FOR TWO YEARS AND BEEN DONE BY PROBABLY LESS THAN 10,000 PEOPLE ON THE ENTIRE FUCKING PLANET is even more asinine.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I was able to focus enough to dig (FASTER THAN I EVER HAVE BEFORE) fucking 200 pounds of potatoes without cutting A SINGLE ONE (never happened before) then I was EASILY focused enough to drive a car. And I did it all BETTER THAN I EVER HAVE. <br /><br /><br />This stuff is a Performance Enhancing Drug for me. <br /><br />EDIT: THIS IS NOT TO SAY EVERYONE SHOULD DO WHAT I DID. I WOULD ADVISE PEOPLE TO NOT DO WHAT I DID. <br /><br />I once drove from Miami to New York City with 100 Kilos of somebody else&#039;s cocaine in my trunk, and then drove back from NYC to Miami with two million dollars of the same guys cash in the trunk. Snorted a half ounce of coke on the way up there, and then snorted the other half on the way back to stay awake the entire time. It was my 17th birthday. Now THAT was a journey I shouldn&#039;t have taken. I am used to this kind of crazy shit.

				25i completely left my head intact. I would say that it is considerably tougher to have a bad trip on it compared with LSD, but my LSD experiences are limited at best, with the last few probably being DOx compounds (Given that they lasted 12 hours off one hit, felt &quot;dirty&quot; as fuck, and were extremely stimulating) instead of the prized Nectar. People around here go around saying a good hit of acid should last 12 hours :(<br /><br />My best experience with LSD was my first, and it was at a festival. Only lasted 7 hours but never really felt quite like that before or since. I knew why it was famous after that. Real LSD is as famous as it is for a reason. <br /><br />25i feels like the LSD of my generation. 25i at a festival would probably cause me to nut in my pants without touching anything.<br /><br />

				We have yet to have a report of a bad trip on 25i and from my own personal experiences think its pretty damn hard, as for driving on it I can understand what you mean about how clear headed you feel although I still would not recommend it to anybody.

				I&#039;ve been tripping 25i pretty consistently and I&#039;ll wholeheartedly agree with 328502E that no one should be driving under the influence of it, that is for anyone reading this thread not directed at you since you&#039;ll no doubt make your own asinine decisions that will potentially put 25i nbome in the media spotlight as a new drug causing teen fatality.<br /><br />I can be tripping hard and sit up straight, shake myself off and be thinking clearly but it creeps back up. I have driven drunk many times before when I was like you and felt I&#039;ve done it plenty of times, I&#039;m clear headed, I&#039;ve even passed blow tests completely wasted. Now I think back to those times and I&#039;m just thankful of how lucky I was, rather than viewing my lucky streak as a premise to continue to test that luck further.

				Yeah truth to be told I wouldn&#039;t really recommend it. I&#039;m not gonna drive on it again guys.<br /><br />The reason why? Cause the more time you spend driving the less time you are chilling somewhere with the full unadulterated buzz! :)<br /><br /><br />But I&#039;ll be damned if I&#039;ll have somebody tell me to not do farmwork on it.

				I&#039;ve had some 25i blotters before that were pretty good but the snort capsules from tylerdurden were awesome.&nbsp; Had 2x last night and was blasted off, I think even 1 of the capsules would be enough to have a strong buzz, much better delivery method than blotters.

Smoked at least a half-ounce of pot pretty much every day since I was big enough to hold a lighter pal. I smoke more pot during the fall harvest season than you would in a lifetime. I had already been on it for fucking ten hours, and felt next to goddamn nothing.till the weed was added. I was in complete control of everything at all times, period. <br /><br />You don&#039;t know a goddamn thing about me, yankee, and for you to pretend so is stupid. For you to pretend like you are some kind of goddamn expert on a substance that has ONLY EXISTED FOR TWO YEARS AND BEEN DONE BY PROBABLY LESS THAN 10,000 PEOPLE ON THE ENTIRE FUCKING PLANET is even more asinine.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I was able to focus enough to dig (FASTER THAN I EVER HAVE BEFORE) fucking 200 pounds of potatoes without cutting A SINGLE ONE (never happened before) then I was EASILY focused enough to drive a car. And I did it all BETTER THAN I EVER HAVE. <br /><br /><br />This stuff is a Performance Enhancing Drug for me. <br /><br />EDIT: THIS IS NOT TO SAY EVERYONE SHOULD DO WHAT I DID. I WOULD ADVISE PEOPLE TO NOT DO WHAT I DID. <br /><br />I once drove from Miami to New York City with 100 Kilos of somebody else&#039;s cocaine in my trunk, and then drove back from NYC to Miami with two million dollars of the same guys cash in the trunk. Snorted a half ounce of coke on the way up there, and then snorted the other half on the way back to stay awake the entire time. It was my 17th birthday. Now THAT was a journey I shouldn&#039;t have taken. I am used to this kind of crazy shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Man your so cool. I bet your pretty smart too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re*<br /><br /><br />Sorry, had to do it... you can&#039;t sarcastically call someone smart WHILE using shit grammar...&nbsp; :-\<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You call me a grammar Nazi, I say, &quot;NEIN!&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />+1 :)<br /><br />You just can&#039;t call someone out for being dumb while using improper grammar.&nbsp; It would be similar to making fun of a heroin user as you are shooting heroin into your arm...&nbsp; ???

Ten Strip (10 mg in 18 hours) overall. <br /><br />Not from the start, not even for the first six hours really, didn&#039;t really get much off it until I smoked weed and got in the company of good people. Before that, It did a good job keeping me awake (I had been up 16 ish hours before I took the first tabs). I drove to town under the influence of two tabs. Felt awake and alert. Semi-robotic even. Got to town, got in some good company, and then smoked a blunt. Thought 25i was only good for keeping me awake before smoking said blunt.<br /><br />THIS IS WHERE SHIT JUMPED OFF<br /><br />I go to take a leak. The bathroom where I was at had four different paint schemes and colors. The clouds to my right turned to the face that chases you in Mario, Only they were backing away from me, The brown bricks behind me turned into Howard Marks-esque plaques of hash and I almost tried to eat them, until I stopped myself laughing hysterically. I left the bathroom and was immediately greeted with a smell like I had never smelled before. <br /><br />It took me a minute to realize I could smell electricity, not burning outlets, nothing was hot, nothing melted. Just the smell of electricity. I rejoined my friends to tell them what is happening to me and instead I returned to find out I could see peoples auras and all forms of energy in general. I proceeded to proclaim &quot;I can see and smell energy!&quot;, Laughed for a half-hour. Then we all went our separate ways. As I was leaving, I turned to my friend (who I had given two tabs to) and said &quot;this stuff is NEATO. That&#039;s the only word I can describe it with.&quot; <br /><br />I drove to my dad&#039;s farm, clearheaded as fuck, completely at ease and drove better than usual actually. Went to help my dad (who is anti-drug because my brother is an addict of opiate-painkillers) do a bunch of farm work in 90+ degree weather STILL HIGH ENOUGH TO SMELL ELECTRICITY AND SEE ENERGY (didn&#039;t see anything unless I wanted to though), didn&#039;t get too hot. Hauled out a pickup-truck bed full of corn using wheelbarrows, dug 200 pounds of potatoes, and carried 5 bushels of green beans all over creation. Did this all perfect, my pops suspected nothing. Got done farming, took a shower, and then went to a party. <br /><br />Felt much the same as before I smoked earlier in the day. Took two monster hits of hash (second time ever BTW), and after that was blown the fuck away. Real hard to describe what was going on after that. <br /><br />Next day I was tired as fuck, but felt great. <br /><br />Never have I seen anything that synergizes so well with cannabis. NEVER.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Your a dick
