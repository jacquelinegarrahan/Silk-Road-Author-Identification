				MDMA ,&nbsp; i dont know what its called in English but its a chemical that the mdma wont fall apart and color<br /><br />these are the important things . if you want to make mdma yourself is also possible but then it cost more money and isnt the effort to make the pills cause then you can sell the mdma crystal it self

				Microcrystalline cellulose as filler and binder.<br /><br />Magnesium stearate for the pill to have that shine/gloss.<br /><br />Powder food coloring<br /><br />I don&#039;t think ratios are that big of a deal.&nbsp; For example an ecstasy pill that has 200mg mdma&nbsp; content aren&#039;t always going to be exactly 200mg unless obviously it was pressed into the pill with just mdma which would probably be crumble away from being too brittle because of the no binder.<br /><br />So you could probably just do 200mg MDMA, 150-200mg microcrystalline cellulose, a extremely small pinch of magnesium stearate, and a small pinch of powder food coloring.

				Mix MDMA with microcrystalineceluose + a little bit magnesium stearate, then add it to the pill press et voila!<br /><br />Might want to add some foodcolouring powder to cheer things up

				On SR everything is possible.<br />Press them with 100mgs and sell them for 200mgs.<br />People are pretty stupid on SR and never test their drugs.<br /><br />You will get just as much cudos for 100mg pills as for 200mg pills while they are not.<br /><br />200mg is a lot anyway considering the 1/2 mgs per kg. A fat person would need a 200mg pill...<br /><br />If you want to press 200mgs anyway, go ahead. You&#039;d better just sell the mdma though.<br />And if you want to press 100s for not a lot I&#039;ll be your reseller.
