				Dokha?<br /><br />http://www.medwakh.com/<br /><br />Basically it&#039;s a Middle Eastern tobacco that is additive-free (or so they say, because e.g. cigarettes have so many additives to make them burn slowers/evenly etc) but obviously more concentrated with nicotine, and DAMN this stuff gives you a rush/crazy buzz! I replaced my cigarette smoking with this stuff a few years back because smoking 10+ cigarettes a day was leaving me super congested and was just dominating my lungs. But I only take a few rips of this stuff out of my pipe a day(they sell them on that site, the name of the pipe is a medwakh) and I&#039;m waayyy less congested from inhaling less volume of smoke I think. Not to mention I fucking love the buzz, it seriously rocks you for 20 seconds or so, and it kills any cravings or blows stress right out of my head lol. I&#039;ve shared it with a bunch of friends, I&#039;ve found that some people get hooked and replace their cigarettes with this and some people don&#039;t like the intense buzz and they just stick to their cigarettes.<br /><br />Anyone else tried or love this shit? <br /><br />-btw im not trying to promote that site or anything, there are plenty of other ones you can order from but I like this one because if you become somewhat of a regular customer the guy hooks you up with free samples/pipes and shit

				Interesting. Sounds like it&#039;s worth a try.

				Give it a go and order a small bottle or sample or something, you might be surprised. Like I said I replaced my cigarettes with it as I inhale a lesser volume of smoke, but get a much bigger buzz. The way I see it is if I&#039;m smoking, I might as well be getting a buzz instead of becoming mildly relaxed.
