				I&#039;ve never tripped before, decided I&#039;m ready for my first trip.<br />Which one of those two above would you recommend ? <br /><br />In terms of effects,duration and general feeling how do those two differ?<br />And which one would you say is good doing outdoors?

				Did .5mg of 25i Nbomes once, was light and fluffy.&nbsp; Easy trip.&nbsp; Walking around outside was nice, peaceful and relaxing.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t even care when cops drove by.&nbsp; The come up was super smooth. the comedown was super smooth too.&nbsp; It was the easiest fry i&#039;ve ever had in my life. Very smooth<br /><br />Did 20 mg of 2c-e once, insuffulated.&nbsp; took a minute to kick in full force, like hit with a bag of semi trucks.&nbsp; walking around was pretty, but horrible.&nbsp; The darkness was black, had to have faith that the road was there.&nbsp; Very intense visuals. lights were amazing. colors were great. cops were terrifying.&nbsp; The come down was smooth, after 8 hours.&nbsp; Nothing says &quot;FUCK YEAH, I LIVED!!!&quot; like actually surviving. was happy for days.<br /><br />My advice, do both, at separate times.<br /><br />2c-e is wonderful, just start low.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do like I did and snort what some guy weighed out (probably fucking eyeballed it too) and told me to take.&nbsp; Of course, when I do it again, it will be 15mg up the nose.&nbsp; The instant overwhelming fry was such an experience to be had.<br /><br />god damn I want some 2c-e

				oh duh.<br /><br />you have never tripped, do the 25i.&nbsp; 500ug or 1000ug.<br /><br />very smooth.&nbsp; Very peaceful.&nbsp; top notch stuff when it comes to the smoothness of the high<br /><br />(of course I like it rough)

				If it&#039;s a choice of one of the above, definitely 25i 500ug unless you&#039;re a big person, then go for 1000ug. There&#039;s a little &quot;happy&quot; built into that one so you&#039;re more likely to have a smooth trip. <br /><br />2c-e is not something you want to start with if you never tripped before. That&#039;s one of the more intense and unpredictable 2c&#039;s. <br /><br />For a first trip, I recommend 2c-c ... 2c-i and 2c-b are a little less noobish and less expensive but 2c-c is about as safe as you can get.

				Thank you for your input, all of you.<br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll do 2c-c simply because i don&#039;t want a weak trip, i want a real one, and from your description it seems like something that does not really make you trip the way a trip should be.<br />if luck&#039;s on my side I&#039;ll do 25i-NBOMe first.<br />More comment&#039;s and input would be greatly appreciated.

				If you do 2c-e, start with 10mg and work your way up because I&#039;ve seen people go crazy starting off with high doses (20mg+). I&#039;m a big fan of 2c-i though so I suggest checking it out if you haven&#039;t done it already, it&#039;s definitely one of my favorite psychedelics.

				I&#039;ve had some 2C-E for a while now and been afraid to try it. What would you say the best method of injestion is? I&#039;m a big of 2C-B and always take it rectally. I think the effects are better. Is 2C-E similar in this regard?

I started with 10mg of 2c-e and it was awesome, it was like a combination of 2c-b with 2c-i, just the perfect mix so I say trying it out orally first and see how you react to it.
