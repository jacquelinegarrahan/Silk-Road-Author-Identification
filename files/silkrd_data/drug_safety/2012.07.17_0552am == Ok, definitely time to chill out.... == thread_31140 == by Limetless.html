				This is why I don&#039;t touch &#039;Bing&#039; on normal days/nights. (or by myself really... even though it&#039;s tempting)<br />Just try to save it for an outing with friends.

				yo Lim, i really like your style, but your post count alone shows that you do way too much coke.<br /><br />maybe you should just stick with red bull during the day and only do coke when you gotta go kick the shit out of someone.<br /><br />the next level of gangterness involves being completely relaxed and clear headed in every situation.&nbsp; can&#039;t be coked up all the time and expect to have smooth reflexes.

				Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. By dollars spent cocaine is hands-down my drug of choice, but if I reflect I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really all that amazing compared to other substances. It just has a versatility and entertainment factor that few other drugs combine in such an enticing way. There&#039;s no big time commitment, it doesn&#039;t impair your faculties to any great extent, and it&#039;s fun. Plus I don&#039;t know about other people but I hardly have any negative effects from it as long as I exercise and eat well the following day (I rarely drink with it, think that helps). So it&#039;s easy for it to become a default even if it&#039;s not overly spectacular. And when you can afford it without thinking twice, it&#039;s just all too easy haha.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve found to be a great ally in curtailing cocaine use is GHB. If I want a line or two but take G instead I&#039;m completely satisfied and will wonder to myself why I even wanted to do coke in the first place. It&#039;s better in a lot of ways and being an endogenously produced substance, it burns very clean and will generally leave you feeling refreshed (although you should read up on how to use it as a sleep aid if you take it late at night; you basically need to wake up in the middle of the night and take a second dose or it will degrade your sleep quality...sounds strange but medical literature backs this up strongly). It also goes swimmingly with K, which in it&#039;s own way works for me in nipping a coke hankering.<br /><br />Saw someone mention once how you either have to make coke your bitch, or you will become its bitch. Fairly true in my experience.<br /><br />Now where&#039;d my straw go....<br /><br />

				Yeah exactly lol, it would be impossible for me to run a business properly if I was especially my non-SR businesses. This is why, and this may be controversial but fuck it, most Heroin Vendors on here last about as long as a fart takes dissipate because most of the time they are too junked out their tits to function normally. I mean I haven&#039;t been here long at all, 4 months now, but out of all the fly-by-night Vendors and Scam-artists the vast majority of them have been Heroin sellers. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Dude, I can see the temptation of spending BTC you earn, but set a goal of having one coke night per week. Mine is once a month but maybe once every two weeks would be ideal for me.<br /><br />I can do 100mg and be happy if its good coke.<br /><br />Less IS more, coke just creeps up and ten grams is nothing for my boss who used to do almost an oz per week, 3 grams a day. He actually took most by mouth.<br /><br />Now uses maybe once every two weeks buut will do a gram were I would stop at 100 - 120mg.
