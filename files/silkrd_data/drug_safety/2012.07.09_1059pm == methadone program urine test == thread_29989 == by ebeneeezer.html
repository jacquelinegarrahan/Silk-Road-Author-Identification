				Hopefully somebody knowledgable here can help me.<br /><br />I am on a daily dose of methadone from the clinic which i collect once a week.<br /><br />I have an appointment coming up in about a weeks time where i will likely be asked for a urine sample. However i have recently been using heroin and diazepam, so i will obviously fail the test.<br /><br />What i would like to know is if i get hold of a clean (drug-free) sample of urine and add a couple of drops of methadone to it, will this pass the test?<br /><br />I know this method works just fine with subutex, but with methadone, i&#039;m not sure if they test for the metabolites of methadone after it has been processed by the liver, or just the methadone itself??<br /><br />Any help will be gratefully received!!<br /><br />Cheers

				That really works with subutex?&nbsp; I think some drug tests also test the temp of the sample which needs to berr consistent with body temp. I think it depends on what metabolites they test for. Most opiates metabolise into morphine and I believe they can&#039;t tell between codeine and heroin.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You might be ok on the H. Less likely on the diazepam. <br />You can&#039;t flush the drugs any faster by drinking water, but you can certainly make your sample more dilute by drinking shit loads of water the day before and on the day.<br />It depends how much is riding on the test. Maybe you can spin a yarn about co codamol, and you just took one valium. You gonna lose your script? Go to jail? Or just get told off by your drug worker?<br /><br />A week could be long enough to beat the h test. It varies on metabolism I&#039;ve known 3-4 days and 10 days! Valium I believe is 1-2 weeks.

				You might get into more shit trying to cheat the test. As I say it depends on the seriousness of the test. I&#039;m on a drug treatment program with subutex. I visit monthly, don&#039;t always get tested. If I failed they would initially just warn me and start testing more frequently. If I continued to fail they&#039;d put me on a stricter regime&nbsp; and eventually kick me back to methedone.<br />However if your treatment is legally enforced as part of probation or something it&#039;s gonna be more serious, and worth trying to cheat? I&#039;d say you&#039;ll likely test positive for benzos but 50/50 for H depending how much you took.<br />As to the dilution being suspicious , again it depends how strict the test is. At my place the tests are just to kind of check how truthful I&#039;m being, the emphasis is on helping me, failing a test would be mostly embarassing. <br />For other people a test can mean back to jail, and these tests are likely to be taken with someone more or less watching you piss, and temp and dilution are going to be checked too. Fresh human urine is going to be within a narrow range of temp. <br />I have heard of people filling their bladder using a catheter with someone else&#039;s clean piss. This sounds like a great way to get a urinary infection, but if it keeps you out of jail! I am seriously not recommending this option!!!!!

				By failing all i&#039;d lose is my ability to pick up my script weekly, which would be nothing more than a major pain in the arse for me!! But i do not plan to fail anyway! Nor do i plan on stopping taking my little party items!!!<br /><br />I know for a fact it works with subutex. Just a tiny (emphasis on TINY) little amount dissolved in clean piss and the test subject sails straight though! I know somebody who does it regularly.<br /><br />I&#039;m just hoping that the same thing works with the methadone. Even if they do test for metabolites, i reckon i could blag my way out of it by saying i&#039;ve been extremely ill or something to that effect!<br /><br />I was just kinda hoping that somebody on here would know for certain whether they just test for the presence of methadone, or metabolites of methadone.<br /><br />I guess i&#039;ll find out myself next week huh!!<br /><br />Thanks for the replies people.<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you all know how i get/got on.

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s done in practice or not, but in theory the clinic is able to test for EDDP, which is a longer acting metabolite than methadone itself, so it should show up in every methadone user&#039;s urine. A quick internet search shows that in-office tests are available for under 1 EUR.<br /><br />Finding methadone with no EDDP is a huge red flag.<br /><br />Finding EDDP without methadone may or may not be a red flag depending on one&#039;s metabolism, as EDDP sticks around longer.

				BEWARE. don&#039;t use this method for subutex. buprenorphine is the drug in subutex. and in the body buprenorphine breaks down into norbuprenorphine. i know this because i tried this and they knew exactly what i did and it got me kicked out of the program. for your question im sorry i don&#039;t know if this will work with methadone.

				I can&#039;t see it working. That&#039;s why I was surprised by the subutex idea. They test for metabolites not the substance itself. I think this is true of the most basic test. <br />I reckon you&#039;ll get more grief trying to trick them. I&nbsp; reckon say your granny gave you a tablet to help you sleep, you thought it was herbal.... actually no, that&#039;s clearly bullshit! I have heard the co codamol defence given a few times...&quot; I didn&#039;t realise it would show up as an opiate I only took it for the paracetamol &quot;<br /><br />If like me your tests are infrequent then in future just do as I do. I only take drugs for a week or so after a test. This also handily limits my use. The subutex helps too as it takes a few days before I can get high, meaning I have to organise carefully. If I could just have smack more often then I&#039;d end up back where I started.
