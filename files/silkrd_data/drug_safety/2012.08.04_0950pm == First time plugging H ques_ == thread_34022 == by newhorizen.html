				Plugging has always been pretty strong for me, I&#039;d start with maybe half or 3/4 of a bag and work your way up.<br /><br />Not a lot of people plug so there probably won&#039;t be too many answers for this&nbsp; :-\

				Thanks, that was the amount I was thinking.&nbsp; The last bag I got awhile back I basically wasted trying to smoke.&nbsp; Snorted some and it was &quot;ok&quot;.&nbsp; I physically am not able to shoot it so this is the next best thing I hear.

				I&#039;m a huge fan of it with most drugs, it&#039;s one of the most effective ways to take most substances to me, other than IV. Not a huge fan of needles so I do plug H a good bit. If you do it, report back and let us know how it went/how much you used, best of luck!

				So is the bioavailability of plugging H greater then snorting? If so by how much?

				I actually don&#039;t know, I prefer it myself and I feel like it might based on the effects it has on me compared to snorting it, but maybe that&#039;s just me. I snort a lot of different kinds of drugs so maybe that&#039;s a factor. Erowid might have some good information?
