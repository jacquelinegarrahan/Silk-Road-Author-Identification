				Bong it. A little bit of ash (unsmoked - leave a cigarette burning - don&#039;t smoke it - only use clean ash), sprinkled with crack then light it and suck it up. <br /><br />It&#039;s nothing like coke so be warned. You&nbsp; WILL want more than you bought (no matter how much you buy). I wouldn&#039;t touch the stuff anymore but if you get some, get some weed for the come down. It will help massively<br /><br />Edit: actually, a pipe would probably be better. Back in the day we used empty coke bottles, a biro case, ash and toothpaste. Or a bong. All will work&nbsp; :)

				im only getting a gram of it but will have some good quality coke as well, in what way is it different to coke? is the comedown really bad ?<br />also would a normal hash pipe be ok with the ash ? do i keep the flame on the crack to smoke it or do i heat it gently<br />sorry for all the questions but last time i done it the fella that was doing it was chasing it off tinfoil, lol, i thought it was pretty shite as it only numbed my mouth and throat, lol

				I&#039;m certainly no expert on crack but I did go through a period of taking it pretty regularly a few years back. A normal hash pipe will work fine and you should keep the flame on as if you were doing a normal bong hit.<br /><br />How is it different? I don&#039;t know the technical explanation (I am sure someone here does) but it is a far more intense hit. You will feel it instantly and the high will be immense for say a minute or so, then a slightly less high for another few minutes. The high is very short compared to other drugs but it is one of the greatest highs I have ever experienced. On the downside, the comedown is equally as dramatic. It is by far the worst come-down I have ever experienced. I&#039;ve done most drugs but not everything so this is certainly not a definitive answer. Like I said, keep something aside for the come down and you&#039;ll be alright. Never tried coke but I imagine it would work. Weed definitely does. After a few goes on crack, I refused to do it without weed for afterwards. <br /><br />You will definitely enjoy it though&nbsp; :)

				hi mate,<br /><br />you are best using an asthma inhaler they give you the best results, pull the insides out and put 1 layer of tin foil over the mouth piece and secure it with a elastic band or hair bobble, use a pin to pierce holes, anything bigger than a pin will just rip the foil, ten holes will do and you need to put the ash on so it completely fills the little foil gauze you made flatten the ash with a bit of card or what ever and use 2 pieces of card to scoop your crack on to your pipe then when your ready exhale as much as you can then put it to your mouth and lick the flame against the crack while inhaling at the same time don&#039;t suck too hard, hold it in for about 10-15 seconds and exhale you need to do this in 1 go no point in trying to burn it again if you fail it just wont work, you need to reload with fresh ash every time you have smoked a pipe of it other wise you will end up wasting your crack, if you have a little set of scales then put some crack on the scales till it weighs 0.1 then snap/cut that 0.1 in half and smoke the half because your a beginner you don&#039;t want to fuck ya self up too bad! but the next pipe should have more crack on than the first just build yourself up with it and as far as the comedown go&#039;s weed will not work at all the only way to really come down is take some heroin but fuck that horrible shite take some opiates like Valium (Diazepam) x2 10mg will do or something similar with opiates in it&#039;s like been wired up in a negative way on the comedown really weird but you&#039;ll be fine.<br />the buzz its really good, too good lol you feel extreme happiness and confidence if you sniffed a whole colombian cocaine harvest you still wouldn&#039;t feel the same buzz as you do on crack trust me coke is like a legal high compared to this stuff mate<br /><br />i was a raving crackhead for 2 years i know what I&#039;m talking about when it comes to this stuff<br />i have done terrible unforgivable things to people just to get my hands on it which i am not proud of<br />don&#039;t smoke this stuff any more than once a month even that is too much also as you might know its not a drug that you can speak about even to your friends it&#039;s just like smack in that respect, deemed dirty by nearly everyone<br /><br />hope this helps any questions you have regarding it just pm me and i will answer the best i can<br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />BlackOps89

Tamp it down until it&#039;s tight-ish but not too tight. Slide chore to 1/2 inch from one end. Fill the half inch with crack. <br /><br />Hold the stem at a slight angle so the crack doesn&#039;t run out when it melts. Make sure to inhale really slowly and very deeply.<br /><br />Hold it until your head explodes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i know about crack pipes, but im in the uk and cant buy them glass tubes or chore here, suppose i could buy a different glass tube and some wire wool but havent seen a glass stem anywhere, lol

				I&#039;ve done it both ways ....<br /><br />The glass tube (sold with a plastic rose in it) and metal mesh stuff is the easiest way to make a crack pipe, and it is completely effective. You can get huge hits off it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also done the foil and ash method. I used a small plastic water bottle, put an empty pen tube in the side of the bottle to draw off of, used foil pressed and shaped in the bottle top to make a bowl, poked some holes in the foil, filled the foil bowl with cigarette ash, sprinkled crack on top.<br /><br />You really can&#039;t go wrong with either of these methods. They both work extremely well. Myself, I prefer the foil and ash method, but for simplicity you can&#039;t beat the glass tube.
