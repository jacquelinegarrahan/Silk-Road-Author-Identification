				I have a friend who is supposed to trip on LSD with me (first timers) on the 3rd.<br />She&#039;s planning on taking MDMA October 24th (first time as well).<br /><br />I know that MDMA is not a typical psychedelic, but it also has a 1 month tolerance period.<br />We&#039;re trying to be clean for 2 weeks prior to our LSD experience.<br /><br />In short, will the MDMA use roughly 11 days prior to LSD have any effect on the potency of the LSD?

				i dont know for 100 percent sure, for every individual things are different<br /><br />but no, i dont believe using mdma once a week and a half before the lsd should produce a significant reduction in the experience. <br /><br />i know during festivals people take mdma one night, then the very next day they are still able to trip with normal doses<br /><br />technically the flood of serotonin from mdma could down regulate the receptor lsd acts mainly on - but only using once shouldnt produce much down-regulation, and even so after a week the tolerance would be back pretty close to normal. since lsd is in a way over stimulating the 5ht2a receptor, one should still be susceptible to the neural changes that occur even if the receptor levels are slightly lower<br /><br />generally psychedelic cross-tolerance is assumed to be around 3 days to one week, so waiting 10 days should be perfectly fine

				I gave you thank as in the karma thingy. But I&#039;ve also had a lot to do recently.<br />Thank you anyway, though you more or less just reconfirmed my own theory.<br /><br />BTW, she decided not to since it might interfere with her period and because of the LSD trip coming up.<br />Still, thanks anyway.

				Ok, so this friend and I tripped on some NICE &#039;cid this past weekend, VERY BEAUTIFUL.<br /><br />She is now planning on eating a blue defqon bean this weekend. This will be her first time with MDMA, do you guys think she will be able to have a truly full first time with the molly if shes tripped so soon beforehand?<br /><br />We&#039;re also planning on eating another 2 blotters each the following weekend after that, though I assume that should be fine, as I&#039;ve been reading about people tripping after a roll, with no issues.

				I&#039;m pretty sure there isn&#039;t much of a cross tolerance between the two. Maybe something slight. But You&#039;ll be good.

				Well you gotta put into mind that LSD mimics seratonin to your 5ht receptors, I am tripping balls right now so I don&#039;t know if this would make a huge difference but I thought I&#039;d share my input :D<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				I&#039;m going ot assume that if people say you have to wait until 2 weeks to trip well on lsd again, then I&#039;ll assume this means you are not baseline until then.
