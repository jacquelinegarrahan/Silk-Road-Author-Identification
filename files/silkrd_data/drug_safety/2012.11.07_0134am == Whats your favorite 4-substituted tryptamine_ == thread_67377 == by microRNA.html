				This may not count as different, but I have done 4-aco-dmt freebase and 4-aco-dmt furm and i feel that the freebase is stronger at identical doses :D

				4-AcO-DMT is my favorite. In comparison to 4-HO-MET (my second most used 4-tryptamine), the head space is a lot clearer and brings about a wonderful body high I have yet to experience from 4-HO-MET. 4-AcO-DMT&#039;s visuals are a lot more sharper in my experience as well with distinct patterning, whereas 4-HO-MET seems to be more bold and more prominent tracing. The one thing 4-HO-MET has over AcO is the euphoria which is indescribable, almost MDMA-like. A friend of mine has found it to be very dysphoric, however, which always seemed odd to me. <br /><br />I have always found 4-tryptamines to be some of the most diverse of all psychedelics in regards to how they affect each individual. Reports are so varied that it&#039;s hard to pinpoint exactly what their effects are truly like. Perhaps this is due to the niche appeal and lack of quantitative data, but LSD, mushrooms, 2C-X, and so forth seem to be much more consistent in effects. This adds to the appeal to me, personally.

				thank you for your time giving your experiences<br /><br />i am leaning heavily towards 4-aco-dmt&nbsp; - considering the combo with allylescaline actually since its suppose to enhance each in a way not attainable alone<br /><br />and the freebase of any chem will be more potent comparing equivalent mass because a portion of the molecular weight is composed of the salt while the freebase is just the active molecule - no extra mass of the salt atoms. although i think the salt is considered more stable

				Does anyone have experience with 4-sub-DET vs 4-sub-DMT... does one have less of the &quot;dark&quot; aspect or one with less of a &quot;stimulating&quot; effect?<br /><br />i have many trip reports but cant really find too much where people are actually comparing the two. im trying to find the one with the least body load/relaxing while still strong visuals and introspection of course<br /><br />also see 4-x-MIPT and 4-x-DALT that i was wondering if anyone prefer them over 4-sub-DMT?? <br /><br />----------<br />glad to hear it zulu :) i love sharing knowledge, one reason this community is amazing

				4-AcO all day every day<br /><br />I favourite of my mine and various colleagues. Perfect for walking into the bush or onto a deserted beach, and exploring the mysteries of oneself :)

				that doesnt mean anything.&nbsp; thats not a tryptamine... thats the group in 4-position, which includes hydroxyl (OH), acetyl (AcO) or phosphate (PO)- basically they are converted to the hydroxyl in the body to be active (at least phosphate, acetyl might have some activity on its own before being hydrolyzed)... any of the 4-sub tryptamines can be 4-aco so that comment has no significance <br /><br />the question is which of the tryptamines is your favorite... DMT, DET, MiPT, DALT <br /><br />again, does anyone have experience with 4-x-DALT possibly<br /><br />can anyone compare 4-x-DMT to 4-x-DET please? thank you<br />
