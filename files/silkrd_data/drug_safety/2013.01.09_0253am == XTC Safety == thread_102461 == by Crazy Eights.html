				Should you decide to purchase high dosage mdma pills and are new to them &amp; haven&#039;t not consumed that much mdma before - please be aware that some rolls (200-300mg+)&nbsp; hit like lightening - always break in half<br /><br />remember fun first<br /><br />ce

				Yeah there&#039;s a fine line between coming up hard and coming up TOO hard. First time I took MDMA it was a nice easy ride up and I think something most people would enjoy. I know lots of people that drop too much and spend the first half of their trip just fighting the effects instead of enjoying the roll.<br /><br />My advice to most people is order more than you need for a few trips and try a SMALL dose of any given batch on a casual night so you can plan the right dose on a real party night.

				oh god, a 2-300mg dose in a good pressie is plenty enough for any newcomer! honestly, half a pill will do the job, two would be frightening! Now personally, i&#039;ve eaten a gram+ of pure shards in a night but that was because A) I was stupid and thought i could roll for a whooooole weekend.... B) I&#039;ve been a raver fuck for some time now and have had not only MDMA but waaaaaay scarier chems worked into my life many a times by now.... and C) i spaced my &quot;indulgences&quot; rather far apart (hours or so), i would never recommend taking such high doses all at one time, and not at all in some cases
