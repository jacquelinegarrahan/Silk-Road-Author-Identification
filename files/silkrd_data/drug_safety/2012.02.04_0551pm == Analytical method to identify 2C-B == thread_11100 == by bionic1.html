				My problem is that I generally distrust any 2C-B that comes to the market nowadays (SR and RL) due to the large availability of cheap and legal(!) 2C-X derivates. Does anybody know if there is any analytical method (beside HPLC) to identify 2C-B/DOB (or a bit more specific: the bromine on the 4th position)? <br />Any help is appreciated!!<br /><br />Thanks in advance! =)<br /><br />Kindest regards

				Marquis reagent. Add 19 drops of conc sulfuric acid to 1 drop of formaldehyde solution, 2C-B turns olive green. Unfortunately DOB also turns green, the colour is different but obviously you&#039;d need to have authentic samples of both to differentiate between the two. Melting point is another reliable analytical method available to the home user. If you&#039;ve got access to a mass spec the presence of bromine will be obvious from the ratio between the 79Br and 81Br (for 2C-B, m/z would be 259 and 261) which should have roughly the same intensity. <br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve never heard of RC&#039;s being sold as 2C-B though. If you buy from a trusted vendor on SR you&#039;re highly likely to get the real deal. I&#039;ve had positive experiences with both sunshine and gammagoblin.

				Thank you very much for your help! :)<br /><br />No, I don&#039;t have access to a mass spec, but to a normal laboratory melting point analyzer. (2C-B HCl melts at 215°C, 2C-I at 246°C. I didn&#039;t found the MP&#039;s of any other salt or 2C-x in this short time, but some research on the net will do trick.)<br /><br />As far as I know the marquis test also turns olive green from 2C-C, so it&#039;s not 100% sure.<br /><br />Anyway, I neither heard of RC&#039;s being sold as 2C-B. And I don&#039;t think that a cheap 2C-X could be &quot;commercially&quot; sold as 2C-B on the illegal drug markets in order to scam customers. Sooner or later somebody would find out and create a shitstorm. Mislabeling is one of the worst thing in this scene.<br /><br />Nevertheless I&#039;m quite paranoid on this matter, and the idea of being scammed with a cheap 2C-X scares me and makes me feel helpless. But knowing that I could identify 2C-B gives me confidence... :)<br /><br />By the way, I do like and love the other 2C-X&#039;s too. But when I buy 2cb I want to get 2cb.<br /><br />Thanks again, and have a nice weekend!

				The effects profile of 2C-B is pretty unique if you&#039;ve experienced the other halogenated phens enough times.<br /><br />The key is the dose, duration, and the visual aspect. For one thing, 15mg of 2C-B will be active whereas it will hardly produce a perceptible alert with 2C-C (in my experience, YMMV). I find the visuals are very different on 2C-B than 2C-I or 2C-C. 2C-I produces great beams of light that B does not for me, at least at doses under 30mg. The duration should be much shorter than 2C-I as well.<br /><br />So basically if 15-20 produces full effects yet it lasts 4-6 hours as opposed to 8-10, then you know you have your baby. <br /><br />At the same time, I have never heard of any &quot;fake&quot; 2C-B, mainly because there is not a dirt cheap 2C-x to pawn off in it&#039;s place. They&#039;re all fairly evenly priced. I get the same amount for 2C-I that I do for 2C-B. You don&#039;t have a situation like methylone and MDMA where the pricing disparity caused so many unethical people to pass M1 off as molly.

				Thank you for your reply and reports on the different 2c-x!<br /><br />I never did 2C-I, but I know what you mean with 2C-B being &quot;pretty unique&quot;. I really love this substance, although yet I haven&#039;t fully understood it.<br /><br />But seriously, 30mg and more? I wouldn&#039;t dare over 25 anymore. Above 30mg I had sensory overflow and that wasn&#039;t enjoyable at all. (but interestingly no aftermath when the trip was over. just like if I didn&#039;t took anything...)<br /><br />1g 2C-B costs about 600€ or 800$ per gram where I live.&nbsp; Thats why I doubted that they were selling real 2C-B.<br />You&#039;re absolutely right, the synthesis of 2c-i and 2c-b are basically the same. And it isn&#039;t much harder or more expensive to use bromine instead of iodine. So it&#039;s only logical that price for 2C-B is in the same range like other RC&#039;s.<br /><br />What I always wanted to try but never found was 2C-B-Fly! Hope I&#039;ll find it someday...

				I&#039;ve been trying to get some 2C-B-Fly for a while. It&#039;s been off the scene ever since that BRDFLY / Haupt-RC incident, but I&#039;m hopeful we will see it again. <br /><br />And on a side note, I cannot believe people are trying to get $800 for a gram of 2C-B! It shouldn&#039;t even be $200, let alone $800!!! That&#039;s incredible!

				It&#039;s quite easy. The only substance that is similar to 2c-b is 2c-d (similar visuals, peak length, body sensations etc), but dosage of 2c-d is much higher than 2c-b.<br /><br />I know I am a seller and you might not trust me, but the 2c-b you bought from us is the same 2c-b that was on blotters&nbsp; that were sold before (wowzers tested it with marquis and tripped on it, so you can ask for a review).<br /><br />I think people who lie about what they sell (for example br-dragonfly as LSD) are in the same category of scumbags as rapists. It&#039;s basically a rape on someone&#039;s psyche.

				Yes, it was more like a sandwich technique (if we are thinking about the same thing), some powder was visible on the blotter. Absorption rate was about 3.5-4mg/hit. Now we would just make larger squares.
