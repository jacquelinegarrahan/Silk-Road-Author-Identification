				so i just got some samples from him and want to try shooting it.&nbsp; havent ever done this myself only had a friend do it for me in the past.&nbsp; its this beige heroin and i feel like a lot of SR folks are probably somewhat familiar with his product at this point.&nbsp; do you have to cook up his stuff or dissolve it with citric acid?&nbsp; or is it the type that just simply dissolves at room temp?&nbsp; if someone could please give me a quick guide on how to prep and shoot his H I would be appreciative.&nbsp; just dont want to be a dumbass and ruin the H or worse, hurt myself.&nbsp; thanks<br />

				it should dissolve without acid<br /><br />try snorting a bit first to get an idea of the potency and make sure what you received was quality H before shooting <br /><br />in the interest of harm reduction please consider a different ROA<br /><br />its very difficult to shoot up yourself the first time. expect to stick yourself with a needle multiple times, and each time you do you need to change the needle (backload into fresh syringe) for maximum safety and to prevent infection and vein damage. definitely practice pulling up to register then pushing down with one hand without moving the needle before actually trying to stab yourself <br /><br /><br />also for harm reduction:<br /><br />disinfect your spoon with IPA pad<br /><br />add COLD tap water (less bacteria than warm) - few units should do it for a small dose and will make plunger easier to push<br />- i would recommend to boil in the microwave for 10-15 min to disinfect <br /><br />add dope<br /><br />either let cool if nuked or heat just barely (dont boil -it wont disinfect, you just want to warm the water to body temp and to facilitate dissolving the gear<br /><br />ball up tiny amount of cotton from qtip for example<br /><br />use syringe to pull solution through filter<br /><br />backload into fresh syringe (because the needle was dulled by the filter, some do this - many dont)<br /><br />check to make sure solution in syringe is clear and free of fibers/particulates<br /><br />tilt needle upward, tap and then push plunger up to make sure majority of air is out (tiny bubbles wont hurt if you cant get em all out) <br /><br />use IPA swab to disinfect injection site<br /><br />tourniquet up if needed <br /><br />inset needle bevel up<br /><br />REGISTER!!!<br /><br />(remove tourniquet)<br /><br />push slowly and enjoy <br /><br />there are much better guides on the internet but thats the basics of it, been a minute though so someone correct me if i forgot something

Shooting anything by yourself if you&#039;re inexperienced is unwise, and shooting heroin by yourself if you&#039;re inexperienced is an absolutely terrible idea. <br /><br />If you must, then microRNA&#039;s advice is pretty good. Start by sniffing it to try to gauge potency. Never use the same needle twice (they&#039;re what, fifty cents apiece? Truly, a small price to pay for safety and to keep your arms from looking like hell). Use something to sanitize your arm to avoid risk of infection.
