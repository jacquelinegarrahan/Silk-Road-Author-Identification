				Safe? Yes I&#039;d presume so.<br /><br />No more unsafe than taking 25i itself.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you still will probably be tripping? Does that stuff really make you trip hard? When I used to take it my mind was clear as water. I could take it and easily go to school or work with minimal problems unless I had to do something physical.

One time I took it and I couldn&#039;t even lift my drink up or get up off of my bed the body load was so bad.<br /><br />I&#039;d say just do what you have to do but also I&#039;d recommend staying away from the 25i, you&#039;re acting like a lab rat taking that shit. You have no idea what it will do to you in the future.<br /><br />I know people who have binged on it and experienced huge cognitive deficiencies such as not being able to form a full sentence or ceasing to feel strong emotion.<br /><br />It seems to be fine if you only take it once and a while but that&#039;s the outside of your brain...who the fuck knows what&#039;s going on IN there.<br /><br />Also I get a shooting numbness in my arm or leg about a week after I take it which doesn&#039;t seem to be a good thing.

				I feel ya thanks for the info.&nbsp; So could I take 1mg of xanax and be fine in front of everyone? <br /><br />Honestly I probably will stay away once I have enough money to get legit lsd in good amounts. Id much rather be taking that. But yea it was(still is) a weird feeling its like im on speed(mentally) for a couple minutes then it goes away. then ill feel like im piss drunk(physically) for a few then thatl go away. Now I can feel myself touching baseline. I just dont want to seem like im on something in front of a bunch of ppl im about to see, is it safe to go with the 1mg xanaXC?

				For future reference, Niacin or Niacinamide (vitamin B3) in large doses (250mg+) can help bring you down from LSD and probably many other psychedelics as well. <br /><br />

				@Tryptamine That&#039;s pretty interesting because I&#039;ve been thinking about that for a while. I know Niacin widens your blood vessels and 25i can have the side effect of vasconstricion, which is the thinning of blood vessels? So the niacin counters the vasconstriction but does it end your trip? Or just get rid of the uncomfortable side effects?

I have 500mg niacin capsules here, and I often take it for the flush. I like it and it feels like it&#039;s doing good to me, especially my brain. Vitalizing it.
