				Generally, MDMA is safe to user with SSRI&#039;s.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that nothing will happen.&nbsp; The SSRI will dull the roll and you won&#039;t feel it much.<br /><br />This is true of most serotonergics, since an SSRI will also lead to downregulation.&nbsp; Your best bet are drugs that don&#039;t act on serotonin - cannabis, GHB, amphetamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would highly suggest you think of trying to get off the SSRI.&nbsp; They have a huge amount of negative side effects (some permanent) and do not make you happy.&nbsp; They just make you not realize you aren&#039;t happy.&nbsp; Most people see this when they get off.&nbsp; Get off them before you are hooked - it can be difficult to stop if you&#039;ve been on a long time.

				Anyone saying MDMA and SSRIs are unsafe together is either not educated about the subject or is over-the-top paranoid about anything that could go wrong.&nbsp; To the point they shouldn&#039;t be crossing the street.&nbsp; Sorry.<br /><br />MDMA and SSRIs are definitely safe, as the mechanism by which they work is competitive.&nbsp; In fact, you could say it&#039;s even safer, as it&#039;s harder to OD on MDMA...but I digress<br /><br />Nothing will mimic the effects of MDMA while you are on an SSRI.&nbsp; The SSRI inhibits the mechanism by which it works, and no other mechanism mimics it.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; GHB isn&#039;t even close (it&#039;s about as similar to MDMA as LSD is).&nbsp; If you want to feel like you are rolling, get off the SSRIs and wait a few weeks before rolling.<br /><br />Psychedelics are safe to take with SSRIs as well, but again, you will get diminished results.&nbsp; It can be difficult / impossible to trip for you, depending on your SSRI dose.&nbsp; &nbsp;Psychedelics include LSD, 25i, 2cb, DMT, MDA, etc.&nbsp; You can find out if a drug is serotonergic with a quick google search, but here are a few that come to mind:&nbsp; alcohol, weed, GHB, opiates, benzos, ketamine, amphetamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />As Ben mentioned, SSRIs can have the side effect of sexual dysfunction.&nbsp; Which is usually when people go &quot;oh shit, I should get off this&quot;, and then they do.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; For some people, it&#039;s permanent.&nbsp; Yep, they just screwed themselves over for years / the rest of their life, for something that is pretty common and their doctors didn&#039;t even warn them about.&nbsp; Sorry, I hate SSRIs more than meth, so I can get a bit carried away...

				Wow clearly I need to do a lot more research into SSRIs!<br />In fact I noticed some sexual issues lately, That in it&#039;s self is making me reconsider taking the medication.<br /><br />Ok well if SSRIs are not the way to go can anyone recommend treatment for anxiety and depression that works?<br /><br />I was doing some reading about kratom, Sounds like it could be beneficial but reviews seem to be mixed. Does anyone have first had experience with this stuff?

				Seriously man the best advice I can give you is too get of the SSRI&#039;s.. they do way more harm than good. My ex-gf was on them for a while and it made her a lot worse, when she came off them she eventually released she was a lot better without them (even though she craved them for a few weeks after she come off). Basically SSRI&#039;s aren&#039;t your friend. <br />To help combat the depression/anxiety the best thing I can recommend is working out. Lift some weights for a hour or so 5 days a week and go on a mile run every few days and you&#039;ll feel overall a lot better within a few weeks if you keep it up. I know it sounds silly but it seriously does work in giving you a better overall sense of well doing. Much better than any pills! Also have lots of sex, it helps.

This can lead to serotonin poisoning called serotonin syndrome. <br /><br />according to wikipedia these are the documented chemicals that can cause you serotonin syndrome :<br />Antidepressants :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), TCAs, SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, nefazodone, trazodone, mirtazapine<br /><br />Opioids : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tramadol, pethidine, fentanyl, pentazocine, buprenorphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone<br /><br />CNS stimulants :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MDMA, MDA, phentermine, diethylpropion, amphetamine, sibutramine, methylphenidate, methamphetamine, cocaine, dextromethorphan<br /><br />5-HT1 agonists&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;triptans<br /><br />Psychedelics :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5-Methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine, LSD<br /><br />Herbs :St John&#039;s Wort, Syrian rue, Panax ginseng, Nutmeg, Yohimbe<br /><br />Others : tryptophan, L-Dopa, valproate, buspirone, lithium, linezolid, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, chlorpheniramine, risperidone, olanzapine, ondansetron, granisetron, metoclopramide, ritonavir<br /><br />most of the&nbsp; Tryptamines and Phenethylamines are not on the list but that does not mean they are safe. <br />&nbsp;they are not up here because there were no medical reasons to test these chemicals. <br /><br />also keep in mind that dosage increase increases risks and it is possible that on low doses you can have good experiences even with very dangerous combinations.

				Editing at length; this forum has already been backed up. However, the site is still indexed by google. I&#039;m not going to be around to respond to questions. I get PMs about this post still.<br /><br />Without getting into nitty-gritty,&nbsp; doubling/+upping the dose of MDMA<br />- may &quot;override&quot; the SSRI effects in some cases (I am not so sure about that)&nbsp; but<br />- DOES NOT reduce the toxicity from that doubled+ dose (not arguable. Coreg might be. Leave a note. Put it in your wallet if you decide to use.&nbsp; You can leave a note -- &quot;Some Random Internet Person Who Might Read About Or Might Know Or Have Dated a Person In or Be in Toxicology or I Don&#039;t Know What, It&#039;s Complicated, Anyway, That Person Said Coreg Kicks Ass For MDMA Poisoning / Hyperthermia.&nbsp; I&#039;d Give You A Number But I Don&#039;t Know It. So, Uh, First You Download TBB…&quot; Probably too much to write on a card in your wallet, never mind.) <br /><br />Also, since MDMA clears through CYP2D6/inhibits&nbsp; 2D6 (one of those autoinhibiting drugs that play push-pull with themselves as the dose escalates) ....one would want to be careful with other major inhibitors of 2D6 - which include bupropion (Wellbutrin), fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil.) Major inhibitor here will be defined as &gt;80% DEcrease in clearance. Moderate inhibitors include duloxetine and sertraline. <br /><br />Anyway - upping the MDMA to override the SSRI sets up some bad interaction scenarios and unless we&#039;re talking about a very low dose of a non-2D6 SSRI, it&#039;s not on my list of things I&#039;d say, &quot;Sure, try it, why not?&quot; Hold the SSRI and let it washout. 5 half-lives is the rough wash-out time if nothing else is involved to slow clearance. (This is burdensome with fluoxetine, obviously.) <br /><br /><br />AARRRGGHH serotonin syndrome. <br />Yes indeedy, it does come up with MDMA.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen writers here and elsewhere say that it doesn&#039;t. With respect, I disagree.<br />From my anecdata banks, I can tell you that combining Wellbutrin and MDMA is indeed a Bad Idea (™) and that MDMA and tramadol is also not a great mix… <br />hxxp://www.psychotropical.com/index.php/serotonin-toxicity&nbsp; - too much to c/p here.<br /><br />This article is also long, but discusses some of the MDMA/rx issues.<br />hxxp://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/4/219.full.pdf<br /><br />If you go to the *hint* bookmarkworthy Flockhart page on CYP450 interactions<br />hxxp://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />it lists the substrates, inhibitors.<br /><br />for more in depth information that includes UGT and transporters, <br />hxxp://www.pharmacologyweekly.com/content/pages/online-drug-therapy-tables <br />is a useful quick reference<br /><br />and for a good basic overview of the ideas, the article on Opioid Metabolism below is outstanding.<br />hxxp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704133/&nbsp; <br /><br />There was an extensive list of CYP450 information here. I&#039;ve removed it for the reasons outlined above.<br />Use the listed references.<br /><br /><br />*grapefruit juice - important points. &quot;Grapefruit juice is unique among CYP3A inhibitors because, when consumed in usual dietary volumes, only enteric CYP3A is affected. Therefore, **GFJ has no impact on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A substrate drugs administered intravenously, and does not prolong the plasma half-life of orally administered agents.** Ingestion of GFJ causes an irreversible loss of enteric CYP3A protein, without a decrease in CYP3A mRNA. Clinically, implies that prior exposure to GFJ is sufficient to cause an interaction – i.e., **GFJ does not have to be physically present in the gastrointestinal tract for an interaction to occur. Recovery of CYP3A activity requires de novo enzyme synthesis, and the half-life for this process is approximately 23 hours.**&quot;&nbsp; emphases mine. (see PMID 3071161)<br /><br />I&#039;ve undoubtedly missed many relevant things. <br />I would recommend Bluelight and Erowid.<br />I kind of over think these things and I guess I didn&#039;t really answer the OP&#039;s question, so - <br />- would avoid Prozac due to the length to clear and the build-up if you further inhibit clearance<br />- would avoid Celexa over 30 mg/d because there are too many things that inhibit it. <br />- would look up half-lives and consider the idea of short-term washouts. If that leaves you suicidal or nonfunctional, then, uh, don&#039;t do that.<br />- personally, I would not recommend MDMA + SSRI/SNRI and just bumping up the MDMA - I&#039;m open to other information<br />- I think I would avoid all of the substituted cathinones with SSRIs and SNRIs , due to interactions being fairly unknown, kinetics being defined only to a limited extent, and a pretty high serotonin toxicity risk with some of them. But I&#039;m a chicken.<br />- I am of a strong personal belief that tramadol plus an SSRI is not a good idea (also tramadol plus bupropion, for the record,&nbsp; is not a good idea.) Make your own decisions, but I wouldn&#039;t combine them. <br />- there&#039;s a credible case report of serotonin toxicity with 5-MeO-DMT + MAOI, another case report of rhabdo and possible serotonin toxicity with 5-MeO-DIPT.&nbsp; Would probably be careful with these. (Not judging... OK, judging... but taking novel drugs with MAOIs seems particularly ill-advised.)<br />- LSD is fine as far as interactions, but you won&#039;t get far; SSRIs are great at blocking its effect. Amazingly effective at blocking its effect.<br /><br />

				my advice? - get off SSRIs and pick up MAOIs, selegiline + moclobemide is the strongest/most effective anti-despressent combo with no noticeable downsides other then dietary restrictions.<br />MAOIs will actually increase your trip potential (doubling dose/duration - 4x for type b maois (selegiline) with phenylethamines (2c-b))<br /><br />as for your question:<br />GHB, benzos, Cocaine, amphetamines, weed, mdpv, barbiturates should all be unaffected by ssris.

				Ketamine as well. Works fine on them.<br /><br />Tried smoking 20 mg of DMT and felt nothing! I know it&#039;s a small dose, but that bummed me out, and didn&#039;t want to waste any more seeing if an increased dose would get me somewhere.<br /><br />Honestly don&#039;t listen to any of these random people saying to just get off the ssris.

				I have a question for Thyme or anyone else that can shed light,<br /><br />I have a question about the active metabolite in Sertraline, N-desmethylsertraline. The plasma half life is listed at 62-104 hours depending on metabolism. It&#039;s mentioned on the following site in which it is claimed as &quot;barely active as far as being a reuptake inhibitor...&quot; but &quot;may inhibit CYP2D6, which isn’t a big deal if you don’t take any other drug.&quot; What impact will this have on MDMA?<br /><br />Thanks <br /><br />(clearnet) http://www.crazymeds.us/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Meds/ZoloftPharmacokinetics#toc8<br /><br />§1.1  Plasma Half-Life<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sertraline hydrochloride has a plasma half-life of:Zoloft itself: 26 hours, give or take an hour. N-desmethylsertraline: 62–104 hours.<br />§1.2  Estimated Time Zoloft is Cleared/Eliminated from your System<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5–6 days.<br />§2.  How Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride) is Metabolized, and What the Effects and Results of the Metabolism are<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is what pharmacokinetics is all about. How a drug is metabolized in order to be eliminated / cleared from your body. If and how it is transformed into something else and what that is4. How it affects the metabolism of other meds5. To what extent everything is involved. E.g. by the time your liver and kidneys are through with it, 97% of Paxil (paroxetine HCl) has been converted to inactive stuff that gets flushed down the toilet, whereas 70% of the Topamax (topiramate) you take is unchanged in your urine. See the section on CYP450 and UGT enzymes on the Pharmacokinetics page for more details.<br />§2.1  Elimination Method<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zoloft gives new meaning to the term “extensively metabolized.” While CYP2C19 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 are responsible for metabolizing Zoloft into what you piss away, you only piss away about 60% of it. Zoloft is metabolized into another metabolite for elimination via the UGT system, by primarily by UGT2B7 with some help from 1A3, 1A6, 2B4.<br />§2.2  Transformation Method<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The quasi-active metabolite n-desmethylsertraline may not do much of anything, but your liver is certainly aware of it. In Sertraline Is Metabolized By Multiple Cytochrome P450 Enzymes, Monoamine Oxidases, And Glucuronyl Transferases In Human: An In Vitro Study the authors report CYP2C19, 2D6, 2C9, 2B6, and 3A4 are required to transform sertraline into desmethylsertraline (more-or-less agreeing with the results of this earlier study). After which CYP2C19, 3A4, 1A1, and 2E1 break it down so you can pee it out.<br />§2.3  Active Metabolites<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; None really. N-desmethylsertraline is barely active as far as being a reuptake inhibitor or anything like that. It may have an indirect impact on how Zoloft works including Zoloft’s effects on people with coronary problems. The researchers really like using it when testing both Zoloft’s PK data and the PK data of other meds.<br />N-desmethylsertraline may inhibit CYP2D6, which isn’t a big deal if you don’t take any other drug. Otherwise, that could complicate things.<br />§2.4  CYP450 or UGT Enzymes (sertraline hydrochloride) Inhibits/Induces/Suppresses<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The data are contradictory regarding whether or not Zoloft / desmethylsertraline are inhibitors of 2C9, 2D6, and/or 3A4; and to what extent they may inhibit those enzymes.<br />We try to list the above CYP/UGT/etc. in descending order of importance/extent of whatever the first one that does the most of the work to the one that does the least. That’s how it is on most PI sheets these days.

The magnitude of this contribution is probably too small to be clinically meaningful in most situations. However, desmethylsertaline like the major metabolites of fluoxetine and paroxetine is virtually equipotent to the parent SSRI as an inhibitor of specific CYP enzymes (Table 8.7). Hence, it would be expected to contribute to the magnitude of such an effect. Since its half-life (62 to 104 hours) is longer than that of the parent drug, it would also be expected to prolong the duration of the effect, but not to the extent that norfluoxetine does.288 The clinical impact of this fact is mitigated by the relatively weak inhibitory effect of sertraline and desmethylsertraline on specific CYP enzymes.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Look through the chapter on clin pharm for the tables, which include information on sertraline and metabolite effect on 2D6 function - it&#039;s very, very helpful (I think), for sertraline and a lot of other questions.

				Thank for that info and link Thyme.<br /><br />Considering N-desmethylsertraline continues to act as an equipotent 2D6 inhibitor, one would also wait 4-6 weeks (5 half-lifes) for the active metabolite of Sertraline to wash-out as there will also be a sharp increase in plasma levels that are dose dependent of any other substance consumed which is metabolized by the CYP2D6 pathway.&nbsp; <br /><br />So even if one could &quot;roll&quot; off MDMA after approx a week, and the marked depletion of serotonin still allowed you to do so, MDMA levels would be much higher. It is claimed that MDMA itself is not neurotoxic but it&#039;s metabolites that cause the neurotoxicty. <br /><br />People lacking the enzyme who have taken MDMA indicate it is metabolized by additional pathways, but the risk is still unknown whether the higher levels are dangerous.
