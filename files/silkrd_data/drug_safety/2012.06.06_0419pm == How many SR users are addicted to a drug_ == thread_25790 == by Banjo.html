				In another thread (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25640.0) it was theorized by Bynter that most SR users &quot;avoid addiction&quot;. Some people agreed with this, others said that there are probably a lot of addicts that use SR. I think it&#039;s an interesting question, so I thought I&#039;d run a poll to see what people consider themselves.

				It depends how you define drug. I&#039;m definitely addicted to coffee (caffeine) and I&#039;m definitely addicted to chocolate (Cadbury&#039;s only). <br /><br />With regards to the rest it depends how you define addiction. Is taking MDMA once a month addiction? Is taking is once a week addiction?

If you can&#039;t go for longer than X days without your drug of choice without experiencing anxiety, muscle cramps, nausea or other such symptoms, you have a chemical addiction. If you don&#039;t have these symptoms you don&#039;t have a chemical addiction, but you might have a mental addiction.

However, I guess I&#039;d exclude legal drugs (caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, etc...). I&#039;d just say answer based on what you feel to be the case for yourself.

				Addicted to cigarettes, but I get them from the store. Be gone with them! (Down to 6 a day)<br /><br />However, I answered moderate recreational user to relate to my psychedelic use and occasional night drinking.

				Mmmm, I love that nicotine! Apart from my pointless cigarette addiction, I smoke a lot of weed. I never want to stop of my own volitio cos it&#039;s too much fun, but I don&#039;t seem to have any problems stopping when I have to. So I&#039;m guessing more of a habit than an addiction.

				While I wouldn&#039;t consider myself physically addicted to any substance (besides nicotine, one of the worst!), I feel that I have a psychological addiction to marijuana.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t gone a day without smoking in about two years.&nbsp; It&#039;s expensive, but I rationalize it all of the time.&nbsp; I worry I wouldn&#039;t be such a chill, happy person if I didn&#039;t smoke weed once a day.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be so bad if I had a medical card and could get cheaper (and better) weed.&nbsp; I stay away from coke, meth, heroin, and other opiates because they scare me.&nbsp; Tried MDPV, and started feeling the symptoms of addiction very quickly, so I flushed it.&nbsp; Some people have expressed concern about my MXE use.&nbsp; I don&#039;t always have to have it, but when I do, I usually go through a gram in 10-20 days.&nbsp; If I feel cognitive or physical side effects from daily use, I take a break for a day or two until I&#039;m back to baseline.&nbsp; Then once I&#039;m out, I sometimes go a month or two without it.&nbsp; I&#039;m about to take a line right now after a tolerance break.&nbsp; ::)

				I think that most addicts won&#039;t admit it. With that said, I&#039;d consider myself a moderate to light user. This excuses legal stuff. I defiantly have a physical addition to caffeine and nicotine.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I answered as addicted, but not mainly depending on SR. I like my cigs, coffee and booze. Most of the time those are enough. <br /><br />Surely i also enjoy benzo&#039;s and on some occasions something stronger too, but that doesn&#039;t depend on SR, its merely a system to get them delivered conveniently at a premium price.

				It doesn&#039;t have to be that frequent though. Especially opiates can be addictive after a few or even a single dose. <br /><br />Drawing the line between physical and psychological dependence is very tricky. Perhaps you&#039;d think that feeling miserable without using is only a psychological matter, but the distinction between simply missing something and suffering withdrawal symptoms can be very fine.

Even in the case that an addiction causes no harm to the addict or his environment, the addict does not have control over his or her mind in regards to the addiction. I find it difficult to believe that this pattern of thinking in a human being can target only one thing (call it exercise, a drug, sex, etc), and left unchecked (even if it is benign), can eventually lead to problems in other areas of life. I think it is always important to be mindful of habits (mindful, not scared). <br /><br />I&#039;m not a professional in this matter. You&#039;re right that practically the question of whether or not someone is an addict /seems/ to be less meaningful when we&#039;re talking about a daily caffeine drinker, but in conclusion I don&#039;t think that this kind of analysis considers the whole picture.&nbsp; &nbsp;
