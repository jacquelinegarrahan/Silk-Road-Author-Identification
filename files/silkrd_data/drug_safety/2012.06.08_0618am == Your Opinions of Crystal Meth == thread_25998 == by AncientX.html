				So, im just wondering what the general feeling is with SR, How do you guys feel about hard drugs like Crystal meth?<br /><br />Are you a habitual user? or just a once in a while kinda guy?<br />Or do you despise that shit like miracle whip?<br />&nbsp;=D Torqued out of my mind on some good CM, so i thought id ask.

				Personally I think it&#039;s awful, and have seen lives ruined because of the stuff. But some people seem to enjoy it so cheers to them for finding happiness. ;D I&#039;ve tried it enough to know it&#039;s not for me, and no offense to any users on here but I&#039;d never associate myself with anyone who does it.

				gary, i agree. Im sorry AncientX. please dont take offense. But again, i took it for shits and giggles to know that i tried it, last week and yeah...all in all..not for me<br /><br />I can just like, FEEL likes its too misplaced for my body. There is too much after math and care needed for the body that i have to abandon it.<br /><br />I say after math and care because I always try to like...&quot;clean up&quot; the mess i make for whatever drug i go hard on...and this one easily, took the cake..for longest period of adjustment. way. too, harsh.<br /><br />

				To each there own. Honestly CM isnt my favorite drug, i think LSD, and E are my faves i&#039;d pick those over a bowl of dope anyday. <br /><br />But weed just doesnt do it for me anymore, and the clear focused high you get on amphetamines, like meth and adderall, make me feel really good, and boost my self-esteem aswell as make me productiv.<br /><br />But im in no means, saying &quot; If you dont do meth, your obviously not cool &quot; or anything like that lol.<br /><br />Everyone is free to enjoy w/e drugs. I just wanted peoples take on the Drug.<br />

				I&#039;ve smoked ice one or two times, I could see how people might enjoy it but it&#039;s not worth ruining your life over. I&#039;ve had friends get into it and it really changes them. Seeing them deteriorate physically and mentally is just very sad. A waste of a life.

				XD thats exactly how i explained Adderall and Ritalin to my Girlfriend hahahaha She&#039;s not a druggie, but she knows my habits and she&#039;s very relaxed about it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think she quite grasps what Crystal meth actually is, she thinks its Meth, Amphetamines, and other Phetamine Stimulants are all different chemicals and noway related to each other except by the fact there is Phetamine in the name lol. <br /><br />But she&#039;ll sit there and watch my roll my pipe every now and again, and just laughs when i exhale, lol. I get this retarded look on my face when i feel the dope actually hit me in those first few seconds of exhaling. XD its actually kinda cute/funny.

				I feel really lucky that I never noticed any unpleasant after effects for the 2.5 months I spent 3-4 days on 1-2 days off (usually 1).<br /><br />Really. Really. Lucky.<br /><br />I did sleep 10-12 hours a day for a while when I quit cold turkey, but the extra sleep (compared to my typical 5-7) just produced vivid, fascinating dreams, and while I was annoyed at sleeping so much I did understand why and so I accepted it peaceably and enjoyed the dreams until my sleep patterns returned to normal and I got a job to pay rent at the apartment I&#039;d moved into.<br /><br />I quit when I met two people who said &quot;You&#039;re living in your car? You can move in here, dude,&quot; the night I met them. They later entered my room at 4 am and the boy said &quot;My dad put $10,000 in an account and I have $800 in my wallet. We don&#039;t need you anymore, you have till the end of the day (which became 11 am) to get out.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed the fuck out of it, and only constant diligence and affirmations enabled me to walk away cleanly after diving in like I did. Not for hyper-addictive personalities!

				Hyper-addictive? You don&#039;t need to be hyper anything to get hooked on meth. o.o Its just, instantly addicting...the taste, the ritual, a good majority of the high ( after a while its kinda lame as fuck... ) i much prefer adderall, its much safer, i feel nearly the same high, and im not up for 1001347934793287493274921384712938749821 days at a time lol. But now that im actually having to pay for my habit, its just becoming very unappealing, an i think once this bag is gone. Im done :D i&#039;ve got about .3 left, and its getting used up throughout this weekend/nextweek

				It&#039;s very addictive psychologically once you start using because of the seemingly endless energy it gives you to both be able to work and play hard. Unfortunately when you start there is little in the way of any negative so it comes off as some kind of miracle drug... that is until what i call the honeymoon phase is over. This takes anywhere from 3-6months, after which it all catches up to you and at this point stopping becomes difficult for a lot of people.<br /><br />That said, if you trust yourself then i highly recommend trying it for a while. There&#039;s nothing quite like watching your mind fall off a cliff while being fully awake and alert after a 4-6 day run. The hallucinations are a lot better than the ones you&#039;ll get using psychedelics.<br /><br />

The act of going on just one 5 day run doesn&#039;t in itself make you a tweaker though. <br /><br />Just like everything else you can push the envelope and do it safely. I always do thorough research before embarking on a drug journey and get advice from other users and doctors. I also let friends know so that if anything were to happen they are around to check up on me or help me out if need me.<br /><br />Interestingly enough a doctor told me that meth OD&#039;s are very rare and that you have a much higher chance of dying dong coke. <br /><br />We all have our own limits that we are comfortable pushing and I&#039;ll be the first to tell you that on day 5 of a run if your haven&#039;t educated yourself enough about what could happen and how you&#039;re gonna deal with it when and if it does then don&#039;t take that trip.

				i had a fun time with crystal meth, doing it at parties for a year or so, but then i started needing it when my doc stopped prescribing me adderall.&nbsp; i was on break during a summer class i was taking at university on a tuesday afternoon and went to my car to snort some more meth; when i realized i was almost out my first thought was &quot;well, gotta call dude and get some more glass&quot; and my second thought was &quot;whoa, wait a minute....where does this end?&quot;&nbsp; well, i realized it ended with my addiction and subsequent death, so i stopped doing it all together.<br /><br />then a couple years later my friends and I threw this kick ass underground rave and I was really wanting to roll face but couldn&#039;t find any E.&nbsp; so that left me fiending for any kind of high and some kid offered me this gigantic line of meth for free because he was having such a great time at the party, and well, i couldn&#039;t resist.&nbsp; I was so fucking high for at least 12 hours off that line and while i was high I was wanting more but a good friend thankfully didn&#039;t hook me up with the meth dude again.&nbsp; Had a great time, but then for like 36 hours following I felt like absolute shit....like a 1989 chevy on its last few miles, barely able to move to a destination.&nbsp; <br /><br />that was the last time I ever did meth.&nbsp; i figured that if the crash lasted 3 times as long as the high, then it was definitely not worth doing.<br /><br />if you must partake, have fun with it; its a blast!&nbsp; but please, don&#039;t dedicate your life to amphetamines.&nbsp; i can guarantee 100% that you will have serious problems at some point as a result of your usage.

				^ Good story.<br /><br />As long as your safe, knowledgeable, and not a fucking idiot when it comes to moderation, doing amphetamines every now and again is definitely fun, But as you said....the crash lasts nearly 3 times as long as the high....Sometimes, just as long....and its fucking horrible....<br />At least with Crystal meth it is anyway.... I never experience any serious come down issues on adderall or ritalin, and those are mild amphetamines. <br /><br />The come down on meth, is like somone poured cold water into my lungs, and made every inch of your body restless and uncomfortable. Its not an achy feeling...just more of a &quot; ugh....who replaced my blood and air with sludge and exhaust fumes? &quot; <br /><br />Also, to add a bit more info on my personal experience with the come down, trying to lay down, and just remain calm and still while you pray to god your body just detoxes the everloving fuck out of&nbsp; your system quickly , is very difficult, i found my self sitting in the same position, no matter where i was at in the house, if i wasnt sitting a certain way, that fucking comedown would play havoc on my senses.

				How is the high compared to coke? I know it lasts longer but is it more intense more euphoric?<br /><br />Also recent experience with adderall , took 100mg in 1 day took 2 days to recover.

				O.o Well...it honestly depends how you get the crystal into your system...if you inject it, i hear thats the best high possible from it....and then there&#039;s snorting. I&#039;ve only ever smoked it, and the high is alot clearer than coke, and you definitely have more energy....But i wouldnt reccomend trying it if you&#039;ve never done it =/ its just best to never get involved with it.

				So if 20mgs of xanax wont end your life(like it didnt do mine)<br /><br />whats a good way, just in case Im ever comfronted with the necessity to end it, my life that is<br /><br />it was actually a strange situation, the suicide decision<br /><br />on the one hand, the devil over myy left shoulder, saying my life is shit, a vomit reflex, no happiness will ever come your way again<br />but then on the right hand shoulder the angle, it was kindd of the oriental thought, the do the honorable samari death, dont let your enemies grind a shit bomb into your pride and soul<br /><br />the oriental samari way of suicide is one of ultimate victory over your enemy(satan) Look at me I am glory, I wont let you make me eat shit, I choose to take my life.......so&nbsp; thought the xanax would do the trick, it didnt<br /><br /><br />anyways, if there ever is a next time how many xanax do I need to take, or whats the best drug to take to do the deed

				Labrat disagrees with some of the negative stereotypes associated with traditional users. He has been using 5 years. <br />* Eating went to IN went to smoking went to IV.&nbsp; <br />* Frequent (daily) sessions went to infrequent almighty BINGES (monthly).<br />* 2 times hospitalized for OD, 1 time rehabilitated<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; Got an adderall script out of the process for adult ADHD. This was the biggest reason for the daily&gt;monthly transition.<br />* Lost a gf, found a better one. Lost his job to absenteeism, but finished his Bee.S. degree and got a new one.<br /><br />Methamphetamine is a substance with immense recreational, therapeutic, and abuse potential. You can&#039;t expect to toke from the sucking tube and not get burnt occasionally, but it&#039;s always in your power to move your fingers away.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
