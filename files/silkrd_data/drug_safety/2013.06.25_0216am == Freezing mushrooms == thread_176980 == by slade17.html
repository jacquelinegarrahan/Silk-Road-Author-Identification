				After some research I&#039;ve decided that sticking dried shrooms in a vacuum sealed bag in a deep-freeze is probably the best way to store them. That said, I&#039;m wondering how to go about the day of consumption.<br /><br />If they&#039;re dried, they shouldn&#039;t actually be &#039;frozen&#039; right? Will I just be able to cut them out of the bag and eat them? Should I take them out the night before or something and let them thaw?

				Since there&#039;s practically no water, you should just let it sit at room temp for 20-30 before consumption.<br />Powdering your &#039;shrooms, even before freezing, seems to help the shelf-life.

				I remember reading somewhere that freezing mushrooms that still contain water will lead to the decomposition of the alkaloids it contains when you un-freeze them.&nbsp; I think it was on erowid that I read this, cannot confirm it for now.<br /><br />In any case fresh mushrooms in a freezer is a no-no. <br />I&#039;m not sure about dried mushrooms but if you took the time to dry and store them properly (with silica gel - always the best) there is hardly any need to put them in the freezer.<br /><br />Properly dried and stored mushrooms can last from 6 month to 1 year.<br /><br />If you feel like you have too many just give them away at a party.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good way to make friends/find customers/get laid as well.<br />After all it&#039;s not like growing mushrooms is that hard.&nbsp; whenever I have too many and I don&#039;t know what to do with them, I won&#039;t let them linger too long because sales are slow so I just hit a good rave and hand them out.<br />That&#039;s how a friend of mine met his girlfriend :p

				I definitely don&#039;t have too many, but I want them to stay potent. I&#039;ll be using them in the next two months for sure.<br /><br />I already froze them, and I remember once hearing that if you DO put them in the freezer, not to take them out until you&#039;re ready to eat them or they will go bad faster. So, I guess they&#039;re stuck there. I probably could have just kept them in a dark corner of the basement, but it&#039;s too late now.

				Oh well, let us know when you do take them out, if you remember!<br /><br />Anyway just dry them it&#039;s fine.&nbsp; Often in the packaging of small electronics you&#039;ll have a little baggie of silica.&nbsp; Stash it!&nbsp;

				Properly dried mushrooms (and vacuum-packed) don&#039;t need to be frozen, just keep them in somewhere cool and dry. If you keep it too long, it might turn a bit darker, it might lose some potency, but it will not go bad.
