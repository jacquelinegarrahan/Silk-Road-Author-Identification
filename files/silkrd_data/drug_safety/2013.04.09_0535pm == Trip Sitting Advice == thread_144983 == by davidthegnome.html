				That&#039;s commendable of you, I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t be more help. I&#039;d be happy to have a friend who went this out-of-their way to be a good trip sitter. <br /><br />I would think having some weed on hand for the first response, can help calm / uplift someone tripping.<br />As for anti-psychotics, I&#039;d suggest just poking around the forums for how to help a bad trip.

				I find that if they are in a very good mood at the time of intake, there&#039;s less chance of anxiety/panic.<br />Like everyone said, benzos are the way to go.<br />One time when I did 25i and was having a really bad trip, my friend helped me a lot by having me take a warm shower then watch a movie. But that&#039;s a different drug and I&#039;m a different person so...&nbsp; :o<br />Karma to you for being a good friend though! (well eventually, I can&#039;t give karma points yet lol)<br />

				The goal of the trip sitter should be to influence the tripping person and help but only when needed. Just a little push into the right direction. <br />Sedatives should be a last resort and if you need them your not really a good sitter!<br />What you need is to create an environment for the tripper that is peaceful and problem free. <br />If the tripper encounters a problem inside himself he should be reminded that this is only the effect of a drug. It will pass and all this is in the mind. A hug or other kind of physical contact should work better than sedatives. In egoless situations sometimes all the tripper needs is a reminder that he is not alone! <br /><br />The tripper will pick up any unfriendly vibes coming your way so you need to be honest. Honest about your fears and your lack of experience. If you are not, the tripper will get confused maybe even misinterpret your body language and this could lead to disasters. <br />&nbsp;<br />What i recommend is that you trip a day or two before your friend does. Even a tiny treshold dose will do. This is to get on the level of your friend. So communication is more flawless and comfortable. <br />A trip sitter in the afterglow of the chemical is the best trip sitter ever. <br /><br />Talk with your friend, sober. Before tripping.&nbsp; Look him in the eye. Tell him everything he needs to know about you. Tell him your honest story so he will have a good picture of you. Lots of time the paranoia of the other is a wrecker. He needs to know everything. your sexuality, your goal in life, your religious views. everything!<br /><br />Be Happy. don&#039;t do it if you are depressed. Its going to hurt both of you. <br />try to have fun with him, make him talk about what he sees, read him poetry, change the music if needed, bring him water, food, show him trippy pictures, draw with him, play musical instruments...<br />anything that is fun should be involved in a trip!!<br />That is the goal.<br />Make It Fun!

				Thanks road family! I appreciate the responses. <br />I like that there is both practical advice as well as advice on which meds to administer. <br /><br />I have been on a quest to round off my experience with dealing with these type of issues.<br />Been trying to do things correctly and wisely. I learned a lot of hard lessons in my youth due to lack of discipline and I have been doing things differently on the rebound. <br /><br />I think I may post my findings once I feel like I have a decent amount of info on this subject.<br /><br />On other forums I have seen Valium as a good option for bringing you back closer to baseline. And a natural alternative Valerian as well. But as I said before I hope to post specifics once I&#039;ve done my research.<br /><br />Thanks again for the responses :D

				For bad trips, a change in scenery can go a long way. Take a walk, encourage some artistic activity (have some playdough or other medium on hand), try a bath/shower, etc. This is especially helpful during loops!<br /><br />Be especially aware at your own reaction and tone of voice. A worried look is enough for a nasty crash. Practice your smiles and mantras in the mirror.

If you cant do this you have failed.<br />Sedatives are very handy but they destroy the psychedelic experience.<br />The trip should be finished, even if its going bad. The end of the journey is just as important as the plateau. <br />People can learn very valuable lessons from bad trips.<br /><br />If its going really bad I would <br />- ensure that the tripper cant do harm to himself or his surroundings<br />- I would try to calm him, try to make him realize the illusion.<br />- change the incoming signals (like music)<br />- try to get his attention (read him stories from books, tell him to talk about it)<br />- physical contact <br />etc<br />We got a lot of possibilities. Short term memory is very fucked when you are tripping. use this to your advantage. Lots of ways to influence the flow. <br /><br />But on second thought... <br />You&nbsp; should keep sedatives around. Just in case. Just the presence of a sedative could tip the trip into a better vibe. It gives a feeling of safety. <br />

				A number of good pieces of advice here which I&#039;ll second:<br /><br />- Know your ward and let him/her know you; ensure there are no negative feelings<br />- Secure a safe environment with no surprises<br />- Be conscious of your cues - you can scare them with concern<br />- You&#039;re the safety net, not a trip guide - hands off till needed<br /><br />That said, I would add:<br /><br />- It may be difficult to know when you&#039;re needed, so check in.<br />- No practical jokes. It shouldn&#039;t need to be said but I&#039;m saying it.<br />- Ideally, have experience with the drug(s) your ward is going to use. This can help immeasurably, and will also help establish trust between you two.<br />- Talk through any of your ward&#039;s concerns before the trip. Ensure they&#039;re not scared but making themselves go through with it.<br />- Be a gnome! How cool would that be? I see you have this covered.<br /><br />I agree that you can learn a lot from a dark trip, but if the person is expecting to work through difficulties, I would hope these would come up in your pre-trip conversation. Because otherwise you can&#039;t know if your ward is getting worked up about things that are in actuality perfectly ok.<br /><br />Good on you for doing this, and moreover, for taking it seriously.

				Relaxation/Meditation music and a gentle massage will steer almost everyone into the right direction. And the one thing that has to be a given and is mentioned over and over again when it comes to tripping, (mind)set and setting (environment). If that&#039;s right, the chance of a bad trip is eliminated by a high percentage.<br />Hope that helps.
