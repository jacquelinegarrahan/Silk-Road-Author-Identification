				I am a new smoker and just got some dank ass blue dream and felt so fucked up it was crazy. Could hear heart beating really fast Tunnel vision, time slowed down so much that as we were in the car I felt like we were repeating over and over. Sounds were at times so loud I thought I would pass out. I could hear people talk from far away like they were right there. my vision kinda split into three rectangles, I felt like I was looking out of the eyes of a mouse with everything black around the hole. Over all it was kinda scary I felt like I was gonna die at times and I was very paranoid. I went to a crowded place and heard almost everyone say or thought they said is that guy high later I was told that I was just hearing things. But overall it was hell and I was crazy paranoid. Now I know that the weed was not laced but was just wondering could it be that I smoked to much for a noob? If so should I still smoke blue dream I know it&#039;s really strong stuff? Thanks alpine

				I&#039;m assuming your not an every day toker? I&#039;ve never had, or heard of, a high like that. I&#039;ve quit smoking for long periods of time before and came back to smoking really dank nugs, or wax in one case, and it&#039;s definitely a different high than when I have a tolerance but the most extreme thing would probably be my uncontrollable laughter in a public restaurant/bar, something I miss from weed which I smoke every day normally but all it really does is relax me and if a smoke a lot then give a slight numbness to everything and make everything a bit more interesting.

				An old college friend of mine had a week-long panic attack after smoking some exceptionally potent herb.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t laced and he had anxiety issues beforehand: it was just the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve smoked shit that had me paralyzed and seeing the world in 2D cartoon colors a couple of times.&nbsp; So experiences like yours aren&#039;t unheard of. Hell, I&#039;d say they&#039;re not uncommon at all for people who just smoked really good herb for the first time.&nbsp; Paranoia, weird visuals,&nbsp; time-loops... all these have been noted with high doses of THC.&nbsp; <br /><br />How much Blue Dream did you smoke in one sitting?&nbsp; I generally use a one-hitter/bat when sampling any new herb and take no more than two hits.&nbsp; That gives me an idea of potency, taste and effect so that I avoid hitting myself in the head with a reefer-scented baseball bat.

				I tried something similar.<br /><br />Mate and made some hash pancakes, which we ate. Worked well, though I wanted more, so I ate the remainder. Really bad idea.<br /><br />I concur that going to a crowded space seemed like a bad thing. What I did was to go into a dark bedroom, and lied down on a bed. The panic attack passed, and I was OK after a few hours.

				First time I got Blue Dream is was a relatively sativa leaning crop and I pretty much felt like &quot;Oh wow, this is remarkably clear for how physically medicating it is...&quot;<br /><br />Since then, I&#039;ve tried ever more sativa leaning Blue Dream and I love it for the fact that it relieves pain without fucking me up.

				I think bad weed &#039;trips&#039; and panic attacks happen to all smokers. I had a massive one about 1 and half years ago. had PTSD and de-realization for about 3/4 months after so smoking bud during this time wasn&#039;t an option.. Remember its only a drug and a plant. Millions of people light up everyday :) Also, if you feel this happening again, take a Valium or Xanax, it&#039;ll will for sure help! <br />If you need someone to talk to about it who knows exactly what you&#039;re on about, PM me bro :)

				when someone without an extreme tolerance to weed smokes too much they start to what is called &#039;zone&#039; which could definitely be considered unpleasant by a non pot head. i agree, add a benzo if youre anxious but wanna continue smoking

				I have had much the same experience the first times I was smoking (and eating) cannabis, about 7 years ago.<br />Haven&#039;t tried it since then until a year ago, now any negative symptoms no longer appear.<br /><br />The one great difference between then and now in my case was that I have stopped drinking alcohol, I was drinking quite a lot (let&#039;s say 1/2 bottle of vodka and 3-10 pints a day).<br /><br />So maybe you were drinking before or while smoking? I know of other people who also told me that especially first timers should not drink alcohol when smoking/eating (I fully agree with one of the posters above, eating too much is 1) easy because of the rather long time it takes to show any effects, 2) worse than smoking too much).<br /><br />I would suggest to not drink alcohol in case you were, and take some time before trying again, maybe find some friend who is more experienced and can reassure you when you are feeling bad. Going out on your first tries also doesn&#039;t sound like a good idea, I at least wouldn&#039;t have had the guts to go out, probably wouldn&#039;t have been able to ;) .<br />I guess if you try too often with negative experiences you will never be able to smoke, which would be a shame.

				^ Agree with that. The one and only time I crashed from smoking strong weed was also in conjunction with drinking alcohol at the same time. I was burning a joint of Super Silver Haze when that was all the rage about a decade ago in a little coffeeshop called The Greenhouse Effect in Amsterdam, with a Heineken as a back. I was sitting on a bar stool talking to random people and I was overtaken by tunnel vision. I slumped over onto the bar still conscious but unable to see and feeling extremely groggy and moving very slowly. <br /><br />The bartender, an English kid, knew what to do. She brewed up a cup of sugary tea and they coaxed me into taking sips of it through a straw. Turns out what i&#039;d been experiencing was a fairly common occurrence to weed smokers in Amsterdam.<br /><br />It was an insulin crash. The combination of strong weed and cheap sugar from the alcohol causes your body to overproduce insulin. The insulin rush over-metabolizes all of the carbohydrates in your system and you crash.<br /><br />The sugary tea worked and I slowly regained my bearings. Luckily, I was also staying at the greenhouse effect&#039;s hotel so I quit partying and wandered up the stairs to my room. I did thank the bartender profusely the next day.

				Yeah was kinda scary but Looking back I guess it was not that bad. When I went out everybody I past was saying is that guy high? Must of heard that like 50 times. Kinda embarrassing but funny at the same time.<br /><br /><br />@ opomguy <br />Now that you mention that I had way to much soda. Must of went though an intire case in a weekend. I am guessing that could be that same with all the sugars in soda?<br /><br />

				I know the feeling man - weed is no joke.&nbsp; In my opinion, in moderation, it is one of the strongest drugs out there.&nbsp; The first time I smoked I had a very similar experience to yours (not the first time I smoked, the first time I truly got high).&nbsp; Was walking in the woods with buddies, then everything started to move in slow motion, I would think things like &quot;I wonder whats down that trail&quot; and would then realize I was half way down it away from my friends.&nbsp; <br /><br />I turned into a habitual weed head for the following 10 years, smoking all day everyday until my mid 20&#039;s.&nbsp; I still smoke semi-regularly, but nowhere like back then.<br /><br />In my area, we get exceptional weed - I&#039;d be willing to bet some of the best in the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />This experience has happened twice, the 2nd time was far more frightening, and happened last year.&nbsp; At the time, I was smoking a bowl every night around 7 or so.&nbsp; My buddy had some bomb ass hash.&nbsp; I went to his house, took one hit, and have never in my life been as high as it got me.&nbsp; I was freaking out, having thought loops, felt like I was on some good acid (seeing patterns of vibrant colors with my eyes closed, kept saying &quot;oh shit, this is why weed is illegal&quot;, THE BEST PART - I was proud, because I thought I was going to be the first case of someone dieing from weed :) <br /><br />After I freaked the fuck out for a good 2 hours, I looked at my friend (that was watching me dripping sweat and pale as a ghost) and said thank you for getting me high like I was 15 again.&nbsp; He saved the voicemail I left him later that night and plays it to make fun of me all the time.&nbsp; Still a reg smoker.&nbsp; Don&#039;t smoke hash anymore :)

				Wow, that high sounds like kind of a bummer. I remember getting super baked in high school when I first started smoking, but nothing like what you are describing. Honestly, pot isn&#039;t for everyone. I&#039;m a daily, well...hourly smoker, lol. It just works for me. But my best friend of 19 years? That girl cannot smoke at ALL. I got her stoned ONE time and she laughed, then she cried (not as in laughed until she cried, I mean crying like a baby), then she blacked out and fell off of the couch. Then she woke up, said she was thirsty and asked what happened. That was when we were in our late teens, I had already been smoking for years. She freaked me out, freaked herself out, and she decided it just wasn&#039;t for her. Maybe start slow and smoke something a little more mellow and not as dank, but if you still have a bad experience, pot just might not be your thing.

				LOL been there.<br /><br />At one point I had quit weed for about 3 months, that was the longest I had gone since I started I think.&nbsp; A friend of mine popped in with some bubble hash and some amazing weed.&nbsp; I figured, hey, my tolerance was pretty much zero at that point, so this was my chance to see just HOW high I could get.&nbsp; We stuffed a bowl with a bit of both, and I swear to god, I tripped balls for about 2 hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />My depth perception was the first thing to go, leaving me with that 2D feeling.&nbsp; Then colors started to shimmer, and the light in the room was way too bright.&nbsp; I started to panic a little, because the last time I had tripped had been pretty fucking hectic, and I wasn&#039;t quite ready to return to that mental space.&nbsp; My heart tried to beat right out of my chest, I was on the verge of hyperventilating, and the colors just got steadily more and more vivid.&nbsp; Luckily I was still lucid enough to work on steadying my breathing, and I just withdrew for a while until I regained some fucking sense.&nbsp; All in all it was a pretty amazing experience, to feel a weed high on such a tremendous level.&nbsp; I just wasn&#039;t prepared for it at all, and it made me panic somewhat.

				If you&#039;re prone to anxiety or psychotic disorders a high dosage of THC is a bad idea. Shit I&#039;ve smoked some of the most evil hash oil I&#039;ve ever made like it was nothing and slowed down for awhile and can barely finish a bowl of mids without getting weird and paranoid.

				I once experienced something very similar. I wasn&#039;t an experienced toker back then. I was alone at home, feeling depressed so I decided that &quot;a little&quot; herb would help me out. Boy, was I wrong. I did 2 massive bong rips of a pretty potent herb. Big mistake. When I started to feel the effects rapidly, I knew it was going to turn into a bad trip. I had a massive panic attack, I played some music, but it felt like nails being hammered in my ears, my vision was reaaaly weird, I was super paranoid and my fingers were numb. Very unpleasant. I was really scared and I just walked around with a cup of water in my hand in a zombie-like state praying for it to stop. All this walking could have taken an hour or so. Then I started to come down. I was relieved. I hadn&#039;t touched herb for 6 months after this experience. Now, 2-3 years later I enjoy a crazy trip like this :) Back then, it turned bad because I wasn&#039;t expecting anything like that to happen and I was in a fairly bad mindset. :)

				What happened here looks like the paranoia what can be felt if the weed is not properly dried. It has been dried too quick. Chemical processes have still change some substances. Take your time and let the weed dry slowly. Sometimes some of those chemical processes can be started again by so called curing, but that is mostly for the sugars and. If the changing of those substances responsible for paranoia are stopped, it looks like they are caught in the process and can be active for a long time. Three weeks till one months waiting before smoking is the best option to get rit of the paranoia feeling. It is mostly common in the oily thc buds. You have smoked your weed just to fresh! Oily buds that have spend 3 and a half moth of drying and is oily will not give the paranoia feeling. But That means that you will harvest before October or the early days of October and will be smoking if the winter starts , a few days before Christmas. Sure you can dry your weed in three weeks, but that is total wrong. I have been on a trip to Ketama in Morocco, and there is only started with making the weed ready in February, so long after Christmas. For the same season. The hash would give the user of paranoia. Weed is of a bad strain over there. Full seeds and called kiff. That&#039;s what happened. Smoking fresh weed can give those paranoia feelings quite easy. I think that over 50 % of all modern strains give a uneasy feeling, the opposite of relaxing, the feeling you want to get. And not familiar with this feeling will scare the victim user even more. Know what is happening in your body, an d try to relax. Sticky fingers can be a indycation that you are dealing with a weed that has not been properly dried and brought on the market to to sell within 3 weeks after harvesting. A garanty to meet mr; &quot;&quot;Flip de pan uit&quot;&quot;. I just wrote what to be the case, but only in my opinion based on justments of experience, but my conclusions are not scientifficly proven.<br />Let that be clear.<br /><br />Wasta

				I&#039;ve had some freak outs on weed. Back when i smoked cigarettes, seems like in a day where i smoked too many leading up to getting some weed in the evening finally would like tigger this response where i&#039;d start to sweat allover my body, head to toe just beaded with sweat, then nausea followed by vomiting, would only start to feel better after i&#039;d been sick, maybe blunt skins mixed with too many marlboro red&#039;s or natural american spirits. Another time after having been up for a stretch on ice and not having smoked bud in six months i hit like 2 bowls of this jack herer hydro,&nbsp; so i got stoned as all get out, so stoned i thought my buddy dosed me with some kind of psychedelic.&nbsp;

				Try to pick up a few meditative techniques to relax and calm yourself down. Slow and deep breathing through your nose and ensuring muscles are relaxed (particularly shoulders) helps a lot. When I am in that stage I hold my arms out to the side and I can feel that above them, things are relaxing, below them things are tense and uncomfortable. Its like being in a hole and slowly pulling yourself out of it. Make sure you do it slowly and if you find youself sinking, don&#039;t panic just relax and slow down.<br /><br />The worst thing you can do is start panicking because once you&#039;re that high, all you can do is ride it out. Treat everything as an experience to build and learn from, force a smile, tell yourself that this just happens to be where the high is now and it will soon turn around and become fun again. Trying to control things is really where it starts getting worse quicker, let go and allow anything to happen.

				I smoked weed daily for months before I had my first panic attack. Except at the time I didn&#039;t know it was a panic attack, I was convinced I was dying and no reassurance from my friends could make me feel otherwise. I could literally feel the sensation of having a heart attack over and over again and, even worse, every 20 seconds it felt like there was pressure building up in my head and that it was on the verge of exploding. On top of all that, my mind was fucked. I experienced what I guess is considered ego loss in that I &quot;forgot who I was&quot; (that&#039;s what I kept saying to my friends, anyway). I could still remember my name and stuff, but I didn&#039;t feel like a distinctive &quot;person&quot;. In retrospect, I wish I could have enjoyed that ego loss because it is what so many people hope to obtain through meditation/drugs, but at the time I didn&#039;t know what the fuck was going on or why I was freaking out and yet my friends were fine. The first panic attack is always the worst because you don&#039;t realize that it&#039;s all in your head.<br /><br />I think there are many forms of panic attacks you can have from weed. People who have never had a panic attack don&#039;t really understand what they are like and how they can be really difficult to control. If I had seen some one freaking out in the way I did before I had experienced my own panic attack I probably would have thought they were just being stupid. Weed seems like such a tame drug but it can definitely catch you by surprise.

				People use OD for those really intense and overwhelming experiences because it&#039;s easy, not because it&#039;s right.<br /><br />A weed &quot;OD&quot; is not like a normal OD.

				I can understand feeling sick but the trippy effects being described are a little strange. I guess a very strong sativa could do the trick and I do remember smoking some stuff in Amsterdam which was intense but I wouldn&#039;t compare it to a bad LSD trip - some of which can be very scary indeed. <br /><br />I don;t thing people think enough about the indica /sativa mix and THC content when buying weed. Depending on the type of grass the effects can differ greatly. Indica and Sativa varieties can be as different in effect as different entirely classes of narcotics IMO. <br /><br />I&#039;m a sativa man myself. Not into couch-lock.

				Once, on a high amount of cannabis, as the high was just starting to wear off, I began experiencing general malaise and tiredness,<br />and after a while it passed into a very weird sort of semi-dissociative state where everything felt intensely sitcomey for 20-30 minutes.<br />Fortunately I was not in a situation that demanded anything of me, and it was at least as interesting as it was scary, so I was not particularly fearful.<br />But I realized (during the experience) that something like this would probably really freak out most people who were not expecting it.
