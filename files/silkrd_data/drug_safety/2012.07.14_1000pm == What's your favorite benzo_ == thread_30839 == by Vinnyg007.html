				I&#039;m just curious as to what a few members here think about benzos. I think my favorite might be Klonopin. I really dislike Xanax, it&#039;s not very subtle and is more of a drunk feeling. I like that I can take a Klonopin at night and feel decent the next day. <br /><br />Klonopins are tasty. I like to suck on a Klonopin. Minty... <br /><br />I really have been digging etizolam lately but I was taking it at night with Ambien and Seroquel and the experience is very hypnotic and is a guaranteed mini-blackout. Etizolam is really hypnotic and it has a weird anti-depressant effect.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried a bit of temazepam with Ambien, etizolam, and Seroquel the other night and don&#039;t remember a damn thing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got some Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, Valium, Ambien and etizolam lying around. I want to get some rophynol, temazepam and nitrazepam, zoplicone and some phenobarbital. <br /><br />Man, Ambien is a fucked up drug. I&#039;ll take it and just be hypnotized for a few hours and watch TV and eat a bunch of cereal. <br /><br />I like having a variety of benzos at hand for different situations. For example: my psychiatrist wouldn&#039;t prescribe me benzos so I got a shit ton of etizolam. It doesn&#039;t show up on drug screens and is unscheduled. He didn&#039;t even know what etizolam was and seemed a little butthurt that I managed to circumvent his advice and beat the system. <br /><br />What&#039;s your favorite benzo?

				Xanax is definitely fun, but in a drunk way like you said. I haven&#039;t been able to try Klonopin yet, but I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s great. <br /><br />My advice for the Ambien- pop 25mg or so,&nbsp; and smoke a lot of weed. You can get some pretty cool hallucinations. Inanimate objects look like they&#039;re moving, and TV starts to look 3-D.

				I liked valium the best.&nbsp; I have tried klonopin, xanax, valium, etizolam and ambien.<br /><br />Valium gave me a very relaxing body high, way more so than the rest even at way lower dosages as shown in the benzo chart on wiki.&nbsp; Etizolam and klonopin just relieve anxiety, no high.&nbsp; Xanax fucks me up, but doesn&#039;t feel as good as valium and is less functional.&nbsp; Ambien is just boring IMO.

				I&#039;ve tried a lot of Benzo&#039;s and considering it&#039;s H/L, Xanax is the most preferable. <br />Valium is the crappiest of them all staying in your system almost a week at a time, total useless for recreational use!<br /><br />I like Ambien for it&#039;s extremely short half life although sometimes I feel the effect of Ambien for a lot longer, almost as long as Xanax!<br />I detoxed from Benzo&#039;s for a week and then I took some Ambien for a flight back home. <br />I took two tablets, 20mg (having previously only ingested 10mg) on my way to the airport and something very strange happened:<br /><br />I can&#039;t recall saying goodbye to my parents or my girlfriend, I can&#039;t recall going through customs at either end or the whole flight, picking up my luggage or even the trip home from the airport!<br />I suffered partial amnesia and only realized this when I looked at my phone the next day. I took various videos and photos while I was on the plane and of my family at the airport that I don&#039;t<br />remember at all! This was a really fucking awesome (in)experience and I&#039;m glad I managed to get home safe with all my belongings. But I won&#039;t do that again, I already suffer ridicule from my <br />short term memory because of my weed smoking habit so I can do without amnesia inducing benzo&#039;s or the 20mg dosage of it at least.

				Personally, I enjoy Clonazepam the most. It lasts long without going into the Diazepam-esque crazy half life.<br /><br />Xanax is fun and seems the most euphoric benzo to me, but I&#039;m really wary of taking Xanax long term. Due to it&#039;s extremely short half life, xanax wears off quickly compared to most other benzos and this leads to redosing periodically for a lot of people, and that ultimately can lead to benzo addiction.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used benzos safely for years and always make sure I cut back if I take too many in a short period of time. You do not want to become addicted to benzos!! Benzo withdrawal can be fatal. Always taper down when you are quitting benzos after taking them long term; ideally with a physician monitoring your progress.

				IV diazepam, bitches. But I don&#039;t do that anymore... too many waking up hours later thinking the fuuuuuuuck did I do? I tried some temazepam for the first time last night, and it was nice. I can&#039;t really tell much of a difference between benzos when taken orally and at comparable dosages (except for their duration of action).

				Xanax and Valium. I use them only after I trip on LSD or roll out on MDMA. I use them to relax and fall asleep. They&#039;re both part of my utility drug box that I keep around for safety. I&#039;ve got a few anti-psychotics as well just in case I have a terrible trip.<br /><br />I never take more than one pill of Xanax, or two pills of Valium. Not interested in being fucked up after a night of having fun on other drugs. Just need to knock myself out.<br /><br />Before I had benzos, I would take double the dose of recommended NyQuil to knock myself out. Tasted fucking terrible. Swallowing a pill is so much easier.

I usually pop 1(sometimes 2)mg depending on the circumstances. I&#039;ve tried Clonazepam (Rivitrol) 2mg a few times recreationaly, but I find that its anxiolytics properties are the same as that for Xanax, which I find little recreational pleasure out of. <br /><br />Now I&#039;ve been prescribed Dormicum (Midazolam) -Roche-&nbsp; 15mg&nbsp; (Which is primarily a hypnotic benzo) for my insomnia, to induce sleep, and boy does it! I&#039;ve discovered that I (and this is only a personal opinion so dont bash me! lol) find benzos with hynotic properties to be much more recreational. The first time I popped a Dormicum pill 15mg half an hour before sleep while watching tv, I was knocked out and woke up the next morning on the couch, and I fell in love with it instantly.&nbsp; I was amazed by its ability to induce amnesia, total body relaxation and sedation and the knock out effect, coupled with a very reasonable half life 3-4hours (with no groggy hangover effects the next morning). A couple of days later I scored some good hash, and decided to smoke up one afternoon and I took half a pill 1 hour prior to smoking up. The hypnotic/trance like feel was brilliant to say the least.<br /><br />I must warn that its one of those benzo&#039;s that would most definitely induce amnesia, and cause a blackout. I&#039;ve let some of my friends try it while they smoked up and they absolutely loved it. Hands down my fav benzo so far. <br /><br />I know that its not available in pills form in the US but it is in many other countries, and I hope we&#039;ll be seeing more of it around on SR :)

Only problem is that I&#039;ve seen the listings on SR for the prices of Midazolam and its waaaaaay much more than what I pay for when prescribed by my doctor. I live in a country where such prescribed medications are subsidized by the government, therefor I end up paying less than a tenth of the price listed by some SR vendors. So practically its cheaper for me to pay a doctors fee, and buy the midazolam from a pharmacy than having to buy it off SR, which I&#039;ll stick to for now :) <br /><br />But yeah, Midazolam is a benzo I would HIGHLY recommend if you get your hands on some :) its def one of the most potent benzo&#039;s out there, and the prescribed dose is more than enough for recreational use lol

				I have taken most benzo&#039;s since often times I do have months where I feel alot of depression &amp; or anxiety. Personally I prefer xanax because not only does it kick in fast but once I am in a better mood I am in a very good place. <br /><br />I took some K-pin&#039;s once, ironically got pulled over after drinking at a bar that night thinking fuck I am going to go to jail for a DUI but I didn&#039;t feel any emotion about that except w/e my own fault for being dumb. Somehow I didn&#039;t get a DUI or anything but I really didn&#039;t like the lack of feeling I had for 12-24 hrs from 2 K-pins.

				medazepam for relaxation... tofisopam for stimulation.. these are the best benzos for me from the whole bunch i tried. Also triazolam for sleep and zolpidem too ( it&#039;s z drug ) so not exactly benzo. You can get hallucination from zolpidem thats a bonus. And some say its very pleasurable shooting it feels like cocaine ( I don&#039;t believe that though).<br /><br />here&#039;s a quote:<br /><br />&quot;last night was my first time with this medication. I had 10, 10mg pills. I was actually intending to use them for sleep so I ate 2. After what I would guess was 2 hours I was not that tired so I went to trying IV. Each time I shot it got crazier and crazier. I was literally tripping. My restroom would go from normal to a jungle, to me being sherlock holmes. Always seeing myself in the mirror but thinking I was another person who was actually replying to my questions. This was all very short lasting and was mostly done by the time I cleaned up the shot. I ended staying up all night injecting the rest of the pills and never actually getting sleepy. My arms look like shit today&quot;<br /><br />hahaha good stuff zolpidem is but i wouldn&#039;t inject pills well only on very special occasion like hydromorphone or something.:)

I usually pop 1(sometimes 2)mg depending on the circumstances. I&#039;ve tried Clonazepam (Rivitrol) 2mg a few times recreationaly, but I find that its anxiolytics properties are the same as that for Xanax, which I find little recreational pleasure out of. <br /><br />Now I&#039;ve been prescribed Dormicum (Midazolam) -Roche-&nbsp; 15mg&nbsp; (Which is primarily a hypnotic benzo) for my insomnia, to induce sleep, and boy does it! I&#039;ve discovered that I (and this is only a personal opinion so dont bash me! lol) find benzos with hynotic properties to be much more recreational. The first time I popped a Dormicum pill 15mg half an hour before sleep while watching tv, I was knocked out and woke up the next morning on the couch, and I fell in love with it instantly.&nbsp; I was amazed by its ability to induce amnesia, total body relaxation and sedation and the knock out effect, coupled with a very reasonable half life 3-4hours (with no groggy hangover effects the next morning). A couple of days later I scored some good hash, and decided to smoke up one afternoon and I took half a pill 1 hour prior to smoking up. The hypnotic/trance like feel was brilliant to say the least.<br /><br />I must warn that its one of those benzo&#039;s that would most definitely induce amnesia, and cause a blackout. I&#039;ve let some of my friends try it while they smoked up and they absolutely loved it. Hands down my fav benzo so far. <br /><br />I know that its not available in pills form in the US but it is in many other countries, and I hope we&#039;ll be seeing more of it around on SR :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I just tried these for the first time last week. I got some Xanax and Dormicum Mints sent to me off here.. Also its a Water soluble Benzo.. I personally Love Xanax and Kpins the most.. Some people claim snorting them doesnt work but iv been doing it since in my teens and its always worked great for me.! I have very bad anxiety so it wouldnt just up and go away unless it was working.. I really like the SR XANAX 3mg Green Triangles..<br />

If the quality is the same, i&#039;m sure some people will be interested in midazoam as a sleep aid.<br /><br />Personally i like my benzo&#039;s anxiolytic, but for those that only have problems sleeping there certainly are solutions on the market that have less side effects than xanax or straight valium. Good old nitrazepam would also be a nice candidate for that. It doesn&#039;t have much recreational potential, but if you just need to sleep, its a very nice benzo.
