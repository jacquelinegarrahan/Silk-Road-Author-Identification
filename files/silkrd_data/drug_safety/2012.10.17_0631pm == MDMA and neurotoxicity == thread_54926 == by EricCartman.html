				Been interested in MDMA for a long time, mostly due to a lack of empathy and excessive self-guilt (In hindsight liberal LSD use may have been a contributing factor to this incessant feedback-loop). <br /><br />Now, I am well aware that the jury is still out on MDMA neurotoxicity (see http://www.mdma.net/index.html#mdmatox), but a few first hand experiences will help. My work requires significant cognitive performance and I am EXTREMELY paranoid of anything that has the potential to irreversibly mess with my neurochemistry.<br /><br />So, people who think/analyze/architect/imagine for a living and have done MDMA, please share your story.<br /><br />And while we are on topic, who are the best MDMA vendors on SR?

				all amphetamines are slightly neurotoxic. mdma and meth may be particularly harmful due to depletion of serotonergic stores which causes dopamine to be accidentally taken up which may produce reactive free radicals which are especially damaging. but how significant the damage is and how much it effects an individual overall are still in question. occasional use will most likely not have any significant or noticeable effect. moderation is key, its when you start really enjoying the drug or using it to cope with down states that it becomes a serious issue<br /><br />i will say that during my time of excessive mdma use (very very heavy) i found critical thinking processes and memory to be hindered noticeably. especially complex mathematics such as calculus work became much more difficult, but upon cessation and some time the understanding and ability to perform calculations improved significantly. though still even to this day i am much more emotionally unstable and prone to serious depression possibly exacerbated from my use and stress on my serotonergic system<br /><br />may find these threads to be of interest/more info on the subject<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41360<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41360<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11429<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15567<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26781.0<br />&nbsp;
