				I got some golden teachers (shrooms for those who aren&#039;t familiar with the name) coming in from a very kind SR vendor,who I will be making a full detail in depth review about as soon as I get them and a very detailed report on my trip.&nbsp; Now I&#039;ve done shrooms at least 9+ times and each time I do them I get massive nausea right before my trip is about to start *The come up* and I always puke my guts out&nbsp; :&#039;(&nbsp; and feel horrible for a good hour.&nbsp; :o (When I puke I instantly start tripping balls and my come up intensifies) Now I am not here to ask for a guide to doing lemon tek or anything like that as I am not trying to double the dosage or potency. I am just trying to find a way that I can ingest the shrooms in a way that it won&#039;t be so hard on my stomach. I did take the lemon tek in consideration but I&#039;ve read many people that experience the same digestion/nausea problems of me still experience it on lemon tek. So I just want to know do you community have any methods,safe of course that I can ingest the shrooms without the nausea. Also do you suggest empty stomach? light snack?<br /><br /><br />I just want to be able to enjoy my shrooms without the annoying nausea and vomiting and feeling like shit for an hour or two into the trip. So please any info/methods/input would be greatly appreciated! <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				I reckon the best way to avoid the (almost inevitanle) nausea shrooms cause is to make &#039;shroom juice&#039; aka &#039;shroom tea&#039; by heating your shrooms with water and then straining the fibrous plant matter out, .... <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m not &#039;sure&#039; coz I kinda half expect to have some nausea when taking shrooms no matter what I do, but the less plant matter (esp fresh) the less overall nausea I experience, but IME it&#039;s different for everyone, I know people who get zero nausea and others like me who can get it bad.&nbsp; Fortunately it only lasts until I puke and then everything&#039;s fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;Maybe puking is just a part you&#039;ll have to accept, like the way the dudes who give people ahyuhusca say the vomiting is an important part of the (spiritual) &#039;purging&#039; that&#039;s occurring!&nbsp; <br /><br />IDK but we always consider a good mushy trip to be like a good defrag for the wetware.&nbsp; A cleaning out ones head.&nbsp; The last trip we had 5gms of dried cubensis that was SO fun/ny....just from the laughing in itself I reckon I breathed more in a few hours than I normally would in a few days!&nbsp; Surely that cant hurt!?!<br /><br />m m m motek x<br /><br />

				Drinking it in a tea or any other way involving less plant matter reduces the nausea a bit, like motek said. A good way to lessen it is to take some ginger as well or smoke weed. Ginger won&#039;t reduce the nausea as much as weed does but it also won&#039;t affect the trip, unlike weed. I would suggest a light snack an hours before, not a completely empty stomach, I found a completely empty stomach wasn&#039;t so good, but even with ginger, taking it as a tea, etc. there&#039;s always some nausea, it&#039;s just less strong.

				The way ive always seen it, its impossible to avoid that blow up..<br /><br />The tea method helps alot, but is also very temperamental, because the psilocybin is rendered inactive with excess heat. <br /><br />Id say that smoking pot is the best way to ease the nausea. Though its not guaranteed to prevent or stop it all together. I just kind of get ready to vomit when eating mushys, i just hate yaking them all up, makes me feel like i wasted them, lol. <br /><br />&nbsp;One simple was to ensure that you get as much as you can out of the mushys before throwing them up, is ground them into dust, then mix them into a small glass, maybe like a tall shot glass, with either pineapple juice or OJ, i prefer pineapple, and slam that.. hold it down for as long as you can. By the time you vomit all of the psilocybin has already been converted to psilocin.

				Fast for 8-10 hours before, make sure you are hungry when you eat them and then maybe stick them in a peanut butter sandwich or something else you normally like to eat/agrees with your stomach. <br /><br />I find it extremely helpful to be hungry before taking them, my stomach ignores the fact they taste bad because it is too hungry to care and i also like to do some pushups after eating them while im waiting for the come-up it take my mind off it and also helps digestion i think.

				Does everyone really get nausea after consuming boomers while on the come up?<br /><br /><br />I have never ever experienced that and my friend also never experiences this. The only other time I saw it was with another buddy who tripped me with me for the first time which was when were like kids.

				Its not 100% with every one.. but its very common.<br /><br />Its 100% for me to vomit with in an hour. Lots of my friends also, but usually the ones that love eating mushrooms as it is, like with their food and such, they seem to never have this issue.

				Antimemetic(sp)? Can&#039;t think of the spelling right now :o dah.&nbsp; For instance, promethazine aka phenergan (fuck sp) even weed is used for chemo to help nausea, as well there are some much more powerful meds for this, most don&#039;t have contraindications. Check em out.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

				Hahaha ah I see. Yeah I was going to totally add that I love mushrooms in food.&nbsp; I love the taste of that unique earthy flavor.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I eat raw shrooms, I chomp them down.&nbsp; But yeah I can totally understand some people can&#039;t eat them like that from the taste of shit basically.&nbsp; I also have an iron stomach.

				Thanks fellas, I appreciate all your inputs, I think I will try my best to grind them into powder and just take them with some type of juice.

				eating mushrooms never makes me nauseous, but drinking tea gives me slight nausea. my girlfriend is the same way. i would highly suggest smoking cannabis when you feel nauseous. ginger tea would be an excellent remedy. peppermint soothes the stomach as well.

				Use a small amount of a Cannabis Sativa strain with uplifting properties to combat the Nausea. Mary Jane is a Psychedelic best friend.
