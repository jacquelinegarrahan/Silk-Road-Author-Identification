These are a few points of departure for Mainline.<br />Russian Roulette<br /><br />For the Dutch awareness campaign on hepatitis C, Mainline developed a game called ‘Russian Roulette.’ A good tool for starting up conversations in different settings and fields of work. By making up their own questions, social workers can bring up sensitive issues in a light-hearted setting. The board game can be ordered via this website, starting September 20 2010.<br />Publications<br />&nbsp;<br />newsletters<br />Take It<br />Take It<br />Newsletter for HIV-positive users<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />3 x a year, 750 copies<br /><br />Dutch only<br /><br />The newsletter discusses the latest developments relating to HIV and specifically focuses on problems that HIV-positive users face. Examples include: What if the treatment does not work, failing to keep up treatment as a result of an irregular lifestyle, or a co-infection with hepatitis C. Quality of life is another subject that is discussed. Nowadays, as a result of successful medication, HIV-positive users have the prospect of a longer life. So, in addition to medical issues, users increasingly seek answers to general life- and health-related questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />C-view<br />C-zicht newsletter for substance users with hepatitis C. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />1 x a year, 2,000 copies<br /><br />Dutch only<br /><br />The theme letter discusses the latest developments concerning hepatitis C, and handles specific problems that HCV-positive users face in the run-up to and during treatment.<br />Mainline projectmap<br />Across borders<br /><br />Mainline works from Georgia to Indonesia, and from Serbia to Pakistan. All these countries have different goals in public health policy...<br />Asia<br /><br />Since 2004, Mainline has been working in several Asian countries to develop and increase the accessibility of (healthcare) facilities for drug users…<br />EU activities<br /><br />We participate in the European collaboration project Correlation II - European Network Social Inclusion &amp; Health...<br /><br />Noticed this? --&gt;&nbsp; &quot;&quot;Russian Roulette&quot;&quot; lol!
