				Hey everyone, JH here.<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new on the forum but I&#039;m pretty well experienced with a variety of psychoactive substances, and have recently begun experimenting with the NBOMe family of RCs. Looking over previous forum threads I have seen that there is a controversy as to the best way to take NBOMe - a blotter on the upper-gums or a solution of the hydrochloride administered nasally. I noticed that the main issue with this discussion is that most people will have access to, or be in possession of either the tabs or powder / solution, so they don&#039;t necessarily have the option of comparing methods. I myself was in possession of some of HardHustle&#039;s HPBCD complexed 600ug 25c-NBOMe tabs, and have taken doses ranging from ~300ug to ~1000ug on the gums.<br /><br />Being experienced with insufflation of a number of different chemicals (coke, MDMA, No. 4 H, Ketamine...), and feeling the desire to trip harder on 25c than I had ever before, I decided to place half a tab (after moistening it on my tongue) as far up my nose as my little finger could place it (maybe undignified, yet worth the effects...and nothing bad compared plugging:). This was a method of administration which I was unable to find any information on through the forums or internet generally. After making sure that the half tab was stuck to the side of the inside of my upper nostril, I made sure to breathe gently for the next 45 minutes as to not dislodge it. After a gradual increase in sensation, almost exactly at the 45 minute mark the effects came on noticeably. I would say that the intensity of the effects was similar to a 650-750ug dose taken on the gums, yet somehow slightly more disorientating with more of a decrease in delicate motor function. Happy with the effects, I decided to apply the second half of the tab in the same fashion, and it gave the same effects, however came on slightly more gradually. <br /><br />After around an hour and a half of the initial dose I began feeling a wave of energy traveling around me - it felt like the universe&#039;s energy communicating with me. I was able through meditation, to trap this energy in my head (almost in the &#039;third-eye&#039; or pineal gland area), and it passed throughout my body carrying a warm intense vibration. Suddenly, my whole body became the same density and felt the same composition as the tiled surface I was sitting on (in a good way) and I felt extremely connected to the world, and a true part of this planet. The visuals achieved through this dose were slightly more intense than those gained through gum administration, yet they were definitely the same - traces and fractal patterns coming out of everything, and a purple hue hanging in the air. After smoking marijuana, around 4 hours after the initial dose I was beginning to return to sobriety. The visuals were less noticeable and the universe&#039;s energy wasn&#039;t passing through me to the same degree. I managed to sleep at around 5 hours and woke up the next day with definite residual effects, but no hangover or headaches. This was the only &#039;spiritual&#039; experience I have achieved through NBOMes.<br /><br />In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this method of taking 25c as it allows one to keep their product in tab form yet administer it nasally if one desire&#039;s a stronger and more spiritual experience than a gummed one. As I haven&#039;t tried the pure hydrochloride I can&#039;t compare the effects of a tab nasally to that, however from what I understand I believe that the experience would be very similar. I don&#039;t know whether the HPBCD complexer aided in absorption through the nose, however I can only assume that it did - and it sure as hell didn&#039;t inhibit it. I have never had bad experiences with NBOMe chemicals before, and I didn&#039;t this time, but I can&#039;t comment on how others will react to this method - especially if they have had bad trips with these chemicals before, I have heard of some including vomiting, diarrhea headaches..! In that case I can only assume that it would increase the intensity of displeasure. Yet for me, it was the most enjoyable NBOMe experience I have ever had.<br /><br />Main point: Why is this method if ingestion not used more commonly?<br /><br />Peace, <br />- JH
