				Hello to my dearest community,<br /><br />I had a few questions about these shroom grow kits sold legally over the internet:<br /><br />1. I would be ordering them to Belgium from an online EU headshop, would this be legal to order or can it get seized? (I know having shrooms and consuming in Belgium is illegal, but how about purchasing grow kit itself)?<br />2. What&#039;s the &#039;general&#039; quality of these?<br />3. Any recommendations for the overall process? Things I should keep in mind?<br /><br />

				I wouldnt waste my time buying them. you can just make a kit for really cheap.<br />Then just order the spores from anywhere they are legal in most places. <br />really you just need canning jars, make substrate from rye grain or many other mediums.<br />temp and humidity gauge, and a fish tank pump. you can find really good how to&#039;s on youtube etc.<br />If I was to buy one I would prob do it domestic as customs may stop it. Just because

				Don&#039;t bother with grow kits. Turn an old fridge or freezer into an incubator like I did and get the spores for free here:<br />http://fsre.nl/

				1) I live in US, so no idea.<br />2) I&#039;ve never purchased one, but considering the simplistic nature of the requisite supplies I would assume that they&#039;re adequate.<br />3) Sure do. As a novice you should read FungiFun&#039;s &#039;PF-Tek for Simple Minds&#039;, here: http://www.fungifun.org/English/Pftek<br />All you really need is a spore syringe. Everything else (like brown rice, bird seed, canning jars, foil, pressure-cooker) should be available at your local grocery or hardware store... except perhaps vermiculite. I understand that vermiculite can be difficult to obtain in other regions. You can buy 2 cubic feet for $20 here in the US (that&#039;s more than plenty).<br /><br />Read and follow the Tek exactly and you WILL have success. This shit is easy if you can follow directions.<br />Once you have a grow or two under you belt, hook up to the Shroomery.org. It&#039;s probably the biggest and best collection of amature mycology techniques available on the Net.<br />Once you have a forum login, be sure to check out &#039;How Frank Gets Shit Done&#039; to see the whole process from a professional grower&#039;s point-of-view.<br />http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/17897163#17897163

				The key to the legal question is whether or not the spores are legal in your country.&nbsp; <br /><br />Psilocybin is illegal pretty much everywhere but psilocybin mushrooms aren&#039;t specifically illegal in many venues, you get busted because they have psilocybin in them.&nbsp; (By that logic, you could get busted for carrying your DMT-containing brain around with you, but that&#039;s another story).&nbsp; Since the spores don&#039;t have psilocybin in them, you&#039;re good to go, unless in your area the government specifically made them illegal.&nbsp;
