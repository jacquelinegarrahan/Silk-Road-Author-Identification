				Yeah I saw that. The apb pic shows the mecke turning brown/yellow. It&#039;s the marquis that turned brown/yellow on my test with the mecke turning dark green to black. There&#039;s no match in there.

It contains sulphuric acid (H2SO4) so this should oxidate with air over time and turn brown all by itself. If you add some some organic stuff (like paper) it should also turn brown, so whatever was in the pill could maybe turn the marquis brown without being amphetamine. But if I read this correct, it went quickly to yellow and then straight to brown? This could be methylone and amp, but it really is hard to say without time and pictures.<br /><br />Have a look here, this thread is very useful (marquis/Mandelin/mecke results): http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/512598-Marquis-Mecke-Mandellin-results-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more<br /><br />edit: damn trailertrash beat me to it :)

				The reaction was pretty quick from yellow to brown, a few seconds. <br /><br />It was actually a mixture of two different powders so I&#039;m going to attempt to separate the two and perform tests on it again before taking pics. <br /><br />The closest match to those pics is 2c-i. Again, I&#039;m going to retest after attempting to separate the two powders.

				I couldn&#039;t separate the powders out, it was too finely grounded as you can tell from the pic. I thought I could isolate a few shards but meh ... <br /><br />Ok, here&#039;s a pic: http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=429e5bd178da936addd0579c4f28f36f.jpg<br /><br />LEFT: Mecke (strait to deep blue) / Center: Marquis (yellow to dark brown; you can still see yellow around the edges) / RIGHT: Simons (deep blue) ... reactions were quick, just a few seconds. <br /><br />I thought it looked like the 2c-i but it&#039;s flipped; mecke turns brown rather than the marquis. The simons also turned positive so it&#039;s at least a mixture of mdma and something else. However, when I marquis tested my 2c-i, it started off yellow just like my unknown sample before turning black. So maybe mdma with 2c-i?

Also, those drugs do have some similarities so maybe somebody got some cheap 2c-i and threw it in there? That doesn&#039;t seem too implausible.

				After posting the pic, the seller admitted that half was methylone so I guess if you see these results in the future, it could be an MDMA/Methylone blend.

				Interesting. Would you be willing to share the seller name? I feel like he should have told you this before if he knew beforehand. Not that I wouldn&#039;t buy from them, I&#039;d just like to know what I&#039;m getting.<br /><br />Also, thanks for going the extra mile to figure this out. I&#039;ve saved these pictures so I can reference them if needed. +1 to you mate.

				QuikMart and we were supposed to get &quot;blue moonrocks&quot;. You can read the entire saga here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32396.105 ... he is now attempting to sell nbome tabs which I&#039;m staying far away from. <br /><br />

				btw, for anyone that wants to try some bullshit like this, even a 1:8 methylone:mdma ratio will completely throw off mecke and marquis tests.
