				i am wondering if anyone has any advice or opinions about using coke, speed, meth, or any other amphetamines or stimulants in the context of giving their workouts a boost/burning more fat.&nbsp; i feel pretty confident in my workout strategies so far and have seen great results with a combination of lifting and cardio but i&#039;m wondering if i can give myself an artifical edge to cut down that BF % even more?&nbsp; any experience, advice, or warnings would be appreciated.&nbsp; (i&#039;m not particularly&nbsp; interested in bodybuilding and have steered clear of steroids as i naturally have gyno anyway and the thought of making it worse alarms me.)<br /><br />or maybe i&#039;ll just start smoking joints while i lift like arnold...

				I wouldn&#039;t really go for the hard stuff if you just want a boost since you can easily get addicted to the enhancement those stimulants give you. I suggest using the less harsh and legal stimulants&nbsp; ;) I was using a blend of caffeine/dmaa/hordenine during workouts and it was awesome. the best part is you can buy all of those on amazon for really cheap and bulk amounts too. I was also taking some acai pills and they kicked up my metabolism to the point where I was just burning through food, it kind of sucked though cause I was always hungry haha.
