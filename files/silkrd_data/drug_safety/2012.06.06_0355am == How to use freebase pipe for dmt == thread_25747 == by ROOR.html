				I have never smoked dmt out of a freebase pipe and I recently bought a glass ball meth pipe.&nbsp; So I put the dmt in the ball of the pipe and light from underneath but not touching the flame to the glass and then it will smoke.&nbsp; Now am I supposed to plug the little hole (like the carb hole on a cannabis pipe) when I inhale the smoke or just leave that open?&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for any replies

				I don&#039;t know if anyone else is familiar with it, but I&#039;ve always had great success smoking DMT from &quot;the Machine&quot;. If you&#039;ve never heard of it, google it. Costs no more than $5 to make, hits surprisingly smooth, and it keeps your leftover DMT from one sesh ready to go for the next!

				using one of these pipes is far from ideal, as you&#039;re almost guaranteed to burn the drug.&nbsp; like someone else said, the machine is best.&nbsp; <br /><br />that said, i&#039;ve had breakthroughs with the meth pipe.<br /><br />hold the lighter a couple inches beneath the bulb while holding the stem with your finger tips.&nbsp; this way you can rotate the pipe back and forth to keep the flame from staying in one spot under the pipe.&nbsp; alternatively, you could just rotate the lighter in a small circle while you&#039;re heating the pipe.&nbsp; take your time, if you do it in a way that will minimize burning, it could take 30 seconds or so before it starts to vape.&nbsp; once it does take the flame away and inhale, when it stops smoking, apply a little more heat to get it going again.&nbsp; smoke as much as you possibly can.<br /><br />oh, and definitely DONT put your finger over that hole, lol.

				Thanks a lot for the replies.&nbsp; I have heard of the machine and will look into that in the future.&nbsp; Plugging that hole was really my main question and I think that was answered lol.&nbsp; So really I just need to take my time while heating and I should be all good.&nbsp; Also I have smoked the stuff before and it really is nasty and can really irritate your throat especially if you burn it instead of vaporizing.

				I&#039;ve never used the machine but my meth pipe works great for me. Try not to think about the taste, you&#039;ll actually learn to appreciate it really quick and it won&#039;t even make you cough anymore

				The machine is pretty amazing, I&#039;m always surprised by how easily it hits. The other nice thing is that it&#039;s easily concealable.<br /><br />If anyone has questions about making them, hit me up, I&#039;m happy to help out.
