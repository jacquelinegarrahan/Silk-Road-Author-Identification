				A bunch of etizolam pellets are currently on their way to me and the only time I&#039;ve ever had a benzo was when I found three old tetrazepam pills in my mom&#039;s medicine locker ;D<br />While doing my research I&#039;ve noticed that etizolam is quite structurally similar to flunitrazepam, which is known for causing anterograde amnesia. How big is the risk of doing some whacky shit and not recalling it later on when taking etizolam (provided that I keep doses within reasonable bounds)?

				from what i&#039;ve read, it depends entirely on the dosage. if you&#039;re taking 1-2mg you&#039;ll probably be fine, much more and the chances of you doing something silly (including redosing) and not remembering increase. Depends what you&#039;re using it for, i use it to help me sleep after other substances but if you&#039;re taking a larger dose on its own for recreational purposes, particularly combined with booze, the risk of silliness goes up :p

I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s how the term &quot;Barred out&quot; got started around xanax. 2mgs of xanax is called a bar. Once someone is to the point of amnesia it&#039;s considered barred out. Has anyone else heard of this slang term around their area?

				The other day I took two etizolam (to my recollection).&nbsp; I am sure I ended up taking more.&nbsp; Anyway the next morning my wife wakes me up and asks me why I put her computer in the fridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />True story.&nbsp; I learned my lesson.&nbsp; Just learn your limits and stick to them.

				Every time I have taken more than one I have very little recollection of what happened next - which to be fair is generally why I have taken them (after a long session). The first time I ever took one I had eaten quite recently, seemed to do nothing but the next day I was sleepy most of the day.<br /><br />Second time was a while after eating, took one expecting nothing, this time I was actually taking it to put a lid on some anxiety and it certainly did that within about 30 mins, then after about an hour felt quite happy and quite pissed (drunk) when moving about, followed by a long deep sleep.<br /><br />I find it a lot less sinister than traditional benzos with much easier side effects, that&#039;s just me tho!
