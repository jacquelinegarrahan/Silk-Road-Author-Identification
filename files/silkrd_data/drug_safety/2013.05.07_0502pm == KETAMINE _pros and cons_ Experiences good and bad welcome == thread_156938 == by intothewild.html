				Myself: Ketamine user for over 4 years.<br /><br />Wanted to get a good thread going for Ketamine since I&#039;ve been reading posts here and there about it and wanted to give out some good advice that might help people make informed decisions about this drug and perhaps others experiences can teach me too?<br /><br />Good things (me personally):<br />I&#039;d say it&#039;s one of the cleaner drugs around, a bit easier to suss out cuts etc. <br />Some great revelations to be had<br />Peaceful floaty dreamy fun<br />Spiritual experiences and confidence boosts, helps depression in an instant (may not be good for depression/anxiety long term though)<br />Escapism from reality and the monotony of this life<br />Have found it to be quite a sensual drug, can leave you slightly horny during and after (depending on which type you get) To this day Ive never been able to differentiatehttp://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home between S and R but I know there are definite differences as Ive felt them!<br /><br />Bad things: (me personally)<br />You appear to look and sound like a twat, even when you think you look normal, no you don&#039;t!<br />Potential for addiction; EXTREMELY HIGH<br />Psychological dependence<br />Come down feelings of anxiety and depression and almost feeling like onset of psychosis<br />Grandiose actions and speech which can be very embarrassing when others think your friggin deluded!<br />Lack of organized thinking speech after many years of abuse<br />Sinusitis issues<br />Feeling somewhat detached from my reality quite often :/<br />Getting myself in quite harmful situations, not knowing how or why I got there<br />Black outs<br />FUCKING scary K Holes, swear I have died a fair few times!<br />Short term memory bashed!<br />Bladder pains etc (Have seen friends loose bladders, get fucked up organs) but they have been doing amounts of like 5 grams and more daily for days.<br />HEART PAIN AND RESPIRATORY ISSUES, PALPITATIONS FOR DAYS AFTER AND TRIPS ENDING UP IN A&amp;E.<br /><br />Doctors/paramedics have advised the more you play roulette with Ketamine, each time your respiratory system takes a major bashing and could be getting to slowed down by ket it could eventually just stop you breathing :(&nbsp; <br /><br />TIPS:<br />Stay as hydrated as you can before and after your trips<br />Be careful on doses and try to have people with you who arn&#039;t fucked<br />Eat plenty of fresh fruit and veg to counteract the alkaline build up in the body. WATER WATER<br />Excersize<br />Don&#039;t swallow the drip, just dont!<br />Dont snort crystals, it ripps up the nostril and has caused me major irritations.<br />Cook up the Ketamine <br /><br />TRY IM INJECTION with all the safe clean equiptment, its such a nice trip.<br /><br />I thank you for reading, and welcome any tips, experiences good and bad. Especially related to the Heart, lungs etc........<br /><br />Peace<br />

				i have&#039;t tried ketamine in a social situation, but i have tried it a couple of times in other situations (outside), and one thing i noticed is a complete absence of fear..... which can be a pro or a con<br /><br />oh and when you talk about resperation problems... are you talking about K-HOLE dosages?<br /><br />

				I have never done MDMA but when I did Coke, it kind of feels like that.<br />When I first started sniffing bumps of Ketamine, I had this kind of ego boost type feeling but that was on small doses.<br /><br />I guess the respiration issues might not effect some people, but i do feel a little worried about it, but then i have been using it for 4 years and man does the tolerance build quick!<br /><br />I used to take it and go out in the country walking and finding everything look really cooolllll and feel like i was in fantasy land hahhaa<br /><br />K Hole doses&nbsp; can be quite scary....

				2 years ago i consumed a good amount of K over a period of 2-3months.<br />tolerance builds up insanely fast, and your thinking/moving gets pretty slow after extensive use&nbsp; like you said..<br />so i guess the key is (like with every drug) to do it now and then. not daily..<br /><br />i really like the drug! lower dosages can be quiet funny when partying and bigger ones for out of body experiences.<br /><br />bought it always already cooked - how do you cook K properly?<br /><br />and what would be a good amount for IM without tolerance ? <br /><br />my K went always up the nose&nbsp; :)
