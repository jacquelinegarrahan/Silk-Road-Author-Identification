				Where can I find a scale, in person, so I don&#039;t get any looks for ordering a Gram scale<br /><br />Can you find anything like this at wal-mart or a store similar? What should I expect to pay?

				I would suggest ordering one online if you are looking for 1 / 10 mg precision. <br /><br />A scale intended for jewelry could be useful too, although these often are not much use if you want resolution beyond 10 mg or so.<br /><br />In case you need to perform measurements that are accurate below 1 mg amounts the only solution is to use an analytical balance. These usually come with a measurement chamber that can be sealed off to avoid air currents offsetting your measurements. While these balances are very accurate, their price tag will probably make you reconsider. Something reliable with a resolution of 10 micrograms will probably be priced at tens of thousands of dollars, and needs to be installed on a vibration free platform for accurate use.

				I just need one that is accurate to the MG (if it is off a MG or two that is not a big deal)

				I got the American Weigh Gemini milligram scale: http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM<br />It&#039;s pretty darn accurate considering the pricetag, though for the smaller doses such as &lt;5 mg, I suggest weighing a few times before you get a good feel for how it works. It&#039;s also quite sensitive to air currents from air conditioning, so be sure to keep it in an area that won&#039;t be too affected in that way. Also keep away from computers and any other equipment that may cause vibrations. <br /><br />Hope this helped! :)

				I have a cheap set of scales brought from a local shop, the are acurate to 10mg, however they don&#039;t like to register below 30mg, therefore I put a known weight on them and then just add the substance with the weight, its IMO easy to eyeball 10mg into 1mg piles.

				I recommend SR to avoid stores, but call or stop by local smoke shops. They&#039;ve often got them in various types and accuracies, and don&#039;t ask questions.
