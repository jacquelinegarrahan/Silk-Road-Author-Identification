				I used to use adderall alot to study in school. In fact i used to use it so much that after awhile it stopped working for me. I would take breaks for several weeks and take a pill and i wud just feel sick and tired and i would fall asleep on doses of 40 or 50 mg.<br />I took a break for 2 and a half years, and now I tried adderall again a couple months ago. It worked wonderfully. I was happy that it works again so I bought 10 pills. Unfortunantely the second time i tried it (a week later), not only did the pill (30MG) not work, i got that same sick feeling and i felt tired and dazed and i fell asleep during an important class.<br />I tried it 3 more times, all the same effect. <br />Since adderalls not doing the trick i switched over to Ritalin, which helps me study but is not nearly as helpful when it comes to studying.<br />So my question is that would crystal meth help me study? I have a MG scale and can weigh out 20 or 30 MG. <br />I would swallow the crystal meth in a capsule, the same way the adderall is taken.<br />Would meth not work (the same way adderall isnt working) because theyre both amphetamines?<br />Thanks, sorry for the long post

				You should look at SelfSovereignty&#039;s posts, he advocates meth as a study aid a lot and according to him, it&#039;s a lot more effective than adderall, and also always works as opposed to adderall. I&#039;ve personally never tried meth so I can&#039;t really say anything but SS is a reliable source when it comes to meth.

				They&#039;re essentially the same chemical with subtle differences/efficiencies.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely to give you the same negative effects as your addy, but there&#039;s only one way to find out.<br /><br />For studying, it works great.&nbsp; Doing anything that you want to focus fully on it works great:&nbsp; But heed this warning -- whatever you want to be focusing on, start doing it as you&#039;re coming up, or you will get distracted by whatever you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />I have learned this the hard way.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m going to power clean the house today&quot; turns into wasting 8 hrs on the internet doing nothing because I started chatting as I came up.

				Am i the only one that addy makes them paranoid? I enjoy amphetamine but, not aderall. Meth in low doses would make a good study aid. I believe, but I&#039;ve only use oral ROA a few times.

				Eat the meth. It&#039;ll last longer and will be less euphoric, but still very effective as a study aid.<br /><br />Better yet, try modafinil. Amphetamines really arne&#039;t good for you

				I&#039;d rather not pills..<br />maybe all the fake E&#039;s that i&#039;ve gotten over the years made me paranoid, but whenever I think of pills, i think its automatically cut.<br />I&#039;d rather get pure shards and weigh out doses on my MG scale

				When I ate meth it didn&#039;t really do anything in comparison to snorting. Do you&nbsp; need to have a bit more if you ingest this way?

				I used Crystal Meth via homemade capsules as a smart aid for 2 months.<br /><br />I have also tried Adderral, Dexies, Ritalin and Nootropics.<br /><br />I much prefer Dexies over anything.<br /><br />But I posted about my experience using meth for studying here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=68809

				also I should note, all the idiots who posted I would get addicted to crystal meth were very incorrect.<br /><br />I low dosed 10mg daily... and I haven&#039;t touch meth in 6+ with zero withdrawl.<br /><br />Theres a big difference between capsule dosing for studying and smoking it for escapism.
