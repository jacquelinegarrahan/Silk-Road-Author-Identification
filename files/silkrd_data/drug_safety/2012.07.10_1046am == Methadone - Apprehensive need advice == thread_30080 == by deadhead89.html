				Hi all, i have 24&nbsp; Methadone 20mg sent by mistake<br /><br />I am a bit worried about taking them as I have heard quite a few bad reports about them. <br /><br />Is there any recreational value? what about compared to codeine? <br /><br />Should I snort or Oral ? <br /><br />I have done codeiene and oxy a couple of times but not enough to have a tolerance.

				Heya,<br /><br />My advice would be to split those 20mg tabs into quarters (5mg). 5mg Methadone will be equivalent to about 10mg oxycodone. BUT... Keep in mind. Methadone also takes a LOT longer to come into effect before you will notice any intoxication. Do not re-dose for AT LEAST 3-4 hours otherwise you could easily OD.<br /><br />If 5mg doesn&#039;t work for you. Wait, and try again (you have heaps!). It should definitely have some recreational value. Also keep in mind that kicking even a small done habit will be very painful - so go easy and split those highs up. Good luck my friend.<br /><br />Mr P

				Well, I generally don&#039;t recommend going down the road of opiates, especially if unintended. Personally, I&#039;d just dispose of an opiate if I received it by mistake, but I&#039;ll get off my high horse and offer some practical advice:<br /><br />Oxycodone has a half-life of 3-5 hours. Methadone has a half-life of 15-60 hours. In other words, you&#039;re at great risk of the methadone accumulating if you take doses several times in one day. Be sure to consider this if you have work/school/driving or other physically/mentally-demanding things to do even the next day. The same goes for the side effects. <br />

				I am sending them back now anyway<br /><br />Didnt really want to take them simply because I hear they are a bit more high risk profile than other drugs dont get me wrong i like oxy, but from i heard about methadone i dont think i wanna test it out
