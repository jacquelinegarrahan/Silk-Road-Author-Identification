				For my 500th post I&#039;d like to start a new thread, <br />one about micro-dosing LSD...<br />this has gotten my interest for a while<br />and especially in the last weeks...<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about doses of 10 to 15 microgram every 3 days, for a few months or so... <br />I&#039;ll do some more research about it before going into the &quot;experience&quot;<br />but I hope that, with this thread, people who&#039;ve experienced it (themselves) will be willing to share their experiences and thus shed some light on this very interesting practice. <br />Or, if you know a good book about it (or chapters/paragraphs in specific books), do share the info here. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen some posts about micro-dosing in the past on this forum, but if I&#039;m not mistaking there hasn&#039;t been a specific thread created for it - but if I&#039;m mistaking I hope someone can point me out where that thread is. <br /><br />Then, <br />if you&#039;re a seller of good, pure LSD and you&#039;d be willing to lay some sheets of +/- 40 - 60ug per tab, that would be awesome since it would be much easier to use 1/4 or 1/6 of such blotters for micro-dosing (easier than cutting 1/20 of a 200ug blotter, or than diluting a 100ug drop into 10 drops and then having to carry your drops around wherever you go). <br /><br />A question I&#039;d like to ask to start with is: if you use the 10ug every 3 days but you want to go &quot;all the way into Lalaland&quot;, what will be your tolerance and how much would you need to overcome that? <br /><br />Cheers to all here!<br />And happy 500th post for me!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />EDIT: here&#039;s a link to the list of molecules that have been &quot;researched/experimented&quot; with, with as much accurate information as could be provided - thank you @Zipstyle for making this list and thank you @all for sharing this information! Keep the info coming, but always stay on the safe side! <br />LINK: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173822.msg1424561#msg1424561

				Congrats on the 500th post, RaFel5!<br /><br />Interesting idea/thread. I&#039;ve never microdosed on LSD so regularly, although I&#039;ve done in quite a few times and always had good experiences. Of course its hard to measure how much I actually took, as the dosage wasn&#039;t precisely measured. I find taking small doses to give me &quot;magic powers&quot;. As in, it doesn&#039;t inebriate me to the point where I&#039;m incapacitated, but actually helps me perform most tasks BETTER!<br /><br />However, I&#039;d imagine that your tolerance would go up pretty fast if you were doing this 3x a week. I used to trip several times a week and several days in a row at that, and I would always have to inevitably increase the dosage to feel the same effect. So I&#039;m not sure how possible it would be to pull this off so regularly.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear how your little experiment turns out though! Keep us posted ;D

				Looks like an interesting experiment!<br /><br />I accidentally micro-dosed myself with liquid a few days ago, and it was a very fun experience actually: I was a bit more open and social, while only having very faint visual effects, and a general increased well-being. Sadly I don&#039;t know the exact dosage I consumed, but I guess somewhere around 20-35 µg. It helps to enjoy a regular day.<br /><br />I suspect tolerance can become an issue though...

				This is what I&#039;m planning on doing this summer, though with different doses. In south america, it&#039;s common to diet on a plant where you eat it for 3 days or a week, on a strict food diet (no alcohol, no sex, that type of thing), after which you continue the food diet, and the plant continues to do its thing while you go back to your normal life. Considering this with LSD, I would think about microdosing so as not to be tripped out, but was thinking of larger doses than you are saying, maybe 45ug a day for 3 days, and then again a month later, maybe followed by a big trip a month after that with 150-200ug.<br />I have had a strange relationship with LSD in my life but it is undoubtedly brain altering, in that the &quot;effects&quot; last a long time, which is to say the neural pathways are opened and not necessarilly closed.<br />It&#039;s my hypothesis that microdosing in this way may lead to a prolonged opening of the neural pathways, during which I can train myself to cope with the changed perception (not too worried about lalaland as I&#039;ve been studying the art of grounding for many years in relation to plant medicines)<br />However, there is a risk of naivety considering that the south american &quot;diet&quot; approach may not be so easily integrated with out western chemicals.<br />Interested in following this thread over time, thanks for starting it

				What exactly is taking something like 10 ug of LSD every other day or so supposed to accomplish?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see much harm in trying it, but i&#039;m curious to find out what would actually happen.<br /><br />As far as cutting blotters itno smaller doses: this should be no problem as long als they are uniformly dosed. Cutting up a blotter into 25 pieces is not hard to do (5 horizontal and 5 vertical pieces). The downside is that this only works if the lsd is distributed evenly along the blotter. If the manufacturer used a pipette to drop the proper amount of lsd onto each blotter that will not be the case as most of it would be in the middle.

				@Ben: this technique (with a pipet) is almost never used anymore - sheets are &quot;layed&quot; nowadays because it&#039;s quicker, better (product is laid evenly) and easier to do. If some guys are making their blotters at home (for...hobby) then they might, but even then... The risk is not that much of having a difference within 1 blotter, the risk is a having blotters of different strength on 1 sheet... <br /><br />@cricketplank: I&#039;ve learned many different techniques over the last 12 years, but never one that originated from the plant medicines from S-A. If you have some time it would be great to share some info (here or on a specific forum page). <br /><br />@ALL: the idea of micro-dosing is that you should NOT feel any real change in your perception. You should stay way under the threshold for the product. It should work on a sub-conscious level and only on that level. You might notes some enhanced concentration, more imagination, more understanding of abstract terms/ideas - but you should not really FEEL the difference...<br />So, what&#039;s the purpose of it you&#039;ll say - well, many people have used micro-doses (especially when LSD was still legal) to enhance their cognitive capacities and most (if not all) of them have found this product to be very usefull in very low quantities (less than 15ug per day). <br /><br />In some books you can find a bit of info on the micro-dosing regime and what&#039;s mostly recommended is a 1x every 3 days portion of minimum 10ug and maximum 15ug, taken in the morning (best about 30 minutes before eating).

First and foremost it&#039;s the enhanced energy level i feel.<br />You may need to go even lower to only get effects at a subconscious level, maybe 2-5 ug.<br /><br />For how many days have you micro dosed now?

				RaFaeL5 &amp; Rastaman Vibration<br /><br />I&#039;ve worked with ayahuasca in ceremonies with an ayahuasca shaman for years and the essence of the work that I have learned is to help myself to improve the aspects of my life which make me sick or cause suffering - I understand many people here use LSD and other things as methods in the same work, though I learned very quickly that there is a huge difference between &quot;psychonautics&quot; and &quot;healing&quot;. A psychonaut who is driven by some kind of escapism or addiction is likely to have their asses kicked (eventually) by a conscious plant who is somehow elected to guide you in your subconscious towards your spiritual cleansing. This is to say that the conscious plant will quite quickly encourage you to realise that what you&#039;re doing is out of sickness and illusion, and so is not of benefit to (your) life. This is part of what I mean by &quot;the art of grounding&quot; - we &quot;get high&quot; and then we &quot;ground&quot; ourselves by coming back into contact with our waking life. However, a shaman is usually aware to some level of both the spiritual/energetics (which are as real as anything else) and the daily activities of life (work, communication with people, etc), so there is little room for living from &quot;illusion&quot; or trippiness, as these usually have no value in the healing path (note I am not saying that visions are not of value if they are understood, however they are illusory and self created a lot of the time - this is very different to understanding the patterns and functioning of non-visual energetic realms within reality).<br /><br />So to get back to dieting, many people work with ayahuasca and tobacco (which is a purgative and cleanses toxicity, though also has very strong and complex energetic components as a Master/Teacher plant) - but of course South America is the centre of medicine of the world, so there are millions of plants which have different components (for example, it is the psychotria viridis which gives us visions/sight within the subconscious, but the ayahuasca is the vine which consciously assists in the healing aspect - some DMT heads might argue with this, but I am telling you what I&#039;ve learned).<br />So say you went to a diet shaman in peru who may give you a plant to eat for 3 days or a week and you will lie in your hammock and have no visions and maybe not vomit at all or notice much effect - this is part of the importance of microdosing, i&#039;ll come back to it in a sec - then after the diet you go off and stick to a food diet and no sex no alcohol no pork for a few months after, this allows the spirit of the plant to work with your energetic body for this time, all the while you are learning from the teacher plant on a less-than-conscious, not overwhelming level - your life begins to change, synchronicities may bring you to different places, etc.<br />My question this year is whether or not this can be done with a synthetic chemical like LSD that apparently has so many healing powers, and yet is human synthesised, which is to say it is not working directly with a plant spirit - rather we are working with a chemical spirit, who can teach us different things.<br />In my experience with LSD there is little to no guidance from a conscious element, certainly not to the extent as ayahuasca/p. viridis, who are continuously communicating with you to assist you on your journey.<br /><br />With microdosing, there are a number of medicinal families that use this technique, and I would dare to suggest that homeopathy is one of the primary ones. My understanding of it is that we are in some way isolating an energetic/non-physiological pattern which we interact with consciously and learn from. Homeopathy is quite different to Flower remedies (people will be familiar with &quot;Bach flower essences&quot; but this is just a simple limited range of plant essences that are used), but it seems to operate on a similar principle, that is there is no pharmacological activity - conventional medicine would examine it as purely placebo - but its level of operation is simply immeasurable at the moment. This medicine is energetic medicine and not physiological, in that sense, but highly connected with emotions, and particularly with spiritual/energetic &quot;patterns&quot; and beliefs - it may be better understood in terms of neural connections, for example. We are &quot;wired&quot; by conditioning and life experience to believe and act in certain ways, and the plants/medicines help us to rewire by getting us to observe these less-than-helpful operations, wherein we can consciously alter them.<br /><br />Grounding is the ability to keep a foot FIRMLY in waking life and remember the truth of your life, without getting lost in heady trippy illusions or conditioned false ego (a big one being &quot;I&#039;m conscious and liberated because i take psychedelics&quot;).<br /><br />RaFaeL5, do you have any references for where you read about the 10-15ug doses? Even this is a large dose in a sense, and it is quite easy to make an &quot;inverted&quot; energetic dose and take the non-physiological component also - though right now I want to work with the physical and observe.<br />

				+1 @cricketplank&nbsp; and thank you for sharing!<br /><br />your text seems to confirm much of what I was already suspecting/thinking about that subject. it&#039;s nice to see it written like this... <br /><br />the &quot;spirit&quot; of the product (&quot;easy&quot; to discover when you&#039;re taking botanical products, much more complicated to discover when you&#039;re using synthetic products) is always there - I think that&#039;s also a known fact in shamanism: &quot;everything has a spirit&quot; (even inanimate things such as a spoon)... <br />My idea is that the intention of the scientist who discovered the product will always have a certain &quot;trace&quot; in the spirit of this product (A.Hoffman in the case of LSD), then the chemist who made the product will also have a certain importance in &quot;coloring&quot; the energy of his product, probably everyone who has &quot;touched&quot; the product will leave some trace of energy/intention/spirit/... on it - but, even then it wouldn&#039;t explain where the &quot;actual and original spirit&quot; of the product (in our case LSD) would come from, so let me go a little bit further: &quot;we&quot; have not created anything yet that didn&#039;t exist in nature (I mean this on a chemical level, I&#039;m not discussing GMO&#039;s here); we have rearranged molecules, we have separated one molecule from another, we have combined atoms, ... but even the molecules from plastic are found in nature, even the radioactive isotopes can be found in nature, even... so, until now, mankind has only been able to reproduce products that were already present in nature/the universe... when taking synthesized molecules (synthetic molecules) I think we&#039;re able to feel/contact the spirit of the equivalent molecule that is found in nature... <br />But I&#039;d be glad to go more into detail about this with you or anyone else - here or on another page or in PM... (I wrote a little about this @ the Avengers, but not really in depth). <br /><br />Anyway, <br />the info that I found about micro-dosing is coming (mainly) from the book by James Fadiman (&quot;the psychedelic guide&quot;). I don&#039;t have the book right here, but if you guys want me to I&#039;ll try to find it this weekend (and then try to find some time to type some of it here... wish I could copy-paste). <br />Also, if I&#039;m not mistaking, some info can be found on erowid (but correct me if I&#039;m wrong). <br /><br />

				It&#039;s great to speak openly about it as the scales sometimes tip on SR boards towards &quot;take huge doses or youre a pussy&quot; and &quot;how come i&#039;m not getting visuals?&quot;.<br /><br />RaFaeL5 is your intention something similar of working with it at a kind of medicinal dose? what led you to want to work in this way? <br />Considering that many neurotransmitters have different physiological effects at high and low doses (epinephrine on a and b receptors), I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if 5-HT2 agonists have varying degrees of selectivity...<br />As zipstyle said &quot;This could completely change the way people think of LSD&quot;, though I&#039;m sure many people have worked like this - Any info you have is great, but definitely would love to keep in touch as we both experiment with this, and perhaps more here will join us in microdosing. I ordered large dose tabs from Mahakala who seems to have laid a new range of lower dose tabs, 100 - 120. He doesn&#039;t speak great english but he&#039;s been a very receptive vendour for me so far and if he&#039;s laying lower doses he might be interested in laying 60ugs, which would give convenient 15ug quarters.<br /><br />I completely get how the energy of the &quot;guru&quot; and the others transfer within the experience, indeed its something i experienced directly if ever I gave acid to someone, I would have a big part to play in their trip. Personally, I want to work through these lines quickly and so I energetically cleanse the acid. Last time I ingested some, I &quot;forgot&quot; to cleanse and was acutely aware of the transmitted energy which wasn&#039;t exactly shanti. Everything is a lesson, but some lessons are tougher than others. I have found that gentleness is one of the most significant behaviours in this work, and I am quite sensitive to dosage anyway.<br /><br />Would also be interested in hearing of anyones experiences of contacting the spirit of LSD?<br /><br />Great stuff

There is a LOT of crap in the shamanic book world, but &quot;shamanism&quot; is just another way of acting from the heart, and living a peaceful and wholesome life. However, &quot;shamanism&quot; is also synonymous with &quot;sourcery&quot;, and many practitioners go to the spirit world in order to manipulate and cause effects, similar to &quot;magick&quot; of the western world, but with less ritual I imagine. So with that in mind, I would recommend steering clear of the people who claim that they can teach you. &quot;Anti-gurus&quot; seem to have at least a layer of observation between their ego and yours. I&#039;m liking Adyashanti lately, and new books are popping up all the time. Any life-changing recommendations? (speaking of which, &quot;The electric koolaid acid test&quot; was a huge influence - sort of anti-spiritual acid history, changed my life!)

				@cricketplank, I believe I contacted the &quot;LSD spirit&quot;, but unfortunately it was not a pleasant experience. At the time I was taking A LOT of LSD and I took a particularly large dose at the time I made contact. The spirit spoke to me directly and told me I was overdoing it, pretty much.<br />

				Thanks for the recommendations, everything you said makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say any one book in particular has been &quot;life changing&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent the last 5 years reading and studying different religions, and philosophy.&nbsp; The books that got me started was a collection called The Four Agreements which contain Toltec teachings.&nbsp; The teachings were simplistic and common sense, and started to really open my eyes.&nbsp; Then many different books on Buddhism picked up where I left off, and lead me further down my path.<br /><br />I believe that all spiritual paths carry the same intrinsic truths, but some you need to search harder to find the real truths within truths.&nbsp; I often feel I am learning the same things over and over, just from slightly different perspectives.&nbsp; I take a little bit from each and incorporate it into my life.<br /><br />As far as books on Shamanism, I enjoyed &quot;Intelligence in Nature&quot;, which is also by Jeremy Narby.&nbsp; &quot;Breaking Open the Head&quot;, by Daniel Pinchbeck.&nbsp; &quot;Awakening to the Spirit World&quot;, by Sandra Ingerman.<br /><br />I could list many more, especially if I went into the philosophy, psychedelics, and Buddhism niches.<br />

				@Joeybob: I&#039;ve had lots of interesting lecture, but most of my books have been &quot;lent&quot; to people who on their turn lent them to someone, who on their turn... so, saddly, I couldn&#039;t tell you the titles of most books... but I strongly believe that the best way to walk this path is knowing that the path will bring you what you need at the moment you need it and in the form you need it! Trusting in this aspect of life has brought me many good things - but, damn, it thought me to be patient also!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />1 book that I would really recommend is (yep, I know): DUNE. <br />This book is about much more than &quot;meets the eye&quot;. It has been an eye-opener for me since many years, I love to read it again and I&#039;ve had entire nights discussing it with my (late) guru in Asia... <br /><br /><br />@cricketplank: for now my intentions are to understand the product more and more - I know it already in big doses and at life-changing quantities, but I&#039;m more interested (for now) in the micro-doses and the many beneficial effects it seems to have on those who use it that way. I&#039;m a strong believer in LSD, I think we barely discovered the tip of the iceberg regarding the possibilities of this molecule. <br />Regarding the issue of &quot;tolerance&quot;...as far as I know no one has ever built up a tolerance towards homeopathic treatments and I think that should be the goal when micro-dosing LSD: to take an amount of the product that is beneath the quantity that would trigger a reaction (such as a building up of tolerance/resistance). <br /><br />I&#039;ve had some products coming from Mahakala. He&#039;s a great seller! I just saw that he&#039;s selling liquid - so if you want to micro-dose that might be a good idea (liquid is easier to be diluted than blotters to be cut). <br /><br />About the &quot;guru&quot; part: I spend a LOT of time in preparing our trips. A LOT. From the moment I think about buying it until a few weeks AFTER the experience I&#039;m dealing with it - with the energy, the intentions, the set &amp; setting, ... One aspect that has proven very important is indead cleansing the acid (for a long period) before taking it - and my tip is (as written in previous post @ the Avengers): use gems (most important gems for this is black tourmaline) and put it in a room where you often meditate, but don&#039;t send too much thoughts towards your LSD when you&#039;re meditating - just allow them to be in your vicinity while meditating, that&#039;s enough and very effective. Sending too much intentions towards them might &quot;programme&quot; them in such a way that you would stop the &quot;flow of the experience&quot;... The experience has to grow, each time it&#039;s different and it should be adapted to the personal situation of those who take it - not just be &quot;programmed&quot; for a certain job... Often the trip will go towards something totally different that what I/we thought about - but you have to leave enough space for this to happen... &quot;Go with the flow&quot;. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve been using Lucy in a kind of &quot;therapeutic/spiritual/holistic&quot; way for a while now and micro-dosing is just the next &quot;phase&quot; in this quest of knowledge, understanding and healing for myself but also for those around me (whether they participate in the experience or not doesn&#039;t matter). <br /><br />quote: &quot;&quot;shamanism&quot; is just another way of acting from the heart, and living a peaceful and wholesome life&quot;<br />+1 for this, well said and nicely written... <br /><br />@Joywind: thank you very much for sharing - this is about the list of &quot;expected and desired effects&quot; that I had in mind when thinking about micro-dosing. Could you tell us more about quantities, way of administration (do you use blotters or liquid or another techique), time of dosing (morning before breakfast, after breakfast, ... ) and so on? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cheers to all for participating in this discussion... and thank you!

				RaFaeL5 - well said, particularly on meditation and programming of the substance. I was planning on putting SR down for the summer now that I have what I need and I haven&#039;t been finding the right threads on the boards, just continually being disheartened, but this has restored my faith, and I&#039;d be happy to continue this discussion over the next few months, and feedback what I&#039;m learning.<br /><br />Thanks to all.

				Great thread, great posts... thanks to all of you!<br /><br />It would be interesting to define the dose for microdosing. I guess that it&#039;s different for each individual, but I&#039;d feel like 15ug is quite a lot - though as you&#039;d take it every 3 days that&#039;s &#039;only&#039; 5ug per day. <br /><br />I&#039;d be probably more interested to experiment with a lower dose (like 2/5 ug) but taken daily. Diluting some liquid sounds like the best for that, but I guess that the product in which you dilute it has it&#039;s importance.. low ug blotters can be quite good too.<br /><br />I feel like plants are more &#039;linked &#039; to the vegetal world/the earth and that chemical, even though they are extracted from plants are a bit less &#039;earthy&#039;... not necessarily a bad thing though...<br /><br />Regarding Bach Flowers and homeopathy... it would be really interesting to experiment at the same level with LSD.. which would probably be an ug mixed in a swimming pool - then take a drop. ;)<br /><br />Raf, (or anyone else) did microdosing help you with meditating? (like stay focus, calm down the mental, etc?)<br /><br />Nice day to everyone, and thanks again for this thread :)<br /><br />Peace,<br />&nbsp;

				@Cricketplank: nice to know that you&#039;ll be spending your summer here with us&nbsp; :D<br /><br />@bongo185: good question... for as far as I know there are no (known) negative effects of micro-dosing, but it would be interesting to hear about it from someone who&#039;s been M-D&#039;ing for a while... <br /><br />@joeybob: if you look for Frank Herbert&#039;s &quot;Dune&quot; on amazon, try to buy the first 3 books at once - you&#039;ll probably read all of them in...3 days or so! No, really - they&#039;re addictive!<br />High grade vodka is the most used liquid for this purpose... The french &quot;Grey Grouse&quot; seems quite good for it... <br />oh, and if you have &quot;too much&quot; phenethylamines, just contact me in a PM&nbsp; :o<br /><br />@cristal: I found that LSD (even at high doses) is very easy to meditate on, almost as easy as hash (charas/temple ball). But, if you&#039;re into meditation, I highly recommend experimenting with different products and the effect they have on meditation - I found it VERY interesting to meditate on various products and it always teaches me some (or even a lot) about my meditation technique... Even ketamine, mdma, mushrooms, 2C-B, ... <br /><br /><br /><br />@all: another intersting &quot;fact&quot; about LSD is that the more the tripper is experienced in tripping, the lower the dose he can take to have a &quot;full effect&quot;... I&#039;m wondering if it would be possible to manipulate our thoughts/mind in such a way that we could actually (if we&#039;d want to) break threw... a bit like with DMT: you don&#039;t need much, you just need a certain &quot;twitch&quot; in your way of thinking and then just let go... <br /><br />

				as promised: some passages from the book &quot;The Psychedelic Explorer&#039;s Guide&quot; (by James Fadiman). <br />- I&#039;m not giving you the whole text, just some parts of it with some editing... <br /><br />Chapter 15: Can sub-perceptual doses of psychedelics improve normal funtioning? <br />p. 198 and forward in the 2011 edition (Park Street Press, Rochester, Vermont)<br /><br />introduction:<br />sub-perceptual amount of LSD, about 10micrograms<br />indigenous cultures have known about and used sub-perceptual doses of different psychedelics for centuries<br />I&#039;ve avoid coming to any general conclusion beyond noting that all the reports have been positive<br /><br />the story of &quot;Charles&quot; (has micro-dosed for months):<br />be conservative in following the protocol, including the amount and the days between doses<br />stick with your normal patterns, especially eating, working and sleeping<br />be very discreet as to whom you let know<br />it&#039;s best to start small, between 6ug and 12ug<br />start small, if it&#039;s too small you can always take more the next time<br />also, go slow<br />the protocol I followed had me take a micro-dose one day, then carefully observe any ongoing or lingering effects the second day, and then give myself the third day competely off<br />the day you&#039;re completely off is great as a reset day, kind of like clearing the mind/body palate - then you&#039;re fresh and ready to undertake the experiment again<br />do what you normally do - eat your regular meals, stay hydrated, do your exercises, meditations, practices and so on. the idea here is to stay grounded while you are being stimulated, ever so slightly, beyond your normal parameters. <br />the fewer who know, the better: be discreet<br />I&#039;ve regularly felt 4 kind of effects from micro-doses: physical, emotional, creative and spiritual<br />PHYSICAL: within an hour after, I start feeling more energy... Yes, you will need to have a good night&#039;s sleep afterward; buzzing with extra energy eventuaylly tires you out. <br />EMOTIONAL: it&#039;s easy for me to appreciate everyone and everything in my life, sustain a space of gratitude<br />CREATIVE: I&#039;ve had some brilliant outbursts with respect to both work products and personal creative projects. <br />SPIRITUAL: what I feel that micro-dosing does is to slightly rearrange my neural furniture so that glimmers of full-on psychedelic states are constantly pouring into my awareness. The Truth of What Is is simply easier to spot, and that makes everything else easier. Even the next day -the day after- the hint of universal connectedness is still quite apparent.<br />// it&#039;s almost like I was born to be like this, and now I get to be like this

				part 3: the story of James<br /><br />From the first time out, I liked how I felt. Got my work done easier, rarely lost my temper, my paperwork got done in time, and when I got home at night, I was a lot more fun to be with. What was cool is I found out that I was as good the second day after I&#039;d dosed as the first, maybe better. I didn&#039;t say when I was using and when I wasn&#039;t, but after a while, my wife would say: &quot;Hey, did you do it today?&quot; Usually she was right on. <br /><br /><br />part 4: the story of Clifford<br />(he&#039;s telling a specific story of what happened to him during 1 exam when he was still in college - her teacher asks him to draw the complete development of the chick from fertilizatoin to hatching; the entire course)<br />I began to see a movie of fertilization! When I opened my eyes a few minutes later, I realized that the movie could be run forward and back and was clear as a bell in my mind&#039;s eye, even with my physical eyes open. <br />Hesitantly, I drew the formation of the blastula, a hollow ball of cells that develops out of the zygote. As I carefully drew frame after frame of my inner movie, it was her turn to gape (= the teacher). <br />I drew as quickly as I could. To my utter amazement, I was able to carefully and completely replicate the content of the entire course, drawing after drawing. <br /><br />= he got an A from his teacher...

				part 4: the question of tolerance<br /><br />I asked a once prominent LSD chemist if the &quot;every three days&quot; regimen like the one &quot;Charles&quot; used was necessary, since it is well known that one cannot take repeated doses of most psychedelics and have them continue to be effective. <br />His initial reply was, &quot;As far as I can determine, less-than-obvious doses do not cause tolerance, which could argue in favor of benefits from ten a day. I&#039;d have to test further, but so far I suspect that sub-detectable doses several days in a row cause no tolerance for a similar barely detectable dose the day following. At this sub-detectable level, there is really at most only the tiniest of intimations you took something.&quot;<br /><br /><br />part 5: Preliminary conclusions<br /><br />These reports are representative of those I received in 2010. The reports have several things in common. Everyone said their experience were positive and valuable. &quot;Charles&quot; suggested that there was a gradual buildup of openness and awareness, eventually spilling over into non-sub-perceptual days. Madeline and Stephen both indicated they did better at what they do well - not excessively, but enough to notice. <br />As several reports stated, someone taking a dose this low functions, as far as the world is concerned, a little better than normal. To date, I received no reports that sub-perceptual doses have caused any social disruption, personal upset, or any form of work-related difficulty. However, this is a very preliminary look at an area that may become of considerable interest as more opportunities for research open up. We may yet get to know more about what Albert Hofmann called &quot;an under-researched area&quot;. <br /><br /><br />&lt;&lt;end of chapter 15&gt;&gt;<br /><br /><br />If I find more on this topic in other books I will try to also share it here with you guys. <br />I hope you can do the same...

Let&#039;s say a &quot;normal&quot; dose is then 250ug (I&#039;m simplifying I know, but this is just easier for the maths). When micro-dosing you should take between 6 and 12ug. Let&#039;s say 9ug (again simplifying)... This means that the micro-dose is about 1/28th of a &quot;normal&quot; dosage... <br />When you calculate with the threshold dosage, it is said that this is between 50 and 60ug for most people... so your 9ug of LSD to micro-dose is still about 1/6th of this &quot;minimum dose&quot;... <br /><br />Also, personally I&#039;m not a big fan of 25nBome - but if you&#039;re willing to share your experiences here with micro-dosing whatever substance I&#039;d be glad to read about it... <br /><br />And yes, the Psychedelic Explorer&#039;s Guide is a good book - it kills a lot of myths and wrong conceptions, makes tripping safer and more fulfilling!<br /><br />Have a good weekend everyone!

				Thanks for pointing that out :).&nbsp; It would be best to start as low as possible to see where the positive effects actually come into play.<br /><br />I was looking at the low end of the threshold doses, so for 2C-I(2mg) at a 1/4 dose would be 500ug.&nbsp; Erowid states 2-5mg is a threshold dose, and if taken right at middle at 3.5mg, a 1/6th would be right around 583ug.&nbsp; So it all depends on which set of numbers you go by.<br /><br />Perhaps making each drop at 1/8th of the low dose would be a better place to start, so for 2C-I this would be 250ug per drop of liquid.&nbsp; One could start with one drop for a while, then step up to 2 or 3 depending on the response.<br /><br />Either way, the particulars such as dose amounts and timing of doses will be unknown until a self experiment is done.&nbsp; Each person responds differently as well, so this would change on a person to person case.<br /><br />This is a great thread, with great information all around :).&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to seeing how it all pans out.

Please, do fill us in!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I haven&#039;t been online for a few days so reading these last few posts has almost brought a tear to my eye, and there are a number of things I am interested in replying to. RaFaeL5 thank you so much for typing out those passages, they have reinforced my inclinations, and please keep me in the loop (if only on this thread) for the microdosed vials, this is very inspirational. I will also make an energetic &quot;flower essence&quot; of LSD if it gives me permission, and I could share this with people down the line for free.<br /><br />firstly, this idea of not needing as much as an &quot;experienced&quot; person I think is very relevant. i mentioned before that I&#039;m sensitive to dosage, and this is something that I&#039;m reading a lot about on threads saying &lt;150ug is more annoying than positive, but my last trip (first in ten years) was 180ug and I knew it was way too much for me. i wasn&#039;t crazy tripped out, but i was paralysed with fear and without the clarity to meditate appropriately to look at the source, and this was partially due to smoking sativa, which I don&#039;t really plan on doing much again. I continue to learn that I CANNOT trip for escapism, it is just not an option anymore. <br />There&#039;s a number of things here: most ayahuasca shamans, I have heard, will continue in their practice of medicine on people without drinking it at all, and simply smelling is enough - obviously the icaros (very special songs) and their experience (including massive doses at initiation etc) are able to connect them directly into the energy, with which they can act as a channel - the spirit of the divine flowing with the spirit of ayahuasca through the spirit of the human as medicine man.<br />Drinking ayahuasca in ceremonies, i found the difference in quantity to be fairly (not completely) irrelevant. there was a call for &quot;threshold dose&quot; but the key was in connecting with the energy, which often was the significance of doing the work in the first place (e.g. are we drinking ayahuasca to ask it for something, or are we drinking ayahuasca to connect with our souls - very different things). I learned that ayahuasca, while a beautiful and well respected and respectful teacher who appreciates the human role on earth, was not, for me, a &quot;product&quot; with which one achieves &quot;results&quot; (i.e. heals your issues). I heard of a guy who was given huge doses and still had no effect, such was the strength of his mental inhibitors. this is why meditation with the substance may be a key to opening its effects (calming the mind/calming the inhibitors of the neural pathways).<br />The Baanisteriopsis caapi is reported to be the cave within which you may find truths, and the psychotria viridis holds the light which can help you find your way around (see the significance here between synthesising DMT as opposed to harmal/other vine alkaloids - the true alchemy is unlikely to be isolated in a chemical, despite the wonders of DMT). Some peoples do drink only the vine without the leaf, and it is a long and rigorous ceremony nothing like the combinations. Most people brew with more than just the two main plants also. [Question 1: LSD is synthesised from mescaline is it? what side-effects are we losing by not ingesting the brother and sister alkaloids at the same time as the &quot;effective&quot; derivative?]<br />Likewise, ayahuasca is a key with which one opens the inhibitors that prevent them from connection with their souls. It can help the mind to calm, and guide the person through the cave and (very significantly) assist in the removal of obstacles. However it is OUR soul, and OUR locks which it helps us to open, and I can relate to those who live by the rules of not ingesting any &quot;intoxicating&quot; substances (are we looking outside of ourselves for the answers?)<br />On one LSD trip I knew that it was just cardboard I had eaten - there was no chemical. You dig?<br /><br />Rastaman Vibrations -- when the spirit of LSD told you that you were overdoing it, what else was going on? What did you see? <br /><br />I think we are all aware that the complexities of the cosmos are so vast that we are learning tiny sections, and what we learn on a journey associates with the cartography we store in our souls. We can map the cosmos on a trip (Oh! I&#039;m remembering!) and this does not have to be in the same language each time we go back to a trip. Most significantly, the cartography is within our hearts that we never need to &quot;try&quot; to remember, it is the act of being true to ourselves, being ourselves, that is the action of achievement on the path of cosmic travel (i dare not talk about destination).<br /><br /><br />So Question 2 - have people found they are less likely to drink alcohol or smoke tobacco or more likely to eat healthily as a results of psychedelic use? <br /><br />

				@cricketplank: <br /><br />question 1: no LSD and mescaline are not related. Mescaline comes from cacti (Peyote or San Pedro), LSD is a chemical synthesis (organic chemistry), sometimes it&#039;s derivated from ergot (but there are different ways to make it). And for the sake of information: psylocibine comes from mushroom, but Albert Hofmann found a way to make it in a lab. Yes, he was the father to more than just LSD!<br /><br />question 2: most of the surveys that were done before the ban of LSD showed an improvement of &quot;life quality&quot;, meaning also what you listed (the same book as I quoted from earlier gives a quite detailed analyses about this &quot;improvement of life quality thanks to LSD&quot;.

That being said there are some recent fascinating studies regarding neural regeneration, although the studies where done with psilocybin as apposed to LSD, both compounds act as 5ht2a agonists so it should hold true for LSD as well.<br /><br />Anecdotal evidence suggests there are multiple benefits to microdosing LSD and other psychedelics and people in high power positions have been known to do it with some regularity.

Let me elaborate on this... If you want a full-blown psychedelic experience, with ego-death/out of your body/I&#039;m seeing God/ the universe = 1/... experience than you should not look into micro-dosing. The whole point of micro-dosing is that everything happens at a sub-perceptual level, so basically: you want feel the difference, or barely. <br />But, if you want to look at the applications of micro-dosing LSD (and most have been listed in this thread), then I think you should look into it. Yesterday I just heard that taking a sub-perceptual dose of acid could even stimulate the re-growth or the repair of neural decayed cells in our brains... so, micro-dosing is certainly very interesting, but it might not be what you&#039;re looking for. <br /><br />Then, if you&#039;re afraid of taking acid I highly recommend reading James Fadiman&#039;s book (from which I quoted some passages out of the 15th chapter). This book will tell you what can really happen, how to deal with it and it will also break a lot of myths about this product. I find it one of the most intersting books for &quot;wanna be LSD trippers&quot;. <br /><br />Regarding your question: shrooms or acid you might also have this concideration... you can stop a shroom trip (with a lot of vitamine C or stonger products), but you can&#039;t stop an acid trip with anything else than you mind...<br /><br />About tripping in general: I think everyone who&#039;s into it needs to have (at least one) bad experience. Some have their bad experience on their first trip, others will trip for years before encountering it... but everyone will have (at least) one... And a lot of people will, after a while, tell you that this specific trip was the best of their lives - the one where they actually learned a lot, the one that changed their life for a better... because once you learn to &quot;let go&quot;, once you learn to &quot;go with the flow&quot; during that difficult moment, then first of all you&#039;ll have learned a very important thing for IRL, but you&#039;ll also soon be seeing beautiful things up there in Lalaland, thing&#039;s that you couldn&#039;t have imagined were possible to see/experience/be. <br /><br />If you want more info on tripping (in general) there are 2 good forum pages here: the Avengers ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0;topicseen ) or Lucy, Sid, Doses ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=84848.0 ). <br /><br />Personally I prefer acid to shrooms (and have probably had more than 100 trips on each of them). Even if LSD lasts longer, I think it&#039;s easier to &quot;manipulate&quot;, to give a direction... but many of my friends think the contrary. <br /><br />@Zipstyle: I liked your answer and thought it was very good and appropriate. <br /><br /><br /><br />@all: to widen the discussion towards other products than LSD I&#039;ll try to type some of the info that I&#039;ve got (from the same book again) about micro-dosing with psylocibine and/or mescaline... as soon as I have the time...

				From my experience, mushrooms tend to take you by the hand and lead you through the experience, showing you things you need to see at that point in time.&nbsp; With LSD a lot of the responsibility falls onto you, and you are basically responsible for where the experience will take you.<br /><br />Everyone reacts differently to these types of things though.<br /><br />If you are hesitant, I would recommend starting with a low dose to test the waters with any new entheogen.&nbsp; You can always work your way up, and add more the following time, but as mentioned by RaFaeL5, it is harder to stop a trip once it has begun.&nbsp; If things turn bad, just focus on your breath, and let go, and always remember the state is temporary.

				@ gimmemoredrugs<br /><br />For me, in short, shrooms let you experience the microcosm, while LSD let&#039;s you experience the macrocosm.<br /><br />In a shroom trip you will most likely &quot;go down the rabbit-hole&quot; into many areas of your own mind/consciousness/psyche.&nbsp; You will learn deeply about yourself, and also probably about how you are connected with the Earth/those around you/everyday life.<br /><br />In an LSD trip, you will most likely experience the universe as a whole, and possibly your connection with. You will be thinking in terms of the (very) big picture.<br /><br />Hope this helps, and best of luck in your journeys.<br /><br /><br />@ RaFaeL5<br /><br />I agree completely about the having to have a bad trip at least once. A bad trip can be absolutely horrifying, but in the end you get so much out of it.

				This is such an awesome discussion! I think I might start microdosing now. Keep us posted on that vendor, RaFel5 ;)<br /><br />@cricketplank, when I made contact with the LSD spirit, I was whisked to some alternate reality. Its pretty hard to describe, as you can imagine, but I can tell you that I wasn&#039;t in &quot;this world&quot; anymore. The actual encounter with the spirit was rather frightening. It was a very powerful entity that appeared before me. He was made entirely of geometric patterns. He had very intense &quot;fractally&quot; swirling eyes. And more than just his visual appearance, I felt a very powerful presence. Again, very hard to describe. Scared the shit out of me, honestly. But I think I needed to experience this. I really was overdoing it with the acid at the time. Looking back on it, (and this goes back to what RaFael5 was saying) I would describe the experience overall as a positive one, because of where I am today. I wouldn&#039;t have been able to get here without that encounter.<br /><br />And to answer your question 2, these days I try to live as health conscious as possible. I do my best to eat well, and I quit drinking and smoking tobacco many years ago. I&#039;m not sure that its because of my experiences with psychedelics necessarily, but it certainly is a coincidence. One of my healthy habits that I definitely learned while on LSD is to drink A LOT of water every day

				Today I was thinking more about this thread...<br />And I had two thoughts: (1) Would micro-doses of LSD be comparable to Hydergine? and (2) What do you think about micro-doses of AL-LAD?<br /><br />:)

				@ Zipstyle: <br />first of all, I just saw your posts on the Envious thread about AL-LAD and to be honest this product has caught my interest also... but for now I&#039;ll spend my money on a products that are known to have beneficial effects when micro-dosed: LSD (1), psilocibine (2) and mescaline (3). But, when you get your LAD it&#039;d be very intersting for you to try to micro-dose that substance and to keep us posted about the results (if any)... off course the big question about micro-dosing &quot;unknow&quot; products is the quantity... I&#039;m quite convinced the maximum dose for micro-dosing (any) product is 1/10 of your &quot;normal&quot; portion and probably 1/10 of the threshold portion is already ample... but experience will tell... <br /><br />About the info on that vendor: he was gone contact me during the week to tell me when he&#039;d be ready for shipping and when his CO would be up. As soon as that is the case I&#039;ll order this liquid from him. Then it&#039;ll have to get here. Then I&#039;ll test the liquid. Then we&#039;ll be using it on micro-dose level... so, for now (I apologize for this) you&#039;ll have to be a little bit patient. Also, I told this friendly seller that I wouldn&#039;t be mentioning his name here before he&#039;d be ready to ship such bottles to everyone who&#039;d want one... so it might take some time - but rest assure that I&#039;ll do my best to share all the information that I can as soon as I can! <br /><br />About your second question: I have no idea (yet) what &quot;Hydergine&quot; is. Would you like to elaborate? <br /><br />@Rastaman Vibration: funny that you mention it, but both me and my GF have been drinking much more water since we started using LSD many years ago... I never thought about the correlation between the two, but now that you wrote about it, it seems to be linked. Nice!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				So, here is the last bit from chapter 15 (yes, still the same book) for you guys...<br /><br />Part 1:<br />Psilocybin Mushrooms - report by Stephen Gray<br />the full essay can be found @ www.stephengrayvision.com (search for &quot;benefits of low-dose psilocybin mushrooms&quot;). <br /><br />&lt;&lt;...much less frequently discussed are the benefits of very low-dose experiences with these mushrooms...we decided to try an experiment. We wanted to see how a very low dose would affect the emotions and the mechanics of playing music and singing...we each ate 2 medium-size dried mushrooms (psilocybe cyanascens) the stem perhaps an inch and one-half long and the caps one-half to 3/4 of an inch across...less than a gram of dried weight...we didn&#039;t engage in any special preparation such as fasting...this was in no way a reliable scientific experiment...we included a little cannabis smoking with the mushrooms...one of the results was that my guitar playing became more focused and agile. I don&#039;t play guitar enough anymore to get through most songs flawlessly, but on those nights, my playing was definitely more on the mark. I also noticed that my ability to recollect lyrics was noticeably superior to my norm...<br />In conjunction with the sharpness has been a softening of the heart, which helped me connect to the emotion of the songs...During these low-dose mushroom sessions, I&#039;ve noticed that my mind instantaneously grokked meanings that had previously eluded me...I&#039;ve noted before with Psilocybes and had confirmed again in these experiences that the mushroom appears to temporarily dismantle inhibition and hesitation to seeing things clearly and talking about personal topics straightforwardly...I&#039;ve had some very intimate conversations with friends where we revealed ourselves without embarrassment and spoke about sensitive issues without raising defensive reactions...<br />Ingesting such small doses is something most people can do safely on their own. No particular ritual is necessary to elicit beneficial effects, although in my experience the spirit of the plant is always potentially present and is much more likely to bless and empower even these mild experiences if petitioned and treated with respect...<br />I&#039;ll mention a couple of cautions: psilocybes are not easy to identify at first and can be mistaken for similar-looking but poisonous mushrooms. I had an experienced mycophile point out the local Psilocybe cyanascens. Not all mushrooms have the same potency and not all people respond the same. One time I ate 2 small ones and the effects were too subtle to have much impact. Another time I experimented with a slightly higher dose, somewhere between 1g and 1.5g; for playing music that quantity proved to be a bit much. The effects interfered with my functionality...<br />If we&#039;re able to shift our cultural understanding of these plants and begin to see them as medicine, I would say that, used with respect and good intentions, low-dose psilocybin is good medicine... The important thing is to provide the right kind of space for the medicine&#039;s effects to manifest. There has to be enough space in the mind&#039;s &quot;busy-ness&quot; to notice the subtleties, to feel the softening of the heart, and to catch the insight as they arise. <br /><br />Part 2: Anita<br />instead of taking the good-sized dose of mushrooms I took a pinch of it each day. I found that I was much more emotionally even and more able to see the world as interrelated rather than disjointed. It was a fully pleasurable experience. <br /><br />Part 3: Nathan<br />I took a small hit of mushroom the other day...went out surfing. It was a life-changing event. I was so much more in my body and could feel deeper into it. I sensed the wave had come thousands of miles and that we were coming together for its last few seconds before it hit the beach. But what was best was feeling like I connected back into the greater world. What was so special is that for the past few weeks, I&#039;ve been really down. A great long-term love relationship broke up, and I&#039;ve been devastated. I&#039;m still sad about it, but I know it&#039;s only a part of me. I got attuned that day, and I haven&#039;t lost it. Oh, yeah, my surfing was definitely awesome.

				so, here&#039;s some more info...<br /><br />First, from Bongo185&#039;s article (just a small part of it): <br />The economic godfather of the 21st century, Steve Jobs, spoke openly about his experiences doing LSD, and teased Microsoft about how much better a company it would have been if Bill Gates had spent a little time on acid. Before the drug was outlawed in the mid-1960s, research into its effects was beginning to flourish. Oscar Janiger, a psychiatrist and researcher at UC Irvine, co-authored one of the most famous studies on the effects of LSD. He linked it to enhanced creativity in test subjects with artistic inclinations, making them more willing to experiment, take risks, and use more of the materials available to them than when not using the drug.<br /><br /><br />Then, coming from Erowid. <br /><br />1) about LSD, from different authors: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_dose1.shtml (CLEARNET)<br /><br />threshold: 20ug<br />...<br />Especially emphasized is that small doses of LSD(30-40mcg.) or<br />Psilocybin can be used with good results in ambulant treatment of<br />psychoneurotic and psychosomatic disorders. 200 patients received<br />LSD, some on several occasions. Only 2 unpleasant situations occurred<br />(sexual aggression towards the therapist). The influence of LSD and<br />mescaline on the artistic ability of professional and amateur<br />painters is also reported.<br />…<br />LSD (50 mcg.) or mescaline (400-700 mg) orally impaired the highest<br />integrative functions of 4 graphic artists. Drawings revealed an<br />unusual expansiveness and relaxation of control, both colour and line<br />being free and bold. (black and white illustrations). No major<br />difference in effect between LSD and mescaline. Similar impairment of<br />functions was noted in a playwright given 50 mcg LSD orally.<br />…<br />Double-blind studies on 14 healthy subjects confirmed that LSD fails<br />to elicit a physiological response in doses less than 20 mcg.<br />Dramatic psychic symptoms, e.g. deviations from normal in body image,<br />thought, and emotion, occurred only with dosages in excess of 20 mcg.<br />However, careful observation and questioning revealed certain changes<br />in affect and psychomotor activity with doses as low as 7 mcg.<br />Classical schizophrenia-like symptoms first begin to appear when the<br />dose exceeded 30 mcg<br /><br />2) about mescaline: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mescaline/mescaline_dose.shtml (CLEARNET)<br /><br />no information about micro-dosing (but I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find some in time), only this:<br />threshold = 100mg

				I have been micro dosing for the last 3 days, every morning. <br /><br />I took 1 blotter that is between 40 and 50 ug , and cut it into 9 pieces. That gives me between 4.4 and 5.5 ug for each micro square.<br /><br />This morning i did not take any because i was bit by an insect 14 days ago, and needed to start treatment today.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really ready to say whether i feel benefits from micro dosing, so i will wait on giving a report of my findings until i have eaten all 9 squares.

				I think I&#039;m in love with this thread XD.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been reading all the updates each day, and it&#039;s interesting to see quite a few people interested in this subject.&nbsp; Thanks for all the informative posts RaFaeL5.&nbsp; This thread has moved me from thinking about micro-dosing, to actually doing it.<br /><br />I&#039;m into week two of my own micro-dosing experiment.&nbsp; Last week I micro-dosed with 25i, and noticed a remarkable difference(although my dose was probably a bit high for the experiment).&nbsp; This past weekend I made up 3 vials, one each of 2C-I, 2C-E, and 2C-P, each drop being an 1/16th of the lowest threshold dose.&nbsp; So that would be 125ug/drop of 2C-I/2C-E.&nbsp; There was no data of threshold dose of 2C-P so I simply cut that in half for ~62.5ug.<br /><br />I have switched over to 2C-I this week, and the effects feel very similar to what I experienced last week.&nbsp; I have a feeling that at this low of a dose the effects will be very similar between the different phenethylamine compounds, but only time will tell.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only had one dose this week, dosing at 2 drops, or 1/8th lowest threshold dose.&nbsp; I had the most productive day I&#039;ve had in a while yesterday, and this is continuing into today.&nbsp; I plan on following the once every 3-4 days schedule, or about twice a week.<br /><br />Basically the benefits have been as others have pointed out:<br /><br />Greater Focus/Concentration<br />Uplifted Creativity<br />Soundness of Mind<br />Stable Mood/Emotions<br />Decrease in Anxiety/Depression<br /><br />I should point out I quit drinking a couple months ago, and have dramatically cut back on my cannabis use during this experiment, and I believe this helps to feel the subtle effects.&nbsp; It is also important to train the mind to stay clear in order to get the most out of it, morning/evening meditation in combination would probably magnify the benefits.<br /><br />I work for myself, and since beginning this experiment I&#039;ve noticed that my work is fun again.&nbsp; Sometimes I have issues with depression/motivation, but this has vanished with micro-dosing.&nbsp; If any problems arise it seems much easier to cope and find creative ways of dealing with such problems.&nbsp; Overall I feel much more grounded than ever before, a feeling of connectedness with my physical body and others involved in my life.&nbsp; With this comes an overall deeper appreciation for life.&nbsp; I have far less cravings for cannabis, and the desire to escape reality, and this seems to be aiding with the benefits.&nbsp; Also finding that I&#039;m sleeping much better, which is also helping with the benefits.<br /><br />Each day is more calm and balanced, and I think this will only get better as I continue.&nbsp; I will continue with 2C-I for at least 2 weeks, then I may change to 2C-E to see the difference, if any.<br /><br />Take Care All, I look forward to reading other experiences :)<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br />JB

				I feel like I&#039;ve hit on something really touching, and joeybob as first &quot;testimony&quot; on this thread is a lovely thing. Coming to SR has been a radical gift for me, with lots of mixed feelings about forum postings about suicide and loads of self-treated mental illness. I like where this thread is going.<br /><br />Day 1 btw, 22.5ug was too high a dose for me, but I had that feeling as I was cutting the blotter, and went with it as a stronger &quot;introduction day&quot; dose. Had to go to bed for a couple hours and meditate, because i began to feel anxious and nauseous. I am so happy I did as my heart began to open and I met my old friend - at first I felt it to be the spirit of LSD and I know it is a part of my self-healing spirit, but I also recognised the simple truth that LSD and ayahuasca are divine sisters, with the same purpose on the whole - that of liberation and opening the human heart.<br />Tomorrow I will half this to 11ug and I will probably maintain that as my microdose level.<br /><br />Thanks for the companionship

				WOW!!<br />This is amazing JB! Please keep us updated, and also let&#039;s keep this thread going so maybe some vendors will make micro-dosing an easier possibility. Also: would it be possible for you to share your dosing methods? For example, what you used to dilute the 2C-I (mixture, amounts, methodology, dosing schedule). Thank you so much for this...I think this could be a new breakthrough for medicine. These drugs are very powerful for the psychedelic states they produce, but they also are vehicles of truth that I think can be used in this way to help people enter more consistent and peaceful states of being.

				@Cricketplank: for what I&#039;ve found on information (and most if not all has been shared here) I think a good dose for micro-dosing is 1/10 of the threshold dose... so, for most people that would be about 10ug of LSD... personally I&#039;m looking forward to having some 5.5ug drops so that I can even start at a lower dose... for some reason I think that the lower the dose, the stronger the positive effect can be - you just need to get over the 0-limit and then you&#039;re right where you wanna be... at least, that&#039;s how I look at it... <br />So, why not even try to go lower than 11ug? Let&#039;s say 5.5?&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />@Zipstyle: I hope JB will be sharing his methodology with us - that would help other people to do the same, or to improve the technique and then come back here to enlighten us some more... <br />quote:&quot;I think this could be a new breakthrough for medicine.&quot;... well, I think we&#039;re just repeating what many other people have done over the last 70 years - except we can communicate about it, work together, trial &amp; error, gather information and data and so on. Those who did it before us couldn&#039;t share their knowledge, or had to keep it in a very small circle of initiated... Trying to bring this out &quot;in the open&quot; might actually facilitate the breakthrough you&#039;re talking about, but what I really hope for (now) is that more people will join our discussion and that more (experienced) micro-dosers will share their insights with the rest of this community. <br />Taking small doses of anything is kind of &quot;new&quot; here on the forum, and IRL! Maybe, bit by bit, this can be one of the many initiatives to change user-habits towards a more conscious and effective use of banned products - so that, in time, people&#039;s way of looking at those products would keep on changing towards the positive. Not everyone needs to get to know psychedelics as &quot;life-changing blown out of your head experiences&quot;, many (and probably much more) people could benefit from a small portion of the product; just a micro-dose!&nbsp; :D

I used brown vials(think liquid LSD) for storage, you can find these cheaply online, check eBay ;).&nbsp; I also have small 1cc plastic tipped syringes for measuring the liquid, I believe these are originally for filling printer ink cartridges, also can be had for cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can use whatever you like for measuring/storing, as the method will remain the same.&nbsp; As long as you can extract about the same amount of liquid from your storage container each time.<br /><br />To create the liquid concoction at the right dosage level, just takes some basic math.<br /><br />First off I didn&#039;t want to count each drop that went into the vial.&nbsp; So I took one of my small plastic syringes, blocked up the bottom so no liquid could escape.&nbsp; I then took the dropper from one of my vials and filled it with the Vodka.&nbsp; Then I carefully dripped it into my plastic syringe one drop at a time and counted to 20 drops.&nbsp; This filled the syringe to the 3rd line, so now I know if I fill the syringe to that point I will get 20 drops of liquid, if I fill it to the 6th line I will have 40 drops, and the 9th line will be 80 drops.<br /><br />So when you know how many drops are in a set amount of liquid, it&#039;s time to measure the compound.&nbsp; I wanted to create a dosage that would be a 1/16th of the lowest threshold dose.&nbsp; The lowest threshold dose is 2mg, so that means for ever 1mg I would need 8 drops of liquid.&nbsp; I figured it would be good to start with around 20mg of compound, which would call for 160 drops.<br /><br />I measured out the 2C-I powder, but went slightly over at 24mg, which isn&#039;t a big deal as the same math applies.&nbsp; The powder went right into an empty vial.&nbsp; *I usually measure my compounds on top of a small piece of tinfoil on top of my scale.&nbsp; This just happened to make it easy to get into the vial as well which was nice.<br /><br />So now I have 24mg 2C-I.&nbsp; Time for a little math.<br /><br />24 x 8(drops per mg) = 192<br /><br />I know the measurement for 20 drops from earlier.&nbsp; So now divide the total drops by 20.<br /><br />184 / 20 = 9.6 (I rounded this down to 9.5)<br /><br />Now remember, my measurement for 20 drops is the third full line on the syringe.&nbsp; So I would need to fill the syringe to the 3rd line 9 times, then once more at the 1.5 line(for the last half mg).&nbsp; <br /><br />So what I did was I filled the syringe with Vodka to the 9th line 3 times, each measurement going directly into the vial with the 2C-I, for 180 drops of liquid.&nbsp; Then once more at the 1.5 line for another 10 drops.&nbsp; <br /><br />This brought my liquid to 190 drops, which was close enough for me.&nbsp; A minute amount of the 2C-I was left stuck to the tinfoil, so I knew I didn&#039;t have the full 24mg anyway.&nbsp;

I basically just squeezed the dropper over and over on the sealed vial until it all fully dissolved into the vodka, this seemed to work great at mixing everything around.<br /><br />I did the same thing with 2C-E.&nbsp; 2C-P was the same, but I used half the amount of powder to liquid, because it is more potent.<br /><br />NOTE: Viscosity will change from liquid to liquid, and may even change with temperature with certain liquids.&nbsp; I store my vials in the freezer, so I put the vodka in the freezer for a while just in case this would change the measurement of the drops.&nbsp; I would suggest measuring the liquid drops each time you make new vials, if you have a lot of time in between just to make sure, especially if you are using a different type of vodka or what have you.<br /><br />DOSING<br /><br />Now onto the actual dosing.&nbsp; On the days I dose, I do it first thing in the morning, shortly after waking up, and wait 20-30 minutes before eating breakfast, so I know it has proper time to absorb before I start putting food and drink in my mouth.<br /><br />I just stand in front of a mirror, fill the vial from the dropper, then drop it onto the bottom side of my tongue.<br /><br />I&#039;m still playing around with the actual dosage, and this will vary from person to person I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; I started this week with 1/8th threshold dose, or two drops.&nbsp; I skipped a day, and today I dosed with only one drop.&nbsp; I will probably skip another day, then take two drops again on Friday.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to test it every 2-3 days at 1-2 drop(s) for a while.<br /><br />There are many different ways of dosing.&nbsp;

				Great thread! I have recently been microdosing with Psilocybe galindois. I usually take 4/10 of a gram--roughly equivalent to half that amount of cubensis. Some days I do, some days I don&#039;t--no set on/off schedule. My experiences have been almost entirely positive, and it rubs off on those around me. I am able to be more patient and understanding than I am normally. I am more confident in my ability to work through difficult problems. I am more open to ideas outside of my normal comfort zone. Good feelings almost always carry into the next day, and I wake up happy (this hasn&#039;t happened since I was a little kid). The only real downside is that it will sometimes compel me to take a nap, but on these occasions, I probably need one.<br /><br />I tried sub-threshold doses of LSD, which were also positive, but I had a more difficult time meting out dosage. For the record, putting a tab in purified water will not extract LSD from thick blotter very well. But putting it in Everclear will.<br /><br />It&#039;s awesome to see other people talking about microdosing. Tripping has been amazing for me, but I think the intensity of the experience scared me away from really using it as a tool for self-exploration. The micros allow for a smoother flow of ideas and emotions, and I feel like they are subtly doing the work for me. For anyone interested, I would definitely recommend trying out microdosing--but keep in mind that dosage is key. If it&#039;s making you giddy, it&#039;s likely too much. I save the fun-sized doses for once-in-a-while events, and treat the micros as medicine.

				@cricketplank, @joeybob, @starry eyed and anyone else microdosing already, how many days are you waiting before microdosing again? Have you noticed any tolerance building up? Also are you taking your dose in the morning? And for those microdising LSD, are you having a hard time falling asleep at night or are your sleep habits normal?<br /><br />Thanks

Please keep us updated, and also let&#039;s keep this thread going so maybe some vendors will make micro-dosing an easier possibility. Also: would it be possible for you to share your dosing methods? For example, what you used to dilute the 2C-I (mixture, amounts, methodology, dosing schedule). Thank you so much for this...I think this could be a new breakthrough for medicine. These drugs are very powerful for the psychedelic states they produce, but they also are vehicles of truth that I think can be used in this way to help people enter more consistent and peaceful states of being.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sure thing, thanks for the interest :)<br /><br />I went to the local corner store and grabbed a nip of 100 proof vodka(they only had root beer flavored, yummm, haha) , and this is what I am using to dilute the compounds.&nbsp; I used brown vials(think liquid LSD) for storage, you can find these cheaply online, check eBay ;).&nbsp; I also have small 1cc plastic tipped syringes for measuring the liquid, I believe these are originally for filling printer ink cartridges, also can be had for cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can use whatever you like for measuring/storing, as the method will remain the same.&nbsp; As long as you can extract about the same amount of liquid from your storage container each time.<br /><br />To create the liquid concoction at the right dosage level, just takes some basic math.<br /><br />First off I didn&#039;t want to count each drop that went into the vial.&nbsp; So I took one of my small plastic syringes, blocked up the bottom so no liquid could escape.&nbsp; I then took the dropper from one of my vials and filled it with the Vodka.&nbsp; Then I carefully dripped it into my plastic syringe one drop at a time and counted to 20 drops.&nbsp; This filled the syringe to the 3rd line, so now I know if I fill the syringe to that point I will get 20 drops of liquid, if I fill it to the 6th line I will have 40 drops, and the 9th line will be 80 drops.<br /><br />So when you know how many drops are in a set amount of liquid, it&#039;s time to measure the compound.&nbsp; I wanted to create a dosage that would be a 1/16th of the lowest threshold dose.&nbsp; The lowest threshold dose is 2mg, so that means for ever 1mg I would need 8 drops of liquid.&nbsp; I figured it would be good to start with around 20mg of compound, which would call for 160 drops.<br /><br />I measured out the 2C-I powder, but went slightly over at 24mg, which isn&#039;t a big deal as the same math applies.&nbsp; The powder went right into an empty vial.&nbsp; *I usually measure my compounds on top of a small piece of tinfoil on top of my scale.&nbsp; This just happened to make it easy to get into the vial as well which was nice.<br /><br />So now I have 24mg 2C-I.&nbsp; Time for a little math.<br /><br />24 x 8(drops per mg) = 192<br /><br />I know the measurement for 20 drops from earlier.&nbsp; So now divide the total drops by 20.<br /><br />184 / 20 = 9.6 (I rounded this down to 9.5)<br /><br />Now remember, my measurement for 20 drops is the third full line on the syringe.&nbsp; So I would need to fill the syringe to the 3rd line 9 times, then once more at the 1.5 line(for the last half mg).&nbsp; <br /><br />So what I did was I filled the syringe with Vodka to the 9th line 3 times, each measurement going directly into the vial with the 2C-I, for 180 drops of liquid.&nbsp;

				@zipstyle - You are very welcome, I&#039;m happy to help.&nbsp; That Wiki was an interesting read.&nbsp; It&#039;s interesting how it effects problem solving.&nbsp; I find myself completing tasks more easily lately, when before I would almost half do a task then return to it later.&nbsp; I think this all has to do with the level of focus and a certain desire to progress.<br /><br />I also find myself thinking about life more and more.&nbsp; And the fact that we have such a short time here on Earth.&nbsp; So there is a need to learn how to focus in on what is truly important in our lives, and let the B.S. that arises here and there during the day to day to melt away.&nbsp; There is only so much one can think about in one day, so don&#039;t become too attached to things that are of no consequence.

				I&#039;ve also been microdosing galindoi shrooms for awhile now. usually every weekend when I go out with my roomates they like to either get stoned or drink a few beers.<br />I find that if I eat about 1 gram or 2/3 of a gram I can have a good time and feel a bit inebriated.

				from the book: &quot;The essential psychedelic guide&quot; by D.M.Turner<br /><br />P.22 and following, just some passages from the book... <br /><br />&lt;&lt;<br />unless worked with solid crystalline substance to produce the consumable form, their information is just hearsy or a personal estimate. Even after many years and several hundred doses of LSD, I have never had an accurate gauge to measure dosage. My description of dosage levels is an estimate from what I&#039;ve been told over the years, matched up to levels of intensity described by users of Sandoz LSD which was packaged in certified amounts. <br />...<br />Like most other psychedelics, LSD produces a tolerance lasting two or three days. Consuming an equivalent amount during this period will not get one as high the second time. (note by R5: this is not about micro-dosing but about full-on psychedelic doses - still I found it interesting to add in this discussion)<br />...<br />LSD is the most transparant of the psychedelics. It has the least &quot;signature&quot; to it. <br />...<br />After becoming familiar with the experience some people drop acid to perform complex computer programming, perform live music on stage, or do other tasks that require control and a strong connection with the physical plane. Frequent users may be able to blink their eyes, snap out of the high, and see things as they do in regular consciousness while on the peak of a 500ug trip. <br />...<br />LSD has the ability of allowing one&#039;s mind to penetrate things very deeply. <br />...<br />The negative aspects of LSD&#039;s signature that many users report are a &quot;metallic edge&quot; (a slight grating on the nerves), and sometimes an overbearing intensity that some psychedelics, such as mushrooms, tend not to produce.

				thank you Zipstyle for this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelics_in_problem-solving_experiment<br /><br />Here&#039;s a copy-paste of the part that&#039;s interesting in our discussion:<br />&quot;&quot;James Fadiman is currently conducting a study on micro-dosing for improving normal functioning. Micro-dosing (or sub-perceptual dosing) means taking sub-threshold dose, which for LSD is 10-20 micrograms. The purpose of micro-dosing is not intoxication but enhancement of normal functionality (see nootropic). In this study the volunteers self-administer the drug approximately every third day. They then self-report perceived effects on their daily duties and relationships. Volunteers participating in the study include a wide variety of scientific and artistic professions, such as physician, vocalist, nonfiction writer, environmental expert, film editor, journalist, warehouse manager, researcher, model, musician as well as being student. So far the reports suggest that, in general, the subjects experience normal functioning but with increased focus, creativity and emotional clarity. Albert Hofmann was also aware of micro-dosing and has called it the most under-researched area of psychedelics.&quot;&quot;<br /><br /><br />If anyone else knows where more info can be found, just put the link here and I&#039;ll go copy-paste whatever seems interesting for this thread!<br />

I have decided to stay away from LSD for the time being as I have used it extensively in my life and think I need a decent break. I&#039;m thinking that microdosing may just be the perfect thing to help me get off my ADHD meds and grow into my full potential. Definitely leaning towards AL-LAD, but I&#039;m not sure how I would microdose that besides cutting up the blotter into much smaller squares. It is rather expensive, but I think the wisdom of the ergoloids is very deep and holistic. Or maybe it&#039;s not that expensive. Thoughts, anyone?<br /><br />Excited to be part of this thread :)

Just wanted to share some of my thoughts with you guys.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always taken LSD for the way it kind of reveals the secrets of the universe to me. I always liked how I could figure out these profound realizations. At one point I thought I *needed* LSD if I ever wanted to understand the true mysteries of life and existance. That&#039;s where I got into trouble and went a little too far out and met the spirit (from earlier in the thread). I&#039;ve since realized I don&#039;t need drugs to figure out the universe and that the answers I&#039;m looking for come from within. <br /><br />However, with this very intriguing microdosing idea, this really opens up the internal debate I thought I&#039;d long ago ended with myself. Maybe I do need LSD to understand the universe after all. Just in much smaller quantities. I am interested in the possibility of microdosing to alter the pathways in my brain. LSD has already altered my brain so I know this is possible. (I have permanent acid vision, which I totally enjoy, and did to myself on purpose) I want to alter my brain in a controlled and focused way, so that I can be able to think deeper. And get my answers.<br /><br />The only thing is, I&#039;m concerned about developing a tolerance and having to take more and more. LSD is such a powerful presence in my life, I have to use the utmost caution whenever inviting it back in. I have to make sure that I&#039;m taking it for the right reasons, for one. Also if I&#039;ll be taking it so regularly (in small doses, of course) I need to be absolutely certain it won&#039;t spiral, because that&#039;s what got me in trouble at one point in my life. I&#039;m thinking about microdosing once a week to start out.<br /><br />Peace. You guys are awesome

				I haven&#039;t gotten my vial of &quot;custom made low-dosage LSD&quot; yet, <br />but after all this reading and researching I couldn&#039;t hold my horses anymore...<br />So, after some thinking and preparation, I decided to take 8mg of mescaline HCl this morning in my morning tea...then go for 30 minutes of meditation...<br />The threshold dosage for mescaline HCl is supposed to be around 100mg, that&#039;s why I took a little bit less than 1/10 of that amount and ended up mixing 8mg to my cup of tea with honey. <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping the vial of custom made may arrive tomorrow so that I can (also) start with that...

				So, I just finished my morning meditation (I practice &quot;Transcendental meditation twice a day). <br />I have to say that, by the end of my meditation, I did reach a state of total inner peace and bliss. I don&#039;t know if today was just a good meditation day, or if the mescaline has something to do with it... but I do know that (almost instantly after taking Mahakala&#039;s mescaline HCl) I started to burp a lot for the first 15 - 20 minutes...and that has something to do with the mescaline ;)<br /><br />Right now I feel a bit light headed (I&#039;m one hour in the &quot;experiment&quot;). Untill right before this state of mind I felt a slight pressure in my head (before and after the meditation)... <br /><br /><br /><br />LSD, psilocybine, harmaline, DMR, AL-LAD (?), LSZ (?) are indoles, <br />while mescaline, 2C-B, 2C-... are phenethylamines; I wonder if, in time, we could draw a conclusion towards the effects of the different families of psychedelics used for micro-dosing or if we have to keep looking at the effects product by product...<br /><br />@Zipstyle: <br />Thank you for the link. I&#039;ll have a look at it today and try to copy-paste some to feed our discussion...<br /><br />AL-LAD is certainly also an interesting molecule for micro-dosing. I might try to contact one of the sellers to see if we can work something out... But, when we&#039;re talking about micro-dosing I don&#039;t think there is any product that&#039;s really expensive. Let me put it this way: I&#039;m not familiar with the price of AL-LAD; but normally speaking mescaline is the most expensive psychedelic (about 100$ for 1 dose of 350mg), but the threshold of mescaline is 100mg (so about 25$). If you only need 1/10 of that amount for micro-dosing, or even less, you could very well have 1 micro-dose for 2$. If you buy a gram of mescaline you can make (probably) about 120 micro-doses from it... So, yes, when you buy the product you need some cash - but on the long run I don&#039;t think using such small quantities of the product, even on a daily basis, is really expensive. The same will be true for AL-LAD, LSZ, ... and other &quot;exotic&quot; compounds...<br /><br />@Rastaman Vibration:<br />quote: &quot;the answers I&#039;m looking for come from within&quot; - yes, they certainly do. You don&#039;t need psychedelics to find them. Meditation is probably a better way to achieve that goal - but it&#039;ll take you lots of time (maybe more than 1 lifetime...). What many people who seem to know what they&#039;re talking about say is: &quot;if meditation is walking up the stairs, then meditating while on psychedelics is taking an elevator... Much quicker but with the same final result...&quot;<br /><br />Since you (ab)used LSD so much in the past I&#039;m just having 1 thought: what about micro-doses triggering flash-backs? This is a new idea that just popped in my head, but how do you guys think about this? It seems to me that (almost) everyone involved in this discussion has a (heavy) past with psychedelics. Do you think taking sub-perceptual doses of psychedelics could trigger flash-backs? <br /><br />The tolerance issue seems to not be a problem in the case of micro-dosing. The chemist who&#039;s quoted in James Fadiman&#039;s book thought that such small amounts of (any/the) compound would not trigger any tolerance...but, for maximum effect (and avoiding tolerance) Fadiman also recommends to do only once every 3 days... If you want to micro-dose every day you could alter products: LSD - mescaline - 2C-E, or LSD - psilocybine - 2C-I, or ... the possibilities are huge when you&#039;re looking at altering different products...<br /><br />

				My buddy has been microdosing with .35g of shrooms every day for a while now and he swears by it. He says he is just happier and less anxious and less stressed. I am not entirely convinced it isn&#039;t just psychosomatic, but he is happy with it.

I have been interviewing people across the country who take so-called micro-doses, doses so low that they have no perceptual effects. That means nothing is distorted and that people function normally in their work and relationships. What does appear to be true is that the micro-doses seem to give them additional focus and emotional clarity.<br /><br />One report from a physician says, “Since I started micro-dosing I am in touch with a deep place of ease and beauty, really trusting and with more strength and determination.” (Micro-dosing in this context means 10 mcg of LSD every three days.) An older addiction counselor says, “The sub-threshold doses helped me to be more focused overall with better mental clarity. I was also more energetic with better memory recall. “<br /><br />Albert Hofmann, the chemist who first synthesized LSD, said this was “an under-researched area.” I’m reviewing the first field reports, most of them favorable while a few indicate that it was not a good experience and the subject stopped doing it. It is foolish to assume that any substance, especially those as powerful as psychedelics, are good for everyone. This is absolutely not the case. However, in this new area of research, there are definite possibilities that need to be more rigorously explored.&quot;

				Very good thread and I&#039;ve seen many good arguments have been made already.<br />From my personal knowledge there are at least three different ways on which using micro-dosing is very effective (and in fact it is used many times in two of those circumstances):<br /><br />1) As a sort of &quot;build-up&quot; for the intended journey. Many shamanic cultures do this: they start for a period using much weaker doses of an entheogen before the prescribed day when the full dose is used. The &quot;micro-dosing&quot; is used in conjunction with a ceremony of preparation, lasting for a period of time that has usually a ritualistic significance (as 28 days if the cult is feminine). <br /><br />2) As a a way to cleanse the mind of the individual of all its impurities, and a way to remove all the previous preconditions that the person can have (this can be used in shamanism as a way for the introduction of a candidate to the new framework and micro-dosing is one of the best way to do that). Btw, n. 2 can be used (and it has been used) in the same way - but for a negative purpose - by some &quot;agencies&quot; to brainwash people. It is very efficacious; as you can cleanse your mind from everything that clutters it, you can also do the same plus put the only thing you care to put (that being the only one thing that will remain, will reign supreme).<br /><br />3) to cure or prevent a disease. In many shamanic cultures shamans make the patient use low doses of an entheogen for many consecutive sessions, this is done both as a way for the shaman to better understand the nature of the illness by putting the individual in a better framework on which to work and both for the substance (that is naturally considered a spirit in that case) to help the patient. The decision to use a large dose or a series of micro-doses for what I could understand from the books I&#039;ve read and from personal knowledge is based on the type of trauma and the nature of the same (if the trauma is considered of a natural cause then micro-dosing will be much more commonly used; if witchcraft is suspected however a large and unique dose will be preferred).<br /><br />I&#039;ve used personally micro-dosing to do 1 and 2 many times and it works wonder. Micro-dosing for build-up is either one of my most preferred methods to use DMT when I have to do something that requires a little more of &quot;humpf!&quot; (an example is in my trip report of the June Contest). Micro-dosing for cleansing your mind and body I use cyclically once every 2-3 years to remove loose ends, burdening attachments etc. and to purify my mind from all the filthy, it works wonders; it is for the mind what a vapor-tent is for the body.<br /><br />Instead I don&#039;t have much experience with using micro-dosing for point 3, maybe because luckily I never had serious health problems (but it can be that the use I made of opium/heroin when I was younger took the place of it; it is a period I don&#039;t like to remember too much but I neither repudiate it, everything has its function and it is a step that brings where you are at the current moment).

It is especially important to note, however (and we may be on the same page, but I wanted to stress this point), that doing meditation on psychedelics is only doing 1/2 of the work. You need to meditate or practice a sort of mindfulness in sober life as well in order for the benefits of meditation to really manifest as a part of one&#039;s self. Only meditating on psychedelics is like a person that only takes elevators or escalators and never does any work for himself. He gains weight over time and then becomes immobilized by his own laziness. So I think psychedelics are a way to change perspectives that may be &quot;stuck&quot; in a person&#039;s mind--hence why microdosing is so effective--and then after the use of the medicine, the individual needs to practice what they&#039;ve learned on their own. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173822.msg1280958#msg1280958">Quote from: RaFaeL5 on June 27, 2013, 09:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Since you (ab)used LSD so much in the past I&#039;m just having 1 thought: what about micro-doses triggering flash-backs?

Maybe trigger some latent anxiety or traumatic memory from taking a specific chemical, but I doubt it could trigger full-on flashbacks. I must say, however, that I require much smaller doses of psychedelics now in comparison to when I was younger. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because of purity or mindset, but I am pretty sure it has to do with mindset. I think I require much smaller doses because my mind is already very close to the psychedelic place because I have lived out many of their teachings. When I was younger, I still paid very strict attention to the quality of the psychedelics (and all other drugs) I was ingesting, but sometimes would take 4 stamps to have a strong trip. Now, I can&#039;t really see myself needing that much. I feel like I could achieve the same benefits with 2 stamps, and probably 1 stamp could give me a trip that I could learn from. <br /><br />Love your posts RaFaeL5!<br /><br />/end rant :)

				@R5, yes the flashbacks are something to think about. Smoking weed can trigger flashbacks for me, but it doesn&#039;t keep me from toking. (I&#039;m a pretty heavy smoker ;D ) The flashbacks only last like 30 seconds or so, and I&#039;ve gotten pretty good at dealing with it. I know what it is, so there&#039;s no panic when it comes on. I just know to wait for it to pass. So I guess the possibility of triggering flashbacks with microdosing LSD isn&#039;t enough to deter me from doing it.<br /><br />I like what you said about needing more than 1 lifetime to discover truth through meditation alone. I practice meditiation on a (somewhat) regular basis and have been experiencing many positives from it. But I&#039;m really into the idea of microdosing as a way of deepening and enhancing these benefits. The key is actually doing the work (meditation). I think part of the reason why I ran into trouble in the past was because I wasn&#039;t doing the work, and using drugs as a shortcut to enlightenment. <br /><br />@BlackIris, I find this idea of microdosing as a way to cure or prevent dissease very interesting. Do you have any more info on this? (links?) Thanks.

				I was hoping my custom made vials would arrive today...but sadly it&#039;s not the case... how, well, we&#039;ll just have a loaded weekend then&nbsp; :P<br /><br />@Blackiris: thank you for your input - I had some idea about those 3 different uses but the difference between them wasn&#039;t so clear. NOW you were able to clearly specify the purposes and means of the different approaches. It all makes sense...<br /><br />@Zipstyle: wow, a lot to comment to...and a lot has been commented :-)<br />I took 8mg yesterday, my GF is on 6mg today. I&#039;m waiting to have her comments/remarks before posting about our first experiences... soon!<br /><br />About the AL-LAD: I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to cut 1 blotter in 30 equal parts... we&#039;ll have to find another way... 1 solution could be to put blotters in pure alcohol and re-dissolve the AL-LAD, but you&#039;d probably be loosing quite some product and you risk dissolving undesired products (such as ink). Another solution is to get hold of a vial of the product and then dilute it to the wanted concentration/quantity per drop. I&#039;m looking at this solution for now and hope I&#039;ll find a way both for AL-LAD as for LSZ - you&#039;ll be kept in the loop... <br /><br />I totally agree with you regarding the meditation, the way of &quot;tuning your life&quot;, the daily practice and &quot;doing the work&quot;. Thank you for clarifying this; I probably should have been more specific from the start. <br /><br />Regarding the quantity of LSD when tripping: I also feel that I can use way less than before (in my &quot;Golden Days&quot;) and still have a similar effect - but, I can also take much higher doses and still totally control/enjoy/let go during the trip. I do believe that the daily practice of meditation is a key to successful use of psychedelics! <br />Haha, I have to smile when I see that you cared a lot about the quality of your stuff when you were young - I didn&#039;t care at all and (literally) put everything in my body that came by... With time I&#039;ve learned to enjoy better quality of products, more special products and being sober in between my visits to Lalaland! <br /><br />@Rastaman Vibration: I suggest all of us who are experimenting with micro-doses keep an eye open for (small) flashbacks. As you said you&#039;re used to them (and I guess many of us are) but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that it could be harmful to have unwanted psychedelic experiences at the wrong moment. Since the whole point of micro-dosing is to take it when you need to perform better, often in public; it would be a huge step back if micro-dosing would trigger flashbacks... Normally I only have flashbacks (if I have them - very seldom) during the 2 or 3 weeks after a full-on psychedelic experience so I don&#039;t think it will be an issue for me personally, but I do urge all of you who are trying micro-doses to keep this possibility in mind... &quot;Better to be prepared for nothing, than not prepared for something.&quot;<br /><br />@PurpleBalloons54: thank you, nice to welcome you here.

				Let me put a small copy-paste here from an answer of DMtryptamine285 to one of my questions in his forum thread (link = http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176073.msg1283223#msg1283223 ). <br /><br />&quot;Looking at whether or not a substance has an indole ring is not the best way of classifying psychedelic compounds as many non psychedelic compounds contain an indole ring (such as pindolol, melatonin, and others).<br /><br />I like to look at it as tryptamines, phenethylamines, ergolines, arylcyclohexylamine, allylbenzenes, and diterpines.<br /><br />Tryptamines include all variations of DMT (including psilocybin, 5-meo-dmt, ect, ect.) as well as AMT, Ibogaine and many other compounds which contain the tryptamine structure.<br /><br />Phenethylamines include the 2C-X, NBOMEs, mescaline, amphetamines, ect<br /><br />I believe Ergolines often contain both the tryptamine and phenethylamine structure, and would be any compound isolated from ergot, or any modification of such compound... LSA, LSD, ALD, LSH, emoclavine, ect.<br /><br />arylcyclohexylamines include PCP, MXE, Ketamine, ect.<br /><br />Allylbenzenes include a wide range of compounds which can be converted to psychedelic, dissociative, or sedative compounds in vivo when certain enzymes are induced or inhibited, this can occur naturally in certain people who are naturally deficient in certain enzymes. (Myristicin, elemicin, dill-apiole, ect...)<br /><br />Diterpines have a wide range of effects depending on the specific compound, they originate from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. The most well known psychoactive diterpine is salvinorin A (derived from salvia divinorum).&quot;<br /><br /><br />I found this to be usefull information for us too... thank you DMtriptamine285<br />

				hi<br /><br />so on my first trip or whatever with a 2/9th of a 200ucg tab!<br />I guess the dose is about 25-40ucg for my almost 200# body.<br /><br />4 hours since I took it... 2/9th of a tab is like less than 2mmx4mm ! guess how potent the drug is... <br /><br />So what am/was I feeling...<br />0. It took about 30-45 mins to kick in, but I went off to sleep after taking it on empty stomach, and no water..<br />1. 2 hrs later I wake up (in the morning)..<br />I am looking at my quilt and the design on it looks very high resolution like UHD...&nbsp; <br />no colors don&#039;t look so pronounced but everything is high resolution... or so it feels...<br />I close my eyes, and it feels like a music visualizer drawing random patterns all around... <br />2. I get up and feels like I am drunk... but not really drunk... &quot;inebriated&quot; as they say... may be<br />I guess the stuff relaxes some of the muscles, and ligaments, so it gives a feeling like drunk physically...<br />3. Generally feeling happy... (I guess they say if you are happy you will feel more happy, if you are unhappy you will feel more unhappy) I actually went into spiritual meditation as I dozed of with the tab in my mouth... or did I ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To get this feeling I guess I can to drink 4 shots of vodka in quick succession... however this just seems to be so much more<br />persistent... the vodka will wear off as soon as you eat something or drink a lot of water... <br />4. Not sure if it is wearing off, but feeling light headed... 4 hrs into it, Can think... may be not straight... I bet I cannot drive... <br />I wont.. <br />5. No hallucinations...or is it.... <br />6. Feeling emotionally weak... I guess if someone screams at me I will melt, or will affect me a lot... having a good old friend with me will be great...&nbsp; Its great its morning and spring/summer with the birds chirping... very nice... <br /><br />*** now like six hours.... <br />...feel less drowsy, <br />.. just was relaxing on the bed and happened to look at the textured walls... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I could see the textures walking all over the wall... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; just focus your mind on a particular spot on the wall and then look ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; close one eye and they still move, both eyes they move in binocular vision.. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; actually you can see them overlapping each other... may be that&#039;s what they call breathing walls<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; or may be that occurs with a higher dose... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;actually if you look a t spot casually nothing happens, the moment you start focusing on a spot all the magic seems to happen.<br />&nbsp; The finer the grain of the texture the more pronounced the effect... <br /><br />*** now seven hours almost, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The wall textures are now stable...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;feel even less drowsy, but still not normal... <br /><br />*** now more than 12 hrs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I am back to normal wits I guess.. (I was in normal wits all the time though)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;No longer feeling drowzy or anything... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Just woke up from a nap, and still had closed eye visuals, and after opening eyes, still could see wall grain moving... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;but its pretty normal now, or may be I have learned to move the wall grain now...&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />*** next day..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Over 24hr hours, and no effects whatsoever.. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;just my own self again.... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;waiting for my next trip... <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My question to fellow users is <br />- are these effects normal for 25-40ucg doses ?<br />- what would I see less for 1/9th of a tab/15-20ucg<br />- what would be the effect for doubling the dose ? 50-80ucg ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

The micro-dosing as in point 1 (the one for increasing the power of a full dose) is often tied in shamanism with point 2 - i.e. the micro-dosing in an initiation ceremony provides both results, the one of intensifying the final step and the one of preparing the candidate for it.<br /><br />By introducing the candidate through the steps meant for the ceremony via micro-dosing the substance you cleanse him/her of all preconceptions and more or less &quot;false&quot; vision of reality (in the point of view of the framework the new-born shaman will have to work) and in the meantime you introduce him/her to a new vision of the world that it&#039;s at the base of the framework the individual will be introduced fully in the final initiation (that will recreate the same methodology in an either more direct way with the spirits by dismemberment and re-composition, being born to a new life). In psychological terms (as evidenced by Charles Brenner) this creation of a framework is called the &quot;subjective synthesis&quot; that&#039;s at the base of a working modus operandi for the unconscious (shamanic tribes are much more advanced than people think for what it concerns certain topics, especially for what it concerns the &quot;internal states&quot;; in that field they are almost light years above the western world, only just recently psychologist are coming to the same understandings about things and why certain methodologies are adopted).<br /><br />There are other ways to do the same as some tribes/cultures don&#039;t use micro-dosing to cleanse and rebuild the candidate, but the use of a substance to do the same is one of the most utilized methods. When this last is not used, very crude methods are many times adopted instead to have the same deep emotional impact (as putting the candidate in an icy lake, going through intense regimens of sleep/food deprivation, physical tortures etc. etc.) but the result is not always so full anyway because a component of these plants has also to do with the &quot;teacher&quot; that resides in them.

				@ M8R-3jt393: Hi, thank you for sharing your micro-dosing experience with us... Regarding the quantity you took, it&#039;s very clear that every one has a different reaction towards LSD and thus needs a different quantity of the product to achieve the goal (in case of micro-dosing the goal is NOT to trip, not even slightly, but to enhance cognitive capacities, emotional balance, psychological health, ...). When I read you message, it seems to me that the quantity you took was (from the point of view of sub-perceptual dosage) too big. <br />Most of the info we&#039;ve assembled here suggest doses between 5 and 20ug are ample to achieve the desired results - with probably often better results with the lower dose of 5ug than with the higher dose of 20ug. Your 25 - 40ug dosage was probably to high... If you&#039;re thinking about repeating this experience I would suggest you take half the portion or even one quarter of the portion you took on your previous attempt. <br />I&#039;d love to know how that would work for you!<br /><br />@ALL: here&#039;s a little copy-paste from the interview with James Fadiman<br />(http://www.bestofyoutoday.com/ask-nutrition-expert/learn-what-effects-low-dosage-psychedelic-have-your-mental-health) - thank you, Zipstyle for sharing the link!<br /><br />BOYT: Could taking extremely small micro-doses of psychedelics, a dose so low that its effects are barely noticeable, benefit people&#039;s everyday performance?<br />Dr. James Fadiman: I am involved in this research right now. I have been interviewing people across the country who take so-called micro-doses, doses so low that they have no perceptual effects. That means nothing is distorted and that people function normally in their work and relationships. What does appear to be true is that the micro-doses seem to give them additional focus and emotional clarity.<br />One report from a physician says, “Since I started micro-dosing I am in touch with a deep place of ease and beauty, really trusting and with more strength and determination.” (Micro-dosing in this context means 10 mcg of LSD every three days.) An older addiction counselor says, “The sub-threshold doses helped me to be more focused overall with better mental clarity. I was also more energetic with better memory recall. “<br />Albert Hofmann, the chemist who first synthesized LSD, said this was “an under-researched area.” I’m reviewing the first field reports, most of them favorable while a few indicate that it was not a good experience and the subject stopped doing it. It is foolish to assume that any substance, especially those as powerful as psychedelics, are good for everyone. This is absolutely not the case. However, in this new area of research, there are definite possibilities that need to be more rigorously explored.<br /><br />BOYT: How has psychedelic use affected your life?<br />Dr. James Fadiman: Most important, probably, is that my worldview has broadened considerably. I am far more open as a researcher to investigating phenomena, including spiritual experience, which many people in science in general and in psychology in particular deny even exist.<br />I also believe that my own relationships are vastly more loving than they were before. At a personal moment-by-moment level, I find myself far more alive and open to the extraordinary interconnected complexity of the natural world. I feel driven to help others to recognize our cultural disconnection with nature and the imperative to reconnect. I believe that only by being more cooperative with natural forces and other species can we, as much as is still possible, repair the damage that our lack of awareness of being embedded in nature has caused. Before psychedelics, I would not have understood a word of what I just said.<br /><br />

				Then, <br />I also have some nice info: I got my first &quot;custom made micro-dosing vials&quot; this morning. Will start experimenting in a few days (I need a rest after the weekend before starting). <br />The vials look very good (good quality of glass work) and I hope we&#039;ll soon be able to all get some vials of 5ug per drop (that&#039;s the concentration I asked for). <br />As soon as the vendor is ready to ship international I&#039;ll post his name here!<br /><br />Also, a second vendor contacted me a few days ago. He just decided to make a custom made vial too... I&#039;m sure this vendor has great product and stealth (I ordered from him before) and thus I&#039;m very happy to see that even more vendors are looking at our little forum thread and are willing to help us in our endeavor! <br />As soon as I&#039;ve gotten this vial (and tested it) I&#039;ll make the name of this vendor public (if he allows me to do such). <br /><br />Then, <br />regarding the AL-LAD (and possibly the LSZ) I have no new news for now - but things looked promising a few days ago so I&#039;m sure everything will work out! I&#039;ll also keep you updated on this part... <br /><br />And, last but not least, here is our final thought on the micro-dose of mescaline me and my girl took last week... I took 8mg one day, she took 6mg the next day. <br />I was in a &quot;normal state&quot; when I started the experience, my GF was exhausted from 2 nights with very little sleep...<br />We both felt &quot;lightheaded&quot; for the most part of the day - this is not what we were looking for and thus we&#039;re thinking that micro-dosing mescaline will either have to be done with even lower doses (1, 2, 3, 4 mg?). But Mahakala&#039;s mescaline&#039;s light-headiness was quite enjoyable, so we might do it again during the weekend (when having this light-headiness is our aim). <br />Also, I felt a huge energy-rush from +4h to +7h. Almost as if I had taken some amphetamine. This was very nice and totally unexpected. The energy was so nice and strong, that this could have been used by someone who&#039;d want to have a night out! <br />My GF had some problems with orientation (but then again, she mostly has LOL). I didn&#039;t have this &quot;problem&quot; at all (but then again, I never have ;D). <br />I had almost no appetite at the +2h mark, my GF had lots of hunger at the +1h mark - so that was quite different...but once she started eating she soon felt like she didn&#039;t want anything more to eat, and with me it was the contrary: once I started to eat I enjoyed it and it really tasted very good so I got more and more appetite. <br />For me it was clear that I smelled much &quot;more&quot; and with a lot more of &quot;detail&quot; (this started at +2h and went on till about +5h), but my GF had no such impression. I could smell every flower at a few meters distance!<br /><br />I believe the biggest difference between her and me was the tiredness she had, which I didn&#039;t have at all...<br />But what I think I can already conclude is that, with 8mg taken in the morning (followed by 30min of meditation) I had a nice day, but not with the expected results: a light head (most of the day) and a huge energy-burst (3 to 4h in the afternoon). <br />I did lots of stuff that had been &quot;hanging around&quot; for a while and that needed to be taken care of, so that&#039;s nice - but I rather would have NOT had that lightheaded feeling... anyway, next experiment with a micro-dose of mescaline will probably be done by my GF (after a few days of good sleep) to see how she reacts to it then. Or maybe i&#039;ll take a smaller dosage of mescaline from Gammagoblin to see how that would work (difference in quantity and from a different seller)...<br />From there we&#039;ll see... <br />

				So, <br /><br />this time my GF took the first micro-dose. <br />She hasn&#039;t wrote her report on this yet, so I can&#039;t tell you much more yet - <br />but I can allready tell you that she&#039;s very impressed and really likes it (11ug taken in the morning before breakfast)...

				I took 50ug today. I had to give a training lecture all day, which is emotionally draining. So 50ug means I can stay engaged with people and put some passion into my subject.<br /><br />Works great.<br /><br />I am a big fan of micro dosing for work, family events and even music festivals. Sometimes it&#039;s nice just to add an edge in the right setting. No need to go balls out. I have tried micro dosing 2C-B, MDMA, and even Ayahuasca. Of all these I find LSD the most rewarding and functional. The others place too much impairment on cognitive thinking. low dose 2C-B can be good in social settings, but bad for working on. Although I have low dosed MDMA at work evening social events to good effect.<br /><br />FH<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				hi all, just wanted to check back in as I have been away for a while.<br />Second microdose hit me hard - RaFael5 I agree that less is more, about 5ug may be optimal for me,<br />don&#039;t have the chance to catch up on all the lovely discussion that is going on still<br /><br />My note of input is this<br />When one approaches psychedelics/power plants for healing as opposed to tripping, they will give you healing, but that work is very tough, as it brings you to the &quot;bad trip&quot; which is the place where light and consciousness can help to unravel the darkened patterns, usually built as protection around the crystals of divinity that may have been disconnected from your oneness through whatever ego-istic actions.<br /><br />For those beginning to microdose for the benefit of their lives, with meditation particularly, don&#039;t forget that you may encounter significant barriers and troubles, and don&#039;t be afraid to hold close to your spirituality and guidance in whatever form connects with your heart.<br />Don&#039;t want to sound preachy, but my &quot;microdosing&quot; so far is very similar to my non-microdosing which I have spoken about here previously, it is part of the Great Work, so expect confrontation and challenge, which is our great friend confronting us with the things that are inhibiting our happiness.<br /><br />Peace and Love

				My micro-dosing experience:<br /><br />I had a hit of acid I was saving in my freezer. I had some extended downtime this week due to the 4th of July holiday, so I decided to experiment. ;D<br /><br />I took my X-Acto knife and scored the blotter into 16ths. I cut one piece and ate it soon after waking up (wouldn&#039;t exactly call it morning :P ). But then the mailman came, and I received some hash oil I had ordered earlier in the week. I absolutely had to try it, so I may have messed up the results of my experiment a bit. Also the oil was really killing, so I kept smoking it all day ;D <br /><br />Some notable results from my experiment:<br />+30 min: Got a nice rush of energy and excitement. Very typical of an acid trip coming on, just less intense and very enjoyable<br /><br />+1-3hrs: Well the mailman came around this time and I just had to get high, so its hard to tell if the results were from the microdose of LSD or from the hash oil. But I felt lightheaded and not too energetic or productive. Still very enjoyable feeling, tho<br /><br />+5hrs: Feeling very energetic and productive. Hung out with some friends, and discovered I was also feeling very social. (witty, quick to the punch, etc). Also noticed my vision was more tweaked than usual. Tripped out on some visuals for a bit. (I don&#039;t need much :P)<br /><br />+7 Still feeling energetic and productive. Experienced a flash of the intense focus that I&#039;m seeking to gain with this experiment, though it was short lived (probably because I kept smoking the hash throughout the day)<br /><br />+9 Feeling introspective and thoughtful<br /><br /><br />Overall my experiment has been very enjoyable. I might try it again tomorrow if I&#039;m feeling up to it. If I do, though, I&#039;ll try to refrain from smoking any weed, as it seems to interfere with the focus and energy level. Gonna be tough tho! ;)<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />Forgot to mention, I don&#039;t have any way of knowing the exact dosage I took. The acid I had was unperf white paper. But I think it was a good dosage. Didn&#039;t feel like a trip at all, just regular reality altered ever so slighly.

				first micro-dose of LSD -thursday 06/06/2013<br /><br />The setting for this first micro-dose was certainly not perfect… I had only slept about 4.5h and had to wake up at 5.30 in the morning to get the right tide…<br />But regarding how I think/feel about micro-dosing, I believe you should use it as a medicine and thus also take it when the set &amp; setting are not perfect…<br />Thus, I woke up at 5.30 AM, went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, took the vial and put 2 drops of each 5.5microgram on my tongue - I estimated 11 microgram to be a good &quot;starting dose&quot;. From there on, I&#039;ll see if less is needed or more is desirable…<br /><br />This morning I had no time to meditate after micro-dosing, instead I had to prepare the fishing gear to get at the beach for the good tide… so I just waited 15minutes (while preparing stuff) before drinking my morning thee and leaving the house… <br /><br />Off course, I could still feel the drops on my tongue - this very typical sensation of acid, I couldn&#039;t describe it, but if you&#039;ve ever put a strong, pure blotter on your tongue you&#039;ll know what I mean. By the way: I could feel this sensation the whole day until my nap - just 11 microgram were enough to create this lasting sensation on my tongue for at least 10 o&#039;clock!&nbsp; <br /><br />After 20 minutes or so I started to have a very slight headache. Knowing this was caused by the LSD in combination with the tiredness/lack of sleep, I just focused on it for a minute while driving the car and it went away. <br /><br />Once I got at the beach, I parked the car and went as quick as I could to the shore. Just in time for the perfect tide. The sun was already up and shining threw a foggy cloud that hung above the sea. <br /><br />As always I enjoyed my time alone on the beach, standing 50m on the seabed, wading in the small waves...a LOT. <br />It&#039;s the nicest way I know to start my day. <br />Is it the micro-dose, or is it just &quot;normal&quot;, but I saw a lot of things that morning. Things I might have seen otherwise, but I might just as well not have seen, or at least not have noted them even if I &quot;saw&quot; them… A lot of small fish jumping around while being hunted by bigger fish (those are the ones I was after). Sometimes I would walk threw huge clouds of little sandals, as I never saw before - are those things just &quot;details&quot; that I oversee on my &quot;normal days&quot; or is all of this a pure coincidence? <br /><br />Quite in the beginning of my fishing I hooked a crab, haha - my day started well and with humor! Then for a long time I was just enjoying to be there, to see the sun rise with changing colors and intensity, to see the foggy clouds dissipate and turn into a clear blue open sky, to hear the waves rolling on the beach or banging against the poles of the mussel farm, to smell the iodine in the air, with a faint aroma of algae… <br />Then, on the second half of the fishing trip I hooked a huge sandeels,&nbsp; bigger than I had ever seen before. Off course this was not the fish that I was after, but it was beautiful to hold it in my hands anyway… the animal was wounded by the hook so I decided to use it as bait for a while, then I released it so it could go back into his ecosystem and be food for other bigger or smaller creatures of the sea. <br /><br />Right after that, I saw a huge seal about 30m from me - it must have been the biggest seal I ever saw (that I&#039;m sure of, this has nothing to do with the micro-dose). Just his head was already twice the size of a football… did the seal eat the dead sandeel floating in the current? I&#039;ll never know, but I like to think that the small animal didn&#039;t die for nothing - that he was used as food by other elements of his biotope…thus participating in the &quot;chain of life&quot;.<br /><br />Around 8.30 the tide had become to strong to wade in the sea, so I decided to go back to the car. During the drive back to our little house I noted some difference in my consciousness. It was like if I was high on some very good sharas or so, but then again with much more focus than when I&#039;m sober… a bit a strange combination of both being relaxed and enjoying and being concentrated and &quot;sharp to the edge&quot;. <br /><br />When I got home I made a coffee for the Missis and went up to wake her up with it. After that we had to do some domestic tasks, I also went to the bakery and to the market. Relaxed and focused. <br />By then I started to get very hungry, so I really did enjoy a nice breakfast with her (by then I was already awake for 5h, without food - something I couldn&#039;t have done without the acid, at least not with such ease; that I&#039;m sure of!). <br /><br />Then a normal saturday followed, but I was so tired that I went for a siesta from 15 to 17.30. Man, did I sleep well! I immediately felt asleep (something that mostly doesn&#039;t go that smoothly, certainly not in the afternoon). It was a very deep sleep and I have no memories of any dream. When I woke up it took me a while to be &quot;fresh&quot; again, and by then I didn&#039;t feel anything from the micro-dose anymore (or if I did only an a sub-perceptual level). <br /><br />I prepared a delicious dinner for us, sea-food &quot;à volonté&quot; and we had our dinner until 22h. Then we watched a stupid movie (&quot;Dragons and dungeons&quot; - spare yourself of seeing it, not worth the loss of time) and my GF went to sleep a bit past midnight. <br />Even if I woke up at 5.30 that morning, I still didn&#039;t feel very tired, so I decided to spend some more time on the SR forum and ultimately I went to bed around 2 AM in the morning. I know I was awake for almost 21h by then (with a siesta in between), but I really didn&#039;t feel that tired. Is this because of the micro-dose, or because of the quality of the sleep during the siesta? If it&#039;s because of this second factor, then: was the quality of the sleep during this siesta a result of the micro-dose in the morning or not? I don&#039;t know which of the 2 explanations is the right one, but in any case the micro-dose probably had something to do with it… <br /><br />After 9h of sleep (!) I woke up this morning at 11 AM. Totally rested and satisfied. <br /><br />The set &amp; setting were certainly not perfect for this first experience and I hope that I&#039;ll have had more sleep by the time I&#039;ll do my second micro-dose, but I&#039;m quite sure that the micro-dose enabled me to see more details, to experience more fully parts of my day. Maybe to do more during my day also… and it feels as if today the writing goes easier than it mostly does - my words come quicker and it seems that my (english) vocabulary has more words in it than it mostly does… is that just a wrong impression - or is this (one of the) benefits of having micro-dosed yesterday? <br /><br />Next experience is planned for tuesday, probably with only 1 drop of 5.5 microgram… <br /><br />

				Microdosed again today. Again, very positive experience. Didn&#039;t do a very good job of not smoking weed&nbsp; :-\ but did&#039;t smoke nearly as much as the other day.<br /><br />Felt light headed again about an hour or so after ingesting, so that&#039;s definitely from the LSD. I&#039;d like to try a smaller dose and see if that still happens, but that&#039;s not going to be possible at the moment. I dont think I can cut that paper I have into any smaller of a piece.<br /><br />Also when I smoked weed for the 1st time today, about 2.5 hrs after ingesting, it got me really fucked up! I just took one very small bong rip. Luckily it didn&#039;t kill my energy or really mess up my focus. It just got me super loaded ;D<br /><br />I had a chance to meditate for a while, and it was very productive. Also I definitely felt a boost in creativity and focus. <br /><br />Some other notabables to report:<br />- Microdosing LSD does not seem to interfere with my sleeping patterns, thankfully. <br />- Microdosing LSD does not seem to cause my tolerance to build up. This was my main concern about microdosing regularly, and it doesnt seem to be an issue. Big relief there.<br />- Havent had any full blown &quot;flashbacks&quot; (this was brought up earlier in the thread), though even a little tiny bit of LSD does affect my vision in a very noticable way. This can definitely get annoying, especially if I&#039;m microdosing and expecting to be functional. <br /><br />I can totally see doing this on a regular basis. I know there was some discussion about doing it 3x a week. Any information about optimal frequency would be appreciated.<br /><br />;D

				great thread guys! interesting to read about all your different experiences&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I have a question because I am not so much experienced with Lucy: <br /><br />&nbsp;- when I cut one blotter for 4/6/8 little parts, what is the safest place to store them so that the &quot;magic stuff&quot; doesnt evaporate??? in a book? in a dark cupboard?<br /><br />I see people try different dosage but its difficult to decide:<br />&nbsp;- I am still curious: Should I start with 28ug, 20 ug, 15ug or 11ug ????<br /><br />People say small dosage allows them to be more concentrated without really tripping and be able to socialize, to be creative, to work.<br />&nbsp;- Is it possible to work while having a small micro-dose? Like writing reports, making calculation, checking accounts and so on? <br /><br />Cheers<br />

				@ /I_Surf_Worm_Holes : thank you for joining and giving us the info you have. I hope to hear more from you now or when you started micro-dosing again... <br />No one yet who wrote about micro-dosing 2C-D, but that will probably be resolved soon... <br /><br />@ Rastaman Vibration : nice to see that you continue on your Road... how much are you taking now (estimate)? I&#039;d be interested in knowing how the experience is for you when you don&#039;t go the Ganga-way...maybe next time? It seems that many people who&#039;ve micro-dosed for a while didn&#039;t feel the urge to smoke/drink/snort, so this might very well happen to you also if that&#039;s one of your goals...<br />Regarding how often it should be done, Fadiman seems to recommend once every 3 days (so that&#039;s what we&#039;re trying out now - my GF had her second micro-dose today, as soon as I know more about it I&#039;ll share it here). <br /><br />@ Cricketplank: I&#039;ve been thinking about micro-dosing marihuana also. Personally I&#039;d make some (indian) bhaang and try to find a way to micro-dose that, but the biggest difficulty with weed will probably be the dosage - so maybe making a tincture (in alcohol) is a better way to do it... <br /><br />@ chil: I&#039;m trying to find/convince sellers to start making custom made micro-dosing vials of LSD, or lay low dose blotters (5ug or so). I hope some seller will accept to start to make it in (bigger) quantities so that it can be offered on the Road... right now I have 1 seller who&#039;s waiting for new xTal and who might be making some vials once he has them. The seller who sent me the first vial I got told me that he wasn&#039;t willing to make much more of them (not for now at least) but I hope he&#039;ll change his mind (YES YOU, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!). <br /><br />&nbsp;@ Real_Drugs: I&#039;m looking for people who&#039;ve tried to micro-dose MDMA. Would you be interested in trying it? I&#039;d say that 3 to 4mg would probably be a right portion to start with... <br /><br />@blackya: keep the blotters that you cut in the same way as you keep your un-cut blotters (in a book, in a zipp-bag with a cigaret paper, ...). Just beware to NOT touch the blotter with your hands (or anything wet) while cutting them. <br />About the dosage: start as low as possible, then - if necessary - build up from there. We did 11ug (my GF and I) but our next dosage is/will be 5.5ug. I really believe &quot;less is more&quot; in this specific situation...<br />And once you&#039;ve found the right dosage for you, then it&#039;s not a problem to work on it (many reports even say the work goes better, quicker, nicer, ...). <br /><br />@ALL: I&#039;m so happy about where this thread is going, about how it&#039;s going and about who&#039;s been brought to it! THANK YOU ALL!!!

				I promised you to write about my GF&#039;s first micro-dosing experience, so here it goes...<br />she took 11ug in the morning on an empty stomach and then meditated for half an hour. <br /><br />Her set &amp; setting were not perfect: she had lots of back pain and even needed to take a pain-killer during the day. <br />The effects that she felt during the day were: <br />at first a slight change in her visual perception (more color, more detail, a different depth in her vision - extremely light difference) and a very &quot;free&quot; feeling<br />after 3h she started to think more out of the box, she realized what her opportunities were (both private as professional) <br />she wanted to do lots of things (both &quot;now&quot; and in future - making plans and realizing what she could)<br />a need to touch nature, work with it, play in it<br />a lot of love for her partner (= that&#039;s me!&nbsp; ;D ), but also for herself<br /><br />She really enjoyed this first experience with very small &quot;visuals&quot; (as written before: more like a very faint change in the perception of her visual information)<br />She didn&#039;t felt trippy or awkward at all!<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll update you on her second experience soon... <br /><br /><br />

It was, began as an accident that I worked to correct., but I eventually realized it was what it was, ya know?&nbsp; I mean, when you drop a dab of some co2 wax into molly (fine, amber, big xtal ::::))))), there will probably be rocks on your dab... So with a few little pieces left to be seen, I decided to just go ahead and dab it anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure enough, there I was, noticing that my jaw was freely flowing with detailed description about whatever the topic was at hand, and I recall bringing almost every point with calculated empathy.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyone else micro dabbed molly yet? can&#039;t say i&#039;ll return, can&#039;t say i&#039;ll abstain... <br />

Dont get me wrong, I just want to point out that people like me once learned one side of reality on the street: substances like lsd, xtc or weed which lose their therapeutical and sould-healing effects because 90% of people I know use them to get stoned and high. They dont take them seriously, they just consume them like everything else in the world is consumed. And because of that &quot;the magic&quot; of the substance gets lost and it becomes just a plain drug, a substance to get high and to forget everything. <br />And here we are on SR and there guys like u or RaFaeL who microdose because they see a positive effect on the whole personality. It is also what u describe in your last post in this thread! And this is what I call another part of reality with people who do love to trip balls (I love a lot&nbsp; 8) 8)) but who on the other side do also research the holy molecule of Doctor Albert Hofmann&nbsp; :) !<br /><br />Really big respect for u, guys, for sharing all your different experiences<br /><br />@flyinghigh1660 - I saw u took once 50ug and had to give your business training.

				@R5: its really hard to say how much my microdose was, but by my estimations and calculations, I&#039;m going to say somewhere around 10~15 mics. The only way to have a better idea would be to ingest a known microdose and compare results. Also, yes, I also think it&#039;d be good to experiment microdosing without the ganj. I hope I can exercise enough self control to make that happen. I&#039;m quite the chronic smoker... (hehehe... chronic ;) )<br /><br />@blackya: I think its totally possible to do work on a microdose. In fact, it might even help ;D The only thing that I can foresee being a problem in a work environment is, if you are sensitive to psychedelics (like I am), it might tweak your vision and make it very distracting to do your work.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point. One unintended side-effect of my LSD microdosing experiment over the long holiday weekend is that today (day after), I&#039;m having residual visual disturbances. This usually happens to me the day after an LSD trip, so I&#039;m not alarmed by it. However, its not my favorite. I already have LSD augmented vision&nbsp; (permanent), from all the massive quantities of acid I took when I was younger. So today, basically, its worse. I found it slightly irritating when I was at work today. Not too bad, though.<br /><br />We talked about the risk of &quot;flashbacks&quot; earlier in this thread, and this falls into that category for me, althought I wouldn&#039;t classify it as a full blown &quot;flashback&quot;. I get those too, and they&#039;re different. But clearly there&#039;s a risk for people with a history of heavy psychedelic use.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post an update tomorrow if the visual symptoms resolve or not. I&#039;m expecting them to, and I&#039;m not really concerned about it at this point. However if they don&#039;t resolve as expected, this would become a concern. One thing I&#039;m not looking to accomplish with this experiment is to make my permanent acid vision any worse.<br /><br />One thing that could be contributing to my residual visual disturbances is that I didn&#039;t space out the microdoses enough. It might help if I wait a few more days in between. Right now, I&#039;m thinking I&#039;ll try it again on Wednesday (3 days from the last one), but if the visual symptoms don&#039;t resolve, I might rethink that plan. <br /><br />Peace

The idea of micro-dosing is not to be a &quot;low quantity daily junkie&quot;, but to actually remain &quot;sober&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; while taking the product to enhance specific qualities. <br />For now it seems that the interesting quantity is about 1/10 of the threshold dosage, sometimes a bit less, sometimes a bit more... but I&#039;d say for MDMA a dosage of about 3 to 4mg will be enough, maybe you&#039;ll need less - maybe more; but better to start with less and build up if necessary. <br /><br />What should you measure? Well, basically it&#039;s about every change in your perception, functionality, emotional and psychological balance, thoughts patterns... everything that changes (even just slightly) from your normal behavior/routine/consciousness. <br />Off course, you need to know yourself quite well and be very attentive to the details of your being to be able to notes the smallest change in your reality (I highly recommend meditation to achieve this). <br /><br />If you have more questions, pop them here or in a PM...

				...this will be my last post for now...<br /><br />I started a new topic about the practice of meditation and the use of psychedelic substances. <br />It seemed to me that there were enough reasons to start a specific forum page about this. <br />(one of the reasons was to not &quot;overload&quot; this thread with meditation-related discussions - but also to have a specific thread where experiences regarding meditation could be exchanged, whether micro-dosing or macro-dosing). <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll see you guys there (also)? <br />Here&#039;s the link: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181927.msg1320890#msg1320890<br /><br />Have a good day everyone!

				RaFaeL5 invited me here to talk about microdosing 2C-E and 2C-P.<br /><br />I sometimes use them as physical and mental stimulants when I haven&#039;t gotten enough sleep and I have a tough day ahead of me.<br />Most of my 2C microdosing experience is with 2C-P because I have only recently gotten 2C-E for the first time (free 200mg(!) sample from the vendor love; great vendor, go check out his SR page :D) and I prefer 2C-P because of its long duration (no need to redose during the day).<br /><br />2mg of 2C-P (3~5mg 2C-E, need to do more research) work great for me (body weight ~88kg) and the effects kinda remind me of how NZT-48 is portrayed in the movie Limitless. It makes physical labor and some mental tasks easier. It is especially helpful with analytical thinking but not so much with repetitive tasks. (Meth/Dex)amphetamine and MPH are better for that. At a slightly increased dose it is also a very effective creativity enhancer, but one would risk noticeable pupil dilation and slight visuals, which can be counterproductive. 2C-E is the better creativity enhancer anyway :)<br /><br />Feel free to ask any question :)

				@ Ballzinator : thank you for taking the invitation and coming over here! <br />Have you ever tried 2C-D (if I&#039;m not mistaking there was a question about this compound earlier today or yesterday)...<br /><br /><br />@ALL: my second micro-dosing experience was very nice, and probably better than the first one: &quot;less is more&quot;! Today&#039;s dose (5.5ug) didn&#039;t make me feel too much lightheaded (only a very little bit about 2h in the experience) but it brought me lots of focus. Especially my communication skills improve A LOT when micro-dosing. Again, I was able to do a lot today; but in the end of the day (about 8 - 10h after taking the drop) I started to get tired and forget things (but, damn, I had lots of things on my mind today!). Maybe 5ug can be taken twice a day (one in the morning and one before lunch)? I&#039;ll have to check that... <br />I had a small period of time where I was extremely sensible to light (not painful but a bit distracting), once I realized it was taking away my attention from other stuff I focused on it for a moment and it went away - after that I had no more problems with the brightness of light and didn&#039;t need my sunglasses any more. <br /><br />I was also thinking to try taking the micro-dose just before going to bed at night... maybe you&#039;d have a great sleep and then wake up totally fresh and focused, ready for the day... I&#039;ll try that some time soon... <br /><br />I&#039;m not gone write much more, sorry - I&#039;m tired &amp; just tried another product that needed sampling...

It helps you to do things better on a daily basis. <br /><br />But dosing this way for few months is a terribly bad idea. Micro-dosing puts your body into hyper drive and the long term effect is unknown. But I can tell you that it&#039;s not going to be good as acid in your body shifts the paradigm of your body&#039;s normal functioning. Our physical body is not designed for such hyper-drive mode.<br /><br />I have tested micro-dosing for a week and I am speaking from my experience and knowledge.&nbsp; If you are doing this for experiments then it&#039;s all fine. But I would not advise anyone to do it more than one or two weeks. <br /><br />Tripping once in 2 weeks is much better as your body can go back to the normal state of functioning just after the trip ends and it has so much time (2 weeks) to fix if there is any issue. Adjusting to the new paradigm through new understanding is the way to go and not adjust through the hyper-drive mode. Change needs to flow outward from inside and not from outside to inside. The latter is a forced approach and your physical body will reject it in due course of time. That&#039;s one of the reasons why medicines create whole gang of side effects than helping. Good intentions are the way to go to make a lasting change.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents!<br /><br /><br />GSE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Its certainly fair to consider long term effects not discluding cellular adaptation and resistance - it seems that we could use lots more input from pharmacologists here.<br /><br /><br /><br />this has reminded me of previous posts where I mentioned the use of flower essences as a kind of &quot;inverted dose&quot; wherein there are no &quot;physical&quot; properties, but rather they are subtle/energetic/homeopathic type effects. I would be interested in exploring this more alongside microdosing, and thought it relevant to mention that flower essences are usually taken for about 7 to 10 days in a row, as frequently as felt throughout the day. Perhaps with physical doses (micro) this is too frequent, hence RaFael&#039;s recommendations of every 3 days or so. I am sure that a flower essence of the chemical could be taken continuously for 10 days and may have substantially different effects.<br /><br />On another note, it is less micro-dosing as small-dosing, but I ingested 5mg TMA2 this evening to observe its qualities. I am sensitive, and I am having a strongish stimulatory effect. Threshold is about 10mg and dose is about 30mg according to mahakala at least. I wish I&#039;d taken a more microdose so that I could have been introduced to the chemical without the &quot;side effects&quot; (which i understand is the reason why most people take the drug to begin with).<br />Just thought i&#039;d throw that in there

				I&#039;m happy to report that the residual visual symptoms I described yesterday as as result of my microdising experiment over the weekend have resolved. My vision is back to normal. ....Or maybe baseline is a better word. :P<br /><br />Regarding GSE&#039;s comments, I think there is some merit there. As someone who overdid psychedelics at one time, I can offer some personal insight on this debate. I used to take LSD several times a week, sometimes several days in a row.&nbsp; I continued this for about a year and a half. During that time, the longest (and only) break I took was no more than a few weeks. So I can speak from personal experience that putting your body in hyperdrive like that does indeed have consequences. <br /><br />The most significant casualty I suffered as a result of my LSD overindulgence is the permanent changes to my vision. However, it didn&#039;t just happen out of nowhere. I purposefully ignored many warning signs my body was sending me. I could have prevented these permanent changes, and I chose not to. So I would say the moral of the story is, pay attention to the warning signs. Don&#039;t ignore them. Your body will tell you what it can and cannot handle. <br /><br />For example, with the residual visual symptoms I described above, my body was giving me warning signs that I was microdosing too frequenty. So I am taking note this time. I will space out the microdoses a little more and see how I feel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone is different, so just because this has been my experience doesn&#039;t mean anyone else will have a similar experience. The important thing is to be mindful of any warning signs.<br /><br />On that note, I will proceed with my experiments and try again tomorrow. I will try my hardest to leave the weed alone (lets see how that goes...&nbsp; ::) ) and I will report my findings back :)<br /><br />One final comment, @R5, I really like your idea of microdosing once in the morning and again later in the day. Do keep us posted on that&nbsp; ;D I will have to wait to try that one until I can get a more precise dose, but it sounds like it could be really proactive<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Peace and love

				Well everyone, I&#039;m back for a little while. <br />Took me a while to read all the posts since I&#039;d been gone! Any news on those microdosed blotters/vials RaF?<br /><br />Also very interested in Ballzinator&#039;s 2c-p microdosing experiences. 2c-p was one of the more &quot;interesting&quot; 2c-x chemicals I tried, and I agree that 2c-e was the most creative. Too bad that it would require two doses in one day though. I wonder if 2c-p would be good for creativity as well? Like if you were already creative?<br /><br />My favorite thread at the moment :)

				Very interesting Rastaman, I completely understand what you&#039;re saying. Years ago I used to micro-dose/take amphetamines most days for about 6 months, I also had vision problems (seeing sun spots, not being able to look at something like a wall which is one color as one color and distortion).&nbsp;

				Hey everyone. I microdosed again today and it was very successful! I even managed to not smoke any weed until +9hrs into it. *pat myself on the back* ;D<br /><br />I experienced many positive benefits. Among them:<br />-increased concentration<br />-deepened focus<br />-heightened sense of awareness<br />-heightened sense of taste<br />-greater ability to stick to the task despite difficulty/boredom<br />-increased spitiual connection (feeling of one-ness)<br /><br />I still think my dose is too high. I would really love to get my hands on some of that 5mic dose. Hey vendors! Hit me up! I will buy this from you!! (looking for quality clean LSD) <br /><br />The first 3 hours into it are when I feel most &quot;inebriated&quot;.

I&#039;m not microdosing to get fucked up, I&#039;m doing it to deepen my focus.

(I&#039;ll be taking LSD to get fucked up too, and then I&#039;ll take a real dose ;D )<br /><br />But other than that, today was a big success!<br /><br />Peace<br />;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Congrats with staying of the Ganga... <br /><br />I&#039;m really glad it went that well! <br /><br />Yes, vendors - do wake up!!

				My ~10mcg dose went very well. It gave me lot of energy for sure. A little too much at points. Once I got done what I needed to get done I had a lot of anxious energy, but exercising fixed that no problem. I will definitely repeat again. I feel like you have the right idea going slightly lower. Maybe 7.5mcg would be good.

				QUOTE FROM R5 (in an attempt to answer a PM): <br />&quot;Hi, <br /><br />if there&#039;s 1 reason why I&#039;m on the forum, it&#039;s because I believe in the system of SR: the free flow of products combined with the free flow of information. I will not always be able to give you the best and most complete information, but I will always try to give you as much as I can while being true to myself... <br /><br />Regarding your question about taking your first micro-dose 9h before your exam: <br />LSD is (for the most part) all about psychology and the knowing of yourself. If you &quot;program&quot; yourself in such a way that it will be constructive for you and you know you can achieve this goal, then by all means: do take it. <br />But, do realize that it takes a lot of practice before achieving this &quot;state of being&quot; where you can really program yourself and the influence that such a strong (if not the strongest) psychedelic will have on you, even taken at sub-perceptual doses... <br /><br />I think there&#039;s a lot you can achieve with psychedelics, both on micro-doses and on macro-doses; BUT: you need practice, you need experience, you need to know the product, you need to know yourself, you need to understand the product, you need to understand yourself... <br /><br />I would not recommend taking one of your first micro-doses on such an important day; what doesn&#039;t mean that it would go wrong if you did, it just means that my personal feeling tells me it could be hard to achieve what you want to achieve in these circumstances. <br /><br />Also, you&#039;re thinking to take you micro-dose about 9h before your exam and there is immediately 1 warning I need to give you regarding this time-table... When you micro-dose, you&#039;ll have some extra energy, focus, empathy, ... for a few hours; that is correct - but after a period of &quot;more&quot; comes a period of &quot;less&quot;... a possibility would be that, about 8h after your micro-dose you&#039;ll start to feel tired (LSD last for about 8h). If you enter your exam-room while feeling tired it&#039;ll be much more complicated to stay focused and fill in your exam then it would be if you were sober... Again, all could go very well and you might still be &quot;on the edge&quot; thanks to the micro-dose, but you might also be tired from the micro-dose and fall in a period of &quot;less&quot;... <br /><br />Most of the people who&#039;ve tried to micro-dose LSD have felt some &quot;light-headiness&quot; for a while - that is certainly something you want to avoid when taking an exam. 15microgams seems to much (personal opinion). I&#039;d advise a lower dose. But, as you stated, taking less is probably very difficult (when you work with blotters)...but, you might consider this technique: don&#039;t chew on the blotter, don&#039;t swallow it, just put it for a second (or just a tiny more) on you tongue and then take it out. That way you should have some acid, but not the full portion of it...<br /><br />If you really want to take the micro-dose (don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not recommending it - but IF you ABSOLUTELY want to use it I&#039;d rather give you the best advise I can imagine at this moment), then take it about 3h before you exam by putting a part of the blotter for a few seconds (NOT many, just a FEW) on your tongue - then take the blotter out and then...MEDITATE! <br />You should visualize every step in the next few hours of your day and how the acid will influence it. Get to &quot;know&quot; your day, your moves, your thoughts - and program the effect of the acid in it. <br />I think that, if you wish to do it, this is the way to do it. <br /><br />Even if you take your 15microgram portion, I would not take it 9h in advance. That&#039;s too much in advance (personal opinion again). Me and my GF have had the &quot;peak&quot; of your consciousness at about 5 to 6 h after taking the micro-dose and the first 3h we had some light-headiness... and you don&#039;t want this light-headiness while sitting in the exam room...<br /><br />Me myself I&#039;ve been thinking about micro-dosing LSD for years before actually doing it... I did take micro-portions of other products (such as mushrooms, amphetamine, MDMA) but never had the opportunity to get such low-dosage LSD as I have right now. Micro-dosing is about knowing your dose, finding your way with it and learning to work with it... It&#039;s not like &quot;jumping in a pool&quot; (and hoping to survive the dive from 10m) - it&#039;s about walking in the meadows (and learning to know the best path)...<br /><br />Don&#039;t &quot;force&quot; your micro-dosing experience... all good things come to those who can wait. You should be patient in life and open for opportunities, that&#039;s how karma and dharma work. If you get stubborn and absolutely want to force your way into a certain experience it might not be the right time for you to do it and then the result could be negative. <br /><br />Regarding your remark on &quot;set &amp; setting wouldn&#039;t be good&quot;... I&#039;ve been thinking about this myself and, even if I totally think set &amp; setting are the primary factors to take in account when using macro-doses of psychedelics, I don&#039;t think you should keep this in mind when micro-dosing. <br />Micro-dosing is like taking a medicine, no - it&#039;s not &quot;like&quot;, it just IS taking medicine! You&#039;re not gone wake up in the morning and think: &quot;oh, today I shouldn&#039;t take my vitamin C because I have an exam&quot;. No, you&#039;re not gone think like this, you might think &quot;oh, I really should take my vitamins because I&#039;m gone have this exam today.&quot; Set &amp; setting don&#039;t &quot;count&quot; when you take medicine... <br /><br />I realize my answer is a bit complex, but the whole concept of micro-dosing IS complex. It&#039;s experimental, it&#039;s &quot;new&quot;, it&#039;s complicated, it&#039;s personal. All I can do is give you my perception of the process - but I can&#039;t give you an answer nor can I give you certainty. I hope you will excuse me for this... <br /><br />By the way, if you post your question on the forum page you might get answers from more people, some of them might be more experienced than me, or have a different ideology than I do, or just be an ass... but I think you&#039;re smart enough to see threw it and be able to gather the information you need for yourself. I would NOT mind you posting such questions on the forum page that I started (by the way, it&#039;s not because I started the topic that I have any power/influence on how it evolves - I wouldn&#039;t want it, information and energy should flow freely!). Use the forum to gather as much info as you can, then make your own choice based on your feeling after gathering the info...never mind asking a question. My teachers often told me: &quot;there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers&quot;.<br /><br />I realize that I wrote a lot to you in an attempt to answer your question. I hope you don&#039;t mind that I will copy-paste this in the forum. I will NOT mention your name (but you can go to the forum and say that it was your message I was replying to). I just hope that, by putting my answer on the forum, we might get some more insights on the questions you asked me... just to make your decision a bit more complicated... &quot;

				@GSE: may I ask you a question... I realize we shouldn&#039;t be in &quot;overdrive&quot; all the time - it would very soon be contra-productive... That&#039;s why I recommend to take 1 micro-dose every 3 days. That way you have: day 1 - microdose, day 2 - aftereffect, day 3 - sober... <br />Do you think this &quot;regime&quot; is too much, or could it be all right? <br />&nbsp;<br />I, personally, think that it could be all right, but I need more (personal) experience with it before being able to recommend it to others...<br /><br />Is once in every 3 days too much, or is it kind of all right? <br /><br />PS: I hope DMtriptamine will join this discussion soon... !

				Another microdosing update:<br /><br />Microdosed yesterday and I&#039;ve had no residual visual disturbances today. Really happy about that. So I&#039;m thinking waiting 3 days between microdoses seems to agree with my system. <br /><br />Also, I did a lot of the same shit today that I did with the microdose yesterday and I noticed a huge difference. The microdose gave me superpowers! I was nowhere near there in terms of focus/precision/ability to do difficult shit today, in my &quot;sober&quot; state. (sober=no LSD. I smoke a lot of weed...)<br /><br />While I find this awesome, I&#039;m also foreseeing some potential pitfalls here. Having superpowers could get addictive. Especially for me, as I&#039;ve been there before with LSD. So I will have to be extra careful here. <br /><br />Right now I&#039;m thinking I should take a little break from microdosing.&nbsp; I will resume again, maybe in a week? I&#039;ll play it by ear and keep you posted :) <br /><br />But when I do resume, I will have to do it without smoking weed. The results are so much better. Smoking while microdosing gets me really loaded, but I have to remember that the whole point isn&#039;t to get loaded, but to have superpowers. ;D <br /><br />Ok that&#039;s all for now,<br />Peace and love!

				So, today we had another go with micro-dosing (even if we&#039;re thinking a lot about GSE&#039;s comment and we will probably adapt our schedule a bit in future due to his input)... <br /><br />We (my GF and I) took our first 5microgram drop in the morning (around 10AM) and then immediately started meditating (we didn&#039;t eat anything before nor did we drink coffee). <br />For me it&#039;s getting very obvious that those very mild doses of LSD work as a great katalysator on my meditation. I go very deep, very quickly with a huge lot of inner peace. <br />It&#039;s like if the effect of the drop is quasi-immediate. <br />After 30 minutes of meditation we did some stuff in the house and then I went outside to do some groceries. Again, I noticed that I was a bit more sensitive to the intensity of light - so I had to wear sunglasses and focus on this point for a minute to have it smoother. <br />Then we had breakfast and did some other stuff. <br />My GF says she felt the influence of this drop better than the previous one (but that time she drank coffee immediately after taking the drop). <br />For me the effect was quite similar as the previous time (same quantity and similar setting). <br /><br />After lunch we waited about 3hours and then we both took a second drop of 5 microgram LSD. <br />I was quite tired from a short night so I decided to take a nap about 15 minutes after taking this second drop. I have to say that I felt asleep very quickly (before going to sleep I was in a very smooth meditative state of being) and even if I only had a very short nap I woke up quite refreshed and rested. <br /><br />I can&#039;t say that I felt much from this second drop, but my GF found the effect of her second drop very pleasant - incredible how everyone has a specific reaction to this product... I&#039;m still amazed at the diversity of reactions that it can bring in people, even at similar doses in similar situations and so on and so on... <br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s almost midnight now. <br />As always, what I noted the most was how the micro-dose enabled me to speak more clearly, to formulate my ideas more clearly, use a bigger vocabulary... <br />and - in regard to the previous comment of GSE: I already have a similar diet to what you suggested, but still I find the effect of micro-dosing lsd quite clear. <br />I used to be very fluent and good at phrasing my thoughts - but I might have &quot;overdone&quot; some products in the past, or maybe I just got lazy; anyway I found now that I can not speak as clearly and as structured as I used to do. For me it&#039;s a real pleasure to see that, when I micro-dosed, I have this capacity again... <br /><br />I keep on thinking about applications for micro-dosing... <br />I might try to use it as a &quot;preparatory ritual&quot; before our next macro-dosis (maybe not with lsd, but with mescaline). I could take 10mg of mescaline 3 days in a row (in the morning, while being sober) immediately followed by a period of meditation and preparation for the macro-dosage. That could maybe influence the trip, but also lessen the GI problems and nausea... <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />How have things been going for you guys? <br />Any new idea&#039;s, comments, suggestions, ... ?

				I have been messing around with microdosing 25c-nbome (only once a week) and I find that in 100-150mcg doses there is little to no sensory distortion or high, just an all around great mood. I think this compound could have a lot of value in ultra low doses as a nootropic and mild stimulant/pick me up. <br />Perhaps low dose psychedelics are the ultimate nootropics.

				Alrighty this was quite a day and has shown me how much LSD microdoses can add to your day. This is a longer one . about 10-12 ug of TheCaliConnect&#039;s LSD tab cut into 1/8&#039;s.<br /><br />Took it at 2 PM <br /><br />Started feeling it about an hour afterward , and drove to my friends house . We talked beforehand and I realized how great it was to have a few close friends that are real people. Most people in the area are fairly inauthentic . Anyway, as we start driving to the river, we were going cliffjumping, the music started sounded awesome and I began to feel incredible.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;The girls were driving in a car behind me and I was dancing in the car unconsciously to impress them, then I stopped . It was much easier to see things that you do to impress others or try to please them , and your able to stop those behaviors much easier. When I stopped, I finally felt liberated that I wasn&#039;t doing anything to impress anyone , I was simply doing me . No reason to care or try to influence another&#039;s perception of my behavior. It&#039;s their perception, not mine .<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; As we get to the river , my two guy friends tried a different path and I stayed talking with the girls. we met up with two women who I started talking about kayaking with, and it felt very smooth and authentic , with no fear involved . When we all touch the water , they jump out and I am just standing there. I was like &quot; guys it&#039;s not that bad &quot; and I begin swimming upstream like nothing . The water was about as cold as it has been all year, yet I didn&#039;t react much. Everyone was looking at me in shock and I felt great, though the cold water did feel a bit noticeable .<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I swim across the river alone to jump the cliffs the first time , then the second time I go two people decided to try it . Both friends nearly pass out on the swim over and the girl almost drowned . We got them out , they took a boat back to the sand , and I went up to the top of the mountain and just sat and meditated in awe of the beauty&nbsp; of nature . I came down , did another jump off the cliff into the ice cold water for a group of spectators cheering and swam back to shore . My friend threw up as I was doing push-ups to warm up my blood . When we left I had to go to talk therapy ( parents forced after I was caught with a brownie....) and the conversation was smooth and free. I definitely took his lessons and advice with more understanding and a willingness to put them to use. <br /><br /><br />Getting home , I called a few friends and had lengthy conversations with friends I haven&#039;t talked to in a while , I just decided it would be nice to have a talk . I had some of the most enjoyable conversations each lasting about 30 minutes ( way too long but totally worth it : ) with 4 friends I haven&#039;t talked to in weeks. That was probably the best part of the day, finally going back to memories and events and being able to laugh at what my friends and I had experienced in the past. This has been probably one of the most enjoyable days I have had in a LONG time and I was aware and present each minute of it . It is 10:40 PM and I am ready to meditate and go to sleep.

But you don&#039;t want to screw your body&#039;s balance for 10 days at a time. I would think full-blown tripping once a week or once in 2 weeks would be a better approach than micro-dosing the way you are suggesting.<br /><br />Micro-dosing is for experimentation and not for regular consumption.

				An update, I no longer recommend 25c-nbome for microdosing often due to the fact that even at ultra low doses, tolerance still develops quite rapidly... Soon you will find your microdoses to get into recreational dosages while still getting microdose effects. Nbomes being full 5ht2a agonists develop tolerance much more rapidly than other psychedelics.

				@Zipstyle: making such a chart might be a possibility, but sadly I didn&#039;t think about this when I started this topic (I should have reserved the 2nd and maybe even the 3rd post for such information - something that I&#039;m now doing when I start other threads)... If such a chart is built in the discussion here (on page x) it would be hard for everyone to find it when needed...<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t want to put any &quot;peer-pressure&quot; on those who are participating in the experiment and listing them in such a chart might put a kind pressure on people... <br /><br />Maybe such a chart could be created as on OP on a specific topic/thread and then I could put a link to it in the OP here? <br />For the coming period I&#039;ll probably have a little bit less time to spend on this forum, so it might be a better idea if someone could make this chart (and keep it updated) - I would off course put the link in the OP and have a look at it as often as I can... <br />If noone wants to do it I&#039;ll put some time in it as soon as I can, but I can&#039;t guarantee that it&#039;ll be kept up-to-date... my excuses, but better of me to say this now than start doing it and then not being able to keep it running as it should. <br /><br />Thank you for the suggestion, <br />hopefully it&#039;ll work out somehow!&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve got the liquid from the second seller... <br />I reagent tested it immediately to see that the reaction was amazingly good!<br />Almost to good to be true - so now I sent him a message to ask him if he&#039;s sure those are 5ug drops and not 100ug drops..?<br /><br />I&#039;ll be waiting for his reply and then we&#039;ll try his drops next week or so when micro-dosing, <br />but I can already tell you that this seller, Mahakala, is willing to make more of those 5ug/drop vials and send them to whoever is interested. Saddly he ran out of his xTal and is now waiting for a new arrival in the coming weeks... The new powder will be a different one than the one he used to make the vial he sent us but he sais the quality will be similar. <br />His stealth was very good and I like the way he communicates (quick and to-the-point). <br /><br />I&#039;d maybe just advice you guys to wait a little until I&#039;ve gotten my answer and tried the product myself before you all start ordering micro-dosing vials from him, but if you can&#039;t hold your horses...&nbsp; ;)

				Hi guys,<br /><br />first of all I want to say how thankful I am to RaFaeL5 and Rastaman Vibration! These 2 guys really spent their precious time to answer all my annoying&nbsp; ;D question about micro-dosing. Respect!<br /><br />I microdosed yesterday. <br />First of all I have to say that I dont have a lot of experience with LSD. I tried it a few times (different doses between 120 - 150- 180ug). It was amazing every time I took it&nbsp; :D :o ;D<br /><br />Anyway here is my report:<br /><br />6AM - woke up. damn, I feel tired but I want to microdose today&nbsp; :) so I took around 14ug<br />+ 1h - starting to feel euphoria and feeling lightheaded. Yeah, definitely feeling high. A lot of energy and I want to dance. But fuck, it was not my plan to feel high&nbsp; &nbsp;::)! Well, fuck it, I am high&nbsp; 8)<br />+ 2h - I really feel this energy is a bit too strong inside of my body. I try to lay down, but I cant lay peacefully, my legs kinda shaking. I dont feel relaxed and calm. Did not expect my LSD onset to be so energetic from such a small dosage.<br />+ 2,5h - I know the main point is about microdosing but in a certain way how I feel right now doesnt give me a lot of pleasure. It is still energy inside of me, I feel a bit anxious, its difficult to describe my mood. My next thought : &quot;I should have taken the entire blotter!&quot; Honestly, it feels like this at the moment. In a way it doesnt feel complete&nbsp; :-\<br />3,5h-4h - But all in all there are moments where I feel great, better concentrated, less worried about the little things of life and kinda clearheaded. But I had those moments just 2 times for a very short period of time.<br />But most of the time it feels like this: there is something inside of my body which makes me slightly sweat, I feel my body temperature definitely increased. Ah, stomach hurts a bit (which is normal for LSD). Damn, I went to toilet like 4 times since I took the microblotter. Dont know if it is normal. I mean I have days when I need to do it often than usually. I was thinking is it maybe because I first took the LSD dose and some hours later I had breakfast? Did I destroy my normal everyday routine when I usually get up and have immediately my coffee and something to eat????? Dont know........ Ah, I also need to urinate more often but thats normal I guess...........<br />+6h - I ate lunch with a lot of heavy food. I thought it could make me feel tired and I would fall asleep. The main point - I expected my microdosing&nbsp; in a different way. But all I can feel is more about the body effects which are kinda a bit unpleasant. is it because of the tiny dose? Could be... I dont know. It is just when I think about those times I took quite a decent dose (as for me)&nbsp; of LSD, there were certainly some effects on physical level like increased temperature, sweating, dry mouth and so on, but when u trip high, u hardly notice them because once again: U TRIP and they dont disturb u. <br />So, I just wonder was my blotter maybe not clean enough or am I too sensitive for tiny dosages and those physical in a way unpleasant effects hide all the good features of microdosing? <br />+8h - I feel so tired, going to bed. Slept for one hour but it felt like I would have slept 8-10 hours. I think I felt it in my sleep that I was high&nbsp; :D<br />+12h - went outside. I feel really calm when I walk around the street. It has definitely some positive effect.<br />+15h - I dont feel anything, just being tired. Still inside of my body I can feel on a certain level that I took something today. It has been the whole day this feeling inside of me: its like when u take a certain medicine and it doesnt make u feel different but u can still feel that your body has to fight against it. So like this I felt most of the day. Once again I dont know if I am too sensitive and need just normal LSD dosage to trip properly&nbsp; :D :D :D :D or was my blotter not the cleanest one&nbsp; :o<br /><br />so guys, really, my first microdosage did not bring me any deeper thoughts, sharpened concentration or other positive mental effects.<br />As I have already said above, it felt mostly on the physical level. <br />So next time I have 3 options:<br />&nbsp;- no microdosing at all <br />&nbsp;- smaller dosage like 5-7ug<br />&nbsp;- tripping normal like 200ug&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Seems clear from your description that you are mini-dosing and not micro-dosing.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sounds like they are stronger than 14 , maybe 20 or as high as 25 ug, so u may need to divide that into 3-4-5 pieces and try again. Less is more :)

				The problem with microdosing NBOMEs is that they are full agonists at 5ht2a receptor (although wiki says partial for 25c, its practically a full agonist, look at the binding profiles.)<br /><br />Tolerance builds more rapidly and lasts longer than with all other psychedelics. When used at recreational doses tolerance lasts 2 weeks give or take and it never seems to go all the way back down, for me at least.

				@Blackya: thanks for your message. I think bongo is right: &quot;you took too much, too much&quot;. <br />So, if you want to, you could try let&#039;s say 1/3 of the dose you took this time. That might be better, but you might just as well decide that micro-dosing is not your thing and stick to the full-dose now and a while. <br /><br />@DMtriptamine: thx for the details. Personally I&#039;m not into the 25-serie, so micro-dosing those products never crossed my mind - but now that we&#039;ve gotten this info it&#039;s excluded of the list of interesting products for the micro-dosers... <br /><br />@all: if you contact Mahakala about custom made micro-dosage vials, be SURE to be VERY explicit about the dosage of the drops... In the vial he sent me there were supposed to be drops of 5ug, but after testing it seems the drops are much stronger than that - somewhere between 5 and 20 microgram per drop (or even more)... The problem is that, since we have no accurate idea of the concentration of these drops it is&nbsp; impossible to dilute them the the desired strength with enough precision... <br />Off course, I can dilute the drops more, but I&#039;ll never know for sure how strong they are... and that a real pitty - so if you order, be sure to be VERY specific about the need of a precise dosage!

In any case I have tried his white dalai lama crystal and believe it to be high quality. Once he&#039;s back on holiday I&#039;ll ask him for a vial and be specific about the 5ug.<br />What medium is the LSD in, in the liquid? Will it be preserved for quite a while? I&#039;d like to be using this over the winter also.<br /><br />disappointed to find no current evidence of different mechanisms of action of low doses compared to high doses on neuro-receptors. However, I hope to read some of David Nichols work and have many references to try to come to grips with the cascade pathways and genetics involved with psychedelics. My theory is that low and high doses may differ in the exposure levels of DNA for binding-site availability. Perhaps this could show that high doses cause rapid activation of RNA processes which also &quot;close down&quot; very quickly. I am a believer that &quot;subtle&quot; or &quot;gentle&quot; can cause more productive long-term effects - ponder ponder ponder oh to be a busy bee<br />However the modern molecular biology appears to have no glimpse of evidence for this yet, but there is an understanding of genetic activation for translation of structural proteins etc <br /><br />Psychiatry&#039;s mechanism at the moment of working with psychedelics is approaching low med and high doses in a therapeutic setting, but i have not found anything from the &quot;big&quot; studies in microdosing (John Hopkins w psilocybin etc). FYI, med MDMA doses are showing to be more effective for PTSD than high doses (that&#039;s 75mg vs 125mg) - people are probably aware of the MAPS studies. It bewilders me why psychiatry hasn&#039;t approached microdosing yet, but I suppose it all has its own path of unfolding.<br /><br />So peace and love to all you kind folk, great to continue reading about what everyone is finding so far<br />

				Microdosed again today. My dosage is still too high and I&#039;m getting a lightheaded feeling for the 1st 3 hours or so. But after that fades, I straight up have superpowers. More on that below. <br /><br />I contacted Mahakala about a custom microdosing vial (specified 5mic per drop dosage) but have yet to get a reply. That was almost a week ago&nbsp; :-\ I just saw @cricketplank had said he&#039;s on vacation, so that makes me feel a bit more encouraged.<br /><br />The lightheaded feeling I get from the larger-than-I-would-like dose makes me a bit sleepy, which is weird IMO. I would think I should feel more energized, considering my past experinces with LSD. Also during this &#039;buzzed&#039; phase of the experiment, a part of me wants to take more acid. As in, I like the buzz and I want more. That&#039;s really not a desirable feeling. Again, I&#039;m not microdosing to get loaded. I can take a big boy dose for that. ;) I&#039;m specifically microdosing for the superpowers it gives me after the &quot;buzz&quot; wears off. So I&#039;m hoping that once I get the proper dosage happening, all these issues will be corrected.<br /><br />Its really important for me to not smoke any weed to get the full superpower benefits of the microdose. That&#039;s actually a lot harder than it sounds&nbsp; :P Somehow I end up craving weed a lot more than usual. I&#039;ve yet to figure out what that&#039;s all about.

				I love this thread.<br /><br />I used to do a lot of LSD back in the day, and it really gave me a lot of beautiful experiences - which reminds me: This one time, 20 years ago, my dad was a bit drunk and we somehow started to talk about drugs. He told me that &quot;Son, some of the most wonderful things I have experienced in my life have been while on acid. But, don&#039;t do drugs boy!&quot; :D<br /><br />But anyways, as the poster above, I have fallen victim to a mild depression and I have a hard time finishing things that I start, or actually even starting them. &quot;The fog of depression&quot; is a pretty good way of putting it. Antidepressants don&#039;t really work for me, but just like Vanquish I would like to get some magic and happiness back into my life.<br /><br />So I think I might give Lucy a chance to fix things a little with micro-doses. Also, I want them superpowers ;)<br /><br />So thanks for this thread, this is very very interesting. I&#039;d +1 everyone if I could!

				@Vanquish<br />@Love Inc<br /><br />My personal experience regarding LSD and depression is that 1 single &quot;heroic&quot; dose can do a lot to help you out of there...but you need to be careful about it and prepare it WELL to make sure that you want just loose it during the trip or have a very dark experience... I tripped myself out of a depression (why didn&#039;t I find the solution earlier I asked myself after many years of deep, black, lonely depression), but was very lucky! <br /><br />If you want more advise on this just PM me (because it&#039;s not really a part of this forum topic) or shoot your questions on the Avengers forum page. <br /><br />I have no idea how micro-dosing will affect the depression and it would off course be interesting to learn from your experiences (do keep us posted!), but I&#039;m not entirely sure that micro-dosing LSD is what will help you the most/best in this specific case. <br /><br />Better products to micro-dose when in a depression might be ketamine or GHB, maybe even MDMA. The idea is not to get superpowers (at least I don&#039;t think this is the primary idea) but to cure the depresssion...<br />even though I understand that you&#039;d want the superpowers...but the risk (I&#039;m thinking out loud now) is that LSD often works as an amplifier of feelings (that&#039;s why set and setting are so important when tripping). Maybe on micro-doses this amplifying could happen on a sub-perceptual level and if that&#039;s the case this could be a slumbering risk and it might take quite a while before you actually realize what&#039;s happened. The idea is NOT to amplify the depression, but to diminish it... <br /><br />I&#039;d love one of you guys (or even both of you) to try it out so that we could learn from it, <br />but I NEED to warn you about possible risks before supporting you in this. <br />I might be wrong, I might be right - the only way to know this for sure is for some people to try it out... but don&#039;t try it out not understanding the possible negative effect! <br /><br />I wish the best to both of you!

I think I am mildly bipolar, and my life has changed ridiculously in the last year, total overhaul on various counts. I feel change is almost always a very good thing, but I haven&#039;t been able to shake the lethargy, ambivalence towards what I have always loved, difficulty enjoying music or nature, a notable absence of joy, and an absolutely presence of fatigue. There are a number of elements influencing this, but I consider it to be a mild depression, and I have no interest in conventional meds herein.<br /><br />My brief experienced thus far with low dose LSD has been a very significant clue to the &quot;cure&quot; (fundamentally, there is no cure, because there is nothing wrong, because the ego is creating the majority of the problem. remove that and do i have a neurological imbalance? i doubt it. even if i do, can i observe it and embrace it through psychological/psychotherapeutic/psycholytic means? I think so.)<br /><br />RaFaeL5&#039;s response is very important. I think microdosing LSD will have great benefit (considering detoxing and neuro-regeneration), but it is the type of thing that will be 100 times harder if you do not have a support group. Psycholytic therapy NEEDS support by friends and communication networks, and I don&#039;t feel the SR forum is enough. Do you have a network with whom you can discuss things?<br />The reason I am emphasising this is because of my experience with ayahuasca for several years which similarly &quot;brings things up&quot; which demand attention. If they don&#039;t get attention they will keep coming back and things will be tough. If you hear voices, they will be accentuated so that you can address their source or meaning, if you have highs and lows, these will probably be deeper and louder than normal. Psychedelics help us to address these issues and you need to be prepared.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173822.msg1379016#msg1379016">Quote from: RaFaeL5 on July 26, 2013, 09:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The idea is NOT to amplify the depression, but to diminish it... <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is where I disagree. Many medicines will act to diminish symptoms and not to cure the root of the disease. From what I know, other medicines including psychedelics amplify them such as to give the person the opportunity to view the issues with clarity. Through observation and non-judgement, clarity is often all we need to &quot;cure&quot;. Thus the issues stop ruling our lives, and become integrated and accepted as part of us, part of our history, but no longer dominating or distressing us.<br /><br />MDMA is showing great effects for PTSD with some therapeutic assistance. Even someone holding your hand when you are in the depths of it is &quot;therapy&quot; - i don&#039;t mean full blown talk-therapy (but I do like that). As PTSD is an anxiety disorder, which are comorbid with depression (a &quot;mood disorder&quot;), I imagine the effects will be very similar. the research is showing that 2 MDMA sessions at 75mg per session can drastically improve the psychological abilities of treatment-resistant PTSD war veterans (people who have gone through the mill of conventional psychiatry and have found nothing to help them).<br /><br />Sorry if this isn&#039;t relevant to the microdosing post so much as I&#039;m talking about macrodosing also, but I do believe that microdosing can help, but RaFaeL5&#039;s comments are very relevant.

				I&#039;m going to briefly weigh in on the depresssion/microdosing LSD issue.<br /><br />In my experience, I&#039;ve found that whenever I&#039;m depressed, going out and doing fun enjoyable things seems to help. Hanging out with good friends especially helps to get the happy chemicals flowing in my brain.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also found in my microdosing experience that a microdose of LSD will make me more social. So I can definately see using this to help with treating depression. It might just be the thing you need to get you out of your house and socializing with friends and doing fun enjoyable things. <br /><br />I also agree with R5&#039;s assesment that a nice heroic dose can also be useful for confronting the underlying cause of the depression. However, considering the risks, I&#039;d recommend microdosing first since the risks are much smaller.<br /><br />On a related note, I was talking to a RL friend yesterday who shared with me her experiences with small doses of psychedelics (LSD, psylocybin). Its not exactly microdosing, as her dose was about a quarter of a normal dose. She used this specifically for social situations. She doesn&#039;t smoke weed and was looking to cut down on the drinking, but yet didn&#039;t want to be sober in a social setting, especially where others are getting inebriated. She told me that the quarter dose of psychedelics made her very social and reported all around positive experiences.<br /><br />Well I had meant this to be brief, but somehow I had more to say than I thought. ;D Take care!

You might experience &quot;the super powers&quot; on a conscious level, but at the same time the &quot;dark thoughts&quot; that feed the depression could be fed themselves on a subconscious level by the micro-dose (similar to the use of amphetamines when depressing). Of course, this is pure theory from my part and we&#039;d need actual data to come to any real conclusion (and even then different people might/will react on a different way to a similar regime of psychedelic microdose). <br /><br />I just needed to stress that using a micro-dose of psychedelics on a regular basis to help &quot;cure&quot; a state of depression has some risks... This is playing guinea-pig with yourself: the results might be great, but they might also be disastrous. <br />Personally I&#039;d more be recommending 1 heroic dose (with the right preparation/guide/set&amp;setting) than micro-dosing in this specific case; but&nbsp; -again- this is a personal and theoretical point of view. <br /><br />The use of MDMA might be &quot;more safe&quot; in this specific setting than the use of LSD (or a combination of both?) but to really go in depth on this topic a specific forum thread should be started... maybe one of you could start something like &quot;depression and druguse/abuse?&quot;... <br /><br />Enjoy the weekend!

I really wish we could formulate a data collection, maybe @zipstyle&#039;s idea could be elaborated.<br /><br />But yes, apart from the physiological possibilities of LSD suppressing the symptoms, and thus exacerbating them in the long-run, it is a sad truth that many people still believe that drugs can cure them at all. The &quot;heroic dose&quot; method seems to be more like a delving deeply into the psychotherapeutic aspects of the experience, when the microdosing is so much slower and long-term, and yet both are in some way looking to the external for &quot;cure&quot;. This is indeed a big problem in an individual&#039;s psychology, where the cure MAY be more likely to be found within oneself (please note my caveat for those who want to argue that the basis of depression is physiological - that&#039;s not what i&#039;m talking about here. plus if we could accept that psychotherapeutic/psycholytic therapy can alter physiology, then we can bridge this arguement, albeit over a long period of academic translations [snore])<br /><br />I personally keep coming back to this idea of communicating with the essence of LSD as a healing phenomenon. Indeed lately, considering my next step with the molecule, I am experiencing its effects everyday without ingesting. Likewise, I previously mentioned once eating LSD and realising that I had eaten nothing but cardboard - because everything I experienced was in myself, there was nothing external that could alter my being.<br /><br />Nevertheless, that is moot when speaking with people who need help. So we have one question: could microdosing over a schedule be as effective or more effective at treating depression as a heroic dose. Question 2: How critical is the role of the individual&#039;s skill at internal reflection/&quot;psychotherapy&quot; in the &quot;cure&quot;? (e.g. it might not do much good if the person is just tripped out seeing pretty colours)<br /><br />btw, can you elaborate on your heroic dose experience? what dosage, what setting?<br /><br />I am sure that there are &quot;can i cure my depression with LSD&quot; threads here but i haven&#039;t really searched yet, but i think this is all nicely tied in with the microdosing experience, and like i say is very relevant for entheogens in psychiatry.<br /><br />Peace and Love chaps 8)<br />

I tripped myself out of a depression (why didn&#039;t I find the solution earlier I asked myself after many years of deep, black, lonely depression), but was very lucky! <br /><br />If you want more advise on this just PM me (because it&#039;s not really a part of this forum topic) or shoot your questions on the Avengers forum page. <br /><br />I have no idea how micro-dosing will affect the depression and it would off course be interesting to learn from your experiences (do keep us posted!), but I&#039;m not entirely sure that micro-dosing LSD is what will help you the most/best in this specific case. <br /><br />Better products to micro-dose when in a depression might be ketamine or GHB, maybe even MDMA. The idea is not to get superpowers (at least I don&#039;t think this is the primary idea) but to cure the depresssion...<br />even though I understand that you&#039;d want the superpowers...but the risk (I&#039;m thinking out loud now) is that LSD often works as an amplifier of feelings (that&#039;s why set and setting are so important when tripping). Maybe on micro-doses this amplifying could happen on a sub-perceptual level and if that&#039;s the case this could be a slumbering risk and it might take quite a while before you actually realize what&#039;s happened. The idea is NOT to amplify the depression, but to diminish it... <br /><br />I&#039;d love one of you guys (or even both of you) to try it out so that we could learn from it, <br />but I NEED to warn you about possible risks before supporting you in this. <br />I might be wrong, I might be right - the only way to know this for sure is for some people to try it out... but don&#039;t try it out not understanding the possible negative effect! <br /><br />I wish the best to both of you!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Amazing post. <br />PM sent!

				Ketamine is definitely a great candidate for working with depression if one does not binge. Once every other week as needed is a good schedule I think.

You don&#039;t need to be under the influence of the drug per se. It&#039;s the after-effects of the ketamine &quot;trip&quot; that really are the anti-depressants. Basically, I&#039;d say do a line or two of some s-iso ketamine, enjoy that, then when you come down you may have a new perspective on things. You may realize you are not so heavy anymore. That you are as free as you allow yourself to be. That depression is a thing of the past. This effect lasts for quite a while (at least for me) and I don&#039;t get rebound depression or anything from it. <br /><br />That said, I have only really used ketamine to treat depression once, but it almost always works. There are some good articles on the web about ketamine and depression as well. It&#039;s unfortunate how fast tolerance builds! However I think the anti-depressant effects work even though there is tolerance.

				@Vanquish: I didn&#039;t get your PM (not here nor on the main site) but in short I can tell you that I was young and very lucky. I was living a kind of &quot;fear and loathing in Las Vegas&quot; life, not expecting to ever reach the age of 18 (!), just going from rave party to rave party, staying awake for days in a row and basically just actively killing myself with drugs. Running from the depression and not feeling it as long as I was high as hell... one day on a rave party I bought a &quot;double Hoffman&quot; from an old hippie. I have no idea of the strength of the blotter, but I think they were estimated around 500ug... Personally I&#039;m very sensitive to psychedelics, so this experience was very strong...totally unexpected and in the worse possible set and setting (alone with just 1 friend I barely new, far from home or anyone trusted, without decent food or water, let alone supervision or preparation). <br />But, after a very painful beginning of the trip (damn, I still remember that part quite well) I was able to turn the experience around and from there on the trip had many phases (quite similar to the phases that Timothy Leary describes in his book about the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;). So first the bright light, me&amp;the universe being one, endless bliss and a total ego-death in a timeless zone of perception. Then bit by bit the ego was &quot;rebuild&quot; and while building every&nbsp; layer I &quot;saw&quot; the problems that had been built in the &quot;what used to be that layer&quot; (most of them resulting in my depression of the last 3 years at that time). I was able to understand much about those &quot;problems&quot; and most of them were solved during that 1 trip... then, by the time I came back to a fully build ego; most of the causes of my depression had been solved or I would have understood how to adapt my life in order to solve them and all of that in only 12 hours (!)... but it took me almost 3 days before I was able to speak normally again - before that I was so much busy trying to digest the experience that every communication (external communication) was just gibberish. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of some rogue therapists who do LSD with their patients and, in case you&#039;d be looking for such a possible experience, I would highly recommend you to prepare it well and preferably find one such therapist to help you get threw it, but also to help you not to waste the experience (because you could just as well end up enjoying the ride but not doing the work). <br /><br />But to be honest, for me the procedure was pure luck &amp; stupidity...&nbsp; :)<br /><br />(oh, and I have no idea about MXE)<br /><br />@cricketplank: <br />your first question &quot;could microdosing over a schedule be as effective or more effective at treating depression as a heroic dose&quot; has already gotten my answer (I think the heroic dose is much more likely to really change anything) but I also think this path is not laid for everyone...I&#039;ve known a friend who commited suicide after a few heroic doses and since then I&#039;m more carefull about whom I talk about this with... maybe the micro-dosing option could help more people, but I don&#039;t think LSD can be approached as a &quot;cure for everyone&quot;, for some reason it seems to have total different interaction with different persons (in different set/setting). Maybe it could cure someone in such a setting but not in another, or maybe it can cure certain types of depression but not all of them... <br />your second question: &quot;How critical is the role of the individual&#039;s skill at internal reflection/&quot;psychotherapy&quot; in the &quot;cure&quot;?&quot; - there is, for me, no doubt that if LSD is the car that can bring you there, then this is the key that can start the engine. People who lack this (or don&#039;t do it for some reason) will probably need help from others to do this thinking work. <br /><br />@Zipstyle: there is indeed lots of info regarding the use of K for depression. It seems to work wonderfully well, but I don&#039;t know how tolerance has an impact on the effects of K for this on the longer run. If you do find info on it...

				I have a friend that occasionally gets extremely high quality xtal, and he put together a micro-dose vial for me (about 10-15 per drop). I&#039;d micro-dosed before on occasion and enjoyed it thoroughly, but not as part of a continued regular practice. I&#039;m going to be also alternating mushroom small doses (.5 gram) as part of this. Considering inserting Mescaline into the routine also.<br /><br />First day today: AWESOME! It feels a little weird getting used to the ability to very easily &quot;dial in&quot; to the Self/One/Consciousness. It&#039;s like I&#039;ve been meditating for an hour at all times, but with a little &quot;jitteriness&quot; to it. Breath helps, plus I just had some great sex and that helped bring me back to a more grounded state. Able to work, think more clearly, find happiness in regular situations more easily, laugh easier...very nice!

				I&#039;ve been experimenting with 10-15mcg doses and besides the aforementioned positive effects (creativity, euphoria, problem-solving), I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s impossible for me to get academic work done. I have to work on a paper for uni but find it hard to focus for more than ten minutes at a time, my mind is all over the place, buzzing with thoughts and ideas, non-work related&nbsp; :)&nbsp; So so far, micro-dosing is excellent for life, if you don&#039;t have anything too serious to work on.&nbsp;

				@chil, when you were unable to get any work done, how much time had elapsed since you ingested the microdose? were you feeling inebriated at all while you were unable to work?<br /><br />I experimented with a similar dose (estimate) and felt inebriated for the first 3 or so hours after ingesting. I was not very productive while feeling &#039;high&#039; but once that feeling wore off, the superpowers really kicked in. I think a smaller dose would solve this problem, if I can ever get my hands on one....<br /><br />Speaking of which, I messaged Mahakala about 2 weeks ago about a microdosing vial and still haven&#039;t heard back. Starting to lose hope. :( Anyone heard from/know whats up with him?

				The inebriated feeling I&#039;m referring to is when I feel lightheaded for the 1st 3 hours or so after ingesting the microdose. Its a little more than just lightheaded. There&#039;s a bit of euphoria too. As in, I feel high and I like it ;D<br /><br />My mental claririty and other superpowers are stongest at around +4 - +9 hours after ingesting. But everyone&#039;s different. And&nbsp; it also depends on the dosage

				So about the emotional amplifying effects , has anyone had negative LSD microdose experiences ? I had about 10 times when the entire day felt like an emotional release and was very tense and unenjoyable. But after those I am now having enjoyable days mostly . Has anyone microdosed mescaline here ? I feel like the effects could be smoother and feel more &quot; natural &quot; than LSD . <br /><br />Also, I agree the first few hours are usually not fun and feel like mental blue balls to me

I have easy access to it, so it would be very easy for me to start experimenting.<br /><br />But, I think I love my rolls too much to start micro-dosing every other day or something. I want to save it for the heroic doses every now and then. And, I have somehow come to the conclusion that MDMA is not what I need, I need LSD. In general, I just feel a bit down, tired and don&#039;t feel like doing much. I need a kick in the butt. I need to let go of some things (this will be very, very hard), and see others from a different angle.<br /><br />I have empathy and love in my life, it&#039;s only that I feel I am in a dead end in some areas of my life. I think LSD would be better for me in this situation. I have been thinking about taking one proper LSD trip first, a good heroic dose, and then start micro-dosing after that.<br /><br />My problem is, that at the time it is very hard for me to arrange the fucking time for a proper trip with the proper setting and company, having family commitments and all. But I am working on it, definitely, blotters are already on their way :)<br /><br />Now, regarding MDMA. Let me start by telling that I did a lot of it when I was young (did a lot of many other substances too), then I kinda forgot about all these mind altering substances - other than alcohol. Recently I found MDMA again, and I have been doing it fairly often in the past few months. <br /><br />And I love it!<br /><br />The best thing coming from my use of MDMA is actually my reduced alcohol consumption. When I roll, I don&#039;t feel like drinking much at all. When I don&#039;t roll, I use a lot less alco than I used to. I have no comedowns what so ever from MDMA, and haven&#039;t had a hangover in moths. I have more energy than I used to have, I feel like the MDMA afterglow lasts for days. So in a way rolling with MDMA has already led to positive changes in my life. I feel happier, I smile a lot more. But still I can&#039;t really get things done.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, maybe a lot of my depression and problems are a result of alcohol. I have definitely seen it around me. Man, that is a hard, hard, hard drug...<br /><br />Love to everyone!

				On MDMA and the slowing of the thread:<br /><br />I mentioned previously how just hinking about a substance brings on its effects for me, that considering taking a macrodose of LSD would have me awake at night going through psychotherapeutic processes with a little extra assistance than normal - i refer to this as the spirit of LSD as a companion in the therapeutic process. <br />Recently I attended a conference which spoke a lot about MDMA and PTSD and anxiety, and I believe I mentioned some findings here also, but it inspired me to try MDMA for the first time in ten years. It was my belief that pills caused a depression several days after ingesting, but my experiences with GOOD MDMA did not have this - bad MDMA was naaaaasty. So I sought out the purest on the road - 4sale seems to have selective scammed me, maybe it got lost in the post, and I have made another purchase which seems to have a good feeling about it.<br />But seriously, just thinking about it brings on the effects for me, and it&#039;s easier to control without the messiness of having large doses and toxicity and time-consuming drug induced psychosis. I do look forward to macrodosing, but I am a busy man with serious responsibilities, and if THINKING about stuff is causing this huge effect, micro-dosing Definitely causes a significant effect, I&#039;m thinking woah, macrodosing will be Huge for me! After so many years cleansing my body of toxicity and psychological issues, I have no idea what to expect anymore.<br /><br />This thread will continue, dudes. I reckon everyone is &quot;processing&quot; (the most significant aspect of the therapeutic process - grounding the information into daily life!)<br /><br />Peace and love brothers.

				I dont know how helpful this will be since it&#039;s not really a recreational drug, but here&#039;s a link about microdosing (small sub psychedelic doses) of Ibogaine in the treatment of addiction, depression, etc:<br /><br />(CLEARNET)<br /><br />http://www.torontoibogainecentre.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=15#page<br /><br />(/CLEARNET)<br /><br />It talks about Ibogaine &quot;maintenance&quot; and booster doses, due to the fact that the biggest beneficial effects after a Flood/full dose can often wear off within 3-6 months.&nbsp; This is a way to retain them without doing another Flood.<br /><br />There is also info on the same site (cant remember if its in the same article or not) about using microdosing exclusively for people who are afraid of, or otherwise cannot safely tolerate, a full dose...and how it has shown to be effective even in this way.<br />

Just because you ingest a substance every day, does not automatically make it bad. It depends on what you&#039;re ingesting. And there&#039;s no evidence that the daily ingestion of LSD or psilocybin mushrooms in small dosages causes any damage to the human body. In fact, LSD has a lower toxicity level than coffee and vitamin c -- do you think people shouldn&#039;t take vitamin supplements or drink coffee every morning?

No, both the ordinary and the non-ordinary are good. It can be beneficial to some individuals to explore both forms of consciousness.<br />

Many people want to take it because it has profound neurological effects (herein termed &quot;superpowers&quot; by one of our friends) which have been discussed. This is also provided by meditation, and so the LSD may provide a catalyst to speed up to processes - be it shedding the things you don&#039;t want in your life or being more creative or less anxious, that type of thing. Many people see meditation as the most fundamental step of changing yourself for the better, because if you do not meditate you might not be able to see how your mind controls your life and makes you do weird shit that you don&#039;t want to do. some people take large doses of psychedelics regularly, and maybe this has a similar overall effect, but personally i prefer being self-sufficient, that I&#039;m not relying on something external. Because, after all, it&#039;s me who has to live with myself, and if i&#039;m capable of cleansing my mind and being effective, why rely on someone or something else to do it for me? <br />in the same way, meditating can help you observe the effects of LSD much more clearly. when we&#039;re not busy busy or distracting ourselves from things, we can notice a huge difference in what happens when we meditate. Personally, there is no question that i have been to much more interesting, far out, profound amazing places while meditating with psychedelics than if i was not meditating.<br /><br />Some of the discussion stopped about this because Rafael5 opened a new thread on the subject<br /><br /><br /><br />edit: i think 7.5ug could be an ideal dose, as Rafael5 has said many times, around 5 - 7ug is recommended. you might need to do this a few times before you notice any shifts

				Thanks for the insight, cricketplank! I&#039;ve never seen it that way; to be honest, meditation was never on my priority research list.<br />If there&#039;s another thread, sorry for bringing it up again :)<br /><br />About yesterdays experience, I&#039;m not really sure how I should feel about it. Throughout the day, I had a *slight* feeling of uneasiness when being around other people. Nothing not to handle or bear, but noticable.<br />I was very tired in the afternoon, which is not usual for me. The tiredness went away after about half an hour.<br />I was playing a gig in the evening, which went pretty well. Although the venue was completely sold-out, all the people didn&#039;t bother me. I believe my instrument was some sort of trigger to kill the uneasiness. I have experienced something similar during my LSD trip. I played some variations that I normally wouldn&#039;t have played, they just popped in to my head.<br />Despite the uneasiness, I had a sensation of peace and harmony throughout the day. I felt connected, yet in charge, to everything around me. Also, colors were definetely more vibrant and the sunlight looked different, more peaceful than harsh.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what is to be attributed to the LSD or to Mr. Placebo :) I guess I have too little experience to judge (1 trip).<br />Also, at one point (about 2 hours after ingesting it) I felt like I was tripping (which I didn&#039;t want to happen). I was reading, and the words were definetely a little shaking/moving around. Again, might be a placebo. I can&#039;t imagine 7.5ug being enough to trigger that. Then again, I don&#039;t really know if it was 7.5ug, I can only rely on what the vendor says (1 blotter = 120ug). <br /><br />All in all very interesting. I have not taken a dose today, I decided to wait a few days to let the experience sink in :)<br /><br />peace to all<br />c13

I&#039;ve written here that I feel effects without taking anything - is that &quot;placebo&quot; or is that accessing similar neural pathways because of memory and association with previous acid trips?<br />My personal understanding is that there is a physiological/non-placebo effect with micro-dosing, which exacerbates an already-present self-mechanism which allows for introversion and healing (which is what is accessed through meditation).<br /><br />Another point on meditation I think is good to remember is that it does not mean sitting in one place and staying still. We are meditating quite frequently, when we go out walking or when we&#039;re half-asleep - it really just means observing what&#039;s going on inside your body-mind. You don&#039;t necessarilly need a protocol to do this, although it is of great benefit to many people. All you need to do is chill out, preferably without distraction, and observe what&#039;s going on inside.<br /><br />It might be worth trying a lower dose. I found I also got really tired and had to go to bed, but I would meditate in this time and connect with the LSD, rather than going to sleep. This was really critical to my getting an understanding of what &quot;micro-dosing&quot; can do, but I intend to go for a lower dose.<br /><br /><br /><br />@Rafael5 and all:<br />About to order 5ug blotters which would let me microdose to very low amounts, very excited!

				wow, lots of activity here... so, lots to react on... :-)<br /><br />@ GSE: I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;m disappointing you in regards of the originality of my ideas. I&#039;m not looking to impress you or others, I just enjoy spending my time on this thread that I started because I felt the need to gather information on this topic. I enjoy the fact that you contribute to this thread especially since you&#039;ve brought a new light on the topic (or at least you&#039;ve brought a new facet/detail in the light of this topic), but I do feel that your remark (link: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173822.msg1458164#msg1458164 ) was a bit hostile. If you have more information, however, I think it&#039;s more useful and constructive to share it here on the forum than by using PM&#039;s. <br />Also, on a personal note, I think there is no worse personality or way of thinking than a &quot;fixed&quot; one. Go with the wind, keep an open mind, be ready to challenge your believes and change your way of thinking when new information is available - those are values that do fit me quite well (maybe some times too much but hé, you don&#039;t have to live with me, do you? ). <br />...<br />But yes, my experiences have also showed me (at many occasions) that moderation is the healthiest key - but probably not always the most transformative. <br />...<br />I&#039;m not gone react on the other posts you&#039;ve made - it doesn&#039;t seem constructive and I&#039;d rather avoid &quot;feeding&quot; this kind of discussions in this thread. <br /><br />@ c13hqPX7d: glad to welcome you here and glad that you enjoyed the lecture. Welcome among those who have visited Lalaland to discover that the danger of LSD is not a bad trip, but a changed look at reality and yourself! <br />...<br />If you&#039;re interested in meditation you might want to visit the other thread about meditation (link = http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181927.0 ) over the coarse of the discussion it somehow deviated towards occultism, but still there&#039;s lots of useful info over there (and lots of books are mentioned worth reading if you would like to know more about it). If you visit, feel free to bump it! <br />...<br />Personally I think meditation can also be used to get the most out of your LSD from the learning point of view. Let me explain: most people who take LSD go out and perform some activity (whether on a party or in the woods or...) but while being physically active they &quot;deviate&quot; their focus outwards. While meditating on acid you have &quot;no other option&quot; than to focus your attention inwards. Many people who are physically active will (at some point during their trip, once or more) feel uncomfortable or wish that it was all over/less intense - especially at those moments it&#039;s interesting to not spend more attention outwards (very often this is the moment when people make love...), but instead to really focus inwards - the uneasiness of the moment often comes from a certain insight that LSD tries to give us (or that our alternated state of mind tries to show us) and since many of those insight are quite confronting it&#039;s normal to try to avoid it, but absolutely worthwhile to go deeper in it and learn from it - no better way to do this than be meditating at that moment. <br />And, as written, meditation can be passive, but it can also be active - the key to meditation is silencing &quot;those little voices in your head&quot; (distraction/built in safety system of your ego that doesn&#039;t want to be changed), once that is done from within the quietness you&#039;ll get a lot of information/images/words/thoughts/...<br /><br />@joywind: I agree with you when saying that the toxicity of LSD (for the body) is low, but I still think that even with this low toxicity the risk of frequent micro-dosing is probably not a physical one, but might be a mental/psychological one. That&#039;s why I keep on repeating the advise given by Dr.Fadiman to take not more often than once every three days. A sub-perceptual dose of such a transformative product as LSD doesn&#039;t mean it does nothing, it just means it works &quot;under the radar&quot;. The psyche most definitely is feeling &quot;something&quot; and thus it most probably needs time to recover between 2 doses. <br />...<br />quote: &quot;It can be beneficial to some individuals to explore both forms of consciousness.&quot; - at the risk of dissapointing GSE again I have to say that I agree with you! If people feel the urge to try alternate states of mind, it&#039;s without any doubt because they have lots of (self)knowledge to gain in this experience. <br /><br />quote: &quot;I can asure you they have nothing to do with drinking of tea in the morning.&quot; Hilarious! LMAO<br /><br />@ Zipstyle: I used to have lots of microdots about 8 years ago (it was my GF&#039;s favourite back FOA) but for some reason I assimilate it with the winter, while drops are assimilated with summer (and blotters with all year-round)... I don&#039;t know why exactly (it&#039;s not because they were only available during the winter - they were available all year round back then). Anyway, I often found it to be more &quot;dark&quot; than drops or blotter (or gelatine), but my GF thinks the opposite - so let me know what you think of them :-)<br /><br />quote: &quot;are we done yet&quot;. Yes, I do hope so... <br /><br />@ echo_ : nice to see you joined the discussion. Thank you for the constructive (and appeasing) comment. <br /><br />@ ianflemming: not only is oxygen altering our behavior, but it&#039;s also one of the most toxic products were in contact with on a daily basis... Someone I know often said that if we could live without oxygen we&#039;d live forever... It does the same to our body as it does to iron... <br />PS: I like your signature, but you might add that sometimes when looking threw the piece of glass you see nothing and sometimes you see the things just as they are without any distortion... Isn&#039;t it?

				First of all I feel the urge to thank GSE for his latest reply. <br />I&#039;m still not convinced that the path of moderation is the most transformative path - right now I&#039;m thinking about the concept of &quot;Zorba the Buddha&quot; (IF I&#039;m not mistaking it was first discussed by Osho). In this concept &quot;Osho&quot; states that one of the easiest ways to reach enlightenment is to abuse about everything in life before coming to peace with yourself. But I&#039;ve heard this from an &quot;Osho-sinjasin&quot; so maybe this information should be upgraded/updated; I&#039;m not sure of it - but I found the concept quite interesting (and fitting!). <br />I do believe that what&#039;s more important than moderation is the need to evolve similarly in as many directions as possible (such as a sun is radiating in all possible directions) and not to evolve very quickly in one aspect of life but not or only slowly evolving in other aspects of life. I think evolving to quickly in one direction is bringing your being out of balance - but this is just a personal idea that I have (no fancy quote from fancy guru&#039;s this time). <br /><br />GSE: thank you for your answer...<br /><br />Then, Zipstyle: first thank you for the compliment! ;-) <br />and I&#039;ll check that link asap. I&#039;ll come back to you when I&#039;ve red the whole thing... <br /><br />And last, Cricketplank: great news that is!!! Make sure to be extremely specific about the dosage and I&#039;d recommend taking your first micro-dosing blotter on a day off (with all possible preparations for a &quot;normal&quot; voyage into Lalaland) in case the dosage was not accurate. <br />I&#039;m very curious about the result of these custom made micro-dosing blotters!!!

I&#039;m not sure if micro-doses would be a harmful dosage yet, but I would keep this in mind when using mushrooms for regular micro-dosing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other than that, I&#039;d say again that the right weight/quantity for micro-dosing will vary (a lot) between species, batches, growers, ... so my personal opinion is that it&#039;s doesn&#039;t makes much sense to discuss the weight, you&#039;ll just have to find out by yourself how strong your mushrooms are and how much of them you need (there&#039;s also a personal factor to keep in mind here, such as gender, weight, history of usage, personal tolerance, ...) - but most probably you don&#039;t need to weight your mushrooms, it might be sufficient to just eat 1 small mushrooms instead of a whole bag of them... also, eating 1 entire mushroom of similar size each time will probably give you a more accurate &quot;dosage&quot; than eating a weighted portion made out of different mushrooms since the concentration of psylocibine is different in different parts of the mushroom (there&#039;s more in the head than in the stem).<br /><br />If you want to work with weight the best dosage (for most products) to start with seems to be about 1/10 of your threshold dosage for a full-blown psychedelic experience, so in your case that should be somewhere around 0.45 gram, but beware that this can be more than needed for a micro-dose and thus I wouldn&#039;t recommend taking this first dose unless you can afford to have a stronger effect than expected...<br /><br />Keep us posted!

A very big detail in this experiment! I was thinking I could just grind up a few grams and mix it all together. At least I think that would lead to more consistency in the dose.<br /><br />I have never heard that mushrooms are bad for your kidneys. I am reasearching this atm and if anyone else had any information on the subject I would greatly appreciate your input.<br /><br />I will try to have a post up later today with more knowledge, its time to begin ;)

				This highlights a very important issue from my angle. It is my opinion that through the pharmacopeia of plants, or even focusing solely on fungi, there is a massive library of medicinal qualities that can be extracted from the various species. One of my goals eventually is to work with someone who understands the real difference between the various species, psychedelic and non psychedelic (people may be familiar with Stamet&#039;s work), from which a medicinal pharmacopeia can be created for treatment of various different psychological disturbances. e.g. after psychoanalysis you will be recommended to use blank mgs of whatever species for however long a time.<br />I like to think of how things will be when psychedelics have a balanced place in society and medicine, where they belong.

				So far the experiences have been pretty amazing overall.<br />Though I&#039;ve only scratched the surface of what I believe MXE can do.<br />Right now I&#039;ve had 3 ~40mg experiences.<br />Seems to be a very pleasant and effortless come up, and then once it starts hitting you things get weird fast.<br />The pain relief from just the MXE alone is some of the best I&#039;ve experienced outside of opiates.<br />I believe it may actually have healing or anti-inflammatory quality&#039;s.<br /><br />That statement of course is just based on quantitative results thus far.<br />But overall the potential for MXE seems to be almost limitless.<br />The experience itself can be very disorienting overall and it&#039;s probably impossible to describe it accurately until I get more trips under my belt with it.<br />Interesting auditory and visual changes.&nbsp; Clean feeling, and introspective.&nbsp; Yet also very confusing and heavy at times.<br />There are these unique aspects of MXE that are beyond my comprehension at the moment.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m taking it slow, and only using it every couple of weeks.<br />As I do see the potential for addiction and redosing - though it&#039;s definitely not fiendish.<br />Currently for MXE alone I plan on raising the amount by +10mg each time until I comfortably find the best dosage.<br />My first time using it actually almost pushed me into an M-Hole.&nbsp; I was right there, and then suddenly the hole just slowly disappeared.<br />The potency of the MXE I have right now is extremely high.&nbsp; Some very pure crystal, and it shows threshold first sign effects at around 5mg&#039;s.<br /><br />Doing some research it seems that the 2C-x family has some really high potential for bringing some amazing combinations to the table.<br />I&#039;m definitely going to take it slowly and work my way towards some more research.<br />Overall, I&#039;m extremely impressed with MXE.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely one of the most promising RC&#039;s to hit the market in ages.<br /><br />Here is my current planned micro-dosing schedule.<br />5-10mg MXE, 6.5g Kratom, .5 Valium - 2 or 3 times per day.<br /><br />That&#039;s it for now, but I&#039;ll keep this updated for sure.<br />Once I get my hands on some 2C-x&#039;s I&#039;ll be posting some more in depth trip reports.<br />Plus eventually some higher dosage straight MXE trips.<br />Should be fun! :)<br /><br />Vanquish

				Be careful. MXE is addictive in a very sneaky and insidious way. I didn&#039;t recognize any problem until it was almost too late.

				@cricketplank: I&#039;d say no, but have you found people who stated that they felt some tolerance build up? If they did, they probably took too much (more than a micro-dose), couldn&#039;t it? <br />My experience was that taking a micro-dose 3 days before a full-dose had no effect on the full-blown trip at all...<br /><br />@Rhett Butler: try to watch for the color of your urine after a decent mushroom trip...if it looks orange/red, then you know enough... (that was the case for me most of the times). <br /><br />@Vanquish: I think it&#039;s wise indeed to take the advise of Ballzinator quite serious! I&#039;m not familiar with MXE, but after having tried a lot of RC&#039;s in my &quot;young years&quot; I know that I became quite &quot;anti&quot; and very sceptic...many (if not most) of them have a number of &quot;hidden dangers&quot; such as quick addiction or heavy toll on your body/mind after repeated usage. I&#039;d love to know more about your experiments with this product, but do keep your safety and health on the first place at all times ;-)<br /><br />@ Zipstyle: I didn&#039;t check the forum for a few days, so thank you for asking about dosage/multiple products dosages - that&#039;s the only way to gather actual information and have the knowledge grow<br /><br />@Ballzinator: thank you for the warning, coming from you I guess this can be taken seriously.<br /><br /><br /><br />@all: so, where are we with the MDMA, the GHB and the ketamine experiments? Any news on those fronts? <br />Keep your body safe and your head cool, as long as you do that I&#039;m convinced that micro-dosing certainly has opportunities... <br /><br />

				@Vanquish: wow, Vanquish - that seems like a troubling experience... I had a quick look at your other post regarding your &quot;nearly dead experience&quot;... I do not know you at all, I don&#039;t know your personal level of expertise with psychedelics, nor your level of resistance to stress in those moments... I have to say (and let it be clear I do NOT say this in a non-respectful way!) it sounds to me that you&#039;ve had a very intense trip - something that you clearly were not expecting... <br />&quot;I&#039;m dying&quot;-trips are not easy trips to handle and I would normally not detail about it on this topic, but since you cross-posted it here I quickly react to it. <br />Thinking that you&#039;re going to die is something that can happen during strong psychedelic experiences. One of the reasons it&#039;s recommended to trip with a &quot;sitter&quot; is so that someone sober could, when you&#039;re thinking your dying, check you (just a bit of first-aid knowledge is enough) and reassure you about your physical health. <br />If a sober person can reassure you that you&#039;re body is doing fine, then you know that it&#039;s only the trip - and once you know that it&#039;s way easier to &quot;give in to the feeling of dying&quot; and then go with the experience instead of fighting it. <br />Anyway, if you can allow yourself to &quot;die&quot; you will find very rewarding knowledge on the other side of the door... <br />Again, I don&#039;t know you and your fear might have been real - some mushrooms can be quite dangerous (especially &quot;amanita&quot;species are ridiculously dangerous and should not be used in a recreational manner) - but when I read your description it seems to me the experience was more overwhelming than what you were expecting and that (because you were in such a deep/strong trip) you reacted to it in a manner that you wouldn&#039;t have reacted if you were sober. <br /><br />Then, regarding what you wrote about your addictions: if I were you I&#039;d look into the possibilities of iboga... also, there&#039;s a huge difference between physical addiction and mental addiction. I don&#039;t know how this is with the products you&#039;ve mentioned - but the &quot;solution&quot; is very different in the different cases. If you want to know more about it feel free to PM me. <br /><br />Also, drinking too much water (someting that can happen while you&#039;re tripping/on MDMA) can cause harm. It&#039;s known to have caused kidney failure in a number of cases... That&#039;s one of the reasons why my GF and I fill a few bottles with water before we take off and while we trip we regularly drink from these bottles, the goal being to drink at least 1 bottle of 1.5l each during the trip (approximately 8h) and max 2 such bottles each. Also when on MDMA we try to &quot;control&quot; our water consumption in that way. <br /><br />Then as a last I&#039;d like to write that, when you&#039;ve taken drugs and the experience is not good (mental or physical) the worse thing you can do - normally - is to take more/other drugs... If the experience is not nice, just &quot;sit it out&quot;. If the experience is life-threatening get professional help. <br /><br />Again, I don&#039;t know you and just by reading your message it&#039;s impossible to know if your situation was life-threatening or an ego-death experience. <br /><br /><br /><br />@Tesselated: strange that you felt a tolerance build-up it&#039;s contrary to my experience and to what can be found in most of the literature... How much were you taking? And how often were you taking (daily or every few days, ...)? <br /><br /><br />@Cricketplank: how are things going regarding your 5microgram blotters? Any news on that front?

				@rafael5: haven&#039;t ordered yet cause i&#039;m watching the bitcoin (going up a euro a day), but will next week probably<br /><br />@all: Can people keep in their heads the potential association between psychedelics and renal function? I am positive there is a link, maybe just with the ion channels, but there must be a neuro link. Any info is greatly appreciated. The only thing I&#039;ve gotten so far from asking around is &quot;yeah lsd makes you pee&quot; or &quot;yeah lsd stops you from peeing&quot;. In chinese medicine the kidneys and bladder are associated with fear and anxiety, something that I experienced very strongly on my last lsd ingestion, and had very strong diuretic effects. of course our neurology is an expansive field, and few understand it holistically, but at the moment I am gathering this information myself.<br /><br />@Vanquish: You will have been flamed and also the recipient of plenty of good advice by now. I&#039;m sure you will have become aware of the pros and cons of your choices, and that they are probably still rolling around in your head. Are you getting rest now?<br />I have experience in therapy and healthcare, and am interested in your choices and also how you are presenting them in your relationship with the SR forum. My wish for you, as they say, is that you get rest from the things which may be causing you harm and suffering. I hope that you can look into the things that cause your addictions and your choices with a new light - not from the same light that all these words come from -<br />Rafael5 has suggested ibogaine - I cannot stress enough that you do not take this by yourself or even with a sitter. I beg you to trust me that there are ways to help, but the right channels are there for a reason - by that I mean clinics and shamans who are not operating from egotism or fear. If I were to recommend anything, as someone who doesn&#039;t know you or your case but has read this report, I would recommend approaching the Takawasi center in Peru for ayahuasca intensives, where I would trust that you could, with tough work and good care, become one with the essence of the things that have made you suffer.<br />I&#039;m sorry that words always come out sounding egotistical.<br />I am not questioning any of your choices, or doubting your reasons for anything. There is some very important information to consider, and you now have the memory and presence to take the time you need.<br /><br />All peace and love.

				I&#039;m glad my medicine and I could be a part of this healing experience for you Vanquish. Sometimes the spirits feel the need to hit us with the cosmic 2x4, but it is always for our highest good. <br /><br />I&#039;ve found the trick to being able to consume substances over a long period of time (20 years) for me has been a combination of keeping it almost completely NATURAL, and realizing that the natural plant medicines have living spirits that I need to acknowledge, respect, and attune to. (Natural for me includes extracts, etc.)<br /><br />My first ayahuasca ceremony was with an 88 year old shaman in the Amazon.

I have no desire whatsoever to screw with perfection! 9 other people received the same in samples and no others almost died. <br /><br />Vanquish had a unique experience probably due to his other consumptive habits/health issues/current physical state/etc. The mushrooms did their job in bringing on the crisis, though. He has had a true personal epiphany in this experience.<br /><br />SS

				that is true, proper psilocybin mushrooms will not bring such severe physical effects like dehydration, so only a toxicolgy test is going to find out what caused that<br /><br />all he was saying is that the shrooms were the first and only thing he ate and then within an hour the bad effects start, so it&#039;s a process of elimination when multiple substances are involved<br /><br />but he did say the shroom were the fist thing, and that&#039;s all we know, but good luck to him in the hospital.

				@TheIllusiveDeus: I stand by what khorne flake wrote: do NOT dose someone without her/his explicit concent... if you agree with a friend to dose each other at an unpredicted moment (while on holidays or such) that&#039;s something else (and can be quite fun depending on how good you handle the &quot;unexpected&quot; experience) but giving someone acid without her/him knowing it and agreeing with it is absolutely a NO GO. <br /><br />@khorne flake: thank you for pointing that out<br /><br />@Tesselated: I just saw your reply now... 20ug seems to be quite on the &quot;high&quot; side of dosage. What seems to be working best for most is a dosage between 5 and 10microgram. Maybe if you&#039;d lower your dose you would not notice any tolerance build-up any more? I&#039;ve had nu such effect so I guess that, if you have it, it&#039;s either a personal difference towards the product, or a question of dosage... <br /><br />@Vanquish: how are you doing now? Have all the (undesired) effects stopped? Are you back on track? I do hope you are!<br /><br />@TorXic: thank you for the link, I liked to read the page.

My hypothesis is that this is due to heavy use of psychedelics. Terence Mckenna, Steve Jobs, Tim Leary are few that come to my mind ATM. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s been a while since I posted in this thread. But this is a recurring theme with people disagreeing and agreeing. Lets make this clear there is no peer reviewed evidence that LSD or other psychedelics have ever caused cancer. I am discounting research chemicals in this statement though. There are no long term studies on their harm. And I would steer clear of them until some human trails have taken place.<br /><br />But if we are talking about LSD, mushrooms, DMT and other established entheogens. Then there is zip, zero, nothing and fuck all solid evidence for that statement. <br /><br />Now I don&#039;t what to say that psychedelics aren&#039;t harmful, they are , but the harm&nbsp; comes from its inappropriate use. Not from its effect on the human body and brain. Psychedelics are one of the safest drugs you can take, when it comes to physical harm. <br /><br />If psychedelics did cause cancer, then we would have seen it by now in the general population.&nbsp; There are many more people that have died of cancer, that never touched psychedelics. There are lots of people that have taken psychedelics and never had cancer.<br /><br />The fact that someone had cancer and took psychedelics is just pure coincidence, cancers are very common ways to die. And you are only putting significance on it because they are well known. What other things did these people have in common? Maybe they all drunk water at 10:00 am in the morning. Or they all drove white cars at one point in their life. What about all the famous people that died of cancer but never took LSD?<br /><br />Correlation is not causation.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />LSD was first discovered in 1938, and although it is difficult to know how many people have taken it. However, in one 1998 survey in England in Wales, 11 per cent of those aged 16-29 said they had tried it at least once, two per cent said they had tried it during the year preceding the survey. Thus quite a few people have taken it by now and quite a few will have been heavy users. If these drugs caused cancer we would have seen it by now.<br /><br />Other psychedelics have a long history of human use without any physical harm effects. And if psychedelics were shown to cause cancer the first people to tell you this would be the government. But it has never been listed as a potential harm.<br /><br />Looking at the examples given, <br /><br />Tim Leary died of prostate cancer at age 75 - One of the most common cancers for men of his age. Prostate cancer mainly affects men over the age of 50 and your risk increases with age. The average age for men to be diagnosed with prostate cancer is between 70 and 74 years. <br /><br />Terence Mckenna died of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Which is the most COMMON and most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans. For unknown reasons, GBM occurs more commonly in males.&nbsp; Consumption of the artificial sweetener aspartame causes brain tumors in rats and its increasing prevalence in diet sodas parallels the increasing prevalence of glioblastoma in western cultures.<br /><br />Steve Jobs dies of Pancreatic cancer, which is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. And by his own account he only took LSD 10-15 times. Not exactly heavy.<br /><br />Harm reduction for LSD is all about set and setting and knowing the dose you are taking and that you are taking LSD and not something else.<br /><br />Rant over....&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				@TheIllusiveDeus: Albert Hoffman is a nice guy, his product has been top in the past (and probably still is). Dissolving his liquid yourself will give you a (quite) accurate dosage per drop.

Say &quot;hi&quot; to Albert for me, will ya? <br /><br />@flyinghigh1660: I liked your long and detailed post. Nice to have those info&#039;s put out as clear as that. Never mind GSE&#039;s comments on you. For what I know you could be a 72year old woman addicted to knitting and who has 14 cats and 2 gold fishies in a bowl - I still woulnd&#039;t care about it, what it&#039;s about is what you bring to the community, how detailed and to-the-point your answers can be and how it contributes to the discussion... And seen from this point of view I have to say that your comment was much more interesting than GSE&#039;s response to it. Thank you for the details. <br /><br />@ GSE: as said before, I appreciated your input in the discussion - especially since you were the first one to bring this &quot;detail&quot; into our attention, but to be honest: I&#039;m not so keen on your latest posts on this forum page. I hope that you will continue to contribute to the discussion since you are a smart guy/gal with lots of knowledge and a sharp tongue, but I hope you will be able to control yourself from posting non-contributing posts here in the future and keep it (as sharp as you can) about the topic of micro-dosing LSD and other psychedelic substances... <br /><br />@Purple_Hue000: if you check this entire thread you&#039;ll probably find some info on those nBome&#039;s, but if I remember right they have been &quot;disqualified&quot; of the field of micro-dosing because there&#039;s a build-up of tolerance even on low dosage... Check it out (I might be confusing with some other RC).&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link to Zip&#039;s post: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173822.msg1424561#msg1424561 but I couldn&#039;t find anything on it about those bom&#039;s... anyway, stay on the safe side with those RC&#039;s... <br /><br />

				Thanks for another reply! <br /><br />No need to apologize my friend. I hope I did not make you feel guilty. Sorry for my harsh shit-writing.<br /><br />Just to clarify some things: with &quot;looking inside&quot; and &quot;cleaning my room&quot; I did not mean visualizing my inner landscape and meditate or something like that but looking in the home I live in, vacuuming the floor and organizing the things on the shelves. By doing this I imagine I will have a easier journey through life and also sleep better at night which is really important while micro dosing LSD or not micro dosing LSD.<br /><br />I know I don&#039;t need my GSE and you don&#039;t need your ML but some mystical energy force (gravity? chakras?) seem to connect our shit making us enjoy eachother.<br /><br />I am already on a path with a good diet and improving cleanliness and freshness (mental and physical) but I think these two things might never be enough for me to take on the higher dose. Might take on teaching first. Time will tell.<br /><br />Nice explanation on the things and thinking. So a thinking man is a thing king man, a man who is king of things?<br /><br />Thanks for the great soul compliment!

For what I know you could be a 72year old woman addicted to knitting and who has 14 cats and 2 gold fishies in a bowl - I still woulnd&#039;t care about it, what it&#039;s about is what you bring to the community, how detailed and to-the-point your answers can be and how it contributes to the discussion... And seen from this point of view I have to say that your comment was much more interesting than GSE&#039;s response to it. Thank you for the details. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No problem, thank you for your positive comments.<br /><br />I have no problem with what GSE wrote, they can be applied to anyone really. I found it funny, I don&#039;t tend to get into flame wars on forums. What is the point? Smile and move on.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />+1 to GSE for making me smile.<br /><br />As GSE says I use science and peer reviewed evidence to help me make informed decisions. I think that is a good way to approach these things. This is because of my background and training. Others may not, and may discount this approach. My use of psychedelics teaches me that we all share a common consciousness. Thus I am not here to say other views shouldn&#039;t be respected<br /><br />I am not saying that GSE is wrong, I am saying that currently there is no evidence to suggest that these drugs cause cancer, or if they do the risk is any higher that other common substances that we take into our bodies every day. This is not to say that things may change when we collect more evidence. But that is the beauty of science, you can change your mind based on the best available evidence. That is the true definition of an open mind.<br /><br />GSE and I both share a common message which is, keep in mind that all drugs are harmful. And seek to reduce your harm to yourself and others when taking them<br /><br />People should have a read of The Psychedelic Explorer&#039;s Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys by James Fadiman. Good information on micro dosing and its effects.<br /><br />[clearnet warning] http://www.amazon.com/The-Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic/dp/1594774021<br />

				A brilliant substance indeed, Vanquish!<br />I very much enjoyed AL-LAD at the various doses I tried. 37.5 ug, 75 ug, and 150 ug.<br />The 37.5 ug was still rather active at the psychedelic level, so a little too high for nootropic doses, but I can definitely see it as a good candidate for microdosing research. :)

Again, surprising results, since taking a large dose of LSD always makes me bounce off the walls with all kinds of extra energy. It did stimulate my brain nicely, tho. ;D<br /><br />I wouldnt recommend it for battling fatugue, however. I&#039;d suggest caffeine for that, it works quite well for me.

You seemed to feel deeply sorry for your family, so don&#039;t disapoint them another time and maybe try to see what&#039;s the cause of you having to take so much drugs in such a short timeframe. Not being judgemental here, just trying to help. <br /><br />And yes, the best solution to end fatigue is regular exercise, and regular sleep. No drugs. Even mild stimulants such as coffee end up using your nervous system. One in the morning is fine, but that&#039;s it. the more coffee you drink, the more likely you are bound to have insomnias.&nbsp;

				Wowza!&nbsp; This thread has really taken off since my last visit back in June, or was it early July...&nbsp; It&#039;s been a busy summer, and a lot has happened.<br /><br />I caught up on the last 13 pages today.&nbsp; It&#039;s interesting to see how many people have gotten in on this thread, and the contributions everyone has made.<br /><br />I took a break from psychedelics for a while, and then took a full month off from all things mind altering, even coffee/tea.&nbsp; It was an interesting month to say the least, as my sobriety became the trip.&nbsp; I spent most of my free time working out, meditating, and also took Chaga every day as a sort of full body/mind cleanse.&nbsp; Overall it was good for me, and I think I need to take breaks more often to keep my head clear.&nbsp; I noticed my dreams were much more vivid during this time, I even experienced my first few experiences with astral travel.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve since eased back into my cannabis use, and I am looking to start micro dosing again.&nbsp; Before reading through the thread I noticed that there are micro dosing options in the marketplace these days, and that is very exciting.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be looking into ordering some of Mahakala&#039;s low dose blotters, hopefully by the end of this month.&nbsp; The only downside is now that I am using cannabis again, my dreams are all but non-existent.<br /><br />I just wanted to address a couple things, and put in my two cents.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the nbome series should not be completely ruled out for micro dosing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had some great success with 25i-nbome micro dosing every 3 days.&nbsp; The tolerance didn&#039;t seem to build up at all for me, but as said so many times before, everyone is different, and will react differently.&nbsp; It seems to lack the creative side compared to the 2C compounds I micro-dosed.&nbsp; It was generally very positive and upbeat.<br /><br />I also believe MXE to have some powerful healing qualities as well, and have been using it over the last couple of years here and there.&nbsp; I have not micro dosed with it, but I always have the most incredible breakthroughs with this compound.&nbsp; I have never done over 25mg of a highly pure product, with 10mg usually being plenty for positive effects all day.&nbsp; It completely wipes any depression, stress, anxiety, and is always filled with joy.&nbsp; It is as if it tears down all my walls in the best way possible, and leaves me free to interact(this is great for my social anxiety that comes and goes).&nbsp; This will probably change with regular use though, as tolerance builds somewhat fast.&nbsp; It may be interesting to see how it would work on the every 3 day schedule at a lower dose.&nbsp; Research shows that it has a lasting DRI(Dopamine Re-uptake Inhibitor) function, opioid interaction, and of course NMDA antagonism.&nbsp; These three things could make it difficult for certain ones to use it responsibly.&nbsp; I never feel I &quot;need&quot; more, but I also find myself tempted to begin taking it every day or every other day.&nbsp; The good vibes, energy, and focus it gives me can be compared to nothing else.&nbsp; The lasting DRI effect also keeps my mood very stable for a few days.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning to do more research on this, perhaps combined with Kratom.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT: One thing to note with Methoxetamine.&nbsp; It may potentially do damage to the kidneys, especially if abused.<br /><br />Kratom has done wonders for me over the years as well, and should not be overlooked.&nbsp; I find it is very life affirming, and is a better pick me up than coffee.&nbsp; I was taking somewhat small doses(3 grams powder) 3 times a week for a while with good success.<br /><br />Good luck with the experiments everyone, and be safe :)<br /><br />Peace &amp; Love<br />JB

				wow...lots of comments in a short period of time... <br />the holidays have ended and everyone is back home :-)<br /><br />@Vanquish: you&#039;ve gotten quite some good answers so I will not repeat them, but I&#039;m not convinced micro-dosing LSD will help you to get out of bed... It might give you some &quot;extra&quot; tiredness since it has done that to a few people who tried it, at least during the first hours or so... so if you really want to use micro-doses of LSD for this it might be better to put an alarm about 3 or 4 hours before you have to get out of bed, take the micro-dose and then go back to sleep; by the time you wake up the first phase of the micro-dose (when you can feel tired) should have passed and you should be in the second phase of the micro-dose (when you feel awake and fine). <br />Maybe mescaline is a better alternative if you&#039;re looking for energy (but with the same comment as LSD regarding the first and second phase). <br />Other than that I would recommend a period of no (ab)use of any products (yep, not even coffee!) for a longer period (but as said before this has been mentioned often enough). <br /><br />@Maria Larsson: I liked your answer and share your opinion. Nicely put. Thanx<br /><br />@Rastaman: nice detail about the CBD&#039;s...good idea to mention that for pain relieve! <br /><br />@Chil: yep, coffee is 1 of those legal products that fu** you up... even when micro-dosed! :-)<br />and yep again, that book is a must-read for everyone who wants to know/understand a bit more... I think it&#039;s also a very good book to take away all the fear based on myths and urban legends about LSD; once those fears have been taken away it&#039;s much &quot;easier&quot; to use these substances... <br /><br />@GSE: I agree with what you write about a &quot;balanced diet&quot;, but the problem is that this is different for different people (ying, yang, ...) and thus not that easy to achieve...<br /><br />@Cricketplank: I&#039;d love to have your opinion on those drops... Keep us updated! <br /><br />@joeybob: I missed your little monkey! Thank you for your post...nice to have you &quot;back&quot;

				Thanks guys :)<br /><br />There seems to be a tired period with many substances for certain people.&nbsp; Many times I find myself passing out during the come up of any psychedelic, to wake up an hour or two later in a different state.&nbsp; I would suggest possibly trying a good species of white vein Kratom for energy, perhaps a Sumatran blend.&nbsp; If you keep the doses low, this should give you smooth energy and motivation for your day.&nbsp; It may leave you relaxed and sleepy towards the end of your day, which can be a good thing.&nbsp; Just be wary of tolerance, and space out use to every other day if possible.&nbsp; Kratom also has addiction potential for some, so this is another thing to keep in mind.<br /><br />Yes, there is a need for balance in all things in life, including diet.&nbsp; Sometimes it is harder to find this balance, and it will be different for everyone.&nbsp; Typically negative symptoms(physical or mental) in life are caused when there is imbalance, and it takes an open mind to see where the imbalance lies.&nbsp; This is one of the main uses of psychedelics in my opinion, as they allow you to step back and re-evaluate.<br /><br />Methoxetamine seems to loose it&#039;s magic quickly, I think this is why people raise their doses and become addicted, so just be careful if you choose to experiment with it.&nbsp; This may actually be a good thing though.&nbsp; After a day with MXE, you can take it the next day and get all the good benefits minus the overwhelming euphoria and dissociation.&nbsp; So it may be a good anti-depressant for a while to sort through things, or get you out of a rut.&nbsp; If it was done every 2-3 days, I would imagine you would stay at a very comfortable level.<br /><br />I may experiment more with Methoxetamine on a more regular schedule.&nbsp; I think the thing to do would be mix things up, so tolerance does not build up to any one thing.&nbsp; Maybe micro dose on some kind of alternating schedule with methoxetamine, 2Cs, LSD, and use Kratom here and there.&nbsp; Or maybe that&#039;s just a recipe for disaster haha.&nbsp; As long as your doses were miniscule, and time spacing everything apart I don&#039;t see any real issue.<br /><br />Taking a break every now and then is also a good thing.&nbsp; It allows the body the re-balance to it&#039;s normal state.&nbsp; After 5 years of self medicating in some way, shape, or form, that month break from everything was pretty mind blowing.&nbsp; Try it out :)

				Microdosed again today. I&#039;m still using my stash of uncerain dosage for my experiments, while I wait for some precisely (micro)dosed LSD to arrive.<br /><br />I took about a 6 week break from the experiments, so it was good to get back into it. My session today wasnt quite as productive as some of the ones I had before I took the break. This is probably due to the fact that while I was away, I put my meditation regimen on hold too. Today was really the first time I had tried to do anything like that in about a month, so I was a bit rusty, so to speak. This goes back to something I said earlier about &quot;doing the work&quot;. To get the most out of these microdosing experiments, its really important to put in the work, and not to rely on the drugs to just bring you enlightemnent. I probably would have had a better session if I had gotten a few &quot;sober&quot; meditation sessions in. But hey, there&#039;s always next time ;)<br /><br />I took my microdose a bit later in the day than I usually do. When it hit me, I was in the middle of writing some business emails. I had one of those &quot;wtf is going on&quot; confusion moments and had to put the email writing on hold (wasn&#039;t that important anyway). I got the familiar light-headed feeling and felt very sleepy about an hour in. I decided to give in to the urge to lay down since I haven&#039;t been sleeping a lot lately with this 2nd job I recenly started. So I took a nap and slept for about 2 hrs. <br /><br />When I woke up I felt really good, but a little groggy, so I had some tea to wake me up a bit. After I felt awake enough, I meditated for about 3 hours (with breaks). Like I said, I was a little rusty, and it took a while to achieve a flow state. But I was able to achieve it eventualy and got to feel the benefits of the microdose. Towards the end, I was able to really feel the superpowers. I didn&#039;t get to have them as long as in past experiments, tho, because I haven&#039;t been putting in the work.<br /><br />Another thing worth noting, is that I kept having very strong urges to smoke weed. I resisted sucessfully until about 8 hours into it, about the time the superpowers wore off. Its interesting because, while I was away, I didn&#039;t smoke weed for 2 weeks. This was the longest I&#039;ve gone in a while and I didnt really miss it all that much. There were a couple days where I had some urges, but nothing even remotely close to the urges I had today. <br /><br />There&#039;s something about LSD that just brings out the drug fiend in me. (I had a period where I (ab)used LSD pretty heavily) It reminds me of how back when I used to smoke cigarrettes, I would smoke a shit-ton more when I was taking acid. LSD would just make me chain smoke the entire time. I always attributed it to the acid-jitters and increased general nervousness, but maybe its something deeper.<br /><br />All in all it was a very positive experience today. Looking forward to experimenting further with precise dosage.<br /><br />Peace &amp; love

				Ladies and gentlemen, <br /><br />let me start my post by saying that I love this forum thead and I&#039;m very glad I met all of you here and had the opportunity to discuss the path of microdosing with you all. <br />I hope this thread will have a long life, be valuable to those who are considering subperceptual doses of psychedelics and that it&#039;ll bring mind-like people together in a constructive and positive manner... <br /><br />The start of this post may sound a bit &quot;heavy&quot;, <br />it may sound like the beginning of a &quot;goodbye&quot;...<br />and that&#039;s exactly what it is... <br /><br />For IRL reasons (that I will not detail here for obvious reasons), I will have to take some distance from SR and the forum community in a few days. No worries, nothing bad or serious happened to me nor my family or IRL friends, but this is just how it&#039;s gone be. <br /><br />I might visit the forum now and a while in the coming months, but probably just as a guest and not logged in as &quot;who I am&quot; (even if I hope I&#039;ll be able to do such now and a while!). <br /><br />Nevertheless, I&#039;m very confident that you guys will keep the level of this forum thread high (higher than most of the other pages in this forum!) and the content of the posts &quot;on topic&quot;. The support that some of you have showed to some others on this page has been a nice relieve in contrast to what could be seen on many other forum pages and I have no doubt that, when I&#039;ll come back to this forum as &quot;who I am&quot;, I will have lots of fun and interesting moments reading all your new posts! <br /><br />Do take care of yourselves and of each other. <br />Keep in mind that micro-dosing still has to be considered as experimental and thus keep your safety in mind at all times, lower doses are the key to successful microdosing, meditation and a healthy way of life are necessary to be able to achieve a real positive impact on your life when microdosing. <br /><br />Cheers, <br />R5

				Tried mahakala&#039;s 5ug blotters today. Gotta say, I&#039;m VERY happy with the results. Many thanks to mahakala for taking the time to lay custom blotters for me. Just another reason why SR is the bees knees as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />I think 5ug is a very appropriate dosage for what I&#039;m trying to do with this microdosing experiment. I&#039;d be curious to see what happens if I cut the 5ug blotter in half. But for now, 5 mics is just right.<br /><br />I got a much stronger than usual adrenaline rush when I first started to feel the LSD coming on (by usual I mean the previous batch I was microdosing with). I think this might have to do more with the quality of mahakala&#039;s acid, though. It&#039;s really hard to gauge when you take so little, but it just feels really clean to me. When I first felt the acid rush, I had a little moment of panic, like, did he dose this shit right? Am I about to fucking trip balls right now? But, yes, he did dose it right. Its just really clean acid ;D<br /><br />I still got a bit of that lightheaded feeling I described in my previous experiments, but it was definately less, and it lasted for a shorter ammount of time. Only about an hour. And it didnt really knock me out like in previous times and make me non-functional or put me to sleep. I was actually able to function very well and it was rather pleasant.<br /><br />The superpowers kicked in right after the lightheadedness faded. The height of the superpowers was right around hour 6. Some of the superpowers I experienced:<br /><br />- increased ability to focus<br />- increased ability to perform difficult taks (diffucult tasks became effortless)<br />- increased ability to multitask<br />- increased empathy<br />- abilty to reach a flow state faster<br />- ability to see &quot;the bigger picture&quot; <br />- heightened sense of oneness with the universe <br /><br />All in all this was a really positive experience. The microdose put me in a really good mood. I also felt really good, physically speaking, after the lightheadedness wore off. And the superpowers lasted longer than ever before, so I&#039;m stoked about that. <br /><br />Seriously, I feel like Superman right now. I fucking love LSD!<br /><br />I will definatelty be doing this again soon. I&#039;m still not sure about an optimal microdosing schedule, but I&#039;m thinking once a week for now, to give my brain some time to detox.<br /><br />Much love to all

Gotta say, I&#039;m VERY happy with the results. Many thanks to mahakala for taking the time to lay custom blotters for me. Just another reason why SR is the bees knees as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />I think 5ug is a very appropriate dosage for what I&#039;m trying to do with this microdosing experiment. I&#039;d be curious to see what happens if I cut the 5ug blotter in half. But for now, 5 mics is just right.<br /><br />I got a much stronger than usual adrenaline rush when I first started to feel the LSD coming on (by usual I mean the previous batch I was microdosing with). I think this might have to do more with the quality of mahakala&#039;s acid, though. It&#039;s really hard to gauge when you take so little, but it just feels really clean to me. When I first felt the acid rush, I had a little moment of panic, like, did he dose this shit right? Am I about to fucking trip balls right now? But, yes, he did dose it right. Its just really clean acid ;D<br /><br />I still got a bit of that lightheaded feeling I described in my previous experiments, but it was definately less, and it lasted for a shorter ammount of time. Only about an hour. And it didnt really knock me out like in previous times and make me non-functional or put me to sleep. I was actually able to function very well and it was rather pleasant.<br /><br />The superpowers kicked in right after the lightheadedness faded. The height of the superpowers was right around hour 6. Some of the superpowers I experienced:<br /><br />- increased ability to focus<br />- increased ability to perform difficult taks (diffucult tasks became effortless)<br />- increased ability to multitask<br />- increased empathy<br />- abilty to reach a flow state faster<br />- ability to see &quot;the bigger picture&quot; <br />- heightened sense of oneness with the universe <br /><br />All in all this was a really positive experience. The microdose put me in a really good mood. I also felt really good, physically speaking, after the lightheadedness wore off. And the superpowers lasted longer than ever before, so I&#039;m stoked about that. <br /><br />Seriously, I feel like Superman right now. I fucking love LSD!<br /><br />I will definitely be doing this again soon. I&#039;m still not sure about an optimal microdosing schedule, but I&#039;m thinking once a week for now, to give my brain some time to detox.<br /><br />Much love to all!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Amazing post man - seriously really top notch shit brother!<br />You have my Karma, but you definitely deserve more than just mine.<br /><br />:P<br /><br />&lt;3 Vanquish

You just don&#039;t use ruler as measuring but for supporting pressure on blotter while cutting it up and trust your eyes much as you can. Luckily I&#039;m pretty pedantic on these things. The only big minus is that for 20 it&#039;s 4x5 not 4x4 which is much easier to measure only by eyes and at these standards like blotters are. <br />Anyway, if you ever have the possibility to sell same acid which is on Dalai Lamas on micro-dose blotters too then give it a go please. <br /><br />I should add to my last post that the second time I micro-dosed was yesterday. Both times I&#039;ve micro-dosed the day after has been sleepy and today also tiring. It has been said earlier in this thread that if you micro-dose you should be sure that you can sleep as much as you feel you need to for the next day. Micro-dosing requires much energy and it&#039;s far better to adapt with healthy lifestyle.

				Welcome back Fartbomber :) <br />I got some 100ug blotter that I hope to be splitting soon and I think I will be trying the same as you Dazarius. Twice a week but with 10ug instead. (don&#039;t think my cutting skills are the same as yours ;)) Whats a good time frame to microdose ? 2 - 4 weeks ? You wrote that your gonna do it for a month before a break.

				I really don&#039;t know how it works out to take it twice a week for a month. It&#039;s why I&#039;m going to experiment. From this thread I&#039;ve read that no one really knows is it sensible to make longer &quot;treatments&quot; than a 2-3 weeks at once. There is not much information about many aspects about micro-dosing but we are here to make it change I hope. <br /><br />I&#039;ve started my journal but as English isn&#039;t my native language it&#039;s hard to write it directly to here.&nbsp; If I come to conclusions how acid treatment affected my everyday life I&#039;m going to translate it for forums too.<br /><br />Good luck with micro-dosing!

For example, is the microdosing helping you achieve what you wanted (increased creativity, focus, etc), and have you achieved it yet? But also remember to take breaks. At least, that&#039;s how I&#039;m approaching it ;D<br />

				@ Rastaman - I think I will try a couple of weeks and see how that goes. The short amounts of acid I have done recently have definitely affected me in a positive way. Thinking clearer, appreciating things more and generally being more decisive. I need to get a little more planning and structure into it though :)

				@DrWalterB: Great to hear about the positive benfits. I find that with structure and purpose, I have been able to get the most out of my microdosing experiments<br /><br />@ Everyone, I posted a question about potential harmful effects of microdosing LSD on the DoctorX thread. I am reposting his response:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1543956#msg1543956">Quote from: DoctorX on September 17, 2013, 07:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1540723#msg1540723">Quote from: Rastaman Vibration on September 16, 2013, 03:32 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Hi Doctor,<br /><br />What are the harmful effects, if any, of taking small doses of LSD on a fairly regular basis? I have been experimenting with doses of less that 15 micrograms. I am currently taking 5 micrograms once a week. Is this harmful in any way? Would it be harmful to take 5 micrograms of LSD more frequently, such as 3 times a week?<br /><br />Thank you for your time<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Toxicity of LSD to human organ or systems is extremely low. Threshold is 20 micrograms, so 5 micrograms will not have probably noticeable effects. LSD causes pharmacological tolerance very quickly. This can be noticeable even once a week, so three times a week will cause that possible subtle effects will dissapear if not increasing dosage. With these pattern of use&nbsp; toxic effects are not expected, but neither biological activity.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good news there! Score another point for LSD! Such an am azing chemical, opens doors to other dimensions, and its rather harmless. Everyone wins! ;D<br /><br />Peace &amp; love

				Hi All,<br /><br />I thought you might be interested in a little micro dosing regime I am going to try out. I need to be super focused on work as I am in the middle of a technology company start up.<br /><br />So I am dosing 30mg of mescaline every two days. And using benzos to get sleep no more than three times a week. And I will avoid using mescaline on the weekends.I will try to use cannabis to sleep over benzos. But the aim is to get some good nights sleep two or three times a week. Go to bed super early on the weekends using benzos, and avoiding weekend work. Sticking to leisure reading and puzzle/story based video games. Oh and I will dose early in the day aiming for 7.00 am every day followed right by a meditation.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also do yoga at least every other day for 40 mins, and meditate every morning for 20 mins using guided meditation. I&#039;ll watch my diet and stick to water, fresh vegetables, I don&#039;t eat meat anyway. But I will eat fish at least twice a week. And avoid sugar as much as I can. Caffeine is also banned. <br /><br />I will do this for about two weeks and then stop. And see how long any new habits stay in place. I will keep a diary online here to monitor myself and use your peer pressure to get me to stick with it.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Day one is tomorrow, then I will dose on Friday and skip the weekend to dose on Monday. <br /><br /><br />

				Hurray<br />Tried my first microdose of LightofPi&#039;s liquid. He tells me its a little under 6ug a drop.<br /><br />Took it in the morning with a juice before any coffee or anything. I get up at 7, and it is not unusual for me to try and get a nap around 11-12, and I definitely needed it this time. This might add to the point that microdoses encourage you to go and meditate or take a nap, we&#039;ll see.<br /><br />I mentioned on a different thread a side effect when I smoke marijuana of a fuzziness in my brain which is annoying, almost like a toxic residue or something. This disappeared after taking the microdose, which helps me to think that LSD has a clearing, detoxifying effect. However, it came back that night and has stayed with me since, would have considered microdosing the next day but wanted to do the 3 day thing for now at least.<br />Felt clear, happy and energetic for pretty much the rest of the day, very positive experience all in all.<br /><br />Look forward to trying again, possibly tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />So things to note with LSD<br /><br />- initial period of clarity<br />- period of tiredness/needing a nap<br />- enter superpowers for a few hours<br />- no post/side-effects noted, quite clear and pleasant.<br />- emotional issues definitely come to the front, MUCH happier with 5ug dose than with 11/12ug dose I had done before<br /><br />Hip, Cool and groooooooovy

				So day one - I will be short and too the point.<br /><br />Previous night sleep: 4 hours<br />Dose: 30mg mescaline taken at 07:00 + two bowls of weed in the evening<br /><br />I didn&#039;t have a lot of sleep the night before because of work commitments. I woke up tired and no energy and I had a difficult day ahead. <br /><br />I dropped 30mg at 0700 and did 30 minutes of meditation. After about an hour I felt awake and the fog of tiredness had lifted. There was some slight euphoria and brighter colours. I was very productive all day. Working in an open office, I remained focused on my work all day.<br /><br />I also interacted well with other people, and held a smile on my face all day. Now I am still working but very tired due to lack of sleep. I need to work for another couple of hours but feel able to and I know I will be able to sleep well tonight. I need to do a lot of writing, but even though I am tired I still can complete my work and write well.<br /><br />Tomorrow if an off day, and back on a dose on Friday.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Great to hear about your microdosing experiments, cricketplank and flyhigh1660. I have been terribly busy with RL lately, so I wasn&#039;t able to journal about my microdosing experience last week. I plan on doing it again tomorrow, and hopefully I will get some downtime to post about it.<br /><br />@ cricketplank, very interesting that the microdose made you sleepy as well and that you took a nap. I also had this experience, especially when I hadn&#039;t been sleeping enough. Anyone else had this happen? <br /><br />Much love!

				Day two<br /><br />No Dose this day. Had about 7 hours sleeps. Did some exercises when I got up. Meditated and then got on with some work.Hard deadline at midday. I still felt highly focused and clear headed. Also my mood was elevated, happy and no anxiety. <br /><br />I had a good productive day then spent the evening, watching the big bang theory and got stoned. At bed time I dropped a benzo and had a good 9 hours of sleep.<br /><br />Day three starts now, dropped 30 mg of mescaline already.<br /><br />Peace

				Microdosed today with one of mahakala&#039;s 5ug tabs. I did&#039;t get much sleep the night before, maybe 4 or so hours. I debated whether or not to take the dose today, but decided to just eat it. i had kind of a busy day, so I couldn&#039;t take a nap, even though I did want one. The dose made me a little sleepy, I&#039;m pretty sure, right after the initial rush. <br /><br />Well I didn&#039;t nap, but I got so much done! I had a very productive day. I was able to multitask very effectively and I still can&#039;t believe how much I was able to do.<br /><br />I was also very social. I had some great moments over the phone while I was handling business. And when I finished up all the business, I hung with some friends and had a nice smoke out session ;) I was the life of the party!<br /><br />Some other noteworthy things<br />- increased creativity<br />- increased focus<br />- increased clarity<br />- ability to see the big picture<br />- visions of the future<br />- SUPERPOWERS!!<br /><br />It was a really great day, and I realy enjoyed it, even with the sleep deprivation from the night before.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been microdosing since July now. I did one month on, one off, and now its been another full month of dosing. I will post some more general observations I&#039;ve made throughout the course of this experiment in a few days, when I get a little more time. <br /><br />Peace &amp; love!

				Micro-dosed LSD for the first time last weekend.<br /><br />Took 1/9th of an Albert Hofmann Blotter (~110µ) from HollandOnline - Dose: ~12µ - at 6pm<br /><br />Went to a small concert later that evening. Didn&#039;t drink, didn&#039;t smoke weed (haven&#039;t smoked for a week). Definitely felt some rush from the small dose. I was good in socializing. One friend noticed that I kinda looked spaced out but nothing more. Scored some haze at the venue which I smoked (strong, but not cured) there. I smoked one pure joint alone (usually I&#039;m a daily smoker) and became very high. Couldn&#039;t sleep easily later that night because of introspective effects of the LSD and felt some warmth from the LSD. Felt asleep around 5am)<br /><br />I guess my dose was a little bit above the desired micro-dose maximum effect, especially because of the weed. I couldn&#039;t imagine doing that dose and smoking weed at the same time on following days but overall it was a positive and interesting experience with a nice afterglow.<br /><br />When the time is right I will try to experiment with lower doses.

				Day Three (Friday)<br /><br />30mg dose mescaline taken at 0700<br /><br />Overall: I took a benzo the night before to get some good sleep. After dropping the dose, I got on with some work. Work in the morning went quickly and I managed to get quite a bit done. Again I was focused and felt happy.<br /><br />I had to go drive to family in the afternoon. That was a bit of a pain, sitting in the car didn&#039;t feel productive, I wanted to be back in the office working. It felt like wasted time, and I felt restless and constant thought loops. Despite this my mood was still elevated, just I would have rather been more active doing something am little more productive.<br /><br />I drove back late that evening with a headache. Smoked some weed and went to bed. <br /><br />Day four in the next post.

				Day Four (Saturday)<br /><br />No dose today. <br /><br />Rubbish sleep the night before, I ended up with a headache and smoking weed before bed was a bad idea.<br /><br />But after getting up I felt great. I noticed on the off dose days i actually feel better than the dose days. Less thought loops, but still feel productive and motivated.<br /><br />I even notice that I have a small smile on my face. I just feel happy about life rather than stressed. Even though I have quite a few worries at the moment. <br /><br />I spent the day out and met old friends who I hadn&#039;t seen in years. <br /><br />Generally a good day.

I need to be super focused on work as I am in the middle of a technology company start up.<br /><br />So I am dosing 30mg of mescaline every two days. And using benzos to get sleep no more than three times a week. And I will avoid using mescaline on the weekends.I will try to use cannabis to sleep over benzos. But the aim is to get some good nights sleep two or three times a week. Go to bed super early on the weekends using benzos, and avoiding weekend work. Sticking to leisure reading and puzzle/story based video games. Oh and I will dose early in the day aiming for 7.00 am every day followed right by a meditation.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also do yoga at least every other day for 40 mins, and meditate every morning for 20 mins using guided meditation. I&#039;ll watch my diet and stick to water, fresh vegetables, I don&#039;t eat meat anyway. But I will eat fish at least twice a week. And avoid sugar as much as I can. Caffeine is also banned. <br /><br />I will do this for about two weeks and then stop. And see how long any new habits stay in place. I will keep a diary online here to monitor myself and use your peer pressure to get me to stick with it.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Day one is tomorrow, then I will dose on Friday and skip the weekend to dose on Monday.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good luck flyinghigh1660, I have only recently tried Xanax for the first time and found I got great sleep but was totally out of it the following day, what benzos are you using can I ask? Look forward to hearing about mescal microdose - have you read anythign about long diets done by Huichol native americans or anything like that? maybe certain tribes used to eat it over periods of weeks as a spiritual/cleansing supplement.<br /><br />Look forward to hearing you reports<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey man,<br /><br />Sorry I missed your question. I use Etizolam, I find it not some bad in the mornings. A little slow but once up and showered I feel fine. You get a really good night&#039;s sleep. I take no more than three in a week and avoid it on Friday and Saturday. I&#039;ll take one Sunday to start the working week on a good nights sleep. <br /><br />Mix with weed&nbsp; and you are wiped out in the morning.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Dr Greenfingers is the vender http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2514d8497b<br /><br />

You are dosing 3x a week, correct?<br /><br />I have been doing it (once) weekly, and the day after my dose I also have been feeling very good (today especially). Improved focus, clarity, creativity. <br /><br />Do keep us posted on your experiments, especially if the next day afterglow feeling persists, increases, or decreases over time. I had such a good day today, that I&#039;m wondering whether the next day afterglow might be getting stonger ater a month of dosing, or if today was just a fluke.

				Im just popping in to advertise a bit for my colleague Kittenhuffer who&#039;s bussiness has been slow lately (most likely due to everyone buying my Dalai Lama&#039;s for their high dose) but I was thinking that the people who microdose would have a demand for lower dosed but very high quality and evenly laid tabs. His microgram price is around 6$ cents if you buy a 10 strip which is imho pretty good. Here is his profile:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f6371738b0<br /><br />Good luck microdosing to every one, im very glad there is finally some good real life documentation on this, im tempted to join you guys soon!

				I can definitely vouch for Kittenhuffer to. I have purchased a few times from him and has been quality acid everytime. His strawberries were awesome. He has great customer service and answers any questions you throw at him.<br />Haven&#039;t had the chance to try his Dancing Bears yet, but I know I am going to. Like Fartbomber says, these would be easier to split for microdosing.<br /><br />FYI, I noticed he has just put his prices down again 8) definitely worth trying.<br />

				Day Five (Sunday)<br /><br />No dose today.<br /><br />Great day - really warm afterglow present. In the morning I help my daughter with her home work. Then we decided to travel to a large park for a walk.<br /><br />The sun was shining and being outdoors felt great. Everything had the sharpness that mescaline provides. I had a smile on my face, and felt everything was right with the world. I had an excellent day out with my daughter and we went exploring the park and woods together. I find smoking weed improves the mental clarity and I don;t feel stone. And I can focus more on what I am doing and be involved in it.<br /><br />My daughter is between 10 and 16, (don&#039;t want to give any personal details away). And we have had discussions about drugs already, and we saw some mushrooms and I explained magic mushrooms and psychedelics to her. I try to have an open approach to drugs and what I use. Knowing that she will one day come into contact with these things. And I want to make sure she talks to me about it.<br /><br />A good day, the afterglow is definitely there, and seems to improve after the initial dose. <br /><br />FH<br /><br />

				Day six (Monday)<br /><br />30mg dose taken at 0700.<br /><br />After a slow start, I started to feel energized. I started by writing down what is happening in the next week. And what I will achieve for work. From this I broke down my tasks and then got started on the list.<br />I&#039;ve never done this before but it seemed a really good way to make sure I deliver some output.<br /><br />I completed a load of work today. Finishing one task completely before moving onto the next one. Many times I flit between tasks because I get easily bored. Lunch time came quite quickly, and I forced myself to stop and watch TV for an hour then I got back into work. By five I stopped in the knowledge that I had done enough today and will reach my targets for the week.<br /><br />Roll on tomorrow.<br /><br />FH<br /><br />

Threshold is 20 micrograms, so 5 micrograms will not have probably noticeable effects. LSD causes pharmacological tolerance very quickly. This can be noticeable even once a week, so three times a week will cause that possible subtle effects will dissapear if not increasing dosage. With these pattern of use&nbsp; toxic effects are not expected, but neither biological activity.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Let me know if this is a wrong line of thought. Average trip 200ug needs at least 14 days for you to restore tolerance. But with less amount wouldn&#039;t you also need less time for that? So if I take 10ug that&#039;s 5% then I would need only 5% of the restoring time, that is 0.75 days. According to this logic only 1 day after that dosage will be more than plenty to recuperate and don&#039;t build tolerance. And if you take even lower amount, let&#039;s say 5ug or 2.5% that&#039;s 0.375 days of recovery time, so if you take it at the morning, for example 8:00 AM, next morning at the same hour you will be more than recovered, so you could take 5ug all week. This will require testing and I guess is variable to each individual.<br /><br />I&#039;m very interested in this.
