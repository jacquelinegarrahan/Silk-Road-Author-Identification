				i&#039;ve heard of a lot of different ways people try to prepare the new OP formulas for insufflating and thought i&#039;d share my experiences for those who are interested so they don&#039;t waste their time/money or hurt themselves (or their microwaves).<br /><br />i&#039;ve tried a few methods and found the following to be the best as it is WAY more consistent than using a microwave, since microwaves are of differing power outputs and are only really good at heating water-based things. THOUGH it destroys some of the oxycodone in the process, what&#039;s left hits right away like grinding up the original OCs. I&#039;d estimate I have to use about 1.5x as much with this method and the OPs to get the same high as with grinding up the OCs. that being said, if you want to get the most out of them, just swallow them (before or after cutting or grinding).<br /><br />1. preheat oven to 350F (turn on convection if available)<br />2. grind up pill using Ped Egg (or dremel file) onto a glass plate (needle-nose pliers help to hold pill), spreading out as much as possible, and push bits that are off the corner of the plate toward the middle with a card. the goal is an even spread of shavings on the flat part of the plate. You can use 1/4 pill, 1/2 pill, or however much you want. no need to remove coating, though you can if you want (pain in the ass, though).<br />3. once oven is heated up put plate in oven and turn on oven light so you can get a good look (or use a good flashlight). depending on plate size and type, whether you use convection, and amount of pill used this should take between 3 and 6 minutes or so, but as soon as some of the shavings start to melt into clear droplets (about 25% of them, and it starts to go quickly so be vigilant) take the plate out of the oven and...<br />4. put it immediately into the freezer. let everything cool down but not too much. the freezer step is complete when the edges of the plate are cool but the middle (bottom) will still be slightly warm or room temperature, about 10 minutes for my 12&quot; glass plate. check it periodically. if you cool it too much then when you pull it out water will condense on it and make the shavings mushy, too little and the shavings will still be gooey and the plate too warm. just right though and they will have hardened nicely, though some shavings will remain their original flaky white (as described in step 3). ideally there will be a little condensation on the edges but not the middle where the shavings are.<br />5. let plate reach room temperature and any condensation evaporate, and then use a razor to scrape shavings into piles and insufflate.<br /><br />if you do this several times and repeat the process exactly, the times needed for each step should be extremely consistent.<br /><br />i have done this dozens of times and it works great (much better than microwave). it somehow destroys much of the time release. i am not taking OCs anymore, though, so i cannot post any pictures. y&#039;all hopefully know the risks of addiction.

				I haven&#039;t tried to insufflate an OP. Too lazy i guess ;)&nbsp; I usually just throw whatever i need in a small glass, add a little of my favorite soft drink, come back in 30-45 min and drink it down.&nbsp; I get decent results from that.<br />

				is the white stuff inside of the time release layer bad for you?<br /><br />people here love their oxys and whenever we would snort them, we&#039;d just put one in water for a minute, take it out, rub all the time release off with a paper towel, crush and snort. it always fucked us up good.<br /><br />im not too informed about this kind of thing, so excuse me ignorance(if any) but i do like the buzz you get from oxy&#039;s and have been considering ordering one

				ever since they changed the formulation and basically put the active ingredients inside edible plastic it&#039;s not quite as easy as it used to be. <br />I will give it a go here pretty soon and post findings.

				well i know that you dont want to wet the inside. <br /><br />we would just let the water loosen up the outside of the pill. then rub it clean. we never lost any weight this way.<br /><br />is there something that i am missing?<br /><br /><br />the ones we used were 80mg time release OP&#039;s <br /><br />same ones that we&#039;re talking about in this thread right?

				does anyone know if the oven/freezer method of prep works for opanas? or is that totally unnecessary? or is there a better way to prepare those for insufflation?

				My friend says this&nbsp; is the Best and quickest way. I don&#039;t recommend taking medications not prescribed to you or taking them in a way that is different than intended.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />1 - Take the coating off<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The simplest way I&#039;ve found so far is to use a shaving-type razor to take the coating off. Very lightly run the razor somewhat parallel with the portion of the pill you&#039;re cutting. If you mess up and manage to take a piece of the pill off with the coating, you can kind-of dig it out with the razor.<br /><br />2 - Grinding the pill<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There have been several methods suggested for grinding the new OPs. They&#039;ve ranged from sanding blocks, pedicure eggs, cheese graters, and even Dremels. With this method of crisping, you want the product to be as fine as possible. We&#039;re talking powder here. Anything substantially bigger in size will lead to uneven heating and a burnt product. A Dremel with a sanding attachment works very well for this task. If you can&#039;t get a dremel, I&#039;d try for a pedi-egg as other members seem to have good results with them. With a Dremel, try to grind the pill in a container so you don&#039;t lose any product. When you&#039;re finished, place the ground OP on a piece of folded paper and then let it slide into a DRY spoon.<br /><br />3 - Crisping the product<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Now&#039;s the time for the hard part. When the powder is in the spoon, try to spread it out with a paperclip or a toothpick over an area taking up around 3/5ths to 3/4ths of the spoon. Now, lightly tap the edges of the spoon so the powder distributes evenly. We want as thin of a layer as possible. With a lighter, begin heating the spoon, distributing the flame evenly under the layer of product. When you start to see vapor rising from the product, you now know it&#039;s time to move the flame a bit away from the spoon to prevent burning. At first, you&#039;ll start to see patches of the powder turn from white to an off-white color. We&#039;re aiming for a light yellow/off-white color-- dark yellow or brown means you&#039;ve heated the product too much. When it&#039;s white and glassy, you&#039;ll know it&#039;s perfect. When a portion of the powder turns the desired color, immediately move the flame from that area to an area that hasn&#039;t yet turn the color. Once everything is a nice yellow color, you can begin to blow on it to try and cool it down, but only if you&#039;re snorting or eating it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Please note that it takes time to perfect the heating portion of this method. If you&#039;re careful and vigilant, you&#039;ll get it on the first time.<br /><br />4 - Preparation of the product<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Insufflation - Scrape the spoon with a knife, collecting the oxy, and blow on the product to cool it. It should turn fairly brittle, but not brittle enough to break up with a card. If you have talcum powder, or even another snortable pill to mix with it, mix the powder with the product at an eyeballed 1:1 ratio with a thin metal object on a plate. Then, flatten the resultant product whilst on the plate. If the product doesn&#039;t seem to be sticky, you&#039;re ready to chop and go. If that isn&#039;t the case, place the plate in the freezer for 5 minutes or more. It&#039;ll be ready when you try to break the flattened product and it cracks rather than gives. Crush, snort, and enjoy!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Oral - Probably the easiest of all ingestion methods. Simply scrape the product with a knife, blow on it to cool, swallow, and enjoy your IR high! <br /><br />

				You don&#039;t need to do any prep for the Opana ERs besides grind/crush and then snort.&nbsp; I might try what nomad suggested for the OPs since they go for like $20 or less around here.

				honestly the roxi&#039;s are way easier and yield better highs than the OPs, though you&#039;ll be paying a bit more /mg, obviously.
