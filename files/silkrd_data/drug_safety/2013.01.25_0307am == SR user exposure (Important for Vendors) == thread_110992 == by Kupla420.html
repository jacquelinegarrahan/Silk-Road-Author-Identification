				So as of a few days ago I started hearing a lot of non users know of this website which is making it seem like people are talking too much. Then today I decided to do a search and find how much worse it&#039;s getting around and what do you know, all over Tumblr there are a shit load of teenagers tagging pictures they took of the silk road home page or their favorite drug page and tagging it as Silk Road. So not only is that one of the dumbest decisions that I&#039;ve seen but these kids are stupid enough to actually be posting this on their accounts they are actively using. Clearly these kids don&#039;t realize that just cause you have Tor on your computer doesn&#039;t mean your normal web browser IP address isn&#039;t changed too and their admitting on their account that they are users and then they have questions all over their page of people asking on how to get on here. Then as an even dumber move some of them have even followed up by sending them tutorials on how to get on here.<br /><br />Is there anything that we can possibly do to keep these kids from getting on this site and just spreading the word all over the internet and giving other kids tutorials on how to get on to this site? Seeing that is just making me feel way to sketchy about this site. If they got busted, some kid isn&#039;t going to think twice about letting LE into their account, putting their vendors at risk. And if you read this and you are one of those kids, you need to take that shit off your Tumblr immediately before you&#039;re crying to your parents to pick you up from the police station. Think before you do stupid shit like exposing all over the internet that you&#039;re buying illegal things on the internet. This website isn&#039;t part of your little &quot;YOLO&quot; bull shit. You&#039;re even more of a dumb ass if you&#039;re using the same username on both here and Tumblr. I&#039;m pretty tempted to actually start checking if names match so we can figure out which of you are blabbing so vendors don&#039;t keep selling to you and having themselves at risk.

				Geez thats stupid. People post videos of themselves beating each other up,&nbsp; committing acts of vandalism and theft. Then are shocked when LE knocks at the door. <br /><br />It could no doubt cause themselves no end of misery. <br /><br />How much of a threat is this to vendors. All LE has to do is log on to the site to see the same pictures the people are posting or just order off the site and arrange busts.&nbsp; <br /><br />If it was that easy SR would have been shut down long ago. <br /><br />It isn&#039;t that easy. While the idiots posting on f- book are not anonymous this site is. <br /><br />Do you think the vendors would be that easy to trace? <br /><br />The only people they screwed was themselves. They can kiss that school or choice job they wanted goodbye. Great to be cool? umm maybe not so much....

				I think its an interesting topic about kids ability to use this site. Ultimatley, I believe its a parents job to monitor what their kids do. The drugs that kids do are just as illegal as adults do. The best thing for them is education.. Also for those who post the stuff, see if they are stupid enough to leave their name on it and report them.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Like &quot;kingelleoman&quot; did...<br /><br />Clearnet site:<br /><br />http://kingelloman.tumblr.com/image/27252215321

				I&#039;ve seen this on regular forums.<br />Not even in the private sections.<br />Kids/young people trying to get conversations started about buying on SR,methods,packaging.<br /><br />When you see something like this you should intervene and ask for threads of this nature to be removed.<br />That what i did.<br />In case the admin is not someone sympathetic to the cause you can always use the fact that it is a discussion about illegal contraband as an excuse ;D.

				It is a sad thing that so much taxation is taken from the taxpayers, and the police and alphabet soup agencies are so utterly incompetent, bungling, and foolish, that this massive exposure is publicly posted in clearnet, and the &quot;authorities&quot; do nothing about any of it.<br /><br />It makes me wonder if I&#039;m overly paranoid.<br /><br />Also, how old are these tumblr users, 12??

				I know that this goes in the face of everything some people think SR is about.. but scary things like this make me wish that there was someway to restrict the droves of casual tourists who swing through and register on the site, make an order, and endanger every-ones safety with their stupidity. Impossible I know, but still...

				The best option is for the government to give proper education to children rather than scare tactics. In high school my friends had a course to teach them about sex, drugs and other dangerous roads one can go down early in life. For some reason my program just got to colour and discuss careers, guess they didn&#039;t think we were prone to drug use and making bad choices. My friends were not given scare tactics but told to do actual research on drugs by themselves and present to their class. They came to conclusions such as LSD is relatively harmless versus meth is highly addictive and can have serious side affects. Proper education does wonders, just look at the Netherlands.<br /><br />Where I grew up drugs were everywhere. It would have been infinitely easier for me to buy them after school from other kids or down at the city center, than to buy online. <br /><br />There is not much that can be done about exposure. If kids are the worry, it is up to their parents to keep enough of an eye on them. If my child got an odd business like letter in the mail, we would definitely be having a conversation.<br /><br />Just because people know about SR does not mean they will use it. There is some technical competency required, bitcoins needs to be purchased, the individual needs to be less-than-law-abiding and also not overly paranoid.<br /><br />I think it has been said a million times. Your biggest worry should be receiving packages. That is all you have control over. You cannot choose who else finds or uses this website.

Anyhow, a good parent will soon see that his/her kid is using narcotics (come on! like if you&#039;d not notice your 13 year old daughter toke some K? WTF), then the parents can still fulfill their role as parents...<br /><br />You could build in a &quot;waiting list&quot; for SR, so that buyers would have to &quot;apply&quot; and then wait a few days, weeks or even months - that might turn down some younger (and totally not patient) potential buyers, but I&#039;m not sure in the long run it would make much of a difference...still, it might be a good idea, just to try to discourage the impatient new buyers to walk this Road.&nbsp;

				I fail to see how &quot;some kid&quot; giving LE access to their account puts vendors at risk. What are they going to do, tell the LE were they are based and to come on around and get some cheap drugs. I doubt it. And if any LE wanted an account they would just create one themselves and order the drugs themselves if they want to see what the packaging is like.

				The shit with the kids is stupid to say the least.&nbsp; I kinda look at it like thinning the herd. There will always be dangers from outside exposure but if you&#039;re running a tight ship it should be of little concern. <br /><br />As for the username thing there was a post I remember reading a while ago about someone who was randomly picking forum names and searching them on Google to see what came up. Results were interesting to say the least. Lots of them linking up to lots more info.&nbsp; Now sure, that&#039;s a pretty loose connection but there were a few that were easily linked to a SR account.&nbsp; All of this further stresses the point that when you create your SR account NO relevant information that you have ever used on the clearnet should be used here.&nbsp; When it comes to security sometimes the smallest and most meaningless things are the easiest overlooked.

				when senators are calling the attorney general of the U.S. to shut it down its safe to say all LE departments or agencies are already all over it, the kids talking doesn&#039;t do any good but i doubt this place is any secret to the DEA, FBI or other law enforcement agencies

				As soon as a large group of people know about something odds are they are going to tell a friend who tells and friend and so on... The site is exciting, the first time you logged on and saw TSR you get that buzz of &#039;oh shit i can&#039;t believe i&#039;ve just found this&#039;. Its been all over the news for years just read this article its hilarious:<br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2235199/The-eBay-drugs-Silk-Road-website-allows-drug-users-buy-heroin-cannabis-mail-order-world.html<br /><br />&quot;This cocaine was also for sale on Silk Road which is using complicated software to allow people to buy and sell anonymously&quot;<br />&quot;Sussex police welcomes any intelligence with regard to the supply of illicit drugs, which are a constant threat to our community&quot;<br /><br />The thing is SR is a huge growing community, and on top of that keeps turning the cogs of the bit coin. Vendors have nothing to worry about if they do their job properly, the only people that need to worry are the buyers as they are the ones who have their names and addresses on the package being delivered to them.<br /><br />

				LE already know about the site - it wont be doing much in terms of the sites security, maybe the little faggots who post the shit will get caught but it&#039;ll not do much to me as a vendor.<br /><br />It&#039;ll be their own fault if they get caught and fuck up their whole life plan because they have some kind of drug charge.<br /><br />Like someone said before - &quot;the cat is out of the bag&quot;. <br /><br />Loads of people know about this place - and the LE will be trying to shut it down. But, in terms of the drug world, we are nothing. Okay, a few mill goes through here every year but if you were to take a look at the labs producing the drugs, the cocaine cartels, drug gangs - some of these places see a few mill in a week.<br /><br />Hell, the cocaine cartels are shipping tonnes of the stuff around the world a day.<br /><br />So, yes the LE are watching us, and are probably trying to shut this place down.. But, we definitely are not their top priority.<br /><br />At least nobody gets stabbed or shot trying to buy drugs on here.

				Hey everybody sorry for such the late response on my own post but I haven&#039;t been on in about 5 days so I&#039;ll do my best to respond to all of you in this message. I do appreciate everyone&#039;s views and your input. Everyone made a lot of good points.<br /><br />As for it being on the clearnet and already known of by LE, yes I do understand this but I still feel that for everyone&#039;s safety it&#039;s still best if this site is being spread around as little as possible.<br /><br />As for the question on the age of the Tumblr users I seen, all the one&#039;s I had seen on that site couldn&#039;t have been any older than 17 at most and that&#039;s being generous. These kids look like, well... KIDS. Not trying to be a prick just cause it pisses me off but they seriously just look like kids that are barely into their teen years.<br /><br />As for the bitcoins, I have no clue how they could be making the money transfer at their age but it&#039;s pretty clear with their pictures they posted that they are. I&#039;m sure you all have noticed that it&#039;s gotten a lot easier for kids these days to get nearly anything they want and more than half the parents just say screw it and give their kids the money for them to use as they please. The methods they use, I can&#039;t even tell, but with how things are these days I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s too difficult for them.<br /><br />And lastly for the screen names. If you all would like I would be more than happy to completely just search up and down Tumblr for the kids that are stupid enough to post their screen name on SR in the picture and I will post both the Tumblr and the SR screen names on here for you guys if you&#039;d like. I did see 2 that were stupid enough for that when I was on my quick search through but if you guys would like to know (especially for vendor&#039;s knowledge) I will look through and tell you guys all of the names I can find.<br /><br />Oh and also for the person saying I should say something to them, I did make a BS account real quick and I sent a message to 2 or 3 of the people who had the most idiot posts up there. And the order delay I think would be a great idea cause kids would much rather search for drugs in person than have to not only wait for the mail but have to wait before they can even make their order.<br /><br />If you have any more suggestions on how to interact with them on there or if you want me to screen name search, let me know and I&#039;ll get it done. Thanks again for the time and feedback.
