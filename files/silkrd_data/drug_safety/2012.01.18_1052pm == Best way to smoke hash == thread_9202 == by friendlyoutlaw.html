				Ok, I have a bunch of hash coming in soon. Given the excellent reviews of the hash and the fact that it&#039;s somehow cheaper than straight bud, I decided to give it a go for a week.<br /><br />I have limited experience with hash...in the past, I&#039;ve just mixed it in with weed, or tossed a hunk into a glass bowl.<br /><br />I have a volcano...will that produce enough heat to properly deal with pressed hash?<br /><br />Or if I&#039;m better off smoking it, should I get a different type of bowl? I know that sounds like a retarded question but I&#039;ve always wondered if a &quot;hash pipe&quot; was somehow different than every other bowl I&#039;ve owned over my lifetime.

				Depends on the type of hash. some you can vape, some you cant. <br /><br />I stick with flowers, cuz the hash is always different, and unpredictable. Plus the fact that the first &#039;hash&#039; I ever bought was I beleive sawdust and honey kinda turned me off,lol

				i&#039;ve been smoking just hash for a month now.&nbsp; i&#039;ve found a well screened bowl and a lighter held as far as possible (no direct flame) works well.&nbsp; the hash should smoke and sizzle a bit from the invisible tendrils of delicious heat.&nbsp; some hash expands in the lungs, you feel it after you inhale not during.&nbsp; some almost makes vapor, like a vaporizer, and you&#039;re like &quot;that wasn&#039;t a hit!&quot; and then WHAM.&nbsp; <br />i&#039;ve had christy&#039;s hash too and also pressed some.&nbsp; pressed stuff you get more hits out of.<br /><br />*destiny*

				You don&#039;t need a hash pipe, don&#039;t bother with it unless you get hash boners. <br /><br />Take some knife hits; not going into detail. Google it on clearnet.<br /><br />Pack a bowl of weed, put hash on top. Leave enough room for however much hash you want to use... obviously.<br /><br />Roll a J with hash+weed.<br /><br />Vape it.

				The Volcano might work- the key is breaking it up really, really small- like grains of sand. FWIW, I&#039;ve had good luck vaping hash in a SSV, not so good luck w/ a PD or a MFLB (powdery keef hash works ok in the latter two, black rock hash doesn&#039;t, IME). <br /><br />My first &amp; favorite method is the Torpedo:<br /><br />Empty out a cigarette by rolling it between your fingers (leave the filter in place). <br /><br />Collect the tobacco on a folded sheet of paper, throw out a pinch or so (to make space for the hash)<br /><br />Crumble the hash into sand-sized pieces (use a lighter to heat for ~2 seconds if the hash is too hard)<br /><br />Mix in with the tobacco on the sheet<br /><br />Scoop the tobacco back into the cigarette tube (this takes practice- massage the tube periodically to get the mixture to settle)<br /><br />Once it&#039;s all packed up, twist the top like a spliff<br /><br />Make a paper filter that&#039;s about 5mm longer than the cotton&nbsp; filter (magazine insert, cigarette pack, business card- cut to size, curve it by rubbing it on the edge of a counter top, then roll into a tight cylinder- it needs to be springy enough to grab the edge of the cigarette tube and not fall out)<br /><br />Roll the filter end of the torpedo in your fingers to loosen the filter<br /><br />Squeeze the filter and use your teeth or tweezers to pull the filter<br /><br />Pop in your tightly coiled filter- the extra 5mm should give it a good final packing from the filter end.<br /><br />Other, easier methods:<br /><br />Ubie Vaporizer- break it up to about the size of sea salt, place the chunks towards the middle, hold a lighter about 2-3 inches below the tip, inhale slowly.<br /><br />ABV and hash spliff- sub vaped greens for tobacco- harsh, but nicotine free<br />

				ok ive tried smoking hash a million diff ways, and recently found the most effective. just 2-3 small hits gets me flyin<br /><br />either use a meth pipe, or a lightbulb.<br />i know it sounds crack head, but its awesome!<br /><br />i took an already clear lightbulb (candle looking one)<br />stabbed a small screw driver in the bottom and wiggled it till all the fillimant was out.<br /><br />now shake that bitch with salt and hot water.<br />i used alcohol too on a second wash.<br /><br />throw a little ball of hash in there (size of a BB)<br />hold the lighter below the bulb (not touching)<br /><br />and just wait. that bitch will fill with hash vapor.<br />&nbsp;<br />when its full enough just stick a pen tube inside and inhale.<br /><br />welcome to space.

				Fortunately the hash breaks up into very small chunks without heat, and is working great in the volcano. I definitely need a screen for when I use the bowl though, that&#039;s a good call. I haven&#039;t used a screen in a decade.

				I tried it on a bong today. CEV were amazing and the body high was like being in a full body cast in a sitting position. I couldn&#039;t move. <br /><br />And the hits expanding in your longs in very true. I had coughed up bong water a few times from being caught off guard

				Hashish is very powerful being, my friends! Always take her respectfully, in return she shall respect you to the ends of time and back.<br /><br />Yes, you can indeed heat good hash in a freebase pipe or (if you&#039;re really desparate) a lightbulb. I wouldn&#039;t try a lightbulb personally cause of whatever other stuff I don&#039;t want to inhale might be in the lightbulb base. But I have a freebase pipe for DMT, and that works too, but honestly I prefer to filter hashish smoke through water before inhaling.<br /><br />As others have said, no need to hold the lighter very close. Yes, the smoke expands a LOT. Its vapor really, you&#039;re boiling.<br />The temperature range at which THC starts to boil is 200 degrees C. Get it too hot and it *will* be harsh as you vaporize and particularly polymerize the resins into longer chain carbon units (this is that nasty black stuff we all see in our bowls from time to time) Yeah, it contains a bit of active cannabinoids still, but it also contains some of the most nasty tar this side of tobacco. so.. Caution is advised..<br /><br />All that said, our good friend Hashish is a great way to enjoy the spirits of the Cannabis plant.<br />

				It&#039;s not that complicated really, there&#039;s a variety of ways to enjoy hash (other then edibles) I&#039;ve smoked using a variety of ways over the years, a lot of people like &quot;hot knives&quot; but i find it annoying. I hear vaping hash can clog up the bags quicker so best not to vape hash (all depends on grade too of course)<br /><br />get your pipe/bong, put a little bit of weed at the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle hash on top, then a small layer of weed and that will work a treat...

				a vaporizer...specifically, a volcano vaporizer if you have access to one. if not, i would recommend a skillet, an oil rig, a T-i nail, or something similar in nature.

				I actually cant smoke hash, weed, it just makes me splutter and cough and waste it.<br /><br />I just eat it, break it into small bits and through it down, not knowing the effects of smoking, I think this has much the same effect, but it does taste fowl.&nbsp; Or could get someone to make cookies, or put in soup.

				I love the Eclipse Vape with the screw on glass vials. I think I paid $59 on ebay and it came in a zippered case with accessories. This is the stand-alone unit not the Vape 2O which plugs into a bong. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to try the Eclipse Vape 2O but haven&#039;t found an inexpensive glass bong on the Web yet. It needs to have either a 14mm or 18mm hole for the Vape 2O to plug in to.

				In Scandinavia they have a very unique approach to smoking hash. This method resides mainly in Denmark, but has also influenced their way of smoking in Sweden and Germany and so on.<br /><br />There is a very strong subculture concerning hash in Copenhagen and Denmark, partly due to the free town of Christiania in Copenhagen. (Really worth checking out if you should for any reason visit Denmark.)<br /><br />Anyhow, the most comfortable way to smoke hash in my honest opinion, is by smoking it in joints with toasted tobacco. The tobacco is toasted by waving a cigarette slowly back and forth over a lighter flame, until smoke vapor starts going out, and then you put the cigarette in your mouth and blow air through it until it&#039;s free of vapor. Then you continue this process until the cigarette is nice and crisp all over (not too dry) and has a kinda sweet bread smell. This can be hard to do in the beginning and you will probably burn a lot of cigarettes, but once the techniques is down you&#039;ll see the advantages of toasting the tobacco in this way. <br />Easier methods to gain the same effect, but where you can do it easier and in larger quantities, is for example by toasting pure tobacco in a pot or pan in the kitchen, or putting tobacco in the microwave oven or cooking cigarettes in water and then letting them dry in the sun or on the radiator.<br /><br />By toasting the tobacco in this way it burns the hash better (too good if you toasted it too much and it&#039;s too dry, so watch out, you don&#039;t want your hash disappearing in an inferno), the tobacco tastes more gentle and gives a better taste to the hash, and you don&#039;t get sick from nicotine, tar and other additives, because you removed them in the toasting process!<br /><br />Then you mix it with the hash, which you crumble into very small lumps. Depending on how much hash you smoke, you might wanna put in more tobacco (I use about one cigarette pr.&nbsp; 0.5 gr of hash).<br /><br />Then you wanna roll the cone, which should in my opinion be as cone shaped as possible for the burning to do best. You can use all the same methods as when you roll the Dutch kind of joints, so I recommend smoking them with one layer of paper for best burning or no glue for best taste. In Denmark they have the tradition of rolling the joint cone BEFORE filling it like it was a container, because it is a lot easier than rolling it with the hash tobacco mix inside. I don&#039;t do this because of my super jedi rolling skills, but I can recommend this for beginning joint rollers as it will greatly help you in making pretty, good burning joints.<br /><br />I hope you understand my walkthrough of my vision of an ideal joint and will try it out, I could maybe submit some pictures for elaborating on the process if people are interested.
