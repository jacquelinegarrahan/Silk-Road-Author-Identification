				I have a gram of 2C-B that I plan to take with me to Burning Man.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a scale that&#039;s accurate enough to measure out individual doses, so my plan is to dilute it in distilled water and measure dosage that way.<br /><br />Is the molecule stable in water or will it break down?&nbsp; Can I just dump the entire gram into a 1 liter container and bring home the leftovers, or will it lose efficacy over time?&nbsp; It&#039;ll be stored in an RV refrigerator at a stable temperature.<br />

				It will be good for a few days ... for anything longer than a week store in a freezer. Though I recommend 50% water, 50% vodka/everclear to keep away bacterial growth.

				2Cs seem pretty hardy. They&#039;re based on mescaline, which grows in the desert.

				This isn&#039;t an answer to your question, but it&#039;s more information. 2C-B.HBr is soluble in ethanol to 5mg/mL if you warm the ethanol. If you can get some polish pure spirit, or whatever name is ascribed to &gt;90% ethanol in your part of the world, or some pure ethanol, you can warm it up to about 50°C and dissolve your 2C-B in it.<br /><br />I hope this is obvious, but use an electric heat source and a thermometer and not a gas mantle to heat the solvent.<br /><br />200mL of ethanol will dissolve the entire gram, as well as prevent any bacteria or algae growing in the solution. Using a syringe you can then administer 2C-B at 5mg/mL. Take a 5 mL syringe and 100mL of your solution with you and you ought to be prepared for rather a weird and good Burning Man.<br /><br />The hydrochloride salt is more soluble in ethanol and water, but on the balance of probabilities it&#039;s the hydrobromide salt you have.

				From a chemist&#039;s point of view I can&#039;t see any possible way it would degrade in water. No ester bonds to hydrolyse or anything like that. It should be stable indefinitely.

				I would imagine so. I can&#039;t think of any that have weak 4 substitutions in water, so yes.
