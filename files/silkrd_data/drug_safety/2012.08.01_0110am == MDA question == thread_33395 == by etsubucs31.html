				I recently acquired some MDA from Montell Williams. I haven&#039;t tried sass yet and was wondering whether you all like to stay in and chill or go out and dance? On MDMA I prefer to just stay in and chill but it seems that MDA is a little speedier. Also from what I have read, doses of MDA tend to be similar to that of MDMA, does this sound correct? Thanks for any help!

				mda is speedier perfect for dancing, it also have some optics, you took an high dose mdma already? then you have a bit of the feeling from mda because mdma are metabolized in mda in higher amounts. the dosage is a bit lower then the mdma dosage. i would took about 100-120mg for an nice expirience<br /><br />but the best is if you comnine it with mdma then you have an blissfull expirience!

				Yeah Montell&#039;s MDA is fucking serious man.&nbsp; I took 150 mg up front and was feeling it intensely.&nbsp; I do not suggest re-dosing on MDA otherwise you will have a massive massive hang over.&nbsp; I would suggest doing this where you can dance.

				MDA is more hallucinogenic than MDMA alone. Its effects come on strong in slightly smaller doses than MDMA. For example, if you usually take 150mg of MDMA, it is generally held that about 100mg of MDA would produce similar effects. MDA also lasts a bit longer than MDMA (6+ hours compared to about 3-5 for MDMA). <br /><br />I also agree that re-dosing on MDA is not a great idea. MDA can be more neurotoxic and if you take too much or re-dose a lot, you may start to have a weird trip and start to see things. <br /><br />I really enjoy mixing MDA with MDMA with about a 60/40 ratio of MDMA to MDA. You get the best of both worlds! :) <br /><br />If I were taking MDA alone, I would probably take about 120-150mg (I have a relatively high tolerance).
