				What would be the best drug to endure an interncontinental flight?<br /><br />I travel quite often on long fligts, and being a smoker that isnt always that easy to do. <br /><br />What would you think is the best drug to deal with that situation?<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried things like temazepam before, but i really dislike the amnesic effects of that. Taking diazepam, oxazepam and a mixture of both requires an unpleasant dose to put me out of the ride. Is there any drug in particular that is favourable for this situattion?

				Tripping sounds like a terrible idea on a flight!&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you tried using nicotine lozenges while flying (or other situations where you can&#039;t smoke for a long period)?&nbsp; It won&#039;t totally eliminate the cravings, but will definitely take most of the edge off - maybe enough so, that a smaller amount of valium will make the trip more tolerable.<br /><br />

				Take some shrooms/LSD with the Xanax, that will calm you down without dampening your visuals or creativity too much. :D I&#039;ve flown on small flights before (under 20 people) and it&#039;s been so beautiful, seeing the sunset was magical.

				Xanax/benzos or sleeping pills, even 3 benadryl (~75mg diphenhydramine) or so will help. I&#039;ve slept for nearly 16 hours straight on a transatlantic flight after taking 3 benadryl and eating some hash butter. No better way to fly than being knocked out nearly the whole time. Also running on little sleep before doing this will make it extra easy to pass out. I frequently take long flights like the one you are speaking of.<br /><br />edit: Or ambien (zolpidem) provided you actually try to go to sleep, but I dislike ambien... makes me get double vision and weird hallucinations and behavior if for some reason I don&#039;t actually fall asleep.

				seriously fuck every other thing besides xanax or sleeping pills<br /><br />every long flight (hawaii, australia, china, and some europe tripps) has been a fucking blessing for me with literally no jet lag based on my consumption of xanax and beer<br /><br />basically for 6hrs and under, 1mg and 1-2 beers<br /><br />anything over 1mg 3-4 beers or just 2mg and maybe a beer.<br /><br />so much fucking fun waking up and being all rested and your clock reset while other are groggy. i cant stress xanax enough for flights<br /><br />they should literally as $10 to a ticket for xanax to be given along with it thats how perfect it goes together

				I&#039;m not looking for a trip - i suppose some people may enjoy that, but the only thing i want is to be sedated for the flight. I am not at all afraid of flying, and i don&#039;t mind taking hops for a couple of hours, nor trying to fly a sailplane myself for a bit. Its just 10+ hour flights that get to me, combination of utter boredom, nonsmoking environment, and unable to do anything about it. <br /><br />If i owned a plane that could complete the trip in reasonable time i&#039;d surely be taking that - no smoking ban, and flying it would mean something to do, albeit rather boring on long straight flights (like driving endless highways). <br /><br />A couple of drinks and some benzo&#039;s seem to be the most common answer apart from tripping out completely, and it&#039;s what i&#039;ve been using in this situation before. The combination of alcohol and benzo&#039;s (at least temazepam, diazepam or oxazepam) gives me terrible amnesia though. Not that it&#039;s a bad thing to forget being stuck on a plane for the better part of eternity, its just very odd waking up just before landing in bangkok, badly craving a smoke, and with little idea how you got there. <br /><br />I suppose i&#039;ll give xanax a go though - no idea if that will cause the same amount of amnesia as other benzo&#039;s combined with alcohol, but i doubt it would be any worse either. <br /><br />For the smoking part: I&#039;m never sure if they allow e-cigs or not - some nicotine gum or tablets surely deal with most physiological withdrawal, although for me they do not reduce the psychological craving for a cig one bit. <br /><br />And for good measure, i am aware of the risks of taking alcohol and benzo&#039;s at the same time. Surely i do not want to risk respiratory depression on an airplane (which is extra problematic in the lowered pressure environment). This makes the dose a tricky balance however.

				I&#039;m inclined to taking xanax a try for this. At low doses it doesnt have much hypnotic quality to me, but 2 mg or so certainly starts to show its effects beyond anxiolytic. <br /><br />Halflife is a conundrum here though, especially if you consider the combination with alcohol. The alcohol will break down about 10 grams an hour - not a half life, but a straight slope down. Diazepam with its active metabolites can take 2 days to reach half life (in terns of efficacy) whereas alprazolam is cleared very quickly. Normally the latter is fine for me, since i have more difficulty falling asleep then staying asleep, but for some reason i can&#039;t really sleep was well on airplanes. On an equally cramped night bus i&#039;m usually out much easier. I&#039;m not sure if it has to do with the sound of the engines, the reduced pressure or something completely different, but its annoying for sure. <br /><br />It has nothing to do with being uneasy with flying though, i&#039;m perefectly comfortable with taking plane rides and do so frequently... its just the long hauls (&gt;6 hours or so) that tend to drive me a bit mad.

				here is is plain and simple<br /><br />you take a good amount, with whatever fucking tolerance you have for the anti-anxiety part...up it slightly to the hypnotic part..right?<br /><br /><br />start drinking...again KNOWING your body....<br /><br /><br />now the kicker? (the best part of xanax over the others?)&nbsp; the HALF LIFE...meaning you become refreshed QUICKER than valium ...hence the...&quot;oh shit i just woke up and we are almost there/arrive or you got one hour of letting our a yawn, stretching, chilling the fuck out and watch something on your god damn, iphone, ipad, android, tablet, laptop, tits.

				I wear my negative karma as a badge of honor. I give no fucks. I&#039;m sorry if I come across as a douche, but if they had Xanax in 1969 they wouldn&#039;t have dished out barbituates and quaaludes. Benzodiazepines replaced barbituates. Common sense. <br /><br />

				I would suggest using seroquel if it is a very long flight. It will sedate you for many hours, completely knocked out. If you have never used seroquel before I would take ten of fifteen mg.

				For some reason, MXE was a great airplane drug for me! I took a relatively small dosage, passed out for about 1.5-2 hours, woke up as the plane began descending, and bathed in the afterglow of the drug! And it&#039;s super duper discreet imo!

				The screeners are mostly just looking for weapons, aerosol cans, lighters, and whatnot. They pretty much always overlook pills and stuff because if they didn&#039;t, airport security would take 3 times as long to get through. So many people need to bring medication on flights that to inspect any &quot;suspicious&quot; looking medicine would be absolutely ludicrous.

				my wife flies international all the time...she likes ativan (lorazepam). myself i prefer 2mg klonopins (clonazepam) or if you can locate them...ruffies (Flunitrazepam) are my favorite for long international flights. no alcohol required...just sweet dreams and will awake at one with your seat. 1-2mgs works well for me....i know a gentleman that takes 5mg but his benzo tolerance is extreme and takes adderall when the wheels touch if he&#039;s too sleepy for business. clonazepam&nbsp; and flunitrazepam ( has residual active metabolites that can last for days) have much longer half lifes than xanax (alprazolam) or halcion (triazolam). so if you are naive to benzos try xanax or halcion (triazolam) first.<br />remember you can always take more!dont over do it the first time. try some at home first so you arent stuck on a plane for hours with unexpected side effects. An initial prescribed does of xanax is 0.25-0.5mg....so start there and see how you feel. remember you can always take more...id hate to hear of you getting carried off a plane on a gurney!<br />i dont recommend alcohol in excess with benzos. amnesia and horrible hang overs that linger for days have been my experience. <br />enjoy your flight!\<br /><br />kymatt<br />

				Surprised that not many people mentioned opioids. That would be my first choice: no having to deal with back/shoulder/muscle/any pains from sitting in a chair hours on end, can put you to sleep, and makes the ride plain more interesting. Take a few pills right before you go into security, and there you go.

				I&#039;ve decided to stick with a tried recipe and it helped: 1 mg alprazolam some time before actually flying out, and 10 mg diazepam + 50 mg oxazepam for the actual flight. In combination with a few (not a shitload) of drinks, it kept me nicely sedated all the way from kuala lumpur to cairo, waking up only when they decided to serve breakfast an hour or so before landing. Dozed off again on the flight from cairo to amsterdam a few hours later, no idea if that was thanks to the medication or just fatigue.<br /><br />Downside is i really prefer oxazepam for this kind of thing and that has been hard to get lately :(
