				Best way to smoke hash without wasting any on drifting smoke and charred lumps of shit in your pipe, is blades.<br />Grab one of those propane plumbing torches from a hardware store.<br />Cut a large soda bottle so you can put the small end in your mouth, and the cut part of the body is your cone.<br />Pinch of small 1-hit beads of hash (I like to do 15-20 of these at a sitting) that will be enough to fill your lungs.<br />Heat up two butter knives in the torch until red-hot.<br />Tap one of the beads with a hot knife and squash it between the two blades, just under your cone, as you inhale deeply.<br />Scrape knives together to remove ash/char and repeat.<br />When you are high as fuck, do one more and you should be good.

				If you have a regular bowl, use a pipe screen, put some marihuana and then the hash on top. <br />Usually works pretty well. Just don&#039;t put the hash in alone because it will melt and goes through the screen and you will loose a lot of it.

				The best way to do it is bottle tokes!<br /><br />Make little pieces of hash and set them on a tray like a cd jewel case or book or something.<br /><br />Take an empty plastic bottle with a cap and burn one hole in the side big enough to place a cigarette through.<br /><br />Light a cigarette.<br /><br />Touch the tip of the cigarette to a piece of hash so it sticks, blow it once or twice to get it streaming smoke, and insert it into the bottle.<br /><br />Watch it burn.<br /><br />Take the cigarette out and put it down. <br /><br />Unscrew the cap and inhale.<br /><br />Repeat.

				a hash bowl..<br /><br />I bought a roor one, its got a groove for a metal screen to fit, with pinches so you the screen stays supported, and those pinches also double as holders for the glass screen. I remember the retard behind the counter lost the glass screen between the displays so instead of giving me another one he gave me a roor ashtray instead.. I wasn&#039;t impressed at all.. but the roor hash bowl is fucking minty..<br /><br />if you turn it 180 degree it can be used as a bell attachment for hotknives or whatever method to smoke oil or budder.

				I just use a plain &#039;ol water pipe. Break the hash into several small balls, put them in the pipe, and add a little heat. It&#039;s not as efficient as hot knives but I feel it&#039;s a more casual, calming way to imbibe. <br /><br />Hot knives are great but you can go overboard pretty quickly if you have very good hash. That&#039;s not a lot of fun.<br /><br />Another really good way to smoke it (if you have lots of product and a few people) is to make a volcano. Roll the hash out as flat as possible, then roll it into a hollow cone shape. Stick a safety pin through the top and light it from the bottom. Smoke it using a hooter of some sort (empty pen, straw, etc.) When done right this is a fun, sociable way of smoking it. But again, it&#039;s very easy to overdo it. I&#039;ve seen people literally turn green from smoking hash using this method.<br /><br />I don&#039;t quite understand why some people like to roll it with tobacco. The thing I love the most about smoking hash is the taste. I wouldn&#039;t want to wreck that spicy flavor by adding tobacco.<br />

				For me nothing beats sitting back chilling with a nice joint.<br />At parties the &#039;blowback&#039; was always a fun point of the night ( one person puts joint into mouth, lips around the roach and blows while another inhales the smoke )<br />One thing I would personally advise you should try at least once is drinking smoke ( though it does take a bit of prep )<br />fill a pint glass with water, tip it out and put in freezer, once frozen, fill with water, tip out and back into freezer,repeat this process for a few days and you will end up with a glass covered with ice/frost on the inside.<br />when ready to use, do blowback (as above) until glass is full - the ice/frost holds all the smoke inside - to smoke you inhale while tipping glass up like drinking, plus the smoke is well chilled. Bit of a novelty for a party.<br />Used to do hot knifes until I heard ( and Smelt ) my mates burning lip as he slipped with the knife.<br />

				Dude, the best way I discovered was by using my DMT pipe (crack/meth pipe) with the hash. Really transformed the experience. It even tasted like fresh vapor from my vaporizer.<br /><br />Only problem is that it had 5-meo-DMT residue on the side still, which blended in with the hash residue, and I ended up accidentally tripping balls.<br /><br />Accidental 5meo trips really require some impromptu focus sessions lol.

				the trick for smoking hash in a bowl is how you light it, you don&#039;t want direct flame on the hash.<br />i just keep it barely away until it&#039;s done bubbling, then it starts to cache out and engulfs itself.<br />to make it easier to smoke, i break off a bit with my nail and pinch it as flat as possible, then put that on top of a small herb nugget so it doesn&#039;t go through the bowl.
