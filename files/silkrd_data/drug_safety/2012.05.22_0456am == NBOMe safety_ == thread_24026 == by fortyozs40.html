				I am trying NBOMe for my first time and it arrived from dannyboone quickly in 4 days, but I don&#039;t want to do the entire 2mg blotter my first time, i really wanted to just try a fourth, but I am really not sure if a fourth of a blotter would really work, as I have heard you have to keep it in your upper lip for up to 30 minutes, and I have even heard people say not to swallow any saliva also.<br /><br />I just really wanted to know if any of you have any suggestions.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-40

				Yes, 500ug should work fine, I would think 2mg would be a bit much.&nbsp; Just cut the blotter into quarters with a razor blade, Exacto knife, or similar.&nbsp; And you&#039;re right about the method of dosing, just try to keep it in one spot against your gums and don&#039;t let it get lost in your mouth.

				Thanks a lot!<br /><br />This may sound dumb, but does it matter what side of the blotter is against the gums?

				Nope&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Blotters are dipped so they have a layer around the whole thing so use tweezers or something to break them up, handing them greatly reduces strength. <br /><br />Just shove it as far up between your gum and lip as you can and try re-frame from moving your mouth much, try lying back on a sofa and watch some TV, make sure to swallow your saliva but not slosh it around your mouth.&nbsp; <br /><br />ENJOY&nbsp; 8)

				Couple questions.<br /><br />1) What kinda of Nbome?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing 25i, since that is the best one.<br /><br />2) How much 25i on each tab?&nbsp; Some of the 25i sold on SR is 500ug per tab, some is 1000ug.<br /><br />3) Who did you get your 25i from?&nbsp; Please review after you try!<br /><br /><br />I am a fan of 25i.&nbsp; I am a long time LSD and shroom user, but since LSD is so scarce, I have taken up 25i.&nbsp; 25i is great.&nbsp; Extremely visual, mild body, clean head (not too hard to function)...overall an outstanding drug.&nbsp; 1000ug is a great dose.&nbsp; Make sure you are somewhere safe and comfortable for your first time.&nbsp; Have good music, have some water and some snacks to keep your energy up, have some nug or beers (or both).&nbsp; Under tongue, in between gum or lip, both works pretty well.&nbsp; Take 1000ug and really get a feeling for the drug.<br /><br />Have fun!

I&#039;m think you&#039;re not supposed to swallow your saliva for 20-30 minutes while it&#039;s on your gum. <br />And 25i doesn&#039;t lose potency like LSD, I&#039;m sure it would to some extent but it&#039;s nowhere near as volatile, or maybe that&#039;s just what the 25i is put with to complex it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes I have eaten many of those, if you don&#039;t want to swallow doesn&#039;t really matter where you put it but the issue is after 5mins there is so much saliva you cant talk or breath if you have blocked nose and you swallow and its all wasted. If you do it the way I explained you get the most from it I promise&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Do it right and in 30mins your lip/gum is almost has a numb feeling where the tab is. And I usually just keep it up there for 45mins because you can almost just forget its there.

				now i&#039;m confused...<br />you shouldn&#039;t swallow right??....but at the end like after 30-45 minutes swallow all the saliva that&#039;s built up in your mouth<br />while the blotter is between your upperlip and uppergum you can move it around with the tip of your tongue once in a while...near the end just play with it suck it dry and spit out or swallow if you fee like<br /><br />same goes for LSD i suppose, they say on the tongue but the nbome way works fine too...<br /><br /><br /><br />

Try not to swallow, the point is with you not swallowing your saliva it will build up saliva in your mouth. By 20 minutes in you&#039;ll have a good amount of saliva in your mouth and it makes it pretty easy to continue. I kept mine in my gums for an hour just for good measure, then chewed them up a bit and took them out. Then you can swallow your saliva.

				Before taking a substance its always a good idea to do some research in regards to dosage and best ROA. <br /><br />I&#039;m not super familiar with NBOMe however I&#039;m sure you can find an abundance of information at:<br /><br />www.errowid.org<br /><br />This site should provide you with all you need to know in regards to dosage, effects, and even legality. <br /><br />If you need further information www.bluelight.ru should have a few forum threads discussing this substance further. Just log in and do a search :)<br /><br />Happy tripping!
