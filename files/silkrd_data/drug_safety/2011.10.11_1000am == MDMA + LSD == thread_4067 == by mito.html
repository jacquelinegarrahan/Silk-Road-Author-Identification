				Anyone tried both together?<br /><br />I was reading the FAQ at Erowid and this description caught my attention:<br /><br />MDMA + LSD:&nbsp; Can go very well together.&nbsp; LSD and MDMA is commonly known as &quot;XL&quot; or &quot;candyflipping&quot;.&nbsp; Most prefer quite low doses of LSD.

				Hi mito!<br /><br />LSD &amp; MDMA is indeed a very good combo. What most people do is first take the MDMA to set the mood and then take the acid to trip. Safetywise I wouldnt really know the risks, but I guess its not extremely dangerous since alot of people do it and report good things. Still, make sure you drink enough (but not 2 much, there are cases that people have died of brain their brain swelling up from drinking to much) and prepare your candyflipping with alot of vitamine C :)<br /><br />Warm greetings,<br /><br />Mitanox

				While I can&#039;t personally recommend it since I&#039;ve never taken LSD (hopefully that will change over the next couple months. Thank you, SR), I&#039;ve heard many good things. However, be careful in timing your doses- MDMA lasts around 3-6 hours, and LSD around 6-8. If you don&#039;t enjoy coming down from MDMA, you&#039;ll probably enjoy it even less while tripping. Perhaps take the LSD, and an hour or two later, the MDMA. It depends on the dosage of both substances, of course.

				Yes, I&#039;ve had this combo a few times and it is very nice indeed. I find that it is more enjoyable to have the LSD first and then the MDMA at least 2 hours later, a little longer if you can hold out that long.&nbsp; Add some MJ for the comedown, ahhh good times, good times&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; The setting is very important, you&#039;ll want to be somewhere where you can get comfortable, so I think it is better suited for a house party or at home rather than out at a club or event.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;;D I registered to reply to you<br />Have you tried LSD before?<br />I&#039;ve always thought that an acid trip evolves from the mind set you have when you drop into it.<br />Some are fun, trippy, insightful, imaginative &amp; even dark.<br /><br />Let&#039;s imagine the peak of euphoria &amp; empathy you experience with MDMA... good you there?<br />Now add LSD<br />BOOM!<br /><br />Lose it on a dance floor,&nbsp; make mad monkey love with your partner, explore the contents of your kitchen cupboards &amp; marvel at the textures.<br />Or just trip out &amp; marvel at your insignificance in the universe.<br /><br />If available I recommend, just follow MDMA best practice<br /><br />&amp; I recommend MJ for the come down &amp; a cold beer, or a nice cup of tea if you prefer&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Never really dug candyflipping.<br /><br />Both MDMA and LSD are amazing on their won, but for they cancel each other out quite a bit when combined.<br /><br />I get general confusion with heightened brain activity and the emotive and physical effects of MDMA just making it <br />too much a case of sensory overload to really enjoy the effects of either substance. <br /><br />Some 2-CB or a low dose combo of mushrooms and MDMA is quite good.

				I&#039;m with mambosun, I did probably 2 blotters (200ug&#039;s each) and waited about 2 hours maybe 2.5 and dropped about 150mg of mdma washed down with limeaid and it was definetly one of the most intense yet introspective trips I have ever had. Timing is the key though you want to drop the mdma just as you are starting to peak on the acid so as you come ouf of peak the mdma keeps you very upbeat and almost seems like it extends your trip.

				For me LSD was always a coin flip on an amazing time, or too much and the paranoia kicks in.&nbsp; I found MDMA almost guarantees a great night when taken with LSD.&nbsp; I do notice I have to redose 3-5 hours (Start with E 1-2 hours before to set mood), since LSD lasts twice as long.&nbsp; E is the only way I can take shrooms.

				Candy flipping is great fun but for a first time take it easy as others have suggested. Start with say 100-150ug lsd, then say an hour later abt 100mg of molly. Wait 1/2 hour and see how you are feeling. You can always take more bout you can&#039;t &quot;untake&quot;. Then if you are OK go out some where and have a good time.

				Here&#039;s an interesting post I found a while back while researching candyflipping on a Dutch forum (drugsforum.info) a while back. Here the poster talks about how en when to dose E and LSD... And actually suggests taking E after the acid.:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How can I possibly describe how candyflipping has enhanced my life over the years? No words would be sufficient. Done properly, a candyflip captures all the profound wonder of LSD, coupled with the confidence, poise, and spiritual opening of MDMA. It is a truly a wonderful gift, but allow me to warn you ahead of time that it&#039;s pretty difficult to do right, and requires a lot of planning and forethought, even more than acid does by itself. <br /><br />Normally one should never try to combine two drugs, especially two as powerful as acid and E. Candyflipping doesn&#039;t just refer to the combination of the two; it refer to using them in a staggered method that produces an entirely unique effect that is unlike either of the drugs by themselves. So first of all, never take acid and E at the same time, or even within an hour or two of each other! This will produce a sort of drunken intoxication which you might find fun (or you might find unpleasant, like me), but in either case it does not qualify as candyflipping. <br /><br />Candyflipping requires that the relative &quot;peak&quot; times of the two drugs (from the 1hr mark to the 3hr mark with E, and from the 1hr mark to the 4h mark with acid) do not overlap. You can theoretically do it in either order, but I (and friends of mine) have always done it with acid first, E later. The most important thing to know, that I have deduced by careful (and sometimes unpleasant) experimentation:<br /><br />Take your E exactly four (4) hours after taking your acid!<br /><br />Why is this so important? <br /><br />Well, if you take your E early (like say, after 3 hours) your acid peak won&#039;t be done yet, and the drugs end up sort of fighting for control of your brain. This is not a very fun sensation; you end up feeling lethargic and sort of light-headed. You may come out of it after an hour or two, but you will have missed the &quot;candyflip&quot; and will be just left feeling like you took a lot of drugs, and sometimes slightly spacey depending on the person. (Editor&#039;s Note: Not everyone agrees about this; one person sent a comment saying that they don&#039;t get much effect doing it this way, but they have a &quot;brilliant&quot; time when they take a low dose of MDMA about 45 minutes before ingesting LSD.) <br /><br />If you take the E late (say, after 5 hours) you&#039;ll get a similar effect as taking your E too early, but probably not as strong. After 45 minutes or so it will clear up and you&#039;ll find that you&#039;re just rolling from the E, and it&#039;s not much like you took two drugs at all, more that you just took one after the other. <br /><br />Another important thing is dosage. Taking less acid causes it to come on more slowly, and as a result taking your E at the four hour mark may actually be too early. Taking a lot of acid works great as long as you can handle it&nbsp; but in this case you may want to take your E slightly earlier, say at T+3:45. Generally I just recommend a normal dose, 3 hits of standard blotter paper, but again there&#039;s nothing wrong with more as long as you can handle it. <br /><br />With E, you probably want to take a minimal dosage, or else it will just overpower the acid and you&#039;ll be rolling (not a bad thing, but you&#039;ll miss out on the candyflip). If you have a batch of pills and you normally take 1.5 pills to roll, then probably try either 1.5 or 1 pill. In a nutshell, it&#039;s better to err slightly on the side of a low dose than on the side of high.<br /><br />The Candyflip Effect<br /><br />I like candyflipping all around better than any other drug (or drug combination) because in many ways it is very close to being sober as far as your mental state, but it allows you to access all the really excellent effects of acid (music sounds great, sense of profoundness, insightfulness) and E (poise, confidence, self-love and love for others) without the downsides (the &quot;confusion&quot; and scariness of acid, the running-around-hugging-everyone effect of E). <br /><br />The candyflip moment, as I think of it, is about half an hour after you take your E. The acid confusion seems to lift off of you like a heavy fog suddenly dissipating. The room suddenly seems more open (this is very dramatic if you&#039;re someplace with a high ceiling). You are suddenly instilled with a sense wonder and awe at the amazing things our world has to offer, a feeling that you have power over your own destiny, and a sense of purpose to do the things that are important to you. And there is an incredible feeling that something profound and important is about to happen. <br /><br />Watching someone who is in the midst of a successful candyflip is pretty cool, too. Their entire demeanor gains a perfect confidence, without the slightest hint of arrogance. Their skin seems to glow. The eyes are probably the most dramatic: they grow wide and bright, like those of a child, but wiser. <br /><br />My favorite candyflip activity is looking at a powerful laser and listening to really good trance coming out of big speakers, but that&#039;s just me. <br /><br />Health Stuff<br /><br />I guess I should mention this since it&#039;s going onto this website. Basically, candyflipping is one of the more rigorous drug experiences you can have, especially if you do it at a party. The entire thing lasts a really long time (9 or 10 hours total) and you expend a lot of resources. I make sure to sleep in super late the day before I am going to make a candyflip, and dose myself with lots of vitamins in the previous week. Then I make sure I don&#039;t have anything making demands on my time in the next day or two following the candyflip so that I can sleep as much as I need (which usually isn&#039;t all that much, but sometimes it is). <br /><br />So, to summarize - this is a really awesome experience that I would recommend to anyone. Just be sure that you are prepared (both mentally and physically), have a good setting to do it in, have your drugs pretested and in proper dosages. By &quot;pretested&quot; I don&#039;t just mean that you&#039;ve done the EZ-Test on them, I mean that you have tried them before in a controlled environment so that you&#039;re not only sure of what they are, but how much you should take. You also should not attempt it until you are fairly familiar with both LSD and MDMA (like, you&#039;ve used each at least four or five times). And don&#039;t forget: four hours! Use a stopwatch so that you do not mistake the proper time to take your E.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				great info!!!<br />&nbsp;:D<br /><br />personally when ive taken (~300mcg) lsd then mdma (200mg) while tripping i found the mdma overpowered the lsd trip. i prefer to enjoy the two separately as the distinct characteristics felt somewhat numbed to me. ie the roll wasnt as hard (peace/love/empathy) and the trip wasnt as psychedelic or pure. but who knows, maybe thats cuz i was tripping!! but afterword i did feel like it was kind of a waste. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />my 2 cents :P<br />

				I personally would recommend the combinations. In my view, one of the main dangers of LSD is your own emotions, and MDMA does an excellent job of keeping you happy, which is generally a great way to ensure a good trip. I&#039;ve only done it once myself, was at a rave, and had one of the greatest experiences of my life.

				Gonna try this on NYE, I&#039;ve only done LSD once and I wasn&#039;t really impressed but it was obviously a low dose cause all I really experienced is some patterns on the wall and difficulty sleeping. Hopefully this combo will change my perspective on acid.

				highly recommend candyflipping (the term used for taking LSD and ecstasy at the same time)<br /><br />The first time I candyflipped I LOVED it but I was freaking out... I had some orange paul franks which I thought were some just really fire rolls... turned out to be acid laced with 5 hits... it was pretty intense until I had a girl call me and calm me down... after that, I enjoyed the hell out of it...<br /><br />I definitely recommend it...just be safe and be prepared :)

				I took one Shiva blotter (120ug) and some Methylone and the LSD was completely overpowering. I think it would great with weaker acid, or more methylone (perhaps I simply needed mdma not methylone).

				My gf swears by candyflipping, she tells me about crazy introspectrive trips and happy visuals. Last time she did it she went off on some rant about how beautiful and amazing the human form is and has gone to a yoga class every single day since without having had any interest in it before, and swears that its that trip thats still making her go. So it can be a powerful experience. (That was a single local source tab and 100mg of dqb mdma)<br />Personally I haven&#039;t experienced anything nearly that profound but I&#039;m more experienced with psychedelics than her. I love the combination of lsd visual tracers with mdma nystagmus, everything has a wierd plastic-looking blur to it heh. I also find theres a higher level of confusion and forgetfulness than on either of them individually so make sure you&#039;re prepared with whatever you&#039;ll need during. I actually had a pretty bad time the last candyflip because my power went out so I ended up pacing around my house in the dark feeling lost.&nbsp; :-\

				Love both of these LSD a little more though.. Had a tab and a cap at the same time once, and it became kind of weird during my come down so many mix emotions I tried to come to terms with but once that was over I flew through the rest of the trip... Real good times..

				I would personally recommend these two options:<br /><br />1) Drop a nice dose of lsd first and get to where you&#039;d like to be psychedelically. Then, drop a low dose (&lt;100mg) of molly about halfway into the trip. <br />2) Roll balls on some good molly and then drop a tab or two about 3 hours after ingestion.<br /><br />Be careful out there, it can be very overwhelming!<br /><br /><br />

				my perfect recipe for a candyflip is:<br /><br />T+0: Take ~120ug lsd<br />T+2: Take ~125mg mdma<br />T+2 - T+6: have the best time of your life<br />T+6: Smoke a little weed to take the edge off the mdma comedown and ease you through the rest of your trip.<br /><br />Some people recommend redosing on mdma, but I feel like it&#039;s a bad idea. Did it once and I came off the lsd and mdma at the same time and it was pretty shitty. Personally the weed on the tail end of candyflipping is key for me.

				LSD+MDMA is a religious experience for me. I take the LSD first, and then MDMA when the moment feels right, usually a few hours into the LSD experience. My doses are usually ~100-150ug LSD and 150mg MDMA.
