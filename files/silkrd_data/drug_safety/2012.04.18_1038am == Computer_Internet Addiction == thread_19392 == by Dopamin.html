				First at all, thanks to SR for one of the best experiences of my life, I love LSD :)<br /><br />I tried it because I was very interested in its effects, mostly the healing effects on ones psyche. I have a hardcore computer/internet addiction. I am online for 8-12 hours a day. When I wake up, I start playing. It is greatly influencing my social and economic life. I scraped through university and now I am a freelance communication trainer. I do presentation trainings for kids in school. Basic stuff.<br />I need your help. Do you have any approved methods how to reduce computer usage? Did you manage to reduce your computer usage? All the stuff one could find through google are, in my eyes, just shit.<br /><br />Thanks guys.

				Being on the computer 8-12 hours a day isn&#039;t necessarily addiction. I&#039;m on mine for that amount of time for work. If you&#039;re playing games then maybe you should cut back a bit and do something else. Maybe do some LSD outside on a nice day.

				More than anything else I think you just need to find other things you like doing. Go explore your other options! College is usually the broadening experience for most people, but it&#039;s never too late to expand your circle of interest. You can read books, go to concerts, go to social events, make art, etc. Just find other things you like to do.

				Photography helped me get out and enjoy the outdoors, meet new people (there are tons of photography groups everywhere), plus you can take really good pictures while on most drugs.

				I&#039;m addicted to knowledge and research, my personality type INTP, I blame it.<br />I&#039;ve had a computer constantly on my mind since I was very very young.<br /><br />Now it gets kind of boring, I see it more as a tool now. <br />I&#039;d much rather go socialize.<br />But when I was a teen and below, I *craved* it.<br /><br />Also, I wasn&#039;t an ugly nerdy teen, maybe nerdy but I still had plenty of girlfriends, I could barely put my mind on the PC when i was with them. Computers have always been attractive to me :P

				Before I started doing drugs as often as I do now (which is now a weekly thing), I&#039;d spend anywhere between 40-65+ hours a week on the computer or playing video games. The majority of this was related to work mind you, but it seriously took a tole on my social life for a while. Experimenting with drugs again has really brought me back to life, and my friends and co-workers can definitely notice an improvement. Drugs help me deal with the large amount of stress my body creates, along with my ADHD, anxiety, depression, and even my annoying passive-aggressive behavior which I know drives people crazy sometimes. I stay responsible with my drug use though, and take breaks when I feel it&#039;s needed. The key is moderation in my opinion, after getting over an addiction to amphetamine and tobacco I learned my lesson when it comes to addictive substances. So long as I steer clear of addictions and keep my body healthy, drugs really do help me with so much. :)

				I also had a computer addiction,though for me it was anime/manga that I was watching non stop. Then I had my first chemical drug experience with Methylphenidate and became conscious of my addiction for the very first time and I quit cold turkey.<br /><br />5 years later I still struggle with it but I found a few things to be rather helpful in lessening usage :<br /><br />1) Sport<br />2) Sex<br />3) Meditation<br /><br />

				Computers and the internet are excellent. They have conditioned our youths&#039; nervous systems so that they are no longer satisfied by linear drugs such as alcohol. We finally have the chance to know the whole truth. The human biocomputer will be restored to it&#039;s full glory and we will be able to use the internet connection within ourselves again soon (consciousness).

				Try offline projects, like picking up a sport, or get in shape for summer, or work on a car. Anything you can realistically accomplish and justify putting an effort into.

				First of all, thank you all for your response, may it have been the more or less constructive. Any answer shows interest and has its value.<br /><br />I see my computer use taking over me. And it might not be an illicit substance, but I am 100% sure that screens change the way your brain works. Can someone confirm this: I think that a long gaming session does the same to your brain and body than a mild dose of opiates.<br /><br />I am a freelancer, and I had a three day long training last week. That absolutely disconnected me for some days. A good start. Now I am back home, and I made it through my first morning without games/youtube/online distraction since... I can&#039;t recall, maybe 6 years? Usually I woke up, turned on the laptop, and started playing. Fuck. No project for uni, meeting with friends or party was as important than gaming. And I have a social life, well at least a rest of it... and a beautiful girlfriend. When I start my computer I flee from reality, if I can not change that I will fuck it all up.<br /><br />I see this thread as a home for people with similar problems. Feel free to post your own experiences. I think I will make this my personal space to reflect my progress.

				I have an internet problem and here&#039;s how I curbed my usage somewhat. I installed the Stay Focused add on for Chrome. The add on has customizable settings to restrict internet usage that can&#039;t be changed when your time runs out. I set it to restrict all internet browsing before 6 p.m. and after 12 a.m. I only get three hours of internet browsing on any site between these hours.<br /><br />If you find yourself sneaking internet usage with another browser you should probably uninstall it.<br /><br />When I find that I&#039;ve spent more time than I allowed myself on the internet I take it away from myself altogether for maybe a day or so. When I&#039;ve been doing well with the internet for a while I reward myself.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also set timers right when I get on the computer to monitor how long I&#039;ve been on the computer and when it&#039;s time to take a break. This doesn&#039;t work as well as the Stay Focused add on because I usually ignore them after turning them off.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m having trouble doing something about my cell phone because I use it to sneak the internet during my restricted hours. I get on it the moment that I wake up and lay in bed for a while just reading the news. I later get up make breakfast/ brush teeth/ shower/ exercise all while sneaking peeks at my phone.<br /><br />While this doesn&#039;t sound like I have a terrible relationship with the internet, it was much worse until these recent years. I used to spend every waking moment on the internet. I managed to lessen my usage by recognizing my problem and truly wanting to change it. I later focused on improving things that I had been neglecting in life like my body and home. Today I&#039;m doing better but I still slip up occasionally.<br /><br />I can definitely see what you mean when you say that browsing the internet could possibly release dopamine. (I think that I actually read a study confirming this once, maybe a Google search is in order.) I&#039;ve had those &quot;just one more video/ website&quot; moments that made me feel like a fiend.<br /><br />I hope that this helps.
