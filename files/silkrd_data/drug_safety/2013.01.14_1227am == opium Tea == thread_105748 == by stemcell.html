				In my limited experience...<br /><br />I started with 1 gram, and worked it up to where I like it.. 4.5 grams<br /><br />I also eat the pulp... its much easier when they are soft.. the last time I just put the 4.5 in the water and drank the whole thing.<br /><br /><br />I get a very nice vibe off of its. Its very relaxing...

				From my experience in the UK:-<br />Wait till late summer and snap off the dried pods in the fields. <br />When you get home, tap out all the seeds and earwigs!<br />Cut off the little lump under the pod which is too tough to grind and powderize about 20 in a blender. <br />Put the powder into a bodum coffee press.<br />Pour in boiling water with a squeeze of lemon to assist extraction and steep for half hour stirring a couple of times. <br />Press down the mesh, pour and drink. Easier said than done - it&#039;s probably the most revolting thing you&#039;ll ever taste until you get used to it! <br />Don&#039;t bother eating the sludge unless you really want to puke. Just do a second extraction if you must.<br /><br />I once collected aver 500 pods and drank tea every evening for a few weeks. It was nice at the time but when it was all gone the withdrawal effects were NASTY

				Whatever you do, don&#039;t try using corn poppies- the bright red poppies common in the UK, some friends did a vodka extraction on them and had major seizures after smoking/ vapourizing the extract, one nearly bit part of his tongue off! They contain a nasty active chemical that proper opium poppies don&#039;t have!

				I&#039;ve used tea for years, though only when it&#039;s in season. Growing them is offensively easy in Europe; just plant them in Feb and come back in July or so.<br /><br />For me, brewing 3-5 giganthemum pods (each one about 8cm tall, 4cm diameter) is enough, but I have access to consistently good quality pods and they can certainly get much weaker. So start low and keep in mind that it comes on slowly and kind of sneaks up on you.<br /><br />I steep it in warm water for an hour or so, drink it, and steep it again. I usually drink the second batch an hour or so after the first.<br /><br />It lasts a good 18 hours in total and you usually still feel quite high when you wake up the next day. In my opinion it is the most enjoyable - I certainly prefer it to H, codeine or vicodin because of the long duration and lovely sleepy dreamy quality. Colours look brighter and everything is fine! Haven&#039;t tried the more impressive prescription opiates though.<br /><br />I like to mix it with weed but smoke less than you normally would. The combo is amazing but can make you spin out quite quickly and I&#039;ve passed out cold on more than a few occasions.

				You don&#039;t even need to seed them, just wait for Spring and go for many walks where&nbsp; topsoil has been disturbed or dumped recently. <br />If you know of a quarry or major building site then just keep an eye on the earth heaps for the obvious cabbage-like leaves and large flowers. Purple or red or multicoloured. They will be among the first weeds that grow.<br />Some look like carnations and some like open roses but the mature pods are unmistakable.<br />Obviously avoid the little hairy ones that grow around crops.<br />As soon as the forum makes a bit more effing space, I&#039;ll post pictures!
