				Hello, as the title suggests, my dad is wanting to take MDMA. He has had heavy alcohol abuse in his past, and did suffer cardiac arrest from that at one point. The doctor has given him a clean bill of health several times, and he is very active, gardening, brush-hogging, general farm-work etc. I gave him what I estimate to be about 60mg (gave him 90mg, but I don&#039;t think it was that pure), and he did enjoy it, but it was real subtle. Anyway, what do you guys think as far as the safety of a full dose, 100-120mg of pure MDMA for the elderly?

				He should be alright as he is active. Give him some LSD man, smoke some DMT together. This will take your relationship to the next, next level.

He acts like he&#039;s not really prepared to revisit that, is afraid it wouldn&#039;t be good for him mentally (he still struggles with the booze). I don&#039;t really agree, but it&#039;s his mind. He did have some interest in DMT, and I actually gave him some at one point, he never smoked it, kind of lost his nerve.

				A good starting dose would be 1.5 mg/kg.<br />In other words that&#039;s 1.5mg&#039;s of MDMA per kilogram of body weight. <br />For example, if he weighs in at 80kg&#039;s, and good dose for him would be 120mg&#039;s. (1.5x80=120)<br /><br />If it&#039;s not as intense as he&#039;s like, you can always drop another 50/60mg&#039;s or so.

				Thanks for the input so far. As you can see I have a pretty good handle on target dosage ,I&#039;m more wondering if anyone has any comments/concerns about the safety, or even better, if someone has experience in the area.

				You can take the MDMA by simply measuring out the dose and putting it straight into your mouth and swallowing, but I really wouldn&#039;t recommend this as it tastes like hairspray. I usually crush the measured dose of crystals up into a fine powder and then wrap in a cigarette paper and swallow like a tablet. Or you can crush up the measured dose and pour into some juice and drink. You can snort the powder but I wouldn&#039;t recommend this ether as it its hurts and doesn&#039;t last as long.<br /><br />Make sure you:-<br />1) Measure out the MDMA correctly (using a 3 decimal scale if poss.) <br />2) Take on an empty stomach, wait +3hrs after you last ate something. <br />3) Follow some sort of pre/post load regime, as MDMA can very taxing for your brain and serotonin receptors. <br />4) Keep hydrated, but not to much. Sip through 1 pint of cold water every hour for 4 hours after it kicks in. <br /><br />Here is my pre/post load regime every time I take MDMA:<br />3DAYS PROIR<br />-MultiVitamin <br /><br />-2DAYS PROIR<br />-MultiVitamin<br /><br />1DAY PROIR <br />-MultiVitamin<br /><br />ON DAY OF ROLL<br />Wake up<br />-Vitamin E (500-1000iu)<br />-ALA (600mg) <br /><br />1 hours before drop <br />-Vitamin E (500-1000ui) <br />-ALA (1200mg) <br />-Vitamin C (1000mg) <br />-Piracetam (2400mg)<br />-Magnesium (500mg)<br />-Glass of grapefruit juice<br /><br />AS ROLL FINISHES<br />-150mg 5HTP<br />-1mg Xanax (to help with sleep)<br />-Vitamin E (1000ui)<br />-ALA (1200mg)<br />-Vitamin C (1000mg)<br />-Multivitamin <br />-Piracetam (1200mg)<br />-Magnesium (500mg)<br />-Tall glass of fatty milk<br /><br />FOR 2/3 DAYS AFTER ROLL<br />-150mg 5HTP<br />-Vitamin E (500-1000ui)<br />-ALA (1200mg)<br />-Multivitamin <br />-Piracetam (1200mg)<br /><br />There is a possibility he may suffer with a comedown. If you keep the dosage sensible and acquire some good MDMA, he shouldn&#039;t really experience one. If its his first time, he may even experience an afterglow.<br />I only ever get a comedown after doses exceeding ~160mg&#039;s, which makes me a bit more emotional than normal for about 2days afterwards. But this is easily fixed with about 150mg&#039;s of 5htp supplement and a diet that consists of a lot of red meats and full fat milk. <br /><br />What to expect:<br />T:30mins after drop of MDMA - Starting to come up, could start to feel overwhelmed, if so just tell him to think about happy things and in no time he will be rolling.<br />T1hr - Peaking, strong feelings of euphoria, empathy and openness. <br />T3hrs - starting to comedown, usually a gradual comedown which ends in sleep. But sometimes you can experience a &#039;crash&#039; where you all of a sudden feel very anxious. Follow the pre/post load regime to possibly avoid this.<br /><br />He may find it difficult to eat for up to 24hrs after taking it, but its best just to force as much food and fruit down as possible. Drink as much full fat milk as you can and eat as many red meats as you can. They contain high amounts of Tryptophan (a serotonin precursor).

				Ill advised for anyone with cardiac issues to take a strong CNS stimulant like MDMA.<br /><br />That said, dying while peaking on an empathogen could be incredibly spiritual.

				Agreed you need to be cautious if potential cardiac weakness - but awesome opportunity to do it with your dad :)<br /><br />Suggest do not exceed 1.5mg / kg in total and do not re-dose, and also make sure no other stimulant taken nearby - preferably nothing on the day (even tea or coffee).<br /><br />Protocol proposed by gtgeorgz is good, but suggest GHB instead of Xanax. This will also extend the roll without needing to re-dose and make for a gentler transition and integration.<br /><br />Given his history with alcohol this may serve in other ways too.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />
