				Hey guys,<br /><br />I just ordered 5g of 25I-NBOme from my supplier in China and since the dose is 500mcg the only logical thing to do seems to put it on paper. How would I go about doing that? Where can I buy the correct paper...or even paper with designs on it.<br /><br />I am leaving for Christmas Break so I won&#039;t be able to get fancy paper till I get back. Is their a ghetto way to do it. Or maybe even something I can buy off Amazon to use as paper even if its not perfect.<br /><br />Thanks <br /><br />Foxy Out&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />PS: I just bought some blotter from blotterart.com<br />http://blotterart.com/delicabylucifer.aspx<br /><br />I got 2 sheets of this one of an anime chick getting tentacle raped :PPPP I literally saw it and I&#039;m like okay...I&#039;m buying this.<br /><br />Now how do I put the chem on the paper when i get it.

				You also need them to be HPBCD-complexed to make them effective at the dose you mention.<br />

Without HPBCD they are still active sublingually. <br /><br />This is what I got off reddit<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All right. What you need to do is again, figure out how much liquid your blotter can absorb. I&#039;m assuming you have lots of blotter. Presumably at least two ten packs. (2000 hits) I&#039;m also assuming you have freebase NBOMe. If you have the salt, you need to warm up the water/alcohol before you mix and you do not need HPBCD as far as I know.<br />Get a pyrex or similar pan.<br />Get one gram of your NBOMe (complexed with HPBCD at 1NBOMe 1:8 HPBCD)*** and divvy it up into a solution of ~90% purity isopropyl alcohol or perhaps some high proof everclear would work just as well, where 1/2000 of your solution corresponds to ~500Î¼g.<br />NOTE: You need to know how much liquid you need for your blotter in order to do this accurately. Different blotter absorbs differently. (In my experience it&#039;s about 2ml per square.) You also need to be able to measure this liquid.<br />Once you&#039;ve done this, get your pyrex pan with enough solution for ~10 sheets and dip them evenly, raise then out and let excess solution drip out. Then you set them to dry on tinfoil etc. Avoid direct light during drying. It shouldn&#039;t take long due to the alcohol evaporating quickly.<br />If you&#039;ve measured correctly you shouldn&#039;t have much left in the pan. What is left should be collected for your own personal use--do not use it again. It&#039;s going to be very concentrated.<br />If you want to do small runs like two or three shits measure the amount of liquid and do it that way. Ie, 500mg would be 1000hits, so you want a solution of alcohol and NBOMe where 1/1000 of the solution would be 500mcg.<br />WARNING: 1# wear gloves.<br />WARNING: 2# do a small run with one sheet first--or even half a sheet. For example, 50mg/500mcg = 100 doses so dissolve 50mg into a solution of appropriate volume.<br />*** This may or may not be necessary when laying only a little bit, but with a lot your job will be easier doing this. It will work without it, but you&#039;ll have to do many, many applications and the &#039;dip&#039; method really wont work. IE you&#039;ll have to used a syringe.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />He PMed me and told me that 1.5mg (3 hits) worked perfectly. <br /><br />Nevertheless, I just put an add up for HPBCD on some B2B websites for the future to make it better. However, that probably won&#039;t be all done till january (have to find a vendor that without a ridiculous MOQ, have to negotiate, have to ship it, etc etc). So I think I will just stick with this for now. HPBCD has been mentioned a couple times to increase effectiveness but no one has said that it is required. I did some research and an erowid report says, http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=88880<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Preparation of substance for buccal/sublingual route of administration: The hydrochloride salt of 25C-NBOMe (6 mg) was dissolved in 105 microliters of methanol, after which 10 ul was spotted onto a blotter paper hole punch and dried, leaving approximately 600 ug of dried 25C-NBOMe adsorbed to the blot. At time zero, one blot was tucked in between the gum and the cheek and allowed to absorb for ~20 minutes before chewing the blot and discarding it&#039;s remains. During this time swallowing was kept to a minimum and no water was drunk.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think I should be fine.

				As far as I understand, 25I is hydrophobic, which means that it&#039;s not terribly soluble in water - you know, what your body is largely comprised of. You&#039;ll notice that they don&#039;t instruct you to dissolve anything in water. Absorbing the chemical is the other half of the equation - the HPBCD makes it less hydrophobic, and thus, more easily absorbable via the buccal route; this means a lower effective dose, which means you can sell a more effective product at a lower cost (since you&#039;ll be using less per dose).

I am definitely looking but for right now I am not going to be ultra fancy. The HPBCD will cost a lot more than the 25I because I will probably need to buy a kilo.
