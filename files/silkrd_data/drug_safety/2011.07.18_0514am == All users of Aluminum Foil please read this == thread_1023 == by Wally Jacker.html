				Hi folks!<br /><br />I wanted to pass on some important information about using tin foil to smoke your favorite &quot;products&quot;.<br /><br />First off it should be noted that whenever you put something on foil and chase it around with a straw as heat is applied underneath you really are not smoking.&nbsp; You are actually vaporizing.&nbsp; There&#039;s no combustion therefore there&#039;s no smoke, just vapor.<br /><br />But that&#039;s not the important part.&nbsp; Sorry if this is information you are already privy to.&nbsp; But in any case it bears repeating.<br /><br />You can poison yourself if you don&#039;t vaporize the right way when using aluminum foil!&nbsp; <br /><br />A friend of mine nearly died.&nbsp; His tongue had turned black, his liver distended and his pores were oozing toxins.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t want to go to the hospital but we forced him too.&nbsp; Good thing because he was nearly dead and we got there just in time.<br /><br />His blood had been heavlily contaminated from breathing aluminum vapor over a long period of time.&nbsp; Primarily from using cheap foil with a torch lighter. <br /><br /><br />Please observe the following suggestions:<br /><br />1) ALWAYS use heavy duty, good quality, brand name aluminum foil.<br />2) NEVER use a torch lighter or any other lighter that produces an unusually hot flame for vaporizing.<br />3) Keep the shiny side of the foil down and the dull side up.&nbsp; (Put your &quot;product&quot; on the dull side and heat the shiny side.)<br />4) ALWAYS &quot;stripe&quot; the foil prior to adding any &quot;product&quot; to it.&nbsp; You do this by slowly running a flame under the foil allowing it to burn off any contaminants.&nbsp; Stripe the entire piece of foil.<br />5) Use the minimum amount of flame that you can to get the job done.&nbsp; (This also saves &quot;product&quot;.)<br /><br />Happy chasing people.&nbsp; Stay safe.<br /><br />-WJ<br /><br />PS. Be good.&nbsp; ;)<br />

				@WJ good man for putting this up.<br /><br />fuck some tin foil!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />google &quot;the Ubie&quot; it&#039;s a small portable vaporizer that works for anything you don&#039;t want to directly burn. Looks like a straight up crack stem lol.<br /><br />normally i use it to smoke bho or bubble hash because it works so awesome.<br /><br />i recently used it to smoke a strong amount of fent, dose after dose. no residue and full extraction/containment of vapors.<br /><br /><br />~B~

				+1 for the Ubie, and get the twin pack deal. You get a discount and the spare is nice to have around in case you shattered the first or overused it.

				Stainless steel coffee stir spoons are small and fit the purpose greatly and can be reused over and over and are perfectly safe.&nbsp; They are small and can be fit inside a lot of devices.

				I believe your story as far as your friend somehow managed to poision himself, yet saying he smoked aluminum is (not wanting to offend you, but it&#039;s plain fact) UTTER BULLSHIT. You cannot get alumnium (let alone it&#039;s oxide, which is what the surface of the foil consists of) to boil. Al has a bp of ~2500 °C, Al2O3 has a bp of ~3000 °C.<br />I don&#039;t know what happened to your friend but I assume whatever he smoked has a pretty ugly contamination.<br />Please people do not pass the premise on as fact, because it will just add to the pool of junky myths that bear no resemblance to reality.<br /><br />You cannot die from putting a lighter unter aluminum foil and inhaling!

				I have also heard of aluminum foil giving Alzheimer&#039;s disease at a later age. Probably a well known fact - but I am new. I have never been picky about which side aluminum I use (not using it for the same &quot;product&quot;) though. Thanks for the information though - I have always been weary about smoking from tin foil, but when its the only thing around I dont seem to make too big of a deal about it.

				I&#039;ve watched Crystal Meth burn a hole straight threw foil many times...practically everytime.<br />I can see where someone didn&#039;t burn off the chemicals that are some times on cheap foil, but i always use the heavy duty grilling foil with the shiny and dull side, dull side up(smoking surface).<br /><br /><br />:D<br /><br />nomad bloodbath

				I&#039;ve only used the foil a few times and every time there was a distinct taste left in my mouth. I was sure that It couldn&#039;t be good for you.. Too bad aromatics isn&#039;t around any more so that I could try other options. I have an expensive milligram scale going to waste...

				I used to smoke coke off of foil.&nbsp; Never bad effects, but I wasn&#039;t a daily all day user like that.&nbsp; But, I do know people that get headaches from smoking out of cans too much.&nbsp; I much prefer glass for smoking anything and everything.
