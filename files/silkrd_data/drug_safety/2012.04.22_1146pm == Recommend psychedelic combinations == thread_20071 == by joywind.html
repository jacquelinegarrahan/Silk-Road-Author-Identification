				I&#039;m sure everyone here has combined LSD with MDMA, but I am curious about the effects of less common combinations, such as Salvia and DMT, or ayahuasca and mushrooms, or LSD and ketamine, etc.<br /><br />I have tried:<br /><br />Cannabis (oral ingestion) + LSD : I didn&#039;t enjoy this combination, but I don&#039;t like cannabis in the first place<br />Salvia (sublingual) + LSD : didn&#039;t notice anything appreciably different from taking LSD by itself<br />LSD + MDMA : good but not as enjoyable as higher doses of LSD<br />LSD + magic mushrooms : this combination is worth repeating

				Personally I find that these were quite enjoyable:<br /><br />1.) LSD + Cannabis: May seem a bit simple but hear me out. Half an hour to 45 minutes after ingesting the blotter/gummies/banana chips or whatever form your Lucy comes in, begin smoking weed. Go for around 2-4 bowls and then at the 2 hour point repeat and repeat again at the 4 hour point and during the comedown to help you relax and let sleep come a bit easier. LSD &amp; weed are surprisingly synergistic and they each enhance each other very well. The only problem is that too much weed can make it easier to forget what you were saying or thinking and might put ya into a loop. Music in itself with this combo is an absolute treat.<br />2.) LSD + MDMA + a little bit of weed: Ingest your Lucy for the trip, then at the one-and-a-half hour marker, take your MDMA. This should line up the peaks for both fairly well. I say smoke a little bit of weed for the reason that too much can kinda dull the MDMA &#039;s effects while making it too easy to focus more on the LSD.<br />3.) 25I-NBOMe + Weed + MDMA: MDMA &amp; 25I made a great couple for me. The energy and euphoria I felt was through the roof and for an entire evening, my life was magical. Smoke some weed all throughout if you&#039;d like, but definitely have it ready for the comedown.

				I&#039;ve done plenty of psychs in my time but the one trip that I&#039;ll always remember was when I did 2ci/MDMA I was seeing the most beautiful fractals and geometrical shapes both CE/OE and then my friend handed me a balloon with nitrous even though he knew I was against doing nitrous because I felt it was just a dumb drug to do (I mean they use it on kids at the dentist for god&#039;s sake), I honestly felt like nitrous was a joke and would ruin the trip for me. Anyway, so I was rolling pretty hard from the MDMA and had my guard down so I took the balloon and took a good hit, held it in and closed my eyes.......heaven is a pretty cool place.

				Magic mushrooms and a little bit of weed. I don&#039;t really seem to be able to trip any more without the weed even at high doses. I&#039;ve done mushrooms many times thanks to some very nice local cows :) but the raw psilocybin doesn&#039;t really do it for me. At 1 hr when I know what the peak of the mushroom is I smoke a single cone or perhaps 2 if the weed is not that good. This shifts the trip to another plane completely - It has literally left me flat on my back &amp; fuckin&#039; speechless! This is a great combo for a low dose of mushrooms- really fun especially with some good music. It is also good at high doses if you want to have an epiphany type experience. Be careful not to smoke too much though as the excess THC will kill the mushroom. Smoking again at about +3 hrs as the initial high wears off can be good if the trip has been a good one but sometimes it has been nice to come back down a bit if I&#039;ve been having my ass kicked.<br />Highly recommend the mushrooms with lemon juice as it definitely seems to make the most of the psilo.<br />Enjoy and homage to the cow!
