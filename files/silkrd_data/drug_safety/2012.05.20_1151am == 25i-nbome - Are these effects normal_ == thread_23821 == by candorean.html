				For one, I noticed I have a lingering &quot;smell&quot; in my nose that ONLY occurs on 25i. It is completely unique to 25i and I couldn&#039;t compare it to anything from real life either. Neither lsd nor shrooms leaves this smell. It comes out about 30 minutes after I dose and it pretty much indicates that my trip has started. The first few times I tried nbome, it was a fantastic aroma but it has become a little tiresome. At 500ug, it&#039;s not a big deal but when I dose at 1mg it&#039;s more intrusive to be honest. What could be causing this smell?<br /><br />Also, has anyone checked their itouch/iphones while on it? For me, each icon on the homescreen appears to be wriggling like it&#039;s ready to be moved and the second I blink, the icons appear to be waving as if they were flags. I was jogging the other day and I pulled out my itouch to change the songs... but the entire screen looked 3D. Almost as if I were looking through glass. I stared at it for probably a good 10 minutes looking like an idiot on the trail haha. Meanwhile, the leaves on the trees around me were morphing colors from green to grey to blue and back while the branches seemed to be wriggling like arms. Shadows also seem to be appearing and disappearing as if the sun were gone from one second to another. These visuals have grown on me and I love seeing them whenever I dose.<br /><br />Lastly, my gums seem to feel a little sensitive. If I press my tongue at the roof, it gives me a weird sensation.<br /><br />Let me know if these effects ring a bell to anyone else (you know, since everybody is making 25i threads recently)

				And if anyone was wondering, I took it at noon yesterday. It is now 6 in the morning and I still can&#039;t sleep. Never had this insomnia happen before but I don&#039;t feel sleepy at all. I&#039;ll prob crash soon though

				I&#039;m not quite sure about that smell.&nbsp; I definitely get a metallic taste in my mouth sometimes, but no smell.&nbsp; I also have looked at my iPhone and been blown away by the visuals.&nbsp; Listen to some music with psychedelic album artwork through headphones and watch the artwork &quot;dance&quot; to the music.&nbsp; Also, you should see that new iPad banner on the Apple website when you&#039;re tripping.&nbsp; You know, the one with the pink flower?&nbsp; At first I thought it was a .gif.&nbsp; Hahaha.

				Try playing Speedx 3D, you&#039;ll be blown away :D Kaleidoscope (for Android) is great too.<br />About tripping out on things: I always go to a park when tripping (because it&#039;s not far from my house and it&#039;s always empty after 4-5 pm) and the people living around there are almost used to seeing a guy looking at things for 10 minutes straight while trying to smoke a unlit cigarette lol.<br /><br />25I numbs your mouth, maybe this is the strange sensation? It&#039;s a bit annoying for me, but it usually goes away in 30 minutes after you spit/swallow the blotter.

				Candorean, I know exactly what you&#039;re talking about with the smell.<br /><br />For me it seems to be common with all the Phenethylamines, each giving off a similar &#039;smell&#039; with different tinges or flavours, but they&#039;re all closely related.<br /><br />Have you taken any 2c-x&#039;s and found they have a smell?

I heard they have a mind-fuck quality that I dislike. LSD has scared me a few times and gave me delusions that I was that amnesiac guy from Memento (it probably wasn&#039;t a coincidence that I watched the movie only a few days earlier). Fuck ever doing that again.

				lmfao, That&#039;s hilarious and I&#039;m sorry :(<br /><br />For me, 2c-b was not a mind fuck at all. It was a very in the moment kind of psychedelic trip, with my thoughts wandering no farther than my surroundings.
