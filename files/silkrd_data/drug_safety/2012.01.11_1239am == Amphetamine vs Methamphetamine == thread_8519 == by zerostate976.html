				Meth compared to a high dose of dexedrine is pretty similar, the main difference between the two high wise, between pharms and meth is meth feels cleaner, more euphoric, and has less side effects, and depending on ROA lasts longer. I&#039;ve never orally dosed meth, so idk how oral meth compares to amphetamine, but snorted and smoked meth are both &quot;better&quot; than regular amph IMO, although snorting meth IMO isn&#039;t a whole lot better than pharms, smoking it is a whole hell of a lot more fun than amphetamine though, smoked methamphetamine is a lot more euphoric and fun than snorted or oral amph (and you cant smoke amphetamine).....<br />Snorted meth vs snorted amph is hard to tell apart IMO, if you dont count the distinctive intense burn methamphetamine has when snorted...<br />Methamphetamine is more potent, easier to make, and its a more desirable product, euro speed is cut way more than street meth is on average guaranteed..<br />

And if you&#039;ve never done either... Please try regular amphetamine before going to meth... I&#039;ve never done meth myself, but after reading a lot about it I found it&#039;s far more addictive and stuff then the normal amphetamine... And I already find that quite habit-forming so yea....<br />If you are in NL yourself (or nearby) I can highly recommend AAkoven&#039;s speed. This &#039;new&#039; batch is real good! (experience)<br />Amphetamines are never 100% pure, unless you buy aderall or something... And it depends on what you want the speed to do for you... I don&#039;t have a proper mg-scale so I can&#039;t tell you how much of AA&#039;s amphetamine I take... Like the small point of a key, sometimes I get it right, sometimes a don&#039;t take enough (better too little then too much right) but then just redose after an hour or so...<br />If you&#039;re looking to study, or get work done, take a lower dose, if you&#039;re looking to party/have a good time take a higher dose... That would be my advise... Because with higher dose I really notice the increase in confidence and euphoria, and a need to dance or move around.... <br />At lower doses I just feel like I can really focus on my homework, and learning for exams and stuff...<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;m still considering trying meth once... But if I were you I would definitely use amphetamine a few times, and see how you go on that before going to meth, since (again) meth is way more potent, way heavier, way more euphoric, and thus far more addictive...<br /><br />EDIT: Might be worth noticing I always take my speed orally... It provides smoother come-up and come-down, also longer peaking... Which I like... snorting gives a much shorter come-up, higher but shorter peak, and harsher come-down... I simply measure the stuff off with a key, but it in my mouth and quickly swallow with water... Because taste is REAL nasty (although that does somehow give me some sort of kick haha XD)

				I took some of the meth I had orally. It works fine. You don&#039;t get a rush like from shooting or smoking of course. It&#039;s like pharm amphetamines but lasts longer. Good for work or study to improve focus and energy. Don&#039;t smoke or IV any drug you don&#039;t want to get hooked on.

				<br />IMO the difference between meth and amphetamine isnt NEARLY as big as you&#039;re making it out to be, not close, but i&#039;ve only ever had pharmaceutical amphetamine products (mostly used dexedrine, done adderall and vyvanse as well, but only ever when i was out of dexedrine...and used street crystal methamphetamine/glass a few times so far since i had it become available to me) and not street amphetamine ever, but comparing meth to pharms, i wouldn&#039;t say meth is all that much more potent. It is, dont get me wrong, but its not nearly as big a difference IMO as you seem think if you&#039;re just snorting it (i&#039;ve only snorted and smoked in my limited experience using methamphetamine so far, mostly smoked...smoking is a lot stronger than pharms...dat rush...)<br />If you&#039;re going to decide to use meth and cross the line from just pharm use over using a hard drug/meth, you may as well smoke it or bang it (i intend on banging some next time i acquire more, never shot anything so far...) and get the full high that methamphetamine has to offer, by taking advantage of methamphetamine&#039;s ability to cross the BBB better than amphetamine, and to use the ROAs that get it in your bloodstream as quickly as possible and as efficiently as possible (smoking or injection)...<br />What i mean is, meth is pretty much the most harmful out of the common street drugs, by far (and i&#039;m pro meth/like the shit and intend on getting more as soon as i can) and its also one of the most addictive drugs known to man (and its addictive regardless of ROA)...so why would you not wanna get the full intensity high if you&#039;re going to use it....its crystal meth still no matter what way you use it, so you may as well get as intense a high as you can get when you do use it...i dont think that snorting even compares with smoking, and i havent tried IV yet, but should be trying that soon as i get more....

				zerostate976 the main reason you see more amphetamine from europe and meth from the usa is due to the availability of the precursor elements to make them. some are more readily available in one place versus the other. <br /><br />basically amphetamine produces more of a physical get up and go high that can sometimes feel &#039;dirty&#039;. meth on the other hand is more cerebral and &#039;in your head&#039; but very clean. if i had to choose i would take high quality speed over meth any day. it&#039;s possible i am not getting the full effects of meth because i only snort and have never smoked/injected it but i would rather not go down that road. if it&#039;s anything like smoking freebase versus snorting coke than i&#039;m not interested because i&#039;ve already been down that road...<br />

				personally, when i did meth for the first time, it wasnt any large amounts, and always snorted. it was a subtle buzz, and i felt like maybe i hadn&#039;t done enough. i was at a party, meant to do a few more hairlines, but then got caught up in a conversation about a topic i would normally have had nothing to say about. needless to say, it was at that point i realized i was high. lol<br /><br />i dunno, i prefer speed, cos i worry about the whole neurological damage thing with meth... even though that could just be overhyped.

				I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURE SO CORRECT ME IF I&#039;M WRONG...<br />But I believe &quot;Speed&quot; is Amphetamine Sulphate and &quot;Meth&quot; is Methamphetamine Hydrochloride. They&#039;re molecularly identical, except Methamphetamine has a methyl group attached to it&#039;s nitrogen molecule. The methyl group is the reason Methamphetamine&#039;s effects are stronger and last longer than Amphetamine, because it allows the substance to pass more easily through the blood-brain barrier. Not only that, it severely hinders the recycling process that would normally destroy the excess chemicals that Methamphetamine causes your brain to produce. <br />Another significant difference is that Amphetamine Sulphate cannot be vaporized/smoked, while Methamphetamine Hydrochloride can. I think that&#039;s one of the main reasons alot of people prefer Methamphetamine, because they like to smoke it. I&#039;ve never tried the Speed Paste, so I don&#039;t really know from experience.

Dextroamphetamine produces almost identical stimulant effects on the Central Nervous System as Methamphetamine does, but with a with a weaker-feeling euphoria, or no euphoria at all.

				uh nope.<br />Methamphetamine IS more neurotoxic W/W than amphetamine. Definitely.<br />I&#039;ll promise to do more lit search later, but this should suffice for now:<br />hxxp://www.acnp.org/g4/gn401000166/ch162.htm<br /><br />Also handy tips on how to reduce said DA/SER toxicity.

				I&#039;m no expert on the comparative neurotoxicity, but in terms of effects they are pretty much the same. Not identical perhaps, but the differences are pretty subtle and only really describable by someone with experience, much like the difference between a bottle of $20 wine and a bottle of chateau la tour. lol....these drugs might feel different from one day to the next anyway depending on other factors like environment, mood, having a drink or a smoke etc. <br /><br />Obv meth is way stronger, but way more expensive as well. so it evens out. even the best sulphate/paste is rarely more than about 50% pure, plus on the street in Europe it&#039;s often cut with glucose or some other shit anyway. but it balances out when you consider the price.<br /><br />I don&#039;t inject but I&#039;ve seen many people inject street speed in europe and lots of problems from it cos of the inherent impurity and additional adulterants.<br /><br />Is this worse than than the inherent neurotoxicity of meth? dunno, ask someone who has experience jacking up both. but i personally would be more comfortable with the meth in this case. At least you know what it is.<br /><br />If you&#039;re eating it or snorting it, then its more or less the same - just different quantities needed for the same effect.
