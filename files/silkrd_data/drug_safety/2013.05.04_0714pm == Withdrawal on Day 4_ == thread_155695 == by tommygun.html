				I would consider myself a mild to maybe moderate opiate user.&nbsp; I have been actively trying to keep addiction at bay, limiting use to no more than 2 days in a row and breaking for 2,3 days in between.&nbsp; Usually 25mg hydrocodone or 15-20 oxy, once per day.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t experience full blown WDs .. well until yesterday.&nbsp; It was still probably mild compared to what other experience, I know.&nbsp; <br /><br />It caught me really off guard as it was on day 4..Days 1,2,3 were just some shivers, but not really anything else (but the longing to do it).&nbsp; On the night of Day 3 I did do a few bumps of coke..<br /><br />Yesterday, day 4 started out fine but as the day progressed I began to feel more and more nausea and weakness.&nbsp; Lead to vomiting and achyness.<br /><br />Was this WD?&nbsp; Was it agrivated by the coke perhaps?&nbsp; I ended up taking 10mg of hydro just to get some relief... and today I have felt progressively better.&nbsp; I guess its possible I had a bug.. but was .. different.<br /><br />Just curious and everything I have read says day 1/2&nbsp; can be the worst..

				sorry for your troubles mate :(<br /><br />I was a heavy opiate user, and had withdrawal symptoms last for well over 30 days ... given what you&#039;ve said about your usage, and taking into account that every person is different, I would expect to be completely symptom free in 7-10 days if I were you.<br /><br />It&#039;s a horrible thing to go through, just try to remember the feeling so that maybe it will dissuade you from habitual use in the future.

				For me and many others, it&#039;s classically day 3/4 that is the worse if you are coming off heroin. Methadone, it takes about 10-14 days to get over the worse if you&#039;re on a small dose.<br /><br />Leaving 2-3 days between using is NO WHERE NEAR a big enough gap. I reckon if you use more than once in 2 weeks then you body will become addicted to the habitual feeling of opiates.<br /><br />My advice? Make the most of your chances and break clean now. Don&#039;t use more than once a month. Thank your lucky stars you didn&#039;t end up with a full blown opiate habit.<br /><br />Good luck.

				withdrawals are different for everyone but yes it does sound like you went through withdrawal<br /><br />the symptoms are usually fairly regular for opiate withdrawal however some experience it for much longer than others, I myself have never had withdrawals last more than 5 days (typically 3-4 days) even when using 1-2 grams of SR quality #4 heroin every week<br /><br />I usually just get extremely restless legs to the point where I don&#039;t sleep for 3 days at least.. its annoying as fuck but I&#039;m glad it doesn&#039;t last weeks or months like it does for some people.. knowing it will only last about 4 days helps me get through it<br /><br />if you want to lessen the withdrawal symptoms there are plenty of medications which will help.. loperamide works very well.. most people think loperamide only helps with the diarrhea but it actually helps with a lot of the other symptoms like restlessness<br /><br />I also find benadryl anti-histamines help you fall asleep (just don&#039;t take more than 300mg as it can act as a deliriant and keep you awake) and I always have anti-histamines on hand because they get rid of the opiate itch for me<br /><br />and I doubt the coke made it any worse, I&#039;ve taken many non-opiate drugs while in withdrawal and they never &quot;reset&quot; my withdrawals like taking opiates would

				Subs, you NEED suboxone, They will keep WD sypmtoms tame, until you can kick it all. Good luck, nothing worse than kicking opiates.

				Best of luck mate. I know what your going through I have had a habit 20 years +, and have had to withdraw a few times and its not nice. <br />As already said don&#039;t use more than once a month and I&#039;m sure you will do Ok, you really don&#039;t want to get a full on habit.<br />The craving is bad, but for me my legs sent me nuts the ache is a head wrecker. I had to withdraw once in Malaysia 6 days in a beautiful place and I could not leave the Chalet then had a 12 hr flight still Clucking like mad, it was not nice. Sadly I have another Smack habit now, I am kind of getting the idea that I will always be a Junkie, the trouble is I LOVE Heroin.

				kratom is a good option for those experiencing opiate withdrawals, or for addicts trying to quit. it&#039;s a plant in the coffee family, rich in antioxidants. it&#039;s an opioid agonist as well as a potent immunostimulant. lower doses are somewhat stimulating due to the yohimbe alkaloids, while higher doses are more sedating. i highly recommend it for those seeking a natural treatment for depression, anxiety, chronic pain, etc. it has even been used successfully to treat addiction.
