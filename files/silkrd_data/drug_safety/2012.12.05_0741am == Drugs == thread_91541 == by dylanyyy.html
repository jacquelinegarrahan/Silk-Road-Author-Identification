				I am new to Silk Road and am looking to make my first purchase. I have dabbled with drugs-- I have done Molly one, Ecstasy once, fake shrooms once and real shrooms once (although I smoke a shit ton of weed)-- and I have these 5 items in my shopping cart<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f774da102e&nbsp; --&nbsp; DOB blotter<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/db9006a6ed&nbsp; --&nbsp; 25B-NBOMe<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b95dbfe400&nbsp; --&nbsp; 2g Ch w/o MAOI (also, why is this free?)<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/43e9a7a589&nbsp; --&nbsp; DOC<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/eb975e003c&nbsp; --&nbsp; LSD<br /><br />I have always wanted to do acid. Also, I have a bit of a monetary limit, so I will only be purchasing 1 of the 5 items (unless I figure out that that one listing is actually free).<br /><br />So, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions. Also, if you are going to suggest something, I would also appreciate an explanation as to why.<br /><br />I have also been thinking about setting up a PO box (I live in the US) just for piece of mind, but if you don&#039;t use a PO box and have experienced 0 problems then tell me so.<br /><br />This is also my first time EVER posting on an online forum. Yay.<br /><br />Thanks.

				LSD, on your name, no PO box.<br /><br />Encrypt your address and make sure the vendor you are ordering from has more than 300 transactions and feedback over 97.<br /><br />You should be alright.

				also, agree that you should get LSD, but make sure to check out the avengers thread so you can find out info about the different vendors that sell LSD. for example, some have very clean stuff, with great trip reports from many people, while others are selling bunk shit. dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0 hope this helps :)

				I think the item you think is free is a custom listing for another person.&nbsp; That order might get canceled by the vendor.

				I would also recommend trying LSD before purchasing any of those research chemicals. I&#039;ve tried DOB, DOC, and NBOMe, and they&#039;re pretty shitty compared with acid. People have had fatal overdoses on NBOME, while the toxicity level of DOC and DOB has never been established. DOC and DOB are known to cause chest pains, vasoconstriction, and at least one case of respiratory failure.&nbsp; No one has ever died from an LSD overdose, as far as I know. It&#039;s actually less toxic than caffeine.<br /><br />Before ordering LSD from a vendor, you should search the forums to see if the vendor is reliable. <br /><br />Also check out the Avengers LSD Vendors Review thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0

				I love lsd and i would recommend it first, but i wouldn&#039;t knock 25b-nbome if you go to the right vendor. When it comes to the nbomes I&#039;ve notice people tend to have problems when they get un even tabs. Which is understandable since they take one tab and feel a certain intensity of high and expect the second tab to hit the same.<br /><br />There is one vendor that i have received even tabs every time and that vendor is ENBOOM. They are currently on vacation, but i would highly recommend their tabs for the first time since they are lower dose than the other vendors.

				Get some molly! The shit you did probably sucked and a good roll is fucking incredible, you&#039;re guaranteed to have a good time. Split it with a couple people you&#039;re close with and it&#039;ll be cheap and so much fun, explosions of love and softness and shit. The way I see it too, acid isn&#039;t really fun (not that it&#039;s not), it&#039;s more of a holy shit i&#039;m tripping balls type deal. Just depends what you&#039;re looking for but molly&#039;s got my vote! <br /><br />Ps. <br />&nbsp;<br />Stay away from the research chems, they&#039;re way more harmful and way less fun than real drugs. Unless you really want to experiment, stick with the cid.
