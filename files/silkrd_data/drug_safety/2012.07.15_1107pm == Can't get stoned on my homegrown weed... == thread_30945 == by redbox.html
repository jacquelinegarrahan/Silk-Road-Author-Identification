You could also post pics of it for us to see. Samples can be sent to Labs to find out the ratio of THC. If you`re not getting high off it, you may have not cured it properly.&nbsp;

				Easiest way is to get 10.00 g and make hash with it. Use maths to figure out the % :)

				If your smoking a bunch and not getting stoned, chances are not many others will. Why not toke with a buddy and see what they think?<br />You could of harvested too early or too late. Did you check the trichomes with a magnifying glass to see if they were optimal for harvest?<br />Could be shitty bad seed if thats what you grew from too. Or shitty growing conditions. Dont think other people trying it will make a difference but fixing the problem will. Especially since you&#039;re the grower and one who ultimately decides the outcome of the product. Id say figure out why da fuck you aint getting stoned silly and fix it! grow on!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />...But im a little confused here. You say you cant get stoned in the titled but the body sounds like you just want a number of people to grade your weed. Have a weed party and make sure no one forgets to tell you what they think about it. haha

				&nbsp; &nbsp;if this is the case its honestly likely low quality. keep on growing and research proper nutrients to use at the right time. make sure your using correct light cycles. make sure your using the correct type of lights: High pressure sodium for flowering is VERY important. use good high quality soil. in short there are many factors that come into account when growing high potency marijuana. keep on doing it and it will pay off. it took me 3 batches to start growing FIRE weed. but now that i have it down i know exactly what strains i like and how to grow them perfectly to their full potential. after you get to this point its very easy and routine and extreme quality. good luck!
