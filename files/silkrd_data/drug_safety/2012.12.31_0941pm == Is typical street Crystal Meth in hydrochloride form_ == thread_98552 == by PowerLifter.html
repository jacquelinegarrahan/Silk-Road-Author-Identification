				I&#039;d rather not smoke it or inject it. I just want to take break it apart into small milligrams doses and eat it in capsules.<br /><br />Is the typical crystal meth found on the streets in hydrochloride form? That is, is it Methamphetamine Hydrochloride? Water soluble right? Meaning it can be snorted or eaten.

				All meth that I have ever heard of can be snorted, eaten, or plugged. Hell if you can find a way to hold it under your arms for a period of time it will be absorbed by your body and you will definitely feel the meth buzz strong. <br /><br />Eating it the way your talking about is actually one of the safest ways to ingest your meth and it has longer legs that way as well. Good luck and be safe!<br /><br />You can eat a bit more and it&#039;s more forgiving if eaten say you can dose around 50 to 100 mg orally and feel pretty good for quite a long time. It depends on if your doing shake&#039;n&#039;bake dope or some real ice type stuff. There&#039;s some difference in cleanliness between the two and potency is stronger with the good ice type shit then with the shake n bake shit. Your better off getting the real professional grade meth that they sell from SR then you are doing anything that looks like a bag of whit powder. Some of these ICE makers use the real lab grade chems to make the superior cleaner product then them trailer park chemist with their dirty bottles and suspect chemicals.<br /><br />I had a friend that made his own dope by shaking the bottle and he and his old lady never did their dope any other way but to eat it. He was taught how to make it by the guy who taught me. He was a real chemist with his process. He always used the same ingredients and weighed out everything and always bought new bottles for each new batch. We always only would do a batch if we could have everything ready to do at least three boxes at a time. Our shit always came out a solid bright white in color except for thi one time when he accidentally put too much smoke on one of the mixtures and it turned that batch a shade of pink but the shit was fire and it sold out that night. We knew what we were doing. We weren&#039;t just hiding out in a garage or hotel room dying to get a batch made so we could get tweaked out all night. No. We were doing this with patience and caution making sure to be watching for bottles to spring leaks or anything else that we needed to fix right away. This is a serious thing and we didn&#039;t take it lightly plus we had to be on look out for any of the wrong type of people to walk up on us.<br /><br />after about an hour and a half to two hours we were on the road but yes we tested our product first. We didn&#039;t do any of it to get high but we always like to check it on the foil to see how well it burned and cracked back and we did taste it for impurities so we could set our price for it. Of course we split the amount up between us. 3Boxes almost always got us4.5 to 5 grams of the whitest best purest meth in our county. Yea we had it locked down and our stuff was fought over and we had a hard time dealing with folks once they got word we were in town with some of that good shit. We would use a vice to press our meth into flat cracker pieces that weighed .5 grams each and it would smoke down to clear and always crack back to the point it would flake from the foil and look like a clear flake falling around.<br /><br />we ha it locked down because we always used the same ingredients where as the other cooks would use anything they could to make it work so our meth was always consistent and more potent because we had that pride in our product.&nbsp; We were out a lot toward the end because it got harder and harder to get people to smurph for us and those that did wanted to start charging a lot more for each box of ephedrine. <br /><br />The Ice you can get from the road is a lot like Walter white breaking bad type stuff man and I am thinking it&#039;s made using 55 barrel drums of P2P or something like that. It&#039;s being made by some real professionals and maybe it&#039;s cartel dope so it&#039;s of a higher standard than the street shit around my town. So I only get my meth from off the road from now on because nobody knows about it when I get it except for my fortunate friends who I trust and also nobody can ever see me hanging out in the wrong area with the wrong crowd and that&#039;s a really great thing to help clean up my reputation and trust me i built up quite the rep before finding the road. <br /><br />I would say yes to the question is typical street crystal meth in hydrochloride form at least it is in my area. Can&#039;t you tell by looking at your street dope?&nbsp; The shit I used to cook was definitely the kind that was HCL form but it could be smoked. I think it&#039;s all in HCL form even if it&#039;s shards but I could be wrong about that. Ask around further tho I&#039;d like to see what others would have to say on this matter.
