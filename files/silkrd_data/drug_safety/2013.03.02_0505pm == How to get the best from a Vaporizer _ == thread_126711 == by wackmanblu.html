				So I bought an Arizer Solo the other week because I kept hearing how much more I could get out of my weed by using a vaporizer, not to mention the health benefits of avoiding carcinogens.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m finding that opposite is true, I&#039;m using twice the amount, to get not nearly the same high. I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m doing something wrong so I thought I would consult with the trusty SR community and get some sound advise.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />First of all, this Vap has got some high ratings from the reviews. It&#039;s portable with glass whips and only takes a minute to get to temperature. I&#039;m filling it up with about 1/3 of a joints worth of weed at a time - small amounts in my opinion but I can&#039;t physically put more in without &#039;stuffing&#039; it all together and not leaving enough room for air circulation. I crumble the weed up into small little loose bits and simply &#039;drop&#039; it into the chamber of the glass tube without &#039;packing&#039; it down. I insert the tube into the unit and wait for the temperature to get to the 5 setting and then wait 30 more seconds before taking a draw. When I pull from the tube, I&#039;m doing it &#039;cigar style&#039; meaning that I suck a breath worths into my mouth and then inhale. I wait another 15 seconds until the temperature light indicates that the unit is back up to temp. setting and then take another draw. I repeat this process until I taste the weed getting burnt or dark, it takes at least 12 minutes and about 20 pulls (at which point the solo turns off automatically) <br /><br />The first few pulls are pretty good; some nice vapor is exhaled, although the first breath I can&#039;t even see the vapor, the second onward I can see some vapor fumes coming out of the glass tube and in my exhale. The longer I go the smokier the vapor becomes and the darker it tastes. Here&#039;s one of my first doubts - How do I know when the THC is used up? It seems that I could just raise the temperature and keep going until hell freezes over but the vapor just tastes burnt and gets smokier. If I was to smoke a regular joint I would be pretty high after it was done (about 8 minutes and 10 or 12 pulls), but even after I&#039;ve reloaded the solo with the same amount of weed 3 or 4 times (about 40 minutes and dozens of pulls) and I&#039;m getting about half the same high with lesser intensity . <br /><br />Am I trying to too hard? like should I let the weed bake in the vap for longer periods of 30 sec to a minute between each draw? Should I be turning the heat up after 5 or so pulls to get more out of it? Should I be packing it more into the chamber?<br /><br />Help me SR community - I hate to think I&#039;m wasting one of our most precious natural resources.

				Here&#039;s my experience: set to 3 for weed, or 4 for hash, I don&#039;t need to wait between draws any longer then I hold the vapor in for - about 15-20 seconds.<br /><br />Initially, the draw was very restricted, but loosed up over time, it&#039;s comfortable for a slow inhale. Specifically, a long, slow inhale into your lungs, just let them pull it in. You can &quot;pump&quot; cigar style, but that&#039;s only if the draw it really tough.<br /><br />Packing it is key - grind fine, but not powdery, and make sure you don&#039;t block the 4 holes. This is where a screen helps, just holding the material out from accidentally &quot;plugging&quot; them. I clean the screen with a needle, which I also use to check the holes in the heating half.<br /><br />Done this way, I can plenty of vapor, such that looking down the stem it&#039;s opaque.<br /><br />I have strong lungs, its possible I&#039;m just comfortable with the pressure it takes to draw in a lungful. But it really does keep up with me in terms of temperature. The low sped only means that it doesn&#039;t get cooled by excessive airflow, so all the heat goes into latent energy vaporizing THC.

				In terms of getting the best high from a vaporizer it depends entirely on the vape. Each one takes a certain knowledge and experience to get it hitting optimally. Trial &amp; error, trial &amp; error -- unless you know someone with the same one. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126711.msg873270#msg873270">Quote from: wackmanblu on March 02, 2013, 05:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So I bought an Arizer Solo the other week because I kept hearing how much more I could get out of my weed by using a vaporizer, not to mention the health benefits of avoiding carcinogens.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m finding that opposite is true, I&#039;m using twice the amount, to get not nearly the same high.

IMO, they are best served for use by actual medicinal patients. That said, I fucking love using home vapes that can produce nice thick, clean, tasty vapor. With every portable vape I&#039;ve used it would take me literally 20-30 minutes of vaping to get near the optimal high I was looking for. So much more portable.. They cost so much compared to the quality and density of vapor produced, and really only save you weed because you will get frustrated and quit before you&#039;re as high as you&#039;d like to be. Even though the Arizer is a top-shelf portable, almost all home vapes for the same price will shit on it. I have sold all of my portables, and stuck with only my favorite base vapes, which get me way beyond what portables can do in minutes. <br /><br />I posted this in another vape thread:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=29836.msg868669#msg868669">Quote from: DMTisinME on February 28, 2013, 07:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Vape xhale cloud is the best on the market now. Roughly same price as the volcano, but much better. $450-600 depending on the attachments you get. <br /><br />For mid-price range, the PLENTY vape is excellent @ $315 from ezvapes with their standard coupon. <br /><br />For low level, the Extreme-Q is great for the price. I got it for $164 from ezvapes or vapeworld. I don&#039;t remeber, but they had a &quot;price match&quot; guarantee, so I just found it on some sketchy site, and they matched it with great shipping and legitimacy. <br /><br />I don&#039;t vape on the go, so I have nothing to say about portables. IMO, they never hit as hard as I&#039;d like and for the money you&#039;re better off getting a plug-in one. Also, spend the money and don&#039;t get anything less than what I&#039;ve recommended.. you won&#039;t regret it. <br /><br />Also, I have nothing but good things to say for both vapeworld and ezvapes. They both have the best customer service, quick stealth shipping (if that even matters), and are just all around easy to deal with. The only portable vape I ever got I ordered off of vapeworld and they fucked up and sent me TWO. My lucky fucking day!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not saying to go out and buy a different one immediately. It&#039;s just something to consider.

For even a decent one that&#039;s new you have to plunk down at least $150 usually. I made some recommendations in my last post for different ranges. Let me say that the vape xhale cloud fucking revolutionized the way I consume cannabis. Miles better than any one I&#039;ve used, and I&#039;ve hit em all -- volcano, plenty, vaporfection, vriptech wand -- you name it.

				Here&#039;s my experience with the MFLB (Magic Flight Launch Box), which IMHO is an excellent portable vape.<br /><br />I grind the weed up as best as I can then I put it on a chopping board and it up for a minute or so until I have a very fine powder, this increases the surface area of the weed and should always improve your smoke, then I will turn it on, wait 5 seconds until there is vapor starting to drift out of the hole then I do an inhale that lasts about 40 seconds, keeping a gap between my mouth and the hole means I&#039;m drawing in air from outside as well and slows down the amount of air being drawn through the vaporizer. <br /><br />I intermittently push my otngue forward to allow a little to exscape from my mouth so I can check by sight whether I&#039;m getting a nice cloud or not.<br /><br />I&#039;ll then hold it in for as long as I can, usually exhaling half my lung volume at the end and taking in another half of fresh air. In my opinion for the MFLB if you&#039;re seeing vapour exhaled then it&#039;s wasted vapour.<br /><br />I know this isn&#039;t applicable for you but it sounds like you&#039;re vaping it too fast, turn the heat down to 3, do a much longer and slower draw and see if that helps. Again, vapour you can see when exhaled is wasted vapour.<br /><br />

				I am currently too high to write so in short..<br /><br />I have the Arizer Extreme Q ans the Solo. They are both great vapes.<br /><br />The best high ever I get from 3 Balloons of the S5 strain sold here with no toleranz. (Easy the best drug exp. of the world and I am dead seriouse here try it!)<br />The solo, well it stands in the self and tried it a few times.<br /><br />I stopped smoking tobacco with an e-cig over a year ago. But if I am really honest I need my joints from time to time. It sucks that I now get this nasty &quot;tabcco-flash&quot; but maybe this is exactly what the vaporizer can not give me ,-)<br /><br />So I use both methods and just stopped smoking cigarettes. I am happy.<br /><br />Have a nice day!<br />take care<br />12345

I´ve never been a joint-smoker or smoked cigarettes, I´ve used to hit the bong the hole day until I recognized that I was not addicted to THC but tobacco and got the Volcano . By now I even get uncomfortable some times, if I smoke a joint with strong tobacco, I don´t like it anymore. But overall I think, you need less material if you vaporize. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126711.msg876083#msg876083">Quote from: wackmanblu on March 03, 2013, 05:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How often do you use the Solo and how comparable is it to the Volcano - the same, or not nearly as good?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />With the Volcano you can make different bubbles, which hit you harder or not, that`s not possible with the Solo. But they are both very good products, couldn´t say one is better, or you need less material. Since I got the Solo, I mostly use the Solo, cause I don´t have to stand up an go over to the Volcano :)
