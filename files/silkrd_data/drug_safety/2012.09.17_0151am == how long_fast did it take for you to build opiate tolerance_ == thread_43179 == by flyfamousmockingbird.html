				Like how did it all start for you as far as starting dosage to where you are now?&nbsp; For me I would just enjoy popping a 5-10mg hydrocodone when i could get some.&nbsp; it would make me feel great for a few hours.&nbsp; i got a big script when i had surgery and ended up going through about 30 of them in a week and after it was gone i felt withdrawls for the first time.&nbsp; i was sometimes able to get oxy and would split an 80 mg into like 6 smaller pieces and one 80 mg would last me like 2-3 days.&nbsp; then one day i was able to get a connect with somebody who had like 280 of the 10/325 hydros a month.&nbsp; i bought 40 from her at once and thought it was amazing and would last me forever.&nbsp; it lasted like 2 weeks.&nbsp; eventually it would take 2-3 of them to feel good.&nbsp; and after a few more months i had to take 6 to feel good.&nbsp; withing the span of about 8 months i had to take 8 at a time to get a buzz.&nbsp; at this point i have to take about the same maybe like 10 at once to catch a buzz at all.&nbsp; kinda sucks, i miss the initial feeling i used to get.&nbsp; i am on suboxone but a few times a month i will take some opiates on the weekend.&nbsp; i am about to get some oxy which i havent taken since my tolerance has increased this high.&nbsp; i was wondering if anyone else has had this kinda experience?&nbsp; even after not taking anything but suboxone for over a month my tolerance to opiates is still super high.&nbsp; i guess the subs probably dont do anything to help lower my opiate tolerance either bu i wait 24 hours from my last sub dose before taking hydros&nbsp; do you think this will also apply to oxys?&nbsp; im gonna be bummed if i dont get a really good buzz off of a 80 mg OC.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve had 3 surgeries, everytime in the 2-3months afterward I would take roughly 500 oxys and hydros (usually 5mg, but still, 500).&nbsp; And I can still take half a blue (15mg) and get a nice buzz, albeit not super strong. My tolerance recently has risen a bit, but that means its time for a break. You just gotta take breaks, it ain&#039;t easy but, since you know it will only do good things its not impossible either. It seems like you are dug in pretty deep though if you are on subs and stuff, best of luck. Might be time to acknowledge the possibility that you will never get that initial feeling back again unfortunately, and that your goal should be to get off opiates for good and find some more natural, healthy ways to achieve satisfaction in life. Easier said than done.

				yeah, i have been dug in pretty deep in the past.&nbsp; although at this point i will go sometimes two weeks without anything other than my recommended daily dose of 6mg of sub each day.&nbsp; it just sucks that my tolerance is still as high as it it.&nbsp; is it because taking subs everyday keeps your tolerance up too though?

				Yes, isn&#039;t suboxone an opiate and an opiate blocker rolled into one pill? I believe it is, therefore it will keep your tolerance up and block the effects of opiate agonists. So the answer is yes, and I believe that is sort of the point.

				yeah its kinda like a half opiate hybrid.&nbsp; its designed to combat withdrawls which in turn attaches itself to your opiate receptors.&nbsp; it can get someone reallllly fucked up if they are&nbsp; a non to very light opiate user.&nbsp; i remember taking some years ago that my friend gave me and it almost felt more intense that oxy.&nbsp; but after basically the first 2-3 times you take it you really dont get any pleasurable effects or euphoria.&nbsp; it also has some nasty fucking withdrawls if you stop taking it suddenly without tapering.&nbsp; i learned that the hard way one month when my dr fucked up my script dates and was out of town.&nbsp; yikes

				Well he sounds like a shmuck.&nbsp; To be very honest, you should continue the taper then and be grateful you have medicine that blocks withdrawal, and get off opiates.&nbsp; Sometimes I think suboxone is like cheating, since withdrawal is absolutely by far the worst part of opiate abuse, if you just don&#039;t have to worry about it, it would probably be pretty hard to quit. I&#039;ve been through sever benzo withdrawal once, which is arguably worse, and because of that experience I will never be highly addicted to benzos again, I will never go through benzo WD again because I&#039;m not interested in going back to hell. But you should consider yourself lucky and try to move on with your life.&nbsp; That would be my tough love advice.

				Suboxone can be used to get off opiates but just remember that it has an incredibly long half life so even if you get off the heroin or roxys or percs or vics, you are going to have to eventually withdraw from the suboxone... although the withdrawal from suboxone is milder than the previously stated opiates, the time in which you will feel the withdrawal effects will be a lot longer. I used it to quit dope
