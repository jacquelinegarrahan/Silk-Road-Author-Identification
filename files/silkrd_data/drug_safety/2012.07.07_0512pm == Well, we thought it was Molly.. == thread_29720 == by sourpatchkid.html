				So, a couple of weeks back, some &quot;MDMA&quot; became available from a guy in town. He bought it off of another guy to resell and honestly had no experience with MDMA before. So, my friends and I took a chance and bought some (a point for each of us). This substance was white and in tiny shards, but could easily be busted into a fine powder. <br />Anyway, my friends and I took the supposed MDMA orally and waited around for two or three hours with no effects. Our anxiety of never trying MDMA could have negated some of the come up effects (as posts on drugs-forum and shroomery suggest), but if it was legit MDMA, I believe we should have DEFINITELY felt real effects. We never did, and needless to say, we were extremely disappointed. So I told the guy who sold it to us, and he was pretty furious. He decided to try it out for himself, yet instead of taking it orally, he snorted it (his preferred method of administration). About 15-20 minutes after snorting it, he began to feel strong effects (he became jittery, euphoric, and wanted to be around people). I&#039;m not sure how long these effects lasted for him, but I was around him for two hours after he took it, and he was still feeling the effects when I left. <br /><br />My main reason for this post is: what do you guys think this could&#039;ve been?&nbsp; It honestly had no effects at all when taken orally. I have no experience with RCs, so I&#039;m wondering if maybe it is some type of RC. Do you guys know of any empathogenic-stimulant RCs that are only active when insufflated? <br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read all that and for (hopefully) responding!<br />

				Background: Have rolled hundreds of times and dealt the substance to many people (Molly, not rolls). <br />Street molly is a strange beast to deal with. It is similar to buying rolls because it is often not what you think you are getting. I find there can be bath salts, caffeine, amphetamine, and even inactive things such as vitamin-c in molly powder.<br />However, I have sold people .2 of real molly in a cap and have seen them try half of it before (.1).<br />In one case, a friend ate the .1 as well and did not feel it. <br />I am certain this molly was effective even in such a dose. I have determined with said customer that he did not feel the effects because he had eaten a massive steak sub directly before hand, and also this man has an extremely slow metabolism to start with. Therefore context of taking the molly and method of administration can effect the roll. A skinny person with nothing in his stomach snorting .1 will roll off the same substance a heavier person with food in there stomach(edited from substance) can not roll off of&nbsp; it when taking it orally. Chances are his molly is not 100% pure but still the real deal.

				If it was cut/shitty Molly, 100 mg&#039;s wouldn&#039;t do too much.&nbsp; What kind of dose did your guy insufflate?&nbsp; Another guess would be it was Methylone, which is very frequently passed off as Molly.&nbsp; If it is, you&#039;ll need around double the dose.&nbsp; Still pretty fun though.&nbsp; Could be that or another rc.&nbsp; Buy off SR next time :)

				In response to KaleidescopeVision,&nbsp; I did a good-sized meal several hours before, so that could have had an effect on it. Though one of my friends had a pretty empty stomach. I want to try it again on an empty stomach, but I definitely don&#039;t want to risk it if it&#039;s some RC and not MDMA. <br /><br />In response to sinenominex, he insufflated 0.1 (same dose as us). And I have considered buying it off of SR, but a part of me wonders is it really worth it? I&#039;ve never rolled before, and I love tripping, so I mainly just use SR for purchasing LSD. How is it in comparison to tripping? I mean, I guess rolling is a pretty great feeling, otherwise people wouldn&#039;t continue buying Molly and E. ;)<br /><br />Thanks for the help!

				MDMA acts primarily on seratonin neurotransmitters. It will flood your brain with chemicals of the 5-ht(x...) variety which are produced by direct sunlight and are correlated with feelings of happiness, being content, and feelings of empathy. In higher doses more dopamine is released making for a slightly speedy set of effects. <br />MDMA is an ingredient of the brain in producing the &#039;happy&#039; feeling and some reports will quantify such a state with numbers. For example, sex might be 100 units of happiness, coke 400, heroin 700, meth 1400. MDMA can be around 200 I believe relatively, think of it as an extended orgasm.<br />Unfortunately I can not link the study referencing.&nbsp; these fairly subjective numbers but I find them to have some bearing on real experiences <br />I have rolled many times and one time was so happy that I assured myself that because of the beautiful happiness of that moment that life will be okay and beautiful forever. It can produce an afterglow that rivals tripping and can surpass it. It will permanently increase your ability to empathize, love and understand :)

				for street molley .1 (100mg) wouldn&#039;t be enough because it would be heavily cut and maybe 50% pure so most likely a 50mg dose. but your description sounds more like methylone which is cheap and common.

				Hmm that would make sense...especially if it was methylone. Not that I&#039;ve ever tried methylone..but from what erowid suggests, a common dose is 100-250 mg. So if it was methylone, 100 mg probably wouldn&#039;t&#039;ve had much of an effect on us.&nbsp; But if it was in fact MDMA, my guess is that it wasn&#039;t pure/we didn&#039;t take enough. <br />Thanks for the response!<br /><br />And in response to zingzong:<br />Buying a reagent test would probably be the best thing to do ;) but it wouldn&#039;t be worth it for me, really. I won&#039;t be consuming any more of this supposed Molly...and if I ever want to try MDMA again, I&#039;ll just get it from a legitimate vendor on here.

To say it &#039;floods&#039; your brain with 5-HT implies that the 5-HT is producing the effects; it&#039;s actually the other way around.
