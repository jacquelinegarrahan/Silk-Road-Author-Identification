				I design natural &amp; orthomolecular nutritional supplements to improve brain health. <br /><br />One of my products is ChillPill, a safe, healthy sedative and sleep aid that works mainly by providing your brain with the natural sleep-promoting factors that it normally lacks. <br /><br />I would like to test the effectiveness of my ChillPills at inducing sleep after methamphetamine use, or at preventing stimulant-induced excitotoxicity and metabolic depression. <br /><br />I do not take neurotoxic stimulants, and I do not personally know anyone who does. <br /><br />Therefore, I am giving out 3 free ChillPills (each) to 5 meth users, in return for a comprehensive review of your experiences. <br /><br />You qualify for the trial if you plan to take meth within the next couple of weeks, have over 200 posts, have been here for at least 2 months, and are capable of writing a coherent review. <br /><br />Note that this is not an endorsement of methamphetamine use, which is a bad idea, especially if you&#039;re malnourished (which you all are). <br /><br />ChillPill item listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/4dc5679867<br /><br />Go!

				Also sounds interesting to me, I will order some when I get some bitcoin in my account.<br /><br />How would you recommend taking the chillpills after using meth, currently to come down after a bit of a binge, I just have a small dose of meth, then go out for 5-6 hours, so there is no more temptation, then I have a decent meal and get as much sleep as I can (generally about 6 hours, even after 3-4 days with no sleep).&nbsp; <br /><br />Generally thats it but if I am feeling really shit, I will have another small dose and that is it.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve never taken methamphetamine, but I&#039;d suggest taking the ChillPill about an hour before you&#039;d like to sleep, once you&#039;re already coming down. Apart from calming excess brain activity it will allow you to sleep for longer than you normally do.

				I don&#039;t use Meth, but I am a heavy user of Methylone, which has many of the same effects as it relates to causing sleep issues. I&#039;d be able to give you a pretty good review, as I also use Ritalin and Adderall. For sleep aids, I&#039;d tried benzodiazepines, various antihistamines, melatonin, and some herbal supplements.<br /><br />I have over 200 posts, as well as an extensive purchase history on SR

				They&#039;ve worked for everyone who&#039;s tried them and written a review; this trial is to see how they stack up against the ultimate sleep-inhibitor, methamphetamine, the &#039;anti-ChillPill&#039; as it were.

				Actually I had a stash of your chill pills when I was using meth, it never worked.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried in upwards of 3 pills, with meth use prior at around 12PM each day.&nbsp; I always stay up that night, even after massive amounts of weed concentrates.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; The only thing that knocks me out after using meth during the day is 4mg of xanax or stay the fuck up cleaning.

Serotonin was first discovered in blood platelets, which release it in response to injury. It constricts blood vessels (hence it&#039;s name, sero-tonin), promotes formation of clots, and induces inflammation, similar to the related chemical histamine. It suppresses mitochondrial respiration, promoting inefficient glycolysis and inhibiting energy production. In neurons, it synergizes with glutamate and causes the influx of calcium and a decrease in ATP levels, which may promote cell death. It has been implicated in the fatigue caused by intense exercise, which can be prevented using branch-chain amino acids, which compete with serotonin for entry to cells. Serotonin is high in autism, alzheimer&#039;s, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and other neurological dysfunctions. Some drugs that inhibit platelet serotonin uptake are presently sold as &#039;antidepressants&#039;, the implication being that low serotonin levels cause depression, or that serotonin corresponds to happiness. This is disingenuous. Several studies have actually correlated elevated serum serotonin levels with depression. Serotonin, released during stress, causes damage to the hippocampus and inhibits memory formation (and cognition in general). The popular theory of serotonin&#039;s behavioral effects is that it constricts the range of an organism&#039;s responses to stimuli, similar to its effects on blood vessels. On the other hand, drugs that replace or inhibit serotonin, such as LSD and MDMA, can prevent fatigue and vastly expand the range of behavior. I believe that serotonin has the opposite effects than those that are typically ascribed to it, and 5-HTP supplementation is unnecessary and probably deleterious in most cases. <br /><br />[Serotonin may be neurotoxic] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1684254<br />[Serum serotonin levels positively correlate with depression] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17380868<br />[5-HTP increases levels of cortisol, a stress hormone] http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=493312<br />[Promotes lipid and cholesterol peroxidation] http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002191509190254Z<br />[Toxic to liver and promotes aortic plaque] http://www.uib.no/dyreavd/fish2012/Ritskes-hoitinga Food and Chemical Toxicology.pdf<br />[Increases mitochondrial free radical production] http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2010.07.014,<br />[Suppresses carbohydrate oxidation] http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=910380<br />[Downregulates expression of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase in neurons; inhibits brain energy production] https://www-jstage-jst-go-jp/article/bbb/69/2/69_2_301/_article<br />
