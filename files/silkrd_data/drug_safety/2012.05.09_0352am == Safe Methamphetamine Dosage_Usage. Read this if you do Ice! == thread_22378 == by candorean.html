				Before I do any drugs, I do a shitton of reading on it. I go through all the medical literature because I want to know what I&#039;m getting into. I&#039;ve found that Meth has the exact same safety profile as dextro. Just another demonized drug because of idiot users. Before you call it addictive let me explain what I&#039;ve found from scientific journals:<br /><br />1. First off, Methamphetamine is only psychologically addictive. Just like Cannabis, food, or the internet. Methamphetamine&#039;s addiction potential is equal to prescription dextroamphetamine (at similarly potent doses). If you are wondering why d-amph addicts are so much rarer, it&#039;s because d-amph is typically given out in prescription tablets only. People can still break it down and snort it, but the difference is that these prescriptions regulate their dosage every month and drastically lowers the chances of addiction. Just another reason why the drug war is such a failure really. European speed is so diluted and cut that I&#039;d be surprised if you even got 10% dextro in your powder. No American dealer wants to sell dextroamph because it takes an extra step in synthesis and is less potent. If Europe had the availability to meth precursors like America did, absolutely NO dealer would be selling l- or d-amphetamine. Pharmaceutical companies have the incentive to use d- and l-amphetamine because meth carries such a stigma that patients won&#039;t want to take it. Big pharma has near free access to precursors and laboratories so making the slightly less potent d-amph costs almost nothing to them.&nbsp; It is saddening that people who are &quot;pro-drugs except for meth&quot; are tricked by the same misinformation that they hate so much when it&#039;s against cannabis.&nbsp; Hopefully by this point, you and I are on the same page and have moved past this &quot;evil meth&quot; label. Thus, I will refer to meth as amphetamine from now on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Significant withdrawal effects only occur when amph is continuously redosed in high dosages. Why? Because constant redosing causes neurotoxicity. The long half life of all amphetamine means that redosing will additively increase blood plasma levels and your brain will soak in that. Acute tolerance shuts out euphoria around the time you reach your first half life. Redosing = excitotoxicity and accumulation of oxidative reactive species in the absense of most of the euphoria. Daily usage is only safe at therapeutic dosages (UNDER ~0.5mg/kg). It seems like it is generally agreed upon that meth is&nbsp; more potent weight by weight than dextro (about 1.3x). When the dosages are matched, they have the exact same safety profile. <br /><br />Chronic use at anything above therapeutic level causes persisting DA striatal depletion. As in, it comes back VERY slowly (think years) and it isn&#039;t 100%. You can withdraw from Heroin and get away without lasting physical damage. The same cannot be said for amphetamines. The striatal depletions go unnoticed by binge users until they stop dosing whereupon shit gets real. Quickly. These are the only people that get severe withdrawal effects and feel extremely addicted. Just like every other drug, binging is bad. Before you call therapeutic dosages too pussylike, read the rest of my post.<br /><br />2. Pre-treatment. Holy fuck I was glad to find out about this before I started using. Pre-treatment takes only one week and it permanently boosts all your subsequent amphetamine effects. It is called sensitization or reverse-tolerance. When taken at sub neurotoxic dosages, the brain becomes supersensitized to all subsequent amphetamine dosages. This effect has been tested to last longer than 120 days and is probably permanent. Animals were intially given a single small amphetamine dosage. In 120 days, they received their second dosage and the effects were dramatically boosted. Tests in human subjects show that the subjective high is nearly doubled from baseline. More research has shown that the optimal pre-treatment schedule is 0.15mg/kg daily for 7 days. The longer the withdrawal period after that, the stronger the effects (up to 30 days when it levels out). Also, did I mention that pre-treatment significantly reduces neurotoxicity in subsequent binges and high dosages? If your first few amphetamine uses were high dosage, you shocked your brain. You most likely had neurotoxic hyperthermia which diminishes sensitization.<br /><br />Source of pretreatment on sensitization and reverse tolerance: http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26144/1/0000221.pdf<br />Source of pretreatment on neurotoxicity: http://www.nature.com/?file=/npp/journal/v28/n10/abs/1300247a.html<br />Bonus source for one dosage causing lasting sensitization: http://www.neuro.cjb.net/content/19/21/9579.short<br />(please keep in mind these dosages in the article are for rats and NOT for humans)<br /><br />3. Any tolerance to amphetamines that last longer than 5 days is caused by neurotoxicity. The main reason for amphetamine&#039;s tolerance is its half life and how quickly the body adjusts to the presence of amphetamine in the blood. After only 3 days (approximately 5 half lives, i.e. ~97% of the drug is gone), this tolerance should be almost completely gone. Any persisting tolerance after 5 days was caused by striatal DA depletions as well as downregulation of D2 receptors. Again, if your tolerance lasts more than 5 days, reconsider your amount and frequency of dosage. Repeated high dosages without adequate time in between will fuck up your shit. The rewarding effects of sensitization is also severely diminished by this binge use.<br /><br />Source: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584602002579<br />(I&#039;ve seen several other sources but this is one I found with a quick search)<br /><br />4. If you enjoy higher dosages, you must spread them out. This goes back to my last point. Moderately high dosages can actually be safe given that you washout the drugs (about 5 half lives) before redosing.<br /><br />5. If you are female, the effects of amphetamine neurotoxicity are two folds stronger and psychosis along with addiction potential occur at half the dosage for males. The presence of certain male androgens are neuroprotective against amphetamine. Sorry, women.<br /><br />6. Smoking and IV have the same safety profile as other ROA&#039;s when dosages are matched for bioavailibility and may actually be safer because of their shorter half lives. Rats can take single 25mg/kg injections with no neurotoxicity because their amphetamine half life is only one hour compared to the human time of 9-12 hours. Amphetamines are one of the rare drugs where these ROAs are safer because amphetamine neurotoxicity is primarily exacerbated by the time it stays in the body. Unfortunately, binge use with smoking or IV causes half life to be irrelevant and the safety profile becomes much more dangerous.<br /><br />7. If you binge, STAY out places that are hotter than room temperature! Heat literally multiplies the tolerance and deficits you are causing to your brain. And, you must have already caused a lot of deficits if you are dumb enough to be a binge user.<br /><br />To sum it up, DON&#039;T FUCKING BINGE!<br /><br />8. If you have suffered psychosis from amphetamine, I would consider stopping usage. Forever. And yes, even if it only happened once. The implications from psychosis are more than just some temporary effect because you didn&#039;t sleep. Amphetamine psychosis is actually caused by the repeated dosage - sleep deprivation only made your brain more vulnerable. The variables that play into psychosis are so wide that studies have yet to really be conclusive on them. Currently, it is believed that prolonged amphetamine blood plasma induces dopamine hyperreactivity. Guess how schizophrenics are diagnosed? Dopamine hyperactivity. Again, this probably causes lasting deficits.<br /><br />Want to avoid psychosis? Don&#039;t. Binge. It is nearly impossible to induce psychosis if there are more than 5 hours of sleep between dosages unless you were already genetically predisposed.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the schedule a beginner should follow for daily productive use and to prevent neurotoxicity (Assuming 99% bioavailability. Adjust dosages for your ROA bioavailability):<br /><br />Days 1-7: 0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;0.5mg/kg for males, &lt;0.25mg/kg for females <br />No more than once a day<br /><br />For recreational use:<br /><br />Days 1-7:0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;1.0mg/kg for males, &lt;0.5mg/kg for females<br />No more than once every 3-4 days <br /><br />After pretreatment and sensitization, 1.0mg/kg WILL bring a satisfying rush. On a 160 pound person, that would be about 72mg. If it sounds too little to you, than you have gone too far.<br /><br />It&#039;s that simple. Moderation is key, what a surprise huh? If everybody took amphetamines responsibly with milligram scales, we would probably be exploring the universe by now.<br /><br />P.S. As a bonus, take Vitamin C and E for antioxidants. Take Magnesium to slow down acute tolerance (NMDA antagonist = be higher for longer! YAY). Zinc supplementation was also found to be synergistic with amphetamine in ADHD patients. I don&#039;t know its effects on normal people, but I take it anyway. For further reading, look up &quot;Robinson TE&quot;. He is by far my favorite researcher. Another goodie is Carl Hart. He is a forerunner on meth research and always talks about the exaggerated claims on meth. He himself said that scientists have known for a long time that methamphetamine is exactly like dextroamphetamine at a drug policy conference.

				Thank you for posting, truly informative- this will help guide my future use.. Years ago when I first discovered amps, I would binge for 48h+, re-dosing again and again getting less and less (and usually feeling shit after 8h anyway). Hurts to thing about the damage I&#039;ve done, but there&#039;s no sense dwelling..<br /><br />Recently my use has been more towards your suggested guidelines, doing this is amazingly productive and rewarding.. Not to mention, none of the horrible side-effects I assumed were just part of amphetamine use.<br /><br />Along the line of achieving Moderation, it&#039;s difficult to pace oneself with these drugs as we all know.<br /><br />I had a special &#039;hotel safe&#039; custom modified for myself like so; You throw your stash in the safe, set a timer (from 10 mins to 7 days) and the box locks until the time passes. I wonder if there would be a market for these on SR? (it was rather expensive..)<br /><br />This allows you to plan your drug use to optimal schedules and stick to it without doing battle with your mind ;)

				I see how binging is the root of most amphetamine problems but its also the best part of doing amphetamines in my opinion. 48 - 72 hours is usually what I go for when I start. I also have been taking either dexedrine, adderall or vyvanse daily for add since I was 9 which is more than half my life. It&#039;s scary to have the damage all laid out for you but its my favorite thing ever. I just never want to go to sleep again. I&#039;m still reasonably young and probably wont have to worry about this till later. Staying nourished and drinking ice water, eating cyclone popsicles, taking fish oil supplements, brushing and flossing your teeth, all of that is really key. I think of it as harm reduction in a sense.<br /><br />edit: After doing a lot more speed since I wrote this post and noticing how different it is now than when I first started a couple years ago, I want to say that staying up for as long as possible is a terrible idea and you will ruin yourself eventually, no matter how many great times you have in the process. I think I might quit doing speed, or at least quit doing it by myself either for fun or for the purposes of &quot;supplementing&quot; my medicated dose. Speed is fucked. The last time I felt satisfied with my life or optimistic about the future was not long before I tried speed. I&#039;m not saying there is a correlation, but I would say for certain that speed has not helped. Certainly not recently.

				Part II (I&#039;m bored and thought more should know):<br />-Take&nbsp; Nicotinamide (also known as niacinamide) pre-dosage or post-dosage. If you have niacin, it&#039;ll work as well since it is metabolized into niacinamide in the digestive system. It prevents depletion of energy (measured in ATP/ADP ratio for those that took biology) and really helps block any feeling of comedown or feeling tired afterwards. It also reduces neurotoxicity potential - always a welcome effect. Niacinamide is directly converted into NADH (available energy for the body) which is important for the brain before being subjected to amphetamine or for recuperating afterwards. Oddly enough, ingestion of niacinamide at the same time as amphetamine had no change. Studies have shown it effective only in pre and post dosage scenarios (3 hours before or 6 hours after)/ <br /><br />Source on energy depletion (d-amph): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10566977<br />Source on energy depletion 2 (meth): http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/1997/05260/Nicotinamide_attenuates_methamphetamine_induced.18.aspx<br />Anecdotal sources: http://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=65179<br />Anecdotal source 2: Me.<br /><br />- Avoid mixing caffeine with any amphetamines. I posted this in another thread, but caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptors which are involved in amphetamine&#039;s mechanism of action. This directly slows down the removal of amphetamine from the blood. At first, this may sound cool, but if you remember from what I said earlier, the brain shuts out the euphoria long before you even reach the first half-life (about 10 hours). Once again, the longer amphetamine stays in the blood, the harder neurotoxicity hits. This is why you should stay away from cut stuff because the dealer is trading your safety in exchange for extra money in his pocket. Amphetamines are great for narcolepsy because no matter how often you take them, significant tolerance does not develop to its wakefulness effects. You do not need caffeine along with it unless you enjoy insomnia. Admittedly, binge users may want insomnia to keep dosing but I&#039;ll just pretend like these people don&#039;t exist.<br /><br />-Cannabis in conjuction with amphetamine is probably helpful. I say probably because there has been only one study done on this comparing the performance of 3 different groups - non-drug users, methamphetamine-only users, and methamphetamine + cannabis users. From the data, if I said non-users were at 100%, meth+cannabis would be 95% and meth-only users would be at 70%. Meth+cannabis users actually beat the non-users in several tests. There are too many factors that weren&#039;t accounted for (i.e. if cannabis merely reduced their meth usage) for me to say outright that weed helps with amphetamine neurotoxicity,&nbsp; but it sure looks like it. What it DOES show is that cannabis does not add physical damage when used with amphetamine. So toke away! Also, if it was a concern to anyone reading, this study involved patients from an addiction clinic. Meaning high dosage binge users. Responsible amphetamine users do not suffer the same impairments that they do.<br /><br />Source: http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Neurocognitive_Performance_of_Meth_Users_Discordant_for_Hx_of_Marijuana_Exp.pdf

				Coacaine works about the same on the brain as meth so your post really hits home for me. When I was a kid (about 15 yrs old) I got into using cocaine. Not knowing much about drugs other than uninformed facts and myths from by circle of &quot;friends&quot; I didnt realize the severity of what I was dealing with. It eventually escalated to where i was binging for 3-4 days out of the week doing a ball every day or&nbsp; two this lasted for over 1 year. What saved me somewhat is that I always forced myself to go to sleep and eat. I never stayed up for more than 1 night without sleeping so I dont know if its considered binging or just heavy use but even years after I stopped I still never felt the same again. I had depression , paranoia, profuse sweating, social anxiety my memory was affected. After I stopped being a regular user I still indulged from time to time every few months but whenever I did my comedown and symptoms afterwards got 10x worse so I eventually stopped using all together about 2 years ago. Now 10 years later from when I first used and I still have social anxiety , I sweat profusely and my memory is pretty bad compared to how it used to be. I also factor in the fact that the coke I was getting was most likely cut with all sorts of shit speed, RC&#039;s, and god knows what cattle deworming crap :o To anyone new to this if you want to stay relatively safe use moderation, listen to your body and buy your drugs from someone you can trust(I know the last one is not always an option)

				<br />good post and thanks for the info. there is a post in this drug safety thread about how taking benzo during your comedown helps quite a bit with neurotoxicity. it contained links to medical studies, etc.. unfortunately i can&#039;t find it though ( or didn&#039;t look hard enough .... )<br />

				Being someone who has already started using meth a little prior to seeing this amazing post, I wonder if abstaining for a period of time - 1 month, 6 months, 1 year - whatever it takes, is it possible to still take advantage of the above method of bring down tolerance as long as the safe limit dosing is maintained following this exercise?

				Awesome! I tried to make a methamphetamine FAQ thread couple months ago actually but got sidetracked. Im glad to see you here candorean, your an asset to this forum, and from your posting, possibly a long lost twin. Seriously, I am the same way and I&#039;ve always thought I was the last smart user around (not in an egotistical way). I&#039;ve been defending meth around here for a while, though I have been a bit busy lately.<br /><br />Anyway, I use meth every day, in place of adderall, and it works great for me, granted I had a amph habit before starting, but I never had sleep problems, inability to eat or any of the common negatives. Amph made my life soooo much better and methamp even more so. <br /><br />Your dead on about that magnesium, I wouldn&#039;t go a day without it. I personally take magnesium taurate.<br /><br />Also, i&#039;ll admit I didn&#039;t read it all yet as i&#039;m more in the &quot;type a paragraph/minute&quot; mode right now, but just incase you didn&#039;t already have this posted I wanted to post about &quot;desoxyn&quot; (methamphetamine HCL) FDA approved for adhd and obesity. You almost never hear about it these days, but I love to tell the meth myth followers about it and watch their reactions, every one so far has said im a lying delusional tweaker, till I pull it up on my phone.<br /><br />Long story short, eat/drink/sleep just as you did before you started and you can use indefinitely. Curve your usage around your life, not vice versa. The biggest rule to remember is, that one day sooner or later you will have to come down for an unknown period of time, albeit your or someone else&#039;s doing, just accept it when it comes, suck it up and when its over you can get 10x higher than before :^)<br /><br />My saying is- Ride it and it will take you great places, follow it and it will take you to hell. If it ever gets ahead of you, stop, and let it come back for you.<br />

When i went to my shrink and he told me i needed to go on anti-depressants because i had a chemical imbalance and was different from everyone else i told him that was great news because i didn&#039;t want to be like all the other mindless drones living in the middle. You don&#039;t need drugs to help you get through work - what you need is a new fucking job that is challenging and interesting so that you won&#039;t need to take shit to escape from the fact that you&#039;re doing mindless boring ass shit. Your mind is correct in saying this to you but others would have you believe there must be something wrong with you. <br /><br />I am sure there are tons of positive research reports but i for one am very skeptical of them. For fucks sake i still can&#039;t get a shrink to explain to me how anti-depressants work other than that they do... We are so far from understand the brain it&#039;s not even funny. But as long as it is making some people money and others slaves who the fuck cares right? It reminds me of the health care industry and how most doctors these days don&#039;t take a basic food course but instead are told to push costly drugs that treat symptoms. Sadly 90% or more of today&#039;s health ailments are from our own doing and can be corrected or prevented by eating the right foods.. but i digress... keep popping those statins sheep.<br /><br />Sorry but so many young americans have become slaves to the system of production at all costs that they don&#039;t even realize they&#039;ve been fucking brain washed... This reminds of me of how china used to give all its people access to opium so that they would be in such a happy stupor they wouldn&#039;t realize how badly they were being exploited. <br /><br />Sad sad sad.<br />

Once you read enough, you know so many different ways to reduce neurotoxicity that it kind of makes you obsessive. I have to keep reminding myself that I don&#039;t need to go so far. Alright guys, I&#039;m gonna teach you various tips on how to efficiently use amphetamines to increase your productivity. Again, I learned this information from science journals but I can&#039;t be bothered to research and cite them all again. No medical professionals would tell you this stuff because they don&#039;t trust you to be responsible with your usage.<br /><br />1. Make &quot;being productive&quot;, whatever that means to you, a habit. Under the influence of amphetamines, any activity you perform becomes more rewarding. Your brain literally develops addiction at a quicker rate. Thus, I suggest not doing anything you don&#039;t want to make a habit. For example, don&#039;t dose and then masturbate for several hours. DO take amphetamine and go out with your friends and bang random strangers. If you have social anxiety and amphetamine relieves it, you can dose and go out and get over your social anxiety more quickly. If you take amphetamine and exercise, you will become addicted to exercise. The key thing here is that you HAVE to do it while sober too. Otherwise, these habits become &quot;state-dependent&quot; and you&#039;ll only be social or a exercise addict while under the influence of amphetamines. Thus, dependence to amphetamines would form. However, if you supplement amphetamines at regular intervals, its amazing what you can become good at. If I had to come up with a completely anecdotal ratio, I would say 1 day of studying on amphetamine is equal to 4 days of studying while sober for me. It&#039;s just so funny how many things I know simply by devouring books while tweaked. As a side note, do not take amphetamines when depressed. I haven&#039;t seen it in a study or anything, but I am convinced that taking amphetamine while depressed will mentally condition yourself to be a more depressed person. Seriously. On one study, scientists dosed rats with a constant source of stress (noise) and they experienced higher levels of neurotoxicity and took longer to return to baseline levels. On a corollary, DO take it when you are happy.<br /><br />2. Make a list of things you need to do before you dose. Every 30 minutes, mentally ask yourself if what you are doing right now is achieving anything. A lot of you guys probably have firsthand experience on dosing and then endlessly post on forums and obsessively reading every thread. This is great for days where you can chill and relax. NOT great for days where you need to get shit done. This is easily fixed by simply making a list of things you need to do. While sober, we all know how satisfying finishing a good day&#039;s of work and then chilling out on the couch is. On amphetamine? Ohh, FEELSGOODMAN. :)<br /><br />3. Before dosing, ask yourself if what you plan on doing that day will &quot;earn&quot; the money back that you spent. For example, it costs me about $2 for a day&#039;s dose. If I spend a couple hours doing intense work, I easily earn that money back and more. If I go out with my friends, I easily receive $2&#039;s worth of entertainment (from increased sociability and enjoyment I get). Familiarize yourself with net gain and ensure that your drug use ALWAYS gives you a positive net gain. You have to factor in future consequences and minimalize them by being responsible with your use. It sounds stupid, but it helps prevent yourself from abusing the drug. If you were using $20&#039;s worth of amphetamine, it would be harder to earn that much back. Nowadays, if I dose and do nothing all day I physically feel guilty. I have mentally conditioned myself into being productive. Good stuff.<br /><br />4. Exercise, bro. Trust me on this one. Exercise in chronic high dosed rats almost completely attenuated all neurotoxicity. The difference between a rat that exercises and a rat that doesn&#039;t in almost every test is significantly huge. ADD kids that exercised concurrently with their medication had much higher success rates. Not only that, but exercise alone improved performance scores in nearly all mental tests as well. Everybody knows how amphetamine causes insomnia right? Well, only 25% of patients actually report that symptom to their doctor. Meanwhile, exercise increases life satisfaction, self-confidence and motivation in OVER 85% of patients. If you do a lot of reading on pharmaceuticals, you would know how astronomically huge 85% is. In comparison, a typical drug for mental symptoms has an expected 20-30% success rate in patients. If exercise could come in a pill, the world would be a magical place. Exercise and amphetamines go hand in hand when done responsibly. For those worried about cardiac problems - adderall cardiac symptoms present themselves at the same rate as the normal population. Stories of heart failure is either from genetics or chronic abuse 99% of the time.<br /><br />5. Studies have shown that amphetamines DO NOT increase your intelligence at all. Period. It only increases your attention and confidence which indirectly improves your short term memory, recall, and athletic performance. What am I trying to get at here? Everything you achieve on amphetamine is possible while you are sober as well. Remember that. If you are ever sober and get into the mindset &quot;Man, I don&#039;t want to/can&#039;t do this without amphetamine&quot;, tell yourself to shut the fuck up. This is the first sign of dependence and a few weeks break would do you good. Take amphetamines when you want to perform BETTER, not because you cannot do something without them. A psychedelics user knows about &quot;set and setting&quot; very well and the same applies to a certain degree with amphetamines.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be back with more.

				Someone mentioned phenylalanine.&nbsp; Phenylalanine, an amino acid, is one of the precursors the body uses for dopamine and norepinephrine production in the brain.&nbsp; Most people have of course heard of dopamine (DA), the bodies so called &quot;feel good&quot; chemical, or neurotransmitter.&nbsp; &nbsp; NE, norepinephrine, or noradrenaline is another of the brains neurotransmitters. The brain uses it for many processes. Learning, memory, attention, focus etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tyrosine, another amino acid, is also a good precursor for the body&#039;s production of DA and NE.&nbsp; Tyrosine is actually a more direct precursor IIRC,&nbsp; because phenylalanine has to be broken down into something else to be used to make DA and NE.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the exact process.....IE what phenylalanine is converted to, but I&#039;m sure the info is on the &quot;net.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can by tyrosine capsulesl at any health food store.&nbsp; I often take then after I&#039;ve been doing coke.&nbsp; Tyrosine just by itself has a mild stimulatory effect.&nbsp; People used to taking hundred of mgs of amphet, might not notice it, but many people can.&nbsp; I find it gives me more of a lift than a cup of coffee if I take 500 to 1000mg.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan are all amino acids. Thus they are found in protein containing foods as proteins are made up of about a dozen different amino acids that all do different things in the body. So you get these amino acids in your diet, but taking them in capsule form will have a stronger effect than just getting them in your diet.<br /><br />5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) is a serotonin precursor as is tryptophan.&nbsp; 5-HTP is a more direct precursor thoughand IIRC is not an amino acid in itself, but is closely related. It&#039;s actually found in an African plant.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re coming down and want to aid recovery of neurotransmittters, you are trying to take a break, or kick altogether, you might try 500mg to 1000mg of tyrosine in the morning and 25mg to 50mg of 5-HTP before bedtime. Careful of coffee and tyrosine together until you know how the tyrosine affects you.&nbsp; 5-HTP often has a very mild sedative effect, so it may help you sleep. Although it&#039;s not strong enough to help you sleep if you&#039;re high. These are recovery supplements not drugs. ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;For myself, I find that after taking 5-HTP every night for about a week, it starts to have a sort of uplifting effect during the day, so I no longer need the tyrosine.&nbsp; I&#039;m quite sensitive to 5-HTP though, so this might vary from person to person. For *mild* depression I find 5-HTP works much faster than SSRI&#039;s.&nbsp; I start feeling some relief in a week.&nbsp; After a long speed binge, that may not be the case though.&nbsp; I&#039;d say you&#039;re definitely better off taking these supplements though, rather than not taking them at all.&nbsp; May as well give your brain as much assistance as you can.&nbsp; I should point out, I have much more experience with coke than speed, as I haven&#039;t done speed for a number of years and then only about ten times in my life. Still, some of the same neurotransmitters are affected, so if these supplements help recovery from cocaine use they should help with speed use too.&nbsp; Great for mild to moderate depression too.&nbsp; Some people prefer them to SSRI&#039;s, SNRI. I&#039;ve heard of people not responding to SSRI&#039;s getting relief from tyrosine and 5-HTP. For others with severe depression those two amino acids may not be strong enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; :) <br /><br />As for what I understand about d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine, amphetamine is what is referred to as a &quot;racemic mixture&quot; or an &quot;optical isomer&quot;.&nbsp; Meaning,&nbsp; in laymans terms, the molecule has a mirrored versions of itself.&nbsp; The L version levo-amphetamine or (levorotary) and the D version, dextro-amphetamine. (dextrorotary)&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read, with amphetamine,&nbsp; the D isomer has stronger affects on the DA neurotransmitter and less on the NE receptors.&nbsp; Thus it&nbsp; has stronger euphoric properties while levo amphetamine is responsible for more of the peripheral effects because it works more on the NE receptors and less on the DA receptors.&nbsp; That&#039;s the simple version.&nbsp; So the old benzedrine tablets, or the modern adderall tabs, contain both L and D amphetamine, but more D than L IIRC. I&#039;ve read that the two together last a little longer than D by itself. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s true, or not.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done dexedrine, but never adderall.<br /><br />Methamphetamine is also a racemic drug containing D and L isomers, BUT with methamphetamine, unlike regular amphetamine,&nbsp; the L isomer is totally inactive.&nbsp; It&#039;s the D isomer that causes all the effects. The best, most pure meth should be all dextro-methamphetamine as I understand it.&nbsp; Does this mean if you get poorer quality speed that is the racemic mixture, some of the weight is going to be totally inactive L isomer? That&#039;s how I understand it<br /><br /><br /><br />Just a quick ps here. Tyrosine, (4-hydroxyphenylalanine) isn&#039;t that far removed molecularly from amphetamine itself IIRC.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could swear I read somewhere that it could probably even be used in amphet synthesis.&nbsp; Maybe someone with a good chem background could address whether that&#039;s fact or fiction as I don&#039;t know<br />

				thanks dillydod for reviving this thread with some new information. I used l-tyrosine to help me kick opiate addiction. I also used to take it after a coke/speed or meth binge but these days i tried to avoid supplements or vitamins that I can get just by eating a healthy diet. i also suggest that people take&nbsp; a low dose of 5-http when trying it for the first time because i&#039;ve had friends that have gotten bad side effects from it. <br /><br />in addition to all these ways to help you recover that are listed in this thread i recommend that you eat a ton of fruits/vegetables, foods without too much sodium and salt, nuts, and try to eat a piece of lean protein at least twice a day during your recovery. i also found that drinking a cup of pure cranberry juice will help flush the toxins out of your system quicker and help your overworked kidneys. it&#039;s important that it be pure juice so the only ingredient on the back should be cranberry&#039;s. it&#039;s expensive and tough to find but works. drinking the stuff they pass for cranberry in the super markets does more harm than good so if you can&#039;t find the pure stuff don&#039;t settle for anything else.<br /><br />lastly if you want to have a long career using drugs and want to recover a lot quicker it&#039;s important to do regular excersize. regardless of how you feel after a binge ...try to get out the next day and do some physical activity. i&#039;ve been using hard drugs for almost two decades now and have tried every supplement/vitamin, etc... but have found that eating well and being in shape help with a recovery more than anything else.<br /><br />

				I am a heavy drug user and can&#039;t remember the last time I wasn&#039;t high on something. Anyways meth is extremely popular in my area. It has been part of my life for the last 15 years. First comparing methamphetamines to amphetamines is like comparing vodka to beer. Crystal will kick the shit out of any form of amphetamines either off the streets or prescription. Also don&#039;t underestimate the power of psychological addiction. I am not trying to call you out but I can only assume that you are not familiar with psychological addiction first hand? To put it nicely comparing meth addiction to surfing the internet is fucking retarded. Having had a serious drinking problem in the past I know that one drink will lead to 30. Physically its easy to say just don&#039;t have another drink but psychologically it is nearly impossible for me. I am a heavy tobacco user and of course its easy to say just quit smoking. Much easier said than done. Ever taken a hit of crack? Ive never seen the guy who can just take a couple hits of rock and then walk away. Meth like many drugs is comparable to the Pringles ad stating once you pop you cant stop except the desire to redose on meth trumps Pringles many many times over. When smoking meth your body will have a massive urge to re dose. Also the 70mg or whatever dose for someone new to the drug would have most people spun. You may feel as if you&#039;re productive but will find that you have wasted hours doing nothing. There is real time and then there is meth time. Hours can seem like minutes while on meth. If someone is curious about the drug you will just have to try it. I personally take it orally and that decreases the desire to re dose. With quality meth oral doses of 5mg can be effective to most people new to the drug. If you are 160lbs and are taking 70mg and consider that to be a functional dose your either getting garbage or have a tolerance.

				I have to admit that I skimmed through most of your post but 72mg for someone weighing 160lbs would be equal to me taking 100mg at 99% bio availability aka shooting up or roughly a 130mg line snorted. That is not considered a functional dose. Also you mention 5hrs sleep to avoid psychosis. If I gave someone new a 130mg line of decent shit I assure you they won&#039;t be sleeping that night. I have been up 3-4 days since I last smoked, snorted or ate anything. Saying get 5hrs of sleep a night is a lot easier said than done. I have seen a lot of things and done most of them. It&#039;s one thing to read something on the Internet and a whole other living it first hand.

				Another problem with your post again is the sleep thing. Say I followed your guidelines and being around 220lbs a recreational dose would be around 130mg snorted and a productive dose would be around 65mg. Being someone with above average experience with meth I can tell you that either of those doses are going to create a big problem for a beginner. Even with the &quot;productive&quot; dose the end user will not be sleeping that night. Say at 8am they take 60-70mg their day will speed by quickly and next thing they know it will be midnight and still not tired, then 2am... 4am... 6am etc. They will go the whole night without sleep and in many cases have no choice but to take more to make it through the following day. I have been there way to many times. I will take a small amount one day and be forced to continue the cycle of no sleep in able to make it through the week. Meth is not one of those drugs that you can take that morning and then be gone by that afternoon. If you are curious about meth as a functional drug start in very small doses and slowly up them until you reach the desired affect. I would start day one with 5mg and continue to add 5mg untill you reach the desired dose. Most people new to meth and amphetamines will find 5-10mg a very functional beginner dose. Also I can not over state how important the method of use is. If you want it to be functional and dont want to become a addict you best bet is to parachute it aka eat the shit.

				Spot on write-up!<br /><br />Want to add +1000 on exercise. Do not underestimate the benefits of physical activity (think 30+ min of sweating/heavy breathing per day, not a slow walk through grocery store) on recovery, brain health, good feelings, and mental well being. Fucking wonder drug in effectiveness. Seriously get off your ass. This has nothing to do with what shape you are in, even if you look fit, you need 30+ min of hard physical activity.<br />

				GREAT thread man! We need more well cited articles like this, now a days there are so many rumors about drugs, and a lot of these rumors are actually very detailed and scientific but they are still false, usually they are started when someone misinterprets a study or two.<br /><br />As far as anti-oxidants go, there are some important things I should add.<br /><br />1) Vitamin C does not cross the blood brain barrier in its reduced form: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC508490/<br />This means that once the vitamin C is in your brain, it is no longer an anti-oxidant. You want the anti-oxidants primarity for the oxidants in your brain after meth use.<br /><br />2) Vitamin E can cross the BBB, but only the alpha isomer of vitamin E.<br /><br />I recommend curcumin, in the form of CuraPro (its on amazon). Curcumin is a VERY powerful anti-oxidant that crosses the blood-brain barrier easily. Unfortunately, it is not well absorbed in humans so you need to buy the CuraPro brand (or any brand containing BCM-95 curcumin, CuraPro is the best bang for your buck) which is a special micronized form of curcumin mixed with turmeric essential oils that is much better absorbed. I take 2 of them every day (with breakfast and before I go to bed).<br />

				Nice work , very well composed and reinforced with links to source material- thank you for taking the time to write a proper piece.<br />I wanted to elaborate a little on some things you&#039;ve mentioned-but dont take my counter points as being like Im trying to shit on your work- Again I think you wrote a solid post - Also, it&#039;s smart idea to gather info on any medicines you might take legal or otherwise.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Most all medical studies and their &quot;facts&quot; on methamphetamine are often skewed by biases, misconceptions, and deceptions of the researchers who proceeded them. Meth has been aggressively campaigned against,&nbsp; and is associated with some of the most infamous individuals and organizations like : The Hells Angels, The Nazi Party, ect... Slogans like &quot;Speed Kills&quot; been around since the 1950s but modern campaigns now are trying to portray the drug as a white-trailer-trash recreation to discourage others from experimenting with the drug. Some of the bad reputation meth has is deserved, but alot of people like to blame Meth for the troubles&nbsp; of their own poor judgements, ignorance, and lack of moral substance. Be very skeptical about any facts on the subject.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meth may be only psychological addictive - but the mind is very much a part of the physical body, and there definitely are withdraw symptoms if you take&nbsp; it routinely, so dont underestimate the addictive nature of any drug.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for the neurotoxicity / tolerance portion,Meth is very similar to a great deal of chemicals produced by the body and brain and the tolerance is linked more to those receptors it overloads /locks into. Its your own brain getting you high when you do meth, meth is like the key that opens the door to the feel good chemical response- but these chems take time for the brain to produce and replenish. So in fact you&#039;re right about re-upping in larger doses- since meth doesnt actually get you high (ONLY TRIGGERS IT ) you arent going to get higher by increasing the dosage. Its good to be a lightweight.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amphetamine Psychosis is mainly caused by the deprivation of sleep upon the brain, even if you just lay down and rest your body for a couple hours it willl make a big difference in being stable mentally and try to eat a little blood sugar lvls n such help to keep the brain operating&nbsp; well.<br />

				I would disagree that meth is just psychologically addictive - the down regulation of the dopamine and serotonin receptors along with the desensitization to the chemical through neural changes basically defines (simplifying everything) physical dependence. Due to these biochemical alterations, the user will experience tolerance, along with a period of withdrawal because of the &quot;physical&quot; addiction.&nbsp; you even claim there is tolerance and dependence yet still say its only psychological???<br /><br />And you seem to be suggesting meth just catalyzes a natural process that is similar to the common action of the monoamines? i dont know what you mean by it &quot;triggers&quot; but &quot;doesnt actually get you high&quot;? It is directly the action of meth on the vesicular transporters that produces the efflux of monoamines to extremely high and unnatural levels. you make it seem like just because it isnt targeting a post-synaptic receptor its not the meth that is causing it? This is how many drugs function though (like cocaine inhibiting DAT) along with multiple other pharmacological mechanisms... i feel you are saying meths action is similar to a normal, natural neural activity which i completely disagree with. <br /><br />There is no neurochem that i am familiar with (please share if you know) that actually reverses the action of the monoamine transporters... this causes MASSIVE efflux of monoamines and produces synaptic levels that are no where near normal (its not your own brain getting you high, it is the meth causing it directly), for example with dopamine levels are up to 1200 times higher than normal... which depletes the vesicular stores and causes neurotoxicity. its not like meth is just triggering a natural process to get you high.&nbsp; the more meth you take, the more VMATs are altered and so up to a point taking more will definitely increase the effects - but eventually the receptors will be completely filled (just like with lsd, you only have so many receptors and can fill them all)&nbsp;

				As someone who uses amphetamines on a daily basis, I&#039;ve found it very helpful to take a magnesium pill every night, and drink a &quot;berocca&quot; or similar bi-carb soda containing drink about an hour before dosing. <br /><br />Another effective strategy to potentiate amp&#039;s is to re-structure your diet in order to increase the PH of your blood.&nbsp; Amphetamines are washed through the kidneys much more efficiently if your blood has a lower PH.&nbsp; Increasing the PH level will result in a better &quot;second pass.&quot;<br /><br />cheers.

However - those that characterize physical dependence that i was referring to like i said in my first post are the down regulation of the post synaptic dopamine and serotonin receptors, depletion of presynaptic monoamine stores, and upregulation of intracellular mechanism to dampen the receptor over-activation (such as increased PKA and PKC activation). <br /><br />these changes cause a physical dependence (my interpretation of the term physical addiction is when you develop this dependence) that causes tolerance which reduces the effects from the same dose, and therefor necessitates a higher and higher dose to maintain the same high. also, as the person increases the dose due to tolerance, the changes i mentioned increase more and more. Eventually the changes have become great enough if a person uses regularly that when the system stops receiving the drug they no longer have enough strength of the natural process to produce the needed neuronal activation which results in a period of withdrawal. <br /><br />meth withdrawal, although no where near as severe as w/d from many CNS depressants, can still be significant and produce anhedonia, anxiety and depression, sleep disturbances, impulsivity, attention deficits, lethargy, appetite changes, decreased cardiovascular stimulation and respiration from the reduced adrenergic activation, etc. - although many users do not develop severe enough dependence to experience much beyond a mild &quot;crash&quot; because the main areas affected do not cause as intense rebound sympathetic stimulation, but instead depression which is much more tolerable and not as dangerous<br /><br />i guess there is some disagreement whether this is actually physiological dependence - but i dont understand why it would not be considered to be physical and only purely psychological , just because the dependence is not as severe as the dependence caused by other drugs and it takes longer to build the tolerance? so i see your point some will disagree its not physical but because of the tolerance and physical changes causing the withdrawal or &quot;crash&quot; I disagree. which is why i would appreciate you to explain your perspective and belief it is only psychological... <br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/206581-Amphetamine-Meth-withdrawals<br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/288050-help-with-methamphetamine-withdrawl<br />http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/meth.asp<br />http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201007/physical-addiction-or-psychological-addiction-is-there-real-differen<br />http://www.sandiegotherapistcounselor.com/physical-vs-psychological-addictions-the-signs-of-an-addiction-problem.html<br />http://wiki.bluelight.ru/index.php/Methamphetamine

				You have a pretty good point there.&nbsp; But I think the crux of the debate is not the properties of the drug itself, rather, the definition of &quot;physical dependance&quot; as opposed to &quot;psychological dependance.&quot;<br />It seems that there is far too much grey area involved.&nbsp; Methamphetamine is a drug which has characteristics of both types of dependancies, so the question becomes: Does one supercede the other? How do we weight the characteristics of a drug to fit it into the catagory of physical/psychological dependance?<br /><br />I&#039;ll admit that I&#039;m still somewhat unused to discussion with rational minded people.&nbsp; Most, if not all forums I frequent on clearnet are filled with opinionated slobs.&nbsp; Unfortunately the forums are still useful to me so I end up copping it and moving along.&nbsp; Thanks for restoring my faith in humanity&nbsp; :P

				the two are not mutually exclusive, as demonstrated by opiates<br /><br />that is actually why i included a few links about the definition of physical dependence - basically they confirm that given the evidence i provided meth is considered to be physically addictive, at least slightly although not as much as depressants <br /><br />wheres MGM at - he was the one i was really looking to have a discussion with given i was initially responding to his claims i disagreed with

				I just want to ask the OP if there are any permanent damages from heavy binging of stimulants? Specifically 4-methylethylcathinone, but from what I understand you studied amphetamines and might feel uncomfortable speculating differences or similarities of that to what I used to take, a cathinone. Either way, I assume you know one or two things about serotonin and dopamine, and hence my question:<br /><br />Is heavy dopamine and serotonin release in the brain, over and over again, going to damage the brain permanently?<br /><br />I was engaged in a heavy binge on 4-MEC for one or two months, I would take at least a gram a day, and some days I would refill my nose and keep taking it orally even though I didn&#039;t get any higher. The way I abused that drug is almost unrealistic, since I had almost an unlimited supply (250g) for me to take alone. I would be surprised if I didn&#039;t have some sort of permanent damage. The only time I went to a hospital though was when I did a blood checkup, and the results they gave me showed that after my heavy binging period I did have some liver damage, but that it was actually going to heal just fine, I was glad to hear that.<br /><br />Still though, 4-MEC, like Mephedrone, is a drug that releases both serotonin and dopamine at the same time. I&#039;ve heard that, that combination is dangerous to your brain, and I don&#039;t doubt it. I don&#039;t doubt it because I experienced some brain damage symptoms in rehab (I went to rehab after my binging went too far), for example, when I would try to recall a memory or something that happened in the past, sometimes I would experience a brainshock, kind of feels like an electrical shock in my brain, and I would completely forget what it was I was thinking about. My theory is that the drug had actually burnt out these memories and as my brain was attempting to recall them at that location they were stored, the memory was nowhere to be found. A good thing to remember is that 4-MEC is, I think, acidic, or I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s acidic but it does burn through tissue slightly. I often had nose bleeds and pains in my nostrils, and even pain in my stomach after having taken it orally too often.<br /><br />I would also feel an electrical shock and a brief loss of balance/consciousness (0.1 seconds at most), whenever I would drink a glass of water. I really don&#039;t know why it was, but it mostly seemed to happen when I was about to drink a liquid, that I would get a shock in my brain.<br /><br />I hope someone can clear me up on this, I just want to know if I might have some permanent brain damage or if the brain is just like any other organ and can heal and replenish itself fully.

Exhausting your brains hormones, and not giving sufficient time to replenish serotonin and dopamine will surely damage receptors (excessive firing?) and consistent abnormal levels of such hormones will no doubt induce severe neurotoxicity, especially if you are binging for a month or more...I am in no way versed in this subject, I&#039;ve done small amounts of research on mdma neurotoxicity as that is my drug of choice, however I think the same applies in some way. I have a feeling Micron will answer your question with ease. <br /><br />In relation to your brain zaps, a friend of mine who came back from overseas completely abused mdma on his travels, re-dosing to extremely high dosages and repeatedly for about a month. He would get similar zaps that you describe. When sleeping he complained that he would get a &#039;wooshing&#039; sound in his ear and suddenly wake up in a panic (hypnic jerk from what I&#039;ve read - but a severe form). This no doubt, is a result of his excessive mdma use, though as I said, I am not educated in this field, and I am simply speculating.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for your response, I&#039;ve been worried that I might have gotten dumber since what happened to me, haha! What if I&#039;m really stupid and I don&#039;t know it myself, lol! Nah, I don&#039;t think so, while I am a little worried that I&#039;ve had permanent damage to my brain, I&#039;m going to assume that the brain is healing itself. I don&#039;t see why the brain wouldn&#039;t, I&#039;ve heard people getting shot in the head, and after a period of coma the brain repairs itself and manages to function relatively well (almost as good as new), regardless. I believe the human body to be a wonderful machine, capable of fighting off so many diseases and repair so much damage. I think a few months of binging like I did is nothing to my brain, well, I hope. I heard about that neurotoxicity thing, though.<br /><br />One thing I learnt for sure, though, was fuck binging. And to have respect for drugs, stimulants or otherwise. I&#039;ve always had a deep respect and fear for opiates, and taken them very cautiously. I did not do this with amphetamines or stimulants in general though, and I payed the price. 4-MEC is addictive, far more so than I had originally thought, although psychologically addictive and not physically. Just like weed is. I easily get hooked on weed too so I try to keep it cool with that. I try to keep it cool with all drugs nowadays, heck, the main reason I&#039;m still doing this thing is cause I don&#039;t know how to get a normal job. All I really ever known was dealing drugs, and I know that sounds cliché, but I&#039;ve really given up hope of ever getting a normal job soon. I&#039;m not even sure if I want to, I hate sucking up to someone or having a boss order me around, and being forced to work annoying hours doing something I have no interest in whatsoever, earning a meager hourly wage. Shit, when I was selling that 4-MEC, I was making around $16 on every gram I sold at a price of $23-25, and all I had to do was meet some sucker that took 20 minutes max, and I would sometimes be selling 5-10 grams at a single meet. I hate the violent part of the drug game, though, I was robbed once and beaten up, held hostage and extorted, but fuck, I&#039;m alright now and if I gave up that easily I would be missing out on $. What doesn&#039;t kill me only makes me stronger and wiser.<br /><br />For example, I learnt the logical lesson that if I ever was to be in possession of 250 grams of any substance again, it might be wiser to consider selling it wholesale instead of breaking it up into grams. Fuck, the less people you meet the longer you stay in the game. I was too fucking stupid to realize that the first time around.<br /><br />I want to extend my gratitude to the SR community, all it&#039;s vendors and buyers, and DPR, for creating this thing. It&#039;s fucking beautiful. And I might make some bank thanks to it. I fucking love you guys. I live in a remote town in europe, close to the arctic circle, where if I manage to import some stuff I&#039;ll be one of the few dudes with weed, and people over here are killing for good weed and ecstacy.

I go through all the medical literature because I want to know what I&#039;m getting into. I&#039;ve found that Meth has the exact same safety profile as dextro. Just another demonized drug because of idiot users. Before you call it addictive let me explain what I&#039;ve found from scientific journals:<br /><br />1. First off, Methamphetamine is only psychologically addictive. Just like Cannabis, food, or the internet. Methamphetamine&#039;s addiction potential is equal to prescription dextroamphetamine (at similarly potent doses). If you are wondering why d-amph addicts are so much rarer, it&#039;s because d-amph is typically given out in prescription tablets only. People can still break it down and snort it, but the difference is that these prescriptions regulate their dosage every month and drastically lowers the chances of addiction. Just another reason why the drug war is such a failure really. European speed is so diluted and cut that I&#039;d be surprised if you even got 10% dextro in your powder. No American dealer wants to sell dextroamph because it takes an extra step in synthesis and is less potent. If Europe had the availability to meth precursors like America did, absolutely NO dealer would be selling l- or d-amphetamine. Pharmaceutical companies have the incentive to use d- and l-amphetamine because meth carries such a stigma that patients won&#039;t want to take it. Big pharma has near free access to precursors and laboratories so making the slightly less potent d-amph costs almost nothing to them.&nbsp; It is saddening that people who are &quot;pro-drugs except for meth&quot; are tricked by the same misinformation that they hate so much when it&#039;s against cannabis.&nbsp; Hopefully by this point, you and I are on the same page and have moved past this &quot;evil meth&quot; label. Thus, I will refer to meth as amphetamine from now on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Significant withdrawal effects only occur when amph is continuously redosed in high dosages. Why? Because constant redosing causes neurotoxicity. The long half life of all amphetamine means that redosing will additively increase blood plasma levels and your brain will soak in that. Acute tolerance shuts out euphoria around the time you reach your first half life. Redosing = excitotoxicity and accumulation of oxidative reactive species in the absense of most of the euphoria. Daily usage is only safe at therapeutic dosages (UNDER ~0.5mg/kg). It seems like it is generally agreed upon that meth is&nbsp; more potent weight by weight than dextro (about 1.3x). When the dosages are matched, they have the exact same safety profile. <br /><br />Chronic use at anything above therapeutic level causes persisting DA striatal depletion. As in, it comes back VERY slowly (think years) and it isn&#039;t 100%. You can withdraw from Heroin and get away without lasting physical damage. The same cannot be said for amphetamines. The striatal depletions go unnoticed by binge users until they stop dosing whereupon shit gets real. Quickly. These are the only people that get severe withdrawal effects and feel extremely addicted. Just like every other drug, binging is bad. Before you call therapeutic dosages too pussylike, read the rest of my post.<br /><br />2. Pre-treatment. Holy fuck I was glad to find out about this before I started using. Pre-treatment takes only one week and it permanently boosts all your subsequent amphetamine effects. It is called sensitization or reverse-tolerance. When taken at sub neurotoxic dosages, the brain becomes supersensitized to all subsequent amphetamine dosages. This effect has been tested to last longer than 120 days and is probably permanent. Animals were intially given a single small amphetamine dosage. In 120 days, they received their second dosage and the effects were dramatically boosted. Tests in human subjects show that the subjective high is nearly doubled from baseline. More research has shown that the optimal pre-treatment schedule is 0.15mg/kg daily for 7 days. The longer the withdrawal period after that, the stronger the effects (up to 30 days when it levels out). Also, did I mention that pre-treatment significantly reduces neurotoxicity in subsequent binges and high dosages? If your first few amphetamine uses were high dosage, you shocked your brain. You most likely had neurotoxic hyperthermia which diminishes sensitization.<br /><br />Source of pretreatment on sensitization and reverse tolerance: http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26144/1/0000221.pdf<br />Source of pretreatment on neurotoxicity: http://www.nature.com/?file=/npp/journal/v28/n10/abs/1300247a.html<br />Bonus source for one dosage causing lasting sensitization: http://www.neuro.cjb.net/content/19/21/9579.short<br />(please keep in mind these dosages in the article are for rats and NOT for humans)<br /><br />3. Any tolerance to amphetamines that last longer than 5 days is caused by neurotoxicity. The main reason for amphetamine&#039;s tolerance is its half life and how quickly the body adjusts to the presence of amphetamine in the blood. After only 3 days (approximately 5 half lives, i.e. ~97% of the drug is gone), this tolerance should be almost completely gone. Any persisting tolerance after 5 days was caused by striatal DA depletions as well as downregulation of D2 receptors. Again, if your tolerance lasts more than 5 days, reconsider your amount and frequency of dosage. Repeated high dosages without adequate time in between will fuck up your shit. The rewarding effects of sensitization is also severely diminished by this binge use.<br /><br />Source: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584602002579<br />(I&#039;ve seen several other sources but this is one I found with a quick search)<br /><br />4. If you enjoy higher dosages, you must spread them out. This goes back to my last point. Moderately high dosages can actually be safe given that you washout the drugs (about 5 half lives) before redosing.<br /><br />5. If you are female, the effects of amphetamine neurotoxicity are two folds stronger and psychosis along with addiction potential occur at half the dosage for males. The presence of certain male androgens are neuroprotective against amphetamine. Sorry, women.<br /><br />6. Smoking and IV have the same safety profile as other ROA&#039;s when dosages are matched for bioavailibility and may actually be safer because of their shorter half lives. Rats can take single 25mg/kg injections with no neurotoxicity because their amphetamine half life is only one hour compared to the human time of 9-12 hours. Amphetamines are one of the rare drugs where these ROAs are safer because amphetamine neurotoxicity is primarily exacerbated by the time it stays in the body. Unfortunately, binge use with smoking or IV causes half life to be irrelevant and the safety profile becomes much more dangerous.<br /><br />7. If you binge, STAY out places that are hotter than room temperature! Heat literally multiplies the tolerance and deficits you are causing to your brain. And, you must have already caused a lot of deficits if you are dumb enough to be a binge user.<br /><br />To sum it up, DON&#039;T FUCKING BINGE!<br /><br />8. If you have suffered psychosis from amphetamine, I would consider stopping usage. Forever. And yes, even if it only happened once. The implications from psychosis are more than just some temporary effect because you didn&#039;t sleep. Amphetamine psychosis is actually caused by the repeated dosage - sleep deprivation only made your brain more vulnerable. The variables that play into psychosis are so wide that studies have yet to really be conclusive on them. Currently, it is believed that prolonged amphetamine blood plasma induces dopamine hyperreactivity. Guess how schizophrenics are diagnosed? Dopamine hyperactivity. Again, this probably causes lasting deficits.<br /><br />Want to avoid psychosis? Don&#039;t. Binge. It is nearly impossible to induce psychosis if there are more than 5 hours of sleep between dosages unless you were already genetically predisposed.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the schedule a beginner should follow for daily productive use and to prevent neurotoxicity (Assuming 99% bioavailability. Adjust dosages for your ROA bioavailability):<br /><br />Days 1-7: 0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;0.5mg/kg for males, &lt;0.25mg/kg for females <br />No more than once a day<br /><br />For recreational use:<br /><br />Days 1-7:0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;1.0mg/kg for males, &lt;0.5mg/kg for females<br />No more than once every 3-4 days <br /><br />After pretreatment and sensitization, 1.0mg/kg WILL bring a satisfying rush. On a 160 pound person, that would be about 72mg. If it sounds too little to you, than you have gone too far.<br /><br />It&#039;s that simple. Moderation is key, what a surprise huh? If everybody took amphetamines responsibly with milligram scales, we would probably be exploring the universe by now.<br /><br />P.S. As a bonus, take Vitamin C and E for antioxidants. Take Magnesium to slow down acute tolerance (NMDA antagonist = be higher for longer! YAY). Zinc supplementation was also found to be synergistic with amphetamine in ADHD patients. I don&#039;t know its effects on normal people, but I take it anyway. For further reading, look up &quot;Robinson TE&quot;. He is by far my favorite researcher. Another goodie is Carl Hart. He is a forerunner on meth research and always talks about the exaggerated claims on meth. He himself said that scientists have known for a long time that methamphetamine is exactly like dextroamphetamine at a drug policy conference.

The heroin addicts are thru the worst of it in 3 days and generally much healthier in every way. Don&#039;t need antipsychotics for sure. In short absolute drivel from someone with no scientific/addictionoolgy background wishint it were so. Like any drug including EtOH, take at your own risk. This particular bad boy/meth/has the poorest recovery stats of nearly any drug including H. Not absolutely futile but damn close in many instances. And yes hyperthermia&#039;convulsions remain a medical risk.<br />&nbsp;

				I actually disagree that methamphetamine is superior to amphetamine. My experience with addy and dextros is that they are usually not such a great high. Yet good european street speed is every bit if not more enjoyable than meth IMO. Meth is much stronger yes and has more mental euphoria in some ways but good street speed has intense physical euphoria and just huge waves of mental euphoria is a really energetic and feels more fun and less cracky. <br /><br />I prefer it to be honest. At the raves that are popular here in europe it outshines meth in just about every way.<br /><br />Another reason we don&#039;t have it here is that it has been massively demonized in the press. There is a bigger stigma against meth than any other drug.

				I&#039;m prescribed 30mg dexies a day for ADHD, spread over the day in 3 doses. I followed this pretty well for a couple of months before beginning to supplement it with good quality meth also dosed orally; combined I currently probably take the equivalent of 60mg dexies per day (I don&#039;t weigh the meth but I have a feel for how&nbsp; much). Although occasionally I might abuse it and run through my shit a bit early; over the past month, for various reasons, I&#039;ve started to take it more for the rush than the productivity... after a week&#039;s break, for the last 5 days i&#039;ve used around 100mg/day which is pretty much the worst I&#039;ve ever done; after reading this thread I&#039;m gonna cut that shit out. From skimming this thread, it seems that if all this presensitise stuff is true, I should be ok?<br /><br />

I go through all the medical literature because I want to know what I&#039;m getting into. I&#039;ve found that Meth has the exact same safety profile as dextro. Just another demonized drug because of idiot users. Before you call it addictive let me explain what I&#039;ve found from scientific journals:<br /><br />1. First off, Methamphetamine is only psychologically addictive. Just like Cannabis, food, or the internet. Methamphetamine&#039;s addiction potential is equal to prescription dextroamphetamine (at similarly potent doses). If you are wondering why d-amph addicts are so much rarer, it&#039;s because d-amph is typically given out in prescription tablets only. People can still break it down and snort it, but the difference is that these prescriptions regulate their dosage every month and drastically lowers the chances of addiction. Just another reason why the drug war is such a failure really. European speed is so diluted and cut that I&#039;d be surprised if you even got 10% dextro in your powder. No American dealer wants to sell dextroamph because it takes an extra step in synthesis and is less potent. If Europe had the availability to meth precursors like America did, absolutely NO dealer would be selling l- or d-amphetamine. Pharmaceutical companies have the incentive to use d- and l-amphetamine because meth carries such a stigma that patients won&#039;t want to take it. Big pharma has near free access to precursors and laboratories so making the slightly less potent d-amph costs almost nothing to them.&nbsp; It is saddening that people who are &quot;pro-drugs except for meth&quot; are tricked by the same misinformation that they hate so much when it&#039;s against cannabis.&nbsp; Hopefully by this point, you and I are on the same page and have moved past this &quot;evil meth&quot; label. Thus, I will refer to meth as amphetamine from now on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Significant withdrawal effects only occur when amph is continuously redosed in high dosages. Why? Because constant redosing causes neurotoxicity. The long half life of all amphetamine means that redosing will additively increase blood plasma levels and your brain will soak in that. Acute tolerance shuts out euphoria around the time you reach your first half life. Redosing = excitotoxicity and accumulation of oxidative reactive species in the absense of most of the euphoria. Daily usage is only safe at therapeutic dosages (UNDER ~0.5mg/kg). It seems like it is generally agreed upon that meth is&nbsp; more potent weight by weight than dextro (about 1.3x). When the dosages are matched, they have the exact same safety profile. <br /><br />Chronic use at anything above therapeutic level causes persisting DA striatal depletion. As in, it comes back VERY slowly (think years) and it isn&#039;t 100%. You can withdraw from Heroin and get away without lasting physical damage. The same cannot be said for amphetamines. The striatal depletions go unnoticed by binge users until they stop dosing whereupon shit gets real. Quickly. These are the only people that get severe withdrawal effects and feel extremely addicted. Just like every other drug, binging is bad. Before you call therapeutic dosages too pussylike, read the rest of my post.<br /><br />2. Pre-treatment. Holy fuck I was glad to find out about this before I started using. Pre-treatment takes only one week and it permanently boosts all your subsequent amphetamine effects. It is called sensitization or reverse-tolerance. When taken at sub neurotoxic dosages, the brain becomes supersensitized to all subsequent amphetamine dosages. This effect has been tested to last longer than 120 days and is probably permanent. Animals were intially given a single small amphetamine dosage. In 120 days, they received their second dosage and the effects were dramatically boosted. Tests in human subjects show that the subjective high is nearly doubled from baseline. More research has shown that the optimal pre-treatment schedule is 0.15mg/kg daily for 7 days. The longer the withdrawal period after that, the stronger the effects (up to 30 days when it levels out). Also, did I mention that pre-treatment significantly reduces neurotoxicity in subsequent binges and high dosages? If your first few amphetamine uses were high dosage, you shocked your brain. You most likely had neurotoxic hyperthermia which diminishes sensitization.<br /><br />Source of pretreatment on sensitization and reverse tolerance: http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26144/1/0000221.pdf<br />Source of pretreatment on neurotoxicity: http://www.nature.com/?file=/npp/journal/v28/n10/abs/1300247a.html<br />Bonus source for one dosage causing lasting sensitization: http://www.neuro.cjb.net/content/19/21/9579.short<br />(please keep in mind these dosages in the article are for rats and NOT for humans)<br /><br />3. Any tolerance to amphetamines that last longer than 5 days is caused by neurotoxicity. The main reason for amphetamine&#039;s tolerance is its half life and how quickly the body adjusts to the presence of amphetamine in the blood. After only 3 days (approximately 5 half lives, i.e. ~97% of the drug is gone), this tolerance should be almost completely gone. Any persisting tolerance after 5 days was caused by striatal DA depletions as well as downregulation of D2 receptors. Again, if your tolerance lasts more than 5 days, reconsider your amount and frequency of dosage. Repeated high dosages without adequate time in between will fuck up your shit. The rewarding effects of sensitization is also severely diminished by this binge use.<br /><br />Source: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584602002579<br />(I&#039;ve seen several other sources but this is one I found with a quick search)<br /><br />4. If you enjoy higher dosages, you must spread them out. This goes back to my last point. Moderately high dosages can actually be safe given that you washout the drugs (about 5 half lives) before redosing.<br /><br />5. If you are female, the effects of amphetamine neurotoxicity are two folds stronger and psychosis along with addiction potential occur at half the dosage for males. The presence of certain male androgens are neuroprotective against amphetamine. Sorry, women.<br /><br />6. Smoking and IV have the same safety profile as other ROA&#039;s when dosages are matched for bioavailibility and may actually be safer because of their shorter half lives. Rats can take single 25mg/kg injections with no neurotoxicity because their amphetamine half life is only one hour compared to the human time of 9-12 hours. Amphetamines are one of the rare drugs where these ROAs are safer because amphetamine neurotoxicity is primarily exacerbated by the time it stays in the body. Unfortunately, binge use with smoking or IV causes half life to be irrelevant and the safety profile becomes much more dangerous.<br /><br />7. If you binge, STAY out places that are hotter than room temperature! Heat literally multiplies the tolerance and deficits you are causing to your brain. And, you must have already caused a lot of deficits if you are dumb enough to be a binge user.<br /><br />To sum it up, DON&#039;T FUCKING BINGE!<br /><br />8. If you have suffered psychosis from amphetamine, I would consider stopping usage. Forever. And yes, even if it only happened once. The implications from psychosis are more than just some temporary effect because you didn&#039;t sleep. Amphetamine psychosis is actually caused by the repeated dosage - sleep deprivation only made your brain more vulnerable. The variables that play into psychosis are so wide that studies have yet to really be conclusive on them. Currently, it is believed that prolonged amphetamine blood plasma induces dopamine hyperreactivity. Guess how schizophrenics are diagnosed? Dopamine hyperactivity. Again, this probably causes lasting deficits.<br /><br />Want to avoid psychosis? Don&#039;t. Binge. It is nearly impossible to induce psychosis if there are more than 5 hours of sleep between dosages unless you were already genetically predisposed.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the schedule a beginner should follow for daily productive use and to prevent neurotoxicity (Assuming 99% bioavailability. Adjust dosages for your ROA bioavailability):<br /><br />Days 1-7: 0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;0.5mg/kg for males, &lt;0.25mg/kg for females <br />No more than once a day<br /><br />For recreational use:<br /><br />Days 1-7:0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;1.0mg/kg for males, &lt;0.5mg/kg for females<br />No more than once every 3-4 days <br /><br />After pretreatment and sensitization, 1.0mg/kg WILL bring a satisfying rush. On a 160 pound person, that would be about 72mg. If it sounds too little to you, than you have gone too far.<br /><br />It&#039;s that simple. Moderation is key, what a surprise huh? If everybody took amphetamines responsibly with milligram scales, we would probably be exploring the universe by now.<br /><br />P.S. As a bonus, take Vitamin C and E for antioxidants. Take Magnesium to slow down acute tolerance (NMDA antagonist = be higher for longer! YAY). Zinc supplementation was also found to be synergistic with amphetamine in ADHD patients. I don&#039;t know its effects on normal people, but I take it anyway. For further reading, look up &quot;Robinson TE&quot;. He is by far my favorite researcher. Another goodie is Carl Hart. He is a forerunner on meth research and always talks about the exaggerated claims on meth. He himself said that scientists have known for a long time that methamphetamine is exactly like dextroamphetamine at a drug policy conference.

Your anecdotal stories mean nothing. PhD in neuroscience or not.<br />Of course as a person working with those who have sought rehabilitation you are seeing a distorted picture of the &#039;average&#039;... your only seeing the worst of the worst while they are at their worst... that is where your anecdotes and attitude come from. Try to realize this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry that you find the comments w/o credibility--there are some things IMHO though that are so well known as to be taken for granted and not in need of strict citation : 1) that meth is among the most addictive drugs known to man with a recovery rate that is abysmal. Two, that among mind altering drugs with legitimate medical purposes, say for instance, amphetmines,&nbsp; opioids, cannabis, benzos, NMDA antagonistic based anesthetics such as ketamine and PCP,&nbsp; amphetamines&nbsp; seem to have the greatest potential for long duration negative&nbsp; behavioral and cognitive side effects. Here I am not talking about addictive behaviors and the negative consequences stemming therefrom but rather the very real possibility of frying ones brain and ending up in a near permanant depession due to dopamine pathway dysregulation, or ending up with a semi-permanant psychosis. I&#039;ve seen both first hand and while they may indeed be the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; I suspect they aren&#039;t--as those folk end up in prison or dead. Now whether it is possible to dabble recreationally is another question altogether--but what I took exception with and forgive my stridency on the point, is that whether a drug is only psychologically addictive vs one like the opioids which are also physically addictive is a potentially misleading and dangerous way to view the subject. This is old school--very old school in fact--theory that suggests addiction blossoms most fruitfully from the seeds of withdrawal--to wit that it is the avoidance of dysphoric physical sensations that drives addiction. My experience and a lot of collective wisdom deems that this is no longer a valid view--the physical piece is only part of a very complicated web of factors that while an important cause of relapse in treatment&nbsp; and before that the inability to escape the tendrils of addiction, it is probably not that important altogether. 3) That of all the neurologically active and important pathways that appear to lead to addictions of all sorts--including compulsive gambling and sexual acting out, the dopaminergic centers in areas of the midbrain such as the vental tegmentum area (VTA) appear to be the most potent. Based on these neurobiological findings,&nbsp; using a drug that directly impacts dopamine levels directly seems to be asking for trouble whether you are spared the shits, goose pimples, myoclonic jerks, and belly cramps--or not. <br /><br />So does every casual recreational user of amphetamines becomes a tweeked out mess? Good gracious, no. Most drugs of whatever stripe end up with a 10-20% addiction rate. What we do know about amphetamines as there have been three major epidemics of addiction--the two in the US being during the 60&#039;s and 80&#039;s-90&#039;s--and all leave one lasting legacy: speed kills. Not everyone obviously, but playing russian roulette with this drug should in my view be done after acquiring experience with many others to see how resistant to the spells of their charms one is. Taking a overly optimistic point of view about the risks/benefits of a particular drug based on some really quaint notions re whether a drug is only psychologically addictive to me a potential recipe for disaster. Just my 2 cents worth. Take it for what its worth.

				First thing you want to do is look up a dosage table, from memory, its something like 20/13/8 methylphenidate/dexamphetamine/methamphetamine.<br />So figure out how much methamphetamine you want as an equivalent to your standard dexamphetamine dosage(I believe adderall is roughly 50% dexamphetamine sulfate/succhrate, not sure though)<br /><br />Next, figure out how many ml of liquid is in each spray, there are several ways to do this, I&#039;d mix a small, measured amount of meth with water, spraying it on a glass tray, and evaporating, compare the amount of meth on the tray with the mg/ml ratio of meth/water in the bottle.&nbsp; Adjust accordingly.<br /><br />

				So each spray is 1/50th of a ml? That doesn&#039;t seem quite right.&nbsp; From memory, most of the spray bottles I&#039;ve used have delivered between 0.1-0.15ml per spray.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said, if true it should still work, the only reference I could find to methamphetamine soluability was here(Clearnet link)<br />http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim334.htm<br />which gives it at 1gm:2ml.<br /><br />If you dissolve till saturation point you should get about 10mg of meth per spray unless my maths has failed me.(Completely possible) 2 sprays up each nostril should get you going pretty well.

				Being a regular user of decongestant sprays, I have much wisdom regarding spray bottles. A 10ml bottle will usually last me around two weeks. Each day I use around 4 sprays. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say 15 days x 4 sprays = 60 sprays =10ml<br /><br />Lets say you dissolve 1 gram meth into 10ml water<br /><br />1gram/60 sprays = 0.017g per spray.

				So about thirty minutes ago, since I couldn&#039;t feel anything. I pulled out a crystal that was about 1/4 the size of my 20mg Ritalin tablets(which are practically all adulterants), and I still can&#039;t feel a fucking thing! <br /><br /><br />Now, I placed the crystal on my tongue. Before I could wash it down with water however, most of it dissolved, and now that I think about it, something similar happened with the first dose. Could this be why I haven&#039;t felt anything all day? <br /><br /><br />EDIT: <br /><br />Alright, about 30-60 minutes after that post, it kicked in, and I&#039;ve felt like I&#039;m on 15mg Adderall for about 2 hours now. <br /><br />However, What I took had to have been at least 30mg(of meth, which is about 2x stronger than Adderall). About 2/3 of it dissolved on my tongue before I swallowed a glass of water. I thought that it would have just been saliva on my tongue which the water would have then rinsed into my stomach. However, could it just have been absorbed INTO my tongue muscles and not my bloodstream?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				This is strange. I recently used some of hammertime&#039;s meth and found it to be pretty strong. Stronger than the meth that I was using before (which was the first I ever tried) and which I also thought was very strong. I also am prescribed dexamp, so I would venture to say that I have a bit of tolerance. A piece the size of the tip of a pencil would at least stimulate me somewhat. <br /><br />Have you used any other drugs lately? Any supplements you take?<br /><br />Your nasal spray idea sounds excellent, I hope that works. If it does, please share your methods :)<br /><br />As it seems like the both of us have just begun using meth, I thought I might share a few thoughts I&#039;ve had during my first few days of use (on and off). If dosed once or twice in the day, meth can be quite pleasant and stimulating/productive. However, more than that and you&#039;ll probably get a more fiendish vibe. The thought of a crystal will possibly make your mouth water and the thought of the burn from insufflation will seem like bliss. I have discovered that meth was perfect for use in the classroom. I paid attention, asked excellent questions, and took stellar notes. I also made a very precise and detailed list about what I should do in order to continue my academic success (homework assignments, readings, etc). However, upon leaving the classroom, I was easily distracted and ended up focusing my energy on comparatively frivolous pursuits. The frivolity of which was apparent during classroom time and now, at the comedown stage. There was a temptation to redose, quite strong at that. Usually the idea of taking a benzo and sleeping sounds nice to me, but right now the idea of doing more meth sounds more appealing than sleep, which is obviously dangerous territory. <br /><br />What I&#039;ve personally discovered (for myself, this may vary from one person to the next of course) is that during the meth &quot;high&quot; (if one could call it that in its lower doses) it is very easy for one to obtain the illusion of productivity. During what I perceived to the peak, I felt as if I was moving so quickly through tasks that I had much more time at my disposal. At this point, I decided to write a rather long and detailed journal entry (hand-written) about my life thus far rather than do work for my classes. Though it was satisfying and I don&#039;t regret writing the journal entry, I would prefer to look back and say that I got quantifiable work done during the use of the drug. This may be a result of my newness to this particular stimulant or personal discipline, but I just thought I&#039;d share my experience. <br /><br />That being said, I still think I&#039;d give this another go but perhaps under different circumstances. I would redose less, take a multivitamin, eat more, drink more water, possibly dose orally rather than nasally, and structure my time more efficiently. It is truly amazing how time slips by on this substance. I didn&#039;t believe it when I read about this, but it definitely does happen. In the present, time seems to be going by so slowly and then as soon as you undertake any task time flys by. <br /><br />I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors, as well as anyone else!&nbsp;

				The few times I&#039;ve binged on Adderall, I&#039;ve had a problem with that happening to me. You want to conquer the world, but simultaneously, you become an OCD perfectionist, wanting to fix every problem and issue. EVERY problem and issue. It&#039;s really easy to be in the middle of&nbsp; homework power-session and notice something, like, &quot;Hey, my desk isn&#039;t perfectly lined up with the wall behind it. I better fix this RIGHT NOW. Hey! In the process of moving my desk, I noticed that behind my desk, the floor sure is dirty. I should vacuum this RIGHT NOW!&quot; and then it snowballs from there. <br /><br />I think the key to avoiding this type of thing is making a time-ordered list before taking the meth of what you&#039;re going to do. If something like my example comes up where you notice, say, your desk isn&#039;t perfectly lined up, just write a note(and you&#039;ll actually probably want a list on a lined piece of paper, or even a composition notebook dedicated to this purpose) saying to attend to it later, and carry on with your current activity that needs to be done. Just make sure not to get caught up listing things that need to be done. <br /><br />A powerful phrase that you need to tell yourself when on the effects of DRI stimulants is, &quot;Let go.&quot; It&#039;s insanely easy to get caught up in the temptation of working on and fixing pointless shit, and it&#039;s insanely easy to justify it, for two reasons: 1: Since you think you&#039;re being productive, you don&#039;t think that you&#039;re doing anything wrong. However, you end up easily overestimating the importance of things like that over the task you&#039;re supposed to be doing, like homework. 2: You might end up thinking, &quot;This homework really needs to be done, but if I don&#039;t clean off my entire collection of DVDs right now, it will stay on the back of my mind until I do clean them all off and it will be chewing at the back of my mind and I won&#039;t even be able to get anything done.&quot; However, this is rarely the case, and as soon as you get the dopamine-filled locomotive that is our brain moving and back on task, you probably forget about it. <br /><br />It might be hard, and harder for some, to be able to let go, but it really is important to be able to do. If you can&#039;t, perhaps you could look into getting a benzo. Not anything powerful enough or in a high enough dose to negate the effects of the meth(or Adderall or Ritalin or whatever), but enough to give you that extra edge to relieve anxiety and help you &quot;let go&quot;. <br /><br />and don&#039;t underestimate the importance of gum, or some other source of oral fixation that isn&#039;t cigarettes, for being on meth. Not for just the comedown, but also for having something to take out your anxiety during the meth high. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As for me... my jaw does this thing where if I move it open leftwards, it will pop/click. Right now, being on what feels like 15mgs/Adderall worth of meth, it isn&#039;t much more problematic/annoying than when I&#039;m sober. However, I really do feel as though is going to get aggravating as all hell as my meth career progresses. <br />

				Damn bynter, thanks for this post. +1.<br /><br />This description is EXACTLY what I experienced, and I think I&#039;ll try your suggestions in the future and see if I can hack it. If not, I&#039;ll try the benzo solution and see if that works. The mantra idea is also quite helpful. Thanks again, my friend. Best of luck to you!

After an hour I get back to my desk and work clear minded for another hour, sometimes push it if I&#039;m in the zone.

				I have been strongly considering this option as a way of assuring that I stick to safe levels of use.<br /><br />This is a TIMED SAFE. It only allows access after X period of time which the owner sets before locking it.<br /><br />CLEARNET LINK!<br />http://captureddiscipline.com/<br /><br />It is $130 which is pretty cheap for the potential harm that this drug holds.&nbsp; It would work well for SR because of the length of time between ordering product and its delivery, it is easier to watch the safe and wait for it to open. <br /><br />It would also be good for just about any other drug.

				In theory it&#039;s genius but anyone that&#039;s had there in&#039;s and out&#039;s with this substance knows that it&#039;s just another road bump. You&#039;re on amphs, you now this safe won&#039;t open till tomorrow morning. So the next morning you end up weighing out a little extra, &quot;ya know, for later, in case my workload gets too heavy.&quot; Before you know it you hide a 0.5 in the bathroom taped under the sink in case you &quot;need a little extra&quot; that your partner/conscience shouldn&#039;t know about&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I think having someone that you&#039;re completely honest with and knows you and your substance ab/use is the most useful tool to have, be it a room mate, co worker, lover/partner.<br />Nothing works better then telling your better half that you&#039;re binging to get your shit back together hahaha

				Well right now I have a few concerns, mainly about the physical dangers of meth usage. <br /><br />1: Recently, my friend(who has ADHD[which I believe is due to low dopamine levels] but also has a family history of schizophrenia[which I&#039;m pretty is caused by high dopamine levels] took about 15mg of Lorazepam, and 140mg of Vyvanse, which led to him going into psychosis for nearly 16 hours. What should I make out of this? <br /><br />2: What&#039;s the deal with meth mouth? There does seem to be any single underlying cause, but from what I&#039;ve made out, is due to teeth grinding+corrosive properties of meth+dry mouth and no saliva+neglected hygiene. Can I completely circumvent meth mouth by making sure to brush my teeth at least once every few hours, taking my meth in an oral gel capsule, forcing myself to drink lots of fluids, and chewing gum to prevent teeth grinding? <br /><br />3: I posted this in the meth review thread, but i realized it&#039;d be more relevant here: Me just getting through High School in 21st century America, I&#039;ve been exposed to a lot of anti-meth propaganda. I&#039;ve seen plenty of &quot;Before and after&quot;s of supposedly five years of meth use. I&#039;m sure you all know exactly what I&#039;m talking about. What exactly is supposed to be behind the supposed accelerated physical aging? Heavy cigarette use to get through the meth comedowns? Clawing at your face? Lack of sleep? You know how respiration is actually destructive to cells? and how meth consumption is alot like overclocking the body? Anything to do with that?

It&#039;s due to some of the corrosive properties of the substance. The cut down on the production of saliva, teeth grinding, possibly vasoconstriction are all possible causes and/or work together to cause tooth decay. The main cause however is possibly the dry mouthness. <br />&quot;It&#039;s a simple fact that having a dry mouth causes bad breath. It is probably not immediately obvious to many of us why this should be so, but the explanation makes sense when you think about it. Our mouths are being constantly bathed by saliva. It keeps the tissues moist and contains antibodies and enzymes that help fight off infection. It plays a key role in controlling the population of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in our mouths.&quot;

				Question for all y&#039;all. How many days do you usually have to wait before you&#039;re back to functioning normally without meth? <br /><br />I don&#039;t and haven&#039;t binged at all, just taken one very small key bump each day for about 4 days. I have noticed tiredness and distractability the following day, which eventually leads me to taking the same size bump to get myself to normal productive standards. I don&#039;t want to get caught in the dependency though, so how long should I set for myself in between usage?

				Damn! this is going to be like five posts in one! <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been messing around with the nasal spray idea, and I&#039;m sad to report that the amount of water that comes out with each spray seems to rather unpredictable.

Actually, the bottle depletion wont even be an issue considering how little 30ul is. <br />If I drop a huge rock in, and then decide I want my meth back in powder form, can I leave the meth water to evaporate without any of the meth evaporating? <br />Also, i asked something like this before, but I didn&#039;t feel like the response adequately answered my question: What&#039;s the water solubility of meth, and how much can&nbsp; possibly be dissolved in 30ul of water w/out it reaching it&#039;s saturation point? <br /><br />ul=µl=microlitre<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.msg723605#msg723605">Quote from: zipstyle on January 13, 2013, 07:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Question for all y&#039;all.

Pretty soon, you have a tolerance and need 80, then 100, by now you cant feel productive in any way unless you have meth in you system, and the&nbsp; slope gets steeper and slipperyer and you cant get the traction you need to slow yourself down.

All the physical neglect coupled with forcing your body to spit out dopamine takes its toll on your brain. You think everyones out to get you, the police are gonna kick down your door at any minute. You go psycotic half the time you get high, and the axiety when the meth runs out is totally unberable. Not even the meth will make you happy, it will only hold off the anxiety and depression. Youve thrown your life any with no job, no friends, and no future. One day, your body cant take anymore. You havent eaten or slept in two weeks, and you have no energy. So you crawl into a corner and pass out, fatigue winning over meth. Only you dont wake up. No one will miss you.

				No, it is NOT good to take aspirin with meth.&nbsp; Methamphetamine in small, clinical doses (sub-80mg or so a day) has little effect on your blood pressure (varies by person of course), but when you get past that it can quickly result in very high blood pressure.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen mine spike by 20+, once or twice in the middle of a run I&#039;ve taken it and seen it at over 160/120.&nbsp; That&#039;s very high for just sitting around fucking with stuff.<br /><br />Aspirin thins your blood.&nbsp; If a blood vessel bursts because of the higher blood pressure from amphetamine, your blood HAS to clot.&nbsp; But blood thinners suppress this, so basically you keep bleeding longer than you normally would.&nbsp; It&#039;s a &quot;it can make a bad situation much worse,&quot; thing.&nbsp; It won&#039;t always hurt you, I mean I take aspirin on rare occasions... but it&#039;s definitely not something you want to do regularly.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to argue either way here, but I&#039;d also like to say this: if you think willpower alone is enough to not take a drug...

Hell, I&#039;d even go so far as to say that the self control involved in self-regulating cannabis use and the self control to regulate your own meth use operate on different criteria. I agree, addiction to something like meth can easily be more powerful than the willpower of Andrew Ryan. But I&#039;m just saying there&#039;s a limit to the addiction/willpower ratio that you should be over if you&#039;re messing around with hard drugs. I am a full advocate of the timed-safe idea. I&#039;m just saying that you should take a look at your life, heavily reconsider your drug use, and really, realistically evaluate how addicted you are if you&#039;re not even capable of limiting yourself with a self-timing safe. <br /><br />But you&#039;re right. I am somewhat new to drugs. Two years ago, the very concept made me shudder, and only very recently have I started seriously using any.

I can see a lot of truth in it. I mean, I know there&#039;s a reason why the EC stack has overtaken the ECA stack in popularity, in recent times.

What should I make out of this? <br /><br />2: What&#039;s the deal with meth mouth? There does seem to be any single underlying cause, but from what I&#039;ve made out, is due to teeth grinding+corrosive properties of meth+dry mouth and no saliva+neglected hygiene. Can I completely circumvent meth mouth by making sure to brush my teeth at least once every few hours, taking my meth in an oral gel capsule, forcing myself to drink lots of fluids, and chewing gum to prevent teeth grinding? <br /><br />3: I posted this in the meth review thread, but i realized it&#039;d be more relevant here: Me just getting through High School in 21st century America, I&#039;ve been exposed to a lot of anti-meth propaganda. I&#039;ve seen plenty of &quot;Before and after&quot;s of supposedly five years of meth use. I&#039;m sure you all know exactly what I&#039;m talking about. What exactly is supposed to be behind the supposed accelerated physical aging? Heavy cigarette use to get through the meth comedowns? Clawing at your face? Lack of sleep? You know how respiration is actually destructive to cells? and how meth consumption is alot like overclocking the body? Anything to do with that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I went to the dentist recently. Saw an Xray of MY face. Less than 2 months of use. I thought I was being liberal about my intake, drinking enough water, and taking enough vitamins. I was wrong. The nurse looked at it for another reason but mumbled that the area which appeared to be my top gums was darker than usual. She commented that it must be less dense than the other cartilage such as my lower gums. She had nothing bad to say about my teeth.&nbsp; I feel like it is logical to assume that lack of saliva would impact the upper gums first, as it does not pool saliva the bottom lip does. <br /><br />I brush my teeth twice every day as well as flossing.<br />I think one of the main things about keeping teeth clean while smoking is rinsing out the mouth between puffs, to saturate and clean the mouth. <br />I have smoked very little. The nose is where it goes.&nbsp; <br />I have no evidence to support that this was caused by meth use, but it does make me worry.&nbsp; <br /><br />*Brushing too often causes gums to recede, so I would not recommend brushing every few hours.*

Stay away from taking too many benzos, as they can increase (at least they do for me) the ADHD symptoms. I only take benzos on certain nights where I absolutely have to and even then I make sure to wean myself off of them. Always be wary, always be afraid of addiction.

I was trying to specifically refer to you AT ALL. I was talking about just people in general. What I meant was that if you&#039;re messing around with hard drugs, know your mind, and know how much willpower you have. Use this knowledge to make appropriate measures.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve actually spent the last 24 hours or so on what could arguably be called my first meth binge. and HOLY SHIT, have I gained a new respect for this drug. I mean, I&#039;m pretty well used to the effects of Adderall, but damn! A powerful substance in every respect of the word. You play with fire, you can cook stuff, you can light up dark areas, you can heat up your house. and can also burn yourself, or you can burn an entire forest down. <br /><br />No fucking wonder there&#039;s such a colossal anti-meth campaign. &quot;Not even once&quot; makes a lot more sense now. That initial high dose really was a &quot;fruit of knowledge&quot;. I thought keeping yourself from not redosing when you shouldn&#039;t was just a matter of willpower. I never would have expected that it would change your active, conscience decision making. Willpower can&#039;t make less a difference when the meth convinces your inner monologue that redosing is a GOOD idea. I can&#039;t imagine how hard it would be to fight that temptation on a high smoked or IVed dose, even if you knew it was the bad decision. Fucking Andrew Ryan(I know I already used this example a few posts ago)from Bioshock wouldn&#039;t have enough willpower to resist that temptation if he was in the presence of a supply.<br /><br />Right now, I don&#039;t even have any sort of appreciation for what I was just feeling a few hours ago. If it weren&#039;t for that my brain forced me to rehearse all this information while I was peaking, and for that I&#039;m looking at this erratic, jerky journal of phrases and words I wrote at the time, I would have no conscience memory of just how powerful the energy was that was going through my mind, just a few hours ago. <br />If it weren&#039;t for all the posts I&#039;ve read on this thread, the cautious, very back part of my brain never would have been able to pick up on the signs that my binge was starting to get out of control. Even then, I still had to acknowledge&nbsp; that it was correct, not paranoid, and even then, I still had to have the willpower to abstain from a redose. I consider myself lucky for realizing this pattern so early in my meth career. This 3.5g bag of mine just got a LOT scarier. Meth really is an awful, wonderfully horrible, amazing drug. <br /><br />Full experience report coming within the next few days!

				Bynter, me and you are in the same place, I got a 3.5 bag, and really I&#039;m afraid of it now. I tried taking a tiny bit today after finally getting some sleep and it just gave me a little taste of who and where and what I was when I was tweaking 2 days ago... It was like I was someone else, and not in the same way any other drug has felt. <br /><br />I&#039;m still weirder out by my experience. It wasn&#039;t fun, it was scary, and dark... The first time I took it, about 2 months ago, I totally enjoyed it, but that was a .25 bag that I used conservatively and even shared close to half. For some reason this time I forgot that when you crush it and snort it, you use less because crushing it increases its size. Anyway this time I just scooped like a half gram in some coffee and went directly into a really dark and intense place, and stayed there for 3 days I think?

				Thanks for sharing guys. I have less than 1 gram in my possession right now and I haven&#039;t done more than probably 150 mg(?) of it over about 2 weeks&nbsp; :o and I&#039;m already questioning whether I can control myself. Maybe I&#039;m overly paranoid, maybe I&#039;m not. But I sure hope you guys take care and flush the stuff if need be. I know I&#039;ve been considering the possibility if I find myself in a bad/negative direction as a result of the meth. Make sure you&#039;re getting SOMETHING positive out of it. Like something real, that sober, non-meth people will appreciate. Anyways, keep safe bynter, you sound like a cool guy. Don&#039;t lose yourself to evil crystals. If it comes to it, we&#039;ll flush together. :)

If you can&#039;t have a self limit of two a day, make a self limit of three a day, but whatever you do, don&#039;t break the limit you set for yourself!

				Forgive me for the double post everyone, I just thought I&#039;d share my most recent development with regards to my methamphetamine use. After taking about four days off (no meth at all, but continuing with vyvanse prescribed dosage schedule) I decided to try meth one more time before deciding that it was too dangerous for me. This time, I tried the oral route instead of insufflation, which I had been doing before. <br /><br />Granted, even when I tried using meth via insufflation, I made sure I dosed only once and I was only doing about a matchstick head&#039;s worth. This time, I followed two rules for the experiment: (1) Dose orally without vyvanse or any other form of dextroamphetamine and (2) do not redose. <br /><br />I put about two small keybumps worth into a gelatin capsule (in the past I was doing 1 keybump and stopping) because I know that the oral bio-availability drops to 50% or something like that. I took the capsule after eating a good breakfast and found that I had very smooth, sustained stimulation throughout the day. In fact, I never noticed when it wore off to be honest. I would not, however, suggest that this be done daily or with any level of frequency, but I think that it can definitely be useful and quite effective when used in this manner. Also, I have come to the conclusion that it might just be better for people to stick to dextroamphetamine. It&#039;s (more) legal, easily obtainable, and works almost exactly the same at low doses, which is what I want it for anyways. Yes, meth has more recreational value because the euphoria is much more pleasurable than dextro&#039;s. So if you&#039;re looking to go to tweak heaven, then meth is your answer. Or maybe MDPV. But for me, the comedowns are definitely not worth the high. So I will settle for what&#039;s in between. <br /><br />I hope this is helpful to someone :)

				It is good to read all you guys doing meth for a semester workload fulcrum.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I &#039;played&#039; for the first time last year, I was at the time a crazy old man of fifty! I had a South East Asian hooker of thirty who was my muse and supplier. I would pay the bills and she would show up with the pipe and re-hydration until I had to fly out (I was doing it on business trips).<br /><br />I miss it.<br /><br />I hope I never am insane enough to finalize on it on SR. I think the SEA stuff was low quality compared to what is on SR and I would be lost. I don&#039;t even want to watch the seasons of Breaking Bad on my HDD in case I get turned on to using again.<br /><br />One night me and the girl were going to double our dose -up until then we were sharing a point a night. She got scammed by her dealer, but the scam was set up in such a way that we could not be sure LEO were involved, so we had to ditch our plans entirely, and I sent her home. Maybe that scam saved my life, I don&#039;t know, and I&#039;m not here to lecture, just know when to pull the pin on this one guys, for the love of heaven...<br /><br />Another guy my age had his life hijacked for seven years on this stuff. He is five years clean now, and there is never going to be a time when he can do ANYTHING in case it leads back to meth. You may have to throw away an entire life of using by design, just for the sake of bare-backing the witch called Tina for a few nightmarish years and that&#039;s if you&#039;re lucky. <br /><br />The OP saying &#039;just don&#039;t binge&#039; is like Nancy fucking Reagan saying &#039;Just say no&#039;. It&#039;s a nice theory, ain&#039;t gonna happen in most cases, it won&#039;t in mine, are y&#039;all honest enough with yourselves?<br /><br />m.

I don&#039;t have that kind of time to spend on a meth comedown. And I don&#039;t have the time to be tweaked out either haha. So I&#039;ll settle for not getting tweaked, and only use it in the ways that I know it will benefit me. It&#039;s also strange that I only really get the urge to take more stimulants when my medication (vyvanse) wears off. And at that point it&#039;s too late to take stims...I&#039;ll be up all night! So I figure as long as I keep taking my meds and have rational goals in my life I am able to be rational about meth use. Ok done rambling about how I&#039;m not going to get addicted to meth. Only time will tell but I&#039;m pretty confident I&#039;m doing fine.<br />

I personally enjoyed the high that it gave me when I took a reasonable sized dose intranasally, but for me that high was not worth the issues that I dealt with during the comedown. I&#039;ve come to recognize meth now not as a quick portal to euphoria or pleasure, but rather as a very efficient and effective tool to increase cognitive and physical capacities. In order to accomplish these functions, low non-binge doses have to be implemented. Binging, in fact, produces the opposite results. <br /><br />This is the way that I think of it: there are some people that are able to grow to the point where they realize that it really is best and most enjoyable to only drink a certain amount when they go out at night. When I go out, for example, I only drink about two drinks. I get a nice buzz, feel social, maybe dance a bit and then go home and drink water, and eat something. I&#039;ve binged on alcohol before, gotten drunk, wasted, and even plastered. But I&#039;ve decided that I most enjoy getting the nice, mildly euphoric buzz off the first two drinks. There are little consequences when alcohol is experienced this way. This is the general idea that society tells us about drinking. However, you have your alcoholics who just can&#039;t stop. It&#039;s not their fault, they just can&#039;t help it. And I don&#039;t blame or judge them. I do, however, think it is their responsibility to stay the FUCK away from alcohol. If you know you have a problem, don&#039;t poke sticks at it.<br /><br />Now relate this analogy to meth. It surely would be NICE (in my mind) to take a large quantity of meth and go WHEEEEE all the way to tweakerland and euphoria heaven. However, the reality is that doing so will only result in an increased level of suffering on my part. The comedown (which is like the hungover effect from alcohol that leaves you heaving over the toilet) is directly proportional to the high. So why not be able to enjoy the subtle enhancing effects of the drug without major consequences? A &quot;responsible&quot; (to use the terminology from this thread) user will be able to see this inherent problem with meth binges and react accordingly. An addict, however, (quite like the alcoholic) will have some trouble seeing that there is any other way to use the drug besides the binges. The addict is unable to change his usage patterns and therefore should not be using the drug as the drug is no longer a tool of production, it is now a tool of self-destruction.<br /><br />I believe that all forms of reckless abandoned debauchery are self-destructive. Sometimes self-destruction is necessary in life. It somehow brings us face-to-face with our humanity and with our own mortality. But when your main goal and focus in life IS to self-destruct, well then here we might have an issue. In this mode of living, not only does the self-destructive individual suffer (later on, not during the destruction process), but so do all the people that this individual has connections with. It&#039;s similarly as selfish as suicide. <br /><br />tl;dr- If you can use a drug in moderation, do so. If you can&#039;t, it&#039;s probably best not to use that drug. Sometimes it&#039;s okay to binge. Sometimes you just have to be a part of an orgy. So long as you don&#039;t make that the main focus of your life. Because then you will hurt not only yourself, but also those around you.<br /><br />

				Remember that big melodramatic post I made a page or so back about my first meth binge? I took 30mg intranasl, I was so amphed up I couldn&#039;t look straight ahead of me for more than five seconds because I was so busy shaking my head from all the energy &amp; tearing up my house looking for one thing of chapistick.&nbsp; but that was then....<br /><br />But today.....<br /><br />So I&#039;ve been binging for about 36 hours(doses was never more than 10mg oral at a time, sometimes just 5)because I&#039;ve NEEDED to do homework. and a few hours ago I started to get sleepy, &amp; I was just about to begin &quot;the big essay&quot;, so I took 20mg intranasally. A short while later, my mouth got kinda dry for like a half hour, and that was it. <br />

				AHA! It all makes sense now! Shortly after I insulated the 20mg and I kind-of felt the effects: Well, that was the 5mg capsule I had taken a few hours before, and it was finally kicking in. I just recently felt a rush, and that could have only been from the twenty mgs I had taken prior. It appears my body is is extremely efficient, yet slow at processing amphetamines. I felt the effects of 70mg Vyvance 18 hours I had taken it, for God&#039;s sake!

Though not life threatening, they are long term, if not permanent. <br /><br />I think the main reason it is so destructive is that all forms of administering the drug have serious side effects. The nose easily sheds its mucus membrane after constant abuse, leading to much more serious issues. Smoking puts all of the chemicals into your lungs, and the dry mouth causes gums to recede even with very careful oral care. Swallowing is the safest route, but often people get bored with it. IV is theoretically safe but has many ways to kill the user. People become addicted to the process which goes with their drug of choice, weather its the burn of the line, the smoke billowing out of their mouth, the needle in their arm, or watching the crystal melt and begin to feed you pleasure. <br /><br />One of the other attributes is the lack of sleep. When we sleep is when our body heals itself. By refusing to sleep, your body becomes unable to do any maintenance. This results in a weak immune system and a weak body in general. To add to the issue, few people addicted to meth take proper supplements and vitamins to help stay healthy.<br /><br />There are many ways the body takes wear and tear but nothing is worse than running ones heart on overdrive for many waking hours of their life. Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S. There is not one thing that can be pointed to as the cause of destruction, it is the whole mentality and action which causes the bodily harm. Also, everybody has a different body, which can endure different levels of abuse.

It really helps keep tolerance under control, especially if you take 10 mg in the morning and 10 mg at night. I&#039;ve noticed significant improvements on amphetamine effects after starting that regimen.<br /><br />I would say try that before doubling up your dose. Or if you can&#039;t get memantine anytime soon, get a magnesium supplement and take about 1000 mg daily while you wait for your memantine to arrive. Hopefully this will lower tolerance a bit for you and save you having to up your dose.<br /><br />I also assume the worst when people on drug forums go missing lol. I&#039;m trying to take a break from meth right now (it&#039;s honestly just too good for me to take with any kind of regularity) and sticking to dexamphetamine. Gotta say that meth really does feel like that missing puzzle piece and that&#039;s the scariest part for me :/&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh well, you do what you gotta do to perform how you want to perform. Wishing you all the best! <br />Keep that tolerance on the DL.

				Yes, &quot;meth&quot; does not seem to be as good as regular amphetamine. This may be due to the fact that the average purity of d-methamphetamine hydrochloride in &quot;meth&quot; is 40%. SR included.<br /><br />But don&#039;t just take my word for it... =)

				a personal tip from me is if you are thinking about trying meth and you like watching porn and you combine the two together you will probably never be able to look at porn without wishing for meth ever again. its a rapidly addictive combo..<br />

				tocadisco, I personally use Buy-pharma.com often and it&#039;s quite good. Shipping is a bit slow, so definitely place your orders accordingly. It is legit and has memantine at good prices. While you&#039;re on there, look into etizolam for the comedown (though if you have enough GHB left you probably won&#039;t need it) and mirtazepine for sleep and mood stabilization. An alternative to mirtazepine that doesn&#039;t induce sleep but is a very effective antidepressant is stablon. In order to notice a significant change in tolerance, you need to stop taking the amphetamine for 2-3 days WHILE taking the NDMA antagonist 2 times a day. Then when you go back to your stim dose, you should notice that you need much less to achieve the same effects. So start lower than what you took the previous time. <br /><br />I hope that helped :)

				I&#039;d like to balance this advice out with a snippet from Wikipedia (and it&#039;s NMDA, just FYI):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Wikipedia</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NMDA receptor antagonists are a class of anesthetics that work to antagonize, or inhibit the action of, the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). They are used as anesthesia for animals and, less commonly, for humans; the state of anesthesia they induce is referred to as dissociative anesthesia. There is evidence that NMDA receptor antagonists can cause a certain type of neurotoxicity or brain damage referred to as Olney&#039;s Lesions in rodents, although such damage has never been conclusively observed in primates like humans, however, in adolescent cynomolgus monkeys that were injected daily with the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, ketamine, there were some definite neurologic deficits observed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d take an NMDA antagonist long term.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just me.<br />

				You got dis, Toca.<br />And it&#039;s true. The problem with meth isn&#039;t how BAD it is, it&#039;s that its TOO GOOD. <br />I was able to stop using it the way I was when I first got it and I&#039;m still trying to decide when are okay times to take small doses of it. In the meantime, (dextro)amphetamine is a good way to go.

I&#039;ve kept my dosages minimal/none for a week or so and it&#039;s a bit of a downer. I mean, I limit myself to ensure I&#039;m not just abusing the shit out of the stuff but at the same time a bad day or a rough day or a long day leaves me feeling like shit and I can&#039;t help but think &quot;if I had done or if I do a little meth...I&#039;d be feeling so much better&quot;<br /><br />Ah man. I&#039;m getting all depressed and lousy feeling (not drug-related[for the most part]--just been a rough few weeks) just thinking about staggering through these days without taking help when I have access to it.<br /><br />Anyways, good info Zip.

				Well first of all, this changes from person to person. <br />Your overall health when taking meth will affect it, your metabolism, drug history, etc.<br /><br />To the best of my ability, I will say that a person can &quot;safely&quot; use meth once a month at doses under 100 mg and be okay. However, this varies greatly from one person to the next. Also, the health risks increase the more times a person redoses and the higher the dose a person uses. <br /><br />You will definitely notice some adverse effects from meth if you take it more than two days in a row. Even more adverse effects will be present if you don&#039;t eat and sleep properly. <br /><br />By smoking in particular, some of the biggest health risks are to your mouth itself. Even when taken orally, meth restricts the blood vessels in your gums (and other extremities as well) and saliva production, thus reducing your gums&#039; ability to fight off infection and bacteria. When you smoke meth, the vapor you are inhaling is pretty corrosive. So if you add the corrosive nature of meth vapor to dry gums, it is very easy to accelerate tooth and gum decay. This can be minimized by brushing/using a flouride rinse after each smoking session, but excessive brushing is also not good for you. <br /><br />Bottom line: however you do meth, you will be taking risks. The best way to minimize these risks is to stick to the lowest effective dose, avoid redosing, and avoid using with any kind of regularity.

				Man... Meth. I gotta say, if there&#039;s anything that worries me about SilkRoad it&#039;s having such easy access to high quality Methamphetamine. A lot of this thread is talking about safe ways to do it - never binge, never do more than 100-200mg a day, eat, sleep, test... which is great, in theory, but for me would last a good hour or so. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I still try to sleep, and I&#039;ll eat something when I remember, but when I&#039;m getting tweaked I&#039;m gonna get fucking TWEAKED. You know those little toy cars that you roll the wheels backwards on to wind up and then let go? How as a kid you would pull it back again and again and again as hard as you can to try to get it to go as fast and hard as you could? That&#039;s Meth.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a meth problem, per se, but I&#039;ve been on the precipice. I have a sensitive tooth that will remind me every so often just how bad the drug is for me, how close I got to true addiction. I never lost anything, never even bought it for myself. Nonetheless, I love meth. I love it so much I can&#039;t let myself do it. If I get any amount, I&#039;m gonna tweak until I don&#039;t have any left. Even if I go into it with the best intentions, that shit is going to be GONE in a day. I often fantasize about getting a teener of the best crystal I can find and getting gacked for a weekend in a hotel with an unlimited supply of pornography.<br /><br />I think a lot of that has to do with lifelong ADD and how stimulants kinda slow me down (at first). I love cocaine, I&#039;m looking to try some pharm grade amphetamines if I can find em cheap (Not this $15 a pill shit, I sure wish there was a domestic Amphetamine vendor), but the high from meth is everything I ever wanted in a drug. An Energetic calm, a feeling of invincibility, metaphorically planting your feet firmly in the earth, and a complete lack of give a fuck about what people think of me. Yes, I&#039;m going to look at this one porno mag for the next 6 hours and not even bother getting hard, and it&#039;s going to be amazing - do you have a problem with that? Hell, I couldn&#039;t sleep last night due to intense cravings for some ice, and I haven&#039;t even seen the stuff in over 18 months. Sometimes I wish something horrible would happen in my life that could warrant me going off the deep end and retreating into a world of tweak and hookers (then I feel terrible about it).<br /><br />The one redeeming factor (for my health and well being) is that I really hate tweakers. Love tweak, hate the scene. Jail, Gangs, generally untrustworthy people and any and every type of debauchery there is is there in the meth scene somewhere. Saw a lot of friends fall down the rabbit hole to never come back out. A couple of them tried to crawl out... but just got stomped down. I like to think they&#039;re better now, seeing as I cut off all contact years ago, but the last I saw any of em they just weren&#039;t the same people anymore. <br /><br />That, and the comedown is out of this world bad for me. There&#039;s few things worse than finally being hungry - no, STARVING - and not being able to eat thanks to a mouth covered in painful sores due to moving my tongue at a constant 90 mph for days on end.<br /><br />I&#039;m not completely sure why I&#039;m posting this, other than it&#039;s something I felt I needed to get off my chest. Throw it out into the ether, I suppose. Still, maybe someone can learn something from me here. Some people can dance with the devil and escape with their soul in tact... but they may always long for just one more waltz.

I lost a fuck load of muscle, got very depressed then ended up using more. even protein shakes and amino acids during the day on meth does not work for muscle loss. <br /><br />luckily i have a passion for the gym, strength training, specifically. i couldn&#039;t imagine losing my athletic and built stature for life. that is the only thing that keeps me from going down the rabbit hole for good. i quit for 2 weeks every now and again, and my weight doesn&#039;t fluctuate too much, due to the fact that my metabolism is fucking fast as shit now (i think meth has changed it permanently/temporarily) .<br /><br />When i take a break i go back on my anabolics for the gym, i eat like a fucking pig. then when i go back on meth, i look frail and skinny until a day or two after i stop. my anabolics definitely prevent muscle loss during my meth use, as meth is extremely anti-catabolic and sheds away at muscle. <br /><br />it&#039;s relatively easy for me to quit. i have obligations, goals, a future. i know meth can strip this away , as i had already let it before. and i learned my damn lesson.<br /><br />like today, i will quit around 11pm, its only been 4 days with sleep every night. so, i will lock my gear up in my safe and put the key far away from my reach, then go to the gym the next night. i will just take some L-Dopa / 5-htp. it helps tremendously. just thinking about the way i use meth, makes me want to fuck the shit out of the gym. and i do.<br /><br />good luck man! =)

I&#039;m definitely a fan of certain types of sin and debauchery, that&#039;s for sure. I apologize for generalizing, I know that can be annoying, so please allow me to clarify. <br /><br />Responsible users of any drug are rarely ever a problem. The problem arises that the Methamphetamine &quot;Scene&quot; (Generally speaking from my own experience here) isn&#039;t one that encourages safe practices and tends to be wrapped up heavily in those forms of criminality which I don&#039;t have a soft spot for. Robbery, Murder, Rape, a friend of mine even witnessed some pretty brutal torture via blowtorch to a fellow that was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong people who thought he had some very important information. Myself and a friend of mine were the the target of a terribly executed attempted murder as a result of a stupid practical joke played by someone we didn&#039;t even know on an old friend who considered himself hard after being awake for a month. That same friend who I defended from said attempted murder later pulled a shotgun on me because I told him the shadow people he was seeing out the window weren&#039;t real, and weren&#039;t really going to assault his homestead anytime soon. I feel I should mention I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s the drug itself that is the cause of this, but the lack of sleep (and of course, the user themselves).

I&#039;m definitely a fan of certain types of sin and debauchery, that&#039;s for sure. I apologize for generalizing, I know that can be annoying, so please allow me to clarify. <br /><br />Responsible users of any drug are rarely ever a problem. The problem arises that the Methamphetamine &quot;Scene&quot; (Generally speaking from my own experience here) isn&#039;t one that encourages safe practices and tends to be wrapped up heavily in those forms of criminality which I don&#039;t have a soft spot for. Robbery, Murder, Rape, a friend of mine even witnessed some pretty brutal torture via blowtorch to a fellow that was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong people who thought he had some very important information. Myself and a friend of mine were the the target of a terribly executed attempted murder as a result of a stupid practical joke played by someone we didn&#039;t even know on an old friend who considered himself hard after being awake for a month. That same friend who I defended from said attempted murder later pulled a shotgun on me because I told him the shadow people he was seeing out the window weren&#039;t real, and weren&#039;t really going to assault his homestead anytime soon.

The next night I ate a xanoflex to try to sleep and that was... interesting, to say the least. Definitely did not work as intended.

				So i no longer achieve any euphoria from meth anymore. At all! what is going on?<br /><br />Received two different types of meth&#039;s recently . Tried various ROA&#039;s , rectal/smoke/snort.<br />none give me the same effect that i used to have many months ago.<br /><br />i took three days off and used ketamine and massive amounts of magnesium for ndma antagonists. <br />guess what, it definitely helps your tolerance! But nothing for the extreme rush/euphoria.<br /><br />did anyone lose the power to achieve euphoria with meth? i only get extremely focused and rushy.<br /><br />my doses are 50-100mg at a time. and small bumps in between. re-dosing quite often.<br /><br />so i am not meth naive so to say.

				One important thing to note is that you&#039;re not chasing the euphoria with meth use, SS. I think that&#039;s why you&#039;re not having delusions, hallucinations, etc. I might be wrong though, just thought I&#039;d point that part out...

				I use meth only occasionally. I don&#039;t know what meth comedown is. Here what I do:<br />- dose orally once in the morning<br />- do all the work I needed to do<br />- then add some weed (I would recommend sativa)have a nice walk<br />- by the end have dinner with some wine (feels awesome ) and go to sleep easily<br />- sleep good 6 hours and have even kinda meth afterglow next day<br />

Thing is, as has been discussed over and over (it&#039;s a recurring theme with meth/stim use), it&#039;s very easy to use once a month and then one month you&#039;ll have an especially large workload and you&#039;ll want to use meth for that, and then you start finding more and more uses for the drug. If/when that happens, you&#039;d have to take a break for a while or else get stuck in a cycle that will become detrimental to your health and well-being in the long run. You might be able to use even less than .05 for each session and still have pretty good effects if you don&#039;t have amphetamine tolerance. I would suggest using the smallest amount possible each time you use because tolerance develops quickly. You can start out using 15-25 mg at first and it will probably work considerably well. Just be very aware and honest about your use. Keep track of when you dose, what the effects were, and how long you plan on waiting before dosing again. <br /><br />For more info, I suggest you read SelfSovereignty&#039;s posts in the previous pages of this thread. He gives a very honest and (in my opinion) accurate perspective on amphetamine use.

				Using once a month won&#039;t really affect you.<br /><br />Hell, using once a week won&#039;t really affect you.<br /><br />But who uses meth once a week for a long period of time?&nbsp; Lol.<br /><br />Well I&#039;m clean nearing 3 months now come next week.&nbsp; I&#039;m always tempted in the back of my mind to give it one more try and see if I can&#039;t control that shit.&nbsp; But I&#039;m also a little put off by the notion that I&#039;ll get hooked right back into that cycle.

				im on a break day 1 here. its specifically for a tolerance break. ive been using 4 or 5 months on a fortnightly weekly irregularly pattern of usage. the whole 4 or 5 months my total amount of usage was about 8 or 9 grams. 7 grams of that was from kush411 so it was good stuff<br /><br />last 8 days or so i used everyday though.. slipped down the slope. the number of days i did it is a bit foggy but i did sleep every night with xanax. what i claim to be 8 days of straight usage is just a guess because i just know it was less than 2 weeks im foggy on everything about it. anyhow for 3 days of that time i didnt use and got depressed as fuck.<br /><br />so im using l-tyrosine for a month or so from now on and just going to use lexapro for long term 6 months for non-meth reasons. no access to 5-htp here so lexapros quick 5 day lifting effect on me last year might be just as good if im going to feel miserable for a month. if i could get l-dopa i would but i suspect its available prescription only here.<br /><br /><br />so yesterday was my last day and i run meth into the mud in that 8 day or so consecutive usage. the tolerances are so up its fucken pointless to use. id rather be depressed and try it when i come off the lexapro.<br /><br />i am asking you if the abstince from meth for 6 or 7 months will bring back the magic ive lost due to this 8 day run? i dont get that mental horny feeling , porn looks the same as sober and its boring. last night the only high was feeling like was gonna have a heart attack.<br /><br />ive read various things about tolerance but does the magic ever come back after 6 or 7 months of abstinence?.. is the porn gonna look amazing again? will i be a mental hornbag? if not.. thats the end of it for me. i liked it as a sex drug. im&nbsp; wondering if its all ruined.. will it even come close to what it was like the first time i tried it?

				I wish I&#039;d known about this post from day one, it should be a standard link on home pages of meth vendors..<br /><br />I&#039;ve come here after starting these two threads<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182639.0&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Meth - Recovering / Recharging<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182590.0 Meth - Health Advice and Discussion<br />This thread has a lot about diet strategies.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a summary of my usage over around 4 or 5 months?<br /><br />Thankfully I may be kind of in line with the suggestions there.&nbsp; E.g. I&#039;ve stuck with oral use, tried sniffing a small amount a handful of times but I&#039;ll cut that right out.&nbsp; Never gone through more 3/4 of a point in day which would be HUGE for me (maybe 75mgs), generally a point would last two days (~50mg / day), assuming the measure was accurate from the vendor (I never thought I&#039;d be happy if a vendor was under weighing).&nbsp; I actually started with dexamphetamine pills, I think I started with one or two, maybe 6 in a day on a big day.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember going as high as 8 (40mgs / day) in that in that initial time, with that usage level maintained not exceeded for a month or more, and initially for a month or so was only on weekends.&nbsp; Yeah it felt pretty amazing back then (a few months ago).<br /><br />So the most I&#039;ve probably done now I&#039;m using meth powder (orally) is around 50mgs / day (half a point), but more often over a week and on weekends, with breaks of a few days or a week in between - not out of discipline but lack of supply or just couldn&#039;t be bothered and was still mostly weekend use only.&nbsp; Week use in addition to weekend use (intermittent, not always daily or consistent) started about a month or so ago.&nbsp; This week I may have exceeded this a litle, maybe a few days straight with one point (100mgs) spread out, but after possibly a few weeks of fairly consistent use with a point (100mgs) spread out every few days or up to a week, with some weekends with a point over both days (50mgs / day I think).<br /><br />I don&#039;t seem to get that initial euphoria as much at the moment though. maybe recently more so because by my standards anyway, I went pretty &#039;hard&#039; by using it consistently over three or four days, with some sleep disruption / insomnia over about two days..&nbsp; I&#039;d be surprised if I managed to exceed 60mgs a day but that&#039;d be pretty extreme for me and I hope I haven&#039;t (it&#039;s hard to tell with this and without a micro scale).&nbsp; I was getting a bit of a headache last few days though, and a slight headache now (side of the head / temples).&nbsp; It really is hard to guage dose though except by assuming what I&#039;ve been given is really one point or 100mgs and I split that out in to say five piles and try not to exceed half in a day, or 3/4 on a really big weekend day.<br /><br />But thankfully when I started I didn&#039;t go straight in with stupid shit like smoking a point (100mgs) in an hour, or even smoking or snorting full stop and always prepared and supported myself with heaps of water and healthy food and exercise and sleep.&nbsp; My initial use was purely oral (dexamphetamine) pills @ 5mgs each, over a month or so with up to 40mgs or so a day on a &#039;hard weekend&#039; during the day, with no sleep disruption.&nbsp; I only got sleep disruption recently when I started using meth powder (orally) a bit later in the day.<br /><br />The bit about taking years to recover is a worry.&nbsp; I hope that&#039;s an extreme example for binge snorters and smokers.&nbsp; This week did feel a bit &#039;hard&#039; for me by my standards.<br /><br />The good news is I don&#039;t seem to get any or noticeable withdrawal, as in I can say yeah that&#039;s enough for the day and just leave it and biggest &#039;worry&#039; I have is if I will sleep ok.<br /><br />It can be sitting right in front of me and I don&#039;t feel tempted, even the next day.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s a good sign, and / or that I&#039;m disciplined.&nbsp; There&#039;s a whole point ready to roll and I just can&#039;t be bothered.&nbsp; And I actually feel ok at the moment, just a little foggy but far from depressed.&nbsp; I feel emotionally pumped.<br /><br />Sounds like I may need to consider staying off it for 5 days, but I was hoping to lay off it just two or three days and have another amazing weekend..&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using it orally in small doses (sometimes with 100mgs or a point lasting a week) but it&#039;s really hard to dose correctly.&nbsp; I try to split out the powder in to say five lots and dose that way but it&#039;s very difficult to work out.<br /><br />Holy cow that post is very sobering though, I think after my last delivery I&#039;ll cut it out for a month or so and consider this sensitising thing.&nbsp; I hope I haven&#039;t pushed it too far as it is.&nbsp; In this case I used about a point I think (100mgs) in about 3 days, which is excessive for me.&nbsp; Daytime use only btw, I don&#039;t do all night binges, and not in heated rooms or crap like that.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping the fanatical health focus has helped too.<br /><br />I also feel a bit turned off it at the moment, definitely not any withdrawal, bit like seing a beer and not feelig tempted after a big night.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t take it now if it was offered to me a gold plate, I just have no desire for it at the moment.&nbsp; Slept like a log last night too after downing two raw eggs too.<br /><br />What are the specific symptoms to look out for telling you you&#039;ve gone too hard?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t do the &#039;once a month&#039; thing and I&#039;m now worried that I&#039;ve blown that &#039;sensitisation&#039; window thing and now have to wait what two years to get that &#039;feeling&#039; back again?&nbsp; That would really suck.<br /><br />Is oral use better than smoking etc?&nbsp; I take it by mixing it in water with baking soda, it generally seems to take a few hours to come on and lasts quite a while, which may have actually caused me to dose a little high on occasion.<br /><br />Yesterday, I definitely did feel some sort of tolerance I&#039;m sure..&nbsp; I definitely got a kick but not massive euphoria, but I didn&#039;t sleep well that previous two nights.<br /><br />Weight is stable, appetite fine.&nbsp; Libido seems ok or no different too except for right now.<br /><br />It sounds like if you are not careful you can really blow your chance to enjoy this stuff for years?? wow...<br /><br />I&#039;m not taking any supplements beyond protein and vitamins but generally follow a &#039;paleo&#039; type diet - i.e. animal foods / fats / gluten / sugar / wheat free etc.<br /><br />The one thing I did do that I thought was bad until I read this was I was using cannabis consistently, usually at the same time, for months.&nbsp; Reading this it seems not only&nbsp; that it may not have been a bad thing but it may have actually helped.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t think I ever mixed caffeine or any other stimulants with meth either, I always stayed off coffee, even tea on days I used it.&nbsp; If only because I was concerned about insomnia.&nbsp; I had coffee on my day off today but that&#039;s it.<br /><br />Also did a lot of weight training initially and still try to especially when on it (that&#039;s why I started using it, to help weight training), so maybe that helped too..<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m just trying to reassure myself that I don&#039;t need a month or even years off this.&nbsp; Anyone think I&#039;ll be ok to take two or three days off, go &#039;hard&#039; (as in half a point or 50mgs a day) for few days and then leave it for a month or so perhaps?<br /><br />I seem perfectly functional off it, not depressed or anything like that.&nbsp; Quite happy in fact.&nbsp; But on it I was a bit full on and over confident some times I think.&nbsp; But I&#039;m also pretty full on normally anyway..

				Yeah thanks for the reassurance... my main concern for now is that I really do enjoy this stuff, so not only do I not want to cause damage, accelerate ageing of my body and brain, I don&#039;t want to lose that &#039;feeling&#039; I get from it and have to wait months or years to get any enjoyment out of it again..&nbsp; I enjoy it so much I&#039;ve basically given up everything else like weed and even alcohol when I&#039;m using it.&nbsp; It really just works for me.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t want to &#039;blow&#039; it and have to wait AGES for my dopamine receptors to re-sensitise.<br /><br />So is oral use safer and less tolerance building than smoking / snorting?&nbsp; Any suggestions on working out dosage?&nbsp; I have no idea where to even get a micro scale, but if I could, perhaps I should just orally dose maybe 20mgs at a time, and leave that for something like 3 hours?&nbsp; Or maybe dose even more, sy 40mgs and leave it at that completely with no more that day.. and leave it for a few days or a week after that?<br /><br />What I may do then is I have about another two points I think, I may just load up on that over a few days and really enjoy it, and then lay off it for a few weeks or a month and see how I go.<br /><br />For now, will a two or three day break be sufficient do you think?&nbsp; I keep reading how dopamine levels take forever to recover, and if you over do it, the receptors can take months or years to grow back.<br /><br />What have you guys found with repeated use over time?&nbsp; How do you precisely measure dose?&nbsp; Just split out lines?<br /><br />I&#039;ll load up on B vitamin pills and eggs the next two days too.

				Well... normally I&#039;d kind of say &quot;dude, the information is like, right there.&nbsp; Read it.&quot;&nbsp; But you sound sincere in your indecision and confusion, so here&#039;s a little advice: do 5 days on, 2 days off (like don&#039;t dose on the weekends or something).&nbsp; That&#039;s not ideal, but it&#039;s what they might recommend if you were getting it from a psychiatrist.<br /><br />Tolerance will build no matter how you take it.&nbsp; Dosing orally can last a long time.&nbsp; If you take a seriously massive fucking dose, like a gram, you will be tweaked for 24 hours.&nbsp; A gram is 1000mg, FYI.&nbsp; A dose of 30-50mg might have you coming down 6-10 hours later... something like that.&nbsp; Frankly I haven&#039;t taken that little for so long I don&#039;t even remember, but I think that&#039;s about right... so dosing twice in one day would either overlap and spike your blood levels in the middle of the day there, or you&#039;d have insomnia.&nbsp; So I&#039;d suggest dosing once in the morning orally, and sticking to the same dose.&nbsp; Don&#039;t up it.&nbsp; Find what works for you and stick with it.<br /><br />The dosages the OP recommends are too high for daily use.&nbsp; You will cause some damage doing that, in my opinion.&nbsp; However, I am not a medical professional.&nbsp; Just a guy who fucking loves (meth)amphetamine and loves science, so take my advice in context of the source (a meth enthusiast who reads lots of science stuff for pleasure).<br /><br />The Physician&#039;s Desk Reference recommends 40mg of dextroamphetamine (weaker than meth, in a nutshell) as the daily maximum.&nbsp; They usually ignore that.&nbsp; You can get prescribed 100mg a day or more if you get a liberal doctor who isn&#039;t afraid of backlash from irresponsible prescription practices.&nbsp; But don&#039;t do over 100mg a day.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; Even at 100mg a day, you&#039;re going to develop some level of physical dependence (as in withdrawal will start if you don&#039;t take it for 24-36 hours).&nbsp; You also risk heavy psychological dependence at that dose.<br /><br />So again, I&#039;d say 30-50mg once a day orally.&nbsp; Just my .02 BTC.&nbsp; Buy a milligram scale off ebay or amazon or something.&nbsp; They&#039;re like seriously 20-30 bucks.&nbsp; You won&#039;t know how you lived without it, I promise.

				This is a great thread.&nbsp; Lots of thoughtful insight...<br />I&#039;ve been experimenting with 30-60mg/day and while it&#039;s ok, it&#039;s also not manageable for me without benzos and alcohol.&nbsp; On the plus side, it&#039;s a great way to be able to lose some of the weight that&#039;s been burdening me for years.&nbsp; (Yes, yes, I know it&#039;s probably coming back after the meth goes)<br />Thanks to all who contributed ;)

				Weight will stay off if you at the same time develop a healthy lifestyle and diet... of course it will come back if you still eat shit and sit around all day.&nbsp; Unless I&#039;m mistaken?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t found weight coming back but I made an effort to train and exercise too.<br /><br />Some good responses there too, thanks... seems I don&#039;t have a lot to worry about regarding damage and that oral use is generally safer and healthier (?) - but I&#039;ll never double dose in a single day again.&nbsp; I&#039;ll also cycle off more frequently.&nbsp; My main concern right now (unless I&#039;ve missed something) is to avoid de-sensitising and then having to wate a long time for the best effects to return.<br /><br />I had too much caffeine on my day off but I&#039;ll stop that too, and will see how I go after three days off this.<br /><br />Good advice about b vitamins too..

				Been reading up, seems in low therapeutic type doses it&#039;s relatively safe, but I think I&#039;ll be going really easy on this stuff from now on.<br /><br />Also for those out there wanting children, is there any research on ampetamines and gene changes / damage they could pass on to their children?&nbsp; They give the stuff to children WIDELY, so you&#039;d think in low doses if there was a significant concern about this we&#039;d have heard about it by now.<br /><br />The worse stuff I&#039;ve found so far is around ageing of the face and crystalising in the face or something?<br /><br />I have a little bit left, I think I&#039;ll just enjoy that as suggested, and then lay off it at least until I&#039;m sure I know what I&#039;m doing.&nbsp; May just be a typical case of Google and health is a bad idea, everything itch is cancer in some forum or post, but .. you never know..

				Trying the recommended strategy here now... took some orally and kept it light.&nbsp; I will NOT re-dose again, I&#039;ll just leave it, whether I get anything or not.&nbsp; that&#039;s where I went wrong last time and probably got the crappy insomnia feeling without any of the &#039;good feeling&#039;.. So whatever happens happens.. I won&#039;t re-dose any more, and try to keep it as light as I can.<br /><br />If I can get a micro scale without looking like a druggie that will be better too.<br /><br />Also dosing up on anti-oxidants (Acai berry concentrate pills, and Vitamine C before and after and basic healthy foods) to try and avoid genetic / DNA damage ageing.&nbsp; Also loading up on facial and body moistoruisers to try and avoid ageing there too as stimulants cut off peripheral circulation (fight / flight response - focus on core organs only for survival) so need to compensate for that.<br /><br />Also read that in the extreme cases of teeth literally falling out with meth heads it&#039;s because of 1) poor oral hygeine for one and 2) stimulants shutting down saliva flow.<br /><br />So I got some cheap good ol&#039; chewing gum ...&nbsp; Does that help?&nbsp; If anything it may help the other stuff like lip smacking or whatever that causes dry lips, teeth grinding or whatever..<br /><br />This sensitisation thing really interests me.&nbsp; It seems like if you&#039;re smart, and I&#039;m happy to lay off for even a few months if I have to to let the receptors grow back (?) that you can sensitise yourself and actually need very little to enjoy it, with on / off cycles and so on.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know if there are any cases of people enjoying this most of their lives without harm or noticeable ageing or other damage.<br /><br />The advice in this thread is just mind blowing... I really think summaries of threads like this (not the threads themselves for various reasons) should be sticky linked to the category or even main SR home page.<br /><br />Not only would it help people but also then put LE in a difficult situation where SR is doing more good for harm reduction and public health than anything a government could ever do.&nbsp; People would trust SR more than government / authoritarian advice, however true.<br /><br />Good job people, thanks for the advice.&nbsp; You have really helped.<br /><br />any suggestions on measuring out a dose without a scale, is that even possible?&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to get one somehow without &#039;raising suspicion&#039; and I don&#039;t want to look like a seller (which is so NOT true, I consume ONLY, and only in small amounts).

				b999: I&#039;m just gonna lay it out here.&nbsp; This is a little embarrassing for me, but whatever.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken amphetamine daily for over 15 years.&nbsp; I&#039;ve abused it in heavy doses for over 10 on a near-daily basis.&nbsp; I&#039;ve abused methamphetamine as well (simultaneously) every day nearly without fail for about a year now.<br /><br />I look younger than I am and am in absolutely fucking shockingly good health for someone who lives the lifestyle that I do.&nbsp; I mean 5-10 years younger.&nbsp; Yes, really.&nbsp; However, I have always -- somehow -- had a bizarre near-immunity to substances.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken lethal overdoses and gotten up the next morning.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why, maybe super man gave me his kidneys or something, who knows.&nbsp; Your mileage may vary, is my point.<br /><br />Also, this is not to say I have not suffered damage... I have suffered a very noticeable and problematic amount of damage to what they call &quot;executive brain functions,&quot; as well as a myriad of other things I blame on my amphetamine abuse.<br /><br />I eat a very healthy diet and try (but often fail) to do things like aerobic exercise and strength training.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that&#039;s helped, if nothing else.&nbsp; The only physical damage I seem to have suffered is that my hair sucks now and I have a heart thing that comes and goes but has never been diagnosed.&nbsp; 15 years ago I had gorgeous, soft, vibrant hair.&nbsp; Today it&#039;s... I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Mediocre.&nbsp; It&#039;s my understanding that sleep deprivation can cause this.&nbsp; Well, I&#039;ve had a decade of some seriously fucking severe sleep deprivation -- it could be the drugs themselves, but I don&#039;t believe so.<br /><br />In short: that whole aging thing?&nbsp; Yeah, I don&#039;t know wtf they&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; I mean for real, I have absolutely no clue where the fuck they got that shit.&nbsp; It sure hasn&#039;t happened to me or anybody I know, but that&#039;s all I can say.&nbsp; I think mostly it&#039;s the sleep deprivation combined with severe malnutrition.&nbsp; When you first start doing the drug, you don&#039;t need to sleep.&nbsp; Or eat.&nbsp; Or even drink much, really.&nbsp; Like... you don&#039;t need to almost ever.&nbsp; As in you can easily go an entire week without eating or sleeping and barely drinking much at all, and as long as you keep taking the drug, you won&#039;t want to either.<br /><br />I think that may account for the people who end up aging 20 years or something in 6 months.&nbsp; Maybe if I went 6 months without any sleep or nutrition at all I&#039;d look like I was dying too.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; At clinical doses, however, there is little -- if literally any -- damage done to your body.&nbsp; There&#039;s also no discernible damage done to the brain, basically.&nbsp; I define clinical as sub-50mg daily.&nbsp; If you want references, see any study on ADHD treatment with amphetamines.<br /><br />Oh, almost forgot.&nbsp; I have all my teeth.&nbsp; And no cavities.&nbsp; They&#039;re almost perfect actually.&nbsp; And yeah, chewing gum stimulates saliva production, which would help.

				Did alot of it Daily for over 10 years, smoked snorted, in&nbsp; beverages, lost 2 teeth&nbsp; ( wisdom) to cavities. I had alot of relatives who would do it daily also, 1 lost a front tooth , besides that I always thought the Dental problem was a myth and had to do more with other factors besides meth, poverty and poor diet&nbsp; often go hand and hand with bad oral hygene.&nbsp; I did always make sure to drink water , especially after smoking to rinse residues off my teeh- may had played a factor.<br />Also, my Uncle was 70 years old and he did nearly as much as I did, only for much longer- he was in way better shape than about any other 65-70 year, hell he was in better shape than alot of 40 year olds. He passed away at age 79 a couple years back.<br /><br />Alot of nasty misconceptions about meth, I think cuz most people cant hadle it, so they villan-ize it&nbsp; horribly.

I was never sick my entire life. I have not nor do I take care of my self. I eat shit food - ice cream with hot fudge my favorite breakfast, lunch and often dinner! I don&#039;t use supplements and my skin is and always has been clear. I NEVER got rail/thin skinny! Lol! I&#039;ve never not grown wood from REAL meth - not that AM (Alien Meth) that is so rampant on The Road! I put it in the main vein and keep up regularly with college girl a third my age - sexually! (Note: Not bragging - it is what I&#039;ve always done meth for! Is there any other reason? My age group of females quit liking to have fun, party and FUCK typically at age 25 so that&#039;s why the babes! I&#039;d love to find a female my age that wasn&#039;t through living - but they ALL ARE! Through living that is.&nbsp; :&#039;(&nbsp; )<br /><br />I have never used a scale and often have knocked myself to the floor (and beyond! ;) from meth so good that I should have put it on a scale - lol! Never needed to go to the hospital either . ... .. until discovering meth on The Road back in 2011. Then it&#039;s always &#039;keep the finger on the 9 in case of another batch of AM! Co-inkydink? That it all started with meth from here? IDK - just know when I lost my connection in the SF area and retired to an area that doesn&#039;t really seem to have a drug problem - yeh! I know! -&nbsp; that SR was my only source for meth. I believe it is getting better here because dem &#039;beaners&#039; listen to what the Gabacho wants. <br /><br />I worked all my life and never missed a single day because I&#039;d been up all weekend dancing and fucking. I never once lied, cheated or stole to get more meth. When there was none or I was out of resources to get more - shrug? - I just didn&#039;t do it until there was more and/or money to get more. I did disassemble a couple of cars too fast that I was unfamiliar with and couldn&#039;t ever get back together about 20 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />In short - except for 2 vehicles ;) -&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had anything but good come of meth - up to 2011. And I&#039;ve even had about 1/4 ounce out of nearing 5 ounces if meth from SR that were .... . .. ... not old school, biker dope good, but close! (Note of interest; most of that meth most buyers here didn&#039;t like! So you can&#039;t go by reviews to buy &quot;good&quot; meth as that will differ as much as the &quot;safe&quot; amount of any drug to do!) The only time I&#039;ve ever felt in health danger from meth is after discovering SR and the AM crap that passes more times than not; masquerading as &#039;meth&#039; - on The Road. <br /><br />I&#039;ve since stopped buying it because of this. Not because I want to. I&#039;m not even close to giving up the love of the real physical and mental mysteries in REAL meth and hope our taco vendors south of de border finally get a clue on how to tweak their ingredients to make real meth like all my old buddies used to in past decades cause I miss it! <br /><br />What is the safe amount to do? Varies from individual to individual! Never assume there is a safe amount! One man&#039;s/woman&#039;s shit is another man&#039;s/woman&#039;s ice cream! If you are good with your God and not worried about passin on - slam the biggest amounts you can handle and then sum! Guaranteed to be a splendid time no matter what happens! Trust if you&#039;re alone and don&#039;t get up, no one will miss you at work and if they do - you won&#039;t care!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: NEVER do that in front of people who love you, children and/or nuns unless they are willing to do some with you - the nuns!

				Whoa, man... are you sure you aren&#039;t tweaking?&nbsp; Because... you&#039;re worrying *way* too much, bro... cut back that dose just a touch :P&nbsp; Relax, have a seat, maybe a nice cup of tea or something.&nbsp; Seriously man, you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; Really: you&#039;re okay... :)&nbsp; Addiction isn&#039;t something you catch over night.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t something you never see coming.&nbsp; It&#039;s the name people give to their desire to continue taking a drug, even when that drug is making them lose other things in their life.<br /><br />You know how you hear people say &quot;I could stop if I wanted to?&quot;&nbsp; Well that&#039;s the problem: nobody ever really wants to.&nbsp; Addiction (well, most addiction anyway) is just the desire to feel good (through a drug) and having done so enough for it to be a typical occurrence for you.&nbsp; It&#039;s just habitual use even in the face of loss because of that use.&nbsp; My point is this: you&#039;ll know if it happens bro, believe me.<br /><br />You&#039;re fine man.&nbsp; And yeah, brushing will be just fine.&nbsp; Try not to redose in the afternoon, that&#039;s definitely going to cause sleep disturbance.&nbsp; If you want to do something, and you think you understand the consequences and the risks and the benefits (and it doesn&#039;t hurt anybody but you) -- then fuck it, do it.&nbsp; Nobody&#039;s got a right to stop you if it&#039;s only you you&#039;re hurting, IMHO.<br /><br />Everybody&#039;s different, but you&#039;re seriously stressing over this wayyyyy too much.&nbsp; Again, you won&#039;t wake up and lose all your teeth and end up 60 or something overnight.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see it coming if it happens :)

				I think I&#039;ve worked it out so I&#039;m more relaxed now, just simply dosing a llittle too much which simply caused it to hang around my body long after the high wears off and that caused insomnia,&nbsp; that&#039;s all. <br /><br />You don&#039;t get more high off this with more dose past a certain point..&nbsp; you just get &#039;empty meth&#039; hanging around the body for longer and disrupting sleep and just doing nothing of any use.<br /><br />So it makes sense now.. I just need to work the bare minimum I need so I don&#039;t have empty meth hanging around being annoying with no fun. <br /><br />So I probably suffered no worse than drinking too much coffee. Probably even healthier than coffee. <br /><br />Now I know how this works and what I was doing wrong it&#039;s fine. <br /><br />As this post says, dose low and work until I working out the minimum I need. Simple.

				Why damn?&nbsp; I have concluded that less is more with meth after finding this thread.&nbsp; I think 20mgs will be more than enough for me, 30mgs at most, so maybe a third of a point.<br /><br />What is the best way to take meth orally?&nbsp; Just mix in water and have on an empty stomach when not hungry?

				I just re-read the first bit of this post.&nbsp; I may have &#039;accidentally&#039; pre-sensitised myself by starting on dexies, and if I remember, I only took them like once a week and maybe two to four in a day, so no more than 20mgs of dex.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping I did do the pre-sensitising thing, and hope I didn&#039;t &#039;un-do&#039; the sensitisation by my &#039;oral binge&#039; on up to 50 or 60mgs of meth that gave me bad insomnia (but not bouncing off the walls type thing, just being awake).<br /><br />Re-reading though it suggests oral use may actually NOT be a good idea due to bio-availability.&nbsp; I hate to say this, but would smoking / vaping possibly be a better idea?<br /><br />If so, I could try vaping say 1/4 of a point, being 25mgs and see how I go.&nbsp; Maybe this is why I don&#039;t need that much because I accidentally &#039;senitised&#039; myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping anyway.<br /><br />So how would I try &#039;inhaling&#039; 25mgs if that&#039;s not such a &#039;unsafe&#039; idea?&nbsp; Just divide a point in to quarters and what... snort it?

Snorting and smoking will give a temporary rush (pretty short lasting, actually) that you may be inclined to chase after. Just treat meth as the drug it is: an extremely potent and powerful stimulant. It&#039;s not like cocaine or MDMA... this shit really does hijack the dopamine system. So I&#039;d advise taking it for its functional purposes and/or saving it as a once-in-a-while kinda thing. It really is a drugs that can be used in any situation, no lie. When I was using it, I quickly realized that I could take it to do hardcore academic work, be extremely social and pick up any girl and have some of the most amazing nasty kinky fuckathons of my life, carry out lengthy academic discourses with other intellectuals, compete in physical sports, the list just goes on and on. <br /><br />Just wanting to tell you to be careful man. It sounds like you&#039;re heading down a road with this drug that may not be so positive in the long run. If you had trouble sleeping with oral doses, you will DEFINITELY have trouble sleeping with intranasal or smoked doses.

				I&#039;ve read that baking soda potentiates meth.&nbsp; So does magnesium.&nbsp; I take an emergen-c packet, mix in 1/2 tsp of baking soda, then 20-30 mg on the tongue and chase with the drink.&nbsp; Then take magnesium pill, alpha lipoic acid, grape seed extract, more vitamin c, etc if I can remember.&nbsp; This may not be the perfect way to take it but it works for me.<br />I&#039;ve had a problem with staying up all night, doing K at the tail end, drinking, benzos.&nbsp; So I&#039;m trying not to use everyday.&nbsp; But the best I seem to be able to do is one, maybe 2 days off meth.&nbsp; Then back on for one or 2 days.&nbsp; I sleep, I eat, but sometimes not till the sun comes up.

				I don&#039;t know if it only happens with Amphetamine, but Vitamin C, will bring you down from it. I remember trying to potentiate Adderall, back when that was all I could get. The baking soda and water. (just a half teaspoon in a half cup water) Really made a difference. <br /><br />Also making sure not to take it with ANY acidic things. Coffee, Orange Juice. - Emergence-C especially. - It&#039;s a great supplement, just don&#039;t take it when you&#039;re trying to get high on your speed. <br /><br />Again Idk if it applies to Meth, but it seems like it would. Calling all chemists!

				so what do you do with baking soda then exactly, a teaspoon with water some 10 minutes before, then again say half hour after?&nbsp; And that alkalises the liver and slows down excretion?&nbsp; Similarly, when you want to come down, just down a handful of vitamin C tablets?<br /><br />What about supplements like spirulina / green concentrates and eating salads etc, surely that helps too.&nbsp; Beetroot juice is apparently very alkalising too.<br /><br />What do you do with calcium / magnesium pills?&nbsp; Just load up each night and morning on a double recommended dose or something?&nbsp; How does it &#039;potentiate&#039;?<br /><br />What about eating a dense / protein type meal while on this?&nbsp; you&#039;d think that&#039;s a good thing, especially with any appetite supressing going on.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to lose muscle mass, I want to put ON muscle mass.<br /><br />Also - I am interested in any signs of addiction a mainly oral user should look out for.<br /><br />I don&#039;t seem to &#039;crave&#039; it when I don&#039;t have it, but I understand the real craving can take some time to really kick in. I did go a week without and I think I did &#039;crave&#039; it a little so I&#039;m spacing it out more now - averaging say 40mgs / day (orally with water) when I&#039;m using it, and a few days off type thing.&nbsp; Sometimes less, but my dose / tolerance doesn&#039;t seem to be increasing either and I never chase a &#039;high&#039; - I just let it roll and try to get some sleep that night.

				Anyone know about chemical toxicity in meth?&nbsp; I heard that some cheap cooks use toxic crap like lead in the mix?&nbsp; May be worth investing in a testing kit as you lead is far more toxic than meth!<br /><br />Enjoying the latest batch... Did take it nasally though which is naughty I know but I wanted a quick come down rather than a long drawn out come down all night, so I can enjoy a mild evening buzz.<br /><br />I guess this is where someone tells me that I am now treading a dark path?&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone through about 40mgs today, nasally.&nbsp; I may take it up to 50mgs. I don&#039;t get a &#039;high&#039; as such, I hope that&#039;s not tolerance, but I have spread it out over the whole day.<br /><br />Really enjoy my &#039;me time&#039; with this latest batch..&nbsp; If I can keep doing this, enjoying it like a few drinks as opposed to getting rolling drunk then this stuff doesn&#039;t seem too bad.&nbsp; Bit like enjoying a few wines with lunch or dinner as opposed to downing a whole bottle and stumbling around all night.&nbsp; A few wines is hardly an issue.<br /><br />As always though, I&#039;m trying to watch the dose carefully for signs of addiction and tolerance.&nbsp; I am really enjoying this stuff though.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m going through about 4-5 points a month - or about 100 - 125mgs / week on average, and fairly consistently it seems.&nbsp; Another benefit of silkroad is you can force yourself to look at your history and KNOW what you are spending and consuming and keep a close eye on it so you can&#039;t deceive yourself.<br /><br />Any thoughts on this kind of consistent use?&nbsp; As far I as I recall, it&#039;s now been about 100 - 125mgs / week on average with a few days or week break here and there for the last three months or so.&nbsp; All health checks etc all come out perfect, I feel and seem completely fine even by professional medical opinion in my last check up and blood test.&nbsp; So I guess I&#039;m just more concerned about addiction creeping in, financial loss from over-doing it and needing more and toxic nasties like any lead or other toxic chemicals in manufacture building up or taking it&#039;s toll on me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard of &#039;acetone washing&#039; but I have no idea what that&#039;s meant to do or why I should need to if the cook and vendor are doing their jobs and providing quality already &#039;washed&#039; product.<br /><br />Gotta say, dancing around the house on your own to full on music is just the best - and so healthy.&nbsp; The doc actually said I look amazing and my health has improved beyond sight in the last year.&nbsp; So either this is helping, or I&#039;ve managed to negate most of the *visible* and *detectable* negatives.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think it&#039;s helped because I try to lead an active life while using it - exercising, being social or just being productive.&nbsp; I think meth actually helps reinforce behaviours through dopamine release so I figured I may as well reinforce enjoyable *actually active* activities.&nbsp; Seems to work..&nbsp; Even when off meth, I seem to now enjoy those activities more - I guess from the reinforcement.<br /><br />The next dental check should also tell me if there&#039;s any reason for concern there but I doubt there would be, although the reduced salivation from meth and dental deterioration from that is a worry so I&#039;m trying to chew more gum and drink more water when I remember.<br /><br />Other than that, the doc said I was a remarkable picture of health - blood pressure, weight, everything was exactly where it should be he said.
