				If it was at a general store it was RC pills. <br /><br />I have no idea what RCs are in those pills tho. So couldn&#039;t tell ya how they would effect you.

				Most nootropics don&#039;t really have much research done to back up any of their claims, and my personal experience with them is less then spectacular.<br /><br />Their claims are mostly that they increase bloodflow to the brain and between the two hemispheres of the brain and many are packed basically with chemical precursor&#039;s to the enzymes involved in serotogenic, dopiminergic and cholinergic systems in the brain.<br /><br />It definitely doesn&#039;t hurt to take nootropics, but I would not really consider &#039;minfood&#039;, &#039;thinkdeep&#039;, or &#039;chill&#039; nootropics and would be mildly concerned at their name alone as theres a wealth of nootropics out there with legitimate names.&nbsp; You should go to a health food store and buy the chemical, eg. piracetam or whatever nootropic mixture whose ingredients you can actually read.&nbsp; Don&#039;t expect anything huge out of them though, other then a hole in your wallet.<br />

				I&#039;m pretty sure that those products you&#039;re talking about are listed on SR by Tryptamine, right? I&#039;ve seen them quite a few times.

I&#039;ve seen someone on SR selling mindpills. The seller claimed to have formulated the pills themselves if I&#039;m not mistaken.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been experimenting with modafinil, armodafinil and DMAE. They do improve focus, at least the first two do; jury&#039;s out on DMAE, and hence improve my writing by helping with word choice/flow and achieving better sentence structure. I haven&#039;t taken any in several days and I can tell my writing is affected.<br /><br />They also help immensely with concentration, e.g., studying and reading.<br /><br />But if you ain&#039;t got it, these nootropics aren&#039;t going to give it to you but they very well may help in obtaining what it is you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />As far as these formulated mindpills go, I couldn&#039;t tell you from experience, but if I had to guess, I&#039;d say the effects are probably minimal and not worth the high price.

				Yes, there is a vendor named &quot;Tryptamine&quot; he claims (not disputing this, just don&#039;t like saying absolutes when I don&#039;t know factually) to be a neuroscientist and designed the three types of pills you mentioned. I have personally never tried them, but some brief research shows that there is at least some merit to his claims. These are not drugs in the sense that they&#039;ll make you trip or anything, but they do, allegedly, work to either improve concentration, help you sleep, or whatever the third one is.

				There are a ton of legal nootropics. No need to get them on SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried DMAE and Piracetam. Neither did much for me. DMAE gave me headaches and make me feel slow. Piracetam was more marginal - I felt somewhat more productive and had an easier time with memory, but it could have been placebo. I haven&#039;t tried aniracetam but I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s much different.

				Yes, they&#039;re actual supplements, I design and sell them. All of the ingredients are listed on the item pages. They are all either orthomolecular (naturally produced in your body) substances, enhanced forms of vitamins, or herbal extracts. I use only the least toxic, most bioavailable forms of all the chemicals I use, and adverse effects are highly unlikely. I have a review thread in my signature and used to have a many reviews on each listing, although it looks like the feedback system&#039;s fucked for the time being.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently compiling research to write monographs about each of the supplements, I&#039;ll post them when I&#039;m done. I also wrote a few paragraphs about the ThinkDeeps in my product thread.<br /><br />Also, how could this be a joke on noobs? I have 100% feedback from 142 transactions over 9 months, you&#039;d think someone would have said something...
