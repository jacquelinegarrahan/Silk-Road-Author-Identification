				I&#039;ve done Heroin before, but only for like 2 weeks in a row a while back and if I snorted to much, I would get nauseated and throw up, but then feel better.<br /><br />Anyways, a while back I took a half of a Suboxone Jelly and it fucked me up big time, but at the same time I got so fucking sick and threw up for the entire rest of the day.<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious , because I know people who take it in real life and it don&#039;t make then throw up, but they are Pill Poppers (Vicodin, Oxy)

				Btw, which is safer....Pain Pills such as Vicodin or Suboxones?<br /><br />Because it&#039;s Suboxone for withdrawals, but doesn&#039;t it still make you high?

				Everytime I have taken Suboxone I have gotten incredibly sick, thrown up everywhere. I would choose Vicodin over Suboxone any day for recreational use.

				This is an extremely common experience.&nbsp; Suboxone/Subutex can make you very sick if you don&#039;t have a tolerance to it.&nbsp; So can heroin.&nbsp; That&#039;s what&#039;s going on with you.&nbsp; You&#039;re not a regular user, so you&#039;re more sensitive to it.&nbsp; Of course, the catch 22 is, when you get to the point where it doesn&#039;t make you sick at all anymore, you are well on your way to an addiction.<br /><br />I remember when I first started using heroin, I didn&#039;t get sick from it alone, but I couldn&#039;t drink with it.&nbsp; Not even one drink.&nbsp; If I did, I&#039;d spend the entire next day puking my guts out.&nbsp; Sometimes it was so bad, I couldn&#039;t even keep down WATER.&nbsp; Then I got addicted to it, and it didn&#039;t bother me at all anymore, even when I drank with it.<br /><br />Suboxone never made me sick, but I didn&#039;t start taking it until I went into treatment for the heroin addiction.&nbsp; So I was already physically addicted to opiates when I started taking it.<br /><br />If you want to continue using heroin or Suboxone, then go slow, and take small amounts (and DON&#039;T drink with it, unless you&#039;ve already tried and you didn&#039;t get sick from it).&nbsp; But remember that the more you take it, the closer you get to an addiction.&nbsp; Once you become physically addicted to opiates, your life becomes very scary.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was wondering if you could tell me what it feels like to take Suboxone recreationally.&nbsp; Do you really get high off of it?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never understood why people take this stuff recreationally.&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s drug that was specifically designed NOT to get you high.&nbsp; I&#039;m amazed that anyone, even a recreational user, could get a high off of Suboxone.&nbsp; Is the high really any good?&nbsp; Is it anywhere near as good as heroin, or even Vicodin or Percocet?&nbsp; <br /><br />It just seems like it would be a &quot;last resort&quot; high, if you couldn&#039;t find any of the good stuff, like heroin or oxy/hydrocodone.

				When i had to go to rehab one time, I snuck 20 suboxe 8mg strips in there, so i wouldnt be sick from coming off Roxy&#039;s and dilaudids. It never made me sick but i felt weird in the head, Almost dizzy, I hated the feeling. But it was the only thing i had to keep me from being very Ill. Rehab is not for u to go into an detox, if your phisically addicted u need to go to detox first. I saw many ppl come in an think they could just ride it out, an the rehab sent them to detox, Rehab itself is only to get you to realize you have a problem an offer you ways to somewhat try to control it.<br /><br /><br />Also yOUR NOT SUPPOSE TO TAKE OPIATES WHILE YOUR ON SUBUTEX OR SABOXONE, Thst could also be what made you sick/ I take methadone daily an have since 07 an probley will the rest of my life, But surprising i dont go to a methadone clinic, I have before, but i was shot, an now a doc gives me 300 a month along with 1mg xanax an k2 dillys.<br /><br />If you have been taking Opiates an you dont wait it out&nbsp; for you to start feeling like shit from withdrawls, subutex an soboxon will throw u into INSTANT WITH DRAWLS, AND IT IS HORRIBLE!!! <br /><br />THERE IS A VENDOR ON HERE WHO SELLS NUBAIN 20 mg. THIS WILL ALSO THROW U INTO INSTANT WD&#039;S!!!! I msg an told the vendor this but refuses to put it up as a cation. Its all over the net that doing NUBAIN 20 mg. while on other Opioid will make u sick as a dawg!!&nbsp; <br /><br />nOT to mention it comes from some 3rd world country so God /Allah/Buddah/satan whatever probley doesn&#039;t even knw whats in it.. <br /><br />Hope this helped.

This has 150 times the affinity to receptors and is believed to push all other opiates away from them, including the narcan.&nbsp; why then add the narcan? Cost, is my only thought. o<br /><br />So, yes it will make you sick if you take them while being on opiates for any length of time... :)

				Sorry, forgot to answer your other question: Suboxone is definitely safer than Vicodin, or any other opiate, for that matter.&nbsp; It is virtually impossible to OD on Suboxone.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the same is true of any other opiate in existence.
