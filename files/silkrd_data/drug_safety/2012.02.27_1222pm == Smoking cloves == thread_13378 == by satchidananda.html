				Cloves are used to flavor cigarettes. They kind of compliment the tobacco taste.<br /><br />They don&#039;t get you high. Smoking cloves to get high is the kind of thread I would post.<br /><br />And you don&#039;t want to be like me, do you?

				Clove cigarettes smell great and I love them.<br />I used to smoke clove cigarettes.<br />I can honestly say that if you smoked a lot of clove cigarettes (even the tobacco free ones) they can have a very mild calming effect, but I would never tippify this as &quot;getting high&quot;. They are nothing compared to bud.

The people who make them got around it by changing the rolling paper to a tobacco leaf so now they&#039;re technically &#039;cigars&#039;, thus avoiding the ban. You can also still buy them online from other countries.

So you cna make them yourself if you want, or just give up the tobacco.

				I used to smoke cloves in High School and the only good thing I can say about them is they got me to quit smoking for a couple of months. They taste absolutely horrible to me now, but that could be caused from smoking bud daily for the last few years. Marijuana is just such a sweeter taste!&nbsp; ;D

				+1 The rich stay in power.<br /><br />They try getting kids to smoke cigs so they can make money. When smaller businesses try to get a piece of the pie they stop them from doing that by passing a law accusing THEM of trying to get kids to smoke.<br /><br />They really would do anything for money. They&#039;d give a person cancer on cigarettes with weird added chemicals to make it more addictive.<br /><br />It&#039;s time for a revolution! I&#039;d totally go up in arms and march to D.C. Is there a tor website for such a cause?
