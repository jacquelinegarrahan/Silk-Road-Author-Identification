				Going to order this but have never tried so could someone recommend me a good starting dose and tell me what the duration is like. Will I have jaw clenching issues? Best just swallowed? <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to get high I would just like to feel awake and alert. I am going to use it for practical reasons (going to work after getting no sleep etc) rather than to try and get high. <br /><br />All advice would be greatly received, thanks guys and gals. Much love.

				The effectiveness varies from person to person, people with a val/val genotype as opposed to a met/met genotype will experience the effects more strongly.&nbsp; 100mg is a good starter, 200mg is fine if you can&#039;t be bothered splitting, you may feel a little uncomfortable at this level though.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think any route other than oral has worthwhile benefits.&nbsp; Have not experienced jaw clenching personally.&nbsp; Even if you wanted you wouldn&#039;t use them to &quot;get high&quot;.&nbsp; But I have heard of people obsessively re-dosing occasionally.&nbsp; The effects are much more subtle than you will likely anticipate, but they are great for allowing your body to simply &quot;forget&quot; it&#039;s tired for 8 hours or so.

				How do they compare to Adderall? only uppers I have tried are things like speed, base and meth. Looking for something a little less intense and a little more pure.

				my experience<br /><br />not a drug u really high from get from.. although u do get kinda talkative and eager but nothing like amps.. you dont get jitters like amps or caffeine.. no anxiety.. you can focus, u remain wide awake.. 200 mg is the dose, dont go over the single doasage.. i think i went about weird when i did. multiples. take it in the morning otherwise u wont sleep.. people say you can sleep easy on them but that wasnot&nbsp; my experience.<br /><br />you get focussed but you can easily be sidetracked (eg coming onto silkroad instead of study)<br /><br />doasge - take the 200mg pill or break it in half. dont go over<br /><br />duration - maybe abotu 4-6 hours of focus but i had no sleep that night even doing it 12 hours before bed.<br /><br />effects - no drug type effects<br /><br />you state you are going to use it for work when youve had no sleep - this is the perfect use for them!!they beat amps and caffiene hands down<br /><br />last year i had demanding weork experince where i would only have 2 hours worth of laying in bed time per day for a week.. and i took .5 xanax each night to zoom off to sleep fast when i got back and then in the morning i took modafinil (aka modalert, modvigil etc).. people naround me under similar circumstances were fucked with no sleep but i kept zooming along.<br /><br />best drug ever to get rid of sleep.. just take them early as you can otherwise you wont be sleeping the following night! have some benzos on hand if required!
