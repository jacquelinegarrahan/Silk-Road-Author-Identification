				If one needed to crush large amounts (100g+) of big MDMA rocks at a time into very VERY fine powder what would be a good, simple, effective tool? Other than a hammer going at it for nearly an hour.

The only downside is that you will get some residue left behind but it&#039;s usually possible to scrape most of it off.

				Mortar and pestle is the way to go. Even though some residue will be left, it will be probably &lt;1% of the mass of your starting product, and you can scrape most of it off.

A combination of the two leaves very little residue.<br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001XRNEM

				This may not be helpful, but have you tried using a pill chrusher?<br /><br />Also, you can get a glass cup and use the butt of a screw driver.

You can then drink it or let it re-crystallize in a small cup.
