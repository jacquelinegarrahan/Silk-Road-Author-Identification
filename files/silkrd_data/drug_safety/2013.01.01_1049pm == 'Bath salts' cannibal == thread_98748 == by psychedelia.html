				Miami Cannibal Rudy Eugene Wasn&#039;t High On Bath Salts When He Ate A Homeless Man&#039;s Face<br /><br />By James King Wed., Jun. 27 2012 at 5:49 PM<br /><br />It turns out the &quot;Miami Cannibal&quot; who ate a homeless man&#039;s face in Florida last month wasn&#039;t under the influence of bath salts at the time of the attack. In fact, the only drug the medical examiner found in his system was marijuana, according to a report released today.<br /><br />This, in our humble opinion, makes the vicious cannibalistic attack even scarier -- drugs didn&#039;t make Rudy Eugene go berserk, he apparently was just a maniac.<br /><br />In the days following the attack, it was widely suggested that Eugene was under the influence of some sort of drug that prompted his psychotic behavior. Bath salts were the obvious candidate, considering they&#039;ve been responsible for a number of other bizarre attacks, many of which included the user trying to eat another human being.<br /><br />According to a press release from the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner&#039;s Office -- first reported by the Miami Herald -- &quot;The department has ruled out the most common drugs found in &#039;bath salts.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />The toxicology testing &quot;has identified the active components of marijuana,&quot; the release says. &quot;The laboratory has tested for but not detected any other street drugs, alcohol or prescription drugs, or any adulterants found in street drugs. This includes cocaine, LSD, amphetamines (Extasy, Meth and others), phencyclidine (PCP or Angel Dust), heroin, oxycodone, Xanax, synthetic marijuana (Spice), and many other similar compounds.&quot;<br /><br />Eugene was shot dead by police after gnawing on the face of Ronald Poppo for about 18 minutes. When he was shot, witnesses say he &quot;just stood, his head up like that, with pieces of flesh in his mouth. And he growled.&quot; Then police started shooting.<br /><br />Poppo is still recovering at Jackson Memorial Hospital, where surgeons have attempted to repair what&#039;s left of his face.<br /><br />
