				Anyone else have this?<br /><br /><br />****(CLEARNET)****<br />http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/a-trip-that-lasts-forever.html<br />http://www.hppdonline.com<br /><br />I totally have it. I see trails on everything. And colors on the edges of things all the time. Occasionally, shit will melt, change color, whatever. Reading can be a bitch sometimes :P Of course, I&#039;ve taken over 300 LSD trips so it goes with the territory, I suppose. In fact I was kind of going for it. I wanted to have permanent acid vision, lol. (I was young...&nbsp; ;))<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t really bother me, in fact it can be kind of fun when I&#039;m bored. Plus I&#039;ve had it for so long, I&#039;ve gotten really used to it. <br /><br />Just curious, do any other psychedelic rangers have this? Does it bother you? How do you deal with it?<br /><br />Peace

				Well what you&#039;re having isn&#039;t actual HPDD apparently, lingering visual effects are fairly common after LSD according to erowid and it&#039;s only HPDD if it bothers you. Well if stuff will melt and change color then maybe it&#039;d still be considered HPDD :P The usual lingering effects are only trails.<br />Your vision must be pretty cool!

				A lot of HPPD is self-diagnosed, which is about as solid as self-diagnosed autism. Most people just read about it online and then attribute common and normal visual idiosyncrasies to the drugs they&#039;ve taken. Yours actually sounds pretty legitimate from your description, however. HPPD should be pretty noticeable and probably not something you have to convince yourself of.

Its got its perks for sure. Its really useful when I&#039;m bored at work. Makes daydreaming a little more.... colorful ;D. But there&#039;s definitely drawbacks too. It can cause a lot of problems when I&#039;m trying to read. Sometimes the words will just look like alphabet soup. And other times it&#039;ll look like somebody went over the text with yellow or orange highlighter, except the highlighted parts keep changing. Distracting! And driving at night can be an adventure sometimes :o<br /><br />Peace

				I thought I had this once but It only lasted a month or so, and only comes back for very short periods of time not very often, and I can just &quot;snap out of it&quot; quickly. Lol I think what did it was a 60, 70 milligram + trip on 2c-P, I tripped hard as fuck for like 3 days straight, Lol dont know what I was thinking but I didnt get any negative effects somhow!
