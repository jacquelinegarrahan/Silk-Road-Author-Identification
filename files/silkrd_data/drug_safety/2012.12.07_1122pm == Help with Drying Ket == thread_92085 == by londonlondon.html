				Put it on a plate or bowl that gives you a lot of surface area.&nbsp; If you want to speed things up, place a small fan next to it to blow (horizontally) over it.&nbsp; Watch it dry.&nbsp; This is like watching paint dry.&nbsp; Scrape it up (with a clean spoon or razor blade).&nbsp; Sniff!<br /><br />This will give you the best yield, as opposed to microwaving it, hair-drying it, sticking it on top of boiling water, etc.<br /><br />It really doesn&#039;t take that long, maybe a day (or two at the most), depending on how many vials you have and how deep the liquid level is.&nbsp; You want it to be as thin as possible, so using (multiple, if necessary) wide bowls/plates is where it&#039;s at.<br /><br />Cheers!

				you could put the oven on 1 or slow (lowest setting) and leave the door cracked open with a wedge so its a few inches open.<br />find the biggest baking tray and pour in about 1 cm at a time, keep checking EVERY 5 minutes to make sure youre not starting to crystalise or the water will dissapear and it&#039;ll all evaporate

				Back in the day we used to take a clothes iron, put it on the lowest setting with the heating side up (stack books around it so it stays put), then put a small sheet of glass on top of it (like from a picture frame) onto which we poured the ket.&nbsp; Iron warmed the glass which dried the ket. Worked decently well.
