				I was wondering if there are any serious interactions with Seroquel and recreational drugs, when taken daily at lose doses?<br /><br />From what I can tell I cant see anything really bad with it, like say SSRI or MAOI anti-deressants, where people cannot use drugs like MDMA. However some people take it to end or coming off lsd, with mixed reports of effectiveness.<br /><br />I am most interested in knowing&nbsp; how it would interact with cannabis, mxe, K and If it does have a impact, can it be avoided by skipping a dose because it has a half life of 6 hours.

				This may be advice you do not want to hear, but I&#039;m going to say it anyway, for the sake of your health.<br /><br />If you are on Seroquel, you should not be doing any drugs, especially since you&#039;re taking antipsychotics.<br /><br />Cannabis (THC specifically), inhibits the formation of hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4, which breaks down metabolites produced by THC.<br /><br />Seroquel and Ketamine both increase sedation, so the combination of those two could lead to respiratory depression.<br /><br />As far as MDMA goes, you MIGHT be ok, but the seroquel is going to reduce your roll, if not totally prevent it, which is going to leave you with a super shitty hangover with nothing to show for it. Also, MDMA is metabolized by the same enzyme as cannabis (CYP3A4), which is inhibited by the Seroquel. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know your situation or what you are willing to risk for a simple high, but I strongly suggest not stopping the Seroquel, regardless of why you are taking it.<br /><br />Please PM me or talk to your doctor before doing anything that may put yourself or others at harm.<br /><br />sdesu

				Thanks, I have set you a PM.<br /><br />I was taking a SSRI and wanted to stop because of all the interactions it has with recreational drugs. Seroquel was just a preventative measure to stop rebound depression and other side effects from stopping SSRI, also a sleep aid.<br /><br />I was manly concerned with things like &quot;serotonin syndrome&quot; that are life threatening.<br /><br />With Ketamine, as long as I am not dosing them at the same time they should be safe? Missing one days dose of Seroquel isnt a big deal and I can just pick up from the next days dose.<br /><br />The Cannabis, I honestly dont understand what you said means in laymans terms. I am trying to lay off the weed anyway because I am a smoke all the time or not at all person.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Bit bummed that Seroquel seems to mess with other drugs but I still think it is improvement over SSRI type drugs and their interactions.<br /><br />I am only on a starting dose of 25mg so hopefully I can just skip doses and get stoned, then resume normal dosage after. I cant find any &quot;severe&quot; interactions with other drugs. Apparently can be used to help lessen bad trips, so the only downside might be lessening of effect if you still have some in your system. I was only worried about the really bad reaction, like mdma and ssri, etc.<br /><br />Still if people who know about what part of the brain drugs work, the process in which they effect you, etc etc I would still like hear it. (in basic layman terms)<br /><br />
