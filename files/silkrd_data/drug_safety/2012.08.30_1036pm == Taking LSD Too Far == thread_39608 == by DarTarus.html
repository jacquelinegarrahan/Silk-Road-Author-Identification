				I love acid and believe I have found my two vendors of choice on here (Jergen and Aakoven)<br /><br />The LSD I normally get from them is quite good but I&#039;ve learned that it takes about 3 hits to get a good high and 5 hits to get a strong &#039;trip&#039;<br /><br />That&#039;s coming from what seems to be their regular stock - advertised as being anywhere from 120-200 mg a hit<br /><br />As I ramped up to taking 5 hits 2 weekends ago I thought for a little while that I MIGHT have overdone it.....it&#039;s hard to &quot;measure&quot; your LSD dose after all<br /><br /><br />Has anyone taken enough LSD that they actually wound up having physical symptoms that scared them?<br /><br />How about a trip that you thought &quot;might not end&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been quite there with LSD but believe I have found a good limit on the blotters I&#039;m getting from these two vendors and that&#039;s the most important thing......3 hits brings a good high --- 5 brings the &#039;trip&#039;<br /><br />Having said that I am taking LSD once / week now so there might be some tolerance going on as well<br /><br /><br />Anyone have any experiences where they&#039;ve taken too much acid?<br />

				there were a couple people in I believe the 60&#039;s that did lines of it, thinking it was cocaine....so if they only did a .1g line of it that&#039;s like taking 100,000 tabs of acid with 100mcg on them each....they did end up going to the hospital, but I dont think there were any really lasting effects....I could be wrong though, it was a long time ago that I read that article

				No FE pretty much says what I&#039;ve read... it&#039;s an insane headrush and can send people over the edge for a while, but usually not irreversibly.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never felt like I&#039;m way over my head, but to include my recent experiment, here&#039;s what happened: <br /><br />I decided to see whether a 10-strip from Jannis would start prodding at those limits. I never came up that quickly before, took me about 10-15 mins to start seeing the visual effects that I usually notice closer to the one-hour mark. I started sweating quite heavily and got a tad nauseous and caught myself thinking &quot;uh oh, have I overdone it?&quot;<br /><br />Had the most glorious and life-affirming trip in a looooooong while. But yeah, I can&#039;t imagine what several thousand mics would do to me :|

				There arent any physical issues you need to worry about just make sure your ok mentally.<br />60s were full of thumbprints, people taking incredibly high doses through their skin. Physically it didnt damage them but im sure there&#039;s probably a few in the nut house.

				Retaining mental health should be the chief concern. Large doses of LSD will not kill you directly at all.<br /><br />If you are tripping beyond what you are comfortable with you have taken too large a dose. It&#039;s very unlikely that that would cause you any physiological harm, but mental well-being is another matter entirely. <br /><br />

				Suicide is a real possibility on LSD if you have have a predisposition to a mental illness and also completely disregard set and setting. In my one very bad trip, I was contemplating suicide as a serious means of escape. So when I hear stories (which are often dismissed as urban legends) of people killing themselves on acid, I&#039;m inclined to believe such stories.

				i dont doubt lsd&#039;s potential to increase suicidal thoughts in some.&nbsp; I have not experienced them, but i&#039;ve been on several lsd experiences and understand that if its in you its in you.<br /><br />the only thing that worries me (and this hasnt happened yet) would be if i began to trivialize it like i did with my marijuana use.<br /><br />just have it become just a thing. ya know. like blowing it down everyday. just a thing. whatever.<br /><br />i dont think it will, because i do think that there is a finite amount of information to learn on/from the perspective of lsd, and when I go on that trip, i will stop doing most all drugs for a long while.

				Indirect death is certainly an option - it could be medical like hear failure, but also the result of getting a crazy idea that it would be fun to jump in front of a bus to enjoy the view during its ride. I&#039;d consider that a mental health issue though. <br /><br />If you are healthy to begin with, no reasonable dose of lsd will kill you as long as you cannot get yourself into a dangerous situation - if you just decide to trip out in a (hotel) bed you will be okay, if you decide to play first person frogger on a highway you will most likely not be. <br /><br />This could be said about many drugs, but taking a 5 time overdose of alcohol could easily kill you by itself, while a similar overdose of lsd or cannabis would not, unless you actually go out and do something stupid enough to be fatal.

				I tripped on about 350ug once and found it extremely intense and mentally uncomfortable, definitely had a couple of trips that have changed the way I view the world, and sometimes have felt rather weird for up to a week but overall nothing long lasting or physical.

				i tried aakovens alice in wonder land tabs a few months back now and done 2 both at the same time and they where advertized at 125ug but they tasted funny like soap and a bit fizzy, they didnt really do much, the most was the letters on the pc screen wobbled side to side once or twice but it didnt last long and a slight feeling of peoples personality&#039;s coming over to me as i read there posts, almost like they where talking to me, but two hours and it had worn off but i was awake all night and finally had enough in the early hours and took a 30mg dose of valium, im not saying they aint got acid in them just no 125ug or maybe i got a corner of the sheet that had a lower dose, my next try was from jannis and this was really honestly dosed i brought 5 100ug and done 3 to start with and the effects felt like 10x the first try and ended up doing all 5 before the effects fully kicked in, this was an interesting night and i started texting people big mistake everyone thought id lost it lol, but on this occasion i had no valium to hand and no weed either, the best tip i have is when ever you are playing with psychedelics make sure you have valium at hand for an emergency cos there is nothing worse than being stuck in time and having no escape. felt like this trip went on for an eternity, messed up night and i could still fell the effects a day later. 500ug is my preferred dose&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

But one person who took 40 mg. (40,000 [ug]) survived. In the only case of death reportedly caused by overdose ([Griggs and Ward, 1977]), the quantity of LSD in the blood indicated that 320 mg. (320,000 [ug]) had been injected intravenously.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s one of two incidents.&nbsp; The second was documented so poorly there&#039;s a huge amount of question about it.&nbsp; The one above there was a month between the time he died and the time the autopsy was performed (because the body was discovered in an abandoned warehouse.)&nbsp; So there&#039;s still some question.<br /><br />So unless you know of undocumented cases from first hand experience I&#039;m going to take what you said with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The skin bleeding thing might be true though it wouldn&#039;t be permanent.&nbsp; The group that snorted a bunch of LSD thinking it was coke did experience some blood problems. <br /><br />&quot;Bleeding was mild and disappeared within 4 to 6 hr. Blood transfusions were unnecessary and all patients recovered completely within 12 hr. All were discharged or left the hospital within 48 hr of admission.&quot;<br /><br />Also...&nbsp; &quot;All eight were reported to have snorted at least two &quot;lines&quot; (rows of powder measuring approximately 3 x 4 x 30 mm) of the second substance.&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s a lot of crystal.

				If you&#039;re worried about it going too far, stock up on Xanax or Valium and have it ready as an emergency &quot;rip-cord&quot;. Will at the very least chill you out of anything bad, and in a best case knock you out to sleep.

I was chilled but the trip did not stop. I was stuck in my loops.....<br /><br />Only thing that really hepls are neuroleptica and the strong ones ... halperidol or such.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just sain... =)<br /><br />But benzos can bring you in the right direction, just takeing them and believing will help most of the time.
