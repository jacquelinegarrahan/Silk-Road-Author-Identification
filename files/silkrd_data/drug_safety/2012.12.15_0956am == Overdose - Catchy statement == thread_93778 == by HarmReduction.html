				Sadly there has been a number of threads highlighting people loosing friends and family due to Overdose, I thought it would be an idea for the Silk Road community to come up with a catchy statement.<br /><br />Any ideas

For some people it is the worst; triggering depression or schizophrenia. Also people can be addicted to it. <br />LSD and mdma for example have been known to positively influence trauma and depression. <br />I just want to say it is not that black and white.<br /><br />Every body is different, every person is different, every moment. Drugs can have different outcomes. So please, educate yourself, don&#039;t overdo it. Respect yourself and your body. And keep an eye on each other.

				people who sell opiates should warn people about potency and dangers about combining them with other downers.... opiates alone supress your breathing very effectively.. what if someone takes alprazolam + a few beers on top?

I make connections between different worldly views and I feel creative in the weeks after ingestion.
