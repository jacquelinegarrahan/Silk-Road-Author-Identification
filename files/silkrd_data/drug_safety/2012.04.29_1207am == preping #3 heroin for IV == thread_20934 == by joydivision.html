				You need to add a small amount of citric acid to the water in your spoon/cooker in order for the #3 to dissolve properly.<br /><br />You can use a small amount of lemon juice (I&#039;m talking a couple drops) if you cannot get your hands on citric acid.&nbsp; I believe I saw someone selling citric acid on SR at some point, have a look.<br /><br />Otherwise everything else is the same as using #4.<br /><br />If you are going to use lemon juice, I suggest you buy some real lemon, strain it, then nuke it for 30 seconds, then put it in a sterile container in the fridge until you need it.&nbsp; In a pinch, I&#039;ve used lemon juice before without any problem or side effects.&nbsp; The ratio of water to juice drops is like 20-1 so it&#039;s pretty diluted.&nbsp; Just enough to break down the #3.

				You can also use Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) - add a tiny pinch to your solution in the spoon and heat, if it does not dissolve, add a tiny bit more... Be careful as using too much can give you a hot burning sensation up your arm!

				I was a Uk #3 addict for 10 years and I still dip in and use now and again, along with coke and Rcs etc&nbsp; never for long enough to screw my life up again though. My ideas, learned through much experience and suffering are here:<br /><br />Dissolve good #3 H in boiled/cooled or&nbsp; medical bacteriostatic water using a tiny pinch of Ascorbic acid, i.e. Vit.C powder commonly available from heath food shops - one shoplift of a 250g pack and you&#039;ll be sorted for years. (lol -don&#039;t steal it really - oh, alright; go on then.. :))<br /><br />Never use citric as it is too damaging to the veins - God only knows why UK needle exchanges put this in instead of Vit.C<br />NEVER use lemon or other fruit juice for the same reason plus risk of infections and worse<br />NEVER NEVER use vinegar or acetic acid as high risks of bacteria, cotton fever and allergic death.<br /><br />Of course, if you&#039;re desperately in withdrawal and these acids are all that&#039;s available then you&#039;ll risk the above.&nbsp; Pretty stupid. Be prepared, have what you need available.<br /><br />Use the minimum heat and acid when cooking up in a well-washed, isopropyl sterile alcohol wiped and dried&nbsp; spoon/shot cooker - You can always add a little more heat or acid if mix is not dissolving. Use the flat end of the fresh 1ml&nbsp; works/syringe plunger to crush and stir the H and acid a little like a small mortar and pestle until most/all is dissolved. Draw up through cotton or cig filter. Unless you are sure that your veins are so fucked that you&#039;ll need a lot of tries, thus filling the barrel with blood as you try to register succesfully in a vein- top the barrel up to 90units/0.9ml with good water to further dilute and reduce vein harm. It doesn&#039;t weaken the rush or high. It will preserve your veins for a lot longer. Any questions, just ask - if I have experience then I&#039;ll help all I can:)&nbsp; Mckay.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Too much citric does damage your veins over time but you have to use alot to do so ... If you use too much then your feel your veins stinging , however most NSP&#039;s use citric as too much Vit C has been known to damage your kidneys&nbsp; anyway enough of that Exchange Supplies sell the Citric http://www.exchangesupplies.org/shopdisp_C115.php

				Yeah dude just buy lemon juice from wal mart, it comes in a little lemon-shaped bottle. Depending on how much heroin you put in, you only need a few drops of the lemon juice, for 0.1g I use like 4 drops. You can always add more if it doesn&#039;t fully dissolve, but I also recommend heating it up a little, just hold it over a lighter for like 3 seconds, it helps.

				No, if all things are equal, they are going to be the same strength.<br /><br />As with any new batch of H, never do an amount equal to your last dose until you know the strength.<br /><br />Mix up a batch at your normal strength, but with two to three times as much water and do 1/3 to 1/2 of it, push the plunger down half way and wait to see how strong the initial rush is as well.<br /><br />Or, do a batch with only half your regular dose, and once again push the plunger down only 1/2 way until you can judge the strength.<br /><br />If you are smoking or snorting, same thing applies, do half your normal dose until you know the strength.<br /><br />Too many OD&#039;s are from people getting new batches, hitting their normal dose, then passing out.&nbsp; Or they are into the WD&#039;s, with their tolerance down and they go and hit up what they were taking a week or so ago when they where shooting every day.

				Never ever use lemon juice .....There is research showing that lemon juice can carry fungal infections, which can infect the heart (endocarditis) and eyes (candidal endopthalmitis). The candidal fungi lives on the skins of the lemons when they are growing on the tree, when the lemons are processed the fungus is transferred to the juice.<br /><br />Among needle exchange workers attending our safer injecting courses during in the UK 2000/1, there was a rapid increase in awful stories of eyesight loss due to candidal endopthalmitis amongst their clients.<br /><br />Candidal fungal contamination of vinigar is also possible.<br /><br />I have worked with Clients who have experienced the fungal infection and its caused alot of problems

				I stopped at a GNC today to get some vitC crystals. Upon looking more closely, it also contains rose hips.<br /><br />Anyone know if that will be safe to use to dissolve #3?

				Citric&#039;s a lot easier to get hold of at any shop that does home canning or home brewing and as mentioned before, will last you for ages.<br /><br />Dunno if this helps:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_hlxbW1v20<br /><br />Anyone else think that&#039;s a very generous looking 130mg?

				Citric is what you want, just a small amount though otherwise it burns like fuck when going up your veins. If not pure vitamin C powder works a treat and doesn&#039;t burn (but you need to add more than you would if using citric) <br /><br />Having said that, I was an IV H user for 15 years - don&#039;t use it anymore (hoooray)<br /><br />Like the others have said lemon juice works fine. Also last result, you can use vinegar - but when using vinegar don&#039;t add any (or just a few drops) of water. And you&#039;ll get a slight vinegar taste for a minute once injected.<br /><br />So best option Citric..... or pure vitamin C powder<br />2nd - lemon juice<br />3rd - Vinegar.<br /><br /><br />They all work&nbsp; 8)
