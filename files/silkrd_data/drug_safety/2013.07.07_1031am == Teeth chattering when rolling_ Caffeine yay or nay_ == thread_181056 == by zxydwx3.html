				Does anyone else have their teeth chatter instead of grind their teeth when on MDMA? I don&#039;t grit and grind my teeth or chew or nibble on my cheek or lip, but my teeth chatter like a motherfucker when I&#039;m rolling. Everyone I&#039;ve rolled with, which hasn&#039;t been that many (I&#039;ve never done it at a rave or party, I&#039;ve only rolled out in public once, and that was outdoors when people were sober or drinking). I just get high at home or at a friend&#039;s, and I&#039;ve always worked hard to get clean instead of speedy pills. Lately I&#039;ve bought crystals aka moonrocks. FWIW I&#039;m a reasonably healthy 30something male.<br /><br />Also like to know what people think of mixing caffeine with their mdma. i&#039;ve had several capsules that have some caffeine in them, and I also take pharmaceutical caffeine pills when I&#039;m just tired and need to stay awake (especially when driving, I spend plenty of time on the highway going to visit people).&nbsp; I do take good doses of mdma, i usually take 1 or 2 capsules of 150-200 mg each, or an unknown number of tablets if they are pressed pills. I&#039;ve yet to roll and take caffeine pills to try the combo that way, but I&#039;ve ordered capsules with it in the mix. Is it a coincidence that I get *F*I*R*E* rolls off them? Do any of you folks find this to be a good mix.

				Have you tried supplementing with some bio-available magnesium beforehand?&nbsp; It seems to be a miracle fix for teeth grinding, I&#039;d be surprised if it didn&#039;t help your chattering too.

				I also get tooth chattering, but only of quite high doeses (200mg+).<br />I would usually say &#039;don&#039;t mix too many stimulants&#039; but I do tend to end up having a redbull or something similar while rolling because it&#039;s nice to be drinking something when you&#039;re in a club etc environment and I dislike alcohol when I&#039;m rolling.

				Definitely no on the caffeine. Will just add stress and muscle tension and probably some emotional edge to your roll. And quite likely add to your tooth rattle!<br /><br />Agree with fiveotwo&#039;s comment re magnesium. Topical magnesium chloride hexahydrate and magnesium fulvate are good. And all greens (the darker the better) are very high in magnesium, so good to get those up in your diet.<br /><br />Also using GHB at low dose (0.5g every hour) as a muscle relaxant during your roll will also help. <br /><br />BG
