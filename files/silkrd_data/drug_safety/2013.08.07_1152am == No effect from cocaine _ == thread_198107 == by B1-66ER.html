				Do you take any other medications regularly? SSRI&#039;s can mess up your reactions to certain good old street drugs. <br /><br />Though, to get absolutely no effect, would be surprising, it&#039;s not unheard of. Sometimes it can take a while to get those out of your system.<br /><br />A well known vendor, could always happen across some weaker shit and not notice.<br /><br />Take a look at yourself and what physiologically could be going on. Once you rule that out, than of course contact the vendor. Usually they&#039;ll want to know, if it&#039;s a good vendor, and they&#039;ll want to make it up to you. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t expect it, also be as gentle as you can about it. Vendors get &quot;you sold me bunk&quot; threats all the time, so realize that too. <br />

				i take it this is your first time? <br /><br />who was the vendor? what was the setting where you did it? were you with people or on your own?<br /><br />real good cocaine is a very subtle buzz. it&#039;s a social drug - it&#039;s a complete waste if you do it when you are on your own. you don&#039;t even realise you&#039;re on anything until you start talking to someone and then realise you can&#039;t stop.<br /><br />also, try a beer or 2 with it

				I don&#039;t want to name the vendor as I don&#039;t believe he&#039;s done anything wrong.<br /><br />This was my first time and I&#039;m not currently using any medications or the like.<br /><br />I crushed the cocaine into a very fine powder and snorted it into my nostrils. The only effect I got was a numbed feeling in my face and throat and a tiny bit of wakefulness (weaker than coffee). I&#039;ve been sat with my girlfriend all morning and had no urge to chat other than the usual.<br /><br />So disappointed&nbsp; :-[

				so you&#039;re just sitting in with the g/f doing a few lines and what? watching tv? i don&#039;t think i&#039;d get much of a buzz off it if i did that on it.<br /><br />what were you expecting? what other drugs have you done before?

				I agree with RD, you should go out on the piss and you will be more aware of the effects. Alternatively you could buy some Mephedrone and forget Coke until you&#039;re in a more social setting.

				i just think you were in the wrong setting mate, next time have a couple of beers before you do a line and make sure you&#039;re in enjoyable company in a social setting you enjoy (for me it&#039;s the pub rather than a club/party). then do a line and forget all about it. i guarantee within half an hour no one will be able to shut you up and your opinion will be changed forever :)

				I don&#039;t think setting for coke effects is very important. You get it anyway if is good.<br />Don&#039;t get drunk cause you feel coke less, and is waste of alcohol cause you return sober lol.

				the setting isn&#039;t as important as lucy or mandy, but it still plays a part. IMO doing decent coke on your own at home is a waste of time and coke - it&#039;s a party drug.<br /><br />i said have a couple of beers, not get drunk. loosens you up a bit and stops you thinking &#039;nothings happening&#039; so you&#039;re in a better mindset for it to kick in

				I know you didn&#039;t said &quot;get drunk&quot;, mine was just an advice for him, in case of...<br /><br />I agree is not the perfect setting to do coke alone, cause you wanna talk, move, talk, and more! but still great.

				You should DEFINITELY feel strong effects from good coke regardless of the setting, even if it&#039;s not enjoyable. I actually do not enjoy Cocaine all that much, sometimes it even actually makes me a bit sleepy (I have strange body chemistry), but I can definitely feel the effects of the drug. Alcohol should also amplify the effects of cocaine by creating a more toxic metabolite.

				I may be alone in this, but most of the time I&#039;m not even aware of how fucked up I am with good coke until 1.) Half way through the night I realize everyone else seems really drunk/sober and I am doing shit that is considered wild, even for me, 2.) I come down completely while awake, or 3.) wake up the next morning and reflect on the days/evenings events. It&#039;s usually then when I go, damn, cocaine is a hell of a drug. <br /><br />Sometimes if I am doing it by myself, especially to start the night, I feel that &quot;weak&quot; boost you are describing and then when I start to become social it seems to take hold more. I&#039;ve definitely had the experience where I&#039;m sitting on the couch and the next I HAVE to stand up and walk around or do something. We call it &quot;Starskys bored&quot; for code when we need to change environments with blow lol Is anything obstructing your nose that maybe isn&#039;t allowing a clean passage? I&#039;ve had that where one nostril was a little plugged from seasonal shit and I switched nostrils and BOOM, my dick felt like it was made of concrete.
