				I have a close friend who likes his salts. However he gets some not so good after affects from the stuff sometimes he becomes paranoid and depressed. I know the instant answer is not to use the substance in the first place but if he were to what do you recommend for after care from this powerful drug??

				bath salts are wicked bro...&nbsp; it&#039;s extremely difficult to give good harm reduction advice here because nobody has any idea wtf is in them truly.. however, we can make an educated guess that a lot of the actives are cathinone-based or related, so i would suggest following the same regiment..<br /><br />DRINK DRINK DRINK DRINK lots and lots of water!!!&nbsp; not too much, but seriously, drink water!!&nbsp; and eat some food, even if you don&#039;t want to, get a smoothie or a fuckin protein/nutritional shake or something and just slam it down.&nbsp; give your body plenty of time to rest, and this will help calm your mind as well.&nbsp; for extreme hangovers and vicious terrifying paranoia/endless spiraling dread, i would recommend a benzo with a relatively long half-life to smooth things out, but tbh i am afraid to do that because, once again, i don&#039;t know what the fuck your friend is snorting and how that would interact with something like klonopin or any other benzo..&nbsp; <br /><br />if you can get ahold of some vistaril (sp?), which is just a very strong antihistamine, then i would definitely recommend that, as it will probably just sort of lull you to sleep and it&#039;s a very, very safe drug.&nbsp; i think the actual name of the active agent is hydroxyzine, and it&#039;s extremely cheap and easy to get ahold of, doctors don&#039;t think twice about prescribing it.&nbsp; <br /><br />people will tell you just don&#039;t do bath salts dumb ass or whatever but fuck them.&nbsp; it&#039;s your friend&#039;s body and if they wanna pump themselves full of space dust or wtf ever brands they sell these days, more power to em, and hopefully some of the advice i gave will help a little bit.&nbsp; i would lean much more toward the hydroxyzine personally, but in a worst case scenario i bet even just a good 2-300 mg of every day diphenhydramine (benadryl, almost all otc sleep aids) could help settle you down in a pinch..<br /><br />nobody likes paranoia or depression, fam, so good luck..&nbsp; hope your friend finds a way to have their cake and eat it too!
