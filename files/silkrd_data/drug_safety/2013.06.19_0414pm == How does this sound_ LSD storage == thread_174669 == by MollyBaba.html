				So, since i found the road I have been really excited to find real LSD at decent prices, so i&nbsp; stocked. Now, looking at all of it, i can say that i bought too much lol. What do you think about this method of storing it for long term use (I want to make it last a few years).<br /><br /><br />I wrap each quarter sheet in aluminum foil, vacuum seal it in a foodsaver bag, place these vac bags in another plastic bag, then placed in the dark.<br /><br />Is the refrigerator/freezer necessary for long term storage? Please share your experiences you have had with storing LSD and any potency drops.

				I&#039;d say go ahead and stick it in the freezer. Heat, light and moisture degrade LSD, so keeping away from all 3 will preserve it for a long long time.<br /><br />Peace

				Wrapping in aluminum foil + vac sealing + putting somewhere dark sounds about right.<br />This will keep your tabs potent for months up to a year at least.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for storing them multiple years I would definitely put them somewhere cold.<br />You can for example put the plastic bag in some sort of container (e.g. a flat tupperware box) and put them in your freezer or fridge. Just let the container come to room temperature before opening it to avoid condensation. Adding some desiccant or rice also helps for this. <br /><br />

				I wonder if freezing might be overdoing it and increase the risk for condensation, in a fridge in an airtight container seems sufficient for a long enough time.<br />If you want to keep it for years and years then the freezer might be the way to go but why would one want to store blotter for that long...<br />

				If its vac sealed, you don&#039;t have to worry about condensation

				Same principle for liquid. Store in a dark, dry, cold place
