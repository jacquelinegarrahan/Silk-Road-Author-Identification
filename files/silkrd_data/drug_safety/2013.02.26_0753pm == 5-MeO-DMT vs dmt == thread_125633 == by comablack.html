				Go for DMT first. 5-Meo-DMT is even stronger and you should first have a DMT breakthrough behind your ears before attempting 5--Meo-DMT.<br />&nbsp;I had DMT and will go through more of it before I fill my pipe with 5-Meo-DMT.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;d go for some changa before using DMT, <br />not so much because of the experience - but because it&#039;s so much easier to use. <br /><br />It&#039;s also a more &quot;grounded&quot; experience and thus there&#039;s less possibility for a &quot;panic attack&quot; during the experience. <br /><br />But I have no experience with 5-MeO...

				Most of the info you are looking for can be found on erowid.<br /><br />5-meo-DMT requires a much smaller dose(10-15mg) and the trip is often described as more intense.&nbsp; Visuals are much less prominent, it&#039;s more of a inter-body trip.&nbsp; NN-DMT is much more psychadelic, lots of visuals etc.&nbsp; Standard dosage is roughly 50mg.<br /><br />I definitely suggest DMT first, but I also suggest you do a bit more research into it before trying it.&nbsp; DMT isn&#039;t something to be taken lightly.&nbsp; It&#039;s easily the most intense hallucinogen I&#039;ve done(bar 5-meo, however the tree&#039;s that I extract from contain both so I get both sides of the trip) and it can freak people out pretty badly if they aren&#039;t ready for it.

				yeah, 5-meo-dmt can REALLY blow you away in a scary kinda way if you&#039;re not used to the kind of body trip that it brings about. nn-dmt will definitely give you a perfect introduction and is, in a way, smoother and less jarring. I would also highly recommend using changa. I wish I&#039;d known about it back in the day.

				DMT is safer. <br /><br />5-meo-dmt is less visual more of a headfuck. its more potent (not stronger) means you need to take a lot less. chance of overdose is higher. <br /><br />DMT is the visual experience you have been waiting for. <br /><br />Both drugs will knock you on your ass, both will show you life and death - heaven and hell, Both will rewrite you and change your whole being. <br /><br /><br />
