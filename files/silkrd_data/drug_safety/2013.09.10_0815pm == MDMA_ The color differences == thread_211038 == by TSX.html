				I don&#039;t know anything about MDMA synthesis, but I was always wondering why there is these color difference from the brown look to almost transparent (100%) like ocean salt when both are suppose to have a purity of 80%+ from what the vendors are saying.<br />(even the size matches, it looks 100% the same, when I made noodels I had to smile and put my hand in the ocean salt) <br /><br />Is the white stuff generally better? It seems that the brown stuff just has a lot of substances in it that are not MDMA, like waste that get&#039;s produced during the synthesis or washing? I also don&#039;t know anything about washing so I really don&#039;t know what I&#039;m taking about right now.<br /><br />I would assume that the brown, very dirty looking stuff hast a huge load of unwanted side effects?<br />Only had pills and white stuff in the past.

				It just has to do with the method the chemist used to make it, for the most part. I&#039;ve had plenty of clear and dark stuff and to be honest both are just as good and just as clean. In fact, I get more worried about clear stuff because that can be M1 and that is pretty much what every local batch of mdma I see is.

Both Shulgin methods use IsoSafrole.<br /><br /><br /><br />Obviously there&#039;s a lot more to it than I am willing to explain here, but the best possible MDMA yields versus other salts comes from the Shulgin Method II.<br /><br />&quot;Brown Sand&quot; is also known as the Shulgin Method I: (commonly synthesized in and sold out of Canada and Germany)<br /><br />Refluxing Formic acid + N-methylformamide(NMF) and Piperonylmethylketone(PMK Oil) yields N-formyl-MDMA.<br />If then this is refluxed in concentrated hydrochloric acid and it is later made basic with sodium hydroxide, it yields crude MDMA.<br />The crude MDMA is finally extracted into diethyl ether, dissolved, and treated with hydrogen gas to produce a gelatinous brown precipitate of impure MDMA-hydrochloride.<br />The crude salt can then be dissolved in boiling methanol, and then added to chilled acetone to form a crystalline product.<br />Recrystallization yields fawn crystals(80%-82% MDMA) with a melting point of 147—148°C<br /><br />&quot;PMK White&quot; is also known as the Shulgin Method II (Pretty much only comes from NL, and Belgium unless people are reselling):<br /><br />Formamide + PMK refluxed at 190°C. The solution is made basic and extracted with diethyl ether.<br />The ethereal solution is then washed with dilute sulphuric acid, rinsed with water and finally dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate.<br />You would then reduce the diethyl ether to yield a clear yellow solution of N-formyl-MDA.<br />It is then added to diluted Lithium-Aluminium-Hydride(LAH) and further refluxed.<br />The excess LAH is decomposed by the addition of water and the resulting mixture should be filtered and the precipitate washed with diethyl ether.<br />The washings and the filtrate are then combined and extracted with dilute sulphuric acid.<br />The aqueous solution is then made alkaline with dilute sodium hydroxide and extracted with diethyl ether.<br />The solvent will evaporate to leave an amber oil of crude MDMA. (100% pure MDMA Freebase)<br />Base down in hydrochloric acid - Recrystallization yields crystals(84% MDMA) with a melting point of 149—150°C<br /><br />Merck Method:<br /><br />Involves the formation of MDPBP(from safrole) followed by reaction with methylamine. It produces White MDMA, but also produced MDPV analogues commonly known as &quot;bath salts&quot; ... Unless precautions and extra steps are taken, it is often that the crystalline product produced is riddled with contaminants and other active amphetamine salts.&quot;

				Interesting, now I have to check out the brown sand-like stuff just to see if there is a difference in the effects.<br />I always thought it was like a less professional production where the chemists just weren&#039;t that good. About the methylone, is there any way to distinguish between the two without a reagent/indicator?

				This study from &#039;93 looks at byproducts that result from 3 of the common routes to MDMA used in clandestine chemistry.<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/mdma.impurity.study.html<br /><br />As I posted earlier in the thread on purple MDMA, pure MDMA/HCL should colorless and odorless. Anything else indicates the presence of impurities. In most cases, these are usually non-psychoactive, but potentially harmful. They are due to poorly washed/purified product. <br /><br />I really don&#039;t think you can derive any meaningful assessment of &quot;molly&quot; from its color, other than to say that if it&#039;s not clear and odorless, it&#039;s not pure MDMA/HCL. It could still pack a punch though. Unfortunately, you may have something that is colorless and odorless that isn&#039;t MDMA/HCL. So without testing, it&#039;s impossible to know what you have. <br /><br />
