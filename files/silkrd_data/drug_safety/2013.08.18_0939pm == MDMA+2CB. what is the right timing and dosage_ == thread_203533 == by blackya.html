				So guys, thought about trying MDMA+2CB<br /><br /><br /><br />People say one can combine it both ways: MDMA first and 2CB afterwards, and other way around (2CB first and MDMA after it) as well.<br /><br />I suppose both ways have their good advantages. Still eager to know which way is better to combine<br /><br />And is it true that 2CB diminishes the come-down effects of MDMA?<br /><br />would also like to know the right dosage for both substances and the timing between taking them<br /><br />cheers

				I usually take the MDMA, have fun with that then wait for the peak to be over. So about 2 to 4 hours after I last dosed, then I snort around 5-9mg of 2cb. <br />I&#039;ve never taken it orally so I can&#039;t comment on that side of dosing. <br />But careful with quantity though! I would not go over 10mg if you&#039;re snorting (unless you&#039;re experienced of course) because as I learned the hard way, 2cb can be extremely unforgiving. <br />Comes on in about 5/10mins, brings back the MDMA euphoria but with a new edge to it, extremely chatty, slightly rushy/stimulating, sensual, usually comical/nature orientated visuals along with the trippyness, a head space that&#039;s not really &#039;earth like&#039; but extremely enjoyable. <br /><br />As far as comedowns, it certainly stops me from sudden &#039;crashing&#039; although if you have decent MDMA this doesn&#039;t happen anyway. It&#039;s certainly a less harsh comedown when the 2cb starts to wear off yes, but the next couple of days I still feel pretty glum. Next day you do get a nice afterglow though.
