				How does etizolam compare to xanax or other benzos? I&#039;m interested in something to use occasionally for sleep &amp; anxiety, and also to help with stim comedowns. another thing I like about traditional benzos is that they help with nausea -- would etizolam be the same?<br /><br />I&#039;m curious to try some, since it&#039;s cheaper and not a controlled substance.

				I would say xanax, not valium, is the golden standard of benzos. I feel like all other benzos should be judged based on how they stand up to xanax. With that being said Etizolam is **NOT** a benzo. I have tried Etizolam and its decent. I enjoy it for the drowsy effects. Personally I think Etizolam is best for people that need to take medicine for sleep aids on a regular basis and watch to switch to a different drug so they dont become dependent.&nbsp; I do some drugs that help me be more productive but they also kill my desire to sleep which ends up hindering my productivity and negates the positive effects of the drugs. So I take xanax, valium, and etizolam to help me sleep. I rotate what drug I take. I take each one for about 10 days then switch to a different drug. It helps prevent tolerance and dependance. If you have any further questions please feel free to PM me. I suggest buying a small amount of etizolam to try. They are cheap and they are worth trying. I have heard some people dont feel anything from them. But then again I heard some people dont get effects from xanax. So its best just to try it for yourself if you have about $20 extra.

				I think it&#039;s a great benzo, very cheap and 6-8hr half-life so great for anxiety and insomnia.
