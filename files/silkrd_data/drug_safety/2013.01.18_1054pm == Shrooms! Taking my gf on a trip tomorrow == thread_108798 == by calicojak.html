				So I have 3.5g of golden teachers and another 3.5g of gt&#039;s should arrive tomorrow. I have tripped on mushrooms maybe 7 times before, the last time being about 5-6 years ago. My gf on the other hand has never ate mushrooms and has only tripped once on LSD and to be honest from what she describes we might as well say she&#039;s never tripped before lol. Obviously I want her to have the best first experience possible, any suggestions guys? Also how about dosage? I was thinking 3.5 for me and 3.5 for her, would this be fine? Thanks guys!

				3.5Gs may be a little much if she is a small girl and has no experience. Half of an eighth is usually plenty for a comfortable mushroom trip.

				Thanks sickboy..I may save the other eighth for a rainy day or day at the beach. So yeah I think I split the eighth with her since she a first timer and I haven&#039;t tripped in years.

				I have another important question to ask about shrooms. It&#039;s been a while since I have taken them and I can&#039;t remember if the next day you feel funny or shitty.&nbsp; My gf gets off of work today at 4pm and the plan was to take the shrooms at about 5pm. Now she has to work tomorrow morning at 9am. My question is will she feel any bad feelings in the morning, any type of &quot;hangover&quot;?<br />

So you think she should take the pepto tabs maybe 10-20 min before eating the shrooms or??? Also since she has a weak stomach and will more than likely have a hard time eating them straight up, I was thinking to take 1.5g and crushing it up till mostly powder and then mixing with flavored water. Think that&#039;s a good idea?<br /><br />Thanks for helping me out answering these questions! 8)

				I think&nbsp; the tastiest way is to make a smoothie. Toss some shrooms in blender with ice and some kind of fruit or juice. Use a strongly flavored juice like a concentrate to cover the shroom flavor. I like to use frozen orange juice concentrate or five-alive.<br />Pepto works pretty fast. I think you could really just save it till you need it.

				Last question I swear lol.....<br />Empty stomach or light meal? I&#039;m not even sure if she&#039;s eaten anything today, sometimes she waits until she gets off to eat so if she hasn&#039;t eaten anything at all today would it be wise to eat atleast something before taking the shrooms?

				If she has a sensitive stomache, then eat something light a few hours before. Taking mushrooms on a full stomache is usually the cause for nausea. Fresh fruit and candy are good tripping snacks while your high.
