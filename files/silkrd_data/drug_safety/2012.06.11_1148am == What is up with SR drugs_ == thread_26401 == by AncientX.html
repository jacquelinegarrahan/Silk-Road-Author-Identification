				You body is not liking how? Bad reaction?<br /><br />Maybe you&#039;re just a bit nervous about eating drugs that came in an envelope?<br /><br />Your tolerance is shit? You say that as if it&#039;s a bad thing??

				Couple of things in play here, firstly SR vendors are higher up the supply chain, so they have cleaner products and benefit from bulk price buying. They have little need to adulterate the product because they can charge higher prices on SR for a cleaner product. Also they can hold less weight, say a vendor has 1kg coke at 90% they could sell 1000 x 1g deals, if they cut it to 60% by adding a cutting agent like levamisole they have 1.5kg of coke now (that is what LE will say) plus they now have to ship 1500 x 1g deals, so the product sells for less becUse the quality is less and their postage costs and personal risk level increases.<br /><br />Also because of competition, there are plenty of vendors for most products, the differentiator for buyers is price and quality, most buyers who made the effort to get on to SR will pay higher prices for better quality as the main alternative is street quality (shitty or overpriced).

				Well the drug in question really is a 1g bag of coke that i bought, i did about 10 - 12 very tiny kiddy lines from 9pm - 4am,<br /><br />Needless to say, i was fucking highhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lol, i love coke, im an avid guitar player, and its a game changer when it comes to it...But anyway, 4:45 rolls around, an i don&#039;t feel like doing anymore of the coke i have, so i seal it all up for the night, smoke a bowl and just wait for the come down...<br /><br />Well, i got scary sensations on my arms and heart, i was freaking out thinking i was in the beginning stages of a heart attack! &gt;.&lt; Im holding my chest and wigging out a little trying to remain calm, I&#039;ve done so much more coke than this before, its just odd that my body now its like &quot; WHOAAAAAAAAAAAAAA slow down there buddy....this is big boy drugs... &quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m perfectly fine as of this morning as you can see ^-^; it was my own fucking paranoia, apparently during my coked out stuper i forgot i took 35mg of Adderall IR earlier that day, and once those started to fade, i went to hit up the blow ^-^; so the ill side effects im guessing were from mixxing Amphetamines ( Adderall ) with some realllllllly good coke <br /><br />But luckily i don&#039;t have an addiction to coke, since its rarely ever around, So gonna take a 4 - 5 day break till weekend, and then start up again... ( Hopefully my heart and veins will appreciate it and let me just have a nice weekend with Mr. Snowflakes ( My coke )

				I got this when I started to get damn-fine quality bing. Instead of doing lines just do little bumps and I mean just pencil-top bumps and space them out. You wont get the sensations anymore. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s quite common for people that go to regular Bing to premium quality. It&#039;s just because you aren&#039;t used to it. Depending on how good it is sometimes I find I need as little as 10-20mg. :)

				I have a pretty reputable f2f connect for coke so haven&#039;t gotten any off SR but I imagine it&#039;s much purer than normal street grade. I think taking a few days is a good thing, I&#039;ve never been addicted to anything in my life, besides vagina, but I could easily be addicted to coke if I didn&#039;t treat it like a party/rec drug and use sparingly - same with mdma for me. If I was a bartender or something, I&#039;d probably be a coke addict pretty easily.<br /><br />I have friends who have gone through periods of time where they do bumps throughout the day, nearly every day, but for the cost I don&#039;t see the point in rushing into building up a tolerance by abusing it.

				See...now if i had the money, and could find a connection here on SR for some medium quality snow, possibly within the 60 - 70% pure range, i would be all over that shit, cause i&#039;d be able to do tiny bumps throughout the day on weekends, or hell even during the week after putting in some man hours with work.

On the streets cuts like that are more the norm then exception. <br /><br />If you buy a gram of coke here, you should get a gram of coke, not half a gram of coke mixed with half a gram of crap, and if you ever receive something like that leave negative feedback.

				XD im not saying the coke i get outside of SR is complete junk, But in comparison to SR coke? My street coke high lasts longer, but SR coke is more potent, and dies down fast. 2 small bumps will keep me high for about 45minutes to an hour ( This is with street coke ) <br />2 small bumps of SR coke, and im fucking HIGH AS THE MOON, but yet im only high for like 30 minutes<br />
