				Hi all! <br /><br />Since music plays a big part in how good a Lucy trip is for me, I thought it would be a good idea to get some feedback from each other on what music works best. We can test each other&#039;s recommendations and take those trips to bigger highs ;)<br /><br />Here are some of my current favourites. Please note some work better in higher intoxication (usually the simpler pieces like classical music) and others better while you are still climbing (like more vocal - complicated pieces such as Madonna&#039;s)<br /><br />--&gt; Chopin - Various Nocturnes, especially the E Flat Major one. <br />--&gt; Daftpunk - Tron Legacy movie soundtrack &amp; Ouverture, Verdis Quo, Too Long<br />--&gt; The Fountain movie soundtracj<br />--&gt; Royksopp - Forever, You Don&#039;t Have a Clue songs, Silver Cruiser<br />--&gt; Hurts - Illuminated<br />--&gt; Madonna - Frozen, The Power of Goodbye, To Have and not to Hold, Nothing Really Matters<br />--&gt; Eric Serra - The Fifth Element Soundtrack, specifically &quot;Protect Live&quot; and &quot;Five Millenia Later&quot; tracks.<br />--&gt; The Beatles - Lucy in the sky with diamonds.<br />--&gt; Puscifer - Indigo Children<br />--&gt; Shpongle - Nothing is Something Worth Doing<br />--&gt; And my favourite: Michael Jackson - You are not Alone, Earth Song, and Heal the World.<br /><br />Looking fw. to your recommendations :)

				Honestly, you can make a deep connection with almost ANY music while tripping, especially music you&#039;re making yourself. :)<br /><br />Add pink floyd to the list!<br /><br />ESKMO entertains me a lot as well, but more so when MDMA is added.&nbsp; Jimi Hendrix, grateful dead or any other jam band, Primus, Aphex twin, good jazz music(miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, Coltrane, Mingus, etc).&nbsp; God I have so many more I could suggest...

				Frank Zappa, TOOL, Gyorgi Ligeti&#039;s string quartets, any bluegrass music, beats antique, bobby mcferrin, telefon tel aviv...<br /><br />Hell, at electric forest this year, I played the entire Willy Wonka soundtrack from start to finish loud enough for the surround 50 campsites to hear... The next day about 30-40 people came up to me and thanked me. &quot;We were tripping balls and each new track from willy wonka was hilarious, nostalgic, very feel-good and just plain awesome&quot; <br />Lolol

				Guys thanks thanks thanks sooooooooo much there&#039;s so much material here it will need multiple trips to be covered... which only means 1 thing.. a trip is in order very very soon :PPP Please do keep the recommendations coming and please include names of your fav. songs next to your fav. artists! Love you all :) Oh also I was wondering if there are more bands as great as Royksopp - Daftpunk i.e. electronic music? Peace!

I have a hard time finding music I don&#039;t like while tripping. Though it&#039;s best to stay away from music with bad underlying messages, in my opinion (I try to keep my trips as positive as possible, haha)<br /><br />I won&#039;t relist the classic music (Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, The Beatles) that has already been listed above, but here is some indie/electronic stuff I like:<br /><br />Neon Indian -- &quot;Deadbeat Summer&quot; and &quot;Should Have Taken Acid With You&quot; (the original version OR the Future Rock Mix works well)<br />Delorean -- &quot;Real Love&quot; (has a trippy intro)<br />Boards of Canada -- &quot;Dawn Chorus&quot; and other songs off of their album called &quot;Geogaddi&quot;<br />MGMT (an obvious choice) -- &quot;Electric Feel&quot;<br />Gold Panda -- &quot;You&quot;<br />Grimes -- &quot;Genesis&quot; <br /><br />As for something purely instrumental:<br />Takénobu -- &quot;Thursday&quot;

I was typing too fast in my post above. Maybe put this above The Beatles. maybe.<br /><br />I remember wandering around outside with &quot;The End&quot; blasting into my ears while tripping off of 3.5 G&#039;s of mushrooms. Did this alone and young so the results were indescribable. Remember staring at wooden fences and watching them melt with all the growth ring patterns in the wood do very cool visual graphics, and then later staring at flowers and watching them expand and change. I strongly believe these types of hallucinations have something to do with the fibonacci sequence but I could never prove this claim of course.&nbsp; Just random conjecture.<br /><br />

				The Orb are pretty awesome on acid - try listening to entirety of Adventures beyond the ultraworld. Jefferson Airplane is great. Some Flaming Lips can be awesome (some of them can be terrifying if they sound too aggressive). Pink Floyd&#039;s longer works are great (Atom Heart mother, echoes, animals album, shine on etc.). Beatles more psychedelic stuff is great. <br /><br />Also the weird track that I found is amazing (to watch the video) is Safety Dance by Men without hats - the faces they pull are great on acid and the video feels good.&nbsp;

				Modest mouse!!! the best ever, so many different sounds... beautiful and crazy, with whales and mechanical birds, like candy for my ears and mind.. i just connect with all the songs which elicites all sorts of emotions, songs appropriate for any mood, which were largely influenced by drug induced states in the first place. the earlier stuff of course, which many people havent really even heard.... from &quot;this is a long drive for someone with nothing to think about&quot; to &quot;lonesome crowded west&quot; mainly. their lives shows are just absolutely incredible, one of the best ive ever seen!&nbsp; when im tripping so much freaking fun to jam along on my violin with their songs<br /><br />another band I really enjoy while tripping is cloud cult which is absolutely beautiful intelligent pop/indie rock, and another called THESE ARMS ARE SNAKES which is a hardcore/alt rock, essentially one-of-a-kind sound - since they broke up been looking for a band to even measure up with a sound like their earlier stuff given how fantastic it was and the unusual intricate blend of styles even within just one song. heavy distortion with masterful effects, sick bass lines and rhythms, passionate vocals consisting of a singing and screaming mix with a funky hip hop flow, nearly approaching industrial at times - all topped off by a haunting organic organ. like cursive if they grew a pair and stopped whining so much. (members went on to Russian Circles, Minus the Bear, Narrows, etc) check out &quot;oxeneers or the lion sleeps when its antelope go home&quot; the live show i saw was so intense and mind blowing.

				It was mentioned earlier, but they deserve another mention, Tool without a doubt. All songs/albums are great for me but Rosetta Stoned really gets me going at the peak of a trip.<br /><br />More generally I find non electronic music better tripping because I can more easily connect with the people behind the music (if that makes sense) and pick out the individual instruments/sounds and how they all fit together. Electronic music still sounds good, but I don&#039;t get that connection. Might be just me.<br /><br />On the other hand, rolling with some (good) dubstep in the background is amazing.

				Music while tripping sure is the best.&nbsp; I definitely like anything freeflowy and instrumental/electronica.&nbsp; I had Four Tet - &quot;hands&quot; blasting on a massive 25i breakthrough. Will have to try it on acid sometime.&nbsp; All that shimmery percussion!

				The Spawn soundtrack had some cool songs on it. I&#039;ve been listening to Primus&#039;s frizzle fry while tripping here lately. I didn&#039;t think i&#039;d like them much but the 13th Floor Elevators have a pretty cool sound for an early sixties band, but the electric jug can go a lil overboard. Sometimes I enjoy Deadmau5 while i&#039;m tripping, other times I might enjoy Morbid Angel. I will say Ke$ha sucks acid or not lol. Dark Side of The Moon is awesome while tripping. Hell you could probably just turn it to your local classic rock station and have a better time than trying to preplan the playlist.

				Anything by Underworld. Preferrably a whole album.<br /><br />You listen to that while tripping and there are so many layers you can&#039;t imagine how anyone human could create this without tripping themselves. <br /><br />And as someone else mentioned - Aphex Twin. You can feel him bending and stretching the music. Saw him live once while tripping balls - omg lasers!!!&nbsp; :P

If you have a chance listen to the hidden track (you need to put Wings for Marie at the end of Viginiti Tres so it becomes one song, then play this at the same time as 10,000 Days, easier if you just Youtube it to be honest.) I haven&#039;t tried this when I&#039;m tripping as I honestly only thought of it now. Gives me shivers sober though.

				WELL. <br /><br />Music is my true passion, and I create my fair bit of it. I&#039;m a big believer in Com Truise. Yes, that&#039;s spelled correctly. He makes very nostalgic 80&#039;s era typed music. He classifies his genre as Mid-fi synth-wave slow-motion funk. <br /><br />Here is my favorite song by him: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMjCxV7u8OA<br /><br />Here are others:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8LjavsYORA<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xlI3dIHMOI<br /><br />I&#039;ll be posting more here, but I&#039;ll have all you listen to those first ;)

				New music recommendations based on last night’s trip:<br />Tron Reconfigured soundtrack by Daft Punk. Tron soundtrack is my current favourite album so imagine the miracle it was for me to discover yesterday that Daft Punk had it re-released remixed. I was in Nirvana listening to it. Check especially songs “Solar Sailer Prety Lights remix” – “The Son of Flynn Moby Remix” and “Adagio for Tron Teddybears remix”. Notice the collaborations between music giants.<br />Madonna – Masterpiece<br />Which led me into finding music by William Orbit. I ended up listening to “Pieces in a Modern Style vol 2” which is classical music combined with electronic. Out of this world. E.g. song “Paradisum”<br />Pink Floyd music especially what was recommended by fellow member above.&nbsp; E.g. “Marooned” and “Echoes”<br />Orbital – Wonky Album<br />Carbon Based Lifeforms – Interloper album<br />Deadmau5 – “strobe” track<br /><br />Important note: Always make sure to download full albums before you trip. Youtube will not do, many of the songs there are re-sampled to avoid youtube copyrights and they sound shit.

I remember I was sure that sonar sound at the beginning of the track was telling me &quot;Key.... Key.... Key... Key....&quot;.<br />What an amazing track. True masterpiece. I also like the version that Gilmour performed on &quot;Remember that night&quot;. Due to the modern quality of recording it sounds much better than the record made in 1971.

				I&#039;ll tell you what.... psychedelic trance, commonly known as psytrance, especially of forest, night and dark styles, while dancing at the big open air tribal gathering is the most intense experience I&#039;ve ever had. And when you understand psytrance, go for psycore that is mixture of psytrance and hardcore...<br /><br />The tradition of consuming psychedelic drugs is very common among psytrance producers and djs, so believe me... they know what they&#039;re doing. :)<br /><br />Too much of rock vibe here.. ;) Gotta heal this mass here ;)

				Psychedelic music was invented in London in 66-67 when acid was legal. Long before they started to make &#039;trance&#039; on computers. Such tracks as &quot;Interstellar overdrive&quot; by Pink Floyd were made not just because musicians suddenly wanted for music to become long and weird. It was for drug consumption.

				sure, and i&#039;m absolutely aware of it, and i actually think dark side of the moon is the best album ever in any genre... still, psychedelic trance is not less psychedelic because it&#039;s fairly new trip. :)

				How the fuck has nobody mentioned Phish yet??&nbsp; You wanna listen to some of their live stuff.&nbsp; it will send you into another realm.&nbsp; Lots of long drawn out ambient stuff if you listen to just about any show from 2003-2004.&nbsp; I can also recommend the Tower Jam from the It festival in August 2003.&nbsp; Try listening to the Storage Jam from 7/2/11.&nbsp; If you go to any torrent there will be lots of shows.&nbsp; If you PM me I will point you to some really great trippy jams.&nbsp; Just let me know the mood you are searching for, there is literally one for every occasion.&nbsp; I promise listening to live Phish on some psychedelics is one of the best decisions you can ever make.

				Somehow i stumbled onto dark star orchestra&#039;s website last night while tripping, must of been like 5 or 6 in the morning. Heard this song friend of the devil several times while i was browsing, I really liked it, then i heard the studio version of grateful dead, and i gotta say the DSO was more enjoyable to me. Maybe because the tempo was slower and it wasn&#039;t as blue grassy sounding.

				Phish - Any live phish beats everything.<br /><br />The Flaming Lips - The four disc &quot;Zaireeka&quot; album. Each disc simultaneously playing in four different stereos, each stereo in four different corners of the room. It can prove difficult to simultaneously start four different stereos in four different corners on your own so it&#039;s best to get three like minded friends in on it with you. It&#039;s much more memorable than just dosing and popping a cd in.

				Grateful Dead, Dick&#039;s Picks Vol. 13<br /><br />Listen to &quot;Lost Sailor&quot; and they transition into &quot;Saint of Circumstance&quot; and two others.&nbsp; It&#039;s really all one track, about a 50 minute jam.&nbsp; My personal favorite from the Dead.&nbsp; I have a ton of good memories, and nostalgia, from this.&nbsp; Always throw it on when I trip&nbsp; :)

				I came across an I Monster track while I was tripping and I ended up listening to about an hour of their music that hit the spot for that trip. I had never heard of them before probably because i&#039;m not really into electronic music but some psychedelic, horror, trip pop or whatever they are mixed very nicely with my trip.

				Hey all, back to &quot;reality&quot; after an amazing Lucy experience up the mountains.<br /><br />What was interesting this time was the fact that the weather seemed to be in sync with music (experienced by me and another person) and this happened a lot of times to be mere coincidence. Specifically, it was a cloudy / stormy day, but the sky would clear at specific moments in the songs (climax of the songs) with amazing visual effects.<br /><br />Highly recommended you guys try (perhaps with same music) and see :)&nbsp; <br /><br />The 2 artists that did the trick were Schiller and Asura. <br /><br />Specifially from Schiller, listen to his songs: Destiny, Everything, Let me Love you, Time for Dream, Try, Miles and Miles, Zenit, You, I Feel You and Sonne.<br />From Asura: V.A.N.T.A, Le dernier voyage, Getsemani, Longing for Silence, Altered State, Fahrenheit, Code Eternity, Simply Blue, Everlasting, Vangelis, Land &amp; Freedom.<br />

				Besides the obvuous Pink Floyd.<br /><br />Id say:<br /><br />Tool - Lateralus would be my first pick<br />PUSCIFER&#039;S Album Conditions of my Parole (If you havent tried this tripping, or even while chilling on a couch on MDMA, do yourself a fucking favour, trust me....would never have thought itd work but wow its awesome stuff).<br />Porcupine Tree<br />Certain Liquid Drum n Bass from artists like Klute, Calibre, Spectrasoul (That kinda genre)<br /><br />Those are the bands I have the fondest memories of when tripping. Theres a fair few more If I really jog the memory but those are my top few. Would like to emphasise again, the Puscifer album Conditions of my Parole, buts you in the best headspace and vibe, make sure your well into the trip before putting on though, amazing stuff.<br /><br />S

				Beatles - the Blue album ( 67 - 70 ).<br /><br />These guys were brilliant geniuses and this music was made to trip on.<br />Has all the great tracks.<br /><br />Strawberry fields<br />Lucy in the Sky<br />While my guitar gently weeps<br />Here comes the sun<br />Across the universe<br /><br />and many more - all fantastic, virtuoso and so very playful and done while the fab 4 themselves were tripping their asses off.<br /><br />My favorite experience is Dieing and blasting out of my skull to &quot;A day in the life&quot; which ends in an explosion and then coming back to into ones head to the next track which is &quot;All you need is love&quot;.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
