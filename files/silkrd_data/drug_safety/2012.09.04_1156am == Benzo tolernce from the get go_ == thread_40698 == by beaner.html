				I forgot to mention that i have no benzo tolerance since i tried them last a few years ago kicking a heavy benzo addiction. they could be bogus but they came blistered and i got 10x5 mg from the docs and took them in one night without a desired efect. melting into the bead and my thought clean with no worries ( i don&#039;t want to think about work bills, the future, just be chilled) but u have none of that. I just took 40mg over the last 3 hours and nothing much.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I took about 5-6 mg of xanax and its so so . I notice the benzo effects. People at work noticed i was slow, repeated myself and allot more mellow and also a big one is me repeating myself lol, terrible memory.<br /><br />I wanna know BOGUS i doubt it (diazapam came blistered brand cypria?) and the liquid xanax <br /><br />Whats going on lol<br />

				Don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on, but I&#039;d have thought that much valium followed by some xanies would&#039;ve put an elephant to sleep. There is just no way that 50mg could&#039;ve had little to no effect, especially if it&#039;s been years since you last had them.<br /><br />Are you on any other meds which might&#039;ve counteracted it?

				I don&#039;t know, if they came from a pharmacy they&#039;re probably ok. I think you are a) overdoing it and b) expecting too much high from benzos. You feel like they aren&#039;t affecting you, you say you feel pretty relaxed and mellow, but probably to an outside observer you are a slurring shambling mess! (no offence).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I learnt long ago ( after many messy experiences) that less is more with benzos. Like, tolerance can build very quickly. With diazepam if you take 10-20 mg a day it will make you feel mellow, and maybe nicer the first day or so. But if you take more it wont improve the effects it will just make you confused and forgetful. Resist the temptation to start guzzling the little blue fuckers&nbsp; trying for a high that isn&#039;t going to come. After a day or so the warm fuzzy feeling won&#039;t be noticeable much, I usually find I still feel a bit more confident and talkative still.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my younger days I&#039;d be eating 100&#039;s of milligrams of Valium and thinking I wasn&#039;t getting that much off them; but I had my keys on a string so I wouldn&#039;t lose them and I kept getting black eyes from falling over! It&#039;s easy for these things to creep on you.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been taking 10-20 mg a day for past three weeks while I taper my dose of subutex down from 8(which I was on for several years) to -4 mg daily so I can take a bit of H now and again. (been trying once a month to treat myself but it just aint happening on this dose of subs) Ive resisted the desire to eat more because I know from long and bitter experience that it is a rod for your own back. I&#039;m now doing 5 mg a day for a couple days then I&#039;ll do 1/4(2.5mg) for a few days and its all been fairly painless. I&#039;m in my thirtys and I&#039;ve learned slowly and painfully to self control my drug use. Really, less is more. If you do plan to take that much Valium for even a week or two make sure you leave yourself enough for a little taper, it will make your life easier. Diazepam has a long half life and if you stop suddenly after high doses for even a couple weeks you casn get a nasty surprise after a few days of stopping, as your levels drop.

Doesn&#039;t matter how long ago, after a serious benzo addiction your brain chemistry is never gonna return to default settings.... you aren&#039;t going to recapture how good they made you feel when you first tried them. Shit I&#039;ve never been proper addicted to them, heroin being my drug of choice, just used to binge on them now and then.<br />My first time with Valium must of been when I was sixteen or so, my pot dealer got a big bag of 5mg yellow ones.&nbsp; 50p for 2 or 5 for a quid I think it was. And I had a couple and was like &quot;mmnm this is what I&#039;ve been looking for.&quot; it actually turned out that opiates were what I was looking for. But I never managed to get that same high of the early days again.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benzos are a useful tool but you are best not trying to use them for anything other than mild relaxation or dealing with other drug WDs

				Is is possible that resistance/tolerance are still present after several years. This is not very common, but for some people it just seems to work that way. If you had no tolerance at all, a dose like 50 mg valium or 5 mg xanax woud knock you out on the first go.<br /><br />This tolerance is mostly towards the hypnotic effect though, Something like xanax may still be very effective against panic disorder or generalized anxiety even if you have developed total resistance to its hypnotic effects. The lack of sedative effect in in itself is no indication that the medication will not be effective against anxiety related disorders.

				Alcohol will not really solve benzo withdrawal effects, apart from drinking enough to pass out so the effects do not bother you any more for that moment. They&#039;ll probably be back the next day do, with a hangover on top. <br /><br />There is no real cross tolerance between alcohol and benzo&#039;s, though many people will use both at the same to deal with problems like insomnia and anxiety - something obviously advised against, but as it happens so commonly it is worth mentioning.<br /><br />If you are suffering from benzo withdrawal, the best thing to do would probably be to take a moderate dose of a short acting benzo like alprazolam. This will not require a dose that puts you straight out, nor give you a hangover in the morning. Downside is you may have to repeat that process with slowly decreasing doses until you can cope without.

THat saved my fucking life, I would have had to go to the hospital and have medical supervision while going through that otherwise.<br /><br />By the way, the homie above you was talking to thread starter, saying to have a couple brews after taking&nbsp; a dose to potentiate it, not as a WD treatment. That certainly works well, as long as you arn&#039;t operating a motor vehicle like he said. I was drinking heavily during that period of heavy xanax use, and as fucked up as it was to have that WD, I had a whole lot of fun. Not even close to worth it, but they definitely potentiate each other is all im sayin.

				I would not say anything against the synergistic effect of alcohol and benzo&#039;s. It&#039;s clearly present, and its probably best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery when on either, let alone both.<br /><br />The problem isnt really in taking a single xanax and a couple of beers or wines either. It gets dangerous when someone decides to take a ouple of benzo&#039;s combined with, say, half a bottle of vodka. A combination like that could result in potentially fatal respiratoru depression. Something like taking 1 mg xanax and 2 glasses of wine is probably the default dose for anyone on a long flight - its not recommended to do that, but so many people do and suffer little more then amnesia i wouldn&#039;t say its idiotically dangerous to attempt.

However, I think that specific interaction effect is far more dangerous with opiates and alcohol, which is why as you alluded to, taking benzos with alcohol is very common. Obviously a reasonable dosage of each is important, and the times I overdid it it was more over doing it with the booze, not so much taking a huge dose of benzo (maybe 1mg of xanax with like 10-12 beers). THats still too many beers I know that, but you live, you learn. I have had friends that have died from opiates+alcohol, being that opiates by themselves so noticeably slow down your breathing is evidence to support really how risky that combo is. When I was just waking up after my 3 surgeries in the hospital, I had to have a breathing monitor because I was so juiced up with IV diluadid and whatever else, and when my breathing slowed down to dangerous levels a loud beeping sound would go off and the nurse had to yell at me to remember to breathe. That&#039;s with no other substance in the mix...

				I&#039;m sorry to hear that opiates and alcohol ended badly for people you knew - despite its a well known risk, it is not something easy to take if it happens to someone you know. <br /><br />I suppose the problem with the combination of benzo&#039;s and alcohol is that people don&#039;t consider either to be very dangerous (in terms of short term mortality), and if considered on their own, rightfully so. <br /><br />Taking just a bar of xanax, or just drinking a bottle of wine are not that dangerous, but doing both at the same time changes the game entirely. If someone decides to double up on both doses during a night, you have a situation where someone should spend the night in a hospital rather then in their own bed at home.<br /><br />The leaflet supplied with benzo&#039;s does state this risk, but is says the exact same thing with antihistamines where the risk is minimal. This may give people the idea that taking some xanax will alcohol will be fine, since taking some benadryl with alcohol before did not cause more then a long nights sleep. Also, taking the combination will probably not make you feel ill or even that impaired. In moderate doses it will probably not make you drive into lampposts and such, but can still cause death befire the next morning. <br /><br />Personally the combination of benzo&#039;s with alcohol just caused total anterograde amnesia so far, but i know thats about one step before venturing into dangerous territory.

				so i have decided to stop the benzos since i know it can go down hill fast, i didn&#039;t mix them with alcohol because i think it takes something away from the effects of hte benzos. It&#039;s just really hard with losing my father (him at a rather young age) Im getting coucelling but as usual my default setting is to hit the benzo&#039;s and opioids. It&#039;s just really tough and i was just expecting more from the benzos.<br /><br />Last time i was on it i was on a ridiculous amount of xanax and valium. The stupid thing is i know how addictive they are and i have an addictive personality but i still want them to feel numb.<br /><br />I have only been on them for about 5 days now but high doses, i have non left now which is a good thing.<br /><br />Thanks everyone for the comments and advice much appreciated

				First of all, I am sorry for your loss!<br /><br />Benzo&#039;s may not be the drug of choice for dealing with it however. In fact, no drug should be, but if you are looking for something that helps by not caring that much, SSRIs are the better choice - not stating that i think i would be a good idea in general to take them for dealing with a situation like yours.<br /><br />Since you have been taking pretty large amounts of benzo&#039;s over the course of a week or so, i&#039;d still recommend against stopping them immediately. You could probably take a rather steep reduction since its only been such a short time, but quitting them cold turkey might not be the best idea. If you do not taper them off, withdrawal effects like serious panic or anxiety are to be expected.<br /><br />I understand that you are going trough a really bad time, but that is all the more reason to avoid withdrawal effects making things even worse. It may seem unlikely that this would be a problem after a single week of use, but with doses as high as 5 mg alprazolam a day it could be. I dont know who suggested taking that much, but if you ask me it is too much.<br /><br />The normal dose to deal with panic disorder is 3 times 0.5 mg a day, which proves to be effective in most patients. Taking 3 times that dose after a long period of abstinence is not something to consider lightly. I know xanax often comes in 2 mg bars that are supposed to be broken into pieces, the idea behind that is that one bar will last you a day, not that you take 3 bars a day. <br />
