				MDMA is off limits for me now as I&#039;m on SSRI&#039;s. Bummer that, as it was my favorite drug.<br /><br />Anyway, in search of a good replacement for my nights out, I wondered how 2cb and coke sat together? I can&#039;t see there being any problems, but have never tried mixing stimulants with hallucinogens.<br /><br />Thoughts most welcome :)

				mixing traditional phenethylamine stimulants (like d-amphet, methamphetamine, etc) with phenethylamine hallucinogens can have dangerous cardiovascular effects. considering 2c-b is a potent vasoconstrictor and amphetamines elevate heart rate and blood pressure, the combination can be potentially fatal. while cocaine has a very different mechanism of action from phenthylamine stimulants, it has the same effect of elevating heart rate and blood pressure. cocaine also carries with it an increased risk of tachyarrhythmia (irregular heart beats) which, coupled with vasoconstriction, can also be potentially fatal. however, cocaine salts have very mild effects and side effects at that, particularly in typical recreational doses. if you are going to experiment with this combination, i would recommend taking a moderate dose of 2c-b and a very low dose of cocaine. repeated insufflations of cocaine while under the influence of 2c-b could cause heart problems depending on the prior health of the user. to be honest, i would never try this combination because it is inherently dangerous to mix phenethylamines with stimulants, especially 2c&#039;s. you would probably find it hard to notice the difference between a pure 2c-b trip and a 2c-b cocaine combination unless you took enough cocaine to put you at risk for a cardiovascular event. i think you would prefer, and would certainly be safer in, a combination of cocaine with a tryptamine psychedelic like psilocin. even taking an ergoline psychedelic like LSD causes vasoconstriction which can be harmful in combination with stimulants.<br /><br />be safe, start with small doses, and report back here if you end up trying!

I didn&#039;t realise that, thanks for the heads up, and it makes total sense....now.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board then. I used to love my MDMA, so finding a replacement due to my SSRI&#039;s is tricky. I like energy, and I like trippy. Maybe just 2cb on it&#039;s own then. Although to be more precise, I didn&#039;t mean 2cb and coke together as such. My intention was for a few beers, a couple of lines, then the 2cb after the coke had more or less worn off. Maybe that&#039;s not so bad?

				Siman has it spot on, but on a side note. The 2c-b on the road is very, very clean and powerful. Definitely watch your dose and RoA. If you take too much orally you might as well sit the night out, if you insufflated anything beyond 5mg if you aren&#039;t used to pyschedelics you may want to also consider sitting the night out. Personally, I think coke would be something to do a little bump of after because you can feel pretty dumb and lost after a good 2c-b trip. I know 2c-b was used as an ecstasy replacement for a while but MDMA and 2c-b are completely different substances. Good luck and have fun. Report back, I&#039;d love to know how the combination went.

				Not so bad combo, i´ve treid it last week but with just small portion of 2C-B. around 1g of coke, up to 10 mg 2c-b snorted, some alcohol. Very funny, laughing night.

				i would never personally recommend mixing alcohol with cocaine, though i have done it and i recognize it is one of the most popular combinations out there. cocaine salts and ethanol combine in the liver to form cocaethylene, a highly toxic but potent drug mimicking the effects of cocaine itself. this is why mixing cocaine and alcohol is so euphoric. however, cocaethylene is metabolized much, much slower than cocaine or ethanol by itself, so its effects on the liver and heart can be catastrophic. most people who die from cocaine (not combined with opiates) actually die from liver failure resulting from combining alcohol with cocaine. heart attacks are not uncommon in drunk people doing even a few lines of cocaine. this is not even taking into account all the possible adulterants of cocaine, some of which can have an even worse contraindication with alcohol. i know you may have used the combination in the past, like i have, and believe it&#039;s safe, but the damage adds up! most people with liver damage have no idea their liver is damaged until the scarring is irreversible. liver pain is uncommon in the early to middle stages of cyrrhosis. i have no idea whether 2c&#039;s have a contraindication with alcohol. again, use cocaine and alcohol at your own risk! and if you choose this combination, go light on the alcohol. high alcohol + low cocaine is worse for your body than high cocaine + low alcohol.

It was a sweet mix indeed. But you speak of how dose dependent this stuff is. The first time, I took 20mg orally and it seemed perfect. Then the next time, something must have gone wrong with my measurements....I was off my tree completely. Not pretty. The stuff I have now is the same and I haven&#039;t got it from the road....kind of like small oat flakes or ready break. Odd looking stuff. But yeah, it has to be exactly 20mg for me. <br /><br />Thanks for all the advice guys. Not looking good. I may just mix the coke with some shrooms then instead. Then again, I just know what I&#039;m like! It will be in moderation though, and it will definitely/probably be more coke than alcohol.<br /><br />Out of interest, what is a good combination with coke?<br /><br />Anyway, if I live, I will report back.

				coke is not one of my favorite drugs, but i once took an 8th of shrooms and did lines of coke. immediately after, we packed ground DMT onto bowls of weed and boiled it gently with a lighter until the DMT was fully vaporized, then torched the bowl. that is a really gnarly combo if you like weed

				neither dmt nor shrooms produces much oxidative stress, tachycardia, or vasoconstriction. in fact, dmt produces virtually no vasoconstriction at all. all the stimulant effects are attributable to the cocaine itself, which has actually been proven to yield no serotonergic neurotoxicity despite its 5-ht releasing effects. i would not try the same with any amphetamine compound, however, as most amphetamines have at least mild MAOI activity<br /><br />sawyer
