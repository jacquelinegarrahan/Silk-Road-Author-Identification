				The veins in your hands, although they look closer to the surface of your skin and are more visible, are not the safest to use. The skin on your hands is very loose so your veins aren&#039;t in there very tight. It is very easy for these veins to roll away from the tip of the needle. So that when you try to insert the tip of the pin, the pressure pushes the vein to the side. On top of this, the veins in your hands and feet don&#039;t heal as well as say the ones in your arms (this is what i have been told anyway).<br />If you feel a burn, stop injecting immediatly and apply pressure to the site. This is to disperse the water you just injected under your skin faster. The reason so many infections result from popping is because you have a little pool of contaminated water under your skin with the perfect temperatures and environment to breed bacteria. <br />Keep pushing on the lump to work the fluid you just injected into your body before it just sits there and festers. And yes, antibiotics would help as well. However, I&#039;m not sure what ones would be ideal for this kind of issue.<br />Sorry nobody here had much advice for you. This is the drug saftey forum and harm reduction should be number one.&nbsp;

When I read his/her post, I got the impression that this had happened a few days prior to the posting, seeing as he/she posted out of boredom about the swollen hand (did the swelling start an hour ago? two days ago?), and apparently had already spent some time asking his/her &quot;junkie friend.&quot; <br /><br />Not to mention the total lack of additional input from Patetin. The post was originally written June 9th at 6pm (my time), with no additional information until two days after the fact. <br /><br />How can I say whether or not Patetin needs to be examined or if a course of antibiotics need to be started if I have no clue what is happening on the other side of the screen.<br /><br />I try to be as helpful as I can and stress the importance of harm reduction, but I can&#039;t do it alone.<br /><br />sdesu<br />

				<br />After 3 days it looks better and it&#039;s not as swollen as before.. went to the doctor who said no need of antibiotics (I took way too many) and just wait and may be keep taking the -hirudoid- gel cream I did take.. Lesson learned: no antibiotics, pro blood circulation gel cream medications..

				Good thing everything turned out alright for you. I only even inject in my hands if I have no other choice, and I make sure I use a brand new 29-31 gauge needle so I don&#039;t bruise the delicate areas. Also, in any injection scenario, the moment the needle goes under the surface of your skin, pull the plunger back just a little bit -- this will create a vacuum in the chamber and the second you&#039;ve entered a vein you will see the register and you know to stop pushing the needle deeper. This technique results in much less piercing through the vein, and PLEASE don&#039;t ever dig for a vein (move the needle back and forth, up and down etc.), always pull the needle completely out and try again normally. I know it hurts a little more to stick yourself again, but the digging does MASSIVE damage people don&#039;t realize.

				Hi,<br /><br />This sounds like you are using an opiate and shot into a ARTERY not VEIN, as when you do that the drug will not go back to the heart but instead get dispersed to your hand causing a bitch of a histamine reaction.&nbsp; You should have taken anti-histamines and yes any medication that will help with blood flow will help with the swelling and pain.<br /><br />I sell a salve that contains a VERY high amount of Capsacin that can be used to increase blood flow and works for celulitis or other infections or things like this, as the capsacin increases blood flow so much your wounds heal faster and you don&#039;t need antibiotics.&nbsp; I use it all the time the cannabis salve also has it&#039;s own healing and antibiotic properties plus all the other essential oils that I add like Tea Tree, jojoba, grape seed, etc.<br /><br />I sent out a bunch of samples but have not heard back although this situation is exactly where you could use it, here is the link http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a55098c7b1<br /><br />Stay safe.<br /><br />Regards!

				The capsaicin cream should only be used for pain and inflammation. If OP is taking Hirudoid, this means there&#039;s inflammation in his hand secondary to a blood clot in the vessel. If you doctor is telling you to continue the Hirudoid, then continue it. If you want to use something else like the capsaicin ointment, then that is your choice.<br /><br />sdesu
