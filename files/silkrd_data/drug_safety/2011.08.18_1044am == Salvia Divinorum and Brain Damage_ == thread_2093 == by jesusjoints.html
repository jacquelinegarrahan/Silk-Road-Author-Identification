				Very doubtful that using 25x Salvia Divinorum, expecially once, would cause any problems whatsoever.&nbsp; Beware the fear mongers..... They&#039;re EVERYWHERE.

				I&#039;m pretty sure you risk more brain damage watching an episode of Lost (haha). No man, salvia is fine. There&#039;s this strange &#039;this is your brain on drugs&#039; nonsense that has persisted for 30 odd years. The advertisements and fear mongering stopped (kind of, somewhat) when conclusive scientific data was publicized proving that not only do brain cells regrow and repair themselves, but that thinking, reasoning, learning, and (dare I say it) using certain mind altering substances stimulate cell growth and proliferation. Real brain damage is caused by severe head trauma, not psychoactive compounds. But don&#039;t just take my word for it, that&#039;s what google scholar&#039;s for. There&#039;s a lot of good info out there.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DiMiTri

				You probably refer to Olney&#039;s Lesions, which <br /><br />- are only observed in rat brains so far<br /><br />- only are observed to happen at very high doses of PCP (and maybe DXM, idk)<br /><br />Basically, smoking salvia a few times a year won&#039;t hurt in any way as in you couldn&#039;t tell someone did it 5-10 years later... except maybe for the epiphanies he had ;)<br /><br />Much love, M

				Plants in the genus Salvia are rather not toxic, as a general rule. Nothing more toxic than thyme, lavender, or rosemary, all things people cook with everyday, and most species are far less toxic. Hell, regular old sage, the sort that you might find in pasta sauce, scones, or meat rubs or whatever, has been shown to be effective at retarding the progression of Alzheimer&#039;s. As long as you don&#039;t pull a Don Quixote and chug a barrel of a concentrated extract of the stuff, you&#039;ll live to tell about it.<br /><br />Salvinorin A — the chemical that gives S. divinorum its effects — has both low overall toxicity (the LD50 is so high it hasn&#039;t even been discovered yet, last I checked) and it happens to be active at extremely small doses on top of that. We&#039;re talking just a few hundred micrograms. That is, a few hundred ug total; we&#039;re not even talking per kilogram of body mass. There are overwhelmingly few substances that are toxic at that scale. Even prussic acid is hardly toxic at that level. You&#039;re probably ingesting waaaay more cyanide every time you munch on marzipan. So that&#039;s another thing that works out favorably.<br /><br />Think of this as an herbal medicine that puts you on a more mystical sort of trip, and respect it as such. Take the basic precautions: have a spotter nearby, stay well away from places and objects that might hurt you, and get your emotional baggage squared away. That said, the trip is short, so you&#039;re naturally less likely to find yourself in danger too.<br /><br />All around, it&#039;s a safe plant, barring any possible psychological effects. Don&#039;t buy into the mass media bullshit.

				However, as I wrote, be aware that many dissociatives may cause Olney&#039;s Lesions at very high doses and repeated times (I suspect something like 30mg smoked every day for a month).<br />Just wanted to let you guys know, that the LD50 and other toxicity measures don&#039;t tell this.<br />Anyway, salvia is one of the safest things I think if you can handle the trip.<br />Much love, love, love

				Its safe, but nothing in excess can do you good.<br /><br />Anyway, you people want to try 25x more than one time? When I did 5x I saw a chocolate car with lolipop handbrakes, then I had &quot;the book&quot; trip´, and I awake in an red world in another body. For me, it was 3 hours trippin, but when I got back in this world, the trip lasted 5 min. <br /><br />On second thought, I will buy more salvia.<br /><br />Peace and Love

Salvinorin A is a kappa-opioid agonist and D2 dopamine receptor partial agonist, and it&#039;s effective at far smaller doses than those lesions have been observed to appear at. But for the sake of argument, let&#039;s say it&#039;s possible. Even then, there&#039;s no evidence of any permanent damage with repeated or chronic exposure to the substances that cause Olney&#039;s Lesions. After you stop administering those drugs (like PCP or ketamine), they go away on their own within a day or two. Besides, like you mentioned yourself, they&#039;ve only been observed in rodent brains.<br /><br />But anyway, no point in splitting hairs. We both agree that Salvia divinorum is probably the safest hallucinogen out there. Cheers! :)

				Just for the record, I think N2O is safer ;)<br />No really, salvia is pretty save and well I didn&#039;t actually look into what you said yet and will do so now. Thanks a lot for the enlightening post!<br />But anyway, salvia is really good to go. Try it if you haven&#039;t!<br />much love

				Tried it once, back in high school. Really strong extract, forgot how much exactly. Took a hit, blacked out. Friends said I was catatonic for a couple of minutes. Don&#039;t remember a thing, but I do remember feeling quite alright afterwards. Probably went too hard too fast. Been meaning to try it again sometime. Definitely should, while it&#039;s still legal.<br /><br />I agree that nitrous is great stuff. Funny thing about it, though: it causes Olney&#039;s Lesions. lol :P But seriously, as long as you don&#039;t put yourself in a situation where you can suffocate and make sure to take your B-vitamins, it&#039;s probably the safest drug on the planet. Gets you fucking stupid and then less than a minute later, you&#039;re back, then you huff again, then you&#039;re back. Brings back some fun memories from high school. Sad to hear about kids huffing glue and solvents when nitrous is so cheap, safe, and abundant. Hello kiddos, you can just grab the whipped cream can out of the fridge and have a good time! Or make a cracker, buy some whippets, and fill a few balloons.
