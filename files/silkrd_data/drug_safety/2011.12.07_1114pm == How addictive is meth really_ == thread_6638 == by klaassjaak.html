				Dear forumusers...<br /><br />I was looking into crystal meth recently, and got a little interested... My only question is though, how addictive is it really?<br />I hear all kinds of horror-tales that you are addicted after one dose, and can&#039;t stop using it... But I didn&#039;t read anything about it being THAT fysically addicting at all... Did read about psychological risks however...<br />And since you appear to be a good and trustworthy source of information about drugs, I turn to you.<br /><br />I&#039;m overall very content with my life, so it&#039;s not like I need drugs to make me happy or anything. I do everything out of curiosity, just want the experience, and want to explore. In my mind this makes me less prone to addiction already, but I&#039;m not that experienced yet so I&#039;d love some advice on this! Oh and, meth will surely not be the next thing I try, I&#039;m surely going to try coke, speed, ket, and mda before I&#039;ll even consider. (only did pot, mdma/pills, lsd so far)<br /><br />So basicly, my question is really... Is it really THAT addictive? Or is it safe for me to try it once, without having a huge craving for the rest of my life? I&#039;m fine with a week of &#039;longing for the drug&#039; but I&#039;m wondering if it can be used recreationally (like only once, or maybe once or twice a year). Or is this just too damn hard?

				This is my very first post on the forum, so take this for what it&#039;s worth...<br /><br />Yes, meth can be and is used recreationally-only by many people. It won&#039;t addict you on the first try, aside from the tautology that every addict tried something for the first time, which treats one-time or occasional users as if they didn&#039;t exist.<br /><br />On the other hand, don&#039;t underestimate the seductiveness of feeling powerful, focused, energetic and attractive. Because that&#039;s probably how you&#039;ll feel on it. YMMV.<br /><br />My advice in trying for the first time is to snort, not smoke. Guys that I&#039;ve known who got tangled up all were smoking it.<br />

				Yeah, meth is addictive, but it is possible to use it without becoming addicted. You just have to really have self control. <br /><br />I used meth for a LOOOONG time before I became addicted.&nbsp; For months and months, I could buy 1 gram and it would last 2 weeks. I just snorted a tiny bit in the morning and it kept me going all day long, then I would go to sleep every night. When I started smoking it was when it really got me. It takes more of it to get you high and you&#039;re always chasing the high, I started using it more and more often, then before I knew it I was using it every day. I don&#039;t really even remember the first time I ran out of meth and actually experienced the &quot;Crash&quot;, but it fucking sucked. It REALLY sucks though, because it brings me a few moments of happiness, but other than that, my life is joyless with or without meth. When I use it, it&#039;s not like all my problems go away, and it really doesn&#039;t make me that happy for that long. But my problems don&#039;t go away when I don&#039;t use it either, and i feel nothing but anger and horrible depression, so I guess the few moments of happiness seem worth the permanent damage to my body &amp; brain? I really couldn&#039;t tell you why I use meth, because I hate being so dependent on something so stupid.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t tell anyone not to use it, just be very careful and make sure to control yourself. It may even be wise to let a close friend know about your use of it, so they can tell you when they think you might be overdoing it. I dunno though, but it sure is a hell of a drug.

				I usedit a few times. Luckily I never got close to becoming addicted... Because I fucking hated it!!!&nbsp; :) lol.<br /><br />I found it so pointless, especially compared to MDMA or psychedelics that might actually teach you something.<br /><br />It&#039;s neurotixicity, shocking come downs and severe paranoia, (especially if you are a weed smoker) were enough reasons for<br />me to keep away. <br /><br />Sorry to be a hater, but to me&nbsp; Meth exists purely as a massive profit machine. It is cheap and easy to make and a high percentage of people that use<br />it become addicted to create a lovely captive market<br /><br />We call it crack in Australia, we don&#039;t get real crack, but this shit is doing enough damage over here to earn the title....&nbsp;

				I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty damn addicting. I tried it once about 7 years ago. Didn&#039;t find it all that appealing, it lasted to long. I recently purchased a half a gram and went through it all in about a 13 hour period.. smoking it. I think I wasted a lot by burning it because I didn&#039;t feel completely geeked out and only stayed up for about 12 hours after I ran out. I can say that I wanted more.. which is why I&#039;m glad I had no supply locally. I don&#039;t plan on buying more. I felt like shit for 2 or 3 days afterwards, still was thinking about doing more, which is why I am going to stay away. <br /><br />If you do try it, don&#039;t smoke it.

				As someone who&#039;s been hooked on many things in the past, heroin, coke, meth, etc, let me tell you, meth (along with H, was the most difficult to quit... DON&#039;T do it. <br /><br />Meth is not just addictive but it ruins your health, makes you depressed, you look like shit and it turns you into an INSTANT ASSHOLE. NOBODY likes a meth-head. They are notoriously repulsive people... and yet in their delusion, they think they&#039;re really smart and confident. Trust me, I&#039;ve been one.<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re into being wired, stick with coke, just snorting, obviously, not basing or crack. (although personally I won&#039;t touch the shit). At least with coke you have a fighting chance of quitting.&nbsp; Serious.<br />

				Half a gram in 13 hours is a lot. That would keep me speeding for 3 days. You must have wasted some or have a naturally high tolerance. <br /><br />I like that it lasts a long time compared to coke. Coke&#039;s good for partying while meth is better for getting shit done like reading, writing, cleaning, and working. It keeps me going at work without running to the bathroom every 20 minutes to powder my nose, but I can also sit for hours reading and writing after a couple lines.<br /><br />Smoking and shooting are far more addictive and dangerous than snorting or eating just like with most other drugs. I haven&#039;t smoked meth yet, but I have smoked crack and it&#039;s almost like a totally different drug compared to snorting coke because the effects are so much stronger and come on so hard and fast.<br /><br />I&#039;m not much of an asshole on meth and I don&#039;t get paranoid though I do like having some weed and benzo&#039;s on hand for the comedown to help me sleep.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to try it, but know your limits. Whether you get addicted or not depends a lot on your personality. Some people seem to be able to try anything without getting hooked while others are ready for rehab after a few uses.

				It&#039;s hard to say because everyone will have a different reaction to it. I hate the stuff myself. Makes me feel super anxious and not that buzzed. I don&#039;t think I could get addicted unless I really tried.

				I was disappointed with meth. I had tried CLEAR CRYSTAL SHARDS. I snorted small bump lines and it did give me some serious focus on some computer work I had to do, but I got no euphoria or any of the great effects people state about it. It put me in a serious mood too, plus made me have OCD like tendencies. Then again I only used about 100 mg in a 12 hour period, so maybe it was too little. I&#039;m sure the quality was quite pure though as it looks just like dopeboy or vortex&#039;s meth... I prefer amps as they tend to make me much more talkative and give a lot more euphoria to me. Plus it lasts shorter.

				It does affect people differently. Amp makes equally talkative and focused but less euphoric than meth. No OCD for me. I do feel more anxious and tweaked from meth but I usually take bigger doses and stay up for 2 or 3 days at a time. The comedown is worse but isn&#039;t that bad unless I use every day for a while. Maybe try a little benzo next time to take the edge off. ;) I have only taken amp orally and snorted whereas I&#039;ve IV&#039;d meth. Definite euphoria there. Smoking is a lot better too I&#039;ve read, but I don&#039;t have a proper pipe to try it yet.<br /><br />According to this chart, benzos, barbiturates, tobacco, cocaine, and heroin are all equally or more physically or psychologically addictive. I didn&#039;t have enough money for both and bought H instead of meth so I believe those rankings. It was definitely harder to quit alcohol too. The physical withdrawal is much worse for the depressants. That&#039;s what really gets me wanting to do anything to get more. I didn&#039;t have any trouble quitting coke. It makes me more anxious and feels harder on my body but less on my mind than meth.<br /><br />Drug&nbsp; Mean&nbsp; Pleasure&nbsp; Psychological&nbsp; Physical<br /><br />Heroin &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0<br />Cocaine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3<br />Alcohol &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.93 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.6<br />Tobacco &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8<br />Barbiturates &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8<br />Benzodiazepines &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.83 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8<br />Methamphetamine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.67 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1<br />LSD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.3<br />Ecstasy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.7

				Erowid is my go-to site for what I consider to be the least biased source of drug information. The trip reports are fun and semi-informative, but I&#039;d trust them as much as I&#039;d trust some random dude standing in line at the gas station next me.<br /><br />Back on topic.... I find it to be an incredibly useful tool for getting shit done that requires a particular kind of focus. Smoking it didn&#039;t do it for me at all, so I guess either I can&#039;t get the technique right or I&#039;m a freak of nature. Either way, the thought of going through .5 in a day blows my mind and isn&#039;t something I want to work at figuring out how to do.<br /><br />Answers to this will always depend on your own special mixture of biology and psychology. Think of it like leprosy, you might be genetically immune to it, but how much are you willing to risk to find out?

				Every drug user I ever met, they either love it or hate it. The ones who hate it, won&#039;t ever touch it again. For people who love it it can be one of the harder addictions to ever break because of the awful (months) withdrawal and longterm side effects that result from chronic abuse. That said, not all USE is ABUSE and it CAN be used responsibly. Not by everyone.

				It&#039;s a compulsive kind of addiction... which eventually turns into psychological and in some cases physical addiction.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like LSD or E where you try it once and forget about it. It becomes the go-to drug for getting things done. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bit like strong coffee on steroids. The crash is equally bad... in which case you just do another bump, then you crash, then you bump... until you&#039;re physically and mentally a wreck. <br /><br />Nasty stuff.

				I take back my previous response in saying that I was disappointed with Meth. I only tried it last week Thursday as I have a lot of data capturing to be done these holidays so I figured I would try it and see if it helps...<br />I have a very high stimulant tolerance to Methcathinone which definitely gave me some cross tolerance to the Meth(Crystal). Myself and my brother were in the same boat. Same stimulant tolerance,same height,weight everything identical basically. Both our first times with Meth and we only got it to see how much stronger it is than Methcathinone. It really isn&#039;t much stronger in terms of stimulation but it gives a much clearer,deep head high which allows us to vastly concentrate a lot better. He was working on the data capturing too. The first bag weighed 450mg and we finished it in 2 days. We bought another 1 which was 300mg and finished that in 2 days. We then bought another 1 which was 500mg and are still busy using whilst we work. We started on Thursday and it&#039;s now Tuesday 3pm. We have slept at least 6 hours each night thanks to benzo&#039;s.<br /><br />So we tried it for the first time last week and have now done it each day for 6 days. We shower,shave,brush our teeth,eat GREAT BIG WHOLESOME MEALS like 4000 calories each as we need them else we can&#039;t function as we feel the meth drain energy from our reserves, so we try keep them stocked up as much as possible. We drink loads of fluids,take 1g of vitamen C per day plus some L-tyrosine as soon as we wake up in the morning.We also take 1 multi-vitamen and mineral especially high in B vitamens. We usually start doing lines at about 12 and finish at about 11 or 12 and head to bed at about 2 with some help with Benzo&#039;s of course.<br /><br />We have both felt no euphoria at all yet we are just thrilled it has helped out with this immense pile of work. We are almost done and won&#039;t be using again until end of next year when we have this much work to do again. My brother and I totally agree that we could only use it for work purposes as all it seems to give us is incredible focus and motivation...We basically just sitting in front of a computer typing and can&#039;t see ourselves using Meth to go out to a club or bar.<br />We found no recreational value in it and it was purely used to help get a lot of work done as soon as possible. We feel quite normal with a bit of tiredness each morning which is expected, no hangover effects too.<br /><br />I think using Methamphetamine these last 6 days plus maybe 1 or 2 more days to come, combined with our daily routine vastly decreased any negative side effects we could have. I can&#039;t see myself using again unless I get stuck with a really large pile of work like this data capturing, although I only ever do this work at the end of each year. Otherwise Methamphetamine can be useful in my particular situation with the right amount of precautions and care taken.<br /><br />I see how some love it, and some love to hate it. I&#039;m neutral on the subject!<br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Due to its rather extreme potency and purity coupled with just how easy it is to consume stupidly large doses I consider dosage to be one main factors in determining how addictive one finds meth.&nbsp; Personally I started with 5mg doses and did it did not fuck my life up, initially at least. On the other side I&#039;ve seen and heard of unsuspecting noobs consuming a few points as fast as possible, often times encouraged by sleazy dealers.&nbsp; The resulting near instant brain damage from one such dose will likely make it damn near impossible to enjoy life as one once did without several months of recovery and most likely a loyal custy for some time to come.&nbsp; Great for the dealer, not so great for the noob family.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep in mind that dextro methamphetamine hydrochloride is also the exact same active ingredient in a prescription drug that is considered safe&nbsp; and benign enough to prescribe to children, in very low doses of course. While the notion that meth abuse can cause brain damage is well supported by scientific evidence if taken in a controlled and responsible manor it is entirely possible to take more from it than it does you without ending up fucked for life.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please note I&nbsp; not trying to claim meth is harmless, safe, or that you yourself will not end up living under a bridge blowing truckers to buy meth until you die in 6 months. <br /><br />

				meth is not really psychologically addictive. its not like xanax or heroin that you can die from stopping if you have been on it for too long, BUT with that said it is horribly psychologically addicting. i only partake occasionally and only started again because sr allows me to have&nbsp; steady supply BUT not steady access. so even if i fiend by the time it comes i wont want it anymore so i dont order. never do meth if you have a constant personal connection because you will fuck you life up. if you want to try though be safe and go through sr also only order a half gram or .25 your first time so you dont have a bunch left over and the thought to do more. my choice would be vortexmilkman since he always ships straight shards. goodluck and stay safe

				i ordered 1gr. of cma from heis over a month ago, split it with my brother. we both made a mixture of crushed up cma, dmaa, caffeine and asprin and capped them (5/50/35/300). pretty much made it so where if we took more than 10mg of cma in a day we&#039;d get sick from all the other shit we put in the capsule.<br /><br />we both still have over 2 weeks supply.<br /><br />here&#039;s the trick. don&#039;t smoke it, don&#039;t snort it. take it orally in the morning like you would any other pharm that addresses AD(H)D and you&#039;ll be fine. if you have to stop suddenly for a drug test or some other reason you&#039;ll be at best a little irritable for a day or two... nothing extreme.

				Orally is far safer and less addictive. Of course you won&#039;t get high that way either if that&#039;s what you&#039;re after. Smoking and IV are the only ways to fully experience meth. Just be careful not to OD and have a heart attack or stroke.<br /><br />You are stacking stimulants which multiplies their effects. When I take meth with just a little caffeine, I feel jittery and overstimulated. How does the aspirin help? Is it to reduce pain from fatigue and sore muscles? I&#039;ve seen it in supplements like TCA stack. I can work like a machine for hours if I take a little meth mixed with a strong opiate. No hunger, no tiredness, no pain, no feeling. Not doctor recommended, but it works for sure.<br /><br />I feel tired and irritable for a couple days if I stop drinking coffee from caffeine withdrawal. The meth withdrawal is a little worse, but not much after only a few day binge.

				Holy shit that&#039;s a lot. After not using for 4 years I shot around 50 mg (just eyeballed but I tried to use 1/10 of the half gram) of vortex&#039;s and my legs felt wobbly, my vision got blurry, and my head spun from the rush. .2 or .3 would tweak me out of my mind all day.

				well i&#039;ve just now in the past few days started trying some meth thanks to dopeboy &lt;3<br /><br />for some backstory i&#039;ve been prescribed various amphetamines at various doses and frequently snorting since highschool and honestly couldn&#039;t get addicted to them if i try, i mean, i like how i feel on them, i can get shit done, and a good tweak every once in a blue moon can be massive fun too. but i found myself completely incapable of taking them everyday because I don&#039;t really want to be a machine every day, incapable of relaxing and enjoying things like i normally would for the entire day, even after the comedown with benzos and weed at my side. when i wake up again the next day it&#039;s just, man i don&#039;t want to do that again.<br /><br />so far i&#039;ve only been smoking the meth, and i can definitely see how the smoking makes it so much more addictive, after it starts to comedown it&#039;s easy to just go back for a little more to instantly re-energize. and when i get up in the morning i can just pick up the pipe and perk up a bit right then and there. it&#039;s so much more temping than swallowing a pill and waiting for longer lasting effects to ramp up. i imagine once i try swallowing it i&#039;ll find that it won&#039;t be a very significantly different story from other amphetamines<br /><br />this was my third day, i&#039;ve been aiming for 20mg per day (split across four times throughout the day)<br />but each redose gets less rewarding. The third day&#039;s first dose got me up and feeling good and getting stuff done, but the redoses just didn&#039;t get me back there at all, kind of wasted most of the day. and after my allotted 20mg had been used up and it got to be early night (but still a redose&#039;s worth of activity ahead of me) i kind of had to struggle to not go for a little more. which is the first time i&#039;ve ever really had that happen with a stimulant. it wasn&#039;t really a very hard temptation to resist at all, but i&#039;m also only three days into a low dose meant more for medical reasons... and i don&#039;t think i&#039;m particularly susceptible to stim addiction in general (oxycodone&#039;s what scares me)<br />i have to imagine that somebody else that&#039;s more susceptible to going for more, or that&#039;s smoking to get rushing and tweak out and redose that, or doing that on a frequent basis, it could probably get really bad pretty quickly.<br /><br /><br />fuck this is a long post, sorry about that, this is what happens when i&#039;ve come down but haven&#039;t taken stuff to sleep yet<br />i think i&#039;ll take a break tomorrow, probably take some modafinil to try and feel closer to baseline.. modafinil is such a fucking clean stimulant. doesn&#039;t treat my symptoms quite well enough and i don&#039;t think it has a whole lot of recreational potential, but it certainly improves energy levels with such minimal side effects, really nice, clean stuff

				Note: I&#039;m writing this under a new forum account for obvious reasons. I&#039;m sure this is going to end up being a too-long;didn&#039;t-read post, but I really felt like I had to share my experience. I apologize if this is rambling but I&#039;m finding it a bit hard to focus due to the withdrawal effects.<br /><br />Meth is one of those drugs I always assumed was over-hyped and demonized to the extreme like cocaine. I have been an infrequent (once a month) coke user for a few years, never really having any problems with it other than maybe doing a bit too much and being tired and stuffed up the next day. So since coming to SR I figured meth was one of those things I should experience for myself before jumping to any conclusions about it. I assumed from what I read that it would just be a longer-lasting, harder-hitting coke high, and as a bonus you only need a very small line to get there. I had (and still have) absolutely no desire to smoke or IV meth, I knew I&#039;d mess it up and those methods definitely seemed more dangerous. I assumed from my coke experience that I could control myself and try it without any really negative consequences.<br /><br />I ordered a 500mg baggie from one of the top-rated sellers. It looked very high quality, mostly solid crystals, and there didn&#039;t seem to be enough to cause any problems. Having read a previous report in this thread I thought I would try to use a small amount to power through some work I had been putting off. With my newly acquired milligram scale I broke off and weighed out about 15mg of one crystal. I then crushed this into as fine a powder as possible using the bottom of a cup. Compared to a line of coke this seemed like basically nothing. It went up the nose easily and did not have any taste that I could tell, so far so good. (The taste of coke is about the only thing I hate about it.) It burned like a bitch though! But that went away after about 30-60 seconds.<br /><br />I put my stuff away and laid down on my bed. I started getting a nice rush after maybe 5-10 minutes. It really felt a lot different than coke, which was surprising to me. Coke often gives me a burst of energy and makes me go clean the kitchen or something, which is nice. I don&#039;t think I ever felt that while on meth, I was just too high I think. After a couple more minutes I thought I&#039;d get up and go see about doing that work. I definitely got up too fast as I felt quite dizzy and light-headed as soon as I stood up. This happens to me even sober if I&#039;m not careful so I just sat down for a minute to recover. I eventually managed to make it to my computer but found that I just couldn&#039;t concentrate on much of anything. I was very jittery and couldn&#039;t really sit still. <br /><br />The next 48 hours are a blur of crystals and the negative effects listed below. I was eventually able to get back to my work and write some really good code, and did manage to focus for several hours straight without getting up for a break. But there is no way it was worth it for only this small period of productivity.<br /><br />The first night I figured I would watch some porn and jerk off since I knew meth was supposed to really improve sex. This was surprising to me because cocaine generally has the opposite effect, with instant coke dick and making it very hard to get off. Meth dick was definitely in effect as well but I didn&#039;t find it as difficult to get it up. It took me a little longer than usual but eventually I was able to have the most amazing orgasm ever. It was literally unlike anything I had ever experienced and felt like it went on for minutes. This was great of course, but also scared the shit out of me. I knew this must be one reason people keep coming back to this drug. 24 hours later I tried again but while it felt good, I couldn&#039;t get it up or get off and gave up after some amount of time. This was actually probably a good thing even though it was very frustrating.<br /><br />Nearly the whole time, my heart rate felt dangerously high. I counted my BPM numerous times and it always seemed to be pretty reasonable and under 120, but this was pretty scary. I had felt this way only once on coke. There was not really anything I could do to slow it down, even deep breathing and lying completely still did nothing for it. I was terrified I would do one line too many and boom, my heart would just give up.<br /><br />By the end of the second day I was so strung out and was doing a line about every 2 hours. I could barely find the energy to sit up to drink some water, and doing simple tasks like letting the dog outside took extreme effort. I even put off the next line for a half-hour or so a couple of times because I was so drained. I was fucking miserable and knew I had to stop. But I still had like half of my baggie left! This was terrible, I initially thought I had such a small amount but it lasted forever. I decided that if I had any hope of making this only a 2-day bender instead of a 3 or 4 day one I had to trash the rest of my supply as soon as possible. I took one final crystal out of the baggie (35mg) as a last bit of fun, and before thinking too much about it flushed the rest and rinsed out the baggie. There was no going back now, I knew I could never score locally and getting more on SR would be a weeks-long process given Christmas. I knew this crystal was probably too much for one hit, but I really wanted to just get it over with and go to sleep so I didn&#039;t break it into 2 lines. This was when I tried to jerk off the second time, but maybe because of the higher dose or just lack of energy it didn&#039;t work out. I was able to go to sleep maybe 6 hours later, and got about 7 hours of sleep.<br /><br />I initially felt much better the next morning. I was proud of myself for having the will power to throw the rest of my stash out, and food finally tasted good again. Unfortunately a few hours after breakfast I started to feel like complete shit, and I realized this must be some serious withdrawal. I still had a large amount of coke so I thought maybe that would help take the edge off. It does help, a little bit, but only for about 45 minutes, ugh... I&#039;m bummed about having to waste my perfectly good coke just to feel slightly less shitty. And I hope I don&#039;t run out too soon...<br /><br />If there was ever a drug which could change my view that all drugs should be legal and people can be responsible for their own actions, meth might be the one. It is so ridiculously powerful that you should not treat it lightly or as something to fool around with or experiment with. Make absolutely sure you do not have easy access to more than a small amount. Start with a very small supply of maybe 250mg or less, and a couple days to waste, 500 is waaay too much despite seeming like so little. Obviously no one is going to listen to me, I know I wouldn&#039;t have, but I felt like I had to say it anyway. The word I kept saying to myself the whole time was &quot;evil&quot;.<br /><br />So overall:<br />Positives:<br />* Was able to get some work done, but not as well as I&#039;d hoped. I hope a saner drug like modafinil will be a better choice for this.<br />* If you can get it up at all, an orgasm is unbelievable.<br />* The initial rush is pretty good, but nothing you can&#039;t find in better drugs like MDMA. It also goes away pretty quickly.<br />* Completely changed my view on drug hype, I will be much more careful of other scary drugs (e.g. heroin) and should be less likely to want to try them.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* Very powerful effect from such a small dose. Absolutely avoid if you do not have an accurate milligram scale!!! I dosed a few times just by eyeballing it because I was too lazy/tired to get my scale out, which was very stupid. Of course at the time I easily rationalized this to myself, and luckily I was OK.<br />* Craving like I couldn&#039;t believe. I originally read that one hit lasted 4-6 hours or so, and managed to wait about this long. By the end, I was hitting 20mg every 2 hours.<br />* The worst fatigue I have ever experienced. I figured this was due to both a lack of sleep and lack of food. I think I slept about 2-4 hours the first night and maybe ate all of 600 calories Friday and the same on Saturday, if that.<br />* Just the mere thought or sight of food is very unappealing. I was used to this effect from coke but it was MUCH more intense. I lost about 5-8 pounds over the 2 days and had to pretty much force myself to eat several small high-calorie items to try to keep the fatigue at bay. A couple of pop tarts and oreos were all I could manage, and these tasted like complete shit, when normally I could eat a whole box. Of course I was not eating close to enough so these did nothing to make me feel better.<br />* I got some sort of horrible sore on my tongue, which I think came from rubbing it absentmindedly against my teeth for hours on end. Very painful and makes me think of what serious meth mouth must be like.<br />* Withdrawal is horrible, which I didn&#039;t expect since it was my first time and I only used it for 2 days. I am shaking, get chills, and have to do small bumps of coke just to feel a bit better for an hour. I expect this to get better in another day, and I really hope I can sleep tonight. Unfortunately the coke also makes me less likely to eat, which will probably slow down recovery. Will probably try to force myself to eat a few things. :(

				SR should start a new diet plan. I&#039;ve lost at least 10 pounds since I found this site.<br /><br />I can only get high for about 24 hours on meth. After that my brain is too depleted and I go into fried zombie mode. Tolerance comes and goes really fast like with other stimulants. I did it almost every day for a couple months and the withdraw lasted about a week. I was tired, depressed, and my nose wouldn&#039;t stop running. I had to drink about 10 cups of coffee each day to get through work.<br /><br />After crushing the crystals I stick the straw in the bag, snort, and hope for the best. I can lay down and read a whole book on meth and don&#039;t have much trouble eating either. Opiates kill my appetite more than stimulants for some reason.

				I got a bag once. It was like a $20 bag. It had me tweaked for 4 fucking days straight. Mostly a mental high and you kind of feel like you just took one step back from reality. Like you are looking through a window at yourself kind of. I hated it because those 4 days I didn&#039;t sleep a second, and on the 4th day when laying in bed trying to sleep I started hearing voices and ghosts n shit LOL Sleep deprivation and no more meth to wake me up lol Anyway it was kind of cool I suppose...Super fucking wired and really focused. It was like I was just really really fucking awake and sharp minded. I&#039;m not much for speed and haven&#039;t done it since. Some people may dig it, it just depends on what YOU like. :) Cheers<br /><br />P.S. - The 4 days I was on the ride I was snorting the stuff...and you don&#039;t need much either...I was doing little toothpick lines.<br /><br />P.S.S. - I felt no withdrawal symptoms period. But maybe it&#039;s because I bang opiates too lol

				meth has always been self-limiting for me.&nbsp; the euphoria just stops over the 18 to 24 hr mark.&nbsp; no matter how much i have.&nbsp; i call it the 24 rule, cause i can only be high for 24 hrs adn then i needed a few days to rest and recover.&nbsp; stims in general make me sick thinking of them, but i do enjoy them while on them.&nbsp; lately i&#039;ve found 4-fa to be my new fav, it lacks some of the euphoria of meth but is easier to recover from.<br /><br />meth always made me feel like an old lady after a binge.&nbsp; and a binge for me was like a quarter G of some mid-grade cloudy crystal.&nbsp; my bones ache and my brain hurts.&nbsp; but i think alot of people bounce back from it easily and thats where it becomes addictive.<br /><br />just set limits to use and make sure to keep liquids and liquid food coming.&nbsp; don&#039;t let 24 hrs go by without stopping and sleeping (and eatin).&nbsp; you need dopamine to get high and u need sleep and food to regenerate it.&nbsp; stims seem like they need external fuel to work, while opiates and cannabis bring the fuel with them.&nbsp; solid rocket vs. liquid rocket hehe!&nbsp; total astronomy geek reference.<br /><br />i think chemically pure meth might be less neurotoxic then alot of the garbage out there.&nbsp; i think most of the terrible side effects are caused more by binges without food, sleep, or dental care then the drug itself.&nbsp; u lose connection to natural body needs so u need to keep disciplined and on schedule.<br />haven&#039;t had meth in years and years and what i remember most is the *unbelievable mind blowing sex*!&nbsp; 4-fa is just as good for that tho and it has a softer, slightly empathogenic edge..&nbsp; and i can actually get off while on it (it was tough on meth, and i know it&#039;s really hard on guys...hehe pun intended).&nbsp; <br /><br />oral dosing seemed less compulsive.&nbsp; used to dump half a quarter G in mountain dew and sip slowly throughout a night.&nbsp; seemed to last longer..&nbsp; less rush easier come down.<br /><br />*destiny*<br />

I lost about 5-8 pounds over the 2 days and had to pretty much force myself to eat several small high-calorie items to try to keep the fatigue at bay. A couple of pop tarts and oreos were all I could manage, and these tasted like complete shit, when normally I could eat a whole box. Of course I was not eating close to enough so these did nothing to make me feel better.<br />* I got some sort of horrible sore on my tongue, which I think came from rubbing it absentmindedly against my teeth for hours on end. Very painful and makes me think of what serious meth mouth must be like.<br />* Withdrawal is horrible, which I didn&#039;t expect since it was my first time and I only used it for 2 days. I am shaking, get chills, and have to do small bumps of coke just to feel a bit better for an hour. I expect this to get better in another day, and I really hope I can sleep tonight. Unfortunately the coke also makes me less likely to eat, which will probably slow down recovery. Will probably try to force myself to eat a few things. :( <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^^^ Excellent report!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks man.<br /><br />

It is so ridiculously powerful that you should not treat it lightly or as something to fool around with or experiment with. Make absolutely sure you do not have easy access to more than a small amount. Start with a very small supply of maybe 250mg or less, and a couple days to waste, 500 is waaay too much despite seeming like so little. Obviously no one is going to listen to me, I know I wouldn&#039;t have, but I felt like I had to say it anyway. The word I kept saying to myself the whole time was &quot;evil&quot;.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>interesting, out of curiosity how much experience do you have with other amphetamines? from your post it didn&#039;t sound like a significant amount<br /><br />thinking about it, during the years of amphetamine experience i have, especially earlier on, i had so many awful experiences with them, and can only imagine how much worse they would have been with the higher level of temptation and craving that meth has. When I think about it that way, I can&#039;t help but completely agree with you on how seriously meth should be treated.<br /><br /><br />although, having all of the years of experience i do, i feel that i was able to treat meth with the level of respect it deserves, and i haven&#039;t had any troubles with smoking it. I started meth fully aware of how hellish amphetamine side effects can be to me, and what i need to do to keep them semi-manageable, and just generally in-tune with what levels of stimulation i want/can maintain. The first time i tried it i smoked a recreational amount and it really felt great, but i knew all too well how useless it would be for me to try to maintain that level of stimulation, and that it can&#039;t really be any more than a once in a blue moon kinda thing. it was only 20mg. so the next day i drastically dropped the dose down and set limits in an attempt to look for a therapeutic dose, and didn&#039;t have much trouble sticking to those limits or stopping.

				In my experience meth is wickedly addictive... i&#039;ve only used it a few times (2 day binges each time) and had a 2 day binge on amphetamine.&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to cut back... normally I would have ordered some for this weekend... and I am definitely missing it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m glad that SR forces me to wait a week or 2 between purchase and use.&nbsp; &nbsp;If i could call up a dealer (and i&#039;m sure there are a lot in my city... but I have no idea where to begin to look), I would be in serious trouble.. I definitely would be using now.&nbsp; <br /><br />It affects everyone differently but if I could go back in time (only 2 months) i&#039;d tell myself to just get more MDMA and leave the meth alone.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if i&#039;d say I&#039;m addicted to meth... probably not... but I have a problem.&nbsp;

				I think that most people say they want to take it again because it was a good experience.&nbsp; I really dont see this as a problem, that is not addiction thats just wanting the good things in live.&nbsp; &nbsp;An addiction is when you know that it is going to affect you live negatively in some way (eg health,work, relationships), and you fight your inner demons (mentally addictive) and lose.&nbsp; Before I started taking ice about 6 months I had this problem with gambling, I just couldn&#039;t stop I knew it was bad.&nbsp; I would think I would go in play a little $50-$100 and be nearly crying after losing a $1000.&nbsp; With ice I want more, but currently I am not experiencing any bad effects.&nbsp; With ice I am having no trouble moderating use,&nbsp; at the moment I can get as much as I need, both locally and SR but am only using 1-2 times a week and often have breaks of 3-4 weeks, when I don&#039;t even think about it.&nbsp; But with gambling it was thinking about it 24-7, nearly drove me to suicide.<br /><br />
