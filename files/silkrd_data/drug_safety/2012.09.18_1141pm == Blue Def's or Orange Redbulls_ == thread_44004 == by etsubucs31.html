				I&#039;ve luckily managed to get my hands on both the hot presses right now the blue def&#039;s and the orange bulls. Has anybody tried them both out? Which would you recommend?

				I have had the chance to try both, and multiple different occasions. The blue defqons are definitely more faster acting and will hit you like a ton of bricks fast, but the redbulls I found to take a bit longer on the come up ( 1 - 1 1/2 hrs ) but I use quite often and have tolerance to good pills due to the road. Either one really is going to make you have a great time for 3 - 4 + hours with great afterglow and leave you feeling halfway decent the next day because they are both great presses and would recommend to anybody to pick some up while they are around.<br /><br />Hope this helps&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;ve had the chance to take both before. There is just something about the way blue defqons hit you whether you take half or the whole pill at once. The red bulls come on gradually and seem to last a bit longer and definitely lack some of the come up nausea if you were slamming down a defqon. To be quite honest though, the defqons are a lot more fun if you are just ready to roll hard with no regrets, red bulls are much more manageable for a longer more forgiving experience at the end. Either way both are great presses with some quality MDMA. Just be safe and enjoy.

				Tried the blue defqons, not a full 200mg. <br />Definitely not as powerful as the old white speakers.
