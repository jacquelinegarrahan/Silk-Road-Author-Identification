				While I don&#039;t think iDoser actually works, I believe we&#039;ll be able to make most recreational drugs obsolete in the next fifty years, with the aid of computers.

				there is some research into digital distribution of drugs but its a long way off yet (or i think so, the results of the experiments are seemingly impossible to get hold of) sure 50 years is a long time but in truth i think itll be longer than that, not something i think is likely to happen in any of our lifetimes, but it is almost definitely possible. its strange really almost like hacking a console, we can read out from it pretty well even though we may not understand it 100% but inserting anything in is the hard part, there are huge hurdles to overcome, computers are all relatively the same, sure they have a few different components be we humans have a little more variation to us (damn you genetic individuality) <br /><br />for the sake of a hypothetical situation lets call this recorded drug experience a &quot;sequence&quot;. when a sequence is recorded from a person and the electrical signals are taken from that individuals body there is no way to say that they will work the same when the sequence is played back through a different person, their nervous system may react differently just as we all have different reactions to regular drugs, so unfortunately thousands of these sequences will need to be taken on different people, then examined, understood, refined and then the testing begins on the &quot;playback&quot; part. <br /><br />personally id see it as more like 75-100 years but that all depends on funding and that depends on if big pharma see it as a bonus whereby they greatly lower manufacturing costs or if they see it as a big threat due to the potential of &quot;open source drugs&quot; if you will. you also have to consider the possible damage to industry, there are literally thousands even millions of people involved in the manufacture of meds, drop a digital distro method and you kill an entire industry, i know its working in the media industry at the moment but physical media still has its place to a point where as this could literally make the original tangible method obsolete in no time at all (aint it sad that money/profit so often gets in the way of progress)

				Idoser on it&#039;s own is pretty lame and did nothing for me when I tried it, maybe I do not have the right personality for it&#039;s effects to take me places, but perhaps using Idoser while on a particular drug could enhance the experience.&nbsp; Worth a try I say!
