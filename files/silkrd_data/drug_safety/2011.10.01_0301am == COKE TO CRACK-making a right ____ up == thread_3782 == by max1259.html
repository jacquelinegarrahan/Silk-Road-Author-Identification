				Just recently got a bit of coke and decided i wanted to rock it up but it&#039;s been a good few years since we last did it and i wasn&#039;t any good back then,today is no better.<br />&nbsp;We used to use a real crappy way,basically put the coke on the spoon with ammonia,slow cook then drain off the left over ammonia with some cotton wool etc,stir the stuff until hard and voila,one crap rock lol.<br />&nbsp;Anyway tonight i thought i&#039;d try and use Bicarb of soda but im shit scared of doing it in case i completely balls it all up and waste my money,i&#039;d use a tiny bit,maybe a quarter Gram but got a feeling it won&#039;t turn with that amount? <br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve just tried turning a small bit on the spoon using a small amount of coke and a quarter ratio of Bicarb,that&#039;s right isn&#039;t it? But it just wouldn&#039;t harden,maybe i used to much water,20mls? <br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve Googled the info but there&#039;s so many variations,even saw one where it said put a line on foil,sprinkle a bit of Bicarb and a few drops of water then spread the mixture over the foil and precede to smoke like Meth-never done meth so i wouldn&#039;t know.<br />&nbsp;Can anyone give me any help and bare in mind i don&#039;t want to waste it all and that includes snorting it,waste of time.<br />Peace

				I cooked my own in a spoon with bicarb whenever I could vs purchasing ready rock.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not the most efficient way but I felt better knowing I was the one who made what I was smoking (sort of).<br />I used a 3:1 / coke-soda mix, and I never measured the water just dipped my finger in a cup of H2O and dripped the water into the spoon until everything worked together and then i put a few drops more.&nbsp; Using a butter knife I would stir the mixture until completely incorporated then turn the (electric) stove top on high.&nbsp; Immediately after turning the stove on I would place said spoon on the element while it was heating up, again stirring the whole time until just a second after the contents came to a &quot;boil&quot; upon which I would remove the spoon from the heat, still stirring.&nbsp; As the water cools you should get a rock on your knife and the crap left in the spoon is just that: crap.&nbsp; It&#039;s trial and error that&#039;s for sure but if the coke&#039;s decent it should work.<br />Make sure you space out your smoking a little bit, lest you be staring out your darkened window too soon ::)<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t do more baking soda than 1:4 (baking soda to coke). If you have too much baking soda then it will stay in the crack a bit and you&#039;ll be getting smokey hits all night. <br /><br />rusty

				In my opinion converting cocaine hydrochloride to freebase using ammonia is the way to go, it is faster and easier while producing a superior product. To start one first needs to acquire the supplies. First one needs a suitable vessel for the reaction, for anything less than 5 grams a glass test tube or cigar tube is ideal. If a tube is not available a shot glass also works well enough and for small amounts one can use a spoon. Next one needs to find ammonia that is soap free. Easy way to tell if your ammonia is soap free is to shake, if you see it bubble up then its a no go and keep looking, unless of coarse you enjoy smoking soap.&nbsp; After that one just needs coke, a lighter, cold water, a filter( coffee filter, paper towel, rag, etc).&nbsp; <br /><br />First step is to add your coke to your test tube and then add ammonia, you can add as much as you want but don&#039;t really need all that much. You do want enough so that the fluid is not at all thick. I usually aim for about a half an inch or more higher than the coke filled up to.&nbsp; Then swirl it around to get it mixed well, make sure there are no clumps. Next take the lighter and using slow and gentle heat warm the stuff up. You don&#039;t want to boil it but you do want to see bubbles as the reaction commences. This should take like 10-30 seconds but could take much longer depending on the thermodynamic properties of your vessel and how much heat you applied. When done carefully add cold water till you start getting close to full, this should cause the freebase to solidify and float to the top. Next I like to use a small piece of an old but clean shirt over the end as a filter. Rather than dump all the ammonia water as fast as possible it is wise to go real slow and gentle. Next dump the filter onto a plate and let dry. Done! If your not patient enough to wait for the ammonia to evaporate or are a purity puritan you can rinse the freebase in cold water being very careful not to lose any. While I just did my best to make it sound as complicated as possible it is so very simple and only takes a minute or two.

				If you&#039;re just doing small amounts of rock at a time go to a grocery store and check out the coffee section.&nbsp; They sale a tiny metal measuring scoop/cup.&nbsp; It has a flat bottom and longish handle.&nbsp; It is perfect for small batches, you can put on stovetop to heat or use lighter/candle.&nbsp; I would cook in my garage at my workbench, put the handle on top of bench and put something heavy on handle to hold in place with the cup part hanging off edge, very easy to heat even with shaky hands that keep getting shakier!

				Ammonia is not the way to go.Baking soda+powder is the formula.Basically the key to rock up the blow is to use less water as possible.You only need water to stir the mix to make it paste-like after that.you stir it clockwise-couterclockwise till there&#039;s almost no water.Then simply let it sit there for a while or if your not patient enough just throw it in the microwave to rock the coke up.hope it helps.&nbsp;
