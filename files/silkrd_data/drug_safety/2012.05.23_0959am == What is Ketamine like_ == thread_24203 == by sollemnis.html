				I have a gram of K waiting to be dipped in to... I&#039;m a little nervous about it though. I&#039;ve tried MXE which is meant to be similar. How similar is K to MXE? Whats the best dose for a beginner? I don&#039;t want to hole .. I just want to get a feel for it.

				hello!<br />its kind of hard to compare ketamine to mxe, but very easy to compare mxe to ketamine.<br /><br />mxe is like sitting in the waiting room to the full on ketamine experience, with a 2-4 hour delay, and no matter how much mxe you take, it just keeps getting delayed. if you actually compare the both as alternatives to each other, prepare for disappointment. <br />&nbsp;<br />think of properly dosed ketamine as a very intense, short journey to the depths of your brain, where a &quot;hardware reset&quot; button is hit; the duration of the effects is the time it takes to &quot;reboot&quot; your brain. when its over, you are very glad to be alive, regardless if the ketamine experience was nice or not. usually the experience itself is very, very nice though. think of it as psychedelic heroin; strong, hard-hitting, cant be dosed oral without huge potency loss, exchanges most of your sensations with the &quot;sensation of ketamine&quot;, does a great job at seducing you into habitual use. if you lack experience, best have a big bowl of weed before you do the ketamine, sit down on your couch/bed/hammock, put some slow electronic music on your earphones and close your eyes. <br />at some point in your ketamine use career (If youre good at it ;) ) your become more and more confident to move around under the influence. especially when mixed with weed its one of the greatest intoxications im aware of for dancing. you just cant help but moving your body in perfect synchronization with the music; as if the beat is starts possessing you. its amazing :)<br /><br />in lower doses, it also makes a great job giving drugs that lost their magic for you their former glory back, since your brain is metaphorically in hardware reset mode, making you lose most of the preconceived opinions/notions and tolerance you have gathered to the substance you are mixing it with. ketamine, on the average, is also much safer to mix with other drugs than mxe. the only stuff you have to be really careful with when bringing some ketamine to the party is strong opioids (tenfolds the opiate potency), alcohol (blackouts/strong ataxia, aka loss of motor control), benzodiazepines (even stronger ataxia, also most of ketamines desired effects canceled out) and gbl/ghb (same as booze but worse).<br /><br />if you just want a taste of the effects, 0.75mg per kilogram of body weight snorted should do the trick. if you want to know what its really capable of, make it at least 1mg/kg or even 1.5mg/kg. moisten the powder slighty (or your nostrils heavily) and dont crush it too dusty.&nbsp; &nbsp;make sure not to swallow too much of the drip. it very much ruins the potency. also dont snort the whole heap/line at once, divide into 2-3 smaller parts and wait like half a minute between each bump. mixing it at least with cannabis or a synthetic noid is very advised.<br /><br /><br />have fun and good luck :)<br /><br />

				I have never been in to a K hole but MXE vs K is MXE is like derpamine compared to ketamine. Ketamine is like a cleaner feeling more giggly less derpy and not as trippy (in small doses don&#039;t know in large) and its a lot more spiritual. This is all just IMO though. Mxe also lasts like twice as long as ketamine lol<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				uncut ketamine (probably even cut ketamine) is an extremely safe drug (edit: physically safe, obviously you can get addicted)<br /><br />take small bumps to get acquainted with the drug<br />then take a full 100-120mg!!!<br />For real, the experience from 100mg compared to small bumps is so incredibly different.<br /><br /><br />[clearweb]<br />hxxps://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine_info3.shtml<br />[/clearweb]<br /><br /><br />Read the above link!<br />&quot;The most profound impact of Ketamine is it&#039;s effect on time. When becoming &quot;emergent,&quot; time begins to slow to a shuddering, thugging crawl - each moment stretches out into a sea of infinity and rolls sluggishly into the next. Seconds become minutes, minutes become hours, and eventually, in the peak, time ceases to have any meaning whatsoever. One enters a state of &quot;eternity&quot; (referrred to as &quot;alternity&quot; by John Lilly in The Scientist). This is not an eternity in the classic sense - meaning &quot;now&quot; stretched on until the end of time - but &quot;eternity&quot; in the singular sense, when all branches of linear time bend in on themselves and collapse into a timeless and eternal state of simultaneous existence.<br /><br />In &quot;eternity&quot; all events, actions, and interactions of the past, present, and future coexist simulteneously in one solid state. Not only can you see the &quot;domino&quot; cause and effect relationships between events which exist in close temporal and spacial proximity, you can also witness any event reverberating and iterating throughout the entireity of space and time. In &quot;eternity&quot; it becomes apparant that all events are simply shadows and echos of one massive primordial event or &quot;proto event&quot; which occured or occurs somewhere outside of linear time and 3-D space. It is not an event which occurs and ends - as we perceive events in linear time to do - but it is an &quot;eternal&quot; event, one which is constantly happening everywhere all the time which we are all a part of. Every action, event, sound, energy tranferrence, etc., are all just ripples of this singular event unfolding in a timeless, fractiline structure. &quot;

				I&#039;ve only ever done K once and I was really drunk at the time so needless to say it ended pretty badly. I really want to hit the k-hole though, apparently it is like a strong spiritual intensity but without the anxiety/impending sense of doom

				The first time I tried K was just a bump on the end of my friend&#039;s key. Twenty minutes after taking it, I don&#039;t feel anything, so I stand up, intending to wander around. About a second after I stand up, my body decides to go ahead and stand up too. Then my body and I promptly sat back down and enjoyed the feeling.<br /><br />The next night I rolled (random pressies) through 3.5 fat lines over 5 short breaks in my dancing marathon. When I first started with a skinny line (or fat half-line) the ketamine dropped me on my ass pretty quick, then I proceeded to combat the inability to control my own limbs. With focus and determination, I achieved in under twenty minutes what it takes newborns years to accomplish - I could do a handstand so long as I had a beam to brace the bottom of my feet against. I learned the following morning that this was largely thanks to the pressies. Regardless of how, I entertained myself and others by standing on one hand and making a K in honor of the night&#039;s main drug.<br /><br />The next morning, after the ecstasy had worn off, I was given one last fat line of ketamine. I was put on my ass again, but this time when I relearned how to walk by body and I were, as with the first bump, not in sync. When I danced on just that fat line, I found myself constantly almost falling only to have my own foot surprise me, coming from nowhere to catch me and keep me dancing upright. I tried to do a handstand, and despite that my form was reportedly good up until the end, the moment I was upside down I perceived that I had rolled into a ball, and I landed on my shoulder (thankfully without injury).<br /><br />Common to both straight K and K on top of pressies was a particularly pleasant sensation that arose only after re-associating with my body. I felt supremely energized and fit as a fiddle. It didn&#039;t feel particularly like a body high, as I had felt the same way (but rarely) when sober. It just felt really good. My headspace felt fairly clear, but judging by the people around me that was unusual.<br /><br />Next time I had a standard line, and the sensations fell somewhere between the two extremes of my experience. I noticed more clearly on that occasion a loss of the sensation of time passing (it didn&#039;t appear significant before as I was at a rave). I was with some new friends with a hookah, which was especially enjoyable that night. The very same night ended less pleasantly than it started when my friend was escorted out of Glendale by a cop, after someone saw him half in and half out of my car, totally out of it (I wasn&#039;t aware how incapable he was of handling the dissociation of ketamine).<br /><br /><br />Anyway, altogether enjoyable, though I&#039;m still quite curious as to what K-Holing is like, as I&#039;ve heard good things and seen neutral/bad things (everyone who K-Holed around me either didn&#039;t know it wasn&#039;t necessary or they didn&#039;t like it at all).

				ketamine can be a tricky space to get adjusted into, but once you&#039;ve got the hang of it, it is an amazing drug.<br /><br />as others have said, start with little bumps to feel it out...your first couple times in the hole will feel like a roller coaster because your mind just runs at its own speed and you&#039;re not really aware of what you&#039;re thinking.&nbsp; but after you hole a few times, you&#039;ll start to notice that you can control whats happening.&nbsp; your imagination is the only limit to what can happen in a K hole...sometimes its downright astounding what your mind will come up with.<br /><br />here&#039;s an exercise I think is good for newbies:<br /><br />1) Start by imagining the room you are sitting in.&nbsp; try to put all the furniture where it should be and see yourself in the room.&nbsp; <br />2)&nbsp; Now imagine a bird&#039;s eye view of your house.&nbsp; try to imagine the shape, your yard, driveway, car, etc.<br />3)&nbsp; now try to imagine your whole town.&nbsp; then state, continent, etc.<br />4)&nbsp; keep going until you&#039;re looking at the earth<br />5)&nbsp; look up to the stars and fly.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve had so much crazy shit happen to me on ketamine, i&#039;m not even gonna get into it.&nbsp; using it, though, has most certainly enabled me to lucid dream once in a while.&nbsp; also, i fly in my dreams constantly and attribute this to my ketamine use.<br /><br />just be careful though, don&#039;t get too caught up in your newly discovered world.&nbsp; this world here needs you too.&nbsp; have fun with the K, but after a few good runs, put it down for a couple months.&nbsp; i&#039;ve got no science to back this up, but i can tell its a heavy load on the system;&nbsp; there&#039;s no way this stuff can be safe for regular use.&nbsp; <br /><br />oh, and i disagree with the people who say to smoke before doing K; i find this increases nausea.&nbsp; smoke some weed on your way back; it&#039;ll feel great and allow you to reflect on the insanity which just unfolded in front of you

				Honestly I haven&#039;t done a whole lot of K so I can&#039;t give a super accurate description.<br /><br />I&#039;m planning on ordering half a gram so I am also interested in this topic.<br /><br />If I remember one particular description correctly it said that high &quot;k-hole&quot; doses combined with marijuana can cause an out of body experience.<br /><br />This pretty much sold me and I have wanted to get into ketamine ever since. Really cool to see high quality ketamine being sold on SR :).<br /><br />

				Thanks for the suggestion Space Wasp I am going to definitely be snorting K bumps while rolling hard.<br /><br />Ecstasy is such a great drug to begin with especially in regards to the euphoria and the mental nature of it. Combining it intensely with ketamine will definitely add to the experience.<br /><br />Super good advice.

				Today has been fucking amazing to put it bluntly.... I forgot to mention some drone came through as well :D. Which reminds me, when are you restocking Lim?&nbsp; I really want to try yours... <br /><br />I did a small bump of K an hour after bombing 200mgs of Mephedrone in a rizla... Wow... the K made a difference. Normally on drone I talk non stop on these forums, but I couldn&#039;t be arsed after the K... I was enjoying myself silly! I also got the &#039;floaty&#039; feeling... Drone makes me a little bit jittery normally, but the K took it all away! <br /><br />I love how fast it hits you/ It goes very well with the drone as well (Cheers for telling about this combo Lim) Also, when I looked outside the street lights looked amazing! Could be combo or just the K... I have heard colours are amazing on it though&nbsp; 8)<br />

				I&#039;ve been taking small bumps these past couple of days and it&#039;s like taking a big hit of nitrous but staying at the peak for 45 min. I can&#039;t really see this being a social drug though because you get so heavy I doubt you&#039;d be able to walk or talk, it&#039;s like taking a whole xanax bar but with some psychedelic properties to it (at higher doses). I really enjoyed it, I insufflated 70mg and laid down on my bed with some music playing and it&#039;s like I melted into the music, when I opened my eyes I could see colors morphing on my wall but they were short lived. The best part is after you come down the euphoria stays with you, at least for me it does because throughout the day I feel great, like if I took an antidepressant.

				I think you&#039;re right on with the cross tolerance from MXE last night.<br />Over 100mg down the nose right now and according to Erowid that&#039;s a &#039;strong&#039; dose :P <br />Only thing I&#039;m feeling is like I&#039;m drunk, but I guess that&#039;s just the nature of Ketamine (trying to put me down) <br /><br />Gonna give up now, I&#039;ll wait with this stuff till the SR Keta-night ;D

I remember some of it, but not all of it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yay, glad I could help!&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly experienced with most psychedelics, but ketamine is my specialty ;)&nbsp; It saddens me when I hear about people doing it all wrong for their introductory K experiences because they usually go on to talk about what a stupid drug it is.&nbsp; I can see how one would get that impression if they did it wrong, but if you do it right it can be an amazing and enriching life experience.<br /><br />as for not forgetting, hmmm... that can be tricky because so many parts of the k-hole are not compatible with &quot;real life&quot; reality.&nbsp; I know personally, that a lot of what has happened to me on K has been fleeting and I&#039;ve long since forgotten it in my day-to-day life.&nbsp; but here are a few comments I can make on this subject:&nbsp; <br />1)&nbsp; A lot of things you learn in a K hole are forgotten, but you remember them when you&#039;re in another K-hole.&nbsp; these experiences transcend time and space, so its only natural that you can&#039;t remember them when you are grounded in time and space.&nbsp; take comfort, though, in knowing that you&#039;ll remember the important stuff (like flying, fighting, conjuring, telepathy, etc.) when you NEED to remember it.&nbsp; Have faith in yourself and all that you need will be available to you when you need it.<br />2)&nbsp; when you realize something important, grab ahold of it as tight as you can!&nbsp; with a bit of experience, you will start to be able to tell what the important epiphanies are.&nbsp; For instance:&nbsp; I have battled depression for my whole life and it has affected my relationships greatly...in my current relationship I was focusing on the negative/difficult aspects so much that I had been thinking I should end it.&nbsp; but I went mental on a bag of K for a week and on day 5 i did a super mega line and saw my girlfriend as this loving butterfly, adding a bit of light to my dark and ugly outlook on life.&nbsp; I saw all the negative aspects as far less important than the love we shared and the beauty she holds and at that moment in the K hole i had the thought that I should marry her.&nbsp; so I held on to that realization and did just that :)&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember anything at all about the rest of that trip (and I know that it was epic) but I managed to carry that part back with me and it has proved invaluable!<br /><br />So sorry thats not really a straight answer, but its the best I can do.<br />You&#039;ll figure it out ;)

I remember some of it, but not all of it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yay, glad I could help!&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly experienced with most psychedelics, but ketamine is my specialty ;)&nbsp; It saddens me when I hear about people doing it all wrong for their introductory K experiences because they usually go on to talk about what a stupid drug it is.&nbsp; I can see how one would get that impression if they did it wrong, but if you do it right it can be an amazing and enriching life experience.<br /><br />as for not forgetting, hmmm... that can be tricky because so many parts of the k-hole are not compatible with &quot;real life&quot; reality.&nbsp; I know personally, that a lot of what has happened to me on K has been fleeting and I&#039;ve long since forgotten it in my day-to-day life.&nbsp; but here are a few comments I can make on this subject:&nbsp; <br />1)&nbsp; A lot of things you learn in a K hole are forgotten, but you remember them when you&#039;re in another K-hole.&nbsp; these experiences transcend time and space, so its only natural that you can&#039;t remember them when you are grounded in time and space.&nbsp; take comfort, though, in knowing that you&#039;ll remember the important stuff (like flying, fighting, conjuring, telepathy, etc.) when you NEED to remember it.&nbsp; Have faith in yourself and all that you need will be available to you when you need it.<br />2)&nbsp; when you realize something important, grab ahold of it as tight as you can!&nbsp; with a bit of experience, you will start to be able to tell what the important epiphanies are.&nbsp; For instance:&nbsp; I have battled depression for my whole life and it has affected my relationships greatly...in my current relationship I was focusing on the negative/difficult aspects so much that I had been thinking I should end it.&nbsp; but I went mental on a bag of K for a week and on day 5 i did a super mega line and saw my girlfriend as this loving butterfly, adding a bit of light to my dark and ugly outlook on life.&nbsp; I saw all the negative aspects as far less important than the love we shared and the beauty she holds and at that moment in the K hole i had the thought that I should marry her.&nbsp; so I held on to that realization and did just that :)&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember anything at all about the rest of that trip (and I know that it was epic) but I managed to carry that part back with me and it has proved invaluable!<br /><br />So sorry thats not really a straight answer, but its the best I can do.<br />You&#039;ll figure it out ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No mate, that sounds spot on. I guess I was just being a little naive... I really wanted to remember what went on. I remember some bits but can&#039;t put them in to words. Fuck, I didn&#039;t know the human mind could imagine all that! I&#039;ve been thinking about K non stop.<br /><br />You were right on your first post! The world I went to that day has made the &#039;real&#039; world look boring! Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t see this becoming habit forming (which I know it can be) but wow... it just proves that things aren&#039;t always the way they same. As you said, you see someone on K not moving you begin to worry if you&#039;ve never experienced it. You don&#039;t know that in actual fact, they&#039;re in their own magical world.<br /><br />I remember when I was told a K hole was when you had &#039;too&#039; much K. Too much? No... just enough&nbsp; ;)

Well in order to answer your question, I&#039;ll give you a brief idea what drone is like.<br /><br />It is similar to MDMA in some ways, appreciation of music, empathy and euphoria. However the empathy isn&#039;t like&nbsp; MDMA&#039;s, with MDMA as you know, you really feel closer to others. With drone it&#039;s more a sense of &#039;Wow, they&#039;re amazing&#039; rather than feeling loving and peaceful towards them. It&#039;s also A LOT more stimulating... more &#039;rushy&#039; as well... very speedy and euphoric. You feel a great need to chat and chat and chat, a little like speed. IMO the &#039;euphoria&#039; from drone is more intense than MDMA&#039;s, however it lacks the magic and beautiful sense of euphoria MDMA has.<br /><br />It can be quite fiendish - However taking it orally makes it less fiendish. The reason its fiendish is because unlike with MDMA, once your peak is over, re-dosing works! You feel the exact same effects again. You can re-dose quite a number of times without losing the peak effects.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never done the MDMA + K combo, I&#039;ve only done K once remember and that was with drone.<br /><br />The combo is very nice - I parachuted the drone and about an hour an a half later did a bump of K. And because the drone was in my system it added a nice euphoric uplifting edge to the K and also still retained the appreciation of music.<br /><br />I got my drone from dmtdoodeelsd, however I placed an order with googleyed today and his drone is meant to be top-notch.<br /><br />The dosage I&#039;d advise for drone for a first timer is 200mgs parachuted. Or 80 mgs if snorted. NEVER parachute more than 300mgs, it may over-stimulate you a little... you don&#039;t want to ruin a good time with over-stimulation. <br /><br />Sollem

				word, thanks for the advice :)<br /><br />I have some wicked allergies lately so I&#039;ve been taking a dose of MDMA on the nights when I want to do ketamine, but this seems like a waste of the &quot;magic&quot; that comes with MDMA.&nbsp; I just want something that opens up my sinuses and puts me in a nice euphoric spot where I can sniff some K and not spend the whole trip sneezing.<br /><br /><br /><br />update:&nbsp; <br />oy, just did some reading on this drug...i think as a recovering speed addict I&#039;ll have to pass.<br />glad you&#039;re having fun with it tho!

				I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m to judge what Ketamine&#039;s like, but I just took it and it felt pretty fucking weird. Maybe it&#039;s just me the one I&#039;m weird, I have no idea. But yeah, I&#039;m still trying to process myself what I&#039;ve been going through right now, since I&#039;ve been taking a few lines the last few hours always getting bigger and kinda lost the sense for time... However after the last line the effects kicked in pretty fast, and I felt very dizzy and numb so I laid myself down in bed. I could still feel my body, but at the same time looking down at my body looked very weird and kind of foreign. I don&#039;t even remember what I thought about the whole damn time... In fact I can&#039;t remember anything really or only partially, even though I didn&#039;t take a lot. I could even move and walk. It was &quot;S-Isomer&quot; Ketamine if that matters in any case...
