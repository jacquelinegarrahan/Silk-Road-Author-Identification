				I have been doing a lot of reading on the net trying to figure out the best method.&nbsp; &nbsp;so far what i have gathered is that you need to use a spirit with high alc %.&nbsp; water will not work.&nbsp; im just having problems figuring out the math a got a mg scale and am looking to make a vial with a dropper and for each drop it would contain 1mg of Alprazolam.&nbsp; Wondering if anyone here would have some measurements and words of wisdom to help me with this? :P

				A drop is not an accurate unit of measurement - depending on the liquid and the dropper, the volume per drop can change.&nbsp; I would suggest getting a 1cc syringe and dissolving the alprazolam to something like 2mg / ml.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are insistent on using the drop method, you need to figure out how many drops are in a ml.&nbsp; It&#039;s generally around 20 drops / ml, but IT VARIES.&nbsp; You can do this one of several ways - 1 ml of water weighs exactly one gram.&nbsp; So if you have a mg scale, drop out drops until the scale reads 1 gram, and count how many drops that was.&nbsp; Alternatively, use a 1cc syringe and count how many drops there are in a ml.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say you get 20 drops / ml.&nbsp; This means that you would want to get 20mg of alprazolam per ml of solution (or 0.05 ml / mg).&nbsp; So measure out 1 gram of alprazolam, put it in a graduated cylinder, and fill the cylinder to 50ml (0.05 ml / mg x 1000mg = 50ml).&nbsp; Make sure you fill the cylinder AFTER the powder is added, or else the volume might change.&nbsp; Voila! A solution where every drop contains 1 mg of alprazolam.&nbsp;

				you may be able to use propylene glycol and/or polyethylene glycol (not ethylene glycol though which I am pretty sure is antifreeze and not the same!) :P<br /><br />evidently you may be able to get enough into water by adding drops of ethanol and propylene glycol until the alprazolam dissolves<br /><br />alternatively you could use DMSO in which it is highly soluble, and has a low toxicity. you could even dose through your skin which is crazy! (I think, double check please)<br /><br />be safe<br />- miR

				easy dosage<br /><br />this is my plan<br />there is 20 drops in a ml<br />20mg Alprazolam diluted per ml of everclear<br />getting 250mg of Alprazolam<br /><br />250/20=12.5ml everclear<br /><br />12.5*2=25 ml of everclear with 250 mg of Alprazolam<br /><br />.5 mg per drop.

				Rise_against it allows you to measure higher weight cuz the sensitivity of the scales ppl have typically aren&#039;t reliable for single digit mg doses<br /><br />Eg. your scale can weigh 250mg accurately (or so you hope)<br /><br />If you put that 250mg into 10ml of ethanol/propylene glycol you know the liquid has 25mg/ml (250mg/10mg reduced is 25mg/ml if that helps understand).&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to measure out volumes, especially if you consider a drop to be 1/20th of a ml.&nbsp; In this case 1 drop of that concentration would be 25mg/ml / 20 = 1.25mg per drop.<br /><br />I should write the &#039;equation&#039; simpler so that you know how much liquid to add to get whatever mg per drop, I want 2mg per drop:<br />250mg = 2mg<br />&nbsp; x ml&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1/20)ml<br /><br />Pretend there&#039;s a division line under the 250mg and 2mg cuz i&#039;m too lame to figure out how to underline and format the shit correctly<br /><br />I went to a few stores today trying to see if i could get some PG ordered but they were all quite adamant about not selling it to non-pharmaceutical parties.&nbsp; Interesting ... and frustating
