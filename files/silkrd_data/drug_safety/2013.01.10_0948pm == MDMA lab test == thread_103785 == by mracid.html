				I would like to find out the purity of the MDMA im selling.. I know that it is good quality, but i really want to know how good.<br /><br />Does anyone know how I could get it tested? Or maybe someone on SR who could test for some coin..<br /><br />

				Where are you located?<br /><br />I know a guy who knows a guy and stuff and stuff. Send a pm if you&#039;re still looking for purity test. Keep in mind that it will take a while for you to have results (first shipment to person, then from person to lab, then lab needing their time).<br /><br />

				Or...<br /><br />Just pop it in a capsule and send it off to clearnet http://www.ecstasydata.org/ with $150 and I think they let you know exactly what&#039;s in there. Never done it before but they seem to be the goto place for MDMA testing.

				Yeah it&#039;s pretty expensive but it&#039;s kind of the gold standard for testing. They actually only charge $40 for pressed pills which is nice because it lets people figure out what the heck they are taking. The $150 is their random powder in a cap price and lets you put any old drug in a cap and find out what is inside the powder. They have to operate under DEA restrictions which means they can&#039;t tell you how much or how potent the chemical is, just what chemicals are in their and in what proportions. Not a perfect system but for example the Nintendos put up by TheHeineken just got tested and it&#039;s nice to know they only have MDMA as their active component vs. some other crap me and my GF probably wouldn&#039;t want to take. <br /><br />

				Get a testing kit.<br /><br />It&#039;s not going to give you % of purity, but it will give you a rough estimate of how pure the product is by the reaction.<br /><br />I can&#039;t really think of why you would want to know the exact purity unless you made a batch yourself and were curious as to how well you did. <br /><br /><br />(EDIT: Just read that you are selling it - yeah you should have it tested if you don&#039;t want to hurt anyone.)

				What kind of testing kit are you referring to Slicksuit?<br />The usual tests you can do yourself will tell you 0% about purity. Only if it is mdma or not. Quickness of reaction still does not tell you anything about it&#039;s purity.<br /><br />&quot;I can&#039;t really think of why you would want to know the exact purity unless you made a batch yourself and were curious as to how well you did. &quot;<br /><br />This sounds unbelievable. It&#039;s really fucked up that a lot of vendors just put a number somewhere around 82 just to sell it.<br />As a vendor it&#039;s good to know what you are actually giving to people and not just make up some nice sounding number just because you like that. It&#039;s fucked up that vendor&#039;s just put &quot;LAB TESTED&quot; in their listings. How would you like it if a new brand of beer came out and the people selling it just make up that there is 6% alcohol in it, while in fact there is5% in it and 1% of some poisonous substance?<br /><br /><br />

				ROFL<br /><br />Put some sugar or salt in powders.. <br /><br />I agree with Virmo.<br />It is pretty stupid to say that vendors do not have to test their own drugs and just put any nunber of purity in their listings.<br />Or ship neds that expired in 1980 or something, doesn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />I read the topic about small fish are not welcome on SR. They should not be on SR.<br /><br />So now it has become not only:<br />Overprice your products a lot to be a big fish, and it doesnt matter if you have no clue about what you are selling regarding which materials are used. Put some sand in plastic baggies and list it as 75% pure mdma. If it doesn&#039;t have an effect, blame the customer for it.<br /><br />I am speechless.<br /><br />I think it would make more sense to only be able to ship something if you can prove that it is what you say it is than to just ship something of which you have no clue what it really is.<br /><br />I think it is reall good to have your product tested.<br /><br />Haha, take some dog shit, buy really cheap hash and grnd it, s[rinkle i t over the shit, vacuum seal it and then advertise that it is the best on SR. <br /><br />Vendors like virmo get flamed by vendors like limitless who simply rob people of their money

				Offer a free sample to someone in Holland. Or if you want DIY you could do a wash on some of your product and see how much is lost (search this forum), that won&#039;t be a perfect process but you will get an idea.
