				Hi,<br /><br />I was hoping someone could kindly recommend somewhere I can purchase reasonably cheap but reliable milligram scales in Australia.&nbsp; Does not have to be from in Australia obviously but somewhere reliable as long as it arrives here okay.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really want to use ebay or paypal to purchase.<br /><br />Thanks<br />BL<br />

				Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; I will check out the deal extreme site soon.&nbsp; Someone else recommended them to me once ages ago but I was not sure if they were legit, etc.<br /><br />Pine, I am not aware of scales being tracked - that was not the issue about not using ebay.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t use my ebay/paypal account anymore as I think I owed a couple of dollars or something on it so never went back lol.&nbsp; It was a pain to keep going for me for some reason.<br /><br />

The government has done some pretty Stazi-like stuff in the past, so it wasn&#039;t a crazy question either. For example, since 2001 or so, the secret service were apparently asking laser printer companies to print yellow microdots onto each and every piece of paper printed. It sounds incredible, but it also happens to be true, you can check it out for yourself if you have a laser printer, a UV light, good eyesight and decode the microdots into a timestamp, printer type and vendor information. The EFF has a series of articles on the subject. Apparently it was to &#039;prevent counterfeiting&#039;, which is such a load of horseshit it&#039;s unreal, you&#039;d only catch a bunch of amateurs scanning and printing on their home machines that way. If you look at the list of printer companies that modifies their machines to print those tracking dots, it was pretty much every single one you&#039;ve ever heard of.<br /><br />Anyway, tracking milligram scales seems like a similarly over the top move. Wouldn&#039;t put it past them for a second either.

It sounds like the most retarded conspiracy theory, but unfortunately it&#039;s true, I&#039;ve seen it for myself on a test laser jet and a blacklight. I couldn&#039;t believe it myself. Yeah, you got to stop counterfeiters so you track *every piece of fucking A4 paper in the world*. Wat.<br /><br />I use a special printing technology for things like address labels because of this. Alternatively, I recommend you buy an old 2nd hand printer.

				I know you said no ebay, but I got mine on ebay. Small pocket size mg scale seems to work well enough, comes with weights to calibrate, was about $30. Don&#039;t buy from anywhere in Aus or you will get inflated prices, buy from OS.

				I got one for like $12 on eBay. It&#039;s accurate to 0.01. There are a ton of legitimate applications for scales, trying to make it anonymous is fairly pointless. If it gets to the point where your house gets searched by LE, if they find a scale, they&#039;ll probably try and get you for intention to distribute. Doesn&#039;t matter where you got it from lol.

LE can swab your scales and find the most ridiculously tiny traces of substances. Explaining to them you don&#039;t use it for drugs is going to be kinda hard if it comes to that.

				Ozzybattla doesn&#039;t that seem a little... too cheap? If somebody was going to be weighing out drugs that have a steep dose response curve, a few milligrams could mean the difference between a good trip and an overdose...

				People no need to be paranoid about everything, scales this accurate are required for many things:<br /><br />I bought mine for weighing all the diamonds I was buying, dont wont to be ripped of by a jeweler. :-*<br /><br />They also can be used for weighing medicines, for components of electronics, and the evil doctor no for weighing out his bio-chemical weapons to kill us all.<br /><br />I bought a set for $10 in the markets, have tested against standard weights and about 5% out, not great, but gives me some idea of how much I am getting, if I ever feel like weighing it.
