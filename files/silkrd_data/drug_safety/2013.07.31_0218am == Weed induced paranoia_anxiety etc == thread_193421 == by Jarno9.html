				What are your experiences with this phenomenon? When I first started smoking weed it wasn&#039;t much of a problem for me. I got a bit paranoid that sketchy looking dudes were gonna start shit with me on the street (I&#039;d guess at least 90% of people who smoke weed know what I&#039;m talking about) which still happens to me now, and would think everyone could tell that I was high.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t until I&#039;d been smoking for several months that I started feeling extremely anxious and shit. Would regularly manage to convince myself none of my friends actually liked me and that I was a complete fuck up and stuff like that. It also used to cause me to think I was acting weird and awkward in social situations, therefore acting way more introverted than I actually am. Again I&#039;m sure a lot of you are familiar with this. I have no idea why I kept smoking then - probably because it still made TV/video games/whatever more interesting.<br /><br />Than about a year ago that all stopped pretty quickly and hasn&#039;t come back. I have no idea what caused this. Weed still causes me to get those thoughts occasionally but now I know it&#039;s just because I&#039;m stoned and can easily ignore it. So, that&#039;s my life story, share yours?

				I&#039;ve tried pure sativas, indicas, and hybrids and seem to get paranoia with all of them.<br /><br />Indica paranoia is more of a &#039;I feel like something bad is about to happen,&#039; for me, whereas Sativa paranoia manifests itself as either &#039;the cops are after me,&#039; &#039;I&#039;m going to forget what time is and be fucked up forever,&#039; or both.<br /><br />Every time I smoke or have some edibles I get the same paranoia, and don&#039;t wish to purchase more. A month later, I&#039;ll forget all about my bad experience and give it another try- and hate it again. I guess I just really want to make weed work as it&#039;s a classic, plus &#039;Mary, Molly and Lucy,&#039; rolls off the tongue quite well.<br /><br />I will say that I did have some blackberry kush off the road (forgot the vendor, sorry ;[ ) that didn&#039;t induce any paranoia in me. Nothing but giggles and eating entire family size bags of potato chips, which I don&#039;t even eat sober.

				I get this sometimes. In fact I just had one the other day. Its like a short anxiety/panic attack. I don&#039;t think its related to any particular strain or anything. Probably more related to my brain chemistry at the time. <br /><br />It helps if I recognize its happening. Then I can just breathe and wait for it to pass. And it always does :)

				I wrote this in another thread (similar to this) but will quote it also here:<br /><br />People should understand that cannabis IS a psychedelic and if someone doesn&#039;t believe this they just have to use it with a more powerful ROA than smoking (as for example oral, anal or either through the skin) and as such turning it into a recreational drug can naturally cause problems on the long run.<br /><br />Psychedelics AREN&#039;T used to have fun. If you search fun sooner or later you will have to face the reality that psychedelics aren&#039;t fun at all, and on the contrary they are made to test an challenge yourself, they represent the SATAN (Shaitan, adversary) as in the Book of Job, bringing to initiation through tests. You don&#039;t use psychedelics to have fun but for the experience in its totality, with yes, also the &quot;bad moments of suffering&quot; etc. etc. because they are almost more important than the &quot;good times&quot;.<br /><br />Naturally this can also not happen for various motives, but, especially if you are predisposed naturally to have more &quot;mystical depth&quot; in yourself (either you understanding it or not) then it will happen. Anxiety is a psychological crisis coming from the impossibility of the ego to accept a change, of whatever nature, and the way the anxiety manifests externally (as in &quot;thinking of going insane&quot; or &quot;thinking of dying&quot; etc. etc. depends on the type of change the ego cannot accept). Everytime you use the substance and that &quot;change&quot; presents itself so the anxiety will. If the change is strong enough (or you fight it too much), then, the anxiety will not go away even when sober and it will take a while to subside.

				I have been smoking regularly for a couple years now.&nbsp; Usually just one or two hits before bed to relax me and ease the transition into sleep since I&#039;m naturally a night owl.&nbsp; Every now and then I&#039;ll get together with some mates and we&#039;ll smoke while watching the telly or something.&nbsp; I&#039;d get the classic &quot;oh shit the neighbors are going to smell this weed and call the cops&quot; paranoia but it wasn&#039;t until I bought an edible off the road that I truly had my first experience with paranoia and anxiety while high.<br /><br />I bought a brownie from a vendor here and on the label it strongly recommended only eating a 1/4 of the brownie if you don&#039;t have much of a tolerance so that&#039;s what I did.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t smoke or anything else that night but I got much higher than I&#039;d ever been before.&nbsp; Way higher than I ever wanted to be.&nbsp; I remember getting home to my flat and trying to find ways to &#039;sober up&#039; because I was so done being high.&nbsp; Once I realized I was &#039;stuck&#039; I started panicking and then the anxiety really stepped up.&nbsp; It was a long night and when I woke up the next day I still felt high.&nbsp; It was crazy.&nbsp; The whole day I had anxiety and kept thinking I fucked my body up somehow being that high.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t touch weed for six weeks after that.&nbsp; Even now I&#039;m just back to my one or two hits before bed rotation and don&#039;t smoke socially at all.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably never touch another edible.&nbsp; I never realized they could affect you for that long.&nbsp; Thank god I didn&#039;t eat the whole damn brownie.&nbsp; I probably would&#039;ve keeled over.

				OP: can tell you that I can fully relate in literally every aspect of what you just wrote. I guess the issue started as a result of smoking alone while playing videogames too often. But hey, why else does one go to college :)? I don&#039;t know about you but it became a standard that, every time I smoked alone (which was pretty much any night that I wasn&#039;t with friends or out), if I wasn&#039;t busy doing something, I would have &#039;negative&#039; thoughts. For any reason whatsoever. It still happens. And I guess after a long time bashing my brain with these thoughts, it eventually convinced and reprogrammed itself to believe and feel these things were true.<br /><br />The brain is way too powerful.
