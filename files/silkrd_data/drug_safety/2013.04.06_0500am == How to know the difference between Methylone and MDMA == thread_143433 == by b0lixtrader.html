				Just wanted some tips on knowing what the difference between M1 and MDMA from other experienced rollers.<br /><br />From my experience methylone could look exactly like molly crystals but also could be pure white in color and very crystalline.<br /><br />I noticed that methylone you peak somewhat quicker but the peak lasts much shorter and is not as intense as molly mg vs mg.&nbsp; Also noticed that re-dosing doesn&#039;t do as much compared to molly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Am I right at all about any of this or am I cray?<br /><br />lol

				My experiences with the two have been about the same as yours, faster (sometimes much faster) come up, shorter peak, redosing becomes useless after the two hour mark or so. I would also say that M1 is more stimulating and speedy, but doesn&#039;t have the same intensity of body euphoria. <br /><br />MDMA also has a slight visual component that I don&#039;t get at comparable doses of M1. There&#039;s a brightening and deepening of color with MDMA, whereas to reach that point with M1, I have to take an uncomfortably high dose (close to 300mg).

				Yup pretty much on point brotha.<br /><br />Definitely seems more speedy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done some more research and if I remember correctly I think it&#039;s only about 60% of the potency of molly mg vs mg.<br /><br />But it&#039;s still a total different drug, it&#039;s just not nearly as good as molly.&nbsp; Molly is so loved because it&#039;s steady progression and characteristics are one of the best enjoyable mind and body gasms.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tasted or smelled methylone, since I had them capped all the time.&nbsp; Does it taste or smell anything like molly?

				I find M1 far speedier than molly, I can dance like a demon on it, but then a pumpkin always turns up about T+4h and my legs just give up completely.<br /><br />It&#039;s not over exertion either. Taking M1 at home, I find my joints are stiff the next day. The only downside to an otherwise nice substance.

				Not for me. M1 is definitely unique in that regard, no amphetamine based substance has ever given me anything like that level of discomfort. Like somebody&#039;s over-tightened all my bolts.

				Honestly speed or speed like drugs don&#039;t always make me sore but for many other people it does.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing some people&#039;s bodies just respond in a way it causes joints to dry up and some have muscle soreness from being constantly being tense.&nbsp; Everyone is different so yeah always different results.

				Get a test kit.. <br /><br />M1 / Bk-MDMA / Methylone is Yellow on the Marquis test<br /><br />MDMA is Purple Black colored<br /><br />Go visit Dance Safe.. Its cheap and could save your life.. If you can&#039;t afford one and or are too cheap to buy one you have no business taking any substance&nbsp;

				I find it easy to tell the two apart, possibly because I am an anxiety sufferer. On MDMA I am just smashed by waves of euphoria and I don&#039;t even really notice the people around me, and if I do it&#039;s almost always a positive interaction. On Methylone I still feel fucked up, but not euphoric in the same way and therefore I am very aware of who is around me and often feel paranoid that they are staring at me or sending me bad vibes, much as I would when sober. It was a striking difference the last time I took M1 at a rave and was separated from my crew, on MDMA it would have been a breeze prancing around the party until I found them, but it was much more difficult for me on Methylone and I was quite relieved when I finally saw a familiar face.

				If you meant the feel of the two, its night and day.. once youve done pure MDMA anyway.<br /><br />As for the look of the two, i assume your leaning more towards being able to tell &#039;moon rock&#039; Methylone from rocked MDMA. The large rocked methylone, almost always seems to be a bit more yellowish tan, also a bit crack rock like, cloudy when ever ive seen it. It also seems to always have a distinct smell to it, like handsoap, or faintly like bananas. <br /><br />The smell of MDMA is unmistakeable once you know it. Black liquorice almost, sassy smell. Much love.

				Yeah I was just trying to get as many tips in finding the difference.<br /><br />Now I know what rocked methylone should smell like.&nbsp; MDMA smell I definitely know.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel of the two I know for sure now.&nbsp; I did not enjoy methylone at all.<br /><br />Thanks
