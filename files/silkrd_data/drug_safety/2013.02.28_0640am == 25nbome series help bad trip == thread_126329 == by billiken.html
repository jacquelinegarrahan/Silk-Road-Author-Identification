				My friend took 3/4 of a tab and another friend and myself took 1 tab and a half. <br /><br />But the guy who took less is having such a bad trip, short time memory loss, he doesnt know where he is,&nbsp; he says he feels bad and stays there quiet and shaking. Is it only a bad trip or he is completly fucked up? I cant just let him go like thathe has to go to court in 3 days, he cant just go out right now and be like this, it woudl be really bad for him.<br /><br />SOrry if im not making much sense but im tripping hard, but im really worried about him...<br /><br />He has done 25nbome before and higher doses , same with lsd and dmt, but for the last month he has been almost clean of drugs, he only smoked 2 days ago and he hasnt tripped on anything since a month ago.<br /><br />Someone help me

				An antipsychotic would kill the trip. Else a benzo would take the edge off, at least calm him down. <br /><br />Make sure he&#039;s comfortable and hydrated. See if he&#039;ll eat anything. You might try getting some fresh air. <br /><br />Other than that, he&#039;s just going to have to ride it out. Do you have anyone sober you can call to keep an eye on him and make rational decisions for you? He should be watched until he comes down.

				we re taking care of him , he is laying on the couch and watching tv, he remembers some shit but then forgets who he is, doesnt know who iam or where he is, its not like he freaks out, he is just lost...<br /><br />Im worried if will be back to normal once he sleeps, or if this is gonna be him forever<br /><br />I only have 3mg of melatonin will it do anything?<br /><br /><br />When we first started tripping he was having such a great time , we were all laughing and shit then he took my beats and went to the bedroom and stayed there for a long while, after that he came and was mentally fried like he is now. Im just praying and hoping he gets back to normal

				hey, most most most probably it will just end in a comparably short amount of time (or did so already know..)!<br /><br />maybe hesistate with melatonine or anything ur not sure of what it does. a benzo certainly can help, but staying it out will mostly as well bring you to the point that some good hours later everything should be back to baseline more or less. <br /><br /><br />good luck! heads up!&nbsp; and always remember: &#039;its just the hallucinogen!&#039; (and these tend to go away.. just take care of proper care afterwards, depending on how much impact the experience leaves once calmed down).<br /><br />again, good luck guys, heads up, most probably u&#039;re fine now or will be soonish ;D

That stuff can be uncomfortable and maybe he just got an unevenly strong hit? I think he&#039;ll be ok just as soon as he sleeps and has some food and rehydrates and stuff. A benzo would have helped him to start the resting stage. I hope he&#039;s still sleeping lol.

				I want to let everybody know that he is fine now, 3 hours after i made this post he came back. He told us that after he put the beats on he thought he had fallen asleep while he was listening to music, and that when he woke up he was in some kind of lucid or vivid dream, he remembers some stuff from the trip from when he was lost and all fucked up but he has vague memories from the trip.<br /><br />He didnt have to go to sleep to come back, i guess that as we all were coming down from the trip he started to feel better. I doubt i will ever get high with him again lol, he kind of gave me a bad trip xD<br /><br />thanks everyne for your replies

				A lot of times those bad trips end up just being a result of taking the drug in a bad mindset. If he was scared going in (which I bet he was taking so much less than the rest of you) he was probably all ready to have a hard roll. It&#039;s hard to talk someone out of it but if you ever get into that boat again just make sure anyone taking the stuff feels comfortable taking the stuff and if things start to turn often times just changing the setting can help a lot. Go outside and look at the stars. Turn on a fan and watch it spin. It&#039;s not always possible to pull someone out and sometimes the bad trips are the best but most people would never sign up for one if they could avoid it.<br /><br />Glad he&#039;s all set now though! Good vibes to you all.

				The OP actually reminded me of an acid trip I had several months back (yes, truly verified and reagent tested LSD). There was a point where I was saying things but the meanings of each word slipped my mind as soon as I said them and I was left to wonder what I said actually meant and why it had any meaning to me. I kept forgetting where I was and what the day was all about, asking about people who weren&#039;t there as if I were expecting them. At one point, my entire life was slipping from me (memories). I started to fear that I was suffering from permanent short-term memory loss and that I was really in a hospital bed reliving just a few moments of the trip that day while everyone in my life mourned over me. <br /><br />Anyway, not saying LSD is bad, just that it can happen on any drug as DiamondSky noted. <br /><br />In any case, 2c-b and 2c-i are much nicer than 25i which is probably what you guys took. I enjoy my stock of 25b and 25d when I want a fun and sociable ride though those seem to be very rare around here. <br />

				This reminds me of something most people forget. When you&#039;re helping someone through a bad experience. Remember to talk them &quot;through&quot; it. Don&#039;t talk them &quot;down&quot; or &quot;out&quot; of it. Reminding them that it will end eventually is good and try not to focus on time. <br /><br />Don&#039;t appear as you&#039;re trying to abort a trip. Appear as you&#039;re attempting to comfort the person so they can enjoy or at least enjoy the &quot;intensity&quot; of the trip. Another tip is don&#039;t tell them they are ok unless they ask. Tell them everything is ok if they become paniced. If they are not focused on them self health wise. When you state that they are ok. They may begin to observe their self more closely which could lead to them hyper focused on their breathing. Then, this could cause more anxiety and possible lead to them hyperventilating and passing out.<br /><br />&nbsp;Don&#039;t make them feel singled out. (Especially if it&#039;s in a setting where a group of people are tripping.) The last thing you want is them getting more anxious or even paranoid because everyone is looking at them. <br /><br />Last thing you need is music! Have you ever heard the music stop at the club? (if it did you&#039;re at a shitty club.) There&#039;s a reason why they keep the music going non stop. It&#039;s because it&#039;s part of the atmosphere. (Setting.) A popular coping mechanic is comparing your setting prior to your intoxication. (Does this place look, feel, smell, or feel the same as it did before i got high?) The music doesn&#039;t have to be blasting. It can be barely audible and that&#039;s still fine. There just has to be something in the background since hallucinations play off absence of sound. <br /><br />Tips for tripping harder. <br />Block off all sound (Ear plugs.) and cover your eyes with something that doesn&#039;t allow light in. (If it&#039;s night time you can simply go into a room that is pitch dark.) Enjoy. :D
