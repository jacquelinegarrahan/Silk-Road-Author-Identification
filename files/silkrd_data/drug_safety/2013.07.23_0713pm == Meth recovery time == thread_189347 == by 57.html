				Six days ago I used a small amount of Meth (250mg), and then a few benzos to get some sleep about 12 hours later.&nbsp; This put my schedule out of wack.&nbsp; I&#039;m still tired and a bit out of it.&nbsp; Is this standard for the occasional user?&nbsp; Does it really take an entire week to get back to normal?

				if you only did it that one night, you shouldn&#039;t need more than a day or two to recover.&nbsp; If you&#039;re finding your energy levels are low you might just be sick, or possibly if your sleep schedule is out of whack that could be the culprit.<br /><br />Or maybe meth just fucks with you more than others.

				I don&#039;t respond well to most stimulants, first and last time I tried meth I smoked a gram over 4 days and was awake a total of 6 days. <br />For my body to feel 100% again it took 2 weeks but I felt okay 3 days after I had slept. <br /><br />-Meth Not Even Once-

				um, 250mg&#039;s is &#039;small&#039;?&nbsp; I take more than 50mgs and I can&#039;t sleep that night.&nbsp; 250mgs sounds like a HUGE whack of the stuff?&nbsp; I think that&#039;s your problem.<br /><br />You might want to read this.&nbsp; 10mgs for a week type thing, then up to 50mgs type thing... you get more out of it.<br /><br />Safe Methamphetamine Dosage/Usage.

				So I feel back to baseline now, it took a total of 7 days.&nbsp; I must have caught a flu or something, because it has never taken me this long to recover.&nbsp; During this downtime I continued my rigorous exercise regiment because I thought my feeling ill was due to the recent meth usage, but now that I look back it was probably a bug and the exercise may have been detrimental.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for everyone&#039;s responses.
