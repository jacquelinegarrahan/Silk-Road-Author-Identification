				I tried and failed in my attempt to crush and snort an original Oxycontin, the one&#039;s labled OC and not OP.<br />I took 1 pick, smashed it up with a hammer in a ziplock bag and then even used a razor blade to try and get the powder finer. I picked out as many green bits as I could.<br />Then, I lined it up and used a straw to snot, but all it did was burn, I had a real bitter taste in my mouth and long story short, wound up wasting a perfect good Oxy<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that I did many thing incorrectly.<br />If anyone could let me know what I did wrong and also what steps I should take next time to avoid wasting another one.<br />I would really appreciate any help from people who have successfully snorted Oxy&#039;s before.<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone who helps!

				I know there&#039;s a quicker way then what I do but old habits die hard: <br /><br />I get the med, place it into my mouth, swish it around making sure I&#039;m rubbing tongue off the tablet, thus cleaning the 12 hour release coating off,<br />I spit the removed contents in the toilet/sink, rise mouth and quickly rise the med, I have a 10 by 8 inch glass door panel I kept specially for my treats when we threw an old door out, <br />I get a teaspoon, use the back to crush med&#039;s on this panel, get it to fine particles, use a blade to chop up, and I love the part, just chop chop away until I&#039;m happy,<br />Like you, I use straws cut to a short but nice size: then snort away, happy in a few mins<br /><br />Hope this is of help<br />Oh and I do remember when 1st tried it, all those years ago, it did sting or burn, but by say 3rd med&#039;s I was used to it,<br />plus its a painkiller so it&#039;ll kill that uncomfortable feeling it can initially cause once your doing it right and it kicks in ;)<br /><br />Good luck and never do it 2 many times or days in a row, not a nice habit to have<br />and always read everything about anything yr goner stick in your body&nbsp; :)<br />Have fun&nbsp; :)

				well an OC 20 has a coating on it so 1st thing I would do is put it in my mouth for a few seconds then take it out and use a peice of cloth, sometimes I use my shirt that I&#039;m wearing and wipe the coating off the pill. After I get it clean, it should look white or an off white color. Crush it the best way you can. I like to use&nbsp; a make shift grinder made from a radiator hose clamp bought new at an auto parts place or walmart. I just unscrew the screw and take some tin snips and cut the screw part off then use a hammer and beat the rest of it straight against a hard surface maybe a cinder block or some concrete. An anvil is idea. Wash it off and make sure its clean and dry. Cut it to the desired length. Now you got a new pill grinder<br /><br />Get you a flat plate and grab the cleaned OC 20 with your thumb and your index finger and rub it against the proper side of your grinder. You will know which side to use because one side does not do to good but the other side will grind the pill into a fine powder depending on how much pressure you apply. Hold the make shift grinder firm with your other hand<br /><br />Ultimately you can just use an old debit card and crush your OC but always remove the coating. I think the 10mg OC&#039;s have no coating but the rest do. OC&#039;s don&#039;t really burn that bad but if you snort the coating it may cause a headache

				Thank you both for the advice, I did not take the coating off, that was probably my problem<br />I have the OC 80&#039;s, btw.<br />Also, is there any particular style of snorting? When I first tried, it was too weak and I may have overcompensated and snorted too hard? Is that possible?<br /><br />I do not have anything more than a couple different types of hammers, razor blades and knives. Oh and I have a coffee grinder, I don&#039;t know if that would do the trick?<br /><br />Thanks again for all the advice!!!<br /><br />
