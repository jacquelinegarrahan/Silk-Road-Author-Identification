				I start this forum page as a complement to the micro-dosing forum page<br />(the link to that page is: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173822.0&nbsp; &nbsp;- if you haven&#039;t done it yet, do pay us a visit there!)<br /><br />I believe that meditation and the use of psychedelics go hand in hand, <br />whether you&#039;re taking 1 heroic dose of LSD in your lifetime, or using ketamine every few days, whether you snort 2C-B every month or go to the dessert to eat San Pedro on your yearly vacation - a regular practice of meditation will highly enhance your capabilities to handle the experience, to learn from it and to implement the lessons learned in your daily life. <br /><br />I start this topic hoping that some of us would be willing to share their idea&#039;s and their experiences about it. <br />Maybe you can even recommend some specific meditation technique/practice, or special food/drinks to combine with it, or... <br /><br />Maybe you could discuss some insights you&#039;ve had while meditating on psychedelics, some questions that rose up in your consciousness, some images that often comes to you during your voyages, ... <br /><br />In short, I hope this thread could become a place to exchange as much possible information on the combination of the practice of meditation and the practice of psychedelic exploration...

				I had a discussion about this in private with&nbsp; Great Green Arkleseizure.<br />IMO the best meditation method you can learn is Raja-Yoga since it is the most direct and it has the most important benefits. Concentration is the key of every practice, be it Astral Projection, Ritual Magick, Sex Magick - you name it. <br /><br />In reality real meditation starts only when you achieve Dhyana, contemplation, i.e. the merging of the subject to the object of attention focus (in practice this means that if for example you concentrate on your hand, your consciousness transfers in the hand, you become the hand, the part you call &quot;I&quot; fully merge with the hand). The steps before this point are just the external shell of meditation (even if they get erroneously called as such by people) but they are not that.<br /><br />Two clearnet sites about Raja-Yoga:<br />http://shardsofconsciousness.com/user/sites/shardsofconsciousness.com/files/ebooks/RajaYoga_Vivekananda.pdf<br />http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/aba1.htm<br /><br />Psychedelics already helps you on stilling your chattering by divding your thought process (many people get sometimes trapped in the so-called &quot;loops&quot; that it&#039;s just the incapability of the mind to fully still the thought process while it is dividing up; you try to recover the thought process so it starts again and again). If you can learn to fully still your thoughts and merge completely in the experience as in Dhyana and contemplate you will go directly to Samadhi (since a psychedelic - the stronger the better, DMT is perfect for this - already removes the ego part from the equation, a thing that usually blocks you in Dhyana to enter fully Samadhi).

				Personally I&#039;m very happy with the results I get from a combination of active-meditation and passive-meditation, in my case it&#039;s taichi/qigong and transcendental meditation... <br />I find the combined effect wonderfull, especially if you (sometimes, not all the time) combine those disciplines with psychedelic substances such as LSD... <br /><br />As always, I loved reading your response to this, BlackIris - thank you for it... <br />maybe, once, if life wants it, our paths will cross IRL... <br />we&#039;ll never know who we are (here), but I&#039;m sure we&#039;d have a blast of a time!

				I also practice both passive and active meditation. Sadly I can&#039;t really say too much about the active meditation I practice, as I will be giving away too much information about myself on this public forum&nbsp; :&#039;( . However, I will say that I find it very beneficial. I am able to achieve the feeling athletes describe as &quot;being in the zone&quot; with active meditation. Its a feeling that you are just a medium conducting the vibrations (and will) of the cosmos, and it brings me a sense of one-ness with the world. I am able to shed my notition of being an individual, and instead, I can enjoy and appreciate being a part of something much bigger that myself.<br /><br />I find that psychedelics and meditation go hand in hand. They are great tools with which to unravel the mysteries of the universe. However, its really important to do the work (i.e. meditation) on the path to enlightenment. Just taking drugs and not doing the work is a shortcut, and it wont bring you true enlightenment. But if you are putting in the work, I think psychedelics can offer many benefits on this amazing journey. <br /><br />Peace and love, my psychedelic adventurers!<br />;D

				I practice Vipassana Meditation and I&#039;ve had the most profound session on LSD once. <br /><br />However, meditating on drugs is cheating as the aim of meditation is to be able to calm the mind with the only help of your breathing and focus. Sure you can get far out there while meditating on LSD but it&#039;s not really gonna bring you to enlightenment imo. <br /><br /><br /><br />

We can &quot;grasp&quot; the meaning of infinity when we think about a line that has no beginning and no ending, or when we think about a sun radiating in all directions into eternity, but those representations don&#039;t allow any &quot;corners&quot; in it, our mind simply can&#039;t grasp a definition of infinity that would include corners... but why would there be no corners in infinity? <br /><br />Then, ketamine is quite unique (I found for myself) when meditating. First of all, it&#039;s short lasting (max 40 minutes compared to 8h for LSD). Secondly it has a very specific &quot;signature&quot; to the trip. It&#039;s hard to describe the difference... I&#039;d say try it (once) and see for yourself, but maybe you don&#039;t wish to try this product - in that case you might want to read the book by D.M. Turner where he describes his experiences with ketamine. He doesn&#039;t specifically use it to meditate on it, but it&#039;ll give you a good idea of the possibilities...

Now for the second part, and especially what to do during a psychedelic trip with that knowledge.<br /><br />The only thing you must do is: contemplate what&#039;s happening (the visuals in closed eyes) and stop the mind chattering (you can help yourself with a mantra at the beginning). Meditate (i.e. do Dhyana) on the visuals and nothing else. If you can do it for only about 30 seconds (seems little isn&#039;t it? In reality 30 seconds of COMPLETE silence is a lot of time, even when you think your mind is in silence in reality there is activity behind, but by and by it will really completely stop for about a minute or so, giving you the possibility - if you know how to do it - to firestart the Samadhi process) without flattering something quite strong will happen: the Kundalini will start to raise. If you are not prepared it can be quite a shock. Certain psychedelics (as DMT) can give symptoms of Kundalini awakening on their own (tingling sensations, jerks movements, difficulty reading or concentrating, pressure on the &quot;third eye&quot; etc. etc.).<br /><br />Kundalini attach to silence. If silence is not found and the Kundalini tries to rise it will block creating a sort of short-circuit in the center it is blocked (and this can cause various symptoms). By and by the use of a psychedelic alone (either without doing nothing in particular) or for a particular circumstance can cause the Kundalini to try to raise and if you aren&#039;t prepared to what it will happen you can either have a lot of trouble.<br /><br />For a book on the experience of rising Kundalini (so that all people can be prepared on what it feels like: it is a wonderful experience but it still has to be taken with respect) I recommend this book of Gopi Khrisna that&#039;s one of the best:<br />http://www.kundaliniawakeningsystems1.com/downloads/kundalini-the-evolutionary-energy-in-man_gopi-krishna_(89pg).pdf<br /><br />Psychedelics are probably the easiest way to awaken and raise the Kundalini, but just for this they are to be used with respect. It has happened to everybody I think the usual bad crisis after a strong use of a psychedelic and sometimes that crisis can be quite drastic as to make you quit their uses altogether (since naturally once put in motion that rise will keep coming again at the next occasion, either in sober life if the circumstance is correct). That&#039;s because of the blockade I was talking about. As with all powerful tools, they require knowledge to not become dangerous.

Sadly you see a lot of &quot;gurus&quot; today that fall just on this trap, the stronger one being the &quot;trap of love&quot;: an emotion takes precedence over any other and this is duality. They think they have just gone above the ego but in reality they just outgrow a part above the rest, and since in their moral view that part is &quot;higher&quot; than the others they think they are doing a good thing, but nothing is &quot;higher&quot; than any other thing, and if you think so you are still in the terms of the ego. Love as an emotion is one of the easiest (and worst to remove) traps for advancement after a certain point. Either bliss becomes a trap after a while, in the same exact way.<br /><br />For this in Raja-Yoga a perfectly banal and neutral object is used for meditation, so that there&#039;s no way you can tie emotions/feelings with it. Naturally it&#039;s much easier to merge with an object that gives you a feeling (as the image of a God, or Guru etc.) but you risk on falling on those sort of traps. I personally like DMT images because I can go beyond the emotional level with them, being them so &quot;other-wordly&quot; and not easily tied to things I can associate my ego with.

Sure you can get far out there while meditating on LSD but it&#039;s not really gonna bring you to enlightenment imo.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cheating on what? &quot;Drugs&quot; have been used in aid to meditation from time immemorial (probably at beginning there was no meditation without a catalyst and even much probably meditation was discovered from a catalyst - just like many forms of shamanism). The writers of the Vedas (from which all the Yoga scriptures comes) used Soma (that was clearly a psychedelic), do you know it, right? <br /><br />All sadhus did employ and employ hemp and/or hash (both psychedelics if used in a certain way) as a catalyst. Buddha is figured standing below a Brugmansia tree in many of the tantra representations. Krishna representations also are full of psychedelics references. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu used psychedelics (also if which type is not known fully, there are different theories) to reach his illumination and keep up the bhakti, and he is considered one of the most influential reincarnations of Krishna nowadays.<br /><br />There&#039;s no &quot;cheating&quot; for what it concerns meditation, and psychedelics will bring you exactly where a meditation without willl bring you (and even farther). The only real problem of psychedelics is just that because they are so immensely powerful and speedy when used correctly, when instead they are used incorrectly they can bring you to full destruction in the same speedy and immensely powerful way (but the same can be said of many other very powerful means, as having a teacher rise the Kundalini for you - one of the speediest but even most dangerous ways to do it; would you consider that &quot;cheating&quot; also? C&#039;mon, this is not a race or challenge, there is no first or last place, no screening for doping or rules during the performance, the only thing that matters is arriving there). <br /><br />I know that there are some new-age school that insist that psychedelics are not natural and/or cheating, but new-age is almost always nonsense; the majority of these new-age gurus have absolutely no knowledge of what the hell they are talking about. This is just another of the usual morality traps I was talking about, and the sad part is that many people like to use these things as their banners, so as to pretend they are superior in some way to others just for a totally arbitrary reasons. Oh well... everybody has the teacher s/he deserves, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Please, don&#039;t fall yourself too on this morality trap, there is no &quot;higher&quot; road to follow, and no &quot;holier&quot; way to walk the walk. If you can use something to your benefit then use it! Denying yourself the benefit of something just for some sort of moral standard is just stupidity.<br /><br />This would be like learning to walk in the water to cross a river because you want to reach a group of beautiful girls on the other side perfectly dry, while others can do so just swimming easily. What a great consolation will it be the fact that you have now reached the other end without being wet now that you are so old that you cannot enjoy the girls anymore while all the others in the meantime did, isn&#039;t it? <br />

				So, <br />there&#039;s been a discussion aobut &quot;kundalini&quot; and I saw some paragraphs warning about how kundalini (when awakened during meditation while on influence of psychedelics) can be dangerous/harmful... <br />could you elaborate on this? <br />I&#039;ve never heard of this? <br />I didn&#039;t think it was possible to awaken your kundalini (when you do it YOURself) and still be in danger/in harm because of it.

Consider a flow of water rushing in a canal. If the canal was never cleaned and taken care of it will much probably contain debris. Now what it will happen if debris is enough for the flow to block? Water will overflow.<br /><br />The same can happen with Kundalini and it&#039;s actually much more common than you think. One of the most common symptoms (because it&#039;s usually the first one and many will simply block there) of overflowing is extreme sexual urge. There are people that literally become sex addicted. That&#039;s a sign of Kundalini blocking at the gate of the second chakra.<br /><br />Sadly there are many &quot;teachers&quot; that teach their students the techniques to raise the Kundalini without anything else. This is comparable to going to church 1 day a week and pretend you will become an holy man just for this; it is much more probable you will become a self-aggrandized moralist. It&#039;s not only the moment of meditation that matters, it is also what you do during you &quot;normal&quot; day to day life. You have to clean your personality and adapt the changes the awakening brings to your life by and by. Doing the exercises to awake Kundalini and then nothing else it is akin to using a psychedelic thinking this last will do everything by itself. It doesn&#039;t work like this and it&#039;s immensely dangerous to approach the awakening in this way. You have to do work also when you are outside the experience of the psychedelic to incorporate what you learned there, and so it is for every other form of meditation.<br /><br />During Kundalini awakement fears, suppressed emotions, parts of your personality you didn&#039;t know existed etc. and even seemingly pure physical effects (that have to do with the inner body but will change physical parameters too) will flood your consciousness, especially with a psychedelic used as a catalyst (since it is a very powerful method). While it is very important to annihilate the ego, it is in the same way important to cleanse and reconstruct the same when it&#039;s there, integrating to it the knowledge you received in those moments. There will be moments that are the so-called the &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; that everybody will pass through and that are supremely important on the process. The more your ego is strong (and beware: it is important to have a strong ego as it is to annihilate it, also if many think the contrary) the more these moments will be hard and powerful, but the more you will be able to integrate them if all goes correctly (if your ego is weak and not cleansed properly you will become much probably tied to only one part of it in contrast to all the rest, and this is not good) and to remain balanced during all the process.<br /><br />There are usually four types of these &quot;die-offs&quot; that can arise cyclically during awakening:<br /><br />- A terror event of intense energy pouring up the body similar to a euphoric inner-conjunction, but in this case it will be a dysphoric inner-conjunction (a sort of polar-flip). There will be experience of great fear with no apparent cause. This &quot;negative&quot; inner-conjunction mostly occurs during one&#039;s first awakening or new awakening cycles, as the&nbsp; spontaneous bliss awakening in a &quot;neophyte-body&quot; that is unfamiliar with such intensity of consciousness and energy can create a polar-flip.<br /><br />- Autonomic shock that occurs immediately after mystic ecstasy. That is the contraction and toxic overload after a significant opening to the extreme bliss of an euphoric inner-conjunction event.<br /><br />- Breakdown of the former structures through oxidation. This is usually experienced almost as a pure bodily malady, as for example not being able to wake-up from bed from days straight for the weakness or similar things.<br /><br />-&nbsp; Lastly there is the exhaustion phase of the overall awakening cycle where the body&#039;s resources of neurotransmitters, hormones, and nutrients have been used up in the climb to the heights of the awakening peak. During exhaustion depression arises, yet there is also permanent bliss giving the sense of being dissociated from the depression.<br /><br />They are unavoidable, as the &quot;living death&quot; must occur for resurrection of the &quot;spiritual&quot; body-mind. All must enter the Dark Night, and possibly many times during the cyclical process of awakening.&nbsp; As it is said: &quot;He who is not twice born will not ascend to the Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (oh, well, the bible is full of Kundalini references; the Book of Job, for example, is a metaphoric representation of the arise, in pure moral/intellectual terms). So it all depends on how you interact with these states. If you are not doing work outside of the single process these things can easily break you. The awakening of Kundalini is a process that integrates every aspect of an individual, it is not just a thing that you can fire and then forget about it.<br /><br /><br />

				wow, <br />thank you BlackIris for this interesting and detailed answer... <br />Lots of what you write seems familiar but, as often, I didn&#039;t think that much about the proces - it&#039;s more like I found my way in it by &quot;going with the flow&quot; and never trying to force any change but by always accepting the possibility of changing, by keeping enough room for the change...<br /><br />The combination of psychedelics and meditation DO change you and it changed lots of stuff in my life, but then again those chooses that I made would probably also have been made without the psychedelics - it&#039;s all &quot;flowing&quot; from who I am and from where I want to go. I do believe psychedelics sped up some of the changes...<br /><br />How about the practice of tantra? <br />As easy as I find it to meditate on psychedelics, that hard it is to practice tantra while under influence... <br />strange... or is there a very good explanation for this also?

				Thank you BI, <br />I&#039;ll look them up asap... <br /><br />Right now I have lots of fun reading &quot;the psychedelic experience&quot; (by Learry and co.). <br />I&#039;m not very far in the book yet, but it seems there might be some very useful passages in it, especially for meditating while on psychedelics... <br /><br />Also, <br />is Raja Yoga similar to Transcendental Meditation. <br />After reading a description of it online it seemed to me that both techniques are quite similar (except maybe that Transcendental Meditation can seem to be kind of a sect where Raja Yoga seems to be an open movement within the Yoga tradition).

The use of a Mantra (i.e. repeating a sentence over and over in your mind) works for silencing the mind, but it will take years of constant dedication to bring you fully there (the motive of why it is so it is because it is a sort of indirect method; it brings you to silence not directly but indirectly, with the use of a trick), it is one of the most slow paths, but just for this it&#039;s also one of the easiest; literally everybody can do it, no matter what (and in fact if you read the TM books etc. you can see how that&#039;s a method developed for absolute beginners; then &quot;developed&quot; to say an imbecility because Mantra Yoga exists from beginning - it&#039;s one of the classic paths of yoga - they just slapped a new name on top of it for marketing).<br /><br />Raja-Yoga is instead the most direct path there is in Yoga, but just for this it can be difficult. It takes effort. Btw even Raja-Yoga has in itself a component of Mantra-Yoga, but it is only used at beginning when you learn pranayama to count the breaths. If you apply with Raja-Yoga you can reach Dhyana in about six months. With Mantra Yoga it will take you to reach that same state at least 5 years if you are lucky.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey mate, how long have you been practicing yoga/meditation?<br />I&#039;ve been meditating on and off for the past couple of years. I never got too deep in it but now I&#039;m more than interested.<br />I went on an Ashram a few years ago and really enjoyed it. My classes revolved around Mantra-Yoga as I was (and still am) a beginner. I think I may attend another one this year or next. :)

You need nothing else.<br />In reality Raja-Yoga is very very simple to explain. There&#039;s not much to write about it. It&#039;s all about practice.<br /><br />As for combination with psychedelics, once you have read those two links you will understand what you have to do while there. Raja-Yoga is simply concentration (Dharana) on an object and the object can be visualized, physically existing or arising in your consciousness (as &quot;hallucinations&quot; from psychedelics). The trick is just to merge with the object (so in the case of DMT, for example, merging with the visuals by completely silencing the mind). I tried to explain about this also in a post above.

If there was a need of more books/articles on the subject I would have gladly gave you more, but Raja-Yoga has not very much to explain, since the practice is very very simple. The difficult part is executing it ;)<br /><br />Moreover I think that, while knowledge and information at beginning is very good and either necessary, if brought to extremes it can bring to a very peculiar danger. There are many people that become so-called &quot;armchair magicians&quot;: they read and read about everything imaginable, they read every new book on a subject they already know to memory etc. etc. but they never practice nothing; they never started practicing something and if they did, they immediately cease for reading something new. The accumulation of information becomes as a sort of excuse to do nothing: &quot;oh, but I need to know everything about the subject before I start it&quot; they tell to themselves, no matter how much they can study a subject.<br /><br />Akin to this are people that jump from one practice to another, always trying something new and never coming to anything. Both are fear reflexes; the ego can block your progress in many different ways.

				Yes, you can find both in paperback editions pretty easily.<br /><br />The &quot;article&quot; of Crowley is the first part of his book &quot;Magick&quot;, a very popular one (probably one of the most popular magical books).<br /><br />Since we are here talking about magick now I also advice everybody interested in it to buy or download (as an ebook) &quot;The Complete Golden Dawn System&quot; of Israel Regardie, that&#039;s probably one of the most complete books about it ever written. You can find everything in there from Astral Travel, Enochian calls, Rituals, Initiations and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Literally a must have if one is interested in occultism.

				As a compendium to the complete golden dawn system there&#039;s a book of the same author that it&#039;s also a must have (sorry to not have mentioned before, it just escaped my mind atm).<br /><br />The Tree of Life, a study in Magic - Israel Regardie<br />http://www.globalgrey.co.uk/Books/Qabalah/Tree-Of-Life-A-Study-In-Magic.pdf<br /><br />In this book Regardie explains himself many of the topics in the book &quot;The Complete Golden Dawn System&quot;. This last has everything concerning hermetic magick but it is a little low on explanations. &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; explains many of the topics that are in that book with examples etc. There are some chapters that are considered pearls in the hermetic tradition.<br /><br />Another encyclopedic book and must have is: Initiation into Hermetics&nbsp; by Franz Bardon. <br />http://files.vsociety.net/data/library/Section%205%20(C,%20I,%20O,%20U)/Bardon,%20Franz/The%20Holy%20Mysteries/Initiation%20into%20Hermetics.pdf<br /><br />This one is a mammoth and it is a full course to be done in steps on the practice of magic, from the basics to the particulars. It is probably the most complete book about full &quot;teaching&quot;, but just for this it is very very challenging (I don&#039;t think anybody alive can complete all those steps in the exact way explained, but still they give a good source on which to form your personal way of approaching the teaching). Franz Bardon is also sometimes too dogmatic upon the approach (i.e. as in &quot;you must do this in this way and this way only&quot;) but still as I said this one book (along the complete system of the golden dawn) is a must have for what it concern occultism.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mention these books before because this thread was more about meditation, but since anyway there&#039;s already a link to occultism I think it&#039;s opportune to list also these ones. There are many others that maybe I will post in the future, but for now I think this is a good reference for books to read to begin knowing more about those topics.

				I experimented with lsd and meditation (focus on following the breath), but wasn&#039;t a success, too much thought activity that absorbed my focus, also open and closed eye visuals are too distracting. <br /><br />Not sure if it can be called meditation, but staying with the feeling &#039;I am&#039; is really effective for me while on lsd. Have been experimenting with this for the last 5 trips or so. It is described as &#039;staying with the &#039;I am&#039;&#039; by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and Mooji, I think this practice is the same as &#039;staying in the now&#039;, as described by Eckhart Tolle.<br /><br />Last time I experienced satori while exercising this staying with the &#039;I am&#039;, that together with a question from Mooji that he asks a lot in his satsangs; &#039;Who is even perceiving the perceiver?&#039;. This was an immense impressive experience, the implications of this realization are enormous, shook my world for quite a bit. Too bad that the &#039;seeing&#039; of realizations like these don&#039;t stay after coming down.<br /><br />Very interesting and informative thread guys! Will follow this one.

				@BlackIris: I was wondering, how could you &quot;unblock&quot; blockages in the kundalini energy (at the second chakra) in case it got blocked while tripping?

To pass a block is a matter of understanding what the cause is and correct the problem. For example, as I said, the blockade in the second chakra is usually experienced as an immense sexual urge. This is, in many cases (the majority) a matter of a sick rapport with your own sexuality that doesn&#039;t permit the energy to flow freely or not being capable to refrain from physical stimulation.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181927.msg1445533#msg1445533">Quote from: RaFaeL5 on August 13, 2013, 09:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, when writing about Raja yoga you said that the technique is based on focusing your thoughts on (inanimate) objects...

So, yes, one way it can be used&nbsp; is just to establish a link with a spirit (as done in Shamanism or Magick; there are also other ways to do it - as it&#039;s usually always the case - but this is probably the most direct, albeit a little more complicate than others).<br /><br />In that particular text a simple object is used but you can use in your practice whatever you like and you feel more comfortable with as a focus. For example you can use a part of your physical body as a target for your concentration (as the forehead), or you can either use a sound if you prefer it. I usually suggest to start with a moving object (as for example a red triangle in 3D that rotates, enlarges, moves etc.) because it is much easier, especially at beginning. The mind is more naturally attracted by variation and complexity and so concentrating and keeping concentration on a moving object is much easier (however you have to be certain that the movement and change is voluntary; if it isn&#039;t then it&#039;s a break as usual) than doing the same with an immobile and unchanging object.<br /><br />Once you are able to reach Dhyana (contemplation) with something you can do it with whatever other thing and the result varies depending on the object you merge with. If for example you merge with your hand what you call &quot;you&quot; becomes your hand, if you merge with a spirit then you link with it and it becomes what it is called an &quot;ally&quot;.

				In short it&#039;s by Andrieh Vitimus and adapted from Peter Carroll’s Liber KKK and Liber MMM. Which was based on Austin Osman Spare&#039;s glyphs of desire -which I meant to reference instead. <br /><br />Spare&#039;s work is minimally -trippy. But one can create their own ceremonial sigils and that is what this (Vitmus&#039;) book is about. <br /><br />There&#039;s a couple things. Vitimus encourages participants to test results which is anathema for many other practitioners of magick. He also provides exercises that will help people discover their own magical style. <br /><br />Finally, for all the skeptics out there -what&#039;s the worst that can happen?

He also provides exercises that will help people discover their own magical style. <br /><br />Finally, for all the skeptics out there -what&#039;s the worst that can happen?

				Very good idea for thread<br /><br />Some more books<br /><br />Ram Dass&nbsp; - Journey of Awakening<br />Timothy Leary - Psychedelic Prayers<br />Lao Tzu - Tao Te Ching<br />Shunry Suzuki - Zen Mind, Beginner&#039;s Mind<br />Alan Watts - everything - check out the Alan Watts&#039; Lectures iphone App.<br /><br />Ashtanga, like other types of hatha, yoga is very effective with or without psychedelics (it has an undeserved reputation for being &#039;unspiritual&#039; because of it fashionability with yuppies and celebrities a few years ago). You need to be in good shape to do it though and it isn&#039;t really for hatha yoga beginners. But the aims of raja yoga are much easier for many people to achieve once the body has been put into the right kind of state.<br /><br />For me psychedelics are quite easy to integrate into a regular practice, but like most people who&#039;ve ever done this, I ended up finding that the practice became more important than the psychedelics...LSD can help motivate you to take up and keep up a practice, it can diagnose problems in your practice and really beautiful trips can be a regular reward for it...but they won&#039;t be the biggest reward...but it can all help. <br /><br />

				thank you adamiz<br /><br />@ sitdown: I added these titles to the list on the first page of this thread. Since I don&#039;t know all the books I added them in the section &quot;guidebook on meditation while on psychedelics&quot; but if these book would better be placed under another section just let me know (if necessary I&#039;ll make a new section for some of them). <br />Thank you for the info!

Is there an &quot;easy&quot; way to do this yourself, or only complicated techniques/help from others can dissolve the blockages? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Blockages in the gates of the so-called &quot;chakras&quot; are all having to do with the individual himself, so only you can really go beyond them (others can naturally help you on evidencing you the problem, but it is always a matter of yourself to pass it, nobody can do it for you). <br /><br />Depending on the chakra the blockade has a particular nature (as for example psychological, philosophical or emotional etc. etc.). To pass a block is a matter of understanding what the cause is and correct the problem. For example, as I said, the blockade in the second chakra is usually experienced as an immense sexual urge. This is, in many cases (the majority) a matter of a sick rapport with your own sexuality that doesn&#039;t permit the energy to flow freely or not being capable to refrain from physical stimulation. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I once did a simple breath meditation on 4HO MET and it was amazing. The colors and light intensified and I could feel intense energy in the base of my spine. Soon though I became entangled in sexual thoughts and though the pleasure was intense the fantasy took me away from the thoughtless state of being pure light. Later I got up and smoked a small amount of cannabis and soon after I had a &quot;whiteout&quot; fell and bashed my head. I awoke to my wife crying over me. I strongly feel that I had this reaction from blocked kundalini after reading this thread. It frightened me quite a bit but I have never reacted this way before or since.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow, <br />that sounds intense (in not such a nice way)...<br />I wonder what BI will say about this experience. <br />Thanks for sharing it, PrinceBlack<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Until the whiteout it was truly amazing.&nbsp; My attachments to sexual energy or orgasm really did get in the way. It is a powerful energy that has an addictive quality. It is one of those aspects I have done a lot of work around to the extent that I have healed a lot of poor decision making around. I do hope to be able to focus its power beyond orgasm seeking. I really hadn&#039;t put the chakra block idea into the equation until I read this thread but Iit all makes sense now. I am very interested in psychedelic therapy. In my youth I misused them and every drug in general.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />did you try the practice of (sexual) tantra as a &quot;cure&quot;? <br />we found that it was extremely good at curing sexual trauma (especially for my GF it was an amazingly effective experience in the most profoundly positive way). <br /><br />See you on the other forum thread about micro-dosing psychedelics! (see my signature)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Tantra seems like an excellent idea. My yoga practice has been very slack, kids, business, blahh blahh, all the things yoga can help alleviate the stress of I have let it take over somewhat. I meditate every night but usually after cannabis and into sleep so it is not so profound. Our local teacher practices tantra and brings it into her vinyasa class in breathwork etc... This past week I have started getting my physical body back into shape with sun salutations (cure for any trip gone awry btw) and I will take my humble ass into the studio soon and take it from there. Thx for the reading list.<br /><br />Anybody seen Black Iris? Noticed he&#039;s been gone for a few. Hope all is well. He is a great resource.

Sent some links to my dad once. You can also try a local yoga studio that isn&#039;t fitness yoga.
