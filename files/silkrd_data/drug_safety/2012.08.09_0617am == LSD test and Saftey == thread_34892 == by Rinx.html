				So I am out of BTC for a few days (haven&#039;t seen any LSD kits on the road anyways) is there a good way to get your hands on LSD kits off the road not sure what type of shop to buy it from or if government tracks orders for kits. I don&#039;t want to take some sort of BS RC and I would like to play it safe.<br /><br />I was also told, if it has a taste just swallow it since most of the RC&#039;s won&#039;t become active is swallowed. <br />

				I can&#039;t say anything about testing kits as I really don&#039;t know. But about the swallowing the tab remark, what you&#039;re referring to is the fact that NBOME chemicals aren&#039;t orally active, so swallowing the tab should have no effects if that&#039;s what&#039;s on it. That&#039;s an OK strategy, but be aware that DOx chemicals can fit on blotter and are orally active. Not only that but I consider them to be (from second hand research) the more dangerous of the two categories of RCs. So don&#039;t rely on that to prevent an unwanted trip with an unknown chemical.<br /><br />Also, it should be noted that legit LSD tabs can have a taste if certain substances are used to lay the blotter (high proof alcohol I believe will do this) or if they are heavily printed (ink can be bitter.) I&#039;ve had tabs with a taste that were legit as far as I could tell.<br /><br />Above all, definitely start small dose wise until you&#039;re confident with what a substance is. Minimise any risks that way.
