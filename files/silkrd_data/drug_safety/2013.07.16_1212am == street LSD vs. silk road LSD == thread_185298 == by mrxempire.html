				For those of you with access to people selling street LSD, I was just curious as to what your preference is. Do you prefer to get your L from a known local source, or from the dark web? I personally have a friend who sells some WOW hits for cheaper than what you would get on the road. I pay about 60 a ten strip for his shit. However, I still prefer to pay the extra money to get my LSD from the internet. Not only is the entire process more cool and badass than meeting up with some dude who gives you L, but with SR you get exact dosing measurements, cool designs on your blotters, and you know what you are getting into when you make a purchase. My friends LSD varies in potency wildly. Sometimes the shit he gets is insane, but other times it is pretty mediocre. Anyway, thats just my opinion on the matter. Whats yours?

				I prefer to get my lsd from the road. By getting it here i know exactly how many ugs are in each dose which is very helpful. In my area most people sell nbombs as lsd which is not only a rip off but not safe. When it comes to substances like this, it&#039;s best to know what you&#039;re getting yourself into.<br /><br />SR&gt; Street

				When i first started getting into LSD I could find a sheet of great WoW easily for 500$-600$ was usually in the ~90-150ug range. <br /><br />Then a few people went to jail, a certain festival got shut down and its all gone now. I&#039;ve been hearing of vials here an there, but since i found this place I dont feel comfortable driving to the next city to possibly meet up with some sketch folks. <br />Until someone i personally know has some, its buying off the Road for me! All the L i&#039;ve had off of here has been amazing, just more expensive than i&#039;m used to

				In the 90&#039;s I used to pick up 10 packs for $750 (that&#039;s 1000 hits) of 250 microgram blotters and sell them for $5 each or 5 for $20 back in high school!<br /><br />Look at today&#039;s prices...talk about inflation! I wonder if tougher regulation of the precursors made it less popular as it was much harder to make or if the demise of Dead and Phish continuous touring made distribution more of an issue.. <br /><br />We used to go down to the states grab our packs and mail them back into Canada. <br /><br />MDMA became the trip standard in the later 90&#039;s and acid started to wane at least in North America at that time<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tripped on LSD for a while though so I&#039;ll be ordering some off of here soon..
