				I was wondering, realistically, how much worse is meth for you than l/d amphetamines? Is the addiction potential much higher?<br /><br />Also do you users think the extra price on Meth is worth it?<br /><br />I want to give meth a try, but it has a very negative stigma, and I don&#039;t want to be sucked into it. I feel that not having a single place to get meth in real life will help keep addiction at bay, though.

				I tried meth for the first time recently, only oral and snorting though. Dunno how pure it was but I didn&#039;t feel a great difference to how i feel when speeding. Maybe i&#039;ll try it again, but for the best value stimulant i think speed is number 1.&nbsp; 8) Didn&#039;t think meth was worth the price. Maybe I need to try smoking it.

				For me Crystal Meth makes me so freakin paranoid I cant do it anymore...last time I had like 20 dollars worth and by the end of the night of snorting lines I was staring out my windows watching cars transform themselves into cop cars and laid out all my other stuff on the bathroom floor so I could flush it when they busted down my door...Of course there was no one out there!! <br /><br />So my advice...stick to Dexedrine IR or Adderall IR Tabs

				How was speed like (amph sulphate)? and is there much euphoria? and do you think you could go about doing daily tasks or studying on it? (sorry for the rush of questions)

				I&#039;ve always found speed to be euphoric, and you will certainly become more focused on whatever you are doing. I&#039;ve known people to take it in order to get their house clean, and I suppose for studying it would be similar to taking ADD meds.
