				Dired shrooms I can answer<br /><br />For long term storage, a vacuum sealed bag in the freezer. They will last up to 10 years with very little degradation. <br /><br />If you intend to use them in under 6 month, a ziplock bag in the freezer works. Make sure it is a frost free freezer.

				I asked same question bout a week ago concerning MDMA and everyone gave me the exact same answer - MDMA will last avery long time in almost any conditions.<br /><br />As for shrooms, seeing their dried I would think the same rules would apply as for dried vegetables fruit, n such: keep away from moisture. Out of direct sunlight might be a goood idea also.

				It really depends on what you are storing. Things like mdma tablets will have a virtually unlimited shelf life as long as you store it away from sunlight, while fresh products like mushrooms will probably be best off in the freezer.<br /><br />Things like tablets usually have a maxim shelf life of only 5 years quoted on the strip or bottle, but that is the maximum allowed by legislation. Something like a tablet of valium will be fine even if stored for 1000 years in your bathroom closet, while other substances like tetracycline class antibiotics will degrade over time and should not be used after their expiry date. <br /><br />Unfortunately there is no way to tell the difference between medications that expire in 5 years and those that will actually go bad over tine, short of researching it yourself. Taking a 100 year old tablet of aspirine will be safe whlile taking a 10 year old tablet of malerone is not, despite the first one being 95 years over its expiration date and the latter only 5. <br /><br />This is the unfortunate effect of legislation - even rcok salt expires in&nbsp; 5 years according to the label, despite being in the ground for millenia before it was put into a jar.

The dates are 5 years out but come on, Pickles are good for decades and the longest honey has been stored and was still edible was 5000 years (Egyptian Tombs). So it looks like government at it&#039;s best, regulate the unneeded and let that which needs regulation run without it.

				It is a government think really, coupled of corporate insurance.<br /><br />Surely you consume something like a 100 year old tin of tuna just fine, but the manufacturer will not guarantee that. One reason is that it may not taste that well after a century, despite being safe to eat when considering bacterial growth and such. Perhaps products should have two labels for that: tastes good until 2017, safe to eat until 3017.

				Same question concerning MDA and 2C-B: What would be the best way to store them (without the fridge option, impossible when too many people at home), and how long can you consider consuming them without a significative drop in its potency??<br /><br />I guess that for MDA, it should be the same answer as for MDMA, as these are very close molecules, but for 2C-B, I have no idea about the stability of the molecule.<br />If someone knows let us know if we can still trip with it in 2 years, 5 years, or 10 years.<br /><br />That should be nice to have a topic specialized on drugs storage, and giving informations about the stabiity of the different drugs ant the causes to avoid seen them degraded.

				Yayo has a good shelf life too, as long as it&#039;s kept dry away from moisture and excessive heat. I lost a bag 1 time and found it 3 years later and i was still good even when cooked it&nbsp; jumped back.

				MDMA and similar compounds can be kept 4 a very long time, probably your lifetime if stored correctly.<br />Keeping it vacuum sealed in a dark cool place is what you wanna do. Keep it save from anything chemicals can react to, UV and IR radiation eg sunlight , anything containing oxygen -&gt; Air , water. <br />Keeping it cool will help slow down any reacting that will still occur.<br /><br />This knowlegde comes from several drug related forums i used to visit in my MDMA days, one last tip. The quickest way to destroy the effect of these awesome molecules is by overdoing them. Once overdone, the magic will be gone (i fear forever). To bad i learned that the hard way (and by ignoring this advice on said forums)<br /><br />I never researched the shelflifes of other substances but i&#039;m sure the storage advice still applies. I&#039;m guessing most chemicals can be kept at least a few years like this. If you wanna know more , google clearnet drugs-forum or erowid for &quot;expert&quot; advice.<br /><br />grtz sam<br />

				It really depends on the exact substance. Things like mdma. diazepam etc will last a lifetime if stored in a cool, dry and dark place.<br /><br />There are a few medications that should not be stored for a long time like tetracyclines, since they are unstable molecules and there is no way to really prevent their breakdown, although cold temperatures will slow it down. The shelf life of these substances may be 1 year at room temperature, but that could be extended to several years if kept in the freezer. <br /><br />With biological samples like mushrooms or even pot, there are a couple of options for storage. One way is storing the sample as-is under very cold (-80 or liquid nitrogen) temperatures, the other is dessication (removal of water) to stop any enzymatic breakdown from taking place. These can obviously be combined storing a dried sample at cryogenic temperatures. <br /><br />Assuming you have no lab equipment and fridges available, the best way to store shrooms is probably to dry them first, and then store the dry product in a domestic (-20) freezer. The freezing process will likely destroy cell walls making the thawed product unsuitable for creating clones, and also expedite perishing once thawed. So you do decide to freeze them, do not unfreeze them until you are about to use them.

				phenethylamines like 2C-B are extremely stable. keep them in the dark, away from excessive moisture and around reasonable room temp, and it will last as long as you would ever need it to

				Not related to OP&#039;s question, just my experience with shelf life of codeine.<br /><br />A buddy of mine found a stash of his aunt&#039;s pain pills (codeine/acetaminophen)&nbsp; that were somewhere between 5-10 years old (he removed them from the original container but I remember seeing dates on these bottles from &#039;01-&#039;07) and they seemed to have retained most of their potency (it was my first time with codeine but definitely gave me a familiar opiate high).<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				If you plan to store anything for an extended period, than you should buy some amber glass vials. very useful and very cheap on ebay.<br /><br />and since James mentioned the Egyption honey thing, I also wanted to point out that they also found samples of magic mushrooms in the tombs that were stored in honey for 1000s of years and were still active. When I lived near the cow pastures this was my favorite way to preserve them. just make sure that they are bone dry first.

There are very few substances that will lose potency and even become dangerous after long term storage. A tablet of valium produced in the 70s will be as good as one produced yesterday regardless of being expired for 30 years. Things you should be wary off are antibiotics, taking a 30 year old anti-malaria tablet certainly is not a good idea if you have any option of obtaining a fresh one.
