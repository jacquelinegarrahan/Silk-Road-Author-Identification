				After a seriously long wait for Priority mail (3 weeks), I finally received the Opana&#039;s I ordered.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Before I waste these precious seeds, I thought I would poll those who have gone before as to their favorite method of consumption.<br /><br />Having read through the posts here and on the web regarding Opana ER&#039;s, there seems to be three favored methods.<br /><br />1: Insufflation.&nbsp; Removing the coating (scraping only) and making small lines to snort.<br />2: IV: Sitting in 4ml of water for 24 hours.<br />3: IV: 90% iso method.<br /><br />Naturally, like most, the idea of waiting 24 hours is hard.&nbsp; So I have already tried the first method by scraping the coating off, quartering the pill, crushing the 1/4 and dividing it up into two lines before snorting it.&nbsp; <br /><br />How long does it take to hit you when insufflating?&nbsp; Right away?&nbsp; 10-15 minutes?&nbsp; an Hour?<br /><br />What is your favorite method and any tips or suggestions would be welcomed.<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br />&nbsp;:D

				I&#039;m not an IV person myself, so naturally insufflation is my preferred ROA.&nbsp; It takes about 10-15 minutes for it to kick in decently, and then fully probably around the 30 minute mark.&nbsp; Eat a nice, high fat meal prior to doing any.&nbsp; Although it normally only helps when taking the pill orally I believe, there&#039;s inevitably going to be some drip, so might as well enhance what does drip.<br /><br />And although I&#039;m not an IV person, if I were going to IV something it would for sure be an Opana or a Dilaudid.&nbsp; The nature of the drug is such that the bioavailability is VASTLY higher(like 10% oral as compared to 100% IV, it&#039;s also around 40% intranasally, for reference) when going the IV ROA.&nbsp; So, assuming you want to get the most bang for your buck, as well as not have to wait, I would avoid the 90% iso method since from what I&#039;ve read it&#039;s not that effective.&nbsp; I would drop a few pills in some water to allow the extraction process to start, and while you&#039;re waiting, insufflate whatever you need to keep you nodding until your extraction is done.<br /><br />As for tips with the &quot;teks.&quot;&nbsp; Insufflation is pretty straight forward if you&#039;ve ever ground up a pill and snorted it.&nbsp; As for the IV route, give this thread a read: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1983.0.&nbsp; It seems to have the most information.

				Yes, as with most of us, I wanted to get the most bang for my buck, but I wanted it now, not later.<br /><br />So the first thing I did was put one Opana into a 4cc locking syringe (the kind used to inject into an IV bag, they don&#039;t use a needle, they screw onto a port in an IV line), filled it with 4cc&#039;s of distilled water, put the locking cap on and put it aside until tomorrow.<br /><br />Then I took another Opana and cut it into quarters, cutting up one quarter really fine, then snorted it as two lines.&nbsp; I waited about an hour.&nbsp; Not really as strong as I was expecting.&nbsp; But my tolerance may be up quite a bit, I just went through quite a large number of 20mg Oxy IR&#039;s, IV&#039;d.<br /><br />I then did the 90% ISO on another quarter.&nbsp; It seemed to work OK.&nbsp; I added hot water to the film left over after the ISO evaporated, put in a filter and sucked it up in a 1cc syringe.&nbsp; It seemed to work OK.&nbsp; Again, a small buzz, nothing major.<br /><br />I ended up snorting and ISO&#039;ing the rest of one 40mg, plus one more, over the next 8 hours, waiting 4 hours between the first try and the last.&nbsp; Just trying to be careful.<br /><br />Given my reaction so far to what I have taken, I think I would need to do 15-20mg via the ISO method or 10-15mg via insufflation to get a good rush from the Oxymorphone.<br /><br />In the morning I will try 1ml/1cc of the one that has been sitting in water for 24 hours.&nbsp; That should work out to a 10mg dose, and supposedly the 24 hour method has a better conversion factor, meaning I should actually get 10mg from 1/4 of the 4cc.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I am losing 10-30% when doing it via ISO and snorting has only a 43% bioavailability anyway.<br /><br />Hopefully the morning dose will give me that rush everyone talks about.<br /><br /><br />Cheers.&nbsp; ;D

				&nbsp;I have taken opanas before the dawn of time. If you are an I&#039;ver then thats the best option. Still, be careful. If you snort. you can scrape the small coating off or do what i do and just scrape everything together.My dosage nasally is about 20mg, so, I will take 1/2 a 40 and cut that up into about 6 or 7 small lines. After each line, I wait about 3-5 minutes. Rotating nostrils. this gives the med eough time to be absorbed.<br /><br />Plus, it wont goop up in your nose and it will be a much more pleasant experience. The best way to I&#039;v is to do the water extractions (put the pill in water for 24 hours and then&nbsp; filter) the iso route is much quicker and you don&#039;t lose too much. so,if you are impatient, that&#039;s the best way, but if you can wait 24 hours, do so...<br /><br />Also, if you snort, eat a high fat meal with it. You will find that your experience will go up by at least 10-30 percent. probably around the 15 percent mark, but you will def. feel the difference...<br /><br />Always be careful with opana and and never mix alcohol with it. I know one person who took 4 shots of very high proof alcohol with their opana orally and they damned near died. BE CAREFUL WITH OPANA!!!!

				appreciate the synopsis of ingestion methods, Chronic.&nbsp; <br /><br />with the water extractions, what do you use to strain the solution before IV?<br />something simple like a cheesecloth, etc?

				Funny you should say that. Here in a couple month, they will have a TRF (tamper resistant formula) for the opana. Basically, so you can&#039;t break them down to snort it. They say, there will be 2 versions one TFT and one regular, it will be up to the doc to which one you will receive. This isnt&#039; fact, only threory, so, get the opana while you can, there may be time, where the opaans wil be just like the New OC&#039;s..<br /><br />Lets hope not...

				I am dreading the day they change Opana ERs&nbsp; to the TRF because I will have to start doing H again and I would prefer not. <br /><br />It really confuses me as to why they go through such lengths to stop people from abusing these drugs when all it will do is drive people to heroin which is a riskier option due to the fact it isn&#039;t a pill and therefore as very inconsistent quality at times.<br /><br />There will always be people in pain who will need opiates to function and there will always be opiate addicts why make them endanger&nbsp; themselves when there is no need to.<br /><br />Opana is a top notch opiate that is for sure.

				Sorry guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;Got busy.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have to say, those things really gel up.&nbsp; I think the next time I try the 24 hour water method I am going to get a screen or filter to place over the pill to make it easier to drain the liquid after.<br /><br />I definitely think my tolerance was too high this time.&nbsp; It took basically an entire pill to get a decent rush. But, overall I would say the 24 hour method seems to work fairly well.<br /><br />Next time I am going to use a little more water (5ml) and a larger container.<br />

				The one&#039;s that I&#039;ve just received have crushed really easily, seemingly with no coating on them. They&#039;re yellow. They look easily snortable. Planning on using them tomorrow, but am I missing something? Are they going to gel up or get gooey? Have only ground one up so don&#039;t want to waste the other two!

				I always just snorted mine. It always seemed like these took longer to kick in than other opiates. With me, this made it more likely to go ahead and crush another. Just be careful lol

				this is what i have done to snort op 80s&#039; i first scraped the coating off, i then toke a file and filed everything to a fine powder, i then put it on a plate(glass it works faster) spread it out but not to far apart,i then put it in the microwave and put it to 7 minutes now youll want to watchit the WHOLE time DO NOT take your eyes off of it, it will turn like a golden color most anway. just make sure your watching it. now take it out and put it in the freezer for 10 minutes, once your done with this part take it out and dry off the plate it will be damp be sure not to wipe any of the prize, now scrap it off the plate and cut up into lines. i&#039;ve done this methed a few time now and i don&#039;t seem to clogged up and i&#039;ll even get that drip. i&#039;m not saying this is the only way but it has worked for me. if anyone has a better way let me. thanks for checking out my reply.

Be fucking careful with opana (oxymorphone) and as chronicpain said, DO NOT drink!!! It can drastically alter the bio-availability and result in overdose easily. <br /><br />The second biggest difference is that opana can be snorted easily. Please do not microwave your precious oxymorphone. That would make me sad.

				Unfortunately my recent Opana order was not able to be filled. It was cancelled and I was refunded. I am a little annoyed over the circumstances but I guess there is no point in sulking over it. The good news is that at least when I was refunded, it was in the equivalent dollar amount rather than BTC. So I didn&#039;t really lose anything beyond an opportunity. I wasn&#039;t expecting that.<br /><br />Anyway, considering that I really had my heart set on getting an last Opana, I was told by the seller that there would be no more in the future as production of Opana has ceased. That being the case, what do each of you consider to be a good buy? I&#039;m only familiar with Oxys and Opana...<br /><br />Thanks.

				Anyone else heard that production of opana was being discontinued???<br /><br />I searched and found that the 7.5 and 15 mg were withdrawn as of Mar. 1, 2011. It was not for reasons of safety or efficacy but so Endo could focus on producing the more popular dosages, said the FDA (Aug. 30). <br /><br />I was worried this is the dreaded switch to the &quot;crush proof&quot; formulation. The most updated info I can find is that the FDA has until Dec. 13, 2011 to approve the changes to the formula that was rejected and then resubmitted. I cant find anything saying that the new formula has actually been approved however. <br /><br />Anyone else have any info on the &quot;possible&quot; discontinuation/re-formulation?<br />

				Just ran across this but I think the product that I&#039;m offering kinda applies to this thread, you can pre-order some IV READY solution and I&#039;ve just lowered the prices a whole bunch!
