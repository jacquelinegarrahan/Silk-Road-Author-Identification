				I have a digital scale that measures to 0.01g which should be alright for weighing out DMT hits. How do you guys weigh out powder without wasting it on the scoop (I&#039;m using a nail file) and then wasting it again on the scale bed? The powder sticks to each and gets messy.

				What I do is fold a tiny piece of paper in half, put that on the scale and press &#039;TARE&#039;. Pressing &#039;Tare&#039; brings the scale back to 0.00g. Then I weigh out 0.05g (+/- 50mg), scooping it onto the paper. Transferring it from the paper to the pipe/vaporizer is easy as the fold in the paper serves as a miniature spoon.<br /><br />Also, I wouldn&#039;t use a nail file, as they are coarse, so would leave some DMT stuck to them. I use the small side of a medicine spoon that comes with children&#039;s cough bottle. Always works a treat for me ;)<br /><br />Hope this helps ;)

				Pretty solid advice there. DMT seems to stick to everything. I feel like i waste/lose so much when trying to weight the shit.<br /><br />Ive learned to eyeball 40-70mg doses. I suggest you do the same, save your self loads of time, and some precious spirit molecule.

				To save me from losing anything I get a king size rizla and twist both ends so it makes a kind of boat shape. I then rip of one of the twists leaving a boat shape with an opening at one end. I then place that on the scales and press &#039;Tare&#039; (Or you can place on the scales before you turn them on which will provide the same result as tare). Finally I pour my powder into the rizla at the weight i want. I can then pick up the rizla by the twist i left on and pour the powder out of where i ripped the other twist off (into a bag or on a tray or where ever you want to put the powder)! I don&#039;t lose anything doing it this way!<br /><br />Hope this makes sense!

				I dont know jackshit about&nbsp; DMT, but with other powder substances I used to have problems with it sticking to materials because of static electricity, solved this problem via using a metal insturment to discharge inside the bags- just thought it might help.<br /><br /><br />Question::<br /><br />It would seem to me that if DMT could be rocked up , it would be alot more convenient for users. Is it possible to do this?

				I&#039;m sure DMT could be &quot;rocked up&quot;. All you need is a binder like a bit of starch and a drop of water should be all it takes.
