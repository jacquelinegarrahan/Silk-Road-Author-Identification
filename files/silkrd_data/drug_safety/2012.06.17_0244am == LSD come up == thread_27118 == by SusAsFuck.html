				So i finally decided to drop 2 hits of 3janes acid. During the come up everything just felt so intense.. It was like my soul was being launched into the next state of mind. Is there any way to make the come up any smoother? I really want to try 2.5 hits next time but i fear that the come up will be way too intense.

				Take a bit of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), which you can buy over the counter in grocery/drug stores, and it&#039;ll make the visuals a bit more colorful and dreamlike as well as lessening the body load. It&#039;s super helpful for 2C-E as well! :D

				i would suggest against taking benadryl, it&#039;s only useful, imo, for psychadelics that carry a bodyload. it would probably make the lsd come up only very marginally smoother, but adds a bunch of other variables to the trip (the odd feeling which benadryl gives you plus its very noticeable sedative properties). i&#039;d suggest sticking to 2 tabs a few more times, and getting used to that intensity, and then slowly upping the dose by a half a tab or a full one each time you feel you&#039;ve become accustomed to that intensity level.

				It&#039;s mental more than anything IME. If you&#039;re in a comfortable place you won&#039;t have an unpleasant come up. Also embrace it don&#039;t fight it.

				Stagger the doses. Take one tab, wait an hour, take the other tab. I just took 2 tabs of 3jane last week so I know exactly what you mean!&nbsp; :D
