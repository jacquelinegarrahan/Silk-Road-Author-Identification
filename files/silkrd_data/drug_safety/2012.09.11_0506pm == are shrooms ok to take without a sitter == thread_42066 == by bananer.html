				I&#039;ve never had a sitter. Either i go solo or my mates are tripping as well. <br />Many people recommend using a sitter. Maybe have someone on your phone who you can call (who knows your tripping) if shit gets uncomfortable.

				Personally I would NEVER do shrooms alone . It depends a lot on your psyche. I&#039;ve always been tripping with my friends and we&#039;ve never used a sitter.<br /><br />if you choose to do it anyway - pls do yourself a favour and start low.<br /><br />btw. aren&#039;t you a dane like myself ? :)

				If the posts above arent an indication, then let me just say no one can definitively answer this question for you. Everyone is different any every shroom is different.<br /><br />Personally I would not recommend starting your first psychedelic trip EVER lone, but that is clearly your decision.

				do not try shrooms alone for your first time.<br />there will probably be some crying involved, and you may be overwhelmed with how much you learn about yourself lol<br /><br />shrooms are a new experience alone, and its worth doing, but i wouldnt do it for my first time.<br /><br />

				It depends on who you are, how much you take, and how comfortable you are alone.<br /><br />Do it with a friend, unless you fancy yourself a true pioneer. Some people are built for it and some aren&#039;t.<br /><br />A sitter should be someone who is very psychologically stable and experienced, either with psychedelics, or with life.

				If it&#039;s your very first psyc experience, I&#039;d recommend a sitter--someone nice and chill. At least for the first few hours. IF nothing else have someone check on you every hour or so.

				My advice for doing it alone would be to make a vow to yourself before you begin your trip that you will not tell anybody what you are up to until it&#039;s over. During my first trip I was having the time of my life, got super excited and started talking to someone about it. Said person wasn&#039;t experienced with drugs at all and really had no idea how much a few words could make someone in that state flip shit. My trip took a horrible turn, and I spent the rest of it in the fetile position completely fucking terrified. Did I mention that I happened to be experiencing ego death for the first time while this was happening? Not fun.<br /><br />Personally though I would never use a sitter. I think it&#039;s just a weird thing to ask for. &quot;Hey want to watch me have fun for 6-8 hours while you observe in envy?&quot; Knowing someone is in the room to babysit me would make me really uncomfortable.

				I personally prefer shrooming alone, but it can get interesting lone wolfing it.&nbsp; At 2 grams I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have problems, however put your keys in a place you can&#039;t get to them and I&#039;d avoid doing the first one by yourself at night.&nbsp; Shrooms are best if you can get out walking in nature without people around.

				You should have a sitter, definitely. In the event of a bad trip, you will want emotional support.<br /><br />But if you don&#039;t have a sitter, start with a light dosage, and make sure you&#039;re in a comfortable set and setting.

				Come on guys.. you don&#039;t even know what kind of magic mushrooms he is going to eat . 2grams of Copelandia Cyanescens or P. Azurescens for instance is a HIGH dose and I would never recommend that for a first timer.<br /><br />but I guess you are going to consume the mexican (cubensis) ?

				Only thing I can suggest is the same thing I suggest to any of my friends/family when they want to trip for the first time.<br /><br />First off, I suggest having someone with you familiar with the drug so if you do start freaking out they have at least somewhat of an idea of what you&#039;re going through and can better help you through it. If I do plan on having someone with me I usually make sure I have enough for both of us to take so we can trip together if they want. The extra money out of my pocket is worth the good time with my friends. I would never suggest tripping with someone unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the substance you&#039;re taking.<br /><br />Outside of the first time I suggest going with whatever you&#039;re comfortable with. I have tripped alone before and will again (probably tomorrow), but whenever I plan on taking a higher dose than I have before I get nervous and anxious and having a friend or my girlfriend with me makes me more comfortable. The more comfortable you are with what you&#039;re going into the better off you are.<br /><br />Happy tripping and enjoy your first time.

				1 Gram of shrooms to start with..... some netflix by your side with funny trippy movies(Harold &amp; Kumar, Supertroopers, Half Baked) and you should be fine... <br /><br />I would not try them alone tho if you planned to sit at the computer or try to play videogames... you might notice the walls moving and start to bad trip... try to keep your surroundings at a funny laugh-it-off level... <br /><br />I find that for me shrooms make me more susceptible to silly jokes and as such I love them with said movies above if I&#039;m gonna chomp some alone...<br /><br /><br />Hopy you have a great time.. Shrooms are my second favorite drug after weed/hash.<br /><br />&nbsp;:P

OP could have a good trip at a lower dose, but I can&#039;t. Same thing with acid. I need to take almost double what most of my friends take to get to the same level as them. Don&#039;t know why, I just do. My girlfriend on the other hand can&#039;t handle even small amounts of psychedelics. Half a tab of acid and she loses herself and starts freaking out. She just smokes a bit of pot when I trip now.<br /><br />I always suggest people take it slow when they first start off. I must be a hard head so I don&#039;t usually suggest my friends and brothers take the same dose I do.

				I&#039;d say it&#039;d be a good idea to have some people you trust around you when you take shrooms. The first time I did them it was 2g of Shroomeister&#039;s and it was nice to have people to interact with if not necessarily &quot;watch&quot; me. One person was especially helpful because she helped me relax and take advantage of how certain things had changed or warped. <br /><br />&nbsp;To me, shrooms are just such a prolonged experience that I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d want to take them solo at moderate-high doses because I&#039;d want someone to have my back if I got bored at my place and wanted a change of scenery. It&#039;s a lot on your outlook and how much you are taking. 2g&#039;s of Shroomeister&#039;s was a great dosage for my first time but it could be low/high depending on what you got. <br /><br />Cheers! And remember to keep a positive state of mind! If you have the option of taking it with drug-supportive friends, go chill with them for a few hours. If not, be comfortable with going through the experience on your own. It&#039;ll be a blast and it&#039;ll be fun! Believe that and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br /><br />

				No matter what type of psychedelic you&#039;re doing, if you&#039;re not experienced with them you need to be in a safe, secure and comfortable environment the first time around.&nbsp; Environment is EVERYTHING (including the people in it) until you&#039;re a bit more experienced with the other side and have a better handle on what to expect on how to somewhat guide yourself through the trip without getting confused or lost.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve experienced the incredible things that psychedelics open your eyes to or study the things you already know it&#039;s a wonderful time alone or in groups, in private or public in some cases once you know how to handle yourself.<br /><br />You don&#039;t necessarily need a &#039;babysitter&#039; but I would highly recommend your first time be with an experienced person or at least someone you absolutely trust.&nbsp; Things can get strange out there and you don&#039;t want to question your company when it does.<br /><br />Have fun and be safe!

				It depends on YOUR personality. I am, by nature, a loner. I prefer to trip alone or with a single other person. I REFUSE to trip with a sober sitter, because he will begin plotting against me sure as anything when I hit my peak, and I just can&#039;t have that, so I will try to out-plot him, and we are then locked in an epic struggle for supremacy of the mind. As we all know, the mind under the influence of mushrooms doesn&#039;t win that battle most times, so my trip is jaded in dark thoughts of revenge (over something that never actually happened anywhere but in my thoughts)<br />YOU might be a very social bird and need to fly in a flock. If you feel that you are only able to have a good time among others while sober or stoned, then you should probably have some trusted friends around with you for your first time.<br /><br />MY first time was alone, and I swung for the fences on dose. It was a blast, and I wouldn&#039;t change anything.<br /><br />So in summation, alone or in a group depending on your personality and nobody can decide that for you. sober sitter OK if your comfortable with them and trust them completely.<br /><br />dose like a rockstar (why should they have all the fun) and you only get one first time, so make the most of it.<br /><br />If you decide to trip alone, write a little note and put it in your pocket before you take off. the note should read something like &quot;you have taken a drug and that is why you feel this way. everything is going to be ok you just need to relax you chose this drug the same as many other people. If you are getting stressed, change your scenery and everything will get better&quot;<br /><br />or make up a laminated card like mine that says &quot;This too shall pass&quot;<br /><br /><br />but the most important thing to remember is to have fun, because life without fun= death

To me my trips on acid seem more structured and things make sense while shrooms always seem to be more chaotic and freak me out more often.

				Have a sitter, better safe than sorry. <br /><br />My best mate saved my life. <br /><br />This thread ain&#039;t about me but ah well, I consumed a box of Hawaiian (14g) and 3/4s of a box of Thai (10.5g) mushrooms whilst in the &#039;Dam in &#039;07.<br /><br />I was so high they tasted delicious.<br /><br />A lot of shenanigans followed. <br /><br />I awoke in a prison cell and didn&#039;t remember my own name, luckily the guy at the station did. I had complete amnesia.<br /><br />I would liken the experience to finding out that your Jesus Christ (very good) and then realising that as a result you have to be crucified (very very bad). You can&#039;t have the good without the bad.<br /><br />The greatest moment of my life. <br /><br />Can&#039;t be fucked going into detail, trip reports are generally self indulgent, and the story is too long.<br /><br />As for your question, the answer is it depends how high you want to climb without a safety rope.
