				Hey Everyone,<br /><br />So while ultimately it doesn&#039;t affect me, I care a little too much about someone that is risking getting thrown out after a labor day weekend that was too fun. They&#039;re getting the home test thing with their parents, and since it&#039;s ... fun I provided that would cause it, they are freaking out and asking me if there is any simple way.<br /><br />Years ago when I had to deal with it, I know the home tests were easily fooled by a few drops of bleach. Since I would rather not go out and spend $29.99 and find out myself, I thought I&#039;d poll here. Search is killing me, and clearnet only has results that are years old, and I know shit changes because kids keep screwing up and parents keep complaining about it...<br /><br />Thus I&#039;m here.<br /><br />Have these kits gotten any better, or is it the same shit where 5 or 6 drops of bleach and its negative across the board?<br /><br />I should note that as it stands, it would fail MDMA, opiates, and THC. I know aspirin used to work wonders for THC tests as long as it was presence and not quantity, the other two I used to put bleach in a dropper or in a measured ziplock in my wallet and just drop it in the urine and stir it.

				Hey, wish I could help, but I&#039;m clueless in this area.<br /><br />If your search turns up nothing, go with what you know, and should it fail at least you will have tried.

				This is somebody&#039;s parents / family asking them to take a drug test? (Sorry, but the first paragraph isn&#039;t clear to me.)<br /><br />If it were me, I&#039;d aim for &#039;fessing up instead of or at least before taking the test if failing it were likely. As a parent, I have a hard time picturing tossing out one of my kids if they came clean to me. (About anything). <br /><br />And as a drug-user, I&#039;m also not a sneak, I don&#039;t hide my life, I&#039;m on some grown man shit.<br /><br />Of course if this is a work or probation related test, then it&#039;s different, and trying to trick the test may be the best choice.

				Dude, it&#039;s not like this can get him thrown in prison or anything... It&#039;s pretty obvious that he&#039;s a wreck and bringing his family down, otherwise why would they be testing him? He should just fess up and be a big man. I doubt that they would kick him out if he just told the truth, and admitted that he&#039;s irresponsible with his habits. I&#039;ve used drugs for years around my parents, and they&#039;ve never made me take a test or ever became suspicious? Why? Because I was able to live a sane life and still love and respect my parents despite my use. Being responsible can get you a long ways.
