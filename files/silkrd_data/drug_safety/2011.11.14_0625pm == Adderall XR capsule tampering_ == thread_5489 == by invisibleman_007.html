				somone f2f wants to sell me some of these.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really KNOW this person but the fact they are XR versus IR has me suspicious.&nbsp; (I&#039;m a suspicious guy by nature what can I say)&nbsp; Other than obvious signs of tampering, how easy is it to seperate the capsules and replace the contents with something else?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				If they&#039;re XR, it&#039;s super easy to open them, dump out the contents, and replace. However the little orange balls inside of adderall xr look pretty unique so I can&#039;t imagine what someone would replace them with if they were trying to pull a fast one on you.

				grrr, that&#039;s not good news :(&nbsp; There are P L E N T Y of scammers in real life just like here on SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s a landmind out there.&nbsp; I&#039;d much prefer the instants for obvious reasons.&nbsp; Kinda hard to fake them.&nbsp; So seperating the capsules is pretty easy huh?&nbsp; So no protective lil seals around the two sections that come together huh :(*

				No not in my experience. But like I said, if you have ever checked out the inside of an xr or if you just look online you&#039;ll see that it consists of tiny balls that are dark and pale orange. I can&#039;t think of anything else that looks like that so I would think your biggest concern would be the dealer shorting you and pouring a little bit out and not so much replacing it completely.

				yeah, I have a xr 20mg here.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see the &quot;balls&quot; through the capsule unless obviously I open it.&nbsp; Thanks for the info, I&#039;ll have to figure out if I&#039;m going with this dude.&nbsp; He wants 5 bux a pill so it&#039;s a nice price, but I don&#039;t wanna swallow rat poison or anything like that hahaa

				If you have an XR in front of you, it should be pretty obvious that you can&#039;t fake those little colored balls.&nbsp; So you aren&#039;t going to get rat poison. :P<br /><br />The only realistic situation is that the guy would short you, pouring a little out of every capsule he sells and keeping it for himself.&nbsp; But at 5 bucks a pill, honestly, you&#039;d still be getting a decent deal.
