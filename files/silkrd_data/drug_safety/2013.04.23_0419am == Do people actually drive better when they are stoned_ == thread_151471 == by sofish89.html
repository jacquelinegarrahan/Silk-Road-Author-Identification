				i always hear people say they drive better when stoned but I have disagree with at least part of that statement. MAybe highway driving, because its all the same all you gotta do is stay on cruise control and stay in your lane.. But city driving, try driving thru rush hour in s major city downtown (manhattan, DC, etc) while stoned, and I dont think the cannabis willl help your case..<br />At least this is my experience

				I disagree really also.. Regaurdless your reaction time is somewhat effected thats a fact..I use to love weed and i have nothing against it, i even order edibles sometimes, LOVE SOME THC M&amp;M COOKES!!<br /><br />But driving and being stoned i get panic attacks or paranoid, and then i started getting p noid anytime i smoked so i stopped years ago..Just benzos and pain meds for me

				Drive better, no... safer, yes, possibly. Your reaction time and thought process is altered, so driving better is not possible.

				Many people think that they are driving better when they&#039;re stoned but the reality is different.<br /><br />The worst time I can remember driving stoned, was when I had to drive through road construction area. You know, the part where they narrow the lanes down so fucking small one car barely fits the width of a lane.<br />I was driving inches away from that concrete wall to my left for miles, every muscle tight as I was sure the slightest movement of my steering wheel would crash us into that wall or other cars on the right.<br />The middle lane is scary as fuck too, as you have to watch out to not crash into cars left and right.<br />In the right lane, the semi trucks will fuck you up so that wasn&#039;t an option.<br /><br />Since I never have a problem with this when I&#039;m sober, my conclusion is I don&#039;t drive better when I&#039;m stoned.<br /><br />

				I just can&#039;t drive while being stoned, every road event makes me anxious and I drive at 8mph. I can drive drunk though, it makes me very impulsive but so far I&#039;ve never had or provoked an accident. Not something I&#039;d recommend.

				Well when your mad fucked up you become the safest driver ever. Afraid the cops are just waiting to pull you over. Ill never forget the first time I did ex. Three friends and I downed 260 mg of pure mdma each and then we got into my friends car and drove a half hour to his house. I remeber us going into oncoming traffic and a bus coming at us, then I remember going off the side of the road, then I remember driving into a baseball field. The rest is fuzzy.<br /><br />On coke I become a fucking race car driver. Or maybe it&#039;s just seems like I am a race car driver.<br /><br />Chaos 8)

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Although cannabis intoxication has been shown to mildly impair psychomotor skills, this impairment does not appear to be severe or long lasting. In driving simulator tests, this impairment is typically manifested by subjects decreasing their driving speed and requiring greater time to respond to emergency situations.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this impairment does not appear to play a significant role in on-road traffic accidents. A 2002 review of seven separate studies involving 7,934 drivers reported, “Crash culpability studies have failed to demonstrate that drivers with cannabinoids in the blood are significantly more likely than drug-free drivers to be culpable in road crashes.” This result is likely because subject under the influence of marijuana are aware of their impairment and compensate for it accordingly, such as by slowing down and by focusing their attention when they know a response will be required. This reaction is just the opposite of that exhibited by drivers under the influence of alcohol, who tend to drive in a more risky manner proportional to their intoxication.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>hxxp://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence

				Being stoned doesn&#039;t increase your diving abilities at all. I may increase your confidence like driving on alcohol does, but when taking a standardized tests it will usually decrease your abilities. <br /><br />Things like parking that require precision will be much harder when using cannabis or alcohol. Driving along a highway may seem to be simple enough though since you don&#039;t actually need to do very much when doing so. Despite that there is&nbsp; a serious risk of simply putting the car on cruise control and dozing off though - something you may not regret until the next turn in the road.

				I&#039;d put it right at the same level as how I am completely sober driving to work in the morning if I didn&#039;t get a good nights sleep. But I definitely drive slower when stoned naturally, speed a lot when sober because I&#039;m alert and feel it&#039;s safe.

				to be honest....<br /><br />everyone is more careful when they get high because its sort of paranoia inducing.<br /><br />(except for some people who admittedly drive shitty while high, and others who get lost because of inattentiveness )<br /><br />it has its pros and cons i guess. depends on the person.

Respecting speed limits, using indicators whenever required by law, stopping fully at each stop sign and such. This may actually attract police attention since no sober person does do all that ;)<br /><br />As far as pot goes i&#039;ve recently seen a documentary where they tested it (can recall the source). In that test it turned out that people performed worse when driving on a closed, predefined track that included some challenges like parallel parking after using some marihuana. For this test they used different people: some that rarely/never smoke, some that do so occasionally (say once an month), but also a daily&nbsp; user. <br /><br />Interestingly the performance of the daily user didn&#039;t decrease much with increasing levels of thc. It seems that tolerance also works when in comes to tasks like driving a car. By the time they came to the end of the experiment all subjects had smoked about a gram of quality pot, and the non-tolerant were driving over the cones whilst the tolerant subject just struggled a bit but did not run over whole rows of cones and such. <br />

				I think driving skills are impaired when people are stoned, but not to anywhere near the same extent as they are when they are drunk. I hate being in a car with a driver who has been drinking, and avoid it as much as possible. On the other hand, I don&#039;t feel very much at risk if I am in a car with a driver who is stoned. Personally I never drive drunk, but driving stoned doesn&#039;t feel as dangerous to me, especially if I am not baked out of my mind.

				Yes and no. I think weed can make you a bit paranoid so that can make you a more cautious driver. But your reaction time is definitely impaired when your stoned, so if you have to break really quick or avoid some quickly your not gonna react as fast as you would sober.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if that makes sense I&#039;m pretty stoned myself right now ;D

				It ultimately depends on the person and the degree to which one is stoned.&nbsp; I personally think I&#039;m really attentive, not to mention I drive right under the speed limit, because like others said, it is paranoia-inducing, so I&#039;m on the lookout for every single thing.&nbsp; If I&#039;m too stoned, things kind of become an obstacle, like a normal trip somewhere will seem forever due to time perception being altered.&nbsp; As a result, I sometimes think I took a wrong turn or got lost, only to realize that I&#039;ve been going the right way after all.&nbsp; In any case, I generally try to avoid driving when stoned; I&#039;ll just have a sober friend drive the car until the time comes when I have to drive myself home.&nbsp; I used to do L runs when I was younger, frequently being the driver while smoking with friends in the car.&nbsp; I realize now how careless that was and how many times I could&#039;ve gotten fucked by the law.&nbsp; DUIs and possession are nothing to fuck around with, unless you&#039;re from a well-to-do family, in which case you&#039;re set for life.
