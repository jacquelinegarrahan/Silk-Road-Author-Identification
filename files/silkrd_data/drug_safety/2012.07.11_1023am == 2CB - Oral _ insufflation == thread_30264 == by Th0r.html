				First tried 2CB 2 weeks ago and I took 35MG oral. I got some nice visuals of it but not overly so. I was still able to if I tried concentrate on things and could &#039;snap&#039; out of it whenever I wanted. It was only really when I was looking at TV/Phone that then visuals would start slowly creeping up and the longer i looked more intense they would be &amp; could do any normal things.<br /><br />This weekend I railed 30mg 5 hours after taking 190mg of MDMA &amp; redosing with 150mg (1 hour 45 in) and oh my, so different. Full on trip. Crazy lights / peoples faces changing slightly &amp; would have no chance of doing normal things very easily lol. When the TV would change channel or something I would snap out of it for only 2-3 seconds before fully back into it. From reading it would seem that 35mg oral should of been quite a high dose but I didn&#039;t get ANYWHERE near the effects is this normal or how much oral would I need to get the same sort of effects or does MDMA in some way enhance the effects?<br /><br />The pain of snorting it wasn&#039;t too bad (it hurt but was well worth it and was expecting worse after reading what other people said) it burned for maybe a minute or so but then it was fine. I did throw up about 10minutes in while coming up which is unusual for me. (Never been sick on anything else) and didn&#039;t feel sick at all swallowing it. <br /><br />So unsure if I should just try 20mg snorted next or to try higher dose oral but with looking at the dosages on erowid etc I think I should of got more from 35mg and I don&#039;t want to try taking 40-45 and it ends up being too much.

It&#039;s also one of the most forgiving phenethylamines and, for me, one of the least likely to give you a bad trip.

				I got it on SR from Ivory who is pretty known for having great stuff and all the reviews for it say the same.<br /><br />Its not that i expected something different to what I got its more the fact that I enjoy it oral and it was nice like you described a nice glowing / happy feelings but just railing it was so much more intense and felt more like a full on trip and I wouldn&#039;t be able to perform many tasks at all compared to when I did it orally and I thought both were meant to be on the &#039;higher&#039; side of dosages but yet what I experienced seemed like a mild dose and a high dose and I would of expected the effects to feel a lot more alike than they did.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember if I had eaten before taking it maybe that would of made the difference thats all i can think off. <br /><br />I have yet to try any of the other 2c&#039;s I do plan to but I really enjoy the 2cb both times.

I know that SSRIs will seriously blunt an MDMA/methylone roll.&nbsp; Not sure what they might do to 2c-b or other phenethylamines.

				No I am on 0 medication and have only taken MDMA / Ketamine / Weed in the last month. <br /><br />Both was measured on the same 0.001 scales so I would of hoped the dosage was at least close to right lol. <br /><br />I think I may take 20mg Oral at the weekend and wait an hour and half and see how i come up and then can always re-dose by snorting with 5-10mg

				Can&#039;t imagine snorting 30mg 2c-b just because most batches usually burn my nose really bad, did it hurt when you snorted that much?
