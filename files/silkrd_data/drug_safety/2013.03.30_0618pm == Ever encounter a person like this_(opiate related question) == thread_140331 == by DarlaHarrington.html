				So last night I was doing H with a few friends and one was worried his girlfriend would get mad he was doing it, so he said &quot;I&#039;ll just tell her it&#039;s Vicodin&quot;. Okay, I&#039;ve encountered people like this before and maybe you can help if you are one of these people. But why would one hate H so much but find pain killers acceptable? It makes zero sense. I&#039;m so curious to hear the reasoning behind this way of thinking.

				Yes, I&#039;ve met plenty of people like that. It&#039;s the culture we live in. Because heroin is never prescribed in the states it&#039;s seen as a dirty drug that only junkies would touch. Doesn&#039;t make much sense but that&#039;s just the way some people think. Stigmas are dumb.

				It&#039;s funny because even if someone is drinking and starts calling people junkies or whatever it makes them incredibly hypocritical. And they&#039;re not even aware of it. Dangerous mind altering substance, it&#039;s all the same. I wish people were more educated in that matter or just shut up, haha<br /><br />Another weird stigma is a coke head or heroin addict gets arrested for assault and automatically it&#039;s because of the drugs, no it&#039;s because they&#039;re a violent asshole. I guess we are all aware of this because we are here. I&#039;m no way saying drugs get a bad rap for no reason because they can obviously ruin lives.. I just wanted to vent a little. Thanks SR. Feel free to vent here =)

				Yeah, I think most people probably hold views that make no sense like this. When I was young it was the the people drinking who said oh my gosh you smoke weed?! get that out of here!&nbsp; They say that with a bottle of rum in their hand which was exactly as illegal. Same thing at some parties where the people were too good for coke and wouldn&#039;t let it in their house and shit like that while they are on an assortment of other drugs.

I more avoid it due to stigma these days unfortunately.

				Well, i think one big difference in perception between H and vicodain is the form it comes it. One is a vague powder sold through obscure channels in baggies, the other is a registered pharmaceutical produced by reputable companies and comes in nice clean boxes with strips of tablets in them. <br /><br />Just at face value that makes the latter look a lot less dangerous, regardless of whatever substance is in them. <br /><br />This often plays a role - also with the issue between alcohol and cannabis. The fact that alcohol comes mostly from bottles produced by trusted companies doesn&#039;t make it a safe drug at all, although it may be true to some degree that &#039;it has not been messed with&#039;, which is hard to guarantee from pot that comes from an illuster plastic bag.

				What&#039;s worse than that are the people who sniff Coke all the time but think Crack is worse. They&#039;ll sniff an 8-Ball a night but laugh at anyone using Crack.

				Considering how the &#039;Heroin&#039; you buy is probably only 10% Heroin at best- if you can get opiates from a pharmaceutical company they&#039;re probably safer.<br /><br />If you were comparing 100% Heroin to 100% of another opiate that may be different- but street heroin is way more likely to contain impurities due to poor production, rather than pills made by a pharma that may have been cut with something once or twice.
