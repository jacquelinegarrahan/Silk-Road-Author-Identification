				Just ingested 3 tabs. I think one with a 25c was nice. So 3 tabs of what was it that big vendor sold, 1000ug?<br /><br />Also on GHB. I am putting virmo_new to shame probably but I guess I will feel nothing of the RC.<br />Seem like having no effect from drugs anymore after (ab)using seroquel for some time...

				Oh we get new bad karma. Thx man. We love bad karma since it means nothing if you watch our feedback.<br /><br />How long did nbome need to be under the tongue? 15 minutes, 30?<br />Only 400ug real acid still works for me. Fractal show all the way.

				Seriously who gives me bad karma and why? Have the guts to tell.<br />It must be our post on BG. He is really good in getting people get a lot of bad karma.<br /><br />Once again, look at our vendor feedback to know the truth. Order something.<br /><br />People still are eager to give bad karma and neglect to give positive karma. Oh well. Smart people know forum karma means nothing.

				Honestly I would&#039;ve expected a lot more bad karma for all the stuff you said on BG, but you didn&#039;t really say anything true so I think they didn&#039;t care (I explained how you were wrong when I replied to that post). People that bash like that usually quickly end up with +3/-15 or something like that.

				stick with the real stuff.. but not get it through sr but from cyber hippies for free..<br /><br />nbome is not handy now because mr tree is helping out and also saying I tell no truth about GHB addictions.. all these topics are becoming too confusing i will leave bg alone.

				Actually realise its in my mouth for 2 hours now and it does work quite intensely.<br /><br />The magic that true acid provides is just not there. It&#039;s like there is no deal like the real deal. But 1 tab of these and one 25c did make it come close to lsd. Or the party did :p<br /><br />Actually it&#039;s time for pms or I go off topics now. Mr tree pisses me off then helps me kindly. Wonder if I deserve good or bad karma, probably bad as usual eh?<br /><br />See you in PM with any questions or replies or otherwise goodbye see you later alligator.<br /><br />Oh and mr tree to be sure: we did not take 25i before filtering so justr hallucinate it turned out clear like how we wanted it and to taste how we recognize it. Although not by close near Xyrem or GB&#039;&#039;s perhaps special perhaps not so special I don&#039;t care anymore sorry for bashing it just pisses me off when people advice to take ghb for whatever reason. But I guess you have to and he does it in a fair way...<br /><br />Or there are other confusements in our discussions but at this point I am unable to discuss this any further...

				Actually i have painful muscles everywhere and wished it was genuine acid since this is an RC and though related, might be dangerous...<br /><br />I never got this pain from lsd.. But i;ve never taken 3000ugs before so maybe that was just half too much...<br />

Those 1mg tabs or even 1.6mg tabs are just way too strong... You don&#039;t see 1mg LSD tabs either for a reason, more is not always better!

Your a vendor? And you don&#039;t even know how to handle drugs safely... As for my view its pretty stupid to take MULTIPLE different research chemicals at once- in high doses- while on GHB, is that what you said?<br /><br />

				Yes I messed up by using that, staying on the forums etc. My team has punished me for that and I apologize. <br /><br />This is not professional at all.<br /><br />My team corrected things now. Redid listing etc.
