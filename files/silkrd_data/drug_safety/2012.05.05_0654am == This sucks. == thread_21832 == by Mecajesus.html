				My sister recently told me that she had messed with heroin, she&#039;s 18 and about to graduate from high school (I&#039;m 20, second year in college). I&#039;ve been messing with heroin for about a year maybe 15 months or so i don&#039;t know. We are both the same person, always down to party, that &quot;go hard&quot; mentality.<br /><br />But it really bothers me that she does that, and she approached me when I came home to visit asking like what my favorite drug is, I could tell she has been messing with some new stuff, i didn&#039;t really think much of it. But when she told me it was heroin, my heart sank. I new she had no idea what she was getting into though. I told her about how once you do it, you will always have that feeling in your head like &quot;Heroin sounds really good right now...&quot; That&#039;s until you actually REALLY need it to survive, luckily I haven&#039;t hit that point yet, weekend warrior (Buy a quarter gram a weekend). <br /><br />I&#039;d rather her be messing with coke, just anything but heroin. So I think i&#039;m going to stop messing with it all together. I don&#039;t like the idea that my sister has done it and has probably done some more since then, plus it sort of ruins the drug for me in a way.<br /><br />So I guess what i&#039;m getting to is, do any of you have anyone really close to you messing with those more addictive drugs? How does it make you feel. Am i doing the right thing?<br /><br />And also how would you react?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If she is just doing it every couple weekend or whatever then there aint too much issue. You should talk to her about how you like that she is one of those people that can handle H and not do it all the time, and you&#039;re glad that she isn&#039;t one of those scumbags that doesn&#039;t have the willpower to control themselves (no offence to anyone reading but it should help him to manipulate his sister a bit).<br /><br />But be mindful of how many people start off that way and get fucked up. Watch her like a fucking hawk. And then as soon as you smell any sign of addiction/problems you gotta step in there and play her heart strings, not ruthlessly but guilt her into stopping or cutting down.<br /><br />I&#039;d just keep stressing that you&#039;re glad she&#039;s the sort of person with self control and not a scumbag.. hopefully she will buy into that and identify with the &quot;party hard but be smart&quot; mentality and then stick to her own constitution.<br /><br />

				yea that does suck.<br /><br />H has the power to really mess up your world if you let it. I would be upset if my sister started using it. I suspect shes been messing with pain pills although she wont admit it to me. <br /><br />I started with vicodin myself and now use every opiate on the market and love to numb out the world with some H. <br /><br />IMO, open communication is the best way to handle this situation. Make sure to check in on her more often, daily if necessary. Talk to her, tell her your concerns, and make sure if she needs anything at all she can come to you and talk. Maybe if you&#039;re serious about quitting, you could try and do it together. Whatever you have to do to get her off that shit before she stats injecting or using daily. <br /><br />Its only a matter of time before you go from being a weekend warrior to a daily user. Right now you have school and other responsibilities to keep you in check, but when you graduate, or even on summer break when you have more free time, its realllll easy to slip into daily using and it just gets darker and darker from there.<br /><br />Ive seen the needle and the damage done. My dad overdosed on heroin when I was a kid and I still use it.......just goes to show you how strong that shit can be. Wish you the best.

				Is she off to college in the fall? If so, I guess the issue could be the summer. I know during my post-high school./pre-college summer I went *hard*...but I wasn&#039;t using Heroin.<br /><br />I&#039;m a girl, with an older brother, and I was reading your post thinking &quot;I wonder what I&#039;d want my brother to do...&quot; (in reality, he&#039;d probably do nothing, he hates me because I&#039;m smarter and more beautiful :) ). My only answer is I&#039;d want him to &quot;stay out of it and not tell my parents&quot; :)<br /><br />But I think you could do several things. You could try and shock her by taking her to some houses that you know of where people are using, or introduce her to some of your friends with serious addiction issues. Or give her that documentary with those 18 years olds in set in San Fran (I think it&#039;s called Black Tar Heroin...you can find it for DL online)...after seeing two of the kids in that I swore never to touch H.<br /><br />Or, alternatively, you could teach her safe using practices and let her make her own mistakes. I know if it was me I&#039;d prefer someone to say something like &quot;I don&#039;t think this is the right the choice for you but it&#039;s your decision. That said let&#039;s talk about keeping it safe and fun&quot; and then give her some guidelines (i.e. if she&#039;s going to IV, teach her how to do it safely...advise her on quantities never to go over [i&#039;d set these low so when she rebels she&#039;s still not doing much damage], etc.).<br /><br />Good luck man...doesn&#039;t sound fun at all :(

I wouldn&#039;t wish that on my sis in a million years.

				I&#039;ve never tried Smack and never would. I&#039;ve never been tempted to do Smack, Crack or Meth as I like to think of them as the unholy trinity.

If you want it done properly then make sure you pay at least £500 for a battering. If you wanted something harsher then it&#039;ll probably cost you £1000+ or if you were stolen from an additional % of whatever was retrieved. You want to ask for well known people in your area as well, don&#039;t use people that just say &quot;Yeah I&#039;ll do it for a few quid mate&quot; because they will either rip you off/not follow through. You have to take you time to find someone who will actually do exactly what you want them to do and not either fuck it up by not doing it/ripping you off but at the same time definitely wont go over the top and do more than what you want.
