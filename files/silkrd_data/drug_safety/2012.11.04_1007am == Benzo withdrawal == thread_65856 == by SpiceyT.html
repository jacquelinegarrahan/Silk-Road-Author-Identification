				Guys a quick question,<br /><br />I was prescribed valium for a condition(short lasting condition) , i was given 50x 5mg, only probably needed 20, anyway the last week i kinda started upping my dosage to 20 mg a night, i have just run out, withdrawals symptom are very unlikely right? So overall&nbsp; i used 50 in around 16 days. I have very little experience with valium up until this point.<br />

				50 x 5mg in 16 days, that&#039;s about 15mg/day. you won&#039;t have a harsh withdrawal, maybe you don&#039;t feel that good for about a week but you won&#039;t suffer from serious withdrawal symptoms. that also depends on how much you took before running out, but valium has a long half life and you only used it at low dosages for 16 days, i don&#039;t see a problem!

				Ok first of all its not the best to suddenly stop Benzos ideally people should taper off slowly but it seems as if you have only been taking them for a short while, why did you start uping your doseage ?? Tolerance level ??? There is a small risk (due to the fact that you have taken them for a short while) of Benzo spasms and you could suffer with depression for a while afterwards due to the fact that the Benzos are leaving your system, ideally you should have someone with you for a few days just to keep an eye on you , if you do start getting Benzo seizures you need to get to a hospital urgently ..You night want to post on here as well , its a great forum http://www.benzobuddies.org/forum/index.php?topic=31378.0.<br /><br />Hope this helps DM me if you want

				I wouldn&#039;t say &#039;very unlikely&#039; but if you&#039;ve never had WD before than not very severe if any at all. 50 Valiums is a lot of Valiums though, and 16 days aint that many days you feel me? It really comes down to that simple schedule and time on vs. time off as well as tolerance makin it worse. You should be okay though.

				I hope you&#039;ll be okay. If you were taking 20 mg a day for a week or so, you could experience mild withdrawal symptoms. It would have been more sensible to break the last 40 mg or so off into 10 and 5 mg doses, but it&#039;s to late to change that now. <br /><br />Given your short period of use i wouldn&#039;t expect anything serious though, perhaps a bit of a restless/jittery feeling, comparable to drinking too much coffee, that will probably fade completely in a few days.

				If you can, just resume your normal sleep pattern without resorting to taking seroquel or anything else. With such a short duration of treatment that should be possible without much of a problem.<br /><br />Having some seroquels available is a good backup in case you really cannot catch sleep some night, but they really are not the hypnotic of choice if you have a choice. If you&#039;re not used to drinking alcohol daily, just having a drink before bed is probably a preferable method to settle your nerves. Also, OTC medications like benadryl (diphenhydramide) can be useful to provide a mildly calming effect. <br /><br />Seroquel is not a hypnotic drug that works like valium at all. While it does have hypnotic effects, i&#039;d consider it a last resort compound if you simply want to sleep;

				This is a great site for Benzos http://www.benzobuddies.org/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=rm0ap8s90914r1h0c545emdcp7 I would only use seroquel very short term but try and resume normal sleep pattern , try and get out go walking or some form of exercise and boost the serotonin levels as they will have stopped naturally occuring.

				i can just agree with HarmReduction and Ben. i also went through a benzo withdrawal after taking different benzos for about 6 months. i took a week holiday from work (you should do that too if you are working/studying) to get over the worst part. i didn&#039;t feel really well after that week, but working was no problem and also helped me to get back to &quot;normal&quot;. for me getting some sleep wasn&#039;t that hard, at some days i slept much more than usually (also during the day). as said one two beers before sleep could help you and if that doesn&#039;t work try dph! but just before bed, when taking them during the day you look like a zombie on acid ;D<br /><br />a good diet and some sport could also help you..

				Good advice all around.<br /><br />You&#039;ll know if the withdrawal gets too bad -- you&#039;ll feel like you&#039;re losing your mind, and not just as a turn of phrase.&nbsp; So if you&#039;re not there, you can feel good about that.<br /><br />benzobuddies is a cool forum and website, definitely agree, HarmReduction!&nbsp; Just as a quick side note, and not to pick nits, but would suggest removing that ?PHPSESSID and everything after it from the link, as it identifies your specific cookied session from before.<br /><br />Good luck, SpiceyT -- it will get better, though it may take longer than you&#039;d think.&nbsp; Benzo withdrawal is no joke, as sometimes when you think you&#039;re done with it, you&#039;re actually not.&nbsp; That&#039;s what people on benzobuddies are referring to as &quot;windows.&quot;&nbsp; But Valium&#039;s got a long half-life, and you weren&#039;t on it for months, so that&#039;s in your favor.&nbsp; Coming off Xanax or the like is generally much worse.&nbsp; But yeah, many cheers, and keep us in the loop!

				I&#039;d recommend seeing a GP or Dr and having an honest talk if you&#039;re unsure. If it becomes too much to bear, you will be prescribed smaller amounts to slowly taper off. 20mg is not a huge amount, but its its not exactly small either; I&#039;ve been prescribed it in the past for similar symptoms and was recommended no more than 6mg a day in 2mg pills. Hope you&#039;re ok, bro.

If you think you have a problem/you&#039;re dependent, then theres a good chance you&#039;re dependent. Benzodiazepan addiction is no picnic, and in extreme circumstances (thankfully nowhere near your intake) can sometimes be fatal for immediate cessation. <br /><br />The idea is that they will taper you off slowly if you are finding it difficult to quit, in a manner like nicotine cessation, week by week. They will move you down to a lower dosage, using another benzodiazepan in 2mg intervals. All I&#039;ve heard from you is a forum post, but if you really think you might have a problem, you can do no harm by making a check up and asking for advice. They are professionals, and will not hold it against you. Check out drugs-forum, they have some great advice there regarding tapering off if you are serious about hitting the nail on the head re: benzodiazapans. Good luck, friend. <br />

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />Yes, from US - Melatonin is very commonly sold here legally as a herbal sleep aid - before ever trying benzos, i used it and benadryl on a regular basis for insomnia.&nbsp; I guess its not legal in other parts of the world, but you can get it anywhere here, and is totally accepted.&nbsp; <br /><br />I understand a doc would give you a script to help you taper down if you were suffering withdrawals, what I assumed was that its totally out of the question that he&#039;d say &quot;Oh, this is working well for you - well dont buy it off the street, let me get you a monthly script for it&quot; and keep me on it.&nbsp; Especially since he obviously wasn&#039;t going to prescribe it for anxiety in the first place (After I told him celexa wasn&#039;t working, he offered to up the dosage, or switch me to an SNRI, and then said no more visits would be needed, because that was basically all he could do).<br /><br />Right now, my experience is that when I have a stressful day/event going on, I tend to take an amount on the higher end of the spectrum....then have no trouble taking slightly less day by day after that....but then another stressful event comes up, and I&#039;m back where I started.&nbsp; Overall, I feel much better than I did before I started taking it though, and keep in good health otherwise (ie eat well, work out on a regular basis).<br /><br />I&#039;m glad there&#039;s both plenty of quality vendors on here for these products (Have a few I&#039;ve used, and they couldnt be more professional), as well as the forums to discuss this kind of thing - I&#039;ve read through some of the horror stories on here regarding benzos (usually much higher amounts being used but still...)&nbsp; and never want to end up in that position.&nbsp;

				its your doc so you can talk with him about your problems/addiction and i bet you are not the only drug addict in your area.. if you have a problems with your gp just go to another doctor, or isn&#039;t that possible for you? as said, every doc, who don&#039;t wanna harm or kill you, will give you a script when you suffer from serious withdrawal syndromes. you will most likely get scripts for small amounts for tapering down and quit your addiction. <br /><br />it sounds like you don&#039;t wanna quit benzos yet!?&nbsp; now you are just taking 10-15mg but i am sure you will raise your dose pretty fast (because of tolerance) and this only makes it harder to quit them. i dont know how old you are, but do you want to take benzos your whole live? how long you took the celexa? they need min 2 weeks to work (wich can be even worse than without any antidepressants), but after some time they should work.. you could take low doses of valium for the first weeks till the celexa is working..?<br /><br />SpiceyT: good to hear you are doing already better! &quot;Just want to have some on hand , in case i freak&nbsp; out&quot; but just buy small amounts, it would be stupid to go trough that withdrawal again when you almost passed it..

				Most GP&#039;s will follow standard protocol with short term prescriptions, including a scheme that involves tapering off benzo&#039;s after a few weeks or months.&nbsp; <br /><br />No good GP would ever suggest you take something like 10 mg valium or 1 mg alprazolam daily and then quit cold turkey after some period of time. Even at these small doses there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, and most gp&#039;s would actually advise taking half the inital dose for a week or so before quitting completely. Obviously you will not be at risk of death if you do not follow a scheme like that, but it makes patients feel more at ease, which should be something any good gp cares about.

				If you are concerned about availability in the future, the only thing i can recommend is to keep a supply that is sufficient to taper off at a reasonable pace at all times. <br /><br />If for some reason you would not be able to source the medication anywhere, at least you have the option to quit decently, albeit not by choice. For benzo&#039;s that would practically mean always keeping at least a month of your regular consumption in stock - not that hard to do. Downside is that you have no choice but to taper down as soon as supply becomes uncertain. <br /><br />Then again, realistically supply for common benzodiazepines may only become expensive, not completely unavailable. <br /><br />

It is a downer to begin with, and at large doses the only pleasurable effect would probably be comparable to being drunk - as in drinking more then is good for you. The recreational use of valium is really limited - most people that use or abuse it do so to deal with something else. I&#039;ve never had the feeling to &quot;lets have a valium&quot; in the same sense as &quot;lets have a beer&quot; at all. <br /><br />As far as you could call&nbsp; in recreational, valium does stop you from worrying in some occasions, and provides a decent nights sleep you may otherwise not get. It can also help with discomfort like muscle aches and such very effectively, but none of that would be considered recreational as far as i&#039;m concerned.

				That varies greatly by location. Dutch doctors are not very inclined to write scripts for benzos, even if you have a perfectly good argument for using then (like, &#039;they proved to work very well for my condition&#039;).<br /><br />I guess pharma marketing has pushed them to the point for prescribing ssri&#039;s for most mental conditions, regardless if it they have been proven effective for a specific condition. <br /><br />This is the eternal problem with pharma patents though: producers benefit most by prescribing substances that are still covered by patents, and do all they can to persuade doctors to do exactly that, even if there is an older medication available that works perfectly well, but is not available as a generic.&nbsp;

				Absolutely. If you are addicted to benzo&#039;s i would recommend always keeping something in the order of 60 tablets of 10 mg diazeapam in storage, if there is any chance you are no longer able to source any bemzo&#039;s at all. <br /><br />Quitting a large benzo habit can be pretty dangerous, and i&#039;d even suggest doctors prescribing a tapering off dose if some patient walks in with this problem. The downside is you cannot rely on all doctors doing so, making it best to keep some supply directly available.<br /><br />The upside is that substances like diazepam actually store very well, lasting decades beyond their expiry date as long as you store them dry and dark.&nbsp;
