				Hi,<br /><br />I cant speak for both vendors so looking for anyone who as ordered from both IvoryUK + Pfandleiher both have MDMA with great reviews however Pfandleiher&#039;s stock is almost 50% cheaper then ivorys how does this reflect in the quality?<br /><br />Insight/reviews/opinions all welcomed.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />-P

				I&#039;d love some more input on Ivory vs Pfandleiher as well.<br /><br />Since I joined SR I&#039;ve been a big supporter of Ivory, his shipping is always quick and the product is always on (or over-weight), and the quality is some of the best I&#039;ve ever seen. Over the past few months I&#039;ve seen other vendors offer cheaper stuff but it wasn&#039;t until today (when I realized Pfandleiher is practically giving his stuff away at less than 7BTC a gram) that I had considered buying from someone other than Ivory. <br /><br />So, my obvious question to SR is why keep buying from my man Ivory? Is his gear really that much better to justify the price? Are his shipping methods on par with Ivory? Is it typically alot riskier to order from Germany as opposed to the UK? <br /><br />Any input/opinions would be greatly appreciated

				I never bought from Germany so I can&#039;t comment comparatively but I buy from Ivory a fair amount and the service/quality is the bollocks. For example I made an order on Friday afternoon and it got to me the next day. His product is some of the best I&#039;ve had as well. Also 2g that I had yesterday was almost crystal clear, perhaps he got a new batch in?<br /><br />

				^^<br />Yeah, couldn&#039;t agree more. Ivory is the man and I&#039;ve never been left anything but MORE than satisfied with him.<br /><br />For that reason I&#039;m definitely apprehensive about ordering from someone new, but fuck if ฿30.83 vs ฿59.89 isn&#039;t a big difference in price for 5 grams&nbsp; 8)
