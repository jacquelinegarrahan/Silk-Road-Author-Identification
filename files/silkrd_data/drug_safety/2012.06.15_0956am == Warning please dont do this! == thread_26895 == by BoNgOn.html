				Please under any circumstances ever EVER never mix MXE Xanax and Alcohol. <br />Please this is not meant to make people curious! And I&#039;m think this was a bad idea just saying this but please, If you wish to recall anything since the ingestion of your drugs and do not want too walk around in a zombied aggressive state, completely unaware of your surroundings, time or even your own existence. Please DO NOT MIX THESE DRUGS. I had a psychotic episode and the police were called( i fucking grow alot of weed and store alot of drugs here) and my parents tried to keep me out my room because of the police standing there 1 door open down some stairs away from 1500w of visible light an plants&nbsp; my parents know about it but it all and all I wanted to do apparently was go to bed, this was after i had completely trash my whole room smashing everything! I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON when 3 police then tried to pull me into an ambulance I fought them off. they manage to convince me I had to go down stairs? got me to the ambulance and hand cuffed me, i then managed to brake free from the cuffs(i shit you not) and then they processed to give me a heavy tranquillizer( they were under the impression i was on 2c-p, my mate that was there was on it, and my mom found like a g of it). that made my heart stop and start on its own they thought i was dead meat.&nbsp; so they made my parents wait 15 before they were aloud to the hospital anyway long story short my body refused to die on its own( thank god) even though i now realized I had ingested 8 of my 50 2mg Xanax then drank 2 750ml bottles of rum well having god knows how much mxe and then had 38 xanxas within 20 hours, before the episode. i only know this cus i only had 2 bottles of rum 50 xanaxs and my parents found the 3g bag of mxe and 2c-p and other things but the bottle was still hidin and there was 4 :O ( my parents left me my chop bowl and bong and weed :) blessed them for that when i got back from the hospital. <br /><br />DO NOT MIX THESE DRUGS!!!!!!! <br /><br />At no point previous to this has any drugs given me amnesia and i have used quite a lot of each on their own an in 2 combos but these 3 should be avoided when used together =) <br /><br />-End ramble- <br /><br />Just read all that and I remember I had a nice fat line of pure coke that my buddy left me( never had coke before) there and actually remember having that when I was semi remembering( had 8 by then and grog only) and then I remembered the reason I was upset and partying for, (something happened with my gf early that day and I HATE DISAPPOINTING PEOPLE)&nbsp; and it just set me off again :O but that was only after the coke o_O so maybe i should add that in as a possible thing that&#039;s not good with mxe alcohol and Xanax.<br /><br />So anyway......

				That&#039;s pretty extreme but I&#039;ve had some binges like that so, I know how it goes. Waking up on the floor to a trashed room and bottles I don&#039;t remember even buying. And for days in a row. Xannys have made me too carefree for my own good a few times, but it is helpful medicine ( I suffer from high anxiety and had issues with panic attacks due to PTSD ).<br />For me, it can be euphoric in a way that induces overindulgence.<br /><br />Sorry to hear how out of control you were and glad you&#039;re safe. <br /><br />Good PSA

				Chill, I really enjoy light doses of MXE with some nice wine or even a few beers. But fair warning to others, this can be a troublesome combination if my tolerance is lower than normal! :o<br /><br />Personally I&#039;ll be Salt River tubing on shrooms, lsd, and god knows what else this weekend with a group of friends. We&#039;re bringing out this huge raft with some sofas and shit bolted on to have a picnic and tan. It&#039;ll be so relaxing! 8)

				This happened 2 weekends ago, haven&#039;t done any drugs since just been recovering. other than 1.5mg of Xanax last night, just to see what the fuck this stuff actually is like on its own(listened to my headphones and felt a nice relaxing body high that mated well with weed and then had about 15mg of MXE and went to bed 1.5 after. I have been feeling perfect for a but 5 days now. I think my brain chem levels have all evened out and I&#039;m ready for some partying. <br /><br />Haven&#039;t had MDMA for months and i used to love the stuff so i might invite my best friend over and we will just have the .3 I have, should be a good night I think ill use the benzo for its correct purpose tonight and have one after i have come down to get to sleep. :) <br /><br />What is the correct dose to sleep with a benzo? 1.5mg seems to have good sedative effects but feels like I&#039;m getting a high feeling, less then sedation. any tips?&nbsp;

The combination of the two produces a compound called cocaethylene which prolongs the high, but is also much more cardiotoxic.

				Kudos - drinking alcohol and using cocaine is dangerous - but in the UK coke levels are so low you&#039;d need to snort a lorry load to get this toxic reaction!<br /><br />And benzo use with alcohol - people do it but it is dangerous!<br /><br />I will NEVER mix drugs that make me lose control in that manner. <br /><br />Benzos ought to left aside for use with benign shit like weed. Benzos are good for coming down off coke. <br /><br />NEVER mix benzos when drunk. <br /><br />You are lucky bro. Lucky not have been busted. You crazy fucking kid! Sort that shit out! Be careful!<br /><br />NEVER bring the police to your door. Stay away from violence and such trouble.

Would never include sr into my mishaps purposely, my hard drive is outside my comp for easy access and I always burn all evidence. <br />I have cut my harvest and have packed it up for good, I&#039;m expecting a search. There is no way they couldn&#039;t have seen light or smell 15 ready plants. So I&#039;m in clean house mode, something I haven&#039;t done for like 6 months. Also someone I know just got done so their pretty stupid and probably let them get there phone etc. So yeah stuff...&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Holy fucking shit.<br />Not sure that this was due to the drug combo so much as it was because of the stupidly heroic doses.<br />I&#039;ve personally had a great night on a loko or two, one bar, and about 200mg of MXE.<br />Glad to see you&#039;re still with us though haha

				Man people. Yikes, what a close call. Be smart. <br /><br />Mixing coke and alcohol is more taxing on the body. Ideally one would not be new to either before combining them together, IF YOU HAVE TO. I am one such. I can hardly drink without feeling nauseous after only a few drinks, well before I reach &quot;drunk&quot; but the cocaine levels me out, and I can put back a bottle of wine no problem over a few hours, or maybe an 8 pack of beer. The alcohol takes a bit of the edge off the coke, as well. Independently, they&#039;re good, but together they&#039;re great. But BE CAREFUL. <br /><br />Mixing alcohol and benzo&#039;s is rediculous. I can&#039;t get why anyone would do this. But then, I don&#039;t know why anyone would use benzo&#039;s recreationally either. It&#039;s just weird to me. I take &#039;em for sketchy morning after&#039;s, so I can stop freaking out. Like maybe once or twice a year.<br /><br />Mixing alcohol and ketamine or mxe is also ridiculous. Makes most people severely sick. My friend power-puked with a very small amount of either once.<br /><br />So, mixing all of these together? Really? C&#039;mon. Be safe.
