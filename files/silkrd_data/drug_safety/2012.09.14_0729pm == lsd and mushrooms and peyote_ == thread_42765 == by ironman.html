				I&#039;ve not done any yet am interested in peyote so am curious about those who have gone tripping on these. <br /><br />What was the difference between the trips about what hallucinations you experienced?&nbsp; is acid more about colors? whereas mushrooms/peyote about visions?<br />

				Terence Mckenna regarded mescaline as the mildest of the classical psychedelics, mushrooms as the most visionary, and LSD as intermediate. This doesn&#039;t exactly accord with my experience -- for me LSD hallucinations can be just as intense as anything I have experienced on mushrooms.&nbsp; However, it is true that a typical mushroom hallucination has the quality of hypnagogic imagery (i.e. the dream-like hallucinations some people experience just before falling asleep), while LSD hallucinations are more reminiscent of the sort of artistic motifs you find, for instance, in Mahayana Buddhist art.<br /><br />It should be noted that hallucinations are only one aspect of the trip, and for some people, they are a distraction from what they regard as the more enlightening components of the psychedelic experience, such as ego-death, the expansion of awareness, etc.

				visuals are always secondary when it comes to psychedelics. that being said, mescaline visuals are much more geometric and pronounced than those caused by lsd or psilocybin, in my experience. it&#039;s also more stimulating, as it&#039;s a phenethylamine. the energy of each is unique; mushrooms are lunar and peyote is solar... acid is more like the alchemical quicksilver. :)
