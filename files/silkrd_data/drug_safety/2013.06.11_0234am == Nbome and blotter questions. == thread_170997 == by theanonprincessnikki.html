				What is the difference between complexed blotter tabs and not complexed tabs? Also the way I take my 25c is by placing it on the upper gum and holding my saliva for 30 minutes. Is there an easier way of taking it or MUST you hold saliva for 30 minutes? Because when tripping with friends it&#039;s just so annoying letting them know how important it is to hold the saliva to get full effects and not everyone likes doing it (including myself)<br />I mean holding your saliva for 30 minutes isnt exactly fun lol,including with that chemical taste. <br /><br />So any different methods? <br /><br />(Besides the anal method lol)<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of placing the blotter somewhere in the nostril I&#039;d like to know more about that?<br /><br />I&#039;ve hear

				Complexedbtabs are nore for freebase nbome as I understand it. For nbome•HCl complexing is utterly uselesscand serves no useful purpose. The only advantage with complexed tabs is with freebase nbome to aid absorption as freedase absorbs lessvefficiently than the salt (nbome hcl). Ive only messed with nbome salts with fantastic results.<br /><br />Never &quot;bumbed&quot; an nbome but insuflation is wild wild stuff. Its of critical imortablnce to dose acurately and in a volumetric fasion imo.Simply railing could be fatal if not careful. I prefer a nadal spray. Better yet, I prefer tabs by miles. Snorting cab be overwhelimg and startling at times.<br />Only exception is 25D whih must be snorted. Tabs are worthless with 25 D.<br /><br />I emblore you do do tons of reaearch before makimg a nasal spray (if you must). Better yet, try to stick to tabs.. its noy sooo bad. Flavor them.<br /><br />Im tired atm but id be happy to steer you safely with nasal spray if you I insist. Just pm, I dont mind.<br />

				As le botbahn said, complexing is useless.<br />I&#039;ve messed with insufflated 25i a lot. I once bought over 40 of Tyl3r&#039;s 25i strawberry snuff caps about a year ago. Each contains 600µg of 25i mixed evenly into a &quot;snuff&quot;, a kinda carrier powder. Snorting these is extreme stuff and you have to have lots of experience with psychedelics! One 600µg cap produces effects about 2-3 times as strong as my only experience with LSD at 150µg. So one cap is about equivalent with three tabs of LSD.<br />One night I wanted to know how far I could go with this chemical (thinking I would do 4~5 caps), prepared myself properly (benzos, weed; no tolerance etc.). Started out with three caps because I had successfully tried two a few weeks back. Then I kept doing more spaced out a few minutes so I would always feel the effects of the last cap before doing the next and ended up doing 16 caps (9.6mg 25i) within seven hours. It was epic and I&#039;ve never hallucinated that hard :D<br />Don&#039;t do that though. Buy a handful of caps from Tyl3r and start with half a cap.
