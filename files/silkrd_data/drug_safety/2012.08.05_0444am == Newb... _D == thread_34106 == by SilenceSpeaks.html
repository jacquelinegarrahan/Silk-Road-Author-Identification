				So....... hmm... What to say. This is the first time I have ever used SR, and also a forum. Lame, right? <br />Well anyways I&#039;ll get to the point, I just ordered my first sack from SR, and Im just amazed that there is a website for this.&nbsp; One reason I searched for &quot;online drugs&quot;, (sounds so stupid! I couldve gotten scammed!) but I feel like I can trust SR from the reviews and this seems like a good community that is accepting, especially towards people who use drugs. So, please don&#039;t judge! If you do, keep it to yourself! Lol<br />I used to be a frequent user of crystal meth, and I havent used in about a year. I ordered a .5g from Rxandmore and I am hoping everything goes well. Im kind of in need of advice, did I get too much?&nbsp; I told myself that I would limit myself to small amounts and not use everyday.&nbsp; I want to be able to sleep each night and enjoy the high during the days I choose to do it. (I even bought ZzzQuil to make sure that I get enough rest.) I want to be able to enjoy this and not rely on it like in my past (I was a stupid teenager and loved the way it made me feel). I feel that I can control myself now, but any advice?

				My advice:<br />Calm down, and take it easy, This is the real deal.<br />You will get really good meth, and what is wonderful is, is that you have to order it to get more (I hope) rather than walk to the corner of the street.<br />.5 isn&#039;t going to get you rampaging down a highway in a u-haul shooting out the window while being chased by the cops, unless you do it all at once...<br />Anyways, my opinion on the whole meth thing... it can be done responsibly, as long as you are not excited by the idea of meth and addicted to the idea of doing it. That ontop of the physical side really gets people.<br />Remember it&#039;s a drug, and you have control over it if you are responsible and control your dosing.

				Only you can know for certain. Reach out if you think you&#039;re starting to develop an addiction, there are people here who will help you, but I think you&#039;ll be fine. Just be careful.

				I know its not like a crazy amount of it, but I just wanted to make sure. Im glad to hear that there are people here to help. I dont want to buy drugs off the street, I dont want to be around those kinds of people.&nbsp; Thanks for the advice :)

				It&#039;s sweet, I enjoy this much more than the streets too. Well, depending on the time of year there are friendly faces with what I need, but nothing like the variety on this place. No way can I can 25i-nbome on the street, and oz of molly costs about twice as much in my area. <br />I do not really understand how this site is so small in numbers. Well, it is steadily growing. <br />Welcome, and in my opinion, let your friends know.<br />Some people do not welcome friends, as they are usually dealing to their town and do not want the competition. Or they do not want LE(Law enforcement) to find out through the grapevine that they even Know about SR. Anyways, spread the love IMO.

				I know right! They have a variety of everything. The more people that join will only make it stronger, IMO. Thanks :) Im glad I found this place. The whole process of bitcoins is annoying but I could deal with it lol. It doesnt seem like law enforcement could do much, considering you aren&#039;t buying goods with actual money.&nbsp; Will do :)

				You are right, the amount of busts that happen as a direct result of SR seems to be 0 from my count. <br />Kind of like the weed-death thing, no real deaths reported but maybe 1 or 2 indirect or people claim car crashes when someone is high is caused by weed. <br />Keep amounts personal and test your luck for a bit.<br />I don&#039;t know how everyone else feels about this, honestly, I kind of would prefer to get an ounce of molly all at once and save it rather than worry about a bunch of separate packs.

				I think that would be the smartest thing to do when you have a good and trusted vendor. You would probably save money, plus less time wasted. I will definitely stay small for now, I dont need much anyhow.

				Another newb here! Just set up my first order (some 25c-NBOMe) after a day and a half of research into TOR, SR, BTC, and the NBOMe family. Having moved recently to BFE, I wish I had know about this place 6 months ago when I scoured craigslist for hookups. So much safer and more friendly here. <br /><br />Best of luck to you all with your choice of poison. Hope you can stay on top.
