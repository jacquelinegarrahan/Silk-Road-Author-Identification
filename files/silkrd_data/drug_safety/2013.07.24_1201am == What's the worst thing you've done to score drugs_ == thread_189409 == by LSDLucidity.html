				I&#039;m not proud to say it but in my teenage years my friends Father had prostate cancer. I had a look through his medicinal cupboard in his bathroom and stole a box of Valium and Oxycontin. <br /><br />The worst thing was I didn&#039;t feel bad about it at all... I was just over the moon I got my hands on that shit.<br /><br />My justification was that he would have no problem getting his script refilled but man... do I feel shit about it now, even so many years later. It was such a horrible thing to do to such a sick man. We live and learn I guess.<br /><br />Anyone else got some guilty stories revolving around scoring substance? <br /><br />LSDLucidity

				I&#039;m pretty sure this is it. SR. <br />I&#039;ve ripped my father off of his weed. He was pissed. I felt bad and apologized.<br />I&#039;ve also robbed my old neighbor across the street of his plants with a friend, but that&#039;s because he got her aunts cat impounded just for the hell of it so it kind of doesn&#039;t count. They were neighbors.<br />It happened twice after that.<br />Eh, I&#039;m not that extravagant.

				I see this thread getting very dark.. I have done some things I am not proud of decades ago.. The thing I&#039;m least proud of is selling dodge pills so I could afford something better. They weren&#039;t dodge in the sense that they made people die; or they were rat poison; or anything a long those lines. Just made people have&nbsp; a really shit night.<br /><br />If Silk Road had always existed and been more free to use things like that would never happen.<br /><br />Long live SR.

				Back when I was a young lad, I was partying, doing Ultram(Tramadol) and Cocaine, well, when I came home, the tramadol was all gone, but I had this really great buzz going.&nbsp; So I look into it, and it turns out the active metabolite(the narcotic agent) of Ultram, O-Desmethyl Tramadol is excreted 70% unchanged in urine.&nbsp; Now, I hadn&#039;t pissed since I took the drugs, so I did what Bear Grylls would, I drank my piss, which was cloudy and tasted like tramadol.&nbsp; I guess the drugs made me do it, because I hate to waste good drugs.

				Me and my mates knew this annoying little fucker who used to think he was some sort of hard man. He used to like us and think we liked him back, so we&#039;d invite him out and make him buy all our bud, get him stoned and paranoid from about half a spliff and then terrorize him into going in so we&#039;d have all his weed to smoke for ourselves haha. That&#039;s the worst thing I&#039;ve done but if you knew the guy, you&#039;d probably do the same thing.

				I have two stories:<br /><br />Probably the worst thing I have done for drugs was steal money out of my Grandma&#039;s purse when she had dementia, I was about 17 and I was very into smoking weed. My Grandma was pretty rich and her memory was so bad that she would not remember who I was, calling me my fathers name. So there was no chance that she would remember that she should have some extra cash. The worst thing is that I justified it all so well in my mind that I didn&#039;t even feel slightly bad at the time. <br /><br />The second one is kind of a long story:<br /><br />Me and a few friends went camping to celebrate finishing and falling our GCSE&#039;S. About 17 we camped out near the sea but got pretty bored one night and decided to walk 10 miles into town to try and get hammered. We scored a load of booze from some shop and proceeded to get pissed. Some way into the night we decided we would get some drugs, we found a prostitute who could link us some cocaine but we didn&#039;t have enough cash so she put in with us. We brought a couple of grams at this bar, she went to go get her bag from inside when we having a sniff in the carpark and we legged it off, leaving her well out of pocket.<br /><br />After which we came to some other carpark down near the beach, here we ran into some lads who were parking there car and got talking about something, (I can&#039;t really remember as I was pretty smashed). <br /><br />Somehow the conversation went on to them selling us some really strong pain killers that we were told would get us high. We brought them and the guy fucked off. After he was gone we smashed the window, broke into his car, stole our money back, plus extra and took all of the pills. This being my drunken idea, even thou the guy was kind of cool.<br /><br />With a 10 mile(ish) walk home our group became separated. Some of the lads I was with got back to the campsite, fucked on cocaine and some random pain medication all for the first time, they decided to steal some bikes. I was left with just one guy and as we got back to the campsite we ran into the group of lads that we had robbed. When we were pissed we had told them where we were camping then immediately forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;I got punched in the nose which was broken and we both got a good kicking. After which we were dragged to our tents, which were searched, they robbed us right back. Set fire to some of our stuff including someones passpost and shoes. The rest of our group had ran off as we were being dragged towards the tents, so it was just me and this one lad who actually did nothing wrong, but got a good kicking. We were now held captive in our own tent while they waited for the rest our young friends to return but they were hiding under a caravan somewhere (hearing us getting beaten up previously) <br /><br />So eventually, the lads who beat us up got bored, they had taken our cocaine, were smoking our weed and deiced to try and nick some stuff from another camper, this guy then phoned the police who turned up and arrested one of the group that were holding us, after the rest ran off. We ended up getting the guy sent to prison for about 18 months after the police asked me why I was bleeding like hell and why our tent was slashed and who owned all this pot.&nbsp; <br /><br />It turned out that the drugs he sold us was just your average pain killers and would not have gotten us high. I got a broken nose, we lost about 500£ someone went to prison and just before the police turned up, they were discussing roping us to buoys since they on the dry beach, then watching as the sea come in. I still like a beer every now and then, but if I just get high bad things don&#039;t seem to happen..<br /><br />I feel bad for the bloke I robbed, even thou he did brake my nose and was planning ways to kill me, I pretty much deserved it all.

				I stole my mothers pain killers once, though she didn&#039;t need them. I didn&#039;t take any of them, instead I told her about it and gave them back.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also charged people insane prices for NBOMe though that wasent as bad as I hated them and they were old highschool acquaintances who fucked me multiple times in high-school. Also I never represented them as LSD, though I&#039;m sure this person probably resold them as acid.
