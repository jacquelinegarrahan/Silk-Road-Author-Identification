				its the same method as cleaning coke.<br /><br />just mix your mdma with some acetone and stir it up a few times this will dissolve everything but the mdma, so then you will have pure mdma. its what i did with 3janes stuff and it turned out amazing.<br /><br />if you have time on your hands you can even re-x it using water :)

All of the cuts will dissolve into the acetone. MDMA / Amphetamine / Pseudoephedrine / Levamisole / Cocaine all will NOT dissolve, and will instead sit at the bottom of the jar.<br /><br />You then pour all of this this through a medium flow filter, rinse the jar with more acetone, pour through filter again, then dry the crystals in the filter between paper and evaporate the acetone off of the powder. The acetone that passed through the filter is full of crap and can be disposed of.<br /><br />What you&#039;re left with on the filter is the goods.<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=29652

				Thanks HanstHoppeble and Calistoner. Quick question though... Does it matter how much acetone you use or how long you stir for? Also, where can you get the right filter for the job?

				well its simple but just takes time and patience, i ended up wasting one gram my first re-x. <br /><br /><br />one you clean your mdma, just dissolve it in a small amount of some purified or distilled water. let it slowly evap over a week or two depending on how much water you use, and then youll have a milky white layer of rock hard crystals.<br /><br />i advise against this if you dont have much molly, the powder from the cleanup is potent as fuck<br /><br />but if you decide you wanna do it i have 2 warnings for you.<br /><br />MDMA does not like glass, it will stick to it and when you scrape it, can shoot off in every direction, makes you very frustrated when you&#039;re trying to conserve it. <br /><br />also, when it is evaporating, when its close to being done, it turns into a clear syrup, that freaked me out and i thought somehow the MDMA had evaporated with the water, so i scraped up the syrup and made a wasteful mess, just let it dry all the way until it is rock hard.

				the contaminates go into the acetone when you clean it. <br /><br />when you have pure mdma, you can dissolve it in water then let it dry and get bigger chunks of crystals. there really no point to this except getting pretty crystals, if you just want to eat it, eat it.<br /><br /><br />

For some reason I was under the impression that washed mdma still wasn&#039;t entirely clean and required a re-x for a few extra percentage points.

I just spend a lot of time on various forums and am parroting that information.<br /><br />1. You want better quality acetone, otherwise it&#039;s going to have a lot of alcohol and water that the magnesium sulfate (epsom salts) needs to soak up. Look for ACS Grade (99.5%). Also, don&#039;t expose it to air! It will suck up moisture from the air; only open it when you need to. I personally use Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate powder that I found at a lab supply company to dry out my ACS Grade Acetone, and this lets me skip the whole microwaving/oven epsom salt thing. Water in your Acetone will dissolve your mdma/etc and send it all the way through the filter (not what we want), even a little bit can kill whole percents of your product left on the filter.<br /><br />2. I&#039;ve heard that many people use coffee filters. I&#039;m sure it works, but generally it&#039;s recommended to find regular laboratory &quot;medium flow filter paper.&quot; I use &quot;Grade 1 Medium Flow Qualitative Filters,&quot; I don&#039;t really know what the grades indicate --Grade 1 is a low grade and this may not be best. They&#039;re pretty cheap, but I presume they&#039;re better than coffee filters.<br /><br />3. I believe it should be white. The rest of the crap should get dissolved, but don&#039;t hold me to this ---I&#039;m really not sure. Someone else here can probably give you a better idea. I&#039;ve only done this with reasonably good quality pure mdma, so it&#039;s already tan/white before I start.<br /><br />4. This depends on what &quot;good&quot; is for you. I believe a dose is usually considered to be in the 1-2mg/kg range. I like it on the higher end, but 1.5mg/kg is very very nice. Be sure to take the majority of it right off the bat, as re-dosing doesn&#039;t work very well. Like 3Jane quoted:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Redosing:<br />Taking more MDMA too long after your initial dose will enhance the speedy effect of the experience, but won&#039;t do much to improve the happy/magic aspect of your roll. Taking one large upfront dose is preferable to redosing throughout the night.<br /><br />&quot;MDMA acts as a releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. It enters neurons via carriage by the monoamine transporters. Once inside, MDMA inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter, which results in increased concentrations of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine into the cytoplasm, and induces their release by reversing their respective transporters through a process known as phosphorylation.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;MDMA will at first releases huge amounts of serotonin, then it will inhibit vesicular monoamine transporters. this makes the serotonin cycle back n forth in the neuron, but more serotonin isn&#039;t going to be able enter into the cycle at this point. Taking more MDMA after a certain point (usually 45-60 minutes user experience shows) won&#039;t do anything for the serotonin feeling, but you may get a rush of dopamine because dopamine is able to rebuild its supply much faster (and its not as inhibited as serotonin).&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
