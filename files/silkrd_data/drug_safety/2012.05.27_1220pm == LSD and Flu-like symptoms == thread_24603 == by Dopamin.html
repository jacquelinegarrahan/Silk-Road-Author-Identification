				Hey,<br /><br />did anyone of you take LSD when he/she was ill? I had mild fever yesterday, stomach irritation and&nbsp; diarrhea. Today I am not really hungry, but the D stopped and I feel I am on the road again. What would you say, is dropping acid a good idea now?

That&#039;s some backward philosophy in general because it a depressive state is usually a bad breeding ground for a trip. However, I&#039;ve never felt better physically OR mentally afterwards a trip (after the first few times of experimenting with the right dosage of course). Plus acid is known to give a boost to your respiratory system and I hock up all my cigarette mucus when tripping. So who knows, it actually might be beneficial to you since your sick 8) <br /><br />Drop a multivitamin beforehand if you can to help your system.

				In my experience, taking LSD while you&#039;re sick makes you feel even worse. The enhanced perception makes nausea, headaches, dizziness, etc., even worse. Also, taking a shit while on LSD is very unpleasant.

Actually, keeping in mind what acid does, it is indeed all about perception. If you think you can handle acid whilst ill, go ahead. If not, don&#039;t set yourself up for a bad trip. That last part about taking a shit; call me weird, but it&#039;s kind of a funny experience. The enhanced sense of smell however, is quite unpleasant.

For me at least.<br />I had one of the best shits of my life on LSD last night. It just feels weird afterward, like you can&#039;t wipe your ass clean even though you&#039;ve got it 110% clear.
