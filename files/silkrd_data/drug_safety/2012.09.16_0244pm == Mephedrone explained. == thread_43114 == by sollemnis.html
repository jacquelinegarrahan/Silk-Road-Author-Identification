			<dd class="postbody">
				Ok, so recently there has been a lot of people asking questions about Drone. Or people asking about the best &#039;RC&#039;s&#039;. I&#039;m constantly giving people info about Mephedrone. So now I&#039;ve decided to write a thread about it. <br /><br />I&#039;ll try to explain how it feels the best I can - What doses to take - How long it lasts - It&#039;s relation to MDMA and other drugs.<br /><br />Originally, Mephedrone was an Ecstasy replacement. People took it because it was legal, and therefore easier to get hold of than MDMA. Now, even though there are some similarities between the two drugs, there&#039;s also a lot of differences. (At least in my experience). Everybody reacts differently to every drug.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to start with what Mephedrone and MDMA have in common in terms of effects -<br /><br />Music Appreciation<br />Empathy <br />Pupil dilation<br />Increased temperature<br /><br />Now with MDMA, you feel love for the world and others around you. On Mephedrone this feeling is slightly different, you don&#039;t feel &#039;love&#039; for others - It&#039;s more of a feeling that people are AMAZING... The world is amazing, everybody around you is amazing. <br /><br />Mephedrone has similarities to Amphetamine and Coke, these being - <br /><br />Stimulation<br />Euphoria<br />Talkativeness<br />Feeling like superman<br />Increased self confidence<br /><br />Now even though MDMA gives people a feeling of euphoria, Mephedrone euphoria is more like Coke&#039;s euphoria... It&#039;s a LOT more stimulating than MDMA, as MDMA isn&#039;t too stimulating - Hence why it was known as the &#039;relaxing Amphetamine&#039;.<br /><br />I&#039;d describe Drone as the perfect mix of Coke, MDMA and Amphetamine. It has all the best properties of the those three drugs - With its own unique feeling too. Personally Drone makes me more talkative than Coke and Speed.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve left the peak of an MDMA roll, you can&#039;t bring back the peak effects. (Until your next roll 2+ weeks later) With Mephedrone re-dosing brings back the peak effects. Which is why it&#039;s really fiendish.<br /><br />A typical dose of Mephedrone is 100-150mgs when taken nasally. The peak effects only last 30-40 mins. Every 30 mins taking a 50mg top up brings back the peak effects.<br /><br />When taken orally 250-300mgs is a good dose, for a nice intense (But not too intense) experience. Peak effects last just over an hour, with residual effects lasting a good 3 hours.<br /><br />What I like to do is parachute 200mgs, then snort 100mgs. I find this gives the intensity of taking it nasally, but the duration of taking it orally. <br /><br />Overall I rate this drug a good 10/10... IMO its more euphoric than MDMA - However MDMA is an overall more pleasurable experience.

				Thanks for this posting have been interested in the whole MCAT for a while did a study in Ireland on injecting mephedrone users , can you tell me have you noticed a difference since the ban came in , in various countries, people have told me that the MCAT you get on the street is worse , the come down is worse etc

				Holly - Any proof of this? I&#039;ve never heard that.<br /><br />HarmReduction - Pre ban Mephedrone had more of a &#039;fishy&#039; smell to it. The Mephedrone on SR doesn&#039;t have as much of a smell. Also the drip of the pre ban was more pleasurable - Made me drink a lot of liquid but that was about it. The Drone now gives quite a bitter drip. I&#039;ve tried Googleyed&#039;s Drone - Was rice grain like crystal. The pre ban was more sandy crystals. <br /><br />In terms of quality, the Mephedrone on SR is good quality (Limetless once stocked actual pre ban Drone). I&#039;ve never tried Drone from the streets, but I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s a mixture of legal RC&#039;s containing very little Mephedrone.

				Mephedrone is definitely my favourite drug, only acid comes close to beating it really.<br /><br />It just seems to be the best of both worlds. You get the love and empathy of MDMA (though not quite as strong) and the talkative energetic vibe of meth, not to mention the music appreciation and good stimulation. Some of the best nights of my life have just been doing mephedrone with close friends, listening to music and talking shit all night. Also, the rush is crazy, and it&#039;s so funny to all go through it at once.<br /><br />Been searching for that pre-ban stuff for over a year, to no avail. Though Limitless&#039;s new batch sounds very promising.

Lim&#039;s old product is good too - Nice clean euphoric high.

				I would advise against re-dosing orally. I find 200-300mgs&nbsp; to last 90 mins to two hours when taken orally. I would then do 50mg lines to top up. This brings you straight back to the peak, and sometimes I actually peak HARDER on the 2nd-3rd dose. I&#039;m like &#039;fuck me&#039;&nbsp; because it hits me pretty hard when I top up.<br /><br />Yeah it doesn&#039;t last as long as MDMA BUT, as phatnonpatness said, re-dosing works really well. So the overall duration is longer than MDMA&#039;s, because with MDMA re-dosing doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />Oh yeah and if you want to play it safe, don&#039;t exceed a gram in one session. A gram is plenty for one person. I would then wait a week until using again. <br /><br />

				That&#039;s a strong recommendation&nbsp; :), there are just a few things I&#039;d like to know. <br /><br />Is there any evidence that it&#039;s addictive (as in the same way coke is addictive, not physically but maybe mentally)?<br /><br />And are there any long term side effects I should be aware off?

				There has been reports on Bluelight of people becoming hooked. However IMO this was because it was legal, cheap and a good buzz for the buck. <br /><br />I find when taking Drone, there&#039;s a strong desire to re-dose. BUT, once its wore off, I have no particular craving to use again. The comedown isn&#039;t bad either, so I don&#039;t need to re-dose to stop feeling like shit.<br /><br />No long term side effects that I know off. But take caution when using (this goes for every drug anyway). I&#039;ll look this one up actually, as far as I&#039;m concerned (and in my experience, baring in mind I&#039;ve used it quite a few times) there&#039;s no long term effects.

				It is quite addictive so you do have to be careful. The urge to re-dose doesn&#039;t seem to escape anybody, especially their first time, and you will find yourself wanting more. But before you get to the end of a gram of the stuff, the effects will mostly stop occurring and more dosing will just provide prolonged stimulation. <br /><br />Once you&#039;ve experienced this, you&#039;ll have an easier time stopping the next time. Granted, it still is a challenge.<br /><br />Some people seem to go on 2-3g binges sometimes. Though I suspect this was mostly before the ban. I would highly advise against this, not only is it dangerous, you will end up wasting product.

				Cool thread, likes it, done more Meph than 90% of people that do it so I thought I&#039;d chip in. <br /><br />Meph is cardiotoxic BUT HAVING SAID THAT it doesn&#039;t have to be as cardiotoxic as people think. Depends if your shit is clean or not which you can generally gauge on Meph by how grimy you get at what rate. My new Ultra Crystal it takes me ages to grime on, much more so than my powder product or the Chinese pre-ban stuff I found in my loft. I can do up to 1g of this without cracking a sweat, even on the primary areas which are the scalp and your hands. Every time I have tried the new product thus far I&#039;ve needed to push to a 2g+ binge to achieve the grime, the first time round it was 3g+ and both times this was over a 24 hour period. <br /><br />Combining it with Blow has the best results, it basically gives you a body orgasm if you get the ratios right. Combining with MDMA can be hit or miss, I&#039;d recommend hitting the Mandy first and then doing Meph on top of it because the reverse can sometimes mean Mandy doesn&#039;t work at all. Smoking puff with it, I dunno I don&#039;t really do that much but it&#039;s quite enjoyable I suppose. I don&#039;t really like puff so I&#039;m not the best person discuss this. <br /><br />Addictiveness. This is a bit of a hot potato, some people say it is physically addictive and some people don&#039;t. I certainly think that someone could quite easily become psychologically dependent on Meph. Although I haven&#039;t disclosed this before because I don&#039;t like to discuss it I feel I have sailed quite close to the wind on this issue a couple of times but I do think, having said that, it is a drug you can quite easily reign yourself in on. It&#039;s not like Cannabis in that it has a culture of doing it casually but then I have heard tell of there becoming &quot;Bubble Houses&quot; or &#039;Bubble Shacks&quot; in the North of the U.K where people do it for days on end but at the same time they are buying it for £10 a gram there so I highly doubt what they are getting is the genuine article, when it&#039;s cut with Amphetamine which it frequently is it is much more physically addictive than when it&#039;s kept as the pure product. <br /><br />Most will need strong willpower to put it down because it&#039;s more moreish than anything. It&#039;s a drug that like Blow, once you pop you just can&#039;t stop. <br /><br />Anyway, lecture over. Have fun! Especially if you are buying my new product. So far it&#039;s had some very nice feedback. :)

				&nbsp;Mephedrone combined with M1 is good too. It gave me euphoria to the extent where I just wanted to scream because I couldn&#039;t contain it. My chest felt like it was going to shoot off in to space I was that buzzed. Honestly, it&#039;s the most euphoric combo I&#039;ve ever done. Never tried the Blow + Meph combo Limetless has mentioned, but I&#039;ve read how good it is! <br /><br />

				I tried limitless&#039;s high quality Mephedrone and it didn&#039;t feel anything to me like it did to everyone else I gave it to. I took a good deal of it, probably like 200 mgs oral and then 150 mgs intranasally and experienced really strange effects...<br /><br />I peaked for WAY long, and it wasn&#039;t a stimmy peak, it was pure relaxation. That being said, the only stimulant that has ever made me buzzy was MDMA or Methylone.<br /><br />The build-up was really gradual. I did it probably around 10 P.M. and didn&#039;t peak until around 1 or 2 in the morning, then was plateaued until I went to bed around 5.<br /><br />I was tired, but not sleepy - as in, I couldn&#039;t fall asleep if I tried. <br /><br />I had no empathy whatsoever for people. Didn&#039;t even want to talk to folks, really. Just sorta wanted to lay back and close my eyes.<br /><br />Music sounded like shit to me. I couldn&#039;t find a song on my ipod that was good. Whereas on MDMA or Methylone everything sounds good to me. I eventually wound up riding home in silence.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t shut my eyes. I would be driving for like 10 minutes with my eyes open not blinking until the road sorta faded into a blur and then I&#039;d realize what I was doing and blink a few times.<br /><br />But what was the weirdest thing was that when I began driving home ( I had taken the mephedrone at a friends house about an hour and a half away ) I began to experience hallucinations. Now, that&#039;s not saying much, because when I&#039;m tired I hallucinate anyway, but this was different than the hallucinations I usually have when I&#039;m tired. It was more whimsical whereas my tired hallucinations are very realistic.<br /><br />Like, I saw a snow white dog in the road and as I got closer it turned its head to look at me but when the car lights enveloped it it disappeared into a misty substance. I was seeing like will o&#039; the wisp type deals flying across the sky in front of me for a while, too. Just real weird shit. I&#039;m really sensitive to hallucinatory experiences from stimulants in general though, especially if I&#039;m tired as well, so I&#039;ll just chalk it up to that.<br /><br />Everyone else I gave it too had a really good time, though. They were really chatty and talkative and didn&#039;t understand why I was so mellow. It was weird.

It was definitely very fun. And stimulant-induced delusions are pretty awesome in general. At least for me. Mine are usually pretty benign, anyway. I&#039;m definitely not saying there was anything wrong with your product at all. Especially considering everyone else was having a ball and I was the one that felt different.<br /><br />Stims in general chill me the fuck out, though, I&#039;m a pretty off-the-wall person normally. The meph sorta reminded me of a more euphoric, less grimy/stimmy adderall. But my friend who had done meph before had told me it was way better/ way more MDMA-esque than M1 which I found quite untrue. <br /><br />Good stuff though. I&#039;d do it again, though I&#039;d probably want to do it alone rather than with people. Seems like something I&#039;d just want to chill out and lay around with.

I had been up for 24 - 36 hours too. That would explain the hallucinations. They didn&#039;t mess my driving up too bad. After I saw that mist-dog I was just sort of like &quot;Oh, I&#039;m seeing things. That&#039;s cool I guess.&quot; Usually when I&#039;m manic I stay up, and when I stay up for more than 24 hours I see shit. Stims make it worse, so that explains shit.<br /><br />And I&#039;d say it was a good 6 - 7 days from when it was market in transit. Which is amazing to me. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s standard UK - US times or what, since I&#039;ve only ordered overseas a few times and they&#039;ve all taken hellishly long to get here. I&#039;m the sort that when I make a decision to buy drugs, I want to do them immediately, so the wait is the worst part of it. lol. Definitely gonna see about ordering from you again. Really interested in yer 4-ACO &#039;cause the demand for shrooms around here has been INTENSE. Once I tell folks what 4-aco is and the price I&#039;d charge for it they go bonkers. And I can make a killing charging the same prices as they&#039;d pay for legitimate shrooms. So that&#039;s gonna be my next purchase...

It&#039;s definitely something I&#039;d like to give another go when I don&#039;t have as many people and can get a few good redoses in. But I just sorta got it on a whim while I had some extra cash in my account and wanted to try something new. Next time I&#039;ll have to get more like maybe 5 or 10 grams or so. Then I can have a *real* party. Probably will have to get a carton of cigarettes, too. I chainsmoke like no-other on the stuff.

Back before I had access to good drugs I even enjoyed getting ephedrine from the local gas station. I&#039;ve tried everything, or AT LEAST one of each class of drugs and the absolute only drugs I don&#039;t like are benzos. All they do is make me really nauseous and slightly body-drunk with less of the cloudiness of alcohol. And I&#039;ve never been a fan of drinking either, really. I do enjoy opiates but all-in-all depressants aren&#039;t my cup of tea.<br /><br />My drugs of choice in descending order would have to be : MDMA, then Methylone, Cigarettes, then pretty much any stimulant, then hypnotics ( namely Ambien ), then psychedelics ( 2c-x compounds in particular &#039;cause they&#039;re cheap and I like the way they make my face look in a mirror ). I will drink or do benzos if they&#039;re there, but I don&#039;t like it. I&#039;m less addicted to a particular substance and more addicted to an altered state in general. I&#039;m so messed up psychologically from a lot of childhood trauma that if I&#039;m not anhedonic while I&#039;m sober I&#039;m thinking of real fucked up shit. I figure it&#039;s in my best interests and the best interests of others for me to stay fucked up as much as possible. I&#039;d say the meph ranks pretty high in the &quot;any other stimulant&quot; category, just behind dexedrine and just in front of adderall. <br /><br />I really wish more of the substituted cathinones had empathogenic qualities to &#039;em. I just want an empathogen I can do on a more regular basis than MDMA. Methylone is really good and all, and I&#039;ve done it for a week straight without too harsh of a comedown, but after a while it just starts to get stimmy and loses the magic. I guess thems the breaks with serotonergic drugs, though. Tolerance builds quick as a motherfucker.

I&#039;ve been making a good bit of cash lately though so I might give it a go sometime or another. I&#039;ve probably been abusing drugs for 3 or 4 years, a good 2 of those spent with that newbie toker attitude of &quot;I&#039;ll never go past weed&quot; and then I realized a lot of my anxiety was coming from smoking weed so I might smoke once every 2 - 3 months now if I&#039;m around my stoner friends. Back to blow, however, the only contacts I have for that are some of my old college acquaintances and they&#039;re a bunch of pompous dick business majors. Real cunts but they know their stimulants.<br /><br />I wish there were some good Cocaine analog RC&#039;s out there on the market so I could get more for my money, though. Even some opiate analogs would be nice. I was thinking of getting some tramadol but I don&#039;t really know how that stacks up against other opiates. Only opiates I&#039;ve tried have been hydrocodone, codeine/prometh cough syrup, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, and I TBH liked the codeine/prometh syrup the best. But I really like the lifelike hallucinations that tons of promethazine gives me. Adds a real crazy layer to an opiate binge.

Black market economics just runs through my blood. I remember being in Junior high selling bootleg DVD&#039;s &#039;cause I was the only kid with a broadband internet connection and a decent DVD burner. 5 bucks a pop and I upcharged 2.50 if someone made porn. Gave me enough money to get video games with which is all I gave a shit about. Then high school came and I started selling weed and bullshit. Would take 700 mgs of benadryl, crush it up, and put it in capsules and sell it for 15 a pop after telling people it&#039;d make them see shit. Junior year I actually started doing the shit I was selling and after that it&#039;s been one big fun downward spiral into debauchery and abuse. I hope my synapses will forgive me in a few decades. <br /><br />My plan is to go to some university for organic chem and then specialize in psychopharmacology so I can actually have a mind enough to cook shit up without blowing up my house. Tried cooking meth once in a fit of mania &#039;cause I fell in with a bunch of older ( 35, 40 yr old ) methheads in the neighborhood and wanted to surprise &#039;em. Then I sorta had an existential breakdown and decided against going along that path of existence. Still would like to learn how to cook MDMA or Methylone, though. If just so I wouldn&#039;t have to wait a week for it to get to my mailbox &#039;cause fuck buying that shit locally. Last time I did that I wound up getting BZP or some other nervous stimmy bullshit.
