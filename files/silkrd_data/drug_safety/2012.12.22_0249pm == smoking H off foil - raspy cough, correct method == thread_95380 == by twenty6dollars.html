				Hi all,<br /><br />Just wondering - I&#039;ve been smoking #3 Afghan Heroin on and off for a few months now, and have dabbled with white #4 whilst in Asia in the past.<br /><br />My method of ingestion has always been to chase off of foil with a cardboard tube in the mouth. And using this method, I have ALWAYS developed the following complaint...<br /><br />What I find though, is that after a couple of nights of doing this, I invariably develop a raspy cough, which is quite persistent. The kind of cough that wakes you up at 3am all raspy and struggling to breathe. (I have since been prescribed asthma medication, which seems to help somewhat) The cough often lasts more than a week, and generally becomes so pronounced and persistent that I end up pulling a muscle in my stomach, which makes all further coughing (and sneezing) quite painful. Coughing fits become common, and can only be tolerated by doubling over and exerting pressure with my hand into the right side of my abdomen, where I assume the pulled muscle is located.<br /><br />After doing some research, it appears that the smoke off of foil method is the most highly recommended, so I&#039;m wondering if perhaps I&#039;m doing something wrong. Holding the flame too close to the foil, so burning it and inhaling the contents? Trying too hard to burn everything off the foil, causing more foil oxidisation? Doing too small amounts, too large? Or do I need to just forget smoking and go back to snorting?<br /><br />What I&#039;d love is for someone with more flying hours up to explain how they smoke their H - and feel free to ask me any questions about how I&#039;m doing it...<br /><br />so anyways, thanks for your help in advance<br /><br />26$ gooddopegoodfun

				Sounds like you have the flame to close. Now, i normally develop a sore throat after smoking H in general, but i have notice i will develop a cough if my flame is too close. Sometimes leading to sharp chest pain, extreme tightness, and this can be quite alarming if you haven&#039;t experienced it before. <br /><br /><br />I would suggest practicing your technique, using a smaller flame, and taking smaller hits, and taking breaks between hits. Remember, take your time. It only takes one bad hit to ruin the night.<br /><br />Oh, one last thing. Make sure you&#039;re buying brand name &quot;Heavy duty&quot; foil. Reynolds wrap is the go to brand. Use new pieces as often as possible also since using the same piece, you&#039;ll eventually get holes which will burn your dope leading to a bad hit. <br /><br />I hope something i posted can help and i hope you get feeling better. I personally know how yucky a bad hit can make you feel and ruin the night. :/<br />

				I&#039;ve often wondered, and apologies if this is a stupid question<br /><br />Is there a reason for using foil instead of a meth pipe to smoke H? isn&#039;t it the same process (i.e. heating from underneath and smoking the vapour)? Wouldn&#039;t a meth pipe be easier / safer?<br /><br />There must be a reason or people would already be doing it, just wondering if you&#039;ve tried it<br /><br />:)
