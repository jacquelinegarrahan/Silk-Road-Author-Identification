				&nbsp; &nbsp; Good day all, have another question for the great SR forums. I just got some super super pure MDMA, tested clean with two tests and was legit through my experience. I capped a few .110&#039;s (also added .75 MDA) for me and my friends and we all went out to a Fedde Le Grand show. The MDMA hit us but it wasn&#039;t what we were expecting. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It made us all very mellow and lethargic, we just wanted to sit in the lounge section and chill. We were yawning every now and then, which was pretty annoying since I&#039;m used to rolling hard and dancing on the floor for at least 3-4 hours. We got the euphoria, the openness the love-doviness and the tactile enhancement. But the &#039;chilling on a cloud&#039; feeling was frustrating as I love the push my MDMA usually gives me when I&#039;m at a club or concert. All of my friends complained that it made them too mellow as well.<br />&nbsp;<br />TL;DR-&nbsp; &nbsp;So my question to you is, what can I add to my MDMA to lift me up and want to dance rather than sit and hug all night. I would optimally like to mitigate the crash as well (there was none on this stuff, which was a +) so caffeine, coke and speed are out of the picture for now. I was thinking maybe some B vitamins, maybe 2c-i but I would like to hear what you guys have to say!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s interesting, that is how I&#039;ve nearly always experienced and enjoyed MDMA. Psychedelics make me dance, MDMA chills me way out (at least back when I did it). When I did want to dance in those times, I would find some hits of &quot;ecstasy&quot;, because it had what I like to call the &quot;party mix&quot;. With the party mix out of the picture, I think you&#039;d be looking at proper pre-loading, to which there are many guides on the web. I would think that, if dopamine is the main neurotransmitter involved in the speediness of the experience, you could consider pre-loading with L-tyrosine. Tyrosine is an amino acid and dopamine precursor, and is available in health stores. I would check that for consensus. <br /><br />A light psychedelic would maybe find you the grooviness in the music. I&#039;m not a big fan of mixing and would just side with acid any day of the week, but that is a different experience all together.

That should get you guys going hard.<br />There would clearly be some sort of crash though so treed carefully. <br /><br />Most people I know who are somewhat not satisfied with pure molly are in fact missing the amphetamine aspect to the roll. <br />I personally love the mellow yet intense roll of 160-200mg of pure MDMA. Thus only truly falling in love when I got my hands on well, SR really.

We actually took 75mg of brown MDA with the new MDMA batch (I know its buried somewhere in my original post). This appeared to be the sweet spot with our old batch of MDMA and the one before that: 75mg MDA to 110mg MDMA. For some reason that sleepy feeling overpowered the MDA energy, tho the visuals were retained. Could have been that we were just too damn tired physically for even substances to help xD.<br /><br />I am a little wary of pure amphetamines though. <br />On the other hand I heard GHB is a good mix with MDMA, especially when redosing.

Even if you added stims, a small benzo dose and maybe a drink at the end (GHB? never tried it but heard it&#039;s great) would be great. Also bear in mind, that perhaps what you are seeking is not what the drug is necc. intended for! But of course, you can def. tweak it to suit your needs.

				^ Yes.&nbsp; A medium dose of caffeine is the way to go, many of the most popular batches of pills contain a decent whack of caffeine so that is probably what you are used to.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mixing other amphets with MDMA makes the whole process more neurotoxic,&nbsp; and does dull down the empathetic effects.<br /><br />You should also remember to try and get lots of sleep the night before, or even get a day sleep,&nbsp; eat light and healthy and drink plenty of water.<br /><br />Since the advent of SR, I have discovered that mixing all of the best batches of MDMA I get into one stash seems to bring out the best attributes of each batch into one awesome roll.&nbsp; Not sure if it is because you get a better racemic mix, but I would like to think so. <br /><br />The differences between positive/negtaive isomer MDMA could also be a factor in how energetic you feel.

				Smoke some pot, it will push the MDMA super hard when smoking a huge bong hit. 2C-B and MDMA is great but I would never do it in a public or club situation as the 2C-B is much to sensual for that, it could be an overload of haptic stimulation (feeling/touching of your skin) and any discomfort, even if it&#039;s very minor will come to your attention more.<br />Also you will want to have sex instead of dancing with 2C-B. ;)
