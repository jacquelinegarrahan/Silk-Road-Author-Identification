				Just wanted to warn people there is a danger associated with use of 25I-NBOME which has caused a number of deaths already<br /><br />PLEASE BE CAREFUL<br /><br />Those distributing the drug are being charged for the deaths of these people, one man even facing murder charges - so please be careful and use some caution before handing it out to your friends - one is facing a mandatory minimum of twenty years<br /><br />A couple of these cases report it as lsd or 2ci but this is just misinformed statements by the media. general consensus is that all these deaths are caused by a sensitivity to 25i that causes potentially fatal seizures. the ones with links grouped together are for the same case and include links to forums discussing how it was nbome rather than lsd or 2ci in each case <br /><br />Reports of 6 deaths:<br />http://www.wral.com/warrants-cary-teen-involved-in-lsd-sale-that-killed-apex-teen/11697353/<br />www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/649693-Apex-student-dies-after-taking-LSD-another-teen-charged<br /><br />http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2012/06/adam_budge_18_charged_with_murder_following_friends_synthetic_drug_overdose.php<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=188208<br /><br />http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20120820/ARTICLES/120829975?p=1&amp;tc=pg<br /><br />http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/11/21-year-old_dies_after_one_dro.html<br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/629949-25i-NBOME-Overdose-Leads-to-Another-Death<br />http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/06/21/2-face-charges-in-synthetic-drugs-case-in-nd-mn/<br />http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/10/29/man-accused-of-making-deadly-drugs-pleads-guilty/<br /><br />------------- <br />TL;DR:<br />this is a summary by erowid confirming these deaths were caused by 25i:<br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome_death.shtml

				really glad you posted this bro my friend keeps buying this shit and selling it I&#039;ve told this dude numerous times this shit is no good and there is a reason its so fucking cheap no amount of money is worth someone dying over I&#039;ve been there when someone tried to sell us fake acid before and long story short someone ended up getting shot and everyone went to jail bottom line is fuck the profit margin i have a guilty conscience and couldn&#039;t sell someone shit that isn&#039;t really what it was I have a real job anyways but rc&#039;s fucking suck anyways imo i&#039;ll stick to what i know and have always held up lucy,molly,shrooms,weed but people do whatever you like but i advise not re-selling this shit it&#039;s not a hard choice really lets see 5-life in jail or $500+ in profit not a hard choice in my opinion but like i said i work a legit job and dabble on the side just really&nbsp; think this shit over i for one don&#039;t fuck with shit that has the possibility of killing someone you never know what pre-existing medical conditions the buyer has or how loose his fucking lips are to me there are things more important in life than making a fast dollar yeah money is nice but its not so nice when some of that money comes from someone losing their life over

First i was out for an hour just collapsed spasming on the floor second time was about an hour after in the middle of a city however my friends told people i was an epileptic. Third time was a fuck up the other week of which i only did it again because i believed the first seizures to be results of some E pills we had at the time. Now i have seen all this i am definitely not touching them again. I have 30 tabs of the stuff i will probably just flush them down the toilet as its clearly not worth the risk giving them to someone.

				some member has posted twice about his experience, he claims he had two seizures. What he may not have realized was how close to fatal seizures are.<br /><br />as for the dose: obviously with a percentage of people even twice recommended could be a problem. Compare to something like LSD where the worst outcome of a uber megadose is &quot;merely&quot; pyschosis. How do you know a blotter has been perfectly dosed? there are too many well understood drugs to dick around with, you&#039;d have to be a real fiend to play the odds on this one.

				I have consumed 25c twice (600ug and 2x600ug tabs) with my mates and haven&#039;t experienced anything terrible. The trips were quite enjoyable to be honest. And I&#039;m currently waiting for my 25i tabs to arrive. I have to admit that this makes me a bit worrisome. Not terribly, but still.<br /><br />Hmm, I had a quick read on errowid (just now) about these fatalities and some of them are clearly just because the substance was abused instead of used.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Erowid</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In October 2012, 21-year-old Clayton Otwell died in New Orleans, LA, reportedly after insufflating a drop of 2C-I-NBOMe at a festival. The material was in a liquid of unknown potency. Otwell is said to have been ingesting caffeinated alcoholic drinks for several hours beforehand.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Alcohol+Caffeine+liquid of unknown potency. I wouldn&#039;t blame the substance in that case.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Erowid</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In July 2012, 25-year-old Stephanie Chappell Hobson died in North Carolina, USA, reportedly after consuming 2C-I-NBOMe with her boyfriend. The material was in &quot;pill&quot; form, so dosage is unknown. However analysis of the pills suposedly found that they did contain &quot;25i&quot; (Another name used for 2C-I-NBOMe). Hobson died more than 12 hours after taking the substance.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Another case of unknown dosage and she maybe even didn&#039;t know what she was ingesting. And why would someone sell NBOME as a pill? Just to crush it and snort it?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Erowid</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">On June 12 2012, 17-year-old Elijah Stai reportedly died in Minnesota, USA after consuming 2C-I-NBOMe which he thought was a mushroom extract. Reportedly he and a few friends mixed the chemical with melted chocolate and ate the candy. He exhibited significant serious negative physical effects before &quot;passing out, never to wake again&quot;. Some news reports have been incorrectly referring to 2C-I-NBOMe &quot;2C-I&quot;, which is a different chemical.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That case is altogether weird as as far as my knowledge goes, NBOMEs aren&#039;t active orally. But it&#039;s said here that he ate it after mixing the chemical with melted chocolate. Can someone clarify this?<br /><br />All in all lot&#039;s of fear is being generated. Sure, these substances have a bigger potential for OD than &#039;cid, so people shouldn&#039;t take them as a substitute to it (LSD). Everything has it&#039;s own nuances and everything should be treated so. I&#039;ll still do my 25i tabs when I get them, true I&#039;ll probably do half (0.5x1200ug), instead of the whole that I initially planned, but I&#039;ll still do it.<br /><br />Stay safe everyone.

				I have tripped 10+ with 25i/c...I never had a problem with it apart from a headache once or twice but it was sorted with a nurofen. I gave a tab to a girl once and threw up for no reason (she didn&#039;t drink and she didn&#039;t smoke weed either ) but she was alright after she threw up...It seemed weird and I got a bit scared...<br />

				Im not trying to scare anyone or stir up fear - just want people to be aware of the danger and make sure they dont end up getting charged with murder for trying to share a psychedelic experience with their friends. <br /><br />at least a couple of the deaths resulted from blotter - so you can assume the dose wasnt too much larger than a normal recreational dose. its just fucked this is legal (for now, probably not long) and lsd is illegal - which has only caused a couple confirmed deaths that were actually from lsd - and these people took MASSIVE overdoses - no where near a recreational dose. the safety of lsd is that you can overdose and as mentioned essentially have very few physiologically toxic consequences unlike 25i obviously... people have even snorted straight lsd crystal and recovered fully<br /><br />i believe nbome is actually active when ingested orally - its just at a much higher dosage, not positive though <br /><br />another issue is they dont say what else may have been in the persons system and what might be interacting to potentiate the danger<br /><br />i actually have not seen the same reports of danger from 25c as i have from 25i - didnt find a single report of death from 25c interestingly<br /><br />*** if you are going to use it - i would make sure you know what to do if they start to have a seizure - get them to the ground safely (make sure they dont fall out of a chair etc) and lay them in the recovery position if possible, clearing the airway (can choke on their tongue) and call for medical help immediately (who the fuck let you have a seizure for an hour without getting help??? most seizures last a min or two max). possibly have 3-4 mg of clonazepam to crush and give the person sublingually although this may be dangerous itself

Also at the time none of us knew how fatal seizures lasting this long could have been to me i guess im lucky. <br /><br />Another factor is that the first time where i had the two seizures i had been taking pills as well as drinking and dancing around in a fairly warm room so i blamed it on overheating and dismissed it being an OD. When it happened recently it was off two of tylers tabs on SR at 1200ug each. It lasted around 35minutes then i woke up and came around although had no memory of it happening.<br /><br />My aim is not to scare people out of doing 25i-nbome however just to make them aware and to be careful with it. I know from personal experience it can be really good one moment then go so wrong so quickly. <br /><br />Good Luck if you do decide to take it and hope all goes well :)

				I don&#039;t know for sure what is needed to accurately measure this drug however the active dose is in the micrograms. Anything that is active in the Micrograms (ug) will need very accurate tools to put the chemicals onto blotter paper. It would be my guess that something accurate enough to do this would be very expensive. Thing you need to ask is how do you know buying tabs of 25i on the road actually have that amount of 25i on them.

				Anyone got the experience of taking nbomes after working out? The reason I ask this is I did this once, and the DOMs in my calves and lower back were so much worse than normally.

				For the record ENBOOM does not condone the consumption of 25i-NBOMe and our blotters are for novelty use only.<br /><br />That being said, When producing our art tabs, we use volumetric measuremnets.&nbsp; However, the way we do it is in no way simple, and the typical human does not have access to the equipment we have.<br /><br />We use a microgram scale to measure out 900.00mg of 25i-NBOMe.&nbsp; One thing people NEED to notice with milligram scales is that air pressure (wind) affects them, as well as the built in equipment error.which could range from +/- 5-25mg.&nbsp; What is printed on them is actually inaccurate especially the chinese scales.<br />&nbsp;<br />The microgram scale we use is a peice of equipment that costs well over 10k USD.&nbsp; And is technically accurate to 1nanogram.<br /><br />We also use micro-pippetes which release a single drop of liquid which is ALWAYS the same amount.&nbsp; Get about 100 of these and hook it up to a nice machine that&#039;ll drop them consistently across 100 individual tabs and repeat 9 times per print.<br /><br />I assume the average person would simple use volumetric measurement and splash it across a sheet which will create hotspots.&nbsp; Last time we did a GC/MS test on individual blotter by this method you can get 2000ug +/- 100ug on a single one if not prepared properly.&nbsp; Please everyone exercise caution.<br />

				I don&#039;t know anything about 25i but I tried Nevita&#039;s 25c(800ug) as single,double,triple and 4 tabs all together.I guess it&#039;s not dangerous for me,there wasn&#039;t any seizure or something uncomfortable.25c is so clean substance I think,it&#039;s very similar to lsd in this respect but of course it&#039;s so far from the depth of lsd.And 2c-xs also much more deeper and special than 25c for me.If I double my regular dose of 2c-p or 2c-e that causes a huge difference,they are completely different at high doses,it&#039;s like I am in another universe, but I can&#039;t tell there&#039;s a very big difference between 1 tab and 4 tabs of 25c for me.However it seems very safe substance to me,maybe safer than 2cp at reasonable high doses...

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know that im going to get a lot of negative karma for this but I think that 25-xxxx should be banned from SR. There are a number of users of this forum who have reported life threatening problems from ingesting close to the recreational dose. I took 2 tabs of supposed 1mg 25i-nbome and came up within 20 minutes and instantly puked for 10 minutes strait. After that was over i started tripping so hard that i was delerious. I blacked out for 8 hours and probabley had a seizure and ever since then my left eye lid is droopy and i cant concentrate hard.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This substance is dangerous! Not to mention thousands and thousands of people are ingesting it thinking that its lsd! 99.99% of &quot;acid&quot; in my area is nbome! lots of people in my area have been hospitalized over it with life threatening symptoms. Shady dealers come on here and see that they can get it for less than a dollar a hit and sell it for extreme profit and they have no regard for their customers lives! im pretty sure that most of the nbome that is distributed around the united states comes from SR in the form of blotters! Nbome will be one of those things that could compromise SR after a kid dies from it and the law enforcement gets wind that this drug comes from SR!!

				Hmm, well this definitely made for some interesting reading. Would have been nice to stumble upon this thread earlier as I have placed a very large order for 25i-nbome caps with Tyler and had planned on reselling them. Gonna have to think twice about that now. I have closely inspected the caps and they look decent, although since I haven&#039;t tried hallucinogens before I was reluctant to try it on myself first. I gave 1 cap to a mate of mine who is a massive psychedelic user and he reported it didn&#039;t do much at all to him.<br /><br />Either way, this made some good reading, cheers for posting!

So all you need are perforated blotter paper with 1000 squares, flat dish (big enough to fit dimension of blotter), solvent (water or alcohol, amount of solvent does not matter, just enough to dissolve all stuff, and not too much to let it dry fast).<br />So you dissolve all your nbome in solvent, put blotter paper in dish, pour solution on dish, and now just be patient and let it to dry. Thats it. You have 1000 blotters distributed evenly with 1 mg each.<br /><br />This method is very easy, safe and hard to go wrong. I suspect that some people make it another way, putting drops on each square, this method is not precise and the result really can be dangerous. It can be good for lsd, not for stuff like nbome

				I have heard about the deaths but if you do some research&nbsp; ..these people had the following problems when ingesting the substance.<br />A) Some deaths are reported after EATING NBOME PILLS... nbome is not active orally so an overdose of the chemical with small feel of effects is possible.<br />B)People where ingesting MULTIPLE tabs of 1mg til they felt something(overdose, illness) CRAZY, nbome is not active orally, just subliminally.<br /><br />When someone buys Nbome form me I understand he has done some research on it; The problem comes in the distribution; maybe a vendor that buys 5k-10k blotters gives out 1k to some street dealers.. and you know how this guys work.. they will try to get as much as they can; they have no morals. They will sell it as LSD if they can.. and here confusions occurs.. when you are expecting one effect and you get another.<br /><br />now MY THEORY ..<br />Government propaganda against this new drug that is expanding quick and opening too much minds at a cheap price so its available for almost anyone.. the last thing the guys up there want&nbsp; is something near the 60s-80s.. they want robots no humans.<br />

				You can&#039;t forget that drugs effect everybody differently both physically and mentally.<br />I&#039;m a tall guy, small love handles and I&#039;ve got a good grip on reality, despite a history and family history of schizophrenia, depression etc.<br />Just because i can eat a shit load of tabs or shoot 400mg of heroin and keep myself together, doesn&#039;t mean everyone else can.<br /><br />Know yourself, know your product.

				I don&#039;t know if this is one of the deaths reported on bluelight, but it&#039;s really sad&nbsp; (&nbsp; http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/11/21-year-old_dies_after_one_dro.html&nbsp; )&nbsp; I frequent New Orleans and was at the voodoo festival last month.&nbsp; The local newspapers are all the buzz about some emergency legislative plans to make as much stuff illegal as they can come up with.&nbsp; Drugs that give drugs a bad name should be avoided.&nbsp; If LSD gets put on the blotter wrong, so what?&nbsp; That said I know of two deaths from LSD, both were in the southeast, one recently where a college kid attacked a campus police naked tripping probably on lsd, and another some years ago where a naked college kid on LSD was subdued by the cops as he was crazy raging and they restrained him and he got smothered or had a stroke or something.... but those are not from toxicity of the drug, they are from actions.

				Can people please state doses that caused seizures as well as vendor in question. Blotter tabs are going to vary in dosage from vendor to vendor. If we assume that there hasn&#039;t been any error in the laying of the blotters and every tab is even. Then, we shouldn&#039;t see these effects coming from even dosed tabs.<br /><br />Now, i love the nbome family, but i have personally witnessed that there is a fine line between a nice trip and too much. So, in theory if one of the tabs are heavier than the last, it could result in adverse side effects. This doesn&#039;t mean that 25i-nbome is a bad chemical if the cause of the adverse side effects are from overdose. I would be laughed off these forums if i posted &quot;Water danger! Man dies from water due too much consumption of water!&quot; <br /><br />My point is this. When we are messing with blotters, no matter what chemical is laid on them. There is always a risk of un even tabs. One needs to account for this and never assume that the next tab is going to hit the same as the last. This thread is actually giving me an idea. <br /><br />I feel sorry for anyone who has life threatening or adverse side effects from their use of 25i-nbome. If 25-I nbome caused me to have a seizure i wouldn&#039;t use it again, let alone a third time. Drugs effect everyone body differently (I know so cliche) and everyone has drugs that don&#039;t mix with their brain chemistry. One needs to listen to the signs their body is informing them and adjust their actions accordingly.
