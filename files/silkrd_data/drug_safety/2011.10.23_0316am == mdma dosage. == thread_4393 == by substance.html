				Depends on quality. 100 would be a minimally active dose at 99% purity. I would recommend 150-200 to start with most stuff

				When its you first time doing pure MDMA, I would recommend you begin with a dosage around 120 mg. My weight is about 160lbs and when I take 120 mg at one time it happens that it&#039;s getting too much. I felt sick for like 10 min and had urge to vomit, sweating that much it droped down my nose. After that everything went more than fine. But I recommend to dip several times around 150 mg.

				I put mine in capsules of 114mg and usually end up taking one then a few hours later snorting one but I have taken a lot more over the course of a night and morning. Hope this helps

				Quality matters a lot.&nbsp; Some of it 250mg seems to do it, others 150mg-175mg.&nbsp; Had some off Juergen2001 that 150mg was all that I needed.

				Sorry to butt in, but I&#039;ve got a dosage question, too..<br /><br />I am underweight. I&#039;m female, 5 feet 7 inches tall, and I weigh 98 pounds. I have taken ecstasy pills before, but it was at least a year ago.<br /><br />How many milligrams should I take? I would actually like to start with a weak dose and work my way up to the feeling I desire, though I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s even possible to do that. I know quality is important, and the only information I can provide about the MDMA I have is that it&#039;s light tan/beige, it&#039;s crushed up but it&#039;s not powder, it&#039;s alot of small smooshed chunks, and it is from Calistoner&#039;s last batch before he left us.<br /><br />I was thinking of starting at 90mg and going up from there, but then I have heard that as little as 30mg will fuck you up. Where should I start so that I can kind of tailor my dose to feel how I want?

				80 is what I would consider the minimal active dose to do anything at all, but it won&#039;t be much. 100 will be definitely active and 120 is generally considered the typical dose for full efficacy. But that&#039;s 99% pure MDMA, I would add 10% right on the top. If you are not very experienced I wouldn&#039;t take more than 130 at first, but since I am I would start at 150 on a new batch and might take 180 or 200 if I know it&#039;s weak. I have heard these dosages are usually pretty consistent across body weight but nothing scientific to back it up. :P<br /><br />You can always take more. I always do. But not less. There is one caveat to keep in mind. Sometimes in my, and others, experience, and it doesn&#039;t even necessarily happen for any particular reason, you may feel absolutely nothing for several hours despite taking the proper dose of good stuff... then suddenly it just all comes on at once.&nbsp; The body is weird. So you don&#039;t want to go taking half a gram just because nothing happened for 2-3 hours. This is probably more likely to happen if you have eaten any food whatsoever in the previous 4 hours so I try not to.
