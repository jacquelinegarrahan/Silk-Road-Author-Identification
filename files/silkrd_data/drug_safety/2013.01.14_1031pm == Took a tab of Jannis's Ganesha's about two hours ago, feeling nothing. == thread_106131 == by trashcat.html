				I took at tab of Jannis&#039;s Ganesha&#039;s about two hours ago, feeling nothing. This is my first time with LSD, the supposed strength is 125ug. Should I take another? It was tasteless blotter if that helps.

				Just wait ;) <br /><br />Sometimes LSD can take 3-4 hours to come up... And it&#039;s tasteless, so no worry about that ^^ if you see no effect after 3-4 hours, it&#039;s starting to be weird (-_-)

				Yeah you should be able to feel 2 when it kicks in.<br /><br />What about cross tolerance? Have you had any mdma recently? <br />Or would this not matter since he had two and should feel something.

				Well it&#039;s 5 hours from the start. No visuals, if anything I feel a little body high that&#039;s it. I feel sorta high, but definitely nothing comparable to shrooms or molly. I&#039;ll update in another two hours.

				Most numbers mean nothing on SR<br /><br />Like how much mdma there is in xtc, or how pure mdma is, or how much ug in a tab.<br /><br />You should have felt quite something 45-60 minutes, or less, after ingesting.<br /><br />Taste doesn&#039;t say anything. Some acid tabs taste very bitter, others don&#039;t. <br /><br />My guess is you&#039;ve either been ripped off or you are on antidepressants/antipsychotics/took high dose vitamin pills today.<br /><br />about $10 for a tab is ridiculous anyway. Best ones I ever had were free and &quot;ok&quot;.<br />One time I got one that was supposed to be old, and of ok quality.<br />Took a quarter and only saw fractals 30minutes afterwards for 12 hours.&nbsp; :-X Was I happy I didn&#039;t take the whole tab.<br /><br />

				Dollars to doughnuts he&#039;s on anti-depressants, opiates, or MDMA, or something else that would kill the effects of LSD. I spot checked (which involves taking 2-3 random pieces of tabs being used, since it&#039;s to check for consistency through the entire amount (a square in my case). <br /><br />I&#039;ve never been let down by Jannis, and whoever complained about price - we all need to get over the fact that yes, acid was awesome and as cheap as you wanted back when it was like every weed dealer&#039;s other thing they sold a decade ago. Expected chemists of the highest caliber to illegally make the most complicated synthetic drug on the planet was only going to be free for so long. <br /><br />Not to mention, it was 1 fucking guy (maybe 2, depending on whose stories you believe) that was the pretty much the world&#039;s LSD Philanthropist. Wholesale 100-150ug hits for $.30 or so again....good luck.<br /><br />I have no problem paying my $10/hit and accepting that it wasn&#039;t made in a via bake and shake.
