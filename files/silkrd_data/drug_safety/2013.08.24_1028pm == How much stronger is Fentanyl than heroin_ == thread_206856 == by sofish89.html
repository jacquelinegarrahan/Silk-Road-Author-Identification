				Actually, Fent is more of an initial rush. Crazy euphoria from what ive been told. The reason i think H users dont switch to fent, is because it has hardly any legs. You get so high, so quick..only to come down and begin kicking just as quickly. <br /><br />Also the dosage curve i think it is, that makes it so much more dangerous dose for dose. I dont know much about the shit, only what ive been told or read in the H threads. It seems that fent is a fairly commonly used cutting agent for heroin. As alleged with UGS reselling of ST&#039;s #4 H.

				Availability is probably an issue too. You have time-released patches of fentanyl that can supply a steady dose over a day or more. These are not sold by your average dealer though, and are actually very hard to obtain.<br /><br />Ofcourse there is also fentanyl as a pure substance, which is extremely potent. The problem with that is that it is so potent you need to take serious safety measures when synthesizing or handling it to prevent passing out. Something like heroin you can easily handle with bear hands, but fentanyl could absorb through your skin in doses large enough to knock you out.

Just a thought.

				It also has to do with purity, consistent concentration and general cleanliness and proper lab procedures. <br /><br />The production of heroin from opium is a rather dirty and lossy one. This does not really matter because most of the loss is before smuggling the stuff across policed borders, at which point is still is has very little value. <br /><br />With heroin the chief gain is in the international smuggling and redistribution. The actual amount of poppy latex required to make a kilogram of heroin would probably cost something like $100 from some afghan farmer. <br /><br />The story for fentanyl is vastly different: As it is 100 times more potent compared to morphine, the quantities required are tiny, and so are the quantities of base chemicals to do the synthesis from. Even the synthesis process is not overly difficult for a serious laboratory, let alone a pharma giant. <br /><br />So why is it so expensive? Basically because there are very few producers and there is little competition between them to bring the price down. So an actual dose of 1 mg fentanyl can be as expensive, or more expensive, than the equivalent 100 mg dose of morphine. <br /><br />If synthesized in an illegal lab i suppose there would be severe problems selling the product as well: direct competition with drug cartels that are raking in billions of dollars a year, with you offering an alternative that costs a fraction of the price. <br /><br />There are conspiracies about people inventing cars that run 100 km on a litre of petrol being assasinated by the oil industry. That sounds far fetched, but if you were to destroy the whole illegal opiate marked by flooding the streets with fentanyl, i&#039;m affraid chances are your lifespan may be somewhat limited.
