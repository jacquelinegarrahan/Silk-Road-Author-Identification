If you&#039;re after that first time pleasure.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to take both 2C-B and MDMA. Either will do.<br /><br />2C-B about 4 hours after MDMA will give you the mental insightfullness, plus a whole load of psychedelic experiences which are simply mind blocking and HAVE to be experienced.<br /><br />Ketamine will continue the simple MDMA rolls and pleasure, but reduce the chattiness.<br /><br />Personally I hate psychedelics, but vote for the 2C-B, as it&#039;s something else and has changed my life around... It&#039;s simply amazing, especially after MDMA....<br /><br />OZ

				Alright, I&#039;ll have to try that too then.<br /><br />What about taking MDMA at the same time with 2c-b?<br /><br />Or is it MDMA+Ketamine, and then 4 hours after 2c-b?<br /><br />How much ketamine do I have to snort, like a point? Or is that too much?

This will take about an hour to kick in but will continue your MDMA highs and rolls, make you really horny and able to do something about it (unlike MDMA alone!) and really chatty and dancy again. It also gives you amazing universal philosophical thoughts and insights, but the best bit is that it will get rid of your usual MDMA downer and make you happy the next day, you&#039;ll go to work after only a few hours sleep with a smile on your face and stay like that for ages.<br /><br />The alternative is after 1 hour of taking MDMA, when you&#039;re on a high or roll, take Ketamine. Snort about 120mg up your nose and you will go into a warm, cushioned, water-bed style heavenly bliss. This is no good for partying, talking to people or other social things but you&#039;ll be in your own private heaven. You&#039;ll wake up from this heaven about 4 hours later and will sleep well.<br /><br />Personally I prefer 2C-B, but it&#039;s up to you...&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;m lucky - I had MDMA about 4 times in the 90s when it came out.<br /><br />I used SR to buy my first gram of crystal off Ivory, a vendor you can rely on even if its pricey.<br /><br />Now, I have used only three times. Once was 50mg which just made me tired!<br /><br />100mg more than does me, that is 80mg pure, so low tolerance here.<br /><br />A friend of mine I recently gave him a gram of a certain Mr P from Germany. Friend reported back saying it never took him were he wanted to go. I was worried, worried the MDMA (5 grams) was not so good! Then another friend, a women I work with, took 100mg with her husband and both were high as a kite and said it was the best roll they had for years. Another frind used and was blown away on 120mg taken at 7.00pm and hitting him at 8.00pm in the pub.. Took a redose of 40mg and was up till 5.00am.<br /><br />I used Ivorys and found it was wonderful MDMA. Little comedown, easy to sleep on, next day your feeling great and the next day after that a little tired maybe but nothing really. Like drinking 3 pints and the next day feeling.<br /><br />The friend who said the E was not working that good confessed he and a buddy had teamed up, divorced middle aged guys who gobbled tabs so much they could munch down ten in a night with ease.<br /><br />I reckon he took 2000+ easily. About four years of using E every weekend and sometimes in the mid week. When E first came out nobody knew muich about it. We were told you had to dance in a rave when it was actually used for counseling and opening people up to help them cope with emotional stuff. You open up. It was said one pill was equal to a few yerars counseling.<br /><br />Using E at&nbsp; rave is great. Sitting at home with someone you love and care for is also great.<br /><br />MDMA is a very powerful drug. Many kind of abuse it and sadly it cannot be used every day as you will deplete seratonin levels and we cannot just pop a pill to raise that without consequences. <br /><br />I will use MDMA a few times a year. Twice only this year! Once was 50mg - too little to get you high but enough to make you feel worn out a little! Not a lot but let us not pretend MDMA has no comedown.<br /><br />ANY drug that good has to have a comedown.Thankfully it is very mild compared ti many drugs and strange in that the next day I always feel great but the day after, that is when I feel a bit &#039;less than&#039;.<br /><br />Good drug if used wisely.<br /><br />A gram will last me a year with ease. I give more away then use but it makes me happy knowing friends have the real thing and enjoy a safe MDMA free of any nasty cuts - in fact the MDMA here is maybe the most reliable drug.<br /><br />But every drug it has its own rules which users can easily study in this age of technology.<br /><br />We all know LSD cannot be used daily.<br /><br />You do not use mushrooms to get in the mood for work.<br /><br />And MDMA, you ought to use maybe a handful of times a year. I have a few drugs so its not like I will be short of entertainment.<br /><br />Coke holds its own. You can use that every month and tolerance is as low as a new born coke virgin.<br /><br />Weed levels out. You finds your level. Can be used daily.<br /><br />Few drugs can be used on a daily basis.<br /><br />Even weekly, most drugs seem to be best used fortnightly at least (for ravers out there) but in between you got to keep fit and well. Eat well. <br /><br />With MDMA its well known that heavy users lose the magic.<br /><br />So if that is you - bombing 300mg of Ivory MDMA to get a tingle - best leave it alone as you will do more harm than good dosing with high doses that bring little high but certainly hit you hard the day after! <br /><br />MDMA is meth amphetamine with a molecule added or taken away.<br /><br />Think of it like that and you might use less often.<br /><br />If you are young and like MDMA then learn from people who took too much. Always take a break. Even if you took once every two weeks that is barely leaving the brain to recover and create more serotonin which IS important on a day to day level. A mystery also - but we know it makes us feel good.<br /><br />I would make sure I left MDMA for special occasions only.<br /><br />Like coke, less is more.<br /><br />I used MDMA that seldom that I think I got maybe another 100 or so rolls left in me. <br /><br />Laters.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I only rolled once before, and I redosed a couple of times.<br /><br />I took 100-120mg at first, with water, and then I redosed 5 or 6 times in the next three hours. They were little bumps up the nose. No more than 30-40mg. So I probably took around 250mg&#039;s in total.<br /><br />Although... After some calculations, it was more like 200mg total. Cause I had 1g, I sold 200mg&#039;s, and then I gave about 6 people some 30-40mg bumps. And when I weighed what I had left, it was 485mg.<br /><br />So 1000 - 200 (what I sold) - 180 (the bumps I gave for free, I have no idea exactly how much there was in each bump though) - 470 (what was left) = 150mg. So add 50mg just for the fuck of it. Goes to a max of 200. So I&#039;m guessing I didn&#039;t go over the top. But the experience did start to just get very speedy and much less psychedelicly with every additional bump I took after the 3rd one. So I should have just stopped there.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t rolled in 5 months.<br /><br />I&#039;m sad I redosed, should have left it there at 150mg&#039;s... But I think the 5 month break did me good.

				the whole &#039;losing the magic&#039; part is the main reason why I don&#039;t use the stuff very often. This is probably not the most popular opinion in this forum but since I only use it like twice a year it feels like the first time every time. A lot of friends who use it more often still get a nice high but they never get as extreme is I do. I see in the topic that you can mix MDMA with other stuff to get a good high to, but I prefer not mixing my drugs. I&#039;m not a chemist or a neuroscientist so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s okay what to mix with what but for me it seems a good rule in regard to safety and health.

Pure MDMA, or what I consider to me MDxx in pills, probably about 15 to 20 times from 08 to 12<br /><br />2. Since I never had really easy access to it, and I live in Australia, naturally I could never use it too often. This is a good thing.&nbsp; My current aim for frequency of use is once every 3 or 4 months.<br /><br />3. No, my first roll was definitely not my best. I don&#039;t even know if my first few rolls had any MDMA in them. I felt great, but then I double dropped these new pills on one particular occasion, and it was just WHOOOOAAAAA. I&#039;d say my 4th or 5th roll was my best ever.<br /><br />4. Yes and no. Sometimes yes. Tolerance is such a bitch with this drug.&nbsp; Spacing is everything.&nbsp; If in doubt, dose more INITIALLY. I find after going through the Australian MDMA drought, when I managed to get some pure crystal it was almost as good as my best time years beforehand. Very very close.<br /><br />5. No, I haven&#039;t lost the magic, although, I feel like I&#039;ve had a glimpse of diminishing MDMA magic. This is why i&#039;m being so careful about spacing my rolls out at the moment.&nbsp; Tolerance aside, when it comes to MDMA, if the experience isn&#039;t so novel anymore, and the setting is less than perfect, and your dosage is off you can really feel weird, like you&#039;re losing the magic.... which is a sign you probably are I guess.<br /><br />6. As above, started to worry, started building lots of willpower to resolve to dose MDMA far less often.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t lost the magic luckily, and I have some crystal from Ivory i&#039;ve been sitting on with about 3 months now, can&#039;t wait to give that a go!&nbsp; Supposedly the best there is.<br /><br />Expectations can be a bitch with MDMA too.&nbsp; Ivory&#039;s seems to blow the socks of anyone and everyone though, so we&#039;ll see!

				I&#039;ve taken MDMA too many times to count, for the past like two years.<br /><br />Now i take it once every&nbsp; 3-4 weeks, sometimes it&#039;s only 2 weeks, but not too often. I like to have 3 weeks as a minimum. <br /><br />My first roll was epic, but i feel like most of my rolls are epic. <br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten the same euphoria as my first time, if anything doing it more has made me learn to go with it more and get the most out of it, usually resulting in more euphoria.<br /><br />As for the magic, i feel kinda lucky, cus i know of some people that just can&#039;t feel it as much anymore. I&#039;ve noticed a pattern in my MDMA use, i&#039;ll use once every like 2 weeks for months,&nbsp; then start losing the magic and take like 3-4 month break. After the break my head is full of juicy serotonin to make me happily roll. <br /><br />I ended my last MDMA break in May. I&#039;ve been making a point to wait at least 3 weeks. (with an exception thrown in there once) Also, I&#039;ve started taking a few supplements. Just multi-vitamins and 5-HTP,I take em the day after i roll, and continue taking them every couple days until about a week before my next roll. <br /><br />So far its done me right. Every time i roll, i roll hard, and the come down is fine. <br />Definitely one of my favorite drugs,almost tied up there with good ole LSD. Only this is MDMA is waaay easier to get than LSD, at least for me

I later (using reagents and such) determined that the first pill was Ketamine and Methamphetamine with no MDMA, and the second substance was rather pure MDMA. I didn&#039;t get the euphoria of the first one because I think meth is overall more enjoyable. That being said, I really enjoyed some of the loving effects from MDMA more than pure euphoria can be enjoyed.

				Just making a post in this thread so it shows up in my updated topics for when I finally take my next roll after a 10-year break. It&#039;ll be about 175mg (125+50 chaser). Then I&#039;ll let everyone know if the magic has returned...<br /><br />OT, if anyone knows how to subscribe to a thread without posting to it, can they let me know?

				Piracetam. Nuff said. <br />If you preload on that shit for a week before rolling you roll like a teenage girl for her first time. It&#039;s still totally legal in the US I believe, but in Europe it is somewhat hard to get a hold of, since it&#039;s a prescription med in some countries. I believe that in 10-20 years it will be in a more wide use in the medical industry (if those basterds find a way to capitalize on it). It has already been proven to cure/slow down alzheimer&#039;s and other neurological syndromes. <br />What&#039;s weird is that this year I&#039;ve seen a few reports on nootropic forums of people taking it up to 15 grams a day (normal dose reported to be 2-5 grams) with EPA and DHA and saying that it has completely changed their lives (to the better ofc). Pretty fascinating stuff imo. <br /><br />But yea, Piracetam is thought to work at least in some way that it makes your neurotransmitters more available and it boosts the &quot;fluidity&quot; of neurons.<br />It has also been reported to boost psychedelics like LSD. <br />

They are completely, COMPLETELY, different. Meth works by releasing dopamine and MDMA works by releasing Serotonin and oxytocin, but very little dopamine.<br /><br />Meth is associated with physical AND psychological addiction.<br /><br />MDMA has only the potential of causing psychological addiction in some users.<br /><br />Meth destroys lifes and families.<br /><br />MDMA saves marriages and can give life new perspective :)<br /><br />As the guy in the quote said, don&#039;t abuse it. One should never imo use it more often than once a month. If you wanna play safe, don&#039;t go over a few times a year.<br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. How many times have you taken MDMA?<br /><br />Impossible to determine.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. How often do you take MDMA?<br /><br />50+ first year.

Had good rolls since then.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Have you managed to get the same sheer euphoria after your first time?<br /><br />Absolutely, I think people who don&#039;t have that perception are mixing how it affected them and the memory that associates with that change. No your brain chemistry doesn&#039;t &quot;learn&quot; the drug making it less efficient. Find me a scientific articles that remotely verifies such a claim.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Do you feel like you&#039;ve lost the &quot;magic&quot;?<br /><br />Nope, healthy people have healthy functioning brains. If you lost magic you are doing damage.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.

				1. How many times have you taken MDMA?<br />6 times<br /><br />2. How often do you take MDMA?<br />3+ times a semester<br /><br />3. Was your first roll your best roll?<br />No, though it had that fresh, novel feeling of doing anything fun for the first time.<br /><br />4. Have you managed to get the same sheer euphoria after your first time?<br />Yes. I&#039;ve also been fortunate enough to enjoy MDMA in very perfect situations—with my best friends, at awesome parties, with nice weather, etc. The conditions have just seemed completely right every time.<br /><br />5. Do you feel like you&#039;ve lost the &quot;magic&quot;?<br />No, but I feel like I&#039;ve come close. I did it once a month for the past three months and while all three times were awesome, I think if I continued the pattern I would start to get diminishing returns. I would HIGHLY recommend not doing it more than once a month and to stop if you get a sense of losing the magic. I love other drugs, such as shrooms and LSD, but MDMA is really the best feeling and I don&#039;t want to lose my ability to enjoy it.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. How many times have you taken MDMA?<br />2 times MDMA, 1 time MDA. All were pure from the source and in crystal powder form. Embarrassed to say this was 25 years ago! MDMA was brand new at the time<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. How often do you take MDMA?<br /><br />for me averages out to once a decade. Though I had an ill family member who subsequently died and my life revolved around her more than partying for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Was your first roll your best roll?<br />Yes. My first roll with MDA was insane fluctuating between magnificent feelings and severe paranoia. Very different from the mescaline I was getting from same vendor. The first mdma I took too much and went to a dance club with pulsating light and loud music. Started to get frisky with cute ladies and got myself into a little (fun) trouble that night.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Have you managed to get the same sheer euphoria after your first time?<br />No, but had no access to that kind of quality until I joined SR. Haven&#039;t tried it here yet but will real soon<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Do you feel like you&#039;ve lost the &quot;magic&quot;?<br />No, it&#039;s been 25 years and I can recapture the magic!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. If you&#039;ve lost the magic, did you try quitting for a very long time and try again? And if so, did you regain the magic?<br /><br /><br />

				<br />I have some rules which help me retain the magic:<br /><br />1. Wait at least 6 weeks between rolls<br />2. Preload and postload 5-HTP, magnesium and Vit C<br />3. Only use best quality mdma (at least 75% pure and made with sassafras oil)<br />4. Don&#039;t go mad and take more than you need for a roll as the neurotoxicity will build<br /><br />Follow these and every time will be like the first...<br /><br />

				Just to chime in here because I can&#039;t sleep.<br /><br />I used MDMA heavily in my teens. More often than not it was mostly pure, but of course there were a few exceptions with MDA and just crap. www.pillreport.com was a saviour, and I never purchased without going to that website.<br /><br />Probably did it around 40 times around 16-18. Always around 2-4 pills, but could never determine the actual mg in each pill so take that info for what its worth.<br /><br />I have lost the magic. Even after 4 years of not rolling, and then ordering those defcons, and then triforces, and dosing very high (close to 700 MG per time if the lab reports are to be believed) - it just isn&#039;t there.<br /><br />Those pills were very pure, you could feel it, and the ability to instantly fall asleep during comedown reinforced that, but the magic wasn&#039;t there. I got high as fuck for sure, but it wasn&#039;t the same.<br /><br />Not sure if it&#039;s worth it to keep chasing that high. The older I get the stronger the toll ecstasy takes on my body for the next 2-3 days. Might have to do with the mg I took, but whatever. <br /><br />However my objective opinion after using ecstasy fairly heavily is that is does not have a long term impact on mental health. When sober and not hungover from alcohol I function at a very high level, in a very professional job. <br /><br />I do still feel the impacts of heavy hallucinogen use. It&#039;s a double edged sword. In a lot of ways I attribute hallucinogens as having a strong impact on my success, but equally I believe I can fault it for my failures. Mostly social failures. Hallucinogens by nature cause you to heavily reflect on lots of life&#039;s questions, and more often than not the more one reflects and understands, the more they wall themselves off from personal relationships.<br /><br />But fuck it. The magic is gone from MDMA (unless someone can point me in the right direction if I am missing something..), but there is always cocaine. And cocaine never fails to fuck you up how it should.<br /><br />

				I did more ecstasy in a shorter period of time and here I am 8 years after my first pill able to roll hard as ever. You might want to see a neurologist to see if your serotonin production is healthy because I would be worried. Screw taking the drug, it helps with a quality lifestyle.<br />Worried about you.&nbsp; :-\
