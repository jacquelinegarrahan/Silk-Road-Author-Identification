				I&#039;m a big fan of benzo&#039;s and I love buying rare benzo&#039;s such as triazolam, nitrazepam, or flunitrazepam when i see them available on SR, especially domestically.<br />I purchased 2 rohypnol pills (still in blister pack) that says 2 mg/pill on the blister from a domestic (USA) vendor. <br />I popped open the blister for the one of the pills and popped it about 2 hours ago. I dont feel very much from this pill. Last time i took a 1 mg rohypnol, i felt very fucked up and had alot of euphoria. but now does not feel like it. I popped the other pill out of the blister to get a look at the markings on the pill, but the pill doesnt have any. Just a small white round (blank on both sides) pill. <br />The blister says &quot;CF&quot; which the vendor says in the listing stands for CentraFarma. Blister also says &quot;flunitrazepam 2 mg&quot;<br />&quot;LT0202301, Exp 01/2018&quot;<br />I googled &quot;centra farma flunitrazepam&quot; but i didnt get alot of results, so it doesnt look like they make rohypnol.<br />Did i get counterfeit pills?<br />Any advice/input would be much appreciated!<br />Thanks :)

				Flunitrazepam usually has a dye in it, so if you put one on your tongue and it changes colors that&#039;s a good sign.

				no dye in it.. the pill says expires 2018, so it was probably made recently. Doesnt that mean that if it was made recently it shud have the have the dye in it by law?<br />and the worst part is that the pill has no markings on it.. I thought all pharmaceuticals had some kind of marklings on the pill in order to identify them from other pharmaceuticals

The new tablets are green (containing a blue coloring) and are pressed harder during manufacturing—so that the tablets can only dissolve quickly in hot liquids, while turning the drink a blue color and leaving a green residue in the beverage—were introduced to prevent use as a rape drug and abuse on the drug scene. However there have been only few reported cases in Europe where flunitrazepam was used as a rape drug and in most countries flunitrazepam is still offered as a generic drug with white tablets that can be dissolved easily

				I haven&#039;t seen any without dyes, but it&#039;s not like I have a frame of reference or anything considering they&#039;re roofies and everything.
