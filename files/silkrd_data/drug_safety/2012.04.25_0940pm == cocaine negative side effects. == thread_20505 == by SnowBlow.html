				Hi guys,<br /><br />So I&#039;ve only done blow a couple of times. Went several months before trying it again. I ordered some blow from TheStore and waxdatass. Tried each on separate occasions. After about half a gram, I could still feel my face (although slightly numb) although I became so jittery I couldn&#039;t get anything done. Not even hit the gym hard!<br /><br />My first time I ever used I felt on top of the world, social, and no jitteriness. Why after months of not using and now using am I only feeling jitteriness? <br /><br />Did they send me bad stuff? Should it have been more shiny? It seemed a consistent consistency. <br /><br />Also, any advice how to stop the jitteriness? Also, when do you guys enjoy your blow? Before drinking? going out? Etc. <br /><br />

				My personal opinion is stay FAR away from coke these days....I used to use almost regularly a few years back and after about a year my throat got really fucked up...my lymph nodes got swollen like to the size of ping-pong balls and my throat got very red and was always hurting. So i obviously stopped using but it took almost 2 years for my throat to fully repair...after about 6 months of stopping it wasnt red anymore but it still bothered me for a long time. Well back then i didnt know anything about levamisole but now researching it im almost certain this is why i had those symptoms. That trash messes with your immune system and could be a reason for the swollen lymph nodes, it also destroys your cell tissue witch could be a reason for the pain. Im not a doctor so i dont know for sure that was the cause but still ,just be careful and if you really insist on using coke dont overdo it.

				I see very little discussion of Levamisole (verterinary drug that causes horrible necrosis in humans) on the SR forums. If you search the clearnet you&#039;ll find horrible pictures and some estimates that nearly all coke currently on the market has some amount of Levamisole in it.<br /><br />Why is this not a discussion topic on SR?

				rocketdog.. Levamisole has been discussed in a lot of detail on the cocaine vendors thread (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=435.0) moz30 even has test results of cocaine with Levamisole percentages.
