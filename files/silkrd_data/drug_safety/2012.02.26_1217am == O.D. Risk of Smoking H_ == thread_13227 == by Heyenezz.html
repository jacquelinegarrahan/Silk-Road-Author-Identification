				Fuck food and water. Smoke till you pass out haha. Do some coke too if you got some :P.<br /><br />But smoking will hit you instantly pretty much and sooner or later it will be hard to smoke more from nodding so hard.<br /><br />I smoke h all day long and did since the beginning. Never got nausea(since i was popping alot of pills before stepping up to h), but I had Nuc&#039;s stuff which I&#039;m kind of mad I wasted so much smoking(it worked enough to nod me though and a lil bit too So idk what waste ppl are talking about.<br /><br />But food doesn&#039;t matter but water does a lil haha. I just drink a gulp everytime i think about it which is slightly rare but I have&nbsp; water jugs all around my room so i guess my unconscious knows what to do haha.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t worry and get to the top!<br /><br />

				Heyenezz, i would say ingesting a substance of unknown purity and strength brings with it an inherent risk of an overdose or bad reaction.<br /><br />I would say yes, you can OD from smoking H.&nbsp; Your respiratory system can become so depressed if you are nodding really hard that your body can just forget to breathe.&nbsp; Or if you nod off and happen to lie down on your back it is possible you can vomit and then aspirate it.<br /><br />I would say if you really want to mitigate the possibility of something going awry you should get a sitter.&nbsp; Or some naloxone if you feel like you&#039;ve gone too far but are still conscious enough to know it.<br /><br />One more thing. If you are getting a .5: take your time, do a hit then wait a bit, if it feels ok do another then wait some more.&nbsp; I personally wouldn&#039;t just go rushing in balls out your first time.<br /><br />OK, i hope some others will be by with more tips.<br /><br />Be safe <br /><br />T

				In terms of safety of the various ROAs for heroin, I think smoking is the safest. As others have suggested, it hits instantly and this fact allows you to titrate the dose and reduce the risk of taking too much before you realize it. I&#039;m told smoking heroin off of foil (&#039;chasing&#039;) is an acquired skill that may take some practice to get just right. <br /><br />All that said, you should always be careful (especially if you have low or no opioid tolerance.)
