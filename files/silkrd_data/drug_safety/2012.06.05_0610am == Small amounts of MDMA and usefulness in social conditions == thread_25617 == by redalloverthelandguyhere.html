				The other evening - I was going out with my girl. I was carrying&nbsp; defqon madma pill so decided to tale a very small amount - it could have 30-40mg or so.The reaction? Not a lot. In fact two pints of bitter (4% ABV) kept me on an even keel. No dilated pupils and it turned out good as the mum in law, who hates &#039;drugs&#039; (yet can do a bottle of wine in on session) turns up and a few of her aunts. Even the pub was dead! <br /><br />So lesson for me is that small amounts of 30-40mg of MDMA are pointless really. <br /><br />Also you really NEED to choose a venue where being really high on MDMA aint an issue! I&#039;m older than you raver so never been to some big rave. Usually the pub, parties are good in houses and I think MDMA is great to stay in with alone. Helps sometimes.<br /><br />My ideal dose is 100-120mg. That makes me fee so high and so good!<br /><br />The one thing I noticed with the small amount of MDMA I fely NO effect the next day. No hangover or crash. Easy sleep and think I can do more MDMA soon as my serotonin level was not really affected like they would be of you took 120mg of mdma ctysal or a defqon.speaker or triforce.<br /><br />So to sum it up its a waste of time taking small amounts of MDMA at 30-40mg. Even Shulgim said that but lol you got to try yourself even so.<br /><br />With coke less is more.<br /><br />With mdma more is more!<br /><br />Next it will be either 120mg of Pfanders or Ivory my first SR but and go 1.5 grams of that tried tested and amazing MDMA. 100mg I was full of love for all.

				I agree with what you&#039;re saying. With MDMA you have to be in the right place and state of mind. The pub with your girlfriends family isn&#039;t ideal, particularly if you have any kind of resentment of them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25617.msg274150#msg274150">Quote from: redalloverthelandguyhere on June 05, 2012, 06:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With mdma more is more!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d have to disagree with this. I do need a nice large initial dose, followed by a small top up, but for me too much MDMA over a night becomes pointless, I just feel &#039;speedy&#039; and &#039;dirty&#039;. I like to have my rolls then gently come down, not try to stay up by taking more and more and more.

				yeah, looks like you were just testing out your new acquired stash of mdma bro and your stating the obvious haha<br /><br />dont get me wrong, I understand you wanted to dabble and share your story, but your talking to nothing but well experienced and from what I can tell lately, educated people. <br /><br />the mdma, more is more quote....i do not agree with though. I find a good initial dose then *maybe* depending on event and situation with a given timeline remaining (nothing like a night at a pub) i can take a reup of 1/2 amount of initial. <br /><br />

				100-120mg is quite a large dose IMO.<br />I don&#039;t really do MDMA a lot anymore (hate the blackouts from combining MDMA with alcohol) so my tolerance is like 0. <br />But I recently received a sample of some MDMA and I took a small fingertip (30mg tops) and went like woahhh heavy shit.<br /><br />Also more = more isn&#039;t really true.. More MDMA after the first big dose only fucks you up and gives you more facial movement :P

				With only 40 mgs I would say snort it!<br /><br />A 40mg line probably won&#039;t have you &quot;rolling&quot; but it I&#039;d definitely say you will feel some post threshold effects.<br /><br />The high from snorting mdma is very different from taking it orally so be prepared for this but @ this dosage my personal preferred method would be snorting.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure a few members here would recommend plugging that amount *cue the eyebrow lifts* :D

				Sorry - I meant more as in more than 30mg-50mg! I would not go beyond 100-120mg with a top up of maybe a third to half two hours into the roll.<br /><br />I may have &#039;felt&#039; something but beer can blank out MDMA for me. Tones it down. 30mg, taken sober, sure I would feel it. But I think its best to experience the MDMA properly! My girls family are ok but some &#039;hate&#039; drugs and I will break that to them gently. perhaps. Need to know with drugs. Hate hiding ans sneaking out in the cold for a joint! Bit lol you do this for love I guess&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I find 30-50mg of MDMA and maybe 3 pints of even 3% beer wipes me out.<br /><br />100ng and a few pints I am cool but will be gone by 3.00am unless I re dose with E which I never felt the need to do with the good E here.<br /><br />I would not snort E<br /><br />Putting a syringe up your bum and putting maybe 5ml water with 100mg of MDMA oe &#039;plugging&#039; with many drugs is the best way. I sometimes drink 100mg of coke Plugging it would be more value for money. I got a small syringe for plant foods. 10ml - 3 inch plastic syringe.<br /><br />Its just a strange thing to do if you have not done that.<br /><br />But I do not want instant highs. I like them to creep up gradually. Not to hit hard and fast.<br /><br />Guess I need a rave or a house party wold be cool as everyone is so smashed you do not stand out!<br /><br />In a quiet pub on a small table with the in laws and aunts, MDMA is not that good an idea!&nbsp; &nbsp;::)

				i see no problem with using mdma for its usefulness in certain social settings. i went on a date with a woman while i was on mdma, and it went well. she had no idea and she is against drugs. nonetheless, i made a positive impression with her
