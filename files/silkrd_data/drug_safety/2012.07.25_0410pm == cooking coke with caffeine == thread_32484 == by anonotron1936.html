				Hey everyone, quick question (searched on the forums and couldn&#039;t find an answer). I have coke that is cut with bunch of caffeine. If I cook it into rocks, will the caffeine rock up too or will I just be left with the coke?<br /><br />Thanks!

				You should just try cooking it to make some rocks and see what you come up with. Only cook a little bit so as not to be wasteful. Also, kind of shitty you have cocaine cut with caffeine. I wouldn&#039;t buy from that dealer/vendor ever again.<br /><br />After you get some rocks, use a Marquis Reagent test and see what you come up with. Cocaine (or crack) should turn purple. Marquis Reagent tests do not react with caffeine. So if you have some sort of leftover material apart from the rocks, test that as well. Hopefully you get no reaction from it.

				Thanks for the advice. Yeah, I definitely will avoid them in the future. Stuff is garbage! It just felt uncomfortable, not at all like a normal coke high.

				Yes, I think you should be able to separate the caffeine quite easily.&nbsp; Free base cocaine is not soluble in water but free base caffeine is.&nbsp; So rock it up with baking soda or preferably ammonia and then wash it with water and filter.&nbsp; Repeat wash several times.&nbsp; One gram of caffeine dissolves in 46 mL of water.&nbsp; Cocaine base is only slightly soluble, with one gram dissolving in 600 mL water.

				After reading this thread, I&#039;m just going to avoid cocaine altogether. I am very sensitive to caffeine, and don&#039;t need a vendor/dealer cutting the two together.

				Out of curiosity, how do you know it was cut with caffeine? Can you just tell that there are two different powders? Do they tend to separate? I&#039;ve had suspicion towards my dealer with my coke lately but I honestly don&#039;t know how you could tell. Enlighten me&nbsp; :D

				Just based on what the other members have been saying about this person&#039;s stuff. My first guess would have been speed or something just because of how long it lasted.

His quality has dropped lately, but he&#039;s been making more money, at least according to him. I&#039;d like to think that he&#039;s not cutting more than whatever he already was, because his stuff seemed very pure before. Hopefully greed isn&#039;t getting the best of him; everybody goes to him because of the quality of his coke even though it&#039;s expensive.
