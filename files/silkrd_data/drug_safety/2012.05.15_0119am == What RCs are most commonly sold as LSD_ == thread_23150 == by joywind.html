				A few days ago I tried something that was sold to me as LSD.&nbsp; The blotter paper was tasteless. It took about an hour to take effect and the total duration was about 12 hours.&nbsp; The visual and hallucinogenic effects of the drug were identical to my past experiences with LSD. But several other people on this forum who have also tried it insist that it is not LSD. Given that the effects were virtually the same as LSD, would if most likely be DOx or 25i-nBOME or some other research chemical?

				It was definitely tasteless. I kept it in my mouth for twenty minutes. There was no bitterness, no burning sensation, etc. Does that rule out DOx and 25I-NBOMe?

				NBOMe dosnt work if swallowed, so unless people let it soak in their gums for a while they wont trip.<br /><br />The &quot;DOx&quot; chemicals were sold back in the 90&#039;s as acid, I only realise now because of the time it takes to come on and I remember one trip they made me throw up which is apparently a sign of dox chemicals.<br /><br />Honestly people tended to like the dox trips more, they were more powerful (at least more powerful than low dosed lsd) and lasted longer.&nbsp; <br /><br />LSD is pretty over-rated, dox you trip harder and longer, NBOMe also makes you trip too with excellent visuals and ego death, etc, the biggest advantage LSD has is not being able to take too much of it.

				Perhaps it was a different lysergic acid; TiHKAL describes several that have sub-LSD dosages that would probably be tasteless (eg. TiHKAL #1, AL-LAD https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal01.shtml).

				Pretty much every time I´ve done LSD blotters, there has been this mild licorice type taste to it. Now how do I know it isnt the taste of the paper or ink? Last one I did lasted like 10 hours+, so that probably wasnt acid? This is what sucks most in the drug trade, especially since RC´s came along.&nbsp; A normal user has no idea what they are ingesting.
