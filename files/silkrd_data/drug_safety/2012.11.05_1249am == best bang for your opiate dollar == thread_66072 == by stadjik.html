				I&#039;ve sniffed plenty of prescription pain medicines and a bunch of mediocre heroin, but I was wondering what everyone thinks is the best bang for their buck in opiate scrips. And also if it would be more economical to start smoking bth. I should say that I have had a brief stint with the needle but am definately not going back in that direction. Thanks for your input. Peace

				MS is almost too noddy for me though. As far as pure value, heroin will almost always be cheaper. That&#039;s why so many people wind up there. <br /><br />Prescription Pills&gt; Snorting pills&gt; snorting H&gt; banging H<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen many people go down that path

				Well...IV heroin would be the best bang for your buck but since you don&#039;t want to go down that route....I know if I were to personally give up IVing heroin...I would choose either oral oxycodone (with the cheap OPs) or plugging morphine.<br /><br />I also love Methadone, lasts long and I feel nice on it...so whenever I can get it for cheap I go that route. I miss the days of getting large take home doses for $15.

				Two steps:<br />1. potentate potentate potentate !<br />eating white grapefruit (the actual fruit, not the drinks) has an enzyme inhibitor that is used to process the opiates.<br />tagamet (cimetidine)<br />&nbsp;Cimetidine is also known to potentate the effects of several opioids which are partially metabolized via the cytochrome P450 pathway via inhibiting their metabolism and a temporary decrease of liver function due to reduced hepatic blood flow. This can lead to extreme plasma levels of these drugs and can easily lead to a fatal overdose.<br />I swear by tagamet. It doesn&#039;t work on every opiate, i believe ones that break back into morphine.<br /><br />Your title answered the thread anyway, bang bang. Smoking is hardly economical unless your smoking fent. It sounds like you have a tolerance, so invest in those potentating chems. Then move to step 2:<br /><br />DEXTROMETHORPHAN IN PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT AND IN TREATING THE EXPRESSION OF<br />WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME DUE TO PASSIVE-ADDICTED TO MORPHINE IN THE NEONATAL RATS<br /><br />Dextromethorphan (DM), a common used antitussive agent, has been proved to effectively attenuate or prevent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated neuropathologies by acting as a selective NMDA receptor noncompetitive antagonist. It has been reported that NMDA receptor antagonists, including DM, can attenuate the expression of the morphine withdrawal syndrome in adult animals. Thus, we tested whether this drug could also be effective in the withdrawal syndrome in the neonatal animals. We sub-cutaneously injected female Sprague-Dawley rats with escalating dosage of morphine since a week before mating till the end of first month after gave birth to their offspring. Control rats received normal saline only. The offspring which passive addicted to morphine from the dam rats had higher mortality rate and lower birth weight, and developed overt behavioral change manifested as apparent and frequent abdominal stretching after single injection of naloxone (1 mg/kg). Pretreatment of DM directly on the neonatal rats could abolish the naloxone-induced behavioral change without apparent side effect. We also found that pre-natally injected the dam rats with DM could prevent the naloxone-induced behavioral<br />change in the offspring born to morphine-treated dam rats. This result indicated that DM may be of usefulness in preventing or treating the morphine-withdrawal syndrome developed in newborn period.<br />&nbsp;<br />30mg of dxm daily lower your tolerance, or stop it from growing. Combing it like they do in step 1 potentates.<br />
