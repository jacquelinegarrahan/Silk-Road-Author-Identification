				Psychedelics are usually the antithesis of &quot;daily use&quot; (in the terms I think you are implying, i.e. &quot;recreational daily use to kill time for a while&quot;).<br /><br />For shamanic uses ALL the substances you have mentioned can be used daily for a period of time (depending on what you want to do) and many people have done or do so.<br /><br />In any case the easier to use daily it is surely DMT. If you would like a longer effect out of it use a MAOI an hour before or use it in combination with MXE.<br /><br />Still, I repeat, if you want to use them daily for &quot;recreational usage&quot;, you are missing out on the meaning of these substances (or you don&#039;t use them appropriately). It can work for a while, but I can assure you it will come a day (even more if you really start using them daily) that you will have to come on terms (an internal struggle that can evidence itself in different ways depending on your personal nature) with this faulty approach.

This is evidenced, in fact, by your personal bodily reaction to the substances in the point that you need to double the doses every time. It should happen exactly the contrary (usually the more you get linked with these substance the less you need for them to make their effects; your body is literally telling you that you are doing something wrong - in fact they ARE turning in interaction with your body as recreational drugs, because as in that case you need more of the same to have the same effect, a thing that usually doesn&#039;t happen with psychedelics used correctly).<br /><br />But naturally you can do what you will, and if you like it then there&#039;s no problem at all. It is just that given the way psychedelics work I don&#039;t think there&#039;s nothing you can do&nbsp; about this issue. Or you abide to the increased price or you change modus operandi.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165978.msg1178242#msg1178242">Quote from: joywind on May 30, 2013, 09:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s not faulty for me.

You can approach them as others that have the modus operandi you like, sure, but since they are not made for this, they don&#039;t accommodate as well for that use, as it is evidenced in your trouble.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165978.msg1178242#msg1178242">Quote from: joywind on May 30, 2013, 09:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For me it&#039;s a harmless addiction, because I don&#039;t work, etc. I can just devote 100% of my time to getting high.

I don&#039;t know of any psychedelics that works in the same way as a recreational drug (as reactions), just because they are, at their soul, not recreational drugs. Just like you can surely use a Ferrari in the traffic never going above the 2nd gear but then you cannot pretend that you will use the same amount of fuel as an utilitarian car (or will have the same experience in parking etc.), it is so for what it concerns psychedelics turned into pure recreational routine drugs.

				I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; From my reading, they all even share cross-tolerance with each other due to acting on the same receptors.&nbsp; In all honesty, your best bet would be an extremely potent sativa cannabis.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Chemdawg I tried put me in the psychedelic headspace that shrooms do, but it wasn&#039;t as visual, if that is what you are looking for.

				I&#039;ve read that even with daily use, Moxy takes a long time to build a real tolerance to. Not to mention it is super cheap if you buy 1g+ at a time.<br /><br />I have no experience with daily use though, so I&#039;d do some more research.

				In short - no.<br /><br />There is no recreational psychedelic drug you could use everyday without losing touch with reality!<br /><br />The whole point of any phychedelic drug is to alter perception which is fantastic once in a while but liable to fry you out if overdone.<br /><br />I&#039;d say cannabis and beer are the only two drugs I&#039;d allow daily use of - even then you can build up a tolerance with alcohol. Bud and hash, I smoke the same, never really any need for &#039;more&#039;. <br /><br />All other drugs, coke, mdma, acid and amphetamine in the form of dexamfetamine (uk pharm quality) are special treats.<br /><br />Thats my take on it.<br /><br />There may be some RCs which might &#039;seem&#039; safe, but if your using everyday, it will take time to see if its ok to use each day. Given these RCs are drugs we are basically testing on ourselves, I&#039;d caution anyone who think that because its legal then its liable to be safe. We can all remember the methedrone craze, I saw people munching that for months. At the end of it - they were a mess.<br /><br />So, best use psychedelics with caution - and use just a few times per year. I have had my yearly trip for a lot of years and consider it a kind of ritual to clear the mind of a few things. Nothing like a night under the stars and some shrooms or LSD and nice company. But I think if you done that for 200 nights running, you would be pretty fucked up mentally as we need reality to make the unreal experiences more worthwhile.<br /><br />Be safe.<br /><br />Always trip with someone who is experienced if you can - and always someone you trust 100%.

				I suppose that really sums it up.<br /><br />If you are taking psychedelics on a daily basis you will at some point lose track of what is real and what is not.<br /><br />It will not really matter what exact substance you are using. If you spend most of your time tripping that will affect you seriously - it is the effect of these drugs that will cause that problem, not their exact chemistry or mechanism of action. <br />

				lol i&#039;ve already been taking psychedelics on a daily basis for years. My problem is money (steadily increasing the dosage of LSD/shrooms costs a lot of money), not getting high every day.<br /><br />So I want a psychedelic that you can take the same dosage every day.... unlike LSD/shrooms, where you have to take 200ug on day 1, 400ug on day two, 800ug on day 3..... I can&#039;t afford that any more.<br /><br />So please don&#039;t advise me against taking psychedelics every day... I&#039;m already doing that, and have done it for a long. It doesn&#039;t bad for me

But there is no logical reason to take psychedelics daily, other than microdosing, which some people like to do for medicinal or productivity enhancement purposes. Using psyches too often robs them of their magic or connectedness. It robs them of their ability to show you your flaws and their extraordinary introspective properties. If you take them too often, you will be left only with a dull body buzz and half-ass visuals.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have no problem with people using psychedelics recreationally, but for a good experience you have to always show the greatest respect for the drug and yourself. You are not doing this by taking it everyday. And plainly said, you get less out of the experience recreationally.

				You can&#039;t go a week or two without using a psychedelic? Seems to me that you are just using it to pass time as if it was weed. Have you forgotten the spiritual reason and self enlightenment of psychedelics or you never saw it like that to begin with? However I don&#039;t judge but geez smoke some weed. And if you really want to pass the time so desperately, try some &#039;&#039;Xanax&#039;&#039; be warned tho it is very addicting.

You asked if there was a psychedelic that could be used as a recreational drug every day and you even evidenced that when you replied to me saying that it couldn&#039;t be DMT because you want to be able to watch TV while you are under the effects (can this be even remotely comparable to being in a state of continuous ego death or similar things?).<br /><br />The two things are completely different. Yes, you can use psychedelics daily for a certain period of time to plunge in certain kind of experiences (I even evidenced that in my first post, when I said &quot;you can use these drugs SHAMANICALLY daily to obtain something specific&quot;, do you remember?) but this is completely different than the modus operandi you want to exert from those substances. The approach is completely different, and the routine in this case is used as an enhancer, that however to work must be tied to that approach, it doesn&#039;t come by itself. Also in this case, still, you cannot go on for too long periods of time doing this, because it comes a point where or the routine &quot;breaks the spell&quot; (so to speak) or you can either risk of not being able to ground on this plane fully anymore.<br /><br />You are talking of two different things as if they should be the same when they obviously aren&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used many times psychedelics daily for certain periods of times to obtain something specific, so I know perfectly about their uses in this sense, but just for this I know in the same way perfectly, that this has NOTHING (absolutely nothing) to do with what you are talking about and what do you want to obtain from that daily use.

Like taking 10 grams, passing out and hitting your head sure that&#039;s going to cause damage but legit GHB is endogenous and safer to ingest than cannabis if done right. It puts next to no strain on your body to metabolize and is broken down into H2O and CO2 in a matter of hours. Now if your talking about using GBL like GHB that&#039;s a whole different story. Either way no drug should be used daily even something as benign as GHB or cannabis.

				The only psychedelics that I know of that will work (but you&#039;ll become tolerant still) if you take them all the time are ketamine, weed, and things like atropine and scopolamine (and other weird plants) (those aren&#039;t exactly psychedelics but it depends on what you&#039;re looking for).<br /><br />Ketamine will work everytime and make you trip if you take enough but you&#039;ll get addicted and grow a tolerance obviously... I wouldn&#039;t recommend using ketamine everyday as it&#039;s really not good for your health, but then again I wouldn&#039;t recommend using any psychedelic or any drug everyday. It&#039;s not the same kind of &quot;psychedelism&quot; as shrooms and such though, in fact, all the drugs below would be different.<br /><br />Weed will also keep working if you take it everyday but it&#039;s not a really strong psychedelic, unless you really take a lot in which case it&#039;s usually not pleasant, but it&#039;s up to you. You can become addicted as well and while the addiction isn&#039;t extremely strong it has been hard for some people I know to get of off.<br /><br />Antichlinergics : Atropine, Scopolamine (datura, mandrake,...) will make you trip each time too but it&#039;s usually not pleasant, and you can become addicted to those as well. Mandrake can be pleasant in low doses though, it acts like a sedative and is mildly psychedelic in those doses. Those drugs are dangerous/poisenous though.<br /><br />Wormwood has been reported to be a pleasant psychedelic (but not in the same sense as tryptamines), causing hallucinations, but it&#039;s also toxic and I don&#039;t know about its tolerance and addictive potential.<br /><br />Ibogaine/Iboga would work for everyday use, it has been used as a daily drug in France in the 60&#039;s under the name &quot;Lambarene&quot; (or something similar), which indicates that a daily dose works. A low dose will act like a pleasant mild psychelic with stimulant properties, according to anecdotal evidence. Medium to high doses would be too incapacitating for everyday use, the same goes for anticholinergics and ketamine, only low to mild doses could be used everyday.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend any of those for everyday usage, even weed, but I think the most pleasant one would be Iboga, it has been compared to MDMA in low doses but I don&#039;t know much about its toxicity and addictive potential. That it has been used as a herbal medicine for daily use may make it seem safe but just because it&#039;s a plant doesn&#039;t make it safe... <br />If you try Iboga out for everyday use you should document your trials, I&#039;d love to hear about it!

				Tolerance takes many forms, and it does not have to be chemical within the body to present itself as tolerance. One&#039;s mind is just as powerful as one&#039;s body is. You already claim to take various psychedelics for extremely long periods of time, so it seems to me you already have your answer. Eventually, something doesn&#039;t work. Either it isn&#039;t the same high, or it doesn&#039;t &quot;seem fun&quot; anymore. The only way to avoid this, is to moderate yourself.<br /><br />There are many things you can take every day, and reap the benefits to yourself without having to see the walls moving. What exactly are you trying to achieve by this desire to maintain a constant, persistent experience? Are you medicating a depression issue, or are you just seeking out the feeling(s)? This isn&#039;t meant to be invasive or insinuating, it is truly meant as a learning experience. Suffering from depression and going through doctors and meds, none of them worked and most of them I hated. I was a recluse and I generally moved through live avoiding accomplishments so I&#039;d blend in and no one would know the wiser. Then I discovered MDMA, and it was like erupting from an egg I&#039;d been in for a quarter of a century. Maintaining a therapeutic dosage and discovering what I could do to maintain this better outlook on life became a chore for me. Eventually I answered these two very questions for myself, and what was an &quot;as often as I could in a week&quot; thing, reduced to the weekend, and every so often a nice long weekend of outworldly enjoyment. It&#039;s neither unusual, nor unheard of, to discover ones real self in opening the mind through such events. Shrooms, and eventually LSD, had an equal if not even more powerful effect on me after I broadened my horizons, and I&#039;ve never looked back.<br /><br />But, that experience, also showed me the error of my original approach. Not only did it eventually have an opposite effect, but I became bored and even the opposite effect started decreasing. Chasing the high, was my failure, but I would have never found that without chasing it in the first place.<br /><br />Someone in this thread, suggested to take a little time off entirely, and see how you feel. You may be surprised at what you discover about yourself.<br /><br />If you truly still want to do this, then others have already covered this. The solutions, are all unsafe in one way or another... so, pursuing this will either require going a route that is unsafe, or coming to terms with the expense required/moderating the need to expend in the first place.
