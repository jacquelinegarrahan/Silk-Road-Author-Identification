				Hi everyone,<br />I&#039;m interested in trying DMT for the first time, however I&#039;m a bit concerned that I might not be &quot;ready&quot; for it.<br />I don&#039;t have many experiences with drugs other than weed, MDMA, and LSD, so I guess I&#039;m still a novice or whatever.<br />DMT has piqued my curiosity because of the stories I&#039;ve heard from others about how intense and immersive the experience is.<br />The thought of potentially having an experience like others makes me want to try, but at the same time, I have this underlying fear of what I might find, if anything, on the other side. <br /><br />Should I just take a leap of faith and try DMT? Or would it be best to experiment around with other psychedelics first, given my inexperience.<br /><br />Thanks all,<br />- sdesu

				I haven&#039;t managed to &quot;break through&quot; yet, hopefully in the next few days. Going off of what I&#039;ve experienced so far though there isn&#039;t much to fear. My biggest concern was that the smoke would be too harsh and make me feel like shit, giving me a bad trip. I found that after you inhale a little bit of it the drug seems to numb your senses to it, and you can actually hold it down pretty easily. (this is coming from someone who coughs after a few hits of MJ)<br /><br />As for what I experienced, it really wasn&#039;t frightening at all, it was way too interesting to be scary. The whole world became some kind of crazy cartoon for about 5 minutes. From what I understand though a breakthrough dose of DMT is a totally different experience and not even comparable.

				You should watch &quot;Enter the Void&quot; especially if your considering DMT for the first time - really good insight, though not specially about DMT per-say the director really captures the psychedelic experience. <br /><br />With regards to this being your first psychedelic experience I would be a little hesitant. But, it&#039;s all about dosage if you start small and work your way up, you should be fine. If your a straight edge, type A person prone to anxiety I might hold off and try some weed &gt; MDMA &gt; shrooms first.

				An expansive psychedelic resume is not a requirement. <br />i found the uplifting vibe to cancel out any fear that i had.&nbsp; If you can pay attention for 15 minutes, <br />it will heal your mind, body, and soul. <br />YMMV; EYOD&nbsp; (extract your own DMT!)<br /><br />Good Light,<br />Elvenkonge

				No, don&#039;t try DMT first for your own sake. You honestly cannot have a single clue what you&#039;re getting your mind into without first getting comfortable with other strong level psychedelics. At least try LSD and Magic Mushrooms several times before plunging into the depths of the universe. Seriously, DMT is an experience worth trying in your lifetime but not at your level of inexperience. Putting it simply by using the ranks of the Jedi, right now you&#039;re a Youngling, now the level you want to be at before embracing DMT is at least Jedi Knight (if not Jedi Master). Once you get comfortable enough with DMT....well hot damn that makes you a Jedi Grand Master! 8)<br /><br />

				If only I weren&#039;t so afraid to try it.<br /><br />I read so much about DMT and I like and enjoy dreaming but I am scared of trying it. Perhaps I am too much of a control freak.<br /><br />I.e. salvia freaked me out. Tried it a few times but I cant stand it. <br />Damn I got in an other world a few times (ok only 2 times lol) but this was the only drug I ever threw away. No way I will ever take it again. It does things to me... wow somtimes it feels like my body just slipped in pieces like in the movie &quot;The Cube&quot; and this weren&#039;t the other world experiences.... <br /><br />And DMT sounds like an other world for me, too. Maybe I will try it but I doubt it.

				I&#039;m sure its been said before..&nbsp; this one has a much higher standard deviation than most other drugs, kinda like salvia.&nbsp; Some people need more or less by a large factor.&nbsp; So start small, try more.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the replies everyone. I suppose the best thing for me to do (until I become a Jedi Knight&nbsp; ;D ) would be to continue exploring and preparing myself mentally and emotionally for the DMT experience. <br /><br />Special thanks to Winterjacket1 for the movie recommendation!

				Don&#039;t scare him away guys...DMT is such a beautiful thing...OP did say he&#039;s tripped on L before so he&#039;s at least aware of what psychedelics do.<br />Like someone else said if you&#039;re a bit nervous start small.&nbsp; Go out and buy a cheap meth pipe at a head shop they&#039;re the pipes with the flower in them.&nbsp; Maybe start with even less than 50mg in there..vaporize it..hold it in as long as you can and let go.&nbsp; I was definitely nervous my first time meeting dimitri but I started small and mostly only got the incredible body buzz and giggled for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Next, I stepped it up to a level I like to call lego land which i&#039;m very familiar with..went there a few times a day for a while..but I always had a hard time truly &quot;blasting off&quot; only been there a handful of times but somehow I always had the magic touch for holding the lighter for friends going to church with me...we&#039;ve had some sacred mornings&nbsp; ;).&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing to fear OP..just let go...although I&#039;ve had a few &quot;tough&quot; times integrating what the hell just happened to me you&#039;re back to baseline in a matter of minutes.&nbsp; Enjoy the journey youngling.

				Has anyone here ever smoked DMT while on shrooms? I&#039;m planning on doing it but am unsure if I should smoke the DMT during the peak of the trip or the comedown. I had my most intense DMT experience so far today but still didn&#039;t break through, It&#039;d really make this a 4/20 to remember if I managed to do it.

				This I&#039;m sure will be a pretty silly question, but as I&#039;m also thinking of trying DMT I&#039;m curious about one thing...<br />I wear glasses or contacts depending on the situation (I am short sighted, ie distant objects are blurry)... so if in the interests of some sort of safety in case I fall on my face, I was to not wear my glasses and because my eyes dry out when I&#039;m wearing contacts with my eyelids closed for a period of time... would I still be able to see the visuals if I have a breakthrough? Will my eyes be closed the entire time and as such my guess is everything will be as clear as it is during a dream?<br /><br />I will have a sitter with me but have been wondering about this.. as I said probably a pretty silly question but if anyone can answer, will put me out of my misery :)<br /><br />Also, have researched here and there about the different types of DMT the sellers on SR are selling, and there appear to be many types; from 1 blend of freebase crystals to another blend to herbs to liquids...<br /><br />If you had to choose between say these few what would you choose:<br />Jungle Spice - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/654deacc33<br />Freebase - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ff5986db7a<br />Changa - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/dcf26c4219<br /><br />Also wouldn&#039;t the herb be a bit more difficult to hide in an envelope than 1g of powder?

But I do know my friend I shared this experience with recently wears glasses and he claimed to be able to see everything, literally as in he could see everything in the entire universe! :o His life flashed by in a sequence of random memories, and he could see the breakdown of everything into atoms. Sounds wicked cool, I&#039;m pretty jealous because my trips have not been remotely close to that. Also, out of the three choices I&#039;ve heard Jungle Spice is much more potent than freebase but I can&#039;t say from experience. Freebase is a great choice in my opinion, as it&#039;s way better than Changa. Anything &#039;shapely&#039; will be more difficult to hide than powder by the way, after all that&#039;s just common sense.&nbsp; :P

				Thanks buddy, sounds exciting haha!<br />I think I&#039;m pretty much set with the freebase, being my first time I&#039;ll just go with the &quot;standard basic&quot; stuff and then see how I go from there...<br />From what I&#039;ve read on the dosage etc, 400mg should be good for around 8 good trips with a good chance of a breakthrough.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious as well while you&#039;re in the DMT hyperspace, how your mind deals with slight discomfort... still on the contacts topic - if I have my eyes closed for say 5 mins, they won&#039;t be in pain but won&#039;t be terrible comfortable. I&#039;m not worried about the discomfort, more so don&#039;t want it to distract my mind from the trip!

If you&#039;re worried though it might just be best to not wear contacts, or at the very least apply some cooling eye drops.

				Anyone here ever try smoking DMT soon after a shroom trip? I&#039;m wondering if there is going to be tolerance issues and would rather not waste product finding out
