				Back when I first joined this forum I did a little tutorial on how easily clean MDMA. <br />I was bored this afternoon and had a few grams of Aakoven&#039;s new batch of MDMA lying around so I thought I&#039;d do a little photo tutorial.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy :)<br />Pictures in link below.<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/md.jpg<br /><br />You&#039;ll need 3 beakers/ flasks, 2 pipettes, a spatula, some IPA, ether, acetone, MDMA, hot water.<br /><br />Place 1.0g MDMA in a beaker (fig 1).<br />Heat 10mL IPA in a conical flask immersed in freshly boiled water (cover flask with parafilm to stop water getting in). (fig 3).<br />Add 2mL of the hot IPA to the MDMA (fig 2).<br />It probably won&#039;t dissolve immediately so cover the beaker with parafilm and immerse in freshly boiled water (fig 4). <br />Don&#039;t swirl too much or MD will stick to the sides of the beaker and crystallise out.<br />In solution! (fig 5)<br />Allow to cool to room temp then put in fridge for 1/2 hour, then freezer for 1 hour (fig 6). <br />Cool about 10ml of both acetone and ether in the freezer for an hour.<br />Crystals covered in IPA solution of yellow impurities (fig 7).<br />Remove the IPA with a pipette and wash the remaining crystals sequentially 5mL of ether then acetone then ether again. (Fig 8)<br />Crystals look cleaner with each wash (fig 9).<br />Scrape crystals out onto clean surface and dry under a lamp, I took this photo immediately after washing (fig 11).<br />After 1 hour of drying they were super sparkly!<br />Marquis results (fig 10, left to right- crude, white gunk which coprecipitated out, clean sparkles).<br /><br />I got 930mg pure back from the 1g I started with. When I crystallised it out, there were the usual needles plus some weird white gunky material which I fished out with a spatula, I reheated the beaker to get the rest of it to go back into solution then cooled again and there was no more gunk.<br />The gunky crap weighed just over 50mg, dried to a fine white powder and tested black with marquis (middle vial on fig 10). Obviously it&#039;s very empirical but it didn&#039;t taste of MDMA! :P Not a clue what it is, maybe just some polymorph of MDMA? <br />Aakoven- maybe you could finely grind up 100mg of this new batch and take it to a test centre? It&#039;s probably fine but would be nice to know how pure it is.<br />

				wowzers I&#039;d be scared to put in a g of mdma and lose it down the sink somehow! Is there a non-mdma substance we can practice with? Flour maybe?, sugar?<br /><br />Also, whats the best way to convert chunky little mdma crystals (about 2 mm diameter) into powder? I&#039;m thinking something like a mirror + credit card.. but cleaner of better even....<br /><br />

				Pro chemist tip number 1: never chuck anything away until you&#039;ve got the product weighed out, then in the worst case scenario you can boil off the solvent and start again. There&#039;s really nothing that can go wrong if you follow the steps exactly. I did 400 quids worth this afternoon, I wouldn&#039;t risk losing that unless I was confident it would all come out the other end...<br /><br />Why do you want to turn your chunks of MDMA into powder? The little sparkly needles you get out the end of this tutorial are very fine and brittle and can be chopped up into micro-fine dust with a card or razor, you can even snort them whole- they melt up your nose and the drip is quite &#039;refined&#039; compared to the impure stuff.

				until i get some scales i shall have to eyeball the doses (from 0.5g baggie). so i think the powder will be easier to manage than the rocks. i forgot about a razor. best invest when i visit the store next.<br /><br />would people be doing this with their molly powder or their pills too?&nbsp; i guess pills would be good to get the mdma away from the filler. but would it sacrifice the mda.. if the pill had mda....

				Pills are harder as the binder will often turn to slime in IPA/ acetone and it&#039;s hard to crystallise a pure compound out of chewing gum :) I extracted the MD out of one of SKYY&#039;s pink stars earlier to give him an estimate of it&#039;s contents but it was a bit more convoluted than the tutorial (NaOH, then extract into ether, reprecipitate from HCl/IPA, then wash with ether/ acetone).

				It will work yeah but anhydrous is best if you want to recover the maximum amount of product and get non-hydrated crystals.<br />I&#039;m actually trying a hot water / acetone recrystallisation now but I&#039;m expecting it to take a few days at least to crystallise out, I&#039;ll post my findings.

				12 years in total (I&#039;m 28), left school, lots of home experimenting, a couple of degrees including 2 years of research then a few years of lab jobs. Currently doing crap science job agency work and looking for something more full time in this dire job market. TWhen learning chemistry is not just read about drug chemistry (about 10 reactions cover 90% of illicit drug chemistry)- learn thermodynamics, kinetics, carbohydrate chemistry, biosynthesis, radical and photochemistry etc. An awesome book for beginners is Organic Chemistry by Clayden et al (OUP).

				Wowzers,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, thanks for the awesome quick guide, and pictures!&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;(late bump)<br />Second, I believe I read somewhere that to make larger crystals/rocks you need to slow down the cooling process. So would cooling it in the fridge for ~12 hours, the moving to the freezer ~12 hours, make larger crytals form?&nbsp; ???<br />I&#039;m intrested in cleaning up the product (to see how pure it is), and recrystalizing it to bigger rocks!<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; 8)

				Old-thread bump!&nbsp; ???<br /><br />I didn&#039;t realize diethyl ether would be hard to find (compared to u).<br />Would anything else work in it&#039;s place?<br />Otherwise i&#039;ll have to work on a sketchy extraction...&nbsp; :-\

				Yes diethyl ether is hard to get in the USA.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go around asking for it -- you will just arouse suspicion.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have ether, you could probably just wash a couple times with cold dry acetone instead of ether-acetone-ether.&nbsp; Should be good enough, but make sure it is dry!
