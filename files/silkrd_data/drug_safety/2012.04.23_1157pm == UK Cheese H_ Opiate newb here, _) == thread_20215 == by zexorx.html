				So i ordered some &quot;UK Cheese heroin&quot; from the afghanapothecary. According to him this cheese is 45% h#3 and 45% dimenhydrinate (antihistamine). Ive never tried h before. Ive done hydrocodone once and hydromorphone 3 or 4 times so i would say i have no tolerance. I would like to know what other people who have ordered this same product think about it, and also if i may be doing something wrong with the way i have been administering it. Ive probably snorted all together about .3 of it over the course of today, seperated into about 8 lines. However i seemed to only be able to achieve a slight and short acting buzz. Perhaps the way im snorting it is wrong, or perhaps i didnt crush it into a fine enough powder? I dont know. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

				afaik cheese or scramble as it&#039;s called over here (us) is most effective when injected. <br />Now that you have a feel for it, you may just need to do a little more at one go. Maybe the remaining .2 in three lines. <br />Although it would probably be best to wait a while until what you have already taken clears your system, preferably tomorrow.<br />If I were you i would skip the cheese next time and head straight to the raw.&nbsp; Make sure you have a good scale and start small.
