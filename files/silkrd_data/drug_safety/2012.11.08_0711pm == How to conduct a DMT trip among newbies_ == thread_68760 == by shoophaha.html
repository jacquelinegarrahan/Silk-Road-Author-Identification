				Hello! Four of my friends and I are interested in trying DMT. All are experienced with LSD, shrooms, 2C-series, and other psychedelics, as well as MDMA and other drugs. Because of DMT&#039;s unique nature—it only lasts a few minutes and then has a 30 minute comedown, from what I&#039;ve read—I was wondering what the best way to conduct the trip would be.<br /><br />a) Obviously we should sit for each other so should maybe two people go at a time? Or one person at a time, then the next goes while the previous person is coming down and feels like they&#039;re in reality? <br /><br />b) From what I&#039;ve read 50-70 mg seems like a good dose; is this correct? I&#039;m going by 1 mg/kg, erring on the lower side.<br /><br />c) How do we best smoke it? Should we fill a bowl with a little tobacco and put the DMT on top, and then try to take it all in a few hits? (Not sure if using weed instead is a good idea, considering how it interacts with other psychedelics). I did read about holding the lighter away so it melts rather than gets burned.<br /><br />Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

				i do it with people their first time in a dark room with little light and a relaxing song without lyrics, not to many people in the room maybe 3 or 4 max(it gets weird tripping and knowing there are a bunch of sober people watching you)<br /><br />one person at a time, if someone freaks out you dont want it to mess up everyone elses trip<br /><br />you just needd to smoke a little bit if you know how to smoke it the right way<br /><br />dont put the dmt on top of anything to smoke it, that is a huge waste<br /><br />what you need is the vaporizer pipe, they sell them as oil burners in most smoke shops(the ball pipe with the rose in it)<br />direct heat will ruin the dmt thats why a vap pipe is needed<br /><br />i have been doing extraction teks with MHRB for a couple years now and i have helped people go on a lot of spiritual journeys<br /><br />and that is pretty much how i have succeded at that<br />good luck

				Thanks! I don&#039;t really want to spend money on more equipment which I&#039;ll use only infrequently... We have plenty of glass bowls and homemade GBs so we&#039;re hoping to use one of those.

				Brotha!!!! I&#039;m very excited for you!<br /><br />So i have picked up over 30g+ of DMT freebase so i am pretty experienced with sending people off.<br /><br />Technique:<br /><br />For this it sounds like your not wanting to buy anything else, so the best way would be a clean pipe with a decent size bowl.<br /><br />Next you wanna layer the bottom of the bowl with some weed/tobacco enough to cover the bottom and get you a nice long flat surface of weed packed halfway up the bowl.<br /><br />Next you wanna measure out .07 on the scale and sprinkle it over the cannabis evenly, trying to avoid the walls (it sticks and gets wasted).<br /><br />Next pack a decent amount of weed on top of the DMT.&nbsp; It is imperative you cover the DMT substantially because fire will break down dmt and you will get a bunk trip.<br /><br />Now when you smoke it you try to light the top weed ONLY!&nbsp; Slowly smoke it until you can taste the DMT.&nbsp; At this point you have a 30 second window to man the fuck up and get as much in you as possible.&nbsp; Just nice and slowly keep pulling on it and holding it for about 3-4 seconds.<br /><br />Shoot for about 3-4 nice good DMT hits.<br /><br />As for how many people should, it should be 1... one at a time by yourself in front of a computer or TV playing some tribal or peaceful music.&nbsp; Classical works amazing.&nbsp; If you like energetic music try glitch mob - Animus Vox or fortune days.<br /><br />CLOSE YOUR EYES!&nbsp; i know this sounds contradictory to the fact that i told you to sit in front of a TV.... but trust me... if you close your eyes and you use your imagination for the trip....well good sir... be ready to explore a new world.&nbsp; The TV is there just in case you feel overwhelmed with the entities/visuals... it kinda snaps you back to reality when you open your eyes.<br /><br />This my friend will be an experience of a life time, it can be overwhelming at first but if you relax accept that the universe create you it will not harm you, you will be just fine.&nbsp; Embrace the adventure because it will be amazing.<br />

				Definitely limit the number of people present, and make sure that there is at least one sitter at all times. <br />In regards to music, I haven&#039;t noticed a difference in my trips based on what music is playing. I tend to have almost the same exact visuals/experience whether I&#039;m listening to Sigur Ros, Ephixa, or Mogwai. <br />Bright lighting can make for an interesting come-up and comedown visual experience especially right before and right after the plateau. Try looking at a wooden door, carpet, or your face in the mirror (or anything with an abstract pattern). <br /><br />If you do the sandwich method, be sure to just barely hold the flame on top of the cannabis. The heat will cause the DMT underneath to vaporize for you. Take slow and steady hits - it will taste weird, so don&#039;t try to take a huge hit very quickly because you will cough.<br /><br />sdesu

				Hi guys sorry for being offtopic but there is no point in starting a new thread.<br /><br />Could someone clarify for me what is the difference between:<br />DMT - freebase<br />5-MeO-DMT<br />Changa<br />I am more than excited to try this. I previously did shit loads of weed, ketamine (never K-hole), coke, 25i-nbome, 25c, mephedrone, 2c-b, mdma and probably more.<br />I am fairly new to the psychedelic scene so I&#039;m sure that the DMT will blow my mind. I just want to clarify what is the difference between ones listed above.<br /><br />At the moment I am planning to go for 1g DMT freebase because the price seems fair and the reviews of the vendor are really good. +From the trip reports I&#039;ve read the freebase seems the most amazing experience.<br /><br />thank you in advance.<br />

				if you dont like weed i found tea leaves work wonders as tobacco is too harsh and DMT is the worst thing you will ever inhale and survive and your gonna wanna make sure you get it all in one hit otherwise you will just be paralysed for like 5 minutes

				50 to 70 mg is to much for first timers.&nbsp; &nbsp;30 mg should be your first try.<br />Dont torch the dmt, you want to vaporize it, sandwich it inbetween some weed and light the bowl and let the cherry burn in to the dmt<br />

				Hey. I recently tried DMT for the first time with 5 other friends. I have done it twice since then and I am going to be doing it my fourth time tonight.<br /><br />To answer your question based on my research prior to doing it and having done it now...<br /><br />a) We all took it in turns, one after another, the main reason was because i bought the GVG Sherlock so that was the only way we could smoke/vapourize. We were all quite nervous when we first did it but knowing i had friends around me made it easier (the second time i did DMT i did it all on my own and i think i actually preferred it that way)<br /><br />b) For your first time, thats a big dose... try 30mg and see how it goes... in all fairness after doing 30mg my next hit was 50mg but im glad i went with 30mg first.<br /><br />c) I&#039;d have to say buy a GVG Sherlock if you can afford it, i wasnt to keen on the idea of using a home made device with tobacco ash. If you are going to go down the DIY/bong route... make sure the flame doesnt touch the spice as this will destroy the active compound making it weaker and taste like burning plastic.<br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />Enjoy your trip to hyperspace!

I like to take a Shamanic approach to journeying. Being gentle, soft and responsible in my energetic approach to the person is paramount. Nothing beats (so far that I have experienced) coming down on a secluded beach surrounded by native bush with the waves and bird song enveloping you. The walk back through nature provides a smooth transition for reflection.<br /><br />But whatever. Go well &lt;3
