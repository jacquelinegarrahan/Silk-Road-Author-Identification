				Just wondering if anyone has any creative methods of measuring out doses of H besides an expensive milligram scale.&nbsp; I have a scale, but it&#039;s only accurate to 0.1g.&nbsp; For quality H I need something a little more accurate.&nbsp; I used to have a tiny spoon that worked wonderfully, but I lost it somewhere.&nbsp; Ever since my friend OD&#039;d a while back, I dont feel comfortable with the eyeball method anymore.&nbsp;

				Measure it volumetrically, and then just shoot the liquid if you use needles, and if you don&#039;t use needles then evaporate all the water you used to measure volumetrically and you&#039;ll be left with powder whose mass is defined by how concentrted you made it when you made a solution from it (eg. 10mg/ml&nbsp; if you take 1ml and evaporate off the water you will have 10mg of H).<br /><br />Idea is you buy a mass you can weigh on your scale, put that whole mass in a known volume of water, eg. you have 500mg, add that to 50ml and you&#039;ll have 500mg/50ml .... or 10mg/ml)<br /><br />Balz is right though, you can purchase the best 0.001 DRUG SCALE (read: Jeweler scale, a REAL 0.001 analytical balance doesn&#039;t start until around $750) for like &lt; $100.&nbsp; I believe one of the most popular about is the AWS GeminiPro.

				They have mg scales on ebay or amazon that are accurate with in 3mg or so, for like $35 dollars shipped. <br /><br />The rule of thumb for H use is; to always always always start with a finely chopped/powdered MATCH HEAD SIZED BUMP, when ever you get a new bag or batch. From a match head sized bump, you wait 20-30min and you can gauge its quality, strength and legs that way.
