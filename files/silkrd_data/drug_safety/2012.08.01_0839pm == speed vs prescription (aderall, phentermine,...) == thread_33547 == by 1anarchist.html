				hello all,<br /><br />was wondering if people would post their experiences of speed vs a prescription meth (aderall, phentermine...)<br /><br />i&#039;ve previously used a stack of aspirin and phentermine to lose weight and my body responds well but prescriptions are expensive and looking for a similar affect with something lower cost.&nbsp; <br /><br />how do you know the quality of the speed when you buy?<br /><br />thanks<br />

				If you are looking to loose weight then look no further than MDPV.<br />Just teat it with the utmost respect, its dangerous stuff if taken often or recreationaly.<br /><br /><br />Where i live speed is used as a broad term that could include almost any stimulant (usualy methamphetamine cut with random shit, often those prescription stimulants), classically speed refers to amphetamine though.<br /><br />You don&#039;t know the quality. Best you can do is test with reagents and judge for yourself.

				As a way to lose weight phentermine is great.&nbsp; For recreation it is good to very good depending on your tolerance and physical/mental make-up.&nbsp; I just got sibutramine in but haven&#039;t listed it yet.&nbsp; It&#039;s another type of amphetamine-like weight loss aid (both reduce appetite) but the mechanism of action is different between the two.&nbsp; I hope to know more about sibutramine after a few more days of &quot;analysis&quot;.<br /><br />Neither is a true amphetamine but both are structurally related to amphetamines.

				Don&#039;t rely on amphetamines or their near relations for the purposes of weight loss; You may suppress your appetite &amp; affect the metabolic system, but the weight you save in the first instance you will gain back and more when you stop taking it; This is why there are fat tweakers, because they did not fall fully into the category of wanton addicts, and end up with withered and emaciated stick figures instead. It&#039;s also the case that amp is not much good for working out and general exercise, as the added cardiac stress can be hazardous, and the vasoconstrictive effects mean less oxygen less efficiently for rapidly tiring muscles. Overall, not a good idea. Just maintain a reasonable defecit in your calorie intake vs expenditure, and incorporate resistance exercises heavily into your routine, ahead of cardio.

				By speed I assume you mean methamphetamine. SInce amphetamine is basically Adderall.<br />Both will give you a similar high, especially if you havent experimented much with either. Meth has a longer euphoric effect and is more potent as a weight loss aid.<br />You will regain most of the weight with either if you suddenly stop taking them. Meth will take llonger to regain the weight because it speeds up your metabolism much more so than adderal + ect.And both you will quickly gain a greater tolerance for also. <br />MDPV , some people swear by it . My experience with it was not pleasant, I felt like I was at the worst part of coming down off meth, like if you did a giant line and burned out at 3 am and had no more. Some people really like it tho.<br />Ephedrine works well for weight loss, it may be more physically stressful on your body though ( this may also just be propaganda the authorities use to skew favor of banning ephedrine in my state.-i highly suspect anyways.)
