				hey MW, just so you know it depends on which gear you end up getting. if you get that vendor&#039;s or some that comes from the EU then it is usually #3 which is the freebase form of diamorphine. This form is not water soluble so you add the acid which reacts with the base forming a salt which is soluble. A tiny bit of a slightly acidic solution in the blood evidently is not a huge problem because of the wonderful buffering capacity. There are actually many methods to buffer the blood and maintain a narrow pH range because of how important it is, even including certain proteins with histidine residues which can grab some of the hydrogen ions interestingly. This number #3 is always cut because it is the form actually intended for smoking or snorting and adding some things like caffeine make it vaporize better. <br /><br />If you end up purchasing from tony or wumg, which i would highly recommend for snorting or poking... then you dont even need the acid since it will dissolve cleanly into aqueous solution as is. This form is #4 which is the salt form already, but this form burns rather than vaporizes mainly so if smoked, wastes most of the product. Both of their stuff is awesome quality and I dont think you will be disappointed. I love tony cause he cares about the customer and if you can afford the pebbles that is pretty much the best H ever. Just be safe if you go with them... their product is so potent is actually very dangerous, and important to start extremely small if you are IVing... please be safe I love you bro. <br /><br />Also, if you can get it there is actually bacteriostatic water or solutions of 0.9% benzyl alcohol I think or something that people use to inject which is sterile and inhibits microorganism growth. However, if you do not have access to these, you can just use distilled water, but please do not use tap water certainly. <br /><br />Remember you can always do more, but if you do too much you can never go back and undo the mistake. Good luck, Stay safe bro<br />- miR
