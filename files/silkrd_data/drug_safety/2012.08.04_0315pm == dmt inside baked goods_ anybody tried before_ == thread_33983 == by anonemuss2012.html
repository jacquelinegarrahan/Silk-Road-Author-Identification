				I recently came into contact with someone who extracts dmt and administers it inside baked goods. i can&#039;t seem to find any information on this. has anybody tried this? do you know about dosing using this route? i&#039;m sure there&#039;s someone here with some expertise&nbsp; 8)

				thats fucking stupid.&nbsp; DMT is not orally active without an MAOI.&nbsp; and if you were to take some caapi tea or syrian rue to make the DMT active, it would probably make you puke up the baked good.&nbsp; a gelcap would be way better than a cookie.&nbsp; <br /><br />it boggles my mind that someone would put in all that research and work to extract the DMT but not do the slightest bit of reading on how to use it.&nbsp; ::facepalm::

				hahaha yeah right? i&#039;ve never tried dmt before, so i&#039;ve been reading up on it and didn&#039;t find any instances where oral dmt was disguised as a cupcake. it&#039;s supposed to be a gift to me, so if i end up eating half a cupcake with no/ill effects, i might have to flush it down the toilet. or just get stoned and have a novelty snack haha
