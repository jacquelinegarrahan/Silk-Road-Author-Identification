				Hello everyone!<br /><br />I have consumed something like 5-10 grams of China White in Laos/Cambodia/Burma in 2010-2011 and about a month ago I tried MindGuru&#039;s No.4 which I thought was great. - This question is not relevant anymore and the project was put on a halt!<br /><br />Stay safe!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />PERREY

				The standard answer is no one can tell you. It really depends on you tolerance and the purity of the smack.<br /><br />If you can feel threshold effects off of 100 mg of codeine then I&#039;d suggest starting really low. 100 mg of codeine is equivalent to only 5 mg of heroin. So maybe start around 10-15 mg and work your way up. Poking yourself a bunch of times must suck but it&#039;s got to be better than getting narcan&#039;d or dying. <br /><br />I&#039;d say snort or smoke some of the H you&#039;re getting depending on if It&#039;s a base or a salt to see how potent it is. Try to do this with every batch so you have an idea of how strong it is. Also I don&#039;t shoot but I&#039;d strongly recommend investing in some micron filters. What you&#039;re IVing is not pharmaceutical grade and it could&#039;ve been up ten ass holes before it got to you. Micron filters will even filter out bacteria and your circulatory system will thank you. By shooting drugs directly into your bloodstream you&#039;re passing all your body&#039;s natural defense systems...<br /><br />Tell us how it turns out!

				I agree that 30mg is an excellent starting dose. I have experience with opioids but do not have a tolerance due to sporadic and infrequent use. Most of my use is opium that I harvest from poppies I grow and score myself. Curiosity had me pick up some number 4 heroin a few times (my subjective experience is that it&#039;s pleasant, but not as good as opium. I suspect I&#039;m missing the gene which gives rise to euphoria from taking opioids, which might skew my view.) and I found that 30mg of number 4 was quite enough for an initial dose. At this dosage walking and talking weren&#039;t an issue, but use of power tools was definitely off the menu. A few hours later an additional dose of 30-40mg was sufficient to keep me toasted till bedtime, and then led to the dream infested and restless sleep that accompanies opiate use.<br /><br />If you have a number of syringes (a fresh syringe every time) and accurate scales and don&#039;t increase the size of the dose about 30mg with any repeat administrations you ought to be fine.<br /><br />As a much more experienced user than I said, &#039; You can always put more in, but you can&#039;t take it back out.&#039;

Some people develop unfortunate fixations with the IV route. Other people have no issue and seem to treat it as a clinical approach to efficient administration.<br /><br />No3 if a base and No4 is a salt. You&#039;ve got it right. Standard rules for alkaloids and alkaloid salts apply.

				I always suggest starting off with 10mg IV to see where it gets you. If you&#039;ve got some tolerance, it likely won&#039;t get you as high as you&#039;d like, but you can always wait a few minutes and do some more. And use a a .2 micron wheel filter! The only thing cotton is good for is getting the little visible floaties out.<br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m aware that what I&#039;m suggesting is very conservative, but I feel like you can&#039;t be too careful with heroin, especially when you&#039;re first trying out IV use.

				You could try smoking before IV. #4 is no good for smoking though so you&#039;d have to get #3. Smoking gives an instant hit like IV but no overdose danger. I have smoked and IVed many times and I honestly prefer smoking because you can control the high more. So get some #3 and smoke it!

				Not to be a prick or anything but the number system goes like this:<br /><br />#1-Morphine<br />#2-Heroin Base<br />#3-Heroin HCl mixed(usually 50/50) with caffeine to lower the melting point for smoking<br />#4-Heroin HCl

				That&#039;s wrong. #3 is a base. <br /><br />I know because strreet heroin here (and in the rest of Europe) is #3 and must be mixed with citric acid before it can be IVed.

				Hey perrey, dont even think about try 180 mg of frank&#039;s stuff (or other hq #4..) unless you thinking a nice way to say adios to everybody...<br />i would be careful even with 30 mg....i remember my very first experience with needles and i was putting in the spoon quantities that now would be unthinkable...<br />try in 10-15 mg increments, like somebody already told ya, you can always add but never take it back!<br />also would be a very good idea, i would say even a rule number 1, having somebody with you who you can trust, an overdose is not a big deal if treated promptly...one of the reason why i&#039;m still here is that in my first times, expecially dealing with different dealers, when you never know what the potency of the gear youre getting, i always get someone with me, even offer him/her a shot but just in case anything would happen you have somebody who can call an ambulance and save your life...<br />have fun but stay safe guys, please!!<br />ppfld <br /><br />ps: i&#039;ve never had stuff from the golden triangle (as far as i know..) i&#039;m really curious to know how different is from Franks gear, wich i think is nice stuff... fyi i have quite a tolly, i&#039;m on methadon script, 70 mg actually i&#039;m more on the 50mg nowadays..., i can handle a 180 mg shot no prob but i usually shoot around 100mg and feel it nicely...
