				Hey guys, I&#039;m a noob at this, looking for some help. I got a half gram of the good molecule from fractalbliss (can definitely recommend!). I just ordered an ounce of syrian rue from amazon for five bucks shipped (wow, who knew).<br /><br />So I understand that a quickie pharmahuasca is to take about 4 grams of the ground up seeds a half hour before the DMT. How much DMT? Is water good or is there another drink that potentiates the mix better or lessens body load?

				It all depends how strong of a trip you want. 100mg will give you a nice body high, 150mg will step up the visuals and make you want to sit on your ass, and 200mg is considered very strong with a heavy body load and visuals.<br /><br />I have personally done 3g of rue and 250mg of DMT which completely immobilized me for a few hours and make me see colors and shapes even with my eyes open. I was lying down and didn&#039;t move at all. I don&#039;t recommend this for your first time, try 200mg. Ive heard that drinking grapefruit juice before/during the trip also potentiates it, although I think that stuff tastes terrible.<br /><br />And you&#039;ve probably heard it a thousand times but make sure to follow an MAOI diet a day before you start your trip. I ate only bread and fruits for 12 hours and then didn&#039;t any anything for another 12, I also guzzled water like crazy.<br /><br />Good luck with the tripping man! Let us know how it goes<br /><br />And save some of that spice for smoking too!

				I have some seeds too, but I have not worked up the courage to try it yet.<br /><br />Not sure what to expect in the way of intensity. If it is anything like smoking it then I am going to be unable to move around for hours.

				Hehe, wouldn&#039;t surprise me ;D I save my SR freebase DMT for smoking, I use the stuff I extract myself from MHRB for oral DMT trips. I&#039;m not exactly an expert in any sense when it comes to extractions. Dosages given are just from my experiences.<br /><br />I was going to try 250mg of my freebase I got from Asylum, maybe I wont do that much after alll...<br /><br />

				Ok so I&#039;m ready to do this guys! Will report back when I&#039;m done but just wanted to double check. I have 4 or 5 grams in capsules of syrian rue powder and I&#039;m going to try it with about 100mg of DMT powder. Wash down the caps with grapefruit juice, wait half an hour then spike the rest of the grapejuice with the DMT and drink? Is this correct?<br /><br />Will wait for some last minute thoughts before doing this, I&#039;ve got patience lol!!

I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a lot that can be tweaked to get the full-on experience but I can pretty much say that the simplest route is a waste of time and precious deem.<br /><br />What I did was take a spoonful of Rue seeds and wash them down with a little diet soda. I waited 50 minutes then downed a gel cap full of freebase DMT weighed out to approx 100mg with the rest of the soda.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t deel the DMT at all. I got a bit of an alcohol buzz from the Rue but that&#039;s about it.
