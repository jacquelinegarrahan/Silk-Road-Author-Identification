				There would be little to no difference between tablets and capsules containing the same substance.<br /><br />Typical ssri&#039;s are not fast acting substances anyway - if you start a treatment of something like prozac or citalopram, expect at the very least a week before you experience any positive effects of the treatment. You may experience side effects more quickly though, its fairly common for someone that takes SSRI&#039;s for the first time to feel bad within 48 hours of beginning treatment. The sensation is odd to describe, it can be a bit flu-like, or the idea that you are on uppers and downers at the same time. You can have paradoxical syptoms like a combination of elevated heart rate and activity combined with a sense of serious fatigue at the same time.<br /><br />These sensations will fade within a week of beginning treatment though. After that you will experience other unwanted effects, such as apathy, and sexual dysfunction in you are male. <br /><br />The side effects are a hefty price to pay for the benefits in many cases, and can make you feel more desperate then ever before. I could quote that has &quot;i do not want to jump in from of a train anymore, but i would not mind walking under one by accident either&quot;.<br />

				Reuptake inhibitors do out outperform placebo except in the most severe cases.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t do anything for you don&#039;t let those stupid pharma-shilling psychiatrists feed you new ones every few months.&nbsp; It&#039;ll just fuck you up more.

				Obviously not - if one of them proves ineffective, don&#039;t bother with another one. <br /><br />Things like prozac or citalopram come with different labels, and so do bottles of different brands of scotch.

				eli lilly started forming prozac into liquid-filled &quot;pulvules&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these were supposedly better absorbed/ faster acting etc..<br /><br /><br /><br />if youre looking for the strongest and cleanest SSRI regarding SERT inhibition and liver metabolism/ drug interactions..... go with escitalopram&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LEXAPRO&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cleanest and easiest SSRI to take on the market, plus it&#039;s effective at doses as low as 10mg..... fuck taking 20-50-100-200-400mg zoloft/ paxil/ effexor
