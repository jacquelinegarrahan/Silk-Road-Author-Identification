				Monday my boy wakes me up from my lovely evening nap to see if Im going to be home the next day. He then proceeds to tell me hes getting some molly from an old skooler he knows and wants me to guinne pig, so I agree I mean whose to turn down some free rolls after a bad birthday and exams. So I had to eat that day I just had to. He comes over at 3 gives me one we smoke some bowls; hes coughing, Im not. So by now Im not feeling much or seeing much in my pupils, so about a hour later I remember I ate. He gives me another one it weighed .43(keep in mind he got some caped and powdered) and in like 15 I feel something I smiled kinda couldn&#039;t help it and next thing I know were sharing music and I&#039;m talking about FF8&#039;s music while Im playing the game. Long story short like hours later with big ass eyes I went to take a piss, and I was peeing relaxing and like I almost fell over/on my knees while peeing. Anyone else ever have this happen under the influence of heavy serotongetic drugs?<br /><br />I know .6-.7 is alot it wasnt heavy on my heart like 4mmc, I didnt inted to get fed that much. I just wanna know about the feeling of passing out while pissing is that common on big doses? I have no intent on it happening again.

				If you took .6 or .7 of legitimate MDMA, I would say that the experience would have been a lot worse than what you described... Especially if you only took two doses. That&#039;s a fuckton of MDMA. A metric fuckton. Probably wasn&#039;t MDMA if those were the real doses. I doubt it would have even been Methylone, tbh... even that shit would at least have had you with some serious tachycardia at that dose.

				yeah, definitely not MDMA, or if it was MDMA, then the weights of the caps were wrong or it was cut to all hell.

				Judging by the dose, it just sounds like rather low quality mephedrone to me...

				When I was looking at his quarter it didnt smell like a cathion, my heart wasnt sped up. Low qual meph doesnt sound right. Iv binged on a gram of drone before it went onto the csa and my heart feelt real speedy even from when it was shards, nor did I have the sweat or urge to redose and I had no where as hard of a time peeing as I did Tuesday, never heard of anyone blacking out while peeing on 4mmc . I mean 00 caps weigh .1 don&#039;t they?

				I hope it was molly, makes me feel better when I talk to others but I found this site with googleing, methylone/m1 comes up with no results, and I was poping my ears while rolling so......... this post <br />I found makes sense<br /><br />&quot;It was syncope - he had just had a piss - was on mdma, which fucks up all your homeostasis in itself, and he wouldve been valsalvaing to pass urine.&quot;<br /><br /><br />micturition syncope
