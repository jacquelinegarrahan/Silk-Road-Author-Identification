				Had some spare coinage and thought I&#039;d give this RC a day in court.<br /><br />Anyone had any experience with this?<br />Seems to be precious little info out there.<br /><br />I love MDMA, and I use that often. So, I&#039;m not expecting great things from MDAI, but gonna give it a bash anyway. <br /><br />Thoughts? Just capped and necked 400mg. So, dosage advice isn&#039;t needed at this point. lol

				I think that`s too much. Especially for a first time... But don&#039;t freak out...<br />Report back!!<br /><br />&nbsp;short description for the noobs<br />MDAI is supposed to give that increased empathy and increased sense of touch like MDMA but without&nbsp; strong stimulation or euphoria. <br />Usually used in combination with MDMA and not alone because its does not have strong effects...<br />a common dose should be around 100 mg. This is what everyone should aim for on their first times... <br /><br />

				Subbing this thread because I want to see how you get on :D<br /><br />400mg is quite a bit, probably equivalent to maybe 250-280mg MDMA.

				Well, 3 hours later and it&#039;s pretty much all over. Not impressed tbh. <br /><br />My normal mdma dose is 300mg. I&#039;m not a regular user, but when I do use I like to go big. Maybe 4 - 5 times a month with a single 300mg dose. <br /><br />400mg MDAI has not been a very memorable experience.<br />Not eaten a great deal today, so I was expecting something a little more than I got. <br /><br />About 40 mins after swallowing the cap I started to feel something. Not sure what exactly, but definitely a similar feeling to an MDMA come-up. Only, watered down.<br /><br />About an hour in, things looked promising. Felt some slight euphoric-ish sensations. And definitely felt the same squirmy happy feeling that I get from MDMA, but again, very diluted.<br /><br />Two hours in, moderately buzzing. But no body high at all. No dilated pupils, no teeth clenching, no long sighing, or sexual stimulation. (I always get super horny on MDMA).&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, just over three hours later, it&#039;s all over. :/ <br />Feel tired and ready for bed.<br /><br />No nausea, no headache, no bad side effects etc..&nbsp; but a *really* tame high.<br /><br />No wonder this stuff is so cheap, lol.<br />Definitely won&#039;t be ordering any more. <br /><br />I hear it&#039;s better when combined with other substances, but meh. Too weak for my tastes.

				MDAI is supposed to be a selective serotonin releaser. MDMA releases dopamine and norepinephrine in addition to serotonin. My guess is that the dopamine has a real synergistic effect that contributes to the euphoria. I&#039;ve always been curious what a &quot;pure serotonin&quot; high might feel like. Maybe it&#039;s not that great.<br /><br />On the other hand, it&#039;s hard to verify if a chemical is really MDAI since I would think it&#039;s kind of rare to come by.
