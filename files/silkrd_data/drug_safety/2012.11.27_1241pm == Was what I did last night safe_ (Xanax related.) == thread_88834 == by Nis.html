				Ok, this is probably going to sound very dumb, so thankfully I&#039;m anonymous. Last night I had already smoked a few bowls, and we were about to smoke a blunt. The last bowl we smoked before it apparently had a Xanax crushed up and mixed in with the weed. It was one of the pink ones I think. We smoked that bowl, but I could barely even taste the Xanax (or maybe I was just really high) and I don&#039;t think I felt anything different in the high.<br /><br />I&#039;ve researched it a bit since last night and apparently it offers no extra effects, wastes a pill, and probably isn&#039;t safe.<br /><br />My question is: if I just had that one-time incident involving that kind of thing, and I don&#039;t do it anymore, am I going to see any bad long-term effects from that? In retrospect I realize it was a stupid thing to do, and I wouldn&#039;t want myself to come to long-term harm because of it. I&#039;m going to try and educate my friend on how it&#039;s a bad idea, also.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				Hahahahahaha&nbsp; &nbsp;what a waste of a xannie. never seen a pink one before.<br />Educate your mate on how wasteful he is, people pay good money for those.<br />But na mate your all sweet. No health effects as far as i know. <br />Just dont mix em with meth you&#039;ll fuck your heart/blood pressure.<br />And I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re pretty bad with alcohol too. <br />Have a good one bro.

				If you are still young and just now getting into the pill scene - tread your waters carefully and don&#039;t buy into shit just because you have friends that are. It would be hypocritical of me to tell you what you can and can&#039;t do, but just know the only mother fucker that is going to care enough about themselves to decide what goes in and out of your body is YOU.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had 1 friend die on Father&#039;s Day from a xanax + methadone cocktail<br /><br />One of my best friends is across the US in Santa Cruz after going thru his third installment of rehab for benzo and opiate addiction<br /><br />I&#039;ve got another friend who recently was not there for his first child&#039;s birth because he was trying to set up a deal to buy more xanax<br /><br />Be very careful with drugs that scramble up your brain chemistry; especially when your brain is still developing. Abstaining is bullshit, moderation is key. Good luck, be safe and have fun. <br /><br /><br />

				WOW!!<br /><br />Why in the world would you mix different pills with weed, alcohol, and such!!<br />Have you never heard of serotonin syndrome, etc.<br /><br />Just take your damn pills separately and smoke your weed later...

				Benzo&#039;s can take ahold of you, I don&#039;t use them generally but I was taking .5 mg to 1mg a day for about a month than I ran out of Xanax. After two days I couldn&#039;t sleep and had tons of withdraw symptoms.<br /><br />I started taking .25 of xanax at night after that to help me sleep, than one day I snorted about 20mg of 2-cb and had no issues sleeping or any more withdraw symptoms from xanax. Not sure if it was from the 2c-b or the reduction in xanax use. <br /><br />However, tread carefully when dealing with benzos.

				you sound a lot like my own dumbass friends who will smoke anything in a blunt. <br /><br />it doesn&#039;t matter how many times i tell them not to smoke drugs, i still keep hearing stories.&nbsp; my friend once told me about crushing up adderall to smoke in a blunt and he &quot;thought he was gonna have a heart attack.&quot;&nbsp; i wondered if that was all in his head because i figured the amphetamine would be destroyed in combustion, but he seemed pretty sure that it fucked him up.&nbsp; then i heard about them crushing up ecstasy in a blunt...lol.&nbsp; that one &quot;was a waste&quot; according to them.&nbsp; also a blunt dipped in liquid ketamine.<br /><br />i mean, WTF?&nbsp; there&#039;s a reason this stuff isn&#039;t common practice.&nbsp; pills are for eating, K is for snorting (or injecting if thats ur thing), and dried plant matter is the only thing you should smoke.&nbsp; whats so hard about swallowing a pill that makes people want to crush it up and smoke it?<br /><br />as to your original question, you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; just don&#039;t do stupid shit like that any more, please.&nbsp; and forward that message along to my friends when you hang out with them next.

				I don&#039;t get it. Why not just pop the xan?<br /><br />You prolly got a such a small amount of xan by smoking it (if any), the tiny feeling was just overpowered by the weed. Especially considering a half mil of xan (the peach ones, never seen pink) split between a few guys is pretty weak when it&#039;s NOT smoked. <br /><br />With that said, with the exception of what&#039;s in the smoke from that pill, smoking weed and popping xan (not smoking it!) is quite enjoyable, and carries no more risk than taking the xan by itself. It tends to make me pretty tired, but gets rid of any anxiety or paranoia caused by the weed. <br /><br />The typical warnings about addiction and overdose apply here. You must respect benzo&#039;s, or they&#039;ll seriously mess with you. I was sick for almost a week once after a moderate 10-day benzo binge. It was hell, I&#039;d seriously not recommend it.
