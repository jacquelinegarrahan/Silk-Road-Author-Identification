				I love MDMA, and I love shrooms even more, so naturally I&#039;m pretty interested in trying the hippy flip. But I&#039;m wondering if doing this will make my shroom trips from then on feel underwhelming, or like something is missing? That would be horrible&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Nope. Not in my experience at least. MDMA/Psychs are an outstanding combo, but by themselves are completely cool as well.

				MDMA is one trip. Mushrooms is another trip. Hippy flipping is yet another trip. They all have their own cool quality and differ from each other.<br /><br />I personally feel that MDMA by itself is not nearly as awesome as hippy flipping.. to the point where I won&#039;t usually do rolls without the mushies.. since you only get (apparently) a limited number of truly excellent rolls in one lifetime&#039;s worth of brain cells.

				That combo is great and powerful.<br /><br />IF you want to take away from the shroom alone feeling, do a night full of nitrous and shrooms. Trippin will never be the same.

				The first time I took shrooms was in a hippy flip, but they are definitely still fun on their own.&nbsp; Go for it! :)

				Nah, like philter3 said it&#039;s just a completely different trip, not a necessarily &quot;better&quot; one. The euphoria actually overwhelmed me and my philosophizing went from the stoic to the delirious. I enjoyed myself more and my sense of marvel increased, but I sacrificed some of the epiphanic quality of psilocin. It&#039;s a tradeoff!

				Thanks for the input everyone. I think I&#039;ll try this one day but the vendor I was planning to purchase MDMA from ran out. Probably for the best really, will wait for a special occasion like a festival or something
