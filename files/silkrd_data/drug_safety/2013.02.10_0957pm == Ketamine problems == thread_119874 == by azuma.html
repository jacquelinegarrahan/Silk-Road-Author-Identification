				ketamine didnt really do much for me. All it really did was make it very difficult to stand and walk like i was drunk but there wasnt much of if any of a mental high. Probably snorted .5grams to .75 grams (no scale) in 4 lines. Which to me doesnt make sense because i read that for someone 200 lbs it should be .200 grams&nbsp; but idk maybe i read it wrong. I did proably wait an hour just to make sure but i just went to bed<br />Not sure if this makes a diff but earlier i went out on 2mg clonazepam and had a few drinks just enough for a solid buzz.<br />Also some more info on the product i won 1.5 ketamine in a lottery seemed like a sketchy delivery ( weird wait times) and it came in more of a powder form with some crystals as opposed to his picture which was purely crystals.<br />Just thought i vent to you guys for some sage advice on what i did wrong

				If you are saying you sniffed between half and 3/4 gram of ketamine, and it only made you stumble about a bit, then you had shit ketamine.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

I had ordered 0.25 gm Ket and snorted maybe 2 X 1 cm &quot;lines&quot;, which fucked me up quite well. It lasted for three trips, if that is the right word. If you want some good ketamine, MarajuanaIsMyMuse has good stuff - have ordered it a few times, was good each time.
