				I have been railing stimulants, primarily meth, off and on for many a year. I usually keep my distance from opiates just because it is so easy to get sucked into addiction with them.&nbsp; Lately however I have been taking a few bumps here and there of crushed up oxycodone my gf always has on hand.&nbsp; Here is my question:&nbsp; When I bump this oxycodone it gives me cold-hand-cramps and cold-foot-cramps.&nbsp; Sometimes meth does that to me but opiates have never ever had that affect.&nbsp; It makes me wonder if it is unrelated to the Oxy or if maybe I have some kind of circulation problem?!&nbsp; It happens like within 5 minutes of bumping this shit and it happens everytime so I know there is a direct correlation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Opiate sniffers please advise me,&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; Am I somehow fucked up?&nbsp; Could it be fucked up Oxy?&nbsp;

				I dont want to scare you, but sounds like it could be a circulation problem or some other possible health issue. Ive never had that happen to me and I sniff oxy all the time. <br /><br />Could be something simple like dehydration? Maybe you&#039;re allergic to morphine? Hard to say bro. Talk to a dr. Good luck.<br /><br />

				Good point, allergies.&nbsp; Could be an allergic reaction.&nbsp; Other than that everyone seems to agree here that is totally backwards.&nbsp; Lots of people get cold feet and or tingles with snorting meth and coke but NOT opiates.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be I am allergic to oxy or something.&nbsp; Thats o.k., another good reason for me to stay away from it.&nbsp; Not to bad mouth opiates its just that they seem to be the only drung that I have seen people really lose control of.&nbsp; I mean I have know lots of people become code addicts but they always pull out of it.&nbsp; The peeps I know that get into opiates usally never quit.&nbsp; I gues.... make any sense at all!?&nbsp; :)&nbsp; ahhh wtf party on. ;)

				Well if it makes you happy then yes. Anyone should be able to do whatever they want. And high quality heroin is pretty safe and non harmful. addicting as fuck but if you can spare that money to keep up with your habit then bravo to you haha.<br /><br />Also if you ever go through heroin wd&#039;s you&#039;ll understand that you will need to do anything to find or get cash for a sack lol.<br /><br />Life of a junkie is really interesting and I&#039;m glad I&#039;m doing what i&#039;m doing haha ;) Moderation is the key of life. Get that into your habit and then everything will flow much smoother with no stress :)<br /><br />But alcohol is just as bad as IVing heroin IMO and just as addicting imo. But the guys snorting oxys, idk what is wrong with ya. Maybe a circ. problem but it doesn&#039;t seem like it.<br /><br />Look online and see if anyone else has had this experience.

				Oxycodone lowers blood pressure, so if you already have low blood pressure, or poor circulation, then taking oxycodone will exaggerate this effect, which is why your extremities feel cold. Low blood pressure can be pretty serious, as it increases your risk of overdosing. I&#039;m not saying that sniffing a pill here and there is going to make you OD, just that you&#039;re at higher risk for it.<br /><br />I&#039;d go get a blood pressure test at a pharmacy, and if it&#039;s seriously low, make a doctor&#039;s appointment, or at least be careful when doing opiates or sedatives.

				opiates lower your body temperature, so its like a &quot;reverse-fever&quot; warmth (where with a fever, you have &quot;chills&quot;)<br /><br />but if you get numbness and cold, then you are experiencing serious circulation problems. <br /><br />do some fucking exercise already!
