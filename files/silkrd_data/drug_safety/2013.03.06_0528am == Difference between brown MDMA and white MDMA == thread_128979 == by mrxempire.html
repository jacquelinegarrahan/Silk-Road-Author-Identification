				hello my fellow druglords, I have an inquiry for you. What is the difference between brown and white MDMA? I&#039;ve heard that white is better, but i&#039;m not sure.<br />Last summer, before I knew how to use SR, someone in my town ordered a bunch of MDMA from here for us fellow concert and rave goers. They were white crystals, and they were unreal. I&#039;ve never rolled so hard in my life. You only needed .1. to roll dick. Since then I haven&#039;t been able to find MDMA that good, even though this person got their stuff from here. The 40 a gram stuff on here seems to be all brown MDMA. Do you need to pay extra to get the good, white MDMA? Or are both types the same?

				Depends on the synth method. White is the most filtered and pure from what I have heard, and I believe that you can wash your colored MDMA in your kitchen without too much work.

				Brown mdma otherwise known as moonrocks is the cheap stuff from the netherlands thats around the 80% purity mark. <br />White MDMA has been washed in some cases 3 times with an anhydrate acetone removing impurities and the result is the white mdma with around 90+% Purity. Smoother high and comedown.<br />The brown stuff can be a little edgy sometimes especially in higher doses. Hope this helps somewhat.

				Yeah so there is no difference.<br /><br />I get where the other folks are coming from in that properly synthesized and washed MDMA is going to be white but just because it&#039;s white does not mean that the stuff has been properly synthesized, washed or provide any indication of purity.<br /><br />You can cut, or not wash, MDMA to leave any number of things in there. Just because it&#039;s white does not mean it hasn&#039;t been cut with lots of white stuff. People, go back and forth on it but brown / tan became popular when all the RC&#039;s started hitting so having slightly unwashed MDMA that still smelled and was colored by the sassafras oil was actually more a sign of purity than being handed a bag of clear white rocks.<br /><br />Purity is nearly impossible for us novices to determine but suffice to say that the purity differential between tan / brown MDMA and ultra washed super clean pure white MDMA is trivial. From a speculative standpoint it it might mean the difference between taking 100mg vs. 110mg. <br /><br />Rather than worrying about color your best bet is to always go based on trip reports of people that have taken it. While supplies change from batch to batch if someone is selling good MDMA they will tend to develop a reputation for it regardless of color. <br /><br />In my buying process I don&#039;t even look at the color to decide what to buy. I read through the forums and look for doses and experiences that seem consistent and predictable based on my usage experiences.<br /><br />Hope that helps. Not disagreeing with the above, just pointing out that there is MUCH more to it.

It can, if you are willing to deal with the complexity of doing so and the corresponding loss of product that accompanies it. I would MUCH rather buy pure clean washed MDMA than tan/brown stuff. <br /><br />What I am saying is that THE COLOR of the MDMA has nothing to do with the PURITY of the MDMA. White is not more pure than tan or brown.<br /><br />I can cut white MDMA with lots of other white things and have 10% MDMA that looks like giant crystal moon rocks vs. 80-90% pure MDMA-HCL in unwashed brown / tan crystals. The color can indicate impurity but can not be taken as a measure of purity. To test this theory simply take a gram of table salt and wash it as many times as you like in any maner you like... no mater how clean you make that white crystal it still is not MDMA.<br /><br />Totally get where you are coming from, I would love to not eat by byproducts of a half assed syth but simply proclaiming that a white crystal advertised as MDMA is better than a brown / tan batch of actual MDMA doesn&#039;t make sense either if you think about it. In a perfect world we could choose from well washed pure MDMA vs. less washed and maybe cheaper tan / brown MDMA but right now there is a third choice, white MDMA of unknown purity that if people are told white is better folks might buy when for all you know it&#039;s cut with any dozen of other HCL or other compounds that would survive the wash you put it through equally well.

I&#039;ve seen some absolutely atrocious MDMA before, but I like to think there&#039;s fairly little difference in strength between the white and slightly off-white/tan stuff I buy.

				Based on what I&#039;ve seen most tan MDMA will not lose 30-40% of its weight when washed. Futura, who did you buy from? I&#039;ve ordered the brown MDMA from several STAR SR vendors myself and an excellent wash job will only reduce weight by ~10%. Your rocks must have been wet with sass
