				Hey everyone new to this site and am seriously looking forward to being a part of this badass community, free market capitalism for everyone!<br />Anyways I know candyflipping isn&#039;t anything new, but what do you guys think of putting an LSD microdot in an MDMA pill and pressing them together? I think it&#039;s been done before, but do you guys think it could be any good?

High levels of HCl and KCl = bad.<br /><br />IMO you would be wasting a significant proportion of the LSD.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Its a novel idea, don&#039;t get me wrong about that. But most people I know who candyflip like to take their acid around 1 - 2 hours before the MDMA so that they arnt tripping for the comedown from the MDMA and the peaks sync up.

Maybe if a pill could be pressed that had an LSD coating and time release MDMA. but that would be quite an effort, and I imagine that the final product would cost more than simply purchasing the same amounts of LSD or MDMA on their own.

Maybe setting the MDMA in a time release capsule and have the microdot in the front so its released first and put the mdma behind some cellulose barriers so it gets released after about 2 hours. i know pharmaceuticals have pills like that already but it would be very hard to get doses and proportions right and find manufacturers of the pill sets if i cant make them myself :(

				LSD infused wax coating around a gel capsule containing MDMA. Maybe I&#039;m just high.

				I think you would need to make time release MDMA granules (like the little beads in certain perscription pills). then you would have to press beans with that. And then, you would have to dip the bean in some type of LSD liquid suspension that drys into a hard coating (like what they make microdots with). all in all that would be a lot of work for something that has a limited customer base.<br /><br />But if anyone ever took the time to make something like that, I would HAVE TO TRY ONE.

				Taking a pill mixed with LSD would be pointless because LSD is only active orally when taken sublingually.<br /><br />Taking a pill mixed with lsd won&#039;t do anything...<br /><br />There have been rumors of mescaline based pills as long as ecstasy has been popular so maybe this is what your confusing candy flipping with.<br /><br />Usual when someone candyflips its dropping a pill or two and then placing a tab or two on the tongue :)<br /><br />Verrrryyy funnn :D

				^^My thoughts exactly^^ <br /><br />Although it is true that there is a lower bio-availability orally (due to first pass metabolism and what-not), you should still get an effect from the LSD.<br /><br />Unless the drug in question is actually an NBOMe, which is sadly becoming easier to find as &quot;acid&quot;.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				I thought that the first pass metabolism and the harsh/acidic environment of the stomach destroyed a certain amount of the LSD before it could reach the bloodstream. I could be wrong though. What sources did you get these figures from, if you don&#039;t mind me asking.
