				Hi SR, I&#039;m thinking of trying Methylone... I&#039;ve experimented with MDMA, Mephedrone, 2c-b, speed,cocaine, weed and benzos. Whats Methylone like? How long does it last? What&#039;s the best starting dose? What&#039;s the come-up like? What&#039;s the best way to take it? Any long comedown?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve also been curious, especially given it&#039;s price! <br />I get some advice from here, www.erowid.org , but it seems to be mixed reviews there. 50/50 on the love/hate scale. <br />I chimed in so I can follow the thread&nbsp; :P

				I don&#039;t know if this is the same but around here where im at, some dealers would sell mdma as methylone bunk pills so i would try a bunch of methylone pills. it isn&#039;t as intense as mdma and doesn&#039;t last as long, but it seems cleaner.

				I found where I&#039;m a bit lethargic a day or so after using molly, I had none of this after methylone. I did only use a sample amount, about 120mg.<br />The come up for me was a bit faster, and the rolls somehow felt different but I can see why it&#039;s used as a substitute!<br />

Doesn&#039;t bother me too much because I always try to make sure I have nothing important to be doing for a few days. If methylone is this similar to mdma, I wouldn&#039;t mind giving it a try ;D. I&#039;ve heard a few people say that its a shorter roll, would re-dosing be a waste of time? I know that with mdma, you can only re-dose once or twice before you&#039;re wasting your time.

				Not sure about the bump factor, I only had one hit! Just sampling!<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/methylone/methylone_effects.shtml - Read the description, they talk about the bump!

				Methylone is great. I love to mix it with a small dose of 2C-B. Other than a little teeth grinding, it has almost no comedown or after-effects. MDMA, for me, has just lost its magic and M1 is a great substitute. Also, it doesn&#039;t make my junk totally limp. I can bang like a superstar on M1 and 2C-B.

I use a bluetooth stereo headset so no one hears my bad habit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Methylone has an interesting effect on me.&nbsp; It puts a boulder over the anger portion of my brain, for an entire day after a night of abuse.&nbsp; I can hear people breath,&nbsp; I can hear subtle differences in someones voice.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />At the end of my experiments.&nbsp; I give Methylone a 3 out of 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;It sucks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that the Road is here, dont mess with Methylone get MDMA only.&nbsp; &nbsp;
