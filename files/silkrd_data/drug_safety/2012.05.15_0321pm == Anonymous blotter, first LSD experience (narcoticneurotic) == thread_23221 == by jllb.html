				I am just landing from my first LSD trip. I&#039;ve taken an Anonymous blotter at 11:00am. I can&#039;t find anymore the vendor, which was narcoticneurotic (if I remember well). <br /><br />Just to say that it has been a nice experience, quite spiritual, very sensorial. I think the blotter was not very strong, since I only had very mild visuals, sort of breathing ceilings. I&#039;ve been alone, at home, laughing a lot. Listening music was incredible. Also eating a banana, or feeling any skin contact was amazing. Insights like&nbsp; how absurd is to take oneself seriously were very vivid.<br />I had also a very mild headache, a kind of feeling of stress or overexcitement. The whole trip lasted about five hours, which also makes me think the dose was not very high.<br /><br />Well, this small report just in case may be of help to someone who is as scared as I was a few hours ago.<br />I&#039;ve been all my life interested in trying LSD, but is is so absurdly difficult, being illegal,&nbsp; that I had to wait until the discovery silkroad.<br /><br />Thanks to narcoticneurotic and to silkroad.

				Yes, I think it was the one.<br />Anyway, for a total scared newbie like me, it has been a nice experience.

				Glad you enjoyed it brother! GGW- New vendor, only 10/hit for a 5strip. He sent me a sample and sounds pretty trustable if you wanna give it a shot for next time.

				I also tried NN&#039;s Anonymous blotter a few days ago. It wasn&#039;t my best LSD experience, but I thought it was pretty good. It didn&#039;t differ appreciably from my past experiences with LSD, so I am not convinced that it is a research chemical, as other people have claimed. If it an RC, then it must affect me (at least) in the same way as genuine LSD. Of course, I have only been dropping acid regularly for the past five months, so my experience may be limited.
