				Anyone have any experience with this. I&#039;ve heard some stuff about rapid bone growth and jaw stretching which I&#039;m not too sure I&#039;d want. Yet as it&#039;s produced in the human body I can&#039;t see why it would be too dangerous. <br />I&#039;m looking to use it for weight loss and supposedly it speeds up your metabolism.<br />Anyone used it or know anything more about it?

				If you exercise enough it will mainly just grow muscle. It will ruin your natural production though, that is why GHRP&#039;s and other newer peptides would be better.

				Mashman,<br /><br />GH is an amazing hormone, you WILL have fat loss like you have never seen before--even if you diet is not perfect. I&#039;d always recommend being to be as &quot;ON&quot; as possible with you diet to reap the best reward. You will also sleep like you did, if not better then--when you were 10 yrs old (sleep is amazingly deep). Your skin will look the best it has in years and you&#039;ll have amazing amounts of energy throughout. If you cycle with test, these two work well together, but the hormone alone will work as well. I have heard of these side effects you&#039;ve mentioned with bone growth, but these are most likely the results of extended periods of use at much higher dosages i.e bodybuilders/ power lifters. Also, at the higher administered (10+ IU) doses it would be much harder on the wallet (I&#039;ve high dose users at over 3k a month). Higher doses can help increase with overall mass, while a nice low dose will shed you up. I did fine when ramping up the dose from 1 IU to 2 , 3 then 4&nbsp; IU&#039;s max for 6 months plus and lost an amazing amount of body fat. Let us know your plans, and what you&#039;re trying to achieve.

				GH is expensive as fuck. I&#039;d rather roll with test.

				Agree ^^ but it was so worth it for the few times i tried it. I used it as a bridge between cycles, and that was great.

If your over 40 get it from an anti aging clinic.
