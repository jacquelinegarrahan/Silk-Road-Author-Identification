				Say I was ordering a bulk amount from China and it got marked for investigation.. I already know dogs aren&#039;t trained to smell it... but if the package was disguised and then opened, would customs have a way of testing to see if it was a 2C drug, besides of course taking it and tripping?<br /><br />

				Absolutely.<br /><br />Here is the entire list of them already tested out.<br />&lt;clearnet&gt; http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/521861-Differentiating-2cb-vs-2ci-others-%28reagents%29<br /><br />Best Regards, <br />Vanquish

				Hm, so would this decrease the chances of such an RC making it from China -&gt; USA?

				That&#039;s a valid point. With so many powders and other supplements coming out of China, they probably are only able to identify the most basic ones such as Weed, MDMA, etc

				Does anyone know the protocol they go through when customs finds a suspicious package?&nbsp; I&#039;d assume they walk dogs by it and some reagent test, or do they send it right away too a lab to get tested?&nbsp;
