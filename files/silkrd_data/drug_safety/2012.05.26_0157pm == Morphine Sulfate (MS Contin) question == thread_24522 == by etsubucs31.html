				When I ordered my 40mg oxy&#039;s, I got a 100mg morphine sulfate pill for free. I&#039;ve never tried one before. How would this dose compare to the 40mg oxy&#039;s? Also on another forum I read that eating the morphine pills is pretty much a waste (not sure why, something to do with its low b/a level). So should I snort it, or would it be effective enough to just break the time release and eat it? Thanks for any help!

				Assuming you mean 40mg time release oc swallowed? If so then you might wanna wait a bit til your tolerance grows. Or just break it in like 4 parts to sniff.<br /><br />Only you know your usual usage so just use a conversion chart found on any search engine. But for HR purposes Ill explain bioavailability or b/a. Bioavail. is referred to in percentage, and will usually list different&nbsp; percentages for different ROAs or routes of administration. These percentages mean xx%(the amount that will effect you) out of the entire dose (100%). The only way to get 100% is paternal (IV/&quot;shooting up&quot;)<br /><br />If you come across text that is not intended for recreational users, but for medical professionals then usually only the oral b/a will be listed. <br /><br />Just remember to always always always do your research before attempting anything that your the slightest bight unsure of. The internet is your best friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;Safety first, knowledge is power, so on and so fourth.

I crushed them both (the MS Contin was way easier to crush). I didn&#039;t really feel thirsty, but I did drink a lot of water on both because I felt it increased the buzz. No real side effects other than hard to use the bathroom. I think the MS Conin&#039;s are a little cheaper, so if I was going to do it again I would more than likely just get those.
