				I was gonna post this in the &quot;products being sold/test out market potential&quot; forum, but I ended up feeling this one would be more suitable for the audience + you have to have an actual listing to post over there.<br /><br />Given the fact this is a bit special AND that it would be a stepping stone for other vendors to offer a similar service, which would thus raise the overall quality of products vendors sold DRAMATICALLY...in my opinion.&nbsp; A little paranoia for someone who is cutting on their 2 year old account can be a powerful tool.&nbsp; <br /><br />This would also help keep people safe - and you can&#039;t argue against that.&nbsp; Maybe we&#039;d eventually quality would be enforced by services like these so well in the marketplace that we&#039;d have to rename SR to &quot;GlaxoSmithDread Pirate Roberts&quot;:P&nbsp; Sorry, I know I suck at trying to be funny.<br /><br />-----Towards the meat of this and more specifically towards me make sure you read below-------:<br /><br />I dont have access to the equipment at this time nor can I do this right now in case you message me - I&#039;d have to figure out some super clever logistics mail wise Too...as I can&#039;t have 100s of mini samples being sent to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m also not even saying I would start providing this service - but this is the first step.<br /><br />Consider this poll for me and/or anyone who may already have access to the equipmen necessary and potentially a solid shipping strategy for receiving substance samples and wants to offer the service (assuming you people care about what you&#039;re putting in your bodies) and want to get the most bang for your bitcoin from vendors.<br /><br />Personally, I would just message you back a report of the substances identified and (quite accurate) percentages.&nbsp; It can be in PGP or not.<br /><br />If I ended up doing this, fast turnaround and customer service would be my utmost priorities - as that&#039;s what keeps me coming back to the same vendor even despite cheaper prices elsewhere.&nbsp; I freakin hate it when I have to stress over a vendor not responding.<br /><br />I also wouldn&#039;t want to torture you for &quot;2 weeks&quot; or some crap like that.&nbsp; My goal would be within 1-3 days of receipt of sample - which I still don&#039;t know how would be done.&nbsp; The samples needed would be extremely small by the way - most likely fractions of a normal dose for you.&nbsp; Turnaround would be quick because...well...I&#039;d have to make a large upfront investment...which would be in a very convenient place for me :)<br /><br />The mass shipping of 100s of potental products if there was enough interest would I&#039;m sure have he type of people I don&#039;t want at my door extremely quickly.&nbsp; All they&#039;d have to do is sign on and order and analysis - so that part would take some intense thought....which may actually be why nooone offers it currently (correct me if I&#039;m wrong, I never actually searched for this service to be honest).
