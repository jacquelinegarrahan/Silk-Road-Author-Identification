				ive been wanting to take something that gives visuals while maintaining a &#039;clear&#039; headspace, my research lead me to 2c-b<br />i really want to try it but have no mates interested in trying an RC<br />in terms of psychs, ive only done lsd once and i took a xanax before, which seems to have offset lsds psychological effects and narrowed it down to a body high and some nice visuals<br />i was wondering if it would be &#039;safe&#039; and worth it to try it alone? would do it in a forest or park and was thinking of doing 15-20mg as a starting dose<br />any thoughts? thanks guys :)

				2c-b is a great psych to start with and 2c-i as well. I think you&#039;ll be fine but just in case keep some benzos on hand but the trip at the dose never gets too intense.

				I did 2c-b for the first time on my own, 25mg and it was lovely.. certainly not overwhelming, could happily have coped with more. unfortunately I fell asleep watching the pretty patterns about 5h in, a stimulant it ain&#039;t! Enjoy!

				yes - 2cb is very clear headed and youll probably be fine - however it is a full psychadelic and its never a good idea to take psychs by yourself - you really never know. i have seen rare situations where people loose there head on 2cb for a while - you dont wanna be by yourself if that happens

				I reckon it could be nice to journey with a friend, due to your experience with psychs. Always nice to have that reflection/grounding aspect around you :) Also, I dig the empathetic and entheogenic properties of 2c-b, and love having a fellow psychonaut with me to traverse the universe with!!<br /><br />If you decide to roll on by yourself, perhaps take a small amount first, say in the 8 - 15mg range. After a couple of hours, if you find you want to redose, try another 5mg, then perhaps another 5mg on top of that if you feel the need.<br /><br />Also, the method of consumption for 2c-b DRASTICALLY changes the onset of the trip, as well as its intensity, so keep this in mind if you think about redosing. If you&#039;re snorting it you can be dropped straight into the trip from anywhere between 5 - 15mins, and contains a nice level of consistent intensity throughout. Plugging it can be really nice but not something I have done often due to having to carry a syringe and having a f**king sensitive arsehole ::) For me, plugging has almost no body load every time and can be quite a bit stronger than other methods, and tends to come on rather quickly as well, around the 20 - 40min mark for me. As for swallowing 2c-b, I have only ever done this a few times, and it usually took a long time to come on (1.5 - 2 hours+). My preferred method is definitely snorting it as I usually take 2c-b at raves, and I can be guaranteed an approx time frame; from being mashed to coming off it.<br /><br />Have fun ;)

				Every drug, but especially psyches, treats everybody a little differently. I took 2c-b alone the first time at 25mgs and I had a blast, but some people are more sensitive to it than others. Shulgin himself took 2c-b before he went to a museum, but I&#039;d be careful about tripping in public. I would start low and definitely have a sober friend along if I was going to trip anywhere I might encounter other people, at least until you have a sense of what kind of headspace 2c-b puts you in. It comes down to knowing yourself and finding the right setting for you, though. We&#039;re just a bunch of weirdos on the internet, only you can say for sure what&#039;s right for you.

				Alright, first we should stop saying that the &quot;2c-x&#039;s&quot; are research chemicals because they&#039;re not. Sorry to bust your chops. But these 2c substances have been around much longer than most of us that use them. They were synthesized at least 4 decades ago (1974), They been around for about almost 40 years now and lots of research has been done on the 2c&#039;s. They are also now scheduled so they really aren&#039;t research Chemicals anymore. LSD was a research chemical at one point and so was MDMA.

				20mg on your own should be fine, but you should do lots of reading on the effects if you do that so that you don&#039;t get worried if the confusion sets in or something.

				The effect of 2C-B are fairly mild at that dose really, you&#039;d need to take TONS more to have any worries even without any psychedelic experience. I would advise you to have some ginger or something else to reduce nausea beforehand as I personally find there&#039;s a lot of body load with the 2C&#039;s.

				For me 2C-B is just MDMA with an awesome show for your eyes, minus the stinking comedown you get with MDMA. There is nowhere near the level of mind-rape that you get with LSD either and the visuals are totally different to LSD as well. They look more &#039;digital&#039; than LSD visuals but are just as enjoyable. I would say you should sniff it as well to really feel the effects but adjust your dose to about 10mg / 15mg and go from there. A lot of people disgree with snorting the 2C&#039;s but in my mind it is the more enjoyable experience when compared to eating it.

Sorry to bust your chops. But these 2c substances have been around much longer than most of us that use them. They were synthesized at least 4 decades ago (1974), They been around for about almost 40 years now and lots of research has been done on the 2c&#039;s. They are also now scheduled so they really aren&#039;t research Chemicals anymore. LSD was a research chemical at one point and so was MDMA.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have to agree with this, and 2c-x chemicals are also relatively safe from my understanding as well<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />2CB is pretty safe. I love it. PHIKAL has great info. I Did it alone, great yoga practice ensued. Highly erotic if you choose it. Some 2C&#039;s however can kill you if you OD. From what I have heard it&#039;s not pretty. Insulfating an oral size dose never a good idea until you know a chemical well and even then take care.

				Not all 2Cs are equal.&nbsp; Erowid lists 2C-I and 2C-E as research chemicals, but not 2C-B or 2C-C.
