				I am an avid user of psychedelics. It is hard for me to think of a drug that I have yet to try.<br /><br />I started using NBOME&#039;s about a two years because of the lack of LSD where I am situated. I was lucky to find some vendors selling NBOME&#039;s on a regular website (biggest mistake of my life, thankfully I&#039;m still here today and without any issues).<br /><br />So I had used nbomes on plenty of occasion, I was mainly using 25i but I had tried all of them. I had taken up to 5mg of 25i in one night without having any negative side effects.<br /><br />One day I was attending a rave and I decided I would take a 1000ug blotter of 25i... Everything was great, I was having a great time. The lights and everything was beautiful. This was some real potent 25i as all I needed was one blotter for the entire night. I can remember everything perfectly, I was really enjoying myself. It was near the end of the night and I had taken nothing else except 200mg of MDMA. Me and some friends went over to a stage to see Nero.<br /><br />This is when the issues started. I started getting this feeling in my head and eyes where both my eyes felt like they were getting pulled to the left and straight back. I had never felt this before, it wasn&#039;t the normal eye wiggles you get on mdma, it was something different. I almost had the feeling of just throwing myself to the ground cause it was a terrifying experience. The only way I could control it was cover my eyes and look straight down to the ground. I was like that for about 20-30 minutes and finally decided it was time to leave. It was the last set of the night so I head to my car. Every several minutes I would get the same feeling, it almost felt like I wanted to seize up. I had never had any issues with seizures in 26 years of my life.<br /><br />I continued to get this feeling for several hours till I was able to fall asleep.<br /><br />To this day I have yet to use nbomes, I will strictly use LSD but I really love 2c-i and thats what surprises me because I can take large doses of 2c-i and have never felt that way.<br /><br />Be careful with your drugs especially research chems.

				NBOMes cause severe vasoconstriction in some users, including me. Mixing the drug with an phenethylamine-type drug is just asking for problems. Some might be just ok doing so, but keep in mind that you&#039;ll have two drugs restricting fluid and blood flow then. Eyes have small veins and are very, very fucking sensitive to changes in the volume of veins. On my first NBOMe trip (The last one I&#039;ll possible ever do), my right eye was left with this odd ball feeling for a couple of days after. It felt like someone had showed a tooth pick into the eye. I had also experienced severe vasoconstriction on the trip (was cold and my feet were a bit swollen up) so I can&#039;t really think of a better explanation than that NBOMes can fuck up your eyes by restricting fluid exchange or something. <br /><br />

				Yeah, NBOMes are not something I plan on doing again. I had good times on them but looking back I can see now how dangerous they really are. It sickens me that because of the war on drugs something safe like LSD is outlawed and hard to find while children can easily and legally order dangerous research chems like these online.

				I used to resell the NBOME series (C mostly, a little bit of B in the mix) in my area. It was fun for the first few outings, but the hangovers became worse and worse - even worse than coming down off meth/MDMA/or a night of binge-drinking alcohol.<br /><br />After reading reports of kids taking too damn much in one sitting and getting in real medical danger, I gave up on the stuff and just destroyed the rest of my stash. All the blotters and all the solutions prepared for nasal dropping just set on fire. I told every person who bought from me the dangers of working with research chems, and there were reports of people taking too much and going to the hospital and/or dying because of it. I was not about to have some dumbass&#039; death on my hands because someone I sold to downright ignored my warnings or just didn&#039;t believe me or whatever. This shit is too potent and too goddamn cheap to be fucking with on heroic doses.<br /><br />Lucy all the way &lt;3

				Well, it looks like you exceeded a little bit :P<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t like 25i-NBOMe since it&#039;s mostly sold as LSD, and people gets really bad trips.<br /><br />I will stay on LSD and maybe some other RC&#039;s (wondering about 2c&#039;s and mxe) but I will avoid 25i-NBOMe.

				jokerman2000: the 25i blotter than gave you the trouble....had you already used other hits from the same sheet?&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if there was something different about that problem dose.<br /><br />I tried 25c and didn&#039;t like it but I was thinking about trying 25b and 25i.&nbsp; Everyone says 25i is so visual.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard good things about 25b but it is way less popular that 25c/25i and I&#039;m not sure if that because people like it less or if is just isn&#039;t as common from the manufacturers.

But the day after, god, it was horrid i felt a little feverish, pretty weak, not in a good mood at all and I cant yet say for sure that it was the nBome because it was correlated with me stopping amphetamines after 5 days of use (normal sleep and all but still). I did experience similar sickness after using on summer when I didn&#039;t have an AC and the day after at 32 Celsius was unbearable. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171736.msg1234597#msg1234597">Quote from: slirp on June 14, 2013, 12:20 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">jokerman2000: the 25i blotter than gave you the trouble....had you already used other hits from the same sheet?&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if there was something different about that problem dose.<br /><br />I tried 25c and didn&#039;t like it but I was thinking about trying 25b and 25i.&nbsp; Everyone says 25i is so visual.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard good things about 25b but it is way less popular that 25c/25i and I&#039;m not sure if that because people like it less or if is just isn&#039;t as common from the manufacturers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I did a bunch of nBomes Tyler&#039;s 25i and Nevita&#039;s 25c and I don&#039;t remember them being very different, the trips were actually different but because of the conditions and situation rather than the substance, I thought a couple of times that each substance had unique things but tried to pay attention to them in the next trip and found out that they are not unique..

				I tried 25-c recently at 900mics and I absolutely didnt enjoy it, neither did my trip buddy. Music sounded all wrong not even like music just this loud clash of noise. We both got overheated for no reason. Made me more stimulated then comfortable. Lasted exactly only 4 hours for both and had no cev&#039;s other then some simple open eye distortion.<br /><br />The spiritual aspect is just not there.25-c is shit. Never again. This is nothing like real lsd.
