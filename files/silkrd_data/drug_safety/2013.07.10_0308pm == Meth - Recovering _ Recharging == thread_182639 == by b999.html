				For moderate use (oral adminstration) - fairly mild but consistent over say a few days or a week - they drug loses it&#039;s effect and it&#039;s a bit meh for now - lots of stimulation but needing more and also dirupted sleep.<br /><br />Is there any way to speed up recovery like say boost dopamine level?&nbsp; Hoping around two days of solid rest should&nbsp; help.

				The only way is to get bet rest, eat healthy (veggies, fruits and lean proteins), and take multivitamins and other vitamins.

				cheers... downed some raw eggs before sleep, seems to have helped a lot.<br /><br />I&#039;m also going to stay right away from smoking or snorting... that really seems like an express ride to hell or brain damage later in life.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how much safer oral use is though.

				while you are probobly well off to use it orally you are still better off sticking to 3 times a month or less. its gonna fuck you up. its screwing me around doing it weekly and its just all the running around for the bitcoins.<br /><br />nothing worse than when it doesnt work as well anymore ey? and especially how &#039;shiny&#039; everything seemed/looked the first 10-15 times i did it - just cant see myself ever getting that special effect back<br /><br />with any ROA you are putting your neurochemistry under allot of stress.... the last thing you want is a solid down-regulation of your dopamine system

				You don&#039;t mention the amounts you&#039;re talking about, which honestly is what&#039;s going to determine your answers.&nbsp; I strongly recommend reading through at least the first couple of posts of this thread, it&#039;s exactly the sort of information you&#039;re looking for:&nbsp; Safe Methamphetamine Usage / Dosage -- http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0

				Thanks for the link... I wish I&#039;d known about it from day one, but thankfully I may be kind of in line with the suggestions there.&nbsp; E.g. I&#039;ve stuck with oral use, tried sniffing a small amount once or twice but I&#039;ll cut that right out.&nbsp; Never gone through more than a point in day which would be HUGE for me, generally a point would last two days (~50mg / day).&nbsp; I actually started with dexamphetamine pills, I think I started with one or two, maybe 6 in a day on a big day.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember going as high as 8 in that in that initial time, with that usage level maintained not exceeded for a month or more.&nbsp; Yeah it felt pretty amazing back then.<br /><br />So the most I&#039;ve probably done is around 50mgs / day (half a point) - orally.&nbsp; Recently I may have exceeded that a litle.&nbsp; Yeah I don&#039;t seem to get that initial euphoria as much though.&nbsp; But thankfully I didn&#039;t go straight in with stupid shit like smoking a point (100mgs) in an hour.<br /><br />I&#039;ll repost this on that forum too.<br /><br />The bit about taking years to recover is a worry.&nbsp; I hope that&#039;s an extreme example for bing snorters and smokers.<br /><br />The good news is I don&#039;t seem to get any or noticeable withdrawal, as in I can say yeah that&#039;s enough for the day and just leave it... It can be sitting right in front of me and I don&#039;t feel tempted, even the next day.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s a good sign, and / or that I&#039;m disciplined.<br /><br />Sounds like I may need to consider staying off it for 5 days..&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using it orally in small doses (sometimes with 100mgs or a point lasting a week) but it&#039;s really hard to dose correctly.&nbsp; I try to split out the powder in to say five lots and dose that way but it&#039;s very difficult to work out.<br /><br />Holy cow that post is very sobering though, I think after my last delivery I&#039;ll cut it out for a month or so and consider this sensitising thing.&nbsp; I hope I haven&#039;t pushed it too far as it is.&nbsp; In this case I used about a point I think (100mgs) in about 3 days, which is excessive for me.&nbsp; Daytime use only btw, I don&#039;t do all night binges, and not in heated rooms or crap like that.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping the fanatical health focus has helped too.<br /><br />I also feel a bit turned off it at the moment, definitely not any withdrawal, bit like seing a beer and not feelig tempted after a big night.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t take it now if it was offered to me a gold plate, I just have no desire for it at the moment.&nbsp; Slept like a log last night too after downing two raw eggs.
