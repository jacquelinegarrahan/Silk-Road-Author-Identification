				If any of you have been looking at this thread for the past couple weeks you will have seen I&#039;ve posted a couple threads concerning 2-cb, about solubility and comparison with MDMA. I&#039;m very excited to try this on saturday, but I don&#039;t think the erowid vault for this particular drug is that great (before you jump to conclusions I have done a lot of research, I just want first hand experiences).

				If it&#039;s quality 2C-B, 25mg of either the HBr or HCl salt will have you tripping pretty hard. It&#039;s a pretty clear-minded trip with a positive and giggly push to it.

				25mg is a lot for a starter dose. If you&#039;re new to psychedellics, I&#039;d say start with 10-15mg. <br /><br />I tried 2c-b the other week, only 5mg and it didn&#039;t feel anything like mdma. I had these crazy visuals and the CEV&#039;s ended up making me anxious and even scared. The kicker is, the hallucinations aren&#039;t even supposed to kick in until the higher doses (25-30mg). <br /><br />I seem to be an exception but if you check erowid&#039;s effects fault, you&#039;ll find that my experiences are listed in the neutral and negative lists even though not many experience it the way I did. <br /><br />Just be careful, approach with caution. Most people are really happy at 15mg. And a lot of people trip hard at 25mg (unless you&#039;re a big person and even then ... it could have you tripping harder than you want for your first time).

				I&#039;m not new to psychedelics, I forgot to add that sorry :) but my friends who are doing it with me are, so maybe I&#039;ll advise them of the fact that 25mg is a little heavy - thank you. I&#039;m quite happy to be tripping hard and I&#039;ve heard 2-cb is quite forgiving so

				@yovvit, I took 26mg. I&#039;ve taken a large portion of the 2C class, and so I was really rather surprised that the effects were so mild. I&#039;m considering that the batch may have been contaminated (despite being from a very trusted vendor), but it also may be that 2c-b just isn&#039;t as visual as the others...

				Yeah, 2C-B is not comparable to MDMA. My experience wasn&#039;t, anyway. I dropped 20mg at about 8PM one night, and it took a long time to kick in, but once it did I was in outer fucking space, man. I found a friend online to talk to and afterwards I felt a very strong bond to him. Don&#039;t know if it was the conversation or the drugs, but it was a really emotional night. The major effects lasted from about 12AM until 7AM. I&#039;d start with 20mg, and do NOT redose in the same night, because you are going to want to do so really really badly, but fight it.

				I learned the other day that snorting 2-cb hurts sooo bad, it felt like I snorted a line of fire ants. I flushed the nostril with with water but it kept hurting for a good 20 minutes. I thought I read somewhere on here you could snort it but maybe I was thinking of some other drug. 2-cb usually takes like an hour and half to kick in when I do an oral dose but snorting it was almost instant, I would have enjoyed it more if the right side of my face wasn&#039;t on fire. Oh well, live and learn I guess.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />

				Seriously... try 2C-B rectaly. Its way better. Its hard to desribe how the effects are different, but it almost elliminates body-load and what I can only call &quot;metal-mouth&quot; (that weird taste in yer mouth while tripping). Then the positive side effects are a little different too. Feels really good, feels kinda like ecstasy to me.<br />Try a 10-12MG dose rectaly next time. You&#039;ll never take it oraly again. Trust.

You can ask for them at the pharmacy. Dip the end in a<br />little vasoline. You don&#039;t have to spread eagle on the floor, just turn over on yer side and push the syringe in about 2 knuckle lengths and inject. Make sure yer bowls are clear first of course. <br />You will not regret trying 2C-B this way. People who take it oraly are really missing out in my opinion.

				i&#039;m not gonna aim this at anyone in particular but just say it as a threadwide thing - anyone who says 25mg is mild is either not on the 2-cb i had or is just undersensitive beyond belief. <br />After 30 minutes and 1 joint I was beyond cloud 9, if anyone has ever seen the music video to Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, imagine experiencing that.. I could see eyes on every vertex of every object in my vision, but it didn&#039;t scare me it was just kinda cool. All of my friends looked fucked up, as in one of their eyes was moving and enlarging, and the trees in the distance were swaying in time with the music. And fuck me - was the music awesome, it felt like an endless mix of pure bliss and it affected my visuals in an indescribable manner, I couldn&#039;t even hear songs change. It was really bright and colourful, the sky kept changing colour, most of the things I looked at had a red/blue stereoscopic outline and I was super disorientated but it was still an awesome trip.<br /><br />The largest fucking coincidence in the world put some dark edges on my trip towards the end though, we were chilling at the bottom of my friend&#039;s garden and his grandma came and gave us some talk to frank leaflets so we&#039;re &#039;in the know&#039; about drugs. I don&#039;t even think she knew we were on 2-cb, but she looked at me and jokily asked &#039;are you on drugs?&#039; The irony is as she asked that she grew snakes out of her head each of which had eyes on the end rather than snake heads.. Things just got a little scary after that, luckily I was just about to come down.<br /><br />It was way stronger than when I took 150ug of LSD. I&#039;d definitely do it again, maybe not as much as it was overwhelming, almost.

I did not notice any differences, but I only get major visuals on big doses (23+ mg). If I dose lower than that the effects are mainly physical with some visuals. 2C-B is quite an interesting compound because you can almost control the OEV&#039;s.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see if someone else can compare Ivory&#039;s product with another batch of 2C-B.

				Prawl42, it depends what you&#039;re searching for. If you want a fun time where you&#039;re still able to do normal things without being highly affected (ie in a party environment) take between 10mg and 20mg and you should be fine. If you take 25mg, like I did, I can certainly say that it would not be suitable for the same environment as MDMA would be, I wouldn&#039;t have liked to be around others tripping as their faces would scare me and they&#039;d be loud and annoying etc. If you wanna trip hard, take 25mg - 30mg and chill outside for a good 3-4 hours.
