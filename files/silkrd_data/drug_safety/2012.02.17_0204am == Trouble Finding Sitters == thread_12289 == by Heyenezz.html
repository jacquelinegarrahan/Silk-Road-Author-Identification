				I want to trip on some long-lasting psychedelics such as shrooms but lack friends with available time.<br /><br />I have Asperger&#039;s and so don&#039;t make friends easily. The ones I have are too busy at the wrong times.<br /><br />How would you solve my dilemma?<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				I had my first encounter with psychedelics a week ago. (150ug of LSD). Then my second about 4 days after that (300ug). I had no trip sitter both times and I preferred it that way. If you do them in the right mindset and just go with it you should probably be fine.

If your looking for some insight into psychedelics. You may want to take a look at my trip log.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12204.0

				I understand that a sober sitter isn&#039;t necessary, but I would advise it for a first-timer. At least take the trip with a somewhat experienced tripper. While I agree that a good mindset is the biggest key, I find that having somebody else there put me alot more at ease my first couple of times. A trip can turn bad quickly, and go completely off the rails if somebody isn&#039;t there to get you back on track.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t know how his mental condition may effect any of this.
