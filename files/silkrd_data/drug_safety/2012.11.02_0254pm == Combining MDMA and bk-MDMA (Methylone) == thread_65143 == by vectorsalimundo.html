				Just wondering if anyone has ever done this or can say whether or not this combination should be tried or avoided. I have never done methylone on its own and some people I know that have tried it liked it and others did not. Alexander Shulgin has said that bk-MDMA has the same potency of MDMA but is missing the magic. I had one friend claim it wasn&#039;t just missing the magic, but missing the entire magician. Now I am not going to try the methylone in its own anyways but am wondering since I have some real MDMA if throwing some methylone in the mix might make for a fun trip or if I will end up bringing down the MDMA high with the bk-MDMA. Any thoughts?

				How about you try bk-MDMA on its own (yes I can read, you don&#039;t want to). How can you know a drugs character without trying it in isolation of other drugs? Yes you&#039;ll have to wait and skip an awesome MDMA experience, but there is no need to rush things you have plenty of time.

				personally ive done m1 by its self with weed and its really fun to adventure on. i believe it would be a magic combo, but i feel like it would be like eating a green apple and a red apple. it would be putting togethher two of the same. But that might just be an un educated view. :D
