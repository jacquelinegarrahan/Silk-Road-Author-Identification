				No one in my local area cooks Bath Salts so I want to expand my selection of things I sell, but I need a recipe in order to cook it up. Does anyone know the ingredients and the method for cooking Bath Salts?

				&quot;Bath salts&quot; are not a drug. Several RC&#039;s are sold under the name &quot;bath salts&quot; so they can be sold &quot;legally&quot; in headshops, gas stations, etc. Just like how some other drugs are sold as &quot;herbal incense&quot; or &quot;room deodorizer&quot;. <br /><br /><br />The fact that you didn&#039;t know this is a good indication that you have no business trying to manufacture or sell any of the drugs labeled as &quot;bath salts&quot;.

				<br />Too many chemicals are known as bath salts originally&nbsp; MCAT was sold as plant food and then&nbsp; bath salts now other substances fall under this umbrella , if your not a chemist leave well alone be responsible your end up killing someone

				I think I can help. <br /><br />You need two parts H20 to 1 part NaCL.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bring water to 80 degrees c.&nbsp; Slowly mix NaCL into warm water.&nbsp; Add whatever scented oils you choose.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:&nbsp; Must mix solution in a bathtub by submerging your body in the water and splashing around.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, for the final touch, you need a hair dryer.&nbsp; Plug in hair dryer.&nbsp; While in the bathtub, take plugged in hair dryer and QUICKLY submerge in water.&nbsp; Wait for results.<br /><br />Good luck and have fun!

				First you will need bath and then some salt. a lot of salt. Take the bath and put it carefully in the salt, once this is done jump out the nearest window.

				Research some of the following chems and if one of them interests you, go get a master&#039;s in chemistry and then go ahead and synth it. (Seriously, don&#039;t synth anything unless you are proficient in labwork - you could kill yourself.)<br /><br />MDPV<br />Mephedrone<br />Methylone<br />Butylone<br />Ethylone<br />Pentylone<br />4-MEC<br />4-EMC<br />3-FMC<br />a-PVP<br />MDPPP<br />a-PPP<br />Pentedrone<br />Ethlyphenidate<br /><br />(Those are just the ones I know they were putting in these RC stim blends, there were probably three times as many ones of which I don&#039;t know.)
