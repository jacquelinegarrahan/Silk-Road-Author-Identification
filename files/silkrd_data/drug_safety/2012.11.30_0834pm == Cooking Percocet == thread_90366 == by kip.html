				A while ago I was on here and it was suggested that I take percocet, dissolve it, freeze it to settle, strain dust, cook to evaporate and take the remaining tarred oil freeze that and eat it. The objective was to remove the Tylenol for your liver. I tried it twice.<br /><br />-I dissoved in water. Froze for 10 minutes. Filtered through a paper towel and discarded the dust. Took the liquid and poured into a pyrex and cooked until the water evaporated. I was left with a power however. No tar/oil. Any thoughts on this???

				Good lord. Just crush the pills into a fine powder. Take a cup of water and put it in the freezer until it is really cold, but not frozen. Take a coffee filter, wet it, and squeeze it out, and rubber band it to the top of another cup, with the middle of it pushed in into the cup to form a reservoir. Take your crushed up pills and throw them in the cup of ice cold water and stir, throw back in the freezer for a bit, don&#039;t let it freeze, now pour it into your pre-soaked filter, and set it in the fridge. Once it has all dripped into the cup you should be left with a filter full of nasty APAP, you can save this, and do another wash or chuck it, and a nice disgusting tasting glass of oxy juice, chugalug your oxy juice. Maybe mix in a packet of koolaid or something.
