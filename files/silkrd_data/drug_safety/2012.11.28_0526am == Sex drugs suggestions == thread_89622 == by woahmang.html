				The past few months have been really good, we&#039;ve had a night of massage and cuddles due to some top notch MDMA, had honest conversation and sleazy sex due to excellent coke and a hard-as-a-rock wetter-than-a-quagmire booze/viagra mix all thanks to the Road.<br /><br />Now if I don&#039;t come up with a good idea for date night we&#039;ll fall back into that rut of going for a meal or to the pictures or to a bar or something.&nbsp; Fuck that, I&#039;m looking for an intimate, unique, non-hallucinogenic experience (not her bag), preferably with a strong sexual component. <br /><br />Been considering getting some GHB in as a night of filth with no inhibitions sounds superb, but not sure if the stigma attached to it would put her off. Would anyone recommend that, and if not, what&#039;s the best drugs you&#039;ve taken with a lady (or gent) on a special night in?

				Light dose of 2c-b shouldn&#039;t be very hallucinogenic 8-12 MG /shrug <br /><br />Also from everything I read around here people seem to love meth +sex&nbsp; but there is a stigma to meth so who knows

				Meth isn&#039;t necessarily the best sex drug, you can just fuck forever.. honestly gets boring haha and apparently it&#039;s really hard for guys to come.<br />It&#039;s unfortunate she doesn&#039;t like hallucinogens because the best drug sex is LSD sex imho.<br />Just so much more sensual and romantic, not &quot;sleazy&quot; kind of fuck fest sex really slow and sexy... mmm.

				I would go with around 6mg of 5-MeO-MiPT, it&#039;s just enough to get you rolling and in an excellent headspace but not enough to give any visuals other than slight tracers and deeper colors. You&#039;ll be worshiping every inch of her for at least two hours and have virtually no refractory period throughout it which means not only will you be able to reach orgasm but you&#039;ll be able to many many times in a row. She&#039;ll just be a sopping mess of ecstasy if she&#039;s anything like my girl, especially with music in the background. ;)

I find it&#039;s less of an impulse of the drug (meth/coke/mdma just flat out make me horny) and more a bi-product of the experience. Just the feeling of closeness and togetherness meeting that warm sensual body sensation. Less about the act and more about the love behind it is what I guess I&#039;m trying to say.<br /><br />And as a side note: Yeah, meth always makes things kinky as all hell. I&#039;ve done things I never would have imagined while high on stimulants and enjoyed it thoroughly. Like, scare the shit out of your neighbors at 3 am kind of kinky.

				Okay you meth heads have talked me into it, I guess we&#039;ll have to give it a shot even if we can&#039;t tell our friends because we&#039;ll get ostracised for doing it. <br /><br />Thanks for all the suggestions, and keep them coming ;)

				I suggest silly doses of MDMA, like 300mg or so - I had the best sex of my life on two red defqons.<br /><br />Although, I don&#039;t really suggest it - high doses can be damaging, but if you&#039;re only going to do it once, why the hell not!?

				LSD is by far the best drug for sex, in my opinion. If you don&#039;t want to hallucinate take less than 100 mcg and it will still greatly enhance and prolong sexual pleasure.<br /><br />Pot brownies are also good.
