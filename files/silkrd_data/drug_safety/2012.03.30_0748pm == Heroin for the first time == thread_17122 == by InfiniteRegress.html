				I just did heroin for the first time last night. Technically, it wasn&#039;t the first time, because about 12 years ago I did a small line, but it has been so long that I don&#039;t even remember how it felt. So, as far as my body is concerned, yesterday was the first time.<br /><br />First, I should mention that I took a 50 mg tramadol about an hour or so before my package arrived. I got a .2 sample of tar from PJ, and was already prepared for it. I initially thought that about a quarter of it would be a good dose, but I decided to just do a little match head size to be safe, and I am definitely glad I did. I mixed it with a little water, put it in one of those syringes you use to give a baby medicine, layed on my bed with my head hanging off and squirted it up my nose. And holy fuck! In about 2 minutes, I felt a nice surge of happiness. Pretty much just like oxy, but different in a way that is difficult to explain. Soon after this, I started to feel a little nauseous, and thought I might throw up. I layed on my bed and that feeling went away. For the next hour or so, i drifted in and out of sleep and just felt pretty damn great in general. <br /><br />The nausea came back, so I decided to make some dinner because I thought that would help. It didn&#039;t. I had two beers with my dinner, which was also probably a big mistake. It had been four hours since the initial dose, and I could still feel it, but I thought that it was beginning to fade, so I decided to dose again. I did about half as much as I did the first time, since it hit me so hard before. I got a nice little rush again, but the nausea was much worse this time. I went outside to let my dog out and smoke, and I started getting chills. I came back inside and went to the bathroom thinking that was going to throw up, but it went away. Any activity I did that required motion made me feel sick. Once I layed down to go to sleep, I felt fine.<br /><br />The weird thing is that I still felt high for hours. I just kept drifting in and out of sleep, but whenever I woke up, I still felt high. This probably lasted for about 7 hours. That seems like way longer that it should, though. Is this normal if you don&#039;t have much of a tolerance (I only do opiates occasionally)?<br /><br />Today I did an even smaller amount, and felt it, but had no nausea at all. It only lasted about an hour and a half, though. It seems really difficult to get just the right amount to feel good, without the nausea.<br /><br />Anyway, that was my experience. I just felt like typing it out. Hopefully this is the right section of the forums to put this in.

				Hey man. First of all, I&#039;d like to congratulate you on being very careful with your research. Seeing how it was your first time, you did everything correctly. Except i think to make a big meal and eat while still being high. I always he stories of people being high/drunk and going to sleep or being unconscious and puking and suffocating on their vomit. So be easy with the food and opiates. If you want to be safe and are worried about puking, the best thing to do would be to stay away from food while researching.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been getting street H for a couple of years now and i&#039;m on methadone now. I do plan on getting some #3 or #4 in the near future and even though i did graduate to IV, I&#039;m going to take into consideration that what i&#039;ll be getting will be much more clean/uncut/potent. So i&#039;m going to snort it also. I&#039;ll probably do a bit more than a match head/tip for the first dose, i&#039;ll also do a little and see how it goes. Today i took my normal dose in the morning (70mg), and then about two hours ago, a friend of mine gave me (200mg) something he&#039;s been meaning to give me. little by little i drank it all. so in total, i had 270mg of methadone. In the past, if i want to get noddy, i usually do around that amouth. 200-280mg. Depends if i have benzos in my system or not. If i took benzos the day of or the day before, i try to be more careful with dosing and take less. But i&#039;m hoping to hear how it goes the next time you do it and don&#039;t get nauseous. Remember, the day of, eat a light breakfest if you&#039;re going to do it in the early afternoon. if you&#039;re going to do it like 30mins after waking up, i&#039;d suggest not eating anything, or maybe a toast or 2 if you must. The worst thing that can happen while you&#039;re feeling good and nodding is puking. and puking on yourself if the last thing you want to do, lol.
