				I&#039;ve never taken 5-htp at the same time as MDMA, but here&#039;s my tale.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken MDMA 4 times now and it has become one of my favorite drugs. I&#039;ve taken 5-htp after coming down before, but never before or along with MDMA. The last time I rolled however, I had just finished taking 5-htp for about a week and stopped all together about 3-4 days before I was planning to roll, figuring this was enough time for the 5-HTP to be out of my system.<br /><br />At first everything seemed normal, but the buildup just kept coming. Everything started sounding robotic. I had a terrible time and then in a flash I was coming down. It was like my entire roll was packaged into a short superpowered roll. It was so strong actually, that it made me throw up and I thought I was going to die. Luckily my brother was there and helped me through it and kept me hydrated and whatnot.<br /><br />I know it was MDMA because what I took was the other half of the pill I had rolled on the previous time. And from what I&#039;ve been reading it seems like that&#039;s what preloading with 5-htp does for some people. It scared the shit out of me and I haven&#039;t rolled or taken 5-HTP since.<br /><br />I am thinking about rolling again soon, but wanted to ask and see what kind of feedback I get here on this. I never want to have an experience like last time again. It&#039;s been about a month and a half since I had this happen. Is there anything I should worry about or should I maybe stay away from MDMA for a bit longer?<br /><br />I normally only take MDMA once a month if even that. No redosing or large doses. All my doses so far have been about 100-150mg. Trying not to overdo it on my body or brain, but last time just scared the shit out of me.

				It&#039;s fairly common to feel sick or throw up when coming up hard.<br />What I&#039;m guessing happened is that you came up very hard and panicked and went dizzy... This is normal for higher doses of MDMA and it can be scary for a few seconds.<br />Then because you panicked it put you in a bad mood and your mood has a lot to do with your MDMA experience.<br /><br />The 5-HTP probably just made the MDMA even stronger and therefore the comeup was stronger which might be what caused this.<br />MDMA is more unpredictable than other drugs such as weed or amphetamine. The effects vary greatly each time you use it.

				imo 100-150 of mdma once a month isnt that dangerous ,<br />sometimes I&#039;d wait even for 2-3 months to get the serotonin tanks really full<br />i&#039;ve taken 25i together with 100 mdma and i&#039;ve had no problems.<br />to get serotonin syndrome you have to overdo it quiet a lot<br />i&#039;ve had bad mdma trips too .. mainly because i&#039;ve taken too much<br />but i support your way of thinking its better to be sure than to be stupid<br /><br />btw those are&nbsp; my opinions, no scientific background..just my expirience<br /><br />cheers

If I used it every month without extended breaks, it would lose it&#039;s magic.<br /><br />I have used 350mg of MDMA in a day once. That was a long time ago and it made my tolerance go up. I started with 170mg and it hit me so hard and was amazing at the time, but I had to wait a few months before I did it again so my tolerance would lower and it would work properly.<br /><br />You can take 1 gram of MDMA in a day and not overdose. It would be very unpleasant and you would have a lot of bad side effects of the MDMA.

				DON&#039;T take 5-HTP, ever. Search through my old posts, I&#039;ve written a lot about this here. <br /><br />MDMA in small doses is not necessarily harmful given a diet high in fruit and low in grains, meat, and dairy, and judicious use of nutritional supplementts. Properly used I think it can have a wide variety of beneficial effects, as was demonstrated in the &#039;80s and as is being demonstrated now by MAPS. That some neuroscientists were able to cause brain damage in chimps by injecting them with extreme doses of MDMA does not mean we should think of it primarily as harmful. It&#039;s a very powerful tool and should be respected as such.

				If you stopped taking the 5-HTP 3-4 days before you should be good, in fact you preloaded exactly how you&#039;re supposed to...maybe throwing up took the rest of the pill out of your stomach which is why your roll got cut short?<br /><br />As long as you don&#039;t sideload the 5-HTP at the same time you take the MDMA you should be fine and the way you did it actually should help against neurotoxicity (i usually take it the next few nights after the roll too to get my serotonin levels somewhat on track)

				Thanks for all the advice and info. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever use 5-HTP again after that experience anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know what you guys suggest preloading&nbsp; with and take the days following.

				5htp is not bad. its a building block for serotonin. 5htp is not really absorbed that well in the body and most of it is passed anyways.&nbsp; <br />serotonin can be made better by a healthy diet like tryptamine said.&nbsp; <br />i like taking 5thp by itself as a mood enhancer. it helped me get off of tobacco ;)

Rather than get stuck on an SSRI by my doctor again I started taking 5-htp. Last time I was on an SSRI I ended up with ED problems and more stress due to fighting with my girlfriend over than it was helping. What good is a drug that just adds more problems to stress out about? Anyway,,, I want to stay as far away from SSRI&#039;s as possible now.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t really needed the 5-HTP lately because I&#039;ve been in good spirit naturally. I definately wouldn&#039;t take it again so close to rolling though.<br /><br />The main thing that makes me think that the 5-htp had something to do with the bad time I had was that the roll didn&#039;t feel normal at all. The rushes were all so close together that I felt like I was just having intense hot flashes and it really felt like I had a whole 5 hour roll experience compressed into about 2 hours time. <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t a pleasant experience by any means and never want that to happen again if I can help it.
