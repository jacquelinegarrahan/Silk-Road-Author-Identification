				Sellers who sell shit that they know nothing about piss me off. Maybe someone knows something I don&#039;t but wtf would someone buy a crack pipe to smoke dmt or meth? I can only assume this seller knows nothing about smoking meth or dmt, assumes the buyer knows nothing or possibly neither the buyer and seller know nothing. Or maybe the seller knows something I don&#039;t but I don&#039;t think thats the case. Seen a lot of things but would love to watch someone burn up all their drugs using a crack pipe lol... <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/d8c0e9eb59

				I&#039;m sorry to say this but the OP obviously is new to smoking Meth.... <br />Step 1: Take gas torch and open valve and spark it<br />Step 2: Take glass tube and roll the end of it in the flame until it becomes red and the end fuses together<br />Step 3: Blow into non heated end of the glass tube while the end is still red. This will make a bubble.<br />Step 4: Take a thin tube, a hollow pen works well, and blow on the bubble gently until a small hole appears. <br />Step 5: Let your meth pipe cool down.....<br /><br />This is how people who only have crack pipes available at gas stations do it allllll the time...... Yes its economically cheaper to just buy an oil burner on ebay where they are dirt cheap, but I guess he just wants to make a buck.

For a second I thought you where serious. Oh wait you are serious! I guess growing up in the fucking heart of meth country and 15 years around it isn&#039;t enough experience. I guess you and everyone else who do it allllll the time know something I don&#039;t or maybe I&#039;m to fucking smart to try to make a meth pipe out of a crack pipe. I would opt to eating or snorting the shit before going to that extreme. If you don&#039;t have a pipe and you must smoke it then go steal a light bulb or some tin foil. Could one make a meth pipe out of a stem? I am sure but im sorry I have enough experience to know your full of shit and people don&#039;t do this all the time. I don&#039;t have a problem with the guy selling the thing but someone that advertises a stem as a meth/dmt pipe is either ignorant or assumes his buyer is. I&#039;ve said it before but will say it again you dowsmoke meth or dmt out of a crack pipe. You can call it as you see it but I assure you that I&#039;ve seen a lot of things and done most of them. I&#039;m not a recreational user I&#039;m a addict. I live the life people like you must read about online.
