				set and setting mate, you&#039;ve got to be in a good mood in a comfortable place. i cannot emphasize this enough. <br /><br />other than that have fun! i can&#039;t speak about amt as i&#039;ve not done it but it&#039;s nothing like mdma, coke,pills or bud. have you done shrooms before? it&#039;s a more powerful version of that. and get a copy of the Beano, the kids comic, or something equally as silly. i guarantee you will not get off the first page without crying tears of laughter :)

				My advice would be,<br /><br />Make sure you have 12 hours free, where you won&#039;t be interrupted by anything that will throw your trip off. Parents, roomates etc coming home, people knocking on your door, phone ringing etc.<br /><br />Outdoors in the sun and nature is good, but stay away from anything that could be dangerous like cliffs, rivers etc. Not because of the hype about wanting to fly etc, that is just bullshit. But you may be unsteady on your feet and won;t be able to judge distances etc well.<br /><br />Have some good music ready to help you through any anxiety etc. One small thing could throw you off, for me it was a heavy metal song which really freaked me out. So I sat and listened to some calming music instead.<br /><br />If outside make sure you have a selection of warm clothes, things to sit on etc. If inside make a nest of covers and pillows, but be aware you may want to get up and walk and look around.<br /><br />LSD is much better with friends or partners taking at the same time. Much more of a blast, try to not mix it with anything on the first time.<br /><br />If one your own, have a friend on speed dial&nbsp; who knows you will be tripping. You never know when you might want to hear a friendly voice.<br /><br />Just plan it well, be prepared, good mind set, good setting you will be fine and have a blast.<br /><br />Oh and stay away from arseholes, people that is, will fuck your shit up.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Food&nbsp; &nbsp;

				No sunlight, as your pupil dilation might be a problem to you, at least it has been for me at certain times. stars ! They&#039;re almost. a must to me when I drop. If in the right circumstance. , you will discover a new nature to those beautiful shimmy beings of conscious. light. prepare your joints or marijuana before hand . as well as your food or drink that you may or may not what to take part in. make things easier on yourself with proper preparation. if you are going. to be with friends. be with. friends that will realize themselves as the eyes of the world, meaning that there is only so much people can relate on a surface level of communication and that certain times trying to relate or care about someone else&#039;s particular goings on can be stressful and a waste , while other times it can lead to extreme closeness and compassionate love. just be light and love...sorry for misspelled words and bad formatting , I&#039;m on a phone right now<br />&nbsp;

Some people I&#039;ve come across, hardcore psychonauts and the like, seem to think trips should be planned and directed (which may work for them), but the best trips I&#039;ve had have been just me, my music, a bottle of water and a lot of nature.

				+1 to whoever mentioned polarized sunglasses.&nbsp; I always wear a giant pair of polarized &quot;HD&quot; sunglasses; everything appears more crisp, colors seem to &quot;pop&quot; a lot more, and the brightness of the sun is a non-issue.&nbsp; Also, they sort of act as a security blanket for me if I ever get uncomfortable around a bunch of people.&nbsp; Sometimes people look at me weird when it&#039;s 10pm and dark out, and I&#039;m still wearing my sunglasses at a musi festival...

				Lessee... Euphoria, clean, healthy feeling body high that&#039;s not overwhelming at all, relaxing but alert, constantly evolving fractals of iridescence in white walls and ceilings, love and acceptance for everything around you, the feeling that your standing on the shore of a bright and shining future of mind-blowing psychedelic adventure...<br /><br />That&#039;s an acid high for me, and everyone else I&#039;ve talked to. Really, do anything you&#039;d be comfortable doing under those effects, cause that&#039;s what you can generally expect below 400 mcg (in my experience).<br /><br />Also, I personally love sunshine on acid, but I&#039;m also nocturnal myopic, which has me craving more brightness to improve my non-corrected vision.

				you should invite your mate over and watch a bunch of violent movies together.&nbsp; he should have a bunch of coke that he can do while you trip on acid so he&#039;s alert and can watch over you.&nbsp; <br />eat a large pizza right before you drop the tabs, cuz you&#039;ll want to have enough energy for the trip.&nbsp; <br />try not to look away from the tv for very long, cuz stuff will look weird and you&#039;ll start to think about stuff you wouldn&#039;t normally think about.&nbsp; <br />also, music sounds weird when you&#039;re on acid; for some reason when I was listening to my favorite record I thought &quot;wow, indie rock is kinda boring.&quot;&nbsp; really freaked me out, so now i don&#039;t listen to music on acid anymore.&nbsp; <br />lighting is important: you&#039;ll want the brightest lights possible without sacrificing that &quot;artificial&quot; ambiance.&nbsp; fluorescent tube bulbs are the best, IMO.&nbsp; <br />definitely buy a newspaper and read it while tripping...the news is hella trippy.&nbsp; <br />oh and put the volume of your phone ringer as high as it goes so you don&#039;t miss a call; talking to your family or old friends on the phone is a really great experience while tripping.<br />and last, don&#039;t forget to have your gun loaded in case the cops find out that you&#039;re tripping; you&#039;ll need to protect yourself from the raid they&#039;re gonna do at 6am<br /><br />have fun!

I personally recommend a solid 80-100 mcg, which is what I started with. The next weekend I took 180-200, and the weekend after that I took some 480-520. It was pretty spec-fucking-tacular, though I was unable to speak for much of the first time, being paralyzed with self-consciousness. Next time though, I committed to doing better beforehand and I was the most talkative one that night. The last time it was well split among the group (3 people inc me),<br /><br />Another option is, before anything, try a single toke of DMT. It&#039;s clear headed, happy, visual, auditory, and it lasts all of 5 minutes. It&#039;s a wonderful preview and I honestly suggest that before anything.

				a lot of lucy I have done comes in stages. The acid comes on in waves until it finally peaks at it&#039;s most intense stage. You should know it when you get there. The signs of this are large pupil dilation and big time trips like the ground will be waving as you walk and the walls and pictures come alive and trees breath pretty heavy. Closed eye visuals can be just as intense. It varies from different acid and blotters. 1 blotter sometimes has an average of 4 hour of the most intense stage but then the over all is anywhere from 8 to 12 hours. You have been getting great advice from the good people here so not much more needed to be said. I like orange juice while I&#039;m tripping

				I love how it&#039;s not just a come up, peak, then slowly back down like a weed high. With LSD, there will be times when I ask myself &quot;Am I sober now?&quot; <br /><br />Then wait a few seconds..<br /><br />Then it&#039;s like &quot;Oh, fuck, definitely not&quot;, and the intensity just rolls over me again. :)<br />

Get introspective, think about your life and how you&#039;ve gotten to where you are and where you want to be in the future. Even in the worst of times, even in the worst trip imaginable, just focus on how much stronger you&#039;ll be for making it through it should the trip turn dark. :) Basically accept the fact that what you just ingested has the power to change who you are, take advantage of that and become who you want to be. I&#039;ve taken LSD more than the average person in this time and age and despite that it still feels like I&#039;m about to embark on an adventure every single time I dose. I still remember my first time tripping with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and it was unbelievable, it was as though my entire life was leading up to that point and I was born again a new and better person...that&#039;s how I want it to be with everyone their first time. It&#039;s a very noble undertaking to discover who you are and accept the being you see because it&#039;s not often a person get&#039;s that chance in life. :))

				The first time I did acid was in 1993 and it was a real eye opener. A mind blowing experience. I had a co-worker who had friends that were dead heads so I tripped for a solid 2 years almost every other night. Would have been every night but I quickly grew accustom to the wait time in between trips so that it would have the full effects. Acid has definately showed me different ways of thinking and opened up a whole new world. I got some soon after I found the road and it had been at least ten years or more since I had tripped. I sure do appreciate the Silk Road.<br /><br />My favorite part of tripping on lucy is during the most intense stage and I love a good thunder and lightening storm in the am hours. I love that &quot;peak&quot; period but it seems I need at least 150ug to get a descent trip. I peaked pretty good from one yin yang dolpin but could have handled more with ease

In a good way, or most of it. It went wrong at some point but mostly i enjoyed it.<br /><br />So, it was one of the most mind blowing drugs i did ;). <br /><br />Definitely you don&#039;t want to be interrupted in the middle of a trip, my mom called me while i was tripping, i thought she was calling me from the hell, i got some seconds of sobriety so i could tell her to hang up that everything was ok, and then BANG &quot;oh fuck, my mom is calling me from the entrances of the Earth, side by side with Satan...&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend one acid for first timers, take half of one good clean acid, that should be enough.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Okay, you were in a fucking horrible situation to try acid and really shouldn&#039;t be giving advice on this subject because you went about it in a completely immature way. Also what the fuck is &#039;one acid&#039;? You mean one tab? ::)<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;d recommend against what this novice said and I&#039;d tell you to try between 200-300µg your first time somewhere safe, comfortable, and familiar. So long as you&#039;re mature and ready enough to delve into the world of psychedelics you&#039;ll have your mind blown and life changed forever. Remember, LSD is a tool and not a plaything. Get introspective, think about your life and how you&#039;ve gotten to where you are and where you want to be in the future. Even in the worst of times, even in the worst trip imaginable, just focus on how much stronger you&#039;ll be for making it through it should the trip turn dark. :) Basically accept the fact that what you just ingested has the power to change who you are, take advantage of that and become who you want to be. I&#039;ve taken LSD more than the average person in this time and age and despite that it still feels like I&#039;m about to embark on an adventure every single time I dose. I still remember my first time tripping with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and it was unbelievable, it was as though my entire life was leading up to that point and I was born again a new and better person...that&#039;s how I want it to be with everyone their first time. It&#039;s a very noble undertaking to discover who you are and accept the being you see because it&#039;s not often a person get&#039;s that chance in life. :))<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dude, chill out :P<br /><br />it was a bit immature, yes indeed. But it was my first time, some years ago, with a serious drug. You&#039;re not much of a reader, are you?<br /><br />Here in Portugal we call it &quot;one acid&quot; for each square :). I&#039;ll not forget those Dancing Bears lol<br /><br />Gare Oak, chill a bit in your corner man. I was telling him to be in peace, to not get disturbed and told him about my incident/mistake .

				What I do to prepare:<br /><br />1. Make sure I have an entire day to myself, so I can mentally prep myself before the trip, I can trip without interruption, and I can come down peacefully at my own rate.<br /><br />2. Have a sitter. I have a few close friends who I sit and in return they sit me as well. You should consider them to be one of your best friends.

That was my third experience in that vein, and it took seriously contemplating each of them, committing them to memory, then poring over them collectively to really develop in a way that could be understood the underlying structure of my personal hell (I could actually go much more in depth if anyone is interested, though I advise anyone who&#039;s nervous to stay away from reports of difficult trips). Not always fun, especially since powerful memories have a way of coming on like a hardcore flashback when I think about them too hard (this is true of sober memories as well as psychedelic for me, I&#039;m not talking acid flashbacks like people tend to fret about).<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that whenever anyone takes the time and effort to analyze part of a psychedelic experience and explain it in a way that&#039;s understandable, a(n un)surprising number of people say &quot;Hey, that&#039;s exactly what it&#039;s like!&quot; Surprising because of how the experience is generated within our own mind and could potentially vary wildly, unsurprising because people are more the same than different, and Lucy has a pretty consistent personality across every dose, accounting for dose size.

				where am i going wrong? i am really getting in to this hole psychedelic thing but im not finding much joy, i first ever started mith amt this was a fun experience where the walls rippled and floor moved but i felt i wanted more out of it, so i moved on to lsd and done the two tabs in one night and felt only mild effects the most i saw was the letters on my pc screen moving around. but nothing more except it kept me awake all night and them early morning hours are the worst after any stimulant so i took 20mg of valium and went to sleep at around 9am. after some further research i come across 25i and 25c nbome, i started with the 25i and found this slightly more powerful and energetic (kinda like a light mdma feeling) a few visuals and watched avatar while on it, great film to watch on it, but still felt like i want more so doubled the dose but got same effect, now i waited a week and then tried the 25c in my eyes this is not as good as the I but some mild visuals nothing more. <br /><br />so where do i go from here? i am looking for a mind blowing visual display of colors and i dont care if it is a bad trip as long as i get a trip!!!! frustrating to say the least.... do i need a huge 10tab dose of acid? or is there better out there in the 2c family? there are just so mant to choose from i dont know where to start, i hear 2c-i is good but manic but how true is this? or maybe strooms but eatting them puts me off<br /><br />someone help i want a trip but its just not happening for me&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				This thread&#039;s been going for a good few pages, but I have to admit to being a bit of an LSD-safety freak so I&#039;m gonna type out my usual instructions for first timers.&nbsp; I&#039;m typing this up as a guide for LSD first timers who are NOT using a sitter, but ideally you should have someone who&#039;s got a bit of psychedelic experience with you, sober, to keep an eye out.<br /><br />Beforehand - <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First things first. You need to prepare for LSD before you take it, not during. Think of it like a roller coaster. Once you&#039;re on, you&#039;re on. However, if you&#039;ve got the safety bars in place and your wallet safely tucked away, most of the risk is dramatically reduced. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing you want to do is prepare your set and setting. Don&#039;t take LSD for the first time unless you are happy, stable, and in a good place in your life. With a bit of experience, sure, you can take it when you&#039;re in a crappy mood, but the first time will be your roughest. When it comes to setting, use your common sense. That starts with doing it inside, away from straights, for the first time at least.&nbsp; Clean your room/apartment/house/crack den. Yeah, really. I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re the biggest stoner on earth, get the place tidy. Hoover the carpet. Get rid of anything sharp you could stand on. If you&#039;re more comfortable in a place that&#039;s a little cluttered, then cool, but don&#039;t leave the place in a total mess. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Secondly, take advanced precautions for anxiety or bad-tripping. Personally? I buy half a kilo of starburst and a few litres of orange juice, because I loved both of them as a kid and they pretty much instantly take me to a happy place. Avoid hot drinks, but get some food and drink that makes you comfortable and gives you feelings of security. What this is is up to you. Candy that you really liked as a kid is usually a pretty good idea. Then, make a music playlist specifically to chill yourself out. The sort of music that you find appropriate for this if up to you. Maybe it&#039;s Shpongle, maybe it&#039;s an ambient In Flames song, maybe it&#039;s the Beatles. With this sort of thing in place, you have a prescribed way to calm yourself down, and one of the best ways to do with the feelings of inescapable anxiety that come with a bad-trip is to create a &#039;way out&#039; - if you feel like you can do something at all to deal with it, then those feelings are going to go away a lot faster because one of the most consistent triggers for a negative experience is feeling like your situation is permanent and inescapable.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Third. Music. Get your playlists set out in advance. I don&#039;t know what technology you use, but make a mix-tape CD, or a spotify/youtube playlist, or just arrange your CD collection so you can get stuff out quickly. Music is very important, not only because it makes tripping more intense, but because it can help with the weird feelings of timelessness that can creep out first-timers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fourth. Dosage. Don&#039;t be a fuckwit. If it is your first time, stick to a ~200ug dose. DO NOT GO ABOVE 400ug. Acid at higher dosages is a very different beast and one you do not wish to confront without some experience.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lastly, be considerate. If you live with other people, tell them if at all possible - my flatmates are cool and for a while I had a &quot;On acid. Do not disturb.&quot; sign that I could throw on my door. Dealing with people unexpectedly on acid isn&#039;t nice, either.<br /><br />During - <br />Most of the work with acid is beforehand. Here&#039;s a few tips for the experience itself, however.<br /><br />- LSD takes hours to fully kick in. Do not go &#039;Hey, I feel fine. Maybe another tab?&#039; after an hour. This is stupid and you will regret doing so.<br />- Don&#039;t go outside first time without an escort.<br />- KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FIRST TIME. Sure, some people can trip in pitch darkness with no issues. Some people find it scares them shitless. Find this out when you&#039;re a little better at this.<br />- Don&#039;t try to creep yourself out deliberately. I shouldn&#039;t have to say this but experience has taught me to tell people this. Yes, you can fuck with yourself and induce a bad trip. It can and will happen if you do so. Don&#039;t do this.<br />- Don&#039;t go outside first time.<br />- Don&#039;t call, facebook, or message anyone who does not know you are on acid.<br />- Don&#039;t go outside first time.<br />- Mixing other substances first time, except maybe weed, isn&#039;t a good idea. Don&#039;t get bored and decide to take half a gram of MDMA to see what happens. This especially applies with other hallucinogenics.<br /><br />I hope this helps someone at least - I will happily admit to being very conservative about this stuff, but in my experience it&#039;s justified. LSD is very capable of screwing with your head in a way that most people underestimate. If anyone wants any other tips, feel free to ask!<br />

Here&#039;s a few tips for the experience itself, however.<br /><br />- LSD takes hours to fully kick in. Do not go &#039;Hey, I feel fine. Maybe another tab?&#039; after an hour. This is stupid and you will regret doing so.<br />- Don&#039;t go outside first time without an escort.<br />- KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FIRST TIME. Sure, some people can trip in pitch darkness with no issues. Some people find it scares them shitless. Find this out when you&#039;re a little better at this.<br />- Don&#039;t try to creep yourself out deliberately. I shouldn&#039;t have to say this but experience has taught me to tell people this. Yes, you can fuck with yourself and induce a bad trip. It can and will happen if you do so. Don&#039;t do this.<br />- Don&#039;t go outside first time.<br />- Don&#039;t call, facebook, or message anyone who does not know you are on acid.<br />- Don&#039;t go outside first time.<br />- Mixing other substances first time, except maybe weed, isn&#039;t a good idea. Don&#039;t get bored and decide to take half a gram of MDMA to see what happens. This especially applies with other hallucinogenics.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />yeah as the late great Bill Hicks said &quot;Take off from the ground first, you don&#039;t see ducks lining up for the elevator!&quot;

				Dont get too uptight about it and being as natural and normal state of mind before is whats accelerated (or exaggerated) during and after.<br />Small things grow into bigger ones<br />your little phobia can get the better of you unless you take control of yourself and your situation.<br />It is many things including self healing<br /><br /><br />The objective should be discovery, discovery of you and your self thought process and what the universe has to offer you.<br /><br /><br />Let the Acid flow<br />TWM<br />

By far one of the easiest ways to eat them if you&#039;re not into the shroomy flavor. ;) Also I say eat all three grams, they won&#039;t be that strong to be honest. Maybe a mid-level *** trip which won&#039;t be too bad, so don&#039;t sweat it. ;)

				I&#039;d recommend eating all of them unless you&#039;re really small or something. I usually take at least five, and over at Erowid, 3.5g dried seems to be the most common amount.

				right where to begin its been a while since i have posted on this topic and so much magic has happened since,&nbsp; last night i tried another acid vendor&#039;s (Janis) tabs and this was defo 100% genuine Acid, if you have been fooled and disappointed by fake acid i fully suggest and HIGHLY recommend you try the real deal and dont give up hope. i got 3x 100ug tabs and took them all at once (Note Tasteless), now after my first unsuccessful DMT journey, it just felt painstakingly long to take effect. but like i say thats prob more to do with the fact that DMT is so instant, more on that soon but for now back to the acid, it took about half hour before i started seeing odd things, (i spent this hole time in front of my PC, and i was fully functional throughout) for example the icons and buttons on the screen where moving like a slight wobble only ever so often like its teasing you,this happened every 10 minutes or so (this is what i mean buy it felt painstakingly slow), but slowly the gaps got smaller and more often, the way i would sum up a low does of acid..(300ug)..i ay low but it effets each differently but to me this dose was far to mellow and relaxed an easy trip. i wanted more challenging issues to deal with now in my opinion&nbsp; Acid Has got its own never ending building&nbsp; rhythm a kind of wobble theme that builds up, when you reach full peak hours but feels weeks later it all builds up like a story&nbsp; and it all comes together<br /><br /><br />THIS was when I got a sudden&nbsp; unresistantable&nbsp; inspiration telling&nbsp; me to do A hit Of DMT half way though slow acid trip, i know (madness) i do not recommend you try this your self its just some thing i had to do and it was beyond my capability to risist, so now with a glass meth style pipe in my amory i loaded it up with 75mg&#039;s and sat back and menally prepaid myself for what i was about to face and have to deal with cos its a one way ticket once thats smokes gone theres no turning back. i pulled as hard as i could on the pipe and took the first hit and held my breath, now this is where it gets hard cos before you get a chance to get the pie in your mouth for the most important second hit, the world is already falling apart around you and its challenging to get it right, i missed the second hit so didnt quite make it though but annoyingly close, im learning with each failure and had one hell of an eye opening experience, words will never be enough to fully explain DMT its some thing one must see for themselves, but as i tried and failed to get a second hit and i thought i did until i saw the pipe the next morning, as i tried to align lighter and pipe everything was falling apart around me and that feeling of the biggest overweening strangeness,&nbsp; i just sat in my arm chair and closed my eyes... after a few seconds dark grey shapes&nbsp; slowly getting lighter and lighter and slowly color is introduced in to the flow as it where (its a flow and your going along for the ride no matter what and its smoother and as comfortable as poss if you just go with it,&nbsp; if you try and fight it i would imagine it could become quite alkword although even letting yourself go with it is still overwhelming and strange, cos there are feelings there that just dont exsist in this relm,) but as i sat there watching with amazement the light becomes more and more intense and out of that swirling light or energy little bits peel off slowly at first but increasing,&nbsp; the little pieces of&nbsp; light&nbsp; or energy that peeled of shoot off and make a outline of a face shape, its just glitches at first but they get faster and faster until you can see a outline of a face thats left purely out of trails left behind buy the light,(i can not expertize enough just how overwelied and powerless you are&nbsp; but sadly this is where it all started to ware off before that climax it just wore of&nbsp; (this is why the second hits so important , its the final step blast off. and it slowly faded away, and the thing with DMT it needs to be done the first time, its not something you can chase with more, you either get enought smoke in first try or you dont. if you try again the same day your just wasting DMT. cos you will never get close again, to the first attempt that day, but the next didnt seem an issue and if only i had got that second hit right i could have continued the story but have no fear because one day it will all go just perfectly and i will be able to tell you what i thought i saw happen. <br /><br />im sure a few are wondering how the effects&nbsp; of DMT differed when i was mid acid trip, and all i have to cross reference to is my first unsussesful try a few days before, where i got a slight teaser of its power. and saw what many refer to as the mustroom like effects it has in minor doses. on its own DMT was Rapid powerful overweening but very fast, as for the effects at low doses. i am almost inclinded to state a minor dose as a hole new drug in the lsd range, the walls ripple and spin and color is much more simple and blends together far better, there is zero contrast to anything like no edges and that makes you feel like your in a 2d world everything flat and no shading or shadows,&nbsp; and the mid acid trip was the same but different almost slowed down giving you half a chance of understanding whats going on. <br /><br />the acid almost slowed the flow down to a pace that was at the very tip of our ability to see, this is NOT a trip for the faint hearted and could properly push a few over the edge permanently,&nbsp; if you are not menally, physically and i think most importantly emotionally Ready to face those moments that felel ever lasting and it lake everything you have to make it though&nbsp; and thats just one of many non stop moments you have to pass and the only way though is to let go, but not in the physical sense, more menially let go of everything that you have been thought before now and it takes everything you have to let go of the comforts of reality you must have a free mined approach to things that you are going to come across and up against, it takes everything you have every last drop you prosess in that one moment&nbsp; to get to the the next moment (The Flow)&nbsp; and thats only the start of a endless chain off moments )&nbsp; and its not until you learn to let go it becomes easier to get to the next moment.... you start to flow with it, until you let go you are trapped in the&nbsp; timeless relem&nbsp; &nbsp; ,the most noticable moment i can recall that is possable to put into words is a feeling of waiting never endeing moments an explain it was as the effects start to hit home and the flow takes over its so overwhelming and beyond anything you ever will see normally in your life. so its like a moment you have to cross where time feels like it stand still. and you are thinking about breathing cos breaths seem like a life time apart. it take for that one moment everything you possibly have as a human and the only way though it to let go of reality completely. its not easy at allbut once you do so much happens so quickly i could tell this story for ever and ever, but please dont read this and think cool and buy some, this is NOT a recreational high or feeling at any stretch of&nbsp; the imagination&nbsp; and if you go in to it not understanding then you will never see what else is out there.<br /><br />i can not stress enough how powerful and potant this chemical is. and if you go in looking from the &quot;i want to get high&quot; propective or way of thinking you will come out disapointed its more of a tool almost a form of transport to another place not in our universe anyhow <br /><br />im sure lots of opinions will follow i have tried my absolute best to put it in to words but there are two few, but this is my honest try :)&nbsp;
