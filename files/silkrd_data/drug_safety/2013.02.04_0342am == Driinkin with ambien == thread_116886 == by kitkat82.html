				I&#039;ve never heard of any issues like people not breathing or anything. As mentioned above, the memory loss will likely be the only real big issue, coupled with the fact that your judgement will be impaired by the drugs / alcohol meaning you might wake up in jail and not know how you got there. As an example, say you took the Ambien, had a few drinks, and then realized you really wanted some Burger King before bed... stuff like that might cause some issues.<br /><br />For me, Ambien alone is enough to make me forget the few minutes before I go to sleep. The few times I&#039;ve mixed it it just gets more forgetful. If you like to stay up and trip on it though not sure if the memory is still lost or just the bit before you fade out.

				Hehe.. sure there isn&#039;t anything missing from the fridge?<br /><br />Amnesia from the combination in&nbsp; moderate doses is a very common side effect. As such that&#039;s not all that dangerous, but the experience of total memory loss over a period of time can be rather frightening. <br /><br />As far as respiratory depression goes: that&#039;s not that likely to kill you if you have an ambien with a glass of whine (or 3). You may or may not have been woken gasping for breath, the annesia would have msaked that unless you slept with someone that noticed it. There are degrees to respiratory depression - often you will start breathing again once blood acidity has reached a dangerous point. This isn&#039;t healthy, but not immediately fatal either.
