				I have noticed that every addict on these shows smokes their oxy and snorts their xanax. Both of these are thought of to be much less effective as far as I&#039;ve researched online and on the forums. Could it possibly be just to make the user seem that much more addicted (smoking oxy looks much worse than simply eating oxy). Idk but I&#039;ve been up all night (on oxy) watching intervention and other various documentaries and this stuck out to me.

				I doubt they do it that way because it&#039;s better. Just speaking based on the people Ive met irl, but most pill snorters are people who are generally ignorant about damn near everything, and your guess is as good as mine as to why they do it. I have seen people snort 800mg neurontin and swear by it lol. Btw, I have never seen the word neurontin, only heard it, so that might not even be a word.
