				I have visible raised veins running all through my arms, I poke, poke, adjust depth, pull back on plunger and never get blood, never hit a fucking vein, I don;t get it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read online everything I can yet nothing explains why I can&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried injecting even though no blood was in the plunger and just ended up skin popping(missing).&nbsp; What the f**k am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Out of 50 tries I&#039;ve never once managed to hit a&nbsp; vein, tried my hands, arms, feet<br />

				First off use a new needles if you can. Once a needle is used even a couple of times the point gets fucked up.<br />Try different sized gauge and or needle length. Make sure the plunger does not stick before using it.<br /><br />I am seen people have issues when the rig more vertical. The more horizontal the better, rig should be almost laying on your forearm (when using arm). The points path to the vein will have a less of a slop. <br /><br />Break the skin and then pull the plunger non stop as you slowly move the needle further in. Once you see blood stop and pull back more and if you see more your good to go. You may also be way off in depth, veins can look closer then they are.&nbsp; Or you may have the whole needle in your arm and still push it to hit.<br /><br />Try to avoid hands and feet they have smaller veins. If you still cant hit a vein maybe get blood drawn to see a pro in action. Watching videos also may help.

				Also <br /><br />A needle that has a beveled point: ensure that the needle&#039;s point is at the bottom, i.e. you can see the sloping hole.<br /><br />Be sure to properly anchor the vein. Place the thumb of your free hand below the vein and pull down lightly. This will pull the skin and vein tight preventing it from &quot;rolling&quot; in most cases. Do not make a &quot;window&quot; to anchor the vein. This technique uses the thumb below the vein and the index finger above the vein. This puts your index finger at risk for an accidental needle stick.

				Ah, my friend,&nbsp; I don&#039;t have much good news in this area...my veins never got better, over time, only worse, to where now, even hospitals have trouble...have to use a butterfly to give blood...only surefire thing, for me, is to take a good hot shower...and then, easy does it, take your time...good luck...

				There&#039;s also the &quot;maybe you weren&#039;t meant to&quot; karma kind of thing.&nbsp; - I too shared your quasi-dilemma. - Usually only someone else could &quot;administer&quot; to me. It&#039;s a lot like how hard it is to slice ones wrists. There&#039;s a built-in &quot;harm-reduction&quot; in our bodies ( I believe) that keeps us from fucking&nbsp; up our bodies. - I&#039;m not saying &quot;God doesn&#039;t want you to get high&quot; - or any other holy roller bullshit. <br /><br />I&#039;m just saying, try another ROA -(Route of administration).&nbsp; Slamming is not going to &quot;catch on&quot; or become &quot;socially acceptable&quot; the same way weed has. Not in our lifetime anyway. <br /><br />I speak with some experience, and I&#039;m not a moron. I&#039;ve even stitched my own wounds when living on the streets for a period of time in my younger years. I feel it was nature&#039;s way, or whatever you want to think. <br /><br />If it&#039;s shootable,&nbsp; then you can also either, smoke it, snort it, orally ingest it, through &quot;parachuting&quot; or whatever. There&#039;s even &quot;plugging&quot; - If you don&#039;t know that one, the surprise awaits you on Google. <br /><br />Try a different route. <br /><br />Ever since the outtage, I&#039;ve seen some strange questions on here, and even stranger postings on SR by newbies with almost obvious &quot;handles&quot;. <br /><br />Whose to say, this isn&#039;t LE putting together a whole case of how SR and it&#039;s Forums teach those curious about intravenous drug use, how to &quot;do it right&quot;? <br /><br />Yes I am paranoid, but I&#039;m also pretty spiritual. I believe you just weren&#039;t meant to hit that vein! If you were supposed to, you would have already. <br /><br />Don&#039;t mind me, I&#039;m just an old fool.&nbsp; At least give what I wrote here some thought. <br /><br />People still &quot;think&quot;, don&#039;t they?<br /><br />- Jagfug69
