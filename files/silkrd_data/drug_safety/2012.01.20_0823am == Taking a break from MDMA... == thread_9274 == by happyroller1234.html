				I first did what I thought was MDMA last spring.&nbsp; It was a white pill.&nbsp; I felt pretty great, but nothing like I was expecting.&nbsp; However, I had a horrible comedown and it felt as if my heart were breaking.&nbsp; Not sure if it was bunk, but I decided I was done.&nbsp; Come this October, I tried pretty pure white Molly, snorted it with friends and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.&nbsp; Since then, I have taken Molly (doses range from 200-600 mg) once or twice a month.&nbsp; Since December, I have taken molly thrice.&nbsp; That worries me.&nbsp; And I didn&#039;t really get a good roll except the first time in December; I was getting these insane vibrations and waves of plesure...looking in the mirror was awesome!&nbsp; Anyhow, after getting two of my friends to try it with me last week, I decided to take at least a six month break.&nbsp; Till my birthday in the summer.&nbsp; Do you think six months is long enough of a break?&nbsp; I want to actually have a good roll and not just waste my money.&nbsp; Plus it&#039;s just depressing when you keep trying but you can&#039;t fully peak.&nbsp; It&#039;s fucking tantalizing.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to lose the magic.<br /><br />My question is, what other drugs should I avoid during this MDMA break?&nbsp; Should I avoid drugs like Methylone or other ones that react mainly with your serotonin?&nbsp; I smoke weed every day, and I rarely drink.&nbsp; Are psychedelics okay to dabble in while I&#039;m taking this break?<br /><br />Sorry if it&#039;s TL;DR, I&#039;m just pretty tired.&nbsp; But I would appreciate any feedback, as I&#039;m not super experienced with anything other than pot and DXM (in the past).

				It will never be the same as the first time and the more experienced you get with drugs in general the less overall affect they will have on you in the sense that you&#039;ve already been there and done that. It won&#039;t be new and exciting. That pretty much goes for life in general as well.<br /><br />Try to get quality fresh laid acid. That will blow your mind. When you decide to roll again take a hit of acid and 150mg of molly. You&#039;ll have fun. :)

				the most important thing when trying to gain the magic back is a healthy diet and vitamin intake. Daily take vitamin 2, b-6, b-12, and l trytophan. You can add piracetam to the the regiment(it really does wonders), but more important is stick to your break. Goodluck and i hope the magic comes back for you

				Honeymooning with MDMA! Generally not a good idea, but I know how it is with how awesome MDMA can be. You&#039;ve probably heard the whole thing about waiting 1-3 months between rolls, the longer the better. I can&#039;t think of any other advice, really, than just to wait as long as you can. Like marsvolta12 said, take some of those vitamins, and I think adding 5-HTP to the mix shouldn&#039;t hurt, either. You can get it off of Amazon, and it should help you replenish serotonin and I think it also helps reverse some damage done by MDMA. <br /><br />Good luck! Losing MDMA magic is tragic!

				Just seconding what everyone else is saying. Start a daily regime of 5-HTP and vitamin b6. Not only will you roll harder, your general mood will be better.<br /><br />Also, I have heard piracetam increases the effects of MDMA by a lot so that&#039;s something you might want to look into.

				Start taking piracetam every day so its in your system and take piracetam 30 minutes before you dose MDMA. It will really help your comedown and prevent tolerance. Makes it feel like a &quot;first time roll&quot;.

				Take Deprenyl/Rasgelline whenever you take MDMA to reduce neurotoxticity and reduce the terrible comedown. Although MAO-Bs don&#039;t make the high quite as fun. It also makes MDMA about 40% more potent. It enhances its effects on dopamine.

B6 is a cofactor and is not consumed during decarboxylation,, you need only a few milligrams.

				I see people suggesting a daily regimen of 5htp - please DO NOT do this.&nbsp; Taking 5htp daily will increase your average serotonin levels in the brain, and your brain will downregulate your receptors to compensate.&nbsp; So when you finally do roll, you won&#039;t roll nearly as hard!&nbsp; You are basically building up a tolerance for no reason.<br /><br />Additionally, your heart contains 5ht receptors, and daily intake a 5htp will be peripherally metabolized into 5ht.&nbsp; This will lead to your heart becoming less flesible and will significantly increase your chance of heart problems later in life!<br /><br />If you have low serotonin levels, you may take 5htp 24 hours before the roll (I suggest no more than 100mg) in order to achieve &quot;normal&quot; serotonin levels.&nbsp; Also, of course, take 5htp AFTER you roll to reduce neurotoxicity and reduce the comedown.<br /><br />TL;DR: Don&#039;t take 5htp except immediately after you roll.&nbsp; It&#039;s unhealthy and doesn&#039;t help.

				I find that taking nootropics pre and post roll is the best method of reducing comedown and avoiding tolerance build up. It seems like people tend to recommend piracetam, but for the best effect I find that nefiracetam + aniracetam with a blend of other nootropics is far superior to piracetam alone. Animal studies have shown that nefiracetam may help reduce methamphetamine administration/cravings while subjective reports indicate that aniracetam greatly potentiates the effect of nefiracetam. My local scene is flooded with &quot;molly&quot; (methylone) and everyone who I know that &quot;rolls&quot; eats my stack like candy. Of course they would never buy it from me (I have bulk powder and a capping machine) but would call me in the middle of the night/early in the morning asking if I had any I could spare, often times claiming this would be the last time they would &quot;roll&quot;.

				Yeah I took aniracetam and it really helped. I am working on getting noopept as well as the other racetams. <br /><br />Some of the more exotic nootropics are proving quite difficult and I have gotten nothing from a couple sample orders. But I am confident that I will get some good product. I&#039;ll let you know.<br /><br />Probably the absolute most well known nootropic for use with MDMA is Deprenyl though.

				Which ones are you having difficult finding? I have a bunch of suppliers and most of them are willing to drop ship for me, purity is always top notch. The only downside is that a minimum order would be 100-1000 grams, even for the more active ones.

NMDA (40 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease in both [3H]paroxetine binding Bmax and 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels 7 days after treatment. The monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor L-deprenyl (2 mg/kg) administered 30 min before MDMA blocked these decreases. MDMA (40 mg/kg) also maximally increased the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (an indicator of lipid peroxidation) 12 hr after treatment in all three brain regions studied. This increase in malondialdehyde formation was also blocked by pretreatment with L-deprenyl. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity was also significantly reduced 18 hr after MDMA. L-Deprenyl reversed this decrease in TPH activity. Another experiment confirmed that a significant fraction of [3H]dopamine uptake into hippocampal synaptosomes was blocked by 500 nM fluoxetine, a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor. These data suggest that the deamination by monoamine oxidase-B of excessive dopamine within the 5-HT terminal generates hydrogen peroxide that may lead to membrane lipid peroxidation, and perhaps other oxidative insults, resulting in selective 5-HT terminal degeneration subsequent to MDMA treatment.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
