				Hey guys!&nbsp; Last night I tried 25i-nbome for the first time. I apologise if this account is a bit sketchy, I haven&#039;t had much sleep and my mind has been overworked!<br /><br />I had received 1mg tabs from Duderugs last week, which i&#039;d bought in the 420 sale.&nbsp; I really couldn&#039;t wait to find out what the fuss was about! I&#039;ve been on the Road here for probably 4 or 5 months now, and have been procuring a variety of substances which include 2cb, MDMA, MDA, 2C-E, 2C-I etc.&nbsp; So far up until this point I have only consumed some MDMA (nothing new, usually amazing though), Cannabis (frequent use), two barely threshold level LSD trips (not from the Road). Basically, the only new drug I have tried in my time here has been 2cb, which I love. Luckily for me, I think my 2cb experiences have been a great primer for the experience with 25i-nbome that I had last night.<br /><br />Most of my friends, although great people, open-minded, intelligent, friendly and I have lots in common with, don&#039;t share my desire and curiosity for the psychedelic experience.&nbsp; I do have a couple of good buddies that sometimes dabble, but never really seek it out or go out of their way for it. So, like me up until this point, they&#039;ve all had threshold experiences and kinda moved on.&nbsp; So last night I planned to take 2 tabs alone in my apartment.&nbsp; I was confident that I could handle this dose and I was happy enough to do it alone. I decided at the last minute to message a couple of friends at about 10:30 pm to see if they were interested in joining. Not expecting a &quot;yes&quot; from any of them really, one of my very good friends actually told me to wait up because he&#039;ll come join me. Also, he&#039;d been in contact with a sort of friend that I don&#039;t really spend much time with ever, but have known for years and get on with well. The kinda guy you&#039;d see in the same bars and clubs cause your social circles interlap.&nbsp; Anyway, so my good friend invited him to join us also, and he was travelling between towns that night and was just about to arrive back in our city.<br /><br />Off I went to get snacks (certainly didn&#039;t need those though!), and my friends arrived.&nbsp; Now at this point, I couldn&#039;t have been in a better mindset going into a trip because I felt like something had gone right, and it was meant to happen this way. I was planning on tripping alone and all of a sudden I had the best company ever! <br /><br />11:45am - I dose two full sized tabs by placing inbetween upper lip and gum.&nbsp; My friends dose 1.5 tabs.&nbsp; It was not unpleasant or hard to hold there, and I didn&#039;t have a problem with my mouth filling up with saliva or anything like that. We are sitting around in my loungeroom with some Four Tet, Burial, Animal Collective, little bit of hip hop (think it helped bring a little party aspect out actually) etc.<br /><br />12:30 - I&#039;m definitely feeling something a bit different. This was just the first signs showing themselves.&nbsp; A pleasant mild sensation. I felt a little bit cold, nothing major.<br /><br />1:00 - Getting stronger now. I&#039;m starting to get little dazzling things popping up in my field of vision. Things sparkle all around without me trying to focus on anything. I found it very similar to moderate-high dose 2cb at this point.&nbsp; Wavering patterns. My friend says the carpet looks like lego. My thinking has become a little bit impaired, harder to hold conversation, but because we all feel it it doesn&#039;t matter, we just take longer to articulate our thoughts. We look at each others&#039; pupils and they are massive. We are giddy from excitement at this point (I am especially).<br /><br />1:30 - The effects are getting pretty strong now. I assume this to be near peak.<br /><br />1:45 - Because I was in a good set and setting and I liked where this trip was going, I decided to take another tab, bringing my grand total to 3.&nbsp; I really wanted to experience something different, not just flashes of light, or the essence of pinks and greens, but something more mentally manifesting.&nbsp; I notice my mouth is a little bit uncomfortable from the bitter acidity feeling of the tabs, and my mouth is dry. I have a bit of a cold atm too, and I noticed exacerbated symptoms of a clogged up head, not comfortable, but manageable.<br /><br />2:00 - My first trip to the bathroom, and first time during the trip I isolated myself in a separate room from my friends.&nbsp; I do my business, and end up staring at the wall half a metre in front of me.&nbsp; This is the most profound moment I&#039;ve had in psychedelics so far. All of a sudden the rough white paint job on the rough textured brick wall started displaying ancient Egyptian imagery, such as pharaohs, manifesting themselves from the texture of the painted bare white wall. The outlines burst in slow motion and rotated around on the wall, shrinking and growing. I was seeing faces in everything. Then all these little tiny mouths started moving their lips. They seemed to be moving their lips to the music that was playing in the other rooms. I found this astonishing! I was so happy in that moment that I had broken through into another layer of my mind (so, existence, you could argue), that their was no way the hallucinations felt threatening. I was just happy to finally have witnessed a new layer of life. I stared at the wall for a few minutes and then went outside to my balcony. I have a big balcony with a magnificent view that is semi-panoramic. I can see 3 suburbs away to my left, mountains in the distance, city directly in front of me, not to brag but it&#039;s got it all! I stood out there and my hearing was so sensitive that I could hear a single leaf blowing around on the road 4 storeys below.&nbsp; I got a sense that I was existing just outside of time, but that I could hear the ecological life systems of my earthly environment with increased clarity.<br /><br />3:00 - I keep returning to the bathroom to blow my nose etc, and I willingly enter into the same realm each time, same imagery, just as strong.&nbsp; The Egyptian symbols are interesting, because I don&#039;t really have a great interest in ancient Egypt or anything like that (although, of course, it is fascinating), so this gave me the sense that perhaps the world was telling me something. I didn&#039;t think too deeply into this however.<br /><br />4:00 - Effects are starting to decrease a little bit. Very slowly but surely.&nbsp; The positive mindset that we are all in does not wane one bit though, and we&#039;re still getting flashes of colour, wavering, visuals.&nbsp; <br /><br />My friend that I don&#039;t see too often had brought these &quot;LED coloured poi balls&quot; with him. I was transfixed on the vividness of the colours morphing from these lovely little soft light-balls.&nbsp; Obviously, it&#039;s just an object with a battery in it, but I was in awe of the colours and how they slowly changed and displayed combination colours in between.&nbsp; I highly recommend these!&nbsp; I found them strangely comforting during the trip. I could twirl it and make pretty shapes in the air, but mainly it was like a comforting energy that I kept with me.&nbsp; If I needed to go down to my car to get something, i&#039;d take this with me, and I found it almost reassuring that I wasn&#039;t going to freak out being by myself in the dark for a couple of minutes. <br /><br />4:30 - Same friend shows us this new tv show from the creators of &quot;Archer&quot;, and &quot;It&#039;s always sunny in Philadelphia&quot; called &quot;Unsupervised&quot;.&nbsp; Now I like the odd stoner cartoon as much as the next guy, I don&#039;t make a point of watching goofball comedy or anything, but this cartoon was seriously the funniest thing I had ever seen.&nbsp; The sheer weirdness of the characters, a lot of which were society&#039;s stereotypes, and the round-in-circles antics of the show, combined with undertones of social commentary that I picked up on provided me with the most laughter I can ever remember having.&nbsp; We were all crying of laughter for an hour straight!&nbsp; Visuals are decreasing.<br /><br />5:00 - Not much in the way of visuals left anymore, but we&#039;re still in a great mood.&nbsp; We put more music on. We feel a tad twitchy, and a little bit friend to be honest, so we just kinda ride that out not knowing whether to go home and try to sleep, or stay awake and be productive because of the new lease on life!<br /><br />6:30 - I decided I HAD to have those glowing balls, started looking up nearest stockists on the internet.<br /><br />7:00 - Feeling cold and pretty clogged up in the nose and head.&nbsp; Feeling pressure. I get a slight headache that is barely there but ends up persisting for the rest of the day (I didn&#039;t have any painkillers). I feel exhausted, but probably can&#039;t sleep, so I don&#039;t try.<br /><br />Walked into the city to pick up some glowing balls later that day, they were all out, so I just got sushi. Eating sushi by myself, grabbing plates from the train I felt calm and at ease. I then drove a short distance and bought the glow balls from somewhere else.<br /><br />This drug gave me a great afterglow, which helped me easily integrate into the new day despite not having slept at all.<br /><br />Had a nap in the afternoon, woke up at dinner, played with new glow balls, smoked a nice nice joint, made some tea, came on here and wrote this trip report.<br /><br />Can&#039;t recommend duderugs tabs enough! No wonder he&#039;s had such high demand!&nbsp; I was lucky enough to get bonus tabs by finalising early.&nbsp; It was great to share around without charging friends money (as opposed to locally sourced acid being expensive and often very dodgy, hard to source where I live)<br /><br />This trip has had a lasting impression on me already, my first mega breakthrough into mind manifesting hallucinations, and I recommend it to everyone interested!<br /><br />I don&#039;t think going above 3mg is necessary for me, so maybe next time, provided the situation is right, i&#039;ll just dose 3 straight up instead of 2 topped up by another one later.<br /><br />I know this is long, thanks for reading! <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />
