				Well, I received Kwiktrips 25i near the end of April and was well prepared/ready for a Psychedelic experience. (or so i thought)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What follows is the trip report I wrote the day after my 1st psychedelic experience and then I plan on adding in some information near the bottom of the experiences I have had since my first trial.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am absolutely in love with discussing everything about this, so if anyone wants to ask me questions, state their opinion, or just straight out PM me to talk about psychedelics in general PLEASE DO!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-* :) :D <br /><br /><br />0:00 Put 1 tab in mouth, feeling anxious but ready.&nbsp; Have done plenty of research and stayed away from reading any bad trip reports (Tripping is all about set/setting anyways).&nbsp; I make sure I am completely alone in my room and continue browsing the web while waiting for affects. <br />0:20 - tab still in mouth (somehow had a hard time keeping it in my lip, don&#039;t think feeling anything yet) - take 2 benadyrl to deal with some general anxiety<br />1:00 - Still don&#039;t feel much yet, and I have convinced myself everything so far is placebo affect - take another tab<br />1:15 - Start to feel a bit weird, not sure if anxiety or nasusea or both<br />1:20- I load up Shpongle - DMT.&nbsp; My computer is lagging and i don&#039;t want to watch the video till later so its bugging me that im &quot;ruining&quot; intro for myself.<br /><br />Im still on FB talking with some friends, everything feels warm but no visuals.<br /><br />Within a few minutes after recording this 1:20 note and not feeling like I am tripping at all I kind of phase out into the corner of my room.&nbsp; I look back at my screen and the icons on my desktop seem to be growing and shrinking.&nbsp; At this point I am still convinced that I am just having the &quot;placebo affect&quot;.&nbsp; In hindsight, that 10 seconds of day dreaming into the corner of my room definitely seemed to kick start my trip. After staring at my screen for a few seconds I turn to look at a speaker in my room, now normally I cant really even see &quot;inside&quot; the speaker because there is a grate on the front which protects the actual inside.&nbsp; However, all of a sudden everything changed and the cylinders inside were warping just like a cartoon.&nbsp; This is when I realized &quot;holy shit I am tripping&quot;.&nbsp; For most of my trip I tried to stay in a day dreamish state but at this moment i pretended as if i HAD to be sober for a few seconds, when the speaker kept warping I knew my 6 hours had begun.<br /><br />Throughout my whole trip I would constantly look back at the speaker as a kind of safe haven to see how my visuals were affected.&nbsp; After staring around my room a bit I had a sudden draw to nature in general.&nbsp; Now, the only bad thing about my trip was a lot of muscle tension.&nbsp; I was tensing my legs up so much that I could barely walk.&nbsp; I went to go get socks and find shoes etc…. In all honesty this must of taken a good 30 mins.&nbsp; I kept wandering back and forth between my outside door and my room.&nbsp; I was so happy I just couldn&#039;t figure out how to utilize my time correctly.&nbsp; I started to have a sense that there is no need for me to trip immediately after this experience as everything &quot;makes sense&quot; and that I HAD to use my tripping time correctly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a back and front door to my house.&nbsp; I was going to go out the back door but there was kind of a dark tree out in the back (the back of my house is way messy, while front is well taken care of.&nbsp; And it just seemed awful to subject myself to this, on the way to the front door I made the mistake of looking in the mirror.&nbsp; Every 5 seconds of looking in the mirror was like 15 years of aging.&nbsp; Every impurity in my skin started to grow and shrink and if I looked for more than 5 seconds I would already be an old man.&nbsp; I was way too happy to even really let this phase me but i had 2 more benadryl ready to go ( i could tell i was pretty clammy and felt like i may be breaking out a bit) so i swallowed those and made it outside with an Arizona Ice Tea.<br /><br />People say you aren&#039;t hungry when you trip but when i first started actually hallucinating I immediately had to eat, i found out in the morning i devoured almost 3/4 bag of pretzels and when i walked outside I couldn&#039;t really feel myself drinking the ice tea.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t a bad feeling but it just seemed like i was over hydrating so i threw that away.&nbsp; I spend the next few hours wandering around my house.&nbsp; I kept having different ideas of how to interact with nature.&nbsp; I wanted to look at EVERYTHING.&nbsp; I would of been happy to walk around my property for YEARS.&nbsp; If i looked at a crack it would start to warp and fractals would appear everywhere.&nbsp; I had the choice of riding our these fractals or moving onto look at something else.&nbsp; Throughout almost the ENTIRE trip i had 100% control of what I wanted to warp (maybe i didn&#039;t but i felt in control).&nbsp; At one point i realized that the sky looked AMAZING.&nbsp; Every star had a fractal pattern so the whole sky was just a geometric dome.&nbsp; I tried laying down in some grass but there were too many distractions.&nbsp; I HAD to get somewhere higher so i could just look into the sky.&nbsp; I ended up propping a plastic trashcan up next to my roof and trying to hoist myself up.&nbsp; I was laughing loudly this whole time as I knew I was basically doing the stereotypical media BS of (jumping off a cliff) etc…. and I knew if any of my non tripping friends saw me they would be cracking up.&nbsp; Eventually i made a sort of dive onto the roof and got stuck, i had to kind of roll off and it was the only scary part of the trip.&nbsp; In all honesty though I knew i couldn&#039;t seriously injure myself, and the risk of a few bruises was 100% worth just getting a clear view.&nbsp; <br /><br />Throughout the whole trip I really thought about my interactions with other people, about music, about how &quot;fake&quot; everything is and everything made a lot of sense.&nbsp; I was a bit stressed at trying to remember EVERYTHING and a bit frustrated that i wouldn&#039;t be able to explain to any of my close friends what i felt.<br /><br />Ill stop rambling but overall, this was the best experience of my life.&nbsp; I woke up in the morning with a completely clear mind.&nbsp; I was extremely motivated to take care of some errands/chores and got some important business out of the way.&nbsp; Although i plan on exploring psychedelics a TON more I don&#039;t have the addiction or need to trip again for a bit because all the benefits and things i learned in my trip carried into my life outside of the trip.<br /><br />Overall, 10/10 for what happened in my mind and a bit of a lesser rating for overall body feeling.&nbsp; All the muscle tension was a bit too much, although not unbearable by any means and I will definitely take something to ease that on my next journey.<br /><br /><br />I still don&#039;t know what setting I want to trip in next however, I feel that if i could share this experience with a few close friends itw old be magical but I felt angry that some people abuse such a beautiful drug like this and just use it to &quot;trip out&quot;.&nbsp; The psychological cleansing it provided me was absolutely beautiful and if I tripped with someone who i felt was abusing the drug as a &quot;party drug&quot; I would be quite irritated.<br /><br /><br /><br />After this experience I managed to convince a childhood friend of mine to come trip with me last weekend.&nbsp; He had no idea what he was getting himself into but trusted me enough to shove some 25i into his lip.&nbsp; <br /><br />Long story short, (ive already rambled A TON) his life COMPLETELY changed.&nbsp; Basically he went from what I consider a level 1 thinker and somehow who is REALLY influenced by media to somehow who is now interested in EVERYTHING about life and nature and ready to embrace anything that comes at him in life.<br /><br /><br />Now the last few weeks have been crazy for me, I am balancing my current life and business situations with honestly considering trying to become a huge trafficker of LSD.&nbsp; See, if I got caught for selling coke, meth, even marijuana I UNDERSTAND that is illegal and could face my punishments, argue my way out etc...&nbsp; But with psychedelics its so much different.&nbsp; Its mind fucking to me that this stuff is illegal and its SO obvious that a group of people on psychedelics is IMPOSSIBLE for government to control and its awful for capitalism.<br /><br />Hopefully this post has offered some insight to people and sorry for all the grammar errors etc.... just trying to get some thoughts out!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				Yea, I honestly had a bit of a thought/breakthrough while on 25i that it doesn&#039;t matter what psychedelic you take, because what you&#039;re thinking has nothing to do with the drug at all.&nbsp; Basically a psychedelic changes what you can physically see which then opens up your mind to all sorts of clear thinking etc...<br /><br />A really raw theory but hey, I came up with it on 25i so it must be true right?&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				I really hope this chemical might just kick start another cultural revolution , just like LSD in the 60s !<br /><br />A lot of young people in todays society need to really wake up because they are our best shot at smashing down the babylon we are living in , and maybe this cheap and freely available substance can help them do that !!

				I compltely understand the &quot;feeling incontrol of what warps&quot; kinda feeling.<br />I would walk around this giant feild, and think about something that would happen if I was tripping and then it happened.<br /><br />Was so damn weird and cool.<br />I convinced myself I wasn&#039;t tripping for so long.<br /><br />I felt the earth move beneath my feet, and the stars got a 3d effect, and this one star kept blinking at me, and I befriended it.<br />The footprints in the ground moved around, and under this yellow paint. These yellow lines moved off the ground, and the liquid ground flowed around.<br /><br />I started running, my legs were constantly annoying as fuck, I had to keep moving.<br />Couldn&#039;t stay tsill for long, I got so sick of that.<br />I remember the grass swaying and flowing.<br /><br />Next time I&#039;ll do 2mg, 1mg was a light trip.

				Hey WAR, awesome trip report.&nbsp; You&#039;ve definitely stirred up a desire in me to try these bad boys out!<br /><br />But I have a question for you:<br /><br />You stated this was one of your first psychedelic experiences, so why did you pop 2 tabs (I think the kwiktrips&#039; 25i is 550ug as opposed to duderugs&#039; 1000ug) instead of just taking one and &quot;researching&quot; from that point? <br /><br />In my experiences with new substances, taking the LEAST amount initially will usually prevent unwanted side effects, like &quot;hopping off of a roof&quot; LOL!<br /><br />Either way, looks like you had an great time!&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep up the good work!<br /><br />Omega<br /><br />

				HAHAHA, Thanks War for the +1....someone spanked me -1 for no apparent reason...Now I&#039;m at ZERO again YAY!<br /><br />Anyways, regarding dosing, you purchased from Kwiktrips and their 550ug product, do you think that had something to do with your &#039;upping&#039; the dose so radically?&nbsp; <br /><br />My understanding is that about 1000ug ( two tabs) will give you an approximate 8 hour trip, similar to LSD, but if you&#039;re now popping 5 (YES, ladies and gentlemen, he did say FIVE), will that take you and your trip into NEXT WEEK?<br /><br />Also, do you think there is any significant difference between the Kwiktrips product or the duderugs product, other than dosage?<br /><br />Thanks for the input!&nbsp; <br /><br />Omega<br />

				Am going to put in an order with Duderugs sometime this week so I will be able to add some comparisons to my massive NBOMe thread I am starting.&nbsp; Kwiktrips tabs were awesome, SUPER fast shipping however they aren&#039;t perforated or anything so it&#039;s hard for me to imagine that there&#039;s actually exactly 550ug on each 1/4 by 1/4 area.&nbsp; Also, to directly answer your question I don&#039;t think there will be any difference in the product except for dosage because 25i is a relatively cheap research chemical, unlike LSD sellers of this substance don&#039;t have much monetary benefit from lacing their 25i with any other product as they are already getting it pretty cheap.<br /><br />Supposedly adding more tabs makes you trip longer but all visuals end for me about 6 hours in and then my consciousness seems to close up after about 10 hours.&nbsp; What I mean by that is even after I stop seeing visuals I still feel like my mind is working really hard and I can feel my consciousness really aware of things around me.&nbsp; After about that 10 hour mark I am just having a decent afterglow and reminiscing on the trip.<br /><br />I do get some REALLY mild vasoconstriction from 25i (none of my friends who have tried it get any of this) but I DO plan on pushing the fuck out of myself at a festival with 25i in the upcoming month.&nbsp; From the research I have done it actually seems like partying/dancing on 25i may not be the BEST idea but when I am on 25i I feel really, really clean and healthy (did have some bad cramps on first trip but haven had any on any other trips, just a bit of leg muscle tension) so I am willing to take the risk and then report back to the community :)&nbsp;

				With duderugs, I really wanted to re-dose, because 1 hour in I kept thinking it wasn&#039;t working. 1.5-2 hours, I was like YEP IT&#039;S WORKING!<br />But I reallllly wanted to re-dose.<br /><br />Lasted only like 5 hours though. fell asleep...

				It&#039;s called ego loss.<br />Less normal on 25i NBOMe, but it happens a fair lot on psychedelics.<br /><br />I forget everything that I thought whilst on it, I only remember the visuals.

I wish there was a way of recalling those perfect moments of clarity about the world/universe/human nature - then you could re-evaluate the ideas in the morning. Anyone got some cool recording methods?<br /><br />So gonna go buy some of this stuff now :P

				Most people write them down, record them.<br />Though a lot of the time not all of them make sense in the morning, though generally it takes a long time of spread out trips to really analyize and evaluate all of your learning into your life.<br /><br />Very subtle and slow.
