				Placed an order for MDMA from a reliable vendor. The powder is pure white, smooth like flour and doesn&#039;t have an obvious smell. <br /><br />The vendor sells:<br /><br />MDMA<br />Coke<br />Ketamine<br />Mephedrone<br /><br />Previously their MDMA has been amber colored and smelt aniseed <br /><br />I&#039;ve emailed asking for their assistance in identifying what it could be. <br />

				Try a small line of it, describe what you feel.&nbsp; Those substances you said the vendor offers are different feelings.&nbsp; If the vendor sent the wrong drug to you, they&#039;ll hopefully do a reship or refund, but you&#039;re most likely stuck with what they first sent you.&nbsp; No need to trash it if its a good product.&nbsp; Lol

				Sounds like it could be either ketamine, coke, or meph.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t have an obvious smell, I would rule out meph.<br /><br />Wet your finger tip and place it in the bag, take a small amount of the substance and put it in your mouth. Does it have a numbing effect? If yes, then cocaine. If no, then it&#039;s probably ketamine.<br /><br />Is the substance &quot;fluffy&quot; so to speak?

				2 More questions<br /><br />1)Does the substance tend to stick together, (i.e clumpy, similar to amphetamine sulfates if you&#039;ve ever had it)<br />2) And was the substance extremely dry, or somewhat damp.<br />It may have already been addressed, but what does it smell like?<br /><br />And if you just add a tiny little (1-2mg) dab on your finger and place it in your mouth, it&#039;s not going to kill you.

				Here&#039;s what I would do.<br /><br />Gum just a little to see if it&#039;s Cocaine. If it doesn&#039;t numb, take a good 20mg line to start off with to see if you any effects. Wait several minutes before redosing until you hit that sweetspot. <br /><br />Does this look anything like the substance at hand?<br /><br />***********WARNING CLEARNET*********<br />http://www.freeads48.com/images/2013/06/15/8957/high-laboratory-grade-9998-mephedrone-mdpv-and-other-research-chemicals_1.jpg

				Ok so I&#039;ve tried some. Instantly the taste was like the smell you associate with really clean MDMA.

				Buy a reagent test and wait for the vendor to answer. Being patient never killed anyone. I read a report by a guy who thought he has 2CI and in ended up being NBOME and could have been killed by the dose he tried. Not worth losing your amazing life. Many drugs to experience but only one life (at least this incarnation of you). This is a drug safety thread so advice to dose mystery drugs is really not smart.

				So the vendor has been in touch and has confirmed that the mystery white powder is....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />MDMA. Apparently they blend it in a coffee grinder when they ship international and when you do that it turns white. <br /><br />Tried some and most def high quality Molly. <br /><br />There you have it everyone. Mystery solved.

Glad you found out what it really was though. :) Have fun.
