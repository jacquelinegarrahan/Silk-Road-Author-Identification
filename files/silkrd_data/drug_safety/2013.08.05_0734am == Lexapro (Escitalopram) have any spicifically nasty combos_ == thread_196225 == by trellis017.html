				Both SWIM&#039;s are shrinks (no, it wasn&#039;t that weird), and SWIM&#039;s been seeing shrinks for over half of SWIM&#039;s life.&nbsp; Yes, SWIM&#039;s fine, and normal.&nbsp; No, this isn&#039;t a cry for help.&nbsp; But my point being, SWIM&#039;s been on meds for a big chunk of SWIM&#039;s life and SWIM likes them and SWIM&#039;s a lot better of a person when SWIM&#039;s on them (socially, and morally), and SWIM&#039;s not going to stop. So I don&#039;t want to hear from you &quot;tell SWIY to get away from those nasty pharm-drugs that society is pressuring SWIY into taking&quot; or &quot;shrinks are useless&quot; etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I would like is to know if there are any specific recreational drugs that will effect SWIM differently now that SWIM is on it?&nbsp; SWIM used Celexa (Citalopram) for about a year and subsequently Wellbutrin (Bupropion) for about 3 years.&nbsp; They switched to Lexapro very recently because the Wellbutrin was contributing to their anxiety, whereas SSRI&#039;s are frequently prescribed *for* anxiety.<br /><br />According to SWIM, there were minor combo effects with Celexa and alcohol (they learned that first-hand that they would get sick a couple of drinks sooner than without), and, due to their own google searching, SWIM was too afraid to try MDMA because they thought it might render the Celexa&#039;s effectiveness might wane from their emotions being tugged at back and forth too often.&nbsp; If there wre effects with Wellbutrin, they were so negligible that SWIM didn&#039;t notice them.<br /><br />So: Lexapro?&nbsp; Is there anything that, when SWIM takes it, will not cause they same effects as without the Lex?<br /><br />SWIM is madly in love with oxycodone, hydrocodone, Xanax (alprazolam), and recreationally enjoys/finds useful Adderal, ambien, and shrooms. <br /><br />SWIM is an alcoholic and had trouble with pot-addiction and attends AA and MA regularly, and obviously does not smoke pot or drink, at all.&nbsp; SWIM doesn&#039;t want to be lectured on how they are high-risk for developing new addictions.<br /><br />SWIM also smokes between 15-30 cigarettes (0.75 - 1.5 packs) a day.<br /><br />Thanks for your help!&nbsp; SWIM also says thanks.&nbsp; ;)
