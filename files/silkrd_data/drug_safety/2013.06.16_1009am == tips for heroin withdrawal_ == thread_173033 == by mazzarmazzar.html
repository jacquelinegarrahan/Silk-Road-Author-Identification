				Hey guys,<br /><br />I recently over did it with H and am about to go into withdrawal all be it on a mild scale<br /><br />However any one got any tips that helped them other than diazepam? This is just as I have work and need to keep it at bay for 8 hours for a couple of days.<br /><br />Thanks

				If you can get codeine tablets, that may help especially if you think it will be mild.&nbsp; Kratom will help as well, it has saved my ass at work a few times.

				I did opiates for years. never heroin though.. Just tried that lately... <br /><br /><br />If you can get your hands on buprenorphine it has an extremely long half life to keep you from withdraw.<br /><br />Clonidine is another one that helps with some of the symptoms of withdrawal.&nbsp;

				Loperamide can apparently help ease your withdrawals. You will have to taper off them tho as loperamide is an opiate in itself, you just can&#039;t get off o nit cos it doesn&#039;t cross the brain blood barrier.&nbsp; Search the clearweb, I don&#039;t know about dosages.<br /><br />If you have diazepam, you have the best thing IMo. If it&#039;s a small habit and your first just sweat it out and don&#039;t go back. I&#039;ve been quitting for 15 years...<br />Some sleeping pills may help, also weed if it doesn&#039;t make you anxious and nauseous.

				How long have you been using ? if you want to end them fast go to work out/ run as soon as you can. Just laying just prolongs the withdrawals. At least for me on milds on day 3 after working out and taking a shower i felt so refreshed :).
