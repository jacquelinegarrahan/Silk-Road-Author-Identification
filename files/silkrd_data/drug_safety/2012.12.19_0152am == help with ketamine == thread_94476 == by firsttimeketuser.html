				i&#039;ve seen it in both shardy crystal and also salt-like. both were good, so it&#039;s not really a good indicator.<br /><br />best bet would be to do a small bump and see how you feel. i would smoke a fat bowl first and do a bump because it&#039;s very subtle and you might not feel it if you&#039;re sober, but doing it while high will definitely amplify things.

				The K that I carry taste like salt ( to me anyway)<br /><br />Do not rule it out as fake. More then likely it is indeed legit. Should always have a test/be able to test anything you are weary of.<br />

				i dunno what they teach you kids these days but Mr. Wizard and Bill Nye the Science Guy taught us that salt crystals have a cubic structure...look at the grains of your K...do they look like tiny cubes?<br /><br />also good K (like the kind that comes from a freshly cooked bottle of Ketaset) always tastes bitter to me...

				Man the shit tastes down right NASTY, like xanax or metal infused with alien shit. Do a bump man, sober or not, youll feel it. It will feel like you had a shot or two at first, then begin to slow motor skills . Good luck friend

				K has such a strong taste, you can&#039;t mistake it for anything else. That and because it is an anesthetic you could just hold it in your mouth for 5-10 minutes, after that you will know if it&#039;s K or not IF you have read up on it&#039;s main physical effect(numbness(which you should have read up on it, if not do it now!)). I do know that some people refer to a chemical taste as being &quot;salty&quot;.<br />&nbsp;Ketamine can come in shard&#039;s if it was just evaporated from vials, or it can come in small salt cube-like form if it is straight from the facility they made it in, as in BEFORE they put the ketamine into a vial. If I were you I would start off small though , don&#039;t want to start with a K-hole from snorting or eating it, will last forever. Maybe after trying it out and getting a feel for it THEN you should try to hole. Its the best thing in the world and is really the only way to get the true extraordinary effects of it.(I do it intravenously so it may be different orally)&nbsp; <br />Ketamine is my FAVORITE drug and I have done almost all of the mainstream ones(well I have tried, not done habitually). It is a life changing experience, it&#039;s something we do not fully understand yet and is just now really being looked at for treatment of depression, people who are bi-polar, and for cessation of substances. There is even experimental studies that have been done on K for pain management. They basically put some one who is in extreme pain(as in wanting to kill yourself pain) into a coma with ketamine, keep them on life support for a couple days, then wake them up and they are pain free. It&#039;s almost like re-booting your brain. In that process they use more ketamine then that hospital would use in a year for anaesthesia, it&#039;s absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Hope this is some information that is either intriguing or useful. Have fun and be safe.<br /><br />DON&quot;T TAKE WITH BENZO&#039;S, it reduces the hallucinogenic and soem &quot;feel good&quot; effects and will make you sleepy, that&#039;s why they give you a benzo with it in the hospital.<br /><br />Hope this information is either intriguing or useful. Have fun and be safe.

				Ketamine fucks ya man. I just snorted a little bit and am fucked man. Not sure what to make of it though now I am recovering and it seems that no harm has been done. Though my keybord looks a little shiny:)<br />Been smoking some weed as well though and had a tiny line of coke about an hour before the K.<br /><br />Try just a little at first to judge seems to be the advise, then if you fancy a K hole do a bigger line. I did not fancy the k-hole today , but some time I might. (when my stomach is not as queasy as it is today).<br /><br />I was for an hour or two more fucked than I would of been off tipsy drunk or stoned,&nbsp; but the mental clarity was still there (albeit with a occasional few seconds of confusion).<br /><br />It would be highly dangerous to drive on this I reckon.

				Yeah, mine looked and tasted like salt. <br />Make sure that you crush it up to a fine powder before you snort it.&nbsp; eg. between some paper with a lighter on a hard surface . Just crush a bit at a time if you only need a bit.

				It tastes like a slightly metallic salt.<br /><br />Even very granular k is going to have more of a shard look to it than table salt. Table salt is very cubic in its crystalline structure. Powdery but sparkly means it&#039;s still crystalline, just that the crystals are very small.<br /><br />Read the reviews for the vendor on these forums (use the search function, and also check the general ketamine vendor review thread). I would doubt any K vendor here would ship table salt to try to scam someone! Hell, I&#039;d personally just go ahead and snort 25mg and wait to feel something.<br /><br />Enjoy ketamine!

				If you&#039;re not willing to pay for a test kit, the only way you&#039;re gonna know is to try it.&nbsp; My best advice to people who have never done K before is to start off slow though.&nbsp; IMO it&#039;s one of those drugs that sneaks up on you quick.&nbsp; You&#039;ll take a bump and not feel anything, then another and feel it, then another and be real high but still coherent, then that last final bump that was a quarter of the size of the one before it has you on the floor puking rainbows and unable to move lol.<br /><br />Also, be careful of the dreaded &quot;secret surprise&quot; crystal that gets stuck in your nasal cavity only to be snorted unknowingly 30min later.&nbsp; Multiple times I&#039;ve gotten to a comfortable high, only to get put on my ass later in the night when I casually sniffle lol.
