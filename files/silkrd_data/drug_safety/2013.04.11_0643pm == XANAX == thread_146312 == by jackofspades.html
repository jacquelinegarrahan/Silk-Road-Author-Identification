				*XANAX* <br />everything you wanted to know but were to afraid to ask.<br /><br />I love the fact that so many vendors have sooo many of these and at a decent price too!<br />Does anyone else move these things faster than you can get them?!<br />I literally move around 100 a day. <br />Curious as to anyone else s street prices as well.<br />Anyway, i have started using them now and then (im giving up weed)<br />but are there any dangers with it? i.e. overdose or getting a faulty product.<br />Where do these massive amounts come from anyway? Are there labs out there producing them under the radar for next to nothing?<br />Or do a few people just break into a Xanax supply depot and then take a walk on the road with them haha.<br /><br />Just a general everything-Xanax-thread<br />

				Just wanna to tell you one thing.<br /><br />You do not want to experience Xanax Withdrawal Syndromes. I had it once, 5 days&nbsp; no sleep at all, hallucinations, sound disturbance. Only thing can save U is another dosage of Xanax changing to long acting benzos like Clonazepam or Diazepam, or - in my case - GBL. Withdrawal syndromes seems&nbsp; to appeared about 3 days after last dosage. Three days before a storm.

				It is hard to overdose on alprazolam.&nbsp; You build quite a tolerance for them.&nbsp; I have taken 30 2mg bars.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t pretty.&nbsp; Mixing with oxycodone or opiates in general can prove fatal for some people.&nbsp; Mixing with alcohol can be lethal for others.&nbsp; Personally I wont drink unless I&#039;m on benzos.

				xanax withdraw sucks. oneiroi must of not had that bad of an addiction. Usually takes me about 30 days before I can sleep normal again. That was after I have been taking only 1 mg at night to help me sleep for about 3 months. The thing about Xanax, They feel great when you haven&#039;t taken them for a while. But after a while, you just take them to feel normal. It also gives you rebound anxiety. If you have anxiety it only gets worse when you stop taking it.

				I haven&#039;t done any quite a while though. I keep reminding myself how hard it is to ween yourself off them. Plus I lose my license for 5 yrs and prolly get mandatory jail time if I get another DUI. DUI bullshit really sucks !...Xanax can really get you in trouble.

				This may be a dumb question but how do you consume or sell benzo powder?<br /><br />Do you just divide it up into doses like with other powder drugs? The bars are so convenient and easy but if you can really save that much if bought in powder form then id consider it but can someone shed some light hahah. TY

				What dosage of Xanax gets you high? I have a prescription for them that&#039;s a $5 copay for a 60 day supply, 1mg tablets... I take one when I&#039;m going to be in an intense social situation (I have very high levels of social anxiety) but it doesn&#039;t get me high so much as docile.<br /><br />What are the doses people are taking to get high off it o.0?

				Benzos are most enjoyable and Alprazolam is one of my favorite. Zolpidem has very interesting effects on me and because of its half life, I prefer it over Alprozolam.<br /><br />I always knew this the use of these drugs can become habitual very easily and a close friend of mine game me some anecdotes on his use in the past.<br /><br />I created an Excel spreadsheet detailing my Benzo intake, I suggest anyone taking these do the same. It is very easy for your body to become dependent on it and before you know it, you&#039;d have to start weaning yourself off them which can be a more daunting experience than weaning yourself off heroin it has been said, eek!<br /><br />I give myself many breaks, at times for up to three weeks at a time just to be sure I have no withdrawal or dependency. Use these drugs wisely! I found the following link very useful information regarding Benzos <br /><br />http://benzo.org.uk/
