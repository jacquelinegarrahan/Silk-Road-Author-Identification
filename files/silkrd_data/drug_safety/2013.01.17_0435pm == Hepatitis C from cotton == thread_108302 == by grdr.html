				Hello so here&#039;s what happened today: I wanted to get high very much because I was sober over a week and did not have any drugs and only drug which would be worth some bang for a buck is amphetamine+methamphetamine(crank). So I bought half a gram smelled it and the smell was o previously very good crank I had so I was confident that I&#039;ll get high. I put the powder in a spoon (clean) and put water on it. When I poured water&nbsp; from a new syringe ( I never share anything with anyone) I noticed some bigger chunk. Did not think much of it at first so I shake the solution there&#039;s plenty leftover since it&#039;s very dirty meth so I heated abit and burned off some by accident. Well I put in new cotton and sucked liquid up it was clear. Injected IV got a very very mild and short rush barely feelable my eyes did not dilute too. Well i thought i need to dissolve that chunk added some more water and started rubbing it with a plunger and I realised it was cotton. I bought this&nbsp; from junkies I know they use heroin but don&#039;t use meth ( I only did not buy heroin because there&#039;s a higher chance they would try to short me or screw me over and I couldn&#039;t do anything about it because it&#039;s a&nbsp; dangerous place where I score and I know they have diseases HEP C for sure and maybe HIV so I&#039;m not keen to get into fight because I&#039;m afraid they could stick me with a needle or stab me). Well I don&#039;t know what to think I always practised safe drug use but here&#039;s one stupid mistake and I probably am HEP C positive and maybe some other nasty diseases. I threw the rest out don&#039;t want to use any drugs now at all. I don&#039;t know if it was used though all I know is that powder was stuck on that cotton I mean why would anyone put cotton in a plastic baggie full of powder. It wasn&#039;t rolled into a ball too so I still have some hope but the chances is very high i&#039;m infected if it was used.

I&#039;ve seen a heroin addict in some documentary (can&#039;t remember which one) sharing needles with his buddy, who he knew had Hep C, multiple times without becoming infected. And with a tiny piece of cotton the probability is considerably lower.<br />Also, Hep C can&#039;t survive outside the body for more than four days.<br />Virus particles (HCV RNA) can be detected after one to two weeks and Hep C antibodies can be detected after three to twelve weeks.<br /><br />There is nothing you can do about your situation right now so calm down and take measures when the time comes.<br />Good luck.

				Do get tested if you are in any doubt though. While there is an excellent vaccine against hep a and b (twinrix) there is none that completely protects agtainst hep c. Hep c is not all that virulent, but if you were to be infected it would be best to take action as soon as possible.

You can get hep c from sharing the same water, cotton, needle, spoon.. And alcohol doesn&#039;t even kill it.<br />With that being said, rather Hepatitis c that HIV/AIDS. It really isn&#039;t all that bad, as long as you take care of yourself.. But I understand nobody wants an incurable disease in the first place.

				Hi firstly mate I am sorry at what you have gone through. Firstly your chance of getting HIV from the cotton is 0% HIV is only transmitted from fresh blood to fresh blood it wont live in the open air . Secondly there have been alot of recorded incidences of people getting HEP C through using filters spoons etc as @H said this is because the&nbsp; HEP C virus is minute and can live outside the body in dried blood for upto 6 weeks&nbsp; . I would definately get tested. There are several tests which can be done depending on the test will depend how long it takes to get the result.

Can&#039;t believe what scum some addict are I helped them out with heroin like a week (sold for less than i bought) before asking to help me get some speed. I don&#039;t know what happened to me and why I let these addicts treat me like this.

				Just get tested for it - the whole story is just too vague exclude infection. The chances aren&#039;t terribly large at all, but if you managed to get a hep c infection its important to get proper treatment for that. While hep c is a disease that is very difficult to cure completely, with medication it is manageable and you could live out a normal lifespan.<br /><br />Things like briefly boiling a substance before injection are NOT a foolproof way to kill the hep c virus. It does reduce the chance of transmission surely, but the concept that quickly boiling something will kill all viruses in it is just wrong.

I&#039;m not stupid I learned all possible ways of getting HEP C and HIV before even trying heroin. In fact I&#039;m the one who gives advice for new people who have questions how to protect themselves but the irony is that that cotton looked like a chunk of powder or else i would have thrown out that garbage. I haven&#039;t been tested yet but I will definetely update on results here because I&#039;m not one of those people who tends to leave you hanging (unless something happens to me). But to tell you the truth I basically don&#039;t care about it in fact it&#039;s funny I might even get a bonus - HI-fuckin-V. I just feel bad that I don&#039;t feel angry at the guy who sold me that bag. I&#039;m nearly 21 years old and I&#039;m a vegetable i don&#039;t have any feelings and don&#039;t care about life at all in fact I&#039;m suicidal (no emo cutting wrists or something I&#039;m serious) but I have mentality now that you have to live no matter how much pain you experience I just feel numb and like I&#039;m dying inside. Even if I have HEP C I probably won&#039;t get treatment because I heard medications cost alot and you feel very sick from them. Well I&#039;ll update when I get tested.

				Go and get tested anyway, even if you don&#039;t care about what happens to you. <br /><br />Like HIV, hep c is also a sexually transmitted disease, and you can carry it for a long time without having any symptoms yourself. This does not mean that you will not infect other however. <br /><br />Also, its not a nice way to die really. It will impair your liver function to the point where you build up poisons in your system usually resulting in a rather slow and unpleasant death. While hiv may leave you vulnerable to other infections that can be fatal pretty quickly, hepatits doesn&#039;t show that bit of mercy. <br /><br />Testing for it is not expensive at all, so at least do that. If you turn out to be infected you still have the choice between expensive treatment, letting in take its course, or ending your own life - being informed is paramount to make that choice in any case.

				Get tested but time kills hep c. Also bleach does not kill hep c. I know this from contracting it after thinking it would, and having your own needles is a lot better than going through interferon treatment for 6 months.
