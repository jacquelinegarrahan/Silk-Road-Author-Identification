				DMT, 2c-b yeah.... or 2c-e . <br />or Mescaline! Salvia?<br />Depends on what you want to do while on it. Meditate? Party? Socialize? Alone?<br />

				15-20mg of 2-CB is a good, social dose.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t drive on it, but it&#039;s very clear-headed at the 15-20mg mark.&nbsp;

				So 2CB is pretty dandy but I would say it&#039;s not necessarily a &quot;fun&quot; drug on it&#039;s own. Nice mild body high at low doses, good visuals at higher doses, but your mind stays pretty well grounded to the real world rather then flying off to some happy place if that makes sense. Mixing 2CB with stuff like pot or taking it at the tail end of an MDMA roll really helps the stuff shine, otherwise it&#039;s similar to putting on a pair of hallucinogenic goggles through which your mostly sober mind needs to navigate.<br /><br />As mentioned above, I&#039;m a huge fan of MDA if you want something similar to MDMA but just a little different. MDA can be pretty visual, still has an amazing body high, still lets you blather on endlessly about how much you love everyone and everything, but definitely different than MDMA. <br /><br />For a good one two three punch grab a little MDMA, bump with a touch of MDA at the peak of the roll and then come down with some 2CB at the end of that roll. Will keep you going a good long time and transition you into some visual fun.
