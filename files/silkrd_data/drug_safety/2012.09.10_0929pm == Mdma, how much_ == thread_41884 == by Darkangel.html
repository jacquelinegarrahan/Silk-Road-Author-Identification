				Ok here&#039;s the deal, ordered some of Supertrips md and I&#039;m unsure how much to take for an event in a few weeks time. Before you give the standard answers I&#039;d just like to say I&#039;ve taken it 5 times previously with a 330mg each time of (what I was assured to be good quality stuff from Essex). The waits each time were as follows: First time,2weeks later,2 weeks later,6 weeks later,5 weeks later.<br /><br />It will have been 4months since last dropping + SR quality md. Want to have a good time which will hopefully blow all other times out the water so tell me how much is a reasonable amount to take + redose (want to be going for a while)<br /><br />Cheers for any answers!

				330mg is way too much to drop at once.&nbsp; Especially ST&#039;s stuff.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be VERY overwhelmed if you do that! ;)<br /><br />I would recommend 150mg bumped by 100mg at ~ T+1:30. <br /><br />Of course this depends on your body build and chemistry but that should have you feeling GREAT!&nbsp; Eye wiggles and all.

So 150mg followed by a 100mg booster sounds perfect for the level you&#039;re wanting to be at. :D

				Yeah, not to belabor the point but I&#039;m with the other posters, OP. The standard answers are good to follow for a reason. 330mg is seriously going to fuck you up. Even with a more tolerant baseline physiology, 330 is simply going to fry your serotonin so quick. 150-200 with a redose of 1/3-1/2 2 hours later is about max in my opinion. Anything more than that and you&#039;re just taking it for the meth effects because your brain won&#039;t have anymore serotonin to give. <br /><br />Cheers and be safe!

				Cheers guys, well aware I&#039;ve taken too much guess its partly my fault for lack of research before hand, combined with the fact the time I waited 6 weeks I actually did a 250mg and didn&#039;t get the body high effects that I love so upped it again to 330mg (worst roll yet setting really does help). Guy who got us trying mdma has been doing it for 5 years and does it pretty much weekly with a tolerance break every now and then yet still manages to go through 1.5g&nbsp; on a standard night (fucked I know). <br /><br />Anyway thanks again provided it arrives will try out 150mg with a 75mg redose 90minutes later!

				I think timing depends on yourself. I like boosting as I am still coming up but mates like to peak and boost after the peak starts to wear off.<br /><br />Also, only take the 1 boost. Its easy to get home or to another club and take another 100mg but you dont get much out of it other than a much shorter relaxed feeling.
