				I don&#039;t know if anyone else has looked into this, but as a chronic pain patient, I had major issues with my tolerance and the ever increasing amount of meds I had to take to keep my pain under control.<br />After some searching around, I found out about this stuff you can get from the Vitamin Shoppe called &quot;Ashwagandha&quot;. When I bought it, it cost between $13 and $21 USD.<br />According to studies, it decreases opioid tolerance.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9292416?dopt=Abstract<br /><br />And here is a very in depth article on the stuff.<br />http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2006/jun2006_report_ashwa_01.htm<br /><br />I have been taking the stuff for five weeks, with a two week break from the narcotics.<br /><br />Week one:<br />Narcotics and the Ashwagandha&nbsp; (two 400mg two - three times a day)&nbsp; - no noticable change<br /><br />Week two:<br />Narcotics and the Ashwagandha&nbsp; (two 400mg two - three times a day)&nbsp; - small noticable change (i think... its hard to tell)<br /><br />Week three:<br />Just ashwagandha (two 400mg two - three times a day) <br /><br />Week four:<br />just ashwagandha&nbsp; (two 400mg two - three times a day) <br /><br />Week five:<br />back on the narcotics, and the ashwagandha with a lower dose of the narcotics and a noticable ease in the effectiveness of the pain medication. Not a normal two week break feeling at all. It seemed like I was detoxed for a few months.<br /><br /><br />The way I figure it, and I could be wrong, is if I continue with the ashwagandha and the medications (not taken at the same time for fear of complete sedation), I could take my medication at smaller, more regular doses for the best possible pain relief.<br /><br />I hope this helps

				This is interesting. They are always trying to find ways to lower tolerance. One thing that helped me was methadone. A small dose of methadone mixed in with my regular pain killers basically stopped me from having to increase every&nbsp; 6 months or so. But, Im going to look into your little find..

				One word: Dextromorph<br /><br />Meaning: combining dextromethorphane and opioids (shouldn&#039;t work with codeine though due to desmethylation and C6G) to potentiate them and control tolerance. Google it.
