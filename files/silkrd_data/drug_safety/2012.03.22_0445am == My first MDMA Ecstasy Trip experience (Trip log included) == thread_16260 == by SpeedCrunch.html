So I spent about 3 weeks reading various drug related forums and wikis and found a good amount of information.<br /><br />So with that said armed with 3 weeks worth of research I then proceeded to buy 5x Defqon pills 170mg (isn&#039;t it great that you can buy anything and everything when you want to off Silkroad? lol.)<br /><br />My main reason for wanting to try Ecstasy is to eventuality try out candy flipping. I seriously wanted to try candy flipping first but common sense and sound judgement kept telling me to try Ecstasy on it&#039;s own first to gauge its effects and I must say I was not left disappointed :D <br /><br />I must say this has been by far the most fun that I have ever had in a very long time. :D <br /><br />Before I post the log below I just just want to give you a bit of a WARNING: This log is a very long read be prepared for that lol..I was very emotional and filled with joy when writing this log and as a result this log is very long and detailed. I would also like to add that after reading my log sober I can say with 100% certainty that I agree with everything that I said in my log. My whole reason for posting thees logs is to give people better insight into drug effects with the main goal of promoting drug safety and use.<br /><br />Also I would like to add that I have a few questions in my log about my trip experience if any experienced Ecstasy trippers out there have any spare time on their hands to read my log. I would love to hear some feedback about my log as I have a lot of questions in it that I could use help with.<br /><br />With that said I sincerely hope that people find my trip logs useful and I hope it provides some good insights into the effects and use of Ecstasy.<br /><br />Enjoy! :D<br /><br />[MY FRIST MDMA Ecstasy Trip+Log experience] 21/3/2012<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[MY FRIST MDMA Ecstasy Trip+Log experience] 21/3/2012<br /><br />Pill taken red defqon 170-180 mg<br /><br />00:41 Took half a tablet so if the pill is 170mg total then I should have 85+- in my system (Note I had to bite the pill to cut it in half lol. It tasted awful lmao)<br /><br />01:05 Just to update just listening to Sonny and Cher (Album: Look at Us) just relaxing<br /><br />01:17 starting to feel a slight tingling sensation over my body.<br /><br />01:24 Starting to feel a rush of energy now. I want to dance to the beat.<br /><br />01:37 It might just be me but time seems to be slowing down or rather I am loosing track of time. The only thing helping me keep track of time is my log.<br /><br />0:43 My sense of touch is heightened everything is so smooth! rubbing things across my face feels so good. I have a slight sense of euphoria and calm.<br /><br />0:47 I am so fucking relaxed. It&#039;s like 6 months worth of psychotherapy sessions in 1 hour lol.<br /><br />2:07 Just to update I just took a piss and it felt so good. Also had a chance to look in the mirror and my pupils are the size of saucers lmao.<br /><br />2:10 Another update just took the other half of the pill so in theory I should have about 170-180mg in my system. I must say I fell so profoundly calm it&#039;s almost insane. It&#039;s like a great inner peace.<br /><br />2:12 going to listen to more music.<br /><br />2:17 just to update I am listening to more sonny and cher and hugging my childhood toy(he&#039;s like a little plush teddy bear) I feel so happy and content with life.<br /><br />2:20 holy shit I feel so light as a feather like I could just float away from my body. Like I could jump and just float away. Going to stop logging for a bit and enjoy this.<br /><br />2:26 I am so happy I almost want to cry. P.S I love all you guys @ Silkroad<br /><br />2:28 everything feels so smooth music/touch<br /><br />2:39 just to update still hugging my teddy bear and listening to music so HAPPY! (Listening to The Beatles (16 CD Box Set)<br /><br />2:47 I just noticed that I am so happy that I was crying I feel so good and happy I just want to cry more tears or joy I feel so light in weight.<br /><br />3:00 just want to update This is so fucking awesome. I am so calm and relaxed music is so good. I just hope I don&#039;t feel like shit in the morning lol. But right now the moment is so perfect.<br /><br />3:04 Ecstasy is like reliving the best moments of your childhood or the best moments of any point in your life. I am so happy that I cant put it in words a log just cant tell you how happy I am<br /><br />3:12 I just noticed everything is so shiny plus I feel like I could just jump up in the air and touch heaven. Hmm I fell a bit colder might just be my fan.<br /><br />3:20 It&#039;s starting to hit me hard now I fell detached from my body. Like I no longer have a connection to my physical body. It&#039;s like an ocean of greatness. It&#039;s like it comes in waves. Wave after wave.<br /><br />3:26 I am in a sate of very deep relaxation also it&#039;s getting harder to type this log. life is great. P.S I do feel colder I may turn my fan off. also still listening to The Beatles (16 CD Box Set)<br /><br />3:31 another update still hugging my teddy bear.<br /><br />03:38 Feel very cold this might be the comedown still feel good though. P.S Been drinking a glass of water about every hour and a half to stay hydrated. <br />I haven&#039;t been dancing so dehydration shouldn&#039;t be an issue for me.<br /><br />3:51 Hmmm I think I got some eye wiggles it&#039;s a little hard to focus on some things.<br /><br />3:53 Just to update going take a piss and get another glass of water. This will be my third glass of water since the start of the trip. P.S I feel slightly confused.<br /><br />4:03 Ok peoples just want to update you I got my glass of water. <br />When I was taking a piss I noticed some jaw clenching and I looked in the mirror and all I can see in my eye&#039;s are black dilated pupils even more so then when I been on lsd if I can remember.<br /><br />4:06 Also another update I feel so fucking cold...I wonder if this is a a part of the coming down effects. I still feel good but I could do without the cold.<br /><br />4:12 ok enough logging I am going to go back to my The Beatles (16 CD Box Set) <br />P.S sometime I have slight confusion like trying to find my headphones when there plainly on my desk in front of me. <br />Anyway going to go back to music now and hugging my childhood teddy bear I love all you guys at silkroad I hope people find this log useful.<br /><br />4:14 I just wanted to update and give a general statement about my trip logs and what I am trying to achieve with them.<br /><br />4:21[My Statement]<br />One of the reasons behind my trip logs is to give people insight and to help them decide if this drug is right for them. They can look at my logs and then decide for themselves.<br /><br />Also I would like some input from experienced MDMA(Ecstasy) trippers and see if there is any advice that they can give me. <br />My logs are a two way street they give people insight in the drug and the logs allow experienced trippers to give me any advice and insight about my trip experience for example I would like to know why I fell so fucking cold lol. <br />I suspect an experienced tripper will give me the answer to that question when I post this log<br /><br />4:26 Right going to stop logging a bit and go back to music. grrr stupid jaw clenching and eye wiggles lol<br /><br />4:34 Just ate a gummy and it was so good and it&#039;s strange I love the texture of the gummy on my tongue it feels so good on my tongue. <br />Also just wanted to say still listening to The Beatles (16 CD Box Set) God there&#039;s a shit load of songs lol but The Beatles sounds so so fucking awesome when on ecstasy. You have got to try this shit<br /><br />4:37 Right I think I am over logging going to shut the fuck up now and go back to music P.S This is the most fun I have had in a long fucking time. Back to hugging my childhood Teddy Bear.<br /><br />4:38 I love all you good people @ Silkroad I also want to give credit to Dread Pirate Roberts for making all this possible you are an inspiration. With out SR I would not have access to any of this.<br /><br />With that said I want to contribute what I can to the SilkRoad community.<br />&nbsp;It&#039;s my sincere hope that my trip logs can in some way contribute to the community It&#039;s the only thing that I think I can do to contribute to the community and help people. I want to give something back.<br /><br />4:45 Ok for the last time again going to go back to music and hugging my childhood teddy bear.<br /><br />4:47 Whoa just spilled water all over self lol. At least I got another glass of water in the room 4 glass now I should be doing ok on hydration I haven&#039;t been dancing so water is not such a concern for me.<br />[SAFETY NOTE] From what I have been reading online if your on Ecstasy and doing a shit load of dancing you should be drinking ONE bottle/glass per hour no more no less. Over-hydration is just as bad as dehydration AKA to much water can give you over-hydration (Water intoxication) and kill you :/. But lets try to avoid that yeah<br /><br />4:55 Anyway for the last fucking time going back to music and hugging my childhood teddy bear. <br />P.S just wanted to say I am no expert in Ecstasy usage my log can give some good insight into a first Ecstasy trip and you can ask me any question that you want about any part of my trip (Just shoot me a PM if you want to talk privately). <br />But what I am trying to say is that if you want professional advice ask an experienced Ecstasy tripper who has tripped 40+ times and as always do you research before doing any drug. I did about 3 weeks of research before I started this trip and I must say Ecstasy is by far the most fun drug that I have ever used. The only thing I am wondering now is how am I going to feel in the morning with depleted serotonin levels. But with that said I will be adding how I feel in the morning/Or when I wake up to this log. So in short I will log the effects of day after trip.<br /><br />5:08 Right again! for the last! fucking! Time! going to go back to The Beatles (16 CD Box Set) and my childhood teddy bear. <br />P.S again I love all you people at SilkRoad and I give my undying respect for Dread Pirate Roberts for without I would of never has access to any of the things I do now. <br />My mind and body feels liberated I just wish I could contribute more I hope to be able to do more for SilkRoad in the future<br /><br />05:14 OMG RIGHT Fucking again back to Beatles (16 CD Box Set) and my childhood teddy bear..........just going to shut the fuck now (I think we can all be happy about that<br /><br />05:17 Just want to add Ecstasy has given me a fuck load of inspiration even more inspiration then when I been doing acid. I fell like I have touched the heavens and danced with angels and it&#039;s beautiful. I have seen and been to the outer reaches of heaven and returned to my body<br /><br />5:20 right last time again music and teddy bear lol.............I will get back to it P.S still got jaw clenching (Any advice on helping with that?)Experienced trippers care to comment?<br /><br />05:36 Another thing I forgot to add is for the past 2 hours I have been feeling tired not tried as I think I will I am going to pass out. <br />Just feeling tired and very deeply relaxed. Think I got more jaw clenching now starting notice it more. <br />Right again for the last fucking time again back to music + childhood teddy bear P.S this has to be the coming down part I think also I started chewing on gummy bears to help with the jaw clenching (Experienced trippers care to comment please I could use your valuable input thanks)<br /><br />5:41 talking to friends on msn there off to work in a few minutes this morning and all I can think is thank God I have 3 days off<br /><br />5:43 Just to let you people know if your tripping on Ecstasy at home then you got to download and play the The Beatles (16 CD Set) Search usenet/torrent/ none tech savvy user? or don&#039;t like the idea of pirating music? Just buy the box set google is your friend.<br /><br />5:47 Right lets see if I can get back to music + childhood teddy bear for the 900th time <br />(I hope this log isn&#039;t annoying anyone I am doing this shit to try to help other people and myself with drug education and safety. I sincerely hope that my logs will Educate and possibility prevent bad trips Harmful accidents and possibility even death)<br /><br />05:55 I want to become a Advocate of drug safety and use. <br />People are going to use drugs that is an inescapable fact so if there going to use drugs then best we can do is make sure people do drugs as safely as possible with maximum harm reduction. <br />This is one of the primary goals that I wish to achieve in life. I want the users of Silkroad to be educated in the drug there using before they try it. <br />Because taking something without first doing proper research can = Bad Trips or death or if you very lucky you may be ok. <br /><br />What I am trying to say is I wish to contribute because I sincerely feel in my heart that Silkroad has opened an entire new world to me and it&#039;s filled with wonders small beautiful wonders I have touched heaven and returned to my body.<br /><br />6:24 Talking to family on msn I fell good I think it&#039;s starting a fad a little bit now but I still love the music. Still listening to the The Beatles (16 CD Set) lmao not even through 50% of the tracks yet.<br /><br /><br />6:36 Another Update! Just took a piss and it felt good. Looked in the mirror and my pupils still look the size of flying saucers (I must still be high lol <br />Also just to update got another glass of water so that should be 5 glass of water now. 6+ hours for 5 glasses of water not bad considering I have not been doing any heavy dancing.<br /><br />[SAFETY NOTE: If your doing heavy dancing on Ecstasy you should take a break about every 45-60 min and drink 1 bottle/glass per hour NO MORE NO LESS to much or to less can kill you AKA dehydration and over-hydration (Water intoxication)...Yes to much water can kill you in any situation especially when using Ecstasy as I have found it&#039;s easy to lose track of time]<br /><br />The only reason my water intake is accurate is because I have been using my Log as a time reference.<br />For other people I think your best bet might be a mobile phone alarm if in a rave. <br />If your at home use an alarm clock or better yet have an experienced tripper buddy with you who can recognize when you need help and let you know when you need to sit down for a few minutes and take a drink of water.<br /><br />7:08 UPDATE: I think it&#039;s starting to wear off now but I still love the music more then I did. Plus I wanted to add I feel slightly dehydrated and my throat is dry. <br />I can only imagine what it would be like 6+ hours on the dance floor. Lol Hell it could be a good way to lose weight lmao.<br /><br />7:58 END OF TRIP UPDATE: About 7+ hours since I started this trip and I have come down a good bit music still sounds good but I am very tired also noticed that my pupils are still slightly dilated but nowhere near as dilated as before. <br />Just going to listen to some music then go to bed soon. <br /><br />When I wake up I will update my log about how I feel and any after effects that I may be feeling. Before I go to bed I just wanted to share something with you that Ecstasy has taught me and that is <br />[love peace harmony and respect for your fellow man]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[AFTER TRIP REPORT] 21/3/2012<br /><br />Woke up at about 13:30 stayed in bed for about two hours just thinking over all the things that I had felt last night during my trip.<br /><br />15:04 Surprisingly I don&#039;t feel depressed.(But that could change? Will wait and see...) Just feel like I been on a long journey of discovery and learning/adventure.<br />I feel more level with the world. As if I am lower to the ground as opposed to reaching out and touching the heavens... if that makes any sense.<br /><br />15:08 Going to get dressed/brush my teeth then go out shopping with some family and more importantly get some fast food hell I think that fast food is the first thing on my list as I am starving.<br /><br />19:26 Ok just got back from shopping in town and got some good fast food and there are quite a few things of interest that I have noticed in relation to my feelings and perception that I will try my best to explain.<br /><br />First I have had this feeling of being low to the ground but it&#039;s not like depression I have had serious depression in the past and this doesn&#039;t feel like it. It&#039;s like feeling slightly overworked and tired I also have a feeling of relaxation just listening to more music at the moment.<br /><br />I assume (from what I have read online) that this feeling of being low to the ground is the result of depleted serotonin levels in my brain related to the Ecstasy use. (Any experienced trippers care to comment?)<br /><br />I might get a bottle of 5-HTP tablets at some point. Been told it helps replenish serotonin in the brain at a faster rate. I am also drinking a bottle of lucozade to add some glucose to my system as I just need a slight energy boost (I feel tired). <br />I have also taken 1000mg of Vitamin C and 10mg of zinc but that&#039;s nothing new. I take Vitamin C and zinc daily just for the hell of it. Been doing it for the past 2 months now.<br /><br />Right now onto my altered state of perception. I first took notice of it when I looked up at the sky. I don&#039;t know how to explain it but when I look up at the sky it&#039;s like looking up at a beautiful canvas almost like an oil painting that&#039;s far away. <br />I have also noticed that conversation with others is easier than normal for me. I just feel more grounded with reality.<br /><br />(I don&#039;t know if what I am saying is making any sense. I hope it does I am trying my best to put it all into words but am not finding it easy to put feelings into words )<br /><br />My apologies if this log just seems like endless rambling. I will admit this has been the most emotionally motivated log that I have ever written. <br /><br />I found myself experiencing a whole myriad of euphoria and other strong positive emotions when writing the trip report and I believe it has affected the quality of the trip report in a positive way.<br /><br />For example when you look at any of my lsd trip reports this Ecstasy report has to be at least 5-10 times longer then any log I have ever written and is filled with complex emotions as apposed to my lsd reports that just give basic information without so much emotion.<br /><br /><br />Right peoples I think that&#039;s the end of my log. Whoa...This is a very long report now that I look at it....I hope someone out there finds it useful<br /></code>

				that was a fun read!<br /><br />your log reminded me alot of my first roll, where everything feels so amazing and you keep having realizations about how awesome everything is and emotions are running strong. <br /><br />my advice to you is wait a lonnnnnggg time between rolls 2 months is OK but if you can 6 to a year youre golden. your serotonin depletes fast and after a few rolls you wont feel that specialness anymore :( happens to a lot of people (myself included) now mdma only effects me half as good as it used to, still fun just not so euphoric. when on mdma, its great to have someone rolling with you too, that can lead to some special, deep, empathetic and emotional conversations with close friends, and even not so close friends. all of a sudden all barriers are gone and two people can say how they feel and express themselves perfectly. its amazing.<br /><br />i have also felt confusion often on big amounts of mdma. i always end up misplacing things. <br /><br />oh and you dosed perfectly for a first timer imo, if you keep your serotonin levels up mdma will hit you just as hard as the last time. make sure not to dose a bunch at one time, it will feel amazing but you come down faster and do more damage to your serotonin. <br /><br /><br />one of my favorite parts:<br /><br />&quot;4:37 Right I think I am over logging going to shut the fuck up now and go back to music P.S This is the most fun I have had in a long fucking time. Back to hugging my childhood Teddy Bear.<br /><br />4:38 I love all you good people @ Silkroad I also want to give credit to Dread Pirate Roberts for making all this possible you are an inspiration. With out SR I would not have access to any of this.&quot;<br /><br /><br />you said you would stop logging a couple times but ended coming right back. that is mdma for you haha<br /><br />&nbsp;talking or expressing how feel is just natural and it feels amazing to do. mdma is a great drug to combine stuff with. i have yet to candyflip but its a goal of mine. <br /><br />i have peaked on mdma and smoked dmt before. that will change your life lol<br /><br />thanks for sharing!<br />

				For jaw clenching,&nbsp; you can preload with chelated magnesium (I&#039;ll take it with my breakfast and lunch). You can also chew gum or use a pacifier. <br /><br />2 months is plenty between rolls though more is always better. Be sure to exercise and eat well in the mean time.

				That was fun and interesting to read. Thanks for sharing that. I&#039;m guessing you were alone, but I wasn&#039;t sure about that part. I think you might even have a better time in the future rolling with some friends. Hey its&nbsp; a very social drug, and that way you could hug more than your teddy bear. j/k Sorry hope that wasn&#039;t rude of me. I liked your music selection, yeah sonny and cher, and the beatles fit into MDMA to a T. Very happy and upbeat stuff. I&#039;ve found that coconut water is great for muscle aches and tension. Its got magnesium and potassium. So good luck in the future and keep on rolling.

No appreciable side effects except a little fatigue after each day of use. And I continued to feel good for a couple of weeks after I stopped taking it.

Hey its&nbsp; a very social drug, and that way you could hug more than your teddy bear. j/k Sorry hope that wasn&#039;t rude of me. I liked your music selection, yeah sonny and cher, and the beatles fit into MDMA to a T. Very happy and upbeat stuff. I&#039;ve found that coconut water is great for muscle aches and tension. Its got magnesium and potassium. So good luck in the future and keep on rolling.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah I was alone in my room forgot to add that to my log and yeah the music was awesome I have never loved and enjoyed music so much in my entire life it was just pure joy and happiness.<br /><br />lol the teddy bear comment wasn&#039;t rude :) to be honest I rather enjoyed hugging that little teddy bear he was so soft and happy lol :D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16260.msg160240#msg160240">Quote from: moksha on March 22, 2012, 10:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Very good read SpeedCrunch another great trip report. Good to see you enjoyed ecstasy so much, it really is a great drug. <br />I&#039;d definitely go for a roll with a few friends or even a big group next time, it can be really different with friends, partner or by yourself, but all really awesome.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would love to roll with friends but unfortunately there not into any kind of drugs :/ and they don&#039;t even know that I am using any drugs at the moment but with that said I am thinking about telling my best friend about my drug use sometime in the near future just not too sure how to go about doing it. Also since I moved house a few years back all my friends are now a good 7-8 hour drive away...so it&#039;s just me all alone.(Yeah my social skills are shit in real life. I only got 3 friends in real life. :/)<br /><br />I go out clubbing with co workers sometimes next time I go out with them I might roll 30 min before hitting the nightclubs might be fun.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />I need some advice about a good Preloading and Postloading regimen.<br />I went out to town today and visited my local herbal remedy shop and picked up a few Preloading and Postloading supplies.<br /><br />I picked up the following at my local herbal remedy shop: (I think the old lady at the till knew something was up she gave me an odd look when she was scanning all the bottles lmao.)<br /><br />5-HTP 100mg tablets<br />Chelated Magnesium 100mg tablets<br />Vitamin C 1500mg tablets<br />L-Tyrosine 500 mg Vegetable Capsules<br /><br />I been doing a lot of research online about Preloading and Postloading with a lot of mixed results specificity related to how many mg of each drug I should be taking and how long I should continue taking the tablets. Such as with my current postloading how much 5-HTP should I be taking and for how many days.<br /><br />As for today I have taken<br />400mg 5-HTP<br />500mg Chelated Magnesium<br />1000mg Vitamin C (My last 1000mg tablet. that&#039;s why I got the 1500mg tablets today)<br /><br />I took the magnesium because my jaw was a little sore. From what I have read online magnesium is more for preloading as apposed to postloading but I figured it couldn&#039;t hurt.<br />I think the 400mg 5-HTP might of been a little high but I figured my serotonin could use the boost.<br /><br />So I just need some advice about how many mg I should be taking and for how many days I should be postloading.<br /><br />P.S just wondering is it safe to be doing LSD when taking all these supplements?<br /><br />As always<br />Kind Regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				Hey SpeedCrunch,<br /><br />After reading your log, I figure I post a little about the first time I candy-flipped. I went to one of the big raves . Bout 30 min prior to going in I took a 250 µg dose of LSD<br /><br />Then 15 min&nbsp; later while still in line to get in I got a little paranoid so I took on of the two 130 mg MDMA caps. I had (was going to wait til the Acid kicked in, but thought the security was going to find it. They were very lax on the pat down probably could of brought 50 or so pills with me jk lol ). <br />&nbsp;After I got into the rave the molly hit me hard and didn&#039;t&nbsp; really even feel the LSD, but the E hit me harder then ever before. I had a blast talking to strangers (would never normal do that), Dancing and just plan walking around. Bout two hours in I took the second 130 mg cap. and proceed to chat, hug and dance with people I would normally never even talk to. <br />After 4 or so hours I became very tired ,and headed home. Once home the Acid hit me good, and was up for anther couple of hours enjoying the trip. I deiced to take a 5-htp and go to bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;The next day I woke up and was still&nbsp; hallucinating(16+ hours from first taking the hit). This was weird, but decided to roll with it. It was actually kinda a nice way to feel first thing in the morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking 2 Ginkgo Balboa, 2 Vitamin B complex , a multivitamin and a 100 mg 5-htp every morning since. As well as&nbsp; a 100 mg 5-htp some time later in the day. I have not had the normal &quot;depression&quot;(I agree this isn&#039;t what I would call&nbsp; &quot;depression&quot; but don&#039;t know another word for it) from the E that I&#039;m use to. This is the first time I&#039;ve ever taken the 5-htp after rolling, now I&#039;d recommend it .<br /><br />As far as how often you can roll, everyone is different, but I have done it twice in a month before with no ill affects. I would recommend at least a month in between. and as always the longer the better.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Keep out the good work love the logs,<br /><br />HeyOItsMe

				For magnesium, it will take some playing around with. Try 200mg at breakfast, lunch, and post roll. If that doesn&#039;t give you diarrhea and are still having issues with jaw clenching, take more. If it does give you diarrhea, take less and supplement with gum and/or pacifier.
