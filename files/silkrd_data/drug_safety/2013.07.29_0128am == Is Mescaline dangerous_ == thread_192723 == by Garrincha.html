				How does mescaline compare in risk potential in comparison to drugs like LSD, shrooms etc? It&#039;s a drug which intrigues me, and I have tried San Pedro before with little effect (I chewed small chunks of it which apparently is an inefficient way of consuming). What puts me off trying pure mescaline, is previous bad experiences with LSD, causing mental health problems. Could taking mescaline permanently worsen my state?

				&nbsp;;) Yes, that was the answer I was expecting, and indeed, I do (generally) steer clear of psychedelics these days. Have had some decent experiences with Baby Woodrose though, which contain LSA. I guess these are very mildly psychedelic compared to some of the drugs sold on SR however.

				All drugs are dangerous to some degree. It is the dose that makes the poison. Generally speaking however mescaline is a much milder psychedelic then say psilocybin or LSD. Its generally much easier on the mind and is more emapthogenic with some psychedelic effects. Phenethylamines are usually much easier to manage than tryptamines. Physically its quite safe as long as the dosage is not too extreme.

				What kind of &quot;mental health problems&quot;?<br /><br />In general Mescaline (especially when part of the total cactus alkaloid complex) is more gentle on the psyche than either LSD or Psilocybin, and phenethylamines are in general more forgiving than the indoles/tryptamines. I concur with DMtryptamine285 in this regard.<br /><br />That said, if the dose is high enough you will know all about it - and I concur precisely with valakki in that regard! ;)<br /><br />Whole cactus or full-spectrum Mescaline alkaloid complex, when used in a conscious shamanic way with proper context, support and intention to heal can definitely serve - even in relation to what you describe as your &quot;mental health problems&quot;, but ultimately you would need to decide if it is the right path for you. And if you do explore start slow and start humbly...<br /><br />BG

				Thanks DMtryptamine285 and BG! That clarifies things a bit. I suppose my original question should have been - is Mescaline dangerous for someone already with mental health problems i.e. could it potentially worsen my mental state on a permanent basis, or is it, as you say, more benign than LSD or Shrooms?

But yes I would say it is safer (marginally) to use than LSD and Shrooms.<br /><br />Regarding your sensitivity around your mental state I would suggest to proceed cautiously and with clear and serious intention of how you want to use any psychedelics. They are all medicines if you relate to them rightly...<br /><br />BG
