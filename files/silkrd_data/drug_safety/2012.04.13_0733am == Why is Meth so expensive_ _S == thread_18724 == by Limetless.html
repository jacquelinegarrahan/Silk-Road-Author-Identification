				Ok, never done Meth and no desire to either but I was flicking through the Stimulants page on The Road looking to make a purchase for next week and noticed that Crystal Meth is quite expensive for such a basic and easy to produce drug.

				Yeah Meth is non-existent in the U.K. I wouldn&#039;t appeal to me anyway even if it was readily available it just seems really dear. I&#039;m gunna check out this old chestnut on youtube now. Sounds like it could be my 10.40 in the morning chuckle, along with Frasier. :)

				Oh yeah I know it was used by the Nazi&#039;s, that&#039;s why it&#039;s called Nazi-Krank in the U.K lol. <br /><br />Anyway yeah watched the little promotional video and didn&#039;t really inspire me to do Meth. The make up artists they were using were shit-hot though so fair do&#039;s on the producers for getting decent staff in. And that girl in the first advert was lying, her boyfriend was shit if he was letting people shag her for Meth. Ridiculousness.... :P<br /><br />Out of interest is Nazi-Krank actually that addictive? As I said I have no inclination to try it, it just seems that the advert was UBER-FUCKING-ZEALOUS on pointing out that once you smoke the Krank your life instantly turns to wank. (Rhyme was intentional there)

				I&#039;ve always thought that Heroin, Coke and Meth are so expensive because they have a huge line of addicted people willing to buy their fix at almost any price. All of those drugs are cheap to manufacture in their manufacturing countries. A coca farmer makes a kilo of coke in South-America and sells it for the &quot;coca-mafia&quot; for a few hundred dollars profit... http://factsanddetails.com/world.php?itemid=1214&amp;catid=54&amp;subcatid=348 (good link)<br /><br />A middleman pays about 750-1600$ a kilo, but bring the coke to the States and you Mr. have made an instant 20,000$+ profit! As for everything, the price is determined by the supply and demand. For example, crack is the most abused and used drug straight after maryjane in the US. There is a HUUUUGE market and demand for cocaine, but the mafia needs to take a risk always when they move product over boarders (and they also want to keep making sick money xD) so that&#039;s why the price is high.<br />There are people willing to pay the price they are asked to pay. Same applies to meth and heroin. <br /><br />But then if you examine the prices of drugs like LSD, MDMA and Cannabis. These are all drugs that are all in the same range of manufacturing expenses as H, Coke and Meth, but people would never be willing to pay 50 bucks a pill for MDMA, or 200$ a gram for Cannabis (well maybe if it would be THE SHIT! :D) or 50$ a blotter for LSD! This is because the users of these drugs don&#039;t abuse their drugs in the same way as Meth, coke or H-heads. M, L and Cannabis all have a huge Supply and Demand, but do not cause addiction in the way expensive hard drugs do. <br /><br />Dunno if my post made any sense :D

				The mission of the advert is to convince the viewer HOW FUCKING AWESOME and HOW FUCKING EUPHORIC meth is. They cannot say &quot;METH IS SO FUCKING AWESOME&quot; or &quot;METH IS PURE EUPHORIA&quot;, so they say that meth is addictive.<br /><br />In reality, meth is not euphoric neither awesome.

				In all seriousness...<br /><br />&nbsp; Used to.. &quot;crank&quot; was not a big deal. If you wanted some &quot;crank&quot; or some &quot;wire&quot; or some &quot;gogo&quot;.. you had to talk to the working men. Construction workers, truckers, people who stayed awake and worked hard. At least when and where I grew up.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The routes of administration were pretty much *always* oral (toss a bump off in your coffee) or snort it. We had a joke.. &quot;crank is what coke is SUPPOSED to be.. but just isn&#039;t&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;At some point.. the game changed. I think it was a combination of DEA enforcement and the &quot;meth culture&quot; arriving from out West. These two things.. I&#039;m not sure if one caused the other or if they were unconnected. All I know is the &quot;3 M&quot; subculture started withering.<br />&nbsp;The DEA and LEs started cracking down on precursors, busting labs, busting people right and left. The quality of the wire went into the fucking toilet. Everybody who did it as an occasional energy and motivation supplement like we did pretty much hunkered down, faded from the scene and waited for this next round of the drug war to ease off.<br />&nbsp; Meanwhile the people who REALLY REALLY liked their meth (these were either the folks called &quot;tweakers&quot; or would soon be) stopped getting so high on crank the way we all did it (i.e. eating or snorting it). The quality had gone WAY down, and the price had gone WAY up. It was stomped on like crazy.<br />&nbsp; So in an attempt to get the same high... they started smoking or shooting the stuff. Most of us were horrified. SMOKING speed? Are you a fucking crackhead? The people who shot crank mostly died quick. The ones who smoked crank mostly went crazy. And it&#039;s just kept getting worse and worse.....<br /><br />&nbsp; Years later after learning more about the psychology and pharmacology of addiction in an academic setting I have to say.. the DEA took a relatively benign drug, and altered the cultural circumstances surrounding it to force it into routes of administration which were suboptimal and far more prone to addiction and blowback.<br />&nbsp;Smoking ANYTHING is way quicker and potent (and thus habitforming) than insufflating it.&nbsp; Insufflating ANYTHING is way quicker and potent (and thus habitforming) than eating it.<br /><br />&nbsp;Know your routes of administration and why they are critical is all I can say. Few people ever wound up in a life of living hell cause they put bumps of crank in their coffee but never ever ever smoked it.

If you wanted some &quot;crank&quot; or some &quot;wire&quot; or some &quot;gogo&quot;.. you had to talk to the working men. Construction workers, truckers, people who stayed awake and worked hard. At least when and where I grew up.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The routes of administration were pretty much *always* oral (toss a bump off in your coffee) or snort it. We had a joke.. &quot;crank is what coke is SUPPOSED to be.. but just isn&#039;t&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;At some point.. the game changed. I think it was a combination of DEA enforcement and the &quot;meth culture&quot; arriving from out West. These two things.. I&#039;m not sure if one caused the other or if they were unconnected. All I know is the &quot;3 M&quot; subculture started withering.<br />&nbsp;The DEA and LEs started cracking down on precursors, busting labs, busting people right and left. The quality of the wire went into the fucking toilet. Everybody who did it as an occasional energy and motivation supplement like we did pretty much hunkered down, faded from the scene and waited for this next round of the drug war to ease off.<br />&nbsp; Meanwhile the people who REALLY REALLY liked their meth (these were either the folks called &quot;tweakers&quot; or would soon be) stopped getting so high on crank the way we all did it (i.e. eating or snorting it). The quality had gone WAY down, and the price had gone WAY up. It was stomped on like crazy.<br />&nbsp; So in an attempt to get the same high... they started smoking or shooting the stuff. Most of us were horrified. SMOKING speed? Are you a fucking crackhead? The people who shot crank mostly died quick. The ones who smoked crank mostly went crazy. And it&#039;s just kept getting worse and worse.....<br /><br />&nbsp; Years later after learning more about the psychology and pharmacology of addiction in an academic setting I have to say.. the DEA took a relatively benign drug, and altered the cultural circumstances surrounding it to force it into routes of administration which were suboptimal and far more prone to addiction and blowback.<br />&nbsp;Smoking ANYTHING is way quicker and potent (and thus habitforming) than insufflating it.&nbsp; Insufflating ANYTHING is way quicker and potent (and thus habitforming) than eating it.<br /><br />&nbsp;Know your routes of administration and why they are critical is all I can say. Few people ever wound up in a life of living hell cause they put bumps of crank in their coffee but never ever ever smoked it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmm that is pretty informative I gotta say. I wonder why Krank hasn&#039;t proliferated here like it has in the U.S though? Nobody does it here apart from crack&#039;eds and Bikers.<br /><br />Also postman came and went. No Bing for Limetless today. :( Slightly concerned so messaged the Vendor.

				supply and demand is why. <br /><br />also it&#039;s not really that expensive if you compare it to the price of cocaine. to go on a 3-4 day no sleep bender i would go through almost 15-20grams of cocaine ( yes you read that right ) but only need .5 grams of meth to do the same. <br /><br />that said if a new drug user asked me which one they should buy i would tall them cocaine because meth is mother fucking potent and it will fuck your ass up beyond belief if you aren&#039;t careful.

				Wow lots of meth hate. Show some compassion. Yes meth is addictive, yes some people will go to great lengths to get some, but they can&#039;t help it at this point, so lay the fuck off. Methamphetamine addicts aren&#039;t mentally deficient psychopaths, we&#039;re just people who made a mistake. <br /><br />Most made a choice, a personal choice to start, now most have to deal with the consequences of it. Trust me brah, I don&#039;t need your help feeling bad about my decision to start using meth.<br /><br />@anyone curious what meth is like/ considering trying it:<br /><br />Meth is very smooth and isn&#039;t very mentally taxing. Its not like coke where you have a SUPER rush of awesomeness followed by hours of shittyness... its just a cool long lasting buzz.<br /><br />Meth is extremely addictive because its cheap and easy. Its very portable... as in there aren&#039;t too many outward signs that you are high on it, and you dont need to carry or consume alot.&nbsp; When you first start its very cheap.. that gram of meth lasts days, specially if you sleep at night and try not to take your next hit till you absolutely have to. <br /><br />Once you start using every day for a while there&#039;s no such thing as stopping or taking a break, it has you. Quitting for a few days typically results in binging till you catch up, there&#039;s no way out. <br /><br />Closest drug I can think of to compare it to is cigarettes/nicotine. If you are a cigarette smoker you already have somewhat of an idea what meth addiction is like... when you finally get to the point where you start to think &#039;maybe I should quit..&#039; it&#039;s too late.. you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t do it already I wouldn&#039;t recommend you start. Yet you have choices to make, you can choose to do what you want with your body, and if becoming dependent on a chemical to function is your idea of a good time have at it. I don&#039;t believe in forcefully preventing people from making such personal choices, even if they are self destructive. If you want to slit your wrists, ill try to talk you out of it, but beyond that what can I do? Duct tape you to a chair till you somehow miraculously change your mind? Just remember you were warned.<br /><br />If for some reason someone were to start after reading this, pro icehead advice: You&#039;re gonna need to buy - A few gallons of generic bleach, shit load of q-tips, a bag of tea candles, and many packs of bic lighters... just sayin....

				It really depends on the person. I have bought 2 grams of meth in the past 3 months and have used about 8 total days out of the three months. I get some and shoot it up on the weekend I choose to do it and then don&#039;t buy anymore until I have saved a few pay checks, so that I know that I saved a grand and only spent 150 on drugs that month instead of spending my whole pay check on dope like I did when I was on heroin.

				Damn this is a touchy subject lol. Perhaps shouldn&#039;t have started this thread!<br /><br />Oh and just to be crystal (no pun intended) clear I don&#039;t have any intention of even trying Ice. It doesn&#039;t tempt me to try at all but I just don&#039;t know anything about it so I wanted some information on the subject. Expanding personal knowledge and all that. :)<br /><br />From what the enthusiast and the member who openly said they were addicted said it sounds like some intensely weird shit. Sounds like when it gets hold of you it&#039;s a pretty brutal addiction as well. Grim times.

I was a lover of stimulants from the start, so I was already askin&#039; for it. Opiates on the other hands never did it for me.

I&#039;m making these posts mostly for any newcomers that have never messed with drugs like Ice or H... <br /><br />Circumstance plays a role too... there are plenty of folks that have a cigarette or a black and mild here and there too and aren&#039;t addicted. Meth doesn&#039;t get bad until you &#039;buy your own pack&#039; sort of speak and start doing it like its no big deal.<br /><br />I got started 2 or 3 years ago in the city of Honolulu, Hawaii. I lived with meth addicts, and we would go in and get some top notch Hawaiian clear for like 40 - 50 a gram (at the time). At first I was like you, I did it a few times a month hangin out with them... then I started doing it at work... I had to start my shift at 6 am and I hate mornings. Then I told myself I&#039;d only use on work days... 6 months later I was on it every day. First thing I did in the morning was drink a cup of coffee, smoke a cigarette, eat a big breakfast (tweakers preload much? lol), then hit the clear.<br /><br />It never ran me broke... I&#039;ve mostly kept up with the financial aspect.. its the health aspect I worry about. I don&#039;t FEEL bad, but I look pretty rough.<br /><br />Its almost 3 years now, not sure exactly the date and im still on it. I&#039;ve done enough of it to slow the binging down and take the occasional break, sometimes I replace or mix with RC&#039;s for a bit to save money, but at this point I&#039;m honestly convinced I&#039;m always gonna do meth.

				Oh and to answer the question, meth is expensive because its expensive and a pain in the ass to make.<br /><br />IDK what europes like, but theres more to it then Iodine + red p + phed. You have solvent expenses, gallons of acetone... chemicals are expensive here. If you choose to go out of your way recycling solvents, acetone, etc, your adding extra labor to the process, and if you&#039;re wasteful its a big expense.<br /><br />Ephedrine/ Pseudoephedrine is controlled so you need help acquiring it, and those people expect compensation. Red phosphorus is expensiveee, and tough to get. Restaurant suppliers sell cases of matches, but you have to be careful, because buying 4000 matchbooks a week can raise a few red flags. Not to mention cleaning them uses tons of chemicals.<br /><br />Established cooks i s&#039;pose got the hookups on the red p and such, but not everyone has those hookups, and they still risk their necks, or have to give someone their cut to get it and have to charge accordingly. Iodine involves some shadyness to acquire as well.<br /><br />The actual cooking process is really a bit labor intensive, specially if you&#039;re not using lab grade stuff. Garage chemists have to put alot of time and energy into making sure they start with the cleanest possible stuff, which means care has to go into extracting the pseudo properly, and making sure the phos and iodine are of satisfactory quality, drying acetone etc.<br /><br />You could always go the burch/nazi route.... until you drop a li strip and set your house on fire, or burn your lungs out with the ammonia. Not for the faint of heart or inexperienced...<br /><br />In the USA with all the laws, regulations, and roadblocks you gotta get at least $1200 - $1500 an ounce for the stuff for it to be even worth the while. Then you got all the drama, refunds, reships, time spent reading messages and answering bs questions only to get a .25 or .5 order on SR. Its no wonder vendors are charging 120 - 130 a gram.

It&#039;s what people here are starting to do, and it produces some of the worst quality &#039;bathtub crank&#039; I have ever seen. I haven&#039;t done crystal in two years because of the decline in quality. I did, however, order some (will arrive Mon....&nbsp; ;D ) on SR when I discovered the place this week. By the way, I ordered from VroomVroom - and just so everyone knows he is one of the most pleasant people I have ever dealt with for ANYthing - not to mention for drugs. Quick response time, and complete generosity.<br /><br />I knew a cook, and used to help him, when I was 19. He used the phosphorus method, and you are right - it is complicated and expensive. He did his shit right, even balanced the ph. He only made small batches, mostly six or seven grams, so he didn&#039;t have to deal with procuring large amounts of supplies. Also, he just made personal, and hooked me up. His product never came out as &#039;Ice, Shards&#039;, etc. Always powder, and always amazingly clean and superb. It would turn this beautiful blue - but dry clear and wouldn&#039;t leave residue. I don&#039;t know what caused that, but I have never seen it since. <br /><br />If anyone wants to know what the one pot method is, I will elaborate further.<br /><br />Eco

After a few months of this you basically need to take a big dose just to feel normal. The rush is gone, the fun is over, so what&#039;s the point? I&#039;ve been using speed/meth and cocaine for almost 20 years now and i in all that time i have never increased my intake by all that much because i always listen to my body and won&#039;t use again after a binge until i am in top form. <br /><br />Till this day I still only need .25gram of good meth to stay up for a weekend and be off my rocker... I don&#039;t smoke or inject though but snorting more than does the trick for me. I used to freebase cocaine for a while but i found it to be annoying as fuck because the rush is over pretty quick and all you&#039;re ever doing is looking for your next hit. I hear it&#039;s similar with meth.<br /><br />All of you regular users should just stop, man the fuck up take your lumps, be depressed for a bit and get back on the right path :) You&#039;re giving the rest of us recreational users a bad rep... lol. <br /><br />----<br />That said, i can sort of understand why some people do it but i&#039;ve always kept one thing in the back of my head and that is i never ever want to go broke due to drugs. I didn&#039;t grow up with money but over the course of 16 years i worked hard enough to retire at 30 and during that time i was out partying like a mo-fo almost every weekend but never once did i ever consider using to get myself to work or to help me stay awake when i got there. <br />

				meth is expensive only on SR. irl&#039;s can hook it for 50% less, in my experience. also meth will typically last longer in comparison, in my experience. <br />supply and demand seem to be the culprit for such a premium price.<br />a little price war would be good (for the prices to fall)

After a few months of this you basically need to take a big dose just to feel normal. The rush is gone, the fun is over, so what&#039;s the point? I&#039;ve been using speed/meth and cocaine for almost 20 years now and i in all that time i have never increased my intake by all that much because i always listen to my body and won&#039;t use again after a binge until i am in top form. <br /><br />Till this day I still only need .25gram of good meth to stay up for a weekend and be off my rocker... I don&#039;t smoke or inject though but snorting more than does the trick for me. I used to freebase cocaine for a while but i found it to be annoying as fuck because the rush is over pretty quick and all you&#039;re ever doing is looking for your next hit. I hear it&#039;s similar with meth.<br /><br />All of you regular users should just stop, man the fuck up take your lumps, be depressed for a bit and get back on the right path :) You&#039;re giving the rest of us recreational users a bad rep... lol. <br /><br />----<br />That said, i can sort of understand why some people do it but i&#039;ve always kept one thing in the back of my head and that is i never ever want to go broke due to drugs. I didn&#039;t grow up with money but over the course of 16 years i worked hard enough to retire at 30 and during that time i was out partying like a mo-fo almost every weekend but never once did i ever consider using to get myself to work or to help me stay awake when i got there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As I said money as never a problem for me... Knowing people that can go in on bags helps the price alot. I never used like MONSTER doses daily, unless I took a &#039;break&#039; and was in binge mode either. Dosing got high but not freak high like some people.<br /><br />I&#039;ll throw RC&#039;s in too... A-PVP is a good one thats still widely available in my area. Very good amphetamine substitute when smoked, not so much insufflated. With the right connections these things can be had extremely cheaply, getting one through a week for like $60 - $80. Doesn&#039;t give the bang of the real thing, but it has to be done to keep up imo.<br /><br />I still get high almost every day, and I spend about $600 or so a month. Expensive habit, but not bankrupting with a steady job.<br /><br />Its the health aspects that worry me the most. I&#039;m 5 foot 6, male, and have been as low as 105 pounds for months at a time.<br /><br />Now I keep my weight up, by planning out my dosages so I can slip meals in. Taking a day or 2 break from everything to catch up on food/ sleep, and it&#039;s a little easier to eat on the RC&#039;s. Up to 125 pounds, but it took alot of work, and continues to take alot of work to remember to look after my body despite having a chronic addiction.<br /><br />Its too much work that&#039;s not worth it. If I could go back and never have started in the first place I would. I&#039;ve lost alot of time and put alot of thought and energy into using crystal meth that could have been directed somewhere more productive.<br /><br />P.S. I&#039;m not trying to give &#039;recreational users&#039; a bad name. I&#039;ve stated in prior posts its everyones choice to do what they will with their body. I&#039;m just sayin, there&#039;s better safer, less addictive/ risky drugs out there to use. LSD is the way to go... do that for a while, noones ever directly died, or become dependent on trippin just to be able to get out of bed and go to work.<br /><br />Not dissin you or anyone else, its just a word of friendly advice.

				@keiki<br /><br />Would you say that your environment is a huge player in the reason why you have become so heavily dependent on crystal meth? Being around addicts non stop and majority of friends being addicts.<br /><br />I know when I was on heroin for 3 years that was a huge factor to me, because I was costantly around people shooting dope, and had zero friends that didn&#039;t do dope.<br /><br />I now have just zero friends, it sucks, but I work all the time, and when I don&#039;t work I am usually sleeping, but the weekends are depressing when I have nothing to do and I am a young male.<br /><br />

				Meth is expensive because<br /><br />1) HUGE DEMAND. You can sell it all out locally for $10 per point, so why sell here.<br />2) EXTREME RISK. If you live in the US and are caught with Meth, you could go to jail for life. If anybody finds out you have a lot of meth, they will probably kill you and take it.<br />3) Did I mention huge demand?<br />4) RISKY TO BUY/MANUFACTURE. If you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing could blow up your whole lab. Also risky to buy, most people who make meth are downright dangerous to deal with like bikers.<br /><br />Also precursors are heavily watched. You have to really know what you&#039;re doing and be somewhat organized to make it.<br /><br />I kept a &#039;rolodex&#039; of shady people I grew up with who now manufacture meth which is how I can get it. Otherwise I would have to deal with a dangerous gangster out on the street probably working for the HAMC or other gang<br /><br />EDIT* there is also, no returns when buying meth. If I get an ounce of it and it turns out bunk, unless I&#039;m really tight with the distributor or manufacturer I&#039;m shit out of luck. Often they will just put a gun in your face and say &quot;What are you going to do about it goof?&quot; if you try to return it. Seems all street level middle men are ex cons and scammers/thugs.

The crippling withdrawal set the hook.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine getting &quot;addicted&quot; to meth- it isn&#039;t that same as getting hooked on opiates, although all addiction is similar in some ways.&nbsp; I just get sick of it after a while, tired of being awake at night when I need to work the next day.&nbsp; My orders from the Road usually alternate between h and meth, with several days of not using anything at all in between.&nbsp; It helps me keep a balance.<br /><br /><br />

				Hmmm interesting. Sounds like a fuck of a drug. It is odd that is hasn&#039;t taken off in good old Britannia though and yet it&#039;s so big in the states and I believe it&#039;s taken hold in some places in the EU like Germany, Poland, Russia and I know it&#039;s big in South Africa. Strange because normally the U.K copies everything the U.S does in terms of drug trends but nobody gives a fuck about Meth here it seems.

				Can i add that the dopamine release of doing good ice is off the charts good coke only releases like 150% and ice is like 1200% no shit. People need to understand what meth is or ice. Once you do it you can&#039;t really go much farther up the hardcore drug list. I dont like RCs. First time i smoked ice i was 16 with my hs buddy he was the qb on the fb team. Here i am 25 still doing it. I went almost 4exactly years from 18-22 clean from meth picked back up and been chasing the devil since. Its one thing i can say changed my life forever ... and btw you brits couldnt handle ice us americans are made for the shit i swear. Do yourself a favor and if u have never done it dont.

Hitler thought they were just &#039;healthy vitamin shots&#039; like B12 and the like. So hitler wasn&#039;t really fully complacent in his stim use. Of course as time went on he kind of got hooked on and may have suffered withdrawals from the so-called &#039;vitamin shots&#039;, and Hitler probably figured out by then, those were more than vitamins. And yeah he was a vegetarian and strong dog lover too.<br /><br />So if you do meth, are a vegetarian, and a dog lover you too might someday find a little square mustache growing on your upper lip.<br /><br />And Michael Jordan must be all three too if you remember his similar facial hair from the hanes underwear commercial on a airplane flight ;D

				I&#039;ve smoked it on a few occasions in my early 20&#039;s. That was a while ago.<br /><br />It was an incredible, clear-headed rush. The euphoria of MDMA, and the alertness of cocaine. You didn&#039;t &quot;feel&quot; high, but you have this boundless energy that lasted for hours. I don&#039;t think, looking back, that I even did a whole point the whole night/morning. <br /><br />It also was incredibly rare to find. We saved it for special occasions only.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and if you haven&#039;t, watch Breaking Bad.<br /><br />Meth embodies the sentiment of not trusting a drug/ the addict. Complete lack of touch with reality.<br /><br />Overall, if you have the self-control, I truly think it&#039;s worth trying. But you wanna be sure about that self-control. You&#039;re gonna need it.

				Lately I have also been wondering why Meth is so expensive.&nbsp; It really boggles my mind because i&#039;m in Australia, and I have first hand accounts from users, who say that it costs up to $100 for a point.&nbsp; I was under the impression that Meth was significantly easier to synthesize than MDMA, with more common precursors more easily obtained (although still highly restricted, at least commercially available/redirected from legit sources into the black market). So it just makes me wonder this also?<br /><br />Now I have never tried meth, it&#039;s never really appealed to me enough to try and make a connection and score IRL, considering it&#039;s a tough game for some in places of Aus to source.&nbsp; I am considering buying some from SR, maybe a half gram of shard just to see what the fuss is about, i&#039;m certainly in no rush though, and am well aware of the supposed pitfalls of meth addiction.<br />

That much sleep deprivation can quickly lead to etch-a-sketching paranoia, which can be really unsettling after trying it the first time and turn a person off permanently from doing it again.<br /><br />That&#039;s my guess as to why Brits, even the experimental minded ones, never got completely on board the meth train even though, as you mentioned, they&#039;re otherwise inclined to pick up on the trends of their American cousins.

				Oh, and I would add. once you&#039;ve done meth enough to &quot;get it&quot; (and self righteous prudes like &quot;It&#039;s Normal&quot; has clearly never &quot;gotten it&quot; nor has he any qualification to speak on a subject he knows nothing about) doing yayo becomes a farce that only feels like really watered down, piss poor quality meth. At it&#039;s best, yayo can serve as a cheap warm up act for the real thing but is otherwise intolerable because the comparatively microscopic sized endorphin rush you&#039;re getting just makes you not want to do it out of disgust. <br /><br />It&#039;s weird how when it comes to coke and meth, those that love one tend to feel the other just doesn&#039;t do it for them.

				Meth is the first &#039;hard drug&#039; I&#039;ve done and I got it from here. I only bought it because it was on sale and I was a bit interested in trying it once. I bought 250mg from VortexMilkMan for only $24 and got 310mg+ after I weighed it which I thought was nice. I tried snorting it first, I was doing bumps of 20mg every few minutes until I got high, but it wasn&#039;t really doing it for me. It just felt like Adderall. I just sat in a chair staring forward and felt so disinterested that I was contemplating suicide because it felt like every negative thought possible was flooding my brain. I fell asleep and wake up the next day and tried to smoke it out of my DMT pipe and it was SO much better. I felt the rush instantly. It felt like MDMA if not more intense for about a minute then it was just gone so I&#039;d load another bowl and keep smoking for the initial rush. I wasn&#039;t getting high off it for some reason though. At least what I thought being on meth would be like. I smoked it every day multiple times a day for about 2 weeks for the rush only and once I was out; I was out. I didn&#039;t feel like buying it again or addicted to it or anything like that. I still haven&#039;t thought about doing it again. I just don&#039;t like stimulants really. The thing I miss about it though is the actual smoking process. It looks really cool vaporizing in the pipe and the taste of cherry cough syrup is left in my mouth after every inhale. I associate the smell of cherries with smoking crystal meth now honestly. I&#039;d probably do it again if it was offered to me, but I&#039;m not going to seek it out.

IME, you really have to smoke a lot of it and get REALLY wired to understand how badass it can feel. Kindof like how heroin addicts had to really WORK to become junkies because of how sick you get the first 5-6 times you go all out on H, meth&#039;s not quite that laborious in earning its blessing but you do have to smoke a LOT to get the kind of u4ea I&#039;m thinking of. You&#039;re probably better off not sampling that forbidden fruit.<br /><br />&nbsp;I remember after smoking a shitload not the first time but the first time I truly got to understand it, it was such a body high I felt so good I was laying on the floor moaning. Kind of like you do on E but instead of being fucked up your mind is clear. It&#039;s also really fun to do with hot broads and the sex is off the hook. It&#039;s quite the social drug too.<br /><br />&nbsp;For me, I really enjoy using it and throwing myself into projects as I&#039;m very persistent and productive using it. I&#039;m ADD anyway but I still find glass a far better &quot;smart drug&quot; for me than desoxyn.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done tons of blow usually with friends that were really into it but I could never come close to capturing the euphoria of smoking glass.

				I would never try meth (and crack). Seriously. Even though I&#039;ve tried almost everything and even though I IV heroin. It&#039;s a mixture of &quot;I don&#039;t like uppers that much&quot; and &quot;I don&#039;t wanna look like that&quot;. <br /><br />I live in a town where it&#039;s almost impossible to get crystal or crack, so many people are on mdpv. These people act like typical methheads: They call you in the middle of the night because they need a syringe, they see shadow people, they are paranoid, they do completely senseless stuff believing they are doing sth important etc. So be aware. I tried mdpv 3 times and I don&#039;t get what&#039;s so great about it. Even though I was smoking the whole evening because of the craving. Hell, I didn&#039;t even know why I was doing it, I just HAD TO. But i&#039;ve learned my lesson and now I always say no to it. This behaviour is kind of self-destructive.

Fuck dude..that was some funny shit. It actually made my day... so +1 karma for you. <br /><br />Personally tho, with regards to Meth it is euphoric and awesome which is precisely what makes it so fucking addictive. I&#039;ve been addicted to H and coke, but nothing compares to a Meth habit. Despite many attempts it&#039;s a real bitch to quit. <br />&nbsp;<br />We all know that Meth is way over-priced here on SilkRoad but then again every drug is!! You are paying for the SERVICE of having it delivered to your front door by vendors who are taking some major fucking risks. You couldn&#039;t pay me enough to engage in activity which if caught could result in a life sentence. In that unfortunate scenario you can kiss your virgin asshole goodbye. Also,I don&#039;t mind paying the extra cash to avoid dealing with sketchy drug dealers. Good riddance to that scene.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget tho: Meth/crack/designer drugs/stronger marijuana are all the result of DRUG PROHIBITION!! People are forced to improvise and adapt to the conditions imposed upon them by the GOVERNMENT and it&#039;s &quot;War on (some) Drugs&quot;. Consequently, the drugs just keep on getting more harsh and far more addictive. Personally, if I had the choice I would prefer cocaine or quality amphetamine (both of which seem on short supply on SR). If anyone can hook me up with cheap quality product by all means let me know.<br /><br />I would never shoot the Meth knowing what it&#039;s made from. I prefer to save my veins for good Heroin.I do a bowl once or twice a week (which I enjoy) but I am rather fond of my teeth so I snort lines. It burns like a motherfucker but gets the adrenaline going. I don&#039;t do enough to interfere with my sleeping patterns tho and try to eat nutritious foods. As with any drug, harm reduction is key. <br /><br />Honestly, I don&#039;t believe ANYTHING the government aka the &#039;military/industrial/pharmaceutical complex&#039; tells me b/c they don&#039;t exactly have the best reputation for telling the truth. However, as someone who is currently trying to kick the Meth habit I have great respect for anyone who abstains from even trying this shit.

Meth was developed in the early 20th century and pioneered by the Nazis to combat battle fatigue. Most of the designer drugs actually aren&#039;t designer drugs. For example all the psychedelics pretty much come from either Shulgin&#039;s Tikhal and Pihkal or David Nichols and other researchers (25I and the other NBOMe compounds came from research into mapping sert I believe). Crack was just a way to increase the profitability and potency of coke because coke don&#039;t do to well when it&#039;s smoked raw and puff is grown stronger for marketing purposes.

				its just supply and demand<br /><br />Feds really fought hard against meth. oddly enough it just made it more popular but restricted the supply so prices goes up.<br /><br />plus the penalties for selling are insane.

Meth was developed in the early 20th century and pioneered by the Nazis to combat battle fatigue. Most of the designer drugs actually aren&#039;t designer drugs. For example all the psychedelics pretty much come from either Shulgin&#039;s Tikhal and Pihkal or David Nichols and other researchers (25I and the other NBOMe compounds came from research into mapping sert I believe). Crack was just a way to increase the profitability and potency of coke because coke don&#039;t do to well when it&#039;s smoked raw and puff is grown stronger for marketing purposes. Stronger the shit, more cash you get. It&#039;s all commercial. <br /><br />The only drugs that are a direct result of drug prohibition are the new RCs like the Cathinones (although, arguably not Mephedrone because it was first synthed in the 1920s but forgotten about) but baring that the rest of the Caths and MXE yeah, you aren&#039;t wrong about them. <br /><br />:)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Point taken. However, I didn&#039;t mean to suggest that Meth is a recent American invention: clearly it was a popular stim under the Third Reich. I also agree that the research of Shulgin has made an invaluable contribution to psychedelic drugs. What I did want to state was that drug prohibition has done far more harm than any good.<br /><br />Meth only seemed to become an epidemic in the U.S.&nbsp; (esp in the Mid West) under the Reagan&#039;s &quot;Just Say No&quot; Administration. Bored Mid Westerner&#039;s discovered in the 80&#039;s that they could make Meth using basic chemicals available from a pharmacy or hardware stores.In 1983, laws were passed in the United States prohibiting possession of precursors and equipment for methamphetamine production. Despite that and later legal restrictions (which prevent regular folks from buying Sudafed without I.D.) Meth addiction continues to be on the increase. <br /><br />In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7 billion to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses. This was the same admin btw who armed illegal right wing militia&#039;.s with the proceeds of cocaine sold to &#039;Freeway Rick Ross&#039; who came up with the ingenious way to turn cocaine into crack. Making an expensive illegal substance even more profitable. &#039;Freeway Rick&#039; ran his business like Walmart and had outlets all over South Central L.A. Since crack is heavier than the powdered cocaine preferred by whites African American&#039;s are more likely to be imprisoned for mere drug possession.&nbsp; Today Rick Ross remains in jail while government agents were retained or even promoted. <br /><br />Of course, I am not a physician so it&#039;s arguable, but I would guess that dexedrine is a lot less harmful than Crystal Meth (or&nbsp; MDVP aka &#039;Bath Salts&#039;) and cocaine a lot less harmful and addictive than crack. Of course, organic substances (like coco leaves and Khat) are both awesome&nbsp; stims (I have had the opportunity to try Khat and I love the buzz!) but under the current prohibition most ppl will never have the opportunity to decide for themselves. <br /><br />Despite the &#039;War on (some) drugs&#039; while Meth becomes a major concern of law enforcement the big pharmaceutical companies were given the &#039;green light&#039; to treat a newly discovered &quot;learning disability&quot; called Attention Deficit with amphetamines like Ritalin or Adderall. Although I am not denying the diagnosis of ADD having been in the education system for over 20 years IMO it is over diagnosed. I think it&#039;s a &#039;quick fix&#039; to an education system which is clearly understaffed and underfunded. Btw: there are studies that indicate prescribing amphetamines to children is more likely to lead to &quot;addictive behavior&quot;. This leads me to ask: what&#039;s to stop an impulsive person who was given amphetamines as a child from trying Meth? What else is there to do in Bumfuck,Montana?<br /><br />When Nixon launched his &#039;War on Drugs&#039; and created the DEA it was clearly politically motivated as a way of getting back at &quot;those damn hippie&#039;s&quot; or more specifically the movement against the unpopular war in Vietnam.There was a crackdown on marijuana being imported into America so pot heads learned to grow indoors, and with horticultural ingenuity and acquired skills, were able to produce what cops constantly say has a THC level much higher than anything from the 60&#039;s.<br /><br />Basically my point is this:I believe that if ppl had access to natural organic drugs that were taken in a spiritual context&nbsp; (peyote,magic mushrooms, marijuana, opium, khat, cocoa,DMT) they would be less likely to do the harsher synthetic counterparts or drugs with stickers that say &quot;Not meant for human consumption&quot;. Perhaps an appropriate analogy is this: during alcohol prohibition there was an increase in homemade alcohol or &#039;Moon Shine&#039;. That shit could blind or even kill you whereas a cold beer every now and then won&#039;t.<br /><br />To summarize: drug prohibition does far more harm than good.<br /><br />&quot;Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin Franklin<br />

				While I agree with your overall premises, prohibition has been far more harmful than helpful ... there are a few things you said that I don&#039;t believe are quite accurate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18724.msg239590#msg239590">Quote from: Hassan I Sabbah on May 14, 2012, 04:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Meth only seemed to become an epidemic in the U.S.&nbsp; (esp in the Mid West) under the Reagan&#039;s &quot;Just Say No&quot; Administration.

In the eighties it was still fairly niche markets where it was peddled by biker gangs and within gay communities. The eighties and Reagan admin propaganda was all about bringing awareness to the &quot;cocaine epidemic&quot; and awareness of the new scourge of &quot;crack cocaine&quot;. It might be true that owning equipment and meth precursors became outlawed as early as 1983, but meth making equipment and precursors in 1983 differed a whole lot from the the far more common and easy to obtain equipment and precursors obtainable in the 90&#039;s where super simple recipes based on the Birch method like the Nazi method became proliferated as it became known how easy it was to synth from pseudo. Knowledge of this method began somewhere in Oregon in 1990 and easy to construct meth labs began springing up and down the west coast before making its way east. I remember in the early to mid nineties when friends in ny never saw it and didn&#039;t know how to get it. I think it was the late nineties when 20/20 broke the story of the scourge having ravished the midwest and it explored farming communities that seemed like ghost towns in the morning because farmers had already finished sowing their fields the night before.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Despite the &#039;War on (some) drugs&#039; while Meth becomes a major concern of law enforcement the big pharmaceutical companies were given the &#039;green light&#039; to treat a newly discovered &quot;learning disability&quot; called Attention Deficit with amphetamines like Ritalin or Adderall. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not just Ritalin and Adderall. Meth itself has been available by prescription since 1945 and is available for ADD and narcolepsy under the trade name Desoxyn.

The synthetic counterparts ARE meant for human consumption and were manufactured for that very purpose, whether legitimately by a pharmaceutical giant for medical purposes or in a clandestine lab for the streets. It&#039;s naive to think that access to natural alternatives that are a tiny fraction of as potent as their synth alternates could curb their use. Also, many prefer the pleasurable effects of synth substances without the mental head fuck of a &quot;spiritual context&quot;. I know I do. Nor do I think drugs like opium, khat, or cocoa have much of a spiritual dimension that I&#039;m aware of.

Synthetic counterparts are far preferred over their organic precursors because the high is just superior.

You would think at that price that there would be a huge payoff for triads to move glass manufactured in china and malaysia in bulk into australia. You would think SR market forces would also apply downward pressure to the aussie price point. Lots of aussie clientele it seems, enough that it looks like ptwak is taking a lucrative business trip down there soon.

I&#039;m making these posts mostly for any newcomers that have never messed with drugs like Ice or H... </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Stims were always my crutch, saw too many friends get fucked up from H, saw some die and go to jail and shit.&nbsp; These days I give stims a wide berth except for maybe mdma if that counts&nbsp; ;)<br />I can binge on opiates and not get addicted as much as I love them, I have always given H a lot of respect probably more than it deserves because the rush isn&#039;t stronger than stims it&#039;s more a comforting rush than a woah I&#039;m invincible rush for me anyway
