				Today i got Citalopram 10mg from doctor to my strong anxiety.

				I&#039;ve never had any side effects from SSRI/SNRIs but I&#039;ve never had any positive effects either. I did have side effects while *quitting* the SNRI Effexor (brain &#039;snaps&#039; where it felt my mind would get stuck in one place before slingshotting back into my head) but it wasn&#039;t that awful. I believe Celexa was probably the second or third I was put on if I remember correctly.<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t mean they wouldn&#039;t work for you, albeit if they do it&#039;s up to you to decide if the positives are worth the potential negatives. My anxiety has inhibited me greatly in life, so I don&#039;t regret having a Xanax prescription around per example.<br /><br />As for selling them, apparently there&#039;s been a trend of druggies snorting SSRIs to get some sort of high; it makes no sense to me. Some people like to keep them around for after their MDMA use. You could probably find somebody interested in purchasing them.

				I need to thank for good answer. I also read that some people had gotten some sort of &quot;high&quot; from single strong Citalopram dose. Most likely because like ecstasy, it affects to serotonin (different way though) levels. I don&#039;t know if its true, but i don&#039;t think im going to try.

Do you think anyone would buy these from me&nbsp; ::) just kidding (maybe).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was on 10mg of Citalopram for 6 months. I didn&#039;t have too many side effects. Sleeping was a pain for a couple of weeks. And then once I got into it, then they were OK. I had a defiantly mood change after a couple of months. Manged to get me through a difficult patch. The only major side effect was a small loss of sex drive.<br /><br />Taking medicine is often a waiting game.<br /><br />Both the time it will take for a drug to be effective, and the time it will take for it to leave the body completely, depend on a drug&#039;s half-life.<br /><br />The half-life is the amount of time necessary for the concentration of the drug in the bloodstream of the body to be reduced by one-half. The time it will take for a drug to reach a steady state, or full effectiveness, in the system is based on that half-life.<br /><br />And sometimes it just isn&#039;t all that fast.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />But as with all our drugs, the unwanted effects increase with dosage. Your dose at 10mg, is pretty low. The doctor has given you this low dose to see your reaction to it. Unless you are an extreme case, any side effects at this dose will be minor. <br /><br />So start taking them and see what happens, that&#039;s the only way. It will probably take six to seven days before you feel any notifiable (bar placebo) effects. And an equal time for any side effects to disappear after stopping.<br /><br />You may even need to increase your dose. Take them for a couple of weeks, make sure you keep a good diary on your moods. It will help you monitor and convince the medics if you need to up the dose. Or if they are the right dose.<br /><br />We generally aren&#039;t good at assessing our mental state over a period of time. We go on what we are feeling right now and then apply that backwards.<br /><br />FH<br /><br />FH<br />

A 10mg dose may perk you up, but not high. You will be alert rather than high.<br /><br />You may find SSRI&#039;s are for you, they may not be. But if you pass on them and try to go somewhere else that may have different or worse unwanted effects.

				I&#039;m on Citalopram 20mg.<br /><br />At first I felt high every time I used it. My penis felt amazing all the time. That only lasted a week though.<br /><br />After three weeks use I still feel way more energy than I did before, and I haven&#039;t been depressed since. I don&#039;t get agitated at all anymore and am finding it much easier to talk to strangers.<br /><br />My doctor said it only works if your body is naturally low on serotonin. All doctors say different things though. <br /><br />My friend is on 40mg and he loves it. He used to be a very depressed and anxious person, but after a couple months he is a very cheery guy, he has a few down days but who doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Give it a try.

I do want to point out that your experience bears no relationship to if the OP should take the drugs or not. Because it isn&#039;t about you and your reaction it is about theirs. <br /><br />Quantity some people?<br /><br />For your negative story here there are a few positive ones.<br /><br />So the OP needs to take the medication at the 10mg dose and see what happens.&nbsp; And understand that the vast majority of people have little or no side effects. And those that do manifest are outweighed by the benefit in most cases. The OP&#039;s reaction will sit in the distribution of other people&#039;s reaction, most likely this will be in the mild to negligible area. If not then they change medication, but medicine has to go through the process first. <br /><br />Armed with this knowledge the OP is better informed than anecdotes that won&#039;t help them make a good decision. <br />

				So different opinions&nbsp; :) positive and negative.<br /><br />Im not sure how much tree have any personal experience, but i know s/he knows my case. <br /><br />I have to point out that i have also found out the negatives of SSRI.<br />Since it may cause sexual and emotional problems, even after use (like tree mentioned), i honestly personally feel like playing Russian roulette with my life with medication, what effects i can&#039;t be sure. And sexual effects are quite confirmed since 60 - 98% had these? I dont mean to sound negative, especially for those who have found it helpful(and i cant say 100% how it may effect on me and i still keep it as an opinion), but things that are on line are only things that matter in my life. I think its important for me to bring my thought about this up. <br /><br />And for tree:<br />I dont think i have guts to go complain to doctor&nbsp; :P. I asked from him/her what opinions i have to my anxiety and panic and s/he told that SSRI and Benzos. I feel like i wasn&#039;t wrong, when i came here to look for opinions.

				I wasn&#039;t saying this only because of the experience I had, the general consensus is that SSRIs aren&#039;t very helpful. I already know findingcure from another thread and she didn&#039;t want to take a med everyday for a long time which is what you have to do with SSRIs... She could try to see if it works well though, you&#039;re right.<br /><br />And findingcure, I don&#039;t think you can have irreversible sexual side effects if you just try it for a short amount of time so trying it out for a couple of days shouldn&#039;t be too bad.

				I stopped taking Citalopram a month ago. I was on it for a bit over 6 months (20mg).<br /><br />It really helped a lot in the beginning. I can confirm what ejammings said. The first week or so it made me feel high, like I was floating through the world without actually being there (like watching a movie). It also made me fucking tired the first three days, I couldn&#039;t even get off of my couch. All side effects wore off though after two weeks.<br />It &#039;normalized&#039; and structured my thoughts. The thing is, you stop being yourself. I realized this now that I don&#039;t take it anymore. Citalopram is a trip that lasts as long as you take it. It convinces you that you have everything under control, which is not the case at all. Citalopram changed my behaviour, so the pill was in charge :)<br />It also lowered my sex drive. It&#039;s still not back to normal.<br />I had no &#039;withdrawal symptoms&#039;, but that&#039;s maybe just me, don&#039;t rely on it.<br /><br />It definetely helped me and I&#039;m glad I took it. Just don&#039;t take it too long. For me, it was worth the side effects and I&#039;m a happier person now.<br />Please note that I&#039;m not a doctor and this is just my experience, everything could be completely different for you.<br /><br />cheers my friend :)

				Hey thanks c13hqPX7d for your experience&nbsp; :) I hope your health gets better. Since some people have taken that or other medication years, im sure your brains have opportunity to &quot;recover&quot; from your 6 months. <br /><br />So, if i have understood correct so far, short time could be okay for me; as to give it a try - maybe. But definitely not for long time. Doctor said i could take 6 months too, but i dont feel comfortable with that. I personally want to stay in safe zone. And all medicine&#039;s, that affect brain chemistry and may possibly change it permanently... im just not comfortable with that. And i know this sounds very very weird, but i happen to like my brains and how they work :P. Anxiety just isn&#039;t part of me. I know i sound really tight with my thoughts, but i just want to be extremely cautious with my health. And that sexuality...&nbsp; of course mental problems itself cause problems in this area, like they do with me, but i personally consider it as important part of my identity&nbsp; 8) and wealth. I need to think.<br /><br />Thank you for all these experiences. I highly appreciate this and it really helps.

				I suppose the experience varies between people. I was prescribed citalopram for axiety problems with doses starting at 20 mg and escalating to 40 mg. It did not have any beneficial effect for me, but had many of the side effects.<br /><br />You can try using citalopram or some other ssri to see if it does anything beneficial to you, but do not get your hopes up. These drugs were developed and approved for the treatment of depression, not of anxiety disorder of any kind. They are prescribed off-label for such purposes widely, with variable success rates. <br /><br />Differences between individuals are so large it is hard to say if you will benefit from taking them or not, just be ware that the side effects are no joke and you should be seriously committed to taking ssri&#039;s before starting a treatment plan. These substances are intended to benefit you on the long run, and will not have aby benefcial effect at all during the first week (or two) of treatment.

				That would seem logical.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken the 40 mg doses for some time in the past, on the indication of anxiety, not depression. For me it brought mostly side effects and no results, but i suppose it varies between persons.

And a bit elevated blood pressure, since my condition came from very stressful event. So my brains and body are stressed.<br /><br />But i have also found out that SSRI&#039;s are prescribed to nearly every mental problem. Two doctors, who i visited, suggested them in first visit, without even knowing my problem. It&#039;s bit bothersome. But i still dont deny their effectiveness in some problems. <br /><br />Thanks Ben&nbsp; :)

				This really is the problem with SSRI&#039;s - they are prescribed for all kinds of conditions including anxiety/panic disorder without much proof they are effective in treating it at all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken them as the whole mechanism of offsetting the serotonin/dopamine balance seems feasible at first glance. They actually do offset that balance by quite a bit, the first week i was on citalopram (20 mg then) i felt really odd, something like taking coke and valium and the same time combined with a mild flu. <br /><br />This unpleasant stage passed after a week or so, after which the main effect was mostly apathy - i didn&#039;t -really- care much about anything anymore. Also i gained weight during that period, while it did not solve the anxiety i was taking them for at all. Perhaps i didn&#039;t -care- that much about feeling anxious, but the feeling was still there. <br /><br />After a few months i decided to get rid of them. With the amount i was prescribed and had in stock i could easily taper down the dose from 40 to 30, to 20, to 10 mg, and after that just do without. This took a month or so overall, but i never craved or missed citalopram at all. I sold what i had left to someone explicitly seeking the substance and don&#039;t think i&#039;ll ever feel the need to use it again. <br /><br />I would not want to advise people going against doctors orders, but if you are prescribed citalopram, prozac or some other ssri, think twice about it. If it is against depression it has been proven effective, if it is for any other condition, it probably has not, and i feel you should discuss that with your physician. <br />

That was very thorough comment&nbsp; :) and you have lot of good points. And your personal experiences are very valuable. I hope SSRI&#039;s didn&#039;t cause any permanent or notable side effects to you. Do you now feel better? Apathy sounds very inhuman. I actually experience it in some level at the moment(without medication), but i believe it&#039;s because anxiety have taken the room from other emotions(common sense thinking). When im constantly alert, its hard to grasp positive and lively emotions.<br /><br />Im actually going to meet psychiatrist near by(and ask other options to my condition), but if that doesn&#039;t prove to be productive, i need to think my choices again(that&#039;s why im here&nbsp; ;) ).<br /><br />If i remember correctly, there were a few other person in here, who also felt &quot;different&quot; when on SSRI. It would appeal they change personality temporarily.<br /><br />I wonder who would seek this medication off-prescription...<br /><br />Thanks again Ben. I believe you and most people here and experiences i have heard. I think i need other options for myself&nbsp; :). Citaloprams are my last resort. <br />&nbsp;<br />

				I suppose you know this, but as a comment to people reading this in general:<br /><br />SSRI&#039;s are not drugs that are effective on the short term. You cannot keep one in your wallet like you could a tablet of xanax so you can take it at a moments notice when you really need it.<br /><br />Experiencing any positive effects from ssri&#039;s will take at least a week of daily use, probably 2 weeks. Taking just one tablet will probably make you feel a bit off and ill, but certainly is not beneficial. <br /><br />Something like alprazolam can be used to deal with single incidences of fear quite well - for example with fear of flying if you only fly a dozen times a year or less. If you were to take the ssri approach to dealing with this, it would effectively mean you have to take these substances every day throughout the year to help you with a problem that presents itself, on average, only once a month. That just does not seem like a sensible approach to me.

				I am aware of that, but thank you for adding that. It&#039;s something that has to be understood when starting ssri&#039;s. That&#039;s why choosing to use them is choosing to commit to them long term. My plan is to keep them as opinion IF everything else fails. So it&#039;s not complete no, but it&#039;s not first in my list(after giving it bit thinking - for now). <br />I&#039;m happy about your shared information&nbsp; :)

				Read post 1:<br /><br />Antidepressants are hard to be sold on SR.<br /><br />Antidepressants suck ass since they kill all the magic in your life.<br /><br />Citalopram sucks. Escitalopram sucks as much.<br /><br />They can both make you more anxious in the beginning/after a while.<br /><br />Try to deal with your fear without. Trust me... they say it&#039;s not a drug.. but it&#039;s a hard drug and once you life with it it might be impossible to stop taking it while it;s bad for your body, brain, etc...

				Well, while being open about it, sexual problems are a common side effect of ssri&#039;s. This could be decreased libido, but also longer time or even inability to orgasm for men. Some make use of this effect by taking small doses of ssri&#039;s like prozac to last longer in bed. I&#039;m not sure if this has much merit, but it is a niche application regardless.<br /><br />You can always keep SSRI&#039;s as an option, regardless of negative effects. Personally i would not try them again for anxiety, but in case i developed moderate to severe depression i would still consider them to treat that condition. <br /><br />Also, for anxiety people have reported successful use, both as personal experiences and in clinical trials. It seems, however, impossible to predict which anxiety patients benefit from it and which only suffer the side effects and possibly even aggravation of their condition. <br /><br />Unfortunately this can only leave it up to personal trial: in some cases they work, in some cases they do not, and the only way to establish that is to try them for a relatively long period of time (a month or so to say anything conclusive). <br /><br />Balancing the pro&#039;s and cons I&#039;d be inclined to try other means first. A benzo like alprazolam will most likely be effective the first time you try it. Side effects like drowsiness are only likely to get less with repeated use, but the downside is that the desired effect may also require increasing dosages to be achieved. And while benzo&#039;s are addictive, trying them once or twice to see if they work for your condition as such carries little to no risk of addiction, dependence or tolerance.

				I guess there will always be the discussion between using therapy, pharmacologicals or both. <br /><br />As far as cost goes though: the price of prescibed citalopram is so low that a single session of therapy would be more expensive than taking citalopram for a decade.

While anxiety interrupts healthy emotional stability, ssri&#039;s &quot;may&quot; take completely place from those things that are naturally designed to heal this state and increase well being(of course, like Ben said, the effectiveness of ssri&#039;s to anxiety questionable - they are not directly meant for it, but some have find them helpful). <br />I admit that i still wonder am i doing the right decision, when i have decided not to rely on SSRI&#039;s and look for another option.

				I used to take SSRI&#039;s like a fucking labrat. As a kid I was always on something, always an SSRI. Took Citalopram, Zoloft, and 2 others I can&#039;t remember and don&#039;t care to. I&#039;ve always hated SSRI&#039;s. The fact that I have to take it for MONTHS to feel a slight effect, turned me off to all SSRI&#039;s. Why on Earth would I take something for 1 month, not knowing what it is, just to feel minimal effects. I have never felt a benefit from SSRI&#039;s what-so-ever. Infact, my anxiety and depression just got way worse. <br /><br />Another thing I hated was the side-effects. Mainly the only one I ever got were brain-zaps. I don&#039;t know exactly what they are, or why they happened, but throughout the day I would literally feel a shock in my brain. Like a really quick on, like someone stuck a stungun to my brain for a quick second. I really really hated those, and honestly they kind of scared me a little. SSRI&#039;s aren&#039;t for everyone, definately not me.<br /><br />I would reccomend to stay away. If you have anxiety ask for a benzo, I never understood why I was prescribed anti-depressants for anxiety.

				The problem we see here is that ssri&#039;s are prescribed far too often off-label. SSRI&#039;s have been proven to treat depression, and there is no reason to avoid them for that condition.<br /><br />What i hear and read seems to show that they are also frequently prescribed for anxiety problems, which is legal als off-label use, but does not have as much evidence behind it at all.<br /><br />Biochemically ssri&#039;s will alter the dopamine/serotonin balance in your central nervous system towards a new balance that is higher in serotonin. This is good news for those suffering from depression, but not that good for those that suffer from other conditions like anxiety.<br /><br />The problem is that anxiety often is a very rapid process, you&#039;ll find yourself on top of a building or in the presence of a spider, mouse, clown or whatever strikes fear into you. SSRI&#039;s are often not very useful in such situation since they are very long term drugs that offset brain chemistry over the course of weeks. <br /><br />Even with altered serotonin/dopamine balance that that process will happen, although it may affect you to a smaller degree, mostly due to general apathy. <br /><br />If briefly summized, i&#039;d say that ssri&#039;s will leave you not caring about anything over a period of several weeks, whereas benzodiazepines dampen your fear response over a short period of time without having too much effect on your general appreciation of things. <br /><br />This does validate ssri&#039;s as treatment for depression and other long term conditions though: it may be very preferable to not give a shit compared to feeling depressed about a long term negative situation. <br /><br />
