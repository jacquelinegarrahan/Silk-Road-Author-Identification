				A close call with 25c-nbome<br /><br />Dose: 1 mg exact<br />Substances combined: Phenibut .5 gram, and 1 cannabis joint smoked.<br /><br />Dosed at 12:00 pm, 1mg complexed blotters sublingually. I held all the juices in my mouth and tried my best not to swallow any of the liquid. I started coming up in about 45 minutes and it took about 2 hours to fully peak. While waiting for the comeup I took a walk around the block and then came back inside and chatted with some people online. First real effect I noticed was that I was typing incredibly fast. I went to go check my pupils and they where fully dilated. I was quite dissapointed that I wasn&#039;t getting any visuals and just an extreme LSD like body buzz so I decided to smoke some cannabis, really bad idea.<br /><br />After lighting up I felt as though my pulse was racing uncontrollably, while I felt euphoric I also felt quite anxious and tense. I placed two fingers on my neck and could feel that my BP and HR must be elevated (although without a cuff I cannot discount that this was merely a perception). Peripheral vasoconstriction was then noted after the cannabis effects began to wane. It felt as if I was getting stabbed in the leg with a sharp knife, slight discoloration of extremities was also noted and vains seems to protrude more than usual. This made me a bit concered and I started to fall into a little bit of a bad trip.<br /><br />Still no visual distortions other than very very mild breathing and shifting of images, but I got caught in a bit of a thought loop and it seemed as though I would think one thought, then go on to another, and somehow that second thought would lead back to the first one which was then repeated endlessly. Breathing became somewhat labored (may have been all in my head), and I felt as though I was beginning to overheat (I am in el paso and It is 104 degrees today, and I going between inside and outside, back and forth, so I may have actually been overheating. I started guzzling down water, got in the shower and turned it as cold as it would go. This made the vasoconstriction ten times worse (although the overheating was starting to feel better), because heat causes vasodilation I turned the water to hot and the vasoconstriction subsided but the overheating sensation returned (unsuprisingly), This hot water, cold water balance between vasoconstriction and body temperature went on for about 30-45 minutes until I finally began to feel the effects subside a tad, at which point I just went and lied on the couch until I was back to baseline. Left with a bit of a lingering headache now. Reminded me quite a bit of bromo-dragonfly (although not near that bad as far as vasoconstriction goes, bromo made my foot go completely bluish/purple, I actually had to take a vasodilator when I took bromo or I would have ended up in the ER.)

				Sorry to hear about your bad trip @DMtryptamine285. <br /><br />Now this is just my opinion, but I&#039;m willing to bet that&#039;s all it was. Just a bad trip. Smoking weed can bring on feelings of paranoia and fear, which can take on a infinite repetative quality under the influence of psychedelics. I&#039;ve actually done the cold shower thing before during a bad trip. I had convinced myself that I was overheating and going to die so I got in the shower (with all my clothes on, of course). But it was just a bad trip. The mind can play tricks on you.<br /><br />On a separate note, you might want to rethink giving away your location like that.<br /><br />Peace

Your symptoms sounded like a textbook panic attack that you allowed to further manifest itself. I&#039;ve had a couple day Adderall/speed bender before and the vasoconstriction was so awful that I had blue hands and toes. It was frightening. When shit like that happens, NEVER, under any circumstance hop online and read what could possibly be wrong with you. It only makes your anxiety worse.<br /><br />Just practice breathing to calm yourself, and like the good man said before, a good benzo can level you out quick. As well as a shot or two of vodka in a glass of juice just to help relax.

				Ah well, its a big place lol. Browser redirect issue has been resolved, kept me away from the forums for a while, I was sketching out.<br /><br />Anyways, I have since had many great trips on 25c. It was a textbook anxiety attack brought on by making too much out of peripheral vasoconstriction (Which can occur with many psychedelics.)<br /><br />

				I have a cuff and most of the drugs that I take do significantly elevate my blood pressure and pulse.&nbsp; Anxiety is very common with LSD and NBOMe drugs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like 25c-NBOMe but love LSD though.<br /><br />MDMA can remove the anxiety.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll try an NBOMe again someday.&nbsp; Taking a benzo can diminish the experience but maybe a small dose of a benzo prior to taking an NBOMe would work.<br /><br />Or maybe I&#039;ll just stuck with LSD and 2C-B.
