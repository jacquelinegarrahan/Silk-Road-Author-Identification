				To be fair that exact scenario is why the forums exist. Fellow buyers deserve to know if you&#039;re getting ripped or product not as advertised so that they don&#039;t get treated the same way. Vendors talk about scammy buyers together and that&#039;s great. No one deserves to be ripped off here. Weed out the shit heads by making it known that they either lie or scam. <br /><br />It&#039;s possible that the vendor did not know as well. I&#039;m not saying anyone got scammed but product quality is important and if it&#039;s cut then everyone should know. It&#039;s only fair.

				If you&#039;re positive that it was cut with MXE and have contacted the vendor and discussed with them and are still unhappy, then yes by all means spill the beans on them!

				The vendor will not reply, they are mislabeling drugs, and you wont tell us who this is? People could get sick from such things, in the interest of harm reduction you are morally required to disclose the vendor.

				Yeah you need to just say who it is, it&#039;s kind of weird that you haven&#039;t tbh. Think about how stronger MXE is than K, if someone did a massive slug they could REALLY fuck up hard.

				Hey Velasu?&nbsp; What would stop someone from messaging you and then just posting the IDs themselves?&nbsp; It sounds like that&#039;s the way this story is going to end, because it&#039;s kind of really important people know about these things.
