				Hey guys, is this a good combo? I&#039;ve read that the valium takes the edge off when taking stims. Will they go well together? Taking Valium + Mephedrone

				You should be fine since valium effects GABA receptors instead of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin like mephedrone does.<br /><br />Do you plan on taking the two together? Or just using the valium for the comedown?<br /><br />sdesu

				Hi mate, I plan on taking 20mgs of Valiumwith the Mephedrone. Sometimes I get the jitters from Mephedrone, well most stims actually. I love stims but the anxiety does get out of hand sometimes. Will they be fine together?<br /><br />Sollem

				Just take 1, then you will have the perfect balance, have another 1 later if you need to.<br /><br />I always find the initial jitters on Mephy part of the fun and games. :D

If you take it prior too it makes you quite ballsy, quite good for chattin up birds on.

Try to ride out the rest as best you can, but always keep another on hand just in case. I&#039;d suggest waiting until the comedown before taking any more, it should make it easier.<br /><br />sdesu

				How long does Valium take to ware off? I&#039;ve had a couple tonight to chill out, still can&#039;t sleep though. Really exited to collecting my Drone tomorrow. <br /><br />Yes Lim your pre-ban will be the bollocks indeed - Once I&#039;ve sampled, I&#039;ll be ordering some straight away!

				Diazepam [Valium] is one of the most slowly eliminated benzodiazepines. It has a half-life of up to 200 hours, which means that the blood level for each dose falls by only one half in about 8.3 days. The only other benzodiazepines with similar half lives are chlordiazepoxide [Librium], flunitrazepam [Rohypnol] and flurazepam [Dalmane] all of which are converted to a diazepam metabolite in the body. The slow elimination of diazepam allows a smooth, gradual fall in blood level, allowing your body to adjust slowly to a decreasing concentration of the benzodiazepine. With more rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine e.g. lorazepam, (Ativan) (which has a half-life of 10-20 hours) the blood concentration drops rapidly and withdrawal symptoms can occur between doses, because your body has little time to adjust to low concentrations.<br /><br />Does this means the effects of all the Valium I&#039;ve been taking will last this long? Or will the effects ware off? Sorry I&#039;m a newbie when it comes to half life of drugs.
