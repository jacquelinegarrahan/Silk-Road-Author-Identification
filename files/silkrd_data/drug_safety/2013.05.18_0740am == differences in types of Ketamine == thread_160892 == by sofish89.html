				I have heard ppl throw around the terms S and R when talking about ketamine. And also I;ve heard thst each one could be positively charged (+) or negative (-)<br />So does that mean there are 5 types of K (S+, S-, R+, R- and Racemic) ?? Sorry if this sounds like&nbsp; a newb question but I&#039;ve been sniffing k for years withput knowing if it was the<br />&nbsp;S+ isomer ot the R isomer or just plain racemcic but would love to learn the difference.<br />And si intrsia&#039;s ketmine

				I was trying some out for the first time recently and came upon this problem. As far as I figured out, the S isomer is the better one in terms of effects so that&#039;s why everyone sells S isomer at an inflated price compared to racemic (which is both R+S isomer). I think the S isomer is positively charged and the R is negatively charged so S- R+.<br /><br />Another thing I was wondering was about cooked ketamine. Does this just mean that it&#039;s been cooked off from liquid or does this mean that the crystals have been cooked? Should I cook my K if it is uncooked? I didn&#039;t ever manage to find this out so decided to just go ahead and got a pretty good trip out of it without worrying about it.

Also, a popular misconception is that (+)-ketamine is charged, because there&#039;s a (+) in its name. People think (+)-K will act like things you rubbed a balloon on. That&#039;s false.<br />I hope that sounds more like english to you now!

				So you are saying there are 3 kinds of ketamine, <br />the R the S and the racemic ?<br />If R is never manufactered then why do they make racemic (which has R in it) ?<br />And is it much harder or expensive to produce R ketamine as opposed ro racemic or S+ ?

The thing is, to make racemic ketamine, they don&#039;t produce the (R), then the (S) and mix them in equal proportions. A synthetized molecule is usually racemic unless special steps are taken to only make one specific isomer. <br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s much harder to make the (R) than the (S), but the (S) isomer is more active and has a shorter duration which makes it ideal for anesthesia (that way, the person coming out of anesthesia won&#039;t have as much lingering side effects). That&#039;s why the pure (S) isomer is manufactured. <br /><br />The (R) isomer isn&#039;t very interesting as a medicine, being less active than than the (S) isomer so that&#039;s why it&#039;s not found. The only way you&#039;d get it is from a university or a hospital where they do clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of (R) vs (S)-ketamine. I don&#039;t know if (R)-ketamine is even interesting as a psychedelic but I&#039;d be interested to try it to see how it&#039;s like.

				so is it safe to say that any ketamine that was extracted from medical ketamine vials is probably (S) isomer or do they make medical grade racemic ketamine (in the USA)?<br />and I&#039;m talking about the ketamine vials that veterinarian doctors have in their offices..

				There&#039;s currently more racemic medical ketamine than (S)-ketamine. It&#039;s kinda like how dextroamphetamine started becoming more popular than racemic amphetamine or how escitalopram ((S)-citalopram) is now more popular than racemic citalopram, or armodafinil and modafinil. <br />Both types of ketamine usually come from injection vials, there&#039;s more than enough medical ketamine in India and Mexico to fill the market, I don&#039;t think a lot of ketamine is made in underground labs.<br />As far as I know there&#039;s only racemic ketamine manufactured in the USA at the moment, but maybe they started using (S)-ketamine now.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to cook it to inject it! It&#039;s dissolved anyways. To make it sterile, you can use a 0.22 micometer wheelfilter, it will filter the bacteria out of your solution, so even if you use dirty water it&#039;ll be sterile (there can still be viruses but that&#039;s not a big concern). Unless you use a dirty needle and syringe, it&#039;ll be sterile if you use a 0.22 micrometer wheelfilter (you can buy them on SR or on the clearnet). I don&#039;t think you really need to use a wheelfilter if your ketamine is good and you&#039;re using sterile saline and a sterile needle, good ketamine should be clean enough. If you see insoluble particles though then you should filter it out.

				if anyone is interested.. <br /><br />R and S just refer to the direction in which a substituent group come off the body of the molecule at chiral centers. Racemic means that there is an equal proportion of R and S molecules.<br /><br />They come off at different directions (2 possible, R or S only) depending on the chemical processes (elimination, substitution, addition, etc...). Sometimes certain enantiomers cause dangerous reactions (R-Thalidomide eases morning sickness symptoms whereas S-Thalidomide causes genetic defects and grotesque birth abmnormalities)<br /><br />Not really important info, just if anyone is curious. I only skimmed the thread so i hope i&#039;m not repeating anything!

				Well considering how a lot of people use cigarette filters and non-sterile cotton balls, if your ketamine is pure, you don&#039;t really need to use a cigarette filter or cotton, those would probably do more harm than good. <br />Wheel filters are sterile both ways up to the point when you filter your solution. You can draw you solution in a syringe and then put the wheel filter on and then squirt it in your disinfected spoon. Wheelfilters aren&#039;t reusable though, after some hours they become filled with bacteria.
