				Right ladies and gentz, I have plenty of opiate experiences but virtually no experience with oxycodone formulations due to my location, thus the question:<br />From what I understand the OC is preferable. It is my understanding that first removing its coating and then crushing the OC defeats time realease and it could be then insufflated without said time release kicking in?<br />Please correct me if I am wrong :)

Obviously because it&#039;s much more difficult to break the time release with the new formulation, and slow release sucks compared to IR.&nbsp; Still, you&#039;d think 320mg of oxy over 12 hours (they&#039;re 12 hour time released) would get me blasted...not so much.&nbsp; I could still drink a 5th of whiskey no problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />You are probably aware that you can break the time release on the new OP&#039;s, but it leaves a big gelatinous glob...which you then proceed to swallow.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been told to use lemon juice, or coke (the drink), and soak the pill in the liquid in a shot glass.&nbsp; From what I understand, that&#039;s not really necessary, as water will do the trick just fine.&nbsp; When I have got OP&#039;s in recent months, I just popped a few at once, and it lasts a good while anyhow, so its not all bad. <br /><br />
