				I was just wondering if there is any way to tell if you have taken a research chemical instead of LSD (apart from testing it obviously).&nbsp; Took some LSD recently that gave me a really crazy high heart rate and I have never had that before on LSD, and the come up was faster than usual. I haven&#039;t taken any of the RC so don&#039;t know how to compare the two.&nbsp; It was a big dose for me, 450ug or so. <br />I really just want to know if getting a really high heart rate is normal on a higher dose of lsd, has anyone experienced this before?<br />Thanks everyone.

				It is not normal but not unheard of either. LSD can trigger a whole range of emotions / conditions including panic / anxiety type reactions.<br /><br />One major indicator of LSD / RC is taste (LSD will typically be tasteless / maybe slightly bitter or metallic - many RC&#039;s are really bitter chemical tasting and tongue numbing).<br />LSD is orally active (can be ingested) most RCs on blotter are not orally active (need to be kept under tongue).<br />Pills are usually RC, while LSD come on blotters typically sized 1/4 inch x 1/4 inch (can also be liquid or microdots though but this is less frequent). RC on blotter is often but not always bigger and thicker.<br /><br />Duration of trip - LSD is typically lasts 8 -12 hours peak from 1 -3 hrs after effect onset - most rc&#039;s last shorter but a few go for much longer (dox can go up to 24 hours).<br />Most important I guess is the character of the trip but that of course requires that you are familiar with tripping. LSD has this unique psychedelic headspace - where (to me at least) only shrooms come close.<br />Many RCs may produce even stronger visual effects but wont give that &quot;psychedelic feeling&quot;. RCs are kinda more circus than understanding and enlightenment to me and so much less interesting and rewarding.<br /><br />The LSD analogues that has recently come available al-lad and lsz (? have to check the letters of last one) I have not tried but those should be really close to LSD. Al lad a bit shorter lasting but else very similar even to the trained psychonaut.<br /><br />The typical (low cost) RC like 2C, 25i and nbomes are very different from LSD and usually clearly recognized once you have tried real LSD a couple of times<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Totally right busta, that chemical taste is a give away. RCs also tend to have a heavy body load on the come up which can be disconcerting for many people and the experience is fun, good for partying in my opinion but definitely not psychelic or conducive to inner reflection.

				Haizenberg&#039;s hoffmans are supposed to be pretty bitter. One person said they swallowed it early because they couldn&#039;t stand the taste.<br /><br />And yet, the Avengers tested it and found it contains LSD, and I have yet to see a customer complain about the effects.

Back somewhere in the first 100 pages of the avenger thread one &quot;bitter tasting shiva&quot; was LAB tested in Holland and found to be LSD with no other substances. The test however also shoved that three different solvents had been used to dissolve the LSD one them being methanol and likely the taste came from there.<br />Not all LSD come from real labs and not all come in the form of easily dissolvable high purity crystal (Albion told once he saw some black stuff they had to churn hard with a spatula for quite a while to dissolve).<br />It did contain LSD - some of his users actually liked it more than the usual stuff but clearly some residue from the synthesis meant that some unusual steps had to be taken to get it dissolved and onto blotter.<br /><br />LSD Crystal of a high purity should dissolve easily in water or alcolhol.<br /><br />That is at least my current theory on the matter.<br />What we do know is that several tabs have been tested as containing LSD and no other active substances in Dutch labs even though they did have a chemical taste.<br /><br />I have myself tripped on &quot;bitter Hofmanns and Shivas&quot; and while the taste was unpleasant enough to make me drop the idea of holding them in the mouth and I just swallowed them instead the trips they produced were definitely LSD&nbsp; and very enjoyable.<br /><br />Given the choice I much prefer the tasteless tabs though. <br /><br />The somewhat unpleasant chemical taste some LSD blotters have is quite different from the numbing etc described above that nbome produces.<br /><br />

				Look up the times on erowid of LSD and different RCs that may be sold as it. They are often shorter or longer than LSD, so that&#039;s a dead give away. Also the taste should be neutral and you shouldn&#039;t feel numb in the mouth.

				Listen to busta on this, he hit that on the head. <br /><br />From your brief description it would seem apparent that you had some clean LSD. Good, clean L will give you an energy in your bones. Almost like you want to jump out of your skin. I never fail to get lots of random twitches/tweaks as soon as the come up begins, lasting up to a few hours.

				If they&#039;re lysergamides, it would be a tough call.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest you be attentive to taste, duration, and physical effects.&nbsp; Under the influence of the phenethylamine NBOMe series, you&#039;re more likely to have more vasoconstriction, for instance.&nbsp; You&#039;ll also be able to taste the pure bitterness of the chemical.&nbsp; LSD is supposed to be tasteless; however, some batches do have a metallic taste as a result of the way it was synthesized.&nbsp; The duration is also shorter on NBOMe, 8 hours max, including the afterglow/foggy-headedness.&nbsp; DOC/DOB/DOM usually last way longer than LSD, and you feel more stimulated on those.
