A good device to use is the VaporGenie glass bat vaporizer. Or you could use a little glass meth/crack pipe. That is what I use. It works well. Just make sure to not hit it too hard and I would suggest using a torch lighter.

				Smoking DMT and breaking through may not necessarily give you ego death.<br /><br />I&#039;ve broken through about a dozen times, and have always been aware (in the normal sense of the word, like I am right now) of myself/body throughout break throughs. I have come very close to out-of-body experiences though...<br /><br />I&#039;ve politely declined on multiple occasions to vacate my soul from body when the DMT people have asked me to do so because I was afraid I would die. Next time they ask me to do it I&#039;m ready though. Maybe that would cause an ego death?<br /><br />Time to up the dosage/smoke it more effectively....<br /><br />ALSO, build a &#039;machine&#039;; they&#039;re super cheap and easy too make, and those little liquor sample bottles work great!

A normal breakthrough dose when vaped correctly is 20-30 mg. I think a lot of people waste a lot of DMT by incorrect vaporization technique, and this is bad, for two motives:<br /><br />1) You waste DMT, and the most important<br />2) If you don&#039;t vaporize correctly and the smoke is dry the effects will be different and you will not have a pure DMT experience.

DMT vapor and DMT smoke looks different and tastes different. The vapor looks wet, almost like a cloud does, while DMT smoke looks dry. The more the &quot;cloud&quot; is dry and the more is harsh and hot. Dry smoke does contain solid particles and lots of pyrolysis products that change the experience (sometimes dramatically, depending on how much the DMT is dry).<br /><br />In shamanic terms you can say that DMT is a water spirit that doesn&#039;t like fire. So if you dry the DMT the DMT spirit will not bring you fully into her world. This is, btw, what D.M. Turner has written by personal discovery in &quot;DMT - Water Spirit, A magical link&quot; (the only thing IMO he didn&#039;t understand correctly is that by vaporizing the DMT you produce vapor, i.e. water, so smoking is perfectly fine, actually). You can find the article here:<br /><br />[CLEARNET]<br /><br />http://www.lavondyss.com/donut/guide/water-spirit.html<br /><br />[/CLEARNET]

				It should be directly under, with the bottle held vertically, but without touching the brillo for best results.<br /><br />But it mostly depends on the type of lighter you have. If it is a normal lighter with a low flame you can either touch the brillo (actually in this case you would have to if you don&#039;t have the lung capacity of an elephant), if you have a good torch lighter the flame should be some inches below because it produces a lot of concentrated heat. I think having a torch lighter is almost a must, it is much easier and faster to vaporize the DMT correctly than with a normal lighter (btw the torch lighter should be set as high as to produce the purplish halo).<br /><br />In both case one of the thing that get not much mentioned is the type of toke you must do, but it is very important. It should be slow (VERY slow), steady and long. The more slow and steady the better. If the breath is not slow you bring too much hot air inside, hence turning the vapor into smoke, and if the toke is not steady air circulation and combustion become erratic.<br /><br />To say these things it may seem that the procedure is complicated but in reality with a good torch lighter it is extremely easy to vaporize the DMT correctly with a machine. It is just a matter of understanding the right distance of the lighter from the brillo and how to toke; both things just 1-2 tries will make you good at it soon enough (btw also in the very first times it&#039;s easy to tell if you are too near or far; if the smoke is harsh or hot then you are too near, bring the lighter a little back, instead if there is no vapor rising bring the lighter closer. You have time to adjust correctly with a slow toke).
