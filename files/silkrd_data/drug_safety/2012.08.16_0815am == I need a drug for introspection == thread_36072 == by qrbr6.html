				LSD is pretty good, is there anything else that&#039;s better? I need something that is a real mental journey to look deep into the issues of my life. I find LSD does this great and I get all the answers I need at the time, but I forget it when the trip is over. Maybe I should just write it down during the trip.

				Have to agree with the above, MDMA was great for me. I spent a good hour or so just thinking about my life and everyone important to me, and the things I can change last weekend. Unlike LSD, which for me can be very negative in this way (although the end result is positive as I still get the clarity and insight into the issues I&#039;m currently going through) it was very positive in how I saw the issues.<br /><br />I was thinking about this in the days after, and it was as if LSD is a &#039;father figure&#039;, kicking you on your ass to prove a point, or telling you you&#039;re acting like a dick when you are, while MDMA was a &#039;mother figure&#039;, being a bit more gentle in the lessons she teaches, or telling you that you&#039;ve fucked up, but it&#039;s OK because of all this other positive stuff that you&#039;ve done.<br /><br />(BTW, the above is just an analogy, I&#039;ve said in another thread I don&#039;t find drugs particularly spiritual, but I find this is a good way to explain the experience :) )
