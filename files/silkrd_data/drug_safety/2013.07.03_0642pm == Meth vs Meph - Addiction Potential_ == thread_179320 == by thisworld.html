				So I&#039;ve never intentionally consumed meth.&nbsp; I like stimulants and I know it would probably be a problem for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a great love for meph since I tried it a couple years back, before the ban.&nbsp; Now I&#039;ve recently gotten some really good pre-ban quality meph, went on a small bender, and realized how big of a problem it is for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m curious, to those of you who&#039;ve tried some great, pure product of each variety, which would you say is more addictive, habit forming, or pleasurable?&nbsp; I&#039;m curious mainly about snorting or eating the substances.&nbsp; I have smoked mephedrone and it&#039;s definitely interesting, but a HUGE problem Will NOT smoke it anymore regardless.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t consider smoking meth.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve recently read, though that people who&#039;ve used meth occasionally and recreationally have difficulties keeping meph use recreational, and that would imply it&#039;s the stronger of the two.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just peoples pre-disposition and I&#039;m reading to much into this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp;

				quite.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot more subtle.&nbsp; But totally not, when you think about it.&nbsp; For the first number of times, I never really felt like I was getting high.&nbsp; &nbsp;ALMOST a head change, but nothing I could put my finger on.&nbsp; At the same time, I REALLY wanted to smoke more of it.&nbsp; I almost couldn&#039;t stop.&nbsp; And while wasn&#039;t really getting high, it helped out in between lines.&nbsp; The more I smoked it, I began only taking a fat pull here and there every half hour to maintain through work or whatever and I started noticing it DID in fact have a &#039;high&#039; or head change.&nbsp; Rather noticeable, once you know what to look for.&nbsp; I also noticed I started getting face twitches, started sticking my tongue out when doing something requiring moderate motor control and other mannerisms associated with meth use.&nbsp; I got scared, so much so I started crying.&nbsp; I put down the pipe and never picked it back up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m curious, have you tried FEUK&#039;s meph?&nbsp; The other stuff was never as bad.&nbsp; It&#039;s only once I got &#039;the good stuff&#039; from him shit started happening in earnest.&nbsp; Definitely the best meph on the road currently by a LONG shot! If you haven&#039;t tried his shit you&#039;ve GOTTA.
