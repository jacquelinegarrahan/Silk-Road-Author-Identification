				I&#039;m going to be rolling tomorrow, but I&#039;m not sure which way to take it to have the best results. Keep in mind that I will have a total of 300mg. Also, should I split the 300mg to 150mg or just take it all in?

				Best way for to take molly = Eat it or plug it.<br /><br />Or if you are a crazy insane hardcore wild-man then I have read about people injecting it.<br /><br />As for splitting the dose or all in one, I would personally split it to roll hard over a longer period. BUT this might not be safest. Read the other thread on neurotoxicity.<br /><br />300mg in one go and you would become a super crazed E-head for a while off the come-up but it wouldn&#039;t last as long as two doses spread out!

				id say the best possible way is to dissolve said molly in water, put into a small syringe, remove needle, put it as far as you can into your ass and, push it in&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />if you are afraid of touching your anus, just eat it. <br />(DONT SNORT IT)

				splitting the dose will make your roll last longer but decrease the intensity...<br /><br />taking it all in results in a more intense roll but with a decreased duration...

				depends on how you like to roll....<br /><br />personally back in the day i would crush up the crystals as much as i could in a piece of paper, then dump it all in my mouth like goodies powder. tasted like shit but once it was swallowed it would hit so hard. like a damn freight train lol. however it would end a lot quicker but you can always redose or just enjoy the extreme state during it&#039;s shorter duration.

				If I&#039;m swallowing Molly I normally just get a small glass of water barely filled, pour my does in, swirl it around for a minute until it dissolves, drink it, refill a little and swirl some more in case I missed any and then drink something that doesn&#039;t taste like salty dogs ass as soon as I can. Hits pretty quick (not as fast as plugging) and seems to last about as long as taking it through other routes.<br /><br />As a rule, this method ALWAYS makes my girlfriend toss her lunch on the come up or come down so might want to test on a comfortable does / empty stomach.

				Eat it.<br /><br />Divide it into caps, honestly i&#039;d say start with like 120mg if you&#039;re really new to it, and make 2 other caps with 50mg each, and take the 2nd cap about 1hr after the first dose.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t satisfied with the high by that point (if its your first time, you will be rolling your face off from just the 1st cap honestly), take the 3rd cap another hour after the 2nd dose.&nbsp; <br /><br />But really you could probably do 150mg total in one night and have a great time.&nbsp; And even better you then have enough for a 2nd night in the future!&nbsp; My first time 100mg had me flying, now usually i&#039;ll do 150-160mg with a 60mg booster and that&#039;s plenty good.

				Parachute 150mg if it&#039;s pure stuff. <br /><br />Give other 150 to friend or wait a month and repeat again.<br /><br />With parachuting you won&#039;t have to taste it but it&#039;ll still hit you hard and last awhile.

				Haha, there is alot of stigma and stuff associated with needles.<br />A mate once witnessed some guy shoot up with coke and he was well shocked! <br />The ironic thing is he was in a dodgy area on his way to buy some crack:)<br /><br />If I saw ever someone smoking crack or meth, then I would probably be shocked for a moment because it is outside my realm of everyday observations.<br />(But then again I once chased some substance off of foil and am quite shocked at myself for doing so)<br /><br />I keep a bit more of an open mind these days.<br /><br />I know of someone who put a blotter of acid on their eyeball!<br />This is crazy. Never heard of anyone trying it with molly. Most people value their eye sight.<br />Maybe if I ever go over the edge then I will slit my chest open with a Stanley knife leaving a gaping 12 inch wound. <br />Then proceed to sprinkle a gram of molly, a gram of coke and whatever else I can find directly into the bloody open gash.<br />Then gaffer tape it back up and wait for the ride.<br />I think that this might gross people out though.

				So you ended up parachuting it. Hope you&#039;re starting to feel better.<br /><br />One of the more &#039;unusual&#039; ways that I have administered MDMA (after reagent testing and small taste testing....for possible allergens) is to ground up 100mgs of MDMA into a very fine powder. I then carefully place the powder into Bic Biro or empty pen...and have that pen inserted into the anal passage and have my girlfriend blow the contents hard from the pen into the rectum.<br /><br />Once you get over the oddness of administration, you&#039;ll find that by blowing the contents hard, it will spray out and have a rather large contact footprint internally....and will be absorbed uniformly, thus by-passing the liver and having a fuller effect a lot sooner that other methods.<br /><br />This method is known as &#039;Fairy Dusting&#039; as was used extensively in the 70&#039;s with cocaine.<br /><br />Be careful with your amounts. For harm minimization purposes I would suggest that you decrease your usual intake by 30% using this method....as it&#039;s a (excuse the obvious pun)... major kick in the ass.<br /><br />

				Pop it or plug it! If it&#039;s your first time, go with 150 mg, after about 4 hours if you feel you&#039;re coming down and you still want to party take 75 mg, the when you feel like you&#039;re starting to come down again, pop your last 75 mg. Trust me, you&#039;ll be rolling alllllllll fucking night, and when the sun starts to come up, pop a xanax, and sleep off the comedown. Repeat for entire weekend! Enjoy!

				Just for anyone curious about the 300mg.&nbsp; I have taken 300mg with no tolerance parachuted, and it was not a pleasant experience.&nbsp; I would suggest taking a maximum of 200mg for people with no tolerance and an empty stomach.&nbsp; Then maybe a bump later on.

				It does not sound like you take too much.<br />You say your weight was 220, not sure what that is in kilo or stone, but if above average then maybe you do need more mdma than average?<br /><br />Rolling on heavy doses fucks me alot more than light ones.<br /><br />Back in my &#039;ecstasy&#039; days some pills would not do that much (alot were crap) and I would need to double drop or at least have them in quick succession.<br /><br />If a person is naturally tolerant would a higher dose cause more damage?<br />I do not know, the effects and feelings are rather subjective, maybe you are getting a good roll but need need to roll harder for it to be worthwhile.

				I&#039;ll chime in here.<br /><br />I&#039;m 6&#039;2 and weigh around 250 lbs (ugh.. I need to lose weight) so I&#039;m a fairly big guy. I typically take 200mg to start, and then redose with 100mgs twice throughout the night, maybe once - just depends on the night.<br /><br />I pretty much always plug caps now.<br /><br />Advantages:<br />-You can eat right before you roll and not worry about having to wait before you drop in fear of losing intensity. (surprised no one has pointed this one out)<br />-Sometime ago, I started to get heartburn when I swallowed MDMA. Plugging alleviated that.<br /><br />Disadvantages:<br />-Kind of gross but you&#039;ll figure out the cleanest way to do it with practice.<br />-This might just be me, but after about 10 mins of plugging it, my bowels would start letting me know that something&#039;s up and that I needed to shit out what I just put up there. If this happens to you, you need to resist the urge and wait it out so it gets absorbed fully.. I&#039;d say you&#039;re safe to go after about 30 mins, though this feeling subsided if I completely waited it out altogether.<br /><br />As far as the roll itself from plugging vs swallowing: I don&#039;t notice any difference in intensity or quickness in the come-up. It&#039;s always taken 1-1.5 hours for the roll to really start kicking in for me either way.<br /><br />As far as how much you should take? Trial and error on that one. We all can sit here and tell you not to take more than X mg over the course of the night, and how to space it out, but honestly, when you&#039;re having a great time, the party&#039;s only half over and you&#039;re starting to come down, very little will stop you from wanting to drop again, even when you know you probably shouldn&#039;t.

Was really pleased with the addition of 2CB to the end of MDMA roll since I tend to fiend and just want to keep taking more MDMA but the 2CB put me into a pretty happy spot without the need to redose. Plus I wasn&#039;t so high that I couldn&#039;t just snuggle up with her a few hours after the dose and get some sleep. It sounds like GHB would also help with a smooth landing as well. Fortunately for you if it&#039;s a good time I love hopping on the forums and telling people about the drugs we take :-&gt;

He just recently started having his fun with drugs. About a year ago we had a little house party and I gave him probably the equivalent of 300mg of molly in capsules and he got nothing off of it, and it was good stuff because everyone else was good! So the first thing I&#039;m thinking is he&#039;s on some sort of meds, but he&#039;s on absolutely nothing.<br /><br />So a few months later we went to another house party, I was feeling generous, and I wanted this guy to experience x for once, so I gave him a full gram of molly, and he had to take all of it to actually feel it. From what I understand, he took most of it at once, and even when he said he was feeling it, he didn&#039;t look like he was rolling, at least not what you&#039;d expect someone to look like after they&#039;d taken that much at once.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of rare instances of people that just can&#039;t roll like everyone else off normal dosages. I can definitely attest to seeing it firsthand, but I&#039;d be curious of what the actual reason would be. Since it&#039;s all about chemicals in the brain, there&#039;s gotta be something that&#039;s (not) going on that&#039;s causing it.
