				I thought I&#039;d take the chance to answer or respond to a few questions I get frequently about these magical fungi.<br /><br />I have a good knowledge of mycology, but this write-up is by no means authoritative. Just observations after over a decade of experience with them. <br /><br />Please feel free to chime in, challenge me, or ask a question that&#039;s on your mind. Because my knowledge is somewhat specific to my grower&#039;s P. Cubensis isolates, I can answer most any question you have about them, but I know a good deal about most hallucinogenic mushrooms.<br /><br />Some commonly believed mushroom facts that I consider myths:<br /><br />--<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Cap/Stem potency ::<br /><br />Many people seem to prefer a large quantity of caps to stems because they believe the caps are more potent. All fungal tissue of the mushroom (fruit, technically) are equivalent or, at most, negligibly different in potency.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Strain potency (Cubensis) ::<br /><br />Aren&#039;t those Penis Envies the strong Cubensis strain? No, I have to echo many mycologists that, &quot;a cube is a cube is a cube,&quot; at least when it comes to strain. The factors that determine potency are: <br /><br />--Mushroom species (P. Cubensis, Cyanescens, Azurescens, etc)<br /><br />--Growing conditions (Proper harvest times, proper moisture levels, proper sterilization, strategic exposure to stessors, use of nutritive substrate [WELL-composted manure IS an ideal part of this!])<br /><br />--Age of mushrooms since harvest. Mushrooms do degrade over time, but properly stored in a cool, dark, and dry environment they can last at least 6 months with no noticeable loss in potency. My mushrooms tend to make it to your mailbox about a week after harvest.<br /><br />--Mushroom isolate. I can best explain what an isolate is by comparing the categorization to that of humans. Consider Homo Sapiens, they can be differentiated by race/ethnicity as well as individuals (persons). Simplified, A Cubensis strain is equivalent to a race of people, which are all of the same species. An isolate is equivalent to a person who is of a race or ethnicity. Just as a person of any race can rise to greatness, so can an isolate of any strain. With some work, an isolate can be taken from a multi-genetic sample of fungal tissue. It&#039;s just as hard of a labor to find a stellar isolate as it is to find a perfect actor for a screenplay. It must be auditioned for out of many possible individuals, and the actor (isolate) must not only be talented (potent), but suited for the role (growing conditions) as well. Many growers do not use isolates as they can be somewhat difficult to isolate properly. All of my mushrooms are grown from 4 stellar isolates at this time.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Well, don&#039;t mushrooms make your brain bleed ::<br /><br />Of course they do! That&#039;s why we love em so much. You can avoid the brain bleeding by standing on your head throughout the entire duration of the trip, I even drink the tea upside-down now, just to be safe :) <br /><br />Rocker

				I doubt the vitamin C on its own has any effect, I think its just the acidity of the orange juice (ascorbic + citric acid). The orange juice acidifies your stomach, making the alkaloids more soluble in your gastric juices. Also, acidic conditions convert psilocybin (prodrug) to psilocin (active drug), and psilocin is more stable in acids. All this results in the alkaloids being absorbed faster.<br /><br />If you want a faster, stronger and shorter mushroom high, grind up some mushrooms real fine and soak them in key lime juice for 20 minutes, then drink 8)<br /><br /><br />

				how about the stupid myth stating that u trip from magic mushrooms because its actually food poisoning. countless times i tell people theyre tripping because of the psychoactive ingredient psilocin, not because the mushrooms are poisonous... i mean shit, do people who eat e. coli contaminated salads start to have psychedelic experiences? i think not.

				Not sure if this is a myth, but just something that I think a lot of unexperience people assume before taking them. <br /><br />Mushrooms aren&#039;t something to eat for your first time and go to a party or get fucked up on. They are very powerful when it comes to affecting your thought and emotions, so being in a completely new place with a new people or even familiar people will be confusing and overwhelming. Something could happen or be said and you don&#039;t know what is going on it can really throw you for a loop and once things start going bad they usually just escalate since your mind now thinks that way. It could be as simple as someone saying somehting to you and you not understanding then feeling like they are mad at you or think your not smart. That could turn into everyone hates you and you are not welcome there.<br /><br />The less trips the better in my opinion, so instead of on the weekend with a small dose I would do it every few months in higher doses as this will give you way more in depth trip where you actually gain important things/lessons from it. <br /><br />Some may disagree with me, and that is fine, but if you are only using them for pure recreational then you are missing out on their potential. Eat them once in the dark by yourself, and really meditate and focus on yourself and you will have a very unforgettable mind blowing experience.

The same people dont have a problem doing opioids or coke though, which makes me think theyre just subconsciously afraid of exploring the depths of their own minds, and acknowledging themselves for who they truly are, so they have to buy into these stupid myths concerning psychedelics to protect their own egos.

				I just wanted to add that I have grown shrooms and it is very easy and fun hobby. I probably grew a few pounds in the very short time span I did. I didn&#039;t sell them, but ate a bunch and gave over a half pound away to a friend that was on hard times and needed money or something to sell to make money. I couldn&#039;t bring myself to sell them since I didn&#039;t really have any money invested and the amount I did I easily got back with eating and the enjoyment of growing them.<br /><br />I have ate over 10 grams on multiple occasions by the way, and had one in particular very profound mystical experience that has changed the way I view things a little and probably will forever impact my life. I wouldn&#039;t give up that for anything and wish everyone could have some type of similar experience.<br /><br />Shrooms really helped me put my life into a better perspective and allowed my mind to open up and realize some things, so that I could become a slightly better individual. They should be a medicine in my opinion.

				I don&#039;t think shrooms make your brain bleed, seems like another stupid myth started. Can you provide any studies that proves that?(Not disagreeing just curiosity. A lot of people think LSD can cause flashbacks and stays in your spine. The flashbacks are caused by a disorder and the spine thing is an out right lie.
