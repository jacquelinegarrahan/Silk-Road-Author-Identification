				I started late. Never did any drugs in high school or college. First time I ever smoked weed was when I was 35 years old. Now I&#039;m a little older and starting to try out some of these chemicals. I already tried:<br /><br />M1 - very nice for me. Little anxscious at first but then just put me in a relaxed state. <br />MDMA - May have had weak stuff. Took 200mg and nothing really. Went to bed actually 3 hours later. Will try another seller in future.<br />2C-B - Not bad. Smooth and was nice to watch music videos and stuff like that. Wanted some more visuals, but 2c-b isn&#039;t all for that. mild.<br /><br />I never tried coccaine or LSD. Anyone recommend them? What would you guys recommend next? I&#039;m basically searching for a long high, euphoria heaven, and just to relax. I plan on finding something I really like and just sticking with that. I don&#039;t want to keep trying different things. Maybe a different 2C-x chemical? I was told to try 2C-i.<br />Thanks.

				Hey! <br />First off your mdma experience sounds like you had bunk stuff 200mg should have definitely had effects from this dose, try a different vendor and you will have a great time :)<br /><br />LSD is a great experience, 2C-I + 2C-E are also very good.<br /><br />Start with these and see what you like :) But crystal mdma is a fantastic drug (ivory if your in the uk) and (tony76 if your in the us) both have some really nice product.

				Try proper MDMA, MDA, Bing (Coke), Valium, K, MBDB, Mephedrone. <br /><br />They are all my favourites. :P

				Consider an MDMA pill. I recommend SKYY&#039;s pink stars. Lasts over twice as long as pure MDMA, and they are definitely not bunk!

				No worries dude. Happy to help anyway.<br /><br />Very much depends on the purity of your MXE. If it&#039;s 99.99% which then don&#039;t do more than 80mg, and I would say that is pushing it.<br /><br />K, I have seen people snort gram lines, go into a K hole and then gone raving after. And this is pure racemic K because the cook it themselves and then acetone wash it afterwards and then rewash it. As I say it&#039;s extremely hard to OD on K.<br /><br />
