				What are your thoughts?&nbsp; Do you ride it out in sobriety, cut back, or continue to use as normal?&nbsp; Does it depend on the drug for you?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been sick for 2 weeks now (no voice, sore throat, bad cough)...which basically equates to me being sober for 2 weeks, with the exception of a little weed on three of the days.&nbsp; Long story short, I&#039;ve been kind of dying for some excitement of some kind and I&#039;m debating on whether or not it would be a good idea to do anything, or just continue to wait until I feel better.&nbsp; :o

				depends what it is and what your taking for being sick. Like when you think cold medicines you should be alert about potential tylenol poisoning and liver stress in general. But ya I rolled while sick it made for a much better day.

				Yeah, I was taking some medicine, but I quit after a week.&nbsp; As bad as it sounds, I&#039;d rather not put that much stress on my organs if I&#039;m not getting any fun out of it.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve got a drawer full of coke and e calling my name, and to make it worse, I just had some of VMM&#039;s meth show up in the mail.&nbsp; So I&#039;m staring and mentally debating.&nbsp; Go figure. ::)

				If I had to chose I&#039;d go with the E. The C will just make the stuffed up head and sore throat worse and will last a few days. Meth depending on you method will be similar to C or a super sore throat from smoking it. But thats up to you.

				When I&#039;m sick I usually try my best to avoid any drugs. Drugs always seem to make the effects of my sickness so much worse, and I almost never find it worth it. Hope the E goes well for you, though. =]

				Good medicine for your symptoms...<br /><br />First learn to cook ur Maryjane :)<br /><br />2nd Drink it with some mountain tea (find it in bio healthy shit shops not the ones that comes in packages. you will have to clean the plant and boilit yourself) <br /><br />you can add then the mj oil and drink it. no soar throat even if you smoke afterwards :)<br /><br />DXM or morphin... well yes.. but if you dont have a dealer.. FUBAR :P <br /><br />Instead use seropram (buy it from any drugstore) 20mg x4 (you will have to smash it to dust(again sorry for my english) add to some juice that ill not hurt your throat (not orange :P) and you will be ok. you coult talk even smoke your fav mj :)<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />plus learn some basic chemistry. get the kid kit and use it for disting... (toyshops everywhere available) (look for pyroprotected - dont blow up if you mess it up with the heat level). plus check the growgrennup guide (there is even in tpb :P) English and Dutch :)<br /><br />hope it helped :)<br /><br />

				I usually just smoke my marijuana when I&#039;m sick then kick back or sleep. This past season I hit some DMT when I was out with a cold and damn did my symptoms fly right out the window. Sinuses cleared and I had the energy to move and think, a complete 180 from where I was 5 minutes previously.<br /><br />In your situation I&#039;d hit the MDMA if anything, but I can only imagine what coming down while sick would be like. Have some happy activities and some pizza around to keep your spirits up :)

				Take several grams of Ascorbate (vitamin C) each day, along with as much flavonoids as you can get your hands on.

				I definitely avoid alcohol while sick, it never helps. Still have a bit of weed to relax and help sleep. I probably would rather save most other things for when I&#039;m feeling better and can enjoy them more.<br /><br />Interesting gharyeee saying DMT makes you feel better. I might even hit a small amount of that later since I&#039;m a bit sick now myself. And I have a bunch of DXM I could drop as well if needed!

				Ecstasy is fucking amazing for relieving symptoms of a generic sickness, but I suspect the stress it puts on your body isn&#039;t good for ur immune system.&nbsp; but you feel great while on it..
