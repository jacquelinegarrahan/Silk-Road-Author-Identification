				Need to ask the hive about this, as it&#039;s not a problem for me personally, but it&#039;s become apparent that occasionally, a friend will bite off a bit more than they can chew, and a handy pill could be useful... So I need some sound recommendations for my First Aid kit&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />The literature still seems to recommend Valium as the go-to for any kind of psychedelic crisis/freak-out, and I can appreciate it has a long track record if nothing else. I took 2.5 mg once, to zonk out on a long flight, and hated it: I felt miserable, washed out and hung over for about two days after. If I ever need a downer, weed and/or vodka do just fine, but then, I am generally the last man standing...<br /><br />So, still Valium? Or has anything better/more blissful come along since then? We are mostly playing with Nbomes these days...who wouldn&#039;t?!<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				I hate to abort..... but Xanax works. Don&#039;t need much. a&nbsp; 0.5 mg pill. no need to take more. kills it right away.<br />I only tried it with LSD tho....<br />I dont know nothing about Nbomes....<br />

				Yeah Xanax over Valium, just gets in the system much faster from what I have heard.<br /><br />Funniest advice I read recently was dropping some MDMA into the poor bad tripper. Honestly probably the only way to turn a bad trip good but man that would suck to be the one who got suckered into an involuntary candy flip after being chased by demons all night.

				Thanks for the info guys, much appreciated.<br /><br />Funnily enough, I&#039;ve suggested molly once or twice! On an excellent, but long weekend, I was totally surprised how taking MDMA a few hours after some acid completely knocked the visuals on the head, and &quot;converted&quot; the visual mayhem into a really nice emotional buzz.<br /><br />Obviously, it&#039;s a delightful feeling if you&#039;re up for that, but when the bull is at the gate (or the friend is going proper loco...) it&#039;s a tricky proposition to sell...!<br /><br />Agree that aborting is to be avoided at all costs, but hey, clearly not everybody is so committed to the One True Path of Enlightenment, whatever they say at the outset...
