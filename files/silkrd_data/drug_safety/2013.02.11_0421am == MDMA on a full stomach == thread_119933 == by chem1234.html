				Had a big dinner at around 8pm. Was still feeling pretty full when I dropped 150mg of LL&#039;s brown sugar at ~11:50pm. It took almost 1 hr to kick in and even then I never really peaked. I got a little energy boost, but nothing else. Last time I rolled was the end of October, so I shouldn&#039;t have much tolerance. Obviously, I was a bit disappointed and underwhelmed after reading all the positive reviews. Is there a noticeable difference between taking molly on a full vs empty stomach?

				You took the 150 mg quite awhile after your dinner. This shouldn&#039;t have lessened the roll at all, which surprises me because Lucky&#039;s stuff is so highly praised. Maybe another factor is coming into play, have you rolled on other occasions recently?

Venue&#039;s pretty big (~3000 max capacity), but I wasn&#039;t in the packed area. Didn&#039;t drink any alcohol all night, just water and coke. I took 600 mg of magnesium an hr before rolling so I wouldn&#039;t grind my teeth, along with 1000 mg of vitamin c. The only other variable I can think of is that I didn&#039;t get it directly from lucky, I went through empathy who seems to be a trusted reseller.

				Its not the MDMA, or at least you can&#039;t tell from this story. I know that it was a while after you ate but the metabolism isn&#039;t a strict time mechanism. If you were still feeling full than chances are is that you ate alot of food. Seeing as you took the MDMA orally, you body is only going to absorbed the drug as it becomes available to it in the intestines. Chances are is that you absorbed the MDMA very slowly to the point where you were never able to peak.

				i&#039;ve rolled on full stomachs and empty stomachs. both have been equally fun.&nbsp; i prefer empty though or a lights stack because of the light nausea before the high. could be a mental thing. i know i&#039;ve had some rolls that just didn&#039;t come through very strong even though they were the same vendor same dose
