				Many drugs are of poor quality, you all know.<br />It would be nice to have a service where anyone who is interested in a special drug being tested, pays a small fee and gets access to the test results, the tester made. <br /><br />It would be like an announcement where guy x writes &quot;I will test drug y with method z if some dudes donate $5 to me&quot;.<br /><br />This could be realized with either a special page/service or just a big topic on the SR forums.<br /><br />What do you think my fellow druggies?

				That&#039;s been happening with MDMA for years. I think it&#039;s a good idea just curious how it would work for other drugs

				There are many test kits for a lot of drugs like MDMA, Amphetamine, Heroine, Cocaine and so on and there are special test stations.<br />The idea was to donate a little bit to anyone who wants to test a drug from SR he has got and everybody who has donated gets the report. That would be fair, I think.

				The downside is that quantitative testing is often rather elaborous. There are plenty of test kits on the market that can demonstrate if a sample contains things like mdma, opiates, benzo&#039;s and what not. <br /><br />Analyzing a tablet to prove, for example, which benzodiazepine it contains and in what exact concentration is more difficult. The best analytical method to determine the exact substance would probably be GC/MS, with concentration testing against a control. <br /><br />As a chemist i wouldn&#039;t say this was difficult to do at all, but the equipment required can be very expensive - count on $100k to a million for a decent quality, second hand gc/ms system. On top of that come the operating costs of running that - helium gas supply, column replacement etc.

				I&#039;d be worried about scammers. They take the drug, decide on it&#039;s quality then send you back a (mostly) bogus report!

				Scammers aside, i just don&#039;t think it would be feasible on a reasonable budget.<br /><br />Surely test kits of all kinds of drugs are available, and many of the are actually low cost and pretty reliable to prove the presence of a substance. The downside is that they tell absolutely nothing about the concentration of active substances. A 10 mg MDMA tablet would test just as positive as a 200 mg one. The reaction may be slower, but that also varies greatly on temperature (and mixing, etc), and for most drugs its so fast that reaction rate isn&#039;t reliable at all. <br /><br />Doing these tests would be able to identify bogus products like fake valium tablets. There would be no way to tell if someone was selling 2 mg valiums as 10 mg ones, or even if they sold a similar benzo as valium. <br /><br />For some drugs you may be able to determine concentration using extraction and titration at a much lower budget. This can be done for several drugs on a few thousand worth of equipment and chemicals, but it would probably be sensitive to manipulation (ie the seller including some compound that gives the same response as the active substance, but which is not effective/illegal and much cheaper).

				The problem isn&#039;t a lack of testing, it&#039;s that the test only shows that the particular batch you tested is pure or not pure. <br /><br />What we need is for the larger sellers on SR to not just get their stuff tested (most claim to), but to actually publish a link to the third-party test. Something like &quot;I am selling _____ pills. I sent one to dancesafe and the report # is _____&quot; <br /><br />Right now, they all just say &quot;it was tested by a lab and is ___% pure,&quot; which is just words on a web page. Text, with absolutely no outside source to back it up. <br /><br />VENDORS: If you are getting your stuff tested like you claim, post a link to the testing results! We will all have SO MUCH MORE CONFIDENCE in your product! Buyer reviews are barely worth reading, since they may just have a placebo effect (come on, we all know some guy who got &quot;drunk&quot; on Kool-Aid in high school or &quot;high&quot; on oregano because their friends tricked them. Buyers saying they had a great time does not in any way reassure us that an MDMA pill has MDMA in it).
