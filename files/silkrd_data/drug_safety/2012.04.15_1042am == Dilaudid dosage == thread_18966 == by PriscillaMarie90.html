				Hi, Silk Road.<br /><br />My friend wants some Dilaudid, and we&#039;re going to do it together. He intends to IV it, and he said he will probably need about 8mg to get high. He said I would probably only need about 4mg if I IV it, but I&#039;ve never done it before and obviously I&#039;m really scared.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of snorting it.<br />I was wondering, does anyone know how many mg I would need to get high if I snort the pill instead? I know it will be significantly more, but I really really don&#039;t want to inject anything if I don&#039;t have to. I don&#039;t really care if I don&#039;t get AS high as he does, cause that&#039;s probably not possible, but I just want to know like what&#039;s the minimum dose I would need to feel anything. I have little tolerance to opiates and I weigh about 100lbs., if that matters.<br /><br />Thank you all.<br />&lt;3

				I snorted some 4s recently, and didn&#039;t get too blasted; nothing compared to Roxi, Oxy, or H.&nbsp; I did two in about a 4 hour period.&nbsp; I gave a decent buzz (I was drinking too), so you&#039;ll be safe snorting it.

				before i was really opiate tolerant, i would snort just a couple mg of hydromorphone and end up with a decent buzz. never really enjoyed it anywhere near as much as oxy though.<br /><br />i think the most desirable thing about dilly is the rush. when you snort, like you and I, you dont really get much of that rush so I have always just avoided dilly given the price too. seems like to really get the favorable effect it just is one of those best injected. dont poke though please, just snort what you have and it will be worth it just for the experience (wouldnt even start off with too large a dose, given your size and tolerance... dont have much experience with D like i said so dont know exactly how much, but love you and dont want anything harmful to happen). snorting like 4 mg could even make me pretty sick feeling, and the morphones are a very strong class. Shooting it up may get more out of the drug but is not worth the additional risk imo

My tolerance at the time was moderate- less then some, more than others, even though I used daily for years I always tried to keep it low.<br /><br />Since rushes are associated with IV use (and smoking, I suppose), there is no need for you to worry about doing ENOUGH at one time.&nbsp; Snorting or eating dillies won&#039;t give you a rush, just an opiate high, and they have pretty low oral bio-availability. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s much higher insufflated.&nbsp; 4mg oral is definitely not even close to 4mgs IVd.<br /><br />Just remember that you can always do more if you want, but you can&#039;t put the toothpaste back in the tube once you&#039;ve done too much.&nbsp; Rail 2mgs, wait 20 minutes, and see how you feel.&nbsp; Wanna get a little higher?&nbsp; Do a little more.<br /><br />I won&#039;t preach about not starting on the needle- it&#039;s just another route of administration as long as you&#039;re safe about it.&nbsp; Just know that for most people who start down that path, it soon becomes the preferred method of getting chemicals into one&#039;s body.&nbsp; To be honest, dillies kind of suck unless they&#039;re IVd, and even then there are other things I&#039;d much rather shoot.&nbsp; I much prefer oxycodone or hydrocodone over hydromorphone every time.<br /><br />I think that for someone of your size, with little tolerance to opies, 2-4 mgs oral, or insufflated nasally, would be a good starting point.

				4mg IV should be an alright dose even if you have a very small tolerance. Really diluadid shouldn&#039;t fuck you up too much at that dose, I really just use them for the initial rush, which is different from other opiates. Once the intial rush from IV is over there isn&#039;t too much of a noddy after effect. For me atleast.
