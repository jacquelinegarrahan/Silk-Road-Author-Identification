				A question for my fellow SR&#039;ers.<br /><br />I&#039;m anticipating an order of DMT, but I&#039;m concerned that the product will melt during transit. If this happens, is the DMT still effective? I was planning on dissolving the freebase to make changa. <br /><br />Insight appreciated.

				I&#039;ve had my DMT sitting in a drawer for months, gets unbelievably hot in here when I&#039;m gone long enough and it hasn&#039;t melted. If you receive a product in liquid form the vendor most likely shipped it that way.

				From the research I&#039;ve done the melting point is about 116Â°F so I think it will be just fine :) mine arrived just fine in 90 degree weather :)!<br /><br />(CLEARWEB)<br />Source :h ttp://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/dmt_chemistry.shtml

				If it was extracted well and doesn&#039;t have any solvent left over it shouldn&#039;t melt, but if it does it is still effective. It will probably be packed in filter paper so it doesn&#039;t stick to the plastic. If it melts into the paper just use the solvent you were planning on using to make the changa, I&#039;ve generally used acetone, to pull it out of the paper.

				Well guys, the product became a bit waxy in transit, but not sticky enough to adhere to the plastic bag. Should be fine for some changa alchemy!<br />Thanks for the info.

				I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d use finger nail polish remover since there can be a bunch of other crap in it, but yeah it should work. I&#039;ve used acetone to extract DMT from mimosa hostilis root bark, if it can pull it from that it should be able to pull it from paper.<br /><br />One thing to note with the acetone is it may be worth it to &quot;dry&quot; it first with anhydrous magnesium sulfate(baked epsom salt) to remove most of the water. That should make the evaporation step easier and not leave you with a puddle of watery DMT sludge.

				Definitely do not use nail polish remover! Way too much other crap in it. <br /><br />The best way would be to use proper lab grade ethanol since if there is any remaining, it won&#039;t poison you. But it can be hard to get hold of if you don&#039;t work or know someone who works in a lab. Second best would be isopropyl alcohol as gambino suggested, its pretty cheap.

				It should be fine. If you want to make it a little easier to work with put it in the freezer for an hour or two and that should make it hard enough to chop into a powder with a razor blade or something. How long it stays a powder before getting all waxy again I don&#039;t know, the only time I&#039;ve done it I used it right after.
