				I will be doing LSD for the first time next weekend, and was wondering how much I should take. I bought 20 blotters from SR, each rated at 100ug. I was thinking either 1 or 2 hits. I don&#039;t want anything too intense, but at the same time I don&#039;t want a light trip. I&#039;d like to be able to converse normally.

				Do you have a sitter?<br /><br />If you are completely new to psychedelics or if you&#039;re by yourself, I&#039;d go for one. If you&#039;ve done mushrooms or if you have a sitter, go for two. <br /><br />I am assuming of course that it is good LSD from a reliable vendor and that each hit is really 100ug. More often that not it is less than the advertised amount.

				We will be 5 people. 1 has done it many times, and feels comfortable acting as a sitter. Another has done it once, and the other 3, including me, have never done it before. I&#039;ve done mushrooms 3 times, although my last trip was not a good one (very confused and scared.) I&#039;m assuming they&#039;re actually 80-90ug. Having mentioned that I&#039;ve done mushrooms before, would you still recommend 1 hit? What about 1 hit followed by another an hour later?

				I&#039;ve never redose with LSD, but it is my understanding that redosing an hour later only prolongs the trip, but does not intensify it. I could be wrong.<br /><br />I recommended two earlier, but if you just want to have some fun, then 1 is probably ideal.&nbsp; Two is usually the minimum if you want a spiritual experience. It depends on what you want, I guess.<br /><br />&quot;At somewhere between 200 mcg and 400 mcg of LSD, there appears to be a critical level beyond which psychedelic mystical experience becomes possible, which can be compared to the minimal amount of thrust needed for a rocket to launch itself into orbit.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/pahnke3.htm

It just hit me that I could also do one and a half. Two of my mushroom trips were amazing, but they were truffles from amsterdam. The only time I&#039;ve done actual dried mushrooms, I took half an eighth and had a bad experience (probably more due to set and setting now that I think about it.) I guess I&#039;ll either take one and a half or 2, and hopefully it goes well.

				I would probably go with 1 and add another after 1.5 hours if you are enjoying it. Really depends on if you&#039;re ready to let go mentally, some people just try to fight the trip and it gets ugly. I found that music really helped me my first time, but I was also around experienced psychonauts as well. Having a good sitter makes for a good first trip, they can usually guide your trip if it gets a little hairy.
