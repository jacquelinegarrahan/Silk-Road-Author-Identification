				is there any other way to take oxycodone 5/325 besides shallowing it? Or is that the only method? Crushing it for a greater rush at all? Sniffing?

				Snorting it will fuck up your nose (*sneeze, cough, nose starts bleeding*)<br />I&#039;ve found that with snorting, even though it does give that rush, it in itself as an act is very addicting.<br />I&#039;d personally say that if you&#039;re going to start on pain pills swallow them; know the acetaminophen doses, don&#039;t kill your liver/kidneys and either always have enough or have a backup plan to go off...<br />Right now I&#039;m going through withdrawals...dammit self, I KNEW I should&#039;ve ordered more before the road went down....

				Also...<br />I suppose you COULD IV it but it seems a bit pointless with such a mixed chemical like percocet or really anything less than heroin I think would be a terrible waste.<br />Or...<br />putting it in your bum hole. Never tried it. Probably never will.<br />Can&#039;t help you on that one there...

				no worries, just thought i&#039;d ask, specifically if crushing it will release a quicker/stronger dose. i like swollowing a couple and getting the rush in a bout a hour. was just looking to see if any other ways. i wouldn&#039;t snort as the high tylenol content seems stupid. be strong there gabrial, don&#039;t let the addiction get in the way of a good time. be well brother.

				Do not surpass 4,000mg of Acet in 24 hours or half of that if you are drinking at all.<br /><br />This is important! Or, do a CWE.

				that&#039;s really interesting Phader. So if i take ten and do your method and am left with the brown residue how much of that do i take to equal, let&#039;s say, two percocets?

				Just weigh out the return you get at first and divide that by the number of pills you used.<br /><br />So, let&#039;s say you get 50mg of the brown stuff (totally arbitrary number, btw) and you used 10 pills, then about 5mg brown stuff = one pill.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				one more thing, what results should i expect? The cook went great. I did 5 pills and scrapped up the residue. I noticed a quicker more calm and euphoric effect than taking a couple pills which generally gives me a lot of energy and winds me up a little bit. This cook was more relaxed and sweet. Sound about right?

				While Daft gave you the general idea behind a cold water extraction, you seriously need to do more research and have some experience before it&#039;s safe to rely on this method. <br /><br />Using too much or too little water can result in almost no acetaminophen being taken out, and the damage to your liver being just as bad.
