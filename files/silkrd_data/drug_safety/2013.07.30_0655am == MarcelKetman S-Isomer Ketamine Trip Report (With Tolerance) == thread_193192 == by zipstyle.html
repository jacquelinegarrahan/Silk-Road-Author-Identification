				8 lines are divided on a plate, each line is about 1 inch in length. I have been using small amounts (about 50-100 mg) per night, so that would account for tolerance.<br />+0:00 - First line insufflated. Slight burn but nothing too bad. Got the runny/drippy nose already.<br />+0:02 - Second line insufflated. No burn, just a little discomfort, as usual. I am starting to wonder how bad ketamine is for the nose, as far as how quickly it wears out the lining. Still no effects.<br />+0:04 - Nose is really dippy. Keep having to suck the snot back in (ew). Feeling a little light-headed, evolving into something a little wobbly.<br />+0:05 - Ah. Familiar static-y buzzy feeling coming on, like a frequency wave being tuned in. This is coupled with a feeling of relaxation starting to spread. It is a cold kind of relaxation though, not like an opiate which feels warm. Brain feeling slightly zonked.<br />+0:07 - Buzzing feeling increasing, I anticipate the chomp chomp chomp (or is it womp womp womp?) that accompanies the ketamine experience. Feeling significantly sedated at this point. Lethargic, don&#039;t really want to move. Ew. Just got the drip in the back of my throat :P<br />+0:10 - Vision is starting to have the choppy quality, I can feel my brain almost being lifted out of my head... does that even sound right? More like I can feel the connection between brain and body being tampered with.<br />+0:14 - Third line insufflated. Hardly felt it go up, nostril is pretty runny now. (Is my nose fucked up? Note to self: check out nose structure things next time you see a doctor. It&#039;s probably nothing, but better to check than not know anything at all). Feeling more dissociation, that is a static-y feeling accompanied by a high tone in my ear, numbness in the face and body.<br />+0:18 - Harder to read, vision getting choppy. I feel pretty damn good though :) Relaxed, closing my eyes would probably give me a stronger experience right now.<br />+0:20 - Entered the space where, in meditation, one could &quot;re-program&quot; the mind. I am running through previous thought sequences and reactions and thinking about how I would like to adjust them in the future. Very easy to look at self critically from a place of care and love rather than a place of anger and resentment.<br />+0:27 - Did lines four and five. The external world is definitely more &quot;static-like&quot; if that makes any sense? Everything seems to be re-drawn over and over again really fast before I can actually notice that&#039;s what&#039;s happening.<br />+0:30 - I feel like I am controlling my body from within, if that makes sense. Like this body is a shell that I am using to carry out what I need to do. I start thinking about life, marriage, cultures. <br />+0:33 - Feeling &quot;head ruffles&quot; like when you realize your head muscles are tight and then they loosen its like a wave. Vision much more difficult.<br />+0:36 - On the edge of K-hole? Interesting territory where gravity seems to be shifting <br />+0:?? - Forgot what time is <br />+1:20 - Woke up, was lost in k-space for quite some time.<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />And that, kids, is why we go slow. That way, we know what&#039;s going on. <br />Zipstyle signing off :D<br /><br />Thanks to MarcelKetman for the strong and pure S-Isomer Ketamine.&nbsp; <br />Yawning now and feeling clean as a whistle. Good experience as always :)

				Hello all! <br /><br />Sorry for the slow reply. <br />The k-space is just like the empty space you have when you close your eyes, except it&#039;s more space-like. Like if you were an astronaut floating through outer space. Or rocketing. I don&#039;t know, I would assume that it varies from one person to the next. K-space is very much like a dream and is similar to the DMT headspace in that regard, but it is much &quot;slower&quot; if that makes any sense. There are no rushing revelations or beams of enlightenment. Instead, it is a slow process of understanding the true nature of the moment. Turn DMT inside-out and I think you may be close to a ketamine trip lol. <br /><br />As for the amount, I would venture to say I did about 150-200 mg. Maybe slightly less?
