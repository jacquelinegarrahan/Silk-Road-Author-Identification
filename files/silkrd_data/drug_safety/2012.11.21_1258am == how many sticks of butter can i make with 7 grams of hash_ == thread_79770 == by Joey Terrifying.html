You might want to consider adding a third stick if you have above-average quality hash just to make measuring doses easier. But it&#039;s pretty much just a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />Straining the butter is not really necessary but it does of course increase its quality. The hash doesn&#039;t &quot;fuse&quot; with the butter which is good for us: The oily part of the hash (the stuff you want) goes into the oily part of the butter (fat) and the rest of the hash (probably mostly cellulose) goes into the water. Many people don&#039;t use water but it&#039;s a really good idea because it saves you the trouble of straining the butter. You can simply let the mixture cool down until the butter becomes solid, take the butter out and you&#039;ll see that most of the unwanted stuff went into the water.

				hey, thanks for the reply.&nbsp; so maybe to start i&#039;ll try 2g and change in 1 stick of butter.<br /><br />never done the water thing, but i just saw a video where they did this.<br /><br />so i just melt a stick of butter in a cup or 2 of water, dissolve the hash in the butter, let it simmer for a bit, and then put it in the fridge?&nbsp; thats it?&nbsp; all the stuff that separates into the water is just junk?

Pour the mixture into a container that is preferably tall and narrow. The reason behind that is that some of the cellulose gunk will stick to the underside of the butter layer and you&#039;ll lose some of the butter when trying to scrape that shit off. A tall and narrow container minimizes the surface area of the butter touching the water, thus minimizing the amount of cellulose sticking to your butter, thus minimizing impurities and slightly increasing yield.<br />Note that if the cooling process happens too quickly, some of the butter won&#039;t solidify into your main butter &quot;brick&quot; but will rather form little droplets and these tend to be impure, giving them a bitter taste. For that reason I like to avoid using a fridge and instead let it cool at room temperature in a metal container (plastic containers keep the heat in and it&#039;ll take fucking ages for the stuff to cool down).<br />My favorite way to ingest cannabutter is to dissolve a tablespoon of it in hot chocolate. Tastes fucking amazing too :D
