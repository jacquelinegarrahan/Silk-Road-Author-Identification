				Okay, I posted this somewhere else but would like to see if SR could give me some advice as well (hell, I got it from here).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, so quite a bit ago (I&#039;d say 3 weeks to a month ago) I dropped acid for the first time. I&#039;m not 100% it was acid, as I had zero experience with psychedelics beforehand and zero experience with drugs (literally had done nothing but a few hits of weed, of which I did not get high off of), but I&#039;m pretty confident it was based on the effects and what people I know said about it. The trip itself went fine, I was very euphoric and occupied for the vast majority of the trip but got very anxious near the end because I did it alone and my mother had awoken. The effects also lasted a lot longer than I thought they would (dropped at 11 pm, came up at midnight, was awake until 2 PM next day), so that added to my anxiety and my overall level of discomfort. I wouldn&#039;t say I had a bad trip as, despite being anxious, I wasn&#039;t flipping out and still knew I&#039;d be fine. I talked to my mother and told her the truth (she was fine with it - long story but she didn&#039;t flip out) and took a Xanax to calm down. I slept for hours but woke up fine.<br /><br />Fast forward a bit and there are no side effects that I could notice. Prior to dropping, I was having a bout of brain fog on and off in which my thoughts were hard to discern, which seemed to get worse afterwards (but could have been mere coincidence). Then, a bit later, I had a bout of what seemed like depersonalization/dissociation. I felt like myself, but I didn&#039;t really have an active thought process - everything seemed subconscious, so to speak - and would often speak without really thinking of what I would say. From what I&#039;d read, it seemed like a minor episode of DPD, but it seems highly unlikely that DPD would be caused by one pleasant acid trip (or any, for the matter). I decided it&#039;d be best to ignore it unless it got worse/persisted, and time seemed to make it better. Fast forward to now - nearly a month after the trip - and while the effects have gotten better, I wouldn&#039;t say they&#039;ve totally subsided. Additionally, before I go to sleep I seem to get a bit anxious for no reason, and as of last night, I&#039;m seeing something very weird visually. <br /><br />Last night, I went to the bathroom before bed in the dark and looked at the wall. I saw a kaleidoscope like thing (similar to something I&#039;d see while tripping, but not something I actually saw) which has persisted since. When I look at anything, when I go to sleep, close my eyes even, I constantly see this. It&#039;s a red circle in the center with a bunch of colors around it, it&#039;s in the center of my vision and the only way to describe it is kaleidoscope-esque, but even that isn&#039;t totally accurate. If I focus on something - i.e, writing, playing a game, etc. - it&#039;s not really noticeable and I only notice it if I stare at something intently. It doesn&#039;t seem to manifest as well, or at all, if it&#039;s a very very bright surface (i.e, this text box I don&#039;t really see it in) and if I close one eye it seems to be worse in my left eye.<br /><br />When I woke up today, it seemed gone, but I went to the bathroom in the dark again (different bathroom, but same style of wall/same house) and it reappeared. Could acid have anything at all to do with this? I&#039;m inclined to say no but have no idea what could be causing the problem. I&#039;m otherwise healthy, no mental illness, nothing I know of that runs in the family and nothing that has happened to cause any of the things I&#039;ve described. Nothing I&#039;ve read about describes really my symptoms, so I&#039;m getting a bit worried.<br /><br />Does anyone have any idea what could be causing it, if acid (or any RC) could cause these effects near a month later, and any idea where I could go for help? It seems really benign, but it&#039;s hard not to get worked up about and dealing with it while trying to sleep is not a pleasant experience.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Any thoughts? In reality it&#039;s fairly benign, as I said, but it&#039;s really disconcerting. I didn&#039;t expect anything this long-lasting with LSD or psychedelics, I have no history of genetic mental illnesses like schizophrenia in my family that I know of, and I&#039;m generally a very well grounded person. Anything to help/lower my anxiety would really be appreciated.

				Hey mate,<br /><br />1) I&#039;m not sure if you posted that somewhere else on the clearnet, but if you did you may want to delete this post. Its not a great idea to have anything linking your SR personality to your real life personality//things on the clearnet are traced fairly easily. <br /><br />2) It could be HPPD? I haven&#039;t experienced much similar to that, and I&#039;ve consumed a lot of psychoactive substances. It doesn&#039;t seem likely that any RC would still be effecting you after a month either. I thought I had HPPD at one point - and while it may have been true to some extent, I really just made the anxiety worse by constantly fretting over it. Do your best to forget that all that shit&#039;s going on and see what happens. If it persists for a very long time, I would seek medical attention if you feel its necessary. Granted, I&#039;m not a medical professional so take my advice with a careful eye!<br /><br />One Love

				This definately doesn&#039;t sound like real LSD but then again drugs effect everyone differently. I could have missed you saying it but did it taste bitter?<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				There was no taste, and I swallowed it within about 5-10 seconds, ruling out 25i-nBOME or however it&#039;s spelled (I believe that can&#039;t be absorbed via the stomach). I&#039;ve done some research on here and most accounts of people who got the same thing seem to indicate that it was LSD, though perhaps not the most pure on the planet.

				maybe its something completely different and all but the red circle thing sounds kinda familiar..altho mine wasnt from LSD <br />after abusing 6-apb (a drug similar to mda/mdma) alot/very frequently a period last year I had some visual disturbances (along with other crap,tho that lasted shorter) for months after.<br />it was like a &quot;blop&quot; (circle?) of color (reddish i think) with all kindsa colors around (&quot;psychedelic colors&quot;?).. it always appeared in the left side of my left eye at random times, and just for like a half second so I couldn&#039;t focus on it or anything.<br />i think after a few months it disappeared, then a few months later when trying to sleep, in the same spot (left in my left eye) i sometimes saw a shadow moving.. scared me a lil few times, but figured it was the same kinda thing that had progressed or something, I also smoked some meth around that time. Reading a little about it online I think it may be what some refer to as &quot;shadow people&quot;.. just for like a half sec it was as if something was moving, a shadow.. altho it was already completely dark in the room. <br />now about a year later i dont have any of this, must be 2-3+ months since I last saw the shadows, maybe 6months since the blop of color that was prolly dark red and surrounded by psychedelic colors was seen.<br /><br />hopefully whatever you got will pass too.. Id guess it will, would prolly improve faster if you stay off drugs and live healthy. be wary if it gets worse..&nbsp; &nbsp;hope u get better=)
