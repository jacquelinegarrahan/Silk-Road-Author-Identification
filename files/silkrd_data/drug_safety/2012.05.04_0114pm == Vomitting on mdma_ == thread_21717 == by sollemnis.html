				Ok guys I&#039;ve used MDMA many many times... I consider myself a verteran where MDMA is concerned... I love it! I&#039;m rolling hard now, but just 10 mins ago I was terribly sick all over my bathroom. I&#039;ve never ever been sick from MDMA in my years of taking it... Do any of you vomit from MDMA? Could it be the MXE I did yesterday thats done this to me?

				no its common for people to throw up with quality MDMA at an average does.&nbsp; I have only done it twice with the 1000&#039;s of rolls I have eaten but I know alot of people that do every time.&nbsp; They all say that after they throw up that they just sore so high.&nbsp; In fact I gave 160 mg of skyys product to a girl who has rolled alot a few weeks ago and she threw up.&nbsp; Back in the 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s you would see it all the time in the club lol.

				It&#039;s normal! Just a sign that you took a little bit too much in one dose. True about the 90ies - people would vomit into their beer glasses at the clubs because the bathroom was too far a journey :)

				In my experience, this seems to only happen when:<br /><br />a) You smoke too many cigarettes or too much weed (or both) while you&#039;re rolling.<br />b) You don&#039;t fast or eat light food during the day before your roll.<br />c) You parachute it.<br />d) You are abusing MDMA, and your brain needs a break.

				I read some where that there&#039;s serotonin receptors in your digestive track or around that area, so when the MDMA gets in your system and your body gets flooded with serotonin it&#039;ll give a false alarm that somethings wrong and the vomit reaction is triggered.

				Yeah this is common, especially with 200mg+ doses<br /><br />Did you do it on an empty stomach?<br /><br />For me I always eat something small like a sandwich about 20 minutes before, that seems to stop me yakking

So yep it&#039;s like taking too much speed which I have done before too and guess what about 2 g&#039;s in was hella sick so sick in fact mu uvula got so big I was chocking on it and thought I was gonna choke to death on it and had to deal with that. So keep in mind that mdma breaks down to amphetamine in your system (thats what you piss for on a drug test after 24 hours) and use amphetamine rules for OD in mind to include dosages.

				Best damn puke you&#039;ve ever had. right? :)<br /><br />High doses of MDMA can make you vomit, nothing to worry about.&nbsp; I remember going out the back door of a club once and vomiting all over the parking lot.&nbsp; My friends were a little concerned, until I looked up at them, wiped a few drops of puke off my chin with the back of my hand, and said &quot;I feel fucking GREAT! Let&#039;s go back inside, I can&#039;t hear the music...&quot;<br /><br />At least I made it outside.&nbsp; It would have stirred up quite a scene if I&#039;d done inside the club.

				&quot;Approximately 90% of the human body&#039;s total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the gut, where it is used to regulate intestinal movements.[6][7] The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS where it has various functions.

This makes the gut contract around the food.

				It&#039;s normal. I took 3 pills of &quot;Molly&quot; once. Not sure if they were cut or if they were 100mg each. Anyway, I puked so hard and thought I overdosed, but it was extremely euphoric nonetheless. As soon as I was done puking I started to have a great time.
