				I&#039;m getting some great stuff from a great vendor tomorrow and don&#039;t want to waste a drop of his precious nectar, i already tried blowing two pipes out those garcia vega things and i just am glass blowing challenged, I rigged a light bulb off of instructions off the net and it seems pretty good with a 4 inch bic pen for a tooter and a small whole for a carb but since its gonna be some of SE&#039;s bomb ass shit I don&#039;t wanna waste it, I got a couple of syringes should i just say fuck it with the lightbulb and IV it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated and feel free to flame away because I&#039;m so glassblowing challenged i can&#039;t even blow a decent garcia vega pipe. Thanks in advance for any help offered I hate to snort stuff as top notch as his because I heard snorting hurts the bioavailbility so much.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(

				yeah, it works OK. You could just set the unopened lightbulb on the stove for a couple mins and let the internal&nbsp; gas pressure blow a hole in it also, then take out the filament crap. Ive even heard of people grinding a hole by rubbing on concrete. Lightbulbs seem to give alot of air in the hits compared to pipes, but youre less likely to burn your material because the glass is uniform and always has a cooler spot to run from the heat.

				you should invest in a meth pipe. from experience i have learned it makes your product last longer. you can order one from vicious off the paraphernalia section on SR. also, view Priscillamarie&#039;s thread about properly smoking meth. She was nice enough to include a video, that changed my black puddles to never ending clear ones.

				I smoked some meth off foil and nothing was wasted. I got every smoke puff that came up. Although I just got a slight headache and that was it. How much meth is someone supposed to injest? I have a fairly high opiate tolerance but not meth at all.

				it isn&#039;t good to smoke tin foil, because tin foil does oxidize, and you end up breathing those particles into your lungs. If you are a light user then 25-50 mg smoked should do the trick for a good 8 hours.

				It&#039;s perfectly fine to use light bulb as a vaporizer. Just don&#039;t forget that it&#039;s glass is not as thick, and it&#039;s easy to overheat your meth, which is not good. Check youtube for assembly guides. Try to avoid heating with torch lighter - it&#039;s too hot.

				If your a real high roller , you could smoke it off gold foil- nothing reacts with gold.<br /><br />20 years ago or so the shit we got never reacted with aluminum foil, if there were no hole, it would rock back and forth till it burned clean. Used to practically pop pieces out when it recrystallized too. God i miss the old days =(. Shit nowadays is all cosmetic and doesn&#039;t pack nearly the same punch as back then. Shit sharded all on direction, no criss-crossing or pinwheel crystal formation., and the freaking fog in the pipe was as if it were painted on.

				I&#039;d invest in a cheap meth pipe, it works better in my experience. But if you have no problems IVing it, go for that.

				All I used to do was:<br /><br />Hold the light bulb between my legs so it doesn&#039;t move around too much<br />Tap the bottom part with a hammer until it cracks <br />Pull out the filament<br />Pull out the glass bits (enough so you don&#039;t cut yourself and so glass bits don&#039;t fall in there) with tweezers or needle nose pliers<br />Pour salt in the bulb and shake it around to clean off all the paint<br />Then just stick a straw in your mouth and roll it like normal (Jack in the Box straws are extra big)<br /><br />If you did something like that, and you can keep your puddle liquid without burning it (I always sucked at multitasking and had someone hold my lighter while I rolled the glass) you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />They&#039;re right above about it being different from other sorts of glass (thinner and larger surface area).<br /><br />About snorting:&nbsp; I tended to prefer it.&nbsp; As I recall, it was a more mellow, longer high.<br /><br />People told me IV was crazy good (1/4 hitting your heart all at the same time), but &quot;it steals your soul.&quot;&nbsp; I don&#039;t know either of those from personal experience, though, so take it how you want.<br />
