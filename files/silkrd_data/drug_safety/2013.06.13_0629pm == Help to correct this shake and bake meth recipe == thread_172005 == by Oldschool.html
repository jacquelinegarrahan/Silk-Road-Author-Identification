				Would there be anyone with experience making shake and bake meth be kind enough to look over this procedure to help me correct the mistakes. All in the interest of harm reduction. Even a link to an up to date procedure producing greater yields would be fantastic. <br /><br />So far feedback has been :<br />1/3 cup Ammonium Nitrate and 1/2 cup 100% Lye is incorrect. Should be a 50:50 ratio going by molecular weight.<br />psudoephedrine needs to be added to the mix after the reaction is already occurring, not at the beginning like this procedure states.<br /><br />Hardware<br /><br />2 2-liter bottles (Clean &amp; dry, with lid)<br />1 1-liter bottle (Clean &amp; dry, with lid)<br />1 20oz bottle (Clean &amp; dry, with lid)<br />Approx 18&quot; aquarium tubing<br />Needle-nosed pliers<br />Small pipecutter (Or snips)<br />Measuring cups (1/3 and 1 cup size)<br />Funnel<br />Small tupperware container with lid<br />Baggies<br />Utility knife or razorblade<br />Coffee filters<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1. 1/3 cup Ammonium Nitrate (Get by cutting open cold packs. It&#039;s the little white balls. Be careful what you buy, some cold packs are ammonium nitrate-free.<br /><br />Other materials can be used, but we&#039;re going to do it this way.)<br /><br />2. 1/2 cup 100% Lye (aka Sodium Hydroxide. Available at hardware stores in the drain cleaner section. - Drano Crystals, or any other powdered lye works)<br /><br />3. 3 cups Coleman Camp Fuel (Engine starting fluid [diethyl ether], or VM&amp;P naphtha can also be used)<br /><br />4. 3x Lithium strips (Get by cutting open Energizer AA Lithium batteries - This YOUTUBE tutorial video shows EXACTLY how to get your Lithium strips)<br />YouTube - Get Lithium Metal From an Energizer Battery<br /><br /><br />5. 100ml NP solvent of your choice (Xylene or MEK is recommended - easily found at your local hardware store in the paint section)<br /><br />6. 3-4 boxes 120mg 12-hour pseudoephedrine HCl (PSE). The highest count you can find. (Sudafed or a generic equivalent. MAKE SURE PSE IS THE ONLY ACTIVE<br /><br />INGREDIENT.)<br /><br />7. about 1/3 cup iodized salt<br /><br />8. 4 capfuls sulfuric acid (Available as liquid drain cleaner.) OR muriatic acid (Also sold at hardware stores)<br /><br />9. Denatured alcohol or Isopropyl alcohol<br /><br />10. 1/8 cup of distilled water (Poland Spring or any bottled water can also be used)<br /><br />Prep<br /><br />1. Take the 20oz lid and cut a hole in it big enough to fit the aquarium tubing. It should be snug.<br /><br />2. Cut one of the 2-liters in half. Discard the top.<br /><br />3. Crush the pills into a fine powder. Use a coffee grinder, blender, or if worse comes to worse, hand crush them with a pair of pliers or something. Put the<br /><br />powder into a baggie. The beauty of &quot;shake n bake&quot; is you don&#039;t have to clean your pills to extract PSE. Just crush and toss in!<br /><br />4. Measure out and crush the ammonium nitrate (optional). If it is dry enough, go ahead and crush it. Not important that you do this, though. It helps ensure<br /><br />even cooking, but is not imperative. Put it in a baggie.<br /><br />5. Measure out the lye. Be careful not to touch this stuff. It eats anything organic (YOU) and also reacts with metal. Put in a baggie.<br /><br />6. Measure out the Coleman fuel or Naphtha. Put it into the 1-liter.<br /><br />7. Cut open the batteries. You must do this quickly because lithium reacts with moisture in air and will become hot, possibly catching fire if it is very<br /><br />humid outside. Use the pipecutter to cut the outer housing of the battery. Use the needle nosed pliers to peel down the housing to expose the strip. There<br /><br />will be a black strip in between 2 pieces of paper. This is the one you want. BE CAREFUL. LITHIUM STRIPS MAKE A SPARK WHEN THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH METAL.<br /><br />DO NOT TOUCH THE STRIP WITH YOUR BARE HANDS IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. DO NOT GET IT WET!!!!! Once you get the strip out of the battery, it can be stored in<br /><br />denatured alcohol, and will no longer react with air as long as it is capped. Lithium strips burn VIOLENTLY when they come into contact with water. Be<br /><br />CAREFUL!! Here is the how-to video again YouTube - Get Lithium Metal From an Energizer Battery<br /><br /><br />Go time<br /><br />1. Pour the ammonium nitrate into the 2-liter bottle (the one you didnt cut in half).<br />2. Add pills. Shake up to mix them together.<br />3. Add your 100ml Xylene or MEK solvent<br /><br /><br />At this point, you will see the ingredients starting to react, it will produce bubbles in the bottom.<br /><br />4. Add the lithium strips. Take them out of the denatured alcohol, tear them into smaller pieces, and add them to the mixture.<br />5. Add your lye MAKING SURE to cover your Lithium strips.<br />6. Add the 1/4 cup of water. The water kicks off the reaction, but YOU MUST GET THE CAP ON IMMEDIATELY AFTER ADDING THE WATER. Remember Lithium reacts<br /><br />intensely with water and is potentially dangerous. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but not violent, though the hydrogen produced<br /><br />can ignite. Do not add the water if your Lithium has not been buried and is UNDER YOUR LYE.<br />7. Add the Coleman fuel or Naphtha to this mixture.<br /><br />The mixture will be rolling now (it will look like it&#039;s boiling real hard). NOW THIS IS THE TRICKY AND MOST IMPORTANT PART: The reaction builds up necessary<br /><br />pressure inside the bottle, don&#039;t worry - you will need to let this react WITH THE CAP ON for at least 2 minutes. Let the Lithium do it&#039;s thing for a full<br /><br />120 seconds. Venting or releasing pressure within the first 2-3 minutes will greatly affect your final yield. After 2 or 3 minutes you will see the Lithium<br /><br />starting to get smaller, shriveling up into small Bronze foil looking balls with holes throughout. This is when you MUST VENT by slightly unscrewing the cap<br /><br />to release the gas.<br /><br />***AFTER THE LITHIUM TURNS BRONZE MAKE SURE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE BOTTLE! IT CAN EASILY BUILD UP QUICKLY AND EXPLODE IF NOT VENTED<br /><br />PROPERLY!***<br /><br />You can gently swirl (not shake!) the bottle side-to-side if you want, you don&#039;t have to. Swirling can only help the reaction.<br /><br />Be careful! The gas coming out of the bottle is straight ammonia. Do not breathe it and keep it away from your eyes. AVOID KEEPING THE CAP OFF OR VENTING THE<br /><br />BOTTLE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.<br /><br />You may have to add more lye throughout the process to keep the mixture rolling. Once every 20 mins or so. You may not have to, though. If you do, add about<br /><br />half of the amount as in the beginning, and do it quickly.<br /><br />For at least 45 minutes keep venting and swirling the mixture until it stops rolling and you have hard whitish balls (called bones) in the bottom of the<br /><br />bottle. This is a signal that the reaction is over. Let the contents react until you notice the whitish balls - sometimes will take 1-2 hours. Put a cotton<br /><br />ball in the funnel hole and 2 coffee filters over and filter the liquid into the 2-liter (the one you cut in half). Dispose of the trash accordingly. Use<br /><br />caution, the bottle and trash are noticeable waste items. Try to dispose of it in different locations. The trash can still be fingerprinted. USE YOUR HEAD.<br /><br />Gassing the liquid<br /><br />Now that the dangerous part is over, on to the DOPE!<br /><br />All ready smelling success? wait and see.<br /><br />****This is a smelly and violent process so you should do it outside if possible.****<br /><br />**WARNING**<br />***HCl GAS IS NASTY STUFF AND WILL RUST ANYTHING IN SIGHT! Make sure your tubing is completely airtight because you do not want leaks!****<br /><br />Take the 20oz bottle and put about 1/3 cup salt in it. Add 4 capfuls of sulfuric acid (or muriatic acid) and put on the lid you made with the aquarium<br /><br />tubing. Make sure it&#039;s tight. This is your gassing gizmo. Put the end of the hose just under the surface of the liquid and squeeze the gas into it. You will<br /><br />see the meth dropping or &quot;snowing&quot; to the bottom of the liquid. Such a beautiful sight. Pull out the hose and let the 20oz fill back up with gas again.<br /><br />Repeat this until the meth stops dropping as much. Filter the powder out of the liquid. This process is known as a &#039;pull&#039;. After the dope is filtered, you<br /><br />can do up to 3 more pulls from the same liquid. Usually the second pull is the best (most product, highest quality). You will have to re-mix the salt and<br /><br />sulfuric acid in the 20oz using fresh ingredients, because it won&#039;t last long. Make sure not to suck up any of the liquid into the 20oz, or you will have to<br /><br />make a new one. The gas inside the 20oz is a bad little dude itself, so use a twist tie or a rubber band to keep the tube closed (fold it in half and tie<br /><br />it).<br /><br />That&#039;s it. Let the meth dry on the filters, scrape it off, and voila. You can even use the filters in drinks to get high. The highest the dinosaur&#039;s ever<br /><br />been is off filters.<br /><br />Note: Rinsing your meth with DRY ACETONE (dry your acetone by baking Epsom Salts at 400f for 4 hours, pour the baked epsom salts into your acetone container<br /><br />and let sit overnight) If your meth burns leaving residue in your pipe and tastes nasty, a dual solvent recrystallization is highly recommended.
