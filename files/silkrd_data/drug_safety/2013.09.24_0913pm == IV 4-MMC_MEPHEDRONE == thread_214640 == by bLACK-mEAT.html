				Hey reader.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First off, let&#039;s just get this said right away. Injecting things is dangerous, bad for your veins, you can get HEP-C easily, you don&#039;t really know what your getting mixed in as cut with your shit, and generally, injecting is a bad idea. So now that we have covered that obvious bits let me ask the questions. My usually ROA is IV. I have plenty of experience with this method and different substances, but have never done 4-MMC. I have recently ordered a G of some really good sounding 4-MMC with 3 pages of RAVE reviews, 5/5, all say it&#039;s PRE-BAN, Clean, no come down and so I&#039;m looking forward to it! BUT, I have heard the negative things about 4-MMC and the cuts put in the &quot;bath salts&quot; sold when it was &quot;legal&quot; here in the USA. I hear it&#039;s pretty rough on the nasal passages and can even erode your skin when left on it for a bit. I have heard on other forums that it&#039;s incredibly easy to overdose, and have bad side effects making it not too enjoyable. But I have also heard it&#039;s fucking amazing and better than shooting meth or coke. I have shot both of those and enjoy it quite a bit. So, has anyone shot 4-MMC? Any tips? Any warnings? The floor is open to anyone with some worthy input. <br /><br />Thanks for reading! <br />Be safe on your adventures everyone!
