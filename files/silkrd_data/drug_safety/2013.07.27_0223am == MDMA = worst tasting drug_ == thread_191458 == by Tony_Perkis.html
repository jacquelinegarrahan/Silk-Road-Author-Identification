				I really like the smell, it&#039;s a sort of sweet yummy smell. I don&#039;t mind the taste either. Really I think of it like candy. I just lick it up. Grant it I do make that face like I just sucked a lemon because it is just so bitter and voltage-y, I like it!

				Xanax is really bad. I made the mistake of muching a 1mg tab recently, the taste made me almost throw up.<br /><br />MDMA is bad but anyone could tolerate a few mg of MDMA and if you wash your MDMA you will find that overpowering smell vanishes. Still tastes bad but I parachute it when I do use.<br /><br />Another bad drug is cannabis oil. A buddy actually ate half a gram of it raw on some toast spread with butter. He drank a gallon of milk to ease the taste. <br /><br />Hash is not nice to taste. I dissolve that in milk or olive oil. <br /><br />Eating bud would likely not only taste bad but actually do damage if it was not ground up. <br /><br />Last but not least, the taste of some alcoholic drinks make me gag. Gin is the worse one for me.

				I understand what you mean it can be bad. But I have come to enjoy the familiar burn and taste when I snort mdma. I used to have to use peanut butter right after snorting it or I&#039;d puke but now I can just do lines of it. I&#039;m not into setting it in my gumms or anything don&#039;t really like that. But dissolving in water is probly my most common method. <br /><br />I&#039;ve come to associate the burn and taste of snorting mdma with a complete body orgasm in about 20 mins so I think my body actually enjoys it now. Snorting mdma can turn it into a whole nother drug. The feeling is so intense. :-) but also being said comes with its share of side effects.<br /><br />I&#039;m taking a break from mdma now. Have to on account of well the last time I did it I ate 150mgs and snorted 250 so by the last couple of lines I wasn&#039;t even feeling any change. Guess it happens tho. Amazing night with an amazing girl lol. <br />

				By far the worse tasting thing I&#039;ve ever had is MDMA &amp; MDA dissolved in a really small amount of water and left in a warm bag overnight at a festival. <br />As well as the chemical taste that usually comes with putting pure crystals in your mouth, its literally had an after taste of rotting manure/fish that I couldn&#039;t get out my mouth. Nothing I&#039;ve tasted has ever made me so close to puking. <br />Love the smell of sassy MDMA though, one my favorite smells! Think cos it brings back so many good times.

				Try dissolving those 100mg morphine sulphates, with xanax and hydrocodone mixed in water, not the whole thing at once but man that taste is naaaasty but the effects are quite nice :) I dont do it anymore but it was a good buzz for me, i&#039;d mix it a container using about 6-7 ml of water depending and end up with 9ml and put it into syringes removing the needle and do 1ml at a time now that was the worst taste ever, wish I had mdma to put in there at the time lol that would be a great mix imo :D

				I don&#039;t understand why you would say mdma is the worst-tasting drug when you could easily wrap it in a rizla and bomb it without tasting a thing. But shrooms on the other hand are fucking disgusting and impossible to avoid since the lemon tek method gives the greatest effect.

				The only time I didn&#039;t use a cap to bomb was with 2CI as it was so powerful only neede to lick the tip of my index finger and dip it in my bag lightly and place on tongue. But fuck it tasted horrid. Usually had a beer/bourbon chaser immediately after. But you know how when you taste something so bad it takes effort to work up to swallowing. Did gag on some occassions. And when it went down, boy did it cause my face to flush and eyes water. The RCs are definitley the worst tasting! As for methylone and snorting, or mephedrone in old days, just love the drip cause I know it&#039;s really time for it to kick in.

I am not actually positive whether it was 2CT-7, I got LSD from Ace and lots of experienced members said it was either 2CT-7 or DOM or something. I tripped HARD as FUCK for like 12 hours<br />and continued tripping at work the next day. I was doing telemarketing at the time and had one of the best days of my career numbers wise that day, lol. I was a fantastic trip but very uncomfortable....I would never do it again.....I had circulation issues for almost a month after the trip :( Hey Jack, need any trimmers?&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That was a DOX chemical for sure.&nbsp; 2C-T-7 only lasts like 8 hours when you snort it and does not fit on blotter. :P<br /><br />DOX chemicals are speedy and last too fucking long!&nbsp; Bromodragonfly REALLY lasts WAY TOO FUCKING LONG!&nbsp; Three day trip! :o
