				There are a # of drugs you can get away with while on probation.&nbsp; Favorite one being LSD.&nbsp; However, do felony probation drug tests in the USA test for AM-2201 or Ketamine?&nbsp; I recognize there AM-2201 is banned in my state and there is an ongoing pressure to ban spice in all 50 states.

				As far as I know you will only be tested for the SAMHSA-5:<br /><br />Cannabinoids (marijuana, hash)<br />Cocaine (cocaine, crack, benzoylecognine)<br />Amphetamines (amphetamines, methamphetamines, speed)<br />Opiates (heroin, opium, codeine, morphine)<br />Phencyclidine (PCP)<br /><br />Read more at:<br />http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/testing/testing_info1.shtml<br /><br />It&#039;s also worth mentioning if you were caught in possession/use of a drug, it is more likely to be tested for.<br />Ie: if you were caught with MDMA, they are more likely to test you for MDMA.

				It&#039;s a crap shoot really. Probation departments get sales pitches from the companies selling the drug testing kits so there&#039;s no standard test everywhere. This is an excerpt from a drug testing faq I got off a link in the&nbsp; ovdb forum here:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Learn what test is being used.&nbsp; There are three that are quite<br />common.&nbsp; The EMIT, Abuscreen (RIA), and ToxiLab (TLC).&nbsp; If you find out<br />that<br />they are doing Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry (GC/MS), then you<br />are totally screwed.&nbsp; The GC/MS is the chemical equivalent of finding<br />a needle in a haystack.&nbsp; It finds EVERYTHING and is IMPOSSIBLE to cheat<br />on.&nbsp; Fortunately, GC/MS is VERY expensive, and it is only used for<br />confirmation tests.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry about it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The EMIT test does NOT scan for LSD, RIA does.&nbsp; If you use ethyl<br />alcohol or barbituates, RIA does not scan for them, but EMIT does.<br />Also, nothing currently scans for Ecstasy, Psylocybin, mescaline,<br />or nicotine.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are in the military, you are going to be tested with RIA.<br />The majority of federal agencies screen with EMIT.&nbsp; Private sector<br />companies split between EMIT and TLC.&nbsp; No problem.... all are about<br />equally beatable.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Using that information, you can probably get a better idea of what will be detected based on which test your PO uses. Public sector purchasing contracts should normally be a matter of public record so you could be able to track down which one they use that way.

				While testing for things outside the standard 5 (and usually oxycodone and methadone) is very uncommon, it&#039;s not something that you can rule out.<br /><br />One day my county decided to test the Drug Court people for synthetic pot, and nearly half the program failed and got sent to jail.<br /><br /><br />And as a general note of caution on the subject of drug tests, you can&#039;t always rely on the 72-hours thing either. I failed once for cocaine 10 days after using only 1/2g in a night. A couple of my friends also had that happen. I suspect it was related to being prescribed high-dose oxycodone we all had.

				You should also watch out for the possibility of false positives. For example, DXM, a legal dissociative, is chemically very similar to opioids (it was actually first synthesized from opioids) and it has been known to flag the most common opioid tests. I have also heard that ketamine and MXE can flag PCP tests, but my source on this is far from reliable.

				It should say on your paperwork that you sign what drugs they are testing for. My paperwork shows exactly what is being tested. They can even detect alcohol through ETG testing for up to 5 days. That being said, my state has recently switched to the insta cups to save money on lab fees. These cups are no joke and can detect up to 14 different substances. Google search 14 panel drug screens and you will find plenty of info. Basically, anything can be detected in urine. ANYTHING. It all depends on whether your state wants to pay for it.

Because that is absolutely wrong. I was on felony state drug offender probation for 4 years (ending around a year ago), and how it actually worked was the 5 panel combo was the uncommon thing. They had individual dipsticks, and they would test different things each time. In addition to the 5 standards, my probation office had urine dip sticks for oxycodone, methadone, and buprenorphine that they personally used on me, and several more in the room. My girlfriend is currently on the drug court program for 18 months now, and they have a 12-panel urine test every week.<br /><br />Policies vary from state to state, and even office to office. Maybe your office only tested for the 5 with EMIT strips, but they exist for nearly everything and are most certainly used at some offices. Typically they&#039;re slightly different than home drug tests too, which aren&#039;t typically EMIT. And *usually* it&#039;s only sent to the lab to confirm a positive EMIT dip stick with a GC/MS test.
