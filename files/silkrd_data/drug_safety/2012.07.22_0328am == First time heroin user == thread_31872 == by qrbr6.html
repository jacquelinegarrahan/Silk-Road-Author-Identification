				I plan to use heroin for the first time in a few weeks. Now before people say how bad it is, I know and I&#039;ve done my research. I&#039;ll only be purchasing a little bit, enough for a dose for a friend and I. What I need to ask is what vendor I should go with, what type or heroin should I use and how much for a beginner&#039;s dosage? Keep in mind I&#039;ll be snorting it. Thanks for your time guys.

				Your best bet is to get a couple of stamp bags from deluxedelivery silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6039990770&nbsp; &nbsp;get 3 bags which will only be 60$ and im sure that will keep you and your buddy going for a little while.

				If you have a low tolerance to opiates than i would start with 1/2 of a bag. if you need more than continue. its important to start low and move your way up. if you should decide to order powder heroin (not stamp bags) start with 25mg.

However with other drugs I&#039;ve researched the smoked and insulfated doses have been on par with each other, so perhaps that is a guide?<br /><br />Above all else I&#039;d be starting really small until I know how I react to it personally.

				Forget trying to weigh shit out because your not doing IV anyway...just grab some #4 heroin dosent really matter from who and start with small hair lines like I mean very small lines.If youve ever done coke as comparison the lines im saying would be 1/3 of what a regular coke line wold be. Wait ten minutes or so between them until you get were you want to be. Thats it easy squeezy 8)

				You said your tolerance was low because you&#039;ve never done H before, however, other forms of opioids (rx pain pills) do have an effect on your H tolerance.

				keep in mind the heroin you get here is mabey 50% pure. if you dont do opaites regularly DONT DO HEROIN. if you arent opiate tolerant 10mg of oxycodone will get you where you want to be.

				I&#039;ve never done any other opiates. Don&#039;t worry guys I wouldn&#039;t follow the 100mg idea without researching it first, I am just using this thread as a starting guide. And I&#039;m not going to start shooting it up, this is a one time thing, I&#039;m just buying enough for ONE DOSE.
