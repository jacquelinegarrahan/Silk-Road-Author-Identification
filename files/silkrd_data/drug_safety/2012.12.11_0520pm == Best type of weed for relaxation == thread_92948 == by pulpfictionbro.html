				I agree with Ballz, although I have heard some people say that strong sativas can cause further mental anxiety, personally sativas help my anxiety but we&#039;re all different! <br /><br />I have been munching on a sample pack of cookies that Novartis sent me (here&#039;s the listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2e7bb1099e) and they are delicious and extremely relaxing. I just ordered some canna-cornbread from SpiritDoor but it&#039;s not listed anymore.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92948.msg654837#msg654837">Quote from: Ballzinator on December 11, 2012, 05:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92948.msg654794#msg654794">Quote from: pulpfictionbro on December 11, 2012, 05:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Not a first time smoker but I have been off weed for months.<br /><br />I really didn&#039;t care what kind of weed I used to buy but now I am just looking to get something that will help me relax and relieve some of the anxiety and stress that&#039;s built up in me.<br /><br />What can you suggest?

				A good choice would be an indica/sativa hybrid in the realm of 75%/25% or greater.<br />I find that the longer a grower lets his buds flower,the darker more amber the buds are.In my opinion Most cash croppers grow indicas because they yield MUCH better than sativas but then do the dis-service of pulling early which doesn&#039;t allow the full spectrum of cannabinoids and such to develop.What you are left with is an INDICA that is very racy and completely the opposite of what you&#039;ve intended to smoke.sorry for the rant,I&#039;m a weed snob and like helping people find their strain of choice.<br />Good luck.

				A good kush if you want to sleep or reduce pain. ( purple kush is the best ive tried for both insomnia and pain relief )<br />As said the sativa family is more of an uplifting creative type high, Northern lights 5 was a good smoke and didnt so much numb the pain as made forget to think about the pain if that makes sense, so<br />I think that might ease your stresses.<br />Or go for a high CBD strain, like bubblegum - that made me giggling for hours.<br />hope you find the one your looking for my friend.<br /><br />Peace
