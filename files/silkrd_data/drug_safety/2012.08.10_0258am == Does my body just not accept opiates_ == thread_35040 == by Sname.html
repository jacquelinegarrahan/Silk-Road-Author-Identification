				Does anybody with opiate knowledge and experience know if some people simply do not respond pleasurably to the drug? I&#039;ve taken low dose vicoden a few times years ago and it did virtually nothing for me. Today I decided to try opiates again and it just made me nauseous and uncomfortable. I took one full percocet 5/325 and another half score of a second via oral administration on a full stomach. I then crushed the other half score up and snorted just a few lines, perhaps only 15% of the total powder I crushed up. Therefore, I estimate total dose was about 8 mg oxy with around 500 mg acetaminophen; a very low dose indeed. Still though, I just felt anxiety, higher body temperature, and light nausea. My &quot;high&quot; was totally non euphoric yet still a pretty strong feeling of just being really out of it and dimwitted. <br /><br />Does anybody know why this may have occurred? Do some people just respond unfavorably to the opiates? I also never take tylenol, much less snort it, so I considered that as a possible reason too. I had no other drugs or alcohol in my system. Your thoughts? <br /><br />

				I would never snort acetaminophen (tylenol, paracetamol). I would almost guarantee that&#039;s what made you sick. That had to have been a massive amount of powder too. Also just 1 5mg perc is not very much, depending on what you had eaten and stuff I don&#039;t know if you would have felt the effects fully, even with snorting that bit.

				Nausea is a very common side effect of opiates, it has nothing to do with the acetaminophen. It&#039;s worse for some than others. When I take oxy, I always swallow a cyclizine at the same time. It&#039;s an anti-emetic and gets rid of the nausea pretty effectively. Also, 8mg is a tiny dose... If you don&#039;t weigh much, 10mg might be enough, but for the majority of people 20mg really is the minimum dose for recreational purposes. And as already mentioned, the powder you snorted was probably not even absorbed very effectively because the bioavailability of oxycodone is only about 40% when insufflated where as it can be up to 90% when taken orally.

				Thanks for the responses! I figured the snorting was a bad idea, but I took most of it orally. I figured the dose might be too small for recreation, but I didn&#039;t expect it have a negative result. I suppose next time I will try a higher dose and only take orally. Or perhaps I will just stick to the numerous drugs I know I enjoy and leave the opiates alone.

				without going into whether it&#039;s a good idea or not to begin using opiates, i would agree with what others are saying about snorting APAP. <br /><br />i can&#039;t imagine snorting a hydro or a percoset would be very pleasant. oxycodone has a lovely oral BA so there&#039;s really no reason to snort any form of it, but especially no formulations containing APAP<br /><br />also, i add that my own first few personal experiences with opiates were rather similar- sweaty, upset stomache, and vaguely itchy... an infinite number of opiates later, i almost wish it had always stayed so unpleasant. dope is pretty hard to dislike, if you keep taking it (maybe 2 percs next time) i think you will learn to enjoy it&nbsp; ;)

				I have gotten a friend of mine to try opiates repeatedly with me, different kinds and different ways, and every single time she gets incredibly sick and does not enjoy it at all. For the life of me I don&#039;t understand it, opiates are the cat&#039;s meow for me. But I guess some people just don&#039;t get the euphoric effects off of it like others.

				I just posted in a thread about a guy withdrawing from Hydro so it&#039;s fresh on my mind.&nbsp; For the record i love opiates so this is not a lecture, but if you don&#039;t enjoy i would stay away because the withdrawal is brutal.&nbsp; I need to research more on the oral vs. snorting because i love to snort, but it sounds like i may be wasting some of the buzz???!!!

				well said wetdog, thats what i was just going to say.&nbsp; If you&#039;re only messing with 1 - 1.5 perc 5s at a time...run faaaaar away from those things.&nbsp; im battling a 10year opiate addiction that started with popping a 5/325 and snorting 1.... because of those first two percs, ive had needles in my arms and everything else.... the withdrawal and addiction just ain&#039;t worth it man.&nbsp; I wish i could go back and take this advice myself! ... but to each his own, and i don&#039;t want to lecture... just be smart man! and do it in moderation.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure any opiate addict on these forums would tell you the same thing, so enough beating a dead horse, eh?

				i have a naturally high tollerance to opiates. when i first started using them it took 20mg of oxycodone to get me where i wanted. now it takes atleast 120mg of oxycodone to get a nod on. some people are lucky enough to get off from 5mg of hydrocodone but for some it takes much more.

				My body doesnt accept opiates either, ive tried eating/snorting/IV&#039;ing (once, eghhh) and i spent the whole time puking and getting the spins. From my experiences the type of people who get off on &quot;killing pain&quot; are generally ones who are emotionally dead/damaged to begin with, so slowly killing their inner essence feels good, basically darwinism at its finest. <br /><br />Be glad you have enough love inside you not to end up a zombie like the rest of them. <br /><br />
