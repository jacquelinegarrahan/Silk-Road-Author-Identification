				Hey guys, I recently purchased 100 tabs off DudeRugs probably about a month ago now.<br /><br />I stored them in just a mini-fridge to keep them cool to be safe even though I don&#039; think that&#039;s essential but I thought why not?<br />Now a few days ago my friend opened the fridge just to put something else in and noticed the tab&#039;s were soaking (I wasn&#039;t present). There was a size-able amount liquid gathered at the bottom of the fridge and the tabs themselves were very damp.<br /><br />Now nothing else what-so-ever was in the fridge and nothing was damp above the tabs. I also tasted one and it wasn&#039;t very bitter at all and when I&#039;ve had them before they&#039;ve been extremely bitter. I also haven&#039;t had the time to test them unfortunately.. but I have little hope!<br /><br />How did this happen? I have literally no previous experience with storing blotters however I thought just in the fridge was fine?<br /><br />Thanks in advance

				They&#039;re so cheap, I&#039;d definitely just buy some more. For most drugs, I wouldn&#039;t worry about storage too much as long as they&#039;re not in a really hot room or something. Even my tryptamines have lasted over a year with minimal degradation without any cooling.
