				been a member of SR for about 10 months now, when i first found the Road i just thought &#039;sweet, a reliable hookup for some decent cocaine and some good pills&#039;. i&#039;ve always been curious about all sorts of chemicals, and ever since i first heard of it all those years ago heroin had intrigued me, seeing Trainspotting and hearing about the &#039;almighty rush&#039; sounded pretty fucking good to me (obviously how bad they got in Trainspotting was pretty offputting but i thought i could control myself pretty well), especially as i love the feeling of coming up on a good E or MDMA, so heroin had to be better, right? it was inevitable i&#039;d eventually try it, but i didn&#039;t know anyone IRL i could ask, and more to the point i didn&#039;t want to ask about due to the stigma associated with H.<br /><br />anyway, it took me about 2 - 3 months to work up the bottle to actually order some, i ordered a quarter gram. when it arrived on my doorstep i shit myself a little bit, and was worried about doing it right up until the point where i snorted my first bump, a tiny little bump that if it was coke or MDMA i would not have even noticed a difference in feeling or mood. this tiny little bump of H (#4) got me nodding pretty hard, i was fucked up for a good few hours. i didn&#039;t get the rush you hear so much about but after this amount of time dabbling i&#039;m pretty positive the rush only comes from IV&#039;ing, and needles are just not my thing, but it felt pretty fucking nice all the same and all my worries just melted away.<br /><br />the day after this first bump i felt fine, i was thinking &#039;yeah, this is all right, if i have a heavy week at work i can just kick back with a little bump on a friday and forget about all my troubles&#039; and i weren&#039;t clucking for more. so for the next couple of months, probably every 2nd or 3rd weekend i&#039;d kick back on a friday night with a little bump of H. even spacing it 2 or 3 weeks apart i built up a fair tolerance pretty quickly so the bumps were getting slightly bigger and after an hour or 2 i&#039;d re-dose to the point where i was doing 4 bumps in a night. at this stage i started being sick after the 3rd or 4th bump, so it was glaringly obvious i was doing too much, but that rarely stopped me from doing another one a little later on. the day after these little binges i felt sick ALL day, threw up repeatedly in the morning and couldn&#039;t hold any food down until evening time, then by that time my stomach had shrunk and i couldn&#039;t eat much anyway. i never bothered doing any more H the next day though, as i didn&#039;t want to get into the habit, and the following day i&#039;d wake up fine. <br /><br />i ran out of the quarter g after a couple of months, so i thought i&#039;d get a bit more in so i could carry on with my 2 - 3 weekly session, so i got some more #4, a gram this time. it wasn&#039;t as strong as the first lot i got so the bumps were probably twice the size of the original lot but with enough it still got me where i wanted to be.<br /><br />i don&#039;t know whether it was due to having such a bigger amount or just because it&#039;s really habit forming (probably both), but my 2 - 3 weekly sessions turned into every friday night (fuck it - this amount will last me ages), then every friday and saturday, and after a particularly bad wednesday at work i went home and had a bump that evening, and for the past 3 - 4 weeks i&#039;ve been having a bump every night of the week after dinner. was only ever just one bump during the week &#039;to chill out after a heavy day&#039;, and again 3 or 4 on a friday and saturday night. it never bothered me just doing the one on the week nights as i woke up the next day feeling fine, and all the while i was thinking &#039;i don&#039;t need to do one tonight, but i&#039;m going to anyway just because i can&#039;, and my body was still functioning fine - i could go to the loo normally (i had heard H bungs you up but i never experienced any of that so &#039;obviously i weren&#039;t doing enough to mess with my body that much&#039;), and if anything my productivity at work was up. no sign of withdrawal at all the next day during the week, but again after the 3 or 4 on a friday i was waking up sick as fuck the next day. <br /><br />had my last bit of H on the friday just gone, i thought i might as well have a bit of a session with my last bit and then leave it for a while, it&#039;s getting a bit too much of a habit, so i had a proper blowout on friday, puked a bit then carried on with it, then woke up saturday feeling a bit sick but managed to sort the house out, cook dinner and just carry on as normal, albeit a bit of a struggle. by saturday night i was feeling fine, didn&#039;t drink any booze, obviously no H because i didn&#039;t have any, and i think i had 1 joint all day. i had a good 9 hours sleep, then sunday morning i woke up with real bad flu-like symptoms, shivers, feeling sick, and every part of my body ACHED like FUCK. since sunday morning i&#039;ve been running to the loo every hour and pissing out of my arse. this morning i don&#039;t feel fluey but my back is still aching and i generally feel as if someones beaten the shit out of me. obviously my body has built some sort of physical dependence on the 1 bump nightly thing. i&#039;m not actually craving it at all, the whole time i was doing it i never felt as if i was craving it, but its obvious my body is missing it. i had another 9 hours sleep last night and this morning i feel completely fucking drained, still aching all over like i&#039;ve been beaten up and i can&#039;t concentrate on anything at work. i don&#039;t feel sick at all, i&#039;m eating normally although my appetite has dropped a bit and i&#039;m still running to the loo every hour. i have absolutely no desire to get any work done today and i&#039;m just waiting for home time so i can eat something and go to bed again.<br /><br />if you are thinking of trying heroin i hope the above puts it into perspective for you - i&#039;m not saying don&#039;t try it - of course it&#039;s up to you, but if you do be prepared for the sneaky fucker working it&#039;s way into your daily life. i never did any at work or during the day, it was only ever a evening/nightly thing, but even then it&#039;s managed to make my body depend on it, even though i have never had a craving for it the way smokers would crave a cigarette. if you can stick to doing it once or twice a month you should be ok, but i thought i could do that, and even though i did for the first few months, it was there burning a hole in my pocket and nagging away in the back of my mind, then it started working its way into my weekly routine, especially after a stressful day at work.<br /><br />so i&#039;m done with this shit, it was fun while it lasted, but i feel our relationship has run it&#039;s course. i&#039;m just glad i managed to get out now before it turned into a real life horror story<br /><br /><br />for the record - IMO coming up on a pill feels better than H, but i can only speak from snorting H, not IV&#039;ing.<br /><br />RD <br /><br /><br />

				I am glad for you that you have decided to draw a line under it mate, I have seen too many friends go down that road and some of them never came back.<br />It is a pernicious little drug, it creeps up on you and then suddenly it is starting to take control.<br />Please try to stay off it, I have tried it and really liked it so I promised myself to never ever buy any. Fortunately I purposefully never associated with people taking or selling H so the issue never really came up but now it is all there for the taking on SR so it has taken quite some self control to not order any. I feel strong enough not to and your story helps that. I know it&#039;s been shit for you (literally as well as figuratively) but it has helped me say no, just like Zammo should have. Hopefully it will help others who may be on the fence too.

				Raoul this post just confirms to me why my personal policy on Smack is &quot;Fuck Smack&quot;, reading that post as I was getting towards the end I was actually getting quite worried about you because of it&#039;s creepy bastardness that it was exhibiting on you. <br /><br />Anyway you handled it like a boss so long as you keep away from that shit. To be fair, I&#039;m not going to lie that I&#039;ve always been curious as to what Smack feels like. It&#039;s just a drug takers natural curiosity which I would say most people that take drugs have but what stops me actively going to try it is the fact that it comes with that creepy bullshit and the dirty come down/withdrawal you mentioned. <br /><br />Nuts to that.

				yeah it was definitely curiosity that started it, but i imagine everyone in the proper grip of addiction starts off that exact same way. i know if i did a bump tonight i&#039;d feel fine tomorrow, but that&#039;s back into the vicious cycle. thought i better post something, that way in a couple of weeks time when i&#039;m feeling back to normal, not aching or got the 2-bob-bits and i&#039;m thinking &#039;maybe it weren&#039;t that bad&#039; i can read this again, i think that&#039;ll be enough to put me off getting any more.<br /><br />i just never got the &#039;withdrawal&#039; you hear about or saw in trainspotting, which made me think it&#039;s not affecting me that way, but after a couple of days of not having the 1 tiny little bump i feel as though i&#039;ve been hit by a truck.<br /><br />well it&#039;s an experience chalked up.... it hasn&#039;t put me off trying anything else, i&#039;m still keen to give opium a go, but i think it&#039;s enough to put my frame of mind in thinking &#039;buy it once, enjoy it, then leave it the fuck alone&#039;

				Opium is very very nice, havent had any for more than 12 years but I still remember that warm cosy feeling.<br />I would give it a while for the smack to leave your system though mate, you don&#039;t want to get sucked in again.

				Yes, that one&#039;s the killer. It&#039;s never good when you convince yourself that a little bit more of anything is the answer to withdrawing from it.

				Raoul do you think you&#039;d ever order it again?<br /><br />For me it&#039;s been similar, though the curve has been steeper. I think I first ordered a point of #4 maybe 2 months ago. I think I used it all in a weekend.<br /><br />Then I ordered a g of #3 international, it was the same price as the point - I remember thinking at the time &quot;this will last me 6 months&quot; and it was gone in two weeks. <br /><br />Even when I&#039;d set myself the rule that I&#039;d only use on weekends. I was doing lines, it didn&#039;t make me sick, though I did get nods and mad constipation... plus not even being able to piss just made me think &quot;why the fuck do people do this?&quot;<br /><br />Yet I found myself ordering more... and eventually worked up the courage to shoot it IV. I&#039;d had experience IMing ketamine and MXE and had the needles there, I thought why not?<br /><br />Then the first rush... was so disappointing! My favourite drug combo is LSD and nitrous and FUCK that gets me high. I&#039;m one with GOD. <br /><br />I was into trainspotting, it used to be a favourite movie, I read the book, I was expecting the best orgasm I&#039;d ever had times a million and what I got was maybe a crap orgasm times two.<br /><br />And yet it&#039;s sort of because H is not really that great I find myself ordering more. I&#039;m not addicted. I know if I keep using I will be, but it seems like the line between control and out-of-control is so far away. Plus with the Silk Road being my only source, I have to wait weeks before I &quot;score&quot;. But then that means it&#039;s &quot;okay&quot; to do it during the week, or say thurs-fri-sat because towards the end I have to &quot;get rid of the evil shit&quot;.<br /><br />If there was an H dealer living next door it would probably swing me one way or the other, but with SR it&#039;s like I&#039;m sitting in the middle and kind of losing by default, slowly conning myself into thinking it&#039;s okay... and ordering no more than .5 gs a time because I just tend to binge on whatever I have, and I know a whole G would leave me fucked up.<br /><br />What to do? There&#039;s some serious shit going on in my life atm and h is such a nice escape... yet unlike weed I can function as life requires...<br />

				Scary stuff Duke, <br /><br />I was a functioning H addict for 12 years... I dabble now and again and then move onto other things, its a tough lesson to learn, but it&#039;s easy to get complacent with H!! <br />You just gonna tough it out then? - A couple of Co-Codamols will take a slight edge off... I mean a slight edge!<br /><br />Give it a couple of days and you&#039;ll be right as rain, the best thing is, you can pass it off as flu!! No-one will be the wiser!<br /><br />Take it easy dude!

				I had pretty much the same situation as OP except I cut it out a lot sooner. I first tried it a couple weeks ago, binged for a night and then felt like shit for a few hours the next day. Then did a few bumps in the week, and the comedown was just too much of a fucking jew. I can do one bump and feel no ill but 2+ and that&#039;s when the shit starts to kick in. <br /><br />I might still do a single bump every now and then but there&#039;s no way I&#039;m doing more than that.

I couldn&#039;t rail enough to k-hole, and that&#039;s what I wanted to experience. When I did IM the first time, I k-holed and the experience was deeply disturbing. Yet there was something just so fascinating about it, and it&#039;s a real escape (much more than H imo). Time is seriously, seriously warped. I feel I&#039;ve lived for millennia during those hour-ish long K sessions. But (luckily?) that ran out eventually... I replaced it with a huge MXE order but the timeline on that is different (real, not perceived) - it&#039;s stronger but takes longer to come up and MUCH longer to come down - and the come down isn&#039;t that pleasant at all - for me it&#039;s all rolling vision and dry mouth. If I was able to look at something or sleep (or nod) it would be a lot more addictive!

To be blunt using Smack as a crutch is one of the most naive things I&#039;ve heard on here. If you use it as a crutch you will just become an addict very quickly because you will use it more frequently than someone using it recreationally. If you are going to use Smack that is up to you of course, that&#039;s your choice to make as an independent human being. However NO drug should be used as a crutch...that way lies madness and dark shadows. <br /><br />Not trying to be mean to you hear, I&#039;m just being real.

				Om may not realize it, but he already is an addict.<br /><br />The line that if he had any he would of already done it is the very text book definition of an addict. No offense mate, I am too. <br /><br />For me, H and SR has saved me. In my area it is roxy that is the drug that is everywhere. After my first dose of H, around a month ago, I have had no desire to do roxy, and given they are close to 40 each here, that makes it easier.<br /><br />I have ordered H from the road twice now. <br /><br />My first time was two bags, shared with a friend, and had a very nice afternoon.<br /><br />Second time was a gram and I think I almost overdosed. Ran up .12 and stumbled around the kitchen for God knows how long barely conscious. I didn&#039;t fall, just stumbled around from the looks of it. <br /><br />I am much more frugal and rational with my SR purchasing. It was nothing for me to get paid and go blow most of my check on roxies. Now, Im buying money pak&#039;s, which arent as exciting as roxies. So I am much more rational with it. But who knows how the long term of this will play out. I am only two orders in, and buying a money pak tomorrow.

				A year or two ago I tried percocet for the first time. Loved it, so I&#039;d relax after a hard week and do a 30. Eventually a friend asked if I wanted to IV it. I decided to take as many precautions (sanitize, break down the pill as much as possible, etc.) as I could, and I went for it. Not to say I didn&#039;t enjoy it, but I didn&#039;t &quot;take off&quot; and feel the need to shoot it every time. Months later, the same friend offered heroin. So I IV&#039;d that too, and I must say, it was a lot more enjoyable. But I threw up for almost 15 hours afterward, so that put me off of IV&#039;ing opiates. <br /><br />Since then, I shot up/sniffed heroin 2-3 times a month until around a month ago, when I quit. It was a nice feeling, but not worth the potential headaches and vomitting that usually followed. I&#039;m glad to say opiates just aren&#039;t my thing. I find pleasure in them, sure, but I&#039;d rather relax with a glass of Parrot Bay, or smoke a (very) small bowl of weed, than deal with the ugly aftermath. Now, stimulants (especially e) on the other hand...<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll sum up and conclude that it&#039;s possible to be a &quot;weekend warrior&quot; with opiates. But I would recommend you start with ones other than heroin, and if you find yourself liking (but NOT LOVING) them, perhaps move onto harder ones. But if you take painkillers and you think they&#039;re the bee&#039;s knees, maybe stay clear of brown.

				Raoul, the same thing happened to me about two years ago with some pills. I got ahold of a bunch of hydros, Roxis, and Oxys. At first I just wanted to see what the hype was about. Then I discovered that I really, really, really loved combining them with Adderall. It was like a poor man&#039;s speedball. I was so functional, so mentally perfect, I didn&#039;t realize that it went from an occasional thing to a couple days in a row type of deal. I didn&#039;t think I was physically dependent or addicted, so when I ran out of opiates, I didn&#039;t bother getting anymore. I didn&#039;t feel like I needed them.<br /><br />Bam! Felt like I had the worst flu of all time. Totally non-functional and destroyed. Since I was naive as to what was really going on, I truly thought I did have the flu. I thought dependency would take more time and higher doses to begin. I was so wrong. Diarrhea, headaches, just general malaise. It didn&#039;t last terribly long though, so I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be back to feeling fine soon enough.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t abandoned opiates entirely since then, but I never push the dosage and I never push the frequency. It&#039;s a once in a blue moon, usually in low-dose with something else, type of deal now. That withdrawal is just pure physical nastiness. <br /><br />Thanks for typing that up, was good warning as to how insidious some of these things can be.

Found a cheap source of Vics and found that a Vic or 2 and I could move again. Add in 1/2 an adderal and I could really move and I wasn&#039;t too spun, I thought.<br /><br />Well, a little more for Santa Clause, and a little more. And now I&#039;m running out and doing a mini WD every month and then 2 weeks off before getting more. Hard to explain getting sick every month.<br />Then another source turned up, more expensive. Now I&#039;m 1 1/2 years in and had a 1 day WD here and there before finding more. That sucked but it was getting expensive.<br />Back to H. A pill for the pain and H to keep the monkey off. A little methedone here and there too. It&#039;s great to have one pill last almost 24 hours.<br /><br />Then I went cold turkey a couple of weeks ago. Pure hell but not as bad as an IVer (just snorting and or caps here) with a big tolerence I&#039;m sure but bad.<br />Then I got my regular cheap Vics.<br />The pain was still there and my job is physical. So I was down to 1 vic a day and not too bad a Jones in the morning.<br />Then Noriega&#039;s order showed. I really didn&#039;t expect that. I should have locked it away for a day when it might be needed, really needed like after a firefight or something.<br />Now my tolerance is creeping back up and I have to decide, more H or the WD again. I have benzos stocked for relief, some. My trick was a little meth and benzos. I would take a few benzos and fall asleep.<br />An hour, maybe 2 later I wake with my skin crawling. Out to the man cave and drink booze and smoke meth until morning when I&#039;m exhausted and can come in and get another hour or 2 of sleep.<br />This for 4 or 5 days. Then a few hours before waking but still out to exhaust myself so as to get a bit more sleep.<br />Naturally I had to call in sick for a week, lucky I can do that most times.<br />NO energy. Could barely move. If I had to fight under such conditions I&#039;d be fucked. That&#039;s the worst part.....helplessness.<br /><br />Only about 3/4 of a gram left and going fast as it&#039;s not great. Good but not great.<br />Decisions decisions........<br />Maybe Tony&#039;s will show now :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t do H if you have an addict personality. Not unless you have the stones to do WD.<br />It kinda sneaks up and gets you by the booboo.

				Opiates are one of the best feel good drugs going.&nbsp; But eventually you have to pay for all those good feelings.&nbsp; Eventually, and don&#039;t kid yourself, you are going to run out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe you don&#039;t have the money to buy some or your connection disappears or you miscalculate and run out before you can get more.&nbsp; Then you pay.<br /><br />Withdrawal from opiates is fucking horrible.&nbsp; The more you do, the worse it is when your body runs out of it.<br /><br />If you are someone with a truly iron will, able to do a few hits every once and awhile, fine, but for the other 99% it just doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />Years ago I could get high on one perc.&nbsp; At one point I had a connection for 200 OC80&#039;s (old school) every couple of months.&nbsp; You would think 200 80&#039;s would be enough to get you through two months but eventually I would always run out.<br /><br />Then the 80&#039;s dried up, so, whats next?&nbsp; H of course.&nbsp; But its all just a big circle.&nbsp; High for awhile, sick for awhile, high for awhile.<br /><br />It becomes very tiring.&nbsp; Going for methadone was the best thing I ever did.&nbsp; I tried detoxing and all that shit, because I thought it was hard to get onto meth.&nbsp; When I found out how easy it was, I kicked myself for not going sooner.<br /><br />Now I only do the shit occasionally, never more than what my meth will allow me to recover from.&nbsp; But even then you can screw up, but at least the W/D&#039;s are mild, usually lasting a few nights, when the meth dose you take in the morning wears off. <br /><br />I&#039;m slowing working down on the meth, so eventually I&#039;ll have to take that big leap of faith and stop altogether or the ride will just start over again.<br /><br />When I think of all the money I spent on drugs in the past 5-10 years it gets depressing.&nbsp; I could have bought a new house, a cottage or a condo in Florida.<br /><br />So, if you are thinking of trying opiates out, give it some serious thought first.&nbsp; The occasional perc or small oxy (5-10) to get a buzz on a Saturday night is all you should go for.&nbsp; Never buy in quantity, because if you do, you will take them, every last one.&nbsp; Then you will know what I mean by &#039;horrible withdrawals&#039;.<br /><br />In the, do what you want, that&#039;s what SR is for, just be aware of what you may be letting yourself in for.<br /><br />Well, that&#039;s my two cents worth for today. :)

				Phoned in sick today. Still feeling completely drained, achey, rough, had a fucking headache for about 16 hours now and my guts still very delicate. Slept a bit better last night though despite the headache and had a lie in for a couple of hours. Wish I had a Valium, I reckon that would sort me right out today - no work so I can just completely quim and watch a few films I downloaded after reading lims &#039;boss films&#039; thread. Watched gangster no 1 the other night, that&#039;s a quality film.

				Hi Hassan,<br /><br />Yes, getting off methadone can be even harder than H.&nbsp; As you say, everyone is different, I&#039;ve met some people who have been on meth for 10 years.&nbsp; Some people swear by it, some hate it.<br /><br />Most places now offer suboxone as well, which from what I hear is 100 times easier to get off then methadone.&nbsp; Personally, I like the meth and I haven&#039;t had too much trouble lowering my dosage.&nbsp; I figure when I get down to really low numbers I&#039;ll look into moving over to subs instead.<br /><br />The only thing I don&#039;t like about subs is you have to be already in w/d before starting because if you aren&#039;t it will put you into w/d quite suddenly, something nobody wants.<br /><br />As far as going cold turkey, I&#039;ve been there, done that. If you have a fairly large tolerance, going cold turkey can actually be dangerous.&nbsp; And we aren&#039;t talking about a couple of days here.&nbsp; It can take 5-7 days before the worst is over.&nbsp; Imagine the worst flu you have ever had and triple it.&nbsp; You&#039;ll dehydrate, throw up, you can&#039;t sleep, even with benzos.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been through medical detox.&nbsp; Lot&#039;s of promises, you&#039;ll be comfortable, that sort of thing.&nbsp; It was fucking horrible.&nbsp; By the 4th day I asked for some meth and it went much easier after that.&nbsp; Of course I fell off the wagon 6 months later.<br /><br />What it all really boils down to is do what works for you, and plan ahead, be prepared to be off sick for a week at least.&nbsp; But if you have a real problem and just cannot manage on your own, look into finding a place that will prescribe subs.&nbsp;

				I have always had respect for opiates. Lost a couple of friends due to od over the years and know a few others who have a real bad habit with H now they all started out using not very often, but what amazed me is how fast their addiction accelerated once they lost control. Of course the curios druggie in me want to try it, but i have concluded it&#039;s not worth it. Good story Raoul Duke and i hope it gets people to think it through before they try H. I wish you all the best and i have to say i have never been so worried for a stranger on the internet before so i was actually happy for you when i was finished reading your story. Hang in there :)

				By the time I went to #4 I had been snorting JonnyDepps tar which was more like OPI&#039;s pebbles than tar.<br />I had about a 10-12 norco a day habit by then and wasn&#039;t getting high anymore and got some fake oxi 40&#039;s that might not have been all fake. H, phentanal, I don&#039;t know but I sucked the paint, literally paint, off of one and crushed and snorted and man, what a difference.<br />Had a lot of those and by the time that was done I was ready for H again which was JohnnyDepp. Then got some Oxi liquid. That was nice but it pushed tolerance out of the ballpark.<br />Then OPI and Tony in one week and then PJ. Then Heisenberg, after a bit of trouble getting it. Damn good.<br />Then the Big Sale....nothing for 2 weeks. WD, cold turkey.<br />Then my 7.5 Vics came back. 2 of those and I was pain free AND high again. I weaned down to 1.....sometime 2 a day.<br />Then that fucking Noreiga went and sent my shit. Bastard, I&#039;ll bet he did it to fuck me.<br />Well, here I am nodding on a 1 point line of #3, an 8mg dillie amd a 2 mg Xanax, with a snort or 2 of water and acetic acid #3 mix from my &quot;bottle&quot; trying to type this and get some work done.<br />Gonna lay down now and hold my gun for a while.......GOTHCA!!!! No... I&#039;m going to nod my way through my work and take a nap and prepare for WD if I work up the stones to do it agian.<br />Kill me? Ha! !&#039;m made of fucking steel. <br /><br />Duke...listen to me carefully. A few more days..., eat right, lots of water, use St Johns wort amd mellatonin for sleep, take more when you wake up. FORCE OF WILL to keep moving along with a bullshit story of whatever bug you thing you may have had to explain yourself.&nbsp; A few more days and the hard part will be behind you. Then the mental part will be with you......a long time.<br />The only way to get rid of that is to have something in direct conflict with drugs that you rank higher in your value scale. A career, a girl, your friends or family.<br />When the physical part is beaten that is the only way to beat the mental part.<br />NOT hanging with people who use is important, the ones who make it look easy. It isn&#039;t and they lie.<br /><br />Then, when it&#039;s all over....ask yourself: &quot;Can I do this again?&quot; Some can, some can&#039;t. If I hadn&#039;t mixed meth in I could have pulled it off........till I nodded behind the wheel and drove into a tree I suppose so the real answer is NO.<br />

				To anyone that wants to try H ..... my advice is dont do it for more than MAX 4 days in a row and after your 4 day binge is up take about a week break. Youll still feel a bit of withdrawls but nothing seriouse....to do it this way never buy more than about 5-8 bags at a time because if its there in your hands youll do it all and wont stop after the 4 days. You still have to have somewhat of a strong will to not buy again during your week off (especially if your dealers next door) but the benefits of this on/off method include low tolerance, mild withdrawls, and last but not least...you spend less $$

				In the end it comes down to quantity.&nbsp; Be careful about doing bags.&nbsp; One bag may have .1g and another might have .2-.25<br /><br />So you could go through anywhere from .5g to 1.5g in those four days, and your body is going to notice when it doesn&#039;t get any more.&nbsp; I&#039;d say do it in 2 day increments, then stop for a few days.&nbsp; You are much less likely to build a tolerance that way.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking for years for something that will help when things run dry or I&#039;ve miscalculated.&nbsp; There is all sorts of crap on the internet talking about things you can try to alleviate the wd&#039;s.<br /><br />One of the things I had read about was poppy seed tea.&nbsp; Well, I finally decided to give it a try.&nbsp; I went of to Bulk Barn, bought several pounds of seeds and used 500-600 grams of them to make a warm poppy tea.<br /><br />Son of a bitch, it actually worked.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been playing catch up between my meth and the 2.5gs of OPI&#039;s stuff I did over the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; The past few nights have been uncomfortable to say the least.&nbsp; My dose is lasting longer, but still wearing out around 6.&nbsp; I drank the tea about 40 minutes ago and I got a nice little buzz going.&nbsp; Nothing major, but more than enough to get rid of the wd&#039;s and let me sleep well tonight.&nbsp; Hot damn. :)

If you have a fairly large tolerance, going cold turkey can actually be dangerous.&nbsp; And we aren&#039;t talking about a couple of days here.&nbsp; It can take 5-7 days before the worst is over.&nbsp; Imagine the worst flu you have ever had and triple it.&nbsp; You&#039;ll dehydrate, throw up, you can&#039;t sleep, even with benzos.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been through medical detox.&nbsp; Lot&#039;s of promises, you&#039;ll be comfortable, that sort of thing.&nbsp; It was fucking horrible.&nbsp; By the 4th day I asked for some meth and it went much easier after that.&nbsp; Of course I fell off the wagon 6 months later.<br /><br />What it all really boils down to is do what works for you, and plan ahead, be prepared to be off sick for a week at least.&nbsp; But if you have a real problem and just cannot manage on your own, look into finding a place that will prescribe subs.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Subs are a fucking god send.<br /><br />That being said, since I started vending, the monkey came back with a fucking fully auto machine gun....<br /><br />I mean I need at least 0.2g(0.45g to get high) in the morning to just get out of bed comfortably.. I def need to get back on subs, but I just can&#039;t stand being in withdrawals.. and going from 0.4g of like 80% pure heroin is a fucking nightmare.. I mean within 18 hrs of last dose my knees are in pain, If I could cut them off I would...&nbsp; Subs gave me a rescueline.. I mean I went from heavy H addiction and basically failing classes, to being the top student in my program... I really need to get back on subs for my finals.. I can&#039;t be all nodding out on H not giving a shit about anything other than getting high. I remember taking the 2 hr trek home on public transit just to go get high.. and that was 4 hrs round trip to be home for 10 minutes to do a line.. <br />&nbsp;I have gotten to the point now where Its too much powder to snort(almost half gram)... And my sinus&#039;s are so fucked that they are just plugged full of the thickest mucus all the time.. <br /><br />I am def going to detox after next week as I will be done with school and more than likely will end up purchasing a fuck-ton of xanax and just being knocked out for the entire week. <br /><br />If I could go back and never try H I would..... <br />

				Thanks for all the support guys, it is appreciated. back at work today. Still dont feel &#039;normal&#039; and my stomachs still pretty fucked but not feeling half as ropey as I did. Been on a proper downer since last night though, it&#039;s real difficult to get motivated to do anything but having a day off work yesterday has built up a busy day for me so I can keep my mind occupied. <br /><br />Thinking of getting a bit of MXE or Ket in as I&#039;ve read theyre both good for depression (and chemically induced or not i&#039;m prone to depression), or just something to get my mind straight. still got about half gram of coke stashed but from experience that&#039;s only good for an on-the-spot depression fix, whereas I&#039;ve read MXE or K is good for a few days at least. Fuck it - I&#039;ve toughed out the wds even though i know it was definitely a minimal version of them. Got to be better than getting more H though ain&#039;t it? Not that that&#039;s an option, my mind is still 100% as Limetless eloquently put it &#039;fuck smack&#039;<br /><br />I don&#039;t regret trying H as it would have always been at the back of my mind about what it&#039;s like, but I do regret getting the second lot in which put me in this position

				@Raoul thanks for the updates, glad you&#039;re slowly getting better.. just reading about it is making me take this whole situation a bit more seriously, which is exactly what I need... I sometimes forget to pay H its proper respect.<br /><br />And nope ordered H from nori, though I checked the calendar the other day and it hasn&#039;t been that long considering where I am... but half of me hopes it never shows.<br /><br />@Limetless Yeah I guess I am using smack as a crutch... but I&#039;ve got a broken leg! I need that crutch (metaphorically). But yes, point taken, thanks.<br /><br />And I think that if someone says they&#039;ll wait until they&#039;re older (to try h) we should support that - the longer someone puts it off the better chance they have of never starting.<br /><br />Very much appreciating the support group here... quite a friendly little corner of the forum, especially for a heroin thread!

				My brother had tried different dopes from eating real fresh poppy pods to hitting real snow white #4 to crystal meth and is now doing a weekly H. However he finds the taste of H aweful and disgusting and DOES NOT USE IT SOLELY FOR PLEASURE OR DRUNKEDNESS. If you do, prepare to be hooked. <br /><br />Lil bro has great will, has quitted certain dope and when through tough training. Weed is definitely better than H in his opinion. Not to mention meth. Meth is so euphoric but you will not be hooked once you know it can be toxic to your body, unless you wanna exchange your life span for pleasure.

				Yup.&nbsp; All Opiates are.&nbsp; Its really just a matter of strength.&nbsp; Eventually, if you take enough of any type of opiate your body will become accustomed to the drug and when you stop, it will tell you in no uncertain terms that it wants more.

				^^ probably yeah. i seem to be ok when first trying something, it&#039;s when i have a lot of it things go tits up. it was with H anyway, if i just left it after the first order was finished i wouldn&#039;t be going through this now. i&#039;ll just make sure i don&#039;t order it more than once, and on top of that i&#039;ve spoken to loads of people about opium and they ALL wanna try it, so i doubt i&#039;m gonna get more than one smoke out of a gram. anyway, as i said before i&#039;m waiting until all opiates are out of my system before i even look at buying it.<br /><br />anyways - morning people :) if for some completely insane reason reading the OP doesn&#039;t put me off buying any more smack, if reading about yesterdays shenanigans doesn&#039;t then i deserve to be dead in the gutter:<br /><br />went to work yesterday as i weren&#039;t feeling too bad, still groggy, still a bit of a dodgy gut but not running to the bog every hour, no headache and able to put together coherent sentences. when i got in from work last night i was pretty knackered. made a very bland dinner of meat and veg, didn&#039;t even have gravy in case it set my gut off again, and then curled up on the couch with the other half. was starting to think &#039;sweet, nearly ridden this one through&#039;.<br />About 9ish i was falling asleep on the couch so i left her on the couch and went to bed, read my book til my eyes were heavy, about 10ish, then she came to bed and it was lights out. after staring at darkness for about an hour i went to the loo and again lie awake in bed for what seemed like eternity. checked the clock - 1.30am. FUCK. went downstairs, had a joint and a can of lager i had in the fridge, read my book in a semi-dark room and went back to bed about 20 minutes - half hour later, when my eyes were getting heavy again. stared at darkness for another eternity and checked the clock - 3am. by now i&#039;m not even fucking tired any more. got up, rang reception at work to leave a message&nbsp; &#039;still shitting like a bastard, not going to be in again today&#039;. thought now i don&#039;t have to worry about going to work later it should relax me a bit and i should be able to fall asleep easier. did it bollocks - half 3 i&#039;m back up again and thought fuck it, watch a bit of TV and have another spliff and i should be good to go. 5am i&#039;m still wide awake but it was getting light outside so thought i better try to sleep so went back to bed. next thing i know i&#039;m lying there with my eyes closed the fucking alarm goes off - 7am. see her off to work and go back to bed and finally manage to fall asleep. for 2 measly cunting hours &gt;:( so i&#039;m back up now, wide awake but so fucking tired i&#039;m barely able to make myself a cuppa.<br /><br />so i&#039;m changing my stance from the OP slightly - <br /><br />heroin = shittest drug ever. don&#039;t try it, nothings worth this shit. coming up on a pill feels a lot better anyway, and at least the comedown only lasts a day

				Opiates are opiates.&nbsp; Use them frequently and any of them will work their way into your daily routine.&nbsp; I was an oxycodone addict for years, long before I ever decided to try heroin.&nbsp; I finally tried heroin when I was laying around dopesick, and watched a friend go from dopesick to nearly instant wellness.&nbsp; The transformation was amazing, I was fucking sick and tired of being dopesick, so I blasted off...<br /><br />After that first IV rush of heroin, I never looked back, and remained a junkie for about three years.&nbsp; Decided to check myself into a clinic and taper myself down from 40mgs of methadone to nothing in about four months.&nbsp; Took me about three months to feel normal again after that.<br /><br />Spent another six months clean and hated every fucking minute of it...&nbsp; Like there was nothing to look forward to.&nbsp; I knew I was never gonna preach eternal abstinence, that I loved smack so much that I could never live out my life without experiencing that joy again.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to...<br /><br />I chip pretty regularly these days.&nbsp; Use for about 3-5 days, then take a week off, sometimes 2.&nbsp; I usually only suffer mild w/d symptoms at the end of a run, sometimes none at all, but compared to full blown withdrawal it&#039;s a walk in the park on a beautiful spring day.<br /><br />I know I can&#039;t play every day without dire consequences, and having been an addict for many, many years, I have learned when enough is enough...&nbsp; Where I have to draw the line.&nbsp; I love heroin.&nbsp; I will always love heroin.&nbsp; If I live to be an old man, I hope to still be indulging occasionally, because I have never, ever in my entire life felt as joyful, excited, and content as I do when I can get high on smack.&nbsp; I&#039;m social.&nbsp; I&#039;m productive.&nbsp; I don&#039;t fall out with a rig sticking out of my arm.<br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve experienced such joy, it isn&#039;t like I can just unlearn it, forget that I know what it&#039;s like- it&#039;s burned into my fucking soul, and I don&#039;t regret it for an instant.&nbsp; It is truly one of life&#039;s greatest pleasures, and I enjoy it like some people enjoy fine cigars or vintage wine.&nbsp; There are different flavors, subtle differences in the high...&nbsp; The variety is nearly endless.<br /><br />One more personal observation I&#039;ve gained from years of experience:&nbsp; Do not kid yourself- there is NO DIFFERENCE between a pill junkie and a needle junkie.&nbsp; Withdrawal is withdrawal... it&#039;s all fucking hell on Earth, and it all fucking sucks.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never shared needles, and I always have practiced safe injection techniques.&nbsp; You would never have known I was hooked on the needle to look at my arms, or anywhere else on my body. Never assume that you&#039;ll recognize a junkie when you see one, and never believe that an addiction to pills is somehow &quot;better&quot; than an addiction to smack.<br /><br />So be careful out there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen opiates of ALL FORMS turn good lives into total train wrecks, myself included.&nbsp; I was savvy enough to pull up before I completely crashed and burned, but it had as much to do with luck and timing as it did any innate skill of my own.<br /><br />But like I said, I don&#039;t regret it for an instant.

				@ Raoul - wonderful post, and if anyone is reading this thread - please - don&#039;t think this won&#039;t happen to you.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying 100% that it will, but I have only met a few people that have &quot;tried&quot; H.&nbsp; Even OC&#039;s and Roxi&#039;s are hard for most to just try.<br /><br />If you want, I will send you some xanax (hell, I&#039;ll even send you bitcoin to get some if you are uncomfortable about a random stranger knowing your address, but I bet mine would get there faster)&nbsp; Don&#039;t get addicted to those tho - just take one at night to sleep, to keep your head quiet.&nbsp; That was my worst part w/ wd&#039;s - the sadness that comes along w/ it.&nbsp; For me, xanax pushes the mute button.&nbsp; Not a reg user, just once a month type thing on the xannies for me.&nbsp; Don&#039;t need any more addictions :)

				Lil bro just nodded the hell out yesterday, it was the Heroin Day lol, tried it on 007&#039;s dope and smoked 3 MH, then got a drunken feel and then nausea set in. After that a nodding session, well actually he didn&#039;t nod, he literally had to rest his heavy head and went into Wonderland with some waves of mental orgasm. I realized it&#039;s better to use H if you ain&#039;t working out or exercising.<br /><br />He also became somewhat like a zombie, just felt good staring into space and not moving. Well this morning just woke up good sleep, no hangover whatsoever, quite refreshed even as he is typing lol.<br /><br />Whether H is bad or good is subjective, I think it&#039;s therapeutic though, if you are hopelessly hooked then it becomes evil.<br /><br />MH=match heads; my new abbreviation lol

				To the OP: you are already through the worst of the withdrawal, you should feel noticeably better each day. The tough part, as always, will be staying off it in the long run. You seem to have an honest desire to stop, so I say good. Drop the shit, and don&#039;t ever buy H again. You never shot up, and that is a huge deal. The needle is a one way street, there is never any coming back to totally normal after that. That first rush is what seals it in your memory forever. Take a tip from a long time junkie, ok? You never hit the needle, that means you got a GREAT chance to quit now! I know sometimes it&#039;s tempting to try and only dose every weekend, but for most people that is never sustainable. Shit, I can&#039;t tell you how many times in my life BEFORE I hit the spike, I would be sick like you, get clean for a while, then still come back for some of that dope -- popping pills, snorting them, smoking tar, and eventually shooting it, that&#039;s how I went, most people I know too. What I am saying is you haven&#039;t gone too deep yet, get out and get out NOW!

				felling pretty much 100% now guys n gals :) got to admit i did have a bit of a coke session on Saturday, drank an obscene amount of beer and wine with it as well but that&#039;s what happens when i do coke. had the 2-bob-bits again yesterday but i don&#039;t reckon its opiate related ;)<br /><br />i wrote the OP pretty much as a reminder to myself to not bother with it again once i&#039;m feeling tip-top, i honestly didn&#039;t expect so much support on the subject, so thanks all of you, it did help. i&#039;ve also had a couple of PM&#039;s saying &#039;thanks, i was on the verge of giving it a go but after reading your thread it&#039;s made me think twice&#039; - i&#039;m glad its helped some people side-step this situation, it really isn&#039;t nice and i wouldn&#039;t wish it on anyone.<br /><br /><br />DMoT - careful mate, your post is ringing bells of familiarity!! what do you mean a couple patches?

Heh, yeah... Definitely a step in the wrong direction. Once you start trying even more powerful opiates (and you&#039;re already at oxy, eek!) it&#039;s only a matter of time before you&#039;ll be shooting H. I&#039;m really sorry, I hate to generalize, and for all I know maybe it won&#039;t happen to you -- but it does happen to quite a lot of people who go down that road. Plus you said you even had it in your cart on SR and abandoned it, which is good. You don&#039;t want any heroin, believe me on this, just stick with your oxy&#039;s and be happy you&#039;re not an H addict. What I&#039;m saying here is I think you&#039;re are at a crossroads in your adventures with opiates right now. You can continue using pretty responsibly like you have been, or you can choose to go in even deeper and most likely wind up addicted. It is such a slippery slope I just hope you are careful. Hopefully you don&#039;t think I&#039;m being presumptuous about you, it&#039;s just that going deeper into more powerful opiates is almost never beneficial in the long run. BE CAREFUL MY FRIEND! IMO stay away from the patches, don&#039;t order any H, keep it at your current level or maybe even back it down some. Always remember, you are messing with some serious life-ruining shit here, this ain&#039;t weed anymore. I&#039;m sorry, I read back on this post and I sound like such an alarmist, but I&#039;m only trying to look out for you and everyone else on here, and I feel like being straight up and honest is the best way to do that.

How exciting!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Reading this has persuaded me to not try it and to also take a closer look at my use of pills..my tolerance has been going up and frequency is up to 3 days a week now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get w/d&#039;s except that I shit like crazy after 2 or 3 days of not doing any.<br /><br />I just came across a couple patches today from my guy who practically gave them to me...I really want to try them but this has we wondering now If I even should.&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; Damn I want to...but is it just another step in the wrong direction?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m assuming you mean fentanyl patches? Heh, yeah... Definitely a step in the wrong direction. Once you start trying even more powerful opiates (and you&#039;re already at oxy, eek!) it&#039;s only a matter of time before you&#039;ll be shooting H. I&#039;m really sorry, I hate to generalize, and for all I know maybe it won&#039;t happen to you -- but it does happen to quite a lot of people who go down that road. Plus you said you even had it in your cart on SR and abandoned it, which is good. You don&#039;t want any heroin, believe me on this, just stick with your oxy&#039;s and be happy you&#039;re not an H addict. What I&#039;m saying here is I think you&#039;re are at a crossroads in your adventures with opiates right now. You can continue using pretty responsibly like you have been, or you can choose to go in even deeper and most likely wind up addicted. It is such a slippery slope I just hope you are careful. Hopefully you don&#039;t think I&#039;m being presumptuous about you, it&#039;s just that going deeper into more powerful opiates is almost never beneficial in the long run. BE CAREFUL MY FRIEND! IMO stay away from the patches, don&#039;t order any H, keep it at your current level or maybe even back it down some. Always remember, you are messing with some serious life-ruining shit here, this ain&#039;t weed anymore. I&#039;m sorry, I read back on this post and I sound like such an alarmist, but I&#039;m only trying to look out for you and everyone else on here, and I feel like being straight up and honest is the best way to do that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, fent I know..not sure what to do with these patches now..but I&#039;ve been on and off oxy for 4 or 5 years now never bang them and haven&#039;t gone too far with them yet at least.&nbsp; I tell myself I&#039;ll never pick up the needle but I guess that&#039;s what they all say.&nbsp; I think this was good advice and Raoul Duke&#039;s post was a wake up call i&#039;m glad I just got.

				Hard drug to quit I hear.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;d avoid methadone as the withdrawal can be even worse than heroin. Supposedly it slips into your bone marrow. <br /><br />Not a huge opiate person myself but I know from experience how difficult it can be to end a lengthy and costly drug binge. Especially with the harder substances such as heroin and cocaine.

				I just want to thank for this thread. <br />I am so fucking close to try it.<br />Had Oxis and tramal and didnt like it that much and thought maybe .... just maybe &quot;H&quot; will be better. But no!<br /><br />I stick to L and stimms and and and.... no need to try opis and make me like them.<br /><br />sounds a little bit like my beginning of smoking weed. I hated it but had to do it again and again. Now I love it and I know I will be sitting in my chair as an old man vaping my homegrown. <br />Is is perhaps the same with this opiates? U have to &quot;learn&quot; to love them and once you do u cant stop. <br /><br />I fear them and for me it is the best I can do.

				nah there&#039;s no learning curve at all - you try em once and think FUCK this is NICE. after trying it once you&#039;re not instantly hooked like some people would like you to believe, but it&#039;s really easy to slip it into your evenings

				Yeah I mean personally, I&#039;m live and let live about what drugs people do. It&#039;s up to them but things like Smack, Crack, Meth and the other really addictive opiates just seems like going a bit too far to me. I&#039;ve never really heard of anyone trying it and ending well. I mean having read your story Dukey I would even say this didn&#039;t go particularly well even though you haven&#039;t done it again, you still suffered even if it was minorly. They just seem like drugs you take to push the button to me and that is a dark road to go down. I don&#039;t like things like IVing either, creeps me out.<br /><br />My two cents.

I only joined today to leave some well deserving feedback for a vendor, and I ended up in the drug safety discussion and reading about your experience with Heroin, and I have to say, we could be brothers in this story.<br /><br />I joined here to start getting Oxy after last Summer having access to a good source of Norcos. I enjoyed my Hydrocodone and always heard Oxy was better and you could snort, so I found out about SR joined iup and started my purchasing.<br /><br />Everything was fine, my Oxy use isn&#039;t too bad 60mg(snorted of oral) will send me flying for the day and I was purchasing 5-6 pills at a time, so I had enough for 3 straight days or a week depending on my usage. I can use oxy 3 days straight and be completely fine afterwards no issues, except being tired, because I really don&#039;t sleep when I&#039;m high, actually gives me lots of pep.<br /><br />The deal is Oxy is expensive, so I kept seeing those H listings and I would read the reviews and see that all you needed was a &quot;matchstick&quot; bump and you&#039;ll fly high and it&#039;s the greatest. So after many times putting it in my cart then deleting it and debating, I finally ordered some for that Pure Pebble, got the 1/2 gram, for around the same price a weekend of Oxy would cost me.<br /><br />So it shows up and I start with the smallest line ----------&nbsp; , feels nice, definitely different. Not the rush of Oxy but a very mellow feeling calming, but the experience was nothing like the reviews I had been reading, it just got me mellowed. I guess the rush is IV specific, because I wasn&#039;t feeling it in that way, as a matter of fact I found that I actually prefer Oxy to H.<br /><br />Since I have this now large amount(to me) of H, every couple of days, I take a small bump at the end of the day and it was all good for a weeks, then as you did, for some reason the every few days turned into an every other evening, that then turned in a few days of 2-3 bumps a day for about 4 days. I finally ran out after about 3-4 weeks with the 4 day binge at the end.<br /><br />My experiences with WD were fucking awful. Now let me get this straight the physical was like I had a light flu and couldn&#039;t get comfortable for a few day, it was uncomfortable but not anything like what I had read about, no shits, not anything too bad, worst was the restless leg for 2 nights.<br /><br />What fucked me up was the emotional comedown,&nbsp; was fucking depressed for about 3 days, all I wanted to do was cry, I&#039;ve lost my Parents and this pain was worst, it was as if I had lost a child. Here I am a grown good sized man and I&#039;m an emotional wreck. It took all my strength to keep my shit together and not let my family see what I had done to myself, I was ashamed and embarrassed. I had let this &quot;weekend&quot; fun, fucking grab me by the tail and make me it&#039;s bitch.<br /><br />I despise H , it&#039;s an ugly life robbing drug, that wasn&#039;t even fun. it gave me nothing really, no rush, no energy, no enthusiasm. All I wanted to do was sit or lay on the couch and watch tv. It sucked the life out of me.<br /><br />With Oxy I want to do things and I get a nice rush from it, H on the other hand was vile.<br /><br />As you can tell this isn&#039;t an anti drug post because I still do Oxy from time to time, but I want nothing to do with H, and I know it&#039;s cliche and dumb coming from me, but I would highly recommend never trying it.

				Yeah, reading that story reminded me of how the road of opiate addiction began for me... Used oxy&#039;s recreationally for a long time - several months actually. A couple times a month, then every weekend, then Wednesdays plus the weekends. Ended up being addicted for about four years, the impact on my life was devastating... Divorce, time in jail, homelessness... Yeah, don&#039;t think I&#039;ll do that again...

				I got some H off SR about a month or so ago. I&#039;d tried it once before and even then knew it could be trouble. Something about the way heisenburg advertised his tar made it really alluring to me though, so I threw down some coins and waited...for 3 weeks...<br /><br />I bought a half G. I still have probably 70% of it and have gotten high many times. Two 10mg doses a few hours apart is all it takes for a full night ordeal if I haven&#039;t been using it frequently. Of all the drugs I&#039;ve tried, heroin is by far the hardest to moderate, and I know I won&#039;t buy it again because of that. I used opiates on and off for about 10 years and never had any issues. Never even developed a tolerance...until now, go figure. Heroin is really insidious though, not like other opiates have been for me. There&#039;s something that just makes it really easy to let yourself do it more frequently than you intended. LUCKILY my saving grace is that if I use it for a few days in a row I stop getting high and just get extremely agitated and irritable and it puts me off of wanting it for a while. That and the look of the tar dissolved in water I suck into my nose literally makes me nauseas to look at it. It&#039;s a fucking disgusting drug. And while the effects are very enjoyable, they take away your appreciation for legitimate sources of pleasure and enjoyment in life. I&#039;m a really active cat and H is completely antithetical to that, just makes you want to veg out. Content for all the wrong reasons sort of thing. No sex drive. Not really my thing, but even still for a bit there it would really call to me. I feel like I&#039;ve got it in check now, I made it my bitch and just have a go once every week or two...which is ideal...but overall I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone even once. Too alluring...I get into coke regularly with no problem...even if I have a hankering for it, it&#039;s completely trivial and can be brushed aside without a second thought...quite different compared to the insidious way H comes at you. Oddly enough in low doses I find it indistinguishable for kratom though, except for the compulsion thing.<br /><br />I give it a 1/5. There&#039;s way better ways to get high that won&#039;t mute your soul or suck you into a tolerance and dependence cycle. Fuck heroin. The end.

				The thing about heroin is that you can never convince someone not to try it.<br /><br />There&#039;s no way to explain to someone how withdrawals feel, how cravings feel. How you can end up in a gutter after being on top of the world (metaphorically - for example I had a lot of friends and would go out every night and have fun... now I&#039;m a loner with few if any real friends).<br /><br />When someone is determined to try heroin they just will. It&#039;s like they need to see the dark side for themselves before they are convinced they&#039;ve just danced with the devil.<br /><br />Your life will never be the same if you ever become addicted to heroin. Addicted - not just try - there are people who can try heroin, use it a couple of times, and never again. I envy those people.

				I have been using 5mg of oxy for the last 3 weeks, every other day or so for back pain. I never really liked the whole opiate feeling until now. My first experience with opiods was a 15mg dose of oxycodone. Didn&#039;t really like it, but it was interesting. Tried a 30mg pill after that and just felt sick and weird, though the pain relief was amazing. Next up, I messed around with suboxone (yes, I took fucking subs recreationally). I still think my dopamine receptors or whatever were affected by that. That buprenorphine is some powerful shit, although not nearly as strong as that Godawful orange taste that still makes me nauseous whenever I think about it.<br /><br />Now that I have a good reason to take them, I find myself enjoying the feeling more and more. Hopefully I can get my injury corrected before this becomes a problem. Right now, I only take 5mg every other day along with a slew of potentiation shit (white GFJ from concentrate, tonic water, benadryl, naproxen, and 30mg DXM to lower tolerance). My tolerance doesn&#039;t seem to be increasing, but I do notice a bit of depression, runny nose, tiredness, and restlessness sneaking in on the off days, especially if other shit is bothering me. That could just be allergies (mine can get bad), a cold, or lack of sleep, but the thought of opiate dependance scares the shit out of me. I also have some 36.5mg tramadols now, which is almost as good as oxy for me (the SSRI/SNRI effect could be why). I am going to try and take one to see if it magically clears up my pussy ass &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; on the off days. Tramadol and its metabolite are mild opiods which stop withdrawals in people with low tolerance. That means if my symptoms go away, I need to stop taking all of this shit ASAP or my habit can turn into full blown dependance.<br /><br />If 5mg percs are this much trouble after a while, I can only imagine how bad heroin would be if one took a liking to it!!!

				I am intrigued by the idea of smoking H, but a habit isn&#039;t something I want. Not that I could maintain one anyway. <br /><br />I tried smoking tobacco last year. I didn&#039;t really understand what all of the fuss was about. I didn&#039;t have any cravings, nor did I feel withdrawals. I liked the calming feeling it brought on but could easily maintain my usage without a second thought. I noticed my usage went from being a once a week, then every three days, then every other day. I stopped after I noticed this pattern and got rid of the rest of the tobacco. I only smoked about half a pack over a period of one month. <br /><br />Is Heroin similar in this way? It seems that the people who get addicted to this drug have problems controlling their usage of anything, not just heroin. I have never had a physical, or mental dependence on anything.<br /><br />How different is using Heroin through IV from smoking Heroin?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Is IV use harder to control?

Meth, crack/coke I can take or leave, but only really like coke out those 3 and only bought meth once. <br />I hate to admit but I think us talking about it and availability of all drugs on SR along with his curiosity has led to a bad thing with our mate Soll....We did attempt to help him try it safely and advised as much as anyone could, but he has been missing now since he took it along with a rail of meth.....H &amp; MA....It&#039;s fucking dangerous together for a first time user of BOTH!!! I think he got carried away like a kid in a sweet shop like we all have been here.... I say best not to fuck with it if you haven&#039;t already unless you are very sensible with drug use and only then be careful......I use once a month now but took me years to get off daily use and it does change you forever! think before using this drug.....<br /><br />I think H is the one drug that the stories are true about.....It can kill you if you are not careful and if you are trying it for the first time on your own....have you seen pulp fiction? snorting it there is no way back unlike smoking as you smoke bit by bit...sniffing its all in one blast tho not as hard a hit as IV.

And this was my first time using, i was a complete opiate noob and just went way too hard.... I did feel compelled to finish the bag that i bought over the few weeks after, a weird kind of sick compulsion, i didn&#039;t ever really feel great from the H high, so im not sure where my want to do more came from, but finished it regardless, really hard to throw drugs away haha... But yeah glad ive tried it, but really have no want to order anymore , im kinda glad that i didn&#039;t like my first experience, totally underwhelmed by H in general, seems like such a shit drug and it does really take you to dark places, i couldn&#039;t help but think of all my problems when i was high, i totally though it would have the opposite effect... But yeah your totally right, if someone wants to try it, they&#039;re going to try it..&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are thinking of trying H, know your limits, try it in a safe environment and be way cautious.

				I gotta say, phew, glad you are as sensible as you present yourself, Mr. Duke. You embody the responsible drug user. If something is more con than pro, it needs to go. End of story. Good on ya!<br /><br />Also Limetless, I&#039;m echoing pretty much everything you&#039;ve said. I have the same personality type, where I wanna be energized, social, and functional. I won&#039;t even touch any type of hallucinogenic drug for similar reasons- not being in control. And for some reason I always became mute using those drug types. Just could not speak for the life of me. Paranoia central. Not my idea of fun. <br /><br />Plus, everything I&#039;ve ever heard, every description of heroin&#039;s high/rush, has just never sounded appealing to me. I guess that whole drug taker&#039;s curiosity bit catches a lot of people in its net and is extremely prevalent in our culture. <br /><br />To everyone out there fighting the good fight- don&#039;t lose hope; you&#039;re stronger than you think you are. Your mind is an incredible tool in your arsenal. Don&#039;t underestimate its power if focused properly. Best of luck to you all.<br /><br />Now, I gotta little weaning of a coke habit to do over here... vacations. All resolve = out the window.

				I&#039;ve never know an recreational IV heroin user if that affects our decision at all, i&#039;m not judging anyone and believe people own their own body and should be able to do what they want but once you go down that path with H it really starts eliminating a lot of positive relationships and things you could be doing with your life. my two cents.

H is the strongest high of them all. i am trying to quit right now and have spent the last 3 days living an udder hell and thats with the help of suboxone (under dosed i must add) and with a small amount of H to releive the worst of the withdrawal symtoms until my methadone clinic doctor can get me on the proper dosage of suboxone. opiates are serious shit. H is the worst though because it cannot be easily measured like prescription pills and the potentency varies. plus when u have a little baggie of powder its harder to track and easier to do &quot;just another quick bump&quot; then if u have a bottle of 50x OC40s that u know must last so long until u can re-up. my advice is if u must try H once or twice. but never do it twice in a row . id say even wait minimum 3 days. but if u find urself counting the days before u can do it again or feeling anxious to do more then u need to STOP before u get ahead. u are just one step away from full blown physical dependance which involves serious, debilitating withdrawal symtoms that STOP your life and leave you so sick and fiending dope even just a small amount to feel some comfort. withdrawing from opiates like H or oxy is a serious medical condition to be honest. all doctors should treat it that way and if they come across a suffering patient should be giving them a dose to feel comfortable and a plan to get clean. IMHO atleast.&nbsp; peace out all. hope to be clean soon! NH2012

				Hello, I just wanted to check in with my support group.<br /><br />I&#039;m still using H on and off, and I still feel like I&#039;m a casual user... at least, I don&#039;t feel addicted. A couple of weeks ago I went through a gram of good #3 over about 10 days. I used every night, because it&#039;s winter here and cold and dark and what the hell...<br /><br />I had mild WDs for maybe 2 days after running out. I wasn&#039;t thinking &quot;wish I had some heroin&quot; the whole time, I was thinking &quot;I&#039;m getting what I deserve&quot;. I realised that even if I did have easy access to more I wouldn&#039;t, because I like heroin and if I kept doing it non-stop it would ruin me, and it would be ruined for me.<br /><br />After that I ordered more which came quickly, from a different vendor. 0.5g. I was expecting better but it did almost nothing. So I&#039;ve ordered more and while I sometimes think about it coming and feel a little excited, I&#039;m quite happy to wait. All this clean time is just part of the cycle...<br /><br />I enjoy IVing but I wouldn&#039;t get upset if I couldn&#039;t do it... for me opiates aren&#039;t so much about the rush (though that is quite enjoyable) but the experience as a whole.<br /><br />I think part of the reason why I&#039;m using is because I&#039;ve always had a fascination with it. Part of what makes drugs interesting is the taboo, and Heroin is taboo even to other drug users.<br /><br />Then SR came along and I finally got to try it... and realised it&#039;s not really as good as I&#039;d built it up to be.<br /><br />So why do I keep using? I don&#039;t know. Maybe I am becoming addicted. I like to think I can just use casually forever, maybe I&#039;m totally bullshitting myself and it&#039;s just not possible. If that&#039;s the case then I accept the consequences. <br /><br />No matter what happens, I will learn something from it. Even if it&#039;s the thing that everyone else says - it doesn&#039;t matter, I need to experience it for myself. Because I&#039;ve found many times that what &quot;everyone says&quot; isn&#039;t necessarily true.<br /><br />I know if I start getting physically addicted that&#039;s when the real trouble starts. So I just order small amounts spaced a few weeks apart.<br /><br />I also think that there is a very wide range of variability in the way that people react to certain things, and that it&#039;s statistically likely that there are some people who can use opiates casually, long term... and I think I&#039;m one of those people.<br /><br />But maybe I&#039;m just bullshitting myself.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really planning on changing my behaviour, so maybe I&#039;ll try to post to this thread every now and then and let you know how I&#039;m going, playing out here on the edges of addiction.<br /><br />Peace.

				Jesus christ Raoul! This is seriously one of the coolest threads to come out and it was really interesting to read your first encounter. Anyway man, I really hope you manage to stay away from it long enough to the point where you can see the word and not think about doing it. I was addicted to OxyContin for about two years and severely impacted&nbsp; my life socially, academically, and at work. Though I still do some once in a while, seeing as how Purdue changed the formula back in 2010. All in all dude, I feel like my wanting to do opiates has now changed to cocaine, which I much rather be into than heroin, seeing as how I like being down more than way up.<br /><br />DON&#039;T GET HOOKED ON OPIATES GUYS!!<br /><br />Mad respect for ANYONE who is or has ever kicked an opiate-based addiction. Shit&#039;s horrible, I know.

				Shit I just saw this thread after I had already posted a new one asking if it was even possible to be a recreational heroin user and found alot of answers to my questions by reading the responses. This was a great thread and I learned alot thanks a ton to the original poster for sharing their experience and those who contributed with some really good responses. I think the silk road does a million times more for real drug education than any government ad campaign could ever do in a century,.

				The thing about an opiate addiction is that it is so subtle and sneaky at first - just like he described it. I had a gram of Tony76&#039;s pebbles and I would use it maybe one time every three weeks.

				I guess I&#039;m just lucky, but H scares the shit out of me. Codeine gets me where I like to be, and has for many years now. The thing about H , to me at least, is that after the &quot;honeymoon&quot; stage, you are always either high as a kite or sick as a dog. Maybe I metabolize methyl-morphine more efficiently into morphine than most. I like a functional high, and one that I don&#039;t have to rent out the girl friend or rob banks to pay for. Makes for a healthier lifestyle.

3 months to work up the bottle to actually order some, i ordered a quarter gram. when it arrived on my doorstep i shit myself a little bit, and was worried about doing it right up until the point where i snorted my first bump, a tiny little bump that if it was coke or MDMA i would not have even noticed a difference in feeling or mood. this tiny little bump of H (#4) got me nodding pretty hard, i was fucked up for a good few hours. i didn&#039;t get the rush you hear so much about but after this amount of time dabbling i&#039;m pretty positive the rush only comes from IV&#039;ing, and needles are just not my thing, but it felt pretty fucking nice all the same and all my worries just melted away.<br /><br />the day after this first bump i felt fine, i was thinking &#039;yeah, this is all right, if i have a heavy week at work i can just kick back with a little bump on a friday and forget about all my troubles&#039; and i weren&#039;t clucking for more. so for the next couple of months, probably every 2nd or 3rd weekend i&#039;d kick back on a friday night with a little bump of H. even spacing it 2 or 3 weeks apart i built up a fair tolerance pretty quickly so the bumps were getting slightly bigger and after an hour or 2 i&#039;d re-dose to the point where i was doing 4 bumps in a night. at this stage i started being sick after the 3rd or 4th bump, so it was glaringly obvious i was doing too much, but that rarely stopped me from doing another one a little later on. the day after these little binges i felt sick ALL day, threw up repeatedly in the morning and couldn&#039;t hold any food down until evening time, then by that time my stomach had shrunk and i couldn&#039;t eat much anyway. i never bothered doing any more H the next day though, as i didn&#039;t want to get into the habit, and the following day i&#039;d wake up fine. <br /><br />i ran out of the quarter g after a couple of months, so i thought i&#039;d get a bit more in so i could carry on with my 2 - 3 weekly session, so i got some more #4, a gram this time. it wasn&#039;t as strong as the first lot i got so the bumps were probably twice the size of the original lot but with enough it still got me where i wanted to be.<br /><br />i don&#039;t know whether it was due to having such a bigger amount or just because it&#039;s really habit forming (probably both), but my 2 - 3 weekly sessions turned into every friday night (fuck it - this amount will last me ages), then every friday and saturday, and after a particularly bad wednesday at work i went home and had a bump that evening, and for the past 3 - 4 weeks i&#039;ve been having a bump every night of the week after dinner. was only ever just one bump during the week &#039;to chill out after a heavy day&#039;, and again 3 or 4 on a friday and saturday night. it never bothered me just doing the one on the week nights as i woke up the next day feeling fine, and all the while i was thinking &#039;i don&#039;t need to do one tonight, but i&#039;m going to anyway just because i can&#039;, and my body was still functioning fine - i could go to the loo normally (i had heard H bungs you up but i never experienced any of that so &#039;obviously i weren&#039;t doing enough to mess with my body that much&#039;), and if anything my productivity at work was up. no sign of withdrawal at all the next day during the week, but again after the 3 or 4 on a friday i was waking up sick as fuck the next day. <br /><br />had my last bit of H on the friday just gone, i thought i might as well have a bit of a session with my last bit and then leave it for a while, it&#039;s getting a bit too much of a habit, so i had a proper blowout on friday, puked a bit then carried on with it, then woke up saturday feeling a bit sick but managed to sort the house out, cook dinner and just carry on as normal, albeit a bit of a struggle. by saturday night i was feeling fine, didn&#039;t drink any booze, obviously no H because i didn&#039;t have any, and i think i had 1 joint all day. i had a good 9 hours sleep, then sunday morning i woke up with real bad flu-like symptoms, shivers, feeling sick, and every part of my body ACHED like FUCK. since sunday morning i&#039;ve been running to the loo every hour and pissing out of my arse. this morning i don&#039;t feel fluey but my back is still aching and i generally feel as if someones beaten the shit out of me. obviously my body has built some sort of physical dependence on the 1 bump nightly thing. i&#039;m not actually craving it at all, the whole time i was doing it i never felt as if i was craving it, but its obvious my body is missing it. i had another 9 hours sleep last night and this morning i feel completely fucking drained, still aching all over like i&#039;ve been beaten up and i can&#039;t concentrate on anything at work. i don&#039;t feel sick at all, i&#039;m eating normally although my appetite has dropped a bit and i&#039;m still running to the loo every hour. i have absolutely no desire to get any work done today and i&#039;m just waiting for home time so i can eat something and go to bed again.<br /><br />if you are thinking of trying heroin i hope the above puts it into perspective for you - i&#039;m not saying don&#039;t try it - of course it&#039;s up to you, but if you do be prepared for the sneaky fucker working it&#039;s way into your daily life. i never did any at work or during the day, it was only ever a evening/nightly thing, but even then it&#039;s managed to make my body depend on it, even though i have never had a craving for it the way smokers would crave a cigarette. if you can stick to doing it once or twice a month you should be ok, but i thought i could do that, and even though i did for the first few months, it was there burning a hole in my pocket and nagging away in the back of my mind, then it started working its way into my weekly routine, especially after a stressful day at work.<br /><br />so i&#039;m done with this shit, it was fun while it lasted, but i feel our relationship has run it&#039;s course. i&#039;m just glad i managed to get out now before it turned into a real life horror story<br /><br /><br />for the record - IMO coming up on a pill feels better than H, but i can only speak from snorting H, not IV&#039;ing.<br /><br />RD<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ahhh...heroin withdrawels...id rather poke my eyes out with forks and slowly melt away in a tub of acid then sit through that kinda pain.

				ah man .. I&#039;ve never done anything but booze and weed .. the latter pretty extensive until now. Knowing I have an addictive personality, I just always had the feeling to stay off anything stronger. Booze being strong enough as it is, I am only drinking every couple of months. Thanks for posting this up and thanks for all those replies, my constant thoughts about actually going off to other stuff such as MDMA &amp; LSD are once again burried deeper down. I am damn sure I couldnt take the withdrawal on things stronger than that.. everyone, watch out on what you might be trying out of curiosity, could fuck up everything, just for a little bit of curiosity. Nothing is worth that.

				Heroin and pretty much all opiates, for the most part, are an all in or out type of deal. At least in my opinion... Very few people have success &quot;chipping&quot; or using opiates recreationally or on the weekend or whatever you want to call it.<br /><br />OP something doesn&#039;t sound right about your experience... When you said you were feeling sick the next day after using 4-5 bumps the night prior I think that&#039;s from using too much. I threw up the first time I used H and I had been using poppy pod tea for 1.5 years so I definitely had a tolerance. And no I didn&#039;t shoot it and I doubt I ever will... Maybe when I&#039;m dying.<br /><br />You said you started using regularly and then experienced withdrawal after stopping... But it took two days... That&#039;s really what doesn&#039;t sound right to me. Heroin itself is a prodrug and does not actually bind to your receptors. However, it&#039;s metabolites, mostly morphine and acetylmorphine, have relatively short half lives. 2-3 hours. I guess its possible that the withdrawals the first day were mild or maybe you have a slow metabolism but generally you should have experienced withdrawal much sooner than that if you were indeed addicted.<br /><br />Of course crazier shit has happened and obviously I wasn&#039;t there and you know your body better than I do (quit masturbating! Okay that probably wasn&#039;t funny...) but do you think it could have been psychological more than physical? What about a coincidental flu contraction? <br /><br />Either way folks the message is the same... Heroin is serious shit. It&#039;s often regarded as the king of drugs and is a feel good machine. Almost too good... I&#039;ve quit using all other drugs except cigs because heroin keeps me content... Well I&#039;ll deviate occasionally but there&#039;s no real desire to. I even quit smoking weed after ten years or so... Never thought I&#039;d say that! Make life simple for yourself and don&#039;t bite from the forbidden fruit! WTF did I really make a jeebus reference?

				Ive been intrigued to try heroin, because of the feeling being described by many as a &quot;multiple-hour orgasm&quot;. So my question is - does it really feel THAT good and can it be reached without injecting H? I know Im not very addictive person and have been able to handle any drug I tried so far, but I guess heroin is completely different league in terms of addiction than weed, mdma or other psychedelics... it would be worth risking for me only if it was the best rush I&#039;d ever experience...

				no mate, that rush only comes from IV&#039;ing. not that i&#039;ve IV&#039;ed, but it doesn&#039;t hit you like that snorting it or smoking it from what i&#039;ve heard, and the #4 i got was from Nucleo, who is a bit of a legend on here - had the purest H thats ever been sold on here.<br /><br />it&#039;s still fucking nice though, but scary how it sneaks into your daily routine - i thought i could control myself, and i did when i bought my first bit, but the second purchase got me, and that weren&#039;t even as good as the first (Noriega)

				I&#039;m now in the position where I can treat myself on it for a few weeks. My first rule is never go beyond that first rule, a month is about the max. The second rule is to stock up on plenty DHC and subutex before making first order - these are not to be touched until binge is over. Last thing you want to do is start missing work or fucking up personally due to withdrawals. I&#039;ve learned over time how to taper down so that don&#039;t get any withdrawals, subutex / suboxone (doesn&#039;t matter which as I won&#039;t be touching h after strting my withdrawal) is a miracle drug due to it&#039;s amazing half life and very low amount needed to hold off withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />Anyone reading this and thinking of trying it, don&#039;t. I got to this point by a&nbsp; lot of fuck up&#039;s and it still takes an incredible amount of will power and thinking back to all my fuck ups to start on my withdrawal programme. Also find switching to something else helps as have something to loook forward to and not sitting looking at found walls or half heartedly playing xbox with&nbsp; mind on other things.<br /><br />Best plan is not to start, unquestionably, but unquestionably people will and its incredibly difficult to stop. Don&#039;t try cold turkey. You may be one of the strong ones who can do it buy why make life a misery, stock up on DHC or subutex first and you&#039;ll feel normal, maybe even take a valium or two help you get to sleep but may not even need that. And taper down off the DHC / subutex until are taking tiny amounts, like get down to the point of 30mg DHC twice&nbsp; day for three days, then 20mg for 3 days, then 10mg for 3 days, then 5 mg for three days, then5 mg once a day for a week. Basically whatever works for you but you need a plan just don&#039;t jump in and thinnk &#039;I&#039;m going to go cold turkey tomorrow and stop&#039;. Not the best approach.<br /><br />Obviously you may need start on more then 60mg DHC (in fact definitely will) but the point of that sentence was simply to show that it&#039;s best to taper down slowly and in small increments. Even 5mg when you get up can be of some use when you&#039;re at the tail end, probably is psychosomatic but if it works for you that&#039;s what matters.<br /><br />Again though, can&#039;t stress enough, don&#039;t think this is good advice to follow and jump in and try, the only good advice is not to try. My post is just to try help those who have already fucked up.

				Wow. Sounds like my experience with brown.<br /><br />I remember my first bump. I didn&#039;t buy it, but some friends had bought some and were IV&#039;ing. Needles aren&#039;t my thing, but i pitched in so i asked for them to lay me out a bump. Maaaaan, i couldn&#039;t even drive down the street i was so fucked up. Later on, the friends had some good tolerance going, so they wanted to IV some more and were going to IV away my share of the dope, so they offered me another &quot;bump&quot; which turned out to be a decently sized line. It was waaaaay too big for a first time user like me to snort, but i didn&#039;t want to waste my money so up the nose it went.... The dick who broke me out that last line did NOT like me (for reasons i won&#039;t go into here), but i&#039;m sure he knew i couldn&#039;t handle what he was laying out. I spent the rest of the day alternatively puking, laying down, talking to them so i would stay awake, and just generally sinking into bliss even though the vomiting was awful.<br /><br />Jump to almost a year later and my first $10 balloon. That thing lasted me only a few days with me dosing on a bump daily after work. towards the end, i was dosing right before work and in the middle of my shift to avoid feeling sick. i felt disgusted but bought a couple more balloons. i continued to only snort the stuff for about a month, then i lost my connect (thankfully) and i couldn&#039;t get anymore.<br /><br />Maybe another 6 months to a year later, i IV&#039;d it for the very first time. It was decent stuff and i only did a small shot. got way way high but no vomiting this time. i usually have problems falling asleep, but sleep that night was deep.<br /><br />Another month or two later, I came into some more and decided to IV just one more time to see what all the fuss was about. Someone else prepared for me $60 of dope in a point and i shot it all in one go. Sweet jesus, the rush..... I vomited a little soon after, but not like my first experience. after that, the high was so warm and enveloping, so very welcoming. The high was blissful, but i knew i couldn&#039;t EVER do this again, because snorting would just be a tease, and IVing was sure to end up someplace i did not want to be.<br /><br />Glad you had the strength to stay away, OP.

				Buy a quarter g then PM the vendor&nbsp; and ask him to only send on half or just throw away most of it when it comes. <br /><br />If you have a high opiate tolerance from oxy&#039;s or whatever no point trying one or two tiny lines, I doubt&nbsp; you&#039;ll feel&nbsp; much from it. Save your money. And opiates are all basically the same anyway, just different strengths, it&#039;s not like snorting h is going to give you a different experience from snorting an equivalent amount of oxy. There&#039;s a decent comparison table here hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_comparison and you can see that Fentanyl can be 50 times stronger than heroin (more if you factor in that street heroin is never going to be anything like 100% pure which fent always will be) which is why there are a lot of OD&#039;s from it.

				to the OP (if he still lurks around here):<br /><br />Assume perhaps you were able to exhibit self control and stick to that one bump on a bi-weekly/weekly basis, do you think you&#039;d still experience that horrible physical withdrawal?&nbsp; Reason being is that like you, I had a particularly fiendish experience with coke, and have since just decided not to buy it anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then I tried meth, figuring it&#039;d probably be just as fiendish...but oddly enough I was able to treat it like any other one-hit-wonder drug and I&#039;m starting to think that drugs only really call out to me as fiendish if the high is short lived.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried a ton of things to this date:&nbsp; Several 2Cs, MDMA, acid, coke, meth, shrooms, various psychedelic RCs...&nbsp; and I&#039;ve also realized that my self control is only as good as the high I&#039;m seeking.&nbsp; That being, I need a few hours under the influence to really be satisfied with the experience.&nbsp; Coke sucked just because I&#039;d keep chasing the damned high every 20-30 minutes and it was never enough.&nbsp; Strangely enough meth didn&#039;t pull me into any compulsory redosing like I was afraid it might, but I also was satisfied with the energy and confident vibes that lasted at least 4 hours on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />In hindsight, I actually like meth, and will probably save it for future parties.&nbsp; I also like MDMA a lot, if not more, and even that&#039;s only a once a month venture with the occasional once-a-week binge (now on week 4 of this one, but this is the last party for a while).<br /><br />With H I feel this would be more of a &quot;fuck it, relax&quot; kind of drug for the weekdays or a day I just feel like being high, and from the sound of it, insufflation lasts a satisfying amount of time enough.&nbsp; The question that really lies in the back of my mind is avoiding the withdrawal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had bad crashes, and I had some brief, mild withdrawal symptoms from coke which were manageable, just made for a shitty day at work.&nbsp; If H use was once-a-week maximum use, would that still cause abrupt and uncomfortable tolerance or withdrawal symptoms?&nbsp; <br /><br />Not looking for a preacher here, I&#039;m well aware of how nasty this drug can be if you let it take over, and I&#039;ll deal with it the same way I dealt with the coke thing that was becoming troublesome (gave a gram to my cokehead friend who shoved it all up his nose in one sitting...), but in this case I&#039;d probably just flush it seeing as H is pretty taboo in my circle.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I advise people to steer clear. I was 18 and got hooked for a year (rhyme unintended.) I was hooked for about a year, then somehow managed to get out of it. I dabble in it still, which I shouldn&#039;t but I do. Anyways, like said it sneaks the hell up on you and next thing you know you are hurting badly. Luckily you only got the physical addiction, I got stuck with mental as well as it helped with my anxiety and that really made it hard.

				If you&#039;re thinking of trying heroin then read this thread and digest what has been said in it thoroughly because there&#039;s a lot of sensible comment in here.<br /><br />Let me tell you about my experience with heroin. I have for many years had a fascination with the drug. When I was smoking a lot of weed I would listen to songs like &quot;My Sweet Prince&quot; and &quot;There she goes&quot; and romanticise heroin addiction in my stoned head like the idiot I was. So I guess it was only a matter of time before I &quot;dabbled&quot; in the drug. My first time was this March. On my 40th birthday with an order made on SR.<br /><br />I really wish I hadn&#039;t. Because while Heroin is undoubtedly a great drug in the sense that it can leave you feeling warm, fuzzy, contented and with this sense of being wrapped in the most amazing blanket..the moment you pass that threshold from &quot;dabbling&quot; into addiction is the moment where it gets incredibly hard to walk away. Because your body and your brain loves the effect of the drug. And if you&#039;re gonna pull the plug then you better be prepared and have some subs or meth because it&#039;s going to make you feel like ABSOLUTE crap. I ran out this weekend because of the SR downtime and because I wasn&#039;t organised enough. I had the crappiest 48 hours imaginable. I was hallucinating, shitting through the eye of a needle and feeling like my legs couldn&#039;t stop shaking but I was too fucked up to do anything. I got a bit in but when that ran out I was back to square one. Only loperamide is keeping the wd symptoms at bay now while I wait for tomorrows post to bring me my SR order.<br /><br />If I had the choice, I wouldn&#039;t have tried Heroin in the first place but this is where I am right now so I have to deal with it. The only question I keep asking myself is whether I really have the stomach to walk away from it. I&#039;m not sure right now. I&#039;m really not. I guess I should be grateful I&#039;ve never crossed over to the needle as, if I had, I think it would be even harder to find my way back.<br /><br />Something to think about.

				I&#039;m enjoying experimenting with drugs at the moment due to this great road, but I&#039;ve never had any interest in trying heroin atall I feel sick thinking about it tbh. I will never even buy from a vendor who also sells Heroin. Reading this thread theres some really sad stories here, I really feel for you guys I wouldnt wish what some of you have described on anyone. But some of you are just accepting what it has done to you and carrying on using, I just dont get it, why are you just accepting and carrying on. Do you really not want to pull yourself out or not believe its possible to pull yourself out?

Reason being is that like you, I had a particularly fiendish experience with coke, and have since just decided not to buy it anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then I tried meth, figuring it&#039;d probably be just as fiendish...but oddly enough I was able to treat it like any other one-hit-wonder drug and I&#039;m starting to think that drugs only really call out to me as fiendish if the high is short lived.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried a ton of things to this date:&nbsp; Several 2Cs, MDMA, acid, coke, meth, shrooms, various psychedelic RCs...&nbsp; and I&#039;ve also realized that my self control is only as good as the high I&#039;m seeking.&nbsp; That being, I need a few hours under the influence to really be satisfied with the experience.&nbsp; Coke sucked just because I&#039;d keep chasing the damned high every 20-30 minutes and it was never enough.&nbsp; Strangely enough meth didn&#039;t pull me into any compulsory redosing like I was afraid it might, but I also was satisfied with the energy and confident vibes that lasted at least 4 hours on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />In hindsight, I actually like meth, and will probably save it for future parties.&nbsp; I also like MDMA a lot, if not more, and even that&#039;s only a once a month venture with the occasional once-a-week binge (now on week 4 of this one, but this is the last party for a while).<br /><br />With H I feel this would be more of a &quot;fuck it, relax&quot; kind of drug for the weekdays or a day I just feel like being high, and from the sound of it, insufflation lasts a satisfying amount of time enough.&nbsp; The question that really lies in the back of my mind is avoiding the withdrawal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had bad crashes, and I had some brief, mild withdrawal symptoms from coke which were manageable, just made for a shitty day at work.&nbsp; If H use was once-a-week maximum use, would that still cause abrupt and uncomfortable tolerance or withdrawal symptoms?&nbsp; <br /><br />Not looking for a preacher here, I&#039;m well aware of how nasty this drug can be if you let it take over, and I&#039;ll deal with it the same way I dealt with the coke thing that was becoming troublesome (gave a gram to my cokehead friend who shoved it all up his nose in one sitting...), but in this case I&#039;d probably just flush it seeing as H is pretty taboo in my circle.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />if i could stick to the &#039;once every couple of weeks&#039; thing i would still be dabbling, but i just can&#039;t control myself with it. i had actually bought another half&nbsp; g to see if i could go back to the very occasional use because it&#039;s soooo nice to kick back with, but it only took a couple of days and i was bang on it again every night, again just with the one bump nightly thing, but it still grabbed me again. i never experienced the fiending for it at any point, it was more of a &#039;its there so i&#039;m gonna have a bump&#039; sort of thing. so now i steer well clear - haven&#039;t touched it in a few months now and now it&#039;s completely out of my system. i&#039;m just not bothered with it any more and i don&#039;t even miss it now. <br /><br />if you can stick to the very occasional use you won&#039;t get the sickness i described in the OP unless you do too much in one session, then you&#039;ll throw up and feel all warm and fuzzy again. the next morning you probably will be a bit sick, and if you can stick to your guns and just do it very occasionally fair play to you, and i am quite envious truth be told, but i consider myself pretty strong willed and i still couldn&#039;t control it, even though i never felt at any point i NEEDED it<br /><br />long before i even found SR i developed quite an impressive coke habit, but managed to pull myself out of that one pretty easy - there&#039;s no sickness like there is withdrawing from H, it&#039;s just a craving like you get with cigarettes. i still do a fair bit of coke, nothing like i used to do (at one point it was about an eighth a day, now it&#039;s about a gram every couple of weeks, and i can quite easily go for a pint, have a line and a chat with mates, then go home and have an evening in front of the tv with the mrs) and i&#039;m happy with that - i know when it&#039;s getting too much so i can quite easily leave it alone for a bit, but i still like it and it doesn&#039;t fuck me up when i stop doing it, so i&#039;m happy with still dabbling with coke.<br /><br />as i&#039;ve said previously i&#039;m glad i tried it as i&#039;m no longer curious about it, but it is a shame i can&#039;t leave it as a treat on occasion - if it&#039;s there it&#039;s getting done

				My advice on trying heroin is if you haven&#039;t, well then don&#039;t.&nbsp; Don&#039;t dance with the devil.&nbsp; I started out smoking tar and a few hits and I was like holy shit this blows any Oxycontin high out of the water.&nbsp; I would smoke it once every few weeks with no noticeable withdrawals besides cravings for more but my access was in Denver and i lived three hours away.&nbsp; Within a year of heavy oxycodone use with added heroin use during my trips to Denver i became addicted to tar (was already opiate addict obviously) At this point I was driving a 7 hour round trip drive from Denver for H to Fort Collins for coke and back to NW Colorado, and doing this twice a week while working a ok paying job too.&nbsp; So instead of saving the 2000 + i would make a week (not including my job) I would blow every bit of it on tar except for what I needed to re-up on the coke to keep the cycle going. Luckily i was never caught with C and H in Colorado or I would be some big Mexican cartels little white bitch in prison.&nbsp; And now I&#039;m 11 months off H and 2 months off opiates and its something i really have no desire to do again because of the physical, emotional, and finical pain it has caused me. <br /><br />But if you don&#039;t wanna believe me go out give it a try and think you can just do it &quot;once or twice&quot; or &quot;every now and again&quot; because I know very few who can actually do so. You know what they say once you turn black you never come back. (which is obviously a lie cause many people do, but it is one rough road)

				first time I got a quarter it was the finest dope i&#039;ve seen since, and i&#039;ve been going on 2g x 10 day binges for about 3 months now... i bumped the whole quarter in a weekend, shit had me absolutely flying. way better high than oxy or any other synthetic i&#039;ve found, and also much easier to kick after a lengthy binge. <br /><br />i&#039;ve never had more than 2g at any one time, and i always have buprenorphine on hand -- why someone would knowingly develop any size of heroin habit without having some bupe or temgesic is beyond me. the stuff is cheap, and you only suffer for the first 12-24 hours. <br /><br />previous to my heroin i had a daily oxycontin habit, which was far far worse. i was needing like a 40mg OP just to get out of bed in the morning, and i wouldn&#039;t catch a buzz off of it at all really. the thing about oxy vs. heroin is that its longer duration of action makes it more difficult to abuse, yet more susceptible to a prolonged withdrawal syndrome. i&#039;m only really looking for a nice rush maybe two or three times daily and then i&#039;m fine otherwise.&nbsp; the oxy doesn&#039;t allow for that, its like this BS synthetic crap that sticks to your bones and you can&#039;t even get a decent rush unless you&#039;ve really taken a fair amount. and the shit just lasts too long, way too long. <br /><br />when i&#039;m coming off heroin i really only need the bupe for about the first 3-4 days or so, then after that i&#039;m feeling fine and dandy.&nbsp; about 18 hours after my last hit i start feeling like i&#039;m picking up a fever, i sweat it out for about 2-3 more hours, pop bupe and i&#039;m good. <br /><br />then i do it all over again cuz i fucking llloouuvve love dat shit. <br /><br />who needs all those things when you&#039;ve got heroin?

Are you sure you dont mean 250mg? 1/4 gram? That would make more sense as to why you were puking, for a first time user, doing 250 mg in 4 doses over the course of 2 or 3 hours is quite a lot. I mean ive hit that point of doing to much before and granted I was high as fuck pin eyed and just fucked up I was sicker than shit. Puked my balls off for a good 5 hrs ever 30 to 45 mins apart. I barely could see for 1 hr, my pupils were so small. So I dont know if you got a shit batch or if you really mean 250mg. In which case you did too much, get some from a reputable vendor. Do little bumps, and wait 15 to 20 mins between bumps, youll hit that nice warm feeling that everyone enjoys so much.<br /><br />On the other hand, if your considering doing H for the first time, no one but yourself is going to be able to stop that curiosity, but know its a devils game. You will loose self control, at some point everyone does. Some people can collect themselves and keep it to a every so often thing. Myself I hit rock bottom in my high school years, it started with pain killers, killers eventually werent enough I had friends that were older and did H and one day I decided to try some, it gobbled me up faster than shit. Stopped going to school, lost my job, got kicked out of my house, completely dropped out of school, and eventually went to treatment. 3 times I went to treatment, after the 3rd time I finally was able to kick it. I was clean from H for over 5 years, and then one day I decided I could try it again. I dont know if it was because I was younger and self control was unheard of at the stage in life or what but I dont find myself searching for that fix day in and day out anymore. I can go on a binder for about 6 days and stop be a little sick, no subs or bupe, and be able to chill out for a week or two, but when I get that itch after the couple of weeks I do have to feed that monkey or I get quite irritated. So be weary my friends, if you think your one with self control H will definitely put it to the test.

Despite what you see on TV, heroin is a mellow and somewhat subtle high - at least compared to something like MDMA or meth. If you have no tolerance, it is very common to get &quot;dope sick&quot; instead of feeling anything enjoyable. 25mg of a quality #4 product is too much for a beginner. I would start with 10mg or so and don&#039;t even &quot;look&quot; for the high. Treat it like you would a couple of beers after work - lay down in front of the TV and just relax. Don&#039;t take it when you have anything important to be doing.<br /><br />After a few times of that, you will acquire the taste for it. The beauty of it is that it leaves you with no hangover, it&#039;s very mellow, and very relaxing. You can control your usage, but it is hard, and most people will tell you to stop right where you are. If you&#039;re committed to using up the product you purchased though, take my advice and go slow. <br /><br />You may also want to take a benadryl about 45 minutes before hand. It will help with the itching and nausea. Adding a xanax to the mix will often turn you into a drooling nodding mess, which some enjoy. You can &quot;nod&quot; without anything else, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend trying to get there until you&#039;ve got a very slight tolerance going (at least have tried it a few times). You don&#039;t want to be throwing up! My favorite thing to do was take about a 5-10mg bump every fifteen or twenty minutes until I got &quot;there&quot;.<br /><br />

The socio-cultural effects might be somewhat accurate, I&#039;m not sure, never been down that road. However, I can tell you the feeling you get from heroin is nothing like that.<br /><br />It&#039;s not an overpowering drug. Most people I know don&#039;t feel opiates the first time they try them. The danger of heroin lies in it&#039;s subtlety, though, as you will feel it is a drug that you can go to work on, go to class on, and spend your entire life on functioning just fine, feeling great, with no one noticing. After you develop a habit, heroin starts to mess with your life by making you not care about other stuff. It&#039;s immediate effects are not that powerful. <br /><br />Nodding is an effect you have to kind of work for. If you keep your mind or body active, you&#039;re not going to nod off unless you take a very high dose, and even then I doubt that would work for inexperienced users, as the nausea would keep your mind active. I would compare taking heroin to forcing meditation via drugs, as I find the feeling of meditation very similar to the feeling of opiates. You can&#039;t meditate while watching a movie, but you can by lying in bed doing nothing. Same goes for nodding. <br /><br />The feeling of nodding isn&#039;t particularly overpowering either. The picture media paints of heroin use is that once you start nodding, you&#039;re pretty much a lifeless zombie until the drug wears off. Nothing could be farther from the truth. No matter how hard I&#039;m nodding, if I have to get up for some reason, there&#039;s absolutely nothing stopping me, except for maybe laziness. I choose to sit there and think about nothing, it is not forced upon me.

				Well, this has been a *very* interesting thread for me. I was just reassuring someone that I have a strict dividing line between the substances I use and the ones I won&#039;t, and that line is being listed a physically addictive. I&#039;ve been very curious about ketamine (hmm, cat tranq, curiosity killed...) and its physical addictiveness is what&#039;s kept me off so far.<br /><br />I do have a mildly addictive personality, and I totally get the &quot;had a horrible day and it&#039;s there&quot; aspect, when you normally use something purely for rec but, what the hell, other people hit the pub. You can hit this just this once as a crutch. The road to hell might be paved with good intentions, but bad intentions buy you a ticket on the superexpressway.<br /><br />The other interesting thing from this thread is that I realized that at least some of my co-workers *must* think I have a drug addiction, given my pattern of absence and general appearance lately, when in fact I have been suffering WD from *prescription anti-depressants* (actually prescribed). Hmm.

				anyone OD on heroin here ? I had some mild overdose and was wondering if i got some brain damage.. One day i figure i should shoot 2 bags and see how the rush feels so i pour 2 bags in the spoon and pour 90cc of water. i cook then shoot 2/3 of solution 60 cc. the rush was very strong my face was hurting as hell feels like thousands of small needles sticking from inside out. so i walk to the mirror because i thought it would be interesting seeing my eyes constrict. Then it feels like 1 blink 2 blink 3 blink and dark im out. Then after a while i wake up I fell with my neck on (I dont know how to name it because english is not my first language but its plastic rising of shower cabin) and my hand was in a toilet lol. I did not feel any pain on my neck until the next morning however but it&#039;s a miracle i did not break it. My chest was hurting awfully however and i stood up and was very nauseous and threw up like 8-10 times. Second miracle is that I did not threw up while I was out because i would have suffocated. Then after throwing up I was still nodding after about 4 hours of being out cold and went right on to shoot the rest of my heroin. So I was stabbing my hand all over thinking why the hell it does not register ( I did not feel any pain and needle was 27g). Then after a while i realised that blood was coagulated. Then just went to sleep because i couldn&#039;t stand because it still felt like I&#039;ll vomit my guts out. The next morning i wake up like nothing happened. Crazy huh? Still I&#039;m interested how many times i&#039;ve been breathing in a minute and if i could have damaged my brain. That probably was mild overdose or something?

				After further research I&#039;m starting to think I really do have a naturally high opiate tolerance.&nbsp; Case in point, a long time ago I injured myself and was prescribed percs, which one day I actually took 4 and had very little to no pain relief, but I did feel pretty spacey, but not in the &quot;amazing, opiate&quot; way everyone talks about.<br /><br />So fast forward to now, I&#039;m trying supposedly some of the most potent heroin you can get your hands on and even 35mg is barely giving me a buzz.&nbsp; I get that the opiate high is supposed to be subtle, but I was always told it&#039;s kind of a &quot;better&quot; weed high by many H users I have met and/or asked.&nbsp; <br /><br />This raises problems because I don&#039;t want to OD without even feeling high, but I&#039;m frustrated at trying to figure out what&#039;s so great about heroin myself.&nbsp; Shoot me for that comment if you will, but I think I just am not wired correctly to enjoy this drug.&nbsp; The guy I bought it from said for a first time dose, what I took would&#039;ve OD&#039;d most normal people...and all I got was mildly high from it...&nbsp; Oh well, guess in the long run though that&#039;s better for me that I don&#039;t get sucked into heroin.&nbsp; I would&#039;ve at least liked to feel that amazing buzz just once :(<br /><br />Random update, but I&#039;ve shoved about 60mg of this stuff up my nose over the last 2 hours...and now I&#039;m feeling a mild buzz.&nbsp; My friend is baffled all telling me that&#039;d kill normal users with a moderate tolerance.&nbsp; This same stuff for him got him feeling heavy nods with just 20mg...so I guess that settles it...I just have a retarded tolerance to opiates naturally.

I&#039;ve never heard of anything like that. I suppose it&#039;s not beyond the realm of possibility, but I doubt it. Like I stated earlier in this thread, most people I know that try opiates for the first time feel nothing. <br />Even myself, most times I try any non-psychedelic drug for the first time I have a hard time feeling it. It&#039;s almost like I have to do a drug a few times for my brain to really understand the effects. As I gained more experience with a wide variety of substances, I tended to pick up on the feelings faster, but it still took awhile for me to truly understand them. <br /><br />People do die from their first few times using heroin with exactly your mentality. They are expecting a more powerful feeling, assume that the drug does not have a strong hold on their body, and they continue to take large doses until they overdose. It&#039;s sad, and surprisingly common. Be careful.

				I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;re snorting your H! I loved snorting roxies and stuff but any #4 H i&#039;ve gotten from the road just doesn&#039;t do it for me when I snort it. I know people suggest not to smoke it but I&#039;ve done it and it works really well. Once you get the hang of it you can control how high you get, too. BUT if you want to make sure you get high without wasting any and not using any needles I&#039;d suggest plugging!! <br /><br />Get a baby syringe from the pharmacy. Just walk in and ask the pharmacist. They&#039;ll give it to you. Hell, I walk in and asked &#039;em for needles &quot;cuz I&#039;m a diabetic&quot; and they just handed me a bunch and that&#039;s how I got mine :P<br /><br />but yeah get that baby syringe, mix a couple mL of water and your product, pull it up and plug it into your bum. It absorbs best after you poop, man. <br /><br />I know it&#039;s a strange way to do it but it works really well!<br />

				Snorting heroin is not really that good, kinda dissapointing. IV is subtle in a way I suppose but for me at least it is absolutely fucking amazing, you get this lovely warm feeling wash you, then it gets almost too intense for awhile and dies down into a great relaxed happy mood. No better escape out there bar none IMO. Meth is good but it&#039;s demanding, cocaine is meh never been interested. K-Hole is the only thing that is close and it&#039;s in a very different way yet again more demanding.<br /><br />The beauty of H is that it never asks anything of you. It&#039;s so easy going, that&#039;s why it&#039;s hard to control yourself with it. For me I was not expecting train spotting style stuff as that was obviously BS, I fell in love with the mellow warm high right from the outset.

				Very useful thread, guys, thanks.<br />I want to add that there are lots of movies I watched that discourage to try H, such as<br />Trainspotting<br />Christiane F. - Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo<br />The Basketball Diaries<br />Requiem for a Dream<br /><br />..but nothing, nothing was SO freaking emotional for me, as the final scene in 12th episode, 2nd season of &#039;Breaking Bad&#039;. That&#039;s what I&#039;d remember all the time when H tempts me. Never tried opioids myself though.

So in my opinion safest way all around to do heroin is snort it.

IV is subtle in a way I suppose but for me at least it is absolutely fucking amazing, you get this lovely warm feeling wash you, then it gets almost too intense for awhile and dies down into a great relaxed happy mood. No better escape out there bar none IMO. Meth is good but it&#039;s demanding, cocaine is meh never been interested. K-Hole is the only thing that is close and it&#039;s in a very different way yet again more demanding.<br /><br />The beauty of H is that it never asks anything of you. It&#039;s so easy going, that&#039;s why it&#039;s hard to control yourself with it. For me I was not expecting train spotting style stuff as that was obviously BS, I fell in love with the mellow warm high right from the outset.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />IV good cocaine then tell that again
