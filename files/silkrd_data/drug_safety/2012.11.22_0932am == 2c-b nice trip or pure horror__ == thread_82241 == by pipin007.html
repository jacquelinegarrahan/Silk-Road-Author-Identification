				2C-B is incredible. Absolutely worth a try. Those trip reports you&#039;re reading have a lot more to do with an improper set and setting than the drug itself.<br /><br />I LOVE taking 2C-B with my girlfriend :)

				They say 2cb is like a candyflip, tripping into a usually positive mindset, without much confusion.&nbsp; For me, it&#039;s almost like a pleasant stoned slightly stimmy feeling, with lots of cool colours and hexagonal halos and tracers!&nbsp; I have found this is exactly right.&nbsp; I would recommend it for first timers!&nbsp; Certainly safer than the new NBOMEs too.&nbsp; I am average weight and I love about 30 to 40 mgs.&nbsp; This is on the higher end of dosing.&nbsp; I have found that higher doses don&#039;t really increase confusion too much, so that&#039;s something to remember.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be complacent though of course, start out with maybe 20 if you just want to get a feel first.

				I&#039;m just going to completely disagree with Gibbroni here. I love 2c-b, it&#039;s great, but it is without a doubt the most confusing drug I have ever done at high doses. When I&#039;ve had to take care of people who&#039;ve overdone it the number one thing that happens to them is that they get completely confused. By everything. If you ask them a question they&#039;ll just stare at you blankly. If you TELL them something; like &quot;let&#039;s go and dance for a bit&quot;; they&#039;re fine, they say &quot;yeah!&quot; and go dance and that&#039;s great, but it&#039;s still fucking confusing.<br /><br />I did 28mg once and found it too high a dose (for going out, not for at home introspection)<br /><br />In a club or something, 20-24mg is a pleasant dose and there is little chance of a bad trip at those doses.

				I have a lot of experience with 2c-B and other psychadelics - 2cb is my favorite <br /><br />here are some things I have noted in my experiances with the substance:<br /><br />- each time I take it its a different experiance. Sometimes the body load is really heavy and it feels like I just took MDMA, and sometimes its super heady and i feel like i just took some L...Im not sure what it depends on but its probably not food since i usually take on an empty stomach<br /><br />- peoples sensitivity is ALL OVER THE PLACE with this compound. I&#039;m pretty resistant and have to take 30mg+ for a good trip, but iv given people 18 and they tripped face to the point where it was semi uncomfortable (all experianced trippers)..a friend of mine has taken 40 and felt -nothing-, this same person takes a standard 20mg dose of 2cI and feels it fine - im not sure why this happens - I&#039;m sure of the purity since he got it from me<br /><br />- redoseing works great - i usually tell people that havnt tried it before and are hesitant to take 15 and wait 80 minutes. if they want more take anohter 5, wait another 40 minutes. if you want more wait another 40 and take 3mg....repeat until you reach the desired trip level. it makes people more confortable with takeing a new substance, since you probably wont over do it this way. <br /><br />- most people have a very clear head space on 2cb. i have gone to parties tripping on 25-30mg and nobody knew i was on anything and were shocked when i told them. this however isnt always the case. i gave a girl 20 ones and she lost her head for the night. she was fine in the morning but wont be trying it again...i have found girls are much more sensitive then guys to this stuff so take care<br /><br />- i have heard from a few female experienced trippers that there menstrual cycle can effect the trip - meaning taking it before your cycle or after can alter the experianced - being a guy i have no first hand knowledge of this<br /><br />- 2cb visuals often lack direction or purpose - they are still very beautiful, but because your head is so clear they can get boring after a while. especially when you take a high dose and the visuals are all you can see. I find taking mdma with 2c-b gives the trip and the visuals more direction, and lead to a more pleasent and fruitful experiance. (this is what shulgin himself recommends). People say there are different effects depending on if you take the 2cb before of after the mdma. I havnt noticed that. I say feel the vibe out, and decide what you want to take first. <br /><br />let me know if you have any questions

				Have you done psychedelics before? I always recommend 2C-B to first time psychedelic users... It was my first, and it was a really nice &amp; really mild experience. I personally don&#039;t like it much just because it doesn&#039;t do much for me. Every 2C-B trip I&#039;ve ever had (which is not many, 3 - 4 probably) has just been alot of bright colors and flashing chasers with a barely noticeable euphoria and an annoying headache. But it&#039;s definitely worth a try, I know alot of people love it. I think it would be very difficult to have a bad trip on 2C-B.
