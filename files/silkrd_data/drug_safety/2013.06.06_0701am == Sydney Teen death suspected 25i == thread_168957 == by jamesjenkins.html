				http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/drug-link-to-sydney-teenagers-death-fall/story-e6frg6nf-1226658496485<br /><br />A SYDNEY teenager has died in a fall from a balcony after taking something sold to him as LSD, but which may have been a hallucinogen available online. <br /><br />How does this keep happening, I&#039;ve done 25i multiple times and never felt the urge to run into a pole, or jump out of a building. <br />Whats going on?

				Exactly. Just like when I take phencyclidine, I feel freaking amazing, but when another person takes it, they may rip their bowels out.<br /><br />Psychedelics can be crazy. You need to retain some level of sanity and realize that it is just a trip. That&#039;s the whole point of you taking the drug in the first place, to trip. Not to fall off of a ledge and die.<br /><br />LSD has never been anything but a pleasure to me. Same with ketamine and PCP.

				Yeah, I can see this person taking both TOO MUCH 25i, and in combination with other drugs/alcohol. This combination will create an atmosphere for potential psychotic/suicidal episodes. Overwhelming psychedelic effects might cause someone to want to commit suicide as well,. especially retarded kids who don&#039;t know how to process the mental event.<br /><br />The OD cases are of kids railing fucking fat lines of 25i/25c and snorting them. Considering these NBOMe&#039;s dosage limits are set within the sub-3gram parameters, snorting 10-15 grams of any NBOMe is going to FUCKING KILL YOU.<br /><br />These kids deserve it for practicing such idiotic drug abuse.<br /><br />Tryptamines are fantastic in the correct setting. Correct dosing, good vibes, trusted people, healthy habits and no combinations (other than maybe ketamine or small amounts of MDMA), will result in a fantastic trip with no health risks at all.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve read several trip reports on BlueLight where people took way too much DOM or DOC and had full blackouts.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically they could no longer see anything in the real world around them.&nbsp; Others talk about running around, tearing their clothes off, speaking gibberish and have no recollection<br /><br />Somebody who were to reach this state could easily walk out of a window unintentionally.<br /><br />Has not happened to me yet but I have both DOC and DOM to be trying at some point so we shall see how that goes!

Quite a few of those posts were downvoted. <br /><br />I say, look at the positive karma, not the negatives. Mods like Libertas and users like Jack N Hoff are very good at pointing out the scammers and bad guys. Listen to people like them. You will always have idiots around here downvoting people in the Newbie section. I can&#039;t imagine you getting -9 karma either. You don&#039;t seem like a troll, an idiot, or a scammer to me either. I&#039;m not too worried about it.<br /><br />-21 is sort of annoying, because it&#039;s more likely to raise suspicions (like you asking this question), but nope. I&#039;m pretty sure I didn&#039;t even say anything to the wrong person. I mean, I DID point out one scam with Jack (he pointed it out, I agreed), but so did quite a few others, and I already had the negative karma. One day after I hit 50 posts, I just woke up and had it all. I laughed pretty hard, haha.

There is people who do it in alcohol, without any substance, and if you take some psychedelic.. <br />I don&#039;t think the 25i is the bad boy here, I think that an event like that is even more probable under LSD or shrooms, as 25i doesn&#039;t mess up the &quot;logical&quot; part of the brain as other psychedelics. But with high doses, a sensitive individual, bad set&amp;setting or just coincidence.. anything can happen.<br />In my experience, the worst event I know from my consumption of 25i and my friends, is one who being tripping balls after 1,2mg of intranasally 25i went to a few of his friends and throw away their cocaine lines. And obviously, got hit.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;D I was tripping balls as well, and when I saw him bleeding from the nose I thought that It was the 25i.<br />Pretty funny day all in all.&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D<br />

				It is a matter of media reporting selectively on issues too though. If someone has a few beers, then trips over a balcony railing and falls to his death, that is generally considered to be an &#039;accident&#039; and no mention is made of the alcohol in news reports.<br /><br />If that person had been smoking pot, using LSD, 25i or whatever other illicit drug that would be expressly mentioned in any media coverage of the event. <br /><br />Substance involvement often gets a lot of media attention. Reminds me of a case where someone took a large dose of lariam after suspecting to have contracted malaria. Hallucinations, nightmares and sleepwalking are fairly well documented effects of this highly effective drug. This guy was unfortunate enough to walk under a bus on an intersection and died as a result of that.<br /><br />Should his death be blamed on the side effects of lariam, or should this just count as another traffic death as there are so many? And would anyone have cared about the story at all if he just had been drinking and stumbled under a bus?

				Proper education is also important of course. <br /><br />If you &#039;educate&#039; kids that drugs will kill you in a horrible manner, no matter which drug, no matter what dose, they will at some point find out this is not actually true. Perhaps they&#039;ll have a puff off someones joint and thereby discover that a very small amount of marihuana actually has no long term negative effect, and is very far from deadly. <br /><br />That may not be such a bad thing, but if the lessen was &#039;all illegal drugs are deadly in any amount&#039;, the observation that a small amount of cannabis apparently is not, may make someone doubt if this also holds true for other drugs. <br /><br />Honest education should inform youngsters that having a joint will probably end well, taking a serious dose of mdma can sometimes end badly, and injecting heroin usually does end badly. As long as the official stance on it is that it is all equally horrible, we cannot really expect anyone that has been thought this to understand any differences in substances nor make informed decisions. <br />
