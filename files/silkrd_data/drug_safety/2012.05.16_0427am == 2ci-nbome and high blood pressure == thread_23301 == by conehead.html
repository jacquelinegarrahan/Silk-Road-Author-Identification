				Many have reported various chest tightness and vascular restriction as being a side effect of 2ci-nbome.<br /><br />I checked my blood pressure and found it to get as high as 190/120 on this substance. I have high blood pressure that is usually regulated w/ lisinopril but this stuff kicked lisinopril&#039;s ass.<br /><br />I am interested to know if anyone else has recorded their blood pressure on this stuff. I&#039;m currently waiting for the 4th tab to kick in and I&#039;ll be done with this substance. I don&#039;t want to have a stroke yo! :)

				It&#039;s definitely got cardiac effects, including intesne vasoconstriction which varies greatly between person.<br />I wanted to take my blood pressure on it, but I&#039;d have to go to the chemist tripping balls to do that.

				Thanks for the reply.<br /><br />On day 4 I finally got my blood pressure back down to reasonable levels ~120/80. I have upped my Lisinopril from 30 to 40mg per day. I am hoping there is no interaction between the Ace inhibitor and 2ci-nbome, but I&#039;m going to do some research on Ace inhibitors.<br /><br />At the end of the month, we have an event planned where several friends are going to dose. I think I&#039;m going to try a single, then wait 2 hours, and maybe do another if my pressure isn&#039;t jacked. 4 is out of the question I&#039;m thinking. I&#039;m certain 1 is too small of a dose to get enjoyable effects. 3 was fairly intense, although the 3rd was delayed 3 hours.<br /><br />Day 1 after the dose I had a mild headache as one might expect from having my BP jacked up.. Day 4 was today and I had minor unexplainable muscle cramps. They were not very painful but uncomfortable; maybe 2/10 on the pain chart. Shoulders, butt, arms, legs all got very tight. It passed and may be entirely unrelated. I only mention it because normally I don&#039;t so much as get a headache. Just in case others have the same effects, they will know they may not be alone.

				I had my BP regulated to 120/75 and took 1mg of 2ci-nbome. Body effects seemed stronger than on the heavier dose before. My BP came up to ~170/100 and rather quickly returned to ~140/90 which is not very dangerous for short periods.<br /><br />I am going to have 1-2 more experiences with this stuff. I&#039;m planning to do 1mg in my gum for 1 hour and the pull it out and put another one in another spot. I would describe the 1mg dose as very mild tripping. Even at 3mg, the closed eye visuals were very much there, but dark and weak. open eye distortions were quite fun. On 1mg, closed eye visuals were a little weaker, and open eye distortions were very mild. Reality was enhanced. Colors were stronger. That&#039;s about it. The body buzz is VERY nice with sex. Highly recommended that you have sex on the come up ~1hr in or so. It&#039;s super nice.
