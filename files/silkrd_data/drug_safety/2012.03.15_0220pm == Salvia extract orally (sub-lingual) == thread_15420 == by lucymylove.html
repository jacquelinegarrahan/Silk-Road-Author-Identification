				Hello folks,<br />I would like to know if it&#039;s possible to take Salvia Extract orally.<br />You see, the issue is that for intense trip I need very little salvia extract ~20mg, and I don&#039;t know how to smoke such little piece of shit ;) I have an idea to mix it with pipe-tobaco, grind it well, and put it in bong. But actually I don&#039;t like tobaco and don&#039;t know how it will interfere with Salvia.<br /><br />How do you smoke little pieces of salvia extract ?<br /><br />So, what do you think folks ?

				When you guys say salvia extract, are you talking about the salvia extract available at smoke shops? Or a liquid extract?<br /><br />Stupid question, but can&#039;t hurt to ask.

				Bonging tobacco isn&#039;t a great idea unless you have lungs of steel. You could try mixing with some weed. A low potency bud would be best because you don&#039;t want it to interfere too much with the salvia. <br /><br />What is the concentration of your salvia extract? You could just get a lower concentration like 10x. That&#039;s what I used when I tried it and 100mg was enough to have an intense trip for a few minutes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15420.msg152995#msg152995">Quote from: jimmyg on March 16, 2012, 01:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When you guys say salvia extract, are you talking about the salvia extract available at smoke shops?

As opposed to Salvia leaves. Extracts usually have a concentration eg 10x which means 1g or extract = 10g of leaf material.

				just chew on the leaves.<br /><br />rehydrate them in a glass of water for 5-10 min, then bite down on a wad and let all the juices absorb sublingually.&nbsp; chew once every 2 min or so and then spit it out after 20 min total.&nbsp; repeat until you are tripping as hard as your desire.&nbsp; <br /><br />its a smooth transition, but shit can still get pretty weird in there when you chew through over 5 grams.

The quid method (chewing and holding the salvia leaves works; however, that is due to the number of leaves and the length of time).&nbsp; The small amount of extract would start to deteriorate quickly - too quick to get anything off of it.<br /><br />The sub-lingual method works with salvia tincture (fantastic, btw).&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that it is much, much better than smoking as the entire trip can last up to three to five hours vs. the short period when smoked.<br /><br />Also, if your friend does smoke it make sure they use a torch lighter.&nbsp; In order to activate Saliva needs an extremely high temp. <br /><br />Good luck and let us know how it goes.
