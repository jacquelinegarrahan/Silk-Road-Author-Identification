				I prefer shooting, after I snorted it one time I HATED the taste and from then on I decided to stick with IV. Does anyone have any suggestion on how to ingest heroin without the taste and without having to shoot it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would rather snort but I hate the taste, I hate to IV because the damage it does to my body.&nbsp; I want to make sure it has a high absorption rate whichever way I choose to use. <br /><br />THANKS ALL!!!

				Shooting: Stronger buzz, Shorter Duration of High.......IMO when it comes to #4, Its meant to be put into my veins. Now i have never tried #3 it doesn&#039;t come around here but from what i have heard(my sources may be unreliable dont take my word) that is the better substance to be smoked and/or snorted. I used to snort #4(the only h that comes around here) and when i shot up my first 3 times i loved it, however at the time being new to IV I felt very uncomfortable transporting a needle in my pocket in my friends car when going out of town with a friend for the weekend with a friend who didn&#039;t know my issue.(haha yes i know VERY ironic considering i had no problem keeping the class 1 substance basically stitched to my pocket so i wouldn&#039;t be sick all weekend.). however when it came time the next morning and getting ready to indulged in my first high of the day, i realized that it was naive of me NOT to bring a rig or 2! so i had to end up sniffing the stuff after having experimented with shooting it the past 2 or 3 days. So obv I got used it &amp; got high but had to do more than i would then when shooting it. it lasted longer but just felt less effective, and the days were so hot at these shows we went to i was just dragging along. once i got back home i had thankfully left a bag and my rigs there so i would have something to return to because i always somehow end up doing whats in my pocket in the long run, idk if anyone else is like that haha. so once i got back home and was able to shoot up, it was great and it was the method i stuck with for the rush is just unbeatable, now i did say at first that i didnt need to use as much when shooting vs snorting, but with time i came to figure out that its really all the same, that rush sure as hell is not the same when shooting, but i just mean consumption of the dope in general. tolly builds quick, and the dope too no matter how you choose to take it. so again my conclusion(and sorry for the long post)- Snorting: longer duration of high, lighter buzz. Shooting: Stronger buzz, Shorter Duration of High<br />-DK

				snorting it is just an overall simpler experience and the high lasts longer and you don&#039;t build a tolerance as fast. <br /><br />Basically going to the needle is just harder,faster,stronger but that applies to your tolerance, withdrawals, money spent, chance of ODing, etc...<br /><br />Personally, I more or less have had a strong dislike of needles since childhood and I happen to live where the powder form isn&#039;t only widely available, but rather potent on average as well. So it&#039;s easy for me to say snorting it is more enjoyable in the grand scheme of things. <br /><br />Plus, having syringes on you is an automatic red flag to cops, regardless of whether they are against the law

				Ive plugged other things but never H.<br /><br />But I hear plugging H is really good and the ROA is really good as well.<br /><br />What about oral Ive always wondered this but I have never done the research.<br /><br />Ive only done H a hand full of times and I didnt order that much to begin with so I havent experimented much.

				there&#039;s really no reason to over ingest heroin orally, the absorption just isn&#039;t there. Some people find plugging it to be better than intranasal but it is also more of a...process... if you will. Snorting it just always seemed easier and with a quicker onset to me. <br /><br />If you do go the rectal route just make sure you have clean bowels and lay on your side for a good 15-20 mins immediately after you do it. Also, this is pretty explicit, but you really gotta get the oral syringe deep in there for it to work good. That way not as much has a chance of leaking out.<br /><br />Ok, time to go eat lunch, good talk
