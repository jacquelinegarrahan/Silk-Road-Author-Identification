				So when I first started to roll five years ago, I did it for a month straight and then quit and then last year did it a couple times and quit and tonight I&#039;m going to have at it again. Point is though when I first did it I was with my my ex and our friend and she had two cats. Well she said not to touch the animals or her baby niece while rolling because it could effect them. So I didn&#039;t and since then I have (had) pets but I haven&#039;t touched them whenever I was rolling to be sure. So am I being too meticulous or can I pet them? Now to me, logically it seems that if I were to touch them, it wouldn&#039;t do any harm because they didn&#039;t ingest the MDMA and I did. But I over think quite constantly.

				I have absolutely no idea why touching anyone else would be harmful if you were rolling. It&#039;s not like you start sweating and dripping MDMA everywhere, so I don&#039;t really see why it would be an issue. I bet petting a cat would be awesome, but just resist the temptation to grab a handful of fur!

				Kitty Cats or baby nieces cannot get&nbsp; the drug by licking your skin after you have orally ingested a pill.&nbsp; The myth is a spinoff of the fact that when handling Molly, Meth or any other powder for that matter, there are trace undetectable small amounts left on your fingers and if a small animal and or baby licked it it would not be a good scene.&nbsp; Babies brains are NOT designed to handle narcs.

				Just wanted to mention that you&#039;re not quitting anything if you continue to do it. It&#039;s like when people say they quit smoking, but then start again three months later. Sorry but it really bugs me when people do that. Also why would you not touch something just because you&#039;re high? I fucking touch everything when I roll because it feels amazing, you should try it sometime.

But I swear, we&#039;ve been on shrooms around the cat at least three or four times and every time we&#039;re shrooming the cat comes over to us and will walk/rub itself around our legs and it&#039;s genuinely playful..... SO WEIRD.

				She&#039;s been my ex for three years now. Haha, that woman is pretty good at being evil. Had me fooled for years.<br /><br />Gary- I didn&#039;t mean like quitting for good, I just mean, doing a month straight wasn&#039;t good at all for any of us. I just took breaks I suppose. And I will touch more things when rolling now. <br /><br />Man, her cats knew something was up when we would roll. But last night when I did it, my cat all chill and shit and he passed out on my chest. I have a feeling though it&#039;ll be different if I take shrooms or lsd. Freak out and jazz.

				animals definitely know you&#039;re tripping... or maybe not &#039;tripping&#039; but they definitely know something&#039;s up.. something&#039;s DIFFERENT<br /><br />anyone that denies you that ability to touch a domesticated animal while high is dumb... animals are one of the best companions while in the deep end of a trip

				It&#039;s a generally accepted notion that animals can tell when your tripping and do indeed act differently.&nbsp; Now the next stage is figuring out why or how they sense this......it&#039;s extremely interesting to say the least.

				Yeah, I&#039;m a firm believer in the fact that pets can be a HUGE positive while under the influence of pretty much any drug. <br /><br />I know for a fact that one of my cats, a &quot;tuxedo&quot; cat (whom we&#039;ll call Tux to protect his identity ;) ), has helped two people out of a bad trip. One of those people he didn&#039;t even know. <br /><br />He can definitely tell when my friends and I are on a mind-altering substance, and he&#039;s usually curious about what we&#039;re up to and how we&#039;re feeling. He&#039;s always sitting on me or next to me unless he&#039;s eating or stalking something/someone. One time, my roommate and I shared a quarter of shrooms, and the roommate starting getting really scared and cried about how it was stupid of him to have taken the mushrooms, what if he died, etc. (this was not his first time doing shrooms :P ). I did my best to talk him out of it, but the most help came from Tux. My roommate sat on the floor and basically went into the fetal position, weeping, with me trying to talk to him about how he was going to be okay (to no avail) when Tux walked up to him and started basically making my roommate pet him. He&#039;d meow softly and inquisitively and then burrow under his arm and make my roommate&#039;s hand slide over his head and down his back. He only had to do it a couple of times before my roommate started to pet him and respond to the meows by talking back to Tux. It took my cat between thirty seconds and a minute to bring my friend back to a totally happy place, where he could appreciate what was going on without becoming overwhelmed. <br /><br />One more stupid pets &amp; drugs story (and it is REALLY stupid). When we (me and the same roommate) were really young (like 17), we had a ton of relatively weak rolls, and we got together with a bunch of our friends at someone&#039;s house to take them one day. We brought our pitbull-mutt along, because she loves people and is one of the nicest dogs ever. Well, we were coming up on the rolls and someone asked me if I thought it would kill a dog her size to take one of the pills. I said I didn&#039;t think so, based on body weight, but other than that I had no idea, since I&#039;d never read anything about dogs and MDMA. They responded by saying &quot;Good, because she ate one of mine.&quot; My response: ಠ_ಠ . It turned out to actually be fine, and the dog seemed to really enjoy the experience... She just walked around with gigantic pupils rubbing up against people, loving pets, drinking water, and occasionally urinating on the floor. Can&#039;t say I&#039;ll ever administer drugs to a pet (mostly just because they can&#039;t tell me if they don&#039;t want it), but the unintended experiment worked out well, all things considered. I mean, we could have been mauled by an over-stimulated pitbull. Good thing she&#039;s a lover not a fighter. :)

				frogtrap - Thank god your dog was okay.<br /><br />On the subject of dogs and smoke, a friend I used to know had a beautiful dog whose breed I can&#039;t for the life of me remember, but sometimes she&#039;d come over while we were smoking and my friend would blow his hit about a foot from her, and if she wanted it she&#039;d take it herself. She&#039;d usually have one or two on rare occasions then walk away satisfied.<br /><br />She also looked extraordinary on acid, and her movements seemed awesomely graceful. Awesome in the classical sense, that is, as in inspiring a sense of awe and wonderment. So fun to pet.<br /><br />Though if we were tripping or rolling too hard she&#039;d leave. Guess we&#039;d get a little too out there for her, though we were always careful to pet her very softly and play nice.

However, I really have known a pot smoking dog. The house this dog lived in was one of the strangest and most terrifying habitations I have ever known and the subject of another conversation entirely. The street address was 420 if you can even believe that. <br />Anyway, this dog would take honest to god shotguns from everyone in the room voluntarily and by its own will. It would get right up yer face when exhaling and sort of lick the smoke out of the air. He loved it. You could smoke a blunt with 5 people and this dog would want a shout gun for every toke every person took.<br />I have no idea how this dog learned to do that, but really though, never blow smoke in a pet&#039;s face. They hate it. (at least on doesn&#039;t)

				I&#039;m going to agree on not blowing any kind of smoke in an animal&#039;s face. Someone I used to know used to do that and I&#039;d yell at him but the dog was his and I was in his house and he reiterated it constantly. It&#039;s just not cool.
