				So I&#039;m recently new to Meth (if you&#039;ve seen my first time post it may have been good for a laugh or an eye roll ???) and am thinking about placing an order for MrFireUK&#039;s 1g Amphetamine/Speed. The only problem is I can&#039;t seem to find any solid info on the differences. Is there any? Would administration and dosaging be about the same as Meth?<br /><br />

Im only talking about smoking it. not IV.<br /><br />but when you have speed of lab quality like mrfire, the dosage will be much closer&nbsp; to what you would take for meth. <br />(even tho not smoked, you need to be careful how much to have )<br />product will&nbsp; be very strong, very euphoric, with a pleasant energizing without any nervous tension/anxiety..if used safely.<br /><br />you should trawl the meth reviews for really precise info on what makes meth good or bad.<br />generally speaking, when i stopped speed when i was young and moved onto meth, it was because the average cut to the max speed often lacked&nbsp; euphoria and left me fiending for more.<br /><br />then meth came along and A)i could smoke it , and the way it comes on was fast and appealing;-)<br />B) it was more potent and had a high that in those days i could only describe as &quot;...hey this ice stuff feels kinda like the good vibes you get from mdma...&quot;<br /><br />so i guess apart from studying all the synthesis facts and precise medical descriptions of the difference between methamphetamine/amphetamine, you will have to see which one &#039;does it&#039; for you .;-)<br /><br />im a meth fan, but still appreciate high quality speed like mrfire, its the only type of speed ill bother to come out of the woodwork for ;-) <br />i guess i enjoy a change now and then. i know folk who only touch pure speed, and just dont like meth for whatever personal reason they have, and there are ones who enjoy both.<br /><br />i hope that gives you a bit of an idea. <br /><br /><br />i say find the best meth u can, and if you&#039;re starting out, smoke in a glass pipe, begin with&nbsp; 30mgs, and go from there. you&#039;ll know when youve had enough puffs;-)

				Very detailed post! Thanks for the info. Yeah, what you said makes sense so I guess that&#039;s why I haven&#039;t found a lot of good info on it. UK&#039;s speed seems so cheap so I figured I&#039;d give it a go and compare it to my meth(at about 4-5x the price) experience.

				I saw a study where equivalent doses of dexamphetamine (the &quot;good part&quot; in EU amphetamine/adderall) and methamphetamine were given orally to people. Something like 30mg dex to 15mg meth, for example. There was no general preference for either drug in terms of liking the effects and they seemed almost indistinguishable.<br /><br />On Youtube :&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wNS_aRxTqs<br /><br />Main difference is meth lasts much, much longer and can be smoked. I personally find that it has much greater euphoria but is less suitable for doing things. After a few days on amphetamine my house is very tidy - with meth, its tidy for a day then somehow becomes extremely untidy&nbsp; 8)

Most meth is racemic, meaning a mixture of the 2 isomers, being d,l-methamphetamine.

				Thanks all, this is some really good information! I wasn&#039;t aware of these differing compounds within meth/amphetamine that could make one batch very strongly from the next. <br /><br />Guess I have some more experimenting to do ;)<br /><br />Cheers!

				The methamphetamine sticky at the top of the &#039;Drug Safety&#039; forum is good to read, also.<br /><br />Try and keep your dosages as low and infrequent as possible. Amphetamines are amazing, but they&#039;ll sink their teeth into you right quick.

I cant get any dirty urines..I know dont use but if it were that easy... Right now I take between 15-30 pills a day @ 30mg ea...they really dont do much I stopped 100 % for 45 days and started again and not much of a difference so I need something stronger ...Can anyone help me ???&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks

If you really need a kick, and you&#039;re willing to fuck yourself up in ways nobody really knows about yet and you&#039;re POSITIVE you won&#039;t get tested for at least 4 days (5-7 would be safer)... Combine 2-fma (2-fluoromethamphetamine, a research chemical; can find it here pretty often -- snort it), your adderall (swallow obviously), meth (doesn&#039;t matter, just get it in you), and a couple of caffeine pills or a few cups of coffee.&nbsp; Sounds laughable, but the caffeine makes a real difference.&nbsp; Do NOT do it for more than a day or two at a time.&nbsp; For one, your heart may explode for all I know (fuck if I know why mine never gives me trouble).&nbsp; For two, nobody knows what 2-fma does to you.&nbsp; It&#039;ll also show up as meth on your tests.&nbsp; For three, if you keep that up, you won&#039;t be able to get out of bed in the morning until you&#039;re jacked out of your mind again.<br /><br />Please do realize that&#039;s a very bad idea and you may seriously have an aneurysm.&nbsp; Don&#039;t haunt me for killing you or anything, heh.
