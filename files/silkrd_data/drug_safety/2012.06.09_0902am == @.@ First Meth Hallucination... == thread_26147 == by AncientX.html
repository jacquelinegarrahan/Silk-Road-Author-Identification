				So, i&#039;ve been coming down now for a good solid, 4 -5 hours or so. I feel &quot; okay &quot;&nbsp; just really hungry, and i know my body is tired...<br />I took a shower, to help kinda ease the icky feeling i constantly have.Went to my room, sat on my bed, and closed my eyes a moment. Opened them, very noticable waves in my curtains like youd see on lsd or mushrooms. It only lasted a brief second, but if i close my eyes for 10 seconds or so, and then open them i can see little blurs. @.@ so my body must be fuckin tireeeeeeeeddddd as fuckkkkk lol <br /><br />But looking over the trip, since noon thursday, It has to be the dope i bought...no dope i ever had, has ever really given me such a gnarly comedown. Like, its normal, just thinking back, im wishing there was couple times where i wouldnt have re-dosed.<br /><br />Oh well, its a learning experience all around. But this comedown definitely sucks, and im going to be moderating the fuck out of my dosages now with this new gear.<br />( I&#039;m not sure the exact amount ive dosed since thursday, but i know it was about a total of&nbsp; 6 - 7 specs of shards.throught out the past 48 hours. ) But in honesty, im kinda scared to try an sleep.... Like... i know im doing okay, and nothing is wrong with me aside from the fact theres meth trying to leave my system. but i&#039;ve never really had to fall asleep while im coming down, my highs have always just been smooth sailing mostly, an its just this intense uneasy feeling this batch is giving me... <br /><br />Any suggestions to help ease my discomfort would be such a great help... <br /><br />i dont have any perscriptions i could use to knock my ass out, or any kind of sleeping aid ( Weed isnt helping...I have some fuckin schwag... )

				You&#039;ve never experienced the Sketch on a comedown before? How many times have you done it?<br /><br />48 hours really shouldn&#039;t be enough to start inducing hardcore hallucinations. It&#039;s more mental if you haven&#039;t hit that milestone yet. But it&#039;s really nothing, at least nothing like day 4-5.<br /><br />Actually day 3 without sleep is the most fun, because you get to create your own reality of sorts.

				no, ive experienced it, its just, with this gear, idk, it&nbsp; seems a little different than normal... And also, i try to never push 48 hours on this shit, fuck i prefer to not even push 24 hours, i just like get a little torqued up, not fucking messed up like i am right now lol. <br /><br />@.@ but like i mentioned...hehe if i woulda skipped like my last 2 re-doses i think id be 100% perfect and would problably be sleeping by now<br /><br /><br />But as each minutes passes.... i notice the drug is fading a bit more. Slowly but surely i will be back to um... well....i was gonna say normal...but me like this, in this state....definitely not my norm.<br />

				Yeah I&#039;ve learned to continue enjoy the comedowns, no matter how low it goes, but it wasn&#039;t always that way. These days, it mostly just involves crashing. Nothing like an acid comedown where all you&#039;re good for is staring at walls.<br /><br />But even after going with little sleep for a number of days and sketching out, you sort of get to enjoy the massive/pain paranoia in a masochistic sort of way because it feels so real. It&#039;s really hard to explain but I&#039;ve spoken to others who share my fondness for this state so I know it&#039;s not just some personal idiosyncratic weirdness on my part.<br /><br />Also, the key to being able to have the best time when getting spun is being in top physical shape. It allows you to stay higher for longer and your body can handle the thrashing you&#039;re giving it. And when you&#039;re in the state you&#039;re in now coming down, there&#039;s nothing better than going into the gym and working out. It&#039;s hard as fuck, but if you can get through it your body feels SO FUCKING GOOD. It&#039;s like a body high in itself.&nbsp;

				I stayed up for 4 days, taking a few large puffs every 3-8 hours, then I went for a walk at 2 in the morning (homeless at the time).<br /><br />When I was about to pull into a parking lot to park my car, I saw a silhouette of a man holding a dog on a leash. The dog pulled away and ran a short way into the road. I swerved around the dog (thankfully barely &quot;needed&quot; to swerve) and the dog and man both vanished.<br /><br />It was slightly chilly out, and I had a wind in my face (I would&#039;ve gone the other direct but for that I was trying to reach a particular place to hike by sunrise). When the wind kicked up, I had to stop and turn away. Many times I immediately began to fall asleep standing up.<br /><br />Then I started seeing my friends in the driver seats of cars parked on the side of the street. I would be pleasantly surprised and being talking to them, having actual dialogue, before they disappeared as I grew near. After a while I began to recognize the hallucinations and call them out (quietly).<br /><br />One dialogue lasted about 30 seconds most likely though it felt like minutes. Another time, as I neared my friend slowly faded except for their cheekbones, nose, and eye/brow area, and when I backed up he faded in, and then I neared again and he faded out as before, the same parts of his face remaining, which then became actual smudges on the window when I got close enough.<br /><br /><br />No part of that was unpleasant except for the panic of the dog moment, but then I&#039;ve also always been interested in experiencing the effects of severe sleep deprivation, ever since I was a wee lad. So the experience as a whole, especially coming to recognize the hallucinations before they disappeared, fascinated me as it was happening.

				I hated how i felt, During the shower i took while the initial comedown was happening, i knew my would wall asleep if i didn&#039;t stay focused. <br />I normally like to sit on the floor of the shower, an turn the water up hotter, so that way, by the time the misting water is actually hitting me, its the same temp as it was before, only now im warming my entire body up, Its like one big wet fucking blanket covering my nodding ass. I nodded off for like 4 -5 minutes, luckily with my head in safe spot, not directly under the water, or any water flowing up my nose or down my throat. <br /><br />But the feeling of being so tired, and the initial paranoia , i despise it.... i hate feeling like that... i was in my room, with locked doors, laying on my bed, staring at the crack between the floor and my door, watching what seemed to be flickering shadows, as if somone had stepped up to my door, and was just standing there..., Or, i&#039;d close my eyes for a brief second to see if my body was finally ready to fall asleep on its own, but as i&#039;d open them, i&#039;d notice what seemed to be a single bug, or spider like insect, burrowing out of the wall ( its was a very vague visual, and i have bad eyes sight as it is, so it was blurry, but thats what i made it out to be. <br /><br />but the funny thing is, i sat up to smoke a cigarette, and im thinking that im seeing another bug, this time in the carpet, i shake my head a bit fiercely, trying to shake some clarity into my vision, and low and behold....a real bug lol... i squashed it , an honestly thought for brief moment that it was a meth visual...and literally spoke out &quot; What the fuck....the visuals are the most realistic i&#039;ve ever seen... &quot; @.@ <br /><br />Thank god i came down, got rest, ate, took showers, brushed and flossed. @.@ was such a fucking hectic comedown... <br /><br />On a side note, is it just me. OR do you guys brush your teeth alot when you tweak out, if you have the opportunity to? <br /><br />I do, quite often, usually after im done with a pipe or, if i feel icky shit on my teeth while my tongue goes ape shit crazy in my mouth @.@

				Looper!!! the hallucination is technically &quot;drug induced phycosis&quot; Congrats on having brain damage, now your just like me! My soul still vibrates on a different frequency after all these years, allowing me to see all sorts of things that most people cant. Being in Australia we have a spirit called a &quot;wadatchi&quot; and it is basically an aboriginal ghost. they stay near their sacred sites and will occasionally communicate. What did you see? and can you psi communicate with those on a bender with you?

				like a few have said, the hallucinations are not really induced by meth, but are more of a by-product of meth - collateral damage. They are caused by sleep deprivation coupled with a lack of nutrition. I have found that even staying awake for 4 nights with my partner, which include a day of work, and heaps of things that needed to be done like shopping etc., lol, we experienced very minimal hallucinations or visuals besides the &quot;rain&quot; vision which we&#039;d normally get after about 36 hours.. <br /><br />What helped most of all was eating almost as per normal. Whenever you feel a pang of hunger, even if it&#039;s there for only a few minutes, LISTEN to it! Quickly down something relatively nutritious. Doesn&#039;t actually have to be healthy, you need sufficient carbs, protein and fat (good fat for the brain). If you can also add anti-oxidants and vitamins to this mix, awesome! Have an &quot;Up n Go&quot; - in aussieland they are breakfast milk drinks and as much as I hate drinking milk, these have fast absorbing protein in an ok dose, carbs and fats. Down some anti-oxidant caps and vitamin pills while drinking that, and away you go!<br /><br />During binges where we&#039;re less dilligent with foods, our worst kind of hallucinations, and basically the only ones I get are visions of shortish (~1cm) long hairs moving/dancing along surfaces.. mainly along skin, worst is when it&#039;s along your partner&#039;s skin to the point that you can&#039;t look at them.. &lt;TOO MUCH INFO ALERT&gt;Or if you&#039;re in the toilet doing a numero uno, look down at your cock to see these hairs all over the tip moving around to the point you can kind of feel them.&lt;/TOO MUCH INFO ALERT&gt;. I can generally make them disappear with my mind but with time, that gets impossible...<br /><br />I find they are an &quot;evolution&quot; of the fuzzy straight edge visuals that start about 36 hours in and get progressively stronger until your brain needs to make some sort of sense of it and comes up with this freaky shit.<br /><br />Anyone else get these hairy fukers??

				Have not done meth in 10 years but had mad hallucinations on it. Different than any other, basically shapes appearing. They are called Shadow Bunnies around here. It is definitely sleep deprivation/malnutrition. Personally I would not recommend doing it at all. Have seen lives ruined as a lot of friends (and friend&#039;s mothers) have been hurt by it. But I have no qualms of it being used safely. <br /><br />I find it hard to believe that this comes as a surprise to the poster. He must not have gotten good shit before. BTW my experience recently with a good friend who went through a phase (2-3 nights up a week) he got super emotional on the come down. Keep that in mind. MFer talked me into driving to visit him &#039;cause he was crying and shit and got a DUI on the way home.&nbsp; Also he had seizures at 30 (also abuser of of opiates)&nbsp;
