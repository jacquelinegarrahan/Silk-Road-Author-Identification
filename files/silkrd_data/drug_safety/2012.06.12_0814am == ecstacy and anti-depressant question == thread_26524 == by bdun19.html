				If you&#039;re on certain types of anti-depressants, will this prevent you from feeling the effects of ecstacy? i take 60mg of paxil a day, and i have no idea whether it&#039;s true or not but i&#039;ve always sworn that no matter how good the product, i&#039;ve never felt anything while taking my paxil. I would really like to try some of the purer e that&#039;s on here, i have no idea what levels of mdma the stuff i used to get had in it, but i really don&#039;t wanna go off of my paxil to get the full sensation of the roll, so anyone&#039;s knowledgeable input would really help me out, thanks!<br />j

				It&#039;s almost impossible to roll on an SSRI and Paxil is an SSRI&nbsp; :-\. You might feel a hint of something, but it wouldn&#039;t be worth it...

				Generally when taking anti-depressants its usually a good idea to steer pretty clear from MDMA for a couple reason. For one, you are depressed and taking drugs to stabilize your mood, and taking a psychoactive, brain heavy, neurotoxic drug like MDMA isn&#039;t going to do any good. Also, if you are taking a med that is a MAOI (a few anti-depression meds are) theres a pretty good chance that you could die..

				When I was on SSRI&#039;s it took about two months after coming off them for me to even begin to feel the MDMA rolls again.

Removing the cause will often quickly reduce the symptoms though, so if you are ever found in this conditions its extremely important to tell medical staff what you have been taking (if you still can) so they know whats going on, and act accordingly. The symptoms are&nbsp; not very specific, and attempted treatment without such knowledge could make things worse.&nbsp; <br />

				Paxil works in part by fucking with your serotonin metabolism, increasing its activity. MDMA works by antagonizing the effects of serotonin, removing it from its binding sites on proteins, causing it to be expelled from cells and catabolized. If you have higher serotonin activity than normal the MDMA will be less effective; this is also why 5-HTP dampens the effects of MDMA.
