				Well I&#039;m sure I&#039;m going to seem amatuer to the fine sirs of this forums, considering my drug experience doesn&#039;t go too far beyond diverted perscription Ritalin and hitting the higher plateus of DXM use. Since I&#039;ve found this place, i&#039;ve had some serious eyes pointed towards&nbsp; LSD, psyclobin, MDMA, DMT, and maybe Ketamine. Am I ready? Is there something I should do to prepare myself?

				I&#039;d go with LSD or mushrooms.&nbsp; They are physically the safest of the drugs you listed, and also provide the best psychedelic experience, in my opinion. DMT is great but it may be too intense if you&#039;ve never experienced psychedelics before. MDMA and ketamine are worth trying but there is some evidence, although it has not been conclusively proven, that they damage the brain.<br /><br />As for preparation, just make sure you start with a small dosage, and make sure you are in a good mood, and in a comfortable and safe environment.

Your chances of having a bad time are virtually none. Worst case scenario you will get anxious on the come up, but once it fully hits you will be the happiest you have ever been. ;)<br /><br />And as far as LSD vs Shrooms, I&#039;d say go for the LSD. It may last longer, but most people I talk to say shrooms are more emotional and can be harder to control.<br /><br />And DMT....that&#039;s a beast you only want to tackle after many psychedelic trips. :P

				Go with MDMA as a first time. As said, it&#039;s really hard to have a bad time with it, and you&#039;ll feel great physically and emotionally. Start off with 100 to 150mg as a first dose. Before trying MDMA, I&#039;d never done any psychedelic drugs, although I was very experienced with opiates. I&#039;d always had reservations about trying LSD or mushrooms, but once I&#039;d had MDMA a couple times, my fears and nervousness regarding stronger psychedelics just went away, opening the door for me to start experiencing those drugs.

				I had MDMA for the first time last week.&nbsp; Don&#039;t believe the hype - it&#039;s better than you can imagine.&nbsp; ;D

				Upgrade from DXT? Anything - that was a bit TOO dissociative an effect on me - LSD is a good choice - you can trip &amp; still operate the stereo, or look at stars, and it IS a hell-of-a drug.
