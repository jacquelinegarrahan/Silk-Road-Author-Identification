				I was just curious since I have the try everything at least once mentality. I am however a casual user of heroin, but I feel like I would try meth and even crack and PCP at some point just to see what it&#039;s like. Also, I don&#039;t tend to repeat things or at least limit usage(such as with H), this is why I like to just try. So is there anything that, after your experience, you wish you never even did in the first place? <br /><br />I could have done without MDPV personally.

				Heroin would be on my list of things not try, at least not injected.<br /><br />Another one would be meth though - it doesnt seem like that much fun considering the bad outcome of addiction.

Methamphetamine for me was pretty addicting, but I have it much more under control after a couple years misfortune, now only monthly use. Also smoked crack a couple of times, but it&#039;s such a bad comedown - and with meth and d-amp at hand, I never understood the appeal. PCP has a lot of bad press, but people who&#039;ve done it know it&#039;s not all the cannibal stories make it out to be. It&#039;s a lot of fun, really - and it&#039;s own animal in the family of dissociatives, though not as fun as K, IMO.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I could have done without MDPV personally. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, definitely. For me the side effects were so bad, but apparently a lot of people still like it and are willing to buy it. The first week of regular PV use was amazing but it quickly descended into paranoid hell. Wish I never went that route and stuck to my expensive MA.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Don&#039;t have an interest in trying Duster or Fentanyl honestly, so I guess that&#039;s good. But yea, I don&#039;t inject H either, I have, but never again. And yes, MDPV does NOT have good side effects....

Although I will say that the DMT trip seems a lot less... influenced by your mind than other psychedelics - I guess that your demons wouldn&#039;t factor into it much, if that makes sense. Its so other worldy that you dont inflence it all that much, in my experience at least. Psychedelics are my thing though, hehe, I have the &quot;try them all&quot; mentality towards them, not so much for stims/I react badly to opiates/other drugs have just never captured my mind like psychs.<br /><br />One love,<br />S

				Jimsonweed is supposed to be a pretty frightening experience. I started researching it after reading Hunter S. Thompson&#039;s &quot;Hey Rube&quot; in which he mentions it. Almost all of the Erowid trip reporters say they wouldn&#039;t wish the trip on their worst enemy and felt lucky to still be alive. I am still curious of course tho&nbsp; ;D

				Datura for sure, plus I&#039;d have to say PCP too -- I&#039;ve just heard so much negative shit, I&#039;d be scared to try it.

				IMO it&#039;s hard to say what drugs one should not indulge in. Isn&#039;t it a common fact that drugs effect people differently? A lot of people love weed, I don&#039;t like it. Some people prefer opiates over stims and vice-versa. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to say what drug someone shouldn&#039;t touch, yeah PCP has its horror stories but some people enjoy it. I prefer stims to depressants.. some people prefer depressants. I know people who have had panic attacks from smoking weed, I also know people who feel more relaxed after smoking a joint. Weed gives some people anxiety, but it also takes away anxiety for some people. <br /><br />It&#039;s personal preference IMO when drugs are concerned. Everyone is going to have a drug that doesn&#039;t agree with them. There&#039;s a lot of &#039;BAD&#039; drugs out there because they&#039;re considered addictive. Some people can try Meth once, some people try it once and want more and more.<br /><br />Sorry if I couldn&#039;t answer your question, but I&#039;m finding it difficult to find a drug that no one should try once. Obviously if someone has an addictive personality, drugs such as Meth and H should be avoided in order to avoid potential addiction. <br /><br />Sollem

Isn&#039;t it a common fact that drugs effect people differently? A lot of people love weed, I don&#039;t like it. Some people prefer opiates over stims and vice-versa. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to say what drug someone shouldn&#039;t touch, yeah PCP has its horror stories but some people enjoy it. I prefer stims to depressants.. some people prefer depressants. I know people who have had panic attacks from smoking weed, I also know people who feel more relaxed after smoking a joint. Weed gives some people anxiety, but it also takes away anxiety for some people. <br /><br />It&#039;s personal preference IMO when drugs are concerned. Everyone is going to have a drug that doesn&#039;t agree with them. There&#039;s a lot of &#039;BAD&#039; drugs out there because they&#039;re considered addictive. Some people can try Meth once, some people try it once and want more and more.<br /><br />Sorry if I couldn&#039;t answer you question, but I&#039;m finding it difficult to find a drug that no one should try once. Obviously if someone has an addictive personality, drugs such as Meth and H should be avoided in order to avoid potential addiction. <br /><br />Sollem<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I find the drugs that people are interested in, as well as the ones that they&#039;re afraid of, can be the best indicator of a person&#039;s personality. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed.

I&#039;ve used IV heroin (and pretty much every other opiate around) for years recreationally, and have never even been close to addiction.<br /><br />But then, I thought I&#039;d try coke, because it had always been on my list, and with SR I was able to get some easily. My preferred ROA is IV, so even though I&#039;d never tried it, I decided to IV the first time. It felt great, but at the same time I didn&#039;t like it very much at all. But as I was coming down, I was thinking AT THE SAME TIME, &quot;I fucking hate this shit&quot; and &quot;Damn! I&#039;ve got to get me more of this&quot;. So now coke is on my list of no-no drugs because I felt extremely compelled to take more DESPITE the fact I didn&#039;t even like it.

				Plenty of horrible drugs out there for sure!<br /><br />One interesting case is &#039;krokodil&#039;, basically crudely synthesized desmorphine with most reactants left in it. Desomorphine is a very potent opioid as is, but the crude synthetic result seems to frequently cause gangrene when injected, leaving users disabled for life. <br /><br />Somehow i consider it an example of what people are willing to risk to sustain opiate addiction, but i also think about how much better those people would have been off if clean, safe, morphine would have been available to them.

				Things not to try even once? Crystal meth, doing other amphetamines like Ritalin, or adderall, i highly suggest to try those. Much cleaner high, come down is alot easier to deal with, not to mention i personally feel more focused and energized on Adderall than i do on meth.<br /><br />Other than that, i wouldn&#039;t try Salvia.

				Yea i have read a few stories about drugs in Russia that are completely horrific, there was one called the 6 monther or something and it was the case that 6 months after starting it you died, charcoal black skin by the end. I think it was a prescription drug as well. A lone father lost his two sons and daughter to it (his daughter was at university at the time or recently finished).<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t read about korkodil before but that is horrific, truely.<br /><br />Anyway i reckon the drugs i would leave alone are meth, heroin and coke (it just doesn&#039;t really appeal to me). The only situation i could see me doing meth or heroin would be in the &#039;you have 3 months to live&#039; situation. But even then i don&#039;t know<br /><br />Every report i read says that delusionaires (if thats the right term) are pretty fucked up. Sounds like no one (well very very few) ever does them more than once. However i don&#039;t know if i would go as far as to say i would never try them, i do find the idea really fascinating, but the horror stories are just too overwhelming i think.

				Just to clarify with Krokodil it is NOT the desmorphine that actually makes you melt, desmorphine is just highly addictive. It&#039;s the dirty-as-fuck left over bi-products in the synthesis which is what makes you melt and in particular the red phosphorus (which they mostly get from off the striking board of matchboxes YAAAAY). Most Russian Krok addicts (to be honest, I&#039;d hazard a guess and say all of them) don&#039;t clean their shit before they inject it so they aren&#039;t just shooting desmorphine, they are shooting a delightful cocktail of desmorphine, red phosphorous and other yummy shit. <br /><br />Oh and MDPV, fuck that shit up and down. First 1-2 5-10mg lines is fine, anything after that is gunna be fuckin horrible.

				I probably wouldn&#039;t seek out krokodil at any point either... Here&#039;s a documentary from Vice <br /><br />http://www.vice.com/vice-news/siberia-krokodil-tears-part-1<br /><br />They do some really cool shit on that site with intense rogue journalism into some of the most fucked up places on Earth. The CEO of the magazine is the actual guy that gets hammered and rolls the tape. He&#039;s done two interviews on Joe Rogan&#039;s podcast that were awesome.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a laundry list of dergz I won&#039;t do anymore. Like what an earlier poster mentioned before, anything that alters the composition of my brain&#039;s natural chemical production post usage I try to avidly avoid, mainly Gov&#039;t and Big Pharma drugs.<br /><br />Also, I usually never seek out anything and kind of let the experience drift towards my path. Usually this comes to fruition at festivals or concerts or the random guest that drops in and we drop out. About once a year do I really take an initiative to just get completely fucking blasted out of no where and for no other reason than just to do it. Like now. The urge rarely comes knocking, but when it does; it kicks the fucking door down. So I would say I&#039;m in the market right now with&nbsp; BTC ready to roll on SR looking for a great deal to come up (hint hint). <br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke weed anymore, have had two friends become different people all together from habitual prescription abuse (One benzo, other opiate), lost a friend to meth and older brother is a raging alcoholic.<br /><br />I would advise against doing any kind of OTC cheap high like Dramamine. I live in the 417 Meth capital of the U.S. and have to be exposed daily to the effects, soul corruption and decay of good people do to addiction of its use and would advise against that too. <br /><br />TL;DR<br />OTC Dextro (Robo, Dramamine)<br />Inhaling Gasoline/Whip Its/Duster<br />Meth<br />Embalming Fluid<br />Shady designer drugs from non reputable distributions&nbsp; :o<br />

I would be shocked and horrified if I sent of for a quarter of hash and ended up with a severed dick. <br /><br />Back to serious notes - just had a nightmare with some speed! Ever given up a drug for years - went back to it - then ended up truly fucked?<br /><br />See the amphetamine forums for my experience. Speed was good speed - everyone loves it - but sometimes your body will send a message to you over certain drugs. For me - I had 4 hours of fantastic times! Then I felt a sweat, actually saw a drop drip on a joint! <br /><br />Please take GREAT care with speed. I took 50mg (snorted) and was off my face! Then I hit a wall - got ill fast and think my body has said to me that no fucking way is having me on that again! <br /><br />It was great speed - but almost killed me on 100mg as I dropped a 50mg bomb which took a while as I had eaten a BIG meal before using. Hit me like an express train - a real nightmare and boy am I glad to have got through it. Also I am VERY glad I am a cautious guy with drugs. Many people will have jumped in at the deep end and tried 250mg. Had I took that amount I would have gone the hospital. Even 100mg had me looking like death warmed up. <br /><br />A lot of UKers will remember the &#039;good old days&#039; of speed. Actually it was all we had for a stimulant for many years till coke became cheap enough for the average guy or girl.<br /><br />So if you remember those good old days - remember also that your putting on the years and that does strange things with reactions to substances taken. Some of the speed here is VERY strong! Its on a level with the best amphetamine we used in the day. I cannot recall 50mg of speed ever doing much - the usual dose was 500mg for many. Be warned - you may have coped with that amount back then but now ? Just be VERY careful with the speed here. Two 25 mg lines and a bomb of 50mg really fucked me up. I was ambushed! I swear I am glad to still be here - and for me personally I&#039;ve had enough speed over the years. The only drug I got addicted to! And I went back for a trip down memory lane which was actually stupid! In a way I am glad I was fucked up - had I enjoyed the entire experience I may have slipped into old habits. Possible - but I doubt it because if your over 30 - recovering from one night of good speed takes a few days before you are bright eyed and bushy tailed.<br /><br />This is why most older people and a lot of younger people use coke. Take 100mg of coke - no way your going to end up fucked up if its decent coke. Guess I can see why Mrs Red frowns on speed. She has heard the tales of my wild years using amphetamine regular. A 6 month of addiction almost sent me over the top. Best leave the past to the past sometimes. Amphetamine, heroin, coke or anything that you got addicted to in the past - best leave that shit alone!!<br /><br />Thanks for the laughs.<br /><br />I&#039;m just off to smoke my testicles. Actually I&#039;m talking balls&nbsp; ;D

				Like others have mentioned, it&#039;s extremely subjective since everyone reacts differently to drugs. I would say try anything once but don&#039;t make a habit of using any drug you feel that you like too much. If your immediate thought after using a drug is &quot;I have to get more,&quot; then don&#039;t get more for a couple months or never. For me it&#039;s heroin, especially after I started shooting it. It all really comes down to body chemistry and personal preference. For example, i&#039;m a heroin addict but i&#039;ve done crack(equally as addicting) and stayed away from it for months because I prefer heroin. So yeah there&#039;s really no definitive answer. Everything in moderation.

				Yeah I guess the way i&#039;d define &quot;moderation&quot; is a small amount every few months/couple times per year.

				PCP, Heroin ( very close to trying it but the reaction i got from a friend of mine that i never knew did it, almost cried begging me not to try it because of his horrible addiction, which, again, never knew...then 2 others reacted the same telling me horrible stories of people that couldnt kick it) bath salts, the cousins and sisters of MDMA...id just stick with molly because everything i read as a substitute is always like with a disclaimer that says.&quot;more speedy...or not as much of the magic as molly&quot; so fuck that<br /><br />i would say meth too..but i tried it...if your strong willed...its not super addictive as the come down is fucking RIDICULOUS...also ive had scripts of adderal in college..which helped me ace everything...so i guess i was like kinda prepped for it.<br /><br />im surprised limetless you wouldnt try DMT...i feel its insanely better than lsd and shrooms and also so stable and not dangerous to the body...provided you are emotionally and intellectually stable..which, you very much appear to be.<br /><br />im also against needle shooting..fuck that. drugs to me should be an easy method...needles is fucking crazy and socially weird.<br /><br />as for PCP...im weirded out that it is in the same category as Ketamine and MXE...as i have a very close cousin of mine that i grew up with that just COMPLETELY changed as a human being after doing it for like 2-3 years.<br /><br />It was very emotional for me to see a persons personality change permanently from that drug...i just dont get it. i never seen him do it or anything but he told me here and there and would call me once or twice when he was on it (hysterically crying or just being manic) and from being a big hearted, caring and smart person..he is now a shell...no confidence what so ever, just a spineless, wierdo.<br /><br />

I rarely ever do drugs more than once a week and if I do it&#039;s our friendly weed. In fact it&#039;s usually once every 2-3 weeks.<br />Just like to point out alcohol especially for the dangers of withdrawl but it&#039;s definitely a mental state that makes you an alcoholic I mean who has craved a drink on feeling alone rather than just escaping reality?&nbsp; <br />

It is not a party/fun drug, rather an enlightenment/self-reflection drug.

				It&#039;s not the drug, it&#039;s the person taking it. I know I&#039;ve an addictive, self destructive personality. So now I tend to avoid drugs that can be habit forming; Crack, coke, cannabis, alcohol ect. I already have enough problems with cigarettes and my DOC.<br />Cracks a good example, one person would try it once and forever be chasing that first high. Someone else could smoke crack several times and not see what all the fuss is about, and move on.

				I would with never trying salvia if it weren&#039;t so physically harmless. I have never seen anyone enjoy it and quite a few people are totally immune to it. I blew 60 euros on a 40x or 60x extract or something ridiculous. Used the perfect technique etc. but nothing except a weird pulling feeling. My friends went insane..... <br />It seems that unlike DMT it doesn&#039;t incapacitate the user..... I have seen people go absolutely nuts, trashing rooms and hurting themselves and others after smoking salvia. DMT smokers just seem to lie down with a silly grin on their face<br /><br />Otherwise:<br />Tobacco - biggest regret of my life. Has done more damage to me than all other illegal drugs combined.<br />Poppers - they feel like shit! How in holy hell is that recreational?!?!<br />DXM - same as poppers<br />Cocaine - wouldn&#039;t really tell people not to try it, but I have never met anyone who wasn&#039;t disappointed and pissed that their bank account is now empty&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />And finally....<br />Any legal highs that have &quot;geranium extract&quot; (methylhexamine) in them. Pretty common in the Netherlands and it is the dirtiest, most evil stimulant I have ever tried. A pill each had me lying in bed desperately trying to keep control while my girlfriend vomited endlessly, eventually vomiting blood. <br />And it was my birthday.

				Surprised at all the Salvia responses, my brother and his friend really liked it although I haven&#039;t been able to try any.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I would ever do heroin, coke, meth, or really any of the harder drugs. Just not up my alley, I really like psychedelics and high quality cannabis. But I don&#039;t know about telling other people to not do them. I guess what I would tell someone is really dependent on the person, now I would never recommend some of the less prominent drugs (at least to the average person) such as MPDV, Fentanyl (and other drugs used to cut other drugs), or deliriants.<br /><br />Now, if my buddy was a psychonaut I wouldn&#039;t feel too bad about recommending a deliriant, or other obscure chemical that may cause the average person to have an unpleasant trip. When I&#039;m recommending or recommending against I make sure to be as objective as possible, like: &quot;Yes, DMT can be quite eye opening. However, some of the trip may be hard to integrate into daily living&quot;. Although usually much larger (in length and amount of descriptions) and accompanied by reputable sources.<br /><br />Edit: I do recommend against synthetic cannabinoids, I only have 1 friend who actually enjoyed that shit and he&#039;d get all spiced up before intramural sports

				One drug that I would strongly suggest no one try without the prior use of some other mind altering substance is reality. After all as they say, &quot;Reality is for those that can&#039;t handle drugs&quot;. 8)<br />I&#039;ve tried almost everything natural and quite a few chemicals. I have never done heroin, but that&#039;s not saying I wouldn&#039;t. Dissociatives would be something I would shy away from but that is for personal reasons. Depending on your &#039;sense of adventure&#039; there is nothing I wouldn&#039;t consider trying once. After all its not what drug you do but what you do with the drug.

				Salvia is one drug I wish I never tried.&nbsp; It scared the hell out of me and made me really uneasy.&nbsp; After watching my friends do and seeing one of them fall down and knock his tooth out, and another one who sweated so heavily his whole shirt was soaked, I decided never again.&nbsp; They all are afraid of it now also, I don&#039;t see how people enjoy it.&nbsp;

				For me it was Ritalin aka Methylphenidate. I got like 30 minutes of a mediocre high that felt like bad coke, and then several hours of anxiety, paranoia, and not being euphoric but being too stimulated to sleep.<br /><br />That&#039;s just me though, so even that I wouldn&#039;t really say someone shouldn&#039;t try - but don&#039;t expect something super recreational out of it, and stick to low oral doses if using it for focus imo :)
