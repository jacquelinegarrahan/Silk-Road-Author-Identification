				I already had a thread a while ago for questions about study drugs, but I&#039;ve lost it and if I posted probably no one would see my new question.<br /><br />But basically, is there any comedown the next day after use of Adderall/Modafinil/Ritalin? Because, if I was to use either of these drugs to study then I had an exam the next day I really wouldn&#039;t want to be feeling like shit or different in any way.<br /><br />Thanks for your help. :)

				I don&#039;t know about the rest but Ritalin (10mg) doesn&#039;t give me any negative effects at all, except I tend to have very little patience for anyone impeding my study/progress. <br /><br />For me there is no comedown the following day, only a slow tail off from the heightened state of productivity. If I was taking an exam I would take another one 30 minutes before it starts.

				I&#039;ve used Adderall a lot for studying and my tactic is always to take it the day of the exam as well. Usually I&#039;ll take it the days leading up to study. Depending on how many days in a row you&#039;ve taken it you might feel a little comedown - I never have but one of my friends swears he has a comedown. I&#039;m pretty bad a studying and am definitely a last minute crammer so while the above is ideal it usually ends up being more of a constant use until after the exam when I crash... :)<br /><br />Oh, I guess one of the major pointers to improve exam performance is try to carry on eating meals even though you may not want to. Adderall always makes me lose my appetite but my Dr told me to try and force some food in anyway.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Thanks for your help guys. I&#039;m considering buying some Modafinil to try it out at first because it&#039;s a lot cheaper than Adderall or Ritalin. However I have yet another question.<br /><br />Originally I presumed that Modafinil was pretty much just like Adderall and Ritalin - but when I&#039;ve properly read many reviews about it it seems everyone&#039;s using it to decrease sleepiness. However, does Modafinil actually help people concentrate and have an increased attention span on what they&#039;re doing? That&#039;s what I really struggle with while studying so that&#039;s the desired effect I&#039;m looking for and if Modafinil doesn&#039;t do that or doesn&#039;t do that anywhere near as well as Ritalin or Adderall then I&#039;ll get Adderall/Ritalin instead.<br /><br />Thanks again. :)

				In my personal experience, Modafinil does not produce the same ability to focus that I get from Ritalin, and especially from Adderall. It&#039;s obviously better than nothing as it will keep you awake, but I would invest the extra bitcoins in Adderall if you really want increased concentration and other effects that positively affect studying.<br /><br />Obviously everyone&#039;s experiences are going to be different, but when I need to be super focused Modafinil (Provigil) just doesn&#039;t really do it for me.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				I&#039;ve not taken Modafinil but from what I&#039;ve read about it I think it&#039;d be less effective than Adderall. It&#039;s most common use is narcolepsy, where as A and R are for ADHD so I imagine they&#039;ll be better for concentration.<br /><br />My first choice is always Adderall (if only it was readily available in my country!!) :)<br /><br />Depending on your country it can be easy to get on prescription. I studied in California for a while and I went the doctor and she gave it to me no problem. Might be worth a try :)

				how would the amphetamine paste/powder sold on SR compare to Adderall/Ritalin in terms of being a useful study aid?<br /><br />It is just so much cheaper and more readily available... <br /><br />

				Thanks a lot for your help everyone. I&#039;ve decided to to buy some Ritalin and try it out and if it&#039;s not exactly what I was looking for maybe some Adderall or Modafinil too. More information about the idea of just using speed would be interesting - but other than that thanks again for your help.

				Atticus, you&#039;re a law student or soon to be law student?&nbsp; Everyone is doing it, but be careful.&nbsp; It sucks but, I know how you feel.&nbsp; Studying for 20 hours a day sucks....&nbsp; Addy is the best.&nbsp; Meth with work, but use it sparingly.&nbsp; When you&#039;re in the librarry, look at all those dickhead zombies - you can tell who is and who is not on it.
