				About an one hour ago I had a very intense experience... by most peoples standard.<br /><br />still shaking all over and pumped full of whatever weird chemicals my body produced.<br /><br />the fact that I had my second ever LSD trip at about 200 mcg made it a good deal more intense.<br /><br />i cant share any details as much police was involved.<br /><br />but it came from nothing and could have easily killed me. life is a gift and can end every moment + you might not even see it coming. appreciate life and make every day count.

				I have had a similar experience. When it is all over, immediately afterwards it is a reminder how good just being alive is. The important thing is keeping that reminder fresh in your mind every day for the rest of your life. And more importantly not letting a similar situation occur again. Life is sacred- all life. I am glad to hear you&#039;re okay and hopefully you will be okay for years to come, even after this. Remember this lesson for some people aren&#039;t so lucky to tell about their experience!

				And this certainly is not limited to recreational drugs either. I remember the story of a tourist in norther Africa that contracted malaria. He handled this correctly by taking a large dose of lariam (a pretty effective drug to treat most cases). Downside is that this drug also causes hallucinations and such at high dosages.&nbsp; <br /><br />Malaria never got around to killing this guy, he just walked across an intersection and as unforunate enough to be hit by a touringcar bus.&nbsp;

				Love the spirit of this thread but i always feels like the message also can put too much pressure on you if you can&#039;t nuance it.<br /><br />So may i add a quote from TED-speaker Marthe Troly Curthen:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.&quot;<br /><br /><br />+1 to all in this thread and TS if i haven&#039;t already ;).

				There a chapter in to Quran that touches on this subject with wisdom and clarity.&nbsp; <br /><br />1. By time,<br />2. Indeed, mankind is in loss,<br />3. Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.<br /><br />There is an other qoute from a Muslim scholar. <br />Goes something like this. A person is just a collections of days.
