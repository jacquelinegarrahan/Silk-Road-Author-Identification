				It also makes you go crazy and kill people. You can tell if someone has been taking weed because their knuckles will be white and they will foam at the mouth. As H.S. Thompson has also taught us, you can also identify a drug user by their semen encrusted pants from all their attempted rapes.

				I once injected 13 whole marijuana&#039;s straight into my veins. I am now a paraplegic. The love of my life did it with me and threw herself off a bridge. marijuana is the devils lettuce, Satan&#039;s spinach. Please I beg all of you so called street pharmacist and importers of tropical plants to see the harm you have caused me and millions of others. If you continue to sell the marijuana... well then god have mercy on your soul.

				Weed is highly addictive! I have spent all my money as a dead beat addict of this dangerous substance.<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid that rehab won&#039;t help and I&#039;ll continue sucking dick to get weed until this horrible addiction kills me.
