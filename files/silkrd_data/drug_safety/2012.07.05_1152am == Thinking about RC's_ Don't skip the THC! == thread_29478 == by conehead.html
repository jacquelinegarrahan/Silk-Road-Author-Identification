				I&#039;ve taken 2ci-nbome several times in the past month or two. Each time I had a very strong experience, but I was taking anywhere from 2 to 6mg. 1mg didn&#039;t even seem to have any effect outside of some slight color exaggeration.<br /><br />Yesterday I took 1mg of 2ci-nbome combined with a high dose of THC from some bubble hash. I took 3 large hits of the bubble hash and the experience is incredible. I certainly do not recommend people do RC&#039;s. They are probably bad for you. But if you ARE going to do them, I highly recommend waiting until you have some pot available before you dose. It&#039;s 100x better on THC. The open eye visuals are much more profound and the entire experience is more imursive. Before I felt that 2ci-nbome was purely visual apart from the light speed/cardio effects (which results in hypertension for me.) The combination is incredible. I had heard this before, but I felt it the experience warranted repeating.

				Conehead,<br /><br />Everyone experiences it in another way maybe THC is a great combo for you but on the flip side i can tell you that many people will get overwhelmed by this combo, some people can smoke weed like cigarettes but some people take a few puffs and get nausious while others smoke it to get rid of the nausious feeling. I have seen some people taking this combo and they were puking and felt like they were in a hurricane..

I usually only had threshold effects from 1mg. 2mg was needed for a good visual experience. With 1mg this time, and a large dose of THC, it was fantastic. I&#039;ve heard many people enjoy the combo and I totally get why. It makes it more imersive. The head change is a welcome relief to the soberish headstate of 2ci-nbome. I expect good effects could be had on less than 1mg. I have 1.5mg left which I&#039;m going to cut in half and try half at first, and then the other half 1 hour in if things don&#039;t crank up fast enough.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t find anything in this combo that would have been difficult to manage. Normally on 2ci-nbome, I am clear-headed with only a slight euphoria in very high doses (above 4mg). With THC and 2ci-nbome, the trip came on stronger than before (still only ++). visuals were incredible. It was certainly as good visually as any substance I&#039;ve ever taken. I&#039;ve rarely gotten to +++ on 2ci-nbome, and it was always in a large dose. I expect a 2-4mg dose with THC would get someone there. Way past face melting, cell shaded, cartoonish afterlight effects into the extreme distortion, facial feature explosion/shrinking/growing/etc.<br /><br />What a great time. I am defiiately a fan of the &quot;pine&quot; 40 micron bubble hash.

				How strange. Is this an exception or a regular thing to happen? doses &gt;2mg seem to be freakishly high. I am awaiting my 25i-nbome and I tend to be very sensitive to any psychoactive compound so I&#039;ll see where 300-600mcg gets me :P
