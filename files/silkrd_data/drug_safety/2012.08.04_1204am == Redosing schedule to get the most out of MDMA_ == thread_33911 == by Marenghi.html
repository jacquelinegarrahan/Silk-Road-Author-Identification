				How should I redose if I want to get the most (duration) out of MDMA? <br /><br />I&#039;ve usually taken 130mg initial, then another 80mg about 1hr30mins after comeup.<br /><br />Is it possible to take 2 redoses, or isn&#039;t it worth the comedown after? Anything I should change about the redosing timer for the first?

				I would not recommend taking a second re-dose. The way you&#039;re doing it now is probably fine. Last week me and some friends went to a club and rolled. We did 150mg, then an hour later took another 75mg. The roll was going awesome. But we stupidly all went out and did more a couple hours later. I don&#039;t even know how much I did because I was rolling so hard that instead of measuring it, I just stuck my finger in the pile and licked. This was a terrible idea. I was in the middle of the dance floor muttering to myself and imagining conversations that weren&#039;t happening. Eventually my teeth were just chattering a lot and I passed out in the back of a car as our sober friend drove. My other friends reported similar experiences, basically just blacked out from too much. So don&#039;t do what I did because I&#039;m dumb and you&#039;re smarter than that.

				Ok, I&#039;ll stick to one redose.<br /><br />What about timing? I see most people (based on google search) take it earlier than I do.

				(good) mdma is really cool in that dosing really works nicely. what i mean is like this: normally i got to a festival for 5 days with about 2 grams for myself. back in the day I would normally split a gram into four &quot;bombs&quot; (mdma wrapped in zigzag/rizzla rolling paper) and eat them, (250 mg each) 2 per day. that would see me through. but you get huge rolling come up and come down then come up and come down again.&nbsp; nowadays, what this veteran does is take 2grams mdma, split it up into 2x200mg hits, then 10x100mg hits, and keep 600mg for &quot;dabbing&quot; (literally wet-finger-dab-mdma-from-bag-to-tongue) and the dabs are a perfect way to redose.&nbsp; So i would eat one 200, then dab a bit as it fell, then hit another 100mg that would sort me. Repeat each day. perfecto. Kinda weird being permanently and perfectly fucked on good mdma for 4-5 days in a field camping a t a festival though, too much sex happens haha and genitals are dirty at festivals. grotty clunge, love it.

				lol. <br /><br />but i don&#039;t understand how you can keep redosing and it still works? won&#039;t you deplete the serotonin after a while? i&#039;ve generally heard that any redosing after a come down is just a waste.

				ok. but i&#039;m going to stick with 1 redose. I&#039;m still wondering when I should redose.<br /><br />I&#039;ve usually taken it 90 minutes after comeup. I see most people take it like 30 minutes after initial, isn&#039;t this ridiculously early? the point would be to extend the duration, not to increase the peak.

				Duration is something which always eluded me with MDMA as well. <br /><br />But I heard 1 - 1.5 hours after initial dosing (not come-up) should do the trick. I&#039;m going to try 1hr after dosing next time and see how that goes.<br /><br />With respect to re-dosing, anything beyond the usual single re-dose has bad idea written all over it. I&#039;ve done it in the past, but wouldn&#039;t do it today. There&#039;s no way something like that is safe.
