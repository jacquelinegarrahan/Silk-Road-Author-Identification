				Title: <strong>Adderall- No Effect?</strong><br />

				This morning, I took 10mg Adderall IR orally, and felt no effects whatsoever except a minor headache several hours later (could be unrelated). Then, 8 hours later, I snorted another 10mg with no effects again. I believe the product is legit as I recognize the taste (sweet drip). Am I just resistant to it, or am I taking pussy doses? Bear in mind that I have no previous tolerance for stims, and that I tried to maximize its effectiveness by not eating/ consuming acidic liquids. I do not have ADHD so I assumed I would notice at least a slight difference with a low dose, then up it as needed. Should I just take more next time?<br /><br />UPDATE: 30mg oral also doesn&#039;t do very much, and definitely isn&#039;t worth the cost.

				Yes, that it isn&#039;t very much. If you were to feel something from such a low dose of adderall it would probably be improved concentration when studying or something, you wouldn&#039;t feel &#039;high&#039; when just going about your day. I took 20mg my first time and I&#039;m a girl, and I didn&#039;t feel much except for maybe a very minor euphoria. <br /><br />With that said, I don&#039;t recommend upping your dose a drastic amount because it can create nervousness and anxiety. Maybe try 30mg?

				Yea, 10mg&#039;s wont do a whole lot for you even if you don&#039;t have tolerance. Also, I would suggest the XR&#039;s. Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I also tend to get a headache from taking the IR&#039;s. I&#039;ve never had that problem with the XR&#039;s. I personally don&#039;t like snorting them either. Try a 30 mg XR and I would be surprised if you didn&#039;t enjoy it. It effects people differently though. My friend who recently tried one (not sure the mg) said he felt no energy, just cotton-mouth.

				I also suggest trying 30mg, I don&#039;t really feel much when doing anything less.

				Yeah, maybe if you did twenty the first time it might have had a different outcome. About five years ago I snorted 20mg ritalin and I was flying (cleaning the house and jazz just because something would bother me for being out of place) and then I&#039;d split the rest of the prescription with my ex. We&#039;d snort all night and just sit and talk all night and morning. But of course I just realized that was ritalin. I tried adderall 10mg and I was more alert but it wasn&#039;t as effective as the ritalin but then again I wasn&#039;t abusing it.

				My first dose of Adderall (I am not diagnosed with a disorder of any type) was 40mg XR.<br />I felt very clear, crisp, and focused. I would take 30mg of IR if I was you.<br /><br />It also depends on what you are trying to achieve by dosing.

				I took 30mg IR today, and once again felt little effect but decreased appetite. I felt slightly more awake, but little improved focus. I don&#039;t know what I should do. I could try snorting 30mg next time but that&#039;s a lot of powder for me. Would it be better to try Ritalin or a different type of stimulant, because this just isn&#039;t working for me?

				Try meth. It&#039;s effects are what you are seeking. I don&#039;t see how Adderall is really recreational. I think most people buying it are college kids looking to study. Meth is like Adderall but more intense, but nothing crazy like you would think if you just start small and work yourself up to where you want to be.

				Actually, I was looking forward to the benefits on studying I was told it provides. I&#039;ve heard meth can be used similarly but the stigma on meth users isn&#039;t something I want to associate myself with.

				Yeah, it doesn&#039;t work the same for everyone. What kind of effects are you expecting? I was disappointed by adderall and dexedrine because I thought they would make me euphoric and super smart haha but honestly I think they impaired my studying skills in some ways. You should probably be able to feel at least something though at 30mg. Some people prefer ritalin over adderall, so it&#039;s probably worth trying.

				How about you give me your Adderall and go try meth or something.<br />I&#039;m sick of driving 40 minutes out of my way to get my prescription filled since every pharmacy within a 15 mile radius is out due to the production shortage.<br /><br />sdesu

				Were you taking any other meds?&nbsp; Like benzo&#039;s, they typically have a very long half life....so the Valium you took a couple of days ago could still dampen the effects.
