				Good question. Personally I would avoid it because the trouble isn&#039;t worth the fun, but in honor of answering your question; I know it&#039;s a cathinone but i also thought it was also an amphetimine. hmmm....... well shit dude...Let me know what you find out..i&#039;m gonna do some more research too. Maybe someone else will chime in with some knowledge!<br /><br />Ryno

				Really good question, wish I knew the answer.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a cathinone not an amphetamine.&nbsp; Close though.&nbsp; I think the amphetamine analogue (homologue?) of it would just be MDA.&nbsp; So it might false positive the MDxx class of drugs.<br /><br />Anyone with actual experience?&nbsp; This would be big news if people can use this and still pass drug tests.

				I&#039;ve heard reports of false-positives (is it really a false-positive at this point tho) for methamphetamine, just like MDMA. <br /><br />The good thing is that since there are quite a few legal drugs that cause false positives for meth, you can probably argue that you were just taking sudafed for sinus congestion or something, and if they use a more specific test for methamphetamine, I think it will show up negative.

				amoxicillin (antibiotic given for chest infections) gives false positives for cocaine and maybe amphetimines and maybe codein - read this http://www.medschat.com/topics/amoxicillin-false-positive-drug-test/<br /><br />Also do a seearch for it and fals positives - hope it helps you.

				It&#039;s not our job to call anyone out on anything, and I don&#039;t mean this negatively toward you because I do not know you or what&#039;s going on in your life, but I wonder why someone would take a drug even though they&#039;re so worried about freedom. If it&#039;s addiction you struggle with you can message me to talk. I hope you don&#039;t get caught up in trouble for taking the meph my friend. Hopefully we&#039;ll hear back from you!<br /><br />Ryno
