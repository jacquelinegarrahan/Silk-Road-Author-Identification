				I&#039;ve read many experiences about how MDMA combines well with opiates and makes it much more fun like a speedball. I can&#039;t find anything about opiates and methylone though. Does anyone think Methylone + Hydrocodone or Oxycodone would be more euphoric? Anyone tried this? One Erowid report said opiates combined with cathinones was great, but they were talking about Mephedrone. Thanks.

More so than MDMA+opiate, because methylone is a more chill relaxed roll anyway and you can almost get this wide awake nod going. Keep in mind im dependent so i had to take them with it but i think it definitely added that warm blanket opiate euphoria. I would take them right at the peak so they kick in when you start coming down.

I think it was about 60mg of oral morphine and 20mg of oral hydrocodone, keep in mind that was a low dose for me. I think if your trying to do a combo to get a high with parts of both do oxy first while your still buzzing on the methylone than hydro later on just because its a little more sedating that oxy. Make sure you keep your doing in a safe range because you will be able to take more of both without feeling side effects so its easier to overdose. Personally if i were to do it i would dose 170-200mg methylone with about 15-20mg of oxy together, than 20mg of hydro right after the peak but if you dont have an opiate tolerance cut the dose down by 25-50%. Hope you have a great roll!
