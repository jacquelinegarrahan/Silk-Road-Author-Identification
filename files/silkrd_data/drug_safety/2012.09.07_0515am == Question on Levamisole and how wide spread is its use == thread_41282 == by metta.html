				Many of the articles I&#039;ve read about this adulterant are 2-3 years old, but they suggest that 70-80% of the coke in the US is cut with it. I&#039;ve also read that washed coke still has Levamisole in it.<br /><br />Are current imports to the US still using Levamisole as a cutting agent? And to the same degree as a couple of years ago? Does anyone have experience with being affected by this adulterant?<br /><br />Thanks for any comments ...

				Its a shame whats happened to cocaine in the past decade or so. I was just thinking how i feel bad for the coke users of today because the shit is so cut with who knows what. And the re-rock, or recon as its called here, is just plain garbage compared to what it used to be. <br /><br />I remember the good old days when coke was fucking great. No speedy effects, nice taste, and awesome high. Im glad i had a chance to experience it (and binge many many a times...), but i honestly dont even bother with blow anymore because its total garbage and the risks of sniffing levamisole just doesnt appeal to me. We call it joke coke around my way, because simply its a joke compared to the real thing. <br />

				I&#039;d like to know more about this also. As I mentioned in another thread, you always hear people saying &quot;Ahh coke just isn&#039;t like it used to be&quot;, and yet if you look at the market, the Levamisole-cut coke is very popular. I would say it appears to be the preferred product and the media hype about side effects is exaggerated (like the dangers of MDMA for example).

				I just dont understand why these things happen. Are there really people who want to do that much harm to somebody? I mean, anthrax-laced heroin? Example: A random guy knows about a demand for heroin. He doesnt like junkies, but he sees the money. He will find a supplier, cut it with caffeine or sugar, sell it for double price and make a fuckload of money. No, he laces the heroin with anthrax to kill people. Who in their righteous mind would do that? And why?

				it&#039;s not so much based in harm<br />the farmers that are growing the coca are given levamisole subsidized from the government<br />so it&#039;s cheap (free?) cutting agent that is readily available
