				I have a very close friend who has some extreme, severe debilitating anxiety regarding physical intimacy (sweating, shaking, panic)<br /><br />Anyway, I want to try this thing called sensate focusing, and general touch therapy to help him out....and he&#039;s open to using some chemical help to start things off. Personally, I LOVE MDMA, and of course MDMA is great for the empathy and love, as it has been used as such for ages by therapists.....<br />But not so good for actually getting down and shagging.<br />I don&#039;t want to make his anxiety even worse since his General most likely won&#039;t be able to salute the occasion while on MDMA<br /><br />My question is, which substances or combinations are best for this sort of shag-therapy? The lovey-dovey AND the sexy times?<br />We&#039;re both willing to try the tryptamines, and other RC&#039;s which we have never done<br />(In terms of entheogens / RC&#039;s only-- not interested in getting gaked out on meth or coke with him, and GHB just makes him sleepy)<br /><br />If anyone has any experience with any of these, any insight would be greatly appreciated!<br />

				Well ya, MDMA sounds like what you are looking for. I have found that at high dosages, or in the latter half of the roll my dick is shrunken quite a bit and may not join in the party. However, if I take a normal dose.. 100-150mg MDMA there is no problem getting it up in the first half of the experience. In fact, it may be the one to start the party.<br /><br />Too bad you don&#039;t want to use cocaine or methamphetamine though. Both will allow him to open up, but will not be like a full on psychedelic experience i.e. you will still be on earth when you make the emotional breakthrough.<br /><br />For both methamphetamine and&nbsp; 3 4-methylenedioxyMethamphetamine aka MDMA, I strongly urge you to take 5mg of diazepam aka Valium 30min&#039;s after the amphetamine. Then 10mg when you are coming down. This will prevent dopamine Neurotoxicity caused by the amphetamine. It will also prevent potential anxiety both during and after amphetamine use.<br /><br />see my post: hxxp://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13244.0

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend 6-APB for sexytime personally, tried 100mg of it last night and it kindve gave me adderall dick. 2c-b for sure, just gotta stay around 10mg for the dose.

				I&#039;m not particularly sure that drugs and sex is going to be a good solution to that anxiety disorder. Has he been to any professional psychotherapy? They might be able to get him to confront his anxieties in a more effective manner...

				I think it would do him good to sample them all eventually. Start with MDMA to help build healthy associations with sex especially if he talks about his anxieties and desires while rolling. Then move through the others for the actual sex part. <br /><br />Doing it this way would give him time to integrate his experiences and internalize them before moving forward since I assume he&#039;s not expecting to have all his problems solved in one night.

				Don&#039;t give him psychedelics - it will only make his anxiety that much worse. Try some benzos for anxiety.<br /><br />But in all truth take him to a psychotherapist, this is something that can best be dealt with professional therapy.

				Maybe even consider an opiate? I used to feel pretty clear minded and confident on 50-70mg of hydrocodone. And it&#039;ll prob make him last longer; that always add to a nigga&#039; swag.
