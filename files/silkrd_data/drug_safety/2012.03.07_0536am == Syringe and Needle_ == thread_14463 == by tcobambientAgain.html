				I have a Dilaudid coming and am going to inject it but the problem is I have no idea how to acquire the Syringe and Needle?&nbsp; I live in the US and I&#039;m assuming you can&#039;t just go into a drug store and buy them off the shelf?&nbsp; Anyone have some experience with this?

				They made it legal in my state, and several others, about a decade ago to just go to a CVS or a Walgreens and just buy one, before that I had to pay $10 a piece or go to the next state over.&nbsp; They did it to curb the spread of HIV and Hep-C.&nbsp; You can order them on SR under drug paraphernalia.

				I just looked it up.&nbsp; Just about every state allows the sale of needles without a script.&nbsp; Just make sure you have your ID.&nbsp; Should cost about $5 for a 10 pack.<br />

				OK.&nbsp; Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I&#039;m just a little scared to go into a CVS or Walgreens and buying (sort of like the first time buying condoms as a teenager) but I&#039;ll have to force myself to man up.&nbsp;

				OK.&nbsp; I walked into Walmart yesterday for another reason and while in the store I was like &quot;Fuck it&quot;, went over to the pharmacy and said my aunt was in town and needed like 10 syringes with needles for her Insulin.&nbsp; Made a few jokes about feeling weird about buying needles and was in and out in about 5 minutes with no one the wiser.&nbsp; Now the problem was I tried to inject a Dilaudid today and went for a vein in my hand (couldn&#039;t find a good vein in my arm and looked down and saw all these veins in my hand) and it didn&#039;t work out all that great.&nbsp; I think sticking myself was scary and that&#039;s why it didn&#039;t go that well.&nbsp; Decided to take the needle off and just take the Dilaudid anally.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t get the rush that I had previously with mainlining Diluadid but it worked and got a nice effect that seems to last longer than injecting.&nbsp;

				If you go in through your hand then it&#039;s crucial that you go in almost horizontally. Same with your arm...start by goin in a little over half way, pull back on the plunger a bit to make a small vacuum, pull out the needle slowly until you draw a little blood then shoot. :D

				Just be sure to use a new syringe every time you inject. Please.
