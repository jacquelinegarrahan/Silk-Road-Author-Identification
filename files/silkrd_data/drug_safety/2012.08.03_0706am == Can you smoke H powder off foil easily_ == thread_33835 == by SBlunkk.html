				I know smoking tar from foil is easy. I DO NOT want to progress to the needle, I just won&#039;t do it. I see lots of vendors selling H powder. Does this trail ok on foil and can be smoked ok on foil? Anyone do it?

People are going to do what they want to do no matter what other people say. You can either participate good information with a response or just zip it. I mean look where we are....and your telling someone to just smoke weed when they&#039;re asking about smoking Heroin. Derr.

				Sorry if we have differing opinions sblkjunk,<br />but I rmember being that naive, and wished someone had said that to me, <br />instead of showing me the way. I still would of ended up doing it, but maybe <br />a bit later down the road, you know. Just my view mate, theres plenty of&nbsp; forums<br />&nbsp;to learn about the ways to take drugs, the dangers of it, the how &amp; what not to do etc.<br />I think 99% of us here know the answer to that question&nbsp; because we have searched, read<br />forums,used the search function on said forums,&nbsp; learnt and survived.<br />Just MY advice man, theres countless others out there.<br />

				i wont shoot either, but am a daily user. if you have not developed a habit, please set strict limits to your use and never surpass the restrictions you initially impose. i rationalized just a bit more frequent, which progressed to where now without it i feel like shit and basically must use to function. still using small dosages, starting doses for some, but i dont want you to end up in the same situation so please be careful. (actually i started with oxycodone which is just as dangerous, just use H cause its so much more affordable than blues)<br /><br />that said, there are two forms of powdered H:<br />#3 is the freebase form, which is cut with caffeine at the source - both of which facilitate vaporization. common in Europe, not available in america usually. also generally less expensive but also less pure generally. needs citric to dissolve in water for IV<br /><br />#4 is a salt, which is water soluble but has a much higher vaporization point which is too close to the combustion temp, meaning most all the H will degrade rather than vaporizing - so it cant really be smoked. common form in America and generally the purest quality<br /><br />if you dont want to shoot but have #4, you could insufflate which is my preferred ROA, or you could plug... which has a higher BA and stronger effects more similar to smoking so you waste less, but some like me just are not too fond of the idea<br /><br />
