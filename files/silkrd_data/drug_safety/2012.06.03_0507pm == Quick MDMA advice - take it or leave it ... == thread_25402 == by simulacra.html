				1. The more white in E usually signifies higher quality.<br /><br />2. After a few potentially dangerous overheating experiences, I now try half or less to begin with - especially if it&#039;s a new drug or new vendor.<br /><br />3. If you&#039;re used to pills/powder, be cautious with pure crystal MDMA&nbsp; - it&#039;s a whole lot more potent! I dropped 150mg and was totally fried and all I could do was try to keep from passing out for a few hours. Also don&#039;t drop on an empty stomach - at least have snacks before.<br /><br />4. Always have lots of&nbsp; cold water and electrolytes, eg. gatorade, powerade - fruit juice is great too, esp orange or orange-mango (less acidic) prepared beforehand - especially if you&#039;re moving your body (that includes long sex sessions too). Drink frequently. For nourishment you can add lemon juice and honey or maple syrup to water and keep it accessible, eg. cyclist&#039;s type water bottle.<br /><br />Anyone is welcome to add more or whatever.

				Snort it, it comes on quicker and intensifies.

				1.) Be somewhat vigilant of what you say and do on MDMA. Ya never know when you might reveal too much or do something that in 5 hours you&#039;ll be like, &quot; Oh God no....&quot;<br />2.) Blueberries and green tea. Great to have in your general diet, but I find they are perfect pre-rolling, rolling, and post-rolling food. Have faith in the blueberries folks.<br />3.) Have very soft blankets nearby if possible. This advice doesn&#039;t really work well for a rave setting, but if you&#039;re rolling at your own abode or another person&#039;s home, find one and stretch out on it. Good times, good times.<br />4.) Vitamins, a good diet, and a decent amount of exercise. MDMA with continued and frequent useage can start to mess with your brain&#039;s chemistry, keeping a healthy body is just a great thing to do in general, especially for those of us who have decided to ingest illicit chemicals. For the one time out of three times I&#039;ve rolled I got the depression aspect of the MDMA hangover I found that going for a lengthy and intensive run helped out a great deal.<br />

				@thestealthyracoon - the last crystal mdma i got was slightly off-white, just a tinge yellow. I&#039;m no expert but a bud who does mdma and used to smoke meth told me, the whiter the color, generally the stronger the product - taking into consideration you have a vendor who has a good rep and doesn&#039;t sell cut product. Yellowish white is probably like 97% pure ... anyone correct me if this estimate is wrong ... ?
