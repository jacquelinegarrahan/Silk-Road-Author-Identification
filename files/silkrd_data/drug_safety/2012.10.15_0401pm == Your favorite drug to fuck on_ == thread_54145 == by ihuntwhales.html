				&nbsp;I&#039;m going to go out there and sound tacky when I say MDMA.&nbsp; I had done all kinds of shit, nothing prepared me for sex on MDMA, not even doing MDMA without sex, at high dosage(visuals dosage, 150mg first time ).&nbsp; &nbsp;I would really like to try LSD and sex, but haven&#039;t yet, but my second choice would be Heroin.&nbsp; I know it sounds horrible, the first few times I did heroin, I couldn&#039;t even have sex.&nbsp; A few years back, I would drive a long way to get it, very far.&nbsp; On the way back, after sniffing a few bags in the car, me and my partner in crime would have sex in the car, often I would get her off just using my hands.&nbsp; Eventually we would do oral, getting honks from Truck Drivers, who were watching my hot gf sucking my cock on the interstate.&nbsp; After that we would pull off into a cornfield or boat launch or whatever and fuck like animals.&nbsp; If we weren&#039;t up to that, I would just get road head for the last hour or so home, then go have sex there.&nbsp; Those were the days.&nbsp; Poppers(butyl or amyl nitrite) are good if you get too high to fuck, although you should NEVER mix them with Viagra.&nbsp; Viagra is something I&#039;ve come into later in life(save the jokes for the old guys) and I have to say that although the low-blood-pressure headache sucks, it does improve performance and blood flow, resulting in better sex for both partners.&nbsp; I have not tried Yohimbe yet, although as an herbal-experimenter I would be interested in trying yohimbe, maybe in conjunction with other drugs.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions?

				I&#039;m going to agree with the bit about sex under the influence of MDMA. Hard to compare to that in terms of euphoria and lust, but the weird abstract passion that shrooms provided was on a whole different level for me.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to also sound tacky and say that there isn&#039;t anything I&#039;ve attempted to have sex on that I haven&#039;t enjoyed. After a rave, the lady and I will take Xanax after some psychedelics in order to get a good night&#039;s sleep. Once the Xanax kicks in, we hop in the shower and do the deed. I&#039;ve always enjoyed that, as well as sex on Opiates. Both of these increase the pure pleasure from the sex, but if you want to get into some otherworldly sexual experiences, I would suggest MDMA or a psychedelics.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t had the opportunity to smash my woman on MDA as of yet, that&#039;s next on the list.

				I prefer weed.<br /><br />Stay the fuck away from mephedrone if you are planning to have sex. I couldn&#039;t finish for like two hours and I kept repeating in my head that if I don&#039;t cum she will think I&#039;m a pussy and I can&#039;t fuck properly. What a retard&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;ve done it with 2c-i. That was sucky. Hard to keep it up for very long, and while I got off, I was distracted by my own trippy thoughts.<br />Though it was fun to watch fractals form across my fiance&#039;s chest.<br /><br />My uncle has told me that sex with GHB is a bad idea, he claims it makes him horny as fuck but he CANNOT reach climax.

				MDMA used to be THE MOST PHENOMENAL.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after years of (ab)use it now gives me such a bad case of limpdick that any attempt to fuck results in a speedy compulsive attempt to get a hardon for hours. Rather unpleasant. Shame really.

				Weed. I am a guy, and any other drug has the potential to cause issues.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had good sex on plenty other drugs, but would not really recommend them, weed is it. Just one of its many wonderful properties, its the most pure aphrodisiac without any limp dick or can&#039;t cum bullshit.

				Honestly, cannabis.&nbsp; I can please my woman on MDMA all night long though, and she loves M, but I can&#039;t really get it up or keep it up for long periods of time so it&#039;s kind of a one way thing with it.&nbsp; We both have kind of reached a consensus that weed is great for sex.

				Champagne, ofcourse. A magnum bottle contains the exact proper dose for two people to share before, though some (french?!) suggest sharing the standard bottle is actually better for performance between the sheets.

				Hah, splitting a bottle of wine is a pretty good call. The thing with alcohol for me is, its a very fine line between awesome sex, and being too drunk and having sloppy sex or limp dick.&nbsp; But an alcohol buzz is pretty great for sex. Being quite drunk is not in my experience, but a half bottle of wine sounds a bout right.

				LSD. But you have to find the right moment - the moment when you &#039;wake up&#039; every few seconds. And than there&#039;s nothing in your head but sex, sex is you universe, you are breathing only to have sex.<br />And oh my god it&#039;s awesome.<br /><br />And well MDMA and next day after good MDMA roll sex is just fantastic.

				By far the best drug to fuck on is MDPV, maybe with a little help from some viagra. MDMA would be nice but IMO you get far to distracted by enjoying absolutely everything!

				Another vote for cocaine. <br />Only a little just adds that confidence to the sex, becomes more intense. Much hotter, plus you can keep it up hard for ages on cocaine.

				I would have to say LSD and MJ. While tripping, as yellowmatter said, the act of sex becomes the center of the universe and you and your partner become gods who, I believe, connect on a psychic level. Though both you and your partner have to be in the right place mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.<br />&nbsp;<br />MJ is splendid because for me I have all of my physical sensations intensified and I feel &quot;free&quot; from a lot of my usual anxious thoughts. <br /><br />Btw I&#039;m a guy.
