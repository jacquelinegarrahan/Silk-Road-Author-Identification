				I&#039;m a long time lurker on SR (just made a new account for purchasing), so I know you guys are the best resource for this kind of information. I have a pinched nerve in my lower back and am going to be purchasing some cann in the next week or so via SR. <br />Can anyone give me advice about which strains I should look into for pain management?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve never used hash before, but I am curious about it. Is it easier to ship? What is the difference in hash vs bud smoking?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I used to smoke &quot;a lot&quot; a couple years ago, but it was mainly &quot;for fun&quot; (I still wonder where the fun was after all doing it everyday but wups drifting off subject)... I&#039;m sure there are here many more &quot;medical&quot; user, but i&#039;ll say... what I can say nevertheless!<br /><br />As nomad said, &quot;indica&quot; strains should be better than &quot;sativa&#039;s&quot;, because for pain relief you&#039;re looking for stronger physical effects. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a bit more complicated than that, but you could sum up &quot;indica&quot; plants as giving a &quot;stoned&quot; feeling (if you never smoked, you could imagine it that it makes you feel good and confy where you are), and &quot;sativa&quot; plants as giving a &quot;high&quot; feeling, more mental (like you wanna do silly things and it&#039;s just so funny).<br />&quot;Indica&quot; plants +- you find more in Asia, &quot;sativa&quot; ones in Africa and slave-islands.<br /><br />Hashish usually comes from Asia, and is basically (I&#039;m sure it&#039;s more complicated than that though) made up of the most potent plant parts. Average hash is roughly/usually 3/4/5 times stronger than average &quot;weed&quot;... in relation to weight of course! This means you need to ingest/smoke much less of the drug to get the effects. This also means it is a much less bulky form to transport/acquire/ship. <br />Average hash also smells much less than average weed , but I find it usually has a stronger taste...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you plan to consume (smoke/vaporize/eat), but if you want to smoke hash, you first have to &quot;mix&quot; it with tobacco...<br /><br />Many people I know prefer weed over hash, but for me it was hash all the way! <br /><br /><br />Take care with your pain, i&#039;m sure a... joint every so and then will help until evil joint disc replaces itself :)
