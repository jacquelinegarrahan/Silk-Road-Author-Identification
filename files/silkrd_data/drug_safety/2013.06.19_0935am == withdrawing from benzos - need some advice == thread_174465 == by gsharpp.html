				hey guys I would like to get off benzos, more specifically kpins<br /><br />I was forced to go cold turkey the last 3 days and it was pure hell. I do have a good amount of kpins to my disposal at the moment though and would like to taper off, so I can decrease the side effects as much as possible.<br /><br />so I need advice.<br /><br />I am a frequent user but my doses can vary from 0.25 to 2 mg a day. I also used xanax over a period of time, but havent used it for about a week.<br /><br />how would I go about creating a good &quot;tapering off plan&quot; ? are there any guides online I can read?<br /><br />thanks

				yes there are lots of guides you can get sorry i hope im not wasting your time cos i cant provide any, and i never used kpins much but igve done alot of valium and xanax detoxes..<br /><br /><br />my advice is:<br /><br />1.)&nbsp; start at a level you think you can manage at - not so you can party, but so you dont freak.. whats your &quot;get by dose&quot; ?<br />2.)just withdrawl off that slowly, one or two weeks if need be per dosage reduction.<br />3.) remmeber - no more &quot;parties&quot; on them. no more excuses just to pop them off when you are feeling good either<br />4.)if you go to the doctor make sure you have enough to get you by in case the doctor is a fuckhead and cuts you off cold<br />5.) take it slow, no parties or chillin out times -<br /><br />im in the same boat as you right now with xanax but these feel like just weak ass shit..<br /><br /><br />

Any truth to that?<br /><br />good luck with your xanax situation!<br /><br />i found this link, http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzsched.htm#s5&nbsp; - it might be helpful to you down the road.

				Never heard of kpins!<br />Is there a specific reason you were taking these? How often do you take them?<br /><br />I would suggest cold turkey to be honest, but if that&#039;s really too hard bruzzcuzz&#039;s advice seems very sound to me. Definitely stop partying with it!<br /><br />All I would add is taking some supplements as you scale down your dose.<br />-Magnesium works well, it might be hard to notice but it does help. Some extra magnesium in your diet can help recover from physical and mental stress.&nbsp; <br />-Try some herbal supplements if you find it hard to sleep - sort of those &quot;herbal anti-depressants&quot;, won&#039;t ever get you out of a bad spell but they can help you sleep.&nbsp; <br />-If you feel a little down look into serotonin boosters like 5-HTP.&nbsp; There are controversial opinions on 5-HTP but it&#039;s always helped me get through a bad mdma come-down in the past.&nbsp; Otherwise there&#039;s alternatives to 5-HTP, find one that works for you.<br />-Last but not least, go chill outside and enjoy the outdoors as much as you can, it&#039;s summer after all!&nbsp; Do some sports as well.&nbsp; Any endurance sport is good.&nbsp; Top it off with a martial art.&nbsp; I used to be rather depressed and lacking in self-confidence until I got into martial arts and started playing more team sports.&nbsp; Those sorts of sports always give you the impression you&#039;re going somewhere, unlike jogging and such since you just can&#039;t be asked sometimes. :p<br /><br />Good luck!

				I know herbal stuff seems useless sometimes but i&#039;ve found Millepertuis works for me, of course an Atarax sleeping pill works MUCH better but damn you feel like shit the next day.<br />I think any supplements seem useless when you&#039;ve got a benzo habit, but as your head clears up both physically and mentally they start having more effect.&nbsp; Of course, the effects are mild, that&#039;s why cold turkey was my solution when I was popping too many.<br />When I hit a festival I know i&#039;m going to overload on chemicals of all sorts so I always have with me :<br />-Omega3<br />-Millepertuis<br />-Magnesium<br />-5htp (it works for me but I think there&#039;s alternatives)<br />-Serotonin homeopathic granules - I don&#039;t know if you can get those where you live but once again, it works for me and I find it top notch<br />-Ginseng<br /><br />and a few more...<br /><br />Well if you can get back in your sports routine that&#039;s great.&nbsp; I would just recommend taking more time stretching.&nbsp; I usually force myself to stretch for 20 minutes to an hour.&nbsp; The whole body.&nbsp; Not only does it improve performance but it helps blood flow, vitality, avoids injury and helps you age well ;)<br />There&#039;s some body-building method books out there to work out without using almost any equipment.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed most of them include excellent stretching programs and tips.<br /><br />EDIT: Did a bit of research! <br />Millepertuis has been recognized as a much more effective alternative to anti-depressant drugs in several studies.&nbsp; <br />HOWEVER it can have adverse effects when combined with the drugs it is meant to replace.&nbsp; Some even mention it can limit the effectiveness of other drugs such as contraceptive pills (if you&#039;re a woman of course).&nbsp; Anyway you really should ask a good doctor for advice if you need to take prescription drugs - if he says I don&#039;t know and doesn&#039;t want to know fuck him he&#039;s a dick go find another doctor.&nbsp; I&#039;ve stopped paying doctors who don&#039;t actually try, where I live I have the right to (doesn&#039;t always work tho :s).&nbsp; The researchers who did the study recommend low doses of Millepertuis.
