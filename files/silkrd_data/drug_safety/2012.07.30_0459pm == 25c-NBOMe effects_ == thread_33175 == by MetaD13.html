				I&#039;ve looked on other websites and read other reports, but many of them are vague or just don&#039;t make sense. I&#039;m wondering what type of experiences you guys on here have had with this drug. Also, how similar would you say it is to LSD?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of this drug before getting on SR, and I&#039;ve asked friends about it and none of them know anything about it either.

				Search for 25c-NBOMe or HardHustle on this forum and you&#039;ll see a couple of threads about this substance... as well as trip reports specifically about the 25c-NBOMe sold on SR. Erowid should help you as well.<br /><br />For me, it was a strange mixture of LSD/Mushrooms(not as chaotic)/DMT. One of the members here had an extremely enlightening trip but he took a high dose.<br /><br />I think 25i-NBOMe is more like LSD than 25c-NBOMe, so you might want to wait for HardHustle to start selling 25i again (supposedly today, but there could be delays, who knows my friend).<br /><br />All in all, LSD is a very unique substance that can&#039;t be replaced, but that&#039;s not to say the NBOMes aren&#039;t fucking awesome. They just seem to be more clearheaded (still a mindfuck).

A friend of mine saw insects everywhere and another friend told that he felt like we were walking on a huge snake.

That&#039;s a common misconception about LSD in my opinion, many people proclaim it to be some life changing spiritual drug, which can turn a lot of people away. Not saying that it isn&#039;t, because large acid doses can indeed cause life altering experiences. Although, I&#039;ve taken LSD many times just to have some fun, and its given me some damn good times!

				For euphoria, it&#039;s 25c and 25d. They both start off very visual in the beginning (and pretty similar at that). They also both kind of die down (or maybe just not as noticeable) when the euphoria kicks in. 25c has a steady stream of euphoria that builds for a few hours and then slowly dies down for the next few hours. 25d comes in rolls, very intense and can plateau for a about 30-ish seconds before settling back down to a calm buzz of bliss. To each their own, I have a nice supply of each that I alternate around over the months, hehe. If you&#039;re planning to have sex, definitely 25d!<br /><br />25b is the most visual except it doesn&#039;t come with any euphoria. The visuals are very unique, kind of reminds me of the swirly goodness you get with 2c-b though more lively and it has more flow: everything is filled with vibrant technicolor life. Hearing, taste, and overall mood is also heightened ... It&#039;s the kind of thing that makes movies jump out of the screen and into your head. <br /><br />25b is a unique sensory experience. 25c is more responsive to music. 25d is very responsive to touch. 25i makes you happy and giggly. I haven&#039;t tried 25g yet .. must try that one next!

I had a fun time making music for a while.<br /><br />Gonna try 25b as soon as HH puts it up.

				Take only one, man. It&#039;s a rather unknown substance and you&#039;d better play it safe.<br /><br />There are plenty of favorable trip reports for both 25i and 25c on erowid, but I remember reading some complete train wrecks.

				25i would be the best to combine with all other tabs because of the mood boost, I&#039;d basically expect a funner version of the others. 25c can be a little disorienting at times (it&#039;s far more trippy) so I imagine the 25i would keep you more level on that end. <br /><br />Make sure to take them separately first as some have issues with vasoconstriction. And as it would be more unpredictable when combining, take smaller doses of each when doing so.

				I noticed that after I used my second dose of 25i (900micrograms, insufflated) , I became extremely sleep for the next few days.<br />I took it last Friday and I&#039;m still sleepy today. Fortunately I&#039;m on my vacations so I can just lay down and relax. Two friends who also took it reported to be more relaxed the following days.<br /><br />Have any of you noticed the same thing?

				hello!&nbsp; could use some advice. . . Anyone take higher doses.? <br /><br />I would consider myself a fairly experienced tripper.&nbsp; LSD at least 50 times and dozens with mushroom sessions. Other less common psychedelics also,&nbsp; but never any RC&#039;s. I just ordered 3 600ug tabs of 25c-nbome that i plan on sharing with my brother. Does anyone think 900ug per person would be overkill?<br /><br />I love to trip hard and have never had a &quot;bad trip&quot;,&nbsp; but I don&#039;t want things to get out of control and have no idea what to expect.&nbsp; From what i gather,&nbsp; it is a more manageable psychedelic mentally and is more based on visuals. I have also read it described as a &#039;cleaner&#039; psychedelic,&nbsp; with less stress physically put on your body.&nbsp; This is what making me curious about taking 1 1/2 tabs<br /><br />&nbsp;I also bought some 5meo-dalt i plan on taking around when&nbsp; i peak.&nbsp; Does anyone think any of this is a bad idea? I would love to hear any of the negative aspects or side effects of 25c-nbome.

				I would personally say yes, but if you want to play it safe then just take half. 25c isn&#039;t disorienting or a total mindfuck. Just don&#039;t smoke too much weed or it will get very intense.

				I&#039;ve never done it on its own, though I&#039;ve given it to people who used it on its own. I had one of RedHempfield&#039;s 600 microgram tabs with 25 mg of 4-aco-DMT. It was one of the most pleasantly visual trips I&#039;ve ever had. Things were normal while walking, but when I slowed down everything started to swirl and distort. I felt an overwhelming contentment to the point where I sat on a rock and just enjoyed my surroundings in silence for about an hour. Combines very well with amyls.

				I ended up going with graffenburg, mostly due to the price point but also because hh seemed to be a bit behind on his orders.&nbsp; What can I say, I&#039;m an impatient bastard.<br /><br />As to my wife, she puts a lot of faith in her psychiatrist (and her meds).&nbsp; We&#039;ve had some (heated) discussions about SSRIs.&nbsp; Research I&#039;ve done suggests they&#039;re mostly a placebo effect, which isn&#039;t to say they&#039;re ineffective.&nbsp; Placebo is damn good at dealing with depression.&nbsp; I&#039;m also not much of a fan of big pharma.&nbsp; Which is to say, I don&#039;t see her ever getting off SSRIs.<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up on seizure risk.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to do some more internet research on the subject.<br /><br />This will be my first time taking 25c though, so I&#039;m still looking forward to your thoughts on quality as I have nothing to compare too&nbsp; ;)

				Actually graffenburg sent the wrong order to someone and ended up getting 25 extra tabs, and someone else got half their order. All was resolved though. Either way, graffenburg seems like the go-to guy right now but I personally haven&#039;t ordered from him.

CRAZY fast shipping. i would recommend wholeheartedly. be careful with the tabs, though... i am an experienced acidhead, but one of these 25c tabs from graffenburg really knocked me on my ass in terms of intensity of visual hallucinations. fucking insane. it was like jumping headfirst into the peak of a decent-sized acid trip and not being able to come back up for air for a good couple of hours. but like others have mentioned, it was a clearheaded trip. while the visuals were themselves insane, i was able to think clearly, while if i were tripping on a large dose of L, i might have had some trouble talking at some points lol.<br /><br />happy tripping! 8)
