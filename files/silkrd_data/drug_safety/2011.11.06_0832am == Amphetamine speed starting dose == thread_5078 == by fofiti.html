				I have used methylphenidate (amphetamine derivative, ritalin) rectally in the past (60mg) a few times with a nice high but not amphetamine but am a very responsible user.<br /><br />We are talking about good quality dutch speed powder.<br /><br />What dosage would the forum users reccommend for someone starting off to enjoy it without ending up with a heart attack? An oral dose or rectal dose would be useful. Typically rectally we use 1/4 of the oral dose as it has more bioavailability rectally.<br /><br />Appreciate any advice!

				I only snorted it. I usually make short lines (about 2-3cm) and I snort one every 5 minutes until I&#039;m high. Then another line everytime i feel like i&#039;m coming down. Last time with dutch I was pretty high from 3 lines.<br />About oral dosage, i don&#039;t know but dutch is about 20% pure so i&#039;d take 0.1g.

				HA HA unless you have a heart condition or something, the chances of having a heart attack on amphetamine are very slim. Cocaine on the other hand has a higher rate of heart complications due to the added vasoconstriction which gives a much higher blood pressure reading. To test out the quality of the speed first, I would chow between 70 and 100mg to start out with. You can always take more&nbsp; if it&#039;s not that strong...Street amphetamine isn&#039;t very pure the majority of the time.

				I&#039;m not sure if it was just the quality of the product where i used to live but we used to get 7grams of paste each (it was very cheap. Only Â£25) When we started out generally the doses would be around 3G done ever the course of the night. Start off having a parachute or two and then a line or two and keep re-dosing whenever you need that. The worst time for me was around the 10gram mark. This was as well as having a bottle and a half bottles of red wine and a joint or two and then heading off to a gig and drinking more so that may be why. I was an absolute mess that night haha

				I wouldn&#039;t say I was an animal I just used to love speed but it definitely wasn&#039;t as strong as the stuff I have had before or since then. This was over like a 12 hour period. It was the most fucked I have ever been from whiz. One of my friends who plays in the band i was watching forced me to go sit in the band area upstairs because of all the looks i was getting off bouncers. I didn&#039;t sleep for like 2 days afterwards. Definitely the most intense experience I&#039;ve ever had of speed. In my opinion on it&#039;s own it&#039;s not that good but it&#039;s the perfect drug for mixing. Usually if I&#039;m just drinking or smoking I&#039;m naked and passed out in a bathtub by midnight but with speed i seem to be able to go until it&#039;s light. I don&#039;t take it anymore. I decided against it because it caused my attendance in college to drop to like 30% as i was taking it pretty much every day for 4-5 months. I&#039;m still going to take it in the future just not to the extent i used to do it.
