				What would cause for a very long onset with 2C-B? Last night I took a mild dose of 15mg on an empty stomach at exactly 8:45. Patiently waiting, 11:00 rolls around and I am feeling absolutely nothing. Literally no onset effects or anything to note I had even taken a substance. About 11:10, I vaporized a small sized bowl of cannabis hoping maybe it needed a kick start and again, nothing. I was only high, not noticing any of the 2C-B.<br /><br />I go ahead and shower, lay down in my bed and threw a movie on believing nothing is going to hit me then bam - 11:40 and I&#039;m being guided through a very gentle 2C-B trip. Visuals are softly distorted, audio sounds great, and tactile sensations are wonderful, and the comedown was very smooth. The quintessential low dose 2C-B trip.<br /><br />My curiosity lies in why did it take three hours to kick in? I understand it can have a long come-up, but three hours? Typically it hits me within an hour. All variables seemed to be appropriate. My last meal was four hours earlier. I take a good supplemental stack to counteract any negatives. The 2C-B is most assuredly pure based on having ran it through an acetone wash and previous field experiences from both myself and others. My only thoughts as of the moment is perhaps vasoconstriction was limiting it from hitting me and perhaps the shower aided in that. Any ideas?

				2c-b has been so random for me lately.<br /><br />I had a 30mg dose take 2 hours to start coming up on an empty stomach, then 35mg came up in like 45 minutes the week after.<br /><br />I have to give a low dose a try now, I keep hearing tactile sensation effects are part of it but at high doses I get none of these experiences.&nbsp; Just a very shallow visual trip that goes away in 2 hours and doesn&#039;t really give me the drive to do anything.

				Usually 2c-b takes 3 hours to fully come up for me. One time I took it on an empty stomach in the morning and it still took 2 hours, damn 2c-b is my favorite drug its incredible
