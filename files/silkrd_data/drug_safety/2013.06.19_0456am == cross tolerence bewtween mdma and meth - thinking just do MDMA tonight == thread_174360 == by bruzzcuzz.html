				ive got the choice to do tonight is some MDMA or meth.<br /><br />ive read that even though meth only affects seratonin in a minimal way that using meth in the days before MDMA will lessen the roll of MDMA.. <br /><br />so im assuming it better to do the MDMA tonight and wait a few days and at least doing meth a few days later ill get some rushiness from the meth.. but reversing it and doing meth tonight i might have to wait 2 or 3 weeks to get a decent roll from MDMA<br /><br /><br />anybody have experince using these combos on seperate nights?<br /><br />i know they both affect different nuerotrammitters but still understand from other sources online that there will be a lessened mdma roll if meth is used a few days before<br /><br /><br />and.. yes... tonight would be about &quot;the music&quot; but still would love doin what meth does to ya... if ya know what i mean ;) sometimes its hard to wait before making puddles and blowing clouds
