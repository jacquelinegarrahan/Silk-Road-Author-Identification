				Hi guys, I&#039;m new to the SR, and I am ready to make my first purchase. I have a lot of questions though, because I want to be 100% sure about what I&#039;m putting into my body, because I don&#039;t want to end taking fake crap and going to the hospital. I&#039;m kind of confused as to how to tell the difference between a fake pill, and a real one, before ingesting it? Say like I have a 25MG adderall, and a 25MG fake adderall, is there anyway to tell a difference? Also with cocaine, is there anyway to tell if it&#039;s been cut with bad things like cleaner? I&#039;ve bought from dealers before, and didn&#039;t have any doubts because I knew them on some sort of level, but buying from a complete stranger automatically put my guard up. I would appreciate any and all answers that you guys give, and I thank each and everyone of you for responding.<br /><br /><br />Oh yeah, this was an important question I wanted to ask. Do you think I should get the product shipped to my PO Box? I live in an isolated place right now, and I can&#039;t use USPS. What do you guys think?

				The majority of vendors on SR are reliable, reputable, and trustworthy. If you look next to the vendors name you will see a number. This number is the vendor&#039;s rating on a scale of 1 - 100 with 100 being the best. Any vendor with a rating over 90 will be selling you exactly what you were expecting to get. Also you can read other user&#039;s feedback on the vendor&#039;s service and product quality.<br /><br />Even though the majority of vendors on SR are reputable, you should always test your drugs before taking them. You can get various tests like the ones on http://eztest.com/ to see if your drugs have been cut or adulterated.
