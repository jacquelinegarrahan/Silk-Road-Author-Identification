				Hey guys.<br /><br />So I met with my clinician today for this intensive Dialectical Behavioural Therapy program for sufferers of borderline personality disorder.&nbsp; She said in order to enter the program, I have to quit marijuana.<br /><br />Now...&nbsp; I have bulimia as well, and the last time I quit smoking weed I dropped 80 lbs.&nbsp; Is there any way I can get around this?&nbsp; I really need the help, but I&#039;m scared to drop all that weight again.<br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp; Advice?&nbsp; Blah.&nbsp; They say drugs don&#039;t mesh with their therapy because it doesn&#039;t focus on the concept of &#039;mindfulness&#039; and living in the moment, but rather, escapism.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I guess it all depends on the type of therapy the Dr (You mentioned clinician??) is providing as well as the medication(s) they&#039;ll prescribe.<br /><br />I&#039;d keep your stash, and wait a week or so, and tell them you&#039;ve gone cold-turkey in order to get treated.&nbsp; &nbsp;If they ask, tell them you&#039;re serious about therapy, and want to get well, and that was your motivation for stopping (Sorry, but I think pot is absolutely harmless) .<br /><br />Look up the meds they prescribe and.or talk to people on the forum about possible interactions.<br /><br />Naturally (I assume) the psychiatrist is not going to recommend you continuing illicit drugs while under their care (Assuming your not in a a weed-legal state), therefore they can track your progress in relation to others.<br /><br />I saw a psychiatrist for a number of years, and found no ill effects or &#039;springboarding&#039; affects of other medications while in treatment.&nbsp; If anything it reduced my smoking.<br /><br />I also found that I didn&#039;t have the desire to drink that I had before treatment. <br /><br />If you decide to go with the Dr., Research the medication and it&#039;s side effects thoroughly.&nbsp; My Doc didn&#039;t mention some of the things I experienced, and we went thru a trial and error of meds at the beginning of my treatment.<br /><br />One last thing:&nbsp; Did you check out/investigate the Dr you are contemplating to see whether they&#039;re board certified to treat the diagnosis you are seeing them for?&nbsp; And also, I&#039;d never see a GP, or psychcologist; only a psychiatrist.

				i think quite the contrary, weed totally helps you focus on the beauty of your surroundings and can be used to focus on the current moment but with a new perspective which i feel could actually be helpful in therapy, but i am no therapist. <br /><br />other drugs i can certainly understand being used to escape from reality in a way and understand their point of view.<br /><br />however, it seems like you need to weigh the benefits you get from smoking against the benefits of the treatment as well as the negatives of each... potentially you could at least stop smoking and this treatment can help the bulimia as well or you could at least make it through the treatment then smoke again.<br /><br />not sure how weed exactly helps with bulimia though? maybe my perception of the disorder is incorrect. does it help you avoid the purging somehow, cause even if it increases your appetite my understanding would mean this has minimal effect, no matter how much you binge.... there are other medications that can increase appetite or decrease nausea and inhibit the reflex for gastric dumping, not sure if they may be of benefit to replace the effect of weed <br /><br />good luck with your treatment regardless! there are many people here who love you if you ever need support

				Dude I almost never listen to what doctors tell me to do, I know it might sound kind of crazy but that plaque on their walls isn&#039;t enough of a reason for me to trust myself with them. I go to multiple physicians and a hospital with multiple psychiatrists. Do some research on your own.<br /><br />IMO, and remember I said IMO go to a psychiatrist, tell them you wanna quit weed without going back to your old eating habits and get a prescription for low amounts of SSRI&#039;s. I started taking them about 5 weeks ago and the only time I&#039;m over-hungry now is when I smoke my occasional bowl pack.<br /><br />Do some research, the program you&#039;re going into sounds like one of those programs where you just sit around and talk a couple times a week, like group therapy pretty much. I don&#039;t think having a little leverage like an anti-depressant will hurt all that much.<br />It may even help you to progress faster, and think about how much harder it&#039;ll be for you to control your emotions and self esteem if you go back to your bulimic habits?<br /><br />You can also try holistic medication if you want to go all natural. There&#039;s St Johns wort, 5htp, L-Tyrosine, LevoDopa, Ginkgo Biloba and tons of other natural meds that can give you some leverage over your eating habits.

				Lie, unless they are going to be testing you and you don&#039;t know how to pass a test. Weed is one of those substances that rarely interacts with any other kind of therapy in a negative way. I have no references to back this, just hearsay and personal experience, but for what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;d keep smoking, especially if it&#039;s benefiting your health in some way.

				Yeah use your own judgement, In my personal opinion I don&#039;t like leaving my health soley in the hands of a another person. As long as your not in a state where you&#039;re capable of hurting others or yourself the worst that happens is that your program fails the first time and then you&#039;ve got some knowledge under your belt of what needs to be done to help yourself. You have your whole life to make as many trial and error efforts as it takes to find your solution.
