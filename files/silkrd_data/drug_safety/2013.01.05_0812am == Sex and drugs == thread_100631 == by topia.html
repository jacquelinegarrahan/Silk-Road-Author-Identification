				Hello.&nbsp; I am interested to see how my recent experiences chalk up to the rest of the SR community&#039;s.&nbsp; I am a late twentysomething year old man, in a committed long term relationship with a late twentysomething year old woman.&nbsp; My drug of choice is Ketamine, but I am an amphetamine fan in general.&nbsp; My partner is a opiate user.&nbsp; <br />When I use stims I have an insatiable desire to have sex, but I could never achieve an erection.&nbsp; When I use opiates, specifically heroin, I get a big fat boner after I do a shot, but don&#039;t feel particularly horny.&nbsp; My partner becomes a total freak in bed when she is high on H.&nbsp; She doesn&#039;t use stimulants at all.&nbsp; <br />Are these common male/female responses?&nbsp; Or is this just another case of different biological predispositions for particular substances?

				I don&#039;t about opiates, but for example after some low doses of GBL/GHB my girlfriend becomes very horny, I am as well. If I take any dosage of it alone I would fuck anything, ANYTHING moves or not! And I am doing some very bizarre things, like running completely naked&nbsp; across my town, looking for some random sex...completely animal!

				I could never get hard on opiates tbh..but i do get sensitive skin sensations,me and my partner get naked and she sort of tickles and caresses me with her fingers all over my body..absolute bliss.<br />Now with coke,that&#039;s a different story,i get extremely horny,and all i wanna do is fuck!Viagra keeps me hard and wanting more..it maintains your erection.But of course,know your body before trying the combinations.<br /><br />BP<br /><br />

It&#039;s a very common experience and dilemma actually - stimulants making you horny and dysfunctional and depressants making you highly functional but somewhat ambivalent! Personally I prefer depressants all the time for sex. And to stimulate desire one can use the entactogens like 2C-B and 5-MeO-MIPT. My favorite for sex is GHB (for deep relaxation) + one of the aforementioned entactogens to provide stimulation and eroticism...<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of discussion on the subject here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10532.0<br /><br />BG<br />
