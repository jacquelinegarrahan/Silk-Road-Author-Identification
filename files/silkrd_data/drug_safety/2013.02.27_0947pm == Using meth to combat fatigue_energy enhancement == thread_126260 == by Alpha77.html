				Does anyone use say 5mg-30mg of meth for increased energy and productivity? I experience pretty bad lethargy/fatigue as a side effect from anabolic steroid use. Ideally I was looking for d-amphetamine, but it&#039;s too pricy on here, then I checked out some of the street amp sulfate but I thought that meth, preferably crystal meth (d-meth) would be a better option than d-amp or street amphetamine. I&#039;m just a little worried about addiction and the sigma attached to meth.

				Why would you consider meth as a first choice medication for this? Substances like caffeine en ephedrine can also be very effective in reducing fatigue without risking problematic dependence issues,.

				i&#039;ve tried it and the negative side effects outweighed the advantages<br /><br />try modafinil although maybe that is too expensive for you as well<br /><br />

				Quit steroids &amp; get some good spicey food, fruit, yoghurt, a pomegranate, your favourite herbal teas - you get the drift<br />Hope that helps, cheers :)<br /><br />and yes, coffee of course is good, too, if not overdone ;)

I&#039;ve extensively used ephedrine, 1,3 DMAA, and probably take about 1000mg-1200mg of caffeine per day. The problem with those chemicals is they leave me wired and tweaked out and I basically pace around my room instead of getting work done. Adderall was much different, it made me calm and gave me an almost tunnel vision effect<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked up modafinil and found a lifetime supply for a decent price, but I read that effects wear off after about 3 weeks of use.

				I&#039;m affraid all stimulants, even modafinil, will lose their efficacy rather quickly. <br /><br />If you are taking caffeine by the gram, you probably have reached the limit of what can be done without extreme health risk. Meth, cocaine, aderall, speed and such will not prove to be much different. They will all boost your activity on the short term, but the effect wears off quickly and dependence develops. This is even true for something benign like caffeine, if you stop using that you&#039;ll probably experience withdrawal symptoms like headaches and such.

The only thing that combats fatigue is sleep/proper rest. Unless you are in the army getting fired at 24/7 by the enemy it is not worth it and wont help you in the long run. Maybe you should get your natural testosterone levels checked/blood work done to see if there are other problems causing your fatigue that can be treated.

				That might be a bit drastic. Many of us need a little pick me up in the morning, usually served in the form of coffee and a cigarette or two. <br /><br />The problem is finding the balance between what is reasonable and what is beyond that. <br /><br />Personally i&#039;d say that meth is beyond, but on the other hand i have used ephedrine to get myself to work at times.

				kratom might be a better alternative for energy enhancement. low doses have stimulating yet relaxing effects. this is coming from someone who barely has any energy. the only thing that helps me more than kratom is cannabis. :)

				Meth works fantastically for fatigue/focus, but if your body&#039;s tired it isn&#039;t going to force you to survive the overtime.&nbsp; If your body is on the verge of collapse, taking meth will just make you &quot;feel&quot; like you can keep going but your body will give out with or without your permission.<br /><br />There is also the addictive properties (meth is a hell of a drug man, seriously) -- it&#039;s the only drug I literally felt like I was getting slowly addicted to in the most true sense of the word.<br /><br />If you think you can control it (it&#039;s not easy) give it a try, but it sounds like you will feel okay with using it more and more often and eventually if you actually observe your patterns, you&#039;ll realize that you&#039;re getting hooked.&nbsp; It is probably the king of the stimulant world IMHO right now, and also comes with just as harsh negative side effects for all the positives it has.&nbsp; Use with caution.

Studies using brain scans to compare a regular morning coffee drinker with someone who doesnt showed that drinking coffee in the morning by a regular drinker just returned their brain to what is considered the normal state (i.e., the state that the non-drinker was in).

				Like others have mentioned, you&#039;ll probably only get long term lasting results out of diet and exercise. It sucks but the brain is just too fucking adaptive for anything else to work for too long. I know it sounds stupid but honest to god the high from a three mile run at dawn can beat most any drug I&#039;ve taken, even if it&#039;s been far too long since I got off my fat ass and did it. <br /><br />If you want to go the stim route you&#039;ll want to change the game up a little just like you do with the steroids. Have a week of caffeine, a week of meth, a week of modifil, a week off and repeat. If can find a regime that keeps the tolerance low you might be able to keep it going for a while but it&#039;s like pulling a rubber band and at some point it will break and normally the downside of that sucks more than avoiding it in the first place.<br /><br />Good luck though, let us know if you find something that works out well.

				Even such an approach would presume there is no cross tolerance between these substances. I doubt it will prove that way in reality.
