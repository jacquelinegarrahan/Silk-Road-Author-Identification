				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about trying coke for the first time. I&#039;ve done just about everything else except opiates which I plan on staying away from until I reach at least eighty.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping for a little advice as far as dosages go and how long lasting the effects are. From what I&#039;ve read, it sounds like it doesn&#039;t last too long. 20 minutes?<br /><br />I was thinking about buying .5g to test out. Is that enough for a first time binge? Too much?<br /><br />How much do you snort? How bad is the drip?<br /><br />How worried should I be about heart problems?<br /><br />I&#039;m mostly curious about it&#039;s sexual properties. How horny does it make you? How is the sex or is it even possible to perform?<br /><br />Thanks for all your help. You&#039;re about the only people I trust.<br /><br />Crisis

				So fucking funny as I was trying to post the warning comes up saying there has been another post and I chucklled thinking it will be that coke head Biggles LMFA, and so it was. Crisis there is not much more to add to Mr Biggles. But emphisize pick right. Even though I love TV&#039;s coke I would start with MIN as it is just old school great product! Especially like it is your first time. <br /><br />The only thing I would change is go a big first line .2 You only have a first experience once! And being the first I believe it will last 1 hour. Biggles you know its true dont do a first small line. get the full effects and fall in love with the drug. And sex yes, make sure you have options available otherwise you may want o fuck your best mate. If you are female however this is IMO a natural hing and picture need to be taken and sent directly o my email address hoffa@tormail.net&nbsp; ;D (As a thank you for the advise)<br /><br />Whatever you do be social and enjoy the ride, it is an excellent place<br /><br />Hoffa

				as a guy that used to do a gram in 3 lines, without wishing to be a prude, some sort of gumming might be a good idea to test for any allergies before coating ones nasal passage in something their body might not potentially be able to tolerate. again not wishing to be a square man but if peanuts can kill people so can coke...

				Thanks everyone for the great advice. I just ordered .5g from W007. He was the only one listing half g&#039;s and he seems reputable. Anyone here have any experience with him?<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#039;m pretty excited and I plan on taking it slow and easy. Don&#039;t want to over do it.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Crisis

You don&#039;t have to go straight to mainlining heroin. There is a HUGE range of fun to be had with opiates without risking addiction.<br /><br />Have you never had any pain pills? You know, after the dentist or surgery or something. The pill bottle will say &quot;Hydrocodone&quot; (which is Vicodin) or &quot;Oxycodone&quot; (which is Percocet), etc...those are opiates.<br /><br />They give a very nice euphoric buzz, especially if you have a little alcohol and cannabis with them while you&#039;re waiting for them to kick in. But here&#039;s the thing...after you do this for a day or two (at least, that&#039;s how long it takes me), you need like 4-5 times as many to get &quot;high&quot; as you did the first time. But that&#039;s bad...because of all the acetaminophen (aspirin) in them.<br /><br />So, that&#039;s where you reach the crossroads. Is chasing that high worth migrating to more powerful opiates, do you can avoid damaging your liver with all the aspirin? For me, it&#039;s a no brainer. I hate the nod, GOD do I hate that nodding drowsy morass that opiates turn into rather quickly. I only like that big euphoric hit, feeling like I&#039;m on top of the world.<br /><br />That&#039;s where it ends for me. I don&#039;t buy more, I let my tolerance subside while I go back about my normal routine...<br /><br />Just draw the line at low-strength pharmaceutical opiates, have some fun with those (they go GREAT with blow by the way), and never even fuck with snorting, smoking, or injecting an opiate. And then you honestly have nothing to worry about.

				Do a big line for your first line. <br /><br />Like .2, as others have said. <br /><br />Cocaine is a decent drug, and is easy to accidentally become addicted to... You honestly won&#039;t even notice your addicted until you&#039;ve been binging for a few months. <br />-ETA : I should clarify... You aren&#039;t going to get addicted quickly. It&#039;s not like the media says. I would say it takes months to actually become addicted. <br /><br />It can get expensive.<br /><br />It&#039;s worth trying or doing occasionally... But it isn&#039;t that great. (I say this as an ex coke head of ~3 years) <br /><br />My favorite part was the numbing sensation, lol. <br /><br />Haven&#039;t touched coke in... 5+ years now. <br /><br /><br />

				When you guys say .2, you mean 20mg right? So conceivably, half a gram should last awhile.<br /><br />As for opiates, friendlyoutlaw, I agree with you, they get a bum rap. It&#039;s just not the kind of high I&#039;m looking for right now and I don&#039;t see any good reason to flirt with it until I&#039;m ready. And to be honest, I rather experiment with straight-up heroin than prescription pills. I think they give you a false sense of security and could more easily lead to abuse.

				You&#039;ll feel on top of the world. The coke will make you feel chatty, confident, and horny. The ideal combination for hitting on a girl (or guy, whatever your preference) that is way out of your league. Speaking from experience here. :)

				And depending who you are, doing coke by yourself is fucking way better than with people imo. I love both but I rather do a shitload of coke and record music or paint. <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s since art is my life, but i feel that i get more crazier/lucid thoughts when I&#039;m by myself doing coke(and H most of the time haha). Coke is amazing for concerts too. Fill some empty pill capsules and snort the whole inside(150-200mg) during some dope parts of the concert...yeeeeeeeee haha.
