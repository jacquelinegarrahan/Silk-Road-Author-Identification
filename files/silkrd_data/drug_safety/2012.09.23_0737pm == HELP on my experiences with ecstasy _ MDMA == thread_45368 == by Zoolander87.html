				Hey guys! <br /><br />I&#039;m quit new to this scene. So here&#039;s my story so far:<br /><br />I got hooked 2 months ago when I took my first half of ecstasy. WOW what a trip! I felt really euphoric and loved up.<br />It was one of the best experiences in my life. Never felt something like that before. The pill came up very smooth and lasted for 4-5 hours. Also the came down was very smooth and didn&#039;t had any side effects the day after.<br /><br />By this first trip u can imagine how curious I was to do some more!&nbsp; :)<br />After a week or so I got on SR and ordered my first blue defqon&#039;s. The week after I received these I tried one.&nbsp; :o (approx 1 month after I took my first exstasy)<br /><br />I took a half one because i&#039;m totally not experienced at all. I didn&#039;t felt anything after an hour and decided to took the other half.<br />The pill came up after 20 mins but wasn&#039;t what I expected at all! The first 20 minutes was hell! I felt dizzy and was sweating alot! Also got a&nbsp; panic attacks. These where the longest 20 minutes of my life, lol :) After&nbsp; this I hit my high, but the trip was very different from my first pill! I felt very sleepy but couldn&#039;t stand still. It wasn&#039;t bad at all, but it was just a totally other world then my first experience.<br /><br />So after that I decided to order some pure MDMA Crystals since I read alot of good things about it. I dipped it this weekend and yeah again : a totally other experience. I wasn&#039;t quite there after my first dip so I dipped again after a hour. It started working after 20 mins. Came up was smooth and I felt like dancing. After an hour or so I felt very sleepy again and couldn&#039;t keep my eyes open. I was still triping as hell tho. It felt good, but wasn&#039;t very euphoric. I actually was very anti-social and I was into my own world. <br /><br />So here&#039;s my question for u guys : How come I read alot of mixed answers on the use of MDMA? Some say the sleepiness is quite normal if u got GOOD MDMA. Some say the same product can give u the same sleepiness but on the other hand also alot of euphoria, depending on when u take it. <br /><br />I&#039;m actually looking for that euphoric and loved up feeling but couldn&#039;t find it yet. What is the best way to go? Trying out some more pills or pure MDMA?<br /><br />Cheers guys for ur feedback. <br /><br /><br />

				it really depends how the molly(mdma) or pills are synthesized and what there REALLY cut with.<br />have you ever been on anti depressants? those will have an effect on how you experience taking that drug.<br />my recommendation; try some other vendors. mix it up(piils vs molly) cause everyone will handle it differently.<br />good luck and hope i was of some help<br />

				Cheers eskimoplea. I never took anti depressants, I&#039;m actually going quite happy through life :)<br />What i&#039;m wondering about is, why i&#039;m feeling sleepy on MDMA ? Is it normal ? <br />

				The first pill you took probably included some kind of amphetamine and/or caffeine. Poly drug use can be dangerous so be careful what you mix with your roll, but most people enjoy MDMA with some kind of stimulant too. Remember to take good breaks between rolls (4 weeks ideally), get lots of sun, preload with vitamin-C and keep yourself healthy. Be well rested before you start. Also don&#039;t drink alcohol before you dose and don&#039;t have a big meal beforehand either. Both of these things will dull the effects. Tick all these boxes and roll and let me know how you go!

				Thats strange alright, the only thing ive ever heard to cause this kind of reaction was if you were on anti depression / anxiety medication, but your not so maybe its bad quality product? Blue Defqons should be spectacular pills all the same though! Is your general health good?<br /><br />I cant recommend enough that next time you go for MDMA take 25mg of 2c-i with 120mg of MDMA together in a capsule or &quot;bomb&quot;, its the best drug combo ive ever taken, its been 2 weeks and im still mesmerized by how great it felt , if your into your MDMA you will love it, i cannot stress how much the 2-ci compliments the MDMA! My girlfriend called it MDMA in High Definition :)

				I agree with TheBusiness.&nbsp; I definitely think the first pill you got had some speed in it. whether amphetamine, or methamphetamine, shit it could even be mephedrone or any number of stimulants that also produce euphoria and add to the effect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly you&#039;re not gonna find another pill with the same effects. even the same producers switch it up pretty often(i&#039;m assuming that you got it in the US and that it was from a street dealer).<br /><br />You&#039;re best bet is just get used to and enjoy how real MDMA feels or purchase some speed to compliment it.<br /><br />Also, this may be of assistance to you.&nbsp; My Fiance really doesn&#039;t like MDMA because of how tired she gets and she can&#039;t be up dancing and enjoying herself.&nbsp; that was untill i gave her some of ST(SuperTrips)&#039;s stuff.&nbsp; SHE LOVES IT!&nbsp; She absolutely can&#039;t believe how much better it is than all the other varieties she&#039;s tried.&nbsp; I myself am rather partial to ST&#039;s stuff myself but it&#039;s so pricey i can&#039;t usually persuade myself to invest in it.&nbsp; Anywho, if you&#039;ve got the funds to spare i&#039;d DEFINITELY recommend giving some of his White Speakers(i think they&#039;re &#039;?&#039; now) a shot!<br /><br />Peace and Love

				Some good stuff there from TheBusiness and thisworld.<br /><br />So much attention is given to the whole set/setting thing, but I always come back to what neuro/physiological state a person is in at the time a substance is consumed. It&#039;s right that you&#039;ll probably never find the exact same pill formulation twice. Even with pure powders, there are variations, unwashed byproducts, etc. <br /><br />But if you think of your body as a giant chemical reactor, with thousands of compounds reacting without end in thousands of processes, it&#039;s pretty clear your body will never be in the same exact chemical state twice. All you can do is achieve a range of consistency by choosing a diet / lifestyle that is compatible with getting you euphorically high as fuck as much as possible.<br /><br />It ain&#039;t food and supplements - it&#039;s fuel and boosters for my rocket ship.<br /><br />It ain&#039;t having a rest break - it&#039;s a 4 week chemistry prep before the event.<br /><br />It ain&#039;t being healthy - it&#039;s the byproduct of being a highlympian athlete. <br /><br />May I also recommend MDA or 6-APB if you are into the euphoria side of things.&nbsp; 8)

				Thanks for the replies guys, very useful feedback!<br /><br />I actually don&#039;t consider myself that unhealthy, I try to go to the gym twice or 3 times a week. <br />Of course that isn&#039;t a guarantee for a healthy lifestyle, I&#039;m aware of that. So like u guys said taking a vitamin and aiming for a healthier lifestyle is a good idea!<br /><br />Oh btw! I forgot to mention that the sleepiness also occurred with my friend. He also dipped twice and had the same sleepiness over him. He experienced it way more annoying then I did tho. (easyjet&#039;s MDMA / perfect communication and very fast delivery )<br /><br />Thanks for pointing out SuperTrips&#039;s MDMA. I guess that will be my next order! <br />Only good reviews about his stuff! I guess it&#039;s all about experimenting and finding out what product best suits me. <br /><br />Good filosofy there chemdog!&nbsp; :) The human body is indeed a chemical reactor. <br />I guess i&#039;&#039;m in for a little break now. Recharging my body and taking some extra vitamins.<br /><br />Thanks again guys for your time.

				definitely consider his pills too! specifically his white &#039;speakers&#039;.&nbsp; ONLY TAKE HALF!!!&nbsp; I&#039;m very experienced(years and years, as many as a dozen pills in a night[really stupid i know]) and a half was GOOD.&nbsp; of course that was after a 6 month break, but DAMN!&nbsp; My friend who&#039;s taken 20+ pills in a night and who was still taking pills and MDMA regularly took a whole one(against my recomendation) and puked after 15 -20 minutes.&nbsp; then proceeded to have the best, hardest roll of his life!<br /><br />Seriously, ST&#039;s shit is BOMB!

				Defqons (and pure MDMA) are so clean that if you have no stimulant with them, they &quot;floor&quot; you - basically you feel so good you can&#039;t or don&#039;t want to move. First time I had one I got almost the exact same experience as you. I had a half, an hour later I still couldn&#039;t feel it, had the other half and it all smacked me in the face at once. I didn&#039;t panic because my mate knew what was going on and kept me from freaking out, but I did end up &quot;overloading&quot; for about 3 hours, can&#039;t remember anything of it except how good I felt.<br /><br />I usually just have some caffeine half an hour or so before I drop - I don&#039;t like mixing drugs, the caffeine is nice and simple and keeps me on my feet.<br /><br />One last thing - I find that I get more euphoria on a higher dose, whereas a lower dose (or the start of the comedown) makes me super friendly. Not sure if that&#039;s the same for everyone, but it works for me.

				Molly can sometimes get me pretty lazy when I don&#039;t have some thumping music to keep me busy. What I usually do is take caffeine powder, if i&#039;m having 150mg MDMA, I have 75MG Caffeine with it, then an hour or more later have another 75MG, some people don&#039;t recommend mixing caffeine and MDMA but I haven&#039;t had any problems in the years that I have done it. <br /><br />Or I am too fried to notice.

				one more note, they take ~1.5 hours to come up(at least they did for me the first time, after that they seemed to come up significantly faster, but don&#039;t redose till at least that point..
