				I need some advice. I live in an area where coke isn&#039;t moved around that often. It is, but not to the people I know. I wanna share the cocaine love, but I want to make a profit out of it. Most of the people I&#039;m talking about aren&#039;t experienced with it anyway. I heard cutting it can also prevent a user from going overboard... that&#039;s if it&#039;s cut with something that won&#039;t be even more hazardous than the cocaine itself.<br /><br />So to start off my questions, which would be best to cut it: lidocaine, benzocaine, speed, or something else?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure where I&#039;m gunna get the start cocaine yet. I need it to be good enough quality so that if I cut it, it won&#039;t be total shit. I was looking at a new vendor named WhiteDreams who apparently sells uncut coke from Panama. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5af1f2453a<br /><br />On the East Coast, what is a recommended selling price (by the .5 and g)?

				Imho if you want to make money id clean the coke instead of diluting it and then sell it at a premium. People will come back for quality and will find another dealer if you have subpar stuff. Im not into the coke business so I cant recommend any vendors but if I were you id save up for a Oz, wash it and pray you have 20 grams left and then sell it in singles. Also, dont do your own product, you wouldnt be the first dealer who snorts his whole stash.

				benzocaine. But, it is really hard to get these things without popping up as a red flag with the chemical supply house you will have to buy it from. If you have a very good operation then I would say to get one of your underlings to buy it. Otherwise, it is way more hassle than it is worth.

				We have never see coke for good price on SR. The C game is a real life game. Zip for 900-1200? You will get garbage. You want to play you need to buy 1/4kilo and more cash in person with people you can trust.<br /><br />If you want to try, get a zip for around 2000 of HQ stuff here and sell at premium 100/g, you will make 800 and have very happy people.

				Within the next two weeks CannaConnection will be opening up shop for really high quality coke. We also will be selling cannabis products as well. Our prices will beat cocaine that is being sold for 150-190 from Nod or Dr White that is the same or better quality always. Our prices will be starting out at less than half of their prices that they have it for. We will be pushing out samples that you can read reviews from. You will be able to purchase small amounts of our products to test for yourself though starting at around 20$. Keep an eye out.<br /><br />I am in no way knocking on Nod or Dr White. I have bought their cocaine products in the past and had a great time. I just happened upon a really really good coke connect and this stuff gets my head spinning! Way more euphoric than anything I have ever had before with a great speediness. No jitters. If you do too much... well, bad things can happen.

I&#039;m against getting product that isn&#039;t what you expected as well, but after doing a good amount of research, it seems like most people expect to receive cut coke.

				Just don&#039;t cut it.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s super fucking tempting. But if you really want to pick up a loyal customer base, just steer clear.<br /><br />Not on SR, but in the wild, there is a rash of people passing off shitty RC&#039;s (4-FA, etc) cut up with benzocaine. It&#039;s giving coke a bad name. If you start down the road to ripping off your customers, where does it stop?

				The first ten people on this thread that messages me I will offer an ounce of coke for 1500 dollars. The 3 different types of countries cocaine that I will be supplying is the highest quality cocaine available. Dr White &amp; Nod quality. I know it is better than Dr White&#039;s supply. They are selling grams of stuff that is less quality than I for 150-180 dollars a gram. My vendor page will be open within these upcoming two weeks. We will be able to supply the best coke on SR for the cheapest prices. That&#039;s right! And if you are not comfortable with that large of a purchase then we will be offering samples for very cheap prices so you can taste yourself before you make that investment. All my products are at the ez test 5 star purity range. <br /><br />The guys I have on the street are selling grams for 100-150 dollars and people are more than happy to pay that price. I have been told by many people that they never have snorted coke this great. I will let everyone test that theory out themselves though! Within the next two weeks there will be reviews on the forums from people that are testing our cocaine that we gave the product to for free! We hope to be working very tightly with the SR community very soon. And look forward to serve everyone&#039;s quality coke needs for the prices they deserve.

				If you can lay your grubby mits on it you really&nbsp; want NOVAcaine , BENZOcaine is a poor&nbsp; substitute used by those who can&#039;t get NOVAcaine , swims man&nbsp; ( who worked for his man , who worked for his man ect ) used to come round&nbsp; with a bag of Nova and would watch as it was cut it at the desired ratio ( the same ratio as the rest of the outlets&nbsp; they controlled&nbsp; &nbsp;) , swim was free allowed to take personal out within reason .<br /><br />They did it this way for a good reason , because they could and they wanted the right people to know they could - picture Mr Burns =) .<br /><br />Anyway don&#039;t bother repressing if your market is small and knowledgeable , anyone with half a brain can rock it up to see how much cut you used - and trust me anything you get will be cut at least 10 - 20 % allready - unless you happen to be living in on a south american mountain slope .<br /><br />My spidey sense says go with cc&#039;s Bolivian if&nbsp; he can get it to you safe at the right price .<br /><br />BTW FAOTI swim swims were swim likes , dark or clear ! <br /><br />I prefer pepsi anyway =D<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve sold more kilograms of cocaine on this site than any other vendor that i know of. I would be very surprised if another vendor has ever even sold a full kilo, but its possible.
