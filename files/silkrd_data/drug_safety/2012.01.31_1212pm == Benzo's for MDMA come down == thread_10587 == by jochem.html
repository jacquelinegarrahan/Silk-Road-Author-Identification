				Title: <strong>Benzo's for MDMA come down</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>jochem</strong> on <strong>January 31, 2012, 12:12 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I always have a terrible come down on MDMA/XTC (sometimes on coke as well). Most annoying is the fact that the dopamine continues, so I can&#039;t sleep and feel quite a bit of paranoia (worrying about a racing heart, etc). Which made me wonder if any benzo&#039;s or other medicine would help. While researching this, I came across scary stories about benzo dependency and withdrawal, which made me wonder if it&#039;s smart to get into this.<br /><br />So basically I have two specific questions:<br /><br />- Which benzo or other medicine would you recommend to get rid of the paranoia and get me some sleep (I don&#039;t have to be knocked out completely, 5 hours or so would be awesome).<br /><br />- Will using this benzo create a dependency if it&#039;s used about once or twice every two months?<br /><br />I also have one more general question:<br /><br />- How does this benzo dependency work? Is it usually only in people who use it really regular (like at least once or twice a week) or has it more to do with the amount/lenght of use (so using it every month for year creates the same dependency as using it 12 days in a row).<br /><br />Looking forward to pointers/answers :).

				i can&#039;t speak for mdma because i never felt withdrawals coming off it even after a 2 day binge but as for the coke and for your symptoms i would highly recommend getting some xanax because it is the fastest working of all the benzos out there. it&#039;s what most hospitals give to patients who do too much speed/coke/meth or any upper but have perfectly fine vitals, etc...&nbsp; <br /><br />that said if you&#039;ve done enough mdma or coke the only thing it will do is what they were meant to do and that is to calm you the hell down. you&#039;re essentially doing a speed ball of sorts because you will still have the coke/mdma dopamine rush running through your body but the xanax will work directly on your nerves. similar to what narcotic pain killers do by working on the pain receptors but not the actual injury.<br /><br />just remember that after you&#039;ve taken the xanax and feel great/calm after about 15-20 mins that your still high and doing more drugs after this is not a great idea unless you know what you&#039;re doing. this should put you in a calm enough place so that you can get into bed and try to sleep. i recommend eating some complex carbs and protein to help also. even if you don&#039;t sleep but rest in bed for some hours you will feel a ton better if you had been up all night worrying. i sometimes take an ambien if none of the above works and this almost always delivers the knockout punch.<br /><br />you have nothing to worry about re: building a dependency since you won&#039;t be using them all that often. the only people i know who have had withdrawals from benzos were the ones that were taking them for years and on a daily basis. I once had minor withdrawals from taking very high doses of xanax daily for two months but it was nothing at all serious. on the other hand a good friend of mine tried to stop after 4 years and he ended up in the emergency room.<br /><br />good luck.

				2C-B wont help you sleep but it does have multiple reports on Erowid as dampening the after effects of MDMA. If taken as the MDMA peak is subsiding.

				I&#039;ve got quite a bit of experience with dodging the comedown, sometimes successfully, sometimes not :)<br />Get 15mg Diazepam into you about 6 hours after comeup- Diazepam is good as it sedates you a little bit but you don&#039;t feel like a zombie after 6 hours sleep. Don&#039;t drink anymore booze, get on the herb teas, I make up a pint of really strong green tea- several teabags and let it stew out all the antioxidants. Smoke some pot, maybe do a little bump of K, get under a duvet and enjoy the comedown (yeah, I said enjoy it!). Take a couple of multivitamins and a couple of 5-HTP and melatonin tabs then hit the hay. <br />Keep a few ibuprofen, 5-HTP and a pint of water by the bed for the second you wake up. Next day dose 5-HTP every 6 hours.&nbsp; You&#039;ll feel great the next day, and no midweek blues.

				I do have quite some experience using mdma myself :)<br /><br />I just force myself to eat some fruit before taking a nap.&nbsp; Vitamins are always good (that is what my mommy told me). I also force myself to drink some water, and put a bottle of water next to the bed. <br /><br />But I think the most important thing is &quot;go to bed when you feel like it&quot;. It doesn&#039;t make any sense to frustrate yourself by trying to sleep when it is impossible.<br /><br />Greetings,<br />Amsterdamgoods<br />

				Thanks for the info guys! I&#039;ll try and get some Xanax and see how that helps.<br /><br />I usually try to get some healthy stuff in me before going to bed and after getting up, but that doesn&#039;t really help with the come down and the paranoia afterwards.

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using Xanax for my comedowns about every second weekend for nearly five years, either after using amphetamines or MDMA. (Obviously, I use the MDMA a lot less frequently ;)). I have had no other urge to use the Xanax during the week, and my tolerance has barely increased. I have been using between 0.5mg and 2mg the whole time, sticking to the smallest dose necessary. (I have had a break from all drugs every so often in this period, too, and noticed no problems.<br /><br />My point is - I don&#039;t personally think you have anything to worry about, especially as you&#039;d be using it far less frequently than myself :)

				Ive always taken xanax when coming down off MDMA/Coke.. It helps you get to sleep much faster for sure, but just make sure u havent done too much of either (mdma or xanax) and u will be fine. Also, taking benzos once or twice a month will not cause you to have a dependance..

				Thanks everyone. Ordered a couple of Xanax, expect them somewhere this week. We&#039;ll see how it goes from there.<br /><br />@Tryptamine: I like chemical stuff, especially the stuff that has proven to work. I&#039;ve tried valerian and what not, but that never really helps.

				jochem, I know this probably goes without saying for you<br />but since this is a &#039;drug safety&#039; forum<br /><br />benzos and uppers are a dangerous combination. I have used lorazepam (ativan) and alprozolam (xanax) to effectively come down off extreme cocaine highs before (so I could go to sleep!). These substances are god sent for intense upper come downs and even psychedelic experiences where you just want rest after the trip.<br /><br />Be sure that when you take the benzo, you are DONE doing drugs for the night. Don&#039;t do anymore uppers or you will fuck your system. I always try to sleep on my side, especially if I have been drinking.

				benzo&#039;s are good.&nbsp; Really the ONLY benzo I see &quot;addiction&quot; with is xanax, due mostly to it&#039;s unique pharmaceutics.&nbsp; The physical withdrawals can kill you like alcohol with seizures/MI/stroke.&nbsp; Just take Ativan (Lorazapam), it is a mid-acting benzo that is really what &quot;they use in the hospital.&quot;&nbsp; Valium/klonopin are fine, but the half life can be days......I don&#039;t like having that numb feeling that long.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, can we see more US domestic Ativan available please.&nbsp; Also some injectable thorazine/geodone/haladol and pill zyprexa.&nbsp; :-*
