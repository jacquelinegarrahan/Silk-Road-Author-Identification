				I would say klonopin, If its a ongoing problem i.e. happening all day everyday.<br />If its after a hard days work. Then something shorter lasting i.e. .5mg of xanax.<br />Vals are useful to get to sleep if that&#039;s the thing (thats also helpful for restless leg syndrome)<br /><br />Bascially all benzos work the same but their half lifes make them all different and used for different things. Xannies are more like alochol hits you pretty damn hard, get a nice buzz off them. Whereas klonopin work for 2 days and its hard to tell when its kicked in cause it is so slow (peak is in 4 hours half life 40 hours), so that one makes you seem more relaxed and calm not drunk like xannies.

				I&#039;m surprised that no one has mentioned Tetrazepam. <br />Well perhaps it&#039;s one of the more obscure benzos out there, though unparalleled in its muscle relaxing effects (actually, there&#039;s hardly any sedation going on)! Used to have a prescription for that, was a godsend when it came to treating psychosomatic muscle tension/pain!<br />Looks like there&#039;s one German vendor selling it right now...

				Hold up, You should use muscle relaxants such carisoprodol (soma), or at second best Diazepam 5mg once daily.<br /><br />Do not self-medicate unless you genuinely have severe muscle spasm, which it then should be taken with rest and regular stretching. and absolutely do not combine either benzos or soma with opioids or alcohol without extreme caution. <br /><br />Bear in mind Benzos are the most physically dangerous of drugs besides alcohol to take regularly; their withdrawal genuinely will put your life in danger, on the mild side they ruin your sleep patterns, and so its best to avoid their use wherever possible.

				thanks for the advice on soma and flexoril.&nbsp; i&#039;m definitely not attached to benzos specifically, i just thought those were the main drugs used for muscle tension.&nbsp; i really don&#039;t know much about this side of the drug scene, so thank you guys.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;m not looking for something to use daily, i understand thats a terrible way to try to fix a problem.&nbsp; i exercise and stretch and stuff, but sometimes, totally out of the blue, i strain my neck or back somehow.&nbsp; i put heat on it and get massage, but taking a muscle relaxing drug in the evening really seems to speed up the recovery process.&nbsp; and honestly, these days its just easier for me to buy a few pills from SR than bother with talking to a doctor and trying to get them legitimately; my time is too valuable to me to waste it like that when the future (SR) is now&nbsp; 8)

				Good to hear man, have you ever tried voltarol gel? this shit is off the hook, takes away the pain within minutes. <br />Also united-pharmacies.com have some real good links for cheap, dont use a credit card with them though!

				Why do people prefer valium over others? I&#039;m just wondering because i have never taken it. After a shit comedown i take a xanax to feel a lot better.

				Diazepam/Valium has a longer&nbsp; elimination half life than alprazolam/Xanax so you dont need to redose throughout the day, some say xanax is more euphoric too

				hello!<br /><br />i suffer from occasional muscle cramps (especially in the right side of my body, not sure why) which make a grown man cry out loud in tears of pain, sometimes leaving my leg somewhat stiff and lame for days to come. it mostly happens when i fall asleep and you get this short &quot;zap&quot; through the body, or when i wake up.<br />taking drugs such as amphetamine, tramadol or wellbutrin seems to make it much more likely to happen. the cramps itself are not of a shivering/flickering nature, but rather an extremely sudden stiffening of all my right leg muscles, sometimes going up as far as&nbsp; the shoulder/armpit area<br /><br />the best remedy against a sudden attack is sublingual application of 1-2mg clonazepam drops. against the pain and tension afterwards or as a preventive measure, especially when taking other drugs that lower seizure threshold/cause muscle tension, gabapentine.<br /><br />besides clonazepam i have tried tetrazepam, which causes strong ataxia and muscle weakness long into the other day and provides not such a sudden relief since i could not find sublingual solution so far and diazepam, which is a great alternative to clonazepam, yet lasts much longer, has somewhat slower onset and provides more intoxicating effects, also long into the day after, which might not be desireable. clonazepam sticks out due to several reasons:<br /><br />it lasts shorter than diazepam, which has a similary strong muscle relaxing properties, but also with a much wider, stronger range of other benzo effects. especially more drowsyness. if there is no need to be under benzodiazepine influence for longer periods of time or other reasons, clonazepam has left the body after approximately 8-12 hours while diazepam in the 20-30mg range is well active for over 24 hours. tetrazepam leaves the muscle tone very limp and weak, yet acts a bit shorter than diazepam. forget about physical labor the next day. its like someone/something took away most of your muscle strenght. tetrazepam is more suitable for recreational use, to have a nice relaxing weekend, maybe to accent some opioids or cannabis. <br /><br />sublingual clonazepam solution has an extremly fast onset. with (chewed) 150mg of tetrazepam i have remained cramped up for several minutes, slowly getting better and remain free from all tension for the whole night/ next day. diazepam solution may also take some time, but with clonazepam i count the drops dropping in my mouth and by 20 or 30 the tension is as good as gone. if taken by bedtime, i wake up feeling barely under the influence of any benzodiazepine.&nbsp; when taken also during daytime, clonazepam leaves you less intoxicated than other benzo candidates. for the sudden attacks something with the duration of alprazolam and the muscle relaxing properties of tetrazepam, potent enough to make a sublingual solution would be perfect. so far such a benzo does not appear to be avaible. maybe midazolam, which has refreshingly high addictive potential though (too recreational, kind of like getting suddenly really happy/sloppy-drunk in terms of strenght of effects and duration) and is rather hard to obtain/more expensive. <br />alprazolam itself unfortunately has rather weak muscle relaxing properties, unless you dose very high, yet also a rapid onset. if its dosed high enough to relieve the tension, the comfortably short duration goes out of the window.<br /><br />to prevent it from happening all together, ~1mg clonazepam a day or 400-600mg gabapentine a day does great job. gabapentine also reliefs the pain that might have been caused from the cramps. if the pain persists, i sometimes also feel anxious to walk more than necessary as long as the aftermath-pain is present. clonazepam+gabapentine also gives more confidence to take proper steps rather than carefully dragging your leg behind when walking, expecting it to cramp up again when you take a wrong step. <br /><br />if your tension is more of a consistent deal, affecting more areas of the body, maybe after a heavy workout or hard labor, orphenadrine is a good non-benzo alternative. it has some recreational/intoxicating potential, especially in combination with other painkillers, but on its own keeps you functional and has both painkilling and muscle relaxing properties. <br /><br />if you are looking to fight tension caused some psychedelic phenethylamines come with (such as doc or dom), strong opiates in smallish doses are indeed a great choice. doc can cause +15 hours of feeling like someone stuck you in a hardwood box that makes it impossible to assume a comfortable position, with tension and pain in every single muscle on your body, while dom causes more of a restless/shivering/slightly stiff sensation. this can really impair your exerience of the basically nice substances. a hint of heroin or oxycodone can be a godsend here. it cancels all of the nasty body load and makes the whole deal much more euphoric, without taking away too much of the psychedelic nature.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />i hope the text contains some information relevant to your problem and gives you an idea for resolutions.&nbsp; <br />muscle tension and everything it comes with/causes it can really fuck up your day.
