				Would be interested on hearing your views....<br /><br />Truth be told I don&#039;t have a coke habit, I can take it or leave it, it&#039;s not an issue, really the last time before last I hadn&#039;t done it in like 2 years.&nbsp; The problem I have is that if I have half a gram I&#039;ll do half a gram, If I have 1 gram I&#039;ll do 1 gram and if I have 2 grams I&#039;ll do that too, all in one session.&nbsp; I can never just stop and save some for another day even though I know I&#039;ve had too much.&nbsp; It&#039;s a problem because cocaine being cocaine you reach a certain plateau where doing more cocaine will not make you feel better but only worse and could lead to worse.&nbsp; My favorite part about doing coke is that initial rush after the first few lines when you are coming up and I guess for an hour or so after.&nbsp; After that I am just chasing that rush or trying to prevent myself from coming down.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example the other night I had 1 gram of high quality coke, a great porn collection and a free hand.&nbsp; Within a few hours I had done half a gram and knew that taking more was not getting me higher.&nbsp; I also knew that taking more could be bad for my health and certainly make the hangover 10x worse.&nbsp; Yet despite knowing this and because I was high I spent the next few hours doing the other half and have been feeling like shit these last few days.<br /><br />Can anyone offer any advice on my predicament?&nbsp; Any tips or tricks people use to limit their intake?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried splitting and hiding it in the past but I end up just saying fuck it and &quot;finding&quot; it again.&nbsp; Anyone else have this problem?<br /><br />

				LOL :) so many times i found myself in same situation - i say if you do 2 grams once in 2 years / few months / few weeks <br />its not that bad to just get this over with - i think its more dangerous to save some for next time cause it makes you do the coke many more times in smaller amounts - that it might become a habit in sometime.

				I can really empathise with your feelings, it&#039;s imperative you have psychological control over your situation, when your ready to stop your coke session, it&#039;s important to ensure your nose is clean, you can do this by clearing out your nose with a saline spray and gently blowing, if you can breathe clearly, chances are it will help to relax you. Ascorbic acid (vitamin c) helps to naturally boost the immune system, helping to repair any damage. L-tyrosine and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) are also very beneficial for your symptoms. Hot green tea with a teaspoon of honey can have a relaxing and calming effect. A strong dose of melatonin 100mg, can also be extremely helpful for getting sleep when you&#039;ve overdone it. You could try taking a benzo like 10mg of valium, but don&#039;t mix it with other substances unless your certain it&#039;s safe to. A heavy indica might be beneficial, but this really depends upon you. If all else fails, and you really need to forget about having your next line, I hear having sex is very good for coming off the effects of too much coke. Hope this helps you and all the best for next time :)<br />

				Hey dude , the amounts and time frames you are giving are sooo minor man. I say when it is you decide you want to do some blow, get enough to last you all night, like an 8ball or two. Snort until the sun begins to rise, then drop a xanax bar and go to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;By doing this, you should most def get your fill and be totally satisfied with your night, and in turn will feel so terrible the next morning, you wont end up doing it again for a while. Good luck friend

				My answer may not be popular but it&#039;s pretty simple. <br /><br />Seroquel is a dopamine antagonist, and a powerful antihistamine/hypnotic. Seroquel IR would quickly begin to block (antagonist) your dopamine receptors from dopamine agonist cocaine. It will also if you aren&#039;t accustomed to it, knock you the fuck out. <br /><br />Follow it a benzodiazepine, in this case I would recommend lorazepam or alprazolam, possibly with a small amount of zoldpiem (Ambien)<br /><br />Other additions to this combination could include a nice indica bud and some melatonin and hydroxyzine.&nbsp;

It driver me absolutely crazy. I remember one night I had an 8 and we were doing it probably got half way through it and I was tired and ready to put it up, she ended staying up and killing my bag while I was asleep. Pissed me off so bad the next day, I said some mean things thatmade her cry and I can say I&#039;ve seen improvement since then lol.

				Session usually stops when it&#039;s all gone. I leave it at my girls house now if I get a mid week arrival to remove the temptation to &#039;just try a line&#039; then smash the whole bag and end up pulling an all-niter and feeling like rat shit the following day.<br /><br />Get a safe with a time delay lock&nbsp; :P<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Im exactly the same as the op but I think the heavy comedown helps curb my consumption. If I could bosh 1g every night and then do BruceCampbell&#039;s routine to knock me off to bed it might become a regular problem. <br /><br />Plus those hours as you struggle to get to sleep gives you plenty of time to reflect on how you have just blown £100-£200 for a a few wanks and a horrific head and nose the next day. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m sorry if this is not what you want to hear, but this is classic addiction.&nbsp; It&#039;s the reason we have trouble with specific drugs.&nbsp; Is there a fix?&nbsp; Frankly, I don&#039;t believe so.&nbsp; Maybe short term, but not forever.&nbsp; It&#039;s incredibly hard for me to stop redosing meth or speed when I&#039;m on a run.&nbsp; I can do a line of coke and turn more down, I can have a shot and not want another, I can take oxycodones and feel really good but not have any real difficulty not taking more.<br /><br />Amphetamines I can barely control once I get a taste.&nbsp; Had a good friend once that totally lost it to a coke addiction.&nbsp; She said once that it should just be called &quot;more,&quot; because that&#039;s all it really did -- was make her want more.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there&#039;s really a good answer to your question, myself.&nbsp; That&#039;s one of the reasons addiction can be so destructive.&nbsp; Because it&#039;s almost impossible to control even short term.&nbsp; If we could control our intake, it wouldn&#039;t be such a big deal, ya know.<br /><br />Never heard the joke about alcoholics -- &quot;one drink is too many, and a million&#039;s not enough?&quot;&nbsp; Well this is what it means.

				LMAO we should rename coke &quot;More&quot;.... i agree with you guys.... being in my late 20&#039;s now i found that ANY amphetamine causes problems like you guys were saying...besides...coke is a young mans drug...you don&#039;t wanna go dieing from a heart attack...but hnestly OP i have no idea... i would ease my comedown by saving a line for the next day... but that really wouldn&#039;t do much.... i have dropped some xanax bars in the morning and that actually worked...but adding drugs to fix drugs can be not the best in the world....

				Decide before the session starts how long you want to be high. Do math. Break off enough of the rock to last you for that amount of time, and cut it into lines. Do this liberally, as its better to have a little more than you were expecting than not enough. Then before you take your first line, put the rest away. I find that making a concrete decision while sober helps manage intake. If you need to go to bed afterwards, take a couple of shots, or have a few beers. Don&#039;t overdo it though, as I&#039;ve heard that mixing cocaine and alcohol can be very detrimental to your heart.

				It is; the two molecules apparently form another molecule as part of your enzymatic processing of them I think -- instead of cocaine and alcohol, you end up with cocaethylene.&nbsp; It&#039;s interesting to note though that I&#039;ve seen documentaries that stated some researchers say up to 75% of cocaine users always drink at least some alcohol while using.&nbsp; Apparently it lengthens the effect of the coke.<br /><br />I find this bizarre, personally, because alcohol kills the amphetamines that I so enjoy and I don&#039;t touch it unless I&#039;m not taking speed.&nbsp; But it is interesting if true.

This type of thinking only exonerates someone from personal responsibility, and reinforces this outdated idea that drugs are evil forces that will have unmanageable effects on ones life. It makes people want to continue banning and prohibiting drugs when you make them out to be completely out of control of the user.<br /><br />I believe there are a minority of the population that literally CAN&#039;T control their drug problems, but more often than not, I think people that take drug use too far simply lack planning and self discipline. I think it is within most people to quit before they use up the entire rock they just got. It is HARD, yes. But doable if you really want to.

				I find it&#039;s really helpful to have someone else with you that you&#039;re close enough with to regulate you a bit. When I was single my room mate kind of let me know when it was getting late and would crash, leaving me to either sit alone blowing lines or to follow to the sack. Now that I live with my boyfriend he is always in control of my stash. When I pick up I give it to him, he put it somewhere I&#039;m not aware of. When I want to do lines I ask, he provides, when the night is over her asks me to clear the plate and he puts away my stash. Trust and moderation is everything&nbsp; ;)

				This timing of this thread is impeccable as a friend of mine has an order on the way.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to suggest to him that he take small infrequent bumps to get where he wants to be instead of big lines.&nbsp; I&#039;ll also recommend leaving some at home and not bringing the entire bag.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely remind him of that shitty, sketchy feeling where you lay in bed for hours tossing and turning.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll probably give him a benzo to take afterwards too.&nbsp; :P

				Not really touched coke for a while, but I used to do it every weekend for 6 months, give it up for 3 months and then get back on it for 6 months.<br />Never had an issue with saving a bit for the next time, but I did have an issue with how long I&#039;d wait before the next time.<br /><br />I&#039;d go out on Friday night, knock down half a gram in a few hours and then stop taking it. I&#039;d then theoretically have half a gram left for the night after. But the &quot;night after&quot; normally started at about midday or before. Once that half had gone I wouldn&#039;t get any more until the following weekend, but I did feel I had a bit of a problem.
