				T+ 0:00 a capsule containing 150mg of 4-Fluoroamphetamine (4-FA) has been consumed, washed down with orange juice, along with a multivitamin, 500mg of choline bitartrate and 800mg of piracetam. I also ate a sausage and egg McGriddle and a hashbrown about 20 mins prior to consumption. <br /><br />I will be working on some 3D graphics and watching movies on my computer throughout the day. I will try to check in approximately every 30 mins or on the hour or if I feel any significant effects to log my current state. About to start watching Savages as I wait for it to kick in.<br /><br />As far as other substances I have experience with: marijuana, MDMA, MDA, LSD, shrooms, meth, Adderall, Ritalin, cocaine, 4-MEC, MPA, nitrous oxide, isobutyl nitrate, Salvia divinorum, ketamine, Vicodin, Tramadol, ephedrine, caffeine<br /><br />Stay tuned.

				T+ 0:42 I feel a slight pressure in my head and looseness in my shoulders. I feel quite floaty. There is a slight heaviness in my chest which isn&#039;t unpleasant. It&#039;s a bit similar to Adderall but not as tense. Slight giddy euphoria is present right now. Like the tingles you get along your back after a good laugh. Throat is starting to get a little dry. Still clear headed. I feel good. This seems to be a very smooth come up compared to Adderall and MDMA.<br /><br />T+ 1:00 I have become quite aware of the bracelets on my wrist. Their weight on my wrist is quite apparent and I am aware of the pressure of each bead on my skin. It feels nice to run my fingers through my hair and stretch. I can feel my heart rate elevated but my heart isn&#039;t pounding out of my chest. For a stimulant I actually feel quite relaxed. My arms feel a little heavy as I type. The movie is playing an orchestra piece rich with cellos and violins and it seems to add to my mood lift. The euphoria is present but quite mild compared to MDMA. I feel calm, relaxed, and peaceful. I have cheesy a Mona Lisa grin. I feel energetic but there is no urge to run around. It&#039;s weird, I feel energetic yet relaxed simultaneously, the experience feels really balanced. This is almost zen like.

				i apologize but Tor is kinda hit or miss for me today, the forums aren&#039;t always loading for me which is interfering with the live nature of this trip report. however i will continue record my findings on Notepad so i won&#039;t miss a beat.

				T+ 1:33 My scalp feels tingly, as if it has shrunk around my skull. I get the same effect when I take 48mg of ephedrine. I find my self scratching my head alot which feels good whenever I do it. Checked my pupils and they aren&#039;t dilated. I could see this substance being taken in a public setting with no problem. There are no real external indicators that I have consumed a psychoactive substance. The experience is quite controllable. This would be a great drug for someone like a party host who needs to interact and entertain everyone. No one is home right now and describing my experience is enjoyable. There isn&#039;t really any push or urge to be chatty but I feel really articulate right now and conversation would be very fluid and easy. I see potential for this substance in helping those with social anxiety. I am experiencing mild jaw tension right now. Going to get some gum.

				T+ 2:00 It feels good to breathe, just like it would on MDMA. The minty-ness of the gum feels good in my throat and bronchial tubes as I inhale through my mouth. I don&#039;t really feel like I peaked. Then again I have somewhat of a tolerance to Adderall. The euphoria seems to be coming down now and it was fairly mild at best. I feel like I only reached a ++ on the Shuglin scale. Jaw tension is moderate, I am chewing this gum quite vigorously. I had to pause the movie and see how music is on this substance. It&#039;s quite nice. Seems to trigger the energy in me. Dancing was fun. I think I&#039;m gonna go smoke a cigarette now.

				T+ 3:20 I walk around the garden while smoking a cigarette. The first few puffs taste a little nasty but that goes away as my mouth gets marinated with the flavor of the tobacco. It is cool outside and the air feels good on my skin. There is a sea of clovers which grew from the rains a few weeks back. I feel like a giant over looking a vast rainforest as I look at sea of clovers. Looking at all the green of the plants is quite serene and peaceful. This experience has been pretty calm all throughout, but I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s because I&#039;m experiencing it in a quiet setting. I feel that if I were to take this substance at a party that I would absorb the good vibes and energy around me and the experience would be more social, energetic, and fun. Not to say that what I&#039;m feeling right now isn&#039;t fun. I feel a bit of tension in my Latissimus dorsi and in between my shoulder blades. It&#039;s not unpleasant but it&#039;s there. I also realize that I&#039;ve used the word &quot;quite&quot; quite a bit during this experience. Heh heh. The bit of euphoria I felt earlier is going away. I would also like add that my nose got a bit runny a couple hours ago but that has stopped now.

				T+ 4:00 The effects of the 4-FA are quite (there&#039;s that word again) unremarkable right now so I&#039;ve decided to bump 40mg of ketamine

				T+ 4:08 I taste the K drip and I am cruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuising. It&#039;s not as bitter as it usually is...with the gum in my mouth it tastes more sour. The K seems to have relaxed the tension in my Latissimus and I no longer have tension between my shoulder blades. I feel that there might be a synergy between the 4-FA and K but it could just be the K or maybe a placebo effect....

				T+ 4:24 I bump another 20mg of K. It seems that the 4-FA is somewhat blocking the dopey dissociative effect of the K. My shoulders feel loose like they usually do on K but I am still lucid, clearheaded, and solidly in touch with reality. It feels like I took a little puff of a nice sativa. The addition of K is making my palms slightly clammy.

				T+ 6:00 I know sooner or later someone is going to ask a sex related question regarding 4-FA so I decided to see if an erection is possible. After looking at some porn I have confirmed that it is possible to get an erection. Perhaps in the future I will research what sex is like on 4-FA. There might be a potential for it as a stamina enhancer due to the serotonergic effects. If it&#039;s anything like MDMA that means I could pound away without ejaculating.

				lol.....live trip reports!&nbsp; Yay for the Intarweb!<br /><br />So do you reckon you could do 4-FA as a casual &#039;alertness booster&#039;?&nbsp; I&#039;m taking Modafinil a fair bit at the moment and I love not getting that 3pm urge to sleep, but it&#039;s not really an energy booster for me, just an &#039;awakeness&#039; booster.<br /><br />Adderall is too damn expensive, although not having tried it it could be what I&#039;m looking for, I just don&#039;t know.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for something that&#039;s a nice upper, where I&#039;m given the urge to get out there and where the potential for new experiences seems actually worth having&nbsp; :)

				ive read in my recent research, and have had expected 4-fa sold as molly. in lower doses its a nice little pick-me-up. euphoric but not overwhelming and pupils didnt get enormous. it was nice though, felt so clean.
