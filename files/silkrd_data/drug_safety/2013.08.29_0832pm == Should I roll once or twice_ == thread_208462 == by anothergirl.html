				Background: I don&#039;t have access to drugs in my home country so I&#039;m doing a little &quot;drug tourism&quot; for a couple months. I&#039;ve done MDMA a couple of times before, the most recent of which was Aug. 7 (I suspect I accidentally did too much (300mg or maybe even 400mg over a night), which resulted in days of crying, depression, and compulsive dancing).<br /><br />On Sep. 30th, I have plans to do MDMA with a friend who has never done anything (except alcohol and coffee).<br /><br />Since I&#039;ll either have to buy a half or whole gram off SR, even the former of which will be more than enough for both of us, I&#039;ve considered doing some alone on the 10th or 11th as well, right after I arrive in the country.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m worried that it will ruin the second roll, and/or that the comedown period will negatively impact my experience with all the other stuff I plan to try over the course of the month (salvia, kratom, DMT, amanita muscaria, and handful of others).<br /><br />I&#039;d hate to throw the extra MDMA into the trash and miss out on the rare opportunity, but I&#039;d also hate to ruin my trip. Would I regret having a little mini-roll 18-20 days before my proper roll with my friend, or should I go for it?

				Roll 3-4 times a year with 2-3 months in between and you are more than okay.&nbsp; People will find ways to justify breaking this rule, like the other day my friend rolled 4 days in a row promising himself that he won&#039;t roll again the whole year.&nbsp; Seriously, MDMA is a loving drug and all, but you have to remember what it does to your body.&nbsp; It taxes the fuck out of it and there is a reason it should be considered an extra special treat only a couple times a year.

				Well, there&#039;s your first roll, and then there&#039;s every other roll.&nbsp; As for every other roll, you can binge a little and still get a good roll out of it.&nbsp; For me, I can roll two days in a row and still get a good experience.&nbsp; Two rolls in 18 days is fine, but don&#039;t make a habit out of it.<br /><br />Wonder if maybe 120-140 mg might be enough.&nbsp; Easy to say here and now, a little more difficult when you&#039;re out of your mind.&nbsp; All you have to do is be mindful.&nbsp; Just plan your trip.&nbsp; &quot;I&#039;m taking 100mg to start and will bump 40 in a couple of hours.&quot;&nbsp; If you think about it BEFORE you start tripping, it&#039;s not too hard to stick to the plan when things start to go all wiggly.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;re gonna be hung over after MDMA.&nbsp; Just think about the things you&#039;ve learned and ride it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll repeat that, in case you missed it.&nbsp; Think about the things you&#039;ve learned.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t throw the MDMA away!&nbsp; Jeez.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing more fun than making new friends.&nbsp; Give it away to people you meet who are deserving of something special.&nbsp; Just package it up in &quot;stamps&quot; or capsules or something and bring it with.&nbsp; It&#039;s&nbsp; a lovely gift.&nbsp; Look, it&#039;s fun to take MDMA and get all sweaty and dance your booty off.&nbsp; But wait until you&#039;ve experience the puppy pile.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; You think its beautiful to SEE a bunch of people lying on top of each other, stroking each other&#039;s hair... try being IN that pile.&nbsp; Exquisite.&nbsp;

				I think rolling once or twice is kinda meaningless with that big DMT in the middle of your list just staring down at everything else

				Ah, thinking back to my first roll...damn son brought a tear to me old rheumy eyes, ya dids.<br /><br />Look, 300mg in a 24hr period is not gonna kill you, just have your environment already set up, and go! Pre drop, though, I recommend dosing on some vitamins n stuff, namely a B complex, vitamin C, potassium and magnesium, possibly take a SSDI like Cymbalta, (that is a selective serotonin/dopamine reuptake inhibitor). <br /><br />Enjoy your cavorting!

				I&#039;m assuming there&#039;s an implicit suggestion that I go to a... club (?) or something.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been to a club or even a bar so I&#039;d be pretty out of my element, but I guess I could give it a shot.

				Well I think you need to be in an environment where people will be OK with you rolling your gonads off.&nbsp; In polite company, people could potentially mistake you for an insane person.&nbsp; <br /><br />I understand completely if you don&#039;t want to be involved in the whole alcohol scene.&nbsp; So I would focus on the music.<br /><br />One of the best MDMA experiences I ever had, occorred listening to a string quartet playing in a town square.&nbsp; Sitting there right next to them.&nbsp; Chatting them up.&nbsp; They played things for me, in response to my questions.&nbsp; &quot;How come it is, that things in a minor chord sound so sad?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Listen to this, and tell me what you think.&quot;&nbsp; There are no words, no words to tell how exquisite that was.<br /><br />So yeah.&nbsp; It&#039;s not club, or bar.&nbsp; It&#039;s music.&nbsp; Which, to be clear, is usually, but not always, in clubs, and bars.&nbsp; As long as it&#039;s interactive.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be in the pews, passively listening. <br /><br />
