				physical addition (as in you stop and your body freaks out) happens gradually and measurably. On a scale of 0 to 10 you might be a 1 there.<br /><br />But psychological addiction is a different animal. I tried C once years and years ago, physical addiction is clearly zero, yet I&#039;m glad that it is difficult to get and horrendously expensive because if given free access I&#039;d be hoovering it up like Tony Montana.<br /><br />Boredom just accelerates the process of turning a psychological addiction into a physical one.<br /><br />If you&#039;re posting here you&#039;re probably worried about your willpower so just stop using -- find something else to fill the time. Reading books helps. It makes the time fly and takes your mind off things. Cultivate some pot or something :)

				As far as I know, cocaine isn&#039;t physically addictive.&nbsp; However, if you are finding yourself justifying your use (&quot;I realize an addiction probley requires daily use so I dont think I am an addict (yet)&quot;) you may want to take another look at how you are treating the substance as it sounds like you are a bit uncomfortable with your usage, even if you haven&#039;t realized it yet.&nbsp; The only way to prevent addiction is to take regular breaks from using the substance.&nbsp; If you find yourself using out of boredom, or re-dosing to avoid a comedown, you have definitely hit an issue and should stop, but as it stands, you might be best off taking a week or two anyways.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to lose the magic. ;)

				Yeah, if you&#039;re looking for some secret method to continue using frequently and not becoming addicted... there isn&#039;t one, I&#039;m afraid. Or if there is one, I have yet to figure it out.&nbsp; :-\

				Cocaine is chemically addictive. The best solution is always to take a break. If you need to... change your environment for a while. Maybe go on holiday somewhere far from home.

				If you find your self constantly thinking about it when your not using, or shit even if you are using, your most probably mentaly addicted. seeing as how blow dont have physical addictions, its hard to realize youve gone over the edge before its too late. smoke lots of marijuana if your able to, it is sure to ease your cravings. goodluck my friend. stay safe

				Like another poster said, keep busy. If I didn&#039;t take 18 credits every semester I wouldn&#039;t know what to do with myself. I burn a lot of trees, but the only serious drug I use is my prescription to xanax (and I only take half the prescribed dosage). I haven&#039;t had blow in months, but I know how habit forming it can become.

				Well, most people seem to always figure it out too late...nobody &#039;thinks&#039; they&#039;re addicted until well past the point of no-return.&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;Normal&#039; people don&#039;t much think about it.&nbsp; If it&#039;s causing you problems, and you set out to do &#039;one&#039; thing (I&#039;m only going to do a little bit of coke tonight) and end up doing &#039;another&#039; (&#039;oh shit!, the suns coming up!&quot;)then you&#039;re getting there...but of course, as others have said, some are more prone to it than others, but hell, nobody I&#039;ve met has been very good at identifying it, and the whole &#039;disease&#039; concept never did sit right with me.&nbsp; As long as the shit&#039;s illegal, IMO, we&#039;ll never really know when it&#039;s addiction, and when it&#039;s just a pain in the ass....or heaven on earth....

				Like the others said, cocaine isn&#039;t physically addictive. I don&#039;t know if there are any sure signs to know if you&#039;re becoming addicted, but there is a point (and I think this might be yours) when every addict stops and thinks, &quot;Why am I doing this?&quot;. I remember when it happened to me as if it had been today. You begin to doubt yourself and think, &quot;Why am I so weak-willed when it comes to drugs?&quot; but that&#039;s not it at all. The truth is, people with exceptionally strong will-power are more likely to become addicted. Your will to do drugs is so strong, you begin to manipulate yourself into doing it as often as possible. You&#039;ll think of reasons and excuses and what&#039;s scary is they make absolute sense to you. It&#039;s a really difficult experience.<br />I think probably anyone can become addicted I guess, but people with mental disorders like depression, anxiety, ect. are more likely to become addicted. Most of us use drugs and react in the appropriate way, &quot;That was fun, now back to my life.&quot; But some of us use drugs and for whatever reason are unable to stop and return to our lives. Drug addicts have a problem in their brain that fucks with their natural instincts. While every human is programmed to survive by eating, sleeping, reproducing and protecting itself among many other instincts, when a drug addict becomes addicted, the drug moves to the very top of their list of priorities necessary for survival. Using the drug stops being something the person chooses to do and becomes something they are not instinctively inclined to do in order to survive.

				It&#039;s a bit of a misnomer to differentiate between physical and mental addiction.<br /><br />Drugs hijack the brain&#039;s pleasure / reward system. The very same system that encourages you to eat, love and play. In this sense, being drawn towards use is no different physiologically to being compelled to, say, eat or overeat. <br /><br />Cocaine is particularly &quot;morish&quot; as you you know because of it&#039;s effect on your dopamine (reward) neurotransmitters. So really, this is physical and, it is also mental. <br /><br />It&#039;s not helpful to try to measure your level of addiction on some kind of sliding scale, and try to identify the &quot;point&quot; where you are officially, capital A, addicted. You know your own levels of self control, and they will be different to other peoples. <br /><br />Instead, try to judge at what point your use starts to do harm to yourself and/or others. Coke nose, financial drain, social withdrawal or interpersonal difficulties because of your use are all factors. You can&#039;t take cocaine forever, and hopefully you can recognise when the fun stops and the harm begins. <br /><br />Take care! <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I agree with a lot of the guys on here.<br /><br />Coke, which I have lots of experience with, can get you psychologically addicted in a heart beat. The fact you&#039;ve been doing this every week for as long as you have is the first sign that you&#039;re probably psychologically addicted. To confirm, just stop doing blow for a month.<br /><br />If you crave it, you&#039;re psychologically addicted.<br /><br />I deal with my addiction by stopping the habit completely for a few months (three to six months). And i&#039;m always constantly aware of what my mind is trying to convince me of when it comes to consumption.

				Cocaine is not a physically addictive substance , you hit the nail on the head when you said that you tend to think of using when your bored , not sure where you are or your circumstances but a few sessions of CBT might help I reckon a max of 5 or 6 CBT is like re wiring the messages and looks at triggers for using . A great resource which you can use at home is on http://www.saolproject.ie/cocaineresources.php. The term addiction is used too frequently , watch out if its having a impact on you psychologically or your social environment . You dont mention if your drinking when using coke , the two can be interlinked. Hope this helps DM me if you wish&nbsp;
