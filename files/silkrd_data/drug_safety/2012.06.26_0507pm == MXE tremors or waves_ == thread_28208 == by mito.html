				Sometimes when I&#039;m trying to fall asleep many hours after doing MXE I feel these waves through my body.&nbsp; It&#039;s sporadic but it happens.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;it&#039;s kind of weird, I&#039;m not sure they are tremors or what.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are very subtle, but I can feel them.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I can&#039;t identify exactly what they are, but they appear to travel along my body.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Anyone experiencing this too?<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve experienced this on several different drugs and always experienced a sort of &quot;pulse&quot; or surge of energy go through my body. I finally asked a doctor and he said that it *could* just be my brain &quot;rewiring&quot; itself so to say, but it was nothing serious. I looked online and noticed people had the same exact feeling and one person suggested to take a b-12 complex vitamin so I have started taking them and it went away, maybe it&#039;ll go away for you too&nbsp; ;)

I don&#039;t have a good diet in terms of getting all of my vitamins so I think that was my problem so not sure what yours could be but from what I&#039;ve gather online it&#039;s nothing serious to your health. You could always get an MRI done and see if anything is going on but I got one done and they told me it was nothing, I would normally get it after a night of binge drinking or psychedelics (sometimes with MDMA).

				Also, what the fuck is with MXE and tinnitus.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been sober on MXE for almost 4 months and tinnitus was still there, though not intense.<br /><br />Is it some chemical causing this in my eardrums?<br />

				It feels like my body is moving or floating while I&#039;m lying or sitting down on relatively high doses.&nbsp; For clarification, it seems like a light vacuum sucking on my body, trying to pull me into a black hole.

				That sucks :( I only get tinnitus with binges while I am on it, and any odd things stop in 3 days for me. Was going hard everyday for a bit months ago and I stopped cold turkey and felt a little odd for 3 days..&nbsp;

I have mild tinnitus from playing in very, very loud jazz big bands all my life.&nbsp; On ketamine, the tinnitus doesn&#039;t act up, but it&#039;s a more of ringing &quot;drum-roll&quot; type of thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been meaning to try MXE for the first time, but now i&#039;m scared it might make my tinnitus ringing a bit too intense...
