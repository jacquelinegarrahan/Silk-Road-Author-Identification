				Anyone have any insight on this..<br /><br />i was big on working out, and meth totally shedded my muscles and everything i owned (not literally) but it killed my muscles.<br /><br />so not i&#039;m on anabolics (not steroids) , and it helps the muscles, but would it make a difference if i did H after my workouts ?<br />i&#039;m getting the necessary nutrients/protein per day<br /><br />also i heard opiates slow down your metabolism?<br /><br />or any for that matter any topics or subjects concerning: <br />1. Opiates and muscle growth<br />2. Opiates and metabolism rate

				I haven&#039;t done any research on your last 2 questions, but I can say a little from personal experience. I&#039;ve been doing opiates for about 5 and a half years, and during most of that time, I would work out/play sports regularly, and the opiates didn&#039;t affect me negatively all that much. It was only when I got really addicted to H and stopped working out or being active altogether that I gained a bit of weight, but my muscle mass wasn&#039;t affected that much. I just accumulated fat on top of the muscle that I already had. So I think as long as you continue to work out, regardless of how often and/or when you do opiates, it probably wont affect you negatively all that much. I would still advise you to do your best to keep your opiate use in check, because it&#039;s very easy to let them control you. Keep it to once or twice a week at most if you can.

				Sounds like we have a bit in common. I used to play sports at a relatively high level, and my opiate issues threw that right out the window. Best of luck to you man!

				opiates will ruin your bodybuidling hands down. 1- your taking something taht will mess with your apetite. bodybuilding takes extreme control with diet for optimal results. 2- it will effect your liver enzymes. 3- it will effect focus and drive. 4- it will effect bowel movements. If you are taking in mass quantities of nutrients those not used will need to be excreted through wasted. this is only the tip of the ice berg. i know many whose b-building carrears were eithe cut short or ended due to opiate use. i would reccomend stearing clearing or if you can get away with smoking but its a much better alternative. feel free to pm me in private for more. The two simply will destroy your gains.

				first heroin and opiates is not tha different, well heroin would be more like diamorphine with unknown crap but anyways from personal experience you feel like you have alot of strenght and energy but your muscles are relaxed and it just doesn&#039;t work as you expect it.

I did more cardio than anything, and when I lifted, I would do lower weight + more reps to focus on maintaining lean muscle mass rather than increasing it significantly.

				From personal experience I can tell you chronic opioid use can cause central hypogonadism, i.e., low T.<br /><br />Something to do with effecting prolactin levels in the brain.<br /><br />Google opioid hypogonadism for the details.

If i suffered any more muscle mass losses, i would probably end up down the steroid path.

As i was high as shit on H last night, i wondered, why the bloat, it&#039;s not because of my estrogen or estradiol levels being up. it&#039;s because my metabolism and bowel movements weren&#039;t regular and normal. this is only one thing that as a nutrient patritoner and bulker would not be good. I would never consider heading to the gym high, as it would never work out and i could see it definitely fucking up my workout and isolated movements. + the fact that the increased risk of getting hurt is put into play.<br /><br />I&#039;m general speaking as a short-term kind of opiate deal. i&#039;ve already let a substance lead me down a path that i never thought was possible. fixed it on my own, and now know the differences.<br /><br />i can see how abusing opiates would totally wreck your gains as any other substance i would suppose. i&#039;ll PM you in a bit about this though, would definitely like to get more in depth with a bodybuilding aspect twist to it for sure. i like the way you broke it down though<br /><br />+1 to you good sir<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=134127.msg912980#msg912980">Quote from: grdr on March 18, 2013, 08:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">first heroin and opiates is not tha different, well heroin would be more like diamorphine with unknown crap but anyways from personal experience you feel like you have alot of strenght and energy but your muscles are relaxed and it just doesn&#039;t work as you expect it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yes i mean after i got back from my workout(which was gruelling as always) and totally wrecked the weights , actually kicked through plateaus and everything. i got my regular bowel movements in , ate some carbs, got some cornbeef and potatoes in, and some protein. then quite some time after this i did a line of H (maybe 20mg or less) . <br />

				tocadisco, I&#039;m sorry for my misdirection. While were both athletes one way or another, my area of expertise and level/length of opiate use is obviously too far removed from what it would have to be in order for me to make judgements about your fitness goals. Like I sort of implied, I hadn&#039;t done any research, and like I said, I was just relaying my own experience. I still find it hard to believe that &quot;very&quot; occasional use wouldn&#039;t have much of a negative impact on anything, I obviously underestimated the effects of chronic opiate use on bodybuilding. When I have time I really want to do some formal research on this, but until then, I&#039;m just going to shut up and listen. :)
