				sure h will take away from the speed but less euphoria is dependant on the person. <br />it will take some of the speed edge off and maybe prevent the need to redose<br />let us know.. never took h while on meph

				I&#039;ve never done H and drone specifically but I&#039;ve done strong pharmaceutical opiates and stimulants (mostly speed, sometimes ritalin) the day after.. The euphoria from the stimulant isn&#039;t lessened in my experience if you did an opiate the day before. What can happen is that the stimulant is smoother if you have some after-effects from the opiate but that&#039;s it. Stimulants and opiates work on completely different mechanisms so there shouldn&#039;t be any effect like that.<br />From my experience and in theory, the mephedrone should only be affected by the afterglow/hangover. From what I&#039;ve heard it should mostly be a hangover than afterglow with H so it may not be as enjoyable. If you have no hangover then it won&#039;t be affected at all, there shouldn&#039;t be any cross-tolerance but I may be missing something. Maybe the H depletes your dopamine a little so you&#039;ll need more mephedrone but in my experience that sort of thing doesn&#039;t happen. Taking both at the same time or taking H during the mephedrone comedown should be highly enjoyable though.

Maybe I said that because I&#039;ve tried softer stimulants and softer opiates than mephedrone and heroin and never noticed bad effects or addiction. I guess it&#039;s different with stronger ones. Taking an opiate during a stimulant comedown saved me from binges several times though so sometimes it&#039;s better to mix them than not I guess.

				My guess:<br /><br />If you are not using a lot of H I wouldn&#039;t worry. If you are a habitual H user then I defo wouldn&#039;t worry. Just take in increments.
