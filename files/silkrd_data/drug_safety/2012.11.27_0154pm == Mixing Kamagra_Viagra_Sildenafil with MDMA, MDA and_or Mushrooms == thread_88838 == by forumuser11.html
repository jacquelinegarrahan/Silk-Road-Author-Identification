				Hello all.&nbsp; Anticipating getting my hands on some Kamagra shortly.&nbsp; Though I have never taken Kamagra before (I have no impotency issues), I am experienced with MDMA, MDA and mushrooms.&nbsp; As I’m sure some of you have experienced, using MDMA or MDA can make it difficult to get an erection.&nbsp; <br /><br />I’m wondering, does anyone have any experience mixing Kamagra/Viagra with any of the other drugs I mentioned?&nbsp; My girlfriend and I are hoping to enhance our experience… <br /><br />Other than staying within the recommended dose of Sildenafil (25-50mg), is there anything I need to be aware of?&nbsp; I’m not planning on mixing mushrooms with MDMA or MDA, but most likely MDA with MDMA.<br /><br />Since I mentioned it... any comment on mixing mushrooms with MDMA or MDA?

				Hi, forumuser11 (nice anonymity with the user name there ;)),<br /><br />We don&#039;t have any experience with &quot;Sextacy,&quot; but have heard lots of stories of people doing it with no problems.&nbsp; Thought we&#039;d mention that patient oral stimulation can also go a long way in getting things going on an E, heh.<br /><br />Probably can&#039;t go wrong with MDA+MDMA!&nbsp; General consensus seems to be to keep the ratio higher on the molly side.<br /><br />And we do have experience with MDA+Mushrooms and highly recommend the combination, especially if you&#039;re looking for a longer-duration (possibly full-day) trip.&nbsp; They seem to synergize in a way that just keeps going and going and going, lol.<br /><br />Good travels to you and your girl!

				Hi!°<br />Had a similar topic some time ago on this forum...<br />and my BF the same problem as u&nbsp; ;)<br />We ordered some Kamagra...and tada it all went fine!<br />No problem whatsoever!!!<br />We didn´t use pure mdma but some Skulls (310g) from XTCExpress...<br />He took a quater of the Kamagra and half of the Skull..worked wonders ...looolll<br />As for use: he took the kamagra first and the some 20 minutes late the xtc pill....<br />So no worries ;-) Wish u lots of fun ;-)
