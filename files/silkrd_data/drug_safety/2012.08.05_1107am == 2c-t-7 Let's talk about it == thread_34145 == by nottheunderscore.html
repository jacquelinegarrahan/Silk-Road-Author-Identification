				I&#039;d like anyone who has tried 2c-t-7 to write their trip reports or thoughts on the chemical.&nbsp; Dosage recommendations, I think we all know not to snort it or try and smoke it.&nbsp;

				Erowid is gonna be your friend on this one. I&#039;ve tried it once, recently actually, but I can&#039;t write an entire trip report now. Dosage, ROA, etc. should all be on Erowid though. But one thing, it&#039;s not a chemical to mess around with. Don&#039;t take it lightly. If you&#039;re prepared and ready for it, you&#039;re in for a ride,and although it might not be the smoothest trip, it was very insightful for me.

				I started a thread about this earlier: I had some 2c-t-7 for sale and took it a couple times in the name of science. Anyway, here are some of my observations.<br /><br />2c-t-7 is a very idiosyncratic compound. Two people can have wildly different reactions to an equal size dose - and the same dose can have wildly different results on the same person in a different set and setting.&nbsp; I also find it to be one of the more introspective 2c-*s.&nbsp; Although it got its start as a party drug, I find 2c-t-7 makes me very introverted: it has none of the social and erotic quality of 2c-b.&nbsp; The trip is great but it sends you looking inward rather than outward.&nbsp; <br /><br />People have called 2c-b a cross between MDMA and LSD.&nbsp; 2c-t-7 is much more LSD-like than b.&nbsp; It has fantastic open-eye and closed-eye visuals -- some of the best I&#039;ve ever experienced on any psychedelic.&nbsp; It also improves the sound of music very nicely: I can see where some people might enjoy it at a rave or a festival.&nbsp; I did find it had a noticeably higher body load than 2c-b: where b gives me warm fuzzies t-7 gives me lingering cold chills and faint cramps. These aren&#039;t necessarily a deal-breaker but they are something to keep in mind when dosing.&nbsp; t-7 has a pretty steep dosage/response curve, and taking more might increase the icky feeling without improving the good parts. (It may also extend the length: I&#039;ve found that 2c-t-7 lasts considerably longer than b, sending me on a 6-8 hour trip).<br /><br />2c-t-7 is notorious for causing some deaths. Like syrian rue and b. caapi, 2c-t-7 inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidase.&nbsp; While this is a good thing when you&#039;re doing ayahuasca, it&#039;s a Very Bad Thing when mixed with certain classes of drugs. Combined with SSRIs, stimulants and other drugs that act on serotonin -- including MDMA -- MAO inhibitors can cause all kinds of nasty complications.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when t-7 was sold as &quot;Blue Mystic&quot; many people took it with Ecstasy, thinking the combination would be as lovely as an MDMA/2c-b honeyflip.&nbsp; Others tried snorting it with tragic results.&nbsp; So long as you avoid insufflation and combining it with MDMA, M1, amphetamine or cathiones like mephedrone, flephedrone, etceteradrone, &amp;c. you should be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />While I had some good experiences with vaporizing, I suspect that vaping can cause the same kind of rapid MAO inhibition as snorting and would advise sticking to oral or rectal usage for this one.&nbsp; Start with 10mg or so and see what happens.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t get satisfactory results at 25-30mg I&#039;d say you might want to think before going higher: you may get more unpleasantness rather than a better trip. <br /><br />Overall I&#039;d say this one is best for intermediate to advanced psychonauts, but it is definitely a worthwhile substance and certainly deserving of its place in Shulgin&#039;s &quot;magical half-dozen.&quot;

				Thank you guys for giving some advice on the matter.&nbsp; :P<br />I have read at least 15 trip reports and a lot of the literature about it on Erowid, however one of the problems with RC&#039;s is finding the right dosage.&nbsp; <br />I have generally gone off Erowid&#039;s recommendations in the past but I recently bought some 2c-i off of an SR vendor with a near perfect rating and I had to dose quite a bit more than the strong dose rec. to get a strong trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />I usually would take between 40-50mg of 2ci, but this time had to take 75mg.&nbsp; Perhaps it was cut just a smidgeon?&nbsp; Has anyone here tried Nevita&#039;s 2c-t-7?&nbsp; If so, would they recommend 25-30mg for a strong trip, or more?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m 180lbs.&nbsp; experienced psychonaut.&nbsp;

				2ct7 is absolutely amazing. i love it. i have done 18mg and 22mg and the difference was huge. 18mg was manageable but 22mg was bliss. i saw visions not visuals. pyramids with the eye, snakes in a pitch black room, and i love the body high. feels like there is a force moving all over you and it feels good. great trails and fun colors as well. lasted quite a while which was a plus for me.

				So, I took 37 mg of 2ct7 and that was a bit too much.&nbsp; I spent most of the night puking, and it was not the most fun trip.&nbsp; I&#039;m 180lbs, and an experienced tripper, but if I were to try it again, I would take no more than 30mg.&nbsp; 27mg was perfect for the girl I was with.&nbsp; She&#039;s about 125lbs or so, but an experienced tripper.&nbsp; She only puked once, but was having an amazing time the whole time.&nbsp; ;D
