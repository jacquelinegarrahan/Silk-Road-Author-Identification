				Well the 110mg MDMA roll was starting to gently taper off after a lovely couple of hours so I decided to try 2C-B for the first time. I was alone in my room after midnight but there were others in the house sleeping peacefully in the other rooms. <br /><br />My new scales weren&#039;t accurate enough, only two decimal places and kinda shitty, so I&#039;m pretty sure the dose was somewhere between 15mg and 35mg. Little did I comprehend the gravity of this margin of error for 2C-B. <br /><br />There I was, writing an email when it started to hit me. I couldn&#039;t focus on the letters on the screen properly and the black letters on the screen were starting to wave and pulsate. I shook my head and snapped out of it and looked down at the keyboard. The keys were color shifting, like the R/G/B was shifting out of focus. <br /><br />It was nice and the MDMA definitely had a calming effect, but as I looked around the room and saw that everything was moving, I realized this was going to get more intense and less controllable. I shook my head again and tried to snap back to reality, which I could do for a second or two. I quickly cleaned up the room as best I could in case I lost all control, and hid the scales, packet etc. <br /><br />I looked at the clock and saw I had a few hours until sunrise, maybe I could ride it out quietly and sneak back into bed in the other room? I slumped back in the chair and closed my eyes. Within seconds I was in GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKING OUTER SPACE. The audio hallucinations were amazing. Drone like flanges warped and pulsated in a shifting rhythm. Underwater beats from nowhere. When I shook my head to snap out I realized all I could hear was traffic in the distance. Close my eyes again, INTERGALACTIC MOTHER FUCKING SPACE WAR! Jesus christ, I thought. Don&#039;t close your eyes. <br /><br />I loaded up a good looking naked lady onto my monitor. 2C-B is a good sexy time drug, they said. Well for a JPEG she certainly was an animated young woman. Just beautiful. Her hair was flowing right in front of me. But try as I might to arouse myself to an ecstatic end, the smallest JPEG artefacts were growing into detailed Aztec hieroglyphs that covered her whole body and wouldn&#039;t go away without me trying to snap back to reality again. Little flashes of light and falling stars were happening around the room too. <br /><br />It was coming on harder and harder. If I didn&#039;t do something soon my girlfriend was going to find me in the morning drooling and smiling in the corner .. or something like that, I imagined. As wonderful as this was.. I had to pull the Xanax parachute before I was incapable of putting my hand around the rip cord. <br /><br />I swallowed half a bar and sat back into the visual vortex. Open eye, closed eye - It didn&#039;t really matter now. Everything was moving. It was different to my experiences with LSD where my visuals where always very symmetrical and never as auditory. This was the whole deal, and the visuals were much more detailed, kinetic and, well, beautiful.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ve never had enough before to compare them. Apart from panicking about waking up the house or being found tripping my ass off, I&#039;d do it again for sure. I definitely took a dose closer to 30mg and it was powerful. I&#039;d heard a lot about how &quot;gentle&quot; 2C-B is as a psychedelic, but that wasn&#039;t my experience at all, it was quite intense.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I slid into bed quietly I couldn&#039;t even work out the sheets properly. It felt like I was lying in warm sand so I just lay as still as I could and waited for the Xanax to do it&#039;s thing. I woke up the next day with a pretty mild headache but otherwise fine. <br /><br />My advice - get your dose right with 0.001 digital scales that work and do it somewhere you can fully enjoy it in private and/or with sympathetic copilots. Also bring Xanax. Just in case. <br /><br />

				Well it is a mild psychedelic... on its own. In dosages of probably 15-20. Once you get past that threshold the difference between 20 and 30 mgs of 2CB is quite wild. And you were also coming off a roll, so the trip would have been wholly intense.<br /><br />I wish you hadn&#039;t taken that Xanax!

				I had my first 2CB experience a couple days ago after i took some mdma, as the MDMA started to wear off, we all sorted 13MG each, equivalent to about 22MG if we had taken it orally. (wish i had taken it orally). But the trip was very nice, started off with colour changes and rushing sounds, flowed by amazing CEV&#039;s and beautiful, but once scary OEV&#039;s when I went into the dark. I remember seeing deers and birds running around in front of me and i really felt the presence, it made me feel at one with nature if you like. At one point in the trip though i looked up into a tree and a massive, scary as fuck clown appeared out of no where which made me shit my pants a little, but i was easily able to come out of it. It also made us all extremely chatty!<br />Overall it was my best drug experience to date. Sounds like you had a pretty intense trip my friend, probably took over 30mg+!
