				Hi All,<br /><br />Purchased a few tabs for what seems to be a reputable Australian vendor on here (don&#039;t want to reveal name yet as don&#039;t want to tarnish his rep at all just yet).<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried 25i NBOMe , only thing I&#039;ve ever tried befoere is some shrooms which I must say was that greatest experience ever.<br /><br />So my order arrived yesterday (1 day delivery time!), popped one tab (1000ug dose as per vendors description) at about 8:15pm, placed it on the upper part of my gum between teeth and front of mouth (also as per vendors info), let it sit there for ~ 15mins. Took tab out and put it aside, waited around 1 hour and nothing.... Put tab back in for at least a further 30-45mins until the thing basically disintegrated in my mouth - still nothing. Didn&#039;t feel a tad anxious and nauseous, palms a tad sweaty but that whats it. No visuals at all - nothing,.<br /><br />Went to bed at 11:30pm and asleep by 12. Severely dissapointed.<br /><br />Lucky for me I ordered some extras - I was tempted to put another one in last night but thought best be safe and only try one. <br /><br />What do I do? Try another one tonight? I&#039;m quite depressed about not experiencing anything at all haha. Surely 1 tab of 1000ug is enough for me? Only weigh ~ 86kg, muscular build, 5ft9ish, and never tried before or done lsd/acid etc. anything like that....<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreicated.<br /><br />Loving this community!

				Oh, I did feel a slight numbness sensation in my mouth / chemical sort of tase, which didn&#039;t dissapear after having a drink - I&#039;m told this is something you should expect to happen...<br /><br />I also ensured the picture side of the tab was the side facing my gum.

				I don&#039;t know much about 25I (not sure that anyone does considering human use dates only to 2010) but I believe it works on our 5HTP-2 receptors, making my first question:<br /><br />Are you taking any perscription medication? Specifically antidepressents, SSRIs etc.

				Nope, I had the same result from a 1000ug blotter from a local.&nbsp; Very mild distortion visuals, waves of nausea, nice case of the shits, and that was about it.&nbsp; It was a tester freebee so I can&#039;t complain, but it&#039;s not exactly making me want to come back for more.<br /><br />In my next order I&#039;m going to try some of Tylerdurden&#039;s snortable n-bombs.<br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;ll just assume my brain is broken ;)

				I don&#039;t know why it wouldn&#039;t work considering you put it in the second time, if you do try it again it goes between your gums and upper lip, not your teeth, but you should still have had some effect regardless. Everyone seems to have their own slight variances on how to take them (length of time, to swallow saliva or not, etc) but I&#039;ve tripped several times now on kwiktrips and I&#039;m on the opposite end of the spectrum where I get very intense visuals that rival anything I&#039;ve seen on high doses of LSD, and I&#039;m loving nbome because of it.<br /><br />How I take it is put a few tabs (3x 550ug tabs followed by another 3 an hour later is my preferred dosage) between my upper lip and gums, and just to make sure I&#039;m getting it all I leave it in my mouth for a full hour. I try not to swallow my saliva, slightly difficult while I&#039;m thinking about it for the first 15 minutes or so but after that it becomes quite easy and my mouth is filled with saliva by about the 40 minute mark. At the full hour mark I swallow the saliva, chew the tabs a bit then spit those out and enjoy the color light show.

				Ok 2nd attempt at it tonight - this time 2xtabs<br /><br />In at 9:30 and still in now (current time 12:13am). Sitting right up there in the gum, front of my mouth feeling weird as all fk because it&#039;s been there this entire time. I&#039;ve been going about normal things, swallowing salvia sub-consciously etc. although not drinking any fluids. and yet nothing...<br /><br />slight chemical taste in the mouth, palms a tad sweaty, wouldn&#039;t say I don&#039;t feel ANYTHING at all - feel a tad off the mark but thats it. In terms of going about my daily business i&quot;m fine, could present something to a bunch of work colleagues right this moment... quite disappointing.<br /><br />*note - currently on zero medicines at all.

				Give it an hour in there, after about 1h20m you don&#039;t feel anything, I tend to get warm cozy feeling throughout my body, then somethings wrong with it. If you can look at your cell phone and the letters or icons aren&#039;t dancing around then I&#039;d say it&#039;s not working.

				Have you taken psychedelics recently? 25I is cross-tolerant with LSD, shrooms, 2C-x and every 5-HT2 agonist. This is the plot I use to determine tolerance: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/479297-The-Big-amp-Dandy-LSD-amp-Shroom-Tolerance-FAQ-and-Discussion-Thread<br /><br />I gave a 1mg tab to AFOAF, he took it correctly but didn&#039;t feel anything. He wasn&#039;t on medications, LSD worked great for him, and he hadn&#039;t taken psychs recently. I still can&#039;t explain it. Maybe some people are immune to 25I? That&#039;s sad :/

				Well I tried 1 tab on Wed night and felt nothing, so did the 2 tabs on Thu night - apparently after trying it once your body builds a tolerance, and you should wait at least 1 week before trying it again? <br /><br />I could use the computer/phone perfectly fine without any altered vision.<br /><br />Time to give it a week and try again 2-3 tabs straight up I think.

				Just to add, I also read somewhere that if you dry out the spot of your gums you plan to place the tab, and sort of scratch it a little with your fingernails, then place the tab there it should absorb better.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Worth a shot, next time you try it!<br />1mg to me seemed like a good threshold/starting point. I had slight melting/wavy effects, brighter colors, good body buzz, with good energy.

				i think i read that you should keep the tab there for at least 30 minutes even better 45 and not swallow any saliva. swallow the saliva afterwards. it worked well for me!<br />i cannot imagine (without any remarkable tolerance) that you would feel hardly anything, that stuff is potent!

				Even with tolerance you should have still had effects. It&#039;s not like a drug where you and your friends sit around asking each other, &quot;Do you feel anything?&quot; It&#039;s more like, &quot;Oh shit, come here and stare at this!&quot;
