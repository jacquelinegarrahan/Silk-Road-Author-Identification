				neurotoxicity from MDMA is doubled when mixed with any form of amphetamine. MDMA is a serotonin antagonist and the neurotoxicity is achieved by your body trying to replace the empty serotonin deposits with dopmaine. This creates free radicals, hence the neurotoxicity. Amphetamines are a dopamine antagonist, and you are just dumping more dopamine into those empty serotonin deposits. The comedown will be horrific to say the least. Be smart and keep your drugs for seperate days. unless, ketamine and mdma were on the list for the evening.

				if you want to view it that way, then all illegal drugs are not safe. The dose is in the poison, and most drugs can be enjoyed responsibly.

				Beyond issues of purity, the other most common reason for negative drug side effects is very likely drug interactions. Literally drugs can piggyback on each other in what is known as a synergistic reaction, producing an overdose.<br /><br />Even with regular over the counter drugs, many people die every year from the affects of drug interactions, especially in hospital surgery, even with trained staff on call. So, it&#039;s not exactly like mixing cola and vodka.<br /><br />You should only ingest 1 substance at a time unless you&#039;re sure drug interaction is unlikely. You don&#039;t need to get paranoid, but if you&#039;re taking two completely new little white pills you should be reading the label on both. Often they will say something like: don&#039;t take this drug with SSRIs or something similar, so if you were taking something similar to zoloft, citalopram or some new prozac, then it is going to be a problem e.g. super headaches or mood swings. But don&#039;t worry about your orange juice so much.<br /><br />As it is, mixing two amphetamine class drugs could produce overly speedy side effects unless you study the pharmacology of both drugs. Since that isn&#039;t trivial, it is best to avoid the idea entirely and take 1 at a time. Besides which, MDMA and regular amphetamine don&#039;t exactly have the same effects on a person anyway. You want to be ecstatically pleased and friendly, but also concentrate intensely? Amphetamine is a work drug, not a pleasure drug, I don&#039;t really get why you&#039;d want to mix the two.<br /><br />IMHO, alcohol is often a very complex drug and although I don&#039;t have the numbers, I would agree that mixing alcohol and anything else is not a great idea. I don&#039;t suggest you stop drinking beer or something at a party, but you ought to be reaching for the becks instead of the bud when you take an tablet.

MDMA (taken all by its lonesome at 100mg - 200mg a dose per 5 - 8 hours) is safer than aspirin. Seriously, more people have ODed on aspirin than MDMA. People have actually tried to suicide by taking too much MDMA, and, uh, it didn&#039;t work very well... If anything MDMA saves lives in those cases :D<br /><br />There was even a guy who took 40,000 + MDMA tablets in nine years.<br /><br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/apr/04/drugsandalcohol.drugs1<br /><br />I mean, given the not infrequent lack of actual MDMA and abundance of complete shit in some of these tablets on the street, it&#039;s a wonder he&#039;s alive at all. He should have died from the side affects alone of all the other junk in the street E pills by taking 12 Ecstasy tablets per day, every day, never mind the actual MDMA!!<br /><br />As it is, he suffers from some bad memory problems, but is quite alive. <br /><br />Protip: if you take 12 tablets per day, everyday, of anything in your medicine cabinet, expect to die.

				I tend to avoid drug cocktails other than (any drug) + cannabis.

				In the early clubbing days we didnt know what was in them (pills) and probably 20 on might still be a mix of mdma plus the rest of amphet family in there, which we now recognise thru experience and taking significant of each elements to know how to recognise them which would otherwise have just been a Mitsi or other...<br /><br />so we all question what we&#039;re actually taking in, but you dont have much choice if its in pill form, otherwise a bit of speed gives you legs.<br /><br />Enjoy<br />TWM<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve experimented with mixing them, it&#039;s not the healthiest thing to do and your heart gets beating pretty fast, it can be a little uncomfortable at times. But it&#039;s pretty fun, I enjoy mixing drugs. Do it carefully though, better to take too little amphetamine and just ride out the roll and try again next time than take too much.

				Mixed it many times - personally I&#039;ve found that takin amphetamine can stop you monging out in al all-body gurn in the corner if you&#039;ve hit the mandy hard...<br /><br />Don&#039;t expect to sleep easy afterwards though - and the comedown is harder and longer

				It&#039;s all about moderation and rotation. I mixed some really good mdma with some really good meth. I finally understand what &quot;suicide Tuesdays&quot; meant. I tried to kill myself because of it. Granted, that i didn&#039;t have anything for the crash and nothing to supplement. (I didn&#039;t have the right vitamins or any drugs to ease the comdedown.)<br /><br />So i can&#039;t stress this enough. Moderation (because if you use moderation you&#039;ll be able to get high more times, and not have as bad of a crash.) and rotation. (Since you rotated substances and saved one for another day. You get to get high another day and have something to look forward to.)
