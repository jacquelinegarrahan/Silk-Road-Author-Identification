				I&#039;m looking at these two products for a festival in the UK and was going to get about 15 doses of one to share with people I&#039;m camping with who have never taken any other drug before apart from weed. What would you guys recommend? What can I tell them to make sure they have a good time and don&#039;t worry too much about the effects or don&#039;t get dehydrated?<br /><br />Any advice is appreciated :) I was looking at 100mg pills for ecstasy and 20mg caps for 2C-B for dosage information.

				i would say MDMA. i like to be sociable and outgoing at a festival and x does that perfectly. 2cb is also a great drug but i enjoy it more at a home setting with close friends.

				i agree with our general spread on both<br /><br />but if you think&nbsp; about it, both our answers are right...as you say mdma is more sociable, it goes hand in hand with taking it first at the festival, when everyones energy is high <br /><br />then as it subsides (lets say you roll hard on a good festival, like i will be at electric zoo, 4-6 hours) the partys energy is high but more mellow, a general calmer setting exists, and as the molly comes down, u pop 20mg (give or take) of 2cb and have such a beautiful mellow, comfy, controllable awesomeness.....<br /><br />fuck it, heres the thing, if you havent tried out both yet....do molly.....if you already know how 2cb is ....do both...molly first....2cb 3-5 hours after the molly.<br /><br />cheers

				2c-b is much better for a multi-day festival. 2c-b is the quintessential festival drug.

				2cb doesn&#039;t really have a comedown in my experience.&nbsp; You feel fine and dandy afterwards. This would be great for a festival. If you wanted to combine them though, maybe you could time it so you&#039;re watching a really UP dance act or whatever, on molly,&nbsp; and then a more organic/tribal/psychedelic or downtempo act when the 2cb kicks in on the comedown! If you pulled this off it would probably be the ultimate perfect execution of a drug combo for noobs at a music festival!

				I can&#039;t really afford both but thanks for the advice guys! Any information is handy. I think I know some folks bringing molly so I&#039;ll just stock up on the 2C-B and take that :) the comedown sounds non-existent and it seems like it&#039;ll be more fun, especially with Foxy&#039;s glowing review of it.

				Hey,<br /><br />I went to a Festival a few weeks back and tried 2CB for the 1st time (got a 500mg order from Ivory), and I have to say it was a very pleasurable experience..... <br /><br />We&#039;d done MDMA on the Friday night, and had had a fantastic time, fuck all sleep so carried on throughout the day on Saturday few beers, few joints.... dropped a couple of pills (Chemical bros always spot on pills) and a bit of 2CB, and went to watch Orbital. Fuck me the lights &amp; sound just tend to come alive. The visuals are excellent, and this was only a small dose (eyballed doses I might add)<br /><br />Anyway, later on we head back to our van and drop more 2cb...fuck me....we took quite a bit but the visuals were intense so say the least. We watched the sun some up (in various colours)...seriously tripping. It was like you could control the clouds with your eyes (amongst seaguls leaving trails in the sky etc etc). A fantasic trip, but I reckon if we&#039;d have been in the thick of it tripping like that, we might have lost it&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Ive since done the remainder at home, watching HD MTV concerts and its fucking awsome....and not a whiff of a comedown!<br /><br />Enjoy, just watch the dose&#039;s, till you know you can handle it!

				If I had to chose only one, and your friends have never used psychedelics or ecstasy before, I would go with the MDMA over the 2C-B.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not everyone is going to have fun being in a public place on 2C-B, especially those taking their first psychedelic.&nbsp; I never met anyone who didn&#039;t have a great time during their first MDMA trip.&nbsp; Dose at around 0.75 mg per pound.
