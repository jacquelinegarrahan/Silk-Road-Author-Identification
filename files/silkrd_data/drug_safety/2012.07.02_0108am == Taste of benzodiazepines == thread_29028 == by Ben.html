				It&#039;s a bit of an odd subject, but i got into a discussion about the taste of certain benzo&#039;s when you chew down on the tablet. <br /><br />Personally, i find that diazepam has a bitter taste that takes some time to notice, oxazepam is tastes bitter quite quickly, and alprazolam has a very bitter taste after a relatively short period of time. These observations are with 10mg diazepam, 10 mg oxazepam and 1 mg alprazolam tablets. In comparison, i&#039;d say paracetamol (500 mg) tastes very bitter very quickly.<br /><br />Judging drugs by taste is perhaps rather silly to begin with, but would you agree it is possible to tell apart a 10 mg diazepam tablet from a 1 mg alprazolam just by the taste alone? This is, of course, assuming the fillers in the tablet have no (bitter) taste to them at all. <br /><br />

				I know Xanax has a distinct taste to it, but I doubt that I&#039;d&nbsp; be able to tell the difference between Xanax and another benzo. Maybe if I used that stuff all the time? However, I am pretty sure I could tell Xanax and, say, Percocet apart by taste. Not that I would ever rely on that for anything though.

				I&#039;ve never tried lorazepam. <br /><br />But a somewhat sweet taste could be caused by lactose, a very common filler in tablets - both legit and counterfeit. Lactose tastes about 1/5th as sweet as glucose, but still has a distinctly sweet taste to it when it comprises the majority the filler material. <br /><br />Lactose in tablets its not a bad thing though, its used to press tablets of all kinds of medicine because it compacts very nicely when pressed giving solid but not idiotically hard tablets.

				I guess its a bit subjective. Chewing down on a tablet of alprazolam gives me a pretty unpleasant bitter taste, but so does drinking a shot of gin ;)<br /><br />None of them are candy to the taste though. The thing i found most interesting is that it actually takes some time before diazepam presents its bitter tatse, while aprazolam tastes bitter within a few seconds of biting down on a tablet. <br /><br />I suppose the aversion to the bitter taste does go away with repeated use though, similar to &#039;learning to drink liquor&#039;.

				I just got some Xanax for the first time earlier today, and I bit down and was quite surprised by how strong the taste was.

				benzos are great for anxiety and just to chill out or for coming down from a trip..... thing is though for some reason when I take my kpins I get really sick to my stomach and start vomiting and gagging.&nbsp; It also kills my appetite which is odd because it makes most peeps hungry.&nbsp; But I can just take one after a meal.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be anxiety free but then start gagging its so disgusting I think it may be some type of allergy dont want to tell my doc because he might take me off and i have horrible anxiety

				I like to suck on a klonopin or an etizolam. I&#039;m going to have to chew on a lorazepam later and taste it now. I could definitely tell the difference between the benzos by taste at this point.

				I could not agree more.<br />&nbsp;Love the taste of a good diazepam.<br />&nbsp;The taste between good brands like &quot;&quot;Roche&quot;&quot; and some cheap generic diazepam is enourmus.<br />&nbsp;On the normal internet are the benzo&#039;s like diazepam much cheaper as on Silk Road. <br />I ordered e few weeks ago some cheap diazepam here on SR.<br />&nbsp;But I could taste that it was not the quality i am used to.<br />&nbsp;I did not like the taste of those. Normally I do love it. <br />The way the taste can still be in your throath even after a hour or so. <br />I love the way the taste keeps on hanging on.<br />&nbsp;But live goes on and that cup of coffee has to come too, sooner or later.<br />&nbsp;supper or diner, snacks etc.<br />&nbsp;But I take my time to enjoy the taste of Valium, and try everything to avoid to spoil the sweet taste by smoking or drinking or eating.<br />&nbsp;Anything!<br />Swallowing valium down, with water should be illegal by law, so to speak!<br /><br />My opinion, wasta<br /><br />

				Yes, diazepam is slightly bitter. Not like molly bitter, much less unpleasant. I like the consistency it turns to under the tongue, sort of like a fine melty sand. <br /><br />Ive only done valium and xanax sublingualy and the taste was similar.

				Its a common misconception. Substances like valium or xanax are so lipophyllic that they are absorbed only in the gut. Many people believe that chewing the tablets, or even dissolving them under the tongue would speed up onset of action considerably, but there is no pharmacological proof for this. The only way it would have an effect if the tablets were so solid that they would not fall apart in the stomach and need additional time to break down in the gut... but that is very unlikely since most tablets will readily fall apart if dropped in a glass of lukewarm water. <br /><br />I suppose there is a psychological aspect to it though -&nbsp; the act of chewing down on the tablet may settle your mind a bit before the medication actually starts to take effect.

				So why do they make sub-lingual dissolving klonopins of sucking or chewing a tablet doesn&#039;t increase the onset?

				Marketing, probably.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen sub-lingual loperamide marketed as a faster cure for diarrhea, while that claim has no basis in fact either. I suppose many people over-estimate how long it takes for a medication to enter the gut to be absorbed mostly. On an empty stomach this can be as fast as 15 minutes, perhaps half an hour if taken with a light meal.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The rapid onset of sub lingual administration stems mostly from opiates, which are generally more hydrophyllic and will be absorbed more quickly that way. As a rule of thumb i&#039;d say that something that cannot be effectively snorted will not benefit from chewing, sucking, or other methods to absorb it before the gut does its work.&nbsp;

				I myself don&#039;t like the taste of majority of benzos, but it is acceptable. But there is one exception and that&#039;s bromazepam (Lexaurin). It may be the filler, but the taste is really sweet. Too bad it&#039;s one of the non-euphoric, &quot;sleepy&quot; benzos. I also agree that letting them dissolve in my mouth rather than ingesting them gives an almost immediate effect. Not sure if placebo, but technically it gets in the bloodflow and the brain quicker this way.

And it is the benzo that tastes like that, no filler or anything. <br /><br />What do you consider an euphoric benzopiazepine? Clonazepam?

For example, xanax just puts me in a zombie-like state and I am very sleepy. Not to mention the amnesia that comes the next day. On the other hand, diazepam puts me in a very calm, happy state with very little to no sleepiness (in low doses) and that is why I like it. There is no euphoria like you would get with a huge release of dopamine or serotonin (meth, mdma, opiates etc.), but a certain &quot;happy feeling&quot; is noticeable.

				Yes, a mood lift is an accurate description of the feeling. I haven&#039;t had the chance to try&nbsp; clonazepam yet. I don&#039;t acquire benzos from SR, they are more expensive here than my local source. Especially clonazepam, which is quite rare on SR and is super-expensive IMO. <br />

				I think &#039;euphoric&#039; is a bit misplaced here, its not that any benzo&#039;s is going to give you an opiate-like ride. <br /><br />The main difference is usually described as being either hypnotic or anxiolytic. All benzodiazepines exhibit both qualities, but the ratio between them varies. <br /><br />Things like temazepam, nitrazepam or flutrinazepam are mostly considered hypnotic, and used to induce sleep. <br /><br />Alprazolam, oxazepam and such are more anxiolytic and hence prescribed for panic disorder, generalized anxiety and such, although ssri&#039;s have become the first choice medications for that over the last decade(s). <br /><br />Diazepam (and to some degree clonazepam) are in between. Used as a hypnotic that doesn&#039;t make too much of a difference as any anxiolytic side effects are not a problem, but the other way around its quite different. Things like alprazolam allow treatment of anxiety without continuous drowsiness: Tolerance for the hypnotic effects develops quite easily, but tolerance for the anxiolytic effects of alprazolam has not been demonstrated properly so far.
