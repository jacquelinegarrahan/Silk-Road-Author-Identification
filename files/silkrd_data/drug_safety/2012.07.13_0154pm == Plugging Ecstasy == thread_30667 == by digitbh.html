				Post by: <strong>digitbh</strong> on <strong>July 13, 2012, 01:54 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I have read a couple guides on plugging ecstasy. One guide recommends to crush your tablet and dissolve it in water and do it enema style. Others recommend plugging. I have no problem doing drugs rectally, it&#039;s been around forever. Suppositories and such. I&#039;d rather plug than do an enema. I don&#039;t want to risk any liquid coming out and staining chairs, clothing, and above all wasting the drug.<br /><br />My concern is that if I plug my tablet, won&#039;t it just sit about 1.5 inches up my ass (where the bulk of your veins are) for a while? To my understanding there are no natural lubricants or acids to dissolve the tablet there. Anybody have more knowledge on this, or any tips for plugging?<br /><br />Also, if I do choose to take my ecstasy rectally, is there a difference in length of trip? Do I need to reduce or increase my dosage than if I would have taken it orally? I&#039;ve been told that the trip is more intense as the veins in your ass go directly to your brain before hitting your kidneys, so no filtering and no time being eaten away by the acid in your stomach as well.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s a logic to popping it up you poo pipe, but I&#039;d agree that there are few benefits beyond a slightly (about 20%) better bioavailability. I&#039;d prefer to just take 20% more orally in that case.....

				From what I&#039;ve read, it hits stronger faster, and you need only 2/3 of your oral dosage. No idea about the length of trip, I&#039;ve seen conflicting reports. And you should just do enema (with oral syringe) - that ~1.5ml of water will be absorbed very fast, just lie on your side for a few minutes. I doubt leakage is realistic.<br /><br />If you decide to take xtc this way, please let us know the roll was, the more info the better!;)<br /><br />Stay safe.

With that being said all to often a bad bitch wants to shove some molly or a pill into her pussy or ass. The girls I know that do it definitely get fucked up out of their minds. In general most seem to say if its a pill put some lotion on it then if you have a condom put that on your finger and shove it up as far as you can into your ass or pussy. If its molly put the molly into toilet paper and roll the paper into a ball. Then put some lotion or lub on your fingers and shove the ball as far as you can up your ass or pussy. <br /><br />Use the same dose you would orally. From what I understand and have observed plugging isnt necessarily more intense, as my shit is gunna have you fucked up regardless of how&nbsp; you do it. But I do think it takes less. Or put it this way, I have known people that specifically tried plugging and doing oral doses that were the same with the intent of figuring out the difference in effects. Ultimately most people come to the conclusion that they hit thier mdma &quot;sweet spot&quot; with less MDMA when plugging VS oral.<br /><br />Just to keep it real, even though I dont like plugging I dont think its all that weird after seeing so many people do it. If I am at a party and a guy is plugging, its no big deal anyway because we make it clear that are parties are for straight people only, no offense but we will all be on XTC and we dont need that kinda bullshit around. So plugging is no big deal guys and girls do it its just a way of getting high.

				I mean, if I decided to do it that way hypothetically, I&#039;m not worried that I&#039;ll start playing for the other team or whatnot. My undying love for vaginas(not necessarily the owners of said vaginas) will not change. If anything, the only thing I&#039;d be worried about, is if it didn&#039;t dissolve &amp; I have to shit and it gets wasted. I can&#039;t see it hurting as human feces is quite a bit bigger than a fucking little pill.<br />Thats like when guys think they are to big for their ol lady, yeah right, they can push babies outta that motherfucker and you think you&#039;re too big and hurting her.(not including virgins)<br />I don&#039;t think the high is that much better that I would go through the trouble.

				Wouldn&#039;t shoving any substance up your as be a little more dangerous considering it bypasses your stomach kidneys and liver? Any adulterants go directly into your bloodstream, and if any of those are in any way toxic...<br />I guess if you buy your molly from a reputable vendor, test, then acetone wash, wrap it in rice paper then sure go right ahead and jam it in your pooper. Just remember that redosing in the club might be a little awkward..&nbsp; :P<br />I&#039;ve never had any substance in my ass/vagina but I could imagine dancing like this would be uber uncomfortable.

				Wow, firstly lets clear some points up.<br /><br />Shoving things up your arse drugs or otherwise. Doesn&#039;t mean you have under underlying issues. To suggest such a thing is highly naive, narrow minded and misunderstands sexual psychology.&nbsp; Many people like a range of sexual stimulation from just plain, light off to whips, bells and leather. What is normal sex is as undefinable as what is love. Just because you don;t like it doesn&#039;t mean someone else shouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />While anal sex is commonly associated with male homosexuality, research shows not all gay males engage in anal sex and that it is not uncommon in heterosexual relationships. People do it because they like it, to be gay you need to be attracted to the same sex. What kind of sex you like has nothing to do with your sexual preference. Prostate stimulation can produce a &quot;deeper&quot; orgasm, described by some men as more widespread and intense, longer-lasting, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only. <br /><br />So keep an open mind is my suggestion.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Secondly, plugging (which I always do with Molly and 2C-B) has some definite benefits. You avoid first pass metabolism. The first-pass effect is a phenomenon of drug metabolism whereby the concentration of a drug is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation.<br /><br />From wikipedia<br /><br />After a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the hepatic portal system. It is carried through the portal vein into the liver before it reaches the rest of the body. The liver metabolizes many drugs, sometimes to such an extent that only a small amount of active drug emerges from the liver to the rest of the circulatory system. This first pass through the liver thus greatly reduces the bioavailability of the drug. Alternative routes of administration like suppository, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational aerosol and sublingual avoid the first-pass effect because they allow drugs to be absorbed directly into the systemic circulation.<br /><br />Some of the noticeable benefits are reduction of any feelings of sickness and body load is reduced.<br /><br />As with all drug use reduction of harm and risk management is always recommend.<br /><br />The anal sphincter is delicate, easily-torn tissue; a tear can provide an entry for pathogens. Make sure your hands are clean, and that any method of delivery is also sterilized. Use ample lubrication to reduce the risk of tearing. <br /><br />Also no one can know if the substance will cause any lasting cell damage leading to cancer. But only constant repeated use would be a concern. The odd try out now and again should be OK.<br /><br />Watch your dosage, some drugs like 2C-B should be halved in dose. This also makes your stash last longer. <br /><br />Plugging is painless, not icky if you do it after a shower and ensure that you have evacuated before hand. Gives you a different high and makes the drug come on quicker. MDMA high is reached in about 20-30 minutes, 2C-B will peak within 20 minutes as well.<br /><br />Try it, don&#039;t try it, its up to you. But don&#039;t paint it as anything other than trying out a new ROA.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Not keen to try plugging, think its just the things come out, not go in, of the anus... <br /><br />We call it shelving (maybe its an aussie things?)<br /><br />Rather just double drop and then 1 every hour afterwards (tolerance is getting high)

				I&#039;ve plugged before. The easiest way is a gel cap of mdma, give it a bit of lube and put it snugly in there. It&#039;s a bit of a funny way to get high but it certainly gives you more bang for your buck.

				A few years ago there was a story in the local newspapers about people who soaked tampons in vodka and stuck them up their asses/pussies. The alcohol hit them so fast and hard that they passed out before being able to remove the tampons. They were brought to the hospital where they got their stomachs pumped but to the surprise of the doctors their blood alcohol levels kept rising until one of the doctors checked their assholes and pussies and removed the tampons.<br />Don&#039;t plug alcohol, people! ;D

				MDMA is what let me let go of my inhibitions enough to plug MDMA.&nbsp; Yeah there&#039;s a catch-22 there but after you&#039;ve done it once and have your girlfriend lick your asshole you&#039;ll see the light.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason plugging is so closely associated with MDMA even though many drugs can be plugged.<br /><br />I plug it in liquid form though.&nbsp; I shake it with ~2mL of warm water in a 3mL syringe with the needle removed (covering the hole for the needle with my finger).&nbsp; Apply lube.&nbsp; The rest is pretty easy to figure out.&nbsp; I tried to put just the crystallized MDMA in one and that burned for some reason.&nbsp; I also tried with a gelcap and may or may not have had some issues with that.&nbsp; I was too fucked up after to remember for sure.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a nasty dude with dingle berries and shit stained underwear then just stick to using the MDMA orally haha.

				If you plug it, then be careful with the dosage.&nbsp; You can always take more.&nbsp; Many people that take MDMA orally will throw up if they take too much.&nbsp; If you take too much when plugging throwing up isn&#039;t going to help.

				I&#039;ve had slight interest in trying plugging, but my main concern has always been that there might be a chance that increases your possibility of rectal/colon cancer. Obviously (I think?) there aren&#039;t research studies on that, but I just imagine based on the fact that your body expects your stomach/liver/etc to have gotten rid of toxins in things passing through that tubing, so any impurities (or the MDMA itself, I don&#039;t know) are more likely to be able to cause damage in that less-protected region over time... Of course I&#039;m pulling this out of my ass, there&#039;s no studies to back it up, it&#039;s just my own worry.<br /><br />I actually hadn&#039;t even thought of the possibility of vaginal &quot;plugging&quot;, though. I&#039;m a bit more comfortable with that idea, since the body expects foreign particles/objects in there to a certain extent, albeit a lot less than it does the mouth/etc.<br />I&#039;d be curious to hear if anyone has experience with vaginal ROA, or just understands a lot about how it works, etc. As effective as rectal? Still OK to use liquid in a syringe, or too likely to leak (lol)? If no to previous, preferred technique? Any difference in absorption/dosage? Any knowledge or experience is appreciated...

The only way it will cause cancer is if the chemical causes damage to the cell. And this cell then replicates the fault. Which from occasional us is extremely extremely extremely unlikely. We have enough redundancy and checks in the cell division process for this not happen. Otherwise we would be getting cancer all the time off things we eat. <br /><br />Cigarette use&nbsp; is a case in point. The evidence is huge that cigarette smoking causes cancer. But it is prolonged use, and if you stop in your late 20&#039;s early 30&#039;s then it is unlikely your risk is greater than a lifelong non smoker.<br /><br />Heavy and prolonged use I would worry, recreational use, you are more at risk from tearing your colon or sphincter and introducing infection than anything else.

				Okay, so clearly plugging gets a BAD rep for most folks and I get it. Looking through here I think the general idea is pretty obvious but as someone who has done it I thought I&#039;d toss in my two cents.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Hits MUCH faster if you&#039;re all clear down there.<br />Hits a little harder if you&#039;re all clear down there.<br />Use a bit less for same high if you&#039;re all clear down there.<br />For people that puke on X this method of delivery seems to avoid that issue.<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you aren&#039;t all clean down there you&#039;ve just stashed your fix in a pile of shit.<br />If you aren&#039;t all clean down there you probably really regret&nbsp; sticking anything in there.<br />It&#039;s pretty easy to fiend on X when you can plunge happiness into your butt.<br />You will have some loose stool for a day or two depending on how much you do.<br />If your friends find out where you put your drugs they probably won&#039;t want your drugs... this might be a pro.<br /><br />If you are going to do it, my preferred method is with MDMA / MDA powder. Using pills just introduces whatever else they put into the pill into my body and bypasses all the filtering that my stomach would normally provide. It&#039;s best to test so you at least have some clue whats going into you and if you are nervous try a run at it orally and experience the comedown to make sure you aren&#039;t shooting something you don&#039;t want up there. Personally I just use 10ml oral syringes (no needle) I got from Wal-Greens for free from the pharmacy. They are pretty skinny, go in about the right amount and hold more than enough liquid. My process is something like this:<br /><br />Fill a glass with water, distilled if available.<br />Measure out my MDMA / MDA<br />Place the drug onto a small folded piece of paper (post it note size but not sticky).<br />Remove the plunger from the oral syringe<br />Place my finger on the tip of the syringe and use the folded paper to pour the drug down it.<br />Keeping my finger on the tip of the syringe I slowly reinsert the plunger, pushing the drug towards the bottom.<br />I leave enough room with the plunger to tap the drug towards one side at the bottom and insert nozzle into water and extract 2-3 ML.<br />Finger on top of nozzle I shake for a while. MDMA / MDA is a salt and water soluble. It should all melt away. If it doesn&#039;t, there&#039;s probably something else in there.<br />Using something like KY Liquid I prep my pucker with a dab, make sure the nozzle is still wet and then plug it right in there.<br />If you are scared and don&#039;t get it all up in there you&#039;ll squirt your drugs on your couch, chair, floor so don&#039;t be shy right up to the end where you can still just barely hold onto the plunger edges.<br />Give it one more good shake, push any extra air out and push the plunger down, down down.<br />Normally I just leave the plunger in there for a minute or five until you learn how to relax when pulling it out. Laying on your side makes this more comfortable.<br /><br />If done properly, the rush will likely come on in just a few minutes and the peak will get there quicker then normal. With oral doses I&#039;m always &quot;Is it coming? Did I take enough? Should I redose?&quot; Plugging you really aren&#039;t left wondering all that long.<br /><br />This really isn&#039;t a fix for people that like to X and hit the clubs. I&#039;m a home user and just like to chill with my girl and enjoy a nice roll. We&#039;ve been together to long to feel all weird about putting something in our butts. If it gets us to a nice place we&#039;re all about it and if not why bother? If you solo or have a like-minded someone around it&#039;s really not that big of a deal and I like the quick rush it brings on vs. the oral guessing game (did I eat too much? my stomach too acidic? I&#039;m I feeling it yet?).<br /><br />My warning I will give you is probably make sure you know what you are getting into. Experience the specific drug orally first and then decide if you want to take it in the back door. I fiended on a gram of MDA once over 12 hours and spent about 16 hours in a very pleasant fractal induced visual and tactile orgasm. The week after that sort of sucked balls in a way I wasn&#039;t particularly fond of but man...<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps any adventurers out there. It&#039;s not scary or messy or gay. It is a neat way to get the drugs in a little faster and feel them more completely. I feel like plugging lets me measure my experience more precisely since there is no bio availability conversion. If it weirds you out the high isn&#039;t any better or worse you&#039;ll just have to take a little more of the precious X to enjoy the same world.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				From research, here&#039;s the best way I found to do it: put a condom or &quot;finger condom&quot; on your finger, apply lube (even if the condom is pre-lubed) and get it to at least the second knuckle. You want to poop about 2 hours before hand cuz its recent enough to not have to go again but not so recent that it&#039;s like you just pooped. My gf has some experience with this, but i haven&#039;t been able to man up and do it yet. She says you can barely feel it in there for a little but it&#039;ll go away in about half an hour. Keep in mind it bypasses some of your body&#039;s natural filters (ie kidneys) so it should only be done with substances you are fairly confident aren&#039;t cut with fillers. <br /><br />Be safe loadin&#039; &#039;er up.

I wasn&#039;t anal (couldn&#039;t help myself lol) enough with cleaining out the sewerage, or as some like to say - &quot;The chimney&#039;s too clogged up for Santa to safely leave his presents&quot;.<br /><br />Will give it a good clean plunge in the next few days :)<br /><br /><br />And to the ignorant ones screaming &quot;Gay&quot; - ignorance is exactly why majority of the population are against drugs, so let&#039;s try not to spread it here as well.

While there are a TON of blood vessels to absorb the MDMA solution as described above there are NO digestive fluids to break down the binders in the pill leaving you to the mercy of whatever fillers were in the pill and how much moisture is in your rear at the time. If I was going to do it with a known good pill I would probably still just go the crush it up liquid solution route rather than just shove it in there and hope for the best.<br /><br />As far as the liquid plugging and not feeling it, never ran into that but I&#039;m a morning constitution sort of guy and a night time drug user so that may help. If you give it another go make sure the MDMA or Meth is completely dissolved before plunging since as mentioned above there aren&#039;t any digestive processes happening at that end of the pipe works. When I first tried this with my GF I was terrified of hurting her, barely put it in and most all of the MDMA just leaked out. Trying it on myself with the little 10 ml oral syringe it really just seemed to work best getting it right up in there and plunging down. If you are laying on your side when you do it and just leave it in there for a while I think you&#039;d be set for a practice run. <br /><br />Let us know how it works out.

Every method of ingestion has a different feel to it. Some people smoke meth, others snort, others IV. It&#039;s just a matter of preference. Some people seem to get weirded out by the idea of plugging and I get it, it&#039;s different, but seems a lot saner to me than IV&#039;ing for instance. Let&#039;s face it, we&#039;re all fucking drug users here. If licking a donkey&#039;s ass was the best way to get high there would be a bunch of people out there with shit on their faces. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really consider it a violation to try a new drug entry route. The same people that told you not to play with your bum also told you drugs were bad and you&#039;d go blind if you masturbated too much. If you think it&#039;s gross don&#039;t do it. Lots of people sort of consider their bodies their temples so finding one part or another gross just doesn&#039;t fit into my view of myself. It&#039;s all there for a reason and personally I enjoy the ride from plugging so I do it every now and then.

				I personally wouldn&#039;t do it at first... I think it&#039;s a vile and uncomfortable thing. But, if I&#039;m high on it already and I want to take more, I want to put it in my ass... E makes you really, maybe too comfortable with yourself and the environment if you take a good dose....

If it gets us to a nice place we&#039;re all about it and if not why bother? If you solo or have a like-minded someone around it&#039;s really not that big of a deal and I like the quick rush it brings on vs. the oral guessing game (did I eat too much? my stomach too acidic? I&#039;m I feeling it yet?).<br /><br />My warning I will give you is probably make sure you know what you are getting into. Experience the specific drug orally first and then decide if you want to take it in the back door. I fiended on a gram of MDA once over 12 hours and spent about 16 hours in a very pleasant fractal induced visual and tactile orgasm. The week after that sort of sucked balls in a way I wasn&#039;t particularly fond of but man...<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps any adventurers out there. It&#039;s not scary or messy or gay. It is a neat way to get the drugs in a little faster and feel them more completely. I feel like plugging lets me measure my experience more precisely since there is no bio availability conversion. If it weirds you out the high isn&#039;t any better or worse you&#039;ll just have to take a little more of the precious X to enjoy the same world.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Quoted because it is exactly my experience amd the post I was going to write but now I don&#039;t have to.<br /><br />I&#039;d only do it with pure powder, dissolved, not pills crushed or otherwise.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had the most positive of results, hitting fast (fast come up) with apparently more mileage per milligram vs ingestion, and I&#039;ve also wasted a dose. Fuck knows where it went, but it wasn&#039;t to my head.<br /><br />So if you&#039;ve only got one shot and an important night don&#039;t bother taking the risk.<br /><br />but if you&#039;ve spare gear and an urge to experiment there is a payoff waiting - even if only for the experience of the faster come up and the &quot;i don&#039;t care what/when I&#039;ve last eaten&quot; satisfaction.

				Here is a cut and paste from a similar thread about MDMA....and my experience with a rather interesting variation on Plugging:<br /><br />One of the more &#039;unusual&#039; ways that I have administered MDMA (after reagent testing and small taste testing....for possible allergens) is to ground up 100mgs of MDMA into a very fine powder. I then carefully place the powder into Bic Biro or empty pen...and have that pen inserted into the anal passage and have my girlfriend blow the contents hard from the pen into the rectum.<br /><br />Once you get over the oddness of administration, you&#039;ll find that by blowing the contents hard, it will spray out and have a rather large contact footprint internally....and will be absorbed uniformly, thus by-passing the liver and having a fuller effect a lot sooner that other methods.<br /><br />This method is known as &#039;Fairy Dusting&#039; as was used extensively in the 70&#039;s with cocaine.<br /><br />Be careful with your amounts. For harm minimization purposes I would suggest that you decrease your usual intake by 30% using this method....as it&#039;s a (excuse the obvious pun)... major kick in the ass.

				Anybody that has a problem with plugging, especially IV users, need to get their priorities straight, do it in private, don&#039;t announce it to the world, it&#039;s a simple as that, By the way all you non-pluggers, or people that think it is disgusting, I got news for you.

				Do it,<br /><br />You squeeze shit bigger than your finger and a pill every day. Your arse can take it<br /><br />wash, lubricate, push the pill up there, wash, dry.<br /><br />It&#039;s nothing, much less risk than IV. <br /><br />Hygiene and infection from tearing are the only risks, outside of the drug itself. Lubrication stops potential tears and makes it easy and over within seconds.&nbsp; Use antibacterial soap, but just normal soap and washing will kill 99.9% of anything harmful. Or even if you think it is still yucky, buy a box of disposable medical gloves.<br /><br />It is an extremely effective form of ROA for many drugs. You avoid the stomach upset and unpleasant body load caused by many drugs. You come up faster and easier as well.

It doesn&#039;t make that huge a difference, and over-complicates it.<br /><br />Ensure you use an enema kit consisting of saline solution and a rinsing bulb, and prepare to sit on the toilet for about 30 minutes clearing everything out.<br /><br />An enema isn&#039;t strictly required, but I&#039;d recommend it, because if there&#039;s a lot of stuff in there, you&#039;re wasting expensive drugs.<br /><br />The bioavailability for plugging is very close to IV, and the comeup tends to be much smoother and faster than oral, with a smoother and gentler comedown compared to IV.

				Seriously this is hilarious. Plugging MDMA and MDA along with other substances isn&#039;t bad at all. Get a regular oral syringe or use a regular Needle and pull the tip off. put about 2/3 or your reg dose in water....stir it up. Suck it up the syringe. Lube and go as deep as you can and you&#039;re good to go. This method is great for H and the ROA I use. Fuck walking around looking like a junkie with bruises from each and every injection site.

				Pushing a little liquid up there often results in things coming back out a few minutes later.&nbsp; That&#039;s the problem with plugging liquid.&nbsp; But well worth it compared to oral for a drug like MDMA in my opinion.&nbsp; I just plug water by itself first and get that issue taken care of before doing it with the drug.

				It&#039;s really not that bad. Stuff doesn&#039;t normally come out unless you needed to take a shit before you shove it up there. The physiology of it is basically that fecal mater is stored further up your butt than a small syringe with a few ML of water is likely to go (in the rectal ampulla to be specific). To wall lining of the lower rectum where the liquid does go, does a great job of sucking up moisture and and drug related compounds long before it floods you body with so much liquid you feel the need to purge. Guys, as a rule, are terrified by the prospect while girls really hardly ever have an issue with it since I imagine people are always trying to put things in their ass.<br /><br />Try it alone sometime, do it while laying on your side, let it hang out there for a few minutes unless you&#039;re sure you can pull it out nice and quick and clench up fast. By the time the dose hits you a few minutes later you&#039;ll be all like &quot;Oh, I get it now!&quot;. You don&#039;t even have to tell anyone but once you try it, it&#039;s clearly and obviously a better delivery method than swallowing it and letting your stomach destroy about 33% of your stash in the acid wash it gives it before entering the blood stream assuming you take it on an empty stomach and don&#039;t have to play a huge waiting game on having it get passed all the other stuff in your belly first.<br /><br />I&#039;ve mentioned it before but I&#039;ve done it lots of times and still have no desire to go down on men in public restrooms so other than getting me good and high it mostly just saves me a little money on the drugs I buy and gives me a bit more bang for the buck. Plus, if you get high with a bunch of girls, you get to play doctor as the resident plugging expert.

				First of all you should not use pills for plugging in my opinion. MDMA is water soluble so just use the best clean white stuff you can find please. It&#039;s a very sensitive part of the body even tho you can do very extreme things with it without hurting yourself. ;-)<br /><br />Do an enema before, that may be strange for some people, some may do this regularly anyway. :)<br />Then just wait until there is no water left, 1-2h to be sure. This way it will be more effective and it will not come out again even if you use a little bit more liquid.<br />Add 0,9% table salt this way your bowel will not absorb the water so much and you have full absorbing capability&#039;s for the MDMA that comes an hour later or so.<br /><br />Be warned, it could burn and there could be a cardiovascular system breakdown (you almost collapse, almost blackout, you sweat instantly a lot and feel very hot and sick from one minute to another) but not from the MDMA, it&#039;s from your body having major trouble handling the stimulation of the bowel!<br />
