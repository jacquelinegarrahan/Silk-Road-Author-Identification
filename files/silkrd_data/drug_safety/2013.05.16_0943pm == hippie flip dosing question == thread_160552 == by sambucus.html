				i was toying around with the idea of a hippie flip and looked around for some info but there aren&#039;t a lot of dosing recommendations. are you supposed to take a full dose of each or less of either -like a candy flip recommends 70-80% your normal mdma dose. what do you normally do?

				take a lower dose of each. maybe 1/16 oz. mushrooms and 125 mg mdma? you could always redose more mdma later on if it&#039;s not enough.

				You don&#039;t wanna be coming down of MDMA while you&#039;re still tripping so be sure you have enough.

				Also interested in this. Soon I will be taking 3 drops of JOR&#039;s TOC liquid. The following day I intend to hippie flip. I&#039;m thinking of taking 3g of shrooms, and then 150mg of MDMA.<br /><br />Interested to know people&#039;s advice on timing. Take both at the same time, or take the MDMA an hour after eating the shrooms? Any other advice/tips appreciated.

				for the most amazing come up and buzz i like to take a trip and try to time it that when you take the mdma/pill you come up around the same time. its intense as fuck but wow, its something special.<br />although when ever ive mixed it tends to be with paper acid and e&#039;s, not mushys and m.<br /><br />tbh when working with paper and pills its easier to judge dosage.... 1 trip to as many pills you want after&nbsp; :)<br />i would also say yes, make sure you got enough m to take you through the trip.

				There&#039;s actually loads of discussion on clearnet a google search away. General consensus seems to be take MDMA about one hour after eating the shrooms. Some people like to do it at the same time.

				moonflower - thanks for your answer, i just need a little clarification. <br /><br />do you normally take 1/8th of shrooms and therefore recommend 1/16th for a flip? do you normally take 150mg of mdma and recommend 125mg for a flip? if that&#039;s the case, then 50% shrooms and 80% mdma which would be awesome, i just want to be sure. <br />

I told him to take a half a red &quot;?&quot; MDMA (~90mg MDMA) if he got bored and was feeling adventurous. He ended up taking the half pill about 3 hrs in and said it was &quot;like fireworks&quot; and enjoyable. So I would definitely go on the low end with the MDMA. 150 is probably a bit much if it&#039;s good MDMA. Still with maybe ~100mg.<br /><br />I have only done this once, but in a different way. Took like 2.5 MDMA pills (unknown strength or quality, it was many years ago) and I was on an SSRI so I wasn&#039;t really feeling it, of course. However, I got bored, and a few hours later took 1/16th of some homegrown mushrooms and was tripping BALLS (normally would need at least ~2g to trip this much). Quite pleasantly so too. It was different because my mind wasn&#039;t too fucked, but EVERYTHING in my visual field was turned into liquid. It was like I was walking on water because the ground would not stand still.
