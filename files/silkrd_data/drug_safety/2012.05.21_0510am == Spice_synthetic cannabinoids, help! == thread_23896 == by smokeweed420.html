				I really need advice this is the worst i have felt in my entire life.<br /><br />&nbsp; Ok so i started smoking spice 3 months ago because i was being drug tested. it soon turned into every day use. i pretty much replaced marijuana with it. and had no negative effects until 3 nights ago. i smoked a normal sized bowl and within 5 minutes my heart was beating dangerously fast. it was a very scary experience. within an hour the effects died down and i was fine. i woke up the next day with extreme paranoia, depression, and irregular heart beat. it has now been 2 days and i feel the same. i feel hopeless and extremely depressed. i have always been a happy person. this is terrible. the worst part is the paranoia. i feel like people are trying to kill me, like life is worthless, and im even scared of the dark! this is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. i cant sleep, im scared for my life for no good reason and it has made me a totally different person. the other day i cussed out my dad and almost physically attacked him when he asked me if i was ok because i was acting so weird. i am so scared and dont know what to do. has anyone else experienced this? what should i do. its not like im gonna commit suicide, but this is very scary. im extremely psychologically messed up. today i carried a kitchen knife all around my house because i was paranoid that someone else would come in and harm me. I highly recommend that NOBODY smokes spice or synthetic cannabinoids ever. i have realized they are extremely dangerous and no research has been done.

				Yeah, it&#039;s bad shit. No one would ever take it if it was sold as 1-[(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-(naphthalen-1-yl)methanone; calling it &#039;synthetic cannabinoids&#039; fools people into assuming they must be nontoxic like the phytocannabinoids, when really the molecules are nothing alike and just happen to bind to one of the same proteins (as do many other things).<br />As for your condition, you might benefit from trying one of my products.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/13b74fbf75

				Reese has a good suggestion - I&#039;ve been (trying to) relax with Xanax or Valium enought even for a small 5X hit of Salvia D. I like Salvia&#039;s effect, but I dan&#039;t find it fun, if that makes any sense. (I got into an argument with a naked chick who Marine Drill Sgt. my ass - it&#039;s really strange to loose to a hallucination!

				i just wanted to give an update. it has been a little over 2 weeks and the extreme paranoia and fear have passed. i still have lots of unjustified fear and slight paranoia that i never had before but i feel 1000x better. but im still sleeping with a night light( lol ) and am still scared/paranoid of being alone or outside at night. but hey atleast im not walking around with a knife thinking of everything i every saw in scary movies. believing its real and its coming for me lol.&nbsp; oh and by the way its not salvia lol idk where you guys got that. its herbal incense/fake cannabis/spice/drug test weed lol. ive learned a valuable lesson never to do this stuff again and am somewhat stronger and smarter because of it. peace yall!

				I agree a nice benzo will help with your problem/future problems. Another thing you could try if you are worried about piss tests and cant take benzos is having a bottle of whiskey or vodka or any other strong booze to bring you down with a couple of shots back to back.&nbsp; Ive tried the synthetic stuff a couple of times. I cant imagine smoking it everyday as a replacement for weed though. Its just not the same. Ive never had any bad trips like you mentioned, but ive had some mild paranoia and uneasiness. <br /><br />Try spacing out your use to every couple of days or maybe even once a week on the weekends or something. To me its better than nothing, but it sounds like you&#039;re having some bad side effects, so stay away from that shiz. <br /><br />Glad to hear you&#039;re feeling better now btw.<br />

				Am-2201 is a hell of a drug. Even if you love it it can still tear strips off you at any time. Ur-144 seems a bit more friendly, but synthetic cannabinoids are not something I would tend to recommend to any but the most seasoned users of reality altering substances. People get lulled into a false sense of familiarity cos they think they are a weed replacement then get so high they never want to go there again. I used to laugh at that, then had a healthy caution and respect then went a little too far out even for me. Most fun ever, but still buttfuck crazy times. It will pass.

				Should have gone to the doctors and gotten some anti-psychotic meds, maybe zyprexa or seroquel or something, even if they just gave you sleeping pill or benzo to get over the hump. Sounded like some sort of psychosis, some can last a long long time, months, years, forever, I would seek professional help.&nbsp;

				Yeh, I hear you, man. I began smoking spice, kronic p/ex, norther lights skunk, black label etc over a year ago .... BUT only like 3 nights a week. The rest of the time it&#039;s weed - hydro, or occasional outdoor sativa.... I never got the shakes with weed, altho a lot ppl do BUT with synth&#039;s I did -&nbsp; just recently. Now it&#039;s all ok since i stopped it and just smoke weed.<br /><br />Having said that, a good mate of mine has been smoking spice, nl, etc like there&#039;s no tomorrow, and back when he was just on weed, he was his mellow self. Now he more frequently has mood swings, anger busts, paranoia, illusions, etc - more like a methhead than a thc smoker.

				I woke up one morning to someone I care about having a really intense seizure. She was incapable of communicating for three days. There was a chance she could have experienced real brain damage, according to her doctors (who I kinda think were quacks).<br /><br />We attribute this to our use of funky munkey, a spice-like thing they used to sell in my state.
