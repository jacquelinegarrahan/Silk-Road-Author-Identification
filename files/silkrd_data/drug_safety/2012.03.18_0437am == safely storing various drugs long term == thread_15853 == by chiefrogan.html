				what the title says. basically looking into having a certain amount of things to have on hand, sort of like a drug survival kit that will be eventually stored and well hidden :p. ideallyat least 6 months maybe 12 if possible of the following:<br />blotters, coke, heroin, mdma, ketamine, dmt, meth, and probably weed but i already know how to preserve it by vacuum sealing and throwing in the freezer. my question is if im safe to do that will all those above? im thinking of putting the vacbags in canning/mason jars with the lid and screw top and then freezer. would those jars be ok in a dark cool basement? or buried in the ground? please let me know if these method will be safe or any others/and how long estimated its good for?<br /><br />dont hate on my kit as anyone knows when you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendancy is to push it as far as you can ;) i also searched before asking and would like more info

				I&#039;m assuming that by blotters you mean LSD, so keeping it in a cool place where no light, moisture, heat or oxygen to allow it to decay and you should be able to keep it on hand for a long period of time. Basically wrap it in foil, vacuum pack it and chuck in that freezer your keeping your weed with and it should be fine. I would suggest treating your DMT in the same manner (minus the foil if you want). You would then probably want to put these vacuum bags in the jars you mentioned to prevent moisture seeping through the plastics over time.<br /><br />Cocaine hydrochloride should stay pretty much as it was for a very long period of time as the compound is inert, your problem there is it may be cut, and it&#039;s the substances that it&#039;s cut with there that you should worry about, so I can&#039;t really help you there, the same principals with meth.<br /><br />With heroin, just keep it away from moisture and it should stay fine, MDMA is the same. Keep both in a dark, dry place and they will remain potent. I have no idea how ketamine is stored so you&#039;d have to look for that one yourself. <br /><br />Just get yourself a freezer without an internal light (this is optional, not necessary, as sunlight is the real killer of your more sensitive chems), and keep it in your basement, chuck something on top to disguise it and you will be set for a few years, enjoy (:<br /><br />EDIT: just to specify, you would be better off also putting your coke, herion and MDMA in some sort of container within the freezer to keep them from moisture.

				If you were looking for steal, put them in their jars in an old seafood box or something at the very bottom/back of a fridge, something people wouldn&#039;t ever consider opening. Even if your basement stays cool, the more unstable substances would still degrade at a faster rate than if they are in an environment that is below freezing. Mind you, you could live in alaska or something so you never know (;
