				Are these stimulants, dissociatives or psychedelics?<br /><br />4-FA<br />4-FMA<br />4-MEC<br />4-FMC<br />3-FMC<br /><br />What is a freebase?<br />4-aco-DMT<br /><br />I&#039;m really curious.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				All are stimulants.<br />4-fluoroamphetamine, 4-fluoromethamphetamine, 4-methylethcathinone, 4-fluoromethcathinone, 3-fluoromethcathinone<br /><br />Amines (R-NH2) are organic bases. If you react an organic base with an acid, you get a salt. <br />Lots of amine based drugs are sold in their salt form. For example MDA is the hydrochloride salt, derived from the amine and hydrochloric acid. Codeine comes as the phosphate salt, from the amine and phosphoric acid. <br />Salts tend to be more water soluble than the parent amine, have different absorption properties and are often more stable in storage than the base.<br />The freebase is simply the amine that the salt was made from. <br /><br />Psilocin is 4-HO-DMT, one of the active constituents of magic mushrooms. 4-AcO-DMT is a derivative of psilocin and is expected to be converted into psilocin in the body. I haven&#039;t had the opportunity to try it yet but apparently it is very much like a mushroom trip but a bit gentler.

				i&#039;ve tried a few of those and enjoyed them.<br />4-fluoroamphetamine:&nbsp; kindler, gentler form of straight amphetamine.&nbsp; almost like dexedrine with a bit more seratonin punch.&nbsp; almost feel like you&#039;re starting a roll when u first take it and then it levels off into a 12 hr amphetamine buzz that comes down so slowly you may never even have a chance to fiend.&nbsp; 60-150 mg<br /><br />, 4-fluoromethamphetamine:&nbsp; similar to 4-FA but much more potent (half the dose required) and seems to be almost purely a dopamine releaser.&nbsp; coke-like buzz (and meth like without the crushing euphoria).&nbsp; lasts about 2 hrs and then converts to 4-FA.&nbsp; id u keep redosing eventually enough converts to 4-FA to give u a long trailing buzz..&nbsp; otherwise short acting with little next day hang over.&nbsp; 35-75 mg<br />&nbsp;<br />4-methylethcathinone:&nbsp; 4-MEC was an awesome discovery.&nbsp; at the time i had no access to MDMA but boy this stuff almost fooled me.&nbsp; taken orally it&#039;s like a light, short, and intense little MDMA buzz.&nbsp; pure serotonin re-leaser.&nbsp; very stoning though, almost like MDE (which i believe it is the beta-ketone of).&nbsp; from oral dosing to peak to come down only about 2 hrs.&nbsp; u can re-dose up to about 3 times to extend the effects.&nbsp; 100-300 mg<br /><br />yea before SR i was buying alot of these three guys.&nbsp; i hear mixing 4-FA and 4-MEC is very similar to rolling.&nbsp; my partner tried it once (she took the MEC as she was coming down from the 4-FA) and she said she was more trashed then she had ever been.&nbsp; of course she hadn&#039;t taken any good MDMA up till then.<br /><br />4-FA = my favorite!&nbsp; i love the kindness of this stim.&nbsp; it may linger for almost 24 hrs but the buzz is nice, you get productive, it&#039;s highly sexual/sensual, and gives you a great mood lift with no paranoia.&nbsp; great study aid too!!!<br /><br />*destiny*

				Since we are in the drug safety section, I advise people to read this very informative post I found regarding FA use. It seems to be highly neurotoxic. <br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=175262
