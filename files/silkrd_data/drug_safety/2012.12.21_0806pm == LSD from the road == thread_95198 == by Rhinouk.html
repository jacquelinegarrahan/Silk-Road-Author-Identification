				Just wondering what experiences people have had from LSD from silkroad. I&#039;ve purchased it 4 times off here and i&#039;ve felt nothing, Is it that i&#039;m just being ript-off every time or can you be immune to acid?&nbsp; :-\ the last dose was 3x 100ug on fruit pastilles and i took all 3, before that it was 150ug on blotter paper with no results!<br /><br />Has anybody similar problems or is it just me?

				Ive heard similar claims in the past, it could be due to a few things, the shit could be weak as shit, and wrongly advertised, in which case you would really need to know LSD quite well to be able to feel and appreciate the slight effects you get. Also if your not a acid head, and have only had one or two strong doses of clean LSD, if any at all, It will take a few good doses to make you fully recognize the effects. Lastly it could be you did not carry out your transactions with enough diligence to chose a vendor thats sure to send you exactly what is advertised. Good luck friend.

				It could be a cross tolerance or something else (opiates for example) that you are on that can block the effects of LSD. <br /><br />I had really good LSD from Jesus of Rave, a friendly vendor as well.

				There is lots of good acid around - see the avengers LSD review thread: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />300ug from a star vendor should have you seriously tripping unless you are on some drugs that counteract the effects (antidepressants typically).

				Nah i&#039;m not on any meds &amp; i&#039;ve only been smoking hash recently, I&#039;ve probably just been unlucky with the vendors but thanks for the link next time i&#039;ll be sure to get it from a star vendor. Good to see Jesusofrave on there,&nbsp; i&#039;ve got some DMT&nbsp; in transit from him xD

				LSD is very sensitive to temperature and light. When shipped (especially overseas) it will experience very hot and very cold temperatures, that can turn a 150ug blotter into a 25ug blotter. My recommendation is trying DMT. DMT is pretty much LSD that you smoke.
