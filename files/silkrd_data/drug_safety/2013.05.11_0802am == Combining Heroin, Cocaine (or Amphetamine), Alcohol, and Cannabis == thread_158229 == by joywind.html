				The &#039;Brompton cocktail&#039; is an elixir meant for use as a pain suppressant, and dosed for prophylaxis. It is made from heroin + cocaine (or amphetamine) + pure alcohol + chlorpromazine (or cannabis).<br /><br />&nbsp;it was given to terminally-ill individuals (especially cancer patients) to relieve pain and promote sociability near death. <br /><br />The Brompton cocktail is named after the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, England, where it was invented in the late 1920s for patients with tuberculosis. While its use has been rare in the 21st century, it is not entirely unheard of today. It was far more common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br /><br />So is this medically approved drug combination good or bad for the Heart?

				if used regularly definitively bad, but i guess when you are so sick that doctors will give you that so you wont have to suffer so much you rather risk dieing earlier than suffering ;P

				Yup, I think there is a reason why that combination might be viable for a terminally ill patient as opposed to a good Saturday night&#039;s entertainment.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />

				only difference is we just used the drugs separately and consecutively!same result but have never seen<br />it made into a (delicious) cocktail. i imagine the result wouldnt be to different. god that was a long time <br />ago. its an amazing high but when u read all the stories of people keeling over on those combos, makes <br />you think twice about how often you can do it and get away with it.
