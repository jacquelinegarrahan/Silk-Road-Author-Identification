				Let me first start by stating that I&#039;ve tried MDMA for the first time last year and have taken it a number of different times since then, usually taking a month off in between. The first time I ever rolled, I only took 100 mg and I had a pretty good time but I could of had a slightly bigger dose. The second time I took 200 mg, rolled my ass off and had a blast. Since my second time though, I&#039;ve taken 200 mg + and never been able to roll as hard, making the assumption that I lost the magic. I&#039;ve heard from a number of sources that it can be reversed with time but I also heard, once it&#039;s lost, the magic is gone. Also my body tends to build tolerance with any drug rather quickly. My question is would it be safe to take like a 300 mg?<br /><br />I do also want to mention, I rarely see any negative effects with MDMA. For example, I don&#039;t feel down or depressed afterwards. No hangover usually except I do kinda just feel drained the next day. The only negative side effect I see is maybe vomiting during the come up but it depends what I ate prior to taking it. <br /><br />Any and all comments and/or suggestions are welcomed!

				First, what is your source for mdma? If you are getting it locally there is a good chance that the quality is not consistent. It could be cut, or it may be another chemical altogether much of the time.<br /><br />Also, how long are you waiting between rolls? You need to wait at minimum 4 weeks, but the best would be to wait 3 months. 6 months would be even better!<br /><br />If by your third roll you are already experiencing greatly diminshed effects with 200+, I am almost certain the quality of what you&#039;re taking is very low and/or you are waiting only a few days between rolls. It&#039;s likely you are waiting several days to several weeks between roll, so my guess is the quality of your mdma is sub-par. Do you have a test kit? You&#039;ve got to have one if you&#039;re buying locally and it would be a very good idea to have one if you&#039;re getting mdma off the road (though it&#039;s more likely that reviews and forum posts will inform you of mdma quality from the road; still a good idea to have one though).<br /><br />Keep in mind that most users do not experience the same intensity and awe of their first actual roll in any subsequent experiences. Still though, if you are taking high quality mdma like what you can find on the road in amounts at 200+mg, you should still have an incredibly strong and satisfying roll. I sense there are other variables involved. I don&#039;t think you would have lost the magic by your third roll. It&#039;s possible, but I&#039;ve never heard that before.<br /><br />-Make sure you are definitely taking quality mdma.<br />-Don&#039;t expect your rolls from now on to be as good as your first roll. (you will be surprised however, as some later experiences may surprise you and produce effects that comparable to your first time. Many of my friends who&#039;ve taken several month breaks and taken very pure mdma have stated that it felt like their first time.)<br />-Change up your setting. The difference of a roll in the dead of winter when you&#039;re huddled in your dwelling trying to stay warm whilst rolling vs. a warm summer night listening to music at a festival can be a night and day difference. mdma can produce a beautifully variable experience in different settings. On that note too, cold + mdma do not mix imo. cool-warm is best. Hot is not good as studies have shown an elevated body temperature while rolling greatly increases the risk of neurotoxicity.<br />-Take proper supplements: alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin c., vitamin e., various other antioxidants (green tea, grape seed extract etc.), magnesium for jaw-clenching, and eat well several days prior and after the experience).<br />-Finally, which is the point I&#039;m at now. If you really can&#039;t seem to get back the effects you are seeking from mdma, try to change your perspective a bit. Don&#039;t allow yourself to be underwhelmed. Try to see that the difference of effects you may be experiencing are just the changing relationship you have with the molecule. It is the familiarity you are gaining. Nothing can stay new forever. Take long breaks and instead of yearning for the original incredible newness, just try to appreciate the experience for what it brings to you. Even if it may not be the same as it was, it is still providing you with something totally unique and beautiful.<br /><br />best of luck to you!

				Thanks for the awesome reply!<br /><br />I do get all of my MDMA on the road and its either been from Super Trips or Juergen. I&#039;ve had many other people try the MDMA from both sellers and no one has mentioned (to me anyways) about diminished quality. Just recently, however, I bought from Symbiosis and received it the other day and it looks like the best quality I&#039;ve ever received from the road, very white and fluffy and it smells awesome. I do plan on trying it in a couple weeks for a dubstep concert (this would give me about 4 week space from the last time I did it). I do have a feeling that I am probably not giving myself enough time in between rolls to recover which is the reason why I am experiencing diminished rolls. I believe another downside is I don&#039;t take supplements but I am going to this time around to see if makes any bit of difference. I will update once I determine what I experience the next time I roll with this batch.

				let me know how that batch from symbiosis turns out .. his rocks look amazing in the photos :)<br />i did have some quality probs with supertrips. i didnt take any because i am in the same boat as you lead. ive rolled many times and ive lost the magic. but frinds and customers said it took 2x&#039;s as much to get the desired effect. <br />are you active or exercise often?.. 300 mg will not kill u&nbsp; (assuming you dont have any medical conditions already) if i take too much i can get sleepy and just curl up in bed and nod off. weird huh.. <br />

				A quote I read here some while ago and found important enough to copy down into my textfile:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only way I know to avoid loss of magic and depressive symptoms is to be moderate in dosage, frequency and contexts.<br />To leave MDMA for special occasions and not to make it an habit. This could sound obvious, but I think it is not only a question of neurorreceptors. It is much easier.<br />Suppose that you like Disneyworld. The first time you go you will think it is fantastic but, if you go every weekend you will finally get fed up of White Snow and Donald Duck.<br />Properties of MDMA are so specific that if you use it too frequently it makes you bored. I think it is also important not to expect too much from it, I mean,<br />some people get obsessed with &quot;getting high&quot; as the first times and that conditions the experience. It is also important, in my opinion,<br />to realize and think about some effects of MDMA that can be learn during the experience, but applicable to everyday life.<br />Someone told me that the first time you take MDMA is similar to &quot;learn to read&quot;.<br />Once you have done it, your perception of reality (and your perceptions of further MDMA experiences) changes. You can´t learn to read twice, and, in this sense,<br />the first experiences will be different to the rest. But you can still enjoy the substance if you are cautious in the way of use and don´t expect too much.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If I remember correctly it was some doctor having a thread here and answering peoples questions.
