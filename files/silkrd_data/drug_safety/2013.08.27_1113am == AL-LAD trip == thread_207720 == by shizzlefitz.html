				I&#039;ll try to answer your questions and hopefully keep the dialogue going.<br /><br />First off, I got them from some outfit called partytribe off of Atlantis because the ten strip was only $80 and all I had was Litecoin to pay with. However, I&#039;m almost certain that both Envious and Partytribe are both reselling the same blotter which is white on one side and has AL-LAD printed on the other. As you know, AL-LAD is synthesized from LSD and there are precious few people in the acid business to begin with.<br /><br />Secondly, I&#039;ve been tripping with a psychedelic every other weekend for the past couple months. The previous trip had been with 4-ACO-DMT when I took ~40mg and was disappointed. Pretty much the same story. Body load, mind fuck and perception changes but not much happening in terms of visuals. The 2C-E I had done the previous two weekends before. I took about 20mg in orange juice and it had barely any effect beyond body load, speedyness and a bit of visual warping. I was able to do pretty much anything while on it though my productivity dropped quite a bit and watching tv it was difficult to follow plot. The two weeks previous to that I had a good trip on two tabs of 25i-Nbome. In addition to the body load, speedyness and trouble focusing the visuals were more readily apparent. I could look at a pattern and it would dance around or look at a photograph and sometimes it became 3D. So, to recap, I took 25i-Nbome then two weekends later 4-ACO-DMT then 2CE and finally this last Saturday two of the 150ug AL-LAD tabs.<br /><br />I&#039;m not on any meds but it might be worth pointing out that in the intervening time I did bong rips of DMT and bufotenine. I&#039;d guess two or three times each over the course of a couple months and at modest doses. I don&#039;t think that has any cross-tolerance issues at that level of frequency and dosage but who knows.<br /><br />So all in all I don&#039;t think my AL-LAD is bunk. I think it must be something about me in particular that I get much more heavily the physical effects while the visual hallucinations are minor. My worry is that if I up the dosages even worse physical side effects will come on and I don&#039;t want to wind up with a serious medical condition.

				I got the same effects as you on 300ug. I have not had a chance but I&#039;ve spoken with a lot of people who tried 450ug+ and they said it was much better. I think some people are much more tolerant to it than others. I didn&#039;t get any visuals at all but i got a bit giggly. Yes it takes forever to kick in... I would just say take at least 450ug next time for a full experience. You are correct in the fact it is laid from the same crystal. Partytribe and I have the same source.

				All of those substances you mentioned doing weeks previous all build tolerance VERY quickly. All of them being psychedelics and most likely having a cross tolerance may be causing your lack luster experiences.

				Envious, thanks so much for your post here. It&#039;s reassuring to know I&#039;m not the only one and I will definitely follow your recommendation to go with 450ug next time. By the way, it absolutely mortified me to have to go to Atlantis and place an order there but all I have at the moment is LTC otherwise you better believe that I&#039;d have gone with you!<br /><br />Zen, this is interesting and probably true but all I can find online and everywhere I read is that tolerance to trypts and phenylamines builds as a result of daily dosing and the suggested resting time is ONE week. I&#039;ve been leaving two so wtf? I&#039;m really curious to find out more and for all I know maybe I gotta lay off for a month between trips.

(5ht2a is thought to be the cause of the psychedelic experience by many)<br />taking them creates a cross tolerance stronger than any other drug I know of, and whoever said you could wait a week between trips probably meant doing it one or two weeks in a row, not making a habit out of it.

				Its the NBOMe man, that shit does strange things with your tolerances. Ive done NBOMBe twice and as fun as it was, ive decided to never do it again because of how weird it is with tolerances. It took me a solid 4 weeks to starting tripping normally on LSD and shrooms, I remember reading that the NBOMe molecules have an EXTREMELY high affinity to the 5ht2a receptor, like WAYYY more then LSD or other psychedelics. I cant cite it, but I think I remember reading the NBOMe class has the highest affinity to this particular receptor of any psychedelic known to man.<br /><br />Give it a solid 2 weeks before you trip again and try doing lots of excersize to give your body a receptor jump-start over that that period. I guarantee you you&#039;ll have a better trip :)

				A lot of people have had tolerance issues with the AL-LAD not because they had recently tripped, but just body chemistry. When I did my 300ug I hadn&#039;t tripped for over 2 months, and it was from liquid vials I had made. I asked a lot of people I sold to and my source and they agreed 450ug+ was needed for a nice visual trip. I would just up it even if you did have a tolerance last time. No point in wasting more and being disappointed again when you have reliable evidence that some people just need more. No worries on ordering from Partytribe. He is a good friend of mine, as are most people selling the substance. Rather hard to get a rep over here on SR unless you have some crazy advantage to the other vendors. I believe he is just trying to make a niche for himself. He is legit.

				I&#039;m really confused by all the &#039;it takes forever to begin&#039; posts by AL-LAD. I purchased mine from EverAfterGlow and it worked absolutely fantastic; it came on in about the same time as LSD, and it was far more visual based than acid. It lasted only an hour or two shorter than LSD, and was an overall very magical experience.<br /><br />Maybe you got bad AL-LAD, maybe your body handles it differently than me, or maybe I was just sold LSD and all of the slight differences I noticed were placebo. Regardless, whatever substance I took felt VERY related to LSD and was well worth what I spent on it.

				I have not noticed any side effects but others surely have noted some. My friend I tripped with threw up and then she was fine, which also happens to certain people on LSD and other psychedelics. Some other people reported &quot;bad&quot; effects but did not detail them so I am skeptical. I would probably do 450ug if you have a small amount and can&#039;t risk wasting it. It&#039;s been pretty well used at this point with only a few negative reports but many many glowing experiences. It is LSD-like. It&#039;s a psychedelic drug so you can&#039;t reliably compare it to another psychedelic as they are all different and even the same substance can produce a totally different experience. A bad trip is always possible as with all psychs. Most people report it takes about 2+ hours to come up, which is what I experienced, It is definitely real (it&#039;s been lab tested) and all coming from the same source. I am pretty confident in saying any AL-LAD out there right now is the from the same synthesis, especially if it&#039;s the labeled blotter. My source has spread it to the ends of the internet. You can tell it&#039;s AL-LAD by the long come-up time, the gigglyness, and the fact it says AL-LAD on the blotter (just kidding). You have to hit the right dose and then it gets really visual. This dose is different for everyone. Your duration sounds right. I think it&#039;s like i speculated before, some are just much more sensitive then others. Some people say 150ug is too much, others say they don&#039;t feel anything at 300ug. If you are a tripper just drop 450ug and hold on as you surely shouldn&#039;t need anymore than that.

				Envious, serious question now, what is your take from your upstream dealer about AL-LAD supply in the coming months?<br /><br />I know you can bs and drive up business by saying when it&#039;s gone that&#039;s it forever and all that but so far you&#039;ve come across as a stand-up guy. I heard that this chemical is a bitch to do and not any more profitable than regular acid so I can kinda see how it was a one-off but would like your input like, if it&#039;s not too personal a question, what kind of stash are you sitting on, how interested is the public, what your dealer still has left, etc. Not trying to prod for intel you don&#039;t feel comfortable letting out.

				I was actually able to procure some more sheets of it that should last at least another month at current rate of sale. It is not my place to say anything about my source but I know the current stock is definitely gone (because i bought the last of it). At the time I said no more stock would be produced that was my belief, but now the future is not so black and white. I won&#039;t say much more than that. If more is produced, its gonna be awhile.

I know at least 5 persons who can confirm this. To be honest before trying AL LAD i was a bit skeptical about this substance. But when i tried it... HOLY SHIT! Its like lsd, shrooms and dmt mixed togather. ;D Its all in your head, without any bodyload and almost zero sideeffects. I tried only one and half tab because i was on a public beach and didn`t want to trip my balls. But still it was pretty amazing experience with lots of OEV similar to Shipibo patterns and shrooms/dmt like CEV. Time stops very hard into eternal now also it enhances your sound perception... When you hear some noize seems like it flies through the whole universe and bounce back deep into your inner world. :o Very interesting substance.

				Question, according to Shulgin and in TiHKAL he states that his best experience with this substance was with 150ug&#039;s.<br /><br />Quoting Shulgin - <br />&quot;(with 150 µg) &quot;Simply beautiful.

				Look guys, it&#039;s a sensitivity issue as I&#039;ve been saying for the past 3 posts. Shulgin has a low sensitivity apparently. It has nothing to do with purity. The has been LC/MS tested at 99%. Impure ergoloids produce a quite nasty body load, which hasn&#039;t been happening. Some people report 150ug is plenty for them with this batch.

				Very awesome thread! <br />I must be pretty sensitive... Not even sure if 450ug is necessary for me.<br /><br />For me at least:<br />150ug got me to a psychedelic state but rather breifly. Its comeup was very quick for me (within 45min). Extremely smooth on the body. Visuals were apparent but never overwhelming. A friend of mine was talking very animatedly and he looked like Ganesh with 30 arms. 30 minutes later, no more tracer, just a nice glow which faded out over a few hours.<br /><br />300ug, rocked me pretty good. Again, a quick comeup and the best body high ever. I felt physically better than I do sober with complete balance. This usually is not the case with psychedelics and I often feel slightly wobbly. Visuals at this level consisted of me staring at sky and seeing fractally geometric circles everywhere. Audio distortion/enhancement was pretty extreme for me at this dose and I could almost not tell what I was really hearing and what I was producing in my mind. My peak lasted a bit longer this time, but within 4 hours of ingestion I was on my way down. During peak I was literally speechless... Comedown was as smooth as comeup, sleep was easy 7 hours after ingestion. <br /><br />I LOVE AL-LAD.. Probably more than LSD even.<br /><br />I have also gotten to try the LSZ at this point and I found it quite smooth on the body (though not as nice as AL), VERY mental, but visually it never did much at least OEV, lights seemed brighter, and vision crisper. For me I found this was great material to dance with. Later on 6-7 hrs when I was lying down, I found I was easily able to bring to mind and visualize my thoughts and old memories. Very interesting material.<br /><br />&lt;3 EAG

				Envious could you please elaborate on &quot;ergoloid impurities&quot;? One of the things that got me very interested in chemistry as well as research chemicals was the huge variation I would get from different &quot;grades&quot; of LSD (swiss, czech drop, needlepoint, family fluff, silver, lavender, amber, etc..) Czech drop was so rediculously visual, I was wondering if I was getting LSD analogues even then (years ago).. <br />Are we talking Iso-LSD or unreacted erogtamine etc.. <br /><br />I have been trying to demystify LSD for years and I was super happy when I found Silk Road, because now I get a chance to talk to people who have a real idea rather than just &quot;hippy lot talk/rumors&quot;

I&#039;ve found both the AL-LAD and LSZ to be extremely clean, probably cleaner than 98% of the acid I&#039;ve gotten.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only reason I say 98% is because only 2 times have I had LSD-25 directly from a laboratory(long time ago) and even that had a noticeable body load, and to a certain extent, it was uncomfortable for the first 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only way I know of to completely get rid of body load is to take 40-50mg ketamine right before you drop, or do some short-acting opiates/downers, which will just decrease your trip.&nbsp; &nbsp; I know that some people might not believe that I dropped acid directly from a lab but it all comes from a lab so they can fuck off! AL-LAD had a similar feel to the lab-sourced gear I&#039;ve had.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lab like the one I suspect made the AL-LAD is likely equipped with modern reaction vessel, chromatron and much more sophisticated analytical equipment as well as atmosphere-controlled drying aparatus.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve never seen one, an underground LSD lab is more likely just a chromatography column, reaction vessel, along with all of the gear they use to quench/extract/salt/evaporate which is where you get most of the variation, IMO, because two people can&#039;t do it 100% the same way. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a modern, well-equipped lab, like the AL-LAD producer, you wouldn&#039;t have that problem because professional chemists, using whatever method they used, wouldn&#039;t have to cut corners like an LSD cook would.&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason so much LSD is(slightly) impure is because the people who make it just want to get it done so they can sell xtal wholesale, there isn&#039;t that much of an incentive to make the best product possible.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some people will disagree, but body load is individual and everyone is different.&nbsp; I found the LSZ had less load than AL-LAD, while the latter had more of a strictly visual/mandala type component.
