				I&#039;m going to a sports party over the weekend where there will be lots of drinking involved.<br />A lot of people who I went to school with but have subsequently fallen out of contact with over the years will be there.<br />I want to take something that will compliment the drinking and give me confidence, talkative etc but I&#039;m worried taking MDMA will make it look obvious I&#039;m on drugs.<br />Any suggestions

				A 0.1g of coke every hour or so should do it. Drinking used to do it for me.<br />&nbsp;Just know your limits with both from talkative to talking shit.

				Modafinil is the one drug that gives you a confidence boost without acting all jittery. Try it. <br />Bottom line: it can make you a little insensitive and / or easily irritable.

				Yeah if you are combining something with alcohol it will have to be an upper. Like the other person said, a small amount of cocaine every so often works. Personally I go with a bit of stimulant medication like adderall or ritalin because I find it easier to swallow a pill than bump lines throughout the night. Not that I&#039;m saying that adderall + alcohol is the safest, but in my experience you don&#039;t even need that much adderall/ritalin to give you that extra &quot;confidence&quot; boost. I know taking adhd medication might sound lame but it&#039;s the easiest solution for me. All of the nights that I have done a bit of adderall before a night of drinking everyone the next day says that I was &quot;so funny&quot; last night .. which is in comparison to the nights where I only drink and am therefore a stupid mess.

				Mephedrome should do the trick, It did help me few times and also it&#039;s a cheaper alternative to coke. If you have the money just go for coke.

				yes to the coke, that would be the top of the list<br /><br />oddly enough, for me, painkillers give me a burst of energy and make me talkative, however i do tend to crash after the 1.5-2hr burst of energy, so expect a nod effect, also, if u arent a rager like me, take it easy on the amount of alcohol with the pk&#039;s otherwise ull yak<br /><br />dont know much else to pick, xcept for pure amph, addies and other sripts for add, but they will come at a cost, staying up later than u probably want<br /><br />

				Dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA.<br /><br />When it comes to confidence, nothing beats amphetamines.<br /><br />Cocaine is good but the effect doesn&#039;t last long enough.

				I gotta agree with the use of amphetamines here. You don&#039;t even have to go crazy and get all tweaky for a confidence boost either. Just a low, threshold dosage should do. 20-50mg of MrFire&#039;s speed makes me feel like a fucking confidence machine,

				Why would you presume the drink alone will not do the trick?<br /><br />Perhaps you can have a double vodka-redbull (or two) before the event, which may just make you as chatty as the rest of the group. <br /><br />Obviously something like cocaine could help your presence and confidence, but so could a good combination of caffeine and alcohol in many cases. Vodka and redbull are just the typical combination favoured by youth, but you might was well have a couple of proper irish coffees if those are more to your taste.

				MDMA at low doses isn&#039;t that obvious that you&#039;re on something.&nbsp; 50mg would probably be plenty to shed your self-image and open up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t use coke so I don&#039;t know but I hear that works as well.&nbsp; 50mg of MDMA will last you 3-4 hours though and you&#039;ll be excessively sociable.&nbsp; I can handle my M pretty well even at 200mg and not appear fucked up, depends on how you react to the drug.

				I thought they called it liquid confidence for a reason. When I find myself drinking with old friends (I rarely drink anymore) I usually take a threshold dose of (if you know me this won&#039;t surprise you)&nbsp; LSD. :) It helps me stay engaged in conversations without actually tripping, and I find it helps me handle my liquor a touch less like the cheap date I now am.

				The best drug for confidence is one that will help you confront your anxiety issues, not just make you talkative only as long as you&#039;re high on it. A psychedelic trip with a focus beforehand on repairing anxiety would probably do wonders for you, but the alcohol alone or a small dose of lucy would be good for the night.

				^ This, I&#039;d be worried that you&#039;d only feel you&#039;re able to socialize if you&#039;re on coke.&nbsp; <br /><br />MDMA for me did kind of make a big hole in my anxiety issues.&nbsp; I feel social interaction is much more fluid since I started rolling again, but I can now sort of meet people and break the ice much smoother without drugs thanks to a few nights where I pondered if my anxiety really was that people were judging me or I was convincing myself of this.&nbsp; Turns out, it&#039;s all in my head, and I am a likeable person.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not quitting MDMA for good, it&#039;s too fun, but it&#039;s good to reflect on nights after using it and tell myself &quot;see?&nbsp; You&#039;re holding yourself back all along&quot;<br /><br />
