				Is it possible to dose mescaline gradually? Start with 100, then another 100 and so on? Is there a window for re-dosing and if so, how long?<br /><br />reason I&#039;m asking is because I&#039;ve read mescaline causes tachycardia to some degree, and I&#039;ve had some uncomfortable episodes with weed and tachycardia +painful palpitations (although I seem to be able to take everything else without any issues). so I was thinking of starting gradually and work my way up. i don&#039;t want to end up with a weak/annoying trip and a waste of mescaline though...

				Hey, yeah unlike with the typtamines like psilocybin and LSD there seems to be an extended dosing window with mescaline, so it is fine to gradually dose over a few hours if you want to ease into the come up, should make it easier on the stomach also. Bear in mind it will extend the total time you are under the influence though. One word of advice based on personal experience would be to careful smoking cannabis while on mescaline if you have had issues before, but I think you&#039;ll be fine, mescaline is pretty benign stuff even at high doses.

				There is only one good way for a decent and economic trip, with every psychedelic. Take the desired dose all at once. Marijuana induced tachykardia does not mean you will get tachykardia on a classic psychedelic. I had the same issue some years ago, where marijuana was giving me &quot;bad trips&quot; but I could trip on psychedelics without presence of any of these symptoms. In my opinion, mesc is very gentle for the body, just don&#039;t let your mind freak out as it will affect your body and might be a source of panic attack.
