				So I started out with a single 50mg bubalbital (iirc how it&#039;s spelled) pill with some caffeine and apap as well. It was going pretty nice, and about 45 minutes in, I decided to smoke some crack. I measured out 21mg (don&#039;t judge me, I measure out everything), and smoked it very effectively. It was extremely pleasant and there was minimal comedown effects. About another 45 minutes later, I smoked 16mg of heroin, which was more effective than usual. Eventually it was time for bed, and I was having difficulty sleeping (always do with heroin for some reason), and so I took 1mg Lorazepam.<br /><br />It really was quite a great combination, but what did I do to my brain? Is this something I should keep as a favorite combo, or was this one particularly dangerous for some reason? I know at the very least that depressants combined with stimulants can be dangerous, and that I could have taken enough depressants to decrease my lung function...

				Just to clarify for people, experientially, this was an absolutely amazing combination. The euphoria of both the crack and the heroin were potentiated, and the comedown from both was minimized. I think I&#039;ll have to do some more research into potential interactions, though; there might be more going on that I should know about...

				You should always be careful mixing White and brown, however it seems as though you took them in intervals, leaving time between the two which is safer. Another risk using benzos with heroin but I think most users do it at some time or other. I find it difficult sleeping on opiates too and often use restoril to come down.

Fioricet dosages are usually like 4 of the pills and I only took one, and then both of the other two were slightly lower than my typical dosages. My main concern was that my breathing would become too depressed, but that issue didn&#039;t seem to arrive. Personally didn&#039;t enjoy taking white and brown at the same time previously. =P
