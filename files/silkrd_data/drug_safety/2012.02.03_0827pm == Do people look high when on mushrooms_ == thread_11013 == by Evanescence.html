				What do people seem like during a trip?&nbsp; <br /><br />For example on alcohol/weed most you can tell most people seem impaired or high in some way.<br /><br />On the other hand I&#039;ve seen a lot of people on opiates or coke who could totally pass for normal.<br /><br />How about the shrooms?

				It depends how hard your shrooming. I have gone to parties and people didnt know until we told them, and they thought we were lying. There have also been times when I cant look at anyone without busting out laughing, that and having the biggest shit eating grin in the world.

				Enlarged pupils can give it away, otherwise if you ask them nonsensical questions they can sometimes really be stumped, which I think is hilarious.

				Really depends on the person and their experience with them. Dose will also be a major factor. On a gram or two I know people who pass as normal, but when you are up in the three or four gram range it will definitely be harder.<br /><br />Major factor to me is the technological confusion that sets in on shrooms. I can carry a conversation while flowing freely through the time dilation, but hand me a smartphone or a TV remote and I&#039;m stuck staring at it or pressing things for no apparent reason.&nbsp; <br /><br />First time users would no doubt be spotted. Expect a smile slapped across your face throughout the trip as you stare at your hands, get lost in thought, and otherwise trip out.<br /><br />After eating mushrooms you may also look &quot;too happy&quot; for some situations.<br /><br />

				a couple grams say 1 - 2 you will look fine. say 5+ you will look Spun out. Pupils will be huge. From looking at my friends who take 4 or 5+ grams of mushrooms you can easily tell. I think it would be kinda hard to hide<br /><br />*My Head is feeling like a Frisbee*

				1-2 grams should be fine. 3+ is when they will run into problems.<br />Obvious eye dilation. <br />Losing themselves in music.<br />Not being able to handle things. (electronics, money, etc)<br />Losing focus on topics. <br />Etc

				This also depends on how much time you spend with an observer and their knowledge of visible symptoms.<br />I&#039;ve had many encounters with people that have had no idea that I was tripping, including my parents back in the day. However, most of these have been relatively short (less than 10 minutes) and involved simple, day-to-day conversations. <br /><br />My personal pitfall is when I start to forget about previous parts of a conversation (and this is usually above 3 grams, anything less I can usually handle) and start to go in circles, leading to &quot;WTF&quot; looks on everyone&#039;s faces, real or imagined. <br /><br />Of course, everyone is different. I know people who are hilariously obvious on a half eighth as well as people who&#039;ve had well over 3 grams with no sign at all.

				Serious? Let me talk to them for 90 seconds and I&#039;ll tell you what they&#039;re on more accurately than a piss test. Especially if they&#039;re tripping. People who are tripping make this face:&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; and if you start looking up at the sky or the ceiling, they will look up too (most people do anyway), but they&#039;ll look too long. <br /><br />Some skeevy drug addict staring at the ceiling for several minutes and making this face&nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;some skeevy drug addict on some skeevy hallucinogens

				I experience something very interesting in this matter: anybody who is on mushrooms has (in my perception) somehow a slightly mean and deceitful aspect in his face and appearance. Not in a malicious or evil way but roguishly and &quot;gobblinish&quot;. It&#039;s hard to describe... Imagine the pure essence of black humor!<br /><br />Some people already appeared to me in this way long before my first mushroom trip (but i was doing acid...). During my first time on shrooms I recognized the same appearance on my own face, and suddenly understood that all those people with that look were probably doing shrooms. I never experienced this with other drugs.<br /><br />Really interesting about the whole story is that several friends of mine experienced exactly the same.<br /><br />Obviously this &quot;mushroom-look&quot; is only visible for people with psychedelic experiences, and not to normal ones. Hrhrhr....

				I find, unless someone KNOWS you, you are just another weirdo out there.<br />I&#039;m pretty weird to begin with, so I can pass in almost any situation.<br />My 17th birthday we went to Canada&#039;s wonderland on a school trip, so we dropped acid when we got to the gates.<br />Rollercoasters on acid is about the most fun I&#039;ve ever had tripping.<br />When we got home I was still flying along, and had to sit down to supper with my parents and bros/sistahs for like an hour with my friend, who was also high as a kite.&nbsp; We were eating everything like chipmunks, little bites at a time, holding things with both hands.<br />We also put on those bignose/moustache glasses to protect us from being caught.&nbsp; LOL<br />My parents just though we were trying to be funny.<br />We couldn&#039;t look at each other though, or we&#039;d both grin like fuckers until we burst out laughing.<br /><br />I always FEEL like I&#039;m being watched when I&#039;m on psychs in public though.<br />I went to see Independence Day in theatres on LSD with my wife, and it was messed up.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t pay for anything.&nbsp; ANy time they asked me for money for the tickets or treats, I just pulled out a 20 and handed it them.&nbsp; Then they gave me change back.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to count!&nbsp; When I got the treats though, I almost walked away without the change.&nbsp; They probably just thought I was a burnout or something.<br /><br />When I see someone acting strange, I just think, what a burnout, or what a fucked up guy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t often think people are as high as I am.

				Since people don&#039;t seem to understand the implications of shit I say jokingly and just decide I&#039;m trolling or on drugs (I&#039;ve been told more than once that talking to me has a learning curve to Earthlings....), I&#039;ll explain my answer more thoroughly, since I was totally serious about the latent content even though the manifest content may have come across as excessively jovial: <br /><br /><br />. . . . I have to disagree, Sorry! . . . .<br />But my perspective might be useful to you once I reveal my assumption: I assume you&#039;re thinking of whether cops or some other authority figure (or other person who would cause you stupidly exaggerated problems if they caught you shrooming) can tell if you are shrooming .&nbsp; . . . . <br /><br />Here&#039;s The Thing .&nbsp; . . I haven&#039;t ever been a cop, but I know a lot of cops . .. And myself, I was a PI for a long time. Being a PI +&nbsp; the training I went thru to be a PI + the education I went through in college (that means &quot;UNIVERSITY&quot; for you brits!) = me being pretty good with reading people ... I&#039;ve confirmed that with cops I know. <br /><br />A lot of my PI work was with frauds related to injuries... Workers comp and personal injury and product liability and stuff like that .... basically insurance companies would give me cases that were suspected of fraud and I&#039;d investigate .... Taking statements, tailing, surveillance, whatever . . . . <br /><br /><br />The statements were the most revealing. You&#039;d be surprised how many people make fraudulent insurance claims based on fraud, itself based on drug addiction. Off the top of my head I would put the figure around 50-60%, literally ... Equally shocking : the CRAZY lengths people go to. The most extreme example I saw was a guy who got fifth degree burns (i.e., charred bone) from taking a blowtorch to his leg and blaming it on an accident that he obviously thought out in crazy detail. If the insurance company only had the recorded statement they would&#039;ve believed it, but I saw the torch and several other things that gave him away......... <br /><br />The big one?<br /><br />FUCK, I can spot an Oxy addict from fucking SATURN. <br /><br /><br />The same is true for police ... After just a month or so on the job you get so good at figuring shit like that out that it becomes natural. You can tell someone is drunk, right? Why do you suppose that is? It&#039;s because of experience seeing people drunk.<br /><br />Note that that is different than seeing people GET drunk. That&#039;s where the difference comes along here. . . Before I learned about profiling and worked as a PI and etc etc etc, I thought I was pretty good at looking at people and figuring out if they were stoned or something, but the thing is ... most of the people who were stoned, I knew they were stoned cus I sold them the dope or I was there to watch them smoke/snort/shoot the shit :D <br /><br />That is VERY different than being able to encounter someone under the influence and be able to tell it, and it all comes from experience. You&#039;ve seen drunk people in the world - frequently. Since it&#039;s super bowl night&nbsp; . ..&nbsp; think about a bar during a football game. Or basketball game. Or whatever. When The Game is on in the bar, you can tell who is drunk and just how drunk they are, on a totally instinctual level, right? <br /><br />Even to a really really low level...... Can&#039;t you tell when someone has had a glass of wine with dinner and another one beforehand? Just by some ineffable Gut Feeling from looking at them / talking to them / observing them?<br /><br />Why would the same not be true for shrooms or any other thing? ....... only because you don&#039;t frequently encounter people in The World who are shrooming as a regularass person... the people you see who you KNOW are shroooming are the ones who teach your unconscious mind what to look for, and those are all pre-determined . . .. <br /><br /><br />Point ? We can wax ecstatic about things like &quot;your pupils dilate&quot; (...true...but...can you REALLY see a small pupil dilation, like in someone who ate one cap or something?) and &quot;it depends on how much you&#039;re shrooming&quot; (lolno. when it comes to determining if a person is shrooming, they are or they aren&#039;t - it may be more obvious in a person who has taken 20g worth of caps like a retard but if you have seen enough people on enough different doses of shrooms you can tell just as much as THEY can tell), but such philosophizing is worthless.. . . . .<br /><br />See, my thinking was that the people who could cause you trouble = cops, cus I&#039;m a grownass man. I don&#039;t have to deal with parents/middle school teachers/big brothers/whatever figuring out if I&#039;m shrooming any more . . . . . . Back when I *did* have to deal with that (granted it was high school teachers =P) I was either A-taking shrooms with the person (e.g., older brother) or B-not fucking stupid enough to talk to my parents or go to school while shrooming . . .. . . <br /><br />COPS on the other hand ....They can show up when-the-fuck-ever and beat you with sticks and throw you in the Rapetogon for a Cage Match.......... Of RAPE. The cops I&#039;m friends with are all great dudes (yes, all dudes) and they are awesome to hang out with and they too smoke dope and take shrooms and toot cane and etc etc etc ..... They are people too.... But .... ... ... .. Think about Stanfords prison experiment (look it up if you don&#039;t know about it). Cops accept their roles and the power goes to their heads while they are on the job - just like you. But they come from the same world you do! Think about it. It&#039;s not the straight edge fuckers that become cops - they don&#039;t identify with that world at all. It&#039;s the fuckers you are smoking dope and dropping cid with and shit. Because they live in that world already, y&#039;know? <br /><br />So they go INTO it already knowing *exactly* what someone on shrooms looks like......... And over time, they hone that in ways specific to their jobs. What do I mean by that? Well...... think about it, how frequently does someone call the cops on a person who is shrooming..? It&#039;s usually only people who are ridiculously out of hand, if at all. It&#039;s not like PCP where it makes you get up and wander around shouting at people - people who are shrooming responsibly (e.g., not the guy taking 20g like a dummin) are still in their minds. They are OBVIOUSLY tripping fucking nuts but ......... Not causing any trouble. Think about it - have YOU ever wanted to cause trouble on shrooms? Like, uh, at ALL? Even if you have taken a dose that has put you out of your mind, you aren&#039;t violently out of your mind....... At least I&#039;ve never seen that.<br /><br />So cops have no use for telling if you&#039;re on some small amount of shrooms....... But if you are out of your mind to the point where cops come ...... &quot;Shrooms&quot; doesnt matter. Neither does &quot;tripping&quot; . . . The cop will probably know youre on drugs, but even if he thinks you&#039;re just loony it doesn&#039;t matter. It often comes way after the fact - their goal (believe it or not) is to stop you from hurting yourself or someone else ..... What you&#039;re on doesn&#039;t matter, be it psychotropics or just plain old Crazy. Goal = stop you. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Kay so to reduce this to nothing more than a simple answer to the question in the subject line . . . . . . . Do people look high on weed? On booze? On Xanax? It depends what you mean by &quot;high&quot; - not in the traditional sense of &quot;duh I&#039;m gonna stare at my belly button and discuss what the meaning of &#039;is&#039; is&quot; but in the sense that NOBODY FUCKING CARES IF YOU&#039;RE HIGH IF YOU&#039;RE NOT DANGEROUS. <br /><br />&quot;Dangerous&quot; is a very elastic concept. Those high school teachers I was talking about occasionally cared when I rolled into class high as shit but they didn&#039;t REALLY care except in situations where I was a dummin doing dummin things like sleeping through a double-period HL IB Physics class while sitting in the front row. . .&nbsp; That is stupid as fuck. <br /><br />The teacher cared about me being stupid as fuck. The obvious smell of weed on my clothes/hair/butt was just the cause of that stupidity. It was all but completely irrelevant....<br /><br />Think about AMURKAH. AMURKAH wants you to drink. Yes they do. Really. Because ever since there have been people, people have been unwinding. This is an absolutely necessary part of the human condition. If you don&#039;t let people blow off steam at all .................... Bad things happen. I&#039;d go into what kind of bad things but you already know. . . Probably .&nbsp; . . I hope . . . .<br /><br />Anyway we&#039;ve known that to be a necessity forever, and since the US is a puritanical society like all other God-fearing nations, the US looks down on Gettin Fucked Up. But it is tolerated. And because it&#039;s a necessity, it is encouraged that you take part in ALCOHOL. <br /><br />And nobody fucking gives a fucking shit at fucking all-thefuck. <br /><br /><br />UNTIL ..... your dumb ass gets wasted and tries to drive. <br /><br /><br />But then the problem *isn&#039;t that you&#039;re drunk*.&nbsp; &nbsp;. . .. . The problem is that you are DRIVING drunk . . . <br /><br />Very thin line but very important.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So do people look high on shrooms? ......You already knew the answer to that question before asking it, by simple virtue of you asking: Yes of course they do, if you&#039;re looking for it. <br /><br />Goal? DONT MAKE ANYONE LOOK FOR IT. <br /><br /><br />You can get away with walking around being on nearly anything if you shut the fuck up and walk straight . . . <br /><br />Be governed accordingly.

				haha this is a funny question. I laughed when I read it. mainly because it reminded me my first trip. I was on a snowboard trip with a few friends and my buddy had a few grams of blue meanies (awesome type of shroom by the way). and one night while in the hotel, a few of my friends went night boarding, and my buddy and I decided to stay back in the room and take shrooms without telling any of the other guys. well, when they returned, we were tripping face and they DEFINITELY knew *something* was up when they came back. haha. mainly because the room was rearranged&nbsp; ;D ;D and my buddy had a large pee stain down his pants . hahaha. in mid trip, he went to go piss, and half way through he thought he was done, so he zippered up without even realizing it. then he spent the next half hour staring into the mirror (which is fucking insane while tripping - your face just morphs) and he came back out and I noticed a large wet area on his pants, and was like, &quot;what the hell happened to you??&quot;, and he responded, &quot;ah, shit, I forgot I was still peeing...&quot;. hahahah oh boy. the memories. <br /><br />welp, I just I&#039;d share that funny story to everyone. hope you guys enjoyed it!&nbsp; 8) 8) 8)

I was on a snowboard trip with a few friends and my buddy had a few grams of blue meanies (awesome type of shroom by the way). and one night while in the hotel, a few of my friends went night boarding, and my buddy and I decided to stay back in the room and take shrooms without telling any of the other guys. well, when they returned, we were tripping face and they DEFINITELY knew *something* was up when they came back. haha. mainly because the room was rearranged&nbsp; ;D ;D and my buddy had a large pee stain down his pants . hahaha. in mid trip, he went to go piss, and half way through he thought he was done, so he zippered up without even realizing it. then he spent the next half hour staring into the mirror (which is fucking insane while tripping - your face just morphs) and he came back out and I noticed a large wet area on his pants, and was like, &quot;what the hell happened to you??&quot;, and he responded, &quot;ah, shit, I forgot I was still peeing...&quot;. hahahah oh boy. the memories. <br /><br />welp, I just I&#039;d share that funny story to everyone. hope you guys enjoyed it!&nbsp; 8) 8) 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow what the fuck mate lol ;D. That sounds more messed up than that episode of family guy where brian takes shrooms and cut&#039;s his ear off to prevent World War 2 lmao. <br />Been thinking about taking LSD but I might just stay away from shrooms for a the time being lol

				Most people grow a large horn from the middle of the forehead...<br /><br />No really unless the trip is really intense, you can generally pull yourself together - eg if you need to talk to someone, who doesn&#039;t look like he&#039;ll approve.&nbsp; Talking to police might freak you out and that horn will pop up.

				you can really tell you&#039;re a weirdo like me and like to see walls make waves by pushing against them while tripping.&nbsp; kinda reminds me of the matrix when you can see the concrete liquifying/rippling right before neo takes flight.&nbsp; &nbsp;
