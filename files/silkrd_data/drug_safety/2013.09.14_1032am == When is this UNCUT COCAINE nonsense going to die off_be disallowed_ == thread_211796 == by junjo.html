				I was looking through the top cocaine listings on here the other day, and they are truly sad. Literally about 50% of the stuff I came across has &quot;UNCUT&quot; explicitly at some point in the description. By uncut, you are telling me that you are selling 100% pure cocaine powder (maybe 95% from extraction impurities) which is absolute nonsense. From the second it is extracted in South America, unless you have the most amazing connection with a local farmer there, or you are making this shit from coca leaves themselves, the cocaine WILL BE cut at some point by the cartels. Are the majority of coke buyers here really that deluded?<br /><br />And even for the listings, that don&#039;t claim uncut, there are obscene purities listed (90-98%, which never happens), &quot;fishscale&quot; nonsense as a claim for quality (levamisole can contribute to the &quot;fish-scale&quot; appearence), and also various buzzwords like &quot;hi-heat&quot; and &quot;acetone washed&quot; which really don&#039;t accomplish anything. <br /><br />Props to the vendors who are taking the &quot;not gonna lie, our stuff is cut&quot; approach, because that not only takes integrity, but could actually be a detriment to your sales given the ignorance of some buyers here.<br /><br />If someone has tested their coke with HPLC, NMR etc. and gotten 90%+ purity for the coke they&#039;ve obtained here, by all means show me, and I will be purchasing from that vendor ASAP. But for now I shall remain completely skeptical, and not waste my hard earned money on $130/g livestock dewormer.

				You didn&#039;t really expect truth in advertising on SR did you? I don&#039;t think the outrageous purity claims will stop anytime soon because they appear to be effective at moving product. Having said that, the testing thread did have some samples that came in over 80% which is really good. Unfortunately, vendors are only as good as their latest batch and consistent quality in the coke trade seems to be rare.<br /><br />It&#039;s really a testament to cocaine that it has remained so popular, when most of what&#039;s sold to users has been cut to shit with all kinds of garbage for decades.

Plenty of other folks have made the same point as you. I agree that it would have been better if the lab report had been published, but, even then, they could have been forged. Again, we&#039;re on SR here. I actually do think PL was sending in samples to the labs as he said, but that&#039;s just my opinion. Most of the sample results were terrible and consistent with every other published data I&#039;ve seen on this subject. Only a handful came in as over 80% with no active cuts.<br /><br />I wish there were similar lab services in the US. ecstasydata.org will test samples for content but is not allowed to publish percentages. As a &quot;real&quot; chemist, perhaps you know of other options.

				Sadly, there aren&#039;t any options unless you know a really shady research prof or someone with unlimited access to one of these machines.<br />I work in a lab at my university, but I highly doubt I&#039;d just be able to bring in bags of cocaine and test it in the GC/MS.

				Oh wow, just found out for the first time that people say 84% pure because it&#039;s sold as MDMA HCl and the HCl accounts for 16% of it&#039;s mass.<br />This is so wrong lmao.<br />Your final product goal is always MDMA HCl, you don&#039;t sell the freebase.<br />Your MDMA HCl is 100% pure, not 84%.<br />It&#039;s like saying that ketamine or cocaine have a maximum purity of X because they&#039;re also HCl salts, nobody ever says that!!!!<br />Drug dealer chemistry sure is funny sometimes.<br />Sigh....

I&#039;ll take all the negative karma I get as a compliment, because it just shows that the scum are too clueless to talk science with me, and instead resort to admonishing me with the click of a button, lowering an arbitrary score that I never really cared about in the first place.<br /><br />And it&#039;s interesting to hear about the forensic labs option. I&#039;ll have to investigate that more. Thanks for the info.

Literally about 50% of the stuff I came across has &quot;UNCUT&quot; explicitly at some point in the description. By uncut, you are telling me that you are selling 100% pure cocaine powder (maybe 95% from extraction impurities) which is absolute nonsense. From the second it is extracted in South America, unless you have the most amazing connection with a local farmer there, or you are making this shit from coca leaves themselves, the cocaine WILL BE cut at some point by the cartels. Are the majority of coke buyers here really that deluded?<br /><br />And even for the listings, that don&#039;t claim uncut, there are obscene purities listed (90-98%, which never happens), &quot;fishscale&quot; nonsense as a claim for quality (levamisole can contribute to the &quot;fish-scale&quot; appearence), and also various buzzwords like &quot;hi-heat&quot; and &quot;acetone washed&quot; which really don&#039;t accomplish anything. <br /><br />Props to the vendors who are taking the &quot;not gonna lie, our stuff is cut&quot; approach, because that not only takes integrity, but could actually be a detriment to your sales given the ignorance of some buyers here.<br /><br />If someone has tested their coke with HPLC, NMR etc. and gotten 90%+ purity for the coke they&#039;ve obtained here, by all means show me, and I will be purchasing from that vendor ASAP. But for now I shall remain completely skeptical, and not waste my hard earned money on $130/g livestock dewormer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey, I agree.

I&#039;m quite sure no one here has access to GC/MS, but I want to ask before you know...I forget alcohols in excess oxygen with a spark is highly exothermic&nbsp; ::) ::) ::) ::) ::)

				Its easy t get coke lab tested. Easy and not expensive, depending on the nation and your connections of course&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I can get coke lab tested - the machine that tests is somne specialised piece of gadgetry, plus there are lots of new reagent tests out there for differing cuts coming out. In 5 yrs the average citizen will be able to test coke with as much accuracy as the current top of the line testing equipment. Not the airport machines - they are good but can misread - anything found there is further analysed. A better machine tests it.<br /><br />So, even this last few weeks, I&#039;ve tested a few cokes out, mainly UK vendors, some Germans and the inevitable American because American gets a LOT of pretty pure coke shifted there! Tons a day a railed. Tons a day need to be smuggled to all states and every last little hick town.<br /><br />But on SR, a vendor is only as good as the current batch!<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought maybe 5 grams off different UK vendors and found one to be so bad it had to be flushed. The vendor advised me to eiother go through resolution (vendors know customers with good stats hate stats being hit) or take 40% payment back - his profit apparently. So, I took the 40% which ended up like 28 quid. The gram was almost 110 UK pounds. Vendor needs a calculator. (there is one on every computer)<br /><br />So - be VERY wary of UK vendors - EZ testing the coke might mean you have to go through resolution which is a pain in the ass. Your stats will be hit - but the vendors will also as I&#039;m going to 1/5 whoever sent me the phenacetine cut coke. They asked me leave 5/5 for the 40%, I agreed, but given they advertised &#039;pure uncut&#039; coke, I have no qualms about confessing my side of the story.<br /><br />Two sides of course, but I have the EZ test photo - and EZ test photos of other UK and American vendors. <br /><br />So, treat ALL claims of uncut coke with a pinch of salt. <br /><br />EZ test it all. Wash it if you can. Bear in mind some active cuts cannot be easily washed out. A/B extraction may do but I just enjoy the odd toot, I don&#039;t want to wear rubber gloves and be a scientist just to get high!!<br /><br />Dr Cols coke EZ tested fine<br /><br />Meerkova also, plus I think that was the best UK so far.<br /><br />Lloyds, depends on the batch. My last one was fine, but a mates buy was not as good. EZ tested ok but was maybe 70% ish.<br /><br />Others? Waiting to see.
