				I find it interesting watching people what they do after they smoke ice, it seems the most varied reactions:<br /><br />After smoking, I probably do the most common thing - drink heavily<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - go dancing<br />But sometimes it makes me very mellow, and I do thing like just read,&nbsp; paint pictures, tonight I am raving on messaging<br /><br />My ex-wife she becomes very quiet and just listens to quite music, or reads, but sometimes she robs me at cards (she is Thai and the rules change every time), but she likes generally likes peace and often does housework (even at my house!)<br /><br />Her girlfriends play cards and talk or go dancing.<br /><br />My real-life vendor either sings karoake or thinks he is god or everyone in the world should work for him to implement his grand scheme.<br /><br />I think it all depends on the mode when you start, it seems to help you focus, I sometimes need to work 36 hrs and a few puffs definetely helps (no dangerous materials or animals involved), it allows you to focus, whereas when I work normally about 30 minutes in enough and I am distracted.<br />\<br />About the only things I havent seen is anyone sleeping or eating.<br />

				I go to work on meth ( or another amphetamine, but mainly meth lately) every night if I can help it. It really ramps up productivity. Plus I work nights and my job requires manual labor, sometimes intense, so I pretty much own that place every shift, lol. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend smoking for work though, sniff or swallow. I personally mix it into a bottle of water (go-juice!) so I can control my dosage as the night goes on, plus nothing weird about drinking water, keeps you from having to run to the bathroom whenever you need a little boost. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got so many employee of the month shirts I started giving them away to other people that I feel are doing a good job too. Funny shit is no one gets it, supervisors an shit just think I&#039;m like really dedicated or something and they love me for it. Still I bet ya I wouldn&#039;t have that job much longer if I just blurted out one night, yeah I&#039;m doing a great job cause I&#039;m high on meth every night muthafucker! Lol.

				Yeah, I normally use methamphetamine before going to work. The more often I use it though, the less I do while I&#039;m on it. Sometimes I&#039;ll just smoke meth all day and sit at the computer playing Who Wants To Be A Millionaire &amp; The Price is Right on Facebook or lurking these forums.. ;)<br /><br />I used to not be able to sit still when I used meth, it would drive me crazy. Now it sort of keeps me sitting still. I dunno.

I know right? I was thinking the same thing. shit, I don&#039;t think I know one other person who does meth. granted, I&#039;m on the far east coast, and to be honest, meth hasn&#039;t really &quot;gotten&quot; here yet - if that makes any sense. and I just recently graduated college, so I&#039;m, by no means, &quot;old&quot;&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; heroin is huge though. half of my social network has either used heroin excessively or has at least tried it. meth, no one really. I dunno if that is a good thing or a bad thing though. give it a year or two, I think. maybe the younger generations will feel much more comfortable with it than mine (the irony being that my generation was comfortable as shit with H, but not meth. hah)
