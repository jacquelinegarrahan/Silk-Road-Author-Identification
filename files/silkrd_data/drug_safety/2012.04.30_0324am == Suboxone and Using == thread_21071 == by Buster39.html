				I have a slight issue. I have been on suboxone for a good bit, to the point I withdrawl and get some nasty fucking restless legs. Well sometimes I want to get high of course and will wait like 3 days do a blue and bam nothing. I have waited up to 5 or so day and still really dont feel it. <br /><br />I have 2 questions&#039;<br /><br />1. would I be able to avoid the withdrawls if say the moments I start feeling shitty I do a blue. I continue this 1 -2 blues a day for 5 days till the worst of the suboxone shit passes. Will I still withdrawl of the blues then? I know it seems stupid and the suboxone w/d isnt that bad except the restless legs. It seriously drives me fucking crazy.<br /><br />2. Is there anyway to purge myself of the suboxone so I can get high sooner. <br /><br />

				Take less and less, get yourself down to 2mg a day only take at night, so if you get dope during the day you can get high, mix with benzos to intensify.&nbsp; And obove all get good dope. Been doing this for years always get a nod going.

				I took subs for years and finally got off them because for me they acted like a stimulant and would keep me awake for hours.. ugg<br />Anyway,<br />You could work yourself down to 2mg using the methods above.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, there&#039;s a couple of safe ways you can take it sublingually and get higher bioavailability out of the dose: crush sub with some strong vodka , forget the ratio.. use a cotton ball and dip it in the solution, then use (put under tongue, subling.) the cotton now doused in solution.&nbsp; I read something like this was originally one of the means of administration used during early testing of the Suboxone during trials.<br />You could also snort (insuffulate ) 2mg or less, crushed,&nbsp; to get more out of the dose and it might last longer as well. When I was tapering this way, I would follow up with benzos and it helped enough so that I could eventually get off subs entirely. Any regular sub dose over 2mg would tend to block a full agonist .<br />Hope this helps.

				It is very easy to get off sub. Get down to 2mg or less a day and take that for like 4 weeks so your body adjusts to that dose. Then spread that 2mg every other day for a couple weeks. Then just stop. After I did that the only issue I had was on the third day I just felt the want to take it but it really wasn&#039;t that bad at all. It is %90 mental over anything. Sub just blocks every good damn feeling other drugs give you. I couldn&#039;t even get drunk when I took that stuff. Didn&#039;t feel anything. Yea, while the sub saved my life it also is a two edge sword. Trust me, it isn&#039;t as bad as people say. All the horror stories you hear are from people that stop taking it from like 8mg dose. That&#039;s crazy. Just stick with it and stay away from those opiates! <br />
