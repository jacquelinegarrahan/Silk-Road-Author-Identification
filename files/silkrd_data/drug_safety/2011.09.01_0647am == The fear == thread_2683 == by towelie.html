				I smoked weed everyday all day from age 14-22.&nbsp; One night at a party I ripped quite a few 3&#039; ers and had a severe panic attack and I mean severe.&nbsp; I have tried it here and there over the years to see if anything changes&nbsp; but any more than 2 puffs and I think the whole world is out to get me.<br />My question is with all the different strains out there today are there any that are tried and true anxiolytics? <br />Anyone else have this issue and overcome it.<br />I would love to be able to smoke again without the weight of the world crushing my skull.&nbsp; :-[<br />Any advise is welcome.<br />Thanks

				Yes, paranoia can be a very scary experience. I recommend benzo&#039;s for when things get too much, but be warned they can also be a crutch.

				That&#039;s pretty much where I am as well, OP.&nbsp; Used to thoroughly enjoy it, but paranoia crept into my brain over the years to the point where the thought of smoking weed without a little chemical assistance creeps me the hell out.&nbsp; Really sucks, because I remember so well how much I loved it in my younger years.<br /><br />A couple of years ago my doctor prescribed me klonazepam for my anxiety/blood pressure, and it worked wonders.&nbsp; After a few days, I thought I&#039;d try to pick up the old bowl and see how it worked out under a benzo.&nbsp; And there it was - exactly how I remembered it - nice, relaxed weed high.&nbsp; <br /><br />One other thing that seems to help a little is to have a few beers in me before toking up.&nbsp; The anxiety is still there, but nowhere near as powerful.&nbsp; I do like the old &quot;one-two punch&quot; with alcohol and weed, but it&#039;s only for special occasions these days when amongst friends.

				Thanks for the feedback everyone. :D<br />I will check with some vendors and do some more research.<br />I&#039;ve taken Val and smoked and the fear still manages to creep in a little so maybe I try with Al see if that makes any difference.<br />Thanks again.
