				A large new government study has found that smoking marijuana on a regular basis, even over many years, does not impair lung function.<br /><br />The researchers followed more than 5,000 people over two decades and found that regularly smoking marijuana — the equivalent of up to a joint a day over seven years — did not impair performance on a lung function test. The test, a measure of pulmonary obstruction that looks at the amount of air a person can force out in one second after taking a deep breath, is typically worsened by smoking tobacco.<br /><br />In something of a twist, the researchers found that compared to nonsmokers, marijuana users performed slightly better on the lung function test...<br /><br />The researchers found that for marijuana smokers, an exposure of up to seven “joint years” — with one joint-year equivalent to smoking 365 joints or filled pipes, or an average of one joint a day for seven years — did not worsen pulmonary function.<br /><br />Dr. Donald Tashkin, a pulmonologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied marijuana for over 30 years and was not involved in the study, said it confirmed findings from several other studies showing “that essentially there is no significant relationship between marijuana exposure and impairment in lung function.”<br /><br />Dr. Tashkin said he and his colleagues had found in their own research — unexpectedly — that even smoking up to three joints a day did not appear to cause a decrease in lung function. “I think that the bottom line is that there does not appear to be any negative impact on lung function of marijuana smoking,” he said<br /><br />Reference:<br />http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/marijuana-smoking-does-not-harm-lungs-study-finds/<br /><br /><br />If your government has marijuana prohibition, then your government is Draconian!.<br />

				It&#039;s amazing how much evidence keeps coming out that marijuana is not harmful, yet governments continue to stand by their BS claims.&nbsp; Time for the US federal government to give it up already and at least legalize for medical purposes.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even a big fan of the effects of marijuana, but it&#039;s the most harmless drug I&#039;ve ever done in my life.&nbsp; Legalize the shit already and get it over with.&nbsp; We have too many people whose lives have been ruined by the LAWS against the plant.&nbsp; Ridiculous.
