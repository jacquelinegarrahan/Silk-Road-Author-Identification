				I got some hash from the Netherlands recently which has me wondering if it&#039;s even safe to smoke it.&nbsp; It feels more elastic than normal and has an unusual smell when burnt and a bad taste with a weak high.&nbsp; The smoke from it tastes a lot like if you smoke on the resin/tar that builds up in a bong over time, it&#039;s pretty awful and not like any hash I&#039;ve had before.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also it takes me a few bowls of it to get at all high, a few big hits don&#039;t do much.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t bothered putting any in joints because it tastes like ass with a bong.<br /><br />Is it common for people to mix in rubber or plastic with hash for whatever reason and then pass it off as high quality hash?&nbsp; Or is there a type of black squidgy hash that has these characteristics?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had crappy hash/soap bar before over the years but this stuff has me completely confused.&nbsp; Just from looking at it and smelling it you can&#039;t tell there&#039;s anything wrong with it but I&#039;m curious why it tastes so awful or what&#039;s been put in it.&nbsp; Should I even bother smoking it or just get rid of it?

				Unfortunatley adulterated hash can be a common problem.&nbsp; I have received hash from canda that fit your description. It was SHIT, highly unrecommended to smoke.

				Use a magnifying glass to watch how it reacts when heated with a lighter. If it bubbles at all when it meets a naked flame don&#039;t touch it. A plasticy taste is common and can indicate that it has been mixed with henna. <br /><br />You can also look at the colour of the smoke. It shouldn&#039;t be dark / black. Also, good hash / weed doesn&#039;t result in red-eye.

				Yeah, I smoke Soap Bar with lots of bits of plastic,<br />I leaves mine in it cause it tastes fantastic,<br />Skunk costs too much, I can’t see the appeal,<br />Than smoking Port Rocky, Soap Bar or Gold Seal,<br />Smoke Rocky in a bong, bucket or hot-knives,<br />Bake it in a cake for your Mam as a surprise,<br />I smokes Green, and it’s gone in an instant,<br />But Soap Bar lasts, cause it’s fucking consistent.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCC1puOWa3k
