				I&#039;m preparing for Bicycle Day (19/04) and I was thinking about some crazy trip. I&#039;m planning to do 100ug LSD + 120 mg MDMA + 1g of Shrooms and maybe some 2C-B on the comedown. What do you think about the dosages? What other crazy combos do you recommend? :D

				Funny you should say - I contemplated exactly that combination this last weekend, and ended up doing without the 2C-B, and with a mid-trip dose of mj.<br /><br />Depends on what you&#039;re used to, dosage-wise. I&#039;m new to mixing LSD and shrooms. On their own, I&#039;m likely to drop 360-450ug LSD or 4-5g of shrooms, so for this combo I did 270ug LSD and 2.5g shrooms (whole, dried) and it was a pretty fun ride. Then an unknown dose (pill) of MDMA at T+2 hours, 4 or 5 volcano bags of good quality mj at the T+4 hour mark, and finally another 90ug LSD and 2.3g shrooms at T+9. I was trying to be a little conservative since I was new to the mix.<br /><br />Your dosages seem a little light but again, depends on what you&#039;re used to. I figured I&#039;d want to do a little over half of my regular solo dose of LSD and shrooms when putting them together and was pretty happy with the result, so if you&#039;re tripping on 150-200ug LSD or 2g of shrooms, you might be working with a similar formula. It was an unexpectedly level-headed, lucid trip, maybe because I held off on the mj and didn&#039;t mix in any alcohol. I hear good things about tapering with the 2C-B and will certainly try that in future.

However I already tried different mix with acid and most of the times it was a crazy time. But your post made me reconsider my plans, thanks and +1 for you* :).<br /><br />* fuck, I&#039;m stoned and I&#039;m not sure if I just gave you +1... :P Even if so, after 72h you&#039;ll get another one, haha :D

				those doses sound perfect... but make sure to time the dosing out appropriately. this is critical! just recently i combined 300 Âµg lsd, 3 g shrooms, 250 mg mdma, ketamine and nitrous. i spaced each dose half an hour apart, taking 125 mg mdma and then redosing. everything meshed together perfectly and it was by far one of the most memorable trips i have had. complete ego dissolution and oneness with everything. i was pure bliss!

				My all-time favorite combo was 3 hits LSD + 18 mg 2C-P + 25 mg 2C-E. And I took .25 mg of alprazolam because I was afraid that I might tax my heart too much.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a huge fan of 2C-B, I think of it as a trippy version of MDMA. 2C-E takes the cake out of all the 2C&#039;s for me. I think it has far more versatility than 2C-B.
