				So I have yet to try this chem as the couple individuals that i know who HAVE ended up with enormous negative side effects... One committed suicide, the other went nearly insane... The thing is- they were using some un-labled &quot;bath salts&quot; which to the extent of our education we believed to be MDPV. Now im hearing some people promote others to try this chem saying some rather positive things, which aggravates me extensively due to my friends&#039; complications. Im also willing to consider the fact that maybe these people were just on a bad/dirty/other chem, and not pure MDPV. Reason im questioning this is because i am also seeing MDPV associated with Butylone. Ive done extensive research and testing on BK-MBDB (butylone) and enjoyed it thoroughly so am hoping people here may have some shared experiences or feedback to enrich me with!

				MDPV is the number one drug where you NEED to know everything about it before you fucking take it. No joke. Half of the time, I&#039;ll take a 5mg-10-mg bump and feel nice, social, focused, talking about everything, can type paragraphs about the stupidest topics, etc. Other times I&#039;ll either eyeball the wrong amount in the first place, or re-dose too quickly. This is the most important thing because it&#039;s so easy to take too much seeing how potent it is in such small quantities. There&#039;d be times where I could barely control my sanity. Even doing a little more than intended can ruin your whole day, this, for me, includes: toe cramps, horrible anxiety, paranoia (when no one&#039;s home, i&#039;d think someone&#039;s hiding in my house so i&#039;d pretend i&#039;m doing normal stuff), muscle tension, thinking i&#039;m going to have a heart attack, sleep deprivation of re-dosing, extremely bad twitching of muscles, feeling hot, nausea, hungry but unable to eat, i&#039;ve gotten itchy bumps all over different parts of my body that looked like mosquito bites from destroying my immune system not eating while on this. there was a reflection of the window on my floor from the sun shining, and i thought i saw two squirrels playing, then looked at the actual window, and, nothing. my curtains looked like a big pencil case holding crayons which were my blinds. i saw leaves fall around my room. anxiety would get so bad i couldn&#039;t look people in the eyes, thinking my pupils were huge but i knew they always weren&#039;t, was cold one morning so you could see everyone&#039;s breath but had to ask my friends if it was real, i wouldn&#039;t be able to handle conversations, thinking there was no emotion in my voice or that everyone thought i was a drug addict and it made me feel ashamed, laughing at the stupidest shit for 15 minutes, hallucinations and psychosis came from lack of sleep and constant re-dosing up to 3 days with 30 minutes of sleep. you just NEED to know accurate doses, never underestimate it and do a ton of research.

				Mdpv is a beautiful drug. It&#039;s can induce psychosis very quickly and i wouldn&#039;t recommend trying without benzos on hand. It can make you suicidal on the comedown. People have killed themselves from the use of this drug. (I haven&#039;t found any reports where the drugs was the cause. I&#039;m referring to suicides that weren&#039;t caused by overdose.) <br /><br />If you haven&#039;t played with stimulants extensively, i wouldn&#039;t recommend mdpv. Because, it&#039;s highly effective at doing what it does. It makes you feel on top of the world and gives you one of the biggest rushes I&#039;ve ever had. (From smoking) It can also cause you to become delusional, psychotic, and suicidal. It normally takes me about five days to hit full blown psychosis off meth. I can hit full blown psychosis off mdpv in as little as two days. <br /><br />So if you have problems with binging, i wouldn&#039;t recommend. But, nothing anyone told me stopped me from trying mdpv or stopped me from smoking mdpv and i don&#039;t regret it.

				MDPV is for professionals only but i have some friends who are 21 and still puppies yet and so far so good although my experience tellls me that they have alot of the typical and inevitable cliches and disasters ahead that come with doing drugs for the wrong reasons.&nbsp; Firstly, if you are planning on doing Meth any more don&#039;t do MDPV, it will make you immune to it, it is 5 to 10 X stronger and everyone I know even the lifer&#039;s are pissed because PV is hard to get and their ol reliable is useless now.&nbsp; I just tried some various HIGH-Grade meth after being a PV guy for 3 years and I hate to say, that I am no longer able to get high from meth.&nbsp; Anyways, MDPV is EUPHORIA and SPEED in it&#039;s every aspect MAXED OUT!&nbsp; It is not responsible for any psychosis or any deaths so don&#039;t beleive that shit, the only thing that will cause that is YOU.&nbsp; I hate when people go all Reefer&nbsp; Madness and cite misleading propganda they hate themselves and essentially&nbsp; Dis their own philosophies and morals.&nbsp; No there hasn&#039;t been official research on PV, but i&#039;ve done some extreme tests and for me an average in every way guy in his early 30&#039;s... I found that PV is a powerful FORCE not a drug.&nbsp; If it sounds like Adderal, Coke and Meth are your thing or are sometimes too much for you don&#039;t do more than a 1/4 g of pv.

				I ordered 250mg from SR after a brief look at the history of the drug, etc. After I&#039;d placed my order I stumbled upon some reviews - none were good (to say the least). Unfortunately the vendor had already dispatched the drug when I asked him to toss my order and I would finalize as a thanks. Thankfully I knew the dangers of this drug when it arrived, but I shudder to think what might&#039;ve happened had I had a big line like cocaine... I did try it, but even in fractional doses it wasn&#039;t a good experience so I gave it away to some junkie friends of a friend (and when I say junkie, I mean the real scum junkies that will take anything), well, they literally gave it back they hated it that much. After that I binned it, something I should have done the day it arrived.<br /><br />Simply put, stay the fuck away from this shit.

				I wouldn&#039;t advise it.&nbsp; I had some of drpvmd&#039;s stuff over the summer, and one night I went on a little bender.&nbsp; Had about 5 small lines over the course of a few hours.&nbsp; Obviously that was reckless, but I had tried it a few times, and it&#039;s so hard not to redose.&nbsp; That drug made me feel like a straight up junkie.&nbsp; I had never experienced such total powerlessness till I tried MDPV.&nbsp; That night, my pupils were fucking frisbee-size, my body was shaking, I was sweating profusely, and was dangerously flirting with paranoid delusions.&nbsp; I honestly can say my brain has never been the same.&nbsp; Pretty sure that shit is super neurotoxic, or perhaps the exorbitant amount I did in one night is to blame.
