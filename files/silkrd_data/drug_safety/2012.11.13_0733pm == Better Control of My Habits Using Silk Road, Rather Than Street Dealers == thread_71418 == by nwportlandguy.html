				Has anybody else had a way easier time controlling their serious hard drug habits (cocaine, heroin, meth) using Silk Road, instead of having real life dealers a phone call away?&nbsp; FOr me, SR has become the only way I can use my favorite chemicals without fucking up my life completely.&nbsp; For me, that moment of addict thinking, when you&#039;re thinking about dipping into the grocery money to stay high, always starts when I run out.&nbsp; And if there is any option at all to get more within a few hours I will compulsively/impulsively do it without thinking it through, and be totally poor and strung out before I know it.&nbsp; SR actuakky forces me to plan ahead and actually accept it when the drugs are gone.&nbsp; &nbsp;This was very difficult for me, before I moved to a town with no hook-ups and kept it that way. Now, with only SR as an option, get generally bette quality, and I hafta want at least a day( usually3-5) before I&#039;m getting jack.&nbsp; For me the inflated prices on some stuff (especiallyC and H) are worth it, because I would spend a ton more if I had a dealer in my town, even with shittier product.&nbsp; I have less fun, and spend way more money.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I love Silk Road, it&#039;s an easy choice for me!&nbsp; &nbsp;Please hurry, DPR (safely, of course).<br />Does anybody else have a way more normal drug experience with vendors instead of dealers?&nbsp; It seems like many would benefit... all of us who are quite ready to quit totally , but maybe moving in that direction?<br /><br /><br />mods, if I should have put this in an existing thread, I apologize.&nbsp; Please move it.

				I have to agree with SR somewhat keeping my tendencies in check. Things spiraled out of control at one point in my life but fortunately I&#039;m okay now and rarely touch any substances. Using SR forces me to plan things out to get shipments in time before concerts, having parties, etc. There isn&#039;t a constant supply coming in either because of the amount of effort it takes to get orders in, the amount of time it takes to get bitcoins and I&#039;d obviously be very poor, very quickly. What I do like the most is that I know what I am getting, unlike when buying things like MDMA and LSD on the street where it could be a range of terrible things that aren&#039;t what I thought they were. If the Silkroad were a local marketplace, I&#039;d be fucked. I know the attractive prices and for the most part extremely high quality drugs are definitely a problem for some users of SR.

				I can&#039;t say if it&#039;s the fact that I&#039;m using SR now versus copping on the street before, or the fact that 11 years have gone by, I&#039;m older and wiser, and I have much more responsibility (wife, job, 2 kids). But my usage (so far!) is much better controlled that 11 years ago. 11 years ago I was a straight-up junkie and I did the whole tour of duty - jail, prison, methadone clinics, 6 months inpatient rehab... <br /><br />I cleaned up for 11 years but the last month I&#039;ve been.../enjoying myself/... thanks to SR. I&#039;ve been using heroin, cocaine, dilaudid and Xanax. Not every day - just 3 to 5 days a week. I can sleep at night without dope. My tolerance is low still.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t have the time to cook up and slam 5-10 times a day every day like a used to when I was a kid. And this of course is a very good thing.<br /><br />Here&#039;s to keeping things under control and a merciful God sitting on the throne in heaven (and living in our broken vessels).
