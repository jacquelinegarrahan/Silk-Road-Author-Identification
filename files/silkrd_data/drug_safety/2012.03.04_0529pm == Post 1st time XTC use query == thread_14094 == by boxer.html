				About a month ago, I ordered a sample of two MDMA pills.&nbsp; &nbsp;My wife and I have never tried MDMA before, but have wanted to for quite awhile, hence the order.&nbsp; Some details:&nbsp; &nbsp;I ordered from one of the more popular vendors on SR. The pills were described as 160mg each.&nbsp; Research led me to the first time does of 80 mg.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m 220 lbs. and the Mrs. is @ 100 lbs.&nbsp; (Oh, she just said 104 &quot;I&#039;m getting fat&quot;&nbsp; ::) ) Anyway, the pills come, the lady takes one pill and I rail half of one and take the other half about 30 - 45 minutes later.<br /><br />Then nothing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve racked my brain trying to find some reason why the flat response for both of us.&nbsp; The last drug taken had been some meth, maybe a week earlier, so I don&#039;t think there would be any interference from that.&nbsp; Or at least not enough to completely negate the MDMA. <br /><br />As I said, I ordered from one of the more popular vendors, and I almost posted this in a review thread, but realized that I would only get flamed from die-hard fans.&nbsp; My suspicion is that the pills were bunk, but I&#039;m willing to suspend that for objective discussion.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t complain to the vendor, as the cost was quite low, and didn&#039;t feel like it was worth the bother.<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />My plan is to try some of Tony76&#039;s powder next.

				Are you taking SSRI meds? I went to a club with a friend on Friday and fed her nearly 250mg of pure MDMA over the evening and she barely got off baseline whereas I was gurning my face off on 150mg. It turned out she&#039;s been taking fluoxetine for the past month, as she knows nothing about chemistry or pharmacology she hadn&#039;t thought there would be any interaction between the two...

				Thanks for the speedy reply Wowzers.<br /><br />My wife takes a SARI, specifically Trazodone, which was my first suspect, as it seems to interfere with MDMx but doesn&#039;t block them entirely as a SSRI would.&nbsp; &nbsp;This doesn&#039;t explain my lack of fun.&nbsp; Not to say that there can only be one, and only one reason why the pills didn&#039;t work, I just don&#039;t take anything that would spoil the effects.&nbsp;

				Did you take it on a totally empty stomach?<br /><br />Also, it takes me at least 200mg for the first dose to really start to feel it, some people just need more.&nbsp; 80mg is a good dose to start, but if you didn&#039;t feel anything, I&#039;d say increase it to 150mg or so.<br /><br />I would suggest getting MDMA powder, testing it with reagent, and then capping it yourself to know that you are getting the dose you actually want.
