				I am looking for something that is euphoric, and pain relieving. <br /><br />I have tried oxycodone and marijuana so far. I liked mairjuana a lot better, but also enjoyed the numbing feeling from oxycodone in smaller doses. <br /><br />I find myself bored once again, at one point I was convinced oxycontin was my choice but yesterday&#039;s experience with about 40mg of oxycodone left me nauseated and just feeling sick with no good feelings ever. I miss the euphoric high from sativa strains and the mellowed out feeling from indica strain.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I dislike the psychoactive, out of my mind panicky feelings associated with marijuana.<br /><br />Right now I need something that is euphoric at best and that comes in a pill format. <br /><br />Also it can&#039;t be too expensive like oxycontin...shit is way too costly to support a regular habit.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

Good luck with that mentality. try a weaker opiate like codeine if you have to do one... ye be warned<br />

				Hm, the paranoia goes away for me when I make sure to smoke weed EVERY DAY.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you need to practice harder ;)<br /><br />Seriously tho, don&#039;t go looking for a nice &amp; easy opiate... I would hold tightly onto that memory of nausea and pretend that&#039;s all there is, for the sake of your future.<br /><br />Hm, I do agree with the MDMA suggestion. Give it a shot.

				Yeah, 150mg of nice MDMA, smoke a small cone halfway into your peak and enjoy a nice stoned/MDMA thought process.&nbsp; It&#039;s like trippy happy abstract imaginative images and scenes playing out in your head, as well as everything we all know and love about ecstasy!&nbsp; Then, when your roll is coming down, smoke a little more and it will bring some of the roll back, thus making it an even more gradual/natural return to baseline.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you tried MDMA before?&nbsp; You didn&#039;t say.<br /><br />Perhaps you can go into trying it with the view to get out of it a new appreciation for the weed, as you&#039;ll see the weed through the magical MDMA lense!&nbsp; Perhaps letting you smoke it regularly with less paranoia?!&nbsp; Then roll on MDMA a few times a year from then on!

				I myself am finding this question popping up more frequently these days. I&#039;m personally not really into anything too &quot;hard&quot; per se, but am quite innocent to most drugs out there in the world. No experience with RCs but very interested in a few of them. I&#039;ve always found my highs in the opiate area of things (until health issues changed that to actually needing the medications for pain management, etc) so I myself am looking for something new as well. I have only tried shrooms once before but loved it. I don&#039;t like to go big when I do try or use something so for the most part, I&#039;d like to keep it that way and just find a euphoric high of some sort in general but of course staying on the lower side of things. MG wise...<br /><br />

It feels like a cross between LSD and MDMA. But quite different at the same time. Its euphoric, psychedelic (texture and colour changes with some hallucinations) and very chatty. Its a wonderful substance!

				Why not MXE (Methoxetamine)? Similar to ketamine but lasts longer, and capable of putting you into an amazing M-hole at high doses, or at low doses is sort of stimulating and I find very introspective. Its also a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a NMDA receptor antagonist, and is thought to have some affinity for the mu-opioid receptors.
