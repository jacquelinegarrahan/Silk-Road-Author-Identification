				OH boy, at high doses, just about any benzo will just knock you out.&nbsp; If you&#039;re drinking alcohol on top of that, you will probably aspirate on your own vomit and die like Hendrix.&nbsp; But we don&#039;t need to go that far.... ;)&nbsp; &nbsp; I would avoid high doses of benzos unless you already have a high tolerance.&nbsp; &nbsp;If 1 to 2mg of Xanax does not get you &quot;euphoric&quot; .... I&#039;m not sure what benzo will.&nbsp; &nbsp;That being said, I only have experience with Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Etizolam and Ativan.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hey that reminds me, I&#039;ve been meaning to ask.................<br /><br />Which Benzo has the highest recreational value, -excluding- Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan, and Etizolam ???&nbsp; &nbsp;(Easier to spell brand names rather than generic...sorry lazy)&nbsp; :P<br />And what I mean is, a decent, functioning &#039;euphoria&#039; can result from it and not just a knockout sleep enhancer........thanks !&nbsp;

				Well...........if 10mg of Valium knocked you out.....I would forget about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Xanax is stronger.&nbsp; &nbsp; But if you want to try it, I would start at .5 mg and not go over 1mg until you find your comfort level.&nbsp; &nbsp; But maybe benzos aren&#039;t for you........just my opinion.....good luck!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				Well I definitely like stims too...and I find benzos a very decent way to come down.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you&#039;re on the right track.&nbsp; &nbsp;But perhaps you should try something like Soma (carisoprodol).&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice muscle relaxer with sedative properties that won&#039;t automatically make you hit the pillow.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know a lot people smoke weed to come down, but I can&#039;t stand the stuff, so I stay away.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it does help a lot of people...... :)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah try Soma, or maybe phenobarbital....although I can&#039;t personally vouch for pheno, since I&#039;ve never tried it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to though!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; See ya!&nbsp; &nbsp;

At least not if you are looking for an euphoria remotely comparable to that produced by opiates. <br /><br />The fact that a large dose of benzo&#039;s (possibly combined with alcohol) will &#039;knock you out&#039; does not mean anything euphoric or even pleasurable. Getting hit in the back of the head hard enough with a bottle also knocks you out. <br /><br />That said, benzo&#039;s can certainly give you a pleasant feeling. I would not describe it as euphoria as such, but it can be a sort of calm, warm, fuzzy feeling at times. Which one to use is a difficult question to answer though. Mostly you will want to take them at night and not have much of a lingering effect the morning after, so fast-onset, short-lived benzo&#039;s would probably be preferable. <br /><br />This would remove goold old valium from the list, as it has a ridiciously long half life (incl metabolites) that can be anything from about 2 days to a full week. Xanax would be a prime candidate as it has both reasonably rapid onset of action and rate of elimination. Oxazepam is also a good choice since it breaks down even faster, but is more difficult to obtain. Clonazepam is widely used too, i suppose mainly as it gives you most &#039;bang for the buck&#039; with 2 mg clonazepams selling for the price of 1 mg xanax despite similar potency. The breakdown of clonazepam is not as rapid though, so you may wake up feeling sedated.

				I think it varies dependent on the environment and mood you&#039;re in. I have a Xanax scrip for my social anxiety; it always just made me sleepy albeit calmed me down.<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve been enjoying the hot weather and decided to take 2mg one day out of sheer boredom; the breeze combined with the warm temperature gave me this powerful, electrical feeling of invincibility; it wasn&#039;t as strong a euphoria as, say, MDMA, but it was certainly nice. I did really want somebody to physically hurt me, however... reminded me of Speed ;p

				If you are hyper tense all the time and also suffer from bad anxiety. All of them will create a mild euphoria amplified by the relaxation/muscle relaxing properties. <br /><br />Valium,klonopin, and xanax does it for me.&nbsp; The former two being better in terms of euphoria for me at least.

				Etizolam and Xanax are by far the most popular for those seeking euphoria. I&#039;m pretty sure valium on occasion had a nice euphoria but being addicted to 100mg of valium daily for 3 years has left a bad impression on me. <br /><br />Basically you want the less sedating benzos. Ativan is quite sedating, as is phenazepam (an analogue). An interesting new benzo analog called Pyrazolam is regarded as an anxiolytic ith very little sedation, and there are mixed reviews about it&#039;s euphoric value. It seems to be quite subjective. 1-2mg has had me feeling nice.<br /><br />I have some listings up for etizolam, pyrazolam and phenazepam if you&#039;re interested. I don&#039;t recommend the phenaz for recreation tho; it&#039;s a great cheap analog for taking care of GAD symptoms all day tho.

Valium is still alright but kind of dull, to much abuse destroyed it for me. My tolerance dropped fdown 7months after my addicion to baseline, where I thot 30mg mgth get me nicely buzzed.. it was too much and I was feeling way to dull. Benzo dependency sucks and anyone on a high dose thats causing sdie effects (depresion, rebound anxiety), and I feel scripts for them are too readily handed out. They&#039;re not good substances for regular use.

				My experience with Benzo&#039;s is limited to Xanax, Valium, Serax (forgot the generic name), and Rohypnol (briefly). Firstly, never, NEVER EVER mix with alcohol - the interaction is exponential and potentially fatal - you will almost certainly black out within 20-30 minutes (my experience), and only God knows what you will have done or said during that time (again, my experience). NEVER MIX WITH BOOZE, not even a little.<br /><br />Now, if you have no tolerance built up, 10-30 mg Valium is good, or 0,5 - 1,0 mg Xanax is good, Serax in between (Rohypnol not good, and after about 1,5 - 2 hrs you will have to sleep, you can&#039;t escape that feeling. With a tolerance, I&#039;ve hav as mush as 80 mg Valium and maintained well, but with xanax (and other xanax-head friends of mine concur) 2,5 mg is the max - over that and you have to sleep a couple of hours. <br />They don&#039;t produce the euphoria that an opiate does, but you will find that you are very pleasantly relaxed, more physical than mental with valium, and more mental with serax and xanax, although all do some of both.<br />Please be advised, xanax is easilly addicting, and if you don&#039;t taper down over a week-10 days, siezures will result (again, my personal experience)

At larger doses more dangerous problems like respiratory depression surely come along, but in all honesty, i doubt that would commonly happen for someone taking 10 mg valium with 2 glasses of wine. <br /><br />The concept that taking somehting like 20 mg of valium with a bottle of wine will knock you out cold is simply not true. Perhaps that will happen if you have no tolerance against either substance, but generally it just doesn&#039;t work like that. <br /><br />I&#039;m not overly certain how a mix with cannabis would turn out. From a biochemical standpoint i see little risk, but what it would to you mentally is another matter entirely. <br /><br />

				Don&#039;t kill yourself (I&#039;m talking to you specifically, dumbass reader!) but a small amounts of benzos can really potentiate alcohol. You can get drunk on less drinks (great for bar prices), though do be careful and limit your intake of both the liquor and the benzo. I suggest not carrying all your benzos with you, unless you wish to keep taking more and more whilst forgetting how much you&#039;ve already taken.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The concept that taking somehting like 20 mg of valium with a bottle of wine will knock you out cold is simply not true.

				Xanax probably the most euphoric as far as US Rx&#039;d goes. Thanks to SR I&#039;ve been able to try all the other &quot;-zepams and -zolams&quot;<br /><br />I think the Bromazepam 6mg are very euphoric, with less sedation.<br /><br />The suggestion of 50 mg Valium to someone with no tolerance is&nbsp; an insanely high dosage! The daily maximum allowed Rx for an adult male is 30mg&#039;s, (3 - 10 mg daily or as needed) I&#039;ve been taking them on and off close to 40 years. <br /><br />Oxazepam is nice too, just seemed to knock me out though. Give Bromazepam a shot to try something different to come down from stims. <br /><br />Usually the lower dosage produces euphoria. After that you move away from euphoria and into drowsiness.<br /><br />IMHO - your mileage may vary -&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />PS.

				Most euphoric is and will always be Xanax.<br />My reasoning is the following:<br /><br />It&#039;s the shortest duration strongest per mg anxiolytic benzodiazepine.<br /><br />Mainly people get the &quot;high&quot; or &quot;rush&quot; from the anxiolytic effects not the sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, and amnestic properties which it still has :D<br /><br />The short half life and onset add to the &quot;high&quot; effect.<br />When taken in high dosages with people with a high tolerance to benzos or sedation it will produce the most profound anxiolytic effects, a good ratio of anxiolytic/sedation effects. Which is why I would rather get high of Xanax then Valium for example. The Valium would have me more sedated but not nearly as anxiolytic as Xanax on an equivalent dose. <br /><br />So too sum up I don&#039;t recommended Xanax for anything other then chasing a high, it extremely addictive (more so for people with anxiety) and very habit forming. I had months of horrid withdrawals that cant be touched by opiates or meth alike. <br />I was doing 50mg a day so one would expect such things. <br /><br />Enjoy!&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)

				Halcion is definitely more of a sleeping pill. Also leans more towards the amnesia tendency.&nbsp; I got that Rx&#039;d for about a year. Very fast tolerance build. <br /><br />Etizolam is weird. Very very lite feeling to it. Seems like I couldn&#039;t take too much. (Only had 10 tablets to try out). I was doing a lot of other shit at the time so it&#039;s hard to say. <br /><br />It was those &quot;glory days&quot; of Silk Road that many of us go through. Get your tax return check, and BOOM! It&#039;s like shopping for Christmas with Sears catalogue !<br /><br />Yeah, Xanax still the king as far as any euphoria. Like I already said, the only one close, that I&#039;ve tried is Bromazepam. The &quot;green&quot; Valium.&nbsp; ;)<br />That&#039;s what they looked like anyway. - Natasha has them. She&#039;s always been a trusted Vendor for me.

				Having tried Xanax, Ativan, Halcion, Etizolam, Brotizolam, Restoril, Klonopin, Valium, Versed, ..., and probably a couple others, I&#039;d say Xanax has the most &quot;euphoric&quot; effect, if you want to call it that.

				Nobody believes me, but I was in a euphoric blissed-out nirvana state once on Librium in hospital.&nbsp; I had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face...everything was fantastic.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was totally gooned out.&nbsp; &nbsp;But this was five years ago...and the memory could have been implanted by aliens.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Set and setting may have had something to do with it as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because everybody I&#039;ve talked to about it insists Librium has no euphoric properties or little recreational value.&nbsp; I&#039;m still determined to track some down and find out for sure........ ::)

				I believe you! ;D<br /><br />Librium most definitely can do that. Depending on your own sensitivity. Librium was 1st! Before Valium!<br /><br />I was given that in a detox unit when I was 19, and let me tell you! You looked forward to that little green capsule! :P<br /><br />Some people aren&#039;t as sensitive, so count yourself among the lucky ones like me! - The others need a fucking baseball bat to the head! :o<br /><br />*** DISCLAIMER *** [prior results don&#039;t guarantee a similar outcome]&nbsp; 8)

				Well, if you were fighting alcohol withdrawal i can certainly imagine how a dose of librium or many other benzo&#039;s would actually feel like bliss to you. Not so much because they provide euforia, but more because the relieve the complete misery you are in at that moment. <br /><br />Apart from that, there is nothing special about librium compared to other benzo&#039;s in general. I suppose at that time a similar dose of plain old valium would have been just as good, but now you associate librium with the relief it once provided you. I&#039;m not sure its available anymore though - perhaps you can find some on SR or otherwise, but afaik it is rarely prescribed anymore for any condition.

				So Alone, you have given me some hope after all !!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, Librium is hard to find in the States, but a few online pharmacies from the UK do supply it, so I may have to make the plunge.....if only just to get the obsession out of my head.&nbsp; &nbsp; No, I wasn&#039;t in hospital for alcohol withdrawal, but I did have some anxiety and dysphoria at the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was well versed in the relief that Xanax can bring social anxiety and/or situations that are usually very frustrating to endure (such as waiting two hours in a security line at an airport.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the relief I felt from the Librium at that time was unlike any dose of Xanax.&nbsp; It made me extremely happy, no anxiety, talkative, and fairly clear headed for a benzo..........I need to see if that reaction was just a fluke or what..... ;D

				Why hasn&#039;t anyone mentioned Midazolam? It&#039;s the stuff they give you through an IV when you have dental surgery.<br /><br />Seriously, it&#039;s THE shit, and the most potent benzo out there. Also, it&#039;s water soluble, so the possibilities are endless.

				Nice tip, man...I was wondering about Midazolam....I was kind of thinking it might just make a person pass the fuck out though....<br /><br />I&#039;m also curious about Magadon (nitrazepam)...one vendor here told me it will &quot;get you straight folded.&quot;&nbsp; Which I assume is a good thing.....&nbsp; ;)

				I have been curious about Midazolam for a few years. I actually heard about it on a TV episode of Law &amp; Order - they called it &quot;dazzle&quot;. I have seen it here on SR, but haven&#039;t tried any yet (I still like Xanax a hell of a lot!)

				I Tried Oxazepam yesterday with a 3 month tolerance break from all benzos/drugs.<br />It was just one 30mg<br />I was just chilling with my mate and he chucked it at me and asked if I had tried it, only 1 of 3 benzos that I haven&#039;t tried so far so I had to say yes =)<br />Just to add in I have chronic anxiety and not on any meds.<br />I found the quick onset really good then it proceeded to come up really smooth for the next few hours leaving a quite euphoric glow and lots of chatting, more likely due its random ability to help my anxiety AND the little depression coupled with it. ALSO I was high for the first time in a bit so I wouldn&#039;t trust this report fully. ;D<br />30mg Oxazepam is equivalent to 0.75 Xanax<br />I still vote Xanax the king. But I have yet to try all.&nbsp; &nbsp;:) <br /><br />Midazolam and Bromazepam could sway me.&nbsp; ::)

				Well, oxazepam surely has its qualities. <br /><br />In the netherlands it is quite commonly prescribed, although it is hard to source from anywhere else. <br /><br />I suppose the nice thing about it is that it has a decent time to onset on action and a very short elimination halflife. This makes it a great sedative for things like long flights, where you would want to be knocked out for 6-9 hours but would not want to be still sedated once at your destination.<br /><br />Alprazolam can also be used, but it doesnt have the sedative properties quite like oxazepam does. I think oxazepam is a benzo that gets too little attention compared to its potential uses. As far as i&#039;m concerned it actually is one of the best short-term hypnotic benzo&#039;s available, and if you need just a good nights sleep and nothing else, trumps xanax, klonopin or plain old valium by far due to its much shorter halflife.

				Midazolam is my favorite for combating insomnia. I find Temazepam more &quot;euphoric&quot; than Midazolam, personally.

				Personally i dislike temazepam because it gives me especially bad amnesia compared to other benzo&#039;s. It is a pretty effective hypnotic though, as long as you do not mind wondering how the hell you got to the place you woke up. <br /><br />Midazolam is actually a very good choice if you have problems falling asleep, but its availability is limited. Since its half life is very short, it is a very good substance to fall asleep&nbsp; with, without much of it persisting in your system once you wake up.<br /><br />

				Benzodiazapenes are mostly euphoric to the people with anxiety problems, but some people enjoy the feeling without them. I&#039;d say it&#039;s compared to the feeling you get right after you take a piss after holding it in all day. Just relaxing.

				flunitrazepam is by far the&nbsp; mist euphoric benzo!!! but be careful if you take too much of it you will pass out and/or forget everything that happened when you were on it. After flunitrazepam comes klonopin, xanax, and triazolam.

				Temazepam was somewhat euphoric, and the guy I got it from said it was the most euphoric benzo when he gave me some. It&#039;s the only benzo I&#039;ve yet to try, though, so I can&#039;t say if it was more or less euphoric than x.

				IMO, Benzo&#039;s aren&#039;t &#039;euphoric&#039;... I find that the term euphoria is used to describe different things. For example, my definition of euphoria is the feeling of your chest about to explode with orgasmic pleasure and your mind filled with nothing but joy and excitement. It just makes you want to scream/dance because there&#039;s no other logical action that can possibly make you control such an overwhelming feeling of pleasure. Apparently there&#039;s that have literally jizzed in their pants from IV Methamphetamine (I&#039;m not too sure how much truth there is in that). I think a lot of people&#039;s definition of euphoria is just feeling happy and content.<br /><br />But yeah with the above being my definition of euphoria, I wouldn&#039;t describe Benzos as euphoric... But then again I haven&#039;t tried all of them.

For that classification a substance would have to induce a feeling of euphoria in someone that is perfectly healthy and not suffering from any disease to begin with. <br /><br />Benzodiazepines do not produce such effects in healthy and inexperienced individuals, while opiates usually do. <br /><br />This does not mean that benzo&#039;s cannot be a great relief for some people, but if you were to take a healthy test subject and gave them any benzo in reasonable amounts, they would not experience a sensation of euphoria. In fact, it is more likely that they would be asleep sooner than normal and little else.

				I think &quot;euphoric&quot; is highly subjective and different people can experience that sensation in many ways.&nbsp; I think I have felt &quot;euphoric&quot; without the use of any medications/substances.&nbsp; Furthermore, I think it&#039;s helpful to keep the antonym in mind, which is &quot;dysphoric.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dysphoric is defined as &quot;a state of feeling acutely hopeless, uncomfortable, and unhappy.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;So the opposite of that is &quot;euphoric&quot;...or extremely happy.&nbsp; &nbsp; So that obviously can be highly subjective and not necessarily drug-induced.&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe &quot;euphoria&quot; isn&#039;t a helpful term in this context after all.&nbsp; &nbsp;
