				just looking for any suggestions for when i finally sniff the last of this bag. I noticed a couple of days ago i didn&#039;t have any for about 18 hours and my back got really sore. so its clear to me i already have a physical dependance. Its been one of the best weeks, but its easy to say that while still under the effects :) Wish me luck and peace out!

				Is nucleo still selling? I don&#039;t see any of his listings :( <br /><br />and I don&#039;t think its possible to develop a physical dependance/addiction after 5 days unless you were taking other opiates before that
