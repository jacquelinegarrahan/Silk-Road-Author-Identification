				I&#039;ve thought about this as well...would like to hear real world opinions. I thought about getting glowing contacts but I&#039;d rather not draw attention haha.

				I don&#039;t know about colored contact lenses but I wear prescription lenses and for me at least, they make it pretty much more obvious that I&#039;m high when wearing them. When I&#039;m high my eyes get red when wearing lenses even though without them that doesn&#039;t happen. I never use those eye drops for red eyes either so I don&#039;t know if that would help. As for dilated pupils I wouldn&#039;t worry about them, if your pupils are dilated colored contacts or not I&#039;m guessing it&#039;d be obvious to anyone that&#039;s paying that close of attention to your eyes. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any way to hide that unless you&#039;re in the dark or wearing sunglasses&nbsp; ;D

				Using colored contacts that leave a limited area for the pupil to expand may conceal enlarged pupils at first glance, but they will also inpede your vision, as less light enters your eyes that you require.

				I&#039;ve done it, it works pretty well honestly, unless your pupil gets bigger than the colored part of the contact lenses (which MDMA will usually do) then it&#039;s particularity bizarre and obvious looking.

				Your body language and voice tells a lot to other people i would say. So for pot i don&#039;t see what benefit this would have, maybe the right eye drops could produce a good effect.<br /><br />For MDMA this should be really nice.<br />As long as you don&#039;t loose one of them, you&#039;d look like Manson in his best years. ;D<br /><br />You would need to find exactly matching colors because if someone knows you they&#039;ll very easily notice about the changed eye color if they have some kind of consciousness.<br /><br />My hair even tho&#039; it is very short is always more of a problem when rolling, totally out of control. everyone can see it. sweaty-pushy-train-wreck. haha.

				For weed, eyedrops work 100% of the time. When I was younger I didn&#039;t give a shit and just let it fly, now I hope to not see anyone from the office so I use eye drops. Fortunately, I have allergies in my eyes so it serves 2 purposes.<br /><br />I think the dilated pupils matter less when you&#039;re at an event or even a club. It&#039;s dark in there, everyone elses should be as well. In that environment especially, I don&#039;t think it would matter if you had colored contacts that didn&#039;t match your eyes. Lotta people wear different colored contacts for various reasons, fuck it. Just my .02

				Cannabis causes two visible symptoms that are easily visible in the eye: dilated pupils and reddening of the white part. The latter is very similar to what happens if you suffer from hayfever, and eyedrops designed to counteract it may very well work to mask the red eye situation. <br /><br />Pupil dilation could be masked with color contact lenses to some degree, but those will limit the aperture of your pupils. This may be okay under daylight conditions in a office, but could potentially be quite dangerous if walking or driving in the dusk/dark afterwards. <br /><br />Pupil dilation can be a direct result of a drug resulting in overexposure of your eyes to light, but also be caused by reduced light sensitivity of the retina, in which case you actually need the pupil dilation to gather enough light for proper vision.

If you are trying to cover it up from people that know you well, then you need to start using the contacts in non-required situations. They will get used to it and you won&#039;t have to worry about the paranoia they *might* suspect something. It&#039;s similar to the analogy of building a fence around wild hogs...or around the people of the US ha. <br /><br />Same thing I did in school...show up high the first couple of days/weeks of classes with new teachers and that becomes the baseline because they don&#039;t know any different. Much easier to get away with it later on when you show up baked out of your mind. I guess I&#039;ve never had the pupil problem with weed, just redeyes. I could just be comparing to stimulant use changes though...

				Well, that is also an approach - if you often show up with red eyes, that could be the result of hayfever or some other allergy, and easily be explained away.<br /><br />As for pupil size: paranoia certainly is a factor there. Something like dilated pupils actually do not stand out that much, certainly not when you walk into a room. Perhaps you just came in from outdoors on a bright day, perhaps your pupils are just a bit larger than average. You can worry about that all you like, but the average person will not notice it at all.
