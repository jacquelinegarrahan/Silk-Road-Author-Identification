				I&#039;m sure this question has been asked on this forum a dozen times, but I couldn&#039;t find any threads about it using search.&nbsp; I have been on google for about an hour looking for an answer with no luck.&nbsp; This is more or less the last place I can look.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />My buddy is in drug court, and I would like to find an outlet for him escape for a little while.&nbsp; I am looking for any information regarding drug testing and NBOMe substances.&nbsp; First-hand experience would be best, but at this point anything would be a huge help.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for your time, and have a nice day. :)

				You probably won&#039;t find any solid information on the topic at this point and time.<br /><br />However, the dosage for NBOMEs are extremely low. I&#039;m not a toxicologist, but it seems likely that one of it&#039; s metabolites would be a 2C/phenethylamine compound. Typical 2C doses are at least 10-20x + higher than that of NBOME. For example, 2C-B is usually taken in doses of 15-20 mg, while NBOMEs are typically dosed at 1.0 mg. <br /><br />Given that most common phenethylamines are undetectable after 24 hrs, and at most 1-3 days...I&#039;d imagine that NBOMEs would be undectable by the 24 hr mark (if at all). I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they didn&#039;t even make it past the cutoff concentration.<br /><br />I&#039;m only speculating so don&#039;t hold me to this. And I&#039;m speculating on urine and saliva tests only so don&#039;t bet your freedom on it. <br />The body doesn&#039;t always operate logically so best to err on the side of caution.<br /><br />That said, I was in his shoes and was confident that I&#039;d have 24-48 hrs to clear a piss/swab test, I&#039;d probably feel ok risking a single typical dose of 1.0 mg.<br /><br />But again, take this with a grain of salt. <br />

				The average cheapish drug test, I would assume wouldn&#039;t be able to test for NBOMe.

				While it&#039;s great you&#039;re trying to help a friend out, him taking nbome right now sounds like a bad trip waiting to happen.&nbsp; What a bitch he can&#039;t just have some molly.&nbsp; F**king drug court.

				Most test won&#039;t look for things that make you trip unless asked for which a drug court probably wouldn&#039;t as the test cost more. <br /><br />They usually test for Thc,Meth,Herion,pcp and mdma.&nbsp;
