				Nitrazepam causes significantly stronger sedative effects than Diazepam.<br />Other than that, Nitrazepam should be a more efficient sleeping drug, although Diazepam also has a sedative effect.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br /><br />sdesu

				Nitrazepam (mogadon) is THE benzo that is used for inducing sleep under normal conditions. It was commonly used as a before-bed drug in hospital patients until not that long ago, and is effective as such.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t suggest any type of recreational use - just keep them around for those times you can&#039;t sleep but really want to. Also recommended for intercontinental flights ;) <br />Nowadays oxazepam is more often used for this purpose due to its lower side effects, but nitrazepam is a proven substance with decades of experience by now.

				Thanks for all the replies guys. Yeah, I got a pack of 10, 10mgs for free when I ordered a gram of Mephedrone, I had one after a full day of being on the Mephedrone, put me to sleep. Very very useful.. I&#039;ll be using these to get sleep after a day on Stims.<br /><br />At the moment I have Diazepam (Valium) and I find this one is better for anxiety.<br /><br />Sollem

				Diazepam should be better for anxiety.<br /><br />Nitrazepam is a mostly sedative benzo, and not that good to handle anxiety if you need to be standing up straght whilst doing so. Perhaps you could exchange them with someone more interested in the sedative properties.
