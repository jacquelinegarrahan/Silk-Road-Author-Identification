				I have tried the 2 separately but going to a rave in a few weeks and was thinking of taking 1 600ug hit of 25c and 110mg of mdma. Has anyone else tried this? What dose combo did you use and what order did you dose?

				Never tried, but please report back afterwards.<br /><br />25c + 2C-B, however, is very very nice.

				I would suggest you take one and wait at least an hour before you do the other. Last saturday I took a gary glitter 110 mg x pill and then dropped a 100 ug hit of acid 3 hours later followed by another 100 ug an hour after that. i was up until 6 am the next day. It felt pretty dam good. If I had it to do over I would have taken the acid an hour after the X. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of reviews in tyl3r durdens thread about taking the two together and some say not to take at the same time and if you do the nbome first then the x will greatly intensify your experience depending on how long you wait after taking the nbome. Some were over whelmed and got sick. I guess it depends on how well you know yourself with each drug and if you are mentally prepared for it. <br /><br />Yea I advise you to ask tyl3r durden because I think he could be more informative about it<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve done it. took two 600 Âµg tabs (HH) and 150mg of dutch&#039;s MDMA<br />took the first tab at 10:40 (0:00)<br />2nd tab was placed in at 1:40 (+3:00)<br />MDMA was taken in a cap at 2:10 (+3:30)<br />I was starting my 25c peak around +2 at a party, after which i felt like going all the way. After getting home from the party I put in the 2nd tab and took the mdma.<br />It should be noted I&#039;m around 100kg and ~180cm/5&#039;11<br />My advice would be to take both tabs around 3 hours maybe longer before the mdma, wait till you feel the peak starting, because I ended up finishing the mdma peak at around 5:30-6am (+6:30-+7)<br />but still had solid visuals, OEVs and CEVs till around 9am or (+10)<br />Also I was unable to sleep till 11AM maybe a little later.<br />It was an extremely powerful experience and gave me a really focused head-space where I worked through a lot of emotional stuff that I didn&#039;t even really realize was weighing on me (I kinda did, but not as much as it actually was). I do have to say though, keep yourself away from Facebook/Skype/your phone as it can lead to some overzealous messaging, and if possible do it with someone else so you can share things on it (I was with drunk people so it wasn&#039;t as bad as it would have been with sobers, but I still felt that I was a little over the top for them at times)<br />My CEVs were quite focused, kinda like a mid dose dmt trip- people walking around talking (there was a literal party in my head) there are also flashing lights, color spectrum etc. no real geographical stuff in the CEVs but closer to a very vivid dream-scape. <br />OEVs (in darkness) consisted of tracers, visual noise, and hallucinating cartoon caricature faces - much like old school loony toons. and some fairly light color activity.<br />OEVs (in light) consisted of &quot;3d vision&quot; melting/breathing walls, swirling vision, geometric patterns, and enhanced colors.<br />Honestly I don&#039;t think I would have enjoyed it that much at a rave, I was very &quot;clean oriented&quot; sweaty people grossed me out a lot, heat was a disphoriant (that said I dislike heat to begin with)<br />And at one point I found myself washing my hands for about 10 minutes (just on 25c btw) because I didn&#039;t like how they felt, they felt a little sticky (maybe from beer)<br /><br />Its an amazing trip and I&#039;ll be repeating it again, although I think I&#039;ll dose both tabs at the same time and tone back the mdma a little (135-140 probs, maybe mix with mda? 70/50)<br />That said I&#039;ve had friends go to raves on both 25c and mdma independently and they enjoyed both, so the discomforts I listed might just be specific to me.

				Thanks for the responses I will check out Tylers thread and see what others say. I&#039;ve never had stomach issues on either drug on their own so i think as long as I&#039;m responsible I should be okay.<br /><br />Ensine: My usual mdma dose is 130-140 so I&#039;ll probably just do one 600ug tab wait an hour and drop a 120 mg cap of mdma. So I&#039;m not completely whacked out of my mind. <br />

				Has anyone tried 25i and mdma combination? I am contemplating on trying it after I experiment with my 25i dosing.
