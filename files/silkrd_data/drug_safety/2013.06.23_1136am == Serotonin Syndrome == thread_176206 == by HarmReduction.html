				Title: <strong>Serotonin Syndrome</strong><br />

				Over the past few months&nbsp; there have been a number of posts about mixing SSRI&#039;s with MDMA or other substances.&nbsp; 2 males died last yr at a concert in Dublin with all the clinical signs of Seretonin Syndrome&nbsp; So I thought I&nbsp; would&nbsp; start off a thread on this <br /><br />Serotonin syndrome most often occurs when two drugs that affect the body&#039;s level of serotonin are taken together at the same time. The drugs cause too much serotonin to be released or to remain in the brain area.<br /><br /><br />Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur when you first start or increase the medicine. It can occur as a consequence of normal therapeutic drug use, self-poisoning or drug interactions.<br /><br />&nbsp;The syndrome is the consequence of excessive stimulation of the central nervous system and peripheral serotonin receptors. There is a wide spectrum of illness ranging from barely noticeable minor symptoms such as tremor, through to life-threatening acute illness.<br /><br />The syndrome is not widely recognised amongst clinicians and drug workers and one survey found that 85% of UK general practitioners were unaware of the diagnosis. A failure to appreciate the syndrome means that mild cases may be overlooked; continuing or increasing the offending drug can cause progression to severe illness <br /><br />Symptom onset is usually rapid, often occurring within minutes. Serotonin syndrome encompasses a wide range of clinical findings. Mild symptoms may only consist of increased heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated pupils, myoclonus (intermittent tremor or twitching), as well as over responsive reflexes.<br /><br />&nbsp;Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds, high blood pressure and hyperthermia; a temperature as high as 40 째C (104 째F) is common in moderate intoxication. The overactive reflexes and clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hypervigilance and agitation.&nbsp; Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 째C (106.0 째F) in life-threatening cases.<br /><br />Stay safe and if your going to use try and use with friends who know the info

				Good info relating to SS. I have recently tried some mephadrone whilst still on SSRI&#039;s, felt fine but not sure of the purity of the drug i had- it wasn&#039;t from the road.<br /><br />Still it is a stupid idea to take any stimulants really whilst on SSRI&#039;s, i will wait till i&#039;m off them now.<br /><br />Do you know if it is safe to take ketamine or LSD whilst of these anti-depressants
