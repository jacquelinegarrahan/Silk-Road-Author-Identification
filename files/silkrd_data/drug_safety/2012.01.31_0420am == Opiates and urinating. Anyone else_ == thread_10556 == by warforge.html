				Yes, it is an unfortunate side effect of opiate use.&nbsp; It took me years to figure it out.&nbsp; I finally realized I only had trouble taking a piss when my tolerance was up.<br /><br />That and constipation.&nbsp; I make it a point to take a few senna tablets every now and then to help with constipation, but I haven&#039;t found anything that helps with urination other than to drink lots of water.&nbsp; It is easier to go when your bladder is full.&nbsp; When it is only partially full, you feel the need to go but have trouble doing so.&nbsp; There is more pressure when it is full so it is easier to go.<br /><br />There is probably a pill to help, but I haven&#039;t bothered looking it up.&nbsp; It&#039;s better to bring your tolerance down every now and then, basically take a drug holiday if you can.&nbsp; Healthier for you.

				I&#039;ve also had this problem during my entire opiate career. Unfortunately it&#039;s not one of the side effects that goes away as you build up tolerance. It&#039;s caused by spasms in the bladder IIRC.<br /><br />The only thing that might help is a diuretic (aka &#039;water pills&#039;) . There&#039;s a couple over the counter options, just ask at a pharmacy or GNC type store. I&#039;m not entirely sure if it would work or make things worse. In either case it would speed up the whole process.

				It is actually a symptom of the opiates relaxing the muscles required to evacuate your bladder and bowels.&nbsp; The more opiates in your system the harder it becomes to &quot;push&quot; with those muscles.&nbsp; As you taper off, the effects become less, and the muscles return to normal.<br /><br />Water pills can help.&nbsp; If you are going to use them, be careful.&nbsp; They can increase the amount of potassium your body excretes, which can be dangerous if they get too low.&nbsp; Taking a supplement is advised if you are going to start taking water pills (diuretics).&nbsp;

				I can usually get it going by alternating trying to go standing up, then sitting down. Then stand up, then sit down. Eventually it comes out. Seems to work when just standing there nonstop.

				I&#039;m not sure if it goes away, or if you just get better at controlling it.&nbsp; When I first started it would take so long to piss that I&#039;d sit down to pee, and often the nod would get the better of me.&nbsp; Nodding off on the toilet is a waste of a good buzz let me tell you.<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of the sex god aspect of this though.&nbsp; Having sex for hours on opiates is just too much fun. Try to make sure she isn&#039;t high too though or you&#039;ll get the same problem for her ... not as much fun!

				i like the itch too kinda, but if it bothers you, first-gen anti-histamines (diphenhydramine, promethazine) will stop the itch and potentiate the opiates, so you use less of your stash. with the right potentiators you can get high off immodium!<br /><br />Generally it just takes a lot longer to pee and requires some focus and patience, not really extra effort or force though. leaning forward or sitting might help if youre really high. kinda like it is doped out too, just barely creeping along the tubes at its own nodding out lazy pace :P Basically the best advice has been said, and that is to just wait until you really have to go cause it will just be so much easier, so stay hydrated <br /><br />the only real remedy is to do less or build a tolerance. sucks.<br />stay safe! love you all<br />- miR

				try leaning forward and putting one hand on the wall to hold yourself up, spread legs out stiff like a tripod, and the other hand supports your junk.&nbsp; it helps.

				i always take a nice long piss before my first shot of the day because if not i know i won&#039;t be pissing for a few hours. I found sometimes deep breathing helps if I have to go really bad but it just won&#039;t come out. But this is totally normal with any opiate but most apparent IMHO with heroin.
