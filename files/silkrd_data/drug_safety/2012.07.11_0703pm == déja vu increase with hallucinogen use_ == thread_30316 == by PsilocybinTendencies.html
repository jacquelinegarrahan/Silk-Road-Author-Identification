				Recently I&#039;ve feel like I&#039;ve been déja vu&#039;ing everything. Normally this happens only rarely to me.<br /><br />Since discovering silkroad there has been a significant increase in my use of hallucinogens. Could that have anything to do with it?

				for sure... hallucinogens can definitely make you more aware of what you normally wouldn&#039;t notice. that&#039;s kinda what happens when you open the doors of perception.

				Déja vu is fucking weird.<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember foreseeing the memories in question until it happened, then I look at the scene like &quot;wtf? I&#039;ve been here before.&quot;<br /><br />Because I can&#039;t remember it til it happens I think its a trick of some kind and I&#039;m not really seeing anything happen before it happens.<br /><br />But if there&#039;s any validity to this phenomenon that kind of implies that we have fate instead of free will (if not some kind of compatibilism), and I think that, even though religions say we have free will, déja vu and the idea of fate is the best argument in favor of the existence of a diety.

				from wiki:<br /><br />Déjà vu has been firmly associated with temporal-lobe epilepsy. Reportedly, déjà vu can occur just prior to a temporal-lobe seizure. People suffering a seizure of this kind can experience déjà vu during the actual seizure activity or in the moments between convulsions. Since déjà vu occurs in individuals with and without a medical condition, there is much speculation as to how and why this phenomenon happens. Several psychoanalysts attribute déjà vu to simple fantasy or wish fulfillment, while some psychiatrists ascribe it to a mismatching in the brain that causes the brain to mistake the present for the past. Many parapsychologists believe it is related to a past-life experience. Obviously, there is more investigation to be done.

				I&#039;d agree that hallucinogenics increase deja vu, I notice it a but myself these days. I was once told it&#039;s the brain processing something twice at once, (i.e. it &#039;misfires&#039; and tries to correct it straight away) which makes it seem like it&#039;s happened before but really hasn&#039;t. I don&#039;t think this has been confirmed by actual science though.

				I have had deja vu alot or what I felt like was deja vu.&nbsp; I attribute this to humans being very tied to routine.&nbsp; So if it feels like you have experienced something before, you probably have.&nbsp; <br />what do you guys think?

				This is very interesting,&nbsp; from what I remember, there is evidence that eating mushrooms or doing certain kinds of snuff (DMT I think) actually increases IQ and activates certain parts of the brain. I don&#039;t remember the specifics buts there is a guy who wrote a book about this and his quest for the perfect snuff.<br /><br />Ever since I was 14 years old, the first time I stumbled upon what they call &quot;Lucid dreaming&quot; by accident, I have learned much more about how my mind works. Most people do not discover lucid dreaming by accident, I did not know what it was but googled &quot;able to control dreams, awake in dream&quot; and found out about it after I had my first. Anyways, getting back to deja vu, for me I realized that ,at least in a few specific cases I can remember, the second after I realized I was having deja vu I realized that I had done that exact same thing in a dream before, or at least seen myself do it in the dream. So my theory in your case would be that perhaps these hallucinogens are stimulating parts of your brain that are helping you to remember past events in a dream, etc. Basically, increasing your mental awareness, which, if done moderately and correctly, can work wonders on your ability to delve into the astral world. I would think the native Americans would be a good example, I wonder what they have to say about Deja vu.

				I&#039;ve never done hallucinogens, but I&#039;ve already noticed that I have much more &quot;déjà-vu&quot; the times when I smoke a lot of weed.&nbsp; If I smoke one joint a day, it&#039;ll be enough for me to have much more of these &quot;déjà-vu&quot;.&nbsp; It eventually decreases after a few weeks without smoking weed.

				I did find I had Déja vu more frequently when I took a lot of acid, left me soon as I stopped tho. To slide off the subject a bit; the first time I took LSD I noticed everything in my vision seemed to be made of macroscopic red and greed dots, my last big dose was about 13 years ago and Ive never stopped seeing those dots, they do not bother me (I enjoy them sometimes) but still very strange.<br /><br />
