				I&#039;ve tried lots of stuff while on LSD, from mushrooms, MDMA, and even Nitrous.&nbsp; Best being Nitrous to this day, but I&#039;ve never tried DMT while on LSD.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve just ingested around 400-450mics and I&#039;ve got some very pure white DMT.&nbsp; &nbsp;Has anyone tried this combonation before and what&#039;s to expect?&nbsp; I ingested my L around 15 minutes ago.&nbsp; Just trying to prepare myself for what&#039;s to come.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m in my house alone, as I don&#039;t wanna freak anyone out if something weird happens (lol) .&nbsp; I&#039;ll be listening to some very beautiful Emancipator and Grateful Dead for the rest of the night.&nbsp;

				I almost did this. Packed a bowl of weed and DMT, actually started to take a hit, had the dmt taste in my mouth and everything, then suddenly I was washed over with this feeling that I shouldn&#039;t continue, so I put the bowl down and let someone who wasn&#039;t tripping smoke it out.<br /><br />My set and setting were not ideal, which is why I think I had this sense that it was not the time and place. So, don&#039;t take my experience as a reason not to embark. If you are in a peaceful place I think it could be a really fantastic experience. It would also be good to have a friend with you though, to trip sit if possible, usually a good idea.<br /><br />You should youtube &quot;Terrance Mckenna dmt during lsd&quot; or something along those lines. Terrence talks about his experience and from my memory it was wild for him.

				I gave it a try to get the feel for the initial effects.&nbsp; Its very euphoric and calming.&nbsp; Eased my mind , lol, but Im going to give the full journey a shot in about an hour or so still feeling my L is at its peak.

				I&#039;ve done this with quite a few different substances at the peak of my LSD trip.&nbsp; Salvia, nitrous, and high potency weed to name the top 3.<br />That was actually one of my strongest psychedelic experiences of all time.&nbsp; The Salvia extract while peaking.<br />My body couldn&#039;t handle it and I pissed, shit, and cummed myself at the same time.<br />A very strange feeling.<br />Like the trip couldn&#039;t possibly go any deeper.<br />Anyway, I&#039;m a super experienced pyschonaut.&nbsp; So my recommendation is be careful.<br />When you&#039;re peaking it only takes a very small amount of something to drastically change your trip experience.<br />I&#039;d say you would be fine smoking the DMT though.<br />Just make sure you are somewhere comfortable, preferably laying down.<br /><br />Happy Tripping<br />Vanquish

				Yea, calming, lol.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have the anxiety I normally would have just doing DMT alone.&nbsp; The fractals and machine type environment was what I visioned with eyes opened.&nbsp; Was definitely a different type of DMT trip.&nbsp; Felt as if it lasted WAY longer too.

				Love Lucy. Love DMT. What a combo, lucky bugger. Wish I had a whole day free where me and a few close friends could do a bit of that...sigh. Can&#039;t snatch any more than half a day&#039;s checking out these days.
