				I&#039;ve read several reports of this synthetic now and it seems that it has a risk of inducing anxiety for some people. Most of these reports were of people who overdosed, but a few of them were within the 1-5mg range (lower tolerance i guess). <br /><br />Is this more or less likely to occur depending on administration? I was thinking of just sprinkling 2-3mg of it over some tobacco and rolling it into a joint. Should I smoke the entire thing, or just until I start to feel effects? (or does it take a while). <br /><br />Has anyone noticed any downsides of long-term use? Anxiety? Mood? Appetite?

				Trust me, you want to be EXTREMELY careful with JWH-018, because you REALLY don&#039;t want to overdose. I think 1mg steps should be safe. I smoked it through the bong without any herb. Eyeballing this stuff is a bad idea. When it hits it hits almost instantly. Be careful with re-dosing.

				I see you shortened your post, sad because it was nice to read such a detailed report!<br /><br />Anyway, I think we read the same reports, asdfern :) I&#039;v had my share of experience with my best friend (as explained in some topic here that I can&#039;t find anymore), and we figured out the whole mg scale was overated. The very first time we &quot;divided&quot; into same-sized parts the 0.120mg from hashUK, before going &quot;what the hell&quot; and just sprinkling &quot;a tiny bit&quot; over our joints. The &quot;high&quot; comes up, very, very fast, as said by Bob. I assume if you &quot;chase the dragon&quot;, it would hit you even faster and &quot;all in one go&quot;, which could make some people freak out. <br />Especially taking into account the induced tachycardia.<br />I&#039;m sure it is better to start &quot;very low&quot; and work it from there. What we used to put in our joint in the beggining, we would never have thought it would have any effects - but it did! Remember you can get &quot;higher&quot;, but not less :)<br />However I must say we have gone pretty *medieval* in a few occasions, and the worse we&#039;v both got was... falling asleep! Which was pretty hilarious when we woke up ;)<br /><br />As for &quot;long term&quot;, I&#039;v only used it on &amp; off for a little while. It as addictive as cannabis, so careful! Mood, I can&#039;t say, and as for appetite I think it depends. I&#039;d rather smoke more than eat, wheras my friend kept having the famous &quot;munchies&quot;...<br /><br />Strange stuff, but fun stuff... have fun!<br /><br />I&#039;m still waiting for my new order which is getting a bit late.. Hope it comes before deployement :/

				OK, bad trip report re-post. I feel a bit lousy because everyone on SR forums will now know that I eyeballed RC&#039;s.. But then again, maybe someone will have fun reading my report, and more importantly, maybe someone will be more careful with JWH:)<br /><br />---<br /><br />T0:00 - put some JWH018 in bong (no herb). Amount was about the size of grain or two of salt. Burned it. Some chemical taste, but exhaled no smoke. Licked the pocket knife I used to get the chemical out of baggy, it tastes like drugs, not too bad. Watch an ep of Big Bang Theory. Nothing is happening.<br /><br />T00:20 - some more chemical, half grain of rice size. This time burned it a bit longer. Sit back and start watching another ep of BBT. Start feeling really high. Like salvia high, but feeling really unnatural. Start thinking about all the bad trip reports I read on the net.<br /><br />T00:?? - I’m in a really weird place. I feel I have to make effort to breathe, because I feel I’m not breathing unless I try hard to. I feel my heart stopped beating. Think about how this sucks, and that I’m gonna die. Some part of brain starts rationalizing - ‘I have overdosed. No one died from this shit, many felt they would. I just need to give this some time and try to be calm.’<br /><br />T00:?? - feel like hours have passed. BBT is still on, I still hear it, but it doesn’t make any sense. I think I had my eyes closed for the most time. I try to look around to get the sense of reality. Everything is pulsating. I’m having tunnel vision. Decide it’s a good idea to go and wash my face in a sink. I think I’m stumbling around. Everything feels unreal. I do my best to get a grip of reality. Wash my face for a long time (or it felt long). The face in the mirror looks like a stranger. Go back on my bed.<br /><br />T00:?? - freaking out. think about how I’ll never do this shit if i pull though this time. Try and watch Big Bang Theory. Think about how only few minutes must have passed, since the episode is only 20 mins long. I remember reading the trip takes a few hours. Feel really bummed out that the time goes so slowly. I feel that I have already seen this episode, because I know exactly what will happen next. Maybe the player is set on repeat? Not that I can make any sense of what I’m seeing.<br /><br />T00:?? - keep trying to get a grasp of reality. Decide to go and clean my teeth (?).&nbsp; Watch the flowing water and decide to throw up. At this point I feel like really really drunk. ‘I have poisoned myself’ - I tell in my mind. I stand in a bathroom with toothbrush in my hand and think about throwing up for quite some time. … Well, I guess I won’t throw up after all. Go back to my room and lie down. Don’t really remember walking part, I just find myself in one place, and then another.<br /><br />T00:?? - I feel that I need help, because I can’t get a grip of reality anymore. I think of calling some friend, but I am in no condition to open eyes, yet alone to use a phone. I think I hear my flatmate. I think that maybe I left water running, and she will come into my room to see what’s up. I decide that if she comes in I’ll tell her I’m high out of my mind, and I need her to tell me what’s real. No such luck.<br /><br />T00:?? - BBT is still on. WTF. I feel horrible. I can barely see monitor and feel really bad about this. ‘Am I blind?’ I think. I keep pondering about how bad it is to have bad vision. I remember I wear glasses, and decide that i probably don’t have them on, and that’s why everything is blurry. I’m don’t know who I am. I have a feeling that I’m insane, and my ‘real’ life is just hallucination. I try to think about who is real me. I think how I will go to work tomorrow. I find the idea absurd. Is this really my life? How did I get here? My life is really bad. It wasn’t supposed to be this way…<br /><br />T??:?? - I think I’m hallucinating voices. My thoughts keep wondering around the subject of ‘me’, and get really personal. I think of all my ex-girlfriends, about their bodies and souls. I think that sex is the most beautiful and intimate thing in the world. I think about how I’m truly in love with this girl, and how she wouldn’t reject me if only she knew how I feel about her. I pledge to have a talk with her if I don’t die tonight, and if that life I’m thinking about is real. Left side of the chest feels achingly empty.<br /><br />I open my eyes and think ‘I’m back, bitches’. I must have passed out/fell asleep. Look at the clock, it’s T06:00. Feel a bit tired, hungry and empty-minded. Make some food, watch same episode again (it doesn’t look familiar). An hour later I go to sleep.<br /><br />This morning I feel slightly hung-over. In a good mood overall. Everything feels a bit ‘off’. I find myself grinning at people. The whole experience I had yesterday seems like a bad dream. I feel that I learned something about myself. If I didn’t trust vendor completely I would say the chemical is some kind of dissociative, because the trip felt completely different from any high I had on weed, shrooms or salvia. <br /><br />Will I do it again? Hell yes. I feel I had the most horrible experience in my life and lived to tell the tale. On to the next adventure! Except this time I’ll be much more careful, because sure as hell I don’t want to visit the same place again.

				If you want to get high please dont do it with RC&#039;s when you can get the same effect of MJ. To quote the famous Sasha Shulgin: &quot;Anyone using JWH* is an idiot&quot;. Okay maybe its not a direct quote but he did say smth like that ;) Please be carefull around RC&#039;s!<br /><br />Warm greetings,<br /><br />Mitanox

				Indeed asd! I can&#039;t smoke weed because it can be detected for way too long... Coke for special ocasions is very fine, but even a single joint is dancing with the devil...

				JWH-018 is completely worthless, IMO.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried JWH-018, 073, 200 and 250.&nbsp; JWH-018 was, by far, the hardest to dose, the worst high and the worst side effects.&nbsp; The first couple times I tried it, it was quite enjoyable.&nbsp; Those two times, I sprinkled the tiniest amount I could see (smaller than a grain of sand) onto the tip of a cigarette and lit up.&nbsp; After this, I purchased a gram of it (when it was still legal), and had a series of horrible experiences with it.&nbsp; Some of these experiences were with this same miniscule amount, many a mg or so.&nbsp; If you take a tiny bit more than you should, you vomit for hours, feel like you can&#039;t breathe and have major heart issues.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other JWH&#039;s I described weren&#039;t as bad, but definitely aren&#039;t as good as even shitty schwag.&nbsp; JWH-073 was quite enjoyable and much easier to dose than 018, but builds up a tolerance very very easily.&nbsp; 200 was similar to 073, and 250 was either fake to too weak to be worthwhile.&nbsp; If I couldn&#039;t get actual weed, I would rather go without getting high then waste my time with any synthetic cannabinoids.&nbsp; I threw away what I had left of what I bought after my last experience with 018.<br /><br />tl;dr, you&#039;re on silk road.&nbsp; buy some pot.

				after first horrible, but at the same time interesting experience I vaped JWH018 couple more times last week. I never get this high from the weed, probably because I don&#039;t have access to really good weed (yeah, I could buy some from sr, but 20$/g is a bit steep for me). So yeah, this chemical has its benefits. :)
