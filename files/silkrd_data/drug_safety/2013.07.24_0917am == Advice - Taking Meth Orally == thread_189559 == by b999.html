				I like a moderate amount of meth, say 20 - 40mgs a day but I really don&#039;t want to start vaping / smoking / snorting if I can help it because that sounds kinda addictive / dangerous and ageing to me.<br /><br />So... what&#039;s the best ways to take meth orally?&nbsp; I tried mixing in water, or with baking soda as I heard it&#039;s alkaline so stomach acids destroy it... any ideas?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard of &#039;parachuting&#039; with paper but that sounds a bit weird and I didn&#039;t understand why, or emptying out some pills or getting empty pill containers or something?<br /><br />Also, any ideas on measuring dose?&nbsp; I found that more than say 20 - 40mgs just gave me insomnia without any real extra kick, which kinda sucked.&nbsp; So I&#039;m thinking 20 - 40mgs is the most I should do in a day, for a mature heavy man.<br /><br />Thanks...

				some method is less dangerous/addictive than others, but don&#039;t think it is totally safe to take meth orally.<br />I don&#039;t know about it, i like to smoke it. wait for someone more informed.

				of course it&#039;s not &#039;totally&#039; safe just like drinking alcohol can be damn dangerous, but sniffing alcohol fumes would be more fun, but also more dangerous again.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming taking meth orally is less dangerous and less addictive than smoking / vaping even if you get &#039;less&#039; out of it.

				glass pipe is the best way, and more effective one.<br /><br />find your dose, try with your usual, don&#039;t redose after a while, smoke at least for me is nice and I had bad time doing too much...<br /><br />smoking is probably more addictive, second only to iv.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not an expert, I talk by what I learned and experienced.

				You don&#039;t want to snort it or smoke it.&nbsp; It will feel different and not last as long.&nbsp; The bioavailability is nothing but how much of the compound gets into your blood stream.&nbsp; Only IV has 100% bioavailability.&nbsp; 60% means that 60% of what you ingest orally ends up in your blood.<br /><br />The only reason to worry about this *at all* is if you can&#039;t afford your oral dose and you want to get that much in your blood more cheaply.&nbsp; Other than that, just ignore it.&nbsp; Oral is the least hazardous in many ways.

				Sure it&#039;s expensive but so is dementia and parkinsons disease etc.&nbsp; Bypassing the liver by direct ingestion may increase effect by 40% or so but hardly seems worth the risk if you aren&#039;t after a massive &#039;rush&#039; which I&#039;m not.&nbsp; I&#039;m quite happy to just have an amazing day.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do the all night dancing thing, this is mostly for just private use like private recreation or exercise / weight training.<br /><br />Can MDMA help with that?<br /><br />What about the research that comes out every now and then about MDMA &#039;blowing holes&#039; in brains?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to actually meet some 60yo+ MDMA users to see for myself if this is true or not.<br /><br />The key thing for me is to avoid this neuro-receptor depletion thing because even if you don&#039;t do &#039;damage&#039; it sounds like it can take yeras to grow back, if ever.&nbsp; So it may be fun to get a massive &#039;kick&#039; but if it takes years for the neuro-receptors to grow back it sounds like a big cost.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some meth ready to go, looks good.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s 125mgs so I&#039;ll divide it in to six lots and put one in water and drink that around mid-day after a big protein heavy breakfast and see how I go.<br /><br />First few times I tried meth / dex I never got insomnia, maybe that&#039;s because the dosage was around 20mgs dex compared to 40mgs meth that I was recently playing with.&nbsp; I actually slept incredibly well.&nbsp; Maybe because it got the &#039;dopamine&#039; out of my system for the day so I could sleep better, ironically.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just a matter of &#039;balance&#039; - just like coffee.&nbsp; If I have too much coffee in the day I won&#039;t sleep either, same thing.&nbsp; If anything caffeine feels worse than meth.&nbsp; Meth just feels &#039;cleaner&#039; than caffeine, even if I&#039;m stuck awake.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken a week off too so I hope that&#039;s allowed some recovery time for the dopamine levels to recover.<br /><br />So just 1/6th point in straight water on an empty stomach a few hours after a solid breakfast you think? Say around mid-day?&nbsp; 20mgs (1/6th of this 1 1/4 point) should be good, and I&#039;ll leave it at that, not re-dose until the next day.&nbsp; See how I go.

				do not take with baking soda. take the baking soda at least an hr later. . Using straight water to flush it down is best, but if u cant take the taste pepsi covers it nicely. U can wrap it in a smalll amount of tissue paper, in a small amount of beeswax, or in a gelcap also.<br />If you snort it, i recommend just very small lines no latrger than .05 gram and not for extended period of time- 2 days max.<br />Leave smoking for the advanced long time users.Smoking is best suited for the social use situations anyhow.<br /><br />the psychosis that occurs can be almost entirely avoided if you sleep regularly- never stay up over 1 night ) Eat a bit each day ,and avoid IV use. Dont let your usage turn habitual, which is easier said than done. <br /><br />And as for those brain holes from MDMA - those are incorrect myths&nbsp; that originated from a study that the researcher was caught falsifying the test in order to recieve federal research money for Anti-drug propoganda.

				why baking soda an hour later? Stomach acids are not an issue?<br /><br />What about alkalising techniques like salads and spirulina? Vitamin B day before and after too?<br /><br />Sounds like oral use is a LOT safer then. I have no desire to become that &quot;experienced&quot;, this is risky enough as it is and I already get a lot out of it. I&#039;m happy with that.<br /><br />So I think I will divide the point in to six, have a rock solid protein heavy breakfast, let it go down for a few hours while alkalising with salads, spirulina and lemon juice water, mix the sixth with plain filtered water around mid day and work out like a mfer for about four hours and hopefully wind down to a blissful slumber that night after an amazing day.<br /><br />Maybe take vitamin b around 6pm and sleep supplements and calcium magnesium before bed, and maybe calcium magnesium pill during the day.<br /><br />While amped I will take fish oil and some fruit for fast release carbs. Maybe avocado too. And drink lots of water and keep alkalising with salads and spirulina but no protein until night. Make that my days second big meal, skipping lunch.<br /><br />For vaso dilation beetroot juice seems to work too.

				I&#039;m no expert on meth, but it seems that when taken orally, it&#039;s not really any more dangerous than other strong stimulants. I agree about caffeine too. I&#039;ve had pure caffeine before, and it has loads of unpleasant side-effects, without the euphoria that makes other stims worthwhile.

I have tried to support my body as much as I can and know how.&nbsp; I generally lead a very healthy and active lifestyle anyway so oral meth doesn&#039;t &#039;make&#039; my life, but it definitely enhances it.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t want to go from &#039;enhance&#039; to &#039;need&#039;, even if it&#039;s no more &#039;serious&#039; than &#039;needing&#039; a cup of coffee.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather not be addicted to anything at all, however mild.<br /><br />So while I&#039;ve been keeping doses around 40mgs most in a day, generally less (say 20mgs), I&#039;d appreciate any advice on signs of addiction or health problems in long term use (say six months to a year).<br /><br />The other good sign I guess is that my dose doesn&#039;t really seem to increase, it&#039;s been fairly consistent for the last few months.&nbsp; Either that&#039;s just discipline or what I don&#039;t know, but I don&#039;t feel remotely tempted to down a whole point in one go - I just look at that amount and think &#039;yuck - that&#039;s major insomnia and fun destroying tolerance right there&#039;.<br /><br />I gotta say though, using it like this has been wonderful for me.&nbsp; I feel social, just enjoy my day, don&#039;t get a &#039;crash&#039; or &#039;come down&#039; that I really notice (unless I take too much and have trouble getting to sleep that night), get more things done, improve my exercise and training.<br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s the &#039;benefits&#039; I&#039;m &#039;addicted&#039; to as much as the chemical itself then too, but that can still be an (indirect) issue too.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read though I&#039;m an extremely mild case.&nbsp; On some forums there are people saying you need &quot;minimum&quot; 90mgs and stuff like that which is just something I can&#039;t even imagine doing, unless the quality we get on SR is much higher than the stuff these guys are talking about but I&#039;m not inclined to think so.<br /><br />I&#039;m certainly happy to forego this magical &#039;rush&#039; they keep talking about and insisting is required for everyone because the benefits I get at these &#039;lower&#039; oral doses are good enough for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m very happy with it. Bit like being happy with a glass or two of wine every day as opposed to feeling a need to get rolling drunk at every opportunity.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even drink that much any more either, if I do, there again, one or two drinks is fine for me otherwise it mucks up my sleep etc.<br /><br />Same with this stuff.

				I certainly admire your attempts to keep your mind and body healthy while using meth. Don&#039;t overdo the exercise while you&#039;re on it though. Doing strenuous exercise/sport on any strong stim could increase chances of heart failure, so keep safe. It sounds like you&#039;ve got things pretty much under control, but try cutting it down to once or twice a week, just to stave off addiction and so you don&#039;t have to take it to feel normal. You should enjoy it more, the less you do it.

				I find the way people have such a difficult time understanding addiction to be -- well, difficult to understand, frankly.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=189559.msg1396805#msg1396805">Quote from: b999 on July 31, 2013, 11:20 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Either that&#039;s just discipline or what I don&#039;t know, but I don&#039;t feel remotely tempted to down a whole point in one go - I just look at that amount and think &#039;yuck - that&#039;s major insomnia and fun destroying tolerance right there&#039;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This.&nbsp; This is what will prevent you from becoming addicted.&nbsp; Not all the effort you&#039;re putting in to avoiding addiction -- frankly, I&#039;m inclined to think that your preoccupation with the substance is counterproductive in that manner, but that&#039;s not something anybody but you can really know -- but in that sentence right there is what will prevent you from *ever* becoming addicted to... well, to anything, frankly.<br /><br />I suppose I didn&#039;t understand what addiction really is before I became an addict and was able to study myself as one.&nbsp; I say I&#039;m an addict, but I have never and will never betray someone close to me just for a drug.&nbsp; I say that, but it occurs to me, I have dosed and then lied about taking the drug -- but I consider that a harmless lie, and I don&#039;t like doing it, but I have done it.&nbsp; As harmless a betrayal as &quot;no, you don&#039;t look fat in that,&quot; if you ask me.<br /><br />Maybe that means I&#039;m not an addict by most definitions, I dunno.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to sacrifice people in my life who choose not to associate with me and various other things just to keep taking my drug.&nbsp; Frankly I think loyalty and my integrity are just a lot more important to me than they are to most people, otherwise I&#039;d probably sacrifice those too :P<br /><br />But it isn&#039;t out of need.&nbsp; That&#039;s not what addiction is.&nbsp; It&#039;s out of want.&nbsp; I want my drug so much that I pay a terrible price for it and choose to keep paying it, and that&#039;s all addiction really is: it&#039;s all psychological in the end.&nbsp; Physical dependence is trivial, unless you&#039;ve been on a drug for so long your body will fail if you get cut off abruptly... but even then, wean off and you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; It&#039;s the psychological desire that&#039;s the problem, and that&#039;s *all* in the way you think.&nbsp; All the bullshit about &quot;this drug is addictive&quot; and &quot;this drug isn&#039;t addictive&quot; or &quot;this one&#039;s more addictive than that,&quot; is such complete and utter bullshit.&nbsp; You can&#039;t define addiction in terms of anything other than individuals, and for an individual their experience of a substance is wildly varied.<br /><br />It almost doesn&#039;t matter how dependent on a substance your body gets.&nbsp; Sure, it&#039;ll make you crave it even more -- I smoked for many years, I know all about that -- but that goes away in a few days basically.&nbsp; The thoughts you have about the drug, the things you feel associated with the drug, the psychological desire you have for it... that&#039;s what addiction is.&nbsp; In the end that&#039;s why some people get addicted and others don&#039;t.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t you ever had sex when you really didn&#039;t have time and should have done something else, and kinda sorta regretted it after ward (you know, when you didn&#039;t even want to fuck anymore)...?&nbsp; Well there you go, that&#039;s exactly why addicts keep taking their drugs.<br /><br />The way we think about experiences and the memories we have of them shape our expectation of the same experiences in the future.&nbsp; Our expectations and desires for certain outcomes shape our intentions.&nbsp; Our intentions shape our actions.&nbsp; So ultimately our actions are based almost entirely on our desires and our internal perspective (even though ultimately all psychology is almost certainly nothing more than biology, you get my meaning).<br /><br />If the way you think about it never changes, you will never be an addict.&nbsp; Nor will anyone else who sees taking more of it as unpleasant, or who doesn&#039;t want it enough to trade other things in their life for it.&nbsp; Why do you think I keep taking it?&nbsp; It&#039;s because it enhances my life.&nbsp; Usually.&nbsp; It&#039;s because even having to pay the price that I pay, I still would rather live the life I have with it than live the life I could have without it.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same reason as you, just on a different scale.&nbsp; The price I pay is much higher.&nbsp; I like it a lot more and am willing to pay a much higher price (financially, biologically -- I mean everything I suffer because of my drug use by &quot;price&quot; BTW).&nbsp; The only thing that scares me is that you can never be sure just how high the price you have to pay is... I estimate it isn&#039;t higher than is worthwhile in my eyes.&nbsp; I may be wrong though.&nbsp; Who knows, my liver could fail next month.&nbsp; I&#039;m also counting on never getting caught with a (what is to a normal person) huge fucking bag of crystal methamphetamine and ending up sentenced for it.<br /><br />Pardon me if you consider this insulting, but in the end, that&#039;s about the only difference between us: I want it a lot more than you do.&nbsp; The risk I take because of my amounts is higher, but you&#039;re at the same risk.&nbsp; They don&#039;t look kindly on meth, certainly not in America.&nbsp; Different values for each of us, but it&#039;s the same equation, which is basically:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">worth_taking = { no: pleasure_using &lt; pleasure_not_using<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yes: pleasure_using &gt; pleasure_not_using }<br /><br />pleasure_using = pleasure - price<br /><br />pleasure = enjoyment_for_person_A<br />price = price_for_person_A<br /><br />price_for_person_A = {only A knows}<br />enjoyment_for_person_A = {only A knows}<br /></code><br />People tend to see addiction as drug use even when &quot;worth_taking&quot; should be no.&nbsp; But they&#039;re basing that on themselves and their own expectations.&nbsp; They&#039;re wrong.&nbsp; The only reason addiction is hard to understand is that it&#039;s difficult for people to imagine wanting a drug enough to sacrifice other things for it, but you do that already: you sacrificed the money you paid for it.&nbsp; You sacrificed the 30 minutes of sleep you lost the other night because of it.&nbsp; You sacrificed the time you&#039;ve spent investigating it.&nbsp; So on and so on.&nbsp; A drug addict does the same thing, just on a much more costly scale.<br /><br />Maybe that helps you understand addiction, I dunno.&nbsp; It kind of turned into a fucking essay or something, which I didn&#039;t intend... and I&#039;m not saying people shouldn&#039;t be held accountable.&nbsp; Obviously they should.&nbsp; It&#039;s simply their reason for their actions that I&#039;m commenting on.&nbsp; Regardless, apparently I needed a little more symbolic manipulation in my day :P

				In my personal experience of chronic use for the past 7 months, I&#039;ve found intranasal to be preferable. Higher bioavability so you need less, and oral lasts too damn long. If I insufflate in the morning, I can get to sleep by 10:00, wheras it&#039;s going to take me at least four more hours if I took it in a capsule <br /><br />As far as not getting addicted goes, take 1000mg of Magnesium Citrate before you dose, and while it sounds conservative, limiting yourself to sub-30mgs every other day will basically ensure that you won&#039;t get addicted. The addiction starts when you start breaking your own rules.

				Extremely informative posts, thank you both.. Karma points to you!<br /><br />Very well written and very informative.&nbsp; At the moment going by SR history (another good thing about SR, I can&#039;t deceive myself when I look at it) I think I&#039;m averaging over three months about 100 - 125mgs / week with occasional breaks of a few days or up to a week, but it&#039;s been fairly consistent to be honest.&nbsp; Some days like today could be as high as 50mgs, which today, as naughty as it is and as much as I swore off it, I&#039;ve taken it intra-nasally for the same reason the poster above did - to try and get it out faster and not have it &#039;hanging around&#039; all night being a pain in the ass.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard America, the land of the &#039;free&#039; probably completely destroys people&#039;s lives for even a small amount of meth - I&#039;m not sure - but they seem pretty crazy over there.&nbsp; I think here in Australia, under a few grams is &#039;personal&#039; use and not nearly as bad as trafficking or carrying a &#039;trafficable&#039; amount.&nbsp; The police seem to go crazy over trafficking or potential to traffic more than anything else, and importing again.&nbsp; So if you import a trafficable amount as opposed to domestically procuring a small personal amount I&#039;m hoping the risk profile is much smaller.<br /><br />The intra-nasal thing is nice, and I&#039;m trying to keep a close eye on my dose.&nbsp; Yeah I&#039;m paranoid but with this stuff?&nbsp; I am not embarassed about being paranoid around it.&nbsp; Frankly, I think we can all understand why.&nbsp; It can be a fine line between enhancement and destruction with this stuff if you don&#039;t keep a real close eye on it.<br /><br />So what I might do if people here don&#039;t mind this thread continuing I will try to honestly report my usage and patterns. If anything to ensure I remain honest with myself but also to be &#039;accountable&#039; here in case I do start deluding myself.&nbsp; Even if I branch some more in to &#039;intra-nasal&#039; use when I need a quick come down say after a weekend evening pick up for dancing around to great music before hitting the bed at a normal sort of hour.<br /><br />Anyone know anything about toxic chemicals like lead etc used in manufacture and if that can be an issue?&nbsp; I am trying to stick to what seem to be the best or most honest seeming vendors but at least here in Australia they mostly seem to be pretty honest and pretty good.&nbsp; Lead especially I&#039;m concerned about as I heard some cheap cooks use it as a reducing agent?&nbsp; I hope it&#039;s microscopic but that shit has a nasty habit of building up in the body I think, like mercury (even though mercury occurs naturally in some fish).&nbsp; So I&#039;m hoping that the healthy life may protect to some degree from any of that but ideally... I wouldn&#039;t be putting any toxic by-product in at all.&nbsp; Is this just a risk we all have to accept and take?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard some trace minerals like selenium may help to detoxify mercury at least, and you get good selenium from simple stuff like garlic and onions I heard, as well as supplements.<br /><br />For now I seem to be ok although tracking over a point a week is something I will try to wind back from to as you say above to only occasionally on weekends or when I have some free time and space to just enjoy some &#039;me time&#039; and dance around or something.<br /><br />As for health and exercise, I never ever exercise with &#039;attitude&#039; - i.e. I listen closely to my body and try not to push it and wear a heart monitor too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t seem to track any higher than I would without it, I just have more motivation to go higher for longer but I still try to work within my limits, and not overheat etc (dry weather winter and dry weather night running is great for this).<br /><br />I actually had some blood tests and a doc check up - and they all came out as close to perfect as you can get.&nbsp; The doc said my blood pressure was exactly where it should be, even said I looked amazing compared to when the doc saw me last (a year or so).&nbsp; So either the meth has REALLY helped or I have at least managed to reduce the visible and detectable signs of any &#039;deterioration&#039;, but I&#039;m more inclined to think I&#039;m just really f...ing healthy right now.&nbsp; I rarely even drink any more... It&#039;s really strange to say, but crystal meth is about my only &#039;vice&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;d happily give up everything else just to keep some of this in my life if I could remain healthy and firmly in CONTROL of it.<br /><br />I think the bit about psychological addiction is worth considering - there could be something in that for me to watch out for.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s all I&#039;m getting is more pyschological than physical addiction, because I REALLY do enjoy the effects - I just love music and just having my own party.&nbsp; It really adds some enjoyment to the day.<br /><br />So why magnesium citrate so much?&nbsp; What about other minerals like potassium etc?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard calcium and magnesium mentioned a lot, something to with helping the muscles?&nbsp; Or may help alkalise the body a bit?<br /><br />Speaking of alkalising - has anyone experimented with Spirulina?&nbsp; Pretty powerful stuff it seems, just one teaspoon turns a glass of water in to dark green nutritious yummy sludge.&nbsp; Seems to work well, and you can get it reasonably cheaply if you buy bulk.&nbsp; Any other tips for alkalising the body and liver?<br /><br />And again, yes I AM paranoid about this stuff and I&#039;m totally fine with that. If I&#039;m going to get &#039;paranoia&#039; about anything, it may as well be about the drug itself.&nbsp; Can&#039;t be a bad thing.<br /><br />SS&#039;s comment about &#039;intent&#039; is so right.&nbsp; I think it is about &#039;intent&#039; - if our &#039;intent&#039; is purely hedonistic then yeah... I guess you will implode fairly quickly.&nbsp; On the other hand I try to approach life in general and meth especially with respect and gratitude.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; I sometimes have to remind myself to get back on that path, sometimes very sternly, but a respectful and grateful intent seems to work for me.<br /><br />I almost feel I should have some sort of rite with this stuff like get down on my knees and give thanks and extend respect to it before I indulge or something.&nbsp; I&#039;m serious.&nbsp; A constant, trained reminder to maintain good intent - being respect and gratitude.<br /><br />And always being honest with how much I&#039;m using etc, but the respect and gratitude thing seems to make that pretty easy.<br /><br />You really made some excellent points SS, I&#039;m glad to have you on the thread.&nbsp; Your point about intent is so true, you really got me thinking there.&nbsp; Thank you.<br /><br />And Bynter - how do you take it nasally?&nbsp; How many mg&#039;s in a &#039;shot&#039;, how frequent, how much over a day or week etc?&nbsp; What else do you do to support that?<br /><br />I hate to say it but the nasal thing does work well because as you say it leaves faster and is less likely to just &#039;hang around&#039; being annoying when you&#039;re done with it and want to not be on it any more for sleep or whatever.<br /><br />I&#039;ll go take some calcium magnesium pills now :-)&nbsp; 1 gram you say?&nbsp; Fair enough...<br /><br />
