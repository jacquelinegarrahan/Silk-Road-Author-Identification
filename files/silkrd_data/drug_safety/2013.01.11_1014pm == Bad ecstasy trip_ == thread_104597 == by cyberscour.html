				I took the same exact pill I took the first time, around 20 days ago, and this trip wasn&#039;t as fun as the last one. Everything was fine for a while, then I accidentally broke my lamp that I got a few years ago, this stopped the joy and, well, ecstasy. I felt so horrible, my god-like optimism I get on ecstasy turned in to pessimism... Does ecstasy cause bad trips ever?...

				maybe your serotonin levels were still a bit depleted.<br />its well worth getting some l-tryptophan and some B6 to restore, along with magnesium and zinc and plenty of vitC, but the others are more important, esp the first 2.<br /><br />maybe you broke the lamp just as you were comming down? <br />certain stressful events will cause you to release less serotonin, this combined with the depletion near the end of the experience could of been what you felt.<br /><br />don&#039;t take those first two supplements together, tryptophan in morning, B6 at bedtime. starting with B6

				Bad ecstasy trips are very similar to bad orgasms... haven&#039;t had one yet but I guess it&#039;s possible.<br /><br />It&#039;s important to understand that MDMA is more often than not wildly euphoric but it&#039;s still your brain so you do get to steer the trip a bit. I used to take MDMA with a girlfriend and we would love it up and talk about how great everything was. Eventually though towards the end of our relationship she would steer the conversations towards what was wrong with us and that just sucked the joy right out of everything. I think getting to a negative place while being on MDMA just requires a bit more effort than a lot of other drugs out there. <br /><br />If you haven&#039;t done a lot of mood altering substances in the past one of the golden rules is that the difference between a bad time and a good time is the conviction of thought that declares &quot;I am going to enjoy this thing that is happening to me right now&quot;. As long as you beleive it it&#039;s going to be true.

				The first time I dropped, nothing really happened. I&#039;d had a few drinks and spent the whole time depressed, sitting in the stairwell of a club recalling bad memories.<br />I think it was only the 3rd time I actually felt any proper effects

Then it can go bad. Can be fixed with benzos or speed.
