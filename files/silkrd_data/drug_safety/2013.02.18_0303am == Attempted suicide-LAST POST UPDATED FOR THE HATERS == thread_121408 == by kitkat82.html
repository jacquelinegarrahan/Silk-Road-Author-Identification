				and you aren&#039;t crazy -- you&#039;re depressed.&nbsp; there is a difference.&nbsp; it&#039;s horrible to think that you&#039;re killing yourself when all you need is to find a doctor who can help you find the right combo of meds to make things feel easier to deal with.&nbsp; your situation needs to change, but that doesn&#039;t mean suicide is a solution.&nbsp; <br /><br />kitkat ... you were depressed about your friend who committed suicide ... so you know how your friends and family - and child - will feel if you do.&nbsp; <br /><br />your son will never forget you -- but he will suffer from your absence.&nbsp; there&#039;s nothing permanent about the situation you&#039;re in - it just needs to change!&nbsp; suicide, on the other hand, is permanent.

				Who is looking after you child?<br /><br />Go see them and talk to them about it. <br /><br />Most countries in the world have suicide hotlines. <br /><br />Think about your child. No&nbsp; matter how loved he is, he always deserve to have his mother. <br /><br />No matter what situation you are in, it can always be improved.<br /><br />Self medicating will&nbsp; only make things worse, you really should speak to a doctor.<br /><br />There is nothign in your life that cant be fixed

				kitkat82, I&#039;m happy your alive, your a mum, your child needs you, stay strong for your child he/she deserves a mum, every child does. You don&#039;t need to go to the mental hospital, however by the sounds of your situation you need a little empathy and a listening ear. You have a lot of emotional baggage depressing your emotions and you need to let go. If your family think you&#039;re a burden to them, forget about them, sometimes your friends can be closer than your family. Get to the hospital quickly, I&#039;m not an expert in this but you may need your stomach pumped, kidney failure is very painful, you don&#039;t want that, drink a lot of water, you need to keep yourself hydrated. If you need a little emotional support tonight, a voice on the phone beyond the forums (however much some of us would love to give you that we can&#039;t), you can call the sameritans, it&#039;s confidential, they&#039;ll listen to you, and will try to help you see a little light in your life, they&#039;re good people. Always remember no matter what and how tough it gets there&#039;s someone always worse off than you, life sends us challenges, and if we manage to overcome them we become better people from our experience. If you ever need someone to listen to you feel free to pm me anytime, my door is open to you, my sincerest well wishes go out to you kitkat82, please come back and let us know your okay.

				I agree with PrincessHIGH ... to prevent painful unpleasant future issues, you may need some medical intervention just to help your kidneys.&nbsp; Plus, with MDMA, it&#039;s easy to drink too much water, and with possible kidney failure on top of everything, it&#039;s something you don&#039;t want to mess with.<br /><br />Is there anyone who can help you get to a hospital?&nbsp; Tell the doctors everything you took - they&#039;ll be able to help give you whatever is necessary to prevent more problems.<br /><br />Keep hanging in there.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry that none of us can be there with you - I&#039;d definitely hang out with you and take you to the doctor, and then home for some light &amp; humorous tv shows.&nbsp; And food!&nbsp; And we could talk as long as you needed.<br /><br />There is an outpouring of support, empathy, and care here ... all of which are possible IRL as well.&nbsp; Hold onto that knowledge!

				Kitkat,<br /><br />Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Don&#039;t worry, ALL SHALL PASS!<br /><br />Get some medical help, don&#039;t tell them you were trying to committ suicide as they will put you in the mental hospital. <br />Just tell them it was an accidental overdose. Make sure you hide or destroy any drugs at home to avoid possible drug charges.

				... I&#039;m sorry, but I find some of the things people are saying here disgusting.<br /><br />1) she already said she has no real friends.&nbsp; Why on Earth would you tell her friends are sometimes closer than family?<br />2) I think you guys are wrong.&nbsp; If they decide she&#039;s unstable and needs to be held for observation, it becomes their responsibility to find out where the child is.&nbsp; They have to, they can&#039;t just leave a kid who may or may not have someone looking after them alone for up to 72 hours.&nbsp; But whatever, I really hope you&#039;re right.<br />3) It would be wonderful if there was always some help.&nbsp; But they have no magic pill.&nbsp; It&#039;s been my experience that their &quot;help&quot; does more harm than good.&nbsp; You&#039;re assuming these people can make her problems go away.&nbsp; Some people seem to appreciate the attention and all, but there&#039;s often no actual help there.<br />4) With overdoses that happened hours prior, they often can&#039;t do anything except treat symptoms as they arise and hope the patient lives long enough for their kidneys and liver to remove the toxins from the blood.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t a magic antidote for every substance.&nbsp; She may end up sitting there hooked up to an IV, forced to stay for 72 hours, with her child taken away when she gets out, and no real help at all.<br /><br />... I&#039;m sure you can figure out how I know this if you want to.

				Just a quick update.<br /><br />I heard from Kitkat.&nbsp; She made it to the ER, and checked out physically okay.&nbsp; No clear word yet on whether she&#039;s coming home tonight.&nbsp; I know she appreciates the warm thoughts and well wishes.<br /><br />Cheers.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: SelfSovereignty</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think you guys are wrong.&nbsp; If they decide she&#039;s unstable and needs to be held for observation, it becomes their responsibility to find out where the child is.&nbsp; They have to, they can&#039;t just leave a kid who may or may not have someone looking after them alone for up to 72 hours.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yep. It doesn&#039;t necessarily mean removal or other Big Hairy Deal (maybe Kitkat is in some magical state with unicorns and readily available foster care,&nbsp; generally kids aren&#039;t &#039;removed&#039; without much more serious threat in my underfunded system), but they do have to check on the kiddo&#039;s safety.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been the kid, I support this idea.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It would be wonderful if there was always some help.&nbsp; But they have no magic pill.&nbsp; It&#039;s been my experience that their &quot;help&quot; does more harm than good.&nbsp; You&#039;re assuming these people can make her problems go away.&nbsp; Some people seem to appreciate the attention and all, but there&#039;s often no actual help there.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Also correct, although &#039;actual help&#039; might be defined differently. Sometimes just being removed from the environment is enough of a reset.&nbsp; People who do this kind of thing a lot look at static and modifiable risk factors and see what they can do to modify the modifiable ones. That&#039;s part of the 72h - people get sober, they get some sleep, their anxiety gets mitigated, etc.&nbsp; Being in a safe place or in contact with someone long enough to stay safe when really impulsive can be enough to keep someone from acting in the service of overwhelming feelings.<br />No one&#039;s going to make the problems go away, I agree, or reduce their severity or imminence.&nbsp; If there&#039;s someone good involved, s/he may may be able to help with the options narrowing and the distorted thinking and help Kitkat with the feeling of disconnection, and s/he won&#039;t trivialize whatever Kitkat has going on.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With overdoses that happened hours prior, they often can&#039;t do anything except treat symptoms as they arise and hope the patient lives long enough for their kidneys and liver to remove the toxins from the blood.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t a magic antidote for every substance.&nbsp; She may end up sitting there hooked up to an IV, forced to stay for 72 hours, with her child taken away when she gets out, and no real help at all.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Again correct. There are frustratingly few antidotes, although they are kind of freaking awesome when they get used. Hell, even with poisonings that happened very shortly prior, symptom management is usually the rule. Activated charcoal and lavage aren&#039;t all that and a bag of chips.&nbsp; <br />Could be forced to stay more than 72 hours but it would depend on a lot of things, and someone can of course sign herself in on a voluntary stay if they petition for an involuntary. Having had another recent poisoning in the past several months would make that longer stay more likely. <br />I would like to think that *sometimes* there is some help but obviously that&#039;s not something I can make happen.<br /><br /><br />Kitkat, I&#039;m not much for talking people down - long story, but it&#039;s just not where I can put my energy. I&#039;m better at the resuscitation / reconstruction end of things though. PM me if you&#039;d like. I&#039;m around every day or two.<br />I&#039;m worried, because when you clear/come back, there&#039;s a core question I&#039;d ask, and it&#039;s the core question someone should ask anyone before releasing them (or trusting them to be in risky situations - I&#039;m gonna get kicked for that, but I have a lot of suicidal people in my immediate life) after an attempt: so what&#039;s changed? what&#039;s different now than when you decided to take this mix to poison yourself?<br />Because from here, you have all the same risks/stressors as when you poisoned yourself... but now you have the added stress of this attempt. Plus the post MDMA slump (maybe you took enough everything else that you didn&#039;t totally crash and burn, that would be a pleasant irony, and it is one that I wish you.) <br />Excuse my rudeness in asking, because you don&#039;t know me from Eve, I just lurk around here mostly and then post walls of text.<br />Still, I want you to do well and, uh, not die. And stuff. Like that. [scuffs toe, looks down]

It&#039;s sort of liberating for me. Life without all the social consequences that people deal with in day to day reality which were in fact the very things that made me want to off myself most the time. Hard to keep it together as a functional anarchist but it&#039;s possible.When you get to a better place I&#039;d suggest picking something impossible to do and simply conquer it. For me, suicidal thoughts come from being trapped in a system from which I feel there is no hope and no escape but there is always a plan B, C and D out there if you look for it. Fuck, move to India for a year and become a Buddhist. Learn how to fly a plane. Run for freaking Mayor of your Town. Whatever it takes, liberate yourself from complacency and life becomes infinitely more tolerable. <br /><br />Glad you&#039;re okay! We only get one shot at this as far as we know so might as well ride it out and see where it goes.

The good news is hypothyroidism isn&#039;t the end of the world, you can keep it under control, it could well be the cause of some of the symptoms you&#039;ve been experiencing.&nbsp; More than likely you&#039;ll be prescribed a low dose of of levothyroxine, which your doctor may increase depending on how your body responds, you may experience some temporary symptoms while your body adjusts to the levothyroxine (your doctor will tell you about these), but once you&#039;re adjusted these symptoms will go away. You&#039;ll be monitored through regular blood testes to ensure the balance of levothyroxine in your system is right. If you need any diet advice send me a pm I&#039;d be more than happy to help. I&#039;m sending you my well wishes and a big hug, all the best kitkat, please keep us updated on how your getting on :)

				i feel bad that you are this way... but you shouldn&#039;t forget that you aren&#039;t really alone in the way you feel. there are plenty of people who attempt suicide, and they most likely feel just the way you do. i often tell myself &quot;i don&#039;t want to live anymore,&quot; but killing myself isn&#039;t really an option worth considering. just because up to this point in your life you feel like a failture; and that you want to run to somewhere safe, but the more and more you look, there doesn&#039;t seem to exist a place... it doesn&#039;t mean that you&#039;ll never get to that point. don&#039;t let go of that last ounce of hope, because it&#039;s always there.<br /><br />okay, enough with the platitudes, but i really do feel this way.

The tunnel can seem so dark and deep but there is light on the other side.&nbsp; (insert hokey cliche)&nbsp; I think there are some genuinely good people in this community so always reach out for help when you need it.

				heard from her - she&#039;s doing fine other than being sick from all the pills and vodka.&nbsp; trying to encourage her to seek help from someone who is qualified in her area.&nbsp; sometimes just having someone in person to talk to can help - especially when they help people deal with these issues every day.

				“Pain is not the same as suffering. Left to itself, the body discharges pain spontaneously, letting go of it the moment that the underlying cause is healed. Suffering is pain that we hold on to. It comes from the mind’s mysterious instinct to believe that pain is good, or that it cannot be escaped, or that the person deserves it.”

				I sincerely hope your okay and you realize this is just one of many ruts that you may have to dig yourself out of... emotionally and sometimes financially and other times physically.&nbsp; I just lost my dad this month and I can tell you that that pain will never go away, pain you think you cause others while living is so temporary to permanent loss of you yourself.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never met you but the simple fact that you get so much attention from an anonymous board gives me much hope for the world.&nbsp; Peace and love to you.

				I&#039;m sorry that you are in a rut, but this is no way to go about taking care of your problems. I&#039;m glad you are getting help, kitkat but please just go ahead and take your issues and keep them off the road from now on. Not to sound unsympathetic, but when someone publically announces suicide to anonomous people its just a cry for attention(like when females have to tell everyone on the net they are female). I kept my mouth shut for a good amount of time while I watched kitkat play the &quot;I&#039;m a female please pay attention to me internet&quot; card like a thousand times, but this is just taking it too far. Honestly I know people with organ failure so if you want to take your life I completely understand. Just please don&#039;t involve this entire community into your drama. Again I am not unsympathetic to people with problems both mental and physical but this type of behavior is the same kind when you see a person put shallow cuts into themselves saying they want to kill themselves. I honestly think you need to put down all substances and seek a good mental health professional before you take this stunt too far to turn back. I know things look bad in the world and your health maybe in the crossfire right now, but its never worth taking your own life.

I didn&#039;t respond to this thread for reasons that don&#039;t concern most here. Don&#039;t know why I&#039;m breaking my never seen never heard policy, felt I had to. Anyway, I&#039;m taking a break for a few days and I can say what I like before I piece out. <br /><br />Obviously when someone says they are going to kill th............................ wait, I have a better idea.<br /><br />As there are a lot of lazy people on this forum I will simply do this:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110701.msg841880#msg841880 <br /><br />........................... as I have already covered it and it is now redundant. If you scroll up you will find kitkat made a post on Flush&#039;s thread that prefaced this &quot;stunt&quot;. Not sure where you have been on forums earlier today but kitkat has already left a few hours ago now. I never talked to her b/c she never talked to me, it&#039;s really that simple, though I do remember having a couple of one-way conversations with her and soon gave up. So this is me making a first direct comment on kitkat, as well as you.<br /><br />If you spend any time here you&#039;ll know a well quoted line acted out. It is.......&quot;Those that know don&#039;t talk, and those that don&#039;t know, do.&quot; I know kitkat is genuine b/c of the info I&#039;ve had on this since this thread was made. And I STILL didn&#039;t post.<br /><br />But I will post now, b/c you seem to genuinely believe this is not actually genuine. I&#039;m also being polite. Beyond what&#039;s necessary for a post like yours. If you yourself were serious about suicide -- not a stunt -- and you reached out on SR forums all hazy and phucked up over the keyboard, would you like a post like that on your thread? You been here since last year, you know by now people here don&#039;t talk about anything over Main. Just bits and pieces. But no, this was definitely not a stunt. Figured it was wrong to just not say anything when I saw your post.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

That was the subtle point I was getting at too. What decent female needs to find solace in a drug forum for the kind of attention that has been spewed on these forums? I post here to drum up business and enjoy a good laugh with the other vendors from time to time on the ridiculousness of this place sometimes. Between the tinfoil and the drama lama&#039;s I don&#039;t know who to verbally slap first.<br /><br />And to the other person complaining about the use of the word stunt. Sorry but that is what it is. If you talk about it and claim you did it, then your having a change of heart. I can&#039;t take someone like that seriously at all with there own emotions if they can flip flop between wanting to live and die. I&#039;ve also seen some fucked up things in my time and my body isn&#039;t what I would like it to be either but I&#039;m not about to bring my personal drama on here(on another account mind you), and boo hoo to the site that I&#039;m killing myself. Again this is the same behavior when I see girls, and I do mean GIRLS put shallow cuts on their arms and claim they were trying to kill themselves its a cry for help and I really don&#039;t take them seriously other than to tell them to go talk to a mental health professional if you need real help. But I will not pander to this behavior and act like it&#039;s to be taken seriously over the internet of all places silk road........<br /><br /><br />tldr: Kill yourself or shut up. (seriously though never kill yourself, it&#039;s not worth it)

				Ok, I logged on to read the last few messages I have and delete my account...but I can&#039;t pretend not to be upset and hurt by a lot of the negative comments saying I am making shit up or attention seeking.&nbsp; So to the people who seem to be total assholes about this....Why don&#039;t you listen up to what the deal is.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I have a personality disorder, been confirmed and reconfirmed for 11 years by many psychologists and psychiatrists called Borderline Personality Disorder....it makes it near impossible when I am untreated for me to control my impulses, and I do 100% mean what I say when I say it, but don&#039;t realize that it is attention seeking or that I am trying to push people away or whatever.&nbsp; So when I say I took an overdose, then I actually did.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really have a whole lot of control when I get in that frantic state of mind, and I do make posts or phone calls to people that are attention seeking, but not intentionally, if that makes sense?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an active control or awareness of these behaviors. It&#039;s not like &quot;Oh I am lonely, let me act like a whiny bitch&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br /><br /><br />If I have a friend who says they are going to call me at 8 or if my sister says she is going to meet me for lunch and cancels, I get deeply hurt, I have an inability to see a grey area, and I internalize and make everything personal.&nbsp; So whatever....you may call it attention seeking and sneer at me....but it is pretty much my illness...and it&#039;s actually called para suicidal behavior, which often ends in many cases with completed suicide.&nbsp; So fuck off if you can&#039;t be a little kind to someone who has never felt a moment of personal peace in 30 years.<br /><br />http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION=symptoms<br /><br />Impulsive and risky behavior, such as risky driving, unsafe sex, gambling sprees or illegal drug use<br />Awareness of destructive behavior, including self-injury, but sometimes feeling unable to change it<br />Wide mood swings<br />Short but intense episodes of anxiety or depression<br />Inappropriate anger and antagonistic behavior, sometimes escalating into physical fights<br />Difficulty controlling emotions or impulses<br />Suicidal behavior<br />Feeling misunderstood, neglected, alone, empty or hopeless<br />Fear of being alone<br />Feelings of self-hate and self-loathing<br />When you have borderline personality disorder, you often have an insecure sense of who you are. Your self-image, self-identity or sense of self often rapidly changes. You may view yourself as evil or bad, and sometimes you may feel as if you don&#039;t exist at all. An unstable self-image often leads to frequent changes in jobs, friendships, goals and values.<br /><br />Your relationships are usually in turmoil. You may idealize someone one moment and then abruptly and dramatically shift to fury and hate over perceived slights or even minor misunderstandings. This is because people with borderline personality disorder often have difficulty accepting gray areas — things seem to be either black or white.
