				Just received my ten strip in the mail. They&#039;re Albert Hoffman blotter with a koi fish on the reverse side. I was happy until twenty mins ago when I put one in my mouth and tasted the bitter. It&#039;s not tongue numbing bitter like an rc I got before but definitely bitter.<br /><br />Effects should come on in 30-45 if its real LSD correct? 2 hours if its an rc?<br /><br />What is one supposed to do in this situation?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t finalized yet...

				Real lsd in the dosages on blotter do not cause any taste unless during the process it is put in some sort of alcohol i believe. <br />Is does not sound like LSD. If there is residual bitter taste in your mouth it almost definately is not lsd, howver if it is just a few seconsd it may be.

				This is the second time Ive been ripped with an rc. The first time I did some research and I concluded it was dox due to the tongue numbing bitterness and the two hour onset.<br /><br />after that I decided to hop on sr and get some legit LSD. I went with a veteran one year member with good feedback (though mostly on his cannabis concentrates). I got it from Jamesbrown. I haven&#039;t messaged him yet. The taste is definitely residual chewing on the blotter brings out more bitterness. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t finalized yet.&nbsp; Will the escrow system be of any use for this situation or is that only for non received packages?

				You could always pick up an Ehrlich&#039;s reagent test to test for LSD, but it might be more work than you need to do.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since you&#039;ve already ate a tab, I would just keep a notebook near you and do a documented trip report or something.&nbsp; The bitterness could very well have just been from the print on the blotter, but it&#039;s impossible to say just from reading it.&nbsp; <br /><br />How big were the tabs?&nbsp; From what I understand, DOx and NBOMEs need a larger blotter size to fit an entire dose.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I guess, since you&#039;ve already ate one, come back in 15 hours and tell us if you&#039;re still tripping :P

				No effects as of now. It was taken around 5 so about an hour and 40 mins ago.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken both LSD and an rc that Im pretty sure was dox. Dox was nowhere near as colorful and visuals felt different than LSD.&nbsp; Also the onset of the dox was around two hours versus the 45 minutes of lsd. Thank you all for the rc information. <br /><br />Nobody has answered about the escrow system. Rcs are worth a lot less than LSD. Will the escrow system help me out on this one? I haven&#039;t finalized yet and have 13 days left. <br /><br />Edit: tabs were the standard Albert Hoffman bicycle ride size. I&#039;m sure mr Hoffman is turning over in his grave about rcs being passed off as his problem child.

				Its been two hours and a half give or take a few minutes. No effects at all.<br /><br />This is starting to worry me. What the hell could have been the bitter taste if it wasn&#039;t an rc?<br /><br />I just finished messaging the vendor.

				I just recently received some of these blotters from mitanox and they have the same taste you describe but felt like LSD to me, although a little less potent than I would have preferred. For some reason all the mass produced blotters out of Europe seem to have this same taste but they have all felt the same as GDF blotter I have gotten within the US. If the blotters were an RC then you would feel something from them as they usually last a very long time and if they were bunk there wouldn&#039;t be a taste at all, they are probably just weaker than you expected. Next time I would try taking more than 1 hit and see what happens.

				Vendor wants me to redose but not for a week &quot;for tolerance reasons&quot;. He also want me to finalize so he won&#039;t lose money on bitcoin price changes. He assures me these are real and bought on the road from mitanox. Also mentioned the possibility of heat destruction in transit.&nbsp; He said we could work something out if I don&#039;t feel anything after redosing after a week. <br /><br />What should I do? What would good guy Greg do in this situation? I&#039;m thinking I should bang three or four after work tomorrow and see how long the onset isand if it feels like LSD. Finalizing if Im convinced its real.<br /><br />Now abcdefg has to come in here and mention mitanox&#039;s name like the vendor did. Which makes me even more skeptical. Look at his forum activity and you&#039;ll understand why.<br /><br />The only way to reach the resolution team is by clicking resolve once its available correct?<br /><br />Should I be considering a reagent test? I really wanted to bring some acid to this show my friend and I are going to and I don&#039;t have another 100 dollars for another ten strip ...

				Mitanox left the scene about two weeks ago and doesn&#039;t have any plans to return soon as far as I know. Right before he left he bought a bunch of sheets of the hofmann and shiva blotters and sold them to some of his long term customers for a good price as a going away present. Hopefully he returns some time in the future cause we could definitely use some more lsd vendors with decent prices. It looks like Marceline has some of these same tabs listed for a pretty good price ($80/10) but no feedback and apparently had some quality issues with MDMA in the past. The listings have been up for at least a week so I would image there should be some reviews soon

				Hey guys I just got home from work and dosed three tabs. My gut is telling me they&#039;re still an rc or nothing (which puzzles me about the taste). They were swallowed which should prove that its LSD if it works. <br /><br />T 05 minutes - they were swallowed the same biter taste noticed.&nbsp; Though not as tongue numbing and repulsively bitter as dox. Nbome is a milder bitter compared to dox correct?<br /><br />I really wanted to be able to share the magic of LSD with my girl. The sad thing is that I almost went with ggw who has had nothing but good reviews on his LSD but i didn&#039;t have the coin in time. :/<br /><br /><br />

				Concerning the possibility of RCs on your blotter, I&#039;d say given your tests it&#039;s probably a DOx (or similar). <br /><br />That being said, I&#039;d like to remind everyone that LSD by itself can give off a slight metallic taste, Hofmann himself noted this, although it&#039;s questionable if the taste is simply a physiological response instead of the chemical actually possessing a taste. Even more likely are the inks, sheets, and general handling that give off a taste. I&#039;ve had genuine LSD in the past that did give off a slight metallic taste.

				Well guys I ended up in the ER last night. I lied about the swallowing just because I wanted to see if it was an rc. I took the three sublingually. I went to my buddies house smoked some weed for a few hours. After 3 hours I felt nothing. I was driving home from my friends house around 230 when my heart just started racing ridiculously. <br /><br />I made it home to tell my family who brought me to the ER after my heart wouldn&#039;t calm down after sitting and trying to relax. Well I went to the ER, turns out my heart muscle has inflammation. The best thing is that by the time I arrived to the ER my pupils were huge, I had a headache, and I had some shitty RC visuals. No enhancement of color and the visuals were not lsd like at all. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to the cardiologist tomorrow. The sad thing is I&#039;m only 19. I&#039;m not sure if I should thank jamesbrown for this harsh wake up call. Half kidding because that scumbag had been convincing me these were reagent tested and tested by himself and were the real deal. Not to mention the low post suspicious accounts vouching for him.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want my damn coin back because I have no use for it. I&#039;m going to try and resolve and see if I can donate my coin to the road. James does not deserve it and he&#039;s the kind of vendor that makes this place dangerous. It&#039;s been said before and I&#039;ll say it again... There&#039;s a special place in hell for the people that pass RCs off as lsd. <br />

				I am sorry to hear about the heart condition but it had absolutely nothing to do with the tabs I sold you. These blotters are mass produced in the millions and every other review I got from them has been positive. The taste is the same with all the hofmann/shiva/alice in wonderland blotters and they have all been proven to be legit LSD. The batch I recently got was reagent tested and tested by me personally and there was no issue (other than they could have been more potent). There is a review from another customer of mine here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7077.msg354313#msg354313 who had a great time. I know it is meaningless due to the low post count but it is legitimate. I have better things to do with my time that write up fake trip reports to try and convince you to finalize your $90 order. I have had nearly 250 sales and have never scammed anyone or sold them something other than what it was advertised as. My feedback can be found here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0b36a9a347 . If you are so certain that it is an RC please buy a reagent test yourself and post the results since you have a few tabs left. You are the only person who had an issue with these tabs and seem to think there is a big conspiracy to scam you out of a small amount of money. It sounds like a shitty situation with your heart but it&#039;s not fair to come on here and badmouth me and say my product is an RC when it isn&#039;t. Please do some research on the group that lays these blotters and the taste and you will find overwhelming evidence that it is LSD and nothing else.

				If it was real LSD explain the onset time of 2-3 hours.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t sound like LSD to me. It really didn&#039;t feel like it and there was no enhanced color. <br /><br />If a veteran member wants the rest of these for testing purposes I&#039;m willing to ship them. <br /><br />I&#039;m finalizing cause I have no use for coins or anything.

				You could&#039;ve just had a panic attack.<br /><br />I would test one since I&#039;ve tried LSD over 20 times and I&#039;m pretty sure I know what it feels like. But I hate the bitter taste too. Almost puked on the same blotters that I got elsewhere.

				I&#039;m not saying the tabs put me in the hospital. They may have contributed to slightly raising my heart rate but as I now know I have inflammation.<br /><br />Anyways I got some news, I waited two hours for a five minute examination from the cardiologist who was more interested in his vacation he was talking about than me. He listened to my chest with a stethoscope said I was fine and it was probably just stress. He even recommended seeing a psychiatrist. Needless to say I&#039;m going to be making an appt with a different doctor. <br /><br />Inflammation and pain are not something I&#039;ve had before. Again it was not caused by the tabs because my general doctor had referred me to a cardiologist earlier that morning hours before dosing.

				Sucks to hear about your situation.&nbsp; Hope you are ok.<br /><br />Ive tripped on lucy 4-6 times and the best times they had a metallic taste like mentioned.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ive tried DOC a couple of times and it was way different than acid. It was speedy but only psychologically...and not physically for example, no sweating, no shaking, etc..but i was in a trance and my mind was running so fast i barely remember those trips...no real fun to them. Idk why people buy em

				I found out my diagnosis pericarditis. Nothing permanent or too serious. It definitely gave me an opportunity to reevaluate my life.<br /><br />Most of the people I know keep mentioning zombies and bath salts when I talk about rcs lol.

				Shitty troll is shit.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the DEA really did troll. all dea agents should run over the border guns ablazing and go Rambo on Mexican cartels. Two birds one stone<br /><br />
