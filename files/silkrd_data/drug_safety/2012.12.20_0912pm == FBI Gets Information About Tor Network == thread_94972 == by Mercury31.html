				https://secure.security.nl/artikel/44359/1/FBI_krijgt_les_in_Tor-gebruik.html<br /><br />FBI gets lesson in Tor-use<br />Sunday, 16:11 by editor<br />Investigation Services such as the FBI regularly get with Tor, both while doing research on crime as their own work, reason for the Tor Project to FBI conferences regularly visit. Tor is a program where Internet users and Internet activists anonymously, although it also prevents criminals use it, as with any other technology.<br /><br />Tor developer Roger Dingledine Tor tries the relationship between justice and to maintain and appears regularly at conferences. &quot;My first goal is them all the good things of Tor to point, so if they ever argue for anonymity on the internet ban, they understand what they give up.&quot;<br /><br />Raid<br />The second goal is Dingledine explain what Tor is and how it works. This should prevent detection services that a Tor IP address found no raid at the innocent owner of a Tor exit node, or which arrest. Tor allows Internet traffic running on different computers. The exit node is the last computer in the chain that the request of the Tor-user to the web forward.<br /><br />If a Tor user is suspicious, the track at the IP address of the Tor exit node end. One of the FBI agents who spoke Dingledine seems that even realizing it. &quot;I have ten clues and 48 hours before this case no longer matters. If you can let me understand which tracks I should not follow, I can do my job better,&quot; he told to the developer know.<br /><br />Anonymous<br />Finally helps Dingledine Tor to the FBI for their work to better use. &quot;Remember that diversity is part of users so everyone can safely use Tor,&quot; he notes. Yet the developer is also the question whether there is not really an option for users to follow.<br /><br />&quot;When I went to several of his FBI colleagues showed that told me they Tor for their daily work, and asked if he would like it if we could have a way to trace them, he understood.&quot;

				haha, I actually didn&#039;t use the search function. It blows anyway. I knew it was a recent thread so I went through each page of the Off Topic section and Ctrl+F&#039;ed for &quot;FBI&quot;. Found it about 5 pages back. :)
