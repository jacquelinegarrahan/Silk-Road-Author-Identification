				Almost every time i snort a tenth of H or so the next day i get the worst sick feeling ever.<br /><br />I used to never get this feeling and it&#039;s starting to become frightening, I always feel sick when i wake up<br /><br />Stomach turning horribly. So i make myself throw up. (Can&#039;t throw up without sticking fingers in my throat.)<br /><br />My throw up after some H is always this dark green sludge that taste&#039;s peppery lol.<br /><br />Is my body growing a dependency? There&#039;s never a feeling of want for H afterwards and I never do more H while i&#039;m feeling sick the day after.<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious..

				Man, I feel bad for like 4-5 days. I just can&#039;t justify it, personally. I don&#039;t really take it any more because those poor after effects last too long, and I don&#039;t think the effects are really that great, either. =/

				O the nasty sludge.&nbsp; Its most likely not withdrawl if you feel fine afterwards without using for the next couple of days(2-3).&nbsp; That being said I always thought that it was just a result of the dope slowing down bodily functions, like digestion, so when you goto bed with a somewhat full stomach, you wake up puking some greenish/black shit. Could be totally wrong about that though.

				i got that type of hangover feeling when I started using as well. As your body gets use to it, it seems to go away.

				all opiates produce a nausea factor, dose/individual dependent...<br /><br />antihistamines (careful!!!!) or weed help this go down. <br /><br />my god, i was mixing coke, k, and h one time, and needless to say, when everything was said and done, the h came out on top, and so did my stomach contents&nbsp; :-[ lol
