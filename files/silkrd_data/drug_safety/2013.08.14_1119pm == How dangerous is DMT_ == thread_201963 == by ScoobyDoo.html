				So my friends don&#039;t like DMT because they have been told that it&#039;s made up of &quot;meth chemicals&quot;.<br />I personally don&#039;t know how to make DMT, but something tells me they aren&#039;t correct about this.<br /><br /><br />Anyone care to comment on this?

				Tell them to shut the fuck up and to do some research, because they&#039;re way off.&nbsp; It&#039;s in a different class (tryptamine) altogether from meth.&nbsp; The only danger with this is just like with any other psychedelic: potential psychological blowback.

				dmt is an endogenous neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the human brain, very similar in structure to serotonin. the only danger is your own mind. relax and allow the experience to unfold. resistance creates fear which can only be conquered by love and acceptance. :)

				Being dumbasses, your friends see DiMETHyltryptamine and presume it means that it contains meth. Personally I feel that idiots who don&#039;t understand very basic nomenclature concepts of chemistry should be allowed to do drugs.

				Thank you for all your replies!<br />I know they will never believe me. I tried telling them that it&#039;s a natural occuring substance that is already inside of us but they just look it at as made up of &quot;meth chemicals&quot;.<br /><br />I smoked some myself this afternoon, and realized that everything in my life is only bringing me down. <br />The choices I make, my drug use, &amp; the people I associate with. Nothing I&#039;ve been doing has been positive for me in anyway and I decided that I wanted to make a change. To turn my life around. I came to this revelation that I really need to get my act together. My friends think it&#039;s just the DMT and that I need to quit smoking it on the regular. Which I thought was very strange because I don&#039;t have a problem with psychs, nor do I use them on the regular. I have to mentally prepare myself everytime I attempt to smoke DMT because it is so powerful. I certainly don&#039;t abuse it like I abuse weed. I don&#039;t see how anyone could. I&#039;ve honestly only done it a handful of times but because I&#039;m the only person out of our group of friends that has ever purchased it, I feel as if I&#039;m looked upon them as some sort of DMT junkie. <br /><br />I guess I need to start hanging out with a more informed, educated crowd.<br /><br />Thanks for all the support.

I am on the same situation brother.<br />Fortunately in my case, I moved in a new country some months ago and after having this feeling that my friends look me like DMT junkie I stopped talking about it with those who &quot;advice&quot; me to quit it. And yes being new to a city gives you the opportunity to &quot;format&quot; your friend and choose new friends who share similar opinions. <br /><br />Just stop talking about dmt with them. So many years that you are friends and dmt wasn&#039;t there you were ok. Don&#039;t let a substance and their ignorance/fear about it, blur your friendship. <br /><br />And I will quote again this:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201963.msg1451692#msg1451692">Quote from: ScoobyDoo on August 15, 2013, 01:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I know they will never believe me.
