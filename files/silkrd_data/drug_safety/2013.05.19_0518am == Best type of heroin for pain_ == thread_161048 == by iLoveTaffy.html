				I can&#039;t afford the 30mg Roxis, or that&#039;s what I&#039;d be buying. But they&#039;re just so expensive, it&#039;s not realistic. Heroin is a lot cheaper.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gone to countless doctors but they all laugh me off as a drug seeker. Well, here I am, seeking drugs, because they won&#039;t give me them legally. Well, whatever. Guess I get to be a criminal just to get a bit of pain relief. Hah!<br /><br />Anyway... I&#039;m going to be shooting it up. Might as well get 100% bio-availability since I&#039;m already gonna be using heroin anyway.<br /><br />But yeah, best kind to get? I&#039;m a total heroin noob. I&#039;ve never used it before, and I have no opiate tolerance (though my natural tolerance is quite high. I need at least 20mg oxy to get any semblance of pain relief at all).&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks a lot guys.

				In theory heroin is heroin is heroin.&nbsp; The cuts might have some of an effect, but the base molecule is the same regardless of tar, powder, 4,3, etc.&nbsp; Tar is thought to have more 3 and 6 monoacetylmorphine in it, so it might have a different feeling to it then the others.<br /><br />Heroin 4, china white, ecp whatever you want to call it, is generally thought to be more pure then the other forms of heroin.&nbsp; You can cut anything though, so the answer isn&#039;t as straightforward as you probably want.

Heroin is heroin is heroin. Good to know. I&#039;ll probably stick with heroin 4 then. <br /><br />Thanks, friend.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be careful, Dingo. Thank you. If it turns into a dirty habit, well so be it. That&#039;s not my fault. Pain doctors are supposed to treat pain, not laugh in your face thinking you&#039;re some addict looking for his next hit (psh, I don&#039;t have any drug record whatsoever, I&#039;ve never had a dirty urine test, and I never abuse my prescriptions).<br /><br />Thanks guys.
