				You guys dont need to be cutting it anymore than it already is...plus you guys are starting to use things that oil up upon basification and its gets harder and harder to get my shit clean even after I cook it...At least cut it with something that cooks away, and doesn&#039;t try to oil lock into what little cocaine oil is there.....People should know that cocaine oil or crack freebase can be brought back into a salt using delude hydrochloric acid and evaporing on glass to be snorted again..<br /><br /><br />Vado, over in the Rumor Mill I just started a thread called Hardly No coaine In the Cocaine on Sr Yet...And after my lengthy post I suggested you as a possible new domestic source and that I was gonna try you....but come now man!! I gotta go take that quote down now.<br /><br />PS. And I hate to even help people who are cutting but for GODSAKE use something thats water soluble so your not clogging and fucking up peoples noses. People if your nose is tossing it back out it means its not cocaine as cocaine is extremely soluble in water and the moister in your nose is enough to make it dissapear. Anything that immediatly doesnt drip, for the most part is not cocaine, or its mixed with enough junk that the drip is being prolonged. True cocaine drips as soon as it hits!

				What would be the ideal thing to cut with eternalcausation? Obviously using nothing to cut is ideal, but if you had to pick one thing to cut with. What would it be?
