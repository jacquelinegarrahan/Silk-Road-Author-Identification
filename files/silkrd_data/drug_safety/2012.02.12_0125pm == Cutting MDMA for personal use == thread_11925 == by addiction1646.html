				So I&#039;ve purchased MDMA from several vendors on the SR, and my experience has been pretty much the same across the board ... the MDMA is AWESOME, but I feel like I need something a little speedier.&nbsp; I want to spend like 100% of my time dancing...currently, I&#039;ll spend maybe 50% dancing, and the other 50% in a euphoric state, cuddling with the softest thing I can find.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, this is awesome, but I wanna dance!<br /><br /><br />My options for cutting the MDMA are currently the following<br />-OTC Caffine<br />-Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin)<br />-Dextroamphetamine+Levoamphetamine (Adderall)<br /><br />What would y&#039;all recommend?&nbsp; Also, if there is a formulation of a speedier MDMA that you personally like, but isn&#039;t included in this list, don&#039;t hesitate to tell me.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				If you don&#039;t like the euphoric state just take some speed. I think you&#039;re missing the point of MDMA. It is an amphetamine as well. I&#039;d hate to have mine cut, ymmv....

				well, i find caffeine is nice to mitigate the sleepiness that i get when coming up, and really nice as it leaves my system for when the mdma kicks in fully, so i&#039;m not twweaking out from too much caffeine, which is something im prone to.<br /><br />to give you that continued stamina, i&#039;d suggest adderall. the speed adds nicely to the roll, and def gives you more energy/incentive to move around, rather than sit on your ass. at the same time, it makes the comedown so much worse....<br /><br />tbh, try different phenethylamines, or tryptamines, i&#039;ve found that there are, subjectively, better things that i may want to reach for instead of mdma if i want to be raving my balls off..<br /><br />or add them to the stack, using an mdma drop as baseline lol

				150-175 is a bit much of the MDMA these vendors carry to expect to not be floored for some of it. Try 100-125. And if you were going to mix anything with it, I&#039;d say adderall. Maybe 30 mgs XR or so.

				I know exactly what you mean. When I first started getting real molly online, it wasn&#039;t quite the same as the E pills I would normally get around town. I was used to a speeder high. The truth is, dancing is not the perfect activity for MDMA. Chilling in a jaccuzi with some hot chicks is the perfect activity for MDMA (+LSD IMO). The pills probably have a little MDMA with a mix of some kind of speed, could me MDA, Meth, or plenty of speedy RCs out there too.<br /><br />I once asked the same thing your asking. Eventually, I decided I prefer the MDMA + LSD combo. If I were to mix it up, it would be with MDA. If you really just want to dance like a crazy man all night, straight Meth is probably the drug of choice. But I don&#039;t recommend it. Meth&#039;s a bad, bad, ba-a-a-ad drug. Try the molly + LSD combo. I think you&#039;ll really like it a lot.<br /><br />You know, one thing I don&#039;t see around SR is 4-Methylaminorex / 4-MAR / U4EA aka Ice--though that term gets confused with Meth most of the time. It is supposedly *the shit* when it comes to stimulants. I would definitely like to give that a go just from all the good stuff I&#039;ve heard about it.

				Hi,<br />Reduce the dosage seems a good idea, you could try 120mg and then 60mg later if you want to extend the effects. Maybe you can also try pills, I have heard that press pills hit harder than molly even if they only contain MDMA.<br /><br />WL

				do not cut your product. it makes no sense. if you want a speedier high you can take them separate. try taking a lower dosage, but please god no do not, i repeat, do not cut what you have if it&#039;s already so pure. pure mdma is a blessing.
