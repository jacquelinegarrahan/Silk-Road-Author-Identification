				I just saw a documentary about &#039;scopolamine&#039; which is also known as &#039;the devil&#039;s breath&#039;.<br />Does anyone have experience with this drug? In what situations do you use it and how does it feel??<br />I&#039;d like some inside knowledge about the drug

				I have made a tea from tree datura or brugmasia( I think I am spelling it wrong) and the first few times was very fun extremely dissociative vision very blurry could not make out peoples faces would call one person another persons name that was not even around and not to mention being up the 24-36 hours totally spun the fuck out.<br /><br />then one time I made too strong of a batch blacked out for like 10hours and was high as fuck for another 3 days all in all I was very young and naive and now I tell everyone to NEVER do it I can not believe it is sold on SR the product is LITERALLY the most lethal shit I know someone who is permanently mental because of mixing Datura (they make scopolomine&nbsp; out of this) and morning glory seeds in excess.<br /><br />If you think you can handle your shit be VERY VERY careful

				^If you want to research on Datura or Brugmansia the best ROA is through the skin, via an ointment. This is the most worthwhile approach with all the Nightshade family plants in general. Through the skin the most poisonous effects of the plants don&#039;t pass the fat barrier and moreover you can control the amount of drug that gets absorbed in your system.<br /><br />This or, if you really want to use an oral ROA (not recommended until you know what you are doing), use a plant that has sort of antagonistic effects causing the most poisonous aspects to be reduced or stopped altogether. And example about a typical Shaman concoction that does this is Brugmansia + Brunfelsia.<br /><br />One thing to notice then is this: tropanes effect (the good ones, the very vivid hallucinations) take place in the boundary between sleep and awake, i.e. the trance state. If you have the drug to bring you to that state by itself this will mean that you will much probably have to poison yourself. So, the right thing, the &quot;secret&quot; to work correctly with the Nightshades plants (but with all entheogens in reality, it is just that with tropanes this is even truer) is to not let the plant do everything by itself but instead reaching a trance state while you are under the effect or mix the plants with others that can bring you to that state (for example opiates are a very good mix just for this and in fact the so-called witches salve was much probably made by a mix of Nightshades + Poppy pods; just be careful because both sum up their effects).<br /><br />In reality you need little amount to do have very good effects out of Nightshades if you keep this in mind, an amount that is much inferior to the one you would need to bring the very nasty poisonous effects. I&#039;ve personally used Datura and Henbane a lot in the past and if used correctly they can give you a kind of &quot;power&quot; that you cannot obtain with any other drug.

				...scopolamine? ...as in henbane, datura, belladonna, wolfsbane, jimson weed, and deadly nightshade?<br />Holy shit, people. Really?<br /><br />#1) Don&#039;t fuck with this. No, seriously. I&#039;m not your mom, I don&#039;t know you, and still I&#039;m saying...<br />Don&#039;t fuck with this.<br /><br />#2) If you do fuck with this, KNOW WHAT YOU&#039;RE DOING! This isn&#039;t like smoking a little pot or takin&#039; some X, this is an investment. The entire Solanaceae family is considered toxic and poisonous... because it actually is. If you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing, you can easily kill yourself. If you dose just a little too much, you can wind up on a 3 day trip in which you know nothing truthful about your surroundings, because scopolamine is not a hallucinagenic, it&#039;s not a stimulant, it&#039;s not an empathogen, it&#039;s not a phenethylamine or any other traditional psychedelic...<br /><br />It&#039;s a deliriant... and on a hard trip, you will actually be delirious. It&#039;s not much like hallucinating.<br />Hallucinations from typical psychedelics are merely distortions of your current perceptions. You can tell they aren&#039;t real.<br />Deliriants can create new things in your perception that weren&#039;t there before... and you will have no idea that these new additions aren&#039;t real. You may not only see God, but shake His hand and have a conversation with Him, the entire time never even realizing how entirely out of the ordinary the occurance actually is. Unsettling to be sure... even more so if the entity that appears is Satan or some other nightmare. For real...<br />Add to this the after-effects like confusion, lack of coordination, giant pupils, etc for a week or more and it&#039;s an experience that I personally don&#039;t care to repeat.<br /><br />Remember, Erowid.org is your friend. Go there and search for scopolamine and datura. Read the effects, dosage, trip reports, etc. Educate yourself... and then if you&#039;re still bat-shit crazy about the notion, be careful.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200354.msg1446572#msg1446572">Quote from: BlackIris on August 13, 2013, 05:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">^If you want to research on Datura or Brugmansia the best ROA is through the skin, via an ointment.

Oral injestion from a variable natural source (such as datura) is inadvisable. You don&#039;t know how much you&#039;re taking. It&#039;s very easy to take too much.<br /><br />Trivia:<br />Roman women used datura and nightshade to make their pupils large, which was considered attractive.<br />Scopolamine is used in eye drops to make your pupils large so your retina can be inspected for problems.<br />My wife used a prescription bladder anticeptic that really fucked-up her vision. When I looked up the contents... scopolamine! Distorted vision was even listed as a common side effect.

This was in the Psychology department of a major university. I do not know what the basis of the research was, but they paid me $50 :) My understanding was that it was a research project about memory, not scopolamine. The scopoloamine was just the standard safe anticholinergic drug.<br /><br />All in all I found it mildly unpleasant. The drug was boring, had unpleasant side effects and produced zero euphoria. It was not a dose high enough to hallucinate or produce delirium. (And honestly I want no part of anticholinergic delirium).<br /><br />All that stuff about suggestibility and zombies is fabricated nonsense. And really should it surprise anyone? They used to say similar stuff about chloral hydrate, sodium thiopental, tetrodotoxin, etc. It&#039;s just urban legend perpetuated by fake journalism.

So you can take that for what it&#039;s worth. But I&#039;m highly skeptical.<br /><br />I mean, wasn&#039;t it The Serpent and the Rainbow that claimed pufferfish venom was used in Voodoo to turn people into zombie slaves? Another &quot;journalistic&quot; account. These stories have been poopooed by science since the beginning.
