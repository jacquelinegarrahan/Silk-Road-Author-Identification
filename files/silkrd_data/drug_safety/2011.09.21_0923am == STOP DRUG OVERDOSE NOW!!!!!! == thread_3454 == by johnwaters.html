				Hello SR Family!!!<br /><br />If you are looking to find a great way to end a potential overdose then read this!!!!<br /><br />I am a frequent speed-baller (Cocaine &amp; Oxycodone). I have taken up to an 8-ball of cocaine and up to 180 mg of Oxycodone in 1 day. When doing this there have been times when I feel as if respiratory depression is setting in. I get to the point were i can barely breathe. What I take as a precautionary measure is activated charcoal (You can Google it and buy online, or visit your local health food store). I keep a bottle of activated charcoal on hand and mix about 6 heaping tablespoons with a glass of water and guzzle it down; and repeat if needed. Continue to drink as much water as possible after this to get the charcoal flowing through your system. This will absorb the drugs in your body and prevent overdose, and it just might save your life. Always keep this on hand especially when combining drugs that should not be mixed. <br /><br />Just keep in mind though that taking activated charcoal will absorb all toxins and drugs in your body, and it will be about 12 to 24 hours before you can get high again! But I guess that&#039;s better then never being able to get high again because you did not make it though!!! {{^_^}}<br /><br />Hopes this help everyone!!!

				Thanks for posting this johnwaters! Activated carbon is awesome. In addition to overdose, it works also for chemical poisoning and food poisoning, and bacteria-borne stomach illnesses. Always good to have some handy!

				I&#039;ve never heard of this either.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-[&nbsp; I thought charcoal only worked on stomach contents, not the bloodstream.&nbsp; This makes perfect sense though.<br /><br />Thanks for the post!&nbsp; Great info.&nbsp; Another reason SR is such a great resource.

				I looked this up online, and it&#039;s listed as an overdose prevention measure. One site says, &quot;Activated charcoal may be given to help bind drugs and keep them in the stomach and intestines. This reduces the amount absorbed into the blood. The drug, bound to the charcoal, is then expelled in the stool. &quot;<br /><br />This is really good to know. I have many times binged on cocaine and feared something bad was going to happen. Occasionally I didn&#039;t have access to benzos or alcohol. This sounds like a good way to end a binge early, if it&#039;s true that you can&#039;t get high again after drinking the solution. I can imagine myself saving the rest of the stash for another time, drinking the stuff and popping a valium and calling it a night. Even if I was craving more, there would be no excuse to do it. <br /><br />Pretty awesome find if all the OP says is true. There&#039;s nothing in the world that scares me more than being hospitalized or worse from using drugs. <br /><br />How long does it take after drinking for the signs of overdose to subside?

				Everybody please be cautious with this one and do your own research...&nbsp; I was always under the impression that, as mentioned in this thread, ingesting activated charcoal only stopped poisons (drugs, whatever) from being absorbed through the GI tract, and then only PARTIALLY so.&nbsp; Anything in your bloodstream already, your stuck with!&nbsp; And administering drugs through a different route (IV, IM, insuffilated, etc.. anything other than swallowing lol) would bypass the charcoal altogether.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL<br /><br />In fact after some consideration I decided to come back and edit.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t rely on this, especially considering the context that the OP provided.&nbsp; I assume OP is not &quot;eating&quot; his speedballs!&nbsp; The ONLY ROI this is indicated for in case of overdose is oral ingestion, and the activated carbon will only slow the release of whatever active chemicals in the gut that&nbsp; haven&#039;t been absorbed already.&nbsp; It&#039;s not totally effective even at that.<br /><br />Please be careful with dosage and source.&nbsp; Activated carbon likely will not be of much help.<br />If you are messing with opiates having Naloxone on hand could be a life saver however, and I believe one vendor on SR was holding some.&nbsp; DO your research!

				once its in the blood stream charcoal isn&#039;t going to help at all. Narcan is needed for opiates, i dont know what they use for cocaine od&#039;s but the best way not to overdose is not take too much...

				Agreed with last 2 posts and i said both these things.&nbsp; THIS IS HARM REDUCTION!&nbsp; Now there just may be a couple people who read OP post and think they are safe trying to take it to the limit.&nbsp; I&#039;m all about the freedom this place represents, but there is no place for this post in this forum!
