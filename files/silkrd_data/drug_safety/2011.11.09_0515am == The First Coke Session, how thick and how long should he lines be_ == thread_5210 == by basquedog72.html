				Got a really nice gm in the mail and since I had only watched do it , I got a razor blade and cut the chunk into dust.&nbsp; I made short think lines to be safe, and then lengthened and widened my lines .&nbsp; With very little asistance, I knocked down the gram bag in 6 hours.&nbsp; Is that a bit excessive?&nbsp;

				You may want to look over the &quot;How do you snort coke.&quot; thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3979.0<br /><br />BF, I quoted your response from here into that thread because I think its a grand idea.<br /><br />basquedog72, I tend to do a tiny line first, just to judge what I&#039;m dealing with. Even from what is supposed to be the same batch from the same vendor, things can vary. Also, I wait a minimum of 5 minutes before passing judgement and even that&#039;s too fast I think. Assuming it&#039;s all good, I tend to do a semi-hefty first line followed by my average sized lines as maintenance about 45 minutes apart, all lines measured from my bullet. I think its really important to measure out each line and know where its at in comparison to your average. For me, an average line is two decent cupfuls from my bullet (no idea what mg that would be) and hefty is three cupfuls. For me, anything over these measurements is just being wasteful. <br /><br />Next time I have access, I&#039;m totally changing to BF&#039;s formula for maintenance and see how it goes.<br /><br />Lastly, when I have quality product, 1g in 6 hours would be something I consider excessive, if only out of consideration for how much material I&#039;m trying to make my sinus membranes absorb. At some point I think doing more is a waste because my sinuses are just over-saturated and could benefit from some saline spray and some time off. However, everyone is different and we&#039;ve all had our excessive moments for sure.

				Hey Torn,&nbsp; I measured a filled bullet cup at 70mg which is a pretty nice, average line if you dump it out.&nbsp; &nbsp; I like using the bullet sometimes.&nbsp; The powder seems to &quot;hit&quot; farther up the sinuses with the bullet.<br /><br />And after reading about it somewhere on here, the Neti Pot is great after an evening of snow.&nbsp; They&#039;re about $10 at any drug store or Wal-Mart and really do a great job of flushing the crap out of your nasal cavity.&nbsp; But the quality of the product will dictate how much flushing you&#039;ll need to do.<br /><br />

				Again, it all depends on the quality of the product.<br /><br />Start small, then increase.<br /><br />I did that with Ketamine on my very first time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a wise decision, because the effects started to build up slowly, but consistently.&nbsp; I had a wonderful experience.

				1 gram in 6 hours is a substantial amount of blow to do. 1 gram is about 10-15 lines, more like 15. A 100mg (0.1 g) line is a lot, so if you did 15 lines in 6 hours you were doing a line every 20-30 min.......... for 6 hours, thats a binge.<br /><br />When i line one out i try and make it so its strong enough to feel and last for the longest duration the quality of the blow can afford.

				Anytime I start an evening of coke I start with &quot;spider legs&quot; short and thin. I find for me it lasts longer that way and the weird habits I do happen later.
