				I&#039;ve been on a moderate dose (65mg) of Methadone for the past 2 months, and I&#039;ve come to find that opiates don&#039;t satisfy any cravings I get-- as expected with Methadone. I try not to use, but occasionally the craving is so intense that I can&#039;t help it. <br /><br />Last night I had a very weird dream that involved using, and as soon as I woke up I had an epiphany... why not do coke instead? So I bought some (off the streets) and I&#039;m very much enjoying it. I&#039;ve only done it once or twice before but I might start doing it more often, as long as it&#039;s not dangerous to do while on m&#039;done. The clinic I go to only lets me raise my dose 5mg every 4 days. Hopefully some day my dose will be high enough to eliminate cravings and I wont have the urge to use coke any longer, but for now I think this is the best way for me to be comfortable and functional.<br /><br />I know that speed balls are dangerous, but does methadone+coke carry the same risks as heroin+coke? What kind of risks do I face by doing coke while on methadone maintenance?<br /><br />tl;dr: Coke+methadone, dangerous or no?

				When you are doing any downer and a upper you are speedballing.<br /><br />Redbull and vodka or jager bombs are considered speedballing.<br /><br />Coke and benzos are speedballing.<br /><br />You get my point so yeah you are speedballing but as long as neither of your methadone or coke dose are crazy high you should be fine. Shouldn&#039;t really do more than 250-500mg of coke per day if you want to keep it safe.&nbsp; Plus doing more never helps.&nbsp; Might I add that you are enjoying the coke very much because you are on methadone.&nbsp; You are feeling the euphoric effects of coke while the methadone is killing off any of the jittery effects and also making you feel relaxed. Basically you are feeling the best of both drugs.&nbsp; Perfect mix imo.<br /><br />I love speedballing and when I don&#039;t have any opiates, benzos are my second favorite to do coke on.&nbsp;

				Using Coke &amp; Methadone is not going to cause you to OD unless the Coke is cut with a CNS depressant which occasionally it is but the Coke has been known to cause a more rapid methadone clearance within the body just be mindful of that.<br /><br />It seems as if you are being tapered up is 65mls your therapeutic dose - you have only been on it for 2 months also watch out for any urine screening as well DM me if you want to chat

				If you want an advice from someone that has experienced the thing: go away from Methadone as fast as possible (you are yet in a moderate dose and you don&#039;t take it from much time, scale fast and remove it completely). Once it is some time you use it and it enters your system completely you will never remove it (the withdrawals of Methadone last a looooong time and they are awful).<br /><br />If you can (and you can if you want) avoid Methadone as the plague; it is thousands times worse than H and coke together elevated at the second potency. I would prefer to stand the withdrawals of heroin 10 times than taking methadone ever again.<br /><br />Whatever you do remove that shit from your system asap. The longer you wait the more difficult it will be to remove. I know people that take that shit from 20 years and they have it in their bones, it is as much a part of themselves as their brain. When you get to the point that you feel the difference between taking 0.5 ml and nothing you know you are in deep deep trouble.<br /><br />In your particular case I would utilize the scaling of methadone along coke to remove the withdrawals from H, hence taking two birds with one stone. It will not take much time; maybe you will have to suffer a little at the end (when the methadone is really low - you can also use some benzos to help yourself here, maybe either DMT in place of the coke at that point) but always better than enduring the withdrawals from methadone (if you don&#039;t know them remember to yourself you are a lucky man, no matter the current condition you are/will be in).
