				i think i need a bit of a break. ive been watching porn nonstop since i started meth 6 months ago and even a peek at porn is enough to send me into an impulsive, destructive (not agressive or violent) round of meth cravings. i seem to be able to go a week until it starts to hit me... a meth craving lands me on the bed for 5 or 6 hours.. <br /><br />if ive got meth in a safe the safe gets smashed.. well my last one did. nothing gets eaten, things get delayed.. 1 minute waiting feels like hours when not on the pipe<br /><br /><br />i can go 1 or 2 weeks but a month? fuck i dont think so.<br /><br />got any tips to start on a 1 or 2 month break? its scary just how a peek of boobs can send me off into a craving that knocks me off my feet when 5 minutes previous nothing was a problem.<br /><br />i think for starters ill have to pack away the porno<br /><br /><br />i wanna hear from people that had to learn how to go without<br /><br />

Meth does make you want to fuck anything and everything (figuratively speaking of course) but at the same time, you have to realize that there is a time and a place for everything. If your having trouble deciding how to stop thinking about porn so much, you answered your own question by stating you should pack it away! Out of sight, out of mind! Only bring the porn out if you intend to get on the gear and you want to indulge yourself. Obviously, the porn is triggering these impulsive meth cravings for you. Remove the temptation until you learn how to control the urges. If you can&#039;t do that, then maybe meth is not the drug for you as it&#039;s dictating how you live your life.&nbsp; :)

I know your brain tells you when you get some meth that you have to get on it and stay on it until you literally run out. However, I&#039;ve taught myself to get on it and have some fun but after a while, stop using and try to grab some food and sleep. Easier said then done I know but over time, you&#039;ll get used to it and it will become a habit. :) :)
