				Anyone know a good place to buy gel-caps in Australia (pref over the counter with cash, not online)??<br /><br />I would even be happy getting some vitamin pills and refilling them, just not sure which brand is good and easily refillable.<br /><br />Something from Coles or Woolies would be cool, or anyone know what health food stores sell them??

				Most health food type places should have them, just ask. I&#039;ve only been able to find them in large sizes though which isn&#039;t preferable because if your selling your caps it makes it look like there isn&#039;t much in there.<br /><br />You can find the small sizes online.

				I went to the chemist when I was looking for them and asked for gelatine capsules so I could make my own herbal supplements.... I got a bit of a strange look.<br /><br /><br />If you only want to make a few just empty some other caps I guess, you usually have to buy the empty ones in lots of like 1000.<br /><br />www.gelcapsules.com.au :)

				Go to health food store and they sell empty caps, OR even better just hit up one of those bodybuilder supplement stores, they have roiders buying all sorts of shit and they are always selling shit that is close to illegal as you can get, so they dont give a fuck who walks in and buys what.

				Hey mate,<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought gel caps from regular chemists/pharmacies plenty of times.<br /><br />I try to visit different stores each time but have returned to one a couple of times, weeks apart, as I remember where they keep the caps and don&#039;t have to ask for help.<br /><br />So far, I&#039;ve used 2 cover stories when necessary, without a raised eyebrow to be seen, except for one lady but I&#039;m pretty sure she was just a cunt (I have quite a few tattoos and tend to get that same look every now and then, whether I&#039;m buying gel caps or a sandwich ::) )<br /><br />One story was: &quot;Hi, I&#039;m shooting a short film and I&#039;m looking for some capsules that our makeup team can fill with fake blood, for a fight scene&quot;. Totally plausible as I actually had to buy caps once whilst at Uni, for this exact purpose. Plus you can spark up an interesting conversation with them about your imaginary film, which distracts them somewhat.<br /><br />The other story is simply that &quot;I&#039;m looking for some empty capsules that I can fill with a mix of body building supplements that I ordered online, tryin&#039; to bulk up a little bit *smile*&quot;.<br /><br />The main thing I think, is just to be completely relaxed and friendly and maybe act like you&#039;re not sure if they stock anything like that (gel caps). <br /><br />Either that or have a browse around and you may not have to talk to anyone about it at all.<br /><br />In my experience, they&#039;re usually kept down low on the shelf and have always been branded Surgipak, in a white plastic bottle of 100 &quot;00 size Empty Gelatine Capsules&quot;. The labeling is printed on the bottle in red.<br /><br />The only &quot;issue&quot; I had once was the person I spoke to didn&#039;t know anything about empty caps and called the pharmacist over, who then offered to order them in. I politely declined and said I&#039;d go to somewhere else as I needed them for the coming weekend.<br /><br />Stick to the large Chemist Supermarket/Warehouse type stores. They&#039;re usually busier, sell a shitload of supplement stuff and have a more &quot;in/out&quot; kind of vibe.<br /><br />Good luck bro, you&#039;ll be sweet.

				Vitamin shops, places that sell weird herbs and shit. <br /><br />Don&#039;t know what the problem is, nobody has ever asked &quot;why&quot; I was looking for them, but if they did I would probably reply &quot;because I want to buy them.&quot;

And I can leave some panadol in there and prevent headaches too. Perfect.

				He he, I posted about these a week ago in an intl. thread!<br /><br />I&#039;ve now got 240 empty caps, cost me $9.99 and when you&#039;re a little high, you don&#039;t realise how many you&#039;re emptied til you can&#039;t see your feet and the dustbuster is full! Give &#039;em a tap and a blow... minimal residue!<br /><br />I used to go to the pharmacy, but I&#039;m a dude of principle! Why does it cost 12odd bucks for 100 caps, when 24 caps AND a whack of paracetamol costs less than $0.50 a cap?!<br /><br />However, if you&#039;re a little lazier than me, any pharmacy or health foor shop!
