				Hey SRs,<br /><br />As the title reads, I want to try LSD for a while. I&#039;ve been a stoner for about half a year now, but it was never the effect I expected weed to be. Newbness was the blame for having the wrong kind of expectations.<br />Nowadays I enjoy a nice bowl of pot to relax when hanging out with friends.<br /><br />Anyways, as for the psychosis part. I&#039;m a heavy ritalin user for about 10 years now. It&#039;s all precribed and legal, I have it to help concentrate. If I don&#039;t take it I&#039;m not an ADHDer who can&#039;t sit still. I don&#039;t use or need it in the weekends, unless I have to study. Vacations are always stone cold turkey, so I&#039;m not dependent in any way. (I take 5 pills every day I use). Diagnosed PDD-NOS, but very social active, happy and certainly not depressed, or have ever been. Sure there were some rough patches (mom got cancer, but survived, not a lot of friends in elementary school) but I could always carry on, they never got to me. I feel great about that.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that a bad trip on acid can mess your mind up for the rest of your life. Psychosis, going insane, all that bad stuff. Life&#039;s been treating my good finally (been bullied, was pretty shy until 4 years ago) , don&#039;t want to ruin it all.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to do LSD asap. I&#039;m new to SR, I&#039;ll order some weed first and try it all out. <br /><br />As for the setting, it&#039;ll probably be somewhere next spring, I will either take my best friend (stoner too) as a trip sitter (I don&#039;t expect him wanting to use LSD too) or go alone if he&#039;s a pussy or doesn&#039;t have the time.<br />Our family has a cabin in the woods, it&#039;s secluded from civilization (the cabin is innawoods, and the innawoods are innafarmland). It&#039;s very nice when the weather is good. We&#039;ll stay a few days at the cabin, don&#039;t want to rush the trip etc. Front porch, gas range, beds, swingset, nice loungechairs, water (hand pump from a well btw) and a toilet. No electricity but I&#039;m planning to bring my iPod classic +iPhone. Any tips for having a great trip utilizing these gadgets? <br />Want to go during spring because I don&#039;t want to freeze my ass off while tripping on the front porch or in the cabin. And I don&#039;t want to try it while being near other people who can cause problems.<br /><br />Motivation why I want to try it?<br />Been listening to The Doors for quite a few years now and I want to see what all the fuzz is all about. Also the movie &#039;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#039; has sparked my interest, but also my &#039;fear&#039; of tripping while being in public. Just general curiosity about the hallucinations for the most part.<br /><br />Sorry for the long thread but I want this to go smooth, or not if I shouldn&#039;t.

				You read about psychedelics exacerbating underlying schizoaffective disorders. If you were worried about psychosis, you wouldn&#039;t be a &quot;heavy ritalin user.&quot;<br /><br />Bad trips are entirely mental. You need only make it through the duration of the drug. Benzos (lorazepam especially) help if you are totally out of control.<br /><br />Also, in case you were wondering, LSD does not stay in your spine or anything silly like that.

				if i could do it all over again I&#039;d start with shrooms before LSD...LSD just throws visuals at you morphing in a psychedelic wormhole at the speed of light...<br /><br />shrooms are somewhat gentler...more like a nice slow horse ride or walk that shows you things....unlike LSD which i more like a crazy ride in really fast car that kinda throws things in your face...<br /><br />i also hear that 2C-B is quite mellow on the scale of psychedelics...

				Pick either LSD or SHROOMS, find an intelligent friend, nd then just go for it in the name of science.! Take a strong dose and you will not be dissapointed. First time... get 2 buddies, trip balls for awhile, then walk around in nature, then hit the movie theatre as it wears off...&nbsp; no psychosis involved. Be sure to have a friend so you can use eachother as reality checks...

				If I could start from scratch I would start with 2c-i, it&#039;s a powerful, but gentle psychedelic and the trip gets better every time which will help you stay in control with other psychedelics. Then of course LSD and shrooms after that followed by whatever your heart desires, they&#039;re like pokemon, you gotta try them all&nbsp; :D

Salvia is a very atypical psychedelic and it&#039;s often dysphoric (terrifying). It put me off traditional psychs for much too long for my well-being.<br /><br />I did 2C-E as my first traditional psych and I was very satisfied. I felt like I had the flu, but when I went for a walk I felt better and I spent some time near a pond listening to nature. It was great, and I spent a lot of time thinking about my future.<br /><br />I would recommend shrooms for a first timer though, like Naughty Dog said earlier. My first time with shrooms was doing a sample bar of USAShroomz&#039;s P. Cubensis special chocolate bars... delightful. :) I would recommend doing the same - the chocolate seems to help reduce the nausea, and it&#039;s delicious.

				Man do not listen to the chatter, for your first handful of trips you do what is tried and true, what time and history has proved to us..DROP LSD OR MUSHYS. Any other phycadelic imho is for experietrip a holics. Like I said two hits of good clean L, in a comfortable safe place. You will have NO regrets=)

				My first psychedelic experience was DMT... best thing i&#039;ve ever done. You are blasted out of your body and literally into another realm of exsistence... only lasts for 15 minutes and can be life changing... my last trip i though i&#039;d died (no really)...<br /><br />AFAIK its the safest psychedelic there is and by far the best in terms of what you experience.<br /><br />Try it out!

				I will second the post cautioning against salvia - tried it a couple of times when it was still legal and had terrible experiences...<br /><br />I think you&#039;re on the right track by focusing on whether your mind is ready for the trip; if shrooming or dropping was only about the physical effects I don&#039;t think they would have near the cachet among those who swear by them (although the visuals and physical giddiness are my favorite parts).&nbsp; Keeping yourself in a good state of mind throughout the trip is the best advice anyone can give you and having a sitter will help immensely.<br /><br />I would also start with a smaller dosage - DO NOT LISTEN to those who tell you to start strong with multiple tabs or 3+ grams.&nbsp; Especially if you have a couple of days, start with a smaller dosage (maybe half a tab) and then increase as necessary.&nbsp; You can always take more but can never do less.&nbsp; At the same time, remember that psychedelic tolerance comes on faster than for Ritalin or opioids, and if you try to trip 2-3 days in a row you will most likely feel nothing by the end.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There are a lot of guides online accessible through both TOR and clearnet - don&#039;t hesitate to read and read and then read some more as well as crowd-source feedback from the forum and IRL friends who might be experienced.<br /><br />Again, sounds like you&#039;re on the right track to be ready for the experience when the time comes, just keep doing your research.

				Not to knock you there &#039;TheDude&#039;, you sound quite insightful ..only i never would suggest any one drop a half a tab, unless it was my mother or somthing lol. the idea is for the firs time user to be thrown right into ego death with in an hour, for once that occurs..ther will be no more feelings or thoughts of you or I, for the user to say or think &quot;i dont feel good&quot; or &quot;this might be too much&quot;. then once your done, you decide whether or not it is for you. Ive yet to drop L with a first timer that didn&#039;t agree that it was absolutely blissful wonder. just my thoughts.

				Biscuitzzz - appreciate the insight there, I guess I can see two camps: diving straight into the depths (as suggested above) or easing in.&nbsp; It is probably a matter of personal preference.&nbsp; I enjoy a variety of substances but could never handle my psychedelics like I can the other drugs I take, which is to say that I have much more fun in the &#039;shallow end&#039; of tripping.&nbsp; This is absolutely not to knock those who can handle it, I&#039;ve just found that I&#039;m not that type of guy and if you too are like me it might be best to find that out at a smaller dosage.&nbsp; If you believe you&#039;re ready for that total disengagement, go for it, you&#039;ll have a great time.<br /><br />

				Saying &#039;dive right in&#039; to psychedelics is an irresponsible suggestion. This is exactly how people can end up fucking themselves up. Ive seen this modality used far to often by friends, and many times the results have been heartbreaking too see (not just with psych&#039;s). But I don&#039;t say this in fear. If you feel that dropping a big dose is right for you then awesome, flow with your intuition man.<br /><br />Id suggest taking a small dose and roll from there, see how it feels. Whether you take two hits for your first time or your forth, chances are it will make little to no difference.<br /><br />Enjoy
