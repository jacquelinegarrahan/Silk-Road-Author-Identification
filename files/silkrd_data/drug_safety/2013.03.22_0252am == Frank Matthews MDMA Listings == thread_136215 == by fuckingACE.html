				Apologies for the double posting, I don&#039;t know what section fits this best and I think its pretty serious.<br />Ive just had a BIG issue with Franks MDMA and hes not replying to messages. <br /><br />Bought 100g of what was supposedly high quality MDMA to resell out at a festival, What has arrived so far is 75g of&nbsp; a brown semi-crystalline powder, only one bag has been opened, I sold 20g´s.&nbsp; Of those 3 people were sick throwing up the whole night and the rest said it had little / no effect. Had to refund almost everyone... Ive found out from other people that were willing to risk it that&nbsp; they´re having to do upwards of 1/2g to even get remotely high.&nbsp; &nbsp;it has a sweet kind of taste, very strange. <br /><br />Franks´s not answering my messages, but It really looks to be a bad batch of MDMA, if that and could be potentially dangerous. I don´t know if the sick people were maybe made ill because they were allergic to something used to cut the substance...<br /><br />I´ve ordered small orders of frank loads of times with no problems, but now hes not answering my messages.and with the new FE policy I obligingly FE´d....&nbsp; Please be aware with his new&nbsp; MDMA listings. <br /><br />I am willing to send out samples to people that are able to test <br />ACE<br />

				You can probably do a quick acetone or MEK wash to clean the product, though you will lose some.. I have a reagent kit that I wouldn&#039;t mind testing the stuff with. PM me let me know.

				I think its possible that more and more vendors will jump ship. And scam their way out. <br />The btc is insane at the moment. Money is worth 5 times more than 2 months ago. vendors who had a lot of savings in btc got rich.<br />Would you keep on vending if you had a shitload of coins and all you had to do to make a living was watch btc price and sell/buy it? <br />I wouldn&#039;t. Why risk doing illegal activities if you are already loaded? <br /><br />Everyone be careful.

				Always reagent test your products. I jut recently received two suspect orders from two different vendors. I am currently waiting on a new test kit to 100$ rule out any error. If I was sold something other than MDMA. I will be very pissed.It sucks but most of the &quot;MDMA&quot; or &quot;molly&quot; being sold nowadays is a research chemical.Testing kit are pretty inexpensive around 30$
