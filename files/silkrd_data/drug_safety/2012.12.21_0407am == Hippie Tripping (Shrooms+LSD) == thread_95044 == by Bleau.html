				I have dropped acid a total of three times, and taken mushrooms about 5 times.<br />I have had a spiritual experience with both, and I understand how to control my trip.<br />My friend and I will likely meditate right before the acid hits and when the acid is getting to it&#039;s peak we will eat all of the mushrooms.<br />After the mushrooms are eaten, we&#039;ll drink orange juice (breaks down the psilocybin to trip harder) , and meditate about 25 minutes in.<br />With proper timing we will open our eyes to both of the visuals hitting us.<br /><br />I have not mixed these two together, so my questions are:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. What should I look forward to experiencing?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. What are the visuals like?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. What should I do besides listening to music and walking around on Christmas day?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. What are your experiences with doing both?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. What other helpful advise do you have for me?<br /><br />Thanks :)<br />Bleau

				Out of you post, the only part that actually drew my attention was this<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I understand how to control my trip</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and to that I say: If you are trying to control your trip, you are doing it wrong. Let Lucy drive! I mean, you bought the ticket to her show, so why try to control it? <br /><br />but honestly, I have never mixed acid and shrooms, so I don&#039;t have any specifics about it. LSD and MDMA, sure...Shrooms and MDMA, yeah. 4-aco-dmt and methylone and nitrous, hell yes, but LSD and shrooms seems like an odd combo to me. For me there is too much overlap in their effects to really shine.

				Wretched is correct in saying that the effects overlap a bit. <br /><br />I&#039;ve used the particular combo twice and both times it seems like the trippy LSD headspace takes over while the shrooms are overpowered and mostly just provide a giggly earthy tone to the whole trip. It&#039;s certainly an enjoyable experience, it just seems a bit wasteful. IMO you&#039;d have a better time with MDMA + LSD/Shrooms. MDMA, even in small doses provides a much more euphoric glow to trips.

				I will be tripping on New Years Eve, and will post results.<br />&quot;I know how to control my trip&quot; is only due to months of meditation when on L or mushrooms, and when I say this I mean having a spiritual experience on either is easy for me.<br />I guess learning to let go and letting Lucy live will help.<br />I&#039;m only iffy about this combo because of the very distinct thought processes I&#039;ve experienced while on both.<br /><br />To me: mushrooms tend to try and make me understand the world, my life, and why I am actually here on this planet, while acid is more of a theorize about how I could tend to make my life and those around me better.<br /><br />I may be a weirdo in this sense, but I am looking forward to sharing the experience with SR forums. Maybe someone will read it and it will strike a tone with them.<br /><br />Thanks :)<br />Bleau

				Yes, please share. Any experience is useful. Maybe I&#039;ll try that combo some day.

				I only ever did this once and it left me disabled in my confusion. It was also the only time I ever heard voices talking to me clear as day. I construed the voice as god and sounded like the adult voices in Charlie Brown, but much deeper and bassier.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend it really. The debilitating confusion kept me from adequately enjoying the trip. Then again it was the first and only time I&#039;ve done it.
