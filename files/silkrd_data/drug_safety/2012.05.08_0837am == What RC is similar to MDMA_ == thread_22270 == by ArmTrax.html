				How about Methylone?<br /><br />I see there are many options for that, the chemistry is almost the same, and the duration of the experience is similar, from what I can tell.

				Methylone for sure, I honestly can&#039;t see much of a difference between Methylone and MDMA but I&#039;m sure people will disagree with me. Great drug for socializing, clubbing, dancing and sex. 200-300mg is a nice dose.

				I usually take only ~150mg of mdma for a good roll, and wouldn&#039;t feel that much of methylone. Methylone gives me nasty comedown and almost no high lately anyway..

				Yeah as long as he doesn&#039;t reagent test it. I gave MDMA to a group one night and then Methylone another night saying it was MDMA and I even asked them if they thought the Methylone batch was better or worse, they said it was about the same..

				Iv tried a couple<br /><br />MDAI- weak and more of a background buzz, not much to it<br />Methylone- Pretty close but just doesnt have the hugs and love as mdma<br />4-MEC - Being sold as mdma randomly, can be very mdma like to a degree but with no energy, and no love, like you wanted to hog it all.

				None of the RCs really have the magic of MDMA.<br /><br />Regarding methylone, it&#039;s very obvious to me that it&#039;s not MDMA. I notice a significant lack of empathy and closeness. It&#039;s slightly more stimulating and lasts a bit longer, but it&#039;s just a disappointment compared to MDMA. The only times I&#039;ve liked methylone was when I took it knowing it was methylone. When I expected to have MDMA I was very let down.

				The euphoria from 2c-b rivals or even surpasses MDMA for me. It&#039;s psychedelic for sure, but it is much more of a roll than a trip to me.

				I&#039;d like to chime in on methylone. The urge to redose is on par with cocaine in my opinion. I got a gram of it yesterday, and as of 8 hours ago, it&#039;s all gone. Not to mention it isn&#039;t as great as MDMA. I would much prefer the latter.

				i would NEVER sell rc&#039;s as mdma. thats why the scene here in the usa is so fucked up as it is. but by all means when somebody fucks me over im going to get him back. and i gave him the methylone instead of nothing because he will be coming back so i can make more $! cha ching! more real drugs for me!&nbsp; ;D but seriously dont sell rc&#039;s as mdma. i would be pissed if somebody did that to me. good thing i dont have any bad karma coming my way.
