				hi everyone, there are a bunch of different hash varieties and stuff out there, and i wouldnt know where to start as far as googling for a way to make it (with the stuff i have available) so I was hoping you guys could help me out. <br /><br />ok so basically, i have a bunch of reggie and also keif, I was wondering how to make hash out of these. not both at the same time, but 2 different hashes. I dont have access to much equipment, i have a pollen press (a small one) but i dont want keif tablets, i want real hash. i heard someone talking about making hash with weed in everclear? or something? idk, i guess im just asking if someone could either explain how to do it or point me in the direction of a good guide! <br /><br />thankyou!!<br /><br />

				Hi Flo!<br /><br />I would steer away from the everclear route if I were you. Apart from being dangerous when evaporating, everclear will dissolve the chlorophyll (the green coloured stuff) from your grass too. This equals shitty tasting hash, a harsh smoke, and often a nasty feeling stomach,<br /><br />I would invest in some bubble hash bags. The stuff they make is great, and they work really well with kief. Just google it. They work by using iced water to knock the trichomes off the weed, which then fall through graduations of micron filters. When you dry it out, you can hen press it.<br /><br />You should be able to pick up a decent set of bags for about $40. Good luck!

				Hey Flo.<br /><br />If you use solvents like alcohol, you wont get hashish.&nbsp; You will get hash OIL.&nbsp; Oil is produced when a solvent dissolves all the good stuff.&nbsp; The solvent is then mostly evaporated (be aware you will still have some solvent in there.&nbsp; If you want to make oil, research butane extraction.&nbsp; Butane can be evapourated off with boiling water instead of a stovetop.&nbsp; ISO-PROPYLALCOHOL produces better quality oil, but is extremely DANGEROUS, alot of people blow themselves up, or suffer from inhaling the fumes.&nbsp; Do not try IPA without someone who has alot of expiriance in these extractions.<br /><br />There are several different ways of making hash.&nbsp; Even keif is considered a type of hash, similar to Morrocan hash, especially when pressed.&nbsp; This is usually produced by gently &quot;sivving&quot; off the cannabis trichomes through a fine screen, often silk or metal gause, and collecting the residue that falls through.&nbsp; This is my personal preferance. I&#039;d kill for some stickly blonde keif tablets.<br /><br />The way personaluse is talking about is called water hash, ice hash or bubble hash (although bubble hash my refer to different hashes.&nbsp; Its very common.&nbsp; Very easy. Very safe.&nbsp; Very recommened.&nbsp; Lots of information out there.&nbsp; Basicly you mix weed, ice and water in a container.&nbsp; You cause a lot of agitiation to the mix.&nbsp; Brittle, frozen trichrome snap off.&nbsp; Plant matter is light and rises, trichome are dense and sink.&nbsp; The mix is poured through a set of filter bags.&nbsp; First bag filters off plant matter, other bags collect different grades of hashish.&nbsp; Hash is dried and pressed.<br /><br />Another way is finger hash, or &#039;Charas&#039;.&nbsp; This is a popular method in India.&nbsp; Finger hash is made by rubbing hands, or body over sticky weed, often still on the plant.&nbsp; The trichome stick to the hands and can be scraped off.&nbsp; Gloves also work well, they can be frozen to make it easier to collect hash.
