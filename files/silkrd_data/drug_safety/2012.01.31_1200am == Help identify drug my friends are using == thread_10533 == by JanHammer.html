				So my friends get this white powder that they simply call &#039;crystals&#039; (not actual crystals). They pay $40 for 1g (second-sourced thus likely overpriced). Neither the dealers nor my friends know what it is... so I&#039;m a little worried for their health.<br /><br />What I know:<br /><br />They use up to 1g a night per person<br />The said white powder is snored<br />They also drink alcohol when using it<br /><br /><br />Seen effects:<br /><br />increased talkiness<br />increased motion but not by much<br />friendliness<br />they become thirsty<br />they are able to control themselves when needed (try and act normal)<br />the next morning they feel fine<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s all I know.<br />What could it be?<br />

				I really have no idea. My best guesses would be:<br />Methylone<br />Mephedrone<br /><br />Reason I guess RC is that is way too cheap to be any of the big name illegal ones.

				4-MEC or similar. A lot of head shops where I am are selling it as &#039;legal coke&#039; and cutting it with benzocaine and caffeine.

				Your friends are idiots, and their dealers are horribly irresponsible. One does not simply snort huge amounts of an unknown substance.<br /><br />Whatever it is, I hope it isn&#039;t too dangerous. Someone (And I&#039;m not implying it&#039;s you) should knock some sense into them...

				If one of ya&#039;ll can get a MDMA testing kit with the 4-reagent system, you could likely verify what the substance is. Mephedrone is actually among the substances tested for by DanceSafe.org&#039;s kit. I bought the kit, but haven&#039;t actually tested it, yet.

At least they&#039;re being honest with me. So many other instances they cut their product with potentially hazardous substances, but at least that guy was being 100% honest that he didn&#039;t know what it was. I&#039;d disagree that their word is proof, but I think that&#039;s just getting into semantics; you and I are using the word &#039;proof&#039; differently. Nowadays I typically only &#039;prove&#039; what my substances are through the use of chemical reagents; even then you can&#039;t be 100% sure, but it makes me a lot more comfortable.
