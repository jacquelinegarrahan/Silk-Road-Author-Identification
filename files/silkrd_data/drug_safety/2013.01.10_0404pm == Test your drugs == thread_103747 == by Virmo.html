			<dd class="postbody">
				I have noticed, and experienced, that some vendors ship shit. <br />Mdma supposedly 83/84% pure. Well, usually it&#039;s not.<br />Xtc which is not xtc.<br /><br />Sending stuff to professional labs cost you your drugs and extra money. I&#039;m not sure how that is in other countries, but out here you can have most drugs tested. Quick result: is coke really coke? Slow result: what is in it exactly, how pure is it?<br /><br />I recommend using at least EZ marquis tests yourself. You just scrape a bit off a pill, or whatever substance, add a drop and see what color it becomes.<br /><br />Now I am wondering if everyone has access to these tests? Otherwise we&#039;d be willing to buy and resell them.<br /><br />Choices are:<br />- For Ecstasy, Amphetamines, 2C-B and others<br /><br />EZ Test Marquis was the first test for Ecstasy ever to come onto the market and should still serve as your primary test kit. As a rule of thumb that you should use when testing for the presence of ecstasy (MDMA, MDA, MDE): if it doesn’t turn black, throw it back!<br /><br />Besides being able to test for Ecstasy, EZ Test Marquis will show different colors for (meth) Amphetamines, 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-I, DOB, DOI, DXM, Methylone, Butylone, Naphyrone, Opiates and many other substances.&nbsp; This test will NOT show a color change when in contact with mCPP and other piperazines and PMA/PMMA. Detailed instructions and a color chart&nbsp; are included in the package.<br />-------------<br />for Ketamine, Amphetamines, PMA / PMMA and Ecstasy<br /><br />EZ Test Mandelin is a confirming test for the presence of (meth)amphetamines and ketamine. Besides this, it will show different colors for Ecstasy, 2-AminoIndane (a research chemical), Ritalin and PMA/PMMA. The reagent itself has a golden yellow color. Detailed instructions and a color chart to compare your results with are included in the box.<br />------------<br />for Cocaine and Crack Cocaine<br /><br />EZ Test Scott can be used to test for the presence of cocaine and crack cocaine. Strangely enough, the reagent also shows a reaction when in contact with MDPV and 5-MeO-MiPT, which are structurally totally different from eachother. Weird, huh?<br /><br />We still have to find an explanation for this, but hey, it works! So we included the results in the color chart.<br />-------------<br />for LSD or other Indoles such as DMT<br /><br />EZ Test Ehrlich is a test that can be used to test for the presence of LSD or other Indoles such as DMT, 5-MeO-DMT (a.k.a. Foxy Methoxy), 5-Meo-MiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, Psilocybin, Psilocine, 4-acetoxy-DMT (a sort of synthetic psilocine analogue) and many others…<br /><br />When testing blotter LSD the color will probably not be as vibrant as when using a more concentrated form of sample, like a crystal. Nevertheless, the color will show up!<br />-------------<br />for Opiates, DXM, 2-C-T-xx and Ecstasy<br /><br />EZ Test Mecke is another test that can be used to test for Ecstasy (MDMA, MDA, MDE). It also shows a different color when in contact with Opiates and opioids such as DXM, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Morphine, Heroin and substances for the 2-C-T-xx family (2-C-T-2/4/7/21).<br /><br />Detailed instructions on how to do the test and a color chart are included.<br />------------<br />for mCPP and other PhenylPiperazines<br /><br />Finally there’s a reagent that can detect phenylpiperazines such as mCPP and TfMPP: EZ Test mCPP. <br /><br />The market is flooded market with pills that are made with this stuff. MCPP and other piperazines have nothing to do with Ecstasy, nor do these substances have any of the effects that makes Ecstasy so special.&nbsp; Luckily, with EZ Test mCPP there’s now a possibility to weed these nasty buggers out!<br /><br />Then there are some for purity and cuts:<br />The Cocaine Purity Test enables you to quickly get an idea about the purity of the cocaine. Just add 20 milligram of your sample to this test and you will have a result within seconds.<br /><br /><br />The EZ Test Cocaine Purity test is very insensitive to the usual cuts such as mannitol and such, but will as a bonus, not react to any other substance from the family of cocaine (lidocaine, procaine,etc.), which are frequently used to fool the poor soul who wants to taste it. These other -caines will only produce a numbing effect (at best) and contribute to really bad hangovers!!<br /><br />This test can&#039;t tell you anything about the identity of the substance that may have been used for cutting the sample. For this purpose we recommend further testing with our EZ Test for Cocaine Cuts.<br /><br />Finally there is a test that can detect the presence of levamisole, phenacetine and/or ephedrine in cocaine.&nbsp; <br /><br />By using this easy-to-use, inexpensive test you can be assured that your sample isn&#039;t tainted with these crazy adulterants that can have devastating effects on your health and well-being.<br /><br />However, it doesn&#039;t say how pure your sample is. For this we recommend our test for Cocaine Purity.<br /><br /><br /><br />Like our text sais: we are here to improve the SR community. This includes safe drugs use. Which in turn includes testing your drugs, and knowing what to eat/drink days before and after.<br /><br /><br />

				http://dancesafe.org (US/CA)<br />http://www.ecstasypilltest.com (Worldwide)<br /><br />MUCH cheaper than EZ Test who no longer sell bottles, just the single-use tests.<br /><br />It&#039;s also simple enough to make your own reagents with fairly easily available chems.

				Nah don&#039;t offer people to check if they really get what they ordered. They don&#039;t care.<br /><br />Funny how the big fish do not post in threads like these. I think it is time you take your prices and do them x2 minimally.<br />And do not go over your head or whatever the rule is. If you ever sell that mdma again,, put 50% of it in a seperate bag to keep, and add some crap or poison to ut and make it smell the same. Or grind it up andmake a really fine powder that looks just like it.

				I can&#039;t comprehend how you think this is scam.<br /><br />A vendor sends me 100mg of let&#039;s say amphetamine, which with shipping costs will cost him $5, then it gets tested by the lab, which otherwise would cost him a couple of hundred Euros. Also, he is not sending to India, but to Switzerland, we are not exactly poor here to scam people. Anyways, it&#039;s up to you guys, I am gonna test my next shipment and post the results if the vendors agree to, I think people will have more trust then.

I had a long thought about doing it but decided it wasnt worth it for me.<br />If they ever start testing in my own country i would use the service whenever i ordered from a new vendor or suspect a different batch.<br />Currently there is only one guy from holland who posting testresults here on the forum. This kinda surprises me, there should be plenty of dutch buyers here who have the opportunity...<br /><br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />sam<br /><br />

				The range of home drug testing kits is amazing. Even the EZ test kits, one of hte more well known drug and drug adulterant testing companies has seen sales soar as I guess morte middle aged users wonder if that coke really is &#039; off the boat&#039;. I very much doubt it, and even it was,, its not like South Americans don&#039;t know how to make two kilos of coke into three. <br /><br />The average UK coke user, the weekend users who have been doing coke for years, really are a bit dumb because they are very complacent and quick to call out heroin as ;dirty&#039; when the fact remains that if you were given a choice of becoming a coke addict or heroin addict (free of course!) you would have to choose heroin! I&#039;ve never used heroin but if forced to make the choice its a no brainer, coke is far more dangerous to get addicted to and you can spot a cokehead a mile offf. As for heroin addicts, you would be surprised that many are clean cut, well presented and in better health than their coke snorting buddies who rarely ever bother to test the coke and rarely clean it. 99 out of 100 people would snort coke straight off the block and never dream of cleaning it.<br /><br />Well, the most eye opening test kit for me has been the EZ test for leviamisole, the animal worming drug that also lowers white blood cell count and creates ewuphoria similar to coke or close enough for people to add itr both as a bulking agent and an active cut to make a 40% coke seem like its 60% or higher!. The majority of coke came out as positive for that, in fact, only one sample was free of it but the coke itself was last on the list iof sic cokes bought here and a couple bought elsewhere.<br /><br />I think all coke dealers should pay the small amount for the EZ test kits for coke contaminants. All you need is 2 mg for testing, hardly a lot! But my guess is most would not publish the test results of the coke test for levamismole, phenacetine, ephidrine and EZ test are looking into making more coke contaminant test kits to detect the new RCs that will be making an apperence this year. Its only a matter of time before someone finds some old patent that will eventually lead to a new RC similar to cocaine. There are more &#039;home chemists&#039; who have a little lab and plenty of stoners who work in the big labs. That said, its all CCTV now so itwould be hard to churn out some MDMA or LSD without paying the security guard who is likely a stoner also! I predict that this will be the year of the RC branching out more. Even the Chinese know if they discover some old patent and can replicate coke, they will be making millions before the government passes legislation banning it., Even if its illegal it would be made. A kilo of coke can bring over 100,000 online, in real life, you&#039;d make a lot more but the risk is a lot more also. I&#039;d never sell coke, its just too risky all round. There is no resolution centre in real life - just some teenager with a gun who wants to impress his buddies and the local gangters.<br /><br />Tell a street dealer that his coke is contaminated with levamismole and he will not have a clue what your talking about - he would likely threaten you with serious injury and claim his coke is the purest ever - Pablo Escobars own personal stash! <br /><br />My drug of choice is cannabis and I know were I am 100% with that! Yes you can &#039;cut&#039; cannabis or hash, but people spend good money on hash here because they want pure hash not the commercial gangster hash which might be 5-10% hash in reality! And 90% leaf ground up. We are also seeinf RC cannabanoids mixed into the actual &#039;hash&#039;. The &#039;best&#039; will have cannabis oil as a binder but if your going to cheat then most would go for some other &#039;glue&#039; to bind the leafy hash which would just turn to dust with a touch because you need the resin to actually bind the mass of resin glands and heads,.<br /><br />Weed is contaminated if you buy street weed or imnported Dutch commercial, In the UK some spray the bud with a kind of perfume and we all saw the nasty shit which was full of some glass to replicate resin glands. A simple microscope will reveal if a hash is natural or if its been contaminated. I have bought nothing but good hash here, apart from one which crumbled to dust and looked nothing like thie listing picture! That&nbsp; is the slight hit on my stats - I fot a resend as a refund, the resend was same shit but 50% less! Trader has long since gone. <br /><br />Another thing to test is E. We have had a few nasty incidents of late with people using some RC and binder to create fake E&#039;s. The simple answer is buy crystal, you know were you are and how much the dose is. I would not test offf the vendors I buy E from as they have nothing but good ratings always. Ivory for example, that MDMA was the best experience I had from this site.&nbsp; ;D I&nbsp; might even have some tomorrow as I&#039;ve not used for a while and never abused it back in the day. In fact, my mates envy the fact 100mg gets me flying. I keep a 40mg &#039;top up&#039; with me but have never&nbsp; needed to use that! There are some top MDMA vendors here and MDMA is not that hard to make so people still make it and some obviouslt sell onlline as they don&#039;t want dozens of people callling in for a few minutes. each day!<br /><br />As for the RC blotters, that is another worry - its more whether the blotter has the correct dosage and also there are sveral drugs being oot onto blotters from benzos to some pretty intense stimulants and some powerful hallucinagenics. Time was the only blotters were LSD. <br /><br />Other stuff to test - well any drug sold here basically.<br /><br />I also think some vendors will have tested and found leviamisole. I think that siomething like 80% of coke siezed omne year by the Americans from Mex was contaminated. Anyone buyying a kilo or a few ounces of coke to sell is usually not interested in the health and wellbeing of customers. The average dealer wants you alive for sure! But, in RL, most coke dealers are as dodgy as they come and a small percentage here have also proven to be outright scammers! <br /><br />Here we need traders and a good trader will always test his own produce especiallyt if its a powder! <br /><br />And the EZ test kits are cheap. If you use a lot of coke I&#039;d advise you to test it. I know a few coke users who were shocked to discover they might have ben snorting grams of levamismole per year. That is dangerous for your health and so for me iI&#039;m waiting for some traders to offer coke free of contaminants. <br /><br />The only coke to have no levamismole also had no euphoria. One of the most euphotric cokes I had here was pretty high reading for that contaminant. So, for me its no brainer giving up coke for a few months until we either get lveamismole free or if we get come cleaning method to get rid of it!<br /><br />The actual basic purity test for coke was pretty good, best two were Mex, one off here, another in RL thay came our way.<br /><br />Shame that people are not waking up to how coke has changed. A busdy recovering from cancer was horrified when he reseached things.<br /><br />And,, lets face it, few people in the UK have any idea of what cocainw really should be like and with the addition of levamismole, the euphiria you feel could be some worming powder.<br /><br />Never took photos, but we got enough left of each sample to test. But I think you ought to just assume that most coke here has levamismole added atr the source. Its farmers who grow a patch of coke, andf farmers can buy levamismole for a lot cheaper than a kilo of coke! The farmers rarely make the actual coke, but the gangs&nbsp; and cartels running the gangs have access to tons of various additives and contaminants. Its the massive cartels who have the say on how much should be added. As long as they get o complaints off the people buying then they will carry on as usual. The real worry is europeans and American gettinf access t leamismole. Adding 10%&nbsp; to a pretty average coke mifght make it euphoric. And if people say in the forums and feedback, people will buy. Coke should be euphioric, but now we know other things can make you euphoric you shoudl be testing. In a month or so we could pretty much test every drug.<br /><br />I propose that we start a thread in which people link to photos of the actual test results and the name of the vendor on some paper so we know its an original photo.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />

				Yes we wonder about that as well.<br /><br />Anyways, we can provide test kits and have info on somebody who can bring stuff to labs.<br />Though not for free of course.<br /><br />

				Yes we wonder about that as well. (about the bad karma)<br /><br />Anyways, we can provide test kits and have info on somebody who can bring stuff to labs.<br />Though not for free of course.<br /><br />About dutch weed being contaminated.. Contaminated with what? I know some sellers and they can close their shop if they sell contaminated weed.<br />Or do you mean that they accelerate the growth proces? What is wrong with that? There is also &quot;biological&quot; weed. That&#039;s cheap but you need to smoke a lot more for the same effect. Some prefer that though. Sometimes weed is wet. That way weed weighs more so you get less. We dry it first otherwise it burns less good.<br /><br />We want to ship weed. All sorts are available. Amnezia haze for instance. But we would need advice about how to ship it so customs will not find it before we do that. And at first we would need people to FE which we don&#039;t like, but being a vendor is taking a lot of risk. Or we would ask twice the amount of money for products like big vendors do... Which is probably what the &quot;big fish&quot; do. (the old virmo team had a topic about that and the bad karma was probably because of that since &quot;small fish&quot; were told not to be vendors).<br /><br />We have the same idea about being a vendor as the old team. Which is to ship what we describe in our listings.<br /><br />LSD is way overpriced on SR. And the ug in almost never as described on SR. Here you can buy 100tabs for 1 euro each. And if they say it&#039;s really strong it&#039;s usually really weak. If they say it&#039;s weak it&#039;s really strong. And the cyber hippies who are really into psychedelics and psychedelic music sometimes just give amazing lsd for free, or xtc/E.<br />Cocain/heroin is way overpriced here. It&#039;s cheaper on SR. And it&#039;s always cut with crap. Same for ketamine.<br /><br />Unless you don&#039;t care about your health you should always test your drugs...<br /><br />

				Quick question about the eztests. I know they state that they only test for the presence of the drug not the purity but how significant is the shade of the colour. For instance, the mandelin test shows K as light to very dark orange. What does the shade of orange indicate? If it&#039;s very dark is the drug purer?

				Not 100% sure but I think that how quick or dark the colour becomes tells you nothing.<br />Only way to check purity is by letting a real lab do a test, or if you know somebody who really knows how to test drugs for purity...<br /><br />Such a shame that vendors provide false information.. I wonder how many people get sick or die because of SR...

				I also would like a test that could show how pure a certain substance is.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t read the whole thread cuz I am in a hurry but if there was a cheap test that could show the purity of your drug of choice not just what is in it that would buy mucho beneficial
