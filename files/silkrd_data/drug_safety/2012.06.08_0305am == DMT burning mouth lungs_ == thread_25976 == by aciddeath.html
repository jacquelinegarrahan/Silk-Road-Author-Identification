				I tried DMT tonight I got off a very established seller on the road<br />it&#039;s oily and waxy with a slight yellow tint<br /><br />I used a clean &#039;crack&#039; stem (the kind with the bubble at the end). <br />I could hardly hold the smoke in my lungs, it burned severely... at one point I had to wash my mouth out<br /><br />It&#039;s entirely possible that I pulled DMT into my mouth<br />but.... is DMT normally so severe / burning on the lungs?

				I just tried DMT for the first time a couple of days ago and the smoke was pretty rough (but not as bad as you describe).&nbsp; I used a 2L bottle though because from all of the things I read it was the least harsh.&nbsp; I can imagine using something with a smaller chamber wouldn&#039;t be as pleasant.&nbsp; The only downside to a large chamber is that the smoke has an easier time recrystallizing on the walls.&nbsp; Granted this is just speculation since I&#039;m new at it, but I made sure to do a lot of research before trying it.

				It&#039;s extremely harsh at first but you get used to it quickly. I&#039;ve done it 15 times now, 14 of which from a crack pipe and am already not only used to it but actually have grown to like it. <br /><br />Oddly enough smoking weed still makes me cough up a lung

				I know that the DMT smoke can be god-awful but there is also the possibility that the chemist who actually made the DMT used to much sodium hydroxide in the extraction process and that excess amounts of it came through in the NP solvent. And although I have read anecdotal reports of people smoking an entire bowl of Lye without serious harm to prove that it wasn&#039;t as cuastic when vaporised. I imagine that smoking lye would still be rather harsh.<br /><br />Don&#039;t want to sully your vendors name or anything as this is mere speculation. but it could happen.

				there&#039;s really no need to disclose the vendor&#039;s name atm<br />for some reason I think i might have fucked up the process of smoking it?? burned it?? really hoping against contamination as you describe.... this vendor is 99% at hundreds of feedbacks<br /><br />I always thought DMT was supposed to be crystal/powder but when mine arrived it was more waxy/oily<br />When you put it on a piece of paper and leave it sit, the oil soaks through the paper<br /><br />Now I have got myself wondering if it&#039;s dangerous to even attempt another &#039;slower&#039; smoking session with less lighter heat

				I&#039;ve had DMT that I extracted melt and turn into an oily liquid. If you put into the freezer for a while it should get back to normal.<br /><br />If you were worried about left over lye you could try to recrystallize it with bestine or hot naphtha.<br /><br />Most likely though you just got it too hot. DMT burns fairly easily. If the stuff left in the pipe is brown you burned it. I&#039;ve personally never managed to be able to use a crack pipe without burning it.

				Its common for it to have a yellow and slightly waxing consistency and its melting point is only slightly above room temp. But the oily thing could also signify the use of an unclean solvent. alot of teks on making DMT mention using naptha but the problem is that naptha is a generic term used to descripe any mixture of petroleum distillates that fall between a certain range of boiling points. And there are a lot of dumb people that try using lighter-fluid grade naptha for this. and lighter grade naptha is dirty as shit. the result of using it is a end product that is contaminated with the high boiling temperature petroleum byproducts.<br /><br />&nbsp;Does it smell like lighter fluid?

				I can&#039;t comment on the qualities of your actual DMT, but as mentioned it could have been too hot. I haven&#039;t experienced the level of brutal pain you have, but I&#039;ve noticed the burning is especially pronounced with glass &#039;crack&#039; stems. My lips and mouth experience a burning sensation even if the DMT was burned smoothly. After seeing a decent amount of DMT resin coating the inside of the stem down to the mouthpiece I thought maybe some of the melted DMT had slipped through while inhaling. Using other pipes/bubblers/bongs hasn&#039;t had that effect for me so I&#039;ve stuck with them. I am also making &quot;The Machine&quot; today which I&#039;m very excited about, best of luck to you.

				Be sure to remove exif data from the pictures. I believe details on the method are in the Security forum.<br /><br />Throw the DMT in the freezer and if it is still &#039;oily&#039; you may want to try to re-crystallize as Moon Unit said. The DMT I have had has always been light-yellow or white shards/crystals and when warm they just get a bit sticky. After being in the freezer the shards shake around like tiny pebbles in the bag.

				when you went to your friends house did you have the wrapped up DMT in a pocket or someplace else that would have allowed it to be come warmed up by your body. if so that that&#039;s why it left the oil print behind.<br /><br />I would still consider washing it just to be on the safe side.

NAPTHA<br /><br />So I&#039;m thinking this was extracted using naptha, and some of it was left behind.<br />Going to do some searching see what I can find on washing it so it&#039;s not so brutal

				You could try an ammonia or baking soda wash, but the DMT community seems divided on whether or not it actually helps some people swear by it and others say it&#039;s pointless, or you could get some bestine and try to recrystallize it.

				I am thinking that the creator of this DMT evaporated the naptha instead of crystalizing it to increase their yield. Best bet would be to recrystalize with a quality VM&amp;P Naptha to remove any non-polar solvent impurities<br />( you can get a good tek for that here: https://mycotopia.net/forums/dmt-spice/18501-dmt-recrystallization-tek.html )<br />&nbsp;and then wash it with a water that has been basified with baking soda to remove any excess lye.<br /><br /><br />Best of luck. let me know if you need anything more specific.

				+1 there DrGonzoII, I appreciate the response<br /><br />there is definitely something &quot;wrong&quot; with this DMT<br />I went and got a new, clean, longer stem, deeper bowled &#039;crack pipe&#039; <br />I put 50mg into the pipe and approached it with a lighter from FARRR away to ensure I didn&#039;t burn anything<br /><br />Sure enough I started to vape the &quot;dmt&quot; and nearly hacked up a lung. It tastes like chemicals and burns the throat.<br />Putting some on my tounge tastes kind of chemically too<br /><br />:( seriously bummed about this right now.. especially because I gave some to a friend all excited that I got super pure dmt from a &quot;established&quot; seller here and now have to go break that dream for him

				I&#039;m sorry to hear that. But if it was still super harsh at slow and careful vaporization temps, that is an even bigger sign of it being contaminated with unevaporated solvent. (Keep in mind that pure DMT DOES TASTE LIKE BURNING RUBBER/PLASTIC but it shouldn&#039;t be as caustic as you are describing)<br /><br />let us know how it compares after you Recrystallize and wash it. If there is any noticeable difference in its ease of use (Which i expect there will be), and which leads you to believe that the chemist did a half-ass job, then you should give that Vendor a PM expressing how you feel about the matter. <br /><br />After you have confirmed the purity issue I would also recommend requesting at least a partial refund since although he did deliver the requested product, it is unclean in a dangerous way and is incredibly unsafe to consume. <br /><br />And if the vendor is a dick about it, than talk to the mods.

				The vendor just offered to ship me another package with &#039;better&#039; DMT and also told me that if it was yellow I likely received &quot;the Jungle DMT&quot;. I have asked the vendor to not sell this product/batch to anyone else. I have as well offered to stealthily post the remains of my &quot;jungle spice&quot; back to the vendor&#039;s drop so that he/she can confirm my report.<br /><br />There&#039;s so little left at this point (~half gram) I am not sure if even want to run through the hassle of attempting a purification. This was the original reason I chose to order DMT from the road... I didn&#039;t feel like undertaking the extraction process. Simply smelling the pipes used to smoke it makes me want to hurl. <br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth I was able to bring the DMT to a local DMT head I met through a friend... he burned some on foil and offered a &#039;no go&#039;. He shared with me the tiniest pinch of redish/orange powder... It did taste weird/plastic/crap but it didn&#039;t leave my entire esophagus/throat/mouth/nose/eyes/lungs writhing in pain as I pulled the hit.. though I did find the smoke rougher than cannabis or even hash.<br /><br />This whole thing has me really shook about taking drugs of unknown &quot;quality&quot;.<br /><br />Fuckin A

				I&#039;m glad to here about your successful reimbursement but the &quot;Jungle DMT&quot; thing he told you was an outright lie.<br /><br />Jungle DMT is extracted from Mimosa Hostilis Root Bark with a particular solvent (I Think it was xylene) that also pulls other alkaloids out of the plant which add to the primary effects of DMT. AND JUNGLE DMT IS RED, NOT YELLOW.<br /><br />What your friend gave you sounds more like jungle DMT than the stuff you posted a Pic of.<br /><br />I would highly suggest that you smoke some mullein leaf to get any of that crap from the dmt out of your lungs.<br />Its an expectorant, and it works really well at making the lungs hack up crap that&#039;s stuck in them when its smoked. I have even read of some dudes that inhaled a bunch of smoke from burning rubber/plastic and felt like they had a coating in their lungs and difficulty breathing. One of them tried it at someones recommendation and they hacked all the crap out the next day.

				If you are refering to my comments and assistance, I never said that DMT was smooth. In fact I stated several times that it tastes like burning rubber/plastic, but it should not be so caustic as to burn a persons mouth and lungs unless it is dangerously impure. And further more....if you are the vendor that sold this person the DMT in question, than why do you not post in this thread with your vendor account, instead of some bullshit account that appears to have been made just for this post......<br />Unless you can not actually verify the purity/safety of your DMT or do not have enough faith in your product to stand behind it in light of these accusations.<br /><br />And saying something like &quot;so after reading this guys crying about it being toxic, I had to give it a smoke&quot; implies that you did not even test this shit before sending it out which makes you a bad vendor IMHO (plus, your bad typing skills seems to imply that you do not even grasp the knowledge necessary to ascertain the purity of any substance.....let alone just by smoking it). Not to mention the fact that DMT should not be a &quot;orange gooey chunk&quot; unless it is full of evaporated solvent (or perhaps, was not defatted. Which can be just as bad in some situations).<br /><br />So if you are in fact the vendor in question, you have only driven the point home. And I think that if you were an accountable person you should STAND UP AND DEFEND THESE ARGUMENTS WITH YOUR REAL ACCOUNT. and you should send some this shit off for a GS/MS and post the results to prove your products purity. (Someone even recently offered these very services on the forum.)<br /><br />If these things are denied and others are found to agree with my logic, Than I must urge the OP to reveal this vendors identity for the sake of safety.

				after a little research based on the name of that person I have concluded that it was either the vendor named elvis (who happens to have quite a few DMT listings) or possibly a user named moonunit (which could possibly be elvis&#039;s buyer account). ......OR....It could have been another rival vendor&nbsp; or even a random user trying to stir up some shit.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s my hypothesis (for now) and I&#039;m sticking to it

				THAT IS FALSE. And you obviously don&#039;t have enough faith in what you say to say it with your real account.<br /><br />Jungle DMT is a Mimosa Hostilis Root Bark based DMT extract that contains certain unidentified alkaloids that are not normally extracted unless one uses xylene as the Non-Polar solvent.<br /><br />And the Jungle Spice alkaloid is RED.....not orange. Although it is possible for a DMT extract of sufficient purity to be orange due to SLOPPY LAB PROCEDURES. This is highly indicative of other impurities and should not be trusted.<br /><br />So why don&#039;t you STFU about things that you obviously don&#039;t know (I know that people like Marsofold make it seem like any retard can extract DMT with a picture-book recipe and a trip to home depot but that doesn&#039;t mean that RETARDS should actually be attempting it) ........... and Stop trolling this thread with shill accounts.

				I&#039;ve only tried DMT a few times, planning on trying Dimitri&#039;s Changa next because I&#039;ve had less than stellar experiences with powder form. I didn&#039;t read the whole thread but did you pull the DMT out of the mailbox and it was melted? Could have easily been 100*F+ depending on the temps where you live.<br /><br />Taste wise, it tastes like I&#039;m inhaling burning plastic and it is very harsh for me. I&#039;m a regular marijuana smoker but I don&#039;t smoke cigs, poor quality weed or really dense weed that fertilizers were used with often make me cough up a lung. Smoking DMT is just as harsh to me, and I&#039;ve coughed out a precious hit before but the last time I tried it I took several smaller hits to prevent it from happening again.<br /><br />I still have yet to have a real breakthrough though, I had an almost mini-lucid dream once, sort of like when you pass out and wake up and you had like a 10 second dream but you were only out for a second or 2. Nothing exciting or mind blowing. The last 2 times I&#039;ve tried it I didn&#039;t have anything other than a &#039;coming up&#039; feeling and then it subsided without any breakthrough, visuals, nothing.

				From what I&#039;ve seen in the past Elvis and Moon Unit are both DMT vendors and both tend to delete their previous posts or create new accounts.<br /><br />The DMT I received from Elvis in the past was a very white, maybe slightly yellow, crystal. Based on that I can&#039;t judge for certain what he claims to be &quot;Jungle Spice&quot; but I would agree based on the described characteristics that it is not true Jungle Spice. I also believe it is some of the smoothest smoke I&#039;ve had when slowly heated. But again, I had purchased and received mostly-white DMT.<br /><br />@Meister Changa is muuuuch easier to dose. With both make sure you hold in your hits for 15 seconds (very important), and when you think you have had enough take one more rip :)

				Either way, one of them is taking advantage of this thread to discredit the other and create general distrust. All of which is most unbecoming and I would recommend that people stay away from such unscrupulous vendors as a general principal (If either one was truly legit, than their products would speak for themselves and they wouldn&#039;t need to resort to such childish tactics)<br />If vendors wanna bash each other than go ahead. But don&#039;t troll a thread where people are trying to offer legitimate harm reduction advice to the end user of your products. I for one have never used either of them, BTW. But will I certainly stay away from both from now on, due to these infantile shenanigans.<br /><br />I recommend that Both of these dudes GROW UP and SHOW SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. If even one of your customers reports concerns about the purity of your products than you should do the responsible thing and send some out for GS/MS.

				((UPDATE: I posted here incorrectly that I had gotten a wrong order from one of SR&#039;s DMT vendors. I did not; there was simply some confusion about the packaging. I&#039;m leaving the question below because of the replies to it, but redacting the rest of my message.))<br /><br />From the picture shown I don&#039;t think this is the same thing.&nbsp; But it did get me wondering: if someone did vaporize pharmayahuasca, believing it to be freebase, would the harmine etc. cause the same sort of burning sensations described here?&nbsp; Or would it be totally different?

				Smoking Freebase Harmala alkaloids shouldn&#039;t cause the burning or anything like that unless it is impure (with solvents) or if you inhale some of it while smoking (like others have asked the OP about this DMT). At worst you might get some nausea if you smoke to much.<br />Some people like to smoke Freebase harmala alkaloids to intesify other drugs. And it can also Be a very potent psychedelic in its own right (almost as strong as DMT if you smoke enough.....But the effects tend to feel slower/smoother). But be careful as it is roughly 10x more potent by weight when using this ROA.<br /><br />And It should be relatively smooth on the lungs and taste kind of earthy (like if you took the flowery flavor out of raw opium). Kind of hard to describe....But its not really harsh by any means and a lot of people have been found to enjoy it.<br />But please note that the rules of ingesting a MAOI still apply to smoking it. I mixed some weed with a harmala extract once to make my stash last longer (which worked really well) and One time I smoked it and forgot to take into account that I had eaten a whole bag of cheesy popcorn (which was loaded with tyramine)&nbsp; a few hours previously.<br /><br />BIG NO NO.......Hello Hypertension.....WORST WEEK EVER. <br /><br />Since I did not have access to a physician, I Managed to finally get rid of the lingering effects on my blood pressure and nervous system with a strict week-long regimen of Hawthorne Root Extract (from a dietary store). and a very plain diet of salted rice and water.<br /><br />Lesson Learned: Don&#039;t underestimate the importance of a proper diet before consuming Any MAOI via any ROA

				I think i may be able to shed a little light here.<br /><br />I have done (in the past) many extractions of MHRB using the straight to base method and the colouring of the DMT is what I used to get when, after pulling the naptha of the top after extraction there would always (without fail) be a little of the NaOH/MHRB mix with it. When the naptha was evaporated it left miscoloured crystals, if I was really sloppy they got more and more waxy/oily. In any case I never smoked the 1st extraction, if you recrystalise with heptane it comes out white as a sheet. Even a wash with heptane or similar will pull most of that out and make it smokable. <br />DMT is no fun to smoke (though I do love the smell) - one time I inhaled the vapour bvefore it cooled and burned my throat which then swelled up and I spent the whole trip gasping for breath and drinking water (though it seemed more like jellied gemotrical creatures than water :p) - it was&#039;t sore as such but very unpleasant and afterwards it hurt like a bitch.<br />I would definately recrystalise it! even if you only get 200mg back thats 6 good visits to the other side of the veil.<br />I would stay away from this vendor in the future to be honest, if they are shipping it in this kind of state (unless its very cheap in which case you can purify it yourself).

				I know what you mean dude... The stuffs real harsh and I have the same problem. Using a 2 liter vape seems to work a lot better than an oil burner though, which I can NOT use, just can&#039;t take in enough. Of course you could also make a drink with a MAOI if you want to go through the trouble.

They don&#039;t SELL dmt or MAKE dmt. And they certainly won&#039;t SELL ME any. They gave me a pinch to try what it tasted like. The only reason I came to SR (as mentioned in previous post on this thread) is because I didn&#039;t want to undertake the entire extraction hassle by myself.<br /><br />The vendor sent me another package. <br />It smells, looks and smokes just the same as the original package (slightly less yellow, slightly less harsh when vaped)<br /><br />I really appreciate this vendor&#039;s sincerest efforts in trying to get to me the &#039;real&#039; DMT experience. (EDIT: I did NOT tell you come to the board to see my &#039;rave review&#039; I told you I would WRITE a rave review all over the forum when I blasted off from the &#039;super pure white dmt&#039;.

You came to thread and posted yourself. I was not going to reveal this information out of respect for what you did for me (resending &#039;more pure&#039; product).<br /><br />I&#039;m going to upload a picture of the first (yellow) dmt next to the second (less yellow) dmt I got, as well as the picture that is listed on the item&#039;s page.<br /><br />I also think I need some heptane to attempt a recrystallization on the new material I have just so I can report back to this thread which seems to have garnered wayyyy more attention that I intended it to =X<br /><br />
