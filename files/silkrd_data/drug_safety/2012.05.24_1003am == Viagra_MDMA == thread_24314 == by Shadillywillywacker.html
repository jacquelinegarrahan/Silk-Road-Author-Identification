				I am just wondering if there is any major saftey issue with the combination.&nbsp; I plan on taking 1-1.5 of the yellow triforce and was thinking 50mg of viagra.&nbsp; 50mg of viagra was always the right dose for me b4 but was wondering if anyone had done the combo and how it worked out for them.

				Dude this is crazy because literally tonight I am taking 1 yellow triforce and 50mg viagra.<br /><br />For anyone wondering.. its cause my dick shrinks on mdma. Never had any problems getting it up in life, but for some reason on md my dick fucking retreats, which is a shame because I love fucking and I love mdma.. so naturally I want to combine the two. Hopefully the viagra will sort it out

				You two should save yourselves the trouble and just do some speed&nbsp; ;). You&#039;ll be fucking like no tomorrow. I&#039;ve never tried sex + MDMA, its always taken away my sex drive not increased it.

				This happens with almost everyone. It&#039;s the effect MDMA has on the body, something to do with blood being diverted to major organs instead of extremities. It&#039;s why some people feel hot but get cold fingers/toes. Does Viagra work like it should with MDMA then? I&#039;m assuming it does, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t take it.

				Combining viagra and MDMA can be dangerous to the heart, so be careful if you decide to do it anyway.

				I always take Viagra when rolling. Usually 125MGs MDMA with 100MGs Viagra. I am sure its not great for your heart but it makes sex amazing. If you haven&#039;t tried sex on 2C-B yet I would highly recomend you do so. I think sex on 2C-B is better than MDMA, plus, you won&#039;t need Viagra (never hurts though).

				The only time my willy has ever become a recluse was when I dropped MDMA with my sister, of course I had no problem with that. ;) It would have been rather awkward if it were the opposite.

If that stuff were dangerous, especially at relatively low doses, wouldn&#039;t you expect to hear about it? Oh that&#039;s right you only ever hear legitimate medical doctors saying you need to be concerned if you have preexisting conditions. <br /><br />Also, the only real concern with the ecstasy would be not knowing exactly what&#039;s in it but as long as you get legit MDMA my understanding is that it has been proven to be fairly benign in typical doses to a healthy person as well.
