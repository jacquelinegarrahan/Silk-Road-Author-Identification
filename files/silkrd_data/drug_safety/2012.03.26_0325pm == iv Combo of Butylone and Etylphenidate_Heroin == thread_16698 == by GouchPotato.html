				Hi all, this is my first post so greetings and salutations to everybody here :)<br /><br />&nbsp;I have some Butylone and also Ethylphenidate on order right now. Sounds like they both iv well in the right dosages. I&#039;m considering trying them in combination, once I have an idea about personal dosage levels for the individual RCs. Has anyone tried this? Also, has anyone ever tried a pseudo-speedball involving H and either of these RCs?&nbsp; I used to do a lot of crack/h straight coke/h&nbsp; true speedballs &#039;back in the day&#039; so am aware of the risks and downside of such things but really just curious. I love my H although I never let myself go more than a day or two on it without 5 or 6 days off as I can&#039;t afford to be a full-on junkie for so many reasons.<br /><br />So I wonder whether those RCs with a bit of smack and a lot of care.. might give a good time with the longer-acting H taking the edge off of the jitters at the edges of the RC effects??&nbsp; &nbsp;Or have I got this really wrong and there is some reason to seriously not combine these RCs with H?&nbsp; &nbsp;Any opinions and advice would be most gratefully received. <br /><br />GP

				That doesn&#039;t sound like a very good idea to me. Not because there&#039;s any reason to suspect an interaction will occur, but because we have no idea about the combination. If you were going to do that, I would recommend that you start at extremely small dosages and work your way up to what you think would be an appropriate dosage. You really don&#039;t have any idea of how any two substances will work in combination in your body.

				This sounds like a pretty bad idea to me mate. Think about it logically, combining smack and coke is dangerous as in an IV so combining it with Ethylphenidate which has a similar profile doesn&#039;t sound like the best way forward. On top of that adding bk-MBDB to it just sounds like adding issues to a bad idea anyway. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have any experience with Heroin personally so I&#039;m just going on personal logic but I have spinned the other two and to be honest they are both a bit shit anyway so I wouldn&#039;t combine them on there own let alone with Heroin. <br /><br />Good luck whatever you decide. Be safe.

				Obviously risky to IV anything, let alone RCs - however - I have happily IV&#039;d Ethylphenidate multiple times and can say that it gives a fantastic rush/euphoria followed by a strong stimulation for a few hours. The urge to keep on repeating the injections is very strong so you need a lot of self-control to not end up looking like a pin-cushion. It&#039;s a vasoconstrictor too, like many stims, so trying to get into a vein after the first shot is both tricky and not recommended.&nbsp; Repeated doses of EP just overstimulate the user and the euphoria gets smaller each time.<br /><br />I have mixed what, for me, is a moderate dose of EP in a moderate shot of Heroin to make a pseudo-speeball. I was sitting in a large park on a bench away from prying eyes but with a view of a beautiful lake. It felt fucking awesome - as good as a coke/h genuine SB but with longer-lasting qualities and a fantastic feeling of place and time. Thing is, I have the constitution of an elephant and have got away with some very dangerous things in the past. There&#039;s no guarantee that I might not drop dead at any time because of the things I&#039;ve tried so think carefully before you experiment with this, know your individual drugs and your tolerance to them.&nbsp; BUT - For FUCK&#039;S sake keep away from Butylone. It may not be the same for everyone but it did not feel good to me by any route of administration.
