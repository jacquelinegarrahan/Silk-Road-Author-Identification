				The first time I took LSD I bought it at a free party from a friendly gentleman, although I had no idea of dosage I had two drops, and a friend had another ( we paid £10 for 3 drops ).<br /><br />I&#039;ve only had one experience of taking a single dose, although unsure of the potency, and it was very weak.

				The time is up to you. I prefer to trip at night 8)<br /><br />I would suggest starting off with one, but if you&#039;ve already done 2C-B you could probably try 2. I did four on my first time and loved life (I&#039;M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD DO 4). Two will be a very strong experience and you should be prepared to have to sit down at some point and stare at the constant morphing patterns and colors appearing on the surfaces in front of you.<br /><br />I also couldn&#039;t stop laughing for a good 35-40 minutes one time when I was coming up, I wasn&#039;t laughing at anything in particular I just kept laughing and had this weird &quot;space/feeling&quot; in my head that felt weird if I WASNT laughing, singing or yelling. Laughing felt so natural so I just stuck my face in a pillow as everyone else around me also laughed at how insane I looked.<br /><br />Its fun though, be prepared to enjoy yourself ;D

				When I first used LSD (my first psychedelic experience) I underdosed (2 tabs supposedly 100ug each) and had a VERY underwhelming experience, after which I ended up going through a whole sheet before I ever finally had a serious experience a year later, partly due to being too impatient to ever let tolerance build up enough after that first dud trip. If I had it to do over again I would have done at least 4 tabs the first time.<br /><br />Assuming you&#039;re in a safe and comfortable setting, I&#039;d say err on the higher side. That&#039;s just my 2 cents as someone who doesn&#039;t get much out of middling trips. Now I always wait a full 4 weeks and do at least a 5 strip each time. One of the great things about LSD is that you can&#039;t really overdose.<br /><br />

				thanks for the replies..<br /><br />We already setted up our environment where we will trip in, we already did it for the 2C-B this weekend.. Maybe we can add some more stuff to make it more interesting? Any ideas?<br /><br />Also what do you recommend as music? Any guys have some good sets while tripping on LSD? We already have some sets while tripping on 2C-B, But we&#039;re always interested i finding new sets :)

				I started with 1 tab (Jannis dolphin, think ~130ug or is 110? dont&#039; remember) my first time, alone at home, very easy trip.<br /><br />The second time, in a camping village, with a friend, same tab. Really different trip, much more intense.<br /><br />Settings do a lot! my advice is to start with 1 tab, you can do twice next time :)<br /><br />Have fun together, but alone too, with some music in headphones, it&#039;s a cliché but listen Pink Floyd album<br /><br />Eat grapes and peaches, look and search into a bag, smoke, drink water from a bottle, watch some, trippy psychedelic video got from youtube.

Make sure you have the free time to devote to the trip without interruptions. Turn off your mobile phone etc nothing worse than your Mum etc wanting to talk to you and keeps ringing to get hold of you. <br /><br />2. Make sure your set and setting are good, LSD is not 2C-B, the headspace is different. Best&nbsp; avoid crowds and other people until you have tripped. Most bad trips happen because you didn&#039;t plan things right<br /><br />3. Make sure the people you are tripping with are good friends. Ones that really know you, there is nothing worse than tripping with someone who you don&#039;t really know and you are uncomfortable being around.<br /><br />4. Have some soft fruit and raw vegetables on hand to snack on, water is better than OJ or acidic juices.<br /><br />5. Have a good playlist already sorted, of music that is up beat and happy.<br /><br />6. If things feel uncomfortable, change the set and setting. Force a smile on your face and keep it there, write down a memory that makes you smile. Watch something like Madagascar on TV, change the music. Close your eyes and do some nice slow breathing.<br /><br />7. Don&#039;t drive and stay away from heights ( just because you won&#039;t coordinate well)<br /><br />8. Try to have easy access to woods or a forest that is safe and not crowded<br /><br />9. Take one tab one and half tabs, and if you feel too anxious and uncomfortable, restless and the trip doesn&#039;t seem to be progressing, maybe you need a little more to move you to a higher spiritual state.

				Well, 10 tabs for your first time is definitely not a good idea lol.<br /><br />Take 1 and a half at first, let it kick in, then after about 3-4hours take another.<br /><br />10 tabs should last you a long fucking time if you&#039;ve never done LSD before.<br /><br />Honestly, doing more than 3 you&#039;re first time, is asking for trouble. So only do a few of them, and save the rest for another time.<br /><br />

				Really good tips here from flyinghigh1660.<br />But I have to say I would recommend doing the first time completely alone, that gives you all the flexibility in the world. Start off with half a blotter (or even 1/4), wait a little until you notice an enhancement of thinking ability then do the other half, then up to 3 after a couple of hours. I did it like this and it was a perfect first time for me. I was kinda scared at the first time and the really super slow come-up has helped me a lot. Now I would do it differently and do 1-2 blotters without having micro dose after micro dose.

				Yes, thanks for the many tips FlyingHigh<br /><br />Anyway, there are some changesn first we were gonna trip with only 3, Now we will be in total with 6 (2 will not trip), so yea, I&#039;m thinking it will be too crowded? What do you guys think, with how many people do you normally trip?

				while on the subject of tripping alone, question:<br /><br />ive &#039;done&#039; LSD once. I write it in quotes because it was a bit of a bunk trip. Did it with 6 good friends. All of us doing it for the first time. even though very good friends, I think it we were too many, made the experience fully social rather than spiritual, especially since I later concluded that they just wanted to try LSD to get &#039;fucked up&#039;, not to learn from it. i had taken 1 xanax before the trip (later to find out this can &#039;kill&#039; the trip) was barely mindfucked, even though I had some pretty nice visuals.<br /><br />back to the question, I feel like I have yet to try LSD for the REAL first time. I was wondering, should I do it alone? I don&#039;t have anyone to trip with were Im living right now, and have wanted to &#039;retry&#039; lsd for a long time. And if you recommend I do it alone, should I keep it safe and stay at home? Or should I try to go somewhere in nature (i guess risking a bad trip)? I would probably take one 120ug tab, I guess.

A dose like 120ug, if it isn&#039;t enough and you don&#039;t have more, will make you restless and you will want to tidy up.&nbsp; So remove all the clutter first. Otherwise it will be too distracting and you will spend the time cleaning. And if you do it at home you might want to go out.<br /><br />I would recommend staying inside. Because you get a bit disorientated and walk around in circles outside, this could scare you unless you know to expect it. This is why a lower dose for first time outside is better if you want to go out. And bumping into other hikers may mean unwanted social interactions when you are not able to handle them which may freak you out.<br /><br />For staying inside, I would say have 2 tabs on hand and have the possibly to leave the house later on. If you want to handle issues and learn from the trip. Then inside is better, but you need to take enough to move you through the restless energy phase. And write down the issues you want to tackle. Be open to all emotions, and have music without words, words will distract you. A headset and eye shades and you will be in another world. Try some classical music for maximum effect.<br /><br />This book [clearnet] is really good for telling you how to trip and get the maximum utility out of the experience:- http://www.amazon.com/The-Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic/dp/1594774021<br /><br />For a day in the woods one tab so you can stay mobile and not too messed up, have a backpack, music on the iphone, and supplies. Take a blanket to sit on and make sure you are away from people and dangerous terrain. Phone battery fully charged, water, fruit, note book for writing in etc. <br /><br />If going out tripping alone. I always make sure I have told a sober buddy what I am doing, and if I haven&#039;t sent a text or called by a certain time, then they are to ring me. If they can&#039;t get hold of me then something is probably wrong. Oh and remember your keys!!!! I have locked myself out once, but I made sure I had a sober buddy who talked me through the panic about this. I then went and walked it off in the forest and then called a lock smith later on when I could socially function. If I want to trip outside, I drop early in the morning, so that there are more options for support from friends etc. And a sunny day is always naturally uplifting.<br /><br />Prior planning prevents piss poor performance. If I am starting a trip inside, I now hide a spare key outside, or put a post it note on the door to remind me and put my keys in shoe or something like that.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Good planning prevents bad trips. 8)<br /><br />

You won&#039;t all want to do the same thing at the same time. And if one person becomes annoying it will really piss you off. 2C-B is a naturally social drug and allows you to have a connection with people. LSD isn&#039;t like that and can be a bit hit and miss in a social group unless you are all experienced with taking it. Once you have done it once you know who the people in your life are that you will drop with. And that number is generally small, three to four is a good group trip number. And those people need to be people who have shared several life experiences with you.<br /><br />So it is possible if the two not tripping can escape. Also have they tripped before and know what to expect? A strange look or comment may freak you out. Non trippers have to be experienced and know how to handle people tripping. You want your trip to be simple and clean for the first time. You want to remove uncertainties not introduce lots more.&nbsp; You want to be able to control your environment, not allow your environment to control you.<br /><br />If there is no other choice, make sure you have the ability to go off on your own for a bit safely.&nbsp; Or the non trippers can go away and just come in to check on you. They won&#039;t &quot;get&quot; some of the things you are talking about and may get annoyed as you state for the 14th time how the universe works. You will be high for 12-16 hours, difficult for a sober person to handle that unless they know what they are doing.<br /><br />I tripped once with someone who I wasn&#039;t that close with, and it was really uncomfortable for me, but for them they were ok. But I at least had somewhere to go and chill out on my own. Two can be a difficult number as well, think about spending 12-16 hours with some one sober. Then think about trying to keep that social interaction up and trip at the same time.<br />

I write it in quotes because it was a bit of a bunk trip. Did it with 6 good friends. All of us doing it for the first time. even though very good friends, I think it we were too many, made the experience fully social rather than spiritual, especially since I later concluded that they just wanted to try LSD to get &#039;fucked up&#039;, not to learn from it. i had taken 1 xanax before the trip (later to find out this can &#039;kill&#039; the trip) was barely mindfucked, even though I had some pretty nice visuals.<br /><br />back to the question, I feel like I have yet to try LSD for the REAL first time. I was wondering, should I do it alone? I don&#039;t have anyone to trip with were Im living right now, and have wanted to &#039;retry&#039; lsd for a long time. And if you recommend I do it alone, should I keep it safe and stay at home? Or should I try to go somewhere in nature (i guess risking a bad trip)? I would probably take one 120ug tab, I guess.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you do it at home, make sure you have cleaned the place up. A dose like 120ug, if it isn&#039;t enough and you don&#039;t have more, will make you restless and you will want to tidy up.&nbsp; So remove all the clutter first. Otherwise it will be too distracting and you will spend the time cleaning. And if you do it at home you might want to go out.<br /><br />I would recommend staying inside. Because you get a bit disorientated and walk around in circles outside, this could scare you unless you know to expect it. This is why a lower dose for first time outside is better if you want to go out. And bumping into other hikers may mean unwanted social interactions when you are not able to handle them which may freak you out.<br /><br />For staying inside, I would say have 2 tabs on hand and have the possibly to leave the house later on. If you want to handle issues and learn from the trip. Then inside is better, but you need to take enough to move you through the restless energy phase. And write down the issues you want to tackle. Be open to all emotions, and have music without words, words will distract you. A headset and eye shades and you will be in another world. Try some classical music for maximum effect.<br /><br />This book [clearnet] is really good for telling you how to trip and get the maximum utility out of the experience:- http://www.amazon.com/The-Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic/dp/1594774021<br /><br />For a day in the woods one tab so you can stay mobile and not too messed up, have a backpack, music on the iphone, and supplies. Take a blanket to sit on and make sure you are away from people and dangerous terrain. Phone battery fully charged, water, fruit, note book for writing in etc. <br /><br />If going out tripping alone. I always make sure I have told a sober buddy what I am doing, and if I haven&#039;t sent a text or called by a certain time, then they are to ring me. If they can&#039;t get hold of me then something is probably wrong. Oh and remember your keys!!!! I have locked myself out once, but I made sure I had a sober buddy who talked me through the panic about this. I then went and walked it off in the forest and then called a lock smith later on when I could socially function. If I want to trip outside, I drop early in the morning, so that there are more options for support from friends etc. And a sunny day is always naturally uplifting.<br /><br />Prior planning prevents piss poor performance. If I am starting a trip inside, I now hide a spare key outside, or put a post it note on the door to remind me and put my keys in shoe or something like that.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Good planning prevents bad trips. 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 my friend :), super great tips you have shared. will definitely give that book a read. i want to learn a lot from the experience. and I keep reading people&#039;s reports of incredibly rewarding trips, and I can&#039;t help but wonder what the best ways to address these issues are.<br /><br />good vibes.<br />LL
