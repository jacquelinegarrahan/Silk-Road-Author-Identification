				Hey all!<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively well experience with acid and just had my first mushroom trip today. It was absolutely amazing, and I heavily recommend MUSHBUD&#039;s product due to the fantastic packaging, stealth, and product itself. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/99b619e6a9<br /><br />I&#039;ll be moving soon for a new job and as I get acclimated to the new area won&#039;t have much time for tripping on anything. As such, I&#039;d rather take the rest of the shrooms asap, but worry about tolerance issues.<br /><br />I took 3 grams in capsules today and had an amazingly intense, colorful, insightful time. I was wondering if shooting the remaining 7 grams tomorrow would<br />A. Be not worth it due to tolerance issues,<br />B. Be the perfect dosage given the tolerance I&#039;ve developed, or<br />C. Be way too high a dose even with tolerance.<br /><br />Any insight into the issue would be much appreciated!

				Rule of thumb is double the dose everyday you continue to use them.<br />So seven sounds about right and 14grams lol the next day<br />Rock on

I haven&#039;t tried any psychedelics before shrooms, so my first dosage (1.8g) it was pretty decent.

I haven&#039;t tried shrooms since then lol

				I just experienced everything that ever has been, currently is, and will be. The ego that was a solid atheist will probably begin to question everything he&#039;s believed once he sobers up.

				Hey mate, I think I can be of some assistance here, I&#039;m in the same boat with being experienced with acid and have just got into shrooms recently. The general rule of thumb is to wait 7 days for tolerance to go down. If you do that you should be fine. But take note that other psychedelics have a cross tolerance and repeated weekly use of even just one may mean you need a break to lower tolerance again. 3 weeks ago I took 300ug of LSD, 2 weeks ago I took 3.5g of mushrooms, 1 week ago I took 1200mg of 25i-NBOMe and last night I did 7g of mushrooms. The first 3 trips were very intense, as was the one last night but the one last night was a little weaker than it should have been given it was 7g (that being said it was still more intense than 3.5, just not as much as it should have been). So after prolonged use I would recommend a little break. Hope this helps.
