				I have been taking Adderall for less than a month, and at pretty low doses.&nbsp; 10-20mg twice a day, once or twice I took 30mg, but it was way too much and I thought I might have a stroke.<br /><br />Well now the past few days I am just so down and can&#039;t get motivated to do anything.&nbsp; I am miserable.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t take the Adderall I can hardly move I am so exhausted.&nbsp; If I do take it I am awake and anxious and really depressed.&nbsp; Oh, and I am getting paranoid as hell too.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Should I just taper off of it or is there a better alternative?&nbsp;

				Severe apathy and unmotivation is more of a symptom of clinical depression than ADD...your serotonin levels may be more of the issue rather than your dopamine...however you may have depleted your dopamine because of this misdiagnosis and self medication with amphetamines which is causing the paranoia...<br /><br />taking more doesn&#039;t necessarily mean getting better results...that&#039;s a very recreational drug user mentality...it&#039;s different when you&#039;re medicating...you only do as needed to get the desired effect...and if you&#039;re not getting the desired effect then you need to try something else...<br /><br />if it&#039;s a genuine problem then it&#039;s best to see a doctor so they can help you can find the most efficient solution...

				Thank you, yeah I am on an antidepressant too.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t seem to help no matter what type I try, I have been on over 20 (no joke) different SSRI&#039;s.&nbsp; I am basically trying to self medicate on top of what the doctors have been trying to help and failing at for about ten years now.&nbsp; It gets to the point where I get kinda desperate for something to make me function like a semi normal human.&nbsp; I have such a hard time with simple stuff, like leaving the house just to go to the grocery store but I force myself to do the bare minimums. <br /><br />&nbsp;I am going to a new DR on Monday so I will see if he can help.&nbsp; The one I was seeing before was a bitch, she told me to just to try harder and not be so lazy. No joke.

				Amphetamine tolerance can build quickly, and it builds moreso with daily use. You&#039;re not using high amounts, but it&#039;s to be expected that the &#039;feel-good&#039; effects are going to start to taper off, and you&#039;ll be left with just the physical effects. I&#039;m not sure what the effects of the specific antidepressant/adderall are, but the adderall crash isn&#039;t fun no matter what. This might be making your depression worse.<br /><br />If you&#039;re depressed and you&#039;re looking for drugs to help you feel happier, then your best bet is probably hallucinogens. Not necessarily because they&#039;re going to make you feel good in the moment, but because they allow one to look at life differently. It&#039;s helpful to be able to take a different perspective on life, and a trip can often help with this. LSD and Mushrooms are good places to start, but I&#039;d check to make sure that they&#039;re not contraindicated with the medications you&#039;re currently taking.<br /><br />Lastly, I know that it sounds super-lame and new-agey, but give meditation a try. Do some reading about how to begin, and start with just 3 minutes per day. It&#039;s easy to do, and you&#039;re not going to do yourself any harm by trying.&nbsp; At the very least, it&#039;ll give you a break from your thoughts for a few minutes. I have noticed a significant difference in my mental well being since starting a regular meditation practice. The trick is to do it every day, even if it&#039;s just for a few minutes.<br /><br />I wish you the best, bro. PM me if you have any questions.
