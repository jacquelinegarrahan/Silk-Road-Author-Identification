				Hey PPL OF SR,<br />I&#039;m after some HELP as im fairly new to what is called #3 Heroin as its not that common in Australia that i know of we normally get as what is referred to&nbsp; #4 H. <br />What im wanting to know is the type of Citric Acid that is needed to mix with #3H to use IV as we have NSP&#039;s here in Au but we dont get the sachets in the pack we have most likely due to the fact that #4H is more common the #3.&nbsp; In the research that i have done i have found that you can purchase it at the supermarkets and have found it this is a link to the product i have found and was wanting to know can somebody please tell me if this is the correct product to use?? Here below is the link to the Citric Acid <br /><br />http://www.mckenziesfoods.com.au/product/97/McKenzies_Citric_Acid<br /><br />Also if someone could give me a rule of thumb type of ratio that is needed when mixing it (eg: 1:5 Citric Acid:#3Heroin)

				That&#039;s fine to use. To be honest any citric acid is fine, as long as it&#039;s not mixed with other agents. Also pure Vitamin C powder works a treat.<br /><br />I would say if using citric then you&#039;d need about 1 part citric to 5 parts heroin.<br /><br />If using pure Vit C powder then it&#039;s more like 3 parts vit c to 5 parts Heroin. <br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re not sure on the amount of citric, just start off with a small amount (just a small pinch) and you can always add more if it doesn&#039;t cook up properly - either that or use more than you think - but It&#039;ll burn as it goes up your veins, but the main thing is it&#039;ll cook it up fine.

Once again a huge thanks for your help mate you have helped me out tremendously now i can both smoke and iv it when i get the chance<br /><br />~*~ Remember Information Is Only Information If You Share It ~*~

				No problem at all mate. I was on Heroin for 10+ years, and have no veins left&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />It&#039;s safe to say I know how to cook up&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />P.S. I don&#039;t use H anymore, managed to get clean(ish), I still use benzo&#039;s and put the odd hit of Coke in my groin

				Ha! Same for me too Japan1980... My veins are shot to hell, Kicked the habit, don&#039;t shoot anymore, but still smoke up a little H now and again... Keep a stock of benzo&#039;s and opiates on hand for fast detox if I get a little stupid... It helps not having someone to buy from in my city!!<br /><br />Good advice too... Oh also, don&#039;t cook the shit out of it, just let it hit the boil.
