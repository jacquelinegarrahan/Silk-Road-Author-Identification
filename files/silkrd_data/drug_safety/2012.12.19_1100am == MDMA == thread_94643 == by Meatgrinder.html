				Hey guys,<br /><br />whats the max dosage of MDMA before it gets toxic?<br /><br />I&#039;m 98kg, 5&#039;7&quot; - I usually double drop my pills (100mg each), is there room for error/any point dropping a 3rd on the start or just a waste? or anything else that can heighten my roll? tolerance is medium? Can drop 2 then 1 every hour afterwards for 7-10 hours no issues. Also have a bit of gear to keep me awake (depending how many hours I worked during the week)<br /><br />Cheers

				as a drug user, LD50 is a term you need to get familiar with really soon. you should also get used to entering that term with the name of the drug you&#039;re thinking of ingesting into the search engine of your choice...for example i entered &quot;LD50 MDMA&quot; into google and came up with the following:<br /><br />The single dose LD50 in humans can only be guessed at, but is probably on the order of 10-20 mg/kg. (LD50 means the dose that will kill 50% of people who take it.) At 130 lbs (60kg), that means a single dose of 600-1200 mg. In recent years, law enforcement reports that the average MDMA content of ecstasy pills has fallen to about 70mg/tablet, so you&#039;d have to take 10-20 pills to achieve a dose which is 50% likely to be fatal. There are fewer than 100 fatalities per year in the US where MDMA is detected, and fewer than 10 where it is the ONLY drug detected.

				It may be worth noting that there are actually very few actual cases of MDMA overdose because the LD50 is so high, but if someone dies with MDMA in their system it could be due to any number of factors that aren&#039;t actual overdoses.<br /><br />For instance, if you took 100mg MDMA and combined it with DXM, you may die die from serotonin syndrome rather than an MDMA overdose. There is a major difference between death from MDMA OD and death from combinations.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t to say go wild and do as much as you want, but just be aware that there is a lot of misconception between what is dangerous and what is just media hype and misinformation from myths. MDMA is relatively safe when it is not combined with certain other substances and certain precautions are taken :)

				I&#039;ve had a meltdown from dropping a second mdma cap during a nye party years ago.<br />Dropped it an hour after the first cap. I had to leave the party, went home, and sat in a chair staring at the floor for 3 hours with sweat just dripping off me.<br />They would have been 200mg caps easy, so having 2 within 2 hours was a big mistake. I&#039;m 6&#039;3&quot; and 90kg and used a lot of E before so i was very surprised it happened. :P

				I think the biggest issue with MDMA is really that it&#039;s just so damn great that you really want to keep the high going. Normally I set all sorts of rules about how much I&#039;m going to do and then find that through advanced e-mathmatics that amount becomes however much I actually have. IMO the tradeoff for doing more really does diminish pretty quickly. I&#039;d rather fly high for a few hours every month or so off the stuff than get totally fucked for a night and not want to take it for months after that. <br /><br />My advice, take a look at complementary comedowns like 2CB or GHB but make sure you understand the compounds especially when and how much to does. I&#039;ve read so many stories about people eating this stuff daily for years that I don&#039;t really panic about the occasional binge, but all in all the cleanest happiest trips tend to be well dosed at the onset and properly bumped a single time at about 1.5 hours in and then spaced out by a few weeks or months apart. That&#039;s not going to fly you all night though so having a come down plan to ease your landing makes it all the more fun. <br /><br />Also, taking pills in general is just silly. Tested powder from a good vendor will let you get that right first dose rather than having to play the did I take enough guessing game you might have with random pills. If you have 10g of tested e you know for a good long while your rolls are going to be exactly what you want them to be... just don&#039;t have the whole 10g with you when you are tripping :-&gt;

The best method is to get a proper dose on the first one and re-dose once or twice. Personally, I like 180 mg oral followed by 120 mg insufflated about 2 hours later, but ymmv. After that you start fighting the hedonic treadmill and you&#039;re out of serotonin. It&#039;s a complete waste of time to take MDMA 2 nights in a row. I wouldn&#039;t recommend taking it once a week unless you&#039;re consuming 5-HTP to boost serotonin levels, but the best schedule is once a month. At that rate I don&#039;t need any supplements or boosters, and I get virtually no negative after effects.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend combining MDMA with alcohol either.. it&#039;s probably not going to kill you but dehydration and additional kidney stress isn&#039;t good for your body.<br /><br />Bluelight.ru is a great place to check out some basics for MDMA combinations and the dangers therein.<br /><br />My favorite combinations are MDMA + LSD, Ketamine, and nitrous oxide!

				After much reading it looks like the healthy dosage schedule is once every 3 months.&nbsp; Anything more and you&#039;re in dangerous territory because of serotonin depletion.<br /><br />MDMA is something to be respected.
