				Looking to accurately weigh and capsule some molly. From past experience, I find it difficult to work with, as pouring from the bag results in the chunks flying everywhere. And using pieces of paper on the scale can make it inaccurate.<br /><br />Does anyone have any advice or tips for the general handling of MDMA?<br /><br />Maybe even any tools or types of containers that can allow for accurate pouring or measuring getting the substance from the bag to the scale to the capsule?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Funnel into capsule... poor down funnel!<br /><br />I&#039;ve even made funnels out of rolling up a piece of paper and taping it together... really easy.<br /><br />Hey a little squared edge bowl for the scales, reset the scales to 0 including the weight of the bowl... then weigh out mdma and repeat!

I also find that it helps to buy the same size caps each time you cap up, as you generally get a feel for it after you cap a few hundred of the same size up. Then it&#039;s all a matter of just eyeballing it and making sure you&#039;re right.<br /><br />That being said, I will offer some more advice:<br /><br />People have said to make sure you have a scale, but I will recommend a specific type - go for a jeweler&#039;s scale, as they are generally smaller, come with a measuring spoon, and the way they&#039;re set up ( scale with a small bowl-ish thing instead of a completely flat surface ) is a LOT better for measuring powders than a flat scale. It also tends to be a lot better when it comes to measuring legitimately.<br /><br />If you get a measuring spoon and a sufficiently sized capsule, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll need a funnel... I&#039;m used to working with methylone though, in large amounts, so when I cap up I am capping at the very least 200 capsules at one time, which can be VERY time consuming if you make it less simple than it needs to be. Generally, I take it slow the first 50 caps, make sure that everything is correct and the measurements are what I want them to be, and then eyeball it from there rather than weigh out each bit of crystal or powder individually. Saves a lot of time. <br /><br />If you&#039;re dealing with big crystals, I recommend a mortar&amp;pestle, they really make a huge difference. So much easier to crush up anything, and most of them are ceramic ( although you can get metal if you prefer ) and doing get too much of the goods stuck to the pestle or mortar.

				Also once you get good at eyeballing, if you ever think you might be over or under you can just throw the pill on the scale and see how accurate you are, since they should all weigh the same after the products inside (another reason to get the same pill type)

				Will go through my procedure, but its pretty much the same.<br /><br />I pour the bag and crush so there are no rocks getting caught in the funnel.<br />Next I use a piece of wide tape doubled over on a table. The pills will stick and stand up on one end so you don&#039;t need to hold them while filling.<br />Make your funnel out of a piece of paper and the tape.<br />Scoop the now fine powder into your scale until you get the required weight.<br />Use your funnel. If you haven&#039;t crushed it enough the funnel will block. Don&#039;t try and blow it out like I did the first time it happened. I ended up with around 80mg going on the floor. If that happens, proceed to lick the floor.<br />If necessary you can weigh the finished pill. Zero the scales with an empty pill on before doing this.<br />Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to complete capping a gram in around 10mins.

				Personally, i like to get all of what i want to cap and put it on a piece of printer paper. Get the biggest caps possible. Weigh out the cap. Take off one end and dip the large end into the mdma on the paper. Then put the cap back on, but making sure not to lock the cap since you may need to adjust. If the cap is weighing what you want then keep going. If you have too much it works well to turn the cap parallel to the ground and rotate the pill back and forth letting only a small amount drop out. Best doing at a table too.

				Alright I&#039;ll share my wisdom :)<br /><br />To start off I weigh out the total amount of MDMA I want cap, lets say 5grams on a small container on my scale. Then I simply fill each capsule out of that tray and watch the scale go down 4.90, 4.80, 4.70, etc<br /><br />This makes things wayyyy easier then trying to weigh each point by itself which is a complete pain :(<br /><br />also you don&#039;t have to funnel .1 grams of something into a small container.<br /><br />Much Love,<br /><br />Rocker

				Just scanned the text here.<br /><br />My thoughts were: mdma in capsule = use a capsule maker. Pretty accurate. You can choose your dosage (capsules size 000,00,0,1,2,3,4). For example: 0 is for .5g if I remember correctly.<br /><br />Do they not sell those over where you live? Where do you live? PM me if you prefer that. Perhaps I know a vendor who could help you out...<br /><br />

				Good ideas everyone.<br /><br />I used a mix of a notecard with plastic spoon and paper funnel.<br /><br />Also got pretty good at eyeballing 150mg on the spoon too, so it was a pretty efficient way to cap up 5 grams.<br /><br />Thanks for the tips!

				I don&#039;t see how those pill capsule filling machines can be accurate at all.&nbsp; They only fill up the capsule with what you put in there, and not all substances weigh out the same.&nbsp; For instance, mdma is often shards, at least what I get is, and those will not settle like a fine powder.&nbsp; I think a scale needs to be used or you could have large disparities.&nbsp; With that being said I have only a little experience filling capsule so don&#039;t take my word for it.&nbsp; It just seems logical to conclude that not all powders weigh the same so filling a certain size capsule should not lead one to believe they know what the weight of the product inside is.

				Those pill filling machines are terrible for using the way they suggest accurately, but can be a great tool if used with other methods.&nbsp; If you can find one that&#039;s light and fits on top of your scale, you can fill the platform w/ caps, use a small coke spoon to scoop what you&#039;ve decided w/ a bit of trial and error is a point and fill a cap, zero the scale if it&#039;s right, and repeat.&nbsp; I made my own w/ a small piece of plastic and a dremel tool w/ a tip that was the exact size as a 0 cap.<br /><br />If you powder your product well, you eventually get good enough that you can just eyeball them and double check that they&#039;re all w/in .01 once you&#039;re done.&nbsp; Having an appropriately sized scoop is the key to the whole process, and I&#039;d suggest figuring that out first.<br /><br />Also, to maximize effiency, be sure to do all steps in the process separately and all at once.&nbsp; Meaning, don&#039;t open a new cap each time you&#039;re going to fill one, but instead bust them all open at once before you start.&nbsp; Then go ahead and fill them all, and finally put the cap on em all.&nbsp; Don&#039;t open a cap, fill it, close it, and move onto the next - think like a machine :)

				In my experience, capsule machines work fine if used correctly. Figure out how much molly you want per capsule, figure out how much molly fits in the capsules you are using(weigh an empty capsule, fill it using the capsule machine, weigh again, make sure to compact it) then mix dextrose or some other type of filler with your molly at the ratio required so that a full cap is going to be the exact amount of molly you originally wanted.&nbsp; I was getting maybe 5% either side at 130mg doses.&nbsp; Just make sure you put some effort into both crushing up the MDMA as fine as possible, and mixing the filler in so that it has an even distribution.&nbsp;

It&#039;s really not that hard to get it fairly consistent even without adding anything as long as you get the right size capsules. Use the smallest capsule possible for your dosage to reduce variance between capsules.
