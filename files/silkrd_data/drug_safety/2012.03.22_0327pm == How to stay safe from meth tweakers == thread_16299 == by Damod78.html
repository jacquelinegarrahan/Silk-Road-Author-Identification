				If you come in to contact with a meth tweaker, knowing what to do can save your life. Here are some great tips that may help keep you safe!<br /><br />1. Keep a 7-10 ft. distance. Coming too close can be perceived as threatening.<br /><br />2. Do not shine bright lights at him. The tweaker is already paranoid and if blinded by a bright light he is likely to run or become violent.<br /><br />3. Slow your speech and lower the pitch of your voice. A tweaker already hears sounds at a fast pace and in a high pitch.<br /><br />4. Slow your movements. This will decrease the odds that the tweaker will misinterpret your physical actions.<br /><br />5. Keep your hands visible. If you place your hands where the tweaker cannot see them, he might feel threatened and could become violent.<br /><br />6. Keep the tweaker talking. A tweaker who falls silent can be extremely dangerous. Silence often means that his paranoid thoughts have taken over reality, and anyone present can become part of the tweakerâ€™s paranoid delusions.<br /><br />&nbsp;:o

I was just cracking a goofy joke. Yes I am a &#039;tweaker&#039; but very casual user. And I use other drugs too. You use stims too don&#039;t you? Hell, why the attitude then? We are all here to get high in one form or the other. Lulz or lol, I dont care as long as someone is laughing. I really don&#039;t want to argue, and I guess you are looking for one. And I actually found your first post funny in a kind of dark and twisted way. I like dark humor time from time.

				I think a G19 and strong situational awareness is the best tweeker defense. <br /><br />Occasional meth use is fine, but damn... When people don&#039;t sleep for DAYS and they use massive amounts of meth, they can become serious threats. <br /><br />Your post was pretty funny though. <br />
