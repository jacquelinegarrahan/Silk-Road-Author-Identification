				I went into a head shop looking for an &quot;oil burner&quot; to smoke DMT. I was under the impression that they aren&#039;t displayed but, kept there out of sight. I asked for an oil burner and described what I wanted. I did not mention anything contraband. All I asked for was a oil burner for liquid incense. I could see the moment that it clicked in the managers mind what I was asking for. She said they did not have that and that it was illegal due to it&#039;s off label use. I was rather disappointed. After hearing that, I apologized and left. It bugs me that the purported reason for them being illegal is ignored in the case of the hundreds of glass pipes and bongs that certainly aren&#039;t fucking there for smoking tobacco. I&#039;m just not sure what to do now, I could go online and order or just rig of something home made. I tried to search online to see if she was right, but I can&#039;t find any information on them being banned from sale in my state. Even if they aren&#039;t and she was lying to me, I can&#039;t very well go back and keep asking and there isn&#039;t another store to try anywhere nearby. I also noticed that they are no longer being listed on Ebay.
