				I just received phenibut to see how it would help with my stress. The only problem is that i have nothing to weight the proper amount nor i actually know what would be therapeutic amount. Tea spoon?<br />Experiences of this product are also welcomed. Ive heard that even couple times/ short use causes strong rebound/withdrawal symptoms. Thanks.

				Obviously I would recommend getting a $25 milligram scale -- one of those little gem scales. They are SO worth it.<br /><br />Without one, I&#039;d suggest starting out with a full tablespoon and waiting for a few hours and then go from there.<br /><br />Just keep in mind that Phenibut takes a good three hours to start kicking in, so it&#039;s easy to feel compelled to redose too soon and then you&#039;ll find yourself puking and feeling crappy.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve read all the horror stories floating around about how bad the withdrawals were for people. Personally, I took an average of like three grams per day for around a month and quit without any problems. Maybe I just got lucky though. I wouldn&#039;t push my luck again with it.

				Hi<br /><br />I actually tried last evening/night teaspoonful of this phenibut. Clock was 8 pm when i drank it with juice(tasted bad like most drugs :P). Most notable effect/symptom was that after two hours at ten i decided to go to sleep(and maybe wait phenibut to bring me relaxing state to that) and went to bathroom to wash my teeth. From the mirror i noticed my pupils were bit dilated and vision slightly blurry, which reminded me of MDMA. I felt slightly anxious and i returned to computer for an moment when i started to shake uncontrollably about 5-10 minutes until it stopped. I felt less anxious at that moment, but i shaked or muscle spammed. That was most notable effect and i cant tell for sure did it have any other effects(maybe amount was too small/big). I may have felt bit more stable. What happened? Was it &quot;come up&quot;? I cant say that sleep was any relaxing. Dreams were disturbing and i wake up morning with my usual anxiety. Any ideas? Thanks.

				To answer the question in the OP, I would suggest not taking phenibut more than 3 days in a row in order to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

				<br />I&#039;d take 0.5-0.7 in the morning if i&#039;m going to the city for biz or any social activity..<br />Try 1-1.5 for tripping by the sea or in the nature (without planned social interactions).<br /><br />

A full rounded teaspoon of what I have (lab grade and verified Phenibut) works out to be around 3 grams. You need a milligram scale to weigh it out correctly because powdered chemicals aren&#039;t reliably measured by volume due to the density of the powder being different from source to source. <br /><br />A full teaspoon should have left you with a serious hangover feeling if it was pure and you had no built up tolerance. I take Benzos (which act on the same receptors in the brain) and a full teaspoon had me seriously fucked up. I feel great mentally but the room was spinning. <br /><br />

				&quot;It sounds like you got weak and/or cut Phenibut.&quot;<br />I did wonder that myself. I dont think there is any way to check that? The reason i haven&#039;t bought scale is that i had already bought one but it broke soon :(.<br />So my symptoms might mean that phenibut might have weak and short effects and shaking ans stuff were already withdraw/ hangover.

A good one! I&#039;d say so. Sort of.. <br />Sometimes i have that trippy feeling<br />and a liquid, kinda moving state of mind..<br />Sensing the flow.. Not always though<br />or i just get used to the state itself.<br /><br />Def it can bring the experience i could only<br />describe as &quot;mind over matter&quot; phenomena.<br />Or sense of being at the right place at the right time.<br />Relatively weak, but still very much like tripping..

				Isn&#039;t it funny that a substance with such weak effects can cause withdrawl symptoms?&nbsp; Is phenibut the worst drug ever?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only tried 1/4 tsp of the Primaforce at once and it makes me sleepy if I have alcohol and MAYBE it improves my visual concentration..

The withdraw symptoms only come with frequent use as you ramp up your dosage when the tolerance builds quickly. I&#039;ve never experienced any shaking or edginess while on it. I did however get that effect when I first bought some in capsule form. The capsules didn&#039;t seem to do what they claimed anyway so I prefer my current source.<br /><br />You can actually find this stuff on Ebay still and use the reviews as a guide. Stay away from the capsules as they tend to be weak. I use a clearnet supplement vendor to source mine. The ebay vendor was Muscle Empire I believe. It took a few days to get shipped but when it got here it made sense. The guy had it sent directly from the lab that made it. It was way stronger than the other varieties I had bought before. At low doses, it actually makes me more attentive and improves my game play in FPS games by a noticable amount along with helping with anxiety. <br /><br />I avoid tolerance by only taking it a couple days a week.<br /><br />And before anyone bitches about me mentioning the clearnet source, the item in question is entirely legal to buy and even sold in some supplements in drug stores so not putting anyone at risk. Just trying to help someone avoid buying counterfeit/weak product.
