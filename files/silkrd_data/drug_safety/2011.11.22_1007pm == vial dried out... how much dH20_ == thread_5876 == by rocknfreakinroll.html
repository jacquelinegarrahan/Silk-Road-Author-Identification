				Bought half vial a while back which has since dried out.&nbsp; Wondering how much distilled water to put in to reconstitute it without bouncing off the planet.&nbsp; standard sweet breath dropper.&nbsp; thanks in advance!

				One drop of water is a minum.<br />Twenty minums make a millilitre<br /><br />so 2.5ml looks like right answer to me

				I came up with the same answer, but with different math.<br /><br />Vials of acid generally come in 5ml to 100 hits. his original was 50 hits, so 5ml/2= 2.5ml<br /><br />

				a drop of water does not have a standard volume. The size of a drop depends on both the material and geometry of the opening that the water is coming out of. That said, drops formed from the same dropper will have a fairly consistent volume. For example, the volume of a drop of water from a 30 ga stainless steel needle will have a different volume than ones from a glass eye dropper, but drops made from either will be pretty consistent.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you use the same type of container to figure out your dilution as you&#039;re going to use to actually dose with.

				Yeah, the original container says 3.2ml of liquid and the manufacturer claims that is 160 drops of product.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t know the alcohol content of the original product, which would presumably affect the size of the drops.&nbsp; I like the testing idea.&nbsp; Thanks everyone!&nbsp; My previous experiences with this drug came from small squares of paper bought individually from sketchy dudes in concert parking lots, so I appreciate everybody&#039;s input.
