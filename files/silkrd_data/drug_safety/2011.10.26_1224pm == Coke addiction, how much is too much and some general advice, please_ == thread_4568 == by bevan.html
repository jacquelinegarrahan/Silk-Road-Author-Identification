				Hi, I have recently started taking Coke on a more regular basis than before, and would like to educate myself on it so that I have my eyes open. <br /><br />I have been in a lifestyle before which involved drinking huge quantities of Alchohol on a regular basis (managing a huge party-bar) ... and a little eduction on the subject of alcohol, a few core &#039;takeouts&#039; helped me through it with little or no damaging effects. <br /><br />I would like to similarly educate myself on Coke now. <br /><br />Not a huge fan of &quot;The Man&#039;s&quot; advice, so seeking it out here. <br /><br />I am wondering a few things ...<br /><br />1. How much is too much? What are the warning signs that addiction is starting, and how do I recognize them? <br />2. Are there some best practices to guard against it? <br />3. When doing coke, are there some best practice things to do with it to minimize damage and unwanted effects? <br /><br />Any insights into any of the above from those with some experience would be really well appreciated!

				Any substance becomes a problem when you are using it for everyday life, as apposed to on occasions, socially and making a &quot;night&quot; of it on the weekend etc. <br /><br />DO NOT use it when ur bored......That is a surefire way to start an addiciton. <br /><br />If you notice urself hiding the fact ur high from people around u that KNOW u do the drug, this is another sign.<br /><br />At the same time, if ur finding urself high around people that dont have any idea you do said things, also cause for concern, you should be able to socialise and get out without it.<br /><br />Basically stick to having it on your weekends, or if midweek, make sure its not a case of being bored infront of the TV or computer, and taking a hit to make it not so boring.

Addiction is a slippery slope, and its only once ur in the heart of an addiction you are able to step back and realize how addicted you are, it happens without you realizing.

Last time was now 2 years ago.<br /><br />It really _is_ a slippery slope.<br /><br />Asking yourself wether or not you&#039;re addicted is a sign in my mind.<br /><br />Also the stuff said above about hiding is a sign.<br /><br />How long can you do without? How often do you think about cocaine when you&#039;re off it? Do you have dreams in which you search for coke but can never seem to get any? Do you tend to maneuver yourself into situations where you can use cocaine?<br /><br />Cocaine is one of the bad-assest drugs I know. It&#039;s fucking with the learning/reward chemistry of your brain big-time (that&#039;s why it&#039;s so great) and your brain (or certain parts of it) develop elaborate strategies (and I mean elaborate to the point where one such story could fill a book) in order to GET MORE (it&#039;s such a great reward and the brain such a good learner) and at the same time hide it from your consciousness. So this happens unconsciously and it takes a lot of effort to unveil these mechanisms.<br /><br />It took drastic measures for me to get off cocaine.<br /><br />I hope you can use cocaine from time to time recreationally, if you want that. (although I doubt it, for me it doesn&#039;t seem possible, I would slip right back into the shit, I think).<br /><br />Don&#039;t fool yourself, don&#039;t get others started.<br />

				I&#039;ve made myself 5 rules for playing with coke:<br /><br />1) only ever do measured amounts<br />2) set a limit to how much you allow yourself to do at one time<br />3) set a time limit for when you allow yourself to take a subsequent bump<br />4) if you know you&#039;re going to want do to some at a specific time (party, event, etc.) completely abstain until that time<br />5) if you&#039;re not feeling enough effects abiding to these rules, its time to set it aside for a day or more<br /><br />I stick to these rules almost religiously, because I know if I&#039;ve done some, I probably cannot be trusted at that moment to make rational decisions about it.<br /><br />I prepare a fair amount ahead of time and put it in the bullet. I then use what the bullet dispenses as my measuring stick for how much I&#039;m doing. Even if I&#039;m making lines, I dispense it from the bullet so I have a somewhat measured amount. For me and the bullet I use, two cupfuls from it make a healthy, average line. I allow myself to go as high as three per line if its the first hit, but no more. If its new product, I do only one cupful to see how it works for me.<br /><br />For the time limit, I choose a minimum of 45 minutes. If I didn&#039;t note the time when I last hit it, I have to start my timing then for 45 minutes... no guessing is allowed because judgement about this is always going to be skewed in the wrong direction.<br /><br />For an event, party, etc., I know that I&#039;ll want to be feeling the affects of it during that moment. If I&#039;ve been playing with it ahead of time, I might be nearing tolerance levels at that point and I&#039;ll just want to break rules and do too much. So for specific events, abstaining beforehand is always the best policy.<br /><br />If I am not feeling it enough within the limits of the rules, its time to set it aside and let myself recover as much as possible as I&#039;m just wasting it chasing after something my tolerance at that moment won&#039;t allow. Any amount I do once I&#039;ve reached this point is just being wasteful because &quot;just one more bump&quot; will not have any affect I&#039;m looking for.

I was on vacation and was so bored looking for things to do so I started smoking. When I came home 3 weeks later,&nbsp; it was a fullblown habit. <br />I don&#039;t know much about coke addiction since I only did it here and there. <br />Lets say I haven&#039;t had any food, sex, or drugs in awhile, if someone were to wheel in a table full of my favorite foods and naked models laying on it and in his other hand a few grams of a drug. And if he told me, &quot;you must choose between the table (laden with delicious food and naked ladies) or this drug..&quot; And if I picked the drugs, then I would know it was addiction!<br /><br /><br />

				joe knows. And so do I.<br /><br />Cocaine addiction is not a fun thing.<br /><br />If you&#039;re starting to wonder what the signs of addiction are so that you can try to use it without becoming addicted, that is a warning sign.<br /><br />I&#039;m not judging you at all. I&#039;m just saying, from my own personal experience, that was one of my early indicators. Please be safe.<br />

Oh man, this is majorly sad! And here, people, you can see what kind of a drug this is: makes you leave A WOMAN THAT WANTS TO BE FUCKED only so you can have more of that drug.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t experience this myself, although as explained in my first post, I was addicted to coke for a long time. Here&#039;s why:<br /><br />I tried like hell not to be on coke when meeting my girlfriend (sadly that meant not meeting her a lot of times when actually I could&#039;ve). Didn&#039;t work out all the time but she wouldn&#039;t notice (I was hiding and she&#039;s never been around people taking coke). This was going on for years. At some point in the endgame (about 1 year before I finally quit), I told her I took coke (that was very hard to do) and also that I &quot;had a problem&quot; with that. Her reaction was not harsh or anything and she didn&#039;t judge me (thank you!). But the mere knowdge that she knew kinda changed my thinking. It helped me to confirm the realization that really I couldn&#039;t go on like that with my life any more. I talked to her about it, that was tremendously helpful. I aso talked to my &quot;cocaine-friends&quot; about it, we all knew we were addicted and had to stop, but didn&#039;t. In the end, a large part of what gave me the strength to take the pretty drastic steps I had to take was probably her and my wanting to be with her (I really love her)<br /><br />I&#039;m still with her and kudos to her for going through this shit with me. I&#039;m tremendously glad I didn&#039;t loose her! I would&#039;ve deserved to.<br /><br />I actually have tears in my eyes now, argh.<br />

				Yes coke is the hell for your life !<br /><br />I only took couple of grams in 2 years to understand what a shit it is. I just stopped when i saw how it affects you on the depressive part. That&#039;s incredible how fast it interact with your spirit and soul.<br /><br />I smoked since 15 years and never felt depressive and bad in my body like the coke withdrawal.<br /><br />You didn&#039;t feel the power of the life with this, only illusions of power.

				For me, I get a specified amount and a specified time before I allow myself to buy more than that amount. Pick up a ball, and not do so again for 3 months. While I have found that this kind of initially encourages heavy usage when you first get it and then a couple months of sobriety (well, from coke that is). Not sure if you are a fan of psychedelics, but after some intense self-discovery with their aid I found that the way I look at drugs and addiction is different now.<br /><br />In the end, its just not worth it - the high is meh, the cost is ridiculous, and I&#039;ve seen one too many friends fall to it. So do it when there is an occasion to do it (I like to think of it this way, if it is an event where my father, who does not smoke, would pull out a cigar with friends, it is appropriate to use coke)

				I&#039;m a big fan of the netipot. <br /><br />I also found that saline nose spray helps tremendously, before, during and after. Note that I&#039;m talking about the saline only spray like Ocean brand or its generic equivalent. The nasal sprays that &quot;help you breathe&quot; are to be avoided at all costs of course.<br /><br />Anyway, there&#039;s something about how the saline spray hits the same surfaces that anything else you inhale has hit that really feels beneficial. CVS has an Ocean value pack that has a large and small bottle... one for the house and one for the car.

				Some stuff that may mean you are addicted or getting there:<br />When you start sweating when you see the coke and start cutting up the lines.<br />When you smell or taste coke when it&#039;s not even in front of you or using it.<br />When you can&#039;t stop thinking about it.<br />When you can&#039;t stop using it all day or can&#039;t go a week/month with out it, obviously.<br /><br /><br />You really shouldn&#039;t do more than .5-1g MAX a day.&nbsp; I know people and my self can do 1-3grams if wanted but that&#039;s not really healthy.&nbsp; It&#039;s like having a glass of wine at night but the guy next to you is drinking 2 bottles to his face.&nbsp; That kind of use is not really enjoying it but rather a binge and surefire way to really break your wallet and mind.

				Bit late for me to read all the replies in here but I will over the weekend cause I&#039;m a bit too fond of the Devil&#039;s Dandruff nowadays myself and thought I would never get to the stage I am now using it.<br /><br />It&#039;s a powerful drug and I can see now how it can make you trick and lie yourself into ways of accessing it.<br /><br />If not already said, download a copy of David Lee&#039;s &quot;Cocaine Handbook&quot;. It&#039;s very expensive to buy but there are illegal scanned copies online to download and it&#039;s a good start for giving up or cutting down

				I&#039;ve seen the signs in some of my friends, buying at &#039;inappropriate&#039; times, talking about it and then really ticking about how much they want some, etc.<br /><br />I think I have a bit of an addictive personality but I spread my drug use across a range of stuff, whatever I feel like at the time and the only thing I use regularly is weed which, let&#039;s face it, is about as nefarious as a box full of kittens.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been sitting around studying and all I can think about is how much better the experience would be if I had a bottle of adderall.

				^^ My reply added as I reached for &quot;the last line&quot; which was already 3 hours ago!<br /><br />Just remembered too chatting to friends and all agreeing that with drink on board, the call is always made for coke or if there are pills available then them too. To give up coke, you need to give up drink to start. Even if just to give the coke a rest for a few weeks ya gotta go on the dry.<br /><br />After that chat with my friends, I then came across a report or study that found that people who take other drugs outside of alcohol tend to seek other drugs once they consume alcohol and the funny thing is, it&#039;s not even being drunk that causes this crave or want but simply the taste of your first drink!<br /><br />I recognized that immediately because I even said to my mate that the second you even open a can of beer, it triggers off the mind thinking of pills or even more so coke.<br /><br />Hard to do mate but give up the booze for a few weeks and see how ya get on! Peace <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah true story, I&#039;m still in uni currently and when the drink starts the drugs are always sure to follow as well. Students with drug problems are definitely in trouble because from my experience when it comes to students the alcohol never stops haha. I like to just not do anything whatsoever every other time, just spend the whole night getting drunk while most others do drugs and make sure I can just say no, not tonight and make it through the night without taking any. <br /><br />But then again, largely due to the money involved and the fact that street level yay is so often bunk stuff if you don&#039;t have a trusted supplier, coke has never been my primary drug of choice. Fucking love it when you get 3 or 4 grams of fish going with some close friends, the kind of shit that just makes you so chatty and buzzing but that&#039;s hard to find where I am and I am not willing to pay the prices on SR.

				Coke was the only I drug I could not stop taking immediately once I found out that it was harming me.<br />I got into coke through my then-boyfriend as it was just the best aphrodisiac for us.

				Would you agree OP you get addicted and excited to getting the lines ready , the straw and just the whole set up process? I find that is one of the most addictive parts.<br /><br />After going through a lot of issues with stimulants and mainly cocaine I have a few rules now<br /><br />1. Only do at night and 99% of the time by myself. Imagine your coke partner ODing and you have to call the ambulance then the Police come and the person dies while doing drugs with you? DON&#039;T TAKE THAT RISK.<br />2. Do not tell anyone you take it , lock away your phone etc so you don&#039;t call people high<br />3. If you get a 8 ball of good stuff , rebag it so you do a certain amount at a time<br /><br />I now would never do it when any one is around due to the law and people close to me know about my past and they know when you are high. Self control dude , max 3 nights a week to. Better for finances , better for health and all general all around a better high.

When doing coke, are there some best practice things to do with it to minimize damage and unwanted effects? <br /><br />Any insights into any of the above from those with some experience would be really well appreciated!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I got to where anytime I went out, called the blow guy and got a ball.&nbsp; Every weekend, got a ball.&nbsp; It went on for years and I realized that there was a problem, but then I found a miracle drug called heroin that I used to quit blow.&nbsp; What a miracle.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course the above is sarcasm, but it was the truth.&nbsp; I traded one addiction for another.&nbsp; Finally was able to get out from the grip of both and haven&#039;t touched anything in a while.&nbsp; I still dabble in the occasional recreational substance, but nothing on the regular.&nbsp; It takes getting to the root of the issue...Why do I always want to get fucked up?&nbsp; Most of the time it is some underlying mental issue you need to deal with to finally loosen the grip.&nbsp;

It made us go into all that dirty sex we would not have thought about otherwise.<br />The downfall started when I could not stop by Sunday lunchtime and started doing lines on Monday mornings just to make it into my high profile/high stress job on time without any sleep since the Friday before.<br />The sex also turned for the worse after a while. First we had both growing difficulties to climax and then my BF became a limp dick. And even when I climaxed I did not feel satisfied afterwards.<br />In contrast to all other drugs I lied to myself, saying coke did not impact me negatively.<br />Even when I became problems with my nose from doing too much blow (about 1g/day weekdays and much more on weekends) I only stopped for so long as it took for my nose to hurt anymore.<br />After 2 years I began to feel absolutely empty when not doing coke and finally I became absolutey paranoid as soon as I took another line.<br />All the enhanced sociability and sexuality had given way to solo sessions at home.<br />Realizing that it was about time to stop the most expensive habit I had ever formed it still took me another 2 years with first weekly and then monthly relapses until I was finally able to stop the blow.<br />And it took another 3+ years until I could feel normal human emotions like happiness and love again.<br />My simple advice: Don&#039;t do it as the emotional and monetary cost is just way too much. If this is not enough think about the bad stuff they now use to cut it (Levamisole etc.).<br />SR offers so many other, much better drugs!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good on you connoisseur for finally getting off it!<br /><br />Think you&#039;re right regarding better drugs. MDMA for me is a much nicer drug once used and not abused and ain&#039;t as tough on the pocket!&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1. HitTheRoad Ive noticed the more MDMA/ M1 I do the less I want the blow. Now when i say more im referring to taking MDMA/ M1 once, Max, twice a week. the day of dosing and two days after, the urge to hit up the blow is much less prominent.&nbsp; to me. I dosed on Saturday and havent used the blow since. <br /><br />2. Ive been doing high quality Peruvian flake for years now just about constantly with few breaks. my usual daily intake is about .5g to 1g a day with the occasional binge. some of the normal issues with coke use dont apply to me due to my hobby as a vendor of the product. when I say hobby thats exactly what i mean. its not a way for me to support my family, only to have product around (although the extra cash is good). I do that so I never have to worry about where its coming from or having it affect my family finances. my nose is relatively strong (septum) however just this weekend ive noticed a soreness that ive not had before which is troubling. <br /><br />3. i enjoyed this comment by connoisseur:<br /><br />&quot;And it took another 3+ years until I could feel normal human emotions like happiness and love again.&quot;<br /><br />this is starting to become an issue for me. Im married and my mate is not aware of my habit or hobby. Im pretty good at what i do, ya&#039;know loose lips sink ships.&nbsp; ive noticed an apathy growing towards people i general and has grown to include my mate. I&#039;m afraid that i&#039;ve begun to lose touch with &quot;normal human emotion&quot;. I do believe I may be ending my multi year run soon. I hate the 12 step programs and the whole &quot;higher power&quot; Bullshit. been through that ten plus years ago.<br /><br />4. I love this thread, glad it got dug up from 2+ years ago. also thankful to these forums. its a great environment for discussion. Media and government are so quick to label users as addicted thieves and scum of society. I think some of the real interactions found on these forums prove those organizations wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;
