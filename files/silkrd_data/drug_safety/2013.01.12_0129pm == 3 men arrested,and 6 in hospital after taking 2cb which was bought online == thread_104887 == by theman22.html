				so fellow roaders what is your take on this?i was under the assumption that 2cb is safe under the recommended dosage and myself took it for the first time last weekend and i rather enjoyed it.<br />&nbsp;<br />heres the article:<br /><br />Three men have been arrested after six people needed hospital treatment for taking an illegal hallucinogenic drug.<br /><br />One man remains in a critical condition after the group, aged 19 - 22, fell ill when they took the substance 2CB at a house in the Jesmond area of Newcastle.<br /><br />The emergency services were called to the terraced house in Ripon Gardens early on Friday. Police said the drug was bought on the internet.<br /><br />Two men aged 23 and a 20-year-old have been arrested.<br />Email warning<br /><br />Five people who were treated at Newcastle&#039;s Royal Victoria Infirmary have now been discharged, but a sixth is critically ill, Northumbria Police said.<br /><br />A force spokesman said: &quot;Inquiries to establish exactly what happened continue, with officers warning people about the dangers of taking any illegal drugs, especially those bought over the internet.&quot;<br /><br />Detectives said some of those taken ill were students at Newcastle University.<br /><br />The university has now circulated a warning about 2CB via an email to students.<br /><br />The drug, related to ecstasy, often comes in purple capsules and is also known as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox and Cloud Nine.<br /><br />The Class A substance can also be sold as a white powder or as small pills and is said to be particularly dangerous when mixed with other drugs or alcohol.<br /><br />Link-http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-20997459

				So nobody died then, good.<br /><br />But this is scary. Where on the internet did the drugs come from?<br />Were the dosages pre-measured or did they weigh themselves?<br /><br />What is &#039;critically ill&#039; mean in regards to this story? <br />I understand it to mean &#039;at deaths door&#039;, but could it mean &#039;freaking the fuck out&#039;?

				2CB can easily be imported from China (Who mass produce synthetic drugs), Prohibition caused synthetics to be created!

				thats all i know,they never go into much detail when it comes to people in hospital from drugs its prob to scare us.but yea would love to know where it came from since 90% of the time when people end up in hospital its not actually from the drug but more of the cut just wanting to see if anyone knew any more on this subject because its all quite mad,1st time iv heard of 2cb being mentioned as dangerous.<br /><br />and i dont know if your from the uk jopular but critically ill usually means,death or at deaths door sort of along them lines.

				&quot;If anyone has any of these in their possession we urge them not to take them and hand them in to the police.&nbsp; hahaha! I love this! Cause we all hand our unwated drugs to the police, Yeah cause thats normal! Agree with &#039;The Man&#039; the reason drugs are dangerous is useally because of the substance it has been cut with, being Sugar to Caffine. Something needs to be done about &#039;Fake&#039; drugs, It scares me to think that when I have children this is what they maybe doing or even worse..........<br />I hope its not the road as this isn&#039;t the right type of advertisement for SR, Its not SR its the person!

				Although it has not been researched formally or anything, 2c-b has been used by probably more people than any of the 2c-x drugs, is pretty mainstream these days, and hardly classifies as a research chemical anymore. 2c-b orally at doses over 100mg has been handled fine by people, although it is clearly way too much. Once I went really overboard with sniffing 2c-b, no idea how much I did but it was a lot. I did get quite intense panic and feeling like I was overdosed, but I was totally fine. I don&#039;t think I have ever heard of anyone overdosing and dying from 2c-b, and anecdotal evidence shows that it is still fairly safe even at many times the maximum suggested dose. <br /><br />So I find it likely that the product they had was either<br /><br />a. Not 2c-b<br />b. Cut with other shit, or perhaps not properly synthesized<br />c. Taken at doses much larger than the suggested absolutely maximum of 50mg orally (and much less nasally)

				It most likely wasn&#039;t even 2C-B. It was probably some other chemical that was the problem.<br /><br />Just like the media warns of deaths from &quot;ecstasy.&quot; It is very rare to encounter problems with MDMA. It&#039;s usually PMA or some other chemical combination which causes the problems.<br /><br />Most people would agree that drugs ordered from SR are MUCH, MUCH more pure, consistent and safe than buying street drugs.<br />Authorities are terrified of SR because they can&#039;t stop it, that&#039;s why they are using scare tactics about using the sites.

				It was 2c-i apparently they thought it was 2cb.<br /><br />&quot;Police said the drug was purchased in a white powder form and some of it had been recovered.<br /><br />The recovered substance is believed to be 2CI, a Class A hallucinogenic drug which is chemically related to the better known 2CB that is also referred to as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox, Cloud Nine or Toonies.<br /><br />Both drugs can also be supplied in the form of small pills.<br /><br />Fearing more people may be tempted to try the drug, police have issued an alert to hospitals and partner agencies in the area.<br /><br />Chief Supt Gary Calvert, of Newcastle Area Command, said: “Taking any illegal drug is dangerous and potentially life-threatening and 2CB is an illegal hallucinogenic drug.<br /><br />“If anyone has any of these in their possession we urge them not to take them and hand them in to the police.<br /><br />“Anyone who may have taken the drug and feels unwell should seek medical attention immediately.”<br /><br />Read more: Journal Live http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2013/01/14/jesmond-drugs-case-man-kept-in-hospital-61634-32592045/#ixzz2HxttmWl4<br />&quot;

That could be why PeanutbutterPB is nowhere to be found on SR.<br />The police took their computers and laptops and so might know which vendor it came from. But then again it could all just be coincidence and the drugs could have come from some clearnet site.<br /><br />eta: can find a vendor called Peanutbutter but has not been seen in 3 months.

				That certainly is part of the problem. If these drugs came as legal tablets including a leaflet that specifies dosages for certain effects, such overdose events would be far less likely to occur.<br /><br />Such problems aren&#039;t limited to illicit substances however. People often confuse similar substance names, for example paracetamol and propanolol. While both are perfectly legal, taking a gram dose of propanolol would end rather badly while a gram of paracetamol would be fine. <br /><br />Perhaps it would be a good idea to start supplying information leaflets with illicit drugs sold through SR as well. The information doesn&#039;t have to extensive, but a simple indication of what amount is used in recreational use would be helpful. Especially with substances sold in powder form, doing so could prevent a lot of potential harm. <br /><br />For example, a popular product on SR is a bag of 1 gram of pure xanax. Nothing wrong with that, but whoever receives that bag and uses the drug should realize that it is the equivalent of 500 bars of xanax concentrated into something you could easily swallow in a single go. <br /><br />I&#039;d suggest that on every shipment there should be a declaration of the amount of substance (in total, or per tablet if its in tablet form) and the IUPAC name of the chemical. Using those two pieces of information it would be easy enough to create an online system that provides common dosage, side effects, risks and such for each substance.

				The issue was most likely that the substance was not even 2CB at all, or they mixed it with something else, or they took God knows how much...&nbsp; :(<br /><br />INFORMATION, people! The lack of knowledge is what is really dangerous... most of these events would never happen if John Smith who ordered from Chink Chonk RC Ltd. in China would have taken the time and read up on the stuff he was about to take on Erowid, for instance.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />The other thing is that there are these new generation of people who use psychadelics for &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;to get wasted&quot; but these substances were never intended to use as a party drug or some other shit, these are serious things that should be respected and treated properly.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Someone above posted that police seized their laptops / computers.&nbsp; This is just a waste of police time. If they work out who sold the products, what&#039;d they then? They won&#039;t be able to track down the seller, and it probably wasn&#039;t even the sellers fault the users came into problems.

				This whole thread stinks of idiocy at it&#039;s highest level!&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know what you are putting in your body and how much, and then you run into troubles later, you have no one to blame but yourself.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />Self ownership is a big responsibility to ones self and obviously many aren&#039;t ready for that level of responsibility yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)

I will consider putting that on my MDMA listing when I get more stock in. It would help prevent and accidental overtaking, even though overdosing on 1gm of MDMA wouldn&#039;t be a big problem. It&#039;d still be better to be cautious and warn users, because some people Havre no idea how much they should take. I know a lot of people who simply judge consumption on how much they paid for they paid for the drugs. $100 of street pills will he a lot less MDMA than $100 of MDMA off SR, and users should be aware of this.
