				first off its 1mg is a dose about and you probably bought 2 grams. personally i would put more into a cap than that. without a scale its hard to tell but there is probably less than a 1mg in each cap. i would suggest to dose around .1g or .17 for your first time to get nice full effects and not have it be a mild roll. so take two of them and you should be good. or empty one of those out and snort it if thats what your into, it will smack you right in the face hardd for about 2 hours if you do it that way. best of luck and let me know how it goes.<br /><br />mclovin478910

				hah well didnt know what you were doing i guess, but what type of bar is it? regardless of how much you do you will feel hot so plan on wearing shorts and a t shirt and you should have a problem with body heat and keeping hydrated. <br />No it was not my first time i actually used to sell it locally, flipped 112 gs and called it quits on that hah, im a seasoned roller i guess you could say but i always hate to hear people bash such a good drug and say they didn&#039;t roll.<br />new plan lol snort a tiny line like (.05) before you leave for the bar if you are not driving and take one of the pills you have dosed and you should be set for a good night without bouncing off the walls and getting naked hah.<br /><br />mclovin478910

				I found this image: http://i.imgur.com/lcMUC.jpg<br />My capsules are the exact same size as the -1- ones, and they are all 1/4 full, the MDMA is this: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account/view_transaction/920873f3bd<br />I split 2grams into 20 gel caps as evenly as I could, was that too much?<br /><br />If I pop one and don&#039;t feel anything after X(??) amount of time, should I use another, does it work that way or do I need to take it all at once?<br /><br />Thanks again for all the info friends.<br /><br />I actually made two topics on this in different sections because I wasn&#039;t sure the &quot;rumor mill: MDMA&quot; was the right place to talk about this stuff.

				Normally for these gel caps theres a ridge that kind of locks the cap together, if you loosen it to not be locked over it and pop it as your leaving for the bar it should hit you shortly after you take a drink or if you have some food in your stomach it could take a bit longer but i suggest leaving on a somewhat empty stomach and munch out on your comedown latenight snack style. I would also suggest you put a bit more into the cap if your taking just one so your orally taking about .12-.14 instead of what looks to be somewhere around .07-.1.<br />No problem with the info just sitting in class very bored, glad i could assist.<br /><br />mclovin478910

				so what you&#039;re saying is that I *should* combine the 20 caps into 10 caps? or just blow two at once, or would that be too much? well.. I guess that&#039;s the same thing really. also I know what you mean about the little locking mecanism on the capsules.

				i would redose all the caps and make 15 from your 2gs and each cap should then have .13 in each which would be a good dose to really feel the effects but not be raging. it sounds like alot of work but itll pay off in the end with easy to take and perfectly dosed caps that can be opened to snort. or popped for a milder roll.

				Alright I think i&#039;ll do that, unless anyone has any other insights (i&#039;m in no rush, I won&#039;t be using them until saturday)<br />Which.. brings me to my next question; SHOULD I try one before then? I hear that they really drain your energy and my friend that does them says he can&#039;t handle more than 1 a month so his body adjusts to normal again.

If I had to ship MDMA I would probably crush it quite some bit for better stealth. I imagine using a 20g crystal to be somewhat hard to use also. If it looks like crushed shards and has this very distinct bitter mdma taste, I wouldn&#039;t worry just yet.

				I know you feel your vendor is legitimate, but I&#039;d recommend buying a reagent test kit and testing the product before you start making capsules for others to ingest. I&#039;d also recommend investing in a scale. Unless you have 100% pure MDMA, you&#039;re not going to be having 100mg of only MDMA in your capsules, so doing perhaps 110mg into each capsule would be a better idea, however a reagent test would help in guiding this.<br /><br />Also, your original post says you bought 2mg of MDMA crystals? I believe you mean 2g, for 2 grams. A common dose for MDMA is usually about 100mg or 1/10th of a gram.<br /><br />sdesu<br /><br />

				drNYX&#039;s MDMA is very potent indeed. <br />So if you&#039;re not used to it I would keep the dose low, like you had it, at around 100mg. It will blow your head off. <br /><br />And yeah, get a scale.. :P Doesn&#039;t have to be a 200$ 0.001g scale and all that, a 10$ 0.01 scale will do just fine for dosing MDMA.

Your brain should associate it to the mdma-high and after a couple of times you can tell if its mdma just by licking it. Brain probably gets an instant boner when realizing mdma is coming up.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see any post from Mr.Charlie?! Bug? Feature? :o About dosing, that&#039;s really hard to say since it&#039;s very individual. Erowid usually gets you a hint at dosing for pretty much anything. http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_dose.shtml<br /><br />It is very often stated that the maximum dosage should be 1.5 x your body weight in kg. Our local testing facility lists pills with 120+mg as &quot;strong&quot; and warns if there are 150mg pills as &quot;very high dosed&quot;. Their job is harm reduction, so the take the better safe than sorry approach. But as I said, keep in mind that 100mg of that MDMA you bought might not be real 100mg. So you have to do some guess work anyway. Thats why I don&#039;t like dealing with mdma that much and use pills instead. <br /><br />If I had your mdma and I had no tolerance but still my experience, I&#039;d go with 150mg. I currently weigh like 92-94kg. Your best shot would be to just ask some other users of that vendor or possibly the vendor himself. They can probably give you the best advice regarding dosage.

Quite simple really. <br /><br />Also I would suggest getting smaller caps.. the ones you use are a bit too big, like twice ;D

				I live in the UK so ebay US isn&#039;t really helpful, I bought this scale, how does it look? seemed pretty cheap but the guy has good feedback. <br /><br />http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/261059710451?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649

				any thoughts about these scales? <br /><br />http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/261059710451?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649<br /><br />they only go down to 0.1g but that should be perfect for mdma right? I bought it anyway since it was so cheap, hope it wasn&#039;t a mistake.

				cheap scales are usually the opposite of accurate. Learn to research for your safety and others.<br /><br />you&#039;re lucky you&#039;re fucking with a substance that has a higher threshold but if these were in the sub 100mg dose, you&#039;d be making a big mistake.

				I just need a rough estimate, I don&#039;t care if I have a tiny bit too much or a bit less, just enough to be able to figure out how to dose my pills. I only have 2grams it&#039;s not like i&#039;m starting a re-selling business or anything.

				I would recommend 150 mgs (this is your first time right?).&nbsp; Right inbetween the two other most popular suggestions, and in my experience, and good powerful roll without going over the top.<br /><br />Secondly, definitely DO NOT &quot;try&quot; out your mdma before the event/night you had planned to!<br />The first time is special, don&#039;t waste it at home doing the dishes!

				I&#039;m on an SSRI called Citalopram (40mg), I read around online that it basically nullifies the MDMA effects, and you should stop taking them 3-4 days before rolling on the mdma - anyone know anything about this?<br /><br />( I don&#039;t get any withdrawal effects from the SSRI, it does fuck all for me anyway, hence why I bought some benzos last week )

				I found this on erowid:<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_info9.shtml<br /><br />But it says nothing about how long after taking an SSRI you should wait before rolling, any ideas? some quick google searches says it stays in your body for about 35 hours,

				From what I gather, SSRI medications can have a dramatic effect on whether/how well you roll.&nbsp; I have read various reports of people still not getting full effects even after tapering down and waiting a month or two.&nbsp; I would taper down, give it a few weeks after that, then give the MDMA a good shot.&nbsp; If it turns out you need more to get where you want to be then maybe snort half a point once you&#039;ve come up all the way.&nbsp; That way you can gauge the strength of your first time oral dosage and determine whether you want to boost it.&nbsp; Always make sure you have an empty stomach too.&nbsp; Make sure every factor is perfect because you may be significantly more insensitive to MDMA than people not taking ssri&#039;s.<br /><br />My girlfriend has just come off ssri&#039;s.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to give her an MDMA experience and show her what it&#039;s all about in a few months time!

I won&#039;t be taking any until saturday so i&#039;m really hoping the SSRI gets flushed out of my system by then.. do you think if I take 200mg or a bit more it might have more of an effect?<br />As I said, these SSRIs don&#039;t effect me at all, I don&#039;t even get withdrawal symptoms from them, so hopefully that means they just don&#039;t work on my brain and i&#039;ll be cool..<br /><br />Any other stories guys?
