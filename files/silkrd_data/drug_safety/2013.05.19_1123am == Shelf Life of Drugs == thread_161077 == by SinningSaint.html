				So I&#039;ve always assumed drugs stay potent for eternity. Obviously that&#039;s not true. But I find it pretty hard to find good information on the longevity of each drug even with thorough research. So from personal experience, how long would you say your drugs last? And what are the best methods to store them in?<br />I&#039;m mostly interested in amphetamine sulfate, MDMA (pill form and powder form), and weed (nugs and hash).

				I would love it, if someone could shed some light on amphetamine. I searched the web before to find information about it, but couldn&#039;t find anything reliable - in fact, it was difficult to find any scientific material about the drug at all, though I&#039;m sure it exists. Why is it a paste?!

				Any idea on LSD blotter? SWIM has about 8 hits folded up in tin foil, in a photo album in a box indoors.. Any chance of it still being good after 2 years? (Yes, 2 years, SWIM is seriously this retarded, bear with me).

				It should be ok, how you had it sounds efficient enough to protect from mass degradation, though you may have lost a few mics. Im sure they will be fine. <br /><br />Future reference keep them in the middle of a large, hard cover book. either on the book self, or simply weighted down with something that has some nice weight to it. This method can preserve hits for decades.&nbsp; &nbsp;

So make sure its in an airtight container (sealed with a rubber gasket / o-ring) and not just a plastic baggy.

				Cool. All very interesting &amp; helpful (Y)<br /><br />I heard that NBOMe can last years and years even stored improperly. Haven&#039;t head that about LSD though. Maybe because it&#039;s more expensive not that many people are willing to let it just lay around.

				Phenethylamines last years, tryptamines are more likely to degrade, LSD has to be kept in a vacuum state. That&#039;s all you really need to know.

				Maybe I should mention that I recently ate some dried shrooms (psilocybe semilanceata aka liberty cap) that had been sitting in a zip-lock bag in a drawer for about a year, and they didn&#039;t seem to have degraded at all. Had a fantastic trip.
