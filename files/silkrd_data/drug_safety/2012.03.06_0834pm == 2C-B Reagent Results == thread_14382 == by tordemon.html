				Title: <strong>2C-B Reagent Results</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>tordemon</strong> on <strong>March 06, 2012, 08:34 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				So I was using DanceSafe.org&#039;s ecstasy identification kit to presumptively identify some 2C-B I got quite a while back.<br /><br />Marquis: Turned yellow immediately, and then slowly faded to green for around 20 seconds, and then faded to blue, becoming clear again at about a minute. I took this to be a positive for 2C-B as per the instructions in the kit.<br /><br />Mecke: Turned yellow immediately and stayed that way. I was expecting no reaction, and so this somewhat confused me.<br /><br />Simon: Remained clear except for a small amount of white milk that formed in the center and then escaped as smoke. I did not expect this at all, nor could I find anything about smoke in regards to the Simon reagent.<br /><br />What do ya&#039;ll think? I looked around a fair amount and couldn&#039;t really find anything else to match up with this. I think there&#039;s at least some 2C-B in it, as it came from a trusted source, but why are these unexpected reactions occurring as well?

				The marquis results sound a little odd. My 4 different samples of 2C-B all turn dark olive green then fade out to yellow.<br />How fresh is your marquis?<br /><br />Simon&#039;s reagent is to test for 2° amines, so you&#039;d expect no result from 2C-B. The smokiness was probably a bit of excess HBr reacting with the sodium carbonate in the Simon&#039;s reagent.

I suppose I&#039;ll see how well the other effects match up with what they&#039;re supposed to be. And &lt;5mg was just barely above threshold, but I&#039;ll most certainly be upping the dosage this weekend. =]

				May I ask what is a typical consistency for 2C-B?&nbsp; Have any of you found it to vary much or is it consistent in appearance and structure? <br />I have received a small batch from a US vendor and it is crystalline in appearance and appears to be a small amount for the weight.<br />Is this typical?<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp;

				The HBr is a light, floury, slightly clumpy powder. The HCl, when recrystallised properly, is very fine white needles.

				I&#039;ve only ever seen the HBr available, never came across the HCl for sale before SR.&nbsp; Would there be any reason to seek one of them over the other?&nbsp; I&#039;m not much of a chemist; is the HBr easier to synthesize or something?&nbsp; Or is it just an arbitrary acid choice?
