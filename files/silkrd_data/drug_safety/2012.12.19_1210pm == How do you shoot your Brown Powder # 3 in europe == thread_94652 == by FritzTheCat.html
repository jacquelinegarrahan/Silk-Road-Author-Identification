				heat until it dissolves, try to heat wait heat wait abit to not cause evaporating. why do you use 1,5ml of water ? 0.2-0.4 cc shoul;d be enough.

				Here is a simple guide:<br /><br />1. Put powder in spoon<br />2. Put in enough water (as a minimum you need to completely cover the powder)<br />3. At this stage you have powder in water, but the powder has not yet dissolved<br />4. To dissolve, you add acid - I use citric, so I don&#039;t know how to convert to an equivalent amount of asorbic acid - but the idea is to use as little as possible. Start with adding a pinch.<br />5. Stir<br />6. Begin heating, you will see the powder start to dissolve. If it does not dissolve completely, add in more acid, and heat again until the powder is fully dissolved. You will be able to tell because first of all you&#039;ll see the solution becoming clear and there will also be small bubbles forming at the bottom of your spoon. You don&#039;t need to heat until the solution bubbles (there will be small bubbles at the bottom of your spoon, but the solution itself doesn&#039;t need to bubble). Add just enough heat for the powder to dissolved completely.<br />7. That&#039;s it - now you have a solution.<br />8. Add a piece cotton and draw.<br />9. Have fun.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go crazy on the amount of acid. It&#039;s bad for your veins. Use as little as possible.<br /><br />One more thing - many junkies will tell you that the less water you put in the better the rush, and so to put in as little water as possible. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s such an issue - as long as you&#039;re taking a single hit, the rush will be the same (ie whether you&#039;re taking 100mg for example with 0.5 cc or 0.2cc of water the rush will be the same). In fact, I prefer more dilute shots rather than very concentrated ones. I&#039;d guess they&#039;re easier on the veins too, and easier for it to circulate.<br /><br />Hope this helps. And be safe (use sterile equipment, sterile/bacteriostatic/boiled water, fresh needles and keep the area you use to cook, your hands and the area you are going to inject in clean).<br /><br />HOUSE

				hi, thanks for the helpfull answers!<br /><br />i got the powder soon from &quot;c63amg&quot;.<br />i had already a little bit from him and i used the normal method but i remember i always saw some rest on the bottom of the spoon, like 10 % - 20 % of the powder on the spoon... i couldnt tell if its cut or if i did something wrong...!? i mean the whole process is quite easy. so im confused.<br /><br />and about the heat: in many forums they write its not neccecary good to heat it at all. what you say?<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br />
