				Can anyone help with regard to the storage of different drugs and the effect of potency of hanging onto gear for a length of time, for example if i had a good batch of pills and wanted to keep some over for new year how long should i really keep them before they start to lose strength and where best to store them (dark and dry, refridgerate etc) advice welcome on all pills,acid,coke and k.<br /><br />Thanks.

				There are many threads with excellent posts about this.<br /><br />Your MDMA will lose potency all the time, it&#039;s not a process that gets started months after the synthesis. Nature.<br />Air tight. Freezer is not needed, but can be used. Temperature should be constant. No light! If you use a freezer this will slow down the chemical reactions very much.<br /><br />There is not much more you can do.

But if it&#039;s in pill form you don&#039;t know what else it contains so you can&#039;t really tell if that will affect the longevity of the MDMA.

				Doesn&#039;t everything in nature decay over time? I always thought there are no &quot;infinite materials&quot; and it&#039;s all a circuit.
