				I would like to try some E off of SR. I&#039;ve never done it before and I have a few questions. <br /><br />Is it OK to take it alone for the first time? I don&#039;t know anyone who is interested in dropping it. I&#039;ve done acid and shrooms a few times, but from what I understand E doesn&#039;t cause you to hallucinate.<br /><br />I read on the forums that SSRIs can mute the effects. Is it worth taking if you are on a SSRI? <br /><br /><br />If you have any other advice I would appreciate it. I feel like I should experience E at least once in my lifetime. Thanks!&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />

				I can&#039;t answer the SRRI question, but I have heard that they tend to blunt the effects.&nbsp; MAOI&#039;s and E mixed are a no-no.<br /><br />From someone who started on LSD back in the day and has done plenty of shrooms, you&#039;ll prolly like E if you like those two.&nbsp; E is mellower and not as psychedelic, but a very nice feeling for a nice long time.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re gonna do E for the first time, I certainly suggest that you find someone else to do it with.&nbsp; Its not that doing E alone is scary or frightening...&nbsp; its just lonely.<br /><br />E makes you want to run around and hug and share the moment with those who are also rolling...<br /><br />- Bit<br />

				Its def more fun if you have people with you b/c you will love to talk and be social. But doing it alone can be fun to. For me. I can roll by myself and mix music on my turntables for hours and have a blast all by myself in my own world.

				Nah, I dont think its possible to have a bad trip rolling. Its nothing like a acid trip. Oh and I know a girl that was on some anti-depressants and we both took 2 pills one night and I rolled ok for about 2 hours and she barely felt anything she said. These pills were pretty weak though so im not sure if you just take more you could actually roll or not, but im sure it does somewhat effect a roll.

				the bad trip on E (when doing alone) can be:<br />-You will call everyone you know<br />-You will write on people&#039;s walls in facebook (if you have this poison;)<br />-you will spam forums;)<br /><br />I simply LOVE doing e (mdma) alone. I prepare the music i like, i lie down, listen to music, which sounds AWESOME! I dance a bit by myself (not a dancing person in normal life;). I sit, smoke, and think about my problems (and usually resolve them).<br /><br />But BitShuffle is right - take your girfriend/wife, o a really good friend, and do e together. This (especially with girlfriend/wife) help to talk about issues that you had problems talking sober. <br />Don&#039;t forget to hydrate - have 1.5l or 2l bottle of water - but not to much, I think 2l is the optimal amount. Don&#039;t drink too much (3l+)! Basically most of the deaths from mdma are from dehydration or uber-hydration (that&#039;s a scientific word for it;).&nbsp; (sorry for all this warning/death talk - just want you to be safe).<br /><br />have a lovely trip;)

				There is nothing to be scared of per se, but you shouldn&#039;t do any drug alone the first time in case you have an allergic reaction (very rare with MDMA).<br /><br />You should also consider the fact that seratonin depletion is not a good idea for those already on SSRIs. You might find the week after a little more challenging and might not be doing yourself any favours in the long term. <br /><br />Aside from that,&nbsp; MDMA is the most fun you&#039;re ever likely to have on a superficial level.&nbsp; Mmmmmm&nbsp; &nbsp;MDMA.

				My first time I got kicked out of the club doing bumps of K, so I was in the car by myself when I peaked. It was amazing, I had insight into some seriously troubling things from my past. I was suffering from PTSD and severe depression at the time and seriously that hour or so in the car changed my life. After that night I read up on E and it was actually used by therapists to treat PTSD and used in therapy sessions before it was outlawed. It&#039;s total BS the government can outlaw this stuff. I truly believe people suffering from emotional trauma are being denied something that could really help them heal. But it&#039;s not patented by any of the major big pharma companies with lobbyists so they lock you up for having this banned substance. <br /><br />That being said you really would enjoy it more with friends. Even in my situation I was around some great friends in a club, and only out in the car for a little over an hour before they realized and came out of the club. It worked out great in my situation, that tmie alone really opened my eyes and changed my perspective on life. But doing E with somebody you are friends with is an experience like none other. You will become so much closer and it&#039;s like talking to the other person gets you higher, happier. And the first time is always the best, so don&#039;t waste your first time by yourself the entire night. Find a friend and get two pills off SR, you won&#039;t regret it.

				I&#039;ve taken it with SSRI and don&#039;t think it has much effect. I did read once that taking SSRI the day after helps eliminate any negative health effects in the brain. Not sure how true that is. <br /><br />But you get high off your own serotonin. MDMA just tells your brain to release all your seratonin at once. So the next day you have less seratonin so I guess an SSRI would help your brain recuperate. I don&#039;t think the SSRI would stop you from getting high off MDMA, it&#039;s almost like it would have the opposite effect and increase it. When I started E I was on tricliclic or whatever anti depressants not SSRI. I was on effexor years ago though and didn&#039;t notice any difference when taking E, didn&#039;t seem to increase or decrease the effect. The pills also weren&#039;t that great then either so who knows. <br /><br />But I did read taking one after MDMA was supposed to be good and get rid of the &quot;blues&quot; some people get after rolling on E. I never got those blues, I alwasy felt great for days afterwards my mood would just be so much better after dropping an E. But most of my friends would be all lazy and just wanted to sit around and smoke pot the next day, so Im guessing that was the &quot;blues&quot; I&#039;ve read about. <br /><br />Just saw this thread here on the same subject as the SSRI and how it helps replenish your serotonin&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=10.0

				Take MDMA over pressed pills in you are getting it from SR and if you don&#039;t have scales there are several MDMA vendors selling sample/dose size amounts to try, I&#039;d get AT LEAST 3 SAMPLES BECAUSE YOU WILL WANT TO TRY IT AGAIN AFTER YOUR FIRST TIME! :D <br />SSRI&#039;s stay off them for 3-4 days before you take your MDMA.<br />I take it by myself all the time, you will learn to love yourself in the process and there&#039;s nothing scary about it.<br />You might get a little nervous your first time but you&#039;ll soon have no fear at all. :D

				Do it man. E is the best time you will ever have the first time you do it. Find yourself a girl that isn&#039;t nuts and do it up! OR even a good mate if no girls want to party.

				Can anyone vouch for the information at http://dancesafe.org/drug-information/ecstasy-slideshow ?<br /><br />It explains the effect MDMA has on the brain with nice little pictures, and has suggestions as to its interactions with SSRI&#039;s and MAOIs.<br /><br />I found it very informative but it may be more inaccurate than it looks.

				i would highly recommend dropping with other people, theres a chance you&#039;ll feel the need to call some friends or maybe family if your solo hehe<br /><br />and for the record you can have a bad e trip, my girlfriend at the time got really anxious and paranoid and hated it. the bix were reagent tested, seemed clean and not super strong but not bad<br />but she was reasonably drug inexperienced and had minor anxiety issues anyway

				@ c4ndym4n - Thanks for the link. The important part for me is:<br /><br />&quot;Prozac has a greater affinity for the reuptake trasnporter than MDMA and serotonin both. Most people on Prozac don&#039;t feel much when they take ecstasy, because the ecstasy cannot get into the serotonin axon terminal in order to release the serotonin. The ecstasy does cause some dopamine release, as well as norepinephrine, so the user will feel a little something. But the primary effects will be largely inhibited.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				If you are on an SSRI don&#039;t even bother. It&#039;s not dangerous but NOTHING (barely anything) will happen. For best effect you need to wait at least 5 half-lives after you stop taking the drug (prozac = 5 weeks, celexa = 15 days)

				I was on Lexapro for a while, and I can say that my taste for X was greatly diminished while I was on it.&nbsp; I still enjoyed it, but.....not even close to what it was before.&nbsp; &nbsp;It also took longer than a few weeks to return to normal after cessation of SSRI therapy.&nbsp; &nbsp;It took MONTHS for me to enjoy anything again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess it has something to do with serotonin production returning to normal.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have heard that there are supplements that help normal serotonin production resume.&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it 5HTP?&nbsp; (someone please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) It might be a good idea to check into this, see if it helps the roll!

				I&#039;ve heard 5HTP is good to take the day after you roll to help replenish serotonin. Vitamin B6 is needed for it to work well. I&#039;ve read it&#039;s not good to take the day of the roll. Some people take it a couple days before to preload. It might help when quitting SSRI&#039;s too.<br /><br />Another supplement I&#039;ve read about is tyrosine. It is a precursor to dopamine and epinephrine and could reduce the withdrawal from stimulants. I&#039;m going to buy some to try it out.<br /><br />

Go strong your first roll, 150-200 if you are around 200LBS. If really feeling it re-dose at around 40% of that 2.5 hours after your first done.<br /><br />You will not regret it. <br /><br />MDA is also fun if you are just kicking off with rolling, but have someone around for that. You can get some strange (but absolutely not scary) hallucinations. Talking to friends that aren&#039;t there, or talking to an inanimate object and actually holding a conversation until someone around you snaps you back to reality. This is probably only at extremely high doses though. <br /><br />If you buy E off the street be wary and check www.pillreports.com first. Many pills floating around america are not what they seem, and some are cut with PMA which can be very dangerous and overheat you at high doses. <br /><br />Also as others have said if you are taking, or have taken recently an SSRI, do not take ecstasy. Google this, because it&#039;s too long to compress in a short message.
