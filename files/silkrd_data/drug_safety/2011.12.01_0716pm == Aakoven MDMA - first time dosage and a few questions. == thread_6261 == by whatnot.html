				Hey everyone!&nbsp; I am new to MDMA and this will be my first time officially rolling this weekend.&nbsp; I have experience with mephedrone, methylone, 2ci &amp; 2ct2, but i have never had a chance to try MDMA so I have a few questions that I hope yall can assist me with.<br /><br />First, I have read that the average dosage for mdma is 120mg, but is 120mg of Aakoven&#039;s mdma good for first timers?&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, i want the roll to last as long as possible so, from what I&#039;ve read, I should do a booster at about the hour mark?&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; What would be a good booster amount?<br /><br />Second, I&#039;ve read the come up can be harsh, but can I assume the come up is similar to other research chemicals like mephedrone or 2ci?<br /><br />Third, I&#039;ve read that some MDMA &quot;floors&quot; people... what exactly does that mean?&nbsp; I was under the impression that it gave tons of energy.&nbsp; If not, can I drink a redbull or drink a 5 hour energy with it?<br /><br />Last, I am confused with the hangover for mdma.. I have read that some people feel crappy the next day, but then I&#039;ve read that you dont get the hangover for a few days after the roll (suicide tuesdays)??<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a newbie so please be gentle.&nbsp; Any help is GREATLY appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks tons!

				I&#039;d go for the magic 125mg. This is a perfect roll, and after having many many MDMA experiences from the MDMA on SR, I think 125mg is a guaranteed good time. Any more than this and you may vomit on the come-up. However, higher amounts to lead to a more intense experience, and if that&#039;s what you&#039;re after it could be worth getting through the nausea of 150-180mg.<br /><br />The come-up can be a little intense, especially your first time. if you have experience with those other chems, I think you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />MDMA floors people when you take higher doses. essentially, you just feel too damn good to do anything but sit there and touch yourself/others. It isn&#039;t an unaware experience, it&#039;s very lucid and aware though. You probably won&#039;t want to take a redbull or other energy drink if you take this much MDMA, it&#039;ll probably just make you uncomfortable.<br /><br />The hangover differs from batch to batch I think, and from my experience it only makes you &#039;sort-of&#039; depressed the next day, sometimes I cry for no reason, it&#039;s weird, just get lots of sleep, some benzos, and some weed and you&#039;ll be fine. :)<br /><br />Good luck! MDMA has changed my life, remember to spread rolls out at least 3 weeks apart.

				I know a rule about dosing MDMA- 1,5mg per kg body weight is the highest dosage you should take for the beginning. Every mg more don&#039;t boost the nice effects, but the bad side effects. If you are don&#039;t start with to much mg&#039;s for the beginning it can be a real good time for sure.&nbsp; <br />;) ;D

				I have done E for years (4-6/year for ~13 years).&nbsp; I did 150mg of AA&#039;s and felt it was a bit much.&nbsp; A couple of months later I decided to try a lower dose of 100mg and was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; Did repeat with 100mg at about 2-3 hours for 6 hours of a amazing roll.

				I did 125 of AA&#039;s a couple of weeks ago and felt that anymore would be a waste. I&#039;m a big guy (220) and that dose seemed perfect.<br />Just wanted to add I don&#039;t pre/post load and I felt great the next day. For me I think the trick is plenty of slepp and space out your rolls 3wks to a month apart.<br />Anyway, that&#039;s how it was for me.<br />For a first timer and you may want to consider 100mg with a small booster a little later.

				I took some of Aakoven&#039;s MD last night- I only do it once a month to keep the magic, 140mg was a perfect dose but I was definitely pinned to the spot for 45 mins at the peak, lots of wobbly eyes and a sore jaw today! <br />A good starter dose which I give to newbie friends and my partner is 100mg with a 40mg booster at 2 hours to lengthen the plateau. Insufflating the booster dose seems to make the plateau more intense, orally it is a lot smoother.<br /><br />whatnot- report back and tell us how it was, if you haven&#039;t yet done it, just remember that first-timers often get to the one hour point and say &#039;this is rubbish, I don&#039;t feel a thing&#039; then boom! you&#039;re away. dont redose until at least 90 min. enjoy&nbsp; :)

				caffeine_me- yeah it was but I gave it a quick ether/acetone wash to get rid of the orange crap and spicy smell. 1g cleaned up to 830mg of lovely white sparkles.<br />

				For a first timer I would recommend 125mg (assuming near purity), with a possible 50mg redose 1 hour in. Make sure you convince yourself beforehand that you won&#039;t do more than whatever amount you predetermine, because first timers are often so blown away they want to keep taking more and more (personally I took 4-5 pills the first time I rolled, which is excessive and I regret). <br /><br />Also if you are worried about not having enough energy (if you&#039;re going to be partying/dancing), it would be perfectly safe and appropriate to drink a 8.5oz Redbull (80mg caffeine) with the MDMA. Personally I can dance for hours without stopping on pure MDMA, but I can do the same on cannabis or when sober. Many of my friends are much more &quot;floored&quot; by pure MDMA and just want to cuddle or whatnot.

				I got some of the &quot;orange&quot; (it&#039;s actually more of a light peach color) yesterday. I got it for my wife&#039;s birthday this weekend... it&#039;s a surprise (whether she&#039;s into it, I&#039;ll soon find out.)<br /><br />So last night I had the rare opportunity to see a fav group play at a club. To test it out, I did a very small snort (on the corner if a credit card). Perhaps 30mg? <br /><br />I instantly felt woozy, and wired... this lasted for about 45 minutes until inside the club i had a beer, then it eventually dissipated.<br /><br />&nbsp;I was a little surprised that it made me so wired though. IT makes me hesitant to try it with my wife– the thought of staying up all night wired with my pissed-off wife sounds more like a nightmare than a paradise. :)<br /><br />I am certain AA&#039;s shit is excellent, so I guess it&#039;s one of two things: Either it was too small an amount and I didn&#039;t &quot;break through&quot;, so to speak.<br /><br />Or, even though I stopped taking anti-depressants a couple of weeks ago, perhaps it was still interfering(?)&nbsp; <br /><br />Any thoughts??

				versailles 30mg snorted will not get you high. i wouldn&#039;t recommend snorting mdma, maybe for redosing.. just take 100-200mg orally (150 will be enough for your first experience) and dose up if needed - next time you know how much you need to bomb to have a nice rush;)
