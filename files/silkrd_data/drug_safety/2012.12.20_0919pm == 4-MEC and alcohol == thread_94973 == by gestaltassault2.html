				going to a party tonight...i&#039;m choosing to go with 4-MEC because of its short duration and i may need to drive after...but there will also be alcohol there...is there anything i should know about combining 4-MEC and alcohol? are there serious risks? are there contradictions? do they potentiate each others effects?

				Don&#039;t drink/fly and drive, please. Really not worth it...<br /><br />But I haven&#039;t tried this personally but alcohol mixed with 4MMC is quite nice, it seems to extend and potent the effects slightly. :)

				i don&#039;t drink and drive...i moderate my doses for everything i take and i make sure i have enough time to return to baseline before getting behind the wheel...that&#039;s why i asked if they potentiate each other cuz i don&#039;t wanna be intoxicated longer than expected...

				If the 4-MEC dilates or fucks up your pupils and you get pulled over, then go ahead and bend over for the cop.<br /><br />I love going out while fucked up, but it just isn&#039;t worth the risk.&nbsp; If I want to go out that bad while fucked up then I&#039;ll have to get a cab, as much as I hate paying cab drivers all that money since I&#039;m a good way away.

				i ended up not drinking...i didn&#039;t feel the need to...however i did smoke some weed with the 4-MEC and i must say it felt phenomenal...<br /><br />100mg of 4-MEC was quite interesting...it&#039;s like MDMA without the dizziness...its short duration makes it ideal for clubs and parties that close after a few hours...i was completely back to baseline within 4 hours...the initial rush of euphoria is fairly intense...the peak lasts for about an hour at which point you feel a noticeable drop in intensity...like it just drops to half strength all of a sudden...this is when i felt the urge to re-dose that i&#039;ve read about in other trip reports...
