				Hey I know about the mainstream stuff&nbsp; like dmt, shrooms, salvia, lsd, mdma and mescaline but what&#039;s the deal with all the other weird-named ones offered? If it&#039;s possible, please fill me in with as much details as you know about them as possible. A lot of the alternative(well that&#039;s what I call em) stuff seems to be very low priced and I&#039;m in interested in experimenting with some of them. <br />I&#039;m very cautious with doing drugs and I like to know what exactly is going in my system, chemical-wise, affects on my body/mind wise, etc.<br /><br />Thank You in advance to whoever responds to this.

				Google: &quot;&lt;chemical name&gt; erowid&quot; and you will usually get a lot information about whatever drug you searched for.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* You can&#039;t really be sure that what you bought is what you got, start at very very low doses to make sure it&#039;s not something much more potent than what you bought.<br />* Long term effects &amp; chance for &quot;odd&quot; reactions with the drug are usually not known.

				The book PiHKAL and TiHKAL should be able to answer any question you have.<br />PiHKAL: http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml<br />TiHKAL: http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal.shtml<br /><br />You&#039;ll find things like the 2c family in PiHKAL, and things like MDMA or DMT in TiHKAL.

				I kinda trust your guys&#039; advice on this forum, so if anyone has any experiences they&#039;d like to share with me I&#039;d appreciate it.<br />I&#039;m not too concerned with taking these drugs but I HATE stimulants, so my main concern is not taking something that will get my heart rate going(I took bad xtc a couple weeks ago that was definitely like 80% amphetamine or some sort of strong speed which put me into a 2 hour panic attack, not trying to do that again :P !<br /><br />Oh yeah and regarding that, is MDMA known to stimulate you like crazy? Or is my theory right and it really was cut with some nasty speed product.

				anseladams didn&#039;t really list what drugs are in which of Shulgin&#039;s books correctly, but many of the popular psychedelics come from those books. Many of the psychs are also rather stimulating in their own right, and so that might be something to be careful of; when I took 2ci the first time, I couldn&#039;t sleep for 4 days. That was mainly because I snorted it, though. Erowid will have lots of information that you&#039;re interested in, and I&#039;ll also note that you can get a lot of Shulgin&#039;s chemicals less expensively on the clearnet. =P

				go have your fun experimenting with all the &quot;alphabet soup&quot; psychedelics, but I chalk it up to reckless drug use rather than psychedelic exploration.&nbsp; I spent a year or two trying a bunch that were available to me in the mid 00&#039;s but they all pale in comparison to the real deal.&nbsp; <br /><br />basically, if you want to get your list of drugs you&#039;ve done up much higher, then go for it.&nbsp; but if you want meaningful and magical psychedelic experiences, stick with lsd, mushrooms, salvia, dmt, etc

				I chalk it up to reckless drug use as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br />I&#039;ve had my experience of shrooms, salvia and lsd.<br />And you&#039;re right, I am trying to put more psychedelic experiences under my belt.

In which case just because erowid states some drugs aren&#039;t as bad as they&#039;re made out to be doesn&#039;t mean its pro drug, it states plenty of information about drugs, positive effects, negative effects, neutral, addictive potential etc. Its true that not all facts are known about drugs but there are plenty of tests and studies to back the information on erowid making a lot of it valid or close to valid. Its not like they just state stuff they heard in a documentary and act like its legit, they have legitimate scientific studies backing them. What other site tells you the closet thing to the truth? certainly not Dea or NIDA. And i don&#039;t know anyone that would buy from the dispensary and sell here thats fucking stupid, most dispensaries are more expensive than street value and they wouldn&#039;t be making any, or close to nothing from doing that.(at least the ones i know of, i could be wrong though)
