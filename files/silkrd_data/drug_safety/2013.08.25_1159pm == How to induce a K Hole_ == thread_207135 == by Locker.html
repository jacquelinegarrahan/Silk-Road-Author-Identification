				Hi,<br />So I&#039;ve just ordered .5g of Ketamine, and really want to find out what a K hole is like.<br />I have never done K before so I don&#039;t quite know what to expect but I really want to experience a K Hole.<br />How much do I need to take for a 220lb individual? Are there any practices/techniques to increase my chances of going into a K hole?<br /><br />Any help would be great, I am planning on taking on the night of arrival,<br />Locker.

				I&#039;d grind it up and make a 200 mg line and a 100 mg line. Bang the 200 wait a couple of minutes and take as much of the 2nd line as needed. Also lie down after you finish the 2nd dose and play some of your favorite music.<br /><br />Have fun.

				Congratulations! You&#039;ve made an awful decision by purchasing a substance whose effects are absolutely horrible at every possible dose, yet despite this you will be unable to stop sniffing it until you&#039;ve finished it all in 2-3 days. Kudos!<br /><br />If you really wish to reach the k hole, sniff 100mg and give yourself 5-10 minutes. If you don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re floating in outer space yet, sniff 50mg more. Keep doing this until you&#039;re there; though chances are, right as you&#039;re sniffing your last line you&#039;ll suddenly realize that you&#039;re in the k hole as you&#039;re doing it.<br /><br />I really do not recommend the experience or ketamine in general, but since you have it you might as well go for it. I don&#039;t find it to be a particularly pleasant sensation, but don&#039;t worry; it&#039;s not &quot;THIS IS AWFUL I&#039;M IN HELL THIS IS SCARY AS FUCK&quot;; it just feels really clinical, sterile, and airy.

				If you have no experience with K, meybe you should do a few bumps to try the effect before you rack up lines and attempt getting into a hole.<br /><br />When you are going to take a bigger amount it will be a good idea to have a sitter with you. After you have snorted enough to get into a hole you will be pretty incapacitated so make sure you are comfortable and will not need to move for a good 30 minutes.<br /><br />IMHO the best way to get a real dissociative and psychedelic experience with Ketamine is intramuscular injection, but you should only think about that after you have plenty of experience snorting it.

				I second the IM injection suggestion.<br />Since I&#039;ve been on the road I&#039;ve gone through 5 or so grams snorting and in the beginning, had some good experiences.&nbsp; Holes perhaps, definitely lilliputian moments.&nbsp; But it gets so tiresome jamming all that shit up your nose and eventually my sinuses just seal off.&nbsp; And yeah it&#039;s compulsive too.&nbsp; Seems like I was getting to the point where when the drip wore off I had to have more.&nbsp; <br />So I got a hold of some needles (3ml / 23ga) and did my first shot in 10 yrs the other night.&nbsp; 100mg dissolved in 1ml of boiled filtered water.&nbsp; Into the thigh, about 30 seconds to administer.&nbsp; Pretty much painless.&nbsp; It comes on slowly for me but induces&nbsp; the most wonderful feeling of relaxation, better than any benzo or opiate I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; Feels like your traveling, thinking, learning a little even, not just getting loaded and drooling on yourself.&nbsp; So I can be content with 2 or 3 of those in an evening instead of half a gram plus up the nose and not really feeling all that content.&nbsp; <br />This has been with Marcel&#039;s S+ ket.&nbsp; I believe he supplies very clean stuff, just from being a ket enthusiast for a decade plus.&nbsp; When he gets racemic back in stock I&#039;ll have to give that a try that too.

(Although I do not have any scales, so have no idea how big these lines are haha).<br />Thank you for your responses, I don&#039;t feel I&#039;m quite ready to start injecting, as I&#039;ve never injected a drug, let alone snorted ketamine, before so I feel I need a bit more experience. But hey, If I end up ordering more I may explore other methods.<br /><br />Also, what music works well when on ketamine? I have no idea and If it&#039;s like what people say it is, I will only really get one chance to choose/change the song. ;D<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Locker.<br />

				Your plans are solid.&nbsp; Yeah, definitely don&#039;t rush into massive lines or go to needles first.&nbsp; Just laying down and relaxing is important...I know sometimes I&#039;ve been up walking around doing stuff when I should have just laid down and floated into the hole.&nbsp; As for ket being a horrible compulsive drug with not much redeeming value, take that with a grain of salt.&nbsp; I recently introduced a friend with a ton of dxm experience to it and they didn&#039;t seem to get it on the first few tries.&nbsp; The first time I think I recommended way too much and they had just vaped a bunch of weed.&nbsp; Ended up sort of paralyzed and lost down on their hands and knees for a good while.&nbsp; But now they dig it.&nbsp; Nice to have at the end of a night after E or acid.<br />Any music you really love should be great.&nbsp; Jagwar Ma album is pretty fucking fantastic!

Then the following night, I am going to take the rest of the 300mg (likely 150mg initial dose, then additional smaller doses later on), stick a bit of psytrance on, and just go with it. <br /><br />One question though; People keep advising me to do a small initial dose, then continue to bump up the dosage until I feel i&#039;ve taken enough. But surely you will get to a point where you are unable to bump another line, but need a bit more to go a little bit deeper? I don&#039;t quite know yet, we&#039;ll have to see. <br /><br />Is 200mg too big for an initial dose?<br />Cheers,<br />Locker.

				I remember the days when I could hole from a 100 or 200 mg line.....I just gave up on K all together (or atleast a good year or 2)<br /><br />point being you may find that you really like this drug and want to do it a lot....but be aware that the tolerance build up fast and takes for ever to go back down.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s not like you&#039;ll OD you just go deeper into a fucking hole where your brain is replaced by something quite alien.&nbsp; .5 = 500mg, so eyeball it into 5 parts.&nbsp; It really doesn&#039;t need to be exact if your goal is to go into a hole.&nbsp; Personally I hated k-holing because it meant I took too much, when I did k I would try to get just far enough to have some out of body type experiences but not feel like I had been transported to the dark side of the moon.<br /><br />

				Split your bag up into 5 lines.&nbsp; Do 1 and see how you feel after the drip is gone.&nbsp; If you like it, do another.&nbsp; The hole is not that complicated to attain.&nbsp; Basically it means you&#039;ve taken enough k to partially anesthetize yourself.&nbsp; Highly doubtful you will barf, never had that sensation even when combining it with nasty stuff like alcohol.<br /><br />Energyimport is right, you really will just give up on it after a while as tolerance builds if you were to continue buying it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only done a handful of im shots and am already tired of the needles, the bruising, and the prep of it all.&nbsp; Time for a tolerance break if I can swing it...&nbsp; Dissociatives are not for everyone, for sure.&nbsp;

				do a 300mg line, if you need more go from there.. if you really want to induce a khole dont piddle around with anything less than that. weighin over 200 lbs you will need more than the average, 200mg most likely wont send you there.<br /><br />good luck

				The first few times I tried it, I didn&#039;t like it, I have had operations, and the dissociative part just reminded me too much of that- it felt too medical. One evening, I had had some valium and I decided to try it again, I fuckin&#039; loved it- the valium sorted out my anxieties and I remember shouting in glee as the ketamine took a hold. I snaffled what was left in the bag, luckily there was only a small bit left, as I threw caution to the wind as I snorted the rest!

Shame on yourselves. <br /><br />Everyone&#039;s opinions are valid and encouraged, but you have no right to go about judging people&#039;s decisions and their desires to explore uncharted territories. This is not the Silk Road way. If he wants to try K then by all means, let him try K! The subject of this thread is &quot;How to induce a K Hole&quot;, not, &quot;Can you help me decide if I should try K?&quot;<br /><br />Following up on dosages (Crush everything as finely as possible):<br /><br />Divide into 10 equal piles. Start with 50mg. Depends on how you feel it, go with 50-100mg after 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; For the 3rd, you want to wait 20-40 minutes. NOTE: each dose is cumulative, so the effect will escalate.<br /><br />Regarding the effects, personally, I enjoy K. I&#039;ve done it a couple dozen times, never completely gone into K-hole, but believe me I have been dissociated to fuck haha. <br />K is definitely not for everyone. Dissociation is a very weird feeling. To many, unpleasant. The mindfuck one gets from a night worth of K-dosing is just straight up crazy and bizarre. But I still enjoy it. I do not know why. I guess the nights were Ive chosen to do it always ended up being epic, one way or another. <br /><br />With K, I like to feel &#039;evil&#039; or I think the best way to describe it is &#039;dark&#039;. For me, the drug has a gloomy, shady, underground feel to it, which, for some reason, I enjoy!<br /><br />I prefer it at a club with some good, slow, deep electro music. It&#039;s amazing for dancing and just getting lost in your head. Thinking the craziest things. Feeling completely odd.<br /><br />But go ahead. Try it. However, I highly encourage you to have a half-strong dose before jumping into K-holing. This approach often results in negative experiences, as the effects, both hallucinatory and physical, can scare some people off. But then again, if this sounds appealing to you, who&#039;s stopping you from going all in :P?

You&#039;ve made an awful decision by purchasing a substance whose effects are absolutely horrible at every possible dose, yet despite this you will be unable to stop sniffing it until you&#039;ve finished it all in 2-3 days. Kudos!<br /><br />If you really wish to reach the k hole, sniff 100mg and give yourself 5-10 minutes. If you don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re floating in outer space yet, sniff 50mg more. Keep doing this until you&#039;re there; though chances are, right as you&#039;re sniffing your last line you&#039;ll suddenly realize that you&#039;re in the k hole as you&#039;re doing it.<br /><br />I really do not recommend the experience or ketamine in general, but since you have it you might as well go for it. I don&#039;t find it to be a particularly pleasant sensation, but don&#039;t worry; it&#039;s not &quot;THIS IS AWFUL I&#039;M IN HELL THIS IS SCARY AS FUCK&quot;; it just feels really clinical, sterile, and airy. You might like it, who knows.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 to you. This is basically the same idea I had when I first tried it, aside from the compulsive redosing. I fucking hated the effects and I have no idea how anyone could enjoy ketamine. I felt like shit, everything appeared farther away/smaller, and I felt really drunk.<br /><br />I was interested in the idea of K-Holing and it sounded fucking amazing when people described it, but I got fairly close to a K-Hole and felt very uncomfortable and didnt want to do anymore of it because of how weird I felt. I went to lay down on my bed then woke up an hour and a half later feeling like only a few minutes had gone by.<br /><br />I still have some of the .5 that I bought several months ago. Its VERY good K from what I take and who I bought it from, but I&#039;m never interested in doing that shit again. Hands down worst drug Ive ever done, worse then Salvia. I&#039;m just going to wait until I meet someone who actually likes this shit and give it to them for free.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />-1 to the both of you. Shame on yourselves. <br /><br />Everyone&#039;s opinions are valid and encouraged, but you have no right to go about judging people&#039;s decisions and their desires to explore uncharted territories. This is not the Silk Road way. If he wants to try K then by all means, let him try K! The subject of this thread is &quot;How to induce a K Hole&quot;, not, &quot;Can you help me decide if I should try K?&quot;<br /><br />Following up on dosages (Crush everything as finely as possible):<br /><br />Divide into 10 equal piles. Start with 50mg. Depends on how you feel it, go with 50-100mg after 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; For the 3rd, you want to wait 20-40 minutes. NOTE: each dose is cumulative, so the effect will escalate.<br /><br />Regarding the effects, personally, I enjoy K. I&#039;ve done it a couple dozen times, never completely gone into K-hole, but believe me I have been dissociated to fuck haha. <br />K is definitely not for everyone. Dissociation is a very weird feeling. To many, unpleasant. The mindfuck one gets from a night worth of K-dosing is just straight up crazy and bizarre. But I still enjoy it. I do not know why. I guess the nights were Ive chosen to do it always ended up being epic, one way or another. <br /><br />With K, I like to feel &#039;evil&#039; or I think the best way to describe it is &#039;dark&#039;. For me, the drug has a gloomy, shady, underground feel to it, which, for some reason, I enjoy!<br /><br />I prefer it at a club with some good, slow, deep electro music. It&#039;s amazing for dancing and just getting lost in your head. Thinking the craziest things. Feeling completely odd.<br /><br />But go ahead. Try it. However, I highly encourage you to have a half-strong dose before jumping into K-holing. This approach often results in negative experiences, as the effects, both hallucinatory and physical, can scare some people off. But then again, if this sounds appealing to you, who&#039;s stopping you from going all in :P?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you,<br />I suppose the reason I am doing all of this research Is so that I know exactly what to expect, and I know that I&#039;m not going to die or some shit, and hopefully enjoy the drug. This also stops me having to do several smaller &#039;trips&#039; to get used to the drug, although I will do this once with 100-150mg, I can never really be bothered and am too impatient ;D<br /><br />Anyway, the K still hasn&#039;t arrived and is expected to get here tomorrow, I&#039;ve been throwing up all day so I don&#039;t know if i will try it straight away, my head&#039;s messed up at&nbsp; the minute and I feel like shit but we&#039;ll see :/<br /><br />Thank you everyone,<br />Locker.

Me and zvp have every right to express our thoughts and opinions towards it. My reply wasnt directed at you, or the OP, but rather a response to what zvp said.<br /><br />The OP should just know what hes getting into and that K is not for everyone, simple as that. None of us were making any attacks on users of Ketamine. You don&#039;t need to get snappy about it.

				Also note please try to stay hydrated while using K even in small amount. I have noticed specially with the &quot;lab&quot; K and not stuff you find through a vet or doctors office that it tends to be hard on the kidneys. staying hydrated will help your body pass the crystalline like structure of the chemical through your body with lessor amount of &quot;damage&quot; of course the is mild and rare really only account for heavy uses and big binges but its good to start practicing safety now

				Eyeballing is fine with ketamine, especially if you only have 0.5g<br /><br />Divide into 2, then 2 again and you&#039;ve got pretty accurate 125mg lines right there.<br /><br />Enjoy yourself! It is a long time since I did any ketamine with any real frequency. It&#039;s a powerful drug. I liked it.

				Its quite weird to hear some people bashing k. I mean i understand your opinion, but we all have taste and your taste is just different!<br /><br />Personally i find k to be one of my favorite drugs. I enjoy taking it in a range of doses, from 30mg-150mg. I really enjoy partying on k. But you need to do quite small doses for that because sound can get quite irritating at higher doses. One thing i have to say about k, is its pretty hard to moderate your consumption unless you have a great deal of self control. Id say if you decide you like it, make sure you dont to it too frequently. Its quite addictive, and can cause some major health problems with abuse.<br /><br />Anyways, to your question. Id say if you do 130-140 you will be good. one of my buddies weighs 230 and could k hole off of 140

				Read your trip report, looks like you found your hole hahahahaa!!!!&nbsp; Sucks that you puked though.&nbsp; Guess everyone&#039;s stomach is different.<br />Interesting that k is compulsive even to a first time user with limited quantity...<br /><br />Well file this under the &quot;Don&#039;t do what Donny Don&#039;t Does&quot; category:<br />I reused a 23ga needle for the 5th time to do an IM injection in the deltoid last night...just 120mgs or so.&nbsp; <br />Blood streamed out when I removed the needle and I have a nice bruised sore lump on my arm.&nbsp; And yes I have seen the pictures of what the tip of a needle looks like when you reuse it repeatedly...not pretty.&nbsp; Sure the high was great but my casual IM ketamine days have come to an end.&nbsp; Pretty much broken all the rules of safety and sterility due to just not giving much of a fuck.&nbsp; Only thing up ahead is abscesses and infections. You were asking &quot;can you even inject powdered k?&quot; and the answer is yes but it&#039;s a terrible idea.&nbsp; Especially if you&#039;re a dumbshit like me and just boil some filtered water, dissolve with k in a shotglass, and load a reused syringe with no filter.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stick to snorting it if you&#039;re as lazy as me.&nbsp; It&#039;s still a good high.&nbsp; In fact I think I&#039;ll have a line right now, holiday weekend and all :)

Think about it there&#039;s a massive difference between the two; you are clearly someone who just buys weed and sets this &#039;benchmark&#039; for the cost to weight for all of your substances. Charging £20 for a gram of weed would be inane and would lose you any money you invested. Weed can be grown in massive amounts at a time, easily gaining pounds of the plant to be sold. Then you take into account the dosage; I regularly go through at least 3 grams of weed in a night, a gram to me is thought of as almost just surplus, meaning that value is much less. With Ketamine, a gram of the substance is massively different to weed in every way. The fact that the only way that you are able to gain Ketamine is through theft and importation as a justification for the price to be lower is just naive; In comparison with something that is widely available and grown this creates much more effort in gaining Ketamine, meaning that the price then rises to fill this. The average dosage for Ketamine is about 200/250g, and in most cases it is uncommon that people will redose the same night once they reach their desired dosage, meaning that a gram of Ketamine will probably last 4-5 times longer than a gram of weed, when the price is only 2/3 times as higher is in my opinion somewhat cheap, as nobody is requiring you to buy up to 5 doses at a time. So yes, in context there is a reason why it is more expensive, as you have compared a common half a dose to up to 5 doses of another substance.<br />I am waiting for a friend and have literally nothing to do, so I thought I would correct you. :) lol<br /><br />And yes, the next time I am to try Ketamine I am going to try to aim for a much more spiritual experience and get into the mindset of that, and make sure that the dosage is correct this time.<br /><br />Locker.

				Yeah you are SO RIGHT!<br /><br />Because when I buy K I can use it 10-15 times and it lasts 10-15 time for about an hour.<br />While if I go to the shop and get $30 of weed I get a little less than 3 grams and I can smoke for 1-2 days all the time.<br /><br />So ketamine is definitely cheaper. <br /><br />Think about this and realise how *** you are...<br />And comparing drugs is not smart and I usually buy weed?

				Actually only about 1 out of 3 people who try K will end up enjoying it according to a book on Ketamine I read.&nbsp; It seems some people dig it but most people actually don&#039;t like it.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, K can be extremely psychologically addicting and can cause some very problematic and lasting psychological issues that persist for weeks/months if it&#039;s used too frequently.&nbsp; It&#039;s a dissociative and a lot of people start out using it to explore the weird psychedelic effects but end up dependent with it for escaping their psychological issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;It gets pretty rough on the kidneys and the wallet as tolerance increases very quickly and soon you need 5-10x as much to get the same effects.&nbsp; Of course with a new drug it&#039;s hard to not want to &#039;get to know it&#039; but you need to have a limit and stick to it.&nbsp; After you get to know it,&nbsp; I find the best way to use K is just one or two doses in a session and then waiting a few months or even years before doing it again.&nbsp; It has some therapeutic qualities in this way, hence why I think it demands a lot of respect.

Most of the K trainwrecks I know were anorexic, dehydrated people with halo&#039;s!<br />Anyhow I&#039;ve seen plenty of folk go there and many recover and quit or take a more responsible approach to the drug, this tells me the problem is not with the physical addiction to K but to the K-hole.<br /><br />Have fun, be careful, and know when its time to try something new!

(Sorry I don&#039;t have time to write up a big trip report buy I will quickly go through it)<br />All my life I have never been able to properly be high up in the air and feel comfortable, and never really been one to face it, but during my trip I was, lets say thrown up into the air, almost as if I was on glass platform suspended up in the air, looking down upon the surface. I was forced to accept it, and after what seemed like 30 minutes walking suspended upon this platform I came to the realization that there&#039;s nothing wrong with heights, it is infact beautiful, and whatever happens I am safe and cannot fall.<br /><br />I must have spent a fair while in this place until I finally came back, and felt completely different, I felt as though I wanted to go bungee jumping right away&nbsp; ;D<br />Weird experience to say the least, but I feel that it has permanently cured my fear of heights&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I still have another 150mg left, and I have promised myself that that is the last order of ketamine for a while. I feel as though although I haven&#039;t felt any need to take the drug, with all these warnings I feel that It&#039;s only a matter of time, so tomorrow will be my last ketamine dose for a long time. (Which is fairly small, especially with slight tolerance).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Locker.
