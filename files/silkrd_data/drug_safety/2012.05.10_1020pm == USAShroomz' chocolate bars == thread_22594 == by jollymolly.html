				Just got a bar of USAShroomz&#039;s P. Galindoi chocolates. This will be my first time trying shrooms so how much should I eat? The amount of shrooms in the bar was on the listing but he pulled it since he&#039;s closing shop for a few days so now I have no idea what&#039;s a normal dose.<br /><br />Anyone here ever tried them?

				Did you get the full bar or the sample?<br /><br />If it&#039;s the sample, eat half then half. I heard that will give you an INTENSE +++/++++ trip.<br /><br />If it&#039;s the full bar then I have absolutely no idea. I&#039;m about 90% sure that each piece is 1 gram. So I would assume 3-5 would get you flying? <br /><br />I&#039;m not much of a shrooms guy, so you MAY want to wait til someone who&#039;s a bit more knowledgeable on the subject than I chimes in.

				In both the sample and full bar of P. Galindoi shrooms, each small square is 1 gram.&nbsp; The sample is 4 squares (4 grams) and the full bar is 28 squares (28 grams). I had 2 squares (2 grams) and it was a comfortable and mild trip, probably&nbsp; +/++.&nbsp; It reminded me of a tab of acid (~90mics).&nbsp; If I get the chance to, I&#039;ll experiment with 4 squares (4 grams).<br /><br />For some reason, I really like the sour after taste that follows the chocolate taste. =]

				The sample is NOT 4 grams, it is 2.625. The sample is 1/4 of the whole bars. Eat the entire sample bar, it is meant to be a single dose.<br /><br />Even though it&#039;s only 2.625, it FEELS like 3.5 (an eighth ounce). Enjoy!! These bars are awesome.

				Thanks for the replies. I got the full bar since some friends wanted to try them too. I guess I&#039;ll start off with maybe 3 pieces depending on how the day goes. I&#039;ll post an update on the bars after Saturday.

				I received USAShroomz&#039;s P. Galindoi sample a couple of weeks ago. I ate the whole bar on an empty stomach. It tasted good and the trip was amazing. I would eat the whole thing if I were you, although I had dropped acid&nbsp; a few days before so there may have been some cross tolerance.
