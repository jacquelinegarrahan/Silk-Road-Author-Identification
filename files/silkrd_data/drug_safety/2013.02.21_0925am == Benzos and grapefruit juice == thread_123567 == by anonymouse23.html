				Im sure most of you heard of the studies suggesting grapefruit juice increasing the bioavailability of benzodiazepines.<br />Has anybody actually tried this first hand and can report on the effects?

				from what ive read grapefruit juice works best with benzos:<br />&quot;Not all citrus juices contain narningenin or DHB. For this reason, citrus juices such as orange juice have not been shown to affect this enzyme.<br />Different parts of the grapefruit also contain different amounts of these two substances. The peel of the grapefruit is thought to contain more than any other part of the fruit. It is uncertain if eating a grapefruit will cause the same effects as drinking grapefruit juice.&quot;<br />although they are not sure if it really is narningenin that enhances bioavailability<br /><br />it might be true for other drugs though:<br />&quot;The flavonoid existing in highest concentration in grapefruit juice is naringin, which in humans is metabolised to naringenin. Other flavonoids exist in grapefruit juice in lower concentrations as well. Orange juice does not contain naringin in as high a concentration, instead containing hesperetin. It is sometimes recommended as a substitute. Juice of limes and Seville oranges can also inhibit drug metabolism, however, as can apple juice with some drugs&quot;

				Do you guys think it would work adding 20mg of Diazepam to a Bioflavonoid Complex capsule like this:<br />Clearnet! http://www.swansonvitamins.com/swanson-premium-full-spectrum-citrus-bioflavonoid-complex-250-caps<br />The reviews seem encouraging:<br />&quot; 2 of 20 people found the following review helpful<br />1.0 out of 5 stars Warning! - dangerous interactions with certain prescription medicines, November 10, 2010<br /><br />I did not do enough research before i bought this.<br /><br />Before you buy or use this stuff do a web search on its (and grapefruit juice) interactions with prescription medicines. There are some very potentially dangerous problems that can occur if you take this stuff while you are taking certain prescription medications. This stuff can cause GREATLY increased absorption of certain prescription medicines which is NOT a good thing. You can end up with way too much medicine in your bloodstream. Read the real medical/scientific sites, not the sites where they are trying to sell you supplements.<br /><br />Course if your arent taking any medicines it may not cause any problem.<br /><br />But I have now thrown away the bottle i bought.&quot;
