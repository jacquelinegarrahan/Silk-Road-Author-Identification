				So yesterday I happened to come home around the same time the Entertainment Tonight was on and they were giving the autopsy reports from Whitney Houston&#039;s death. What caught my attention was when they stated to mention cocaine and how she had thin arteries due to chronic abuse.<br />I know of some of the cons of using but honestly this kinda scares me, especially because the artery was in her heart. But what I&#039;m wondering how much use before this starts occurring, and is there a way of fighting that with cardio exercises or supplements? Not a regular user, but I do like to party every couple days out of the month.

				Cocaine itself is cardiotoxic and corrosive to the arteries &amp; shit.<br />I don&#039;t think exercise will help.<br /><br />But rest assured, you don&#039;t have whitney houston&#039;s money... It&#039;s not like you can afford to snort 10+ grams of pure a day :)

				Your right and compared to most people like my friends, I can make a twenty last 3-4 days and a tiener a week and a half.&nbsp; Honestly not really sure why I&#039;m so paranoid about it.

				Cocaine doesn&#039;t directly thin your arteries, that&#039;s due to a side effect of the raised blood pressure, which can be mitigated a little but at the end of the day cocaine is always going to raise your blood pressure. <br /><br />What cocaine does directly do however is cause areas where you have thin arteries to burst. A lot of drugs that raise your blood pressure can do this though too, Adderall has been known to do this, but it&#039;s not like you&#039;re going to be taking nearly enough (twice a month) for this to happen.

				See the Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are really interesting and it makes me wonder if cut could have anything to do with it, or if you just excrete it all.<br />But A tiener is about a gram and a half and usally $50 &amp; a twenty or dub ($20) usally weighs 0.5 grams.

				Yes excuse my ignorance a tiener is 1.8. Although I don&#039;t often weigh it the shit my dude gets is so good that I wouldn&#039;t complain even if it was 1.5.<br />But most of the time he breaks me a chunk off his personal anyway.<br /><br />

				Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to other parts of the body, so you are going to have arteries all around your heart and throughout your body.<br /><br />In regards to your use of cocaine, you are putting yourself in danger, regardless of how much you are using. There is an established connection between cocaine use and myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Numerous mechanisms have been postulated to explain how cocaine contributes to these conditions. Among these, cocaine may lead to MI by causing coronary artery vasoconstriction and accelerated atherosclerosis, and by initiating thrombus formation. Cocaine has also been shown to block K+ channels, increase L-type Ca2+ channel current, and inhibit Na+ influx during depolarization, all possible causes for arrhythmia. Additionally, cocaine use has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure if you conitue to use cocaine.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some references for you:<br /><br />Cocaine activates platelets and increases the formation of circulating platelet containing micro-aggregates in humans<br />http://heart.bmj.com/content/83/6/688.abstract<br /><br />Role of Blood Doping in the Coronary Vasoconstrictor Response to Cocaine<br />http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/92/1/96.abstract<br /><br />Mechanisms responsible for the cardiotoxic effects of cocaine<br />http://www.fasebj.org/content/4/8/2469.full.pdf<br /><br />sdesu

Age and overall health is definitely a factor, in regards to organ function. Obviously, you&#039;d be putting yourself more at risk if you&#039;re combining cocaine and other hepatotoxic drugs like alcohol.<br /><br />sdesu

				You should be realistic about these effects though, for example comparing the effects of moderate cocaine use to that of ingesting a few mugs of coffee a day. Perhaps even compare it to smoking&nbsp; a pack of cigs and drinking a sixpack on a daily basis.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like cocaine dissolves your arteries like sugar cubes in coffee, but its perfectly feasible that the increase in blood pressure could rupture an already present aneurism shortly after use. This goes for other factors like physical strain, stress, caffeine etc as well.
