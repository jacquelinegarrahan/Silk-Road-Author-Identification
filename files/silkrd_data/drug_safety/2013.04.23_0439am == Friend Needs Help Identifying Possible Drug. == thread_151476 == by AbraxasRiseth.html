				I know this might not be the safest thing to do, but a friend has a weird situation. She found a bag on the floor, a little drug bag with some white clear crystals in it. She asked me what I thought it was but I had no idea. I figured my best bet was too ask people on here. Her husband said it must of been dragged in on his shoe or something but I think he&#039;s lying. <br /><br />Clearnet warning. (http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7802/drugsp.png) <br /><br />What do you guys think it is? I&#039;m guessing meth or maybe MDMA but I&#039;ve never actually seen both so I don&#039;t know. Help is appreciated. I told her to look into getting a marquis test to find out. <br /><br />

				Meth maybe... but I don&#039;t think MDMA.<br /><br />Could be some reagent or something a chemistry student smuggled out of class for all you know.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I wouldn&#039;t be trying to get high off it.

				Don&#039;t know man. It&#039;s impossible to tell just by sight. <br />I wouldn&#039;t touch it without a marquis test.

				If I had to guess from the looks of it, METH.. could be anything though. Also considering, that any one with a bag of ice, would not likely lose, or forget about that, or let it go to waste in anyway. <br /><br />Get a few nik tests. Only way to tell for sure.

				Oh yeah, she doesn&#039;t do drugs except for weed occasionally. Definitely no plans on using it. She&#039;s just trying to identify what it is to see if her husband has a secret drug problem. I&#039;m pretty much cool with all drugs not meth. It just seems to do way more damage to people.&nbsp; :&#039;( And they&#039;re struggling financially with a baby to worry about, getting hooked on meth is a bad idea.

				Looks like meth to me as well. If the husband keeps claiming it&#039;s not his, he won&#039;t mind doing a drug test, will he?&nbsp; ;)

				looks like meth but who knows.. meth has distinct smell. if IT IS meth it&#039;s very small amount no more than 0.1 could do it in one shot and get a decent buzz..

				it sure looks like meth to me, but like everyone else said, it&#039;s nearly impossible to tell with just a picture.

				It could also be silica gel, hehe..<br /><br />And 100mg of meth, thats decent anyway, will send more than most directly to the floor, with their lysol and scrub brush for the better half of an entire day,LOL
