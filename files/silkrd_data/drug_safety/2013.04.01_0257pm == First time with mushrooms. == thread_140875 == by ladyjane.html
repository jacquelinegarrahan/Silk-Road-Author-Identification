				I’m using mushrooms for the first time soon and would love some advice on how to make sure I have a good time. I’ve got a friend who’ll be close by if things go bad but otherwise Im going to take them on my own. I want to have a happy but introspective / deep trip. Ive been feeling lately like life is a bit meaningless (im an atheist), and am hoping to get a lot of inspiration out of this and find some answers or peace of mind, and connect a bit more with my surroundings.<br />&nbsp; <br />Any advice would be appreciated :)<br />

				I highly recommend taking it outside in an isolated natural setting if that&#039;s possible and the weather is good enough. A place to explore can be the greatest thing while tripping. If you can get to a place like that with a beautiful view, do it.<br /><br />If not, take in a comfortable setting and have some good music lined up. Have fun!

				^^ I like what oldcactushand said.<br /><br />Set and setting are key when tripping.<br />Music is necessary.<br /><br />Just make sure you have plenty of time to not to do anything, besides trip.<br />Good vibes go a long way when you&#039;re tripping.<br /><br />Just try not fight or resist it. Go with the flow and you&#039;ll have a kick ass time.

				Out of curiosity and maybe being able to give you a bit more perspective on this, what mushroom are you trying and what amount? ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND, this is not permanent and will wear off within hours lol.. Loud noises/ chaotic environment/ strange people around could very well strike fear into you. So, try to keep the setting as tranquil as possible. Also, you may want to give your friend some compensation for dealing with someone on shrooms while they are sober. New shroomers can be a handful lol&nbsp; 8)

				mj is a nice catalyst for shrooms if you have some handy. Nature is good. Shrooms can play interpersonal havoc so make sure you like your sitter a lot; if there&#039;s any tension there, maybe try to have them nearby but not actually present. If you do go exploring, take the sitter, and avoid sober people. Ensure that you&#039;re not going to have to worry about your safety whatsoever.<br /><br />For the first-time shroomer, be aware that thought loops are very common. Try to not get anxious about them. You may find yourself puzzling over something you&#039;ve already thought about several times, and subsequently lost track. Take it easy. Nothing needs to be solved. Just go with the flow.
