				I rolled for my first time tonight, and it&#039;s been 6 hours since the drug fully wore off. I can&#039;t sleep at all, I feel really tired, but whenever I try to go to sleep I just can&#039;t. Is this the ecstasy, does it have lasting insomnia effects after you come down?

				Hehe... I think I mentioned in another thread that based on the comeup you had I really wasn&#039;t sure that what you took was just MDMA. Meth is a pretty common addition to MDMA if you didn&#039;t test the drug before you took it and it might have been something all together different too like methalone as well which some people find a bit more stimulating.<br /><br />Most of the time I can sleep pretty good after a nice clean MDMA roll. Not always, but most of the time. I normally take a couple of Tylenol PM and a few melatonin about an hour before I want to crash. With that said, once you eventually do get to sleep you are likely to have some fun there too. Often after MDMA I get the most insanely lucid dreams ever. I&#039;ll be in another full and complete reality for an hour or two, wake up, remember all of it, roll over, and quickly move back into a similar head space. For me, the post MDMA dreams are always interesting.<br /><br />The good news is, if you just lie down in bed, stop thinking for a while, you&#039;ll get some rest eventually most of the time. On roll nights I normally take 4 hours or so of sleep after, get up, do my day and then plan a good long nap for the next afternoon. If you have a boy / girl friend you roll with I find it easier to go to sleep for my 4 hours if they are snuggled up next to me but that&#039;s likely just me.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Some times after xtc pills I cannot sleep properly for weeks afterwards.<br />You should just try smoking loads of weed.<br />Some people like heroin.

				My head is fucked good and propa off pills. <br /><br />They are damn good fun and worth the damage though.<br /><br />But after pills other drugs are needed to function properly in life from then on.<br /><br />Start drinking poppy-pod tea every night to get to sleep. Try booze and weed.<br />This may make you feel groggy in the morning though so perk yourself up with speed, methamphetamine, coke or crack. Or the occasional xtc pill in the morning.

				MDMA changes you for the better man. <br /><br />More is the key to good dreams and the best feeling in the world.<br /><br />The more you do it the easier it gets. Try double doses and just ride with it man.<br /><br />And get some good quality downers. (then uppers for the morning after as well).<br /><br />Any damage that you think you have done will clear in like a few months anyway and then you will feel (be reborn) as if you are a different person. But like with your own sole and memories still.
