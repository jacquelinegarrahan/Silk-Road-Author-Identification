				Ha!. I figured if I did ever have to do it myself as a last resort. I&#039;d take an insane amount of LSD then when I was tired of tripping I&#039;d hit some good H...if couldn&#039;t OD gotta have the 12 gauge nearby. It&#039;d be so messy though.

				I think he means the police would be crawling up his back and he would need a way out, fast.<br /><br />I really have no fucking clue, it is to bad SR does not sell guns so you could just buy 2 big ass shotguns (1 extra as a backup). You wouldn&#039;t have to worry about the cost because you could just take out a loan and not have to worry about it.

				Cyanide is effective but im sure if you could ask a dead old Russian spy, he would say it was a pretty horrible last few seconds. H is a really good idea, never really thought of that one. <br /><br />I would spend a whole lot more time planning this &quot;operation&quot; or whatever your starting up. Some legit planning can be much more effective at avoiding LE. Also i would have an emergency escape plan for your place of residence or while on the road, with said &quot;emergency escape&quot; close by.<br /><br />&nbsp;I know the day LE comes kicking my front door in, they arnt gonna find me curled up foaming out the mouth in my room. I regularly travel with a medium blade and if im running product around or receiving my lovey SR packages i usually carry my 45. Otherwise its laying loaded next to my bed. If killing an Officer isnt really fitting with your plan, i would at least give them one hell of a run.<br />&nbsp;Let those foot pegs scrape the asphalt one last time&nbsp; 8) Anyway, good luck doing your sketchy shit&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Also just use BMR for weapons, only reason i even have a BMR account. That and counterfeit US notes, for some reason no one ever lists good ones here.

				I personally am a fan of cyanide for this type of situation. People say that it is an unpleasant death but this is not true. This is because you lose conciousness almost instantaneously, you don&#039;t even have time to think about it.<br /><br />The way cyanide works is it stops all oxygen from entering your cells, kind of like a full body asphixyation. Just be FUCKING careful with that shit, one sneeze, one contact with bare skin and you could die.<br /><br />This is not a toy.

				Damn I forgot how many of these posts show up...As an aside I think requesting suicide help should be completely inappropriate for the drug safety section and this should be in off topic. Further, I don&#039;t think this should ever be the scenario you go with: but I&#039;m not in your place and all that so...<br /><br />I&#039;ll chime in about heroin. This is my imagined scenario for killing myself should I want to do it: from what I understand it&#039;s the bliss and then you&#039;re gone (or gone enough that the remainder of the process isn&#039;t experienced by you). If you were to go that route and don&#039;t use opiates then I&#039;d say: why spare the expense? Get a quarter gram of some H that you know is high quality and prepare a rig and keep it in a closed container or something where the needle and solution won&#039;t decay. Then you are just a shot away from escape. <br /><br />And I think the cyanide route is just too risky in terms of potential accidental dosing. However, anything that will kill you in moments can only be so unpleasant: in a few seconds you are dead after all. <br /><br />Again, although I don&#039;t know your situation please give serious thought to even preparing for such an eventuality. Having something on-hand makes it easy to give in to a sudden irrational train of thoughts: have a really bad day, bad thoughts, convinced nothing will ever be okay, remember prepped shot, take, die.&nbsp; And the above poster gives a great example of how just because you think your fucked doesn&#039;t mean you are. <br /><br />Ultimately I don&#039;t think you should prepare for this. If there are other alternatives to your living within those means then explore those options! If you just have to take care of yourself you could move someplace new, find cheaper place to live, take up those websites where you can crash at random people&#039;s places, just travel and live cheaply until you find a job option that doesn&#039;t require you to consider a suicidal&nbsp; contingency.<br /><br /><br />Life&#039;s shitty, but there usually remains the possibility of making it better and you clearly have talents and reasons to live that have not yet been exhausted.<br /><br /><br />Apologies for the lengthy rant. Long story made short:<br /><br />Live your life while you got it and find a way to enjoy it while you have it. I promise you&#039;ll die eventually so die after you&#039;ve experienced some more thrills, not after you&#039;ve worked your life into a corner where you feel you can&#039;t escape.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Funny, I&#039;m old now and I dont want to die, when I was young, I got depressed a lot but figured out that a lot of the depression came from plain &#039;ol hangovers. Seriously, hangovers often get me depressed and if you got no other way to get high, and you wanna get high, you&#039;re kind of stuck on alcohol. Give it a try (or stop giving it a try I mean, drinking heavily. Also I&#039;ve found out that anti-depressants don&#039;t &#039;slow&#039; you down in everyday life (other than getting the prescription and paying for it. Practically any doctor will give you anti-depressants if you tell them you&#039;re feeling down and have been for some time. I didn&#039;t like Prozac and I found that they kept me from having sex (couldn&#039;t get a hard on, which was surprising as much as embarrassing, of course the girl thought I didn&#039;t like her, which made me feel bad and I never got another chance at her. Wellbutrin doesn&#039;t do this, and I thought that I was the only one, but if you check up on Bupropion (not the buprenorphin, that&#039;s the subutex or suboxone, NOT that shit!) you will see that it has a reputation with some people with enhancing the sex act. I&#039;m not going to go into detail, but I found this to be true. They also use Wellbutrin as a stop smoking aid, and chemically it&#039;s very close in it&#039;s structure to amphetamine (Wiki it) They have the extended release version that some doctors like (I preferred the instant release but you need to take it 3 times a day if you want to keep the drug level in your bloodstream at about the same amount. The instant release are also quite cheaper. Around 300 mg in getting near the maximum recommended per day, so if they give you 75 mg pills, they&#039;ll probably tell you to take them twice a day (or they did with me &#039;cause I told them I wasn&#039;t interested in taking something 3 times a day) They&#039;d tell you to either use the extended release once a day or the IR 3 times a day In actuality, I&#039;d take 3 -75 mg. (total 225mg) tablets, catch a little buzz, and never take the 4 th pill (I got a bunch lying around now since I&#039;ve been taking it for so long) Anyway the doctor maybe will guess or maybe won&#039;t that not only are you taking the pills for the anti-depressant effects (it really works with me, but everybody is different so your mileage may vary) but for the sexual effects also (which it does have a small reputation for enhancing-and I&#039;m glad that I&#039;m one person that the pills affect in this way. I guess you could run into a puritan/asshole doctor but I bet most doctors know what&#039;s up and approve. The only slightly bad thing is that Wellbutrin may increase your susceptibility to a seizure, but it doesn&#039;t increase you&nbsp; risk a&nbsp; whole lot. Like you might have a risk of 1 in 500 of having a seizure and after taking it, you risk may go up to one in 450, so although it can increase your risk of a seizure it goes down after you&#039;ve been taking them, and it&#039;s only worrisome for people who are at risk for a seizure, not your average person. As a wake up,&nbsp; for a long time I&#039;d wouldn&#039;t drink coffee in the morning anymore (I&#039;m kind of back to half/half coffee a day now. I heard that if caffeine was discovered today it would be scheduled (and hearing what I&#039;ve heard about the DEA and the way they scheduled MDMA I can believe it)<br />I&#039;ve also heard that some people get depressed from smoking dope, but although I&#039;m not smoking it reliably now, I used to never miss my evening joint, so maybe think about that (but THC has such a long half life that it would be difficult to tell immediately if stopping smoking dope helped mood.<br />But I bet that if you (if you drink heavily anyway, I have no idea I just know what works with me) stopped drinking heavily, got some Wellbutrin (bupropion) and gave it some time. (Give it a least a week, I mean you&#039;re gonna be dead a LONG, LONG time ANYWAY, you can wait a week or two right?)<br />Oh yeah, Abraham Lincoln said that poeple usually end up being about as happy as they want to be (and studies have shown that lottery winners after than intitial rush (lasting weeks, months, maybe years-whatever) that people end up roughly as happy afterwards (given similar conditions like comparing apples/apples and oranges/oranges) as they were before. Hard to believe and I haven&#039;t looked into it, just heard it on the radio or in newspaper so not super sure)<br />Oh, and if you don&#039;t like to fiddle around and like shit hella strong, and figure life is too short to fuck around and want about as sure as a thing can be, exercise. 3 times a week minimum, at least 15 minutes per work out day with around 75-85% of maximum heat beat (it depends whether your 18 then you could have your maximum heat beat at the upper end, when you get older it should be a little lower) and with the other 20 minutes working up to your &#039;target heart rate&#039; and after your 15 minutes at targeted heart rate, &#039;cooling down&#039; from you maximum targeted heart rate. You gotta buy a heart rate moniter, it&#039;s like a belt but I goes around your chest, and you have this wristwatch looking thing that the chest moniter beams your heart rate to. There&#039;s nothing but this belt and this wristwatch, no other wires or anything. It&#039;s like about $50 on up to &#039;high falutin&#039; versions, although it might be cheaper now. <br />A doctor with whom I felt some rapport told me that if &#039;they invented exercise today, and tried to advertise it legally as a pill, they wouldn&#039;t be able to advertise all the good effects that exercise gives to your body, it would be illegal! (I hope you understood that, I know what I mean to say sometimes but I&#039;m not sure that I&#039;m putting it clearly)<br /><br />

				Beside shooting yourself in the head cyanide is probably one of the quicker methods of death if you plan to go out but you want a very high dose to make sure it does the job efficiently, otherwise you&#039;ll have a very painful death coughing your lungs up vomiting blood and so forth.<br />The LD50 is a rat is 5-10mg/kg so you want to take that into account to your body weight and X5 it to make sure it does the trick quick and efficient.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made it my plan that when my time is up there are at least 4 other people who wronged me who will be gone before me.<br /><br />Right before you off yourself you should take out some scumbags to at least make the world a better place, even if its just someone like a local pedophile.
