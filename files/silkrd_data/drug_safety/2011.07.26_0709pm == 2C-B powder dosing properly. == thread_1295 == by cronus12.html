				So if one were to locate a gram of 2C-B powder, how would they go about dosing it properly in the 18-20mg range which is the standard dose?&nbsp; Now there are consumer grade scales that say they are able to measure up to 20g in 1mg increments but I somehow doubt the accuracy to be that great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I own one of these such devices and it works great for measuring items that are say 50mg to 150mg typical dose, just not sure on how well it would do for a small quantity like 10-20mg.&nbsp; Sure one could go out and buy a $3000 analytical balance, but most people cannot justify the cost.

				Having just gotten my hands on some 2C-B and only having a cheap American Weight Gemini-20 mg scale, here&#039;s what I did:<br /><br />Put a small container on the scale and hit the tare button and poured in all the power I&#039;d received.&nbsp; Came out to 258mg, a bit over what I was supposed to receive.&nbsp; Win #1 (assuming my scale is at all accurate).&nbsp; From there, I check the weight of the capsules I have to put the 2C-B in.&nbsp; To do that, I remove the small container of powder, put a 10g weight on the scale so I&#039;m measuring around the mid-point of its capability, which I&#039;ve heard is more accurate, and find out that the capsules I have all seem to weight 94-96mg.<br /><br />So, I leave the 10g weight on the scale and tare again with one of the capsules on the scale and proceed to measure out 12 capsules with 20mg each and am left with a bit of powder (either lost some along the way, or the measurements were a bit off) so end up with 12mg in the 14th capsule which I&#039;ll take before taking a full dose, just to make sure I&#039;m not allergic or something :)

				1.Weigh your powder (to make sure it&#039;s really 1 gram).<br />2. Dissolve in a pre-measured volume of liquid (1000ml?)<br />3. Drink 18-20ml of 1mg/ml solution for 18-20mg of 2c-b<br />4. ? ? ?<br />5. Profit

				Previous post is good idea.<br />You can buy 10mg resolution scale in cost range 50$-100$.

				mrroboto&#039;s method is gold. The more doses you weigh at once, the more accurate each dose will be, and measuring liquid to 1ml accuracy or better is easy with an oral syringe (which you might get free at a pharmacy).<br /><br />Vodka will dissolve and preserve most chems. You might have to warm it up and stir it to get everything to dissolve. 1 ml of vodka per 1 mg of powder is easy to remember, but if you want to redose without getting drunk, try a stronger solution.<br /><br />If you dissolve your whole stash and want to store it long term, cover it and keep it cool. Write down the solution strength, especially if it&#039;s not 1 mg/ml. Mark the level of liquid when you put it away, so you can fill it back up to the line if it evaporates and keep the same strength.

				is there any information on the long-term stability of 2C-B in a polar liquid? would it be better suited in a nonpolar liquid?
