				OK, let me slightly rephrase the topic:<br />I definitely KNOW that I am looking for MDMA. The question is: <br /><br />What kind of MDMA?<br /><br />About 10 years ago I got 2 brownish speckled pills labeled with &quot;AP&quot;. This was the first time I ever took MDMA. My supplier told me that they are &quot;laced with LSD&quot;&nbsp; :D<br />At that time I didn´t know how MDMA worked, so I believed him after that experience. Sadly I never got the chance to get any more pills for years to come.<br /><br />The trip itself&nbsp; took more than 6 hours from taking just one pill (other one for my girlfriend). I had this overwhelming feeling of joy and pleasure and love you would expect plus really really strange <br />visual morphings and eye wobbling. So everything just as it should be I suppose. Also it came in waves.<br /><br />Years gone by, I totally forgot about MDMA until I met a new friend in my life about 1 year ago. He gave me 0,2g MDMA crystals which looked like small and rounded drops of amber.<br />I only took 0,1g and it was EXACTLY the same experience as with the pills. (So the LSD lacing IS an urban legend^^)&nbsp; Heck, I even tried to pet some flowers at one point because their shape morphed all the time (it was nighttime) and it <br />looked exactly like a sitting cat e few feet away from where I sat...&nbsp; Anyway... Same happened as with the pills, trip lasted around 5-6 hours (ZERO.ONE GRAM!!!) everything morphed, it came in waves yada yada yada...<br /><br />Sadly my friend was&nbsp; never&nbsp; able to get his hands on another batch...<br /><br />So this is the reason why I came to SR about 8 months ago.<br /><br />Since then I tried MDMA from 5 different vendors and it was NOWHERE near the experience I expected. I know about resistance and had at least 4 weeks between the different batches.<br />Every single one (even the very first with a long break of several months since my last experience) was just a disappointment. <br />I bombed 0,2g every try and all I got was a slight smile on my face and minimal brighter colors and &quot;sharper&quot; sound. Lasted maybe 2-3 hours and that´s it. No eye wobbling, no morphing, no waves, no love... <br /><br />So... Could someone who had the same experience, as described with the pills and the amber, tell me, if these experiences should be the norm or if I just got extremely lucky?&nbsp; I believe there are IMMENSE distinctions in terms of quality and EVERY SINGLE VENDOR I TRIED seems to offer the lowest quality possible... I have to admit, I never paid more than 30 Euro per gram, browsing SR for a while before each purchase this seemed to be the average price.<br /><br />If I invest more than that, can I expect to get the experience I am looking for? Are there any vendors on SR that have REAL high % MDMA? 2 of my tries offered it at 80%+, one even at 82% LABTESTED. <br /><br />Please, could someone make a recommendation? I have wasted enough money on bullshit material and I don´t want to take MDMA much longer in the hope to MAYBE get a jackpot.<br />I have taken too much for my liking already (never was into chemical drugs) and just want to have that REAL experience with mentioned friend ONE MORE TIME.<br /><br />Crystals or pills doesn´t matter.<br />Oh, and I live in Europeso no US sellers if possible. I don´t really trust customs if I have to order overseas. ::)<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated. Please help me end my quest and close that chapter.<br />

				Its not normal to get hallucinations or morphing on just 0.1 of MDMA, its quite possible that you took MDA instead, especially as you said it lasted between 5/6hrs. <br />But the love, eye wiggles and strong euphoria does come from MDMA, MDMA is considered far more euphoric and slightly more loved up than MDA, just slightly shorter duration and no hallucinations, but yes its possible you didn&#039;t have a quality product. If you want some decent sellers then PM and I can recommend you a few for MDMA as I&#039;ve tried them. <br />But I can recommend you mix both MDA(50mg) + MDMA(100mg) for a beautiful experience, best of both.

				Was up man. I had the same problem waited months between and just never really rolled hard again after the 1st time until....... I bombed 340mg of crystal and rolled my fucking ass of morphing wigles it even felt like is was floating in the air!!! I cant even decribe what an amazing roll that was. Also buy a testing kits mecke. Marquise and simons to make sure you have good gear. Try a higher dose and see what happens. I know everone says 200mg is a lot but I cant roll if its not 300 or more with month between roll empty stomach etc. Good luck bro I might try mda soon as well :)))(

				Thanks MrMolly!<br /><br />So higher dose, eh?<br />I never took more than 200mg because I always thought that would be a waste. And if 0,2 can´t get you rolling why should MORE do? <br />There is only so much serotonine to spend... So I thought wrong on that one.<br />Good to know.<br />

				Yeah based on the description I&#039;m pretty inclined to think you&#039;re looking for MDA not MDMA. Done em both A LOT and MDA is much more visual than MDMA. Nothing wrong with mixing the two as suggested but I would just order a gram of MDA and give that a go on its own. You shouldn&#039;t need 300mg of MDA to get to a good spot, I normally take 200mg MDMA and find 100-120mg of MDA is enough to get the ride going. Only one vendor on the road I know of with MDA powder, ILF, used him a few times and good quick consistent product if you are in the USA at least.

				2C-B may have been in the originals. It complements MDMA well but definately is very visual at 25+mg. Warning slow oral onset so don&#039;t double up. Nice on the downside of an MDMA excursion. Don&#039;t hero dose with this stuff, I find it to not be as fun

				I can exclude 2-CB, I have experience with that.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />To give more details: My second described roll happened at night. I have a forest near my house and was wandering about, headphones plugged in. <br /><br />Morphing is maybe not the right term... <br /><br />When looking at dark places I saw some kind of subtle grid everywhere, just like a layer of chicken wire above all. Shapes and shadows seemed to flicker from left to right a bit, looking at objects far away made their shapes appear like if they are moving and something else. I remember I once stopped and stared at a small trashcan besides the road. I only saw the shape in the dark, and I could have sworn that it was a DOG slowly walking towards me. After some time and the dog still not arriving I walked towards it and about 10 meters away I was finally able to figure out what I was looking at.^^<br />A pole looked like a walking man from the distance and so on. Everything was kinda twitching if I didn´t focus my eyes.<br />Oh, and did I mention, that I stroked some flowers?^^<br /><br />Also, lights where really bright and had auras around them. When I plugged in my earphones lightsources would dance to the beat, rocking from left to right a bit, leaving a trace that was still visible for a few seconds when I closed my eyes. The moment I unplugged my phones the rocking stopped. Fascinating! Like some kind of synesthesia.<br /><br />Also I felt very energetic and walked more than 10 kilometers that night. The whole time I had a really retarded grin and sometimes I started talking to myself. I wasn´t really able to understand what I was saying, as my speech was really fucked up and I slurred quite a bit.<br />It wore off without any problems, no craving, no depression.&nbsp; I was in the same mindset afterwards that I was before. Really relaxed and chilled. <br /><br />Best way to describe the whole situation is &quot;shroomy&quot;, but without everything else shrooms have to offer.<br /><br />Maybe that makes it a little bit clearer. This roll&nbsp; twas NO PILL, it was pure crystals! <br />I don´t know if it is possible to get some other ingredient into that.<br />Oh, and I dissolved it in water (tasted exactly like all the other MDMA I had afterwards), all the tries after that I bombed in capsules. Does bombing maybe lower the effect?<br /><br />So, is this something MDA could do?

				maybe you got problems with purity? most of the mdma is advertized as 80% but i think its mostly not true. <br />lets say what you got is 50% pure. that means if you bomb 100mg you will only be eating 50 mg of mdma. maybe you could up the dosages?
