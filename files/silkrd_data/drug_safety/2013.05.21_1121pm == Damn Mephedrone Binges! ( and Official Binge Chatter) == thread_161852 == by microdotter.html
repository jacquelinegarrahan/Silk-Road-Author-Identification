				Anyway in the world to stop them BEFORE you give up and just swallow or snort all you have left just to get this over with?<br /><br />Second night in a row awake,&nbsp; the good side is that there were no noticeable side effects at all with this Meph (limetless) except for fiending and blocked nose, that are obvious. <br /><br />and quite luckily i managed to function pretty much normal as in going to work (im the boss so its ok), business meetings, taking care of employees, etc... while high. and same with the wife and family.<br /><br />the bad side is that i have other meph orders on transit so im afraid i will not have enough time to rest before the next one lands here.<br /><br />i have about 1g left i just know it will not end before its gone. <br /><br />

				In future keep your gear off site. Out of sight, out of your nose. <br /><br />I love my meph and have only once binged so hard I was up for 2-3 days. Was the walking dead that week. Never gone that crazy again. <br /><br />Like I said... out of sight buddy ol pal!

				Or Buy smaller amounts :)<br /><br /><br />Luckily, i dont know how, about 30 minutes after writing this posts i just felt very tired and fell asleep in a minute,&nbsp; was great,&nbsp; i think that i bombed a pretty large amount about an hour before that (to loose a lot of meph quickly) and it just made me very tired,&nbsp; i will keep that in mind for the future.<br /><br />now after few hours sleep it much better,&nbsp; at least until the big crush hits in a day or so :)

				Word of advice.. be cautious going into work whilst on a binge, so easy to notice the smell of it on people (you know that chemical wastebin kinda smell). I know Limetless&#039; product is on the less smelly side, but still. :)

				Hmm...I&#039;ve never had much issue with meph binges before, but what I experience is that the best highs from meph are the first 6 lines or so. After that, it&#039;s just not as euphoric or enjoyable and the comedowns are harsher. I usually save meph for &quot;special&quot; occasions like sparking some kinky sexytime with a ladyfriend or when I&#039;m out having a few drinks I&#039;ll have a bump or two to enhance things. The magic of meph fades quickly too...I much prefer taking breaks and then having the euphoria slap me in the face haha. <br /><br />Hmm...I&#039;d also suggest trying to plug it. Plugging meph feels FUCKING GREAT and you only have to use a fraction of oral or nasal doses. Worth trying out :)

Just never happening to me with this stuff and i have been doing those damn cathinones for years....<br /><br />Totally weird.

				Lol now im atweekend with my family in an hotel near the beach, night time, started another binge, should be fun spending the time in the sun here while high on wertus meph , even that its not the great batch he had...<br /><br />So, why am i bringing this up in this thread?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Cause this time i took with me only a SMALL amount - one that will not last me for 2 days binge but for a nice night (and maybe some morning...) just a couple of grams, and i left the rest at home so i wont be able to binge to many hours anyway :) guess this is the only way it will work,<br /><br />(It can cause another side effect like doing to often rater than too much but its wayy more heealthy than long binges...)

I prefer it to benzos because it permits deep sleep and you earlier up refreshed they than groggy. Plus its VERY euphoric and a great love drug.<br /><br />15 g?! Holy fuckballs! Lol. Your nose must love you!<br />You&#039;ll like GHB though.&nbsp; It&#039;s an amazing and versatile drug. Its fun on its own, pairs well with stims and MDxx (1-3 g), and great for sleep in high doses (4g).&nbsp; Be sure to read up on it a bit beforehand obviously. The difference between 1 g and 4 g+ is huge.

I often do a line or two for lunch at work, and the amount of work i get done is fucking amazing, but then again i never have been one for binges... I mean i can make a gram stretch out for a couple of days (5-6) when its just me using it.<br /><br />However, it is extremely moreish, so i use an out of sight, out of mind technique.... If i hide my stash at home, I stay out all day, and although i might crave a bump, i cant because i dont have it ( a method i see you have already employed)<br /><br />Also, GBL is fucking brilliant once you want to end a good session - the key is however finding the right dose to knock you out nicely, whilst enjoying a good comeup on it...<br /><br />for instance, i am <br /><br />86/87 kg 5&#039;11 and 1.5 ml of g will put me to sleep in about 40 minutes, after enjoying a nice buzz - 1ml will put me on the dancefloor or in a bed with the boyfriend for some luvvin...<br /><br />What i dont like about benzos are the hangover i get from them - i feel groggy and confuzzled - none of which i get on G, cause i wake up feeling completely refreshed!

				Thats interesting!&nbsp; Cause i dont abuse meph wisely -&nbsp; i do alot and often (i dont smoke weed or do other drugs at all currently)&nbsp; but i do keep a very healthy nutrition so that might help....<br /><br />I have left only with one big rock, wonder when it will be finished...

				Yes, good vendors who cares for their customers and sell good product deserve the respect! You can bet we are going to have more business togather.<br /><br />And for binging&nbsp; - im so used to it by now so i have no problem going to work and function the second day as usuall (and as mentioned here before im also the boss/company owner so i dont really care if anyone notice) if gets to the third day... This is when troubles start and the paranoia and crap - i try to avoid this, about 10 years ago i used to have massive amounts of some other cathinones, i was so messed up that i moved to uk for a couple of years judt to relax and come back clean :)<br /><br />And i totally agree -&nbsp; if you get bad side effects its your body telling you to stop, usually two weeks off fixes everything, its my bad luck that i alwo love meph so much and dont WANT to stop, and so far he has been a friend, not yet an enemy (and i been using all cathinones for over ten years now on and off), when i will feel troubles it will get kicked like many other habits i have kicked before, so we might as well enjoy it while we can :)

				Ohhh regarding those rocks i can tell you that if they could cause some serious health problem i&#039;d be dead by now :)<br /><br />Now seriously, i agree that they are a weird form of cathinone (maybe a chemist could explain that better), but by every non-scientific measure i can take they seem pretty much legit, i mean<br /><br />- typical cathinones smell &amp; taste<br />- typical cathinones effect<br />- typical cathinones side effect and no other surprising side effects.<br /><br />* notice i say cathinones&nbsp; - not 4mmc (same for every other meph around here)<br />bottom line, this product is not bad,&nbsp; still i would love to see some lab results from all the meph vendors here cause the random cathinone party can be dangerous sometime, unfortunately i don&#039;t know even 1 vendor who did that.

				Hey Microdotter, luv your comments. I&#039;m a drone luver but don&#039;t binge as fiendishly as you. Generally stop when the sun rises, have a family also, plus I find the harder I go at it the less the effects the next session following day. But like you, have had a few all-niters then showered and gone straight to work. Problem is I get paranoid about the dilated pupils plus I wear reading glasses while using computer so it magnifies my eyes....of course, wears off after a few hours. But I must say I luve checkin out the chicks at work in this state, they haven&#039;t got a fucken clue but I reckon they get a certain vibe. (maybe with the dilated pupils they think I&#039;m turned on by them, well they&#039;d be right) Seriously, when I travel in the train and I&#039;ve been using drone the night before I reckon&nbsp; I can almost project horny thoughts into their mind. Its weird.<br /><br />Most of the time I though just have a few hits and stay away from massive binges. Before SR a few years back when China was still making was a daily user for more than a year, had the routine perfect. Binged on weekends and and just a few hits weekdays. Worked throughout this whole period, lost about 20kg of weight though, would spend each nights dancing to music with my missus. Must say though, since getting from SR, possibly cos its intermittent, definitely find it hard not to binge. Luv it when all family gone to bed, have a few hits, enjoy that rush and think of the chichks I interacted with that day, projecting sexy thoughts into their mind.....I reckon it works ha ha. Gotta say though, the Lims drone make me extra horny but doesn&#039;t give added staying power like chinese drone did.<br /><br />Currently got sum stuff on the way, Lim and FEUK, after reading various reviews wanted to compare. Tried wertus and was good but had problems with orders arriving. Looking forward to receiving, have been expecting everyday for last week. Fuck hope it arrives by Friday, might try the ass method of administration for something different. Also, must mention I always have quite a few drinks before my first hit. Usually get home 6-7pm, drink till 8.30 and sneak upstairs to a couple of massive lines. Come down stairs get a comfy position on the couch and pretend to watch tv, really letting the rush kick in. Obviously, can&#039;t drink until rush wears off which is ok. Another thing for me is at this stage I&#039;ll often smoke some weed. I find this helps with the urge to re-dose.<br /><br />Also, like you never really had any major side effects. Aside from blocked/sore/runny nose which goes away after a week of abstinence. I like the appetite suppression also, keeps a nice figure for the girls.&nbsp; Anyway, keep snorting my friend!

				The synthesis of Mephedrone was first described over 80 years ago in 1929, so it’s not something ‘new’ that has popped up.<br /><br />The stigma is that mephedrone is definitley neurotoxic. After reading many many forum posts and experience reports, the most common reasons for this belief are:<br /><br />1)It smells funny/is corrosive<br />2)It has a crash/just feels like it<br />3)t looks similar to other chemicals that are neurotoxic. <br /><br />To say that a chemical (or anything) is bad because it appears unattractive is a steriotypeMethcathinone is neurotoxic because it damages dopamine systems. Same reason methamphetamine is neurotoxic. <br /><br />Any experiences mephedrone user knows that methcathinone and methamphetamine feel nothing like mephedrone. They are very different. Mephedrone feels much more like MDMA, but more intense. Obviously, different people feel different things. There is a pretty general consensus that mephedrone is much more like MDMA than meth/cath. I have a suspicion that everyone who says mephedrone is a pure stimulant was actually duped into taking a different chemical. <br /><br />I fully believe that mephedrone works by the same mechanism as MDMA. There us some concern that because of this and the 5HTxx issues that it is bad for your heart. There is probally some truth to this, as I have felt this before as well. Keep in mind the &quot;too fast of a heartbeat&quot; is always in excess of 500mg after my 3rd inteanasal redose of the night.

				Ok,&nbsp; the way i judge the cathinones&nbsp; is a bit different,<br /><br />because all the confusion, i care about 3 things when im being sold with something as 4mmc&nbsp; or whatever cathinone (i really dont care how the dealer calls it - like its always &quot;fishscale coke&quot;&nbsp; &quot;84% mdma&quot; etc...) for cathinones:<br />- it should have the look / smell of cathinones family.

MDMA can be a truly life-changing chemical and experience. When I first started out, I considered it a &quot;trip&quot; like LSD or shrooms. MDMA is just a trip that shows you the world through rose-colored glasses. And this can be lovely for many, but again, it requires a level of investment.<br /><br />4-mmc, on the other hand, is what it is; kinda like cocaine. You do a bump, you feel good. You do a bit more, you feel even better. And there isn&#039;t too much else to it. In general, people like to keep things simple. The drugs that are most abused are the ones that have pretty simple effects (Think of nicotine, for example. Just a short buzz, but people LOVE the stuff). Just my .02 BTC :)

				Yeah this is my point exactly,&nbsp; since i have encountered with so many cathinones and hipes around them over a period of more than 10 years&nbsp; - i have large &quot;comparable base&quot; and from this i dont see MUCH of a difference between the 4MMC you are refereeing to and some of the stuff that being sold today,&nbsp; as like you said - 4MMC is 4MMC, the formula hasnt changed overnight. but the excitment of the new drug and hype did...<br /><br />its fine not to agree with me, i know many will not and its acceptable, but i only compare the bottom line of &quot;how high can you fly&quot;&nbsp; and there are many cases where you can see clearly its as good as it was 3, 5, 10 years ago (in various cathinones)&nbsp; &nbsp;this is how it goes in the drug world,&nbsp; the previous generation was always better :)<br /><br />So what my point?&nbsp; im not chasing memories that been magnified over time, i just set a rate that for me its a great high and i expect that any cathinone i purchase will keep up to this standard,&nbsp; and i can sure tell you my standard isnt low and that there are some fine substances being sold under the &quot;meph&quot; name.<br /><br />Ok Ok,&nbsp; now i will do a few lines and will try to sleep , this binge is too long now :)<br /><br />@ zipstyle&nbsp; -&nbsp; yeah i completely agree with that. i always felt about meph/cathinones that their high is the perfect mix of serotonin-dophamine-andrenaline&nbsp; so you get the best essence of all the stimulants in one drug and thats why its so good (i dont know if its acctually true,&nbsp; i just feel like that)

				Pasted from the PM I sent you:<br /><br />Compared to 4-mmc it&#039;s less in-your-face euphoria and more just a really gradual, spread out euphoria.<br /><br />4-mmc kinda makes you feel like you&#039;re &quot;blowing up&quot;, similar to MDMA but that only lasts about 30 min insufflated. 3-mmc is also somewhat short-lived BUT it&#039;s not as drastic a spike from baseline. As much as I love 4-mmc, it&#039;s difficult to use the drug for anything other than &quot;rolling&quot; (maybe as a cut for &quot;molly&quot; pills) or getting really horny and jacking off or fucking. So that&#039;s why I prefer 3-mmc, because at lower doses it&#039;s quite similar to cocaine without the paranoid side-effects or shitty comedown and at higher doses produces this super lovely euphoria that just has my whole body kinda humming. A really functional feel-good drug. Not for going to work, mind you, but functional in the sense that it&#039;s a good drug to enhance other things like sex or reading or watching a movie because you can focus on those other things rather than having to say &quot;OMG I FEEL SO FUCKING GOOD&quot; every five seconds (as you would on 4-mmc). Also, 3-mmc combines really well with ketamine or GHB or any other downer kinda drug. My favorite is definitely the 3-mmc/ketamine combo. Highly recommended. :)

				Well, that would depend on how the 275mg was consumed. If used once or during a specific set time, I would tend to consider that as daily use. If used throughout the day each day of the week, then I would consider it a binge. Easy comparison: binges are to drugs as chain-smoking is to cigarettes. :)

				Hey Microdotter, good to see you back on the forum. Always liked checking out your posts. It certainly seems to have gone dead on meph scene. Have been indulging in methylone myself lately, been getting from a domestic source . More expensive but guaranteed delivery the next day. Have to admit it&#039;s been fiendish! Doesn&#039;t compare to meph but it&#039;s better than nothing. Hey, hope all goes well with the court case! Cheers.
