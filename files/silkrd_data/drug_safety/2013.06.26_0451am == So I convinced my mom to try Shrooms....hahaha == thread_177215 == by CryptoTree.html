				My parents an I actually have a pretty good relationship, and while they&#039;re fairly conservative in a lot of ways, they&#039;re also kind of hippies in other ways. I was in my last year of college and I told my parents that I had been experimenting with psychadelics, and my reasoning why. <br /><br />The first question my mom asked wasn&#039;t &quot;Oooh deeary me, why have you fucked up your poor widdle brain?&quot;<br /><br />No her first question was &quot;Uhh... what was it like?&quot;<br /><br />See when my mom had me, they doped her up a shit ton with pain killers, and gave her some ergot derived medicine to dilate her cervix. If you don&#039;t know, ergot is related to LSD (in fact LSD was discovered when they were trying to find an alternative to ergot, since it&#039;s also made toxic). She had some crazy ass trip, and thought she was a 14 year old girl in Care Bear land, legit. I probably wasn&#039;t the ergot, probably just all the pain killers, since they don&#039;t give you all that much ergot, but since then she&#039;d been a little curious. Also I guess you could say I was born out of a psychonautic trip. <br /><br />I laid all the risks to her, the reason why I trip, and stuff like that.&nbsp; I finally asked her a couple of weeks ago if she&#039;d be interested in trying it out, she gave me a cautious yes. <br /><br />So I&#039;m curious on people&#039;s feedback how I should handle it. I think I should start her out really low. Like made 1/32nd. Barely active dose, just to demonstrate to her that it&#039;s not the boogie woogie that people make it out to be. Also she&#039;s kind of older (like mid 60s) and has had some health problems in the past, so I wouldn&#039;t want to overload her. She doesn&#039;t even drink by the way. She used to some in the past, but she&#039;s like some kind of elder Straight Edger. <br /><br />Thoughts on other things to look out for etc? When I trip, I usually paint, or listen to music. What should I have her do? Go out into nature seems like a good idea, but being in public would probably add too much anxiety to it for her. The only thing she is really worried about is getting arrested, which isn&#039;t really an issue, but she thinks it is. Any suggestions?<br /><br />Anyone who is of an older age, please chime in. Some people of her generation might be able to give greater insight on this perhaps.

Cap them up into either .1G weighted capsules. <br /><br />Have her eat 3-4 off the bat, wait 20 minutes, eat another, then wait for the on-set. And gradually eat 1-2 more at a time until she&#039;s where she wants to be. <br />I love Shrooms for that reason... it&#039;s one of the few psychedics you can REALLY control on some level for dosing yourself. :)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I actually bought them pre-capped (courtesy of raugara), so that will be good. It&#039;s about .5 per capsule, so I was thinking about giving her 2. I had a newbie friend trip yesterday with me on 4 and he had a craaaazy time. I remember my first time on shrooms was probably my strongest trip ever. I figure start with 2 and maybe go further if she really wants it. <br /><br />But doesn&#039;t cross tolerance get in the way? Whenever I&#039;ve dosed, I&#039;ve dosed all at once, and I&#039;ve found that when I took more after the first dose, the returns were greatly diminished. Thoughts?

				ive tripped with a gf;s mom and then ended up selling to her long after i broke up with said girl. <br />when it comes to shrooms ask yourself cap and stem or just cap? seeing as shrooms are shrooms ea grow is different and no 2 shrooms will ever be the same due to nature. This goes past strain! <br /><br />i suggest for her to eat 1.5g cap and then wait 2 hours. some people are strange and it can creep, 1st time i took shrooms i took 2g cap of what i grew and it took me a hour for it to hit. <br />it also comes to did she eat? my advice is empty stomach as with 1.5g the normal person wont feel sick, the normal dosage for cap+stem is 3.5g but when it comes to cap that&#039;s different by 10x min.<br /><br />the reality is each person is different, my brother can eat 7g n be fine enough to drive but i can only take 3g max an i still swerve the unicorns<br /><br /><br />psycs depend on the person so always keep that in mind! force booze, coke, molly, ket or H down a throat but never a psyc!!!

				I suppose age will not make much of a difference really. The brain chemistry of elderly people is not much different from that of younger adults. The exception is when there is disease like dementia involved.<br /><br />But if there is not, things like shrooms or lsd may hit you as hard as they do you parents.

				I&#039;ve read a couple of posts in this forum that making tea from shrooms helps with the nausea.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t yet used shrooms but have some galindoi powder and was thinking about making some tea and just having one sip at a time.&nbsp; Is there any logic in that?&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably just use LSD tonight but was thinking about starting off with a very conservative dose of shrooms to test how my system does with it.
