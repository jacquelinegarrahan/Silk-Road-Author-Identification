				&nbsp;I have just let 500 powdered morning glory seeds soak in cold water in the fridge for approximately 18-20 hours.<br /><br />I will be drinking it all.<br />I have never done this before,<br />But I have done LSD&nbsp; before quite often.<br /><br />How does 500 seeds compare to 200-400ug of LSD-25?<br /><br />Will it be more or less intense?<br />Will&nbsp; be able to follow around a friend all day while tripping without causing problems or will I have difficulty doing that?<br /><br />I know everyone is different, but I&#039;m just looking for an estimate here.<br />Also, will a standard anti-psychotic work if shit goes all wrong?<br /><br />I plan to take it at around 10 AM, after eating a good breakfast.<br />Should doing this on a full stomach reduce nausea?<br />I am hesitant to do it on an empty stomach, though.<br /><br /><br />Thoughts, info? Will document the trip+post report after.<br />

				If i&#039;m not mistaken, morning glory contain LSA. You have to convert the LSA to LSD. I&#039;ve personally had a morning glory trip. I found it to be more visual than acid and less of a mental trip. It&#039;s been a while though, and i would have to revisit to give more details. It was definably a worth whiled experience and fun. I think i was 13 at the time haha. :D

				My first psychedelic experience involved me ingesting a similar quantity. I ground them up and then made a little cranberry lime cocktail which I downed, seeds and all. I popped a Zofran to repel emesis and smoked a few bowls. Funny thing is, even after my experiences with NBOMe, psilocybin, and LSD, I have yet to reach the same calibre of tripping that I acheived through my first experience with Morning Glory. In attempts to repeat the experience, I&#039;ve tried consuming only the liquid extraction and leaving the seeds in a tea bag. Even with doses of up to 1000 seeds, I&#039;ve yet to reach the same level as my first trip. I&#039;d advise against taking it on a FULL stomach. Have a slice or two of toast and drink plenty of water beforehand. Be ready for anything. Since seeds aren&#039;t quite standardized for their ergoline contents, dosing will be hit or miss.

				So how did your trip go? I&#039;ve done that with around 50 seeds soaking in everclear in the fridge and that rocked my world for a good 12 hours.&nbsp; Curious to hear how 500 went...

Did you drink a fruit cocktail on subsequent occasions? Orange juice is known to greatly potentiate the effects of mushrooms, mainly by increasing the absorption rate, so it&#039;s a more intense, shorter lasting experience. It&#039;s probably the low pH of the acids in the fruit, and not something specific to orange juice.
