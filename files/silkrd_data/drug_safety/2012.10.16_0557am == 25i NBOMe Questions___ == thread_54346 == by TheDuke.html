				Just got my shipment of 25i NBOMe from hard hustle. I am new to the drug and am curious if there are any sort of hangovers that come along with it. For example if I take one Monday evening am I gonna feel like shit Tuesday? Also is it a drug you can take and be around people without looking/acting fucked up?

				As long as you have a good setting the trip should be alright just do it with the right people.<br /><br />Personally I had no hangover but some of my friends told me that they had a headache the second day...didn&#039;t happen to me tho.

				I&#039;ve decided to try this out at last, after reading several reports.&nbsp; <br /><br />My question is about dosing:&nbsp; I ordered some of the popular 1000 mic blotters.&nbsp; Is this too much for a first time dose?&nbsp; I keep hearing people say they wouldn&#039;t do more than 500 mics, but they seemed to be snorting it instead of sublingual.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				I know from experience that HH&#039;s blotters are unevenly laid. Take no more than half, if it&#039;s your first time. You can&#039;t know for sure how much you will actually get, it can vary a lot. Also if you have no prior experience with psychedelic drugs, I advice you to be extra careful with the 25i. It&#039;s very intense.<br /><br />You will definitely act weird, be with people you are comfortable with.

				Hmm that makes me a bit nervous.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a lot of experience with all manner of psychedelics and other drugs over about 12 years, but I&#039;ve never tried these new ones.&nbsp; Perhaps if they are unevenly laid, I should message&nbsp; him and ask him politely to&nbsp; cancel my order.

				I just had my first dose of HardHustle&#039;s 25 i NBOME blotters and I should have stuck with half I had a crazy trip and went in and out of being paranoid and being completely confident and the whole time my eyes were watery and I itched like a motherfucker. I took half at 7:30, took the other half around 8:00 because I didn&#039;t feel anything but anxious so I started cleaning and vacuuming and running around and then from 8:30-11:00 I was having some fun visuals and had intense hot and cold flashes over and over. I felt nauseous a lot of the time as well and around 11:00 The visuals stopped and the euphoria kicked in for a bit, and around 1:00 that ended as well but I kept tripping out (couldn&#039;t sleep, felt irrational fear, saw things out of the corner of my eye and heard things that weren&#039;t there) and I couldn&#039;t stop itching so I took a benadryl and it helped me pass out around 3:00.<br /><br />&nbsp;Is the itching/watery eyes normal? Is there something I could/should have mixed it with like alcohol or something to keep the anxiety and tenseness down?

				I&#039;ve done 25i 3 times and each time has been a wonderful experience. If you have prior experience with LSD than you should do just fine with 1 tab since I&#039;ve noticed it doesn&#039;t produce much anxiety and the visuals can get somewhat intense but never too overwhelming and can be turned on and off for lack of better words. I always enjoyed trips from 1.5mg-2mg personally<br /><br />Erowid is always a great reference for information<br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome_effects.shtml&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-Effects<br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;-Trip reports and whatnot can be found here including dose<br />

				25i seems to take longer to kick in then the other nbomes for me. 25c takes about thirty minutes for me to start noticing effects. The snortable powders are much faster like 10 to 15 minutes and the come up is a little harsher. They make me sweat a little and i feel a bit of anxiety but it is only during the come up and doesn&#039;t last long. I have throwed up only once with nbomes. Never with LSD and LSD takes me 1.5 to 2 hours to feel it start working.<br /><br />I have herd of people IVing and plugging nbomes but I have never tried it that way and never will. The first time on nbomes if you got to be around folks make sure it&#039;s people who you are comfortable with knowing what you are on preferrably somebody to trip with and make sure you have a few hours of free time where you don&#039;t have to drive or doing anything that really requires you to be focused and use safety. <br /><br />Tripping during the day while outside is great and after you are comfortable with the drug then it&#039;s pretty fun to do it at parties or bars but be sure to have a sober driver. I have experienced pupil dilation several times and so you can&#039;t expect to hide the fact that your fucked up if you get pulled over or what not. Sun glasses will hide it but they won&#039;t hide your sillyness while nboming.<br /><br />At large doses I have felt numbness and tingles in my toes and fingers. The blotter tabs have a numbing effect on the gums and the taste is metallic and mediciny. My first ever nbome trial was from Tyl3rDurden and was just a half of a strawberry 25i cap and it blew my mind. Could not believe these were not illegal.<br /><br />Now I get mad at the tolerance issue. I have to wait at least a week in between trips but I still love these nbomes and smoking weed while nboming is awesome and does extend and intensify my experiences.

				Ive had 25c and 25i blotters. They took about 45 minutes to fully kick in, and was completely done in 5 hours. Thats with 1 hit. I LOVED THEM. They too were from HH. Way lees head trip than LSD. A lot of fun and funny times for me. Positive pushing like 2cb imho. I also had 25i nasal spray, worked like you&#039;d expect--fast on&gt;hard hit&gt;fast off. Ive never had a hangover from this drug the next day-I felt perfectly normal.
