			<dd class="postbody">
				I want to cut this 80% MDMA down to ~50% pure to increase my profits. I&#039;m also trying to find a good RC or maybe even stim recommendation for this purpose.... <br /><br />I can&#039;t find enough reliable info on mixing say... M1 with MDMA or 4-MEC with MDMA, etc. etc.<br /><br />I want to give my clientele a more stimulated roll since 80% pure MDMA seems to be flooring people with .2 and IMO isn&#039;t the best for clubbing and dancing... I want my customers consuming more and dancing their ass off, but I don&#039;t want to cut with anything that&#039;s going to be dangerous either.<br /><br />Anyone think a 3:1 ratio of MDMA to M1 is dangerous?<br /><br />I could give a fuck about you telling me not to cut my shit. It&#039;s gonna happen, but I&#039;m just trying to keep it safe. If mixing with RCs is a terrible idea, well I still wanna know about some inert substance that&#039;ll do the same

				Use Methylone, it&#039;s definitely not inert, but mdma is often cut with much worse. Methylone is a bit more uppity that mdma imo

				You think 33% m1 with 66% mdma is good? I was worried that since there&#039;s a bit of methylone in there, people might get too strong an urge to redose.... might be dangerous if they are compelled to do more and more causing an OD on the MDMA side of things...

				I feel like any compulsion to redose on methylone is because your roll has faded away quicker than you wanted it to, not nearly as bad as say MDPV compulsiveness (Tried the stuff a few times, one time I had maybe around 500mg in a container and it made me want to redose so badly that I dumped it down my sink), but as long as you have enough mdma in your doses to keep them rolling I feel like it wouldn&#039;t be too big of an issue, and if somebody did take more they&#039;re just taking 66% mdma and 33% methylone again<br /><br />edit: and hey if you sell drugs to someone and they take too much that&#039;s their fault for not having self control or being too hasty

				6-APB aka benzo fury,low dose 2cb or 2ci,low dose 4-aco dmt.<br />Those are the chems i would recommend,although 2cb and 4 aco dmt are quite an expensive cutting agent,they have pleasurable effects in low doses.<br />Small doses just before you start getting&nbsp; visuals besides small visual changes.So a gram would last quite awhile 4 aco dmt isnt stimulating very much though,but feels great.<br /><br />&nbsp;Be careful combining&nbsp; powerful stims with mdma it increases chances neurotoxicity.<br /><br />Or you could just combine it with mda with a ratio of 0.3:1 so for 300mg of mda,can be added to a gram of mdma and will have 30mg of mda.<br />That 30mg should suffice for stimulation.

				That&#039;s wrong.<br /><br />You just can&#039;t cut your MDMA with an RC and pass it off as Molly.&nbsp; The whole point in Molly(in the states) is that Ecstasy became too adulterated to use.&nbsp; Well maybe that&#039;s not QUITE accurate.&nbsp; <br /><br />DISCLAIMER[this is the case where i live(near a big city) and i&#039;m relatively sure it&#039;s the same accross America]:<br />At least 80% of the time there&#039;s not going to be ANY MDMA in the pills you buy.&nbsp; There&#039;s often that you&#039;ll get completely bunk bombs with no effects.

Here in the states if its crystal mdma i can get 150 a gram all day long just because its crystal and not powdery and cut.

				You&#039;re very right, psychedelics a great component to a roll, but once again, i would recommend against it because after an event or rave a lot of people get in their car to drive home and frying while driving is a horrible idea.&nbsp; One i would hope most people would decide against anyways(if they knew).&nbsp; But if a person wasn&#039;t aware they were frying it could be potentially hazardous.&nbsp; Both to them and you.<br /><br />Once again, my 2 cents.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to TELL you what to do because honestly you&#039;re not gonna obey some random person on a forum, but i feel&nbsp; it&#039;s important to give you my point of view.&nbsp; My view on the matter was molded and shaped from years of experience; I&#039;m not making any statements, but i might have a bit of experience in this arena.<br /><br />Best of luck! i wish you and your business enterprises well. :D <br /><br />Thanks Friend!

				Cutting molly just doesn&#039;t seem right in this day and age of Silk Road.&nbsp; Why not just increase your price accordingly and leave it pure?&nbsp; I bet once they&#039;ve had it pure you&#039;ll have regular business. MDMA can be delicate. Well educated users thinking it was pure would take 150mg and roll as if they&#039;d had 75mg, which is almost no roll at all.&nbsp; Any other active ingredient you could use to cut with (even methylone, speed etc) is a little bit irresponsible UNLESS you advertise the fact....and if you do, I&#039;ll be they&#039;ll be wishing you just had pure, for a higher price.&nbsp; Leave the active combos to the users, the way it should be.&nbsp; Sell multiple products without cutting them perhaps?<br />Just my opinion. Maybe try pure?

				oh, and I was under the impression that 5htp was best avoided for some time (perhaps 12 to 24 hours) before a roll, as it increases the potential for serotonin syndrome. If this is the case then cutting it with 5htp (which otherwise, does seem like a logical idea), is a bad idea.&nbsp; I am however too high/lazy to look up a link now. Someone chime in if you know!

Don&#039;t see how that&#039;s dangerous/immoral compared to what the rest of the US drug dealers are doing. <br /><br />?Keep two batches. &quot;this is the slightly cut shit for 80/g, whereas this is the pure pure for 120/g...&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about doing it myself but I can&#039;t bring myself to it. It sucks having a frenzy of people wanting to buy copious amounts of mdma crystal esp when they&#039;re all ready to pay top dollar, but i just feel like a such a hypocrite in the end. I&#039;ve been bitching about weak drugs and greedy fucker cutting everything to shit for years. I remember just wishing someone was out there who would supply the REAL FUCKING DEAL, and I remember not caring about paying the little extra for higher quality. Once you get to supplying the resellers though.... You start running numbers and realize the ^^^^^ profit margins for just adding the slightest itty bitty cut. <br /><br />I try talking to people about RCs and M1 and shit all the time, but everyone is pretty much just like &quot;whoa no way brah i dont wanna turn into a zombie.&quot; These are the same idiots that&#039;ll turn around and go into the club and buy random shit from some shady motherfucker at the club. It&#039;s mind boggling how when I start giving out chemical names for MDMA substitutes, people just freak out and dont want anything to do with it, yet in the situation I just described, they&#039;ll just believe some rando&#039;s claim that it&#039;s &quot;PURE MAN SO FIRE MAN BEST SHIT IN TOWN FASHO&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br />

Some people also claim that 5-htp will cause you not to roll if taken less than 6 hours before the roll. If I were your, I&#039;d cut the MDMA with quality speed if you wish the people get a more stimulated &quot;up/dancy&quot;-feeling. <br /><br />5-htp is to be taken as a preload and &quot;reload&quot; (after the roll) not with the roll. If you were to cut the MDMA with 5-htp you could as well go with grounded up chalk.

				For fucks sake at least use an inactive cut!<br /><br />Using an inactive cut = stealing<br />Using another drug to mimic the effect = assault<br /><br />Don&#039;t be one of those assholes that tricks someone else into taking a drug they did not want to take.

				Notwithstanding my extreme dislike for dealers who cut their product, I would recommend some inert substance (e.g. baking soda), rather than another chemical, which could spell disaster for the user for the interactions it could cause with whatever they&#039;re already on. You also have to assume that if you want a chemical that will safely cut with MDMA on its own, you also need to find a chemical that won&#039;t negatively contradict the effects of a drug that your buyers are already on (e.g. alcohol). So something that is completely inert would work best from a harm reduction standpoint.

Taking over 300mg of 5-HTP just before dropping MDMA may however INCREASE the risk of serotonin syndrome. - Still very unlikely. However it would be stupid to take that much 5-HTP anyway as the benefits would be really nonexistent compared to normal doses.<br /><br />I myself used to preload with 5-HTP and B-Complex vitamins back in the day, but quit it as I felt I didn&#039;t get much out of it. I still however use both of them the day after rolling. I also drink quit much lemon juice the day after to get as much of the remaining amphetamines out of my body as I can. Usually if I remember I drink lemon juice the first thing I do when I get home from an event. <br />Best way to preload an MDMA experience is to live healthy, eat healthy and exercise.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />To address the 5-HTP as a cutting agent discussion, I myself feel that if someone was ever to cut any psychoactive substance with anything, it should ALWAYS be done with a non-toxic, non-psychoactive substance. Rather use dextrose (easily obtainable from fitness vendors) or something like that, not 5-HTP. <br /><br />To sum it up. I do not recommend cutting MDMA with anything. I&#039;d rather pay more money for a pure product than less for a product that has been stepped on. And I think this is what most people think too.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				You are a piece of shit. The profit margin is already very high. Sell Methylone for slightly cheaper and tell people it&#039;s Methylone/M1/Bk-MDMA, and explain to them what it does and how it&#039;s different from MDMA and it&#039;ll sell and you&#039;ll make more money than mdma still.<br /><br />It&#039;s the users responsibility to know about the drug they&#039;re using and how to use it.

				Dear OP. You want to cut your gear, fine. I hope you charge accordingly (ie a lot cheaper) and don&#039;t make any bullshit claims about &quot;80%+ purity&quot; or whatever. If that&#039;s what you&#039;re doing, then great. Go on your merry way, sounds reasonable to me.<br /><br />But if you aren&#039;t - and perhaps I&#039;m being terribly naive - but if you&#039;re claiming your gear is pure when it isn&#039;t, then you&#039;re a thieving cunt. If so, I hope someone breaks into your place, cleans out all your valuables, and then I&#039;d love to hear you complaining about how someone ripped you off. In such a case, hopefully you have the self-perception to realise that what&#039;s just happened to you is no different to what you&#039;ve been doing to others.
