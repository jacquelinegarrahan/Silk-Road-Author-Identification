				So I have Dopeboy&#039;s nice white MDA powder.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of parachuting perhaps 100mg first and immediately snorting a few lines.<br /><br />Please share your experiences.<br /><br />What are the cons of snorting?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The effects come too fast and strong, and fade away rather quickly, right?<br />I don&#039;t mind the burning sensation, I&#039;ve done coke in the past and can take it.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Snorting will give you a nice fast comeup for sure.&nbsp; The duration of snoring alone is alot different than a swallowed dose for sure but it isn&#039;t terribly short.<br /><br />If you couple it with a good parachute you should be flying right.&nbsp; The first couple lines will launch you off and then the parachuted dose will bring you to the next level 30 minutes later.&nbsp; I would do atleast 125mgs but then again, I have a high tollerence.&nbsp; Make sure you have a nice empty stomach.<br /><br />Alota people complain about the burning sensation when snorting but I never really thought it was that bad.&nbsp; Then again, I have a strong nose.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />

				db&#039;s mda isn&#039;t terrible going up your nose. it stings a bit, for about 5 minutes, then for the next 18 hours it feels like you stuffed your sinuses full of cotton. real dry and i don&#039;t know, it just feels pretty weird.<br /><br />i parachuted 80 mg, then about an hour later cut up 40mg into lines. i was rolling for a good 7 hours before i could go to sleep. overall it was much more psychedelic than MDEA or MDMA - was having nice color blends and patterning visuals, and some weird CEV projections - i thought I saw an alien fucking vanna white - bizarre shit.<br /><br />regardless, you should have fun no matter how you ingest it :P i would leave your schedule open the next day - the post hangover is pretty rough.

				snorting meth or mdxx will fuck up your nose 5x faster then cocaine because of the high acidity level ...<br /><br /><br />I would advise just to parachute and wait but then again its your own nose and body.

				Bomb it! (parachute it)!<br /><br />You come up a lot faster snorting but your eyes will stream, your nose cavaties will be red and your nose will block.

				OK so I mixed up some of Dopeboys MDA with a pink squirrel from DQB and sunshines 2-cb.<br /><br />Had 1/2 a pink squirrel first - then crushed up another quarter and snorted it (it was pretty easy on the nose). That was more then enough MDMA for me - came up smooth and felt relaxed perfect peak did not feel a need for anymore.<br /><br />About 1.5 hours. I racked up another line of MDA with some 2-cb. probably about 50 mg MDA and 10mg 2c-b (burns like nothing else). It came on very smooth like a very dreamy hi feeling - the visual were typical 2c-b style morphing and alot fluro colours. However it dampened out the loved up &#039;e&#039; feelin a bit.&nbsp; Had a lot of fun for another 3 -4 hours (wont go into details). However I definitely felt a heaviness or tightness around my brain after the line of MDA....<br /><br />Later in the morning after lying in bed trying trying to sleep for three hours, reading trip reports that said best time for 2-cb was on the come down. So I insulfated 20mg 2c-b - and BooYoooow - came on fast everything around just started morphing and and&nbsp; I was having triple vision fluro blurs with full wipe out style game graphics CEV.... the dream like rush came on again...and my head cleared up, I felt like someone had programmed a bunch of computer graphics into my head. So I thought why not try a bit more MDA and see were this combo take me. So I did another bump maybe 30 mg. And.....it killed the 2c-b made it into a girlie trip - I was seeing light blues and pink hues and wavy morphing - it did give me a pretty&nbsp; strong hi but dampened the 2c-b trip and the head tightness came back as well. I really thought it would have an opposite effect.<br /><br />Upon reflection I think maybe I should have started with high dose of MDA to see what i was like on its own then done the 2c-b on the come down. However I think I survived with a fairly average hang over but not taking too much MDA. I am bit wary about the neurotoxicity of MDA which is higher than MDMA and since Iâ€™ve done a fair bit of MDMA of it in the past have no desire to push the limits anymore.<br /><br />So really sunshine&#039;s 2c-b stole the show for me and I will be hitting it up again for sure (it was probably enhanced dramatically by the MDXX however). The MDA remains undecided (but definitely was hi-gh quality), I have enough left for a strong hit one day but i&#039;m in not hurry to do it again soon, i think i&#039;m off the MDXX I just don&#039;t like having a foggy head the next day. Oh and my nose was a bit stuffy for 24 hours afterward but its all cleared up today. In contrast to 25i where I feel better the next day with no side effects other then a bit of a headache ( probably from lack of sleep) which wears off quickly.
