				I posted a produce review of this in the Rumor Mill, and mentioned some complications I experienced with this Changa, but this post is more health and safety specific. Basically I took a monsterous rip of some potent changa(200mg&#039;s) from Buddhanature out of a bong. Han an intense DMT trip, which was followed by a disturbing and somewhat severe headache that lasted for a good 48 hours. Here it is 72 hours later, and it&#039; still lingering, as well as slowed cognitive function, fucked up kind of feeling. I did eat a small amount of blue cheese that day and had about 2.5 pints of beer at lunch, which I now know was dumb, but it was about 7 hours before blasting off, and I was anxious, so I had justified to myself that it was long enough to wait. I also smoked a bowl of weed about an hour or so afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve seen some claims that smoked reversable MAOI&#039;s have short half-lives, mostly on posts on forums. Could someone point me to somewhere that would back that up? The MAOI info out there is clearly for pharmaceutacals mostly, so playing it safe, we could just follow those rules. It doesnt make much sense to wait 14 full days to eat cheese and drink booze again, however. It seems like one hit of syrian rue extract couldn&#039;t possibly stay effective for that long, yet, if it&#039;s only active for 10 minutes, then how could it have rocked my brain and caused this headache for so long. Scary stuff out there about cerebral hemorrages cause by this kind of mix. Are there a bunch of unaware change smokers out there with bleeding brains? Figured someone on the road would have more knowledge and experience to help me out.
