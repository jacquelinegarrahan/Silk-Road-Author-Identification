				For me, MXE was always amazing at doing that. 40-50mg (I&#039;m ~200lbs) taken orally, mixed in a soda, little to no taste. Just make sure you put it in a glass to make sure all the crystals are taken. <br /><br />After the initial dissociative feel, there was a surrounding feel and euphoria for 10+ hour. I never felt a comedown or depressed later, maybe irritable, but I had to go on vacation with my family that day lol, so that might have caused it<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Frequent drug use to get high will lead to nothing but misery. For a sustainable happiness you would need to take something like conventional antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs; or both), or daily, low dose mdma. I personally take a low dose of es-citalopram aka lexapro, cipralex (SSRI) and bupropion aka Wellbutrin (SNRI) daily, and this helps with my mood greatly. The two medications coutner the side effects of eachother, which makes the two drug classes a great combination. Tramadol is also nice as an anti-depressant, which is basically Wellbutrin with an affect on u-opioid receptors.<br /><br />If you are talking occasional use, things like mdma and lsd are great for happiness; lsd being known for its &quot;afterglow&quot; effects, as it can change your perspective to appreciate life more when you are not udner the influence of anything.

				MXE apparently has antidepressant effects similiar to prozac that last a week or more and should be safe, but no one really knows.

The conclusion was that doing a large dose of K can have lasting anti-depressant effects for up to a week afterward. I personally never liked the acute effects of K, but strangely I continued to take it just because of this effect that it has days after, it most definitely worked beyond placebo and my mood was lifted for 2-3 days after a 3 moderate doses in a night.<br /><br />Here is a link to one of the many successful studies on K as an effective treatment for people with severe depression; many of these patients that had positive effects did not respond to other drug therapies.<br /><br />http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/198483.php

				MXE and K didn&#039;t improve my mood, but I take Celexa which might interfere with it. DXM boosts serotonin in high doses so it make sense that K and MXE might too.<br /><br />Weed helps for a few days until I get a tolerance. Opiates definitely make me happy until they wear off. Then I feel twice as shitty. Same with stimulants.

				Honestly I feel the best when I haven&#039;t done anything for awhile, work out, have a regular schedule, and eat healthy. I have so much more confidence and self esteem and just feel like I am the &quot;shit&quot;.<br /><br />It is hard to resist the urge to dip into somehting though :(&nbsp; I feel like as long as I am saving money, working, and not going back to heroin I have accomplished more than most people would have if they had my life experiences. I try, although not my best sometimes.

				Idk who claims that MXE is an anti-depressant, but I call bullshit on that one. I tried it on three separate occasions and each time it had like 20 minutes of euphoria followed by like 3 hours curled up in my bed, crying until i fell asleep. Would not recommend that shit as an anti depressant.

				Well it&#039;s certainly not hardcore, but I think that happiest I&#039;ve ever been in life was when I could smoke good bud, and a few beers after work and shoot the shot with friends.<br /><br />Coke and Meth just made me want more.&nbsp; There was a social aspect to both of those drugs, but for the most part I was always thinking about more, shortly after I did the initial blast.<br /><br />my $0.02.

				I found 2C-I to be very euphoric. At first i thought it was because i was smoking bud with it. Then i tried a week later when i didn&#039;t have any bud. I still had a euphoric experience. Really giddy and felt life was fantastic. (Kinda like a little kid.)
