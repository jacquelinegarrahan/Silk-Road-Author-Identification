				I&#039;m thinking about ordering some oxys but I&#039;m in the uk and haven&#039;t really come across them before. <br />Anyone know a good starter dose? I&#039;m used to opiates but have no tolerance, just dabble on occasion.<br />Wanna nod just don&#039;t wanna push it. Also anyone had good experience with afghan apothecary?

				i guess it depends on your ROA. percs are nice but you shouldn&#039;t be tooting them because of the APAP. if your tolerance is low i wouldn&#039;t start with more than 10mg in a sitting. you can always get a roxy(30mg) and cut it up in to a few lines to even out the dose. like any drug you want to start small and see how you&#039;re feeling before you push it.

				10-20 mgs could do it depending on your tolerance, for me on the otherhand. Anyways are you snorting it or just popping them?

				20mg is seen as a general starting point for most I believe. This will in part depend on your bodyweight and ROA as pointed out above. For myself and 2 friends, all male 75-90kg, 40mg was the correct dose of oxy with no prior experience and no real potentiation.

				it all depends on tolerance and ROA. If you have little to no tolerance i suggest 15mg insuffalted and see how you feel from there. IF you have an opiate tolerance resulting from heroin use you might want to start with 40mg IV. IMHO but be careful drugs affect us all different.

I&#039;d imagine a single 30mg pill over the course of the evening would be a good time for someone with no tolerance. It&#039;s definitely better to potentially under dose and just have to do a few extra bumps (oh, how terrible!) than to overdo it with one big rail on your first go and just end up sweating and puking for the rest of your night. <br />

				Dont forget that the oral bioavailability is close to 90 plus percent. Nasally, its around 50-60 percent. Shooting is 100 percent. Taking it orally gets the most bang for your buck. it doesnt hit you like it does nasally, but it goes much further.&nbsp; It drives me crazy when I see people snorting oxies. Granted, there is a small rush, but you lose so much. Orally, it comes on slow but it lasts a long time.

				I got a buttload of this stuff when i got a surgery. 20-25mg was the sweet spot. Anymore and i would feel sick and it would be unenjoyably. Any less and i wouldn&#039;t feel anything.<br /><br />I dont really get high from painkillers though. It took the pain away in about 3 minutes though lol.

				I&#039;m a lightweight who really enjoys opioids.&nbsp; I weigh 125 pounds, so it doesn&#039;t take much for me to feel stuff. <br /><br />Back in the day, a single 10MG Vicodin tablet (that&#039;s hydrocodone) would knock me on my ass, but I was only taking one tablet every 5 months or so.&nbsp; I started taking them more frequently, and now I find that a 10MG tablet&nbsp; doesn&#039;t pack the wallop that it used to.. but I don&#039;t really like to feel walloped, so I&#039;m usually&nbsp; pretty happy with a 7.5.&nbsp; I feel happy, fuzzy, and good... but I can still function.&nbsp; My beau and I went to see some live acoustic bands a few weeks ago and took 7.5 each, and had a really lovely time.<br /><br />10MG of Percoset (that&#039;s *oxycodone*) will still knock me on my ass.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken 15MG of oxycodone once and it was very lovely as long as I was laying down.&nbsp; My beau and I just laid around touching each others&#039; faces because it just felt so nice.&nbsp; Having my head and back scratched was also really nice.<br /><br />These days I probably take 7.5 MG of either hydrocodone or oxycodone (whatever&#039;s around) 2-3 times per week... nothing huge... and I don&#039;t do it every week; maybe every other week.&nbsp; I just take it orally, just like it&#039;s prescribed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I definitely notice I&#039;ve built a tolerance.&nbsp; My high, happy, fuzzy funtimes only last about 90 minutes now that I&#039;m using more frequently... back when I was only using every 4-5 months it would last hours.<br /><br />My advice is: Start slow!&nbsp; Be someplace where you don&#039;t have to move too much.&nbsp; Comfy couch and a blanket is simple, and can be pretty wonderful.&nbsp;
