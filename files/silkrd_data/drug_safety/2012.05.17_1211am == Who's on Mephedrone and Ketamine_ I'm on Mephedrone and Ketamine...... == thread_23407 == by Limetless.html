				What&#039;s all the hubbub about mephedrone? <br />My friends that have tried it told me it makes you feel great, amped, and some euphoria mildly similar to rolling. They said it was also pretty similar to MDPV... MDPV for me was a shitshow, I ended up throwing the rest of the stuff I had down the sink because I found myself always wanting to re-dose EXTREMELY badly, and that just ended up in a crazy heartbeat and uncomfortable heart palpitations. Is mephedrone the same way? After being high for a few hours do you get a big urge to re-dose? I&#039;m pretty curious about RCs and such, but if meph is anything likd mdpv I think I&#039;ll stay away.. far away...

It&#039;s like MDMA with a hint of speed... But has its own unique high which is out of this world.<br /><br />Never buy too much... like coke if you buy 5 grams you&#039;ll binge till its ran out... I&#039;ve done over a gram and gonna try and call it a day. For the purpose of harm reduction, 300mg in one dose (if taken oral) and if you snort do small lines! Don&#039;t do fat lines you make out of shitty street coke... This stuff is purer than coke most of the time

				Meph is like a cross between MDMA and Bing but the effect is like both of them but without the shit bits of either. It&#039;s nothing like MDPV, MDPV is just a cathinone analogue.

For example Meph is like a cross between Bing and MDMA, Methylone is like a weak version of MDMA, MDPV is more like Bing with speediness but turns you sex mad, Buphedrone is a cold stim, MDPPP is an offshoot and weaker version of MDPV and the list continues. They may be in the same family but the effects are highly varied. It&#039;s essentially like comparing say DMT, 5-MEO-DMT and 4-ACO-DMT because they are derivatives of Tryptamine but have hugely varying effects.
