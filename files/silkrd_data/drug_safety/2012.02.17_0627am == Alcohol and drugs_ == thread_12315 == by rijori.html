				I love caffeine (400 mg) with a few drinks. It takes the sleepiness out and you can drink more, also you&#039;re more clear minded and euphoric. It&#039;s quite fun. I&#039;m sure this also applies to other stimulants such as ephedrine.

				in my experience, you can drink 20x as much as u usually can when tripping, on acid and im pretty sure ive done it on boomers. never taken mescaline so i wouldn&#039;t know. Just be careful because you can get dehydrated and from my research the most common lsd-related deaths have been from alcohol. be smart, stay hydrated if your gonna drink and trip.

				I&#039;d say alcohol is bad with most things just because it can depress their effects. First time you try something new, stay away from alacohol, then see what happens and find out what works for you. I dislike combining acid and alcohol.

				Yes, I agree that it does depress the effects.&nbsp; I actually start drinking after I have finished smoking meth for the night, that way I get the full effect of the meth, but sometimes 36 hours or more without sleep is a bit much, a dozen beers mellows you out nicely, so you can even get some sleep the next afternoon, doesnt knock too much off and is quite pleasant.

				I have to have loads of alcohol to feel free on the dance floor - how much am I reducing the effects of the MDMA that I take with it?<br /><br />Never dared to go out on just MDMA alone.<br /><br />

Psychedelics are solo drugs, you don&#039;t do anything that might give you a bad trip.

				I can&#039;t speak to other drugs, but drinking while on coke is a bad idea.&nbsp; The combination of the two produces a compound called cocaethylene which is cardiotoxic.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bad move. Even if it doesn&#039;t kill you short term you are really putting a strain or your heart down the road.&nbsp; Most drugs I&#039;ve tried are pretty good on their own,

				I recently drank quite a lot of beer during an acid trip. I did this for three reasons:<br /><br />1) To calm my anxiety during the come-up and just relax.<br /><br />2) To do something that felt normal to me so I could feel more grounded whilst tripping balls and going through all the feelings of tension, anxiety, confusion, and fear that I tend to experience at times on this drug.<br /><br />3) So I could say to the people I live with &quot;Oh I was just drunk,&quot; if they happened to ask why I was up all night making noise and moving around, etc. lol!<br /><br />My body felt like crap during the comedown though - bloated and dehydrated (ie: hungover). I probably wouldn&#039;t do it again or recommend it.<br /><br />I can&#039;t even tell you how much I ended up drinking that night - I lost count because I kept getting confused and distracted, but I can tell you that it was a lot. It&#039;s easy to just drink like a fish on acid and not realise how much you&#039;re consuming... so be careful with that!

				Its better to use weed to relax while on acid rather than alcohol. I actually found my usual drinks tasted terrible while I was tripping so didn&#039;t drink much at all.<br />I know what you mean about needed something normal to ground you. I watch comedy tv shows if I need that.
