				I&#039;m on Anavar(a mild oral steroid for losing fat/gaining strength) and I noticed I am having major mood swings. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if these mood swings will induce a bad trip and if I should stay away from drugs until I&#039;m finished the cycle.

				are you on Anavar for any prescribed reasons or simply for training?<br /><br />you should talk to a physician about your mood swings; and stay away from psychedelics &amp;/or any other drugs (maybe except weed,) for the duration of your steroid cycle (and few weeks afterwards)<br /><br />neurochemistry is a sensitive &amp; delicate thing, aswell as your mental health and that of those around you.<br /><br />stay safe, be kind to yourself &amp; others.

				Anavar or Oxandrolone is one of the most commonly used cutting cycle steroids when it comes to losing body weight and fat quickly. Classified as a Schedule III (non-narcotic) controlled substance under the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, this anabolic steroid has the unique ability of inhibiting muscle catabolism that prevents muscles of the body from breaking down.<br /><br />The active ingredient in Anavar tablets is the steroid Oxandrolone and the list of inactive ingredients includes lactose, magnesium stearate, cornstarch, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. It has an active life of 8-12 hours mind yourself because it is detectable up to three weeks. The anabolic steroid is recommended to patients after post extensive surgery, severe trauma, and chronic infections to help them gain weight and is also suggested to HIV/AIDS patients with muscle wasting. Hence why Twelve_Pickles I suspect&nbsp; asked if you were on it as medication. The recommended dosage of Anavar is 200-100 mg per day for men and 2.5-20.0 mg per day for women. Side effects of Anavar can be side effects like loss of appetite, depression, dark urine, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, itching, difficulty in breathing, acne, changes in libido, menstrual irregularities, and mood changes. There are some excellent forums on the clear net http://www.tmuscle.co.uk/ is a great one as its moderated by professionals in the field - Best of luck and stay saft

				How much are you taking? I did a 2 month cycle of Anavar last year, around 40mg a day. I was doing it more for cutting, not as much for bulking.<br /><br />I did MDMA, LSD and Shrooms during the cycle with no side effects. Oxandrolone doesn&#039;t effect any of the receptors that psychedelics effect so I don&#039;t think you have to worry. It doesn&#039;t even effect testosterone so that&#039;s strange that you are getting mood swings, but not uncommon.

				Most likely all in your head.<br /><br />Anavar is extremely mild and barely suppresses your body&#039;s HPTA. A 175mg dose of Anavar is a total overkill by the way. It&#039;s too mild and too expensive to take like that. In fact, most IFBB pro&#039;s don&#039;t go too much beyond 80-100mg a day because back pumps become such an issue.<br /><br />Why are you not taking Testosterone with your cycle? Unless you&#039;re near single digit BF%, you won&#039;t notice hardly anything from Anavar.<br /><br />Save the anavar, diet properly, and come back with 12 weeks worth of Test E and your anavar.<br /><br />EDIT: read your post wrong about MDMA dosage not anavar. Sorry.
