				im quite lucky to have a nice selection of drugs available at the minute, my drug box is overflowing thanks to the wonder that is silkroad, just having a quick flick though my magical box and i have many things lol, i have 25i and 25c NboMe, big bag of dried stooms, coke, meth, speed, ketamine, mdma ferrari beans, dmt, lsd, hash and a couple of types of bud, my problem is finding interesting combos or more, tonight after much thought, im going to do 25i and ketamine tonight, going to start with the 25i now and put a film on, and will introduce the ket as we sail along, any wone tried this combo yet?&nbsp;

				im really finding it hard to get to grips with this 25i stuff, i mean each time i take it it effects me differently,&nbsp; the first few times where strong but not like this, i snorted a cap bout an hour a go, and my world has been odd ever since, it made me sick everywhere witch is not nice :( , and as you can prob tell im struggling to even write this.<br /><br />im no newby to 25i but this cap has really gone to work with me, the last few times have been good but this cap feels like 100caps compared in strength&nbsp; to past times, not sure if i like it..... not like this, its stronger more aggressive more in your face than before,&nbsp; i feel almost over whelmed by it,&nbsp; is a strange chemical it never seems to effect me the same twice over. <br /><br />and man have i got a mess to clean up here..... anyone wanna help&nbsp;

				lol i aint even thought about the ket yet, to be quite honest i have been side swiped by the 25i, it hit like a bat outta hell, like i said im no newby to 25i, its something ive been playing with for a few months on and off, but i have never felt its effects so strong, really was not expecting the effects im getting, its starting to ware off now though but <br /><br />i had a good experience last weekend while mixing ket and 25i, but there was also lots of other stuff in the mix like coke and beer, along with the weed, it all starts to get hard to separate the effects of each cos from my point of view its just another messy weekend or weekday or wotever lol

				nbome is a strange compond, it almost wants to be acid so much and in some respects it almost pulls it off, but its missing in other aspects and it never seems to do the same thing twice, its hard to explain but its either a very hard chemical to dose correctly or its just very unpredictable as to the effect it feels like producing on that occasion either way im struggling to put my finger on it, on some occasions its been a nice calm easy going experience and on others like tonight it is big bold and in your face, and now we hit that time where its effects are all but a memory and i dont know if i want to do more or just surrender to a phat line of ketamine, oh whys it got to be so hard.... wot to do wot to do....&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />more nbome i guess its only 3am im sure there is a bit more to be had yet, but as far as the mix went..... well it didnt really did it, i will end up with the ket that is for sure just not yet,
