				Coming to the point directly:<br /><br />What do you do in a bing session to prevent the nostrils from getting so clogged that at some time you can`t snort anymore ?<br /><br />In a session i redose about every hour with a line sometimes even more frequently. I always switch between both nostrils but everytime i somewhen come to a point where both nostrils are so clogged that&nbsp; snorting is hardly possible. Usually this starts after 5-6 lines.<br /><br />I try to wipe my nose between but somehow this doesn&#039;t get my nostrils completely free as if my nostrils are swollen inside. <br /><br />This doesn&#039;t depend on the stuff i have. This happened to me with all qualities. From bomb to bunk. One clogs more and the other one less but somewhen i always end up with clogged nostrils.<br /><br />Am i the only one facing this problem ? If not how do you handle this ?<br /><br />Should i do bigger lines but with more time between them ?<br /><br />Every help is very appreciated. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t get that problem unless its really cut and I use both nostrils. What I do is use one side for a few lines and switch to the other. But if my nose gets clogged I take it as a sign to just chill out for a bit.

Wash it in acetone if you have to to get rid of the trash.

				Thanks for the replies so far.<br /><br />I think i`m gonna try to wash my nostrils with a little water here and then.<br /><br />Sticking to better quality is not the solution as it happened to me with all qualities i had over the years. Good and bad. One more one less but it happened.<br /><br />To stop snorting more lines when the nostrils are clogged and give them time to recover, yeah, but you know, sometimes i just want to ride that white horse. :-)<br /><br />

				id recommend nasal spray or distilled water, not tap water. when tap water is exposed to nasal membranes there is a small risk of a very serious amoeba infection which is difficult to treat since it is a eukaryotic organism as well (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/acanthamoeba/biology.html). acanthamoeba can penetrate into the central nervous system wreaking havoc and can be very easily avoided. i would recommend just getting a bottle of nasal spray, which is basically just saline to moisturize nasal membranes and is very cheap for a large bottle... i use it when insufflating coke, pills, H, basically anything to help dissolve the powder and prevent damage as well as prevent getting clogged up as you mention. besides my fascination with the bug, it will just help prevent infections in general and is very handy.

				I snort water too. And it helps a lot. The bonus is that you get more out of your precious C. You will noticed this, when the water+C runs down your throat. Sometimes i am surprised how much C is left and hidden in my nostrils. <br /><br />But i can not recommend to use sinex sprays. If i use them to reduce the clogging of my nose, i always tend to nosebleed afterwards. I think its because these sprays are drying out your/my nasal mucosa.<br /><br />I have better experience with &quot;seawater&quot; sprays. Lesser Clogging, no C left unused in my nose, no nosebleed.

				@Limetless: <br />Just looked up some Vick sinex spray, the active ingredient seems to be oxymetazoline. Nice to get rid of the swellings but they claim that the oxymetazoline contracts the blood vessels which would then result in a less effective bing absorption, but i don&#039;t know in my bio&amp;chem classes i only glared with absence. :-)<br /><br />The &quot;seawater&quot; sprays sounds good. gonna give this a try tonite. yay !<br /><br />again thanks for all your tips !

				I&#039;ve always snorted some water up from my hand after snorting up substances. it works a treat, but reading OP about &#039;amoeba infection&#039; has made me seriously consider investing in some nasal spray..

				I put some water in a bowl and also add some salt to the water and then snort it up from my hand. The salt make it more pleasant and you get your nose better free from the stuff. Just try it and you will see! :-)
