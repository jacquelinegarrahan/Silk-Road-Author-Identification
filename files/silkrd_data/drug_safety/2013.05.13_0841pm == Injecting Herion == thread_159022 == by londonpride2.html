				I have never done so before but I wish for a verity of reasons to try it. The question I want to ask you guys is what equipment do I need to inject number 3 heroin. <br /><br />I know I need some kind of filter but they seem very hard to find. <br /><br />I know I need citric acid. (medical stuff is easy to find).<br /><br />I know I need sterile water.<br /><br />I know I swob the skin first to make sure its clean as possible.<br /><br />What gauge needle should I use?<br /><br />But what type of needle do I use?<br /><br />I have found this:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Developed by Apothicom, the sterifilt is the world&#039;s first purpose made single-use filter for illicit drugs. The polypropelene membrane filters particles but retains virtually no drug. In addition, it loses strength when wet, making re-use difficult.<br /><br />The sterifilt is available in the UK from Exchange Supplies.<br /><br />The sterifilt has a polypropylene membrane that filters much more effectively than makeshift filters (such as cigarette filters) and is much less likely to be shared because it:<br /><br />retains far less drug than a makeshift filter<br />loses its strength when wet, so will break if multiple use is attempted<br />works with both crushed tablets, and powdered drugs.<br /><br />This means that the sterifilt has significant potential to reduce the soft tissue infections and other problems arising from the re-use of dirty filters.<br /><br />Filters that have been contaminated with blood may also a hepatitis C infection risk, although this is much less than from shared syringes providing filters reinforces the importance of not sharing. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But I there are so many needle choices and I havent found a single micro filter other than whats built into the needle. <br /><br />Someone please help me with the practicalitys rather than the morality&#039;s.<br />

				Just go into your local needle exchange ask for a pack of 1ml&#039;s - they&#039;ll know what you mean. In that pack you&#039;ll get needles, alcohol sterile pads and a &#039;sin bin&#039; - to put your used needles in.<br /><br />Buy a pack of filters for roll ups from any shop, and break a piece off to use as a filter.<br /><br />Simply put the amount of heroin in a spoon along with a small pinch on citric acid or vit c powder (however you&#039;ll need more Vit c powder than citric) add about 3/4 of the needle full of water into the spoon. Heat until you get a clear solution add filter, draw up through the filter, find a vein and inject.<br /><br />It really is that simple. <br /><br />But a word of advice - start small as too much and your brown bread....

				Japans answer, while a little short on detail, is basically correct.&nbsp; However there are a lot of things in between buying the H and actually injecting it that you should be aware of.<br /><br />First, do you have any Opiate tolerance at all?&nbsp; This is very important because the difference in the amount an intolerant person might take and that of a mildly tolerant person is enough to kill you.<br /><br />If you are totally opiate naive than I wouldn&#039;t start with more than 10-15mg.&nbsp; Equipment (if you are unable to secure a kit from a needle exchange):<br /><br />1 x Cooker (small metal container capable of holding 2-3cc&#039;s of sterile water, like a 1tbsp metal measuring spoon)<br />1 x 1CC insulin syringe (I prefer 1/2&quot; long needle, not the shorter ones) Each needle holds 1CC/1ML or 100 units.<br />Citric Acid<br />Sterile water (distilled water works)<br /><br />Using the syringe suck up 80-90 units of water and squirt it into your cooker.&nbsp; Drop in 10-15mg of H into the water and add a small pinch of citric acid.&nbsp; heat it for 5-10 seconds and stir until everything dissolves, don&#039;t overheat it, be gentle.<br /><br />Using a clean cigarette filter or a micron filter if you can find any, draw up the liquid into the syringe.&nbsp; Turn it needle up and flick it to get all the air bubbles to rise to the surface and then push the plunger to get rid of the excess air.<br /><br />Find a vein.&nbsp; The one in the crook of your elbow is usually the easiest for beginners.&nbsp; Using an alcohol swab wipe the area you are about to stick with the syringe.&nbsp; Using a large rubber band or something else you can tie off, tie the band ABOVE where you will be injecting, to make it easier to hit the vein. (using a tie off is not required, it just makes it easier for some people to find a vein)<br /><br />With the needle pointing towards your body, push it into the vein.&nbsp; Draw back just a little, you should see blood enter the chamber, if you don&#039;t you have missed the vein and will have to try again (sometimes you can move the syringe back a little and it will hit the vein).&nbsp; If you see blood you are OK to now depress the plunger.&nbsp; Normally on the first hit of a new batch I would only depress the plunger 3/4 of the way and wait 30 seconds, just in case, then finish it off.&nbsp; Make sure you keep a steady hand while depressing the plunger as it is easy to move the syringe out of the vein while injecting, in which case you will end up with red skin and swelling, which should go back down in about 15 minutes.&nbsp; You will still feel it, but you won&#039;t get a rush, it will just be a slow gradual high.<br /><br />Pull the needle and wipe again with alcohol and press a cotton ball down onto the site to stop any bleeding.<br /><br />Wait at least 15 minutes to see how the hit will effect you and before trying again.&nbsp; Do not do more than 50mg in one session (3-6 hours) if you are opiate intolerant.&nbsp; If you do have a tolerance you will have to judge yourself what your limit should be, but don&#039;t just keep hitting and hitting because it becomes cumulative and before you know it you&#039;ll be passed out on the floor, possibly not breathing.

				Thank you both for sparring the time to write in such detail that will be of great use. I have bought a couple of harm reduction books regarding injection and related subjects so hopefully all will be well. I might start with an Oxycontin and I will know the dose as herion varys so much. <br /><br />Although will I need the citric acid with the oxy?

				You have to be careful with Oxy.

				I&#039;m surprised no one has suggested plugging. Not exactly as glamorous but you still get a pretty good rush and the bio availability is close to IV. No risk of messing up the shot and no marks for anyone to see. It just makes sense for so many reasons.&nbsp; Just use a syringe without a needle, use more water than for a shot, and make sure you&#039;ve emptied the bowels beforehand. I don&#039;t have any problems with my sexuality and I&#039;m not homophobic so it has never been a big deal to me but I was like hell no until one day I couldn&#039;t get my veins and I slightly missed a shot then my girl mentioned it.

I started IV ing for fun, but it went bad quickly. I don&#039;t know of one person who isn&#039;t fucked from IVing Heroin, dead or still doing it, injecting into their dicks/tits cos they have no veins. It&#039;s like you have 2 addictions, the H and the needle.&nbsp; Anyway you don&#039;t need to hear the horror stories!<br /><br />Anyway, you&#039;ve made a choice and it&#039;s a good one :)

From my 20 odd years on and off the gear the vast majority that said they never would did, and still are (if they&#039;re alive). The problem I found is once you can&#039;t get a buzz off smoking it anymore, or when it&#039;s late at night and you&#039;re clucking and no-one has any foil (or a similar scenario) it just becomes a matter of time. Unfortunately that&#039;s the harsh reality of heroin addiction.<br /><br />But londonpride I really do hope you stick to what you say, because it&#039;s took me to places that I&#039;d never want people to go.<br /><br />Nowadays, I work, have a family, and keep my habit very small. But it took some kickass willpower for me to stick to this - which I have for 5 odd years now. I actually have a well respected job, and I go about my business and no-one has a clue what I do in my spare time. I dress nice, I&#039;m hygienic, my wife doesn&#039;t take any drugs.<br /><br />But for 8 years I lived in a carpark on the Old Kent Road with DVT in my right leg, nearly had to have it amputated, had Hep C (had treatment since and I&#039;m all clear :D) - so times have changed since then, but many stay on the streets or die.<br /><br />From chatting with you londonpride you seem like a good guy - leave the needle alone.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried plugging it - I might however, give it a go one of these days!

				Mate I don&#039;t know where to start here . <br /><br />1. Ok firstly do not use a cigarette filter for a whole load of reasons cigarette filters are about 20 microns which is crap for a filter - Its been said on here already about going to your local pharmacy or Needle Exchange ( If you want DM me the area your in ) NOT your address I will help find your local NSP or pharmacy Lots of good reasons for going there mainly its free and its anonymous and your get water citric etc. some also will give you foil to smoke rather than inject.<br /><br />2. Try and always have someone with you esp for the first time just in case of OD <br /><br />3. Avoid Benzos and Alcohol <br /><br />4. Do a tester shot dont bang the whole bag<br /><br />5. Dont use lemon juice - There is research showing that lemon juice can carry fungal infections, which can infect the heart (endocarditis) and eyes (candidal endopthalmitis).&nbsp; The candidal fungi lives on the skins of the lemons when they are growing on the tree, when the lemons are processed the fungus is transferred to the juice<br /><br />I could go on - I know the guys at Exchange Supplies their equipment is excellent - but why buy if you can get the equipment for free ..... DM me if you want more info I work in this area <br /><br />I would smoke rather than inject if you can as when you start going down the IV route its seriously difficult to come back from it without help.

Yes, you can get addicted to ROAs. In the episode about cocaine from National Geographic&#039;s &quot;Drugs, Inc.&quot; they interviewed a doctor who conducted research on long-term addicts who have been clean for a few years. The researchers did a brain scan while showing the subject a video of someone preparing and snorting a line and they could see his reward center go crazy.<br />And many smokers who want to quit chew gum every time they crave tobacco because a large part of the addiction seems to be caused by mouth movements that the reward center associates with a reward.

The difference in feeling isn&#039;t worth it for IV and if I knew I could have done this and still get high the same I would have plugged from the get go. I also wanted mention that you can still easily OD from this method. One time I did 60mg at noon and 13 hours later I was still nodding out. That was a bit scary since I kept nodding all day. Nodded in the kitchen while standing and woke up on the floor right after and way way too much time had passed.

There is a great document about rituals in drug use http://www.drugtext.org/Drug-Use-as-a-Social-Ritual/4-heroin-rituals.html this part is on Heroin its a great read. I know alot of drug users who prefer the ritual of smoking H rather than injecting Smoking is more sociable etc ...Just mind yourself and as people have said on here IV should be the very last resort
