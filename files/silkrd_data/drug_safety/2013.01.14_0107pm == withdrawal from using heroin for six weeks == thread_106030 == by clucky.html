				get ready for the worst. and diarrhea. <br />im not sure MDMA is a good idea. Could make you do stupid shit and go score more dope. Just cold turkey and stay sober till the whole thing leaves your system. buy a lot of food and dont leave the house.

				A great deal depends on your mindset- if you make a big deal out of it- it will be a big deal. I once did a detox (in a caravan) after smoking 1g of good H a day, in the preceding months (police forensics had it as 54% pure by weight). Got through the withdrawals without too much trouble- had a good supply of finest quality charas to take the edge off. When I got mobile again, I found some bastard had ripped off my money which I had buried before I came off. I knew exactly where it should have been, but tried about 4 times, digging in a different area- the stress of digging and knowing it had really gone and was not lost bought the withdrawals back to the worst stage again- aches, no energy, no patience. I stopped bothering to look and my withdrawals eased off again- this shows that your mind plays as big a role in withdrawals as the actual physical symptoms, or put another way, they both have an equal part to play. It will be worse than a bout of flu..... but, how much worse depends a lot on how you play it. Give yourself at least a week when you have no commitments, worries, get a friend to look in on you- it would be good if they would make you a little to eat- try to eat even though you won&#039;t want to. Later in the withdrawals, you don&#039;t want the pains of hunger pangs to add to your woes! After the 5th day start to exercise as much as you can- really push it- this will get your endorphins out to play again and get your bodies central heating back into action. Bicycles are great- fight the withdrawals, the aches, pains in your legs by working them. I&#039;ve found this to be most effective against the aches and restless leg syndrome that you&#039;ll get.<br />Recently heard quite a bit about loperamide (anti diarrhea tablets related to the opiate family) and it&#039;s ability to take the edge off, never tried it myself though. I have found, over the years, the more detoxes one does, the less one finds oneself of being able to cope with it, even when my habit was ridiculously high because I was in a source country, I could ride it out, nowadays, I&#039;m glad to say, I got out of the whole circle and just have a bit of a chip every so often (you have to be very strict and self disciplined to just chip after being an addict, so many people, including myself, go through a cycle of abstinence, then finding a source, habit runs away with itself, get your shit together again, and so on). I find SR is a great way of controlling my use as it is not instant gratification, so there is time for you to think it over and have a reality check on where you are with your use.<br />Take it easy- avoid other users like the plague- even if they are friends, they are the ones that will bring you down again! Don&#039;t know where you are in that respect- ie. what is your neighborhood like. Have you taken on the junkie lifestyle- most users will get sucked into it just from no choice- the necessities of knowing where to score, being a trusted punter (customer etc). That maybe a big issue you will have to deal with! That&#039;s why I say avoid other users like the plague. Some users like nothing better than to see somebody else fail as it is a self affirmation to them that that is why they are still on it- it makes them feel better about their own situation!<br />End of the day, different people have their own (or will discover) coping strategies that work for them. It might take a few attempts, depending how deep in the life you are, don&#039;t let one setback stop you.<br />All the best, bobhope333

				i highly suggest getting some kratom... it has analgesic effects and lessens withdrawals. it&#039;s a plant in the coffee family and has been used to treat opioid dependence. might make things a bit easier for you! :)

I imagine that adding weed and benzos and maybe some kratom as suggested by moonflower would help too.<br />Having someone monitor you the whole time would be a good idea too.
