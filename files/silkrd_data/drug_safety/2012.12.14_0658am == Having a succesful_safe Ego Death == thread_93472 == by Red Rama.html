				I know there&#039;s already a topic loosely covering this in the Philosophy section. I read through it and didn&#039;t really find what I was looking for. If this is in the wrong section feel free to move it, but since I&#039;m trying to safely experience it using drugs I felt it should go here. I read an Erowid trip report about it. The guy took about 4-5 grams of Shrums, split into two separate doses about an hour or two apart. I&#039;m an all day every day Cannabis user, but I&#039;ve only used Psychedelics occasionally, and my last Shrum trip was about a two years ago. I&#039;ve only taken one hit of LSD, and the most Shrums I&#039;ve consumed in one sitting is about 1.5 g. It wasn&#039;t enough to trip balls or anything, just enough to make the colors and soundtrack to Heavy Metal even more awesome. I have just over a month before I have classes again, so I want to try and experience this before going back as a way to prep my mind for the year ahead and make it the best I can. If you&#039;ve experienced this before, what drug did you use and what quantity did you take? If you&#039;ve experienced more than one, did you use a different drug for different ones, and if so, which would you recommend most? Thanks in advance for the input.

				Well, my first major ego death experience was on 2 hits of Space-monkey blotter acid. I don&#039;t necessarily think you can force an ego death upon yourself. Ego death is something that comes to you whenever your mind/spirit thinks it&#039;s ready.<br /><br />Halfway through my acid trip I had no sense of time and thought the trip had ended. Little did I know I was only halfway into my trip when I decided to leave my friends and go back to my apartment. I was in my room by myself and all of a sudden I started to peak. The lights were turned off and I just sat there for 6 hours going through the most wild memories of my childhood. Good and bad things. I eventually got a feeling that I was starting to die. And the next day I woke up and was completely reborn.<br /><br />^That was absolutely life changing.<br /><br />All in all, if you want to attempt to force it upon yourself just do what I did and trip by yourself. It&#039;s LSD or whatever psychedelic you use vs. YOUR mind. Having no distractions helps such as friends. The trip will suck you in to an endless mindfuck until the drug wears off.<br /><br />It was very difficult to integrate the experience but 6 months later I was back to normal, but a new person.<br /><br />Try it out.&nbsp; :)

				Thanks for the info; +1 definitely very helpful. My plan before I posted this topic was basically as you put it, trip alone and just wait it out and see where it goes. You said your &quot;first&quot; major ego death experience, have you had more than one? If so were they all Acid induced?

				For safety, I&#039;d only suggest of course having a sitter and being in a good setting.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you&#039;ve experienced this before, what drug did you use and what quantity did you take?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>200 micograms of LSD.

				Thanks for your input as well, +1. I figured LSD would probably be the more reliable choice, since Shrums tend to enhance sound and color for me, but tend to do little as far as mood elevation/alteration goes. I&#039;ll likely not have a sitter, since as RedCloud mentioned that would probably be a distraction. I&#039;ve been meaning to try actually try out DMT as well, I&#039;ve smoke cannabis out of a pipe that had some resin in it, but haven&#039;t had it by itself in freebase form.

				i&#039;ve experienced ego death many times, mostly on shrooms and dmt. with lsd you usually need higher doses before the ego dissolves, whereas with shrooms you don&#039;t really need a lot. 1/8 (3.5 grams) would probably be more than enough.

				i&#039;ve experienced ego death from salvia before...for some reason during all my salvia trips i&#039;ve assumed the form of anthropomorphized inanimate objects...for example i became a broom bristle in one trip...another trip i was a molecule of rubber on a tire tread who was shredded into oblivion as the tire came around and i hit the asphalt...and on another trip i was a person made of carpet who lived in a carpet town....
