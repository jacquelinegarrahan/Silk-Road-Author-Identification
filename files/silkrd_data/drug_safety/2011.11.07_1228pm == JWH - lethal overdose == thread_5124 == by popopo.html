				Recently there has been some articles about the dangers of synthetic weed claiming that there have been deaths from overdoses.. Im just wondering if its actually possible to die from a jwh-x overdose? if i risk dying if i dont use a 0.01 g scale to measure my doses?

				I haven&#039;t read anything about lethal overdose, but with insane amounts everything is possible. I know I thought I was dying! But I guess I just had the &#039;pleasure&#039; of panic attack for the first time in my life:) Start with less than you think is small dose, work from there. At least JWH-018 is potent as hell.

				This just proves my point about weed.<br />Why synthesize the perfect plant, when you can just grow/buy it?<br />I mean, if you need a stronger hit, buy some hash or budder.&nbsp; It&#039;s not THAT expensive.

				I believe there was a story last week or 2 about a young boy that had had lung issues or some other serious medical issue and smoked some synthetic weed and ended up dying.&nbsp; I believe I also read that he was smoking it from some sort of PLASTIC bowl maybe home made but CERTAINLY YOU DON&#039;T SMOKE PLASTIC!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the plastic fumes damaged his lungs WAY MORE than the synthetic weed.&nbsp; Funny though the headline didn&#039;t say BOY DIES FROM SMOKING PLASTIC....it said BOY DIES AFTER SMOKING SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA.&nbsp; I will look for the article and post link if I can.<br /><br />Why smoke anything synthetic when there is such high quality weed available???

				I&#039;m already buying weed and hash, just wanted to try jwh because I heard its good (and legal where I live).. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve any lung problems, I used to smoke a lot from custom pipes made out of coke bottles so I would also be fine with that&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Is there a lot of difference between the effects of each jwh type or will it be about the same whatever i buy?

				Ok so I found the article.....Yeah not too smart using a PEZ dispenser as a pipe.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would think the fumes from the plastic burning would be worse than the synthetic mj.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like how they say the chemicals in the drugs killed him while COMPLETELY ignoring the fact that the PLASTIC from the pez dispenser probably gave off some pretty noxious fumes.&nbsp; Oh and btw he had undergone a DOUBLE LUNG transplant before all this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably shouldn&#039;t have been smoking anything.....Plastic, synthetic, or anything else.<br />I prefer the real thing....especially with all these delicious strains around these days.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />PITTSBURGH â€” A Pennsylvania eighth-grader who became ill after smoking synthetic marijuana and had a double lung transplant has died.<br /><br />Tonya Rice tells the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review ( ) that her 13-year-old son, Brandon, died Thursday morning at Children&#039;s Hospital of Pittsburgh at UPMC. http://bit.ly/tk0Vod<br /><br />The boy smoked the fake marijuana out of a plastic PEZ candy dispenser. The chemicals in the drugs caused extensive damage to his lungs. Brandon was put on a respirator in June and had a double lung transplant in September.<br /><br />The boy&#039;s mother says anti-rejection drugs he&#039;d taken since the transplants weakened his immune system and made him unable to fight a recent infection.<br /><br />Gov. Tom Corbett signed a law outlawing such substances in Pennsylvania a few days after the boy smoked the substances. The ban took effect in August.

				This is a very minor correction to the above post, but he had the double lung transplant AFTER he smoked. The chronology of events was Smoking --&gt; double lung transplant --&gt; body rejecting lungs because God realized he made a mistake and decided to revoke the kid&#039;s life card --&gt; Darwin award
