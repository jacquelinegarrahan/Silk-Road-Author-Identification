				i have seen a few methods for preparing these, i was curious as to the latest preferred method with HCl now that the freebase is less common.<br /><br />i have seen<br />a) 1/1 water to vodka,<br />b) citric acid (just a few drops)<br />c) very few suggest using only distilled water. (i read even using heat, it would have to be hotter than the boiling point of water but not sure if this was for the freebase or HCl)<br /><br />the math after is simple enough, you want to keep your doses reasonable.<br />for those with more experience, can you please tell me your preferred method?

				I also used an Afrin bottle. There are various ones... With the one I used I found that 2 tablespoons (measured with a syringe) produced 150 sprays, give or take a few sprays. I was dosing 25i and wanted each dose to be about .6 of a mg. I wanted each dose to be 3 sprays. This means that my Afrin bottle would contain 50 doses at 3 sprays each. So I did one tablespoon of nasal saline solution and one tablespoon of vodka, and 30mg of the 25i powder. <br /><br />I have been a regular user of the 25i tabs at 1mg, and this method at .6mg in a nasal spray seemed to feel about the same dose as the tabs. The advantage is the come up only took about 10-15 minutes, seemed smoother and without as much body load, and is just all around less of a pain than the tabs.<br /><br />I am going to try the same thing with some 25D that I have coming.

(initial weight)<br />3) Pump the spray 50 times.&nbsp; Press the pump firmly and completely each time.<br />4) Weigh the bottle and record the weight (final weight)<br />5) Calculate as follows:<br />single pump volume = (final weight - initial weight) / 50<br /><br />The calculated single pump volume should be very very close to 0.10.&nbsp; If not, you have to adjust accordingly or go get the kind of Afrin bottle that dispenses 1/10 mL.<br /><br />Disclaimer: If you decide to try this, you are responsible to verify these calculations.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t capable of doing this correctly, don&#039;t try it.&nbsp; You do this at your own risk.&nbsp; If others trust you to do this for them, they trust you at their own risk.

				There already is an analog law in the USA.&nbsp; To which act specifically are you referring?&nbsp; And why would it dry up the tabs and not the powder?

				Just something I plan to try when the Analogue Act passes (the one that schedules all nbomes by name) and my tabs run out. The current law only names 25B as an analogue.

				Ah yeah, sorry for not clarifying. <br /><br />Good news though, Foxy says 2c-g was left off the list so 25g will be safe. Haha, hope it turns out to be a good one.

				Looks like the 2C-X-Flys did not make it into S.3187.&nbsp; I wonder how the NBOMe versions of these would be?
