				[Edit: I changed the title of this thread since lot of details have been posted regarding the technique of using dmt]<br /><br />I posted it in newbies forum but there is so many active threads that keep my post behind. So..<br /><br />I got my 100mg dmt before 3 days and been reading here and on the net about how to do it correctly. I decided to go for the glass pipe method.<br /><br />Well my first try was a failure. (5 minutes ago) I put around 30mg to my glass pipe, had my torch lighter a few cm down and after some seconds when dmt started to melt (there i gently moved around the pipe for better vaporization). Then the pipe was slowly fulling with white vapor and when it started to come out from the little hole I slowly started inhaling. (was expecting nastier taste but, that was tolerable). I did this 2 times until there was nothing left in the pipe and lied down. Tried to keep the smoke as long as possible but somewhere I must have gone wrong...<br /><br />Other details I should probably mention are the following.<br />Only at the very end my pipe became little black,<br />The second inhaling burned my lips a bit,<br />And that the chamber of the pipe is really small must I say.<br />I was holding the light below the pipe not above<br />I had put only dmt nothing else<br />Nothing happened :(<br /><br />Do you think maybe making a bigger pipe (ex from bottle so that I can make more vapor) is a good idea?<br />If you have patience to answer back it would be very appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks again<br /><br />Adamiz

				hello, an greetingz adamiz :)<br /><br />you do not want the DMT to burn :-\, you only want it to vaporize.. (no smoke) and 50 MG is a better amount to start with ;)<br /><br />if you want some links an information on smoking I&#039;ll grab links for you no problem, or you can just search around proper DMT vaporization..<br /><br /><br />its a tricky substance to smoke correctly.. by far the easiest method is the machine, or perhaps making chaga

				Well if you can gather the links and have time then please be my quests. I have checked many different sources though.<br /><br />It is indeed a tricky substance, but what the hell, one day I will figure out how to do it correctly.<br />I guess&nbsp; its time to order again some dmt because the way I see it, I will probably waste a lot.<br /><br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Adamiz

				I&#039;m assuming by glass pipe you meant a crack/meth pipe. Personally, I don&#039;t find them to work very well. I read on the DMT Nexus a while ago that DMT likes to slide/move away from heat, so its very hard to use a crack pipe for DMT as it tends to go all over the pipe and you will not be able to inhale all 100% of it.<br /><br />If you do not want to go to the effort to hunting down an electric vaporizer or build a DMT-Machine, then just use a normal glass pipe that you would smoke weed out of. Put the DMT powder/crystal on top of some ash and use a NORMAL butane lighter. Move the flame close to the DMT but do not touch it, once you are around a centimeter away it will turn into a gel and slowly liquify into the ash. Once its been totally melted, put the flame directly into the ash and smoke it like you normally would :-)<br /><br />The first 10-20 times I smoked DMT it was that way, its extremely simple once you get the hang of it and its an easy breakthrough every time. I didn&#039;t make my own DMT-Machine until around my 30th time doing DMT, and even know I like to go back to the traditional pipe method from time to time.<br /><br />Or do the same thing with a bong, hits you even harder! I like to use fresh weed instead of ash to melt the DMT into when hitting out of a bong though.<br /><br />Good luck tripping!

				Thanks Internal. I was really thinking this idea with the ash. Sound good. Can I use for example cigarette ash?<br />I will probably start building this famous &quot;machine&quot; thats on the dmtnexus these days and will report back as I try again.<br /><br />Thnaks.<br /><br />And yes the dmt likes to slide as you said. That was the most extraordinary thing I saw today hehe<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Adamiz

				Any ash works perfectly, the ash only serves as something the DMT can melt into (and prevent it from falling inside the pipe).<br /><br />I actually bought an oil/meth pipe specifically for the purpose of using it for DMT ;D After using it the first time, all I managed to do was have 70% of the DMT run around the bowl of the pipe then recrystallize inside on the glass and of course I got a burnt lip.<br /><br />Careful when you make your Machine. I made mine out of an old glass olive oil bottle. Only problem was, the glass on the bottom was half an inch thick! Took me over 30 minutes just to drill through the damn thing, I cracked the glass at one point as well. I recommend if you are drilling through it, to start out with a very small drill bit and make a &#039;pilot hole&#039;. In-case you arent familiar with the term, once you drill the small hole, just keep changing your bits and re-drilling with larger ones until you have the perfect size. You&#039;ll end up re-drilling the same hole with different size bits about 10 times :P<br /><br />Or you can just do what&nbsp; I did, and spend 35 minutes trying to drill a single hole in a thick glass bottle with a massive, dull drill bit.<br /><br />Cheers :-)

				Another question. ( i know...)<br /><br />Ok so the machine is build and you are ready. <br /><br />You take out this cooper ball, and then what? I have read these versions.<br /><br />a) Burn your cooper ball, add the dmt on it, place it back and then start inhaling (they don&#039;t mention any further burning)<br />b) Take your cooper ball and add the dmt on top of it place it back and burn it while inhaling (at least until it start vaporizing<br /><br />I suppose that the bottle is upside down, and the dmt is on top of the wool and then you burn it. When it vaporizes it is ready for the first toke. Then the same again. Is that right?<br /><br />Really thanks again<br /><br />Adamiz

For those who really want to get a 50 mg dose<br />or more, rather than just burning that much, there is finally<br />a solution. “The Machine” is an amazingly effective drug delivery<br />device that I recently test-drove. It is capable of holding<br />one or many doses, for one person’s repeated use or multiple<br />users. I was introduced to The Machine by an Australian<br />friend who, at the 2002 Burning Man, also taught me<br />about the benefits that can be derived by using mullein when<br />smoking tryptamines. The expectorant properties of mullein<br />help clear out the lungs after smoking, and it also permits<br />deeper inhalations without coughing during smoking. Mullein<br />is also useful for using 5-MeO-DMT due to additionally<br />permitting easier eye-balling of doses, via standardization.<br /><br />The only materials needed to fashion The Machine are a small glass<br />bottle and a bit of extremely coarse steel wool, as is used for scrubbing<br />pans. For the bottle, a single-serving Hennessy Cognac bottle works<br />great, due to its long neck coupled with a handy pre-formed weak spot<br />in the bottom. After breaking or drilling a small hole in the bottom of<br />the bottle, a bit of steel wool is rolled into a plug and then pushed into<br />the neck. Any loose bits inside can be compacted gently by using a probe<br />inserted through the hole broken in the bottom. This is the finished<br />device ready to be charged.<br /><br />To charge The Machine, enough for one or more good doses (the more<br />the better) is directly applied to the surface of the steel wool at the mouth<br />of the bottle. The neck of the bottle is then gently heated just enough to<br />cause the alkaloid to melt into the steel wool plug. If not intended for<br />immediate use or if intermittent use is desired the cap can be replaced<br />over the charge to protect it. Freshly applied DMT resin can be prevented<br />from contacting the cap by placing a small piece of paper between<br />it and the cap (rolling paper works well for this). The Machine<br />can also be charged for multiple users by placing a much larger quantity<br />on the inside of the plug by dropping it through the broken hole.<br />Charging is done the same way, by gently heating the neck until the<br />plug absorbs the alkaloid.<br /><br />To use The Machine, simply point the neck downwards and heat the<br />steel wool plug from below with a lighter, while slowly inhaling through<br />the hole made in the bottom. (Take care not to overheat and ignite the<br />steel wool.) Rotating the bottle while heating will help it volatilize evenly.<br />The high surface area and heat distribution of the steel wool traps the<br />liquid alkaloid, both retaining it and driving it into vapor. This trapping<br />effect also permits the pipe to be simply set down, then picked up<br />and reheated, as needed.<br /><br />There is little to no loss with The Machine and for some unknown reason<br />we have reliably found this pipe to be smoother on the lungs than<br />many far less efficient devices—particularly the glass “crack” pipes. The<br />amount of alkaloid that this device is capable of delivering must be experienced<br />to be believed. The bottle can be reused but the steel wool<br />should be replaced regularly. While The Machine works with many<br />materials, extracted Acacia alkaloid is highly recommended. — Justin<br />Case<br /><br />Note: Having recently tested The Machine, I give it my highest endorsement.<br />Previously the “burned plastic” taste and seared lung feelings from smoking a<br />regular DMT pipe had caused me to abandon smoking as an approach to ingesting<br />DMT. It was simply too painful and I never got a big enough hit to experience<br />much effect, frequently coughing out too soon the hit that I did get. For whatever<br />reason, vapor produced by The Machine wasn’t nearly as rough as that<br />smoked through a normal DMT pipe. And man, does this pipe deliver a punch!<br />— DAVID AARDVARK <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				So I build today my machine. I put the 50mg dmt upon and start to gently heat the neck so the dmt would melt in it.<br />So far so good. Then I started the vaporization. I hold a normal lighter almost 2cm away from steel wool and in seconds white vapor starts coming. (the optimal distance between the fire and the wool is what?)<br /><br />I begin to inhale slowly while stopping the vapor progress. I hold it. Again the same, inhaling stopped due to coughing. I mean this smoke is really hard after the first one. After some seconds of breathing I start again, this time I did the mistake to push the lighter closer and maybe at the steel wool. Got a little bit of burn in my lips. I couldn&#039;t take any more, the is too heavy for my lungs for today. <br /><br />In the first minute I kind of had some &quot;visuals&quot; only when my eyes were closed (or it was placebo) but nothing else, lied in my bed for 30 minutes completely out of energy. :( <br />After this back to completely normal.<br /><br />This is really hard for a beginner I have to admit. And the vapor is indeed harsh, have to get use to it.<br /><br />Been thinking the idea of sniffing 50+50, but I don&#039;t know. I am not used to sniff stuff, only few times coke. People say it is really painful but it works. Any thoughts of that?<br /><br />Except the difference in quantity, is there&nbsp; any difference in the tripping progress?

				:) you shouldn&#039;t be coughing ::).. and that white smoke, is smoke :P not vapor, (you don&#039;t see vapor ::))<br /><br />when lighting, I use the lighter directly the neck of bottle for a moment, then remove heat, relighting it for a second or two, in intervals of 4-6 seconds.. your trying to heat the metal not the dmt ;)<br /><br />if you have weed an a pipe you could always go for the sandwich method, but you&#039;ll waste alot this way :(<br /><br />you&#039;re better off perfecting the machine method.. its really a matter of 1) proper lighting, 2) proper inhaling (slowly an steady) an HOLD THAT SHIT IN!! 3) time for blast off :)<br /><br />also, changa is another option ;)

				1. Be sure to torch the brillo before using it, elsewhere you toke toxic smoke.<br /><br />2. Which type of brillo are you using? Copper or steel? Steel is much easier to use for a beginner, copper transfer heat much more strongly and as such it is easier to burn the DMT with (but when you know how to use it you can vaporize the DMT even better, it is just more difficult to use at beginning).<br /><br />3. The toke should be slow and steady; DON&#039;T go in forceful lapses, the vapor will turn into smoke and it will be harsh. Slow and steady is the primary concept here.<br /><br />4. YOU DON&#039;T NEED 50 mg with The Machine. It is counterproductive. Start with 15 mg the first try (some suggest to even start with 5-10 to learn how to do it properly). This because at beginning you will anyway waste DMT no matter what, secondly because if you burn a lot of DMT it will be a lot harsh - the less you burn the better you will be able to tolerate until you learn, thirdly because you don&#039;t need more than 20 mg to breakthrough if you vaporize correctly and you want to learn how to do it, fourthly because if you don&#039;t vaporize correctly ALL the DMT a resin will remain in the Brillo that changes the trip by and by the more it stands there. Always use the less DMT you can, NOT the contrary.<br /><br />5. Don&#039;t pack too much the plug, let it be a little loose. If you press it too much it is easier to burn the DMT.<br /><br />6. Hold the vapor (or even the smoke if you have to because you burned the DMT) at last for 10 seconds, elsewhere you will feel much less of an effect. If you cough immediately it will not make any difference if you vaporized 50 mg or 5 mg, you will feel almost nothing in both cases.<br /><br />Lastly (but not in order of importance) DON&#039;T SNIFF FREEBASE. You will only waste DMT and make you sick in the process. Learn to smoke it, it&#039;s not difficult with The Machine. IMO the only great error you have really done is put that much of an amount to try. At beginning you cannot cope with it without coughing because you are going to burn much of the DMT and if you aren&#039;t used smoking (as with cigarettes) it will be a lot harsh.

				Make Changa my friend!!&nbsp; It never fails, and you can smoke it just like herb right out of the pipe.&nbsp; So you do not have to worry about that, give it a shot!&nbsp; :D

				Changa is a little different than freebase. It&#039;s really worthy to try too, but it is still not exactly the same as freebase.<br /><br />It&#039;s not difficult to learn at all, especially with The Machine. The error the majority of beginners make is that they use A LOT of DMT when it&#039;s not necessary and this will naturally (because they aren&#039;t used to vaporize correctly) cause the DMT to turn into smoke and with a lot of DMT that means a lot of harshness. If they used 10-15 mg even if they burned some they would surely acknowledge it but it will not make them cough or similar things.<br /><br />It is just a matter of doing it 2-3 times and you become an expert. Just start low, the lower the better, so you learn how to vaporize it correctly in the process (that anyway is also good to integrate yourself with the experience; going from 0 to a full breakthrough I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a so good idea).

				adamiz I haven&#039;t even tried DMT yet and you&#039;re making me nervous as I plan to make the machine and try soon.<br /><br />If the smoke is harsh then it is smoke not vapor from what I hear.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this is an issue with anyone but I don&#039;t have much experience smoking anything except for maybe a 100-200 cigarettes in my lifetime.&nbsp; I currently have some marshmallow/mullein leaf and I&#039;m practicing pulling the smoke into my lungs rather than just my mouth.&nbsp; I figure if smoke comes out of my nose then I breath out then I was successful whereas if it comes out my mouth then I wasn&#039;t successful.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s right though.<br /><br />If I don&#039;t have any luck with the machine then maybe I&#039;ll just put it in my butt haha.

				1. it vaporizes when heated, so ::) (you just don&#039;t want smoke, so if you think your smoking air, thats good :)<br />2. begin inhaling immediately, but very slowly.. slowly as possible, as a very relaxed slow breath tho<br />3. you heat the neck or direct to the DMT for a moment to melt it yes, then flip the neck towards the ground an begin heating directly to the metal &#039;brilo&#039;/&#039;metal scrubby&#039; briefly ;).. I like the way BlackIris explaind it :P<br /><br />you&#039;re very welcome :), best thing you can do is share the information with others :).. pays it forward! :D <br /><br />you have a fun ride ;) and a good day/night aswell :-*

You need a little bottle, as a tabasco sauce one or a little alcohol shot one, of 30ml/50ml, max 75ml. The larger the bottle the more probability the DMT will re-crystallize in the glass, and being the neck large you need a big plug that doesn&#039;t transfer heat as efficiently (will burn on top and it will be cold on the bottom). Also in this case the little the better. The password for The Machine is: little is better - in every point.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1309034#msg1309034">Quote from: adamiz on July 06, 2013, 02:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Maybe it will be embarrassing and stupid to ask, but is it okey to use normal kitchen steel wool?

Start anew with a little amount.<br /><br />Also be sure to melt the DMT good so that it goes inside before beginning to smoke. Don&#039;t let it just turn into a &quot;gum&quot;, let it liquify and turn into an oil so that it goes correctly inside the mesh. In this way it will be impossible for it to burn, no matter what (the amount that goes inside you cannot burn neither if you want to, not with steel). Btw also for this it is not a good idea to use a large amount: it&#039;s almost impossible to liquify it completely without burning some, much will remain in form of a paste on the surface, mostly at the sides (or the center, depending if you heat the neck&#039;s glass or you heat the DMT from above).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1309034#msg1309034">Quote from: adamiz on July 06, 2013, 02:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1.

It&#039;s impossible to describe in words but when you have inhaled both smoke and vapor you will understand the difference. They taste and are consistently (in the mouth) different one with the other.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1309034#msg1309034">Quote from: adamiz on July 06, 2013, 02:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.&nbsp; If I can&#039;t see it, when shall I begin inhaling?

Yes, there&#039;s a difference between air and vaporized DMT (it has mostly to do with consistence), but the very first time it can be tricky to acknowledge correctly. If you don&#039;t feel the difference just close the lighter to the wool until you feel hot air coming, then gently step a little back. With experience you will be able to tell immediately if it is just air or vapor. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry too much about burning the DMT: with a little bottle (and so plug) it&#039;s very difficult to burn DMT even if you put the flame directly into the brillo and keep it there, the only amount it will burn is just the little it remains in the surface of the brillo when you melt it, that&#039;s a litte thing. The motive why you had all those problems it is both for the amount of DMT you used and both for the largeness of the bottle (and hence the plug). Given the high amount of DMT and the large surface of the brillo, the DMT that remained in the surface (and so that could burn) was a lot (much more than normal) and so it made you cough.<br /><br />With a little bottle and normal amount of DMT this cannot happen because the amount you can effectively burn is very very little. You can either forcefully try to burn the DMT, you will not be able to do so in a meaningful amount: the DMT that&#039;s melted inside in form of oil CANNOT be burn (especially with a steel plug, with copper yes, but anyway you will have to use a torch lighter for it to happen), no matter what. That&#039;s the beauty of The Machine (and in particular of the brillo mesh).<br /><br />Many (the majority) when they use The Machine simply put the lighter (a normal one) touching the brillo and&nbsp; take a slow and steady toke, and that&#039;s it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1309034#msg1309034">Quote from: adamiz on July 06, 2013, 02:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.

Hm, definitely going to make a new one cause it make my hole in the side. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can hold it horizontally or vertically, both works. Some people prefer to use it vertically - fully at 90 degrees, or very close to it - putting the flame below the brillo, others prefer to use it as a normal crack pipe (or cigarette), horizontally with the flame put perpendicular to the bottle and almost touching the brillo at the neck. It is a matter of preference mostly. In both cases the point is on having the heat being sucked inside the brillo by the toke (along air) so the DMT vaporize correctly in all the surface of the plug.<br /><br />But in reality all these explanations can make it see the process as elaborate when it&#039;s nothing of the sort. It is quite straightforward in practice, much more than using a light-bulb or oil burner can be. As I said it&#039;s very difficult to burn the DMT with a brillo even if you put the flame on the brillo and keep it there. You burn only the amount on the surface that in normal circumstances it is too low to cause any trouble (but in your particular case it was, instead, enough to do so).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1309034#msg1309034">Quote from: adamiz on July 06, 2013, 02:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Will be here present until rightly done! hehe<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you have some questions after your next try feel free to ask, but I&#039;m sure you will become good at it in no time. Just start with a little amount and you will have no problems because also in the case you burn a little the DMT it will not be so harsh (given the little quantity) as to make you cough, that&#039;s the most important thing you have not to do.

Stone isn&#039;t the cleanest you can find. That&#039;s why your wool turned black. I am telling this because I did the same. But after I saw it turning black I said to myself, &quot;come on, you can do better than that&quot;. So I use a torch lighter for this part. Really effective.<br /><br />As for the dose, I leave it to the experienced ones. Just friendly advice, try not to waste it as I did. At least I learned for the next time. <br /><br />Adamiz

				I had success in building a good machine yes. I had a private discussion with BlackIris and the bottom story is that I did it correct but thought that vapor would be colorless and every time I saw white vapor I stopped . So yes the dmt vaporized correctly but unfortunately didn&#039;t end up in my lungs. Hope the mosquitoes had a good night :)<br /><br />Ordered 3 days ago 100mg more and will test it the upcoming weekend.<br /><br />Now, nothing can be wrong.

				Ok, it is time to resurrect this thread again. But without any successful review to share. Again questions... I will write it as it happened. Sorry for the length and language usage. Not my main language.<br /><br />Let me start with some new details.<br />I did a lot of research and got a LOT of help from BlackIris and I think I have pretty much become familiar with building, loading and using the machine.<br />My last try was before 2 weeks and it was about 25 of DMT from a vendor I tried. Since then I bought a digital 0.01 scale, have began (eventually!) to put myself in the path of meditation and general body and mind exercise and also I managed to buy 0.5 grams of Multiexciter&#039;s DMT.<br /><br />Only in my last try did I succeed (kind of) to vaporize me dmt correctly. Had done many mistakes in my last tries but eventually I thought I got it. In all my tries I just felt tired for 15 minutes and didn&#039;t move much. In my last try, (number 6 maybe) I had some nice visuals when I had my eyes closed and&nbsp; for some minutes a crazy body feeling. I was touching my hair, arms face and my sense of touch went lunatic. I felt really connected with my body while realizing that&#039;s was the first time I appreciated my body. Not that I don&#039;t like my body, but more like a sensation of separating my -soul/psyche- if I could say and saying to my body &#039;&#039;thanks for hosting me&quot;. Anyway that was it. 5-10 minutes after I had smoked it, I was again lying for maybe 5-10 minutes on my bed and then back to standing and moving mode. A first minor success. Could wait for the next one.<br /><br />So today my letter came from ME with the dmt. This time I decided to try again while being in a warm forest. (btw it was 20mg).<br />&nbsp;I will not discuss about this try because it was a failure for many different/not relevant reasons. I had high hopes though..<br /><br />After this event I can say I started to think a lot about why I didn&#039;t succeed. Again the excuse -I convinced my self- was that I had the flame of my bic light on the brillo. So after 5-6 hours I decided to try again. Will try and describe it in very descriptive and analytic way, so it maybe help you find where I am wrong.<br /><br />I have just cleaned my 75ml glass machine and changed the brillo. I put it a little inside in the bottle for loading. I weight 30mg of dmt and put it on the brillo. I ignite my bic lighter and slowly slowly heat the neck of the bottle without the flame touching the brillo and the dmt. It melts inside and again despite stopping heating it some very little white smoke (or vapor) comes for maybe 1 second. Now that I think about it, I still don&#039;t know if this is usual or a first mistake I still do. Your thoughts (?). Until now, I was advised to let the brillo come a little bit out of the neck before starting heating it. This time though I place as it was in the loading phase. Just few millimeters inside. <br /><br />So I prepare myself first. I tend to change as many varieties I can until I success. This time the setting was a dark room with a candle behind me and for the first time without music at all. A usual problem until now is my first toke. I find it hard to have a first long one. So every time my first toke stops before I am ready to cough. I ignite my lighter and this time I focus in holding the flame 1-2 cm away from the brillo. White smoke starts coming out inside the bottle. I must say that keeping my lighter in this distance produced less vapor. Anyway, I start inhaling slowly and steady. Stopped after 4-5 seconds cause my throat felt like it, and after one second I continued little more. I keep it long enough until nothing but air come out when I exhaled. Took 1-2 breaths and continued for my second toke. Smoke come in less amount now and I had to move the lighter a bit left and right in order to start. Longer toke but quite sure less of vapor. I take also a third until nothing but hot air come out of the bottle. <br /><br />I lie down while knowing I have control of my body and I am fully aware of where I am and what I do. Again this time some visuals, kaleidoscopic as the last 2 times. After maybe 3-5 minutes I had only tiredness again, after 5 more minutes back here full back to normal body state, rolled a joint and starting to write my desperate text for help. <br /><br />My friends, what do I do wrong? Is it the whole procedure or could it also be my mind state? <br /><br />I don&#039;t know why but until today I never gave a try to read the thread&nbsp; Inter-Galactic Brotherhood of Deemsters (DMT Review Thread) dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.0<br /><br />I guess I change my mind when I see how big topic this is. Anyway, started to to read it all day, almost in the middle by now but still I can&#039;t find where do I make the mistake.. Btw it is an amazing thread with lots of info about this &quot;hard to feel&quot; substance. <br /><br />All yours again,<br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />P.S. I don&#039;t want to change the method of the machine. :)

				Again sorry for the length of this message. I can be boring sometimes I know. :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1391614#msg1391614">Quote from: RS7FI8ZRkm on July 30, 2013, 12:47 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">maybe you should just go for the sandwich method already :P..

That crossed my mind and if I am going to it I am thinking of putting some ash in my glass oil pipe some dmt and again ash. But for the moment I will continue with the machine method.<br /><br />As for how I hold the hit I try as long I can which can vary to 10-15 seconds. I am not really sure about this duration but anyhow all the times I succeed to exhale just air. My breath keeping actually good. I think the problem is how long I can inhale. <br /><br />Now its time to state another attempt I just did.<br />After 4 hours I decided to make try another time which is my 3d in 10 hours. Foolishly and greedy (will stop this from now on) I decided to raise the amount of dmt to 40mg. <br />I prepare again the machine and do some mind clearing for a 20 minutes. And so I start. First inhaling quite good, not as long as I was hoping for though. Second one, pretty much the same duration if not longer. This was going good and there is more to vaporize. Take a few breaths and begin my 3d toke. I saw at this point that the vapor was much thicker (this is good or bad?) and unfortunately after 2 seconds, all of the sudden without any throat warnings, I coughed. I was really disappointed to see so much smoke escaping. Tried to take another one when I could but the was almost nothing left.<br /><br />Well. Despite this huge loss, I actually had the strongest experience until now. Some minor vibrations when I was looking at my slightly lighten room and some nice thoughts visuals which I will try to describe below. First of all I would like to add something for maybe understanding and be clear about this mini trip. I was again aware where I was and I am pretty sure that those things that I visualized came guided from me and&nbsp; I think of this experience more like a placebo and guided visuals. I believe also that all the below visual story was really affected by all the reading I did today in the Inter Galactic Deemsters Dmt thread.<br /><br />So again it started, with this familiar at this point, kaleidoscopic colors. During this moment I am starting to thinking that maybe with all this colors I can try and picture what I want to see and imagine. I do it also some times with even weed. Close my eyes and starting shaping lines in my eyes/mind. Anyway, I don&#039;t know how it happened but&nbsp; being really affected by many dmt trips I am starting imagine something in a female form. I saw that she, which I made up in my imagination was there. I loose control of what she will do and she keeps saying come come, not enough, come, hm not enough. I am pretty sure that this also made up by myself in a way of criticizing my failed attempt. Then I am placed somewhere very high and feels like free falling although I know that I am very stable and only my surroundings are going up. Imagine free falling but the center (me) is nailed and doesn&#039;t go anywhere and it is safe. In continuation of my self criticizing I added in that scenery some evil entity. I loose again control of what it will do or say and it is just coming back and forth in my face and just laughs sarcastically. <br />I opened my eyes few times during that just to check out where I was. In less that 10 minutes the colors and visual had dissolved and after 20 minutes in total I am again up fully energized back to normal...<br /><br />I can&#039;t make the perfect long tokes yet, so that&#039;s why I will try and make as many as possible. That third toke that was missed was a big one. Which brings back the question I made before.<br />If am correct, I think I saw pretty well, while making the 3d toke, the white smoke/vapor was really thicker than at least the first one. Is that a good or a bad sign?<br /><br />Lessons of the day, will keep practicing taking longer tokes, I didn&#039;t like the fact that not only I tried 3 times, I kept raising the amount from 20 to 30 to 40mg. Will try to resist doing it tomorrow and try to keep a slow pace and from now on will keep the dose to 30mg. What do you think?<br /><br />I succumbed to the temptation of succeeding a &#039;breakthrough&#039; I can say. <br />In my country we have a quote which can be translated like this:<br /><br />The one who is in hurry stumbles into shit...<br /><br />Adamiz

				get a bong, thats the only way to smoke DMT. i was going to say with ice water, but i&#039;ve not actually tried that and it might be too cold and cause the vapor to recondense.&nbsp; it&#039;s way too harsh any other way I&#039;ve tried. vaporize it, don&#039;t burn it, when you see it melt and start boiling that&#039;s enough heat, much more and it will start to burn. use the least heat you can to keep it boiling off. then hold the vapor in as long as you can. much different to smoking weed. more like smoking meth or crack, if you dont have experience doing that, you should probably keep it that way. except DMT is much more harsh than either of those

If you want to put the flame at a distance you have to heat the mesh a little before start toking, elsewhere it will not produce enough vapor because it will take a little while for the steel to transfer the heat inside all the mesh (and the amount of time it takes depends on how much of heat it is applied) and when the DMT in oil form starts to &quot;flee&quot; from the heat source it will just condense away instead of vaporizing if there&#039;s not enough heat. <br /><br />With a copper mesh it is a little different because the heat transfer is a lot more (ranking of thermal conductivity at 300K, in Watts/ (meter degree Kelvin) or W/mK - 401 copper, 16 stainless steel; copper transfers heat 25 times more than stainless steel) and so you have to be attentive to not put the flame too close or the DMT will burn, but with stainless steel the thing is almost the opposite ( there is a little of confusion especially in clearnet on this point just because different people use different type of meshes and they write tutorials given the mesh they use and so, naturally, you can assume the explanations are contradictory when in reality it is just a matter of material used; tutorials of people in the US, that usually have Chore Boy as a brillo, so a copper mesh, obviously always advise to never put the flame directly to the brillo, but the thing changes depending on the material you use).<br /><br />Do a little try: try now to put the flame directly to the brillo and toking steady and long but without keeping the vapor inside your lungs at the end (exhaling immediately). You will see how much vapor there is still there. You have probably inhaled just 15%-20%of the total amount.<br /><br />With a stainless steel mesh and a normal lighter you don&#039;t have to be cautious with The Machine about burning the DMT, it will NOT happen. On the contrary you must put the flame directly to the mesh and keep it there or you will not vaporize all the amount you have (and the less amount you have the more this is true; if you have 50 mg or more you can also go the way you go because also if you waste a lot you will still have effects, but with amounts of 30 mg or less you must learn to vaporize correctly); this or you pre-heat the mesh a little, but IMO it is better to just put the flame directly: it&#039;s true, you will probably burn a little amount (the little that is on the top layer and that has not gone inside, but we are talking here of something like 1%-2% of the total if you melt the DMT properly inside when you charge) but there&#039;s less hassle and on pre-heating you will inevitably waste that same very tiny amount on the process anyway.

				So, just ended another session. No success in &#039;breaking through&#039; but gave some ideas and questions once again.<br /><br />I load on my machine with 25mg of dmt. Today I realized that my scale isn&#039;t so good but anyway. About 25mg was it.<br /><br />I want to add in that point that music has a great effect in my &#039;energy&#039; if I may say this and psychology. Especially electronic lounge/ambient/etc.<br /><br />So I make some breathing exercises (I don&#039;t know if there is way to do it correctly but anyway I just take long big inhalations).<br />For music this time I put some Buddha Bar playlist.<br />The new thing this time was that before starting, I exhalde all air from inside me. Really good advice by the way from liquidator. Never thought this simple little detail...<br />The brillo a bit out, the flame on it and I start the inhalation. First was good. About 4-5 seconds. I felt already the effects. <br />But during this moment the music really got me. Maybe I shouldn&#039;t be saying this because it is a characteristic of me and must remain as anonymous I can be, but it isn&#039;t so rare I believe. I tend to flow and move every time I hear music. Even if by moving I mean perhaps my head, legs. Fingers though are always active. So when the slow beat of the music got me, I start dancing with me arms and fingers. My scenery was changing in a sense that I could see where I was but everything was getting more color and geometrical lines were added around all shapes, I am still holding my first toke, while &#039;dancing&#039; with my arms and fingers. <br /><br />The reason why I mention music and dancing in this post is because I want you to understand fully what I am talking about, plus I can write what I want in these forums without any hesitation :) <br />When listening to music and especially when I dance, I always have this feeling of being alive and the strange feeling of superiority above everything. Sounds a bit peculiar but that&#039;s what I feel and I don&#039;t see why I should hide it. <br />So while I was still holding my first toke, I start to make &#039;fun&#039; of dmt and &#039;challenging&#039; it. Usually I have a massive respect towards substances and I didn&#039;t &#039;challenged&#039; it in an irrespective way. I was saying to it &quot;I am here, still alive and dancing! Are you able to stop me?&quot;&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I exhale and take another one. Still dancing. I wanted to have my eyes this time constantly open. Things are getting more trippy.<br />Made also two more smaller tokes even though in my last there wasn&#039;t anything left. Will not describe more of the trip because it was like the others, without breaking through. <br /><br />But during my second toke I just came up with an idea that I want to ask before trying.<br />Before this I want to ask a question. Do I have to take all tokes one after the other? Can I have some 5-10 calm breaths after I exhale, or there isn&#039;t &quot;time&quot; for this?&nbsp; I always until today had the feeling that I have to do it quickly, exhale and starting the next toke immediately. Today I rethought this point and feel that I don&#039;t have to rush. Don&#039;t know, that is why I ask you.<br />The idea is to put more dmt on the machine and after one toke, I take some breaths to prepare my next. Then, if I feel like being in position to take another one I will do it. Keep this going until I can&#039;t any more because at last I am in front of the &quot;gates&quot; :)<br /><br />Now I know that when it comes to dmt, too much of anything regarding the whole process isn&#039;t good. I know that Black Iris will maybe disagree with this idea but hopefully he will guide me again correctly. <br /><br />So, my questions are:<br /><br />1. General thoughts about this idea. Taking in, until not being able to do so. Good or bad?<br /><br />2. This is silly maybe but it really troubles me a bit. Am I &quot;allowed&quot; some seconds of relaxing after each toke? Say for example 10 seconds?<br /><br />3. (Important one) If indeed you put more dmt on the machine that means that you can take more tokes or does it mean that your vapor will be more &quot;strong&quot; or even if you put too much it can be less effective? I don&#039;t intend to try the following, but I will ask this just to understand better the procedure. If someone puts for example 50-100 or even 200mg on the machine, what will be the difference? More trips, or its is gone/burned within 3-5 tokes?<br /><br />Well that&#039;s it for today. <br />I have started to feel a bit guilty about writing so much and constantly asking questions about small details. But then again, no one forces anyone to read it or not. And it is true that the best way to learn is to ask. So if you feel like adding your opinion and enlighten me it would be more than appreciated.<br /><br />All the best and good night/day.<br /><br />Adamiz

				Wow, adamiz, I used the bulb pipe (freebase pipe) method, and it worked perfectly the first time. I will add that I used just enough then and later times to get a bit of a &quot;lift&quot; as I&#039;m using a propane torch from the hardware store, and I have a fear of knocking it over if I get too high. I have been thinking of the &quot;pot sandwich&quot; method, but just haven&#039;t gotten around to it yet (burnt DMT tastes really bad). I will have to re-read this thread a couple of times as it is full of very useful info on vape machines.<br /><br />Anyway, adamiz, just keep on keeping on...

But the max is still being able to take all the amount in one single toke. With 20 to 30 mg is perfectly doable and assures a breakthrough at lower doses.<br />Alternatively the technique of McKenna that prescribed to take three hits (of about 10-15mg everyone) in single tokes one after the other it is also very good. After the &quot;single toke&quot; it is probably the best approach to ensure a breakthrough at lower doses. The only drawback is that you need someone to change charges for you on the run or have three different pipes loaded. But with The Machine you can sort of simulate the thing by charging the total amount and dividing it in three successive hits.<br /><br />You can wait a little before the next hit, just don&#039;t wait a full minute and you will be fine.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1395753#msg1395753">Quote from: adamiz on July 31, 2013, 03:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.

For example if you charge 5 mg in one and the next 15 mg a single toke will have more DMT in it in the second case. But there is a plateau to this; if you charge 50 mg and then 200 mg the difference will be only on how many tokes you can make because there is naturally a limit to how much DMT can be vaporized in a single &quot;go&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1395753#msg1395753">Quote from: adamiz on July 31, 2013, 03:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have started to feel a bit guilty about writing so much and constantly asking questions about small details.

				Another thing:<br /><br />Try to use The Machine both vertically or horizontally because different people have more success with one or the other, because it depends on your natural way to breath and to what you are more comfortable with.<br /><br />If you use The Machine horizontally then simply put the flame at the opening of the bottle perpendicular to it, slightly touching the glass, exactly as you would light a cigarette. When you toke the flame gets absorbed inside and it heats the mesh. <br /><br />If you use The Machine vertically then try to put it the most vertical than you can and put the flame below, touching the brillo with the top of the flame (the hottest part of the flame is naturally the top; this is true also for the previous method, as in putting the top of the flame to the opening and not the bottom - as for the height of the flame, I always use a flame of about 2-3 cm, not less, because I&#039;ve found out that a low flame doesn&#039;t work as well). If you hold it vertically it is best always to wait just a little before start toking (I usually count &quot;one thousand, two thousand&quot; and then go; when you do this however don&#039;t yet touch the brillo, do it only when you begin to toke).<br /><br />In both cases it is always best to toke in progression, as in to slow then moderate then strong at the very end (and at this point you let go the flame) because if you go full force immediately, when the mesh is not heated well yet, you just waste your breath and go out of it before DMT even starts to correctly vaporize, so start low and increase as you go on. If you go with full breath from beginning you can also risk (in this case yes, even with steel) to burn the DMT if you have good concentration and lung capability since you bring a lot of heat for a prolonged time and all at once, so not giving the metal the ability to heat in steps.<br /><br />An usual toke should last about 15-30 seconds but when you are experienced you can go on for much longer, I can for example do a toke lasting more than a minute (in reality it is much more a matter of concentration than lung capability; if you are concentrated on toking and don&#039;t start diverting your thoughts with doubts or similar as in &quot;oh no! I&#039;m starting to go out of breath&quot; you can go on much much longer than you would think possible). The toke must be steady and as long as possible so correctly empty your lungs before beginning to toke. Also, when you are on keeping air into your lungs, bring more fresh air in (also when you think your lungs are full they aren&#039;t; just release the tension a little and then bring it more air), this ensures better capability to hold the breath for long and it also help on absorption.<br /><br />In reality the process is very simple. I tried both methods and I prefer myself to keep The Machine horizontally but I know that many people prefer to use it vertically. So try both and see what you think is best for yourself. If you use The Machine horizontally the toke is the most important part because the quantity of heat is dependent completely on your air intake as the flame gets sucked in by yourself (much similar to how a GVG works, and for this I prefer this way, being myself accustomed to using a GVG), while if you keep it vertically the most important part is the distance of the flame to the brillo and heating it a little before starting toking. For keeping The Machine horizontally IMO is best to put the brillo inside the neck a little (as in 2-3 mm, but not too much, not more than 5mm) while for keeping it vertically I usually prefer to keep a little piece outside (and for this I advised you to do this, because I assumed you used The Machine vertically), but anyway it changes little in this last case, it is mostly a matter of preference.

Wow that&#039;s something new I have to work on. My main problem until now is that I can&#039;t take so long tokes not because I am out of breath but because after maybe 10 seconds I feel that I will cough. Sometimes especially during the first toke, I start inhaling, then after some seconds I have this coughing feeling. I stop for 1-2 seconds and continue again my first toke.

Going to buy again some menthol gum as you have suggested before to enhance the inhalation. I will put 35-40mg but the plan for the next try is not to vaporize it all but try and make those long tokes. If again I can&#039;t take big tokes I will continue inhaling until I can&#039;t any more.

				I usually dose 60mg and call it a day ;) I, Like Black Iris, do the machine horizontally. I prefer steel wool as opposed to copperof the bic lighter and always burn it thoroughly until it glows before inserting in the machine (manufacturing impurities burn off-nasty shit) 1cm below to start and close in to the mesh as I here the spice start to sizzle and I can feel the vapor. If you taste burning spice just back off .5cm and continue. A lot of times I won&#039;t get the whole 60mg but when I put the pipe down (hot pad on my lap sitting in lotus style) it&#039;s because I cant even see it anymore and I can recover the residuals spice later. <br /><br />I understand the frustration of misfires. My first dozen times were nothing compared to now. The DMT Nexus site has some great Changa and enhanced leaf recipes. here is a simple no-solvent recipe that looks so easy. I am going to try it soon. https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=39132

				Hey, read through the whole thread thank&nbsp; you everyone for all the insights so far. I was wondering about experimenting with using a glass pyrex test tube to vaporize the dmt and use a tube (or a glass pipette) to inhale the smoke directly. I know with this method it would probably be safer in terms of not burning the DMT, but would it be enough to vaporize and inhale (using a&nbsp; torch lighter)? I don&#039;t know if there would be enough air flow or not, not too good on the physics of pipes :D

This is copied from a personal message I have send.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;I had a strange night this night involving some emotional anxieties and problems, lsd and dmt.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I can call this breaking through, but honestly I don&#039;t care any more. I was not off in another universe or experienced any kind of trip reports that I have read. All these reports that describe being in places or ego deaths are beyond me and I can&#039;t reach them until now.<br /><br />Anyway, long story into short. I realized these days that I am in a really bad psychological position. The last month was a total disaster but I kind of didn&#039;t see it or tried to hide it by persuading myself that I am ok. Dmt came then into my life and I am sure I become obsessed with it and all my thoughts were there. My mind have played some really ugly games the last 2 weeks. I can&#039;t breakthrough, I don’t have the need to be out and meeting new people which is one of my weaknesses and most important of all&nbsp; I have found myself two times not able to perform sexually (today was the second one) just because my mind fucked me up with silly thoughts. This particular fact had me destroyed. I was always considering myself a sex god until before 1 months where I had my last girl. <br />Today this wonderful new girl I have meet last 2 weeks, that I have started to feel something, comes and we take my last 2 LSD tabs. Again after 1-2 hours and while the effects of lsd has started I got stressed! First time that I am high on lsd and I can’t focus on the beauty of everything. Fuck, I feel shit to say this but I couldn&#039;t even get a steady hornyness (up,down,up,down) and just kept kissing and etc,etc. I never had something sexual while on lsd but from what others say it is an experience really strong because as you know your senses while on lsd are on a very high level. I was touching&nbsp; her and kissing her very smooth but I wasn’t there. I was alone with my negative thoughts and again saying to myself how fucked my mind state is. Fortunately (I don’t believe I actually say this) she had her period so she stopped me saying &quot;damn it would be perfect if we had sex on lsd but I can&#039;t so stop&quot;. We haven&#039;t done it by the way until now. <br />Anyway, I don&#039;t know why I write all these again. Sorry! <br />So another friend comes and we just relax all night at my place. The lsd trip was really different from all before. I just couldn&#039;t feel happy and had constant thoughts about how fucked I have become all of the sudden the last month. My friend, I just realized then, that I have stopped to love and appreciate myself. I always tell myself that I am the best but the last month I wasn’t believing it. 5 hours later I am finally alone. I know this is time for me to try and think about my current messed mental state. I decided to go out at the sunrise and go into a forest that I have found nearby with my bicycle. Need some fresh air and some positive energy to escape this mental prison I am in. I am on lsd anyway and there is a chance that I will feel better if I just go and let my mind free in the deep forest. I stayed in the forest about 2 hours. Going all over the forest “playing” with all the nature, the sounds, the little animal. I just embraced life again. All went good. Not quite peaceful, but it was a necessary thing to go out and just let myself in the arms of nature. God how strong nature can be!<br /><br />I went back home and decided to try the combination that many talk about and vapor some DMT while tripping on lsd. (It wasn’t at the peak as it was 6 hours before I took it, but still having the positive energy that you have while on LSD).<br />&nbsp;I load 40mg on my machine and take it all with 2 tokes.<br />I can&#039;t really remember all the details and it is very very hard to describe it in words. But will try anyway since I have already typed some much bullshit&nbsp; <br /><br />I said to myself and to the &quot;dmt&quot; &lt;&lt;Okey I believe I am ready&gt;&gt;.&nbsp; An female&nbsp; entity I have seen the last 2 times is again there. This time the scenery is colorful and a bit stronger. It&#039;s center has some kind of algorithms and symbols that I try to understand. I am there, in my room with my eyes closed and having hallucinations. I know am there and once again I know I am not going to breakthrough. The colorful entity is also there with me and this time I felted something really strange and new. &quot;She&quot; was waiting me and kept me company. She wanted me to see into my problems, my troubles. She was just singing in a strange language and was staring at me as if she wanted from me to do something.All of the sudden one by one, all of&nbsp; my&nbsp; negative thoughts, problems and emotions came up. I was feeling like going really deep in my soul. Every problem was in a existing material form in the sense that I could not only feel them but also see them (I can&#039;t describe it better right now but I was looking to my feelings and thougts as if they were small circles). I was erasing and destroying every one of it. She was there, looking at me fighting with my mind.&nbsp; She was there finally happy and not scary or disappointed from me. As this kept going for a long time I felt more and more released, more free again and built again my self respect and mental welfare. This particular point of the trip was really strong. I was seeing for the first time myself.&nbsp; She was there and told me every time not to care about such silly problems. All those algorithms around her were exploding into huge lights everytime I managed to look delete consciously my negative thoughts that has been so deeply rooted inside me without even knowing there was such a deep part of me or even that there was a mulfaction there.&nbsp; She was kind of singing to me that&nbsp; it is me that it is important, not my problems. It is me myself who make these mental obstacles and it is again myself who is in charge of overcoming them and not fall under them. <br /><br />It isn&#039;t breakthrough one would say because the way I see it breaking through is on a state where you look like taking a nap. I know my body was there with me because I can recall my body. The trip ended after 10-15 minutes and I find myself with tears in my eyes and just giving kisses to her while saying dozens of times thank you and thank you.<br /><br />This was really deep my friends. Nothing I have ever experienced before. Going into and seeing into my inner soul and deleting all those problems from the core of myself, while having &quot;her&quot; next to me was a fantastic experience! I don&#039;t know if this was the combo with the &quot;leftovers&quot; of lsd and honestly I don&#039;t care about breaking through. This was what I needed at this point of my life and will stop with daily use of dmt for now. I have the respect of it I had before starting being obsessed with this so called breaking through. I am sure it is an amazing experience but I can&#039;t find anything right now that can be more amazing than finding myself again. Maybe an ego death as you all good people say will help, but for now I don&#039;t feel I need it. I feel really alive and happy again.<br />I really loved my today trip. I wasn&#039;t just seeing stuff, I learned something from it today. And I guess that is what all experienced users are talking about. It is not just visuals, it is a way to go inside your own ego and find pieces that you never knew you had. Maybe lsd was the key, maybe not, maybe the vibes from the forest, maybe not those as well. In any case, dmt today helped me a lot!<br /><br />Have a nice day my dear friends<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Adamiz

				This is a great post adamiz, really useful information here for others of us that haven&#039;t tried DMT. I have been considering it myself and am thinking of the &quot;sandwich&quot; way for the first try, but don&#039;t think I am ready yet :) <br /><br />Does the &quot;sandwich&quot; way take you as far as vapourizing ? or is there no difference ?<br /><br />Great info from everyone that has contributed here :)

				Yes DrWalter! I believe this thread contains very detailed information for first time users. Some small details are very needed.<br /><br />As for the sandwich method. One thing I would not suggest is mixing it with cannabis. It makes your trip blurry.<br />The best method to vaporize your DMT is with the Glass Vapor Genie but this little thing costs a lot. You can try built a machine which is super cheap and very effective as well. I wouldn&#039;t suggest using a oil pipe (meth pipe) because those methods are extremely difficult to use correctly. People tend to burn their DMT.<br /><br />If you have a bong I would also recommend to have a look at the so called &quot;enchanted leaf&quot; aka changa.<br />Some say that this is a better and easiest for the lungs way to smoke DMT. Here is a clearnet link for this.<br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=3539<br /><br />I am going to try this and maybe stick with it cause I have seen lots of positive feedback from using enchanted leaf. Plus I like the idea of mixing my DMT with herbs and smoking them on a bong.<br /><br />Good luck with everything <br /><br />Adamiz

I read some people are putting it between two layers of cannabis in a normal bong but this is even better as you a) don&#039;t have to get high/stoned if you don&#039;t really want to and b) the ash should protect it better because it does not burn anymore like the weed would do.<br /><br />Maybe some self-made light blub vaporizer would do it even better. But I would feel like a crack head when doing it like this. :P<br /><br />What about putting the lighter on the outside of the head against the glass so it get&#039;s hot and with enough temperature starts to vaporize?

				I haven&#039;t tried it with weed, but I would suggest mixing it. It makes your trip different, a bit blur. I did once first cannabis and then DMT and I didn&#039;t like being high while tripping on dmt. The ash surely is a better option.<br /><br />If you are going to make a light bulb, then it is better to skip it and make a machine instead. You only need to make one hole and buy some metal brillo. Super easy!

				Is there some sort of tutorial on how to make a &quot;machine&quot;?<br />Is it a low budget vaporizer or what does it do?

				You can google it... But anyway here is some clearnet links.<br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/302269-Make-a-DMT-pipe-quot-The-Machine-quot?p=4916757&amp;viewfull=1#post4916757<br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=25974<br /><br />Yes it is a low budget dmt vaporizer which works perfectly. <br />Advice avoid any kind of straws.<br /><br />It is really simple. Take a 50-100ml bottle, make a hole in the bottom.<br />Take some metal brillo (the one you clean the dishes), burn it so you get rid of any chemicals like color etc, put it on the neck of the bottle, put your DMT up there and melt it (don&#039;t burn it, just melt it inside there) and then turn your bottle upside down, light up and take 1-2 slowly and steady tokes.

If you read the instructions one time carefully you will totally get it. Spend some time reading this thread and instructions on how to built you machine and in 1 hour you will understand this is easy. If I would compare a first timer cannabis smoker and a first time DMT user, I would say that rolling a joint is far more difficult&nbsp; :P<br /><br />And as ChemCat said. Once you do it right you will never do it wrong again. Love to you btw<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Adamiz
