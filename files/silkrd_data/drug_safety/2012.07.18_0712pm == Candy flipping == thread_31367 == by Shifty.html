				Hello there, very new to this scene. Havent yet done Molly or LSD but theres an opportunity to candy flip in the near future. Should each drug be done separately first? or will a joint first experience be more memorable/enjoyable? The setting would be at a trusted friends house/outside. Also is it a waste to do Molly for the first time at home and not a concert or festival? Thanks for any help in advance ;D

				i don&#039;t know....<br /><br />if the universe is dropping a candyflip in your lap, i think it&#039;d be rude not to accept.&nbsp; just be prepared for an INTENSE trip.&nbsp; it&#039;s almost guaranteed to be overwhelmingly positive, though, as long as the ecstasy is good.

				Foreal do them separately first.&nbsp; Good molly will give you a good rush of euphoria that even veteran rollers think is still too much sometimes. I couldnt imagine candy flipping for a first time experience.&nbsp; Have fun!

				I disagree. My very first experience was a good dose of MDMA followed (immediately) by 200 ug of LSD. It was very fun because by the time MDMA starts to wear off, LSD begins to peak. MDMA removes all the traces of anxiety associated with taking something for the first time. All in all, I had a great trip.

				I would take the LSD in the arvo then the Molly later at night while the LSD is coming down. You will be able to experience the pure effects of the L for a few hours then the Molly will pick you back up and re-energize your L trip and make you feel fantastic :D<br /><br />And I see absolutely nothing wrong candyflipping at a trusted friend&#039;s house as long as it is tidy with good vibes. Just make sure to get outside too! :)<br /><br />Happy flipping!<br /><br />weedsaves

				i would stongly, STRONGLY recommend taking the acid before you take the ecstasy.&nbsp; coming down off a roll while you&#039;re tripping can get real ugly sometimes.&nbsp; please just take my word for this and do the acid first.

				You should do them separately, if it&#039;s your first time with both...<br /><br />Acid will be cool if there&#039;s nature around to interact with, molly will be awesome with friends at a festival or concert, and you can enjoy 2 separate great moments.
