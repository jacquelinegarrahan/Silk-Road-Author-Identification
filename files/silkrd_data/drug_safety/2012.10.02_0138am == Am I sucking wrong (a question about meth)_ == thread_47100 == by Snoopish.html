				So I got a VaporGenie. If you don&#039;t know, it&#039;s a metal pipe with something like a carbon filter between the mouth and the bowl to keep direct flame from touching your product so you vaporize instead of burn it. <br /><br />My question is: I tried to smoke 50mg of meth today with a fresh screen and everything. I inhaled slowly because as I understand that makes it hotter. I took several long drags like this with my breath pulling the flame in through the mouth of the pipe (but shouldn&#039;t be hitting the product). After, I removed the top part of the pipe to look in the bowl and the screen was covered in a smelly black goo. Is this normal or did the meth get too hot? I&#039;ve smoked smaller doses but never paid attention to the residue.<br /><br />I expected a little more from the experience. I hadn&#039;t had any meth (not even small 5-10mg doses) in about two weeks. I&#039;ve been taking piracetam, choline, 5-HTP (from an 80mg dose of MDMA a week and a half ago) daily. I&#039;ve never tried to smoke that much meth in one go and I feel I may have burned up some of the meth even with the VaporGenie.<br /><br />So...can anybody tell me if I did something wrong or have I just increased my tolerance to the stimulant effect through small meth doses and MDMA and methylone use? <br /><br />Cheers<br />

				Port sippers are another easy and cheap way to go. I&#039;ve been looking at the vaporizer that has the little glass chamber and thought maybe it could be done.

I wonder if it would be better or worse? The generics causing the sore throat is a concern though... I love this stuff for so many reasons and love the ritual of the smoke too. Its always fun exploring the different ways and results so I&#039;ll give the foil a go following your advice regarding the type of foil and gentleness in heating. Lol no jet lighters for the foil is what I&#039;m taking from your post!&nbsp; :P maybe its because its been such an epic week, the 3 hours sleep in 2 days or just my silliness but I can&#039;t work out ROA... LOL. I&#039;m funny with amphets in that speed/gas/gack I can&#039;t sleep on at all and almost always have that &#039;why did I bother and fuck I&#039;m pissed/agro and sketching&#039; thought the next day or 2 but Ice/clean meth I can almost suspend the high, sleep and wake up whenever I need to (1,2,3 any hours) then resume the high and charge on without a top up. Like today I was still running on last nights fuel all day but had what felt like a restful sleep, albeit a short one due to commitments early in the morning, with No sketch, edge or anything...<br /><br />BanDit

				Just thought I&#039;d share my meth experiences...<br /><br />I started out on foil and then found this vacuum ehrlenmeyer flask that works great!&nbsp; It&#039;s pyrex of course and of a medium wall thickness (1/4&quot; or so).&nbsp; I stuck a chopstick into the vacuum end which sticks out perpendicular to the flask and serves as a handle.&nbsp; On top of the flask, I placed a two hole stopper.&nbsp; One hole I use as a carb (alternately placing finger over hole or just leave open) and the other hole I inserted a flexi-straw through down near the bottom so the end of the straw is about 1/4&quot; from the bottom of the flask.&nbsp; This creates better suction.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t noticed any melting of the straw or stopper.&nbsp; <br /><br />I drop in a small rock about 15mg.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed any bigger and it doesn&#039;t vaporize as well.&nbsp; I use a small tealight to heat the flask near the rock.&nbsp; The two hole stopper keeps most of the vapor inside the flask.&nbsp; I wait for the rock to liquefy and for a small amount of vapor to appear before inhaling through the straw.&nbsp; I found that you shouldn&#039;t hold the flask closer than 1/2&quot; or so from the flame or the meth will burn (carbonize).&nbsp; (Note: Meth boiling point is 216 degrees Celsius and a candle flame can get up to 1,400 degrees Celsius).&nbsp; <br /><br />With gentle heating (as soon as you see vapor back off from flame a 1/4&quot; or so), the entire rock will disappear into vapor with very little loss as one would get with foil.&nbsp; The residual meth condensate on the sides of the flask can be gently heated as well from the outside and inhaled.&nbsp; So I would say generally this is a fairly efficient way of smoking meth.&nbsp; The flask should be washed every 2 to 3 times as residual meth will eventually carbonize and impart an unpleasant taste to the vapor.&nbsp; <br /><br />As always, I recommend taking a small dose of a benzo for the tachy.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks, <br />p.l.u.r. G<br /><br />p.s. - not sure if port sippers are borosilicate glass, but might be dangerous from a shattering standpoint.&nbsp; <br /><br />p.p.s. - just wondering, what&#039;s the longest anyone&#039;s stayed awake on meth?

				Yeah I&#039;ve used flasks on a temp controlled hotplate, a stopper setup much like your but glass straw of sorts that was custom made by the owner of the setup to curve towards the person using. 2 things though; This dude had ALOT of gear and basically had a puddle that covered the entire bottom of the flask and was about a cm and a half thick.... and if I&#039;m honest after the novelty and wow factor wore off I found it a pain in the ass to use. Lol kept my opinion to myself though cause free meth is after all free meth! seemed rude to poo poo the dudes setup while he was being so generous. <br /><br />This actually leads me into the 2nd ps and with this setup going we went for about 5 days no sleep at all followed by about 3 or 4 hours disturbed sleep and another 2 or 3 days of just smashing gear... it gets kinda blurry after the sleep and there has been much debate about the 2nd runs length though I thought 2 others have told me 3 and a half! Was just before a couple year break from the stuff and the comedown was fucking epic and the worst thing I&#039;ve been through. I felt changed at my core for a good month after. Regularly have done 3 - 4 days over the last 2 years though and find that&#039;s the limit for me. Just get so fried and the best you can hope for is a numb fog after 2 days imo. The random acts of randomness while funny at times can do a lot to a guys credibility too I&#039;ve found.<br /><br />With the port sippers I can tell you 100% they work fine. Owning a pipe in my area is a no no with LE and it can only be got by mail order. If its dishwasher safe its usable as a smoking device I&#039;ve found... just smoke you need to have more care than others. Lol as I say though crystal is a no no! If I&#039;m honest I&#039;ll only use a sipper in the rare occasion I&#039;ve dropped and broken my pipe and haven&#039;t got a spare ready to roll... like hens teeth these days. :-)<br /><br />Oh the only other thought I had about using lab glassware to smoke with is the fact in some places just having the glassware means a holiday. Doesn&#039;t matter if its been or is ever going to be used to cook just having it is an offense with a jail term mandatory.<br /><br />BanDit

				@BanDit<br /><br />Wow, that puddle thing sounds ridiculous.&nbsp; But, even with a 50mg pebble, I found that it took a long time to create much vapor.&nbsp; If I break it up until little shards, it vaporizes much more easily although you do have to go through the trouble of reloading your flask.&nbsp; But jeez, how much was in that flask? An 8ball?&nbsp; Sounds like he was really at it, but I can see how his setup was really sophisticated.&nbsp; I like the idea of the temp controlled hotplate....are those expensive?<br /><br />I&#039;m still fairly new to meth, my true fav is h, but I&#039;m starting to get into stims.&nbsp; C, PV, and Tina.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone as long as 2.5 days, but can honestly say it&#039;s not that great.&nbsp; The first day was what I would describe as an almost calm alertness with some euphoric aspects.&nbsp; But by the second day, it was more like frantic, I gotta get stuff done, mania.&nbsp; The positive side is, my house has never been this clean before!&nbsp; lol...<br /><br />I almost always talk to myself when I&#039;m alone, but not much, just a sort of comment that I blurt out like I&#039;m having a conversation with myself.&nbsp; But the second going on third day, I was sort of rambling non-sense to myself and it sort of scared me.&nbsp; I was getting paranoid.&nbsp; I took some Xanax and that helped alot.&nbsp; The come down was about 15 hours of sleep and feeling like a zombie.&nbsp; Took about a day or so to recover. <br /><br />That sounds pretty strict regarding the pipe and/or lab glassware even for the LE around here.&nbsp; Most of that stuff is available on the clearnet as other things.&nbsp; Even snuff boxes you know?<br /><br />Thanks, G

				Well, looks like I was way off my base. I thought vaping DMT would be like vaping Meth. I haven&#039;t tried doing any since this fiasco but I guess I have to find a new method. I&#039;m considering just buying a cheap glass meth pipe and being done with it. In a pinch, I&#039;ll be sure to try the foil method though.<br /><br />Thanks for all who chimed in!

				the vaporgenie doesn&#039;t burn up DMT also?&nbsp; Seems like that device was meant for pot or tobacco.&nbsp; Something that is pretty sturdy and would need alot of heat to vaporize whatever was in it.&nbsp; The ice I been getting (from drpvmd) as well as I assume from most vendors is pretty pure and doesn&#039;t need alot of heat to vaporize.&nbsp; <br /><br />on a side note, I notice I need at least a good half dozen big huffs that produce a good size vapor &quot;cloud&quot; to start feeling the effects.&nbsp; That being said, I think I could probably go through quite a bit of ice if I was not afraid of the consequences...<br /><br />stay safe,<br />G

				Sorry for taking so long to reply goldfibre1 <br /><br />Easily a 1/4 oz in the flask.... ground up to fine powder before being &#039;set&#039; in the flask. I remember thinking it was going to be shit and full of cut. I was wrong.... Dude added heaps to it too over the days but that first charge lasted ages... Good times now I think about it. I think anyway... kinda hazy on some details... was a time of excess in my life. :-D<br /><br />Yeah without sleep your brain can&#039;t restock and balance the chemistry up there. Your body heals while you sleep and only while you sleep in many cases so yeah the loss of focus and feeling frantic is just a self preservation thing. Rationing the little that&#039;s left and keeping you as alert as possible. The talking to yourself about random shit is the brain misfiring and your subconscious coming out to say hi and poke around a little!<br /><br />Xanax is wicked for the comedowns BUT be careful with them. A few peeps I&#039;ve known have had &#039;sleep walking&#039; like side effects when they have taken them on top of meth. Its like their conscious was shut down but the auto pilot was still running. The worst case was a mate who opened every draw and cupboard in this place, spilled his gear, broke 4 (yes 4!!) pipes and came too face down in his laundry with a tub of chocolate powder and a spoon next to him. The stuff you add to milk. Has no recollection of any of it and still doesn&#039;t. His girl was freaked out big time and I was really worried too. Happened a few times to various different extremes. Be careful huh.<br /><br />Never been into opiates myself but have had a long and deep relationship with stims over too many years now. Know my limits and optimal dosage to be normal enough to function and fly under the radar in polite company but still getting the focus and order that I&#039;m missing without the stuff.

Like yourself mate I&#039;ve been told everything from don&#039;t even inhale the first puff but put your thumb over the hole of your pipe and blow softly letting the vap bleed out around you thumb right through to suck long and hard, don&#039;t bite ;-), and hold till you literally can&#039;t hold anymore. What I&#039;ve worked out over time is that the exhale quick people usually have shit gear thats cut allot and the hold it in people have the solid lovely shard goodness. The don&#039;t hold people are usually the less academic types too. In example the thumb over hole dudes had shit gear and what their technique did was force the cut out and you would end up with a white snow ring on your thumb that was absolutely cut and supposedly only gear left in the pipe.. Its an interesting way of using pressure and the changes that makes on boiling/condensing temps and the different boiling and condensing temps of meth vs the cutters.. not that they had any clue about that side of things but they just knew how much shit was being put in their gear and somehow worked out this technique.<br /><br />Another way to look at it is this; the more the gear cools the more that condenses back into vapor and the more its staying in your body.... I&#039;ve started having a cold drink standing by and after the charge up and quickly cooling the pipe with a cloth wet with luke warm water (still resets its super quick but doesn&#039;t crack the pipe) and having a drink WHILE still holding the gear in. Blow out nothing after and so I&#039;m confident I&#039;m getting max bang for my buck. Been doing this way a fair while and not noticed any new health concerns or anything and have been feeling like the bags are lasting longer and I&#039;m getting higher from the smaller amounts... Having said this I started on the best gear possible then circumstances changed and was getting average to below average for a bit and believe I&#039;m now back to Very good to extremely good quality stuff so while I was getting the poo I started actually doing the thumb thing and must say the headaches from the cut and the &quot;dry&quot; brain feeling was greatly reduced. Its actually an awesome way to test for cutters too... you can&#039;t mistake it when they are there.<br /><br />I was surfing around looking and the new gen bongs the other day and had a brain wave... Fuck bongs have changed from the ones I knew as a young teen growing up... Anyway so the wave went like this;<br /><br />So the new bongs and such are moving towards vaporizing the weed or oil and then cooling to make it thicker and smoother and more effective for the smoker. We are vaping the meth which ever way we smoke it and so why wouldn&#039;t the techniques be exchangeable? Well in fact they are. There are even devices sold as bongs that you can use to smoke meth straight up (little devil is one) so I grabbed my pipe and made a bong from a plastic bottle and it.. <br /><br />&nbsp; __<br />_|&nbsp; |_&nbsp; &nbsp; _<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;/ _|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|/ /<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/&nbsp; /<br />|__/_|<br /><br />Best i can do with a demo! was awesome and smooth but felt like I was wasting heaps. So then I remembered the bongs and pipes with the colour liquid in a chamber around the main shaft going towards the mouth piece. So off I went and got some fabric and cut some strips, wet them and froze them. I can say that these wrapped around the stem of my pipe while smoking it normally has given me stupid thick amounts of vapor and am so fucking high...Gonna make like a sleeve for my pipe I reckon with that gel-pac shit for sports injuries in it. Been looking at those Hurricane bongs too and thinking that using them without water may be a winner too. I used to smoke the residue off my pipe but found it burnt allot and was too ghetto looking for polite company so have started using alcohol spray to wash it out and into a glass vial and then evap off the alcohol to regain the gear. smokes like a boss too.<br /><br />Haha 2 things to note from this post;<br /><br />1) Its fairly obvious I love the ritual and experimenting side of the rec druge taking scene and believe in no wast and clean stuff into your body<br /><br />and<br /><br />2) I am really smashed and have about written a fucking novel. <br /><br />hahahahaha<br /><br />No sketch either... typing that fast and only issue is mis fired key presses meaning spelling issues. Focused and feeling clean though so I&#039;m def going to keep at the cooling the smoke down before it gets to me and holding it as long as possible.<br /><br />BanDit

				The only thing I&#039;ve noticed is that meth vapor will stick to anything that is cool.&nbsp; So in my little flask set-up, as the vapor collects and climbs up the wall of the flask, it starts condensing and forming a thick translucent coating.&nbsp; If there was a &quot;condenser&quot; around the pipe on the way to your inhalation point, I think more of your ice would stick to it.&nbsp; When I condenses on the sides of my flask, I just have to heat the flask where it condenses and the ice coating is revaporized.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve started to pre-heat the walls of the flask before heating the ice so that less vapor sticks to the sides.&nbsp; But it eventually collects there but less quickly.<br /><br />The massive rips are possible with this set up because the flask can heat up enough to keep the ice in vaporizing mode so that as you inhale the volume from the flask, more vapor is being produced.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been able to exhale large clouds, which now I try to hold in as long as possible to allow more time for absorption.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed the longer you hold, the smaller the exhaled cloud which I&#039;m assuming is due to the fact the cloud recondensed onto the lining of your alveoli.&nbsp;
