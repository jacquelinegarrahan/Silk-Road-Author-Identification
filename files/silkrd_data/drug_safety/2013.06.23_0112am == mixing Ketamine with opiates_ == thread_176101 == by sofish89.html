				is it safe to mix ketamine while i was on heroin? Not a such a high dose of heroin that I&#039;m nodding out, but a small bump of heroin innsufflated for a bit of euphoria and mixing that with a little bit of ketamine?<br />Anybody ever tried this combo?

				Safety of this combo highly depends on the dosage of each substance. Keep in mind N-methyl-D-Aspartate antagonists like ketamine will drastically potentiate the effects of the opiates, in addition to potentiating the euphoria it also increases the risk of respiratory depression. Just be careful and keep the dosages of both substances relatively low until you are comfortable with the effects and understand how the substances interact with eachother.

				does ketamine increase respiratory depression?<br />so does that mean it is a CNS depressent (a downer) ?<br />I always thought ketamine to be more of a psychedelic than a downer in that sense..

				^^ It is not a psychedelic, It is a dissociation anesthetic. Psychedelic implies it acts as a 5ht2a agonist, ketamine acts on NMDA receptors.<br />While it causes much less respiratory depression than other anesthetics (and is used in hospitals on children for this very reason), It can in very high doses cause some degree of respiratory depression.<br /><br />The mechanism by which it causes this is much different than with downers. When in a dissociated state you are generally not aware of your breathing, you can kind of forget to breath or breath irregularly. While not really dangerous on its own (as even if you where to pass out, you would resume normal breathing immediately), when combined with opiates I could see a potential danger.<br /><br />Keep in mind that at low doses of both substances (especially the opiate), I don&#039;t see a massive contraindication here. Just be careful and start low with both substances. You can always add more drugs, you cant remove them.
