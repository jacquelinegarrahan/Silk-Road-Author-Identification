				hi Flavourful, Adderall can mess with your sleep and eating habits if you are not careful - just like Meth. Just take the minimum dose needed to stay focused and you&#039;ll be ok =)

				That stuff is pretty much prescription meth, and it&#039;s amazing. If I had had it in college, I wouldn&#039;t be selling drugs on the internet for a living :P <br /><br />Be careful though, its addictive, like coffee.&nbsp; I sell most of mine now because the demand is ridiculous here, but I always make sure I have a couple in case I need to get shit done or be super social.&nbsp; Shit&#039;s amazing when mixed with alcohol or benzos or weed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t do that though, its irresponsible.<br /><br />(Edit: Also, if you have the choice, go with dexedrine instead of adderall.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit rarer but it&#039;s much smoother and far better for staying focused.&nbsp; Adderall tends to be jittery, like caffeine.&nbsp; Of course, that might just be personal preference, but I feel like most of the people who&#039;ve tried both prefer the dex.

				I love Adderall but seirfmuy is right, it made it hard for me to go to sleep at night even after I crashed from the high. And I found that when I first started taking it food sounded so unappetizing but you have to make yourself eat and drink plenty of fluids or you&#039;ll probably have a nice headache.<br /><br />Now on to the worst part, at least for me. The crash at night was horrible the first couple of weeks I was taking it. I felt devoid of most emotions except sadness and extreme emptiness, really depressing. That pretty much went away after I got used to it.<br /><br />I was taking it for adhd, twice daily until my blood pressure got the better of me. So my experience above is based on that, ymmv. I only took it for fun a couple of times, going well over the prescribed dosage and I didn&#039;t have any of the above issues though I was usually up 36+ hours and when I crashed I just went to sleep with the help of some xanax or clonazepam.

				I don&#039;t see it being much use for reading unless you&#039;ve already mastered the art of speed-reading.&nbsp; It&#039;s more for writing papers, organizing things, cleaning, doing problem sets in math or physics, that sort of thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Reading takes a different kind of focus, more of a sit-back and absorb information type of thing, whereas the focus you get from amphetamines is a &quot;get shit done&quot; type of focus.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know though, maybe for super ADHD kids it helps with reading too.

				flavourful, yeah that&#039;s common but if you have it prescribed your doc might do a few things to help that. They can adjust the dose, maybe an XR or two early followed by a small IR in the evening to avoid the crash. Some of them prescribe benzodiazepines or something like that for the evening crash. Those are real addictive though. But for the crashing, took me about 2 weeks to get used to it and then it was gone.<br /><br />invisible, some of the people I talked with had the same issue, they said they truly had adhd and this meant that the dosage wasn&#039;t right so they got it adjusted upwards.<br /><br />

				I can read for hours and hours on amphetamines unless I take too much. Then I get antsy and can&#039;t sit still for too long. My friend was prescribed 60mg a day so 5mg to 10mg might not be enough depending on your reaction to stimulants. Keep increasing gradually 5mg at a time until it works. Only use them as needed unless you get a script. They are addictive, but if you keep the dose as low as you can and only take occasionally, you probably won&#039;t get hooked.
