				I just got some DMT for my first time, I didnt break through mainly because the person I was with kept talking and distracting me&nbsp; &gt;:( (although I did feel like I was at the threshhold), anyway, my question is how long should I wait before I try to attempt a proper breakthrough? I understand this is not a recreational drug, at least in the sense that I don&#039;t intend to make it a habit just because I enjoy it. I just want to walk away from the experience with some positive &amp; fresh perspective. So how long before I try again? Any feedback is appreciated!<br />Also, is it safe to do it alone, or will I need a sitter of some sort?

				In my experience and opinion DMT is safe to do alone. Alot of people will disagree because of the intensity. Personally try and wait atleast a week in between DMT experiences, but have heard of several people smoking it daily. Pretty sure tolerance dimenishes within 24 hours though.

				You&#039;re fine doing it alone because of the short duration - if you freak out, the feeling will be gone in five minutes, which is probably quicker than the time it would take a buddy to calm you down.<br /><br />Also, you could literally do it again in an hour.&nbsp; There&#039;s very little tolerance issues with DMT.

				DMT is broken down really quickly, that is why the peak is so short. Tolerance isn&#039;t an issue really once you have broken down the DMT fully. You can probably dose again for the same effect after an hour.<br /><br />However, many people find that repeated quick dosing results in more negative experiences. This is certainly true for me. I leave a day at least before another big dose.<br /><br />There is no problem though say having 15mg smoked correctly as a warm up. Your brain will be expecting the hit then, making a second go after about 5 mins for a full breakthrough easier. Buy a glass vapor genie and pre prepare doses. Smoking technique is the biggest barrier to breakthrough in my opinion. Get a GVG for maximum efficiency, you will breakthrough with smaller doses and with cleaner tokes. <br /><br />Check out www.dmt-nexus.me on clearnet for really good advice and information on DMT use.<br /><br />I have no problem with people buying DMT on SR.&nbsp; But most people on the nexus do, they argue that dealing in the drug makes it a target for law enforcement unnecessarily. I agree that is true with street dealing, but SR is different. You can make DMT really easily though and all chemicals needed are legal. As is the bark that has the DMT in it. But SR provides a service I think to those that can&#039;t make for it some reason. <br /><br />So if make an account don&#039;t mention that you bought it. Say a friend made or gave some to you. They treat the molecule as a sacred practice. In some ways I now do as well. But there is some good advice on there.<br /><br />Many people just trip on it, but it has the potential to change your life too. Ingesting it is another world, much much smoother and controllable to an extent. But then you&#039;ve got to start learning about MAOI, diet and simple drug interactions.<br /><br />Welcome to the spice club!&nbsp; ;)<br />

				I enjoy vaping it in the morning as part of my daily meditation, it&#039;s quite soothing and let&#039;s me know how the rest of my day will be. I&#039;ve had no tolerance issues to speak of and I&#039;ve gone through half a gram in a day with my sister at one point so you shouldn&#039;t run into a problems either. Personally, I find it more relaxing to vape alone because I don&#039;t trust people and they make me anxious during the trip. Personally, if my friend interrupted my trip I&#039;d break their fucking jaw. Anyways good luck with trying to breakthrough, just don&#039;t expect to much because I think it&#039;s bullshit what people say about finding mystical answers to life and ridiculous shit like that during their trip. It&#039;s enlightening for sure and you&#039;ll come to realize how small and insignificant you are as a human, but in the end it&#039;s just another drug and what you see while under it&#039;s influence shouldn&#039;t be interpreted as the truth. ;)

				i don&#039;t think anyone could really say what the DMT experience is, which is why people say its a mystical experience.&nbsp; its something which cannot be explained, or fully understood.&nbsp; I also get annoyed with the recent wave of people who&#039;ve tried DMT (post 2006, the year &quot;DMT For the Masses&quot; was written) who think they KNOW what dmt is all about.&nbsp; nobody knows.&nbsp; making a religion out of it is stupid because then you&#039;re just creating yet another belief system...like gary oak said, another box outside of the box.&nbsp; no more boxes, i say.&nbsp; DMT is bonkers, and thats pretty much the long and short of it.&nbsp; how you use the experience is up to you
