				Googling around there are a lot of threads comparing these two but I don&#039;t get a clear sense of how they differ. A lot of purists put down 25i, etc. I&#039;d be interested to hear from those who have done both what the differences are, especially on heavy trips.<br /><br />I get that acid is safer but it&#039;s alot more expensive.

				For me, 25i is just purely visuals and no head fuck whatsoever. Also, I noticed there is no after glow from 25i.<br /><br />On the other hand, LSD leaves a nice after glow, where I feel really at peace when I am coming down from it. Introspection is a good pass time for me, when tripping on LSD, but 25i doesn&#039;t have the same capabilities. Of course, this is entirely subjective, so others may feel different about 25i than I do.<br /><br />To summarise, I think 25i is a completely soul-less drug. That is why I have only done it the once.<br /><br />Interested to see what other people have to say :)

				25i is fun, but the experience is less spiritual comparing to LSD. Nice body buzz and very powerful visuals. (3 mg). With piracetam or ketamin it is much more enjoyable.&nbsp;

				hey when i tried 25i for the first time ive experienced far more visuals than lsd but i didn&#039;t have this cozy feeling in hands and stomach like lsd gives.. <br />if you ask me than 25i is a new drug and people still don&#039;t know exactly what are the short/long term effects , ive experienced some really serious headaches after use and some problems with sleeping witch i never had from lsd - as far as what goes stick with LSD it&#039;s far better and safer :)<br /><br />

				hailsatan I find it interesting that you experience loss of sleep on 25i but not lsd.&nbsp; I never can sleep after taking L, even from one strong tab I am up for at least two days.<br /><br />The first time I took 25i it was at 1000ug and it put me on my ass.&nbsp; Very intense visuals that I have never experienced before and a strong sexual desire.&nbsp; I remember being so fucked up that I was thinking to myself, &quot;this is the definition of drugs, this is what its suppose to do&quot;.&nbsp; I did a little meditating on it as well and it was effective for that.&nbsp; I fell asleep but unfortunately woke up to a bad part of the trip.<br /><br />I took it once again and had a completely opposite effect, I believe because I was not in the best mood when I took it.&nbsp; I will be trying it out again soon to get a better picture of it, will update.

				they are absolutely nothing alike! 25i has been known to cause unpredictable negative reactions. it&#039;s much more physically harmful than lsd. i wouldn&#039;t take that stuff again even if it were free. if you can&#039;t afford lsd, maybe try some 2c-b. i don&#039;t think that&#039;s killed anyone.

				I like 25i, music sounds great with it, some visuals, and I am extra social and creative. I think 25b would be a better cheap substitute for lsd though. Visuals, introspection, and spirituality seemed to be much more enhanced on 25b than 25i, at least for me. 25i still wins for music though over 25b IMO.

				I&#039;ve only done 25i twice, and I&#039;ve only done LSD once, but I&#039;ve done some pretty heavy doses of shrooms (4-5g on a few occasions). For me when I did LSD it felt really similar to a high dose of shrooms, although I felt more in control. Now as far as 25i goes, personally I don&#039;t like it. It&#039;s okay fun but to me it just seems like its missing something. That and it seems that a small percentage of the population has very weird/unpredictable reactions to this stuff, which is also why I won&#039;t be doing it again. I mean if you can get this shit for $2 a blotter, it&#039;s probably not as great as LSD or shrooms (:<br /><br />I would say 25i is more of a party psychedelic where as LSD I would never even attempt to take it in a party type situation (too many people, unpredictable behavior), on 25i you&#039;ll just laugh your ass off the whole time, whilst on LSD that could be a little uneasy and hard to handle for some people.<br /><br />But yeah I&#039;ve only done LSD once and I don&#039;t remember the trip very well so take all this with a fat grain of salt.

				I&#039;ve taken both, and it honestly depends on what you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />If you want a nice trip that gives you spiritual insight, some visuals, leaves you feeling connected to the world and yourself more, LSD is what you want.<br /><br />25i is, as mentioned before, a party drug, definitely. MUCH more intense visuals than LSD (at least for me), more intense body load, no real after-glow, no insight into yourself. It&#039;s straight up what you take when you still need to (semi)function, but want to trip BALLS. Personally I LOVE 25i, because the trip is amazing for how cheap it is. But if you&#039;re looking for a trip to connect you with the universe, LSD is the road you wanna go.<br /><br />I would honestly suggest just trying both of them, and judging the effects for yourself. Both are readily available here on the road&nbsp; ;)

				LSD is all-around better. nbomes are a little less &quot;soulful&quot; than standards like psilocybin, LSD, 2C-B, or DMT, as one user mentioned.<br /><br />However, if you are just not ready for the depth that LSD offers, 25i-nbome can be friendlier waters.

				LSD was an &quot;RC&quot; that stuck. trust me, NBOME of all kinds are awful. one of my best friends was hospitalized from 1.5 tabs of 25b. i like 25i but i will resist to taking it due to the love for the sacred molecule

The stuff is especially dangerous because there is so little consistency of dosages per tabs. Tabs can range anywhere from inactive to near lethal doses (I&#039;ve heard of 3mg tabs going around). I&#039;m not sure how the market is on the SR, as I have no interest in it whatsoever, but I would use extreme caution still. Unlike LSD where you can take 100x the active dose and be physically unharmed, accidentally taking a double dose of an NBOME can make your heart stop beating. Absolutely terrifying stuff.

				25i is poison. proceed at your own risk. quite frankly, you&#039;re better off trying 2c-b. it&#039;s a lot more enjoyable and much less harmful.
