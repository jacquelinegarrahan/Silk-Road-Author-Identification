				Buy an Erlich reagent test. They can be purchased on the clearnet and will detect the presence of LSD.<br /><br />One can be used on over 100 different samples for approx 2 BTC+shipping. PM me if you want the link.<br /><br />Happy tripping,<br />weedsaves

I ask because even though the components have been written about to death, I&#039;ve never seen the proportions of each. I would love to prepare it myself, but failing that, if I could at least by Keller&#039;s reagent, I would be ahead.<br /><br />goblin

				Haven&#039;t seen any Keller&#039;s goblin. I bumped the thread where I found the cheap Erlich. It was started by Tryptamine titled &quot;Dirt cheap reagent test!&quot;. They also have Marquis. Maybe they can put together a Keller&#039;s for you, special order?<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />weedsaves

				The link above sells Marquis as well. Same price. I thought the purpose of the Marquis was for MDMA testing tho. <br /><br />Dwarfseeker, are you saying that one should test for LSD with an Ehrlich and a Marquis reagent test? For what purpose?

I use them all the time. There manufactured by a company called M.M.C. International B.V.<br /><br />Also if you use diazepam (Valium) You should get an V&amp;R Presumptive Test. Ordering test kits is piss easy.

				Yes, there are many other indoles yet I cannot think of one that could fit on a blotter paper and still be even close to as psychoactive as LSD. Can you think of any? I don&#039;t believe DOxx or nbomes are indoles.

				5-MeO-AMT could fit on a blotter in active doses, and is an indole I believe. but you can also adulterate, reagent tests don&#039;t tell you the levels of the substance just the presence of it.. <br /><br />dunno, there is a sadly small amount of good information out there about these things, usually just rumors spread by people that don&#039;t know better.
