				Idea:<br /><br />Put dose of DMT in a sealed non-plastic bottle. place bottle in the oven at 350f for several hours. DMT boils at 320f, so it should be completely filled with vapor... with no burning!<br /><br />Then remove cap and put on a cap with an open hole and a pen tube, inhale through pen tube.<br /><br />

				Never actually tried it, but from what I read it&#039;s pretty simple.&nbsp; Just dissolve your dmt in a solvent (like acetone or ISO alcohol), and leave it in a dish with your herbs or whatever, put a fan over it until it is completely evaporated and you&#039;re good to go.

				Vaporgenie is the only way to take DMT. Your device would probably have a lot of condensed vapor accumulating on the sides of the bottle.

From what i heared alot of people put a small layer of cannabis (or any other random herb) beneath the DMT + like 10 screens inside the bowl. How&#039;d you do it&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;ve done that, but it&#039;s better to just put the crystal on. You don&#039;t need 10 screens, 1 or 2 is probably enough. You take almost all of it in the first hit and hold it until no vapor comes out.

				Nice idea but have you ever actually used an oven? :P<br /><br />If your bottle does not explode from the hot air inside expanding;<br /><br />Notice as soon as you open the door a huge gust of HOT air rushes out almost burning your eyes out (if you don&#039;t get out of the way lol)<br /><br />And now imagine trying to inhale that air.. That is what is going to build up inside your bottle (again if it doesn&#039;t explode first) but wait, it gets worse; that scolding hot air is now filled with an extremely basic (alkaline) vapor that now also has built up a lot of heat energy.<br />its just not practical. Even if you attempt it, once you open the bottle to put the cap on you can breath from. The sheer PRESSURE built up inside from the hot air expanding is going to blow all that precious vapour out in a second.<br /><br />The vapour genie/freebase pipes work so well because you are drawing nice cool air into your lungs at the same time and the air that is heated does not have enough time to build up the heat energy that is inside of the oven even though your filament/screen gets hot enough to vapourize the DMT.<br />Heat energy does not equate to temperature. Its why a tiny cup of tea cools down a lot quicker than a big cup of tea.<br /><br />Solution:<br /><br />If you are having troubles smoking your DMT i would strongly suggest making &quot;The key V2&quot; it is definitely as good as the rediculously expensive Vapour genie and kicks the ass of the over hyped &quot;machine&quot; and knocks socks off standard freebase pipes.. (sorry lasagna75)<br /><br />Go here for the tutorial on how to make it/what parts you need. But i strongly recommend that when you buy the bits and pieces to go the extra mile and buy stainless steel fittings. Or at the very least it must be the &quot;lead free&quot; brass fittings. its still very cheap to make (I picked up all the bits for about £10)<br /><br />Reminder: do not go to this site with your tor browser.. use the clear web!<br /><br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=12092<br /><br />Enjoy! and keep up trying to think up new ideas. someday someone will find just the most fantastic method and we will only get there by lots of trial and error!
