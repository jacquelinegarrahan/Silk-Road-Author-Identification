				How strong are visuals and body high on 550ug of NBOMe ? Is it pretty strong like monster visuals and great body high. Im looking to try some and wanted to get massive visuals. Any input from experienced people?<br /><br />Also which one is the best out of these for what i am looking for ... 25I-NBOMe , 25C-NBOMe&nbsp; , 25D-NBOMe?

				I&#039;ve only tried 25i out of the NBOMe family and it takes 2000Âµg+ for me to really have an enjoyable experience on it. Overall, it&#039;s fun and euphoric but seems pretty bland compared to darn near every psychedelic I&#039;ve tried. Let&#039;s agree that I am very tall and very thin, to give you an idea I&#039;m much taller than 6&#039; and my BMI is 15.2. Putting that into consideration, either I received some weak 25i or the drug isn&#039;t that strong because a person my size should not have to take much of anything for full effects. The vendor I got it from mentioned giving out weakened product, but never replied to me when I mentioned my experience with it so whatever. <br /><br />I have never had crazy visuals on 25i other than the average halo&#039;s and whatnot, but it makes music and nature more enjoyable. Conversation and bonding felt easier than normal. So if this isn&#039;t what you&#039;re looking for then I&#039;d suggest trying the other two. I have no experience with either of them though, so it&#039;s not for me to say. I just felt like sharing my opinion. :)

				I was just about to post the same thread, it seems this drug varies WILDLY. One person can have an insane experience on 500ug, whereas another person will barely feel it. I&#039;ve even read of the same person having wildly different experiences with the same dose.<br />So confusing.<br /><br />I&#039;m very interested in other user reports!<br />I encourage you to post them! :)<br />I think&nbsp; I&#039;ve read just about the whole internet of 25i-NBOMe.

				Tried a 1mg tab the same day I got 25 - Wouldn&#039;t say I had any visuals but there was definitely some body stuff going and some auditory enhancement. Nothing intense. Quite a bit weaker then the LSD tabs I&#039;ve had.<br /><br />Had 3 x 1mg tabs today - Shit got pretty cray.&nbsp; Some nice visuals, everything was breathing and had a rainbow hue to it. Intense body rush and tons of energy, couldn&#039;t sit still, spent all day outside doing exercise (psychedelics tend to do that to me though). Had to be outside in nature, sitting in my room on the PC felt disgusting. Went for a jog as the sun was setting and a&nbsp; storm was rolling in. Mother nature is so god damn beautifully&nbsp; incredible.

				One neutral effect 25i-NBOMe has for me is during the trip my Laptop creates this odd uncomfortable screech that isn&#039;t auditory while at baseline. It&#039;s as if machinery/technology creates this sense of wrongness, as opposed to anything natural/organic which feels...right. This confuses me though, because as far as I&#039;m aware 25i is not natural. An example of this was during my first trip on it, me and my nakama we&#039;re driving around (with a sober driver mind you, safety first) with our windows down and blasting some tunes until the music was accidentally paused. At this moment, Nature nearly overwhelmed us. This sudden silence truly made us aware of just how incredible mother nature was. Birds chirping, wind blowing, the orchards shaking, even our own breathing was intensified creating a sense of unnatural awareness and inner peace. The way I would describe this experience easy enough for everyone to understand is by comparing it to an episode of Dexter&#039;s Laboratory. If you go to this clear-net site and skip ahead to 15:00 when he performs laser eye surgery and sees the world clearly for the first time, yeah it&#039;s like that but obviously not as exaggerated. Still, it&#039;s fun to think about tripping that hard right? ;)<br /><br />http://www.cartoonlair.com/dexters-laboratory/4x07-dexter-the-barbarian-tuber-time-sore-eyes-video_372516f70.html

				I think it has a lot to do w/ how the blotters are made, Kwiktrip added something that makes the nbomes more active orally, 2 550ug had some intense visuals for me, couldnt imagine doing as much as that other guy mentioned, start slow imo

				I gave someone some 25I to sell IRL and they gave it to a friend who took too much (about 6-10mg by the sounds of what I heard). He ended up taking his clothes off and running round his street with his balls to the wind. Then he got arrested and got took to A+E. <br /><br />Summary is don&#039;t do loads of the stuff, I think there is a sweet spot because 1mg can be quite a low dose in some people but even if you feel it don&#039;t just bang loads of drips. It wont turn out good. Do 3mg at the most.

				I get some pretty OEVs on 500ug - staring at a wall i saw letters of some ancient alphabet and &quot;movies&quot; playing on the wall. Also, I can find fractals everywhere if i look for them. I don&#039;t really get CEVs, though. On the other hand, the mind trip is almost absent under 1000-1500ug.
