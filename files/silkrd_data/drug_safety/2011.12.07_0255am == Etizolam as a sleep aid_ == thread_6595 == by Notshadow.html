				Recently I&#039;ve been going down the road of quitting Mary Jane :&#039;( I&#039;ve particulary noticed that I now sleep like shit, well, actually I&#039;ve always slept horribly, but without MJ even worse. So, is Etizolam going to be an effective sleep aid for me on an occasional sleepless night, as well as a relaxation drug? What kind of withdraws will I suffer from if I use it long term, if any?<br /><br />And also, I&#039;ve found quite a few sources out of India and the UK, including one of which is that &quot;other&quot; auction site. Cheap, and considering its legal I shouldn&#039;t have to worry about ordering not on SR..Any thoughts? I wanna try it before I go buying a shit ton, especially if it doesn&#039;t work. I have a medium tolerance for

				A quick look at wikipedia turned up this:<br />Etizolam produces, especially at higher dosages, a reduction in time taken to fall asleep, an increase in total sleep time and a reduction in the number of awakenings. During tests there were not substantial changes in deep sleep. There is a reduction of REM sleep. In EEG tests of healthy volunteers Etizolam showed some characteristics of tricyclic antidepressants.<br /><br />It links to a study about its effects on sleep but I dont know the language so I can&#039;t assess the validity of it.<br /><br /><br />This thread on drugs-forum has many people commenting on its effects on sleep:<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117000

				Its an effective sedative.<br /><br />You will suffer normal benzodiazepine withdrawals after a while. Seizures etc...

				It&#039;ll be great as a sleep aid, as would be all benzos. It also frees you from anxiety and that&#039;s awesome. And then, since it&#039;s so reliable and predictable, you&#039;ll notice that you&#039;re using it more and more often and you end up developing a dependency, and weaning yourself off it will be very uncomfortable.<br /><br />As long as you only use it occasionally, you&#039;ll be fine. Benzo withdrawals are awful when they&#039;re serious, but with occasional/short-term use you should be OK. Just keep in mind that (from Wikipedia):<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[NICE] do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you do end up using it everyday for a week or two, taper your dose down rather than quitting cold turkey.<br /><br />And with how widely available and cheap etizolam is (the cheapest I&#039;ve found was 32p per pill), it&#039;s doubtful that running out of pills before you can taper off would be a problem.

				NS, I don&#039;t have any experience with Etizolam, but before you do, I strongly recommend you try Melatonin first. Melatonin is the natural hormone that makes you sleep at night, but they put it into a supplement.<br /><br />Melatonin:<br /><br />1. It&#039;s all naturalâ€“&nbsp; not some pharma bullshit<br />2. It&#039;s super cheap.<br />3. It&#039;s effective (for me, anyways).<br />4. There is almost no grogginess the next morning.<br />5. It&#039;s not habit forming.<br /><br />I live in France now, where melatonin is by prescription only, but I order it from iHerb in the States. Shipping is only a few dollars. Here is a link:<br /><br />http://www.iherb.com/Search?kw=melatonin+chewable<br /><br />They recommend one to two chewables (tastes like a mint). I never eat more than one and fall right into a deep sleep.<br /><br />Good luck.
