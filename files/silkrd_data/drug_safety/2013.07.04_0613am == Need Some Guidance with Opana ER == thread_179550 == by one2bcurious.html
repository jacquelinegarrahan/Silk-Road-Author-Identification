				So, I had three 20mg Opana ER, the concave formulations which are the tamper resistant.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was reading different methods about breaking them down and for one of them, I tried the whole pedegg, bake/microwave, freeze, and chop method.&nbsp; I am not sure how people get a usable product out of this but I ended up with something that resembled melted plastic.&nbsp; So, I threw it in some water to dissolve.&nbsp; That was two days ago and it is now mostly dissolved with a gel like substance in the water and a few white flakes sitting at the bottom.&nbsp; I used entirely too much water - probably 4 or 5 ounces.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, my first question is, should I just drink this?&nbsp; Should I filter it?&nbsp; I am not going to IV it but wasnt sure if there was any other method of administration that will give me the most bang for the buck.&nbsp; I am just looking to help with some chronic pain rather than just get messed up.&nbsp; In fact, I dont want to be impaired at all but wouldnt be opposed to feeling really good for a few hours!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />The second one I used a dremel and ground it down to as close to a powder as you can with these.&nbsp; I ended up slowly blowing that one over three days and it worked pretty well.&nbsp; However, I dont like the idea of snorting these into my body.&nbsp; I know one pill isnt going to do much but still.<br /><br />So, I have one whole one left and am curious as to if anyone has any safe and effective means of administration. There seems to be a lot of suggestions and stuff searching through the history but couldnt find much in the means of results compared to each other.&nbsp; Should I just go to a fast food restaurant and buy the fattiest meal they have?

				We just relisted 30mg and 40mg Opana. Hatter has the best tech to extract the opana from the tamper resistant ones with the E on one side
