				Hi SR people.&nbsp; I am hoping for suggestions/explanations regarding poppy tea. I recently bought 2 units (20 g each) of dried poppy for tea.&nbsp; Among the many reviews of the seller AlterEgo, most of these (including mine) only described receiving the product, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few also described using it and said it was very good with respect to the desired effect.&nbsp; One customer, however, described “unpleasant physical effects.” <br /><br />Well, my experience it was not only unpleasant but damn near the worst experience of my life.&nbsp; If you have ever had panic attacks -- shortness of breath, sweating, nervousness -- multiply that by 100, and add puking.&nbsp; Plus there was the horrible knowledge that it would go on for 12 hours or so -- and it did.&nbsp; There was no opium “high” at all unless you call dizziness to the point of falling over backward a good thing.<br /><br />I don’t know why this happened.&nbsp; I am known to react differently to some drugs.&nbsp; For instance, when I was a kid in the ‘70s I could not smoke pot, even, because for me it was a horrible paranoiac high.&nbsp; My friends only put up with me because I was a complete acid head :)&nbsp; &nbsp;(I loved that stuff)<br /><br />This was my first experience with any sort of opioid and I was SO looking forward to it.&nbsp; Well, except for prescription codeine, which I was just fine with.<br /><br />Anybody have any comments on this?&nbsp; I still have about $70 worth of this shit&nbsp; and would hate to just throw it away.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I made the tea correctly (it&#039;s pretty hard to screw up).&nbsp; I’ve heard reference to EXTRACTING THE OPIUM from the dried poppy, but don’t know if this is true, and if so, how to do it.<br /><br />Please, I am NOT blaming the seller or the product.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t know why this happened and what to do next.<br /><br />TIA to all,<br />ChicaFan

				Poppy Tea, or Doda is a fairly safe way to enjoy a mild-medium opioid buzz with very few side effects provided you respect the plant (treat it&#039;s addiction profile like you would any other strong opioid).<br /><br />A few things to consider:<br />Dosage: The dosage of the Papaver Somniferum is completely dependent on the variety/strain ( Hens &amp; Chicks, Giganticum, Afghan, Turkish White etc).&nbsp; The amount of raw opium in each pod and straw (don&#039;t dispose of the straw it is almost as potent as the pods!) depends entirely on the type of poppy. Your vendor should have told you what they were.&nbsp; A good start is 4-5 crushed pods of the Hens&amp;Chicks, or maybe one less if Turkish white, or Tasmanian/afghan.&nbsp; 2-3 Giganticum is plenty. Weigh that out and use the same amount of straw + .5 again in weight.<br /><br />Pesticides: Some unscrupulous growers will use growing hormones, or even pesticides to improve their yield. Humans can be especially susceptible to side effects of these in the form of allergies.<br /><br />Lastly: Mold and fungus grow very easily on poppy pods and straw. They are usually benign, but some aren&#039;t cant can cause many of the effects you desribe.<br /><br />CC

				you might have just done too much. i learned the same way with Heroin. the hard way.&nbsp; &nbsp; start off with smaller doses and work your way up to a more comfortable level.&nbsp; &nbsp;it can be very unpleasant if you take too much.&nbsp; Its like making kool-aid.&nbsp; &nbsp;you can always add more sugar if its not sweet enough, but you cant take sugar out if its too sweet.

				Thanks for the feedback so far.&nbsp; I found a thread to make Cooked Flake Opium (CFA) that is smoke-able and hopefully more pure.&nbsp; I intend to try that in the next couple of days.&nbsp; Will report.<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=38937<br /><br />I think is my personal physiology that prevented a good experience.&nbsp; After all, tea has been around for centuries.

				Hey,<br /><br />I forgot the password for my initial forum account (AlterEgo) so I had to make a new one to reply here.<br /><br />I am very, very sorry for your experience, but please tell me how much you took! If it was your first poppy experience, then its absolutely vital to use no more than 2g for the tea! Opiates can be deadly! I can guarantee you one thing: It was NOT fertilizers or pesticides or something like this and NO mold. The pods are grown organically by a (very small) farmer I know and change strain sometimes (no giganteum, he offers them separately &#039;cause they are much weaker). The strength of them stays in quite the same area tough. I am very very sorry for what happened and will add some warning on my product page (had it before, but removed it).<br />I hope you feel better now! Also what I do (when friends are around to watch you) is smoking weed if the opium is too strong. I feel it takes the edge of it....but don&#039;t take my word, it&#039;s just personal experience. With opiates it&#039;s really all about the dosage. An poppy tea overdose is a horrible experience, I know.<br />Please stay safe with my product!<br />Peace

				YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL !!<br /><br />On some poppy plants are insect killer chemicals and they are not good for you!<br />I don´t know which poppy&#039;s alter ego has, but i don´t think they are bad!

				It sounds like you just did too much. The same happened to me, I ended up feeling like shit and having breathing problems for 3 hours or so. I just wanted to sleep but I know if I did I may not wake up because of the respiratory depression. Try doing half of what you did next time.
