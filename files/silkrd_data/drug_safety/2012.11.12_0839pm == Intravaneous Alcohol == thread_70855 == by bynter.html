				I don&#039;t understand why this isn&#039;t more of a thing. High bioavailability, no damage to your liver, and none of those hang-overs. Most of the clearnet research I did about had the general consensus of, &quot;OMFG IF YOURE INJECTING ALCOHOL YOUR LIFE IS FUCKED UP JUST DRINK IT&quot;, even from people who had done it before. <br /><br />The only real risk I can see is how easy itd be to overdose, and about 5 minutes worth of research and math can fix that. Aside from that, wouldn&#039;t it be safer to IV alcohol instead of other drugs? It&#039;s alcohol, so it&#039;d kill any bacteria, and it&#039;s clean enough to have been approved by the FDA.

				Wouldn&#039;t you want high alcohol content booze to avoid impurities, and in this case wouldn&#039;t the alcohol act as a solvent i.e killing bloodcells aswell? I think most people don&#039;t inject it because its more or less a &quot;poor mans drug&quot; and I&#039;ve heard stories of people &quot;hooping&quot; booze and croaking for it

				I think regardless you&#039;d have to distill the vodka and then dilute with distilled water. I&#039;m sure people put worse things into their veins via dirty coke/h/meth, I think you&#039;d have to go straight I.V bag though cause a direct injection would be an easy OD. Would love to read a trip report though should you get bored and inventive one day&nbsp; ;)

				I heard that the guys from Motley Crue would shoot up Jack Daniel&#039;s when they ran out of dope. But maybe that&#039;s just an urban legend.

				IV alcohol burns like a bitch, and you&#039;re gonna need a drip cause a syringe ant enough.<br /><br />Also 80 proof will work but u will need to inject more, altho the burn won&#039;t be as bad<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And bynter, why would u distill everclear? They are talking about distill vodka to get a purer alcohol, everclear is a purer alcohol, so the whole distillation would be &quot;forgone&quot;

				You can most certainly not inject alcohol directly. Putting a shot of (pure, sterile, top quality) vodka into a vein is very likely to end badly since it will lyse red blood cells on contact causing a cloth that you would be likely to clog up the ciculation from he limb you injected it into. Its also not that unlikely that such a cloth would get stuck in your coronaries and kill you on the spot. <br /><br />Then again, there is the more realistic idea of adding a low concentration of alcohol to a running IV drip. If you would keep the levels low enough that would certainly work (think nothing over 1000 ppm), but the result would be about equal to that of just drinking enough to achieve the same blood alcohol level. <br /><br />Alcohol is actually very well available when simply ingested. Surely the liver does process it, but at a limited rate of about 1 standard unit (say, 200 ml of beer) an hour, so anything you drink faster than that ends up in your circulation. <br /><br />One thing that has been interested with is inhaling a alcohol vapour or mist, bypassing the first pass through the liver and delivering it directly to the brain. This technique is effective, but the resulting effect of being &#039;drunk&#039; is very short lived, as the alcohol is removed completely after one pass through the liver - resulting in being drunk for just a few minutes.&nbsp;
