				Is this a good combo? I wanted to take some LSD tonight but i promised my friend id go to the bar with him, so i was thinking about dropping some L after I got back, but id probably be pretty buzzed. Should I just wait til another day? I can&#039;t forsee any negative effects happening to me if i were to take acid while drunk

				very. bad. idea.<br />dont drink and fly.<br />after the third time I was told what I did the night before (which was being aggressively rude to each and everyone, known or unknown) I made the connection. its always: 1st alcohol, then acid. nothing else in a long time. so its only those two. they dont combine for me and others I have talked to. <br />Dont try this. If you do, make sure you got a babysitter with you.

				Yea, ive also heard it dont mash...but ive only heard reports of the L not really doing its thing. <br /><br />Though, a friend was tripn good, maybe 4 hours in, he had a few drinks, said he didnt feel the alcohol at all, just the L..then woke up with a hand over. Much love dude.

				would not recommend it at all. tends to be pretty unpleasant and also may dull the effects.

				Alcohol is for old people.<br /><br />LSD is for&nbsp; hippies and losers who go to &quot;raves&quot; and other drug &quot;festivals&quot;, and for people who believe in &quot;spirituality&quot; and other shit.

				I think it depends on how well you hold your liquor. Never had much in the way of personality changes from drinking if acid, other than the total inability to suffer fools that comes with drinking anyway. For me, a couple beers makes the come-up a lot smoother. Once I&#039;m peaking, I don&#039;t really feel the alcohol so much (though that did not stop me from polishing off a bottle of Jack the first time I tripped). Drinking too much early on can add to the muddling effect of the acid and make it harder to perform any task that requires multiples steps, but for some reason once I&#039;m flying I&#039;m just impervious. <br /><br />And yeah, a combo alcohol/acid hangover is shitty.&nbsp;

				Yeah I wouldn&#039;t recommend drinking and then taking lsd. However, I do love to start drinking after peaking. I can drink like a fish and have no hangover the next day.

				having a few drinks after you have started peaking or even on the comedown can be fantastic. getting drunk or even buzzed beforehand is just a bad idea though. at the very least it dull the effects of the lsd then probably heighten the alcohol leaving you the wrong kind of fucked up.. don&#039;t do it man. save the L for a special night do it with a friend or something

				I nearly always have a couple of drinks when I take LSD. I find it takes the edge off if things get a little weird. :)

				I doubt I&#039;ve ever taken LSD without alcohol but then again I have pretty good tolerance to alcohol.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to cut back on the drinking anyway though so maybe I&#039;ll try the LSD sans-alcohol this coming weekend.

				I did LSD without alcohol finally.&nbsp; My trip wasn&#039;t as fucked-up as past trips.&nbsp; Hard to say if that&#039;s related to the lack of alcohol or not.&nbsp; I probably just didn&#039;t have enough MDMA in my system.
