				Ya dude just be in an enjoyable surrounding. <br /><br />And you are experienced with coke, you&#039;ll be fine. <br /><br />Reread your first post. At the bar for sure. You&#039;ll be confident as fuck, and you can fuck forever on meth if you meet a nice girl :D

				Cant wait. I hope I get it Saturday. If not Monday will work.<br /><br />Glad meth is great for fucking I have heard this before. Coke on the other hand does not always work out, at least in high dosage.

				I wanted to go out with friends but no one was around. I ended up being in my room the whole time. Only had one friend over for a couple of hours near the beginning.<br /><br />The high was amazing better then anything I have had. The come ups from a line are sooo gooood. <br /><br />I may have did to much as a first time user tho. Snorted most of the half gram in about 15 hours and then stopped. I was up for around two days, had no food after the first line. I forgot to drink water for like 8 hours and was dehydrated. I started to hallucinate (small visuals) 6 hours before going to bed. Visuals increased the longer I was up. A shadow man come at me and scared the shit out of me. I went to bed when I felt the dehydration during sleep would not kill me. Woke up a couple times and drank more water.<br /><br />Next day felt hung over, tired, sore, and some muscles hurt. Did not feel hungry at all but did have a couple of meals. Drank lots water threw out the day and still have chapped lips.<br /><br />Being dehydrated with the comedown really sucked. Had some of the symptoms for severe dehydration. I was scared of being unable to rehydrate and have to visit the ER. Unsure if my mind was making a bigger deal out of it.<br />

				Just did 40mg up the nose (30mg with a 10mg redose 45 min later once I confirmed the high had set in (I think))...<br /><br />First time, no tolerance, is this a good introduction to meth?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also will using this cause any long term damage if I use it maybe as often as I use MDMA on average? (~once every couple months or so)...<br /><br />I like it, it&#039;s not nearly as spazzy as I imagined it to be, I feel super speeded out ...like one of those E pills with speed I used to take, but times four.&nbsp; I hope I didn&#039;t take too much.&nbsp; Oh well, looks like the house is about to get a full clean-over... FOR SCIENCE asdkfjaslfjasdf.&nbsp; Would have dropped this at a party next week but I kinda just wanted to get a feel for what to expect and how much is about the right dose.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also how long does this last intranasally on average?&nbsp;

Indeed if you read these forums, it&#039;s so important to keep drinking water, juice, whatever, do not get dehydrated. Also eat every few hours even though you won&#039;t want to. Oh, also pop the multi-vitamins. Helped me out after binging for a day or two. And get your hands on some Benzo&#039;s to ease the comedown &amp; help you sleep.
