				I get a headache and hungover feeling from psilocybin mushrooms, 4-aco-dmt, and the 2c family. Those are about the only psychedelics I have tried recently. I didn&#039;t always seem to have the problem, or else it was much less noticeable. Is there something wrong with my brain chemistry? I feel fine when sober, no depression or anything.<br /><br />Am I likely to get a horrendous hangover from MDMA?

				LSD just gives me back pains the next day from having my muscles being constricted by the ergot derivative during the trip although mentally i feel like the world is beautiful...<br /><br />Shrooms leave me feeling a bit mentally fatigued the next day...<br /><br />MDMA by itself doesn&#039;t have that bad of a hangover...it&#039;s more of you having one hell of a fun night jumping, running around, and dancing your feet off that&#039;ll leave you tired the next day...<br /><br />However a majority of street pressed pills tend to contain amphetamines or meth mixed with the MDMA which cause extra strain on the body during a roll and can lead to this icky dirty cracked out feeling the next day...also the extra dopamine released by amphetamines can cause neurotoxicity when they get caught in serotonin reuptake transporters...

				With shrooms I usually feel really good the next day, maybe a little tired but not too bad.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually trying to process what I learned on my trip so I can be deep in thought for a few days but not really mentally tired (I super dose on nootropics which helps tremendously).&nbsp; The only time I ever really felt hung over from shrooms is when I did them every day for a week straight.&nbsp; That will catch up with you.<br /><br />With LSD it all depends how heavy you go.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone light and felt fine, or even great, the next day (though with back tightness like gestalt said).&nbsp; 2C-B you&#039;ll feel no hangover effects whatsoever, and DMT is pretty much the same.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak to MDMA because it&#039;s really not my thing.

				I receive nothing but an afterglow after taking psychedelics, I abstain from all other drugs including coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol though so that may have something to do with it. Just eat healthy, workout, and go to school and before you know it you&#039;ll feel great again.. better even. ;) Keep your mind and body strong and jump into each trip with no fear, even bad trips are beneficial and not to mention character building. :))

				2cb gives me a massive burnt out hangover next day, worse than MDMA (which is very slight if you don&#039;t jump around too much!), and still worse than E pills.&nbsp; I get a lot of physical strain on my body at end of trip and next day, same with LSD, but not as much.&nbsp; Also usually have jaw tension the next day with 2cb.&nbsp; One hell of a trip though, by far the best, visually at least I&#039;ve tried, kicks acid&#039;s ass by far for visuals!!!

				I can&#039;t figure out if its the MDMA making the next day suck or just the fact I party so hard on it that I don&#039;t feel the pain and exhaustion till it comes down and I&#039;ve woken up.<br /><br />I felt like shit today after rolling last night, a low dose of DMT really refreshed me and got rid of my awful headache.&nbsp; Literally just -gone- in a couple weak puffs.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve found my new hangover cure.

				can&#039;t say that&#039;s the case with me. in fact, the opposite is true. i always feel rejuvenated after a trip (and i trip fairly often).

				Headaches and stuff can be fixed by drinking plenty of water during and after a trip, and going straight to bed after the cool down.

				I have taken them but a very few times, but i can tell on MDMA and shrooms - shrooms make me feel ecstatic and on the next day a bit dreamy but refreshed and happy, making many new plans for a new life, trying to resist the &quot;come down&quot; when my everyday personality is reappearing bit by bit - not keen on getting back to &quot;everyday life&quot;<br /><br />With MDMA i&#039;m still enthusiastic on the next day but would feel worn out and poisoned 2-3 days later, for me it&#039;s definitely not something to take often - and the best remedy i found was spirulina :)<br /><br />i also tried pure tyrosie and tryptophane but spirulina was better, and of course good old indian spicy food
