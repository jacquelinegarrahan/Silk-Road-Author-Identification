				This is a thread where everyone can post about how they cut their drugs for personal use (if you cut them at all), I emphasize personal use because this is about cutting high purity drugs so that they are easier to measure out or use, this is not about sneaky cuts so you can sell drugs as pure when they are actually cut.<br /><br />For example, I buy 90%+ pure meth, mix it with sugar, and pulverize it with a mortar and pestle so that every teaspoon of the sugar-meth mixture contains about 10mg meth, which I add to my coffee on days that I need a boost.<br /><br />One of my favorite cuts is water, I usually dissolve enough meth to make a 10mg/ml solution which I store in an old (cleaned) essential oil bottle and measure out with a graduated oral syringe.<br /><br />Another advantage of these methods is if I ever get searched, they wont find any drugs unless they decide to test the sugar jar next to my coffee maker or the essential oil bottle in my bathroom!<br /><br />What do you do?<br />

				I know what your trying to do and I understand why you might want to reduce your use but cutting the drugs isn&#039;t really going to help becasue they are most probably cut with other agents . There is alot of good info on the net about reducing the use , see what others say on here

Especially since the drug is already probably contaminated with various microbes, putting these microbes into water is like incubating them. Then in a week or so, you can even see the mold growing on the bottom.

Just dont do it , its far too risky, you dont know what the substanve is already cut with as i mentioned before

				i have never experimented with this mix as meth is nothing i would want to try <br /><br />but i have heard and seen people using glucose powder &amp; caffeine to cut powders with; harmless unless your caffeine allergic or diabetic.<br /><br />

				i agree about the contamination - and i am well versed in aseptic technique <br /><br />if anyone wants to make a solution and store it for longer than a few days it is definitely recommended to either use bacteriostatic water or an ethanol solution to prevent growth of microorganisms
