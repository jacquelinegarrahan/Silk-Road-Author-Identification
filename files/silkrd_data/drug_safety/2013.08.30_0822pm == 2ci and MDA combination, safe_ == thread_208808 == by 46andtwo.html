				Hi all, have yet another question for the brilliant minds of the SR forums. This is in regards to the 2ci and MDA combination. I have been snooping around the internet looking for information about the combination (if the synergistic effects are additive, multiplicative, or cancel each other out etc). I was shocked to come across a news article on a death associated with 2c-i, particularly one in combination with MDA.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;The paper by Drees et al describes the case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with a massive hemorrhagic stroke after using home-made 2C-I synthesized from a recipe found on the internet. Cerebral angiogram revealed Moyamoya Disease. MDA — another hallucinogenic stimulant — was also detected. It is not clear to what extent the individual drugs — alone or together — played in the unfortunate outcome. Treatment for exposure to any of the drugs in this class remains the same: providing good supportive care, implementing aggressive cooling if indicated, and anticipating complications such as rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Full article at CLEARNET: http://www.thepoisonreview.com/2012/09/21/2c-i-designer-hallucinogen-linked-to-north-dakota-deaths/ <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought 2c-i, a psychedelic phenethylamine would be safe to use with MDA, which can also be classified as a phenethylamine (or empatheogen). Can anyone see a reason why the combination would be unsafe, assuming no impurities?

				I don&#039;t know about the safety as far as your health is concerned (mental and physical) but there is this...<br /><br />**** CLEARNET WARNING **** http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878416<br /><br />I would personally be worried about a couple of other things besides medical issues. First is the bodyload of 2c-i. I am not a fan of it, and in medium doses even it can be too much. Maybe you don&#039;t mind the bodyload of 2c-i, but maybe you will mind it with MDA involved. It may become confusing and unnerving and too much to handle. The second thing I would be worried about is your mind-state. I have done MDA with LSD and also Psylocin before and even just smoking marijuana brings me to this very weird place - it&#039;s very much dissociative and while in this space it was impossible to come to terms with other humans and how they acted/interacted. Now of course this may not be your experience, but I feel like should mention the possibility. <br /><br />Honestly, I think 2c-i would not be a good match-up with MDA in high does. In smaller doses, 2c-i may be enlightening and energizing and a good addition to the MDA.

				Thanks for the reply (+ karma for you)! I think the two incidents are one and the same. It seems the lady was using &#039;home made&#039; 2c-i and there are many things that can go wrong with that. I agree with you on how weed mixed with 2c-i feels, very dissociative and it gave me a panic attack, tight chest and a very fast heart rate (thought I was gonna have a heart attack). Certain things are not meant to be mixed. Having a bad trip is bad, but I&#039;m more worried about medical emergencies. I was thinking of a low dose of 2c-i like you said and a moderate dose of MDA (.075g). So far I can only think of hypertension to be the worst result from such a combination. Moyomoya onm the other hand(constriction of certain blood vessels in the brain) is VERY serious and I don&#039;t want to play around with that. Though it seems to be a more hereditary/genetic disease.

				Besides the title I did not read a thing.<br /><br />It&#039;s like reading possible side effects of one drug, then interaction 1, 2, 3, 4...<br /><br />If you dont want to die, dont do it at all.<br />If you want to have an amazing time, just do it. Perhaps have some emergency people nearby or dont care about dying... or know how to use the safe and load options....<br /><br />2ci.. psychedelic... mda, psychedelic... mix? might over activate some neurons which will make you trip harder..<br /><br />The only thing that matters is: get REAL 2ci, and REAL mda.<br />Once you get that you&#039;ll rule out a lot of real (interaction) risks...
