				I&#039;m looking to buy some H on the Road for smoking - my veins are nonexistent which makes self-doctoring nigh on impossible even with a butterfly - but am a bit boggled at all the variants. I&#039;ve done a quick browse on the forums but have found conflicting opinions. Any advice from h smokers on which is best product/type to buy for this purpose? I&#039;m reading up on heroinhelper.com but any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

				Black Tar Heroin seems to be the best for this usage--in my own research. I haven&#039;t bought any yet but I believe this is majoratively what BTH is used for.<br /><br />Cheers

				lefthandspinner - I&#039;m in the Oceania region, have only seen true heroin here once in my life, usually its homebake made by cooking down morphine sulphate.<br /><br />Thanks guys - can I also clarify what the difference is between #3 or #4?

				I looked it up before. I think 4 is the same as BTH. Somebody who knows them better will clue you in. I believe the other three are all different powders and the numbering has something to do with preparation/potency.<br /><br />Cheers

				Number 3 is heroin base, used solely for smoking. Number 4 is the salt form, heroin HCL which is extremely inefficient when smoked. I don&#039;t think BTH fits into the numbering system since it is made so differently, but it smokes really well. Thus, as lefthandspinner said, if you are in EU you will find #3, or base, but in the USA, you will find BTH. Those are the ones for smoking.

I didn&#039;t know there was another good form for smoking. I&#039;ll have to look into the difference between BTH and 3 now (I&#039;m not in too big of a hurry to make an order but do want to try it before the year is out).
