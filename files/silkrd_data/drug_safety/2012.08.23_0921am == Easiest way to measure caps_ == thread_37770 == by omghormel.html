				Hey guys,<br /><br />I am looking to make MDMA caps, but it is proving difficult to measure them up. I am looking to make them 100mg ea cap. Do you guys have any suggestions to making them? At the moment I just pour some in the cap from a tats bag, measure and adjust accordingly. It&#039;s proving to take a while!<br /><br />Also I have thought about putting some jack3d (pre-workout sup) in them too, just to give a little bit of a kick. Do you guys reckon it would be good to do that or not? Minding that they&#039;re just going to my friends, not randoms who would think it&#039;s cut with something. <br /><br />Regards.

				If you have a known amount of MDMA (say a gram) I&#039;d divide it up into ten equal(ish) piles. This isn&#039;t a substitute for measuring, but they should be around 100mg each so you&#039;re closer to your desired wight as a starting point and can adjust from there. I haven&#039;t tried this though, just trying to put myself in your shoes :P<br /><br />I can&#039;t really comment on the supplement as I have no experience with this, but i guess it depends on what you&#039;re after. With high doses of caffeine (just caffeine) I find the extra energy to reckless and very pushy. I get jittery and have to move, so that might be good for you. With my limited experience with MDMA I found the energy was still there, but it wasn&#039;t pushy at all. I could move for hours on end, but didn&#039;t have to. Instead of being jittery it was as if I was floating (not literally, but that&#039;s the only way I can describe how effortless moving was.) Point is, of the two heightened energy states I preferred the one without the extra kick.<br /><br />Each to their own though :)

Anything will do, could be a piece of a cereal box. Roll it into a funnel shape and tape it down with scotch tape. Pour the amount of powder you want to cap up onto a scale. Then use a small spoon, preferably the kind that comes with the scale, call it a &#039;dosing spoon&#039; but one small enough to pick up small amounts of powder and pour&nbsp; them into your funnel or right into the caps. As you fill your caps, watch your scale. When 100mg has come off your weight you know your cap is accurately filled to 100mg.

				When moving around powders to get 100 mg samples, it can be helpful to use the handle of a plastic coffee stirrer or something similar. You&#039;ll quickly develop an eye for what 5, 10 or 20 mg of powder looks like in a small pile of that, making it easier to prepare reasonably accurate dosages using precision scales. These things are so cheap and disposable it makes sense to use a brand new one every time you work with it, avoiding contamination with other substances you may get on scoops included with scales and such work - clean work is important!

				This is what I do.<br /><br />Take a foot long or so piece of cardboard and use a pen to poke a hole the size of your cap bottom. ( a bit smaller.) every inch or so until you have 10 holes. Shove your cap pieces into the holes until they are in all the way and even with the top of the cardboard.<br /><br />Then, take a gram of product, and pour it into a relatively even line. (Make sure the edges arent thinner than the middle, even height, etc). Measure it. Divide that measurement by ten. Whatever size you get (say, 1 inch). Mark off 1 inch on the cardboard, then, using a razor or credit card or something, guide each section into their caps. Once the caps are full, push em up and toss the tops on. <br /><br />(I use big capsules)<br /><br />It&#039;s a brutish method, but it works and it&#039;s quick. And if you&#039;re selling, just sell at (AROUND 100mg) <br /><br />Jack3d is the shit. Never thought of mixing it with molly though. You might be on to something here.
