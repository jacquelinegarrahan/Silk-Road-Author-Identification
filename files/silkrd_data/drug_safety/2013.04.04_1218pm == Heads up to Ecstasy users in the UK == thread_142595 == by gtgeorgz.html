				Pretty interesting article about the growing number of pills cut with PMA or &#039;Doctor Death&#039;: <br />http://www.mixmag.net/words/features/killer-pills-myth-or-murder (clearnet alert, obviously.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is not just another drug scare story. ‘Ecstasy’ pills containing PMA are killing clubbers in the UK. Find out how to make sure you’re not next, and why the government should be doing something about it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is why I buy pretty much all my pills/mandy from SR now, not really worth the risk. Has anyone on here knowingly taken PMA, and if so what was your experience with it? I&#039;ve had my fair share of dodgy pills in the past but I can&#039;t be sure if I&#039;ve just been pipe bombed or it was actually PMA.&nbsp; :o

				Heard a lot about the pink heart press! I think an article on the daily mail was actually written about them! <br /><br />But PMA tainted MDMA powder is pretty scary... Really don&#039;t like the thought of that man :(

				Same here, I&#039;ve certainly read about them in a different article. Also pink cherries comes to mind? Not sure though. <br />Yeah, long live SR! :)

				Good call, seen a fair amount about the pink cherries too. Them pills looked appalling, when you compare them to high quality presses, Defqons, Partyflocks and the new Mortal Kombats, they just look so dodgy!<br /><br />Long live silk road indeed friend!

				+1 gtgeorgz for the heads up. Watch out for these too they were in circulation last year and may still be about &#039;Pink McDonalds&#039; (clearwebalert) www.merseyside.police.uk/news/latest-news/2012/05/31/bank-holiday-revellers-warned-about-dangers-of-pink-ecstasy.aspx it&#039;s responsible for killing a fifteen year old girl, so sad (clearwebalert) &#039;Drink &#039;spiked with ecstasy&#039; kills girl of 15&#039; www.express.co.uk/news/uk/324341/Drink-spiked-with-ecstasy-kills-girl-of-15 and a mother of four (clearwebalert) &#039;Mother-of-four killed by Ecstasy tablet&#039; www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-24755/Mother-killed-Ecstasy-tablet.html This is what gives XTC a bad name. not for ecstasy itself (it&#039;s a wonderful drug in my honest opinion) but for all the shit they cut it with, praise be for SilkRoad, PillReports, and Marquis reagent testing. Taking your time to research and investing a small amount in a test can save your life or the life of another, stay safe everyone :)

Unless it was GHB/Liquid E? But who knows :-\<br />I think since finding SR I&#039;ve only purchased a couple grams of mandy from the street, but that was in Bristol where I&#039;ve got decent links and the drug scene there is solid. They were moonrocks as well! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142595.msg980815#msg980815">Quote from: yokes101 on April 05, 2013, 11:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142595.msg980752#msg980752">Quote from: gtgeorgz on April 05, 2013, 10:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Scary shit man.

But imagine how many would be saved if they were decriminalized/regulated and people were properly educated about the effects and harms.

				I couldn&#039;t agree more man.<br /><br />I pretty much don&#039;t buy pills on the street after last time. It was pretty much the straw that broke the camels back.<br /><br />Now, if I want recreational drugs, I&#039;ll use the road.
