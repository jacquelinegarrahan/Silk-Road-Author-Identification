				Hello, SR. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried MDA before, but from what I&#039;ve read on bluelight/erowid, it seems like a lot of fun. However, I love the loved up MDMA feeling and would like to know best practices for mixing the two?<br /><br />Dosages? Experiences? How do the two mix?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!&nbsp; 8)

				I actually tried this last night. It was a really nice roll but I don&#039;t think there is really any advantage to mixing the two. If you have some pure MDA I would just take it by itself. The effects are almost identical to MDMA with the exception of some visual effects at higher doses. THEREALUSdirect had the best MDA I&#039;ve ever had. 125MGs had me rolling hard with some awesome closed-eye visuals.

				a very enjoyable combo, I recommend it if you like a longer lasting &amp; slightly trippy experience.. the smack effect on the comedown is nice too

				Thanks everyone.&nbsp; Is there truth in the notion that MDA causes a bit speedier effects than MDMA? I&#039;m asking because it&#039;s for a festival. Pure MDMA floors me and I want to get up and dance with energy... so I was thinking mixing the two might give me the best of both worlds and last a little longer.

A friend of mine was rolling on some MDMA, and i gave him some of my MDA. He was blown away with euphoria and was up until 7am. You should be good for a great festival with that combo.

				I have some MDA on the way and didn&#039;t mean to order it. I&#039;ve never tried it and when researching it most people said that the empathy/extreme happiness isn&#039;t there. Is that true?

Maybe not quite as much, but close. The visuals won&#039;t really come on until yer rollin&#039; pretty hard, and even then, its not like LSD. I usually get really fast closed-eye visuals. Like images of different stuff flashing though my mind so fast you can&#039;t really tell what it is. Occasionally lasting longer and becoming more lucid.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yeah it&#039;s taken a bit longer than expected but it should be here soon. Was meant to be here last week but there has been some delays and they couldn&#039;t be helped. I&#039;ll post up on here and the other threads I&#039;ve done about it when the listings are up.

				Just tried it for the first time a couple of weeks ago..I had tried MDA on its own before and it was like MDMA on steroids, I absolutely loved it, but mixing the together was the most beautiful MDXX experience I have ever had. I dosed 125x125 with a redose of 100x100 which was entirely too much but still, a very wonderful experience. You all must try this if haven&#039;t yet and I look forward to hearing what you think.

				I know I can&#039;t take MDA by itself. 100mg and I knew it was good, just can&#039;t remember specifics of what happened, what I saw, or what I experienced. <br /><br />Would love to try mixing the two, maybe 60x60 since I can roll pretty well on 100-120mg of mdma alone.

				For those with experience mixing MDA and MDMA:<br /><br />In your experience, is it better to take both at the same time or one before the other?<br /><br />Thinking 150mg MDMA +75mg MDA... but not sure whether to capsule together or take one first, then the other once the come up starts.
