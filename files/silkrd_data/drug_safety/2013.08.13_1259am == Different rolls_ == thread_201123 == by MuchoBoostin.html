				I&#039;m relatively new to MDMA, and I&#039;ve only used it from a couple of really really well respected vendors. Anyway, the rolls have been fantastic, but one was obviously more touchy...I had a little trouble standing as well. I know I took a little much on that occasion by accident, but the touchy feelings were INSANE. The other stuff I&#039;ve rolled on was easily as good, or better(top 3 on here) but it just wasn&#039;t extremely feely. It felt amazing but it was entirely WAY more visual. I&#039;ve seen halos/tracers and even liquid chromatic hallucinations on lower doses than I had the really feely time...and I felt a lot more almost &quot;sober&quot; clear headed but extremely social. Obviously COMPLETELY different experiences. <br /><br />What gives? I know each time can be a different experience, and it definitely has been, BUT the same MDMA batches acted relatively the same, just my interests changed a little bit. I even tried recreating a chill situation to see if maybe my touch senses were dulled a little bit at festies/shows, but it was the same roll. Why are they so different? I know I&#039;ve seen some talk about different isomers...is that what is different? Maybe a longer break? I mean I&#039;ve had 3 month breaks between and it&#039;s not the touchy thing. Either way, it&#039;d be cool to have the option of different rolls like I have with weed haha. Touchys for at home with the sloot, and social/visual for the club/party scene.<br /><br />tl;dr Rolled on different respected members MDMA; one was extremely touchy and almost drunk-like, other was social, euphoric, and visual. Why? Would like to have different roll options.

				When I first started it was all love and happiness, just non stop talk and a great love of everyone I met. Everyone. Touchy feelings came with these rolls.<br /><br />That stopped after a while(never had it again, this was maybe 4 or 5 years ago). Then I started dropping 2 or 3 pills at once and was introduced to eye jiggles, gurns, and the psychoactive side of mdma(I have tripped with people who have rolled so hard they have almost acid like effects, HARDCORE hallucinations, and just no grasp on reality)<br /><br />lately I&#039;ve just been getting insanely nervous(this is subtickles mdma I&#039;m doing at this point). Just eyes wide open, super scared of drunk people when I&#039;m on it now, just wanna kinda hide in a car or something and watch people. I can keep my shit together but my girlfriend has a hard time which makes me think it just might be the product.<br /><br />Gonna grab off haizenberg this winter and hopefully bring back the joy of MD.
