				Hey guys. I was fortunate enough to gram a sample of rogerpete&#039;s DMT, and after trying it I&#039;m going to be ordering a gram.<br /><br />Anyways, while I&#039;ve done DMT in the past, I&#039;ve never had a stash of it, so I have some basic questions about how to store it properly, etc.<br /><br />What&#039;s the shelf-life for freebase DMT? Is it along the same lines as LSD?<br /><br />Is it important to keep it out of direct light? Away from oxygen? In the fridge? <br /><br />TIA guys for sharing your knowledge. :)

				Hey RP, good to see you on the forum side, and thanks for the info. That&#039;s pretty much what I was planning to do, but when I stopped to think about it I realized I had a much clearer picture of how to store lsd vs dmt. Which makes sense considering DMT is still pretty exotic compared to lsd at this point in time. So ya the info is much appreciated. Sharing is caring. ;)<br /><br />Oh, also forgot the other important question, what&#039;s the tolerance like? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some typical advised waiting period between doses (for LSD it seems either 1 or 2 weeks are mentioned most). With lsd and shrooms I rarely want to come back to it before that time is up, but with your dmt I&#039;m already feeling like heading back in! :D

				Any idea if keeping dmt capsules in the freezer would noticeably increase shelf life compared to storing it in a plastic container (no light, room temp)?&nbsp; My inclination is that unless you&#039;re holding on to it for years the difference would be negligible
