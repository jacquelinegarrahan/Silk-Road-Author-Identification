				So, virmo fucked up and shipped a bottle of dexies.<br />5mg;s of dex and 295mg binding materials.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to iv this but not with the binding materials ofcourse.<br /><br />Could somebody please send an easy to understand guide on how to get rid of the binding materials so only pure dex remains?<br />If that requires other products then let me know how much and where to find it.<br /><br />I tried filtering with a coffee filter but it seemed that everything including the binding materials got through.<br /><br />I only want the pure dex to remain. Not the crappy L amph.<br /><br />Any advice/sources will be welcome. <br />Either way virmo seems to have the best amphetammines out here but after my order they were out of stock :p<br /><br />They require the materials to isolate the dex from the l. Help them out. That way I do not need to mention it.<br /><br />I hope they can show what dutch speed should be like. For me they already did. Besides the binding materials it&#039;s as pure as it can be. But it would be amazing if they got rid of the stupid binding materials.<br /><br />It will not be between 60-70$ with a lot of caffeine in it. It will be washed, feel very clean with no hangover.<br />(thats what I recieved... but I cant ingest because of the binding materials.<br />Though just swallowing their speed feels very clean and nice.<br /><br />Shortly after this they will have the best speed of NL. Not just the 60% purity which is a shame to the netherlands, Unless you cut it badly.<br /><br />They wrote they could start already.. But it seems they miss d-tartratic and stuff like that.<br /><br />Water just dissolves everything. So please be of help, let me IV and let them baffle you with the quality...<br /><br />And remind yourselves that all other speed vendors from the NL should feel ashamed. Even though they ship shit a lot more than virmo...<br /><br />Even with binders you&#039;d get a perfect high. But it is not good for your respiratory system. <br /><br />At least, that is how I roll right now, No weird effects and a clear mind.
