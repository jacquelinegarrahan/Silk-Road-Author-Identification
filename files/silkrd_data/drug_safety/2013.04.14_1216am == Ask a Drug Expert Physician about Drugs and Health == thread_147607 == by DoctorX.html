				Hey doctor thanks so much for offering your advice! I have type 1 diabetes and i am wondering if there is any information connected to MDMA and its effect on blood sugar? I have never done MDMA but am interested in exploring it. Would i have enough control over myself to realize &quot;i need to test&quot; or should a trip sitter be there to remind me? Secondly, I have tripped in the past on LSD and mushrooms but that was before my diagnosis...now that i know i have to monitor my sugar levels to avoid issues im afraid i might become afraid or paranoid of my glucometer or my insulin injections under the influence..any recommendations on how to deal with this?

				In non-diabetic persons MDMA does not have a significant effect on glucose blood levels. There are no specific studies on diabetic persons but, according to MDMA pharmacology, dramatic changes in glucose are not expected.<br />In fact, alcohol is the most altering glucose drug in diabetics. For the rest of substances, it is more important “what are you doing” that “what substance did you take”. If you are dancing, doing exhausting exercise or you forget to eat are important aspects that can affect glycaemia. Some drugs make you hungry (cannabis), other diminish appetite (stimulants). <br />Most people feel like, on MDMA, it is easy to keep control on what you feel, what you think and what you do (or at least easier than other drugs). But the positive mood could make you feel forgetful and carefree. As MDMA effects last for 4-6 hours, one possible strategy is to set an alarm clock in hour 2-4 to remind you of test your sugar. I think with that it should be enough. If you are with some friends that know what you are doing it should be great. You should use moderate doses first times (60-80 mg) and be cautious with dosage in general (not over 120 mg) as diabetes can affect cardiovascular health. One important thing to remember is that MDMA decreases appetite: you should keep with you sweat soft food as milkshakes or fruit. <br />Some diabetic MDMA users have told me that MDMA makes them feel more conscious about their own body, so they can notice better if there is hyper or hypoglycaemias. On the other hand, ketamine is a drug not recommendable for diabetics, as it alters self-perception of body.<br />I don´t know how long have you been diagnosed of diabetes, but if it is a recent diagnosis you should wait to know well how to use insulin and “get used” to your condition and then after experiment with substances. I think worries and paranoias are less probable with MDMA than psychedelics. But as you learn to live a normal life with diabetes worries will disappear. <br />DoctorX

				A dissociative fugue is a kind of amnesia in which, the person who suffers it, experiments an &quot;escape&quot; of his own personality, and so he is not able to remember a part or the whole of his previous life. He is not able to remember who he or she is and, in some times, it produces the creation of a new identity. In most cases it is a temporal state, lasting hours to days or months.<br />In relation to LSD, lithium and tricyclics I only know some reports in Internet forums, but, as far as I know there are no scientific data about it. I think very high doses of LSD or other psychedelics could rarely trigger dissociative states in predisposed individuals. I don´t know if lithium or triciclycs raise this probability. From a medical point of view, dissociative fugue is considered a psychiatric condition and, in my personal opinion, is an unpleasant and non-adaptative state. Some psychonauts like to explore these mind-states but I would not personally recommend that.<br />DoctorX

				2C-B and 2C-X<br />Amphetamines and ring substituted methylenedioxyamphetamines are known to be neurotoxic in animals in high doses. This is a problem with MDMA, MDA or meth and has been studied and described for decades. 2C-B is structurally related to mescaline, not to MDMA or amphetamines. And mescaline is a molecule known since a century and there are no studies showing neurotoxicity in animals or humans. So it is not likely that 2C-B has significant neurotoxic potential. <br />Our working team published last year the first study on subjective effects of 2C-B users. The sample was small but we did not find any adverse effects or toxicity ( motor problems, memory complains) suggestive of neurotoxicity. <br />http://www.slideshare.net/fernandocaudevilla/2cb<br />On the other hand, and in terms of general toxicity, 2C-B is known since the 70s and has been widely used. Adverse effects seem well known and not important. It is a well known molecule. But there are some other derivatives with atoms that are not typical in human pharmacology (2C-F, 2C-C...). Maybe any of these lesser-known drugs are potentially more dangerous

				MDMA and Lexapro<br /><br />In theory, two or three weeks after finishing escitalopram, your neurorreceptors would be in a state similar to how you felt before Lexapro. But life is much more complex than neurochemistry. It depends also on your expectations, feelings, mood, personal experiences...I suppose that you have been taking Lexapro for a&nbsp; mental health or psychological condition. The best way to have a positive experience with any drug is to be in good state of mind before taking it. Until you are feeling 100% and able to abandon your medication it will be difficult for you to feel the full effects of MDMA.

				Stimulants and weight loss<br />Like therapeutic effects, some adverse effects of&nbsp; drugs are inherent to them and difficult to avoid. Loss of appetite is a well-known effect of amphetamines, in fact some people take them to lose weight , the opposite as you wish. The only way I think you could win or re-win some weight is increasing protein and carbohydrates intake. I think many formula used in bodybuilding (50% protein + 50% carbohydrate, for example) could make you gain some weight if you get used to use it daily.

				As an 18 year old with a still developing brain, what do you think the possible consequences of frequent psychedelic use could be? <br /><br />About mid-December, I took MDMA for the first and only time and absolutely loved it. I plan on doing it once or twice more this summer, but have not come back to it yet due to it&#039;s known neurotoxicity. Since that time though, I have done LSD, mushrooms, threshold doses of DMT, and 4-aco-DMT a handful of times, tripping an average of 2-3 times a week, but even more so in the last two weeks. I&#039;ve also tried 25-I twice but the iodine molecule scares me so I won&#039;t be going back to that. <br /><br />I&#039;ve decided that I&#039;ll be spacing my trips out more now. I&#039;m taking LSD on the 19th for Bicycle Day and waiting until a concert on May 4th to trip again. From there, I&#039;ll try to space out trips by at least a week over the summer, and then stop for a few months or more when school starts back up. <br /><br />So what I&#039;m wondering is, do you know what sort of effects, long or short-term, on the brain my frequent use of psychedelics over the last four months may have caused? And would you suggest waiting longer than a week between trips over the summer? <br /><br />Any info you have would be really appreciated, as I do care about myself and don&#039;t want to continue tripping like this if it means something serious could come from it. Thank you.

				ModalSoul:<br />In my opinion tripping 2-3 times a week is too much, regardless of your age and any other factor. &quot;Classical&quot; psychedelics (LSD, mushrooms, DMT...) have a very low organic toxicity, but are substances that can make feel very strong changes in the way we perceive the world and reality. I think it is good to have enough time to integrate these experiences. Some people that take psychedelics with frequency they finally wonder if is this world real or the psychedelic one. Or have difficulties to handle with real world. Or, simply, get bored of psychedelics (when you repeat the same thing a lot of times you finally get bored of it). I think once a month could be a reasonable pattern of use for psychedelics. Too frequent use will lead to tolerance, and you will need to increase dose. You should think about the objective of your psychedelic use (fun?, self-knowledge?, experimentation?, <br />If you are worried about negative effects, I strongly advise you against new synthetic psychedelics (bromo dragonfly, 25-I-NBOME...) We know almost everything about LSD, ayahuasca, DMT, mushrooms... but these new substances have not been studied in humans and risks are unknown and potentially high.

				ThisSHITScrazyman<br /><br />0.5 gr of MDMA is too much MDMA in any case. Studies in human pharmacology and studies of psychoterapeutic use of MDMA in the 1970s show that 120-150 mg is the highest rank. A re-dose of the half (60-75 mg) 2-3 hours later extends the experience with not too many adverse effects. If you take higher doses or frequencies you will multiply adverse and negative after effects. Women and first time users should use smaller quantities (70-100 mg).

				Grdr<br /><br />You are right, I agree with you. One of the conditionants for the dangerousness of drugs is the fact that they are legal or not. Illegal drugs are far more dangerous because they are not sanitary controlled. Some scientist have criticized that study in the same way you´ve done.&nbsp;

				ChemCat:<br />The original question was &quot;Which one do you consider the most harmless and why? Which one do you consider the most dangerous?&quot;. I tried to explain that harms and dangers not depend only on the substance but other factors like individuals, patterns of use and context of use. And it depends on the kind of danger we consider. If we measure &quot;accidents&quot; alcohol would be more harmul than marijuana, obviously. If we measure &quot;effects on short time memory&quot; cannabis would be more dangerous than tobacco, for example. And I answered &quot;Illegal drugs are far more dangerous because they are not sanitary controlled&quot; in response to a remark about heroin adulterants (carfentanil)<br />By the way, I don´t underestimate your comments by the fact you are a &quot;doctor&quot; or not.

				Valakki<br /><br />Torrente rules!<br />I don´t think my personal use of drugs has any interest, but, if you insist, I´ll tell that MDMA is my favourite, although now I do it only 3-4 times a year.<br />I think the new synthetic scene can be very problematic. During all the nineties, media and antidrug scientists used the images of &quot;Russian roulette&quot; or &quot;laboratory guinea pigs&quot; to talk about risks of MDMA and other syntethic drugs. And that was absolutely false, as drugs like MDMA, psilocibin, ketamine, GHB, amphetamines, LSD, mescaline, MDA, DMT, opiates, cocaine...have been studied during decades and we know almost everything about their pharmacology and risks. <br />Otherwise, these new synthetic drugs have not been tested in human or animals in most cases. Their risks are unknown but potentially much greater than classic drugs. As you say new substances appear because older are fiscalized. But, in terms of chemistry and pharmacology, they are even more bizarre and dangerous than previous. But they are &quot;legal&quot;, and some people can think that, if they are legal it is because they are harmless. It is curious the fact that, in SR, they are rarely among the &quot;bestselling&quot;, probably because SR users have better information about drugs than general population.<br />I think that legalization of all substances is the only solution to the called &quot;drug problem&quot;&nbsp;

				White Out:<br /><br />I wouldn´t put cannabis in that list, I wouldn´t reject it, neither. But I think, in general, some risks of cannabis are underestimated. In fact I consider it as a &quot;minor psychedelic&quot; with all the inconveniences (and properties) of these group. People who like cannabis enjoy it very much, but there are some other people that find their effects not pleasant. It also has effects on short time memory (reversible with weeks of abstinence) and I don´t think it is a drug for people who have to study or do hard intellectual work (there are exceptions to this rule). As with any other substances, it all depends on persons and patterns of use.<br /><br />I´m not concerned about LEOs, as I´m not doing any illegal activity here. I´m offering my professional experience to assess people who take drugs in a risk reduction perspective. For that I have decided to make my identity public. But I understand perfectly your worries. All the personal data I receive in my work (in Spain and outside) are confidential and restrained to Spanish Personal Data Laws.

				There are some differences but, basically, they are compounds very similar. Methamphetamine is 2,5 times more potent than amphetamine on their effects, but therapeutical and clinical uses are the same. In fact, meth is marketed in some countries as Desoxyn, anda approved for ADD and obesity as short time medication. As a prescription drug, methamphetamine is used at 5 mg dose and only by oral route

				Well...I think it basically depends on the impact on MDMA or psychedelics in your life. For many people these drugs only mean a little while of fun on a limited experience. But, in other cases, these substances can have a significative psychological impact and make long lasting changes in personality. For example, if someone learns through MDMA, to be more open-minded or less shy, I think this will change his &quot;body language&quot; in some way.&nbsp; But in this sense drugs can change body language as many other important things that happen in your life.

There is a theoretical risk but it is probably overestimated. Anyway, combination of MDMA and SSRI is not recommended. First because, in general, it lowers MDMA effects. Second because people under SSRI treatment usually suffer problems as depression or anxiety disorders and, MDMA is not recommended because of these problems.<br />In animal models combination of MDMA and some SSRI showed lower neurotoxicity.But doses and patterns of administration make that these results can´t be extrapolated to humans. It is not likely that SSRIs have a neuroprotective effect in humans at doses available.<br />In my opinion risk of neurotoxicity associated to MDMA is sometimes exagerated. There is no evidence that occasional moderate doses (lower than 120-150 mg) have any neurotoxic effects. In fact at least four investigation teams have been administrating MDMA to healthy human volunteers in clinical trials with the approval of sanitary authorities and ethical comitees of clinical trials. In this case neuroprotective drugs are unnecessary. People who take large doses during long time are probably more exposed to this risks, and in this case there are no neuroprotective measures that have shown efficacy.<br />Substances that inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAOI: phenelzine, moclobemide) are most likely to lead to serious increases in serotonin when used with ecstasy, and develop a serotonin syndrome. In people who use these drugs MDMA is absolutely not recommended.

				Hey DoctorX!<br /><br />Thank you for your nice offer here. <br /><br />I have a question about opiats and mental health issues. <br /><br />Again and again I find sources that tell that opiats are the &quot;better antipsychotics&quot; (and were used for that in the past), also partially anti-depressant because of mood lifting... and many pain patients tell, that their mental health issues were almost gone completely since they started taking their prescribed opiats/opioids. Also some therapists and doctors suggest that the use of opiats would be far better, especially because of better mood and less harm to your body.<br /><br />I have to deal with OCD (obsessive-compulsive-disorder), GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and kind of schizophrenia.<br /><br />I take highly potent antipsychotics atm and they don&#039;t work like I would them to work... (they just sedate... thats it... than you have to deal with side effects like very hard depressions, and dissociative mental states). <br /><br />So I don&#039;t have much to loose, I have to weigh up - perhaps life long - antipsychotic treatment with all the side effects and feeling like a zombie - on the other hand a much better quality of life with opiates. <br /><br />So I&#039;m going to try this path anyway, but would thank you a lot, if you could tell me something about mental health and opiates.<br /><br />Can they&nbsp; be used as medication while a panic attack takes place? Or is set&amp;setting important?<br /><br />I need something for my emergencies to come down - and I need something for stabilization in long term. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to use benzos - as I know they are more dangerous than opiats (for the body) and don&#039;t have mood &quot;support&quot; ... <br /><br />above all - sometimes they make it worse...<br /><br />Perhaps you can tell me a little bit about it<br /><br />and... are there dangerous interactions between antipsychotics and opiates?`(Of course both sedating, so I&#039;m talking about low doses)<br /><br />Thank you

				Bastian:<br />There are some scientific data that point that some opiates can relieve symptoms of schizophrenia. Some authors believe that use of opiates by persons with schizophrenia is so common because of self-medication. But in fact this is only a hypothesis and it is a matter of discussion. The role of opiates in schizophrenia is documented, but there are many less data in OCD and anxiety dissorder. I´m not sure if they can be useful for these diseases. Anxiety dissorders are better controlled with SSRIs better than benzodiacepines.<br />As any other psychoactives , we should consider unwanted effects and problems: first of all the dependence potential (more important than antipsychotics and antideppresives). Also adverse effects (constipation, nausea, stinging...), farmacological tolerance (need to increase dose over time) and problems to have a continous supply of non-sanitary controlled products.<br />In any case, I think medication alone (antidepressives, antipsychotics, opiates or whatever...) should never be the only base of mental health issues. Psychological support is always as important as pills and helps to improve results.

				agrowersstory<br /><br />Estimate risks from concrete practices is one of the most common questions, and one of the most difficult to answer. Some risks are east to estimate, but most are not. If you drink 4 gr of GHB and 3 cups of whiskey the risk of falling asleep in high. If you take 100 mg of pure MDMA in a controlled environment , the risk of a heatstroke is extremely low. <br />But the risk of the combination you propose is difficult to calculate. When we talk about risks we have to difference between &quot;adverse effects&quot; (frequent and common at normal doses and, in general, mild) and &quot;toxicity&quot; (serious problems, but rare at normal doses/more possible at high doses). It is important to consider the probability that a particular event happens.<br />In general, combinations of drugs have more risks than drugs alone. Dose is also important, and doses you are using seems to be higher than recommended. Half a gram of cocaine in an hour seems a high dose. The possibility of toxic effects is relatively low but these effects, if happen, could be serious (cardiovascular or cerebrovascular problems). The heroin dose it seems also high (you don´t have tolerance if you do this 3-4 times a year),and it is particularly important to be prudent if you don´t know the exact purity of the batch of heroin you are using. If purity raises a clinical overdose it is possible.<br />&nbsp;

				Therapeutic dosage of amphetamine as prescription drugs is 15-60 mg oral route. The 60 mg dose is used for people with pharmacological tolerance, after some weeks/months of treatment. <br />So the doses you are using seem high from a pharmacological point of view (particularly if you were using intranasal route). Obviously , risks should be lower at the 15 than at the 60 mg rank. But even at these doses, in &quot;real world&quot; the chance of serious problems for health is relatively low in young healthy persons. (Please, read the difference between &quot;adverse effects&quot; and &quot;toxicity&quot; in previous answer).<br />The more frequent it is the use, the possibilities of problems is higher. It is not a good idea to associate too many activities of your life to amphetamine use. Most amphetamine health problems are related to regular use, so the more sporadic is your use, the probability of risks gets reduced. I regret some advice seem too obvious, but objectively is all I can say.

				Andrewbud420:<br /><br />In a risk perspective we can consider freebase more dangerous than cocaine clorhidrate (absorption surface, dependence potential, organic repercussion). On the other hand, there is no risk of overdose and respiratory depression with short acting benzodiacepines and, in this sense, is far more than intranasal heroin.

				Hi DoctorX<br /><br />In summer I&#039;m going to apply for admission test at university and I&#039;m considering using ritalin to improve my focus an so my score too: <br />the test has a lot of gmat 600-type logical questions e.g. http://gmatclub.com/forum/critical-reasoning-question-directory-topic-and-difficulty-128861.html<br />in particular Assumptions,Conclusion,Strengthen,Argument Weaken,Argument ,Numbers and Percents,Logical Flaw.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already applied once to a similar test,and I was disturbed by the noises of other people,by the feeling of time running out...I performed worse in class than I would have performed at my home.<br /><br />I&#039;m planning to ingest a 10mg pill - therapeutic dosage - about 30 minutes before the test. <br />The problem is that where I live generally the summer is hot (25-29 C) and during the test there will be some stress (hundrends of people waiting outside the university to take the test and eventually not much space).<br />Also I have some general anxiety,I could fear to look &quot;drugged&quot; to others or my voice altered.<br />Of course the anxiety will probably get worse,but I&#039;ll see if I can manage it testing ritalin in social situations few days before taking the admission test.<br /><br />Methylphenidate is anfetamine,a stimulant,so the question is: could the hot and the stress cause problem to my circulatory system during the test? <br /><br />I will take and ECG check much before taking ritalin however to minimize the risks,but I have already used cocaine an mdma some time ago.<br /><br />Sorry for crossposting.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Devoidest<br /><br />Methylphenidate is a drugs relatively close to amphetamine in their mechanism of action, but it is not an amphetamine. If you mean with &quot;problems for your circulatory system&quot; symptoms like mild tachycardia, palpitations, sweating...they are possible but probably related to situations. If you mean severe problems like angina, psychosis, stroke...they are highly unlikely. I think no one will notice &quot;that you are drugged&quot;.<br />But one important thing is &quot;is it methylphenidate effective for that use?&quot;. Studies have shown some cognitive improvement in children with ADD, but there is a considerable neuropsychological profile heterogeneity among diagnosed children, as well as variable response to treatment. And in healthy volunteers the effect of methylphenidate is only shown on short term memory, and the quality of studies is weak.<br />I don´t think that there is evidence enough that methylphenidate will be effective for the kind of complex-tests you are facing.

				DoctorX, I appreciate this thread.<br /><br />As I posted elsewhere in this section, I have experienced asthma symptoms/respiratory tightness multiple times after taking mild recreational doses of opioids.&nbsp; This has happened more severely with heroin #4 (insufflated) from different sources, and less severely with pharmaceutical oxycodone IR (oral).&nbsp; <br /><br />All of the above was done with low tolerance/experience.&nbsp; The heroin was 1 gram chipped over 7+ days, and the oxycodone was 30-45mg oral doses each time.<br /><br />I have no history of asthma or lung issues.<br /><br />I still experience the typical positive effects from opioid abuse in addition to the negative respiratory effects.<br /><br />Are you aware of this as a relatively common reaction, or do you suspect some form of allergic reaction or adverse predisposition toward opioids?<br /><br />In searching I can only find the obvious link between opioids and cough suppression, but nothing that addresses my experience.<br /><br />Thanks

				Newbottles:<br />Allergic-asmathic reactions to heroin are not a common adverse effect, but they are possible, particularly using inhalated route. There are some cases described in medical literature:<br />(CLEARNET)<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1835195/pdf/bmj00315-0033.pdf<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20857854<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17639839<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10631229 <br />(CLEARNET)<br /><br />Heroin, morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone contain a phenantrene molecule structure, which can lead to cross-allergic reactions (that means, if you are allergic or you are developing allergy to one of the molecules of the family, you have more chance to be allergic to the rest). So is theoretically possible to be allergic to both heroin and oxycodone.<br /><br />Without an exploration and allergic tests I can be sure that you are developing an allergic reaction, but there are enough data to think it is possible. The most prudent idea would be to avoid opiates. If you can´t or you don´t want do this, in a risk reduction perspective you should be very careful (don´t do it alone, do it in a place where you can search for medical help quickly...) and get some adrenaline 1/10.000 for subcutaneous administration in case of emergency

				AnonymousAddict<br /><br />Some opioids are agonists of opioid receptors (morphine, codeine, heroin). Some other are antagonists (naloxone), and other are mixed agonists-antagonists. Buprenophine and Nalbuphine (Nubain) are among these substances and can precipitate withdrawal symptoms in regular opiate users.<br /><br />I don´t like to give moral advices. But, in a clínical-objective point of view, the younger is a drug user, the probability of problems with use increase. Opiates are drugs difficult to handle and have severe adverse effects and can lead to dependence. I think you should consider this, as you are 13 years old.<br /><br />Peace&amp;love

				Chaosforpeace<br /><br />I think the most evident risk for daily use of potent stimulants (meth or crack) would be the risk of dependence. This is not technically &quot;irreversible&quot; but with such a pattern of use it would be a likely consequence, and for most people dealing with dependence of stimulants is hard. Stimulants produce pharmacological tolerance (need to increase the dose to obtain the same effects over time), and with a daily use tolerance will appear. Depending on dosage and route of administration it is possible a variable degree of cardiovascular harm (hypertension, enlargment of heart walls would be the most common). Although is difficult to measure its seriousness and reversibility the probability of these conditions seems medium-high. There are some other possible problems (neurological, endocrine, psychiatric...)that can be linked to daily use of stimulants .<br /><br />There are some clinical trials that have used methamphetamine for weight lose. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an “anorectic” drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drug prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated, and the diet prescribed. The natural history of obesity is measured in years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.

As someone who was once quite large (6&#039; 3&quot;, 290lbs) AND someone who has experimented with many drugs (primarily uppers) for a good chunk of time (~3 years) I can honestly tell you that the route you are considering is a very poor choice. Let&#039;s start with the psychological effects. My drug of choice for the longest time was ecstasy (with some coke and meth mixed in every now and then). I would roll probably 2-3 times per week. I did that for about a year straight, and then I continued to do it with less frequency (~ once every other week) for another year. Doing those kinds of drugs with that frequency over that amount of time was absolutely HORRIBLE for my head. After about 3 months of use, I became a different person. I felt as if I lost some of the wit I was known for. My mind just wasn&#039;t as sharp. Short term memory was completely shot. Worst of all was that it made me depressed. I spent most of my life a happy person. This turned me to thoughts that to this day freak me out. I don&#039;t want to get into them, but you get where I&#039;m going with that. This alone is reason not to do drugs like the ones you are talking about. Keep in mind, my drug of choice was ecstasy- a drug with very little to no chemical dependence factor. I couldn&#039;t imagine what would have come of me had I chosen meth to satisfy my urges. <br /><br />This drug use primarily occurred after my weight loss as a side note. With regards to the weight. Sure.... you&#039;ll lose it and you&#039;ll probably lose a lot. But I can guarantee you that as soon as you stop (if you can) you will yoyo back to where you were before. You might even get bigger. Not eating is TERRIBLE for weight loss because your body goes into survival mode. Any calories consumed will be turned to fat at the first opportunity. I lost 90 lbs doing nothing but jogging and eating properly. I&#039;m not talking about fad diets. I chose to go on a low carb diet where my primary food intake was salad/vegetables and lean protein like chicken breast/tuna/cottage cheese. Once a day I would let myself have a sandwhich on WHOLE GRAIN bread along with a cup of non-processed fruit juice. I avoided processed sugars like the plague (primarily soda). When you say you will just &quot;lift&quot; and preserve the muscle mass, you are completely wrong. Your body requires fuel, more specifically, the PROPER fuel to gain muscle mass. There is a reason you will never see a ripped/fit meth head. Because guess what? When you don&#039;t eat, you don&#039;t have the energy to lift. Sure... you might be able to lift the first few days of your binge, but go a couple weeks malnourished and see where your motivation goes.<br /><br />Now I could be completely wrong here, but you sound very similar to how I thought when I had the extra pounds on me. I would be willing to put you in your late teens or early twenties-- male and angry at the females of the world for not giving you attention for just being you. I&#039;m not bagging on you man. I was the SAME person. Anything that&#039;s going through your mind to make you consider meth as a method for weightloss probably went through my mind at one point. I&#039;m also not going to play mommy and tell you that everyone loves you and please reconsider. The world is a cold cruel place and people outside your family, in general could give two shits about me or you. What I would like to do is ask you to honestly think about what you&#039;ve said. Think about where it could lead you. If you&#039;ve got any questions about my story or advice I could give, I would be more than happy to message you or answer them here. Always remember... the human mind is more powerful than any substance. If the solution doesn&#039;t come from your head, whatever you do is just going to be a bandaid for whatever problem truly afflicts you.<br /><br />Be safe,<br /><br />Pink

				yellowmattercustard<br /><br />I´m not sure what could be the cause of this effect. What I know is that, undoubtedly, LSD is physically harmless (at least for most people, or does not have significant organic toxicity). LSD was first synthetized in 1938 and has been widely studied in celular models, animals and humans. Even, there are enough clinical trials in humans that show it doesn´t have organic toxicity on any human organ or system (excluding psychiatric problems, but that is other story...)<br />We can´t say the same things about all the NBOMe family. They were discovered in 2003 and there are no data about their effects and risks in humans. In this sense they are far more dangerous, at least potentialy, and users are acting as guinea pigs.<br />At least in Spain it is common that blotters with 25I-NBOMe or bromo-dragonfly are being sold as LSD. One simple way to distinguish the two substances is illumination with a UV Black Light. LSD has a fluorescent reaction that does not have with other substances

This includes most psychedelics and stimulants, both illegal (cocaine, amphetamines) and prescription drugs like methylphenidate.

LSD induces a release of extracellular glutamate in the hippocampus. Glutamate is the body&#039;s primary excitatory neurotransmitter. It binds to NMDA receptor sites, along with glycine, opening the ion channels and allowing calcium to enter the neuron. This is how the brain sends cascading electrical signals. When the ion channels open for too long or too frequently, calcium concentrations can become too high in the neuron. This can lower the effectiveness of your ion channels, or can even cause neuronal death. Magnesium is the substance your body uses to block the channel in a voltage-dependent manner. This means that the ion channel will not allow Ca2+ to pass, even if glutamate and glycine are bound to their receptor sites. However, once the neuronal membrane&#039;s electrical potential rises to an excited state, the Mg molecule will clear the channel and allow for normal operation. Most people are deficient in magnesium as it is. Supplementing a highly bioavailable magnesium supplement such as magnesium glycinate (avoid magnesium oxide!) will give your body the substance it needs to naturally protect itself from excitotoxicity. Suffice to say, I firmly believe these claims to be far from placebo and I myself always take magnesium glycinate before any recreational drug as it smooths the experience by quite a bit. Also, I have to be redundant in saying that you need to be sure you are getting a BIOAVAILABLE magnesium supplement such as magnesium glycinate, as magnesium oxide has only a ~4% absorption rate compared to the ~80% of glycinate.<br /><br />Here are a few sources...<br /><br />This diagram illustrates the release of glutamate by psychedelics (LSD included):<br />&gt; http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v11/n9/fig_tab/nrn2884_F1.html<br /><br />This study finds that LSD antagonized glutamate excitation of neurons:<br />&gt; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1702892/<br /><br />This summation states that LSD modulated the NMDA receptor-mediated sensory, perceptual, affective and cognitive processes:<br />&gt; http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/lysergic.htm<br /><br />These studies explain how magnesium plays a role in regulation:<br />&gt; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044576584710128<br />&gt; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1661812

				AnimusVox<br /><br />Congratulations for your guide!<br />In general I think it is a very good work. I can only give you my personal opinion (opinion based on scientific knowledge) about the issues of neurotoxicity and heat stroke risk .<br />As I said in other topic, I think the general perception about this risks is overestimated. I´m not saying that neurotoxicity or heat stroke are not possible complications, but media and scientific reports have created exaggerated alarm about these things.<br />Doses, ways of administration and metabolism in animals don´t permit to directly extrapolate data from investigation in animals to humans. Data from animals show that MDA is more neurotoxic than MDMA, and this is probably the same for humans. But experiments on rats with 50 mg/kg intravenous MDA is not representative of a human 1-1.5 mg oral route. In fact there are recent clinical trials on humans with MDA that wouldn´t have been approved if neurotoxicity was so easy<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996283/<br />It happens the same thing with neuroprotective drugs. These experiments are not to study potential neuroprotection in human, but understanding molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity, giving mega-doses of alpha lipoic, vitamins or tryptophan. There is no evidence that these things work in human.<br />In resume, moderate doses (80-100 mg) are not shown to produce significant toxicity in humans. Supplements do not have demonstrated protective effects. Probably&nbsp; high doses or frequencies of MDA are neurotoxic (more than MDMA, probably) but there is no evidence that supplements work there. So the only risk reduction message should be be careful with dosage and timing,<br />In relation with heat stroke, it is a possible MDA toxic consequence but really uncommon. In Spain (warm country) we have 8-10 deaths/year associated to MDMA, and 45-50 associated to heat stroke and physical exercise in summer. Of course I agree that advice to get hydrated, not to do exhausting dance and search for fresh environments are valid. But, in practice, I think it is enough with applying common sense and don´t go to a rave in August in the desert during the day <br />The rest of the guide seems superb, good work.<br />To better organize my time and my work i´m posting here, but feel free to copy-paste to your thread if you like<br />

				smogmonster13<br /><br />The evidence that desmopressin is useful in improving memory is weak and based in old, low quality studies. There is no evidence that desmopressin is useful in that way. Cannabis alters short time memory by neuromodulation of cerebral CB receptors, not related with antidiuretic hormone (ADH). And even if that effect of desmopressine existed it should be of very limited magnitude. So I think it is useless in that way

				zipstyle<br /><br />Pharmacologically, GHB is a drug very similar to alcohol. It acts in a very similar way, effects are relatively similar, it is depressant for Central Nervous System on overdose and has a similar dependence potential. The difference is that, for alcohol, you can difference if you are drinking beer or tequila by taste. But knowing the dose of GHB is far more difficult. If you have a very reliable source or you do it by yourself, GHB safe dosage is possible. If not, it is very difficult. <br />I think there is enough good quality information about GHB dosage and effects in sources as Erowid...if you can be more concrete or have interest in discussing anything in particular...

				go4green<br />Bruxism (grinding teeth) is a common amphetamine or amphetamine derivative adverse effect. It can happen at recreational doses with speed, meth, MDMA, MDA...Initially, it should only last hours/days after use of these substances.&nbsp; But, for some people, when they start having a bruxism problem, it is often unaffected by the removal of the causal factor. Jaw movements are controlled by conscious and subconscious process in the brain. for some people bruxism is more important during the night (where subconscious processes are more common).<br />It would be important to rule out other well-known causes of bruxism (allergic reactions, prescription drugs, medical conditions...). It is also known that stress can trigger bruxism in susceptible persons. There are some effective treatments for bruxism (Biofeedback, Botox...). Some dietary supplements may alleviate bruxism, Magnesium is a well known supplement for this.

				LSDLucidity<br /><br />Sorry, but I don´t understand well the question. It is very difficult to have a general opinion on &quot;antidepressants&quot;, as&nbsp; I don´t have an opinion on antibiotics or anti hypertensives. Antidepressants is a wide family of drugs, which include 4 or 5 sub-families of molecules, all of them with their indications, adverse effects and toxicity problems. Some of them have been known and studies during decades, other are too new to have all data about security. They can be very useful for helping to treat several mental disorders if they are used properly. When they are used in treatment of mental health problems&nbsp; it is necessary to use also some kind of psychological or psychoterapeutical help. They don´t &quot;cure&quot; mental health problems but can help in some cases, as any other medications. They have their own adverse effects and toxicity problems as many other psychoactives. Over-prescription is a problem with this substances, but antidepressants have their own pros and cons as any other drug

				sharonneedles<br /><br />Amphetamines have been used during decades for improving cognitive performance in study. But, in a objective point of view, there are only a few scientific studies that have explored this, and most of them have methodological problems. One of the most recent and important is a study on 46 healthy volunteers taking Adderall 20 mg in a single occasion. It examined effects in 13 measures of cognitive ability (including episodic memory, working memory, inhibitory control, convergent creativity, intelligence and scholastic achievement...). The results did not reveal enhancement of any cognitive abilities by amphetamines for participants in general. But, nevertheless, participants&nbsp; believed their performance was more enhanced by the active capsule than by placebo. <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884611<br />In other studies, some authors they have found an effect of 10 mg of amphetamine (single occasion) on acute administration of d-amphetamine helping to bind different features of an item in memory, in turn leading to an increased ability to recollect both the item and its context.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20521323<br />Doses usually used for cognitive enhancement are between 5-20mg. You should consider also the possibility of adverse effects (insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, anorexia...) that may have influence in the exam results.<br />The idea that &quot;if you stop using you forget what you learnt&quot; has not a pharmacological explanation, I think it should be considered as a myth.

				theupsman1 <br /><br />The question of MDMA neurotoxicity is one of the most controversial and complex. First of all, we should define what we understand for &quot;neurotoxicity&quot;, because it is not clear that some of the changes observed mean a real toxic effect. For example, we can exactly measure the degree of liver toxicity caused by alcohol by blood tests, ecography, even biopsy. These tests have diagnostic and pronostic value and are universally admitted in this sense.<br />But, with MDMA, we still don´t know if changes in density neurorreceptors and images on PET or SPECT are indicative of neurotoxicity, and what are the clinical implications. Some studies (but not all) have found differences in memory in heavy MDMA users. Some studies (but not all) have shown that these deficit recover after some months-years of abstinence. What it is clear that these effects appear only in heavy-long term MDMA users and it is very difficult to know the exact role of MDMA, as there are many factors (lifestyle, use of other drugs...) that can mislead results.<br />There are so many things unclear on MDMA neurotoxicity that it is almost impossible to answer your concrete question. What is clear is that moderate use of MDMA (in dose and frequency) has not been linked to neurotoxic changes. The exact impact of age in heavy users is, as far as I know, impossible to determinat

So it is not possible to know if benzos are more or less adictive than heroin, but it is clear that both are drugs with high potential addictive.<br />Exact duration of abstinence symptoms depend on pharmacological characteristics of each benzodiacepine. But, in general, the acute phase lasts two months, and some symptoms are manifested in the 4-6 following months. <br />Abrupt supression of 1 mg alprazolam after 4-5 months of treatment will undoubtedly cause abstinence symptoms. They can last weeks and give severe symptoms. In this case abrupt supression is never recomemended.&nbsp; He should change to a benzodiacepine with a long half life&nbsp; and less potent ( for example, 10-20&nbsp; mg diazepam or 15-30 mg clorazepate) and slow dose reduction (2-5 mg/week) during 8 weeks.&nbsp; So, abstinence symptoms will be minimum

				sofish89<br /><br />Xyrem (pharmaceutic name of GHB) is only approved by FDA for treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy associated to narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a disturbed nocturnal sleep and an abnormal daytime sleep pattern, associated with an abnormal pattern of night sleep, but it is different to insomnia. The risks would be similar to other sleep treatments: potential of dependence, abstinence symptoms with abrupt discontinuation, risk of respiratory depression on overdose in combination with other CNS depressors, morning hangover...

				careb<br /><br />As you say, psychedelic drugs are not good for people who have suffered psychotic disorders, as it is can trigger a new episode. The evidence is clear for drugs as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cannabis or ayahuasca. For old dissociatives (phencyclidine) there are enough data too. There are some data that contraindicate new dissociatives (ketamine, DXM)in persons who have suffered psychotic disorders:<br />http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=953<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9272481<br />In my opinion, depressors (alcohol, GHB, opiates..) are the drugs less risky in this sense. But I insist &quot;in this sense&quot; because each drug has its own problems or particular risks. <br />

				Interesting thread :)<br />I sell MDMA caps, and I add caffeine (~80mg) to each one in order to help make up the fill weight, and also because I hoped that taking the drug along with caffeine might increase the short-term bioavailability, in the same way that it does for OTC &quot;express&quot; paracetamol and other such things that include caffeine to speed up onset.<br />I&#039;m not aware of any studies that have been done on the subject, but does this seem like a reasonable thing to be doing in your opinion?

				Citalopram atenuates the effects (psychological, physical, cardiovascular) of MDMA, at least in acute administration.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10731626<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11106307<br />It is possible that people who use citalopram regularly develop some degree of tolerance to this effect.<br />I have not professionally used MDMA as and adyuvant to psychotherapy, but I know some patients that have done, most with good results. Some psychoterapeuts use MDMA in this way, although they would face serious legal problems if they are discovered. The problem is the lack of controlled clinical trials and the negative disposition of sanitary authorities to authorize and promote these studies. <br />To know more about therapeutic use of MDMA, the best web is:&nbsp; http://www.maps.org

				DopeSneaky<br /><br />Amphetamine, meth and MDMA are drugs with a very similar chemical structure and the three of them can develop tolerance with regular use. So it is reasonable to suppose that tolerance to one of them will lead to develop cross-tolerance to others. In your case it is probable that regular use of amphetamine/meth will decrease some MDMA effects.Cocaine, at least on theory, would be unaffected. Note that these are only suppositions based on pharmacology, and you have to consider other factors (including setting, dose, expectatives...)<br />5-HTP is probably harmless but there are no scientific data to support its use before/after MDMA.<br /><br />The degree and probability of cardiovascular damage with amphetamines depend on frequency, dose and personal susceptibility. You could control your cardiac frequency and blood presure as indirect indicators on the response of your body to amphetamines. In general, it would be better to train without amphetamines (or some time after their effect is finished). Regular use is more dangerous than occasional.<br /><br /><br />

				cerealbox<br /><br />You should first consult your doctor. The liver doesn´t have receptors for pain, that is, liver doesn´t hurt (except in final stages of some severe hepatic diseases, that does not seem to be your case). So it doesn´t seem likely that your problem is caused by an hepatic problem related to alcohol. It may be other kind of problem (gastritis, peptic or duodenal ulcer...) related to binge drinking or not, but hepatic disease is not likely.<br />

				SuperHans68<br />When you use a drug IV the substance goes to the right side of your heart through veins, passes to lungs, then back to the left part of the heart and then is distributed to brain through arteries. Most drugs act on different parts of the brain, the exact mechanism depend on the substance. Some drugs act on specific cerebral receptors (opiates, cannabis), other act on cerebral receptors used for other tasks (cocaine, MDMA, LSD...).&nbsp; Neurons are physically separated and, in the space between two neurons there are some compounds called enzymes that degrade drugs. First the drug acts on the receptor and then it is degraded by enzymes.

Unfortunately there are no data on humans to recommend its use in Alzheimer disease. Humans are far more complicated than animals (even the closest primates) and data on animals can never be extrapolated. <br /><br />One question with schizophrenia susceptibility is that there are no 100% sure tests to measure it. It is assumed that familiar antecedents and story of mental health problems are risks factors. Schizophrenia usually starts before 20-24 years, it is uncommon that it debuts after 25 year old. If you had this disposition it is very likely that you were diagnosed now. Psychedelic drugs can be a &quot;triggering factor&quot; for schizophrenia but there exist many other conditions (parental divorce, break-up with couple, military service...) that can do the same.<br />

(taking magnesium and vit c before MDMA, and htp5 after)<br />I myself take magnesium and melatonin for MDMA (not usually vit. c since i started to eat more vegetables and fruits), and from times to times when taking amphetamines I tend to use a supplement for &quot;memory&quot; which is b1 b6 b12 and L-phenylanine. and melatonin as antioxidant. <br />What would you recommend for searching scientific papers on drug research?<br />(...)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The evidence to reccomend&nbsp; supplements is extremely weak. Most regimes are based on studies on animals. These studies are not designed to search neuroprotective drugs applicable to humans. They pretend to discover the molecular mechanisms behind MDMA neurotoxicity. The doses used in these studies are far away to these used in humans. One rat weights 0.1 kg; the dose in studies is 5-10 mg/kg/2 hours/4 times. That means, that, extrapolating to humans, 4-5 gr of injected pure MDMA.<br />In addition, there is a great inter-species different sensibility to MDMA neurotoxicity in mammals (rabbits, rats, monkeys...) Even with the same species, some strains of animals ( Sprague-Dawley or Dark Agouti rats) show different sensibility to this effects. Many times rats must be keeped in freezers during studies ;if not, they die because of the massive MDMA doses. In summary, data from studies are no worthy to humans. Most of these substances are innocuous, but there are no data that suggest efficacy.<br /><br />To search scientific papers I will tell you my ultra-secret-trick<br />1) You enter this web: http://www.sci-hub.org/<br />2) You enter in the box the title of the article you have searched previously on PubMed, for example<br />3) You obtain the pdf cracked version. <br />It doesn´t work always, but 50-70%

Warfarin does not interact with other prescription drugs structurally similar to LSD, like ergotamine. I don´t know what is the cause that LSD has no effect on you but I don´t believe it is a pharmacologic interaction problem

I could´t find any data about this interaction in the US National Library of Medicine. I don´t think it is a predictable interaction based on the way of action of both substances. Warfarin and LSD are well known drugs for decades and this interaction has not been previously described as far as I know.<br />There are several articles about illegal/prescription drugs interactions and this is not mentioned:<br />http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/health/health_article1.pdf<br /><br />I can´t say that is a problem of your LSD quality but you should rule out this possibility first. If in your country there is no Drug Testing Service available you can look your LSD under a ultraviolet-black light: LSD has a fluorescent reaction under it.<br /><br />If your LSD is right we could consider the drug interaction possibility. It is true that not all the possible interactions are described and, as LSD is an illegal drug some kind of interaction should not be described yet in scientific literature. But I don´t think it is the first option to explain the problem

All of them are studies in rats. The first did not show changes that suggest neurotoxicity in rat brains. The second suggests that high doses of methylone or medium doses with methamphetamine can cause neurotoxicity. The last shows shows little effect of methylone in mice, and changes suggesting neurotoxicity in rats.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/~cozz/Mephedrone%20and%20methylone%20transporters.%20Baumann.%20Neuropsychopharmacology,%20doi%2010.1038-np.2011.304%20%282011%29.pdf<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137202/<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23099177<br /><br />According to its molecular structure and comparing with other similar drugs it is possible that methylone can cause some neurotoxic changes. If which way this is relevant to humans or not it is unknown in this moment.<br /><br />I can´t reccomend or suggest a safe use in terms of dose or frequency, based on scientific research.&nbsp; And if you ask me for my &quot;personal opinion&quot; I don´t think it is an interesting substance. Shulgin said: &quot;[Methylone] has almost the same potency of MDMA, but it does not produce the same effects. It has an almost antidepressant action, pleasant and positive, but not the unique magic of MDMA.&quot; And there have been some deaths directly related to methylone, some of them with low doses. Considering that it is not a drug as spread as others (LSD, MDMA, meth, GHB...) and the relatively high number of deaths (in comparision with its relative low use in general population) I think there are substances less risky and more pleasurable. But this is only my personal opinion.<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22582221<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22589523<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318528

Some of the most prescribed medications for headache are 20-50% more potent than a placebo. Effects of psychoactives like mescaline are particularly sensitive to placebo effects. If you know the techniques and have ability, sometimes you could cut a bad trip of LSD with an aspirin or whatever thing in pill.

He gives his actual information, but I suppose anyone can do this on TOR.&nbsp; However, he also links to actual studies, so the information is still viable.&nbsp; That of which he has not linked, and I looked up seems to be legit as well, even though I am not qualified to interpret some of the results as much as he has.<br /><br />Doc X: <br /><br />I read above that marijuana is actually not a good drug choice for those who study or do intellectual work.&nbsp; I have to agree.&nbsp; My line of work is particularly intellectual, and during my study in university, I found I had to abstain from it in order to really get into my work.<br /><br />My questions are:<br />1) Can even moderate (perhaps 2-3 times per week) usage cause memory and cognitive problems?&nbsp; <br />2) Why is it that some seem to not have this blunting effect with marijuana? Is it that they are so smart that being blunted has no effect or does this just happen to some individuals more than others?<br />3) Would there be any difference in strains like indica/sativa and hybrids and cognitive problems?<br />4) I have been on a benzodiazipine/klonopin for nearly 7 years.&nbsp; I fear getting off of it now because I&#039;ve read that after being on them for so long, the brain almost automatically adjusts to them.&nbsp; Should I attempt to come off of them with the assistance of a Dr?

				I got a question, mainly about research chemicals and their long-term effects. I&#039;ve dug up as much info as I can on it (online, bought a $130 book on toxic pharmacology, etc.) but still have questions about persistent symptoms I&#039;m having. I used to use 4-MMC, methylone, 4-FA,&nbsp; 4-EMC, and MXE with my use spread out over a 2 year period in small quantities. Apart from the 2-3 times I&#039;ve gotten out of control with 4MMC, I was pretty good about using everything carefully and only tiny doses, only bought 8g total of any of this stuff, as I was broke back then and RC&#039;s were cheap and plentiful. <br /><br />Anyways, currently I have permanent bruxism and problems with my vision. What made me quit was when I started seeing floaters and swirls of light in my vision 24/7 after a night of methylone, whether my eyes are opened or closed, I still see things. I tested 2 anti-psychotics out recently (seroquel and lamictal), and they make the swirls away, so I think I&#039;ve been hallucinating for a long time now without realizing it&nbsp; :-\. I&#039;d like to know if I should be concerned about any brain damage or possible mental health conditions down the road and how to mitigate any potential risks. I longer mess with RC&#039;s or any dodgy/illegal stuff but I do still drink beer from time to time. Thanks.

Is it that they are so smart that being blunted has no effect or does this just happen to some individuals more than others?<br />3) Would there be any difference in strains like indica/sativa and hybrids and cognitive problems?<br />4) I have been on a benzodiazipine/klonopin for nearly 7 years.&nbsp; I fear getting off of it now because I&#039;ve read that after being on them for so long, the brain almost automatically adjusts to them.&nbsp; Should I attempt to come off of them with the assistance of a Dr?

Do you think people with severe physical or mental/emotional distress that consumes their lives and may always do so to a large extent deserve that right?<br /><br />Lastly, thank you very much for your contributions. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1) Short time memory is the neurocognitive field more affected by cannabis use. This effect is dose-dependent, although some people are more sensitive to this effect. Probably a 2-3 joints a week pattern of use does not have a significant effect in this way, at least for most people. It also depends on the variety of cannabis used (% of THC)<br />http://whyprohibition.com/sites/default/files/Grant%20Neurocognitive%20Effects%20of%20Cannabis%20JINS%202003.pdf<br /><br />2)&nbsp; Adverse effects of any prescription or illegal drug depends on many factors. Individual sensitivity is very important. Most people can use aspirin without problems but some of them develop an ulcer. Here is the same<br /><br />3) Yes. Usually Cannabis sativa has higher levels of THC than Cannabis indica. THC is the most relevant cannabinoid responsible of psychoactive and neurocognitive effects. High levels of CBD diminsh these effects.<br /><br />4)In general, to diminish and quit benzodiacepines is easier using a long-lasting action benzodiacepine as clorazepate, clordiazepoxide or diazepam.&nbsp; But it is also possible to lower doses of clonazepam. A doctor help can be useful to choose the right option for you in your particular circumpstances.<br /><br />5) I think SR is an intelligent way to obtain illegal psychoactives avoiding or diminishing most of the inconvenients and risks of black market. I think the way opened by SR will have a significant impact on the stupid war against drugs<br /><br />6) Europe is slightly more developed in risk and harm reduction politics on drugs. But only slightly. In Europe most of the prevention is based on fear and repression (as in the States) but it is true that things like Drug Testing Services are easier (but poorly financed by public institutions). On the other hand, in the States are based webs like Erowid or MAPS... People who work in risk reductions are accused of &quot;promote drug use&quot; and these things, but we accept it as part of the game. Aaaah...and it would be very funny for me to be on FoxTV&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />7) I don´t know the answer. Some people have a personal relation with drugs, for other this relation is only professional. Anyway, you don´t need to be diabetic if you want to become a doctor expert on diabetes. Although, if you are diabetic it will give you a different perspective...<br /><br />8) I think people should have the right to have a death with dignity

I&#039;ve dug up as much info as I can on it (online, bought a $130 book on toxic pharmacology, etc.) but still have questions about persistent symptoms I&#039;m having. I used to use 4-MMC, methylone, 4-FA,&nbsp; 4-EMC, and MXE with my use spread out over a 2 year period in small quantities. Apart from the 2-3 times I&#039;ve gotten out of control with 4MMC, I was pretty good about using everything carefully and only tiny doses, only bought 8g total of any of this stuff, as I was broke back then and RC&#039;s were cheap and plentiful. <br /><br />Anyways, currently I have permanent bruxism and problems with my vision. What made me quit was when I started seeing floaters and swirls of light in my vision 24/7 after a night of methylone, whether my eyes are opened or closed, I still see things. I tested 2 anti-psychotics out recently (seroquel and lamictal), and they make the swirls away, so I think I&#039;ve been hallucinating for a long time now without realizing it&nbsp; :-\. I&#039;d like to know if I should be concerned about any brain damage or possible mental health conditions down the road and how to mitigate any potential risks. I longer mess with RC&#039;s or any dodgy/illegal stuff but I do still drink beer from time to time. Thanks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We have discussed previously in this thread about the potential harms related to RCs. There is little experience with substances like&nbsp; 4-MMC, methylone, 4-FA,&nbsp; 4-EMC, and MXE.It is not clear if 4-FA is neurotoxic or not. MXE is clearly related with reversible cerebellar toxicity and cathinone derivatives are known to cause problems, although they are so new and experience is so small that it is impossible to know what are &quot;safe&quot; doses.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22108839<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22578175<br />If your problems are persistent I think you should search for direct, personal and professional attention. We can´t give advice through Internet about if you need exams or treatment, but if symptoms persist after weeks of abstinence I think it would be important to search for help.

In general is more dangerous (and less pleasurable) to mix substances with similar properties (stimulants: speed+meth, meth+coke..., depressors: GHB+alcohol, alcohol+opiates). Moderate doses of downers after stimulants probably don´t suppose dramatic risks if they are used properly, in a safe environment and with reasonable doses. To use some cannabis at home after partying with MDMA, for example, is not necessary terrible in risks. But to drink huge amounts of alcohol, mixing with high doses of cocaine to diminish the depressor effect is probably dangerous. That´s why so important to know the properties of the substances you are mixing. I think answers can be contradictory because &quot;mixing uppers and downers&quot; can refer to many different situations involving different risks

I think all these details are important, if not, the idea can be misunderstood. <br /><br />In fact, I assume that MDMA is neurotoxic too. If neurotoxic changes have been detected in all animal species, in human there will be a dose that will cause neurotoxic changes.&nbsp; But this dose (unknown) does not seem to be close to recreational ones (120-150 mg with maybe 1-2 half boosters 2 hours after). <br /><br />People who use MDMA at higher doses or frequencies are probably more exposed to these risks. Megadoses of some SSRIs have showed some neuroprotective effects in animal models but, interescalating species, you should use toxic doses of fluoxetine or citalopram to imitate this effect. What concrete SSRI should you use? After any dose of MDMA or only at high doses? What dose? Should you take it&nbsp; after, during or before MDMA? What dose and frequency?...<br /><br />There is no way to know the exact answer to these questions. The theorical bases of SSRI use as neuroprotectors in humans are so weak that, in my opinion, are not enough to consider it&nbsp; as a potential harm reduction strategy. In relation with MDMA and avoiding neurotoxic effects, the safest and most effective strategy is not to use it regularly (once a month or, preferabely, less) and moderate dosification. It is also the best way to enjoy the effects and diminish or avoid &quot;loss of magic&quot;.<br /><br />As far as I know, there are no human or animal studies on SAM-e&nbsp; (S-adénosyl-methionina) and MDMA. According to mechanisms of MDMA toxicity and SAM-e way of action I think it would be useless, but it is only theoretical speculation.

But in the other hand it is clear that amphetamine sulphate has been used daily over decades at doses 10-20 mg (even 40) without noticing a dramatic raise in cardiovascular problems in general population.

				Hello DoctorX,<br />First I would like that I really appreciate what you are doing for us guys here. It is often hard to get reliable information about drugs. Anyways I got a question about combining 25c-NBOMe and MDMA. A friend of mine dropped 800mg of the 25c and 150mg MDMA a 2 nights ago and still did not sleep yet. He is still dancing around in the room to the music and does totally ignore that he should sleep. <br />And another question, I am not sure if it was asked already, but do you know something about the long time harms of weekly usage of 25c-NBOMe?<br />Thanks in advance.

				Doctor,<br />I have been prescribed &lt;20mg of Adderall for a couple of years for ADHD. Recently I have decided to start exercising and generally caring about my health. During some research I have seen mention that Adderall&#039;s amphetamine mixture causes an increase in BP and heart-rate more so than pure dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine). With my limited knowledge Dexedrine seems like a potentially safer Adderall alternative that may be worth a try. Any additional informational on exercise and amphetamines or any related subject would be appreciated. I understand long-term amphetamine use is a risk-factor but at this point in time I will take my chances.<br /><br />P.S. - Perhaps you could give me a quick pointer on the best ways of finding applicable and reputable literature/research online. I saw mention of PubMed and Sci-Hub so far.<br /><br />Thank you very much for answering so many questions. ;D I have donated what I can, which wasn&#039;t much.&nbsp; :-\<br />

My understanding of epilepsy is that everyone has some sort of seizure threshold, and potentially can have an epileptic fit. I know she was complaining of it all getting too much, she said everything was just rushing at her eyes and there was way too much to take in. This was when she said she couldn&#039;t see, and I believe it was getting too much even when her eyes were shut.<br /><br />Is it possible then that the hallucinations she experienced were powerful enough to set off an epileptic seizure in someone with no history of epilepsy? If so, does this mean she will have a lower seizure threshold in future? I know she&#039;s not going to jump back in on the same dose of LSD straight away, but if she was to take a similar amount, is there a good chance the hallcuinations would again become too overwhelming? I know you won&#039;t be able to answer such questions with any certainty, but I value your opinion.<br /><br />My theory regarding her lack of consciousness (if it was a panic attack), is that she had a panic attack just as she experienced ego death, the experience of ego death rendering her seemingly un/semi-conscious. She was in the fetal position, and would move intermittently. She would make noise, and would be able to communicate with me but could not muster up the effort to say many actual words. There is no doubt she experienced ego death during this period.<br /><br />I am certainly not trying to challenge your knowledge or opinion which is much more credible than my own, but is it actually possible that fear could trigger an epileptic seizure?

By the same reason, cocaine is not good for everyone and people susceptible to anxiety will suffer this effect. I can´t think of another help. But there are many different drugs...

				Hi Doctor,<br /><br />I got some pure Diethyl Ether from a laboratory, and no matter how much vapors I inhaled- it had no effect.<br /><br />I am on the medication Duloxetine (for Dysthymia, though I don&#039;t really think it does anything and I am not really depressed, I just struggle with motivation and drive).<br /><br />I am wondering if there is any basis to believing Duloxetine could have blocked the effects of Diethyl Ether?<br /><br />I believe Diethyl ether is an NMDA antagonist and I am wondering if Ketamine will work while on Duloxetine because it is also the same?<br /><br />Thank you

Indeed in my case Benzo&#039;s are the greater threat than Opiates. Benzo&#039;s make me want &quot;more more more&quot;, while I feel content and satiated when I take opiates. I take everything orally, though I am willing to consider snorting some substances or even perhaps IM injection, but only on the absolute HIGHEST QUALITY merchandise.

				Clinical trials don´t show that there is a significative increment of blood presure and pulse under Adderall. So, in this sense, there is no need to adjust or change if you are thinking about doing physical exercise. There are some cases of cardiovascular disease in Adderall use, but they are very rare and it doesn´t seem to be a significative risk. Technical sheet from FDA doesn´t say anything about physical exercise so the combination should be considered safe, at least for most people. <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16182674<br />I´m sorry I have no time to explain how to search in PubMed.

Thanks a lot for this thread DoctorX. <br /><br />I made a thread about my friend having a seizure after taking LSD, followed by a period of semi-consciousness and then an intense migraine and vomiting. I now believe it was a panic attack set off by a bad trip, but I know my friend would love to hear your opinion.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165311.0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is very difficult to know what can exactly have happened. It could be a panic attack. But it is very uncommon that a panic attack causes a complete lose of consciousness. The sequence ( short time of complete lose of consciousness followed by a post critic state with symptoms) could correspond to a seizure (epileptic-like). I can´t confirm it 100% but it sounds possible to the story, as I have read in your thread. If case she is taking LSD or stimulants, she should be careful with doses, stay with someone else and consult to a doctor if something strange happens<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for taking the time to read my thread. My understanding of epilepsy is that everyone has some sort of seizure threshold, and potentially can have an epileptic fit. I know she was complaining of it all getting too much, she said everything was just rushing at her eyes and there was way too much to take in. This was when she said she couldn&#039;t see, and I believe it was getting too much even when her eyes were shut.<br /><br />Is it possible then that the hallucinations she experienced were powerful enough to set off an epileptic seizure in someone with no history of epilepsy? If so, does this mean she will have a lower seizure threshold in future? I know she&#039;s not going to jump back in on the same dose of LSD straight away, but if she was to take a similar amount, is there a good chance the hallcuinations would again become too overwhelming? I know you won&#039;t be able to answer such questions with any certainty, but I value your opinion.<br /><br />My theory regarding her lack of consciousness (if it was a panic attack), is that she had a panic attack just as she experienced ego death, the experience of ego death rendering her seemingly un/semi-conscious. She was in the fetal position, and would move intermittently. She would make noise, and would be able to communicate with me but could not muster up the effort to say many actual words. There is no doubt she experienced ego death during this period.<br /><br />I am certainly not trying to challenge your knowledge or opinion which is much more credible than my own, but is it actually possible that fear could trigger an epileptic seizure? She fell to the ground screaming, and this was preceded by a very definite increase in stress and fear and panic. I have never seen someone have their *first* epileptic seizure though... is it possible that someone would get very scared as they began to experience the prelude to an epileptic seizure?<br /><br />On a side note, there were no flashing lights and it was actually getting progressively darker at the time. If it was epileptic, do you think her not being able to see (except hallucinations) was an early symptom of the epileptic attack set off by an unknown cause, or is it more likely to be the cause itself?<br /><br />I&#039;ve probably repeated myself a bunch of times there, sorry. She is perfectly fine and happy now and had a wonderful experience, but out of my group of friends I&#039;m &quot;the one&quot; who does the most research and who gets to know all of this stuff etc. so I still feel a certain responsibility about all of this, and I want to be able to offer sound advice where possible. Thanks a lot DoctorX, awesome work you&#039;re doing here!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In general, panic attacks don´t trigger an epileptic seizure.In fact, epileptic seizures are not a known complication of LSD use (at least in healthy, non-epileptic persons) although LSD use is contraindicated in epileptic persons.In medicine, it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish between a panic attack and an epileptic seizure. I can´t be sure about what has happened with your friend. The story resembles more of seizure but it is not a sure diagnosis. In my professional experience, when someone has suffered a very unpleasant experience on LSD at his first experiences, there is more chances the bad experience will repeat with subsequent uses of the same substance. It is not always in 100% cases but I have seen it many times.

				What are your thoughts on Cocaethylene, or combining cocaine and alcohol? Someone brought it up in this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164746.0<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new to cocaine, and I&#039;ve almost always drank alcohol with it. Now I find it hard to do either cocaine or alcohol separately, because when I drink I have strong cravings for coke, and when I do coke, I usually want to drink. I use fairly small amounts of each (2-5 beers combined with a few bumps or small lines of coke - maybe a total of 100 mg each time). Am I doing myself a lot of damage here, or is that only in people who are much heavier drinkers/users? I&#039;m quite healthy otherwise.

And using low doses will make the desired effects unnoticeable,&nbsp; even in the first days. <br /><br />Shulgin was the first who described this properties of MDMA in PIHKAL:<br /><br />&quot;In one study, MDMA was consumed at 9:00 a.m. each day for almost a week (120 milligrams the first day and 160 milligrams each subsequent day) and by the fifth day there were no effects from the drug except for some mydriasis. And even this appeared to be lost on the sixth day. (...) A complete holiday from any drug for another 6 days led to the reversal of this tolerance, in that 120 milligrams of MDMA had substantially the full expected effects.&quot;<br /><br />And this tolerance phenomenon has been confirmed in many clinical trials. So, with no doubt, the pattern of use proposed here is useless.

Such a study does not exist. But your reasoning is out of scientific rules. In science, demonstration and argumentation must be positive. There is no study that show that consuming MDMA in small doses daily does not change behaviour. There are no proofs that there aren´t nazi spaceships on the moon. The fact that there aren´t proofs does not mean that something is or can be true. (I hope you understand my idea even though my English is limited ;) .

				Hi DoctorX,<br /><br />Thanks for your time!<br /><br />My question is about MDMA dosage.&nbsp; I saw one of your previous messages advised 70-100mg for women or first time users, but is body weight a factor?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen conflicting information about this some places say 1.5-2.0mg/kg, others just recommend amounts without taking into account sex and weight.&nbsp; Particularly the MAPS ptsd protocol below doses 125 mg without considering sex and weight.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course I could be missing something I don&#039;t read clinical trial protocols for a living&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I&#039;m 150 lbs(68 kg) and find that ~125 mg is my sweet spot so that&#039;s inline with both 1.5-2.0 mg/kg and the recommended amounts.<br /><br />Anyway some friends of mine will be trying MDMA for the first time this summer and some are taller/wider than others and I want to make sure they have a good time&nbsp; 8)<br />I currently plan on giving 100-125mg based on their personalities.

Someone brought it up in this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164746.0<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new to cocaine, and I&#039;ve almost always drank alcohol with it. Now I find it hard to do either cocaine or alcohol separately, because when I drink I have strong cravings for coke, and when I do coke, I usually want to drink. I use fairly small amounts of each (2-5 beers combined with a few bumps or small lines of coke - maybe a total of 100 mg each time). Am I doing myself a lot of damage here, or is that only in people who are much heavier drinkers/users? I&#039;m quite healthy otherwise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Most of the ideas discussed in this thread about MDMA neurotoxicity are aplicable to cocaethylene. The combination of cocaine and alcohol increases neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. But the basis for this is animal model studies, where very heavy doses of both substances are used. It is not clear in what extent&nbsp; these effects are extrapolable to humans.<br /><br />When a combination of drugs is clinically relevant in toxicity terms, there are many data about it ( e.g.: GHB+alcohol) There are no clinical studies showing that moderate doses of cocaine and alcohol produce more harm than both substances separately. It is very probable that, at the doses you are using in healthy people, the risks are moderate. Risk in this sense is probably dose and frequency dependent, and heavy users of this combination will be the most exposed.

In general, I think it is more wise to wait until SSRI treatment is finished.

				Hola Doc, <br />Just curious if you knew about any possible interactions between LSD\alprazolam\anti-psychotics, in the context of taking either or both coming down from, or to end an LSD trip prematurely. I&#039;ve read anti-psychotics work best for bringing you back down to earth quickly, but it seems like a small dose of xanax to try to help cope with it and then an anti-psychotic as a back-up if that doesn&#039;t work would be ideal.

First of all most psychoactives are not neurotoxic ( basically alcohol and some amphetamines can have neurotoxic effects in some patterns of use ), but cocaine, cannabis, opiates and &quot;classical&quot; psychedelics are not. So there can´t be a protective effect. On the other hand, water-soluble vitamines are harmless (eliminated with urine) but lipophillic vitamines can be toxic in overdose.<br /><br />The question of long-term effects of RCs depends on the substance. Some of the drugs you cite (AMT, 5-MeO-DMT) have been known for decades and it is not probable that cause long term problems. In fact, there are a few substances that can cause &quot;some kind of neurodegenerative/etc disease being directly caused by the drug action, and with a high prevalence of the disease in the people who tried it&quot;. MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) is the classical example. But risks of RCs are basically unknown and potentially higher than classical substances.<br /><br />In Spain the most important change in drugs is related to Cannabis Associations. Personal use of drugs is not a criminal offense in Spain and it is technically possible to associate to cultivate cannabis. It is an interesting way to unblock the prohibition (at least on cannabis). I think there will be substantial changes in following years although South America seems now to be on the first line. But I´m not an expert&nbsp; on drug politics. <br /><br />The idea of a drug with only pleasurable effects and no adverse effects is an uthopy. All prescription drugs in the world have adverse and toxic effects, they are properties inherent to the substances.<br /><br />The difference between methyl and ethylphenidate is not only a patent. Methylphenidate has been used for decades and widely studied. There are 6528 studies on MedLine of this substance and only 16 of ethylphenidate (none of them in humans). And sometimes a single atom of carbon can make a big difference. Ethanol is the alcohol of beverages, methanol is a toxin for human eye that can make you blind. I don´t mean that it happens the same with methyl and ethyphenidate but the fact that two molecules are similar does not necessarily mean that effects and risks are so.

Maybe this could interact with the drug too? Maybe drugs can even be perfected using this substance to make it hit faster?<br /><br />Also i figured when i use dolormin the headache is gone forever most of the times. Feels like it has healing powers too! maybe that could even help avoid getting something destroyed in the brain by the drug? At least it can maybe help to heal the parts that got destroyed (or attacked) better?<br /><br />Thanks for your time in advance and have a great day!<br />

				First of all: Thank you for your feedback and the service you provide here, DoctorX.<br /><br />As a person with +14 years of experience with cocaine, without making it a daily habbit (Yes, that demands allot of self control). I am curious, as to what your experience with cocaine and cocaine users may be? I don&#039;t have a particular question as such. I am merely queries about the feedback we may be able to give each other. <br /><br />For instance: My advice to users of cocaine, that have startet to realise that it is starting to be &quot;too much&quot;.<br /><br />1: Break the cocaine - sex, associations. <br /><br />Hopefully I am not the only one here, that knows what I am talking about?<br />&nbsp;

				A mid-forties female has been suffering recurrent anxiety episodes that lead to respiratory distress with hyperventilation syndrome.&nbsp; Following a particularly serious attack of this type, a medical screening and detailed exam showed &quot;no evidence of any type of acute emergency process at this time.&quot;&nbsp; BP at the time was mildly elevated -- enough to suggest ongoing treatment for hypertension.<br /><br />The patient&#039;s subjective experience of the recent, particularly serious attack includes the following:<br />- A multitude of voices shouting in her head, mixed with an overwhelming clamour of noise in general<br />- &quot;I felt like I was dying&quot;<br />- Extreme confusion about her physical location.&nbsp; At different times during the episode, she clearly stated her location as two different places that are separated by 100 miles or more.<br /><br />The patient has a history of &quot;seizures&quot; that have been recurring infrequently for more than 20 years.&nbsp; Information about the exact nature of these episodes is sparse, but some of the incidents did lead to ER visits and medical exams.&nbsp; At no time did any medical exams produce a diagnosis of any organic process causing these &quot;seizures,&quot; and they have always been attributed to general anxiety.&nbsp; &nbsp;For much of this historical period she has been a very heavy smoker of cannabis.&nbsp; Light drinker, 1/4 pack per day cigarette smoker, no other drugs of abuse.<br /><br />Physically the patient is very slender.&nbsp; Her measured body temperature tends to be lower than normal, yet her skin feels warm to the touch -- warmer than an average person.&nbsp; She states that she has had &quot;thyroid problems&quot;in the past&nbsp; but we have no specific information about those.<br /><br />Two weeks prior to the most recent spate of anxiety attacks, the patient used DMT for the first time.&nbsp; This was her first genuine psychedelic experience of any kind.&nbsp; In the immediate aftermath of the trip she reported the usual feelings of wonder, awe, and amazement, expressing a desire to do it again as soon as possible and try a higher dose to achieve &quot;breakthrough.&quot;<br /><br />However in the two week period that followed, this already slender woman lost 10 lbs, became increasingly anxious and irritable, and finally began having the acute anxiety attacks that culminated in something resembling a psychotic break.<br /><br />The patient believes that the DMT trip caused, or at least precipitated, her psychiatric symptoms.<br /><br />Any thoughts?

Probably this effect it is not very big (would notice more with higher 2C-B dose) but I think psychedelic effects could be more subtle, and after effects (hangover) higher

				I know MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity is somewhat of a controversial topic. According to what I&#039;ve read, which may be wrong, you can find almost equal amounts of evidence on either side, as to it being neurotoxic or not. So try and be as explanatory as you can, shatter my illusions, or whatnot.<br /><br />Will rolling on it now have a significant effect on me later in life? People often say neurotoxic, but never state what this implies. Will it be safer if I limit the usage to a few times a year, or is this still not desirable? Would rolling every couple of weeks have a significantly awful effect on me later in life, specifically?<br /><br />Give a conservative answer if you must, but a reasonable one. :) I love MDMA, but may want to limit the usage in case of any of these things.

These are responsibles of the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids in some diseases (nauseas in chemotherapy, multiple sclerosis, neuropatic pain, wasting-HIV syndrome...). CNS response produces an activation of endocrine system (sexual and thyroid hormons, growth hormone...) although these changes are not significant to humans, considering pattern of use. SOme experiments have shown infertility in animals who receive high doses of cannabinoids, but these data are not extrapolable to humans.<br />More on neuroendocrine effects of cannabis: http://www.ukcia.org/research/EndocrineEffects.pdf<br /><br />There is no evidence that salves, creams or oints have effect on topic use. Cannabinoids do not trespass the skin.<br /><br />As a medical practicioner I prefer synthetic compounds to natural ones in medicine. Prescription drugs allow isolate molecules and calculate the exact dose. I don´t beleive that natural plants are better than medicines only by the fact that the first are &quot;natural&quot;. Of course I beleive also that the plant of cannabis can have benefits on health if properly used but, in a therapeutical perspective, I prefer prescription drugs. There are some important points or details (for example, the fact that the sublingual extract of cannabis Sativex costs more than 400$), but that is other story...<br />&nbsp;

I am curious, as to what your experience with cocaine and cocaine users may be? I don&#039;t have a particular question as such. I am merely queries about the feedback we may be able to give each other. <br /><br />For instance: My advice to users of cocaine, that have startet to realise that it is starting to be &quot;too much&quot;.<br /><br />1: Break the cocaine - sex, associations. <br /><br />Hopefully I am not the only one here, that knows what I am talking about?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cocaine is a drug that can be more difficult to control than others. It doesn´t mean&nbsp; that everybody who tries it, even who use it regularly, will have a dependence problem.&nbsp; But dependence and abuse are a frequent complication compared with other drugs.<br /><br />Beyond neurochemical and pharmacological questions, I think the cause for this is that cocaine is a drug very useful for cotidiane activities. I explain. For most people it is difficult to work, study or do routine activities on LSD, MDMA, cannabis or alcohol. But cocaine is a drug that fits very well in this sense. Even, it is possible that, in short time, one can work or study better using cocaine. So it is a drug that can easily go beyond the frontier between recreative and cotidiane activities. In general, recreational use of drugs is less risky than instrumental, operative use. If one person starts using cocaine outside recreative settings and use it for work in a daily pattern of use, it is more probable that will have associated problems.<br /><br />Cocaine users must be conscious about their pattern of use. I don´t think control is impossible, but, at least for some people, it can be more difficult than for other drugs

There is only one thing that sounds strange in the story. The fact that &quot; a multitude of voices shouting in her head, mixed with an overwhelming clamour of noise in general&quot; does not coincide with panic attacks. There are some rare diseases (like temporal epilepsy) that can curse with symptoms like that. I´m not stating that is the cause of the problem, I´m only pointing one possibility and the idea that, in general, auditive alucinations are not typical of panic or anxiety.<br /><br />Of course DMT can trigger a psychotic problem. It is an uncommon situation but, in my experience this can happen more frequently with DMT than other drugs. In general, these episodies&nbsp; occur in pre-morbid, predisposed personalities. The symptoms you describe could indicate this (once more, it is only a possibility, I can´t be 100% sure). Anyway, if she is experiencing psychotic symptoms I think she should search for professional help. DMT psychosis usually have an excelent response to antipsychotics and 2-3 months are enough for most patients. It is important also to avoid DMT and psychedelics in general.

				Hola Doc, <br /><br />I am an occasional (2-3 a month) user of stimulants (coke, amphetamines, modafinil, mephedrone, nicotine). I&#039;ve been running (jogging) outside 3-4 times a week for 3 months with no problems whatsoever.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve used mephedrone last week and nicotine daily (electronic cigarette). Since then, whenever I go for a jog, I have to stop after 3 minutes because there is a strong pain in my heart. I don&#039;t feel breathless, I just have to stop because of the pain. Once I stop running, the pain disappears. <br /><br />1) do stimulants have a long-term negative effect on your heart ? <br />2) does this pain could be related to mephedrone use or nicotine ? <br /><br />Muchas Gracias !

According to what I&#039;ve read, which may be wrong, you can find almost equal amounts of evidence on either side, as to it being neurotoxic or not. So try and be as explanatory as you can, shatter my illusions, or whatnot.<br /><br />Will rolling on it now have a significant effect on me later in life? People often say neurotoxic, but never state what this implies. Will it be safer if I limit the usage to a few times a year, or is this still not desirable? Would rolling every couple of weeks have a significantly awful effect on me later in life, specifically?<br /><br />Give a conservative answer if you must, but a reasonable one. :) I love MDMA, but may want to limit the usage in case of any of these things.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is evidence that intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of high doses of MDMA produces neurotoxic changes in all animal species studied. But these results of animal studies are not directly extrapolable to humans. The doses used in these studies are far away to these used in humans. One rat weights 0.1 kg; the dose in studies is 5-10 mg/kg/2 hours/4 times. That means, that, extrapolating to humans, 4-5 gr of injected pure MDMA.<br />In addition, there is a great inter-species different sensibility to MDMA neurotoxicity in mammals (rabbits, rats, monkeys...) Even with the same species, some strains of animals ( Sprague-Dawley or Dark Agouti rats) show different sensibility to this effects. Many times rats must be keeped in freezers during studies ;if not, they die because of the massive MDMA doses. In summary, data from studies are no worthy to humans. <br />&nbsp;There is no evidence that occasional moderate doses (lower than 120-150 mg oral) have any neurotoxic effects in humans. In fact at least four investigation teams have been administrating MDMA to healthy human volunteers in clinical trials with the approval of sanitary authorities and ethical comitees of clinical trials. <br />The question of MDMA neurotoxicity is one of the most controversial and complex. First of all, we should define what we understand for &quot;neurotoxicity&quot;, because it is not clear that some of the changes observed mean a real toxic effect. For example, we can exactly measure the degree of liver toxicity caused by alcohol by blood tests, ecography, even biopsy. These tests have diagnostic and pronostic value and are universally admitted in this sense.<br />But, with MDMA, we still don´t know if changes in density neurorreceptors and images on PET or SPECT are indicative of neurotoxicity, and what are the clinical implications. Some studies (but not all) have found differences in memory in heavy MDMA users. Some studies (but not all) have shown that these deficit recover after some months-years of abstinence. What it is clear that these effects appear only in heavy-long term MDMA users and it is very difficult to know the exact role of MDMA, as there are many factors (lifestyle, use of other drugs...) that can mislead results.<br />&nbsp;What is clear is that moderate use of MDMA (in dose and frequency) has not been linked to neurotoxic changes. The exact impact in heavy users is, as far as I know, impossible to determinate. Is there a safe frequency? Unfortunately the scientific investigations are not oriented to analyze this, but to scare people about MDMA use. There are no data of MDMA neurotoxicity in human ocassional use. No use of MDMA means risk zero. In my opinion, use of “a few times a year” in moderate doses and safe environments means an acceptable risk. <br />

For some people, in some situations, with some substances...sometimes this can be difficult. It someone thinks that his pattern of use is inadequate, and feels unable to stop it,&nbsp; maybe it is the moment to look for help. It is not a question of the concrete substance (you are talking about cannabis, but it is the same for any other drug), but also the person and the way he/she uses the drug.<br />Depending on the concrete case, sometimes is necessary pharmacological help. But it is not a question of substitute an illegal drug for a prescription drug (with this, we create another addiction), but to use it wisely during a limited time, with agreement of the patient. The concrete drug depends on the concrete situation

In your question, &quot;permanent effects&quot; and &quot;risks&quot; are not defined (physical?, psychological?, social?, all of them?. People use to think that risks of drugs depend only on the substance (meth in this case), but risks depend also on&nbsp; individual who uses it (age, sex, state of health, motivations for use, previous experience with drugs, psychological and social stete...) and the context of use. To valorate the specific risks of a drug we need always to consider this data, and this valoration is aproximative and not an exact, mathematic law.<br /><br />I think that using a high addictive drug (meth) in a high addictive way of use (smoked) will probably lead to tolerance in a few weeks. At least I think this is the most obvious and probable consequence. I´m not saying you will irremediably become an addict, but it seems the most obvious risk. In a physical perspective, it is unlikely that occasional use of meth will lead to severe health conditions, but if it happens, consequences would be serious. <br /><br />

There&#039;s a huge amount of research still to be done, but each different strain of cannabis has unique effects of concentrations of varying cannabinoids that really does make it a medicine that can be tailored to the individuals needs. <br /><br />And the cancer shit I think we&#039;ve all heard, post some evidence that supports the claim there&#039;s cancer-causing effects from smoking cannabis other than the obvious carcinogens of inhaling any plant material. Not arguing there it&#039;s clearly unhealthy in that aspect, but that&#039;s just one of many routes of administration.

Drugs actually shift the balance, creating an imbalance. That imbalance is oftentimes what people experience as the &quot;high.&quot; The brain, in this case, recognizes this and starts to lower sensitivity to this intruder chemical causing an imbalance so that the body and the brain can function at &quot;normal&quot; levels once again. <br /><br />That was the short and easy explanation lol

Scientific investigation are oriented to prescription drugs containing THC or THC/CBD, but it is a base for people who decide to automedicate themselves with cannabis plant.<br /><br />So I don´t agree with the phrase &quot; Of course smoking cannabis is not medically valid, it is just a sham to get weed legalize&quot;. It is true that smoking is not a good way of administration, but these problems can be avoided using an approved vaporizator. Cannabis is not a medicine for everyone, as it has psychoactive effects that many persons can&nbsp; consider as negative . It is not also a panacea, as sometimes is shown. But can releive some symptoms in many patients.

				I&#039;ve been mixing around with a few different psychedelics, mainly DXM, LSD and 25I-nbome over the past couple of weeks and it&#039;s got to the point that last night when I took 2 150ug LSD tabs, I did not experience a single notable visual or auditory change, but it did feel nearly identical to a moderate dose of ecstasy.<br /><br />I was wondering how much of a break should be taken between trips to ensure that you&#039;re getting the full effect of the drug? And is there anything I can do to help this process go faster?<br /><br />Also, how long should one stay off LSD/25I before a drug test? (blood + urine)

If someone lifts a heavy weight everyday, the body will adapt growing muscles, for example.<br /><br />In pharmacology, both mechanisms you point are involved on tolerance, depending on specific drug:<br />&quot;The body gets usea to cleaning the drug&quot; means that liver creates more enzymes to break some drugs (for example this is the mechanism involved in tolerance to alcohol).This is technically called &quot;pharmacocynetic tolerance&quot;.&nbsp; <br />&quot;The brain gets used to effects&quot; means that neurorreceptors in brain are less expressed (diminish in number) or less sensitive (the same stimulus causes less neurotransmissor release) when drug use is more frequent. This is called &quot;pharmacodynamic tolerance&quot; and is involved, for example, in amphetamines or opiates tolerance.<br />Usually, tolerance is a mix of both mechanisms in different proportions.

				not sure if you have background with knowledge about anabolics, but here goes nothin.<br /><br />what is your opinion on adequate levels of testosterone in a healthy male in his early 20s?&nbsp; I have had a few tests done by my GP and by an endocrinologist. My total test is virtually 0 mg/dL during the day, and around 350 mg/dL when being tested around 8 in the morning. Ive been working out for over 3 years and cant get any bigger with a solid diet. Im not sure if i should just start cycling juice to get bigger or if I should actually be seeking testosterone replacement therapy from a different doctor. But I have read a lot stating that TRT will cause impotency, and cycling usually does not cause impotency BUT has the potential to cause it.&nbsp; So I guess what I am asking is whether or not you think I should consider seeking out a different doctor for TRT or if I would be better off just cycling test and other juice. And also I am curious to just hear your opinion in regards to health in general about cycling anabolics, progesterones, DHTs, other performance enhancers, etc. <br /><br />also:<br />+100 to a doctor that isnt a douchebag.<br /><br />plz respond.

				Hey doctor, sorry to bother if so, i didnt read all the pages so sorry if this as been asked before. Ive made another topic where ive been asking for &quot;natural&quot; remedies for cancer, ive got a friend who has been thrugh a surgery of colo-rectal cancer, then he went to chimio and now after 1 month cancer came back. I was about to give him ganoderma lucidum (reishi, lingh zhi), DCA, and rick&#039;s oil made from myself, what do u think about this? And i guess most important, he&#039;s doing some alcalyne diet, no sugar, no acids, something else to help? I&#039;ll apreciate your point of view on this subject.

				Abstract: Writer wondering if he can smoke weed with the good Doctor&#039;s permission.&nbsp; Looking for loopholes in the health care system.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, it must be exhausting for Carmen to run all the time, exactly how I felt about football fifty years ago.&nbsp; How could anyone run so dynamically for those long durations and not be superhuman?&nbsp; Now I understand how, with proper training, nearly anyone can enjoy the game.&nbsp; &nbsp;One reported danger for the advanced footballer is the concussive effect of headers.&nbsp; Many sports pose a potential danger to the developing brain.&nbsp; Brain research always seems to focus on youth players and not how the brain reacts to trauma after it is fully developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;Along these lines, what is your view of persons under 25 using cannabis?&nbsp; &nbsp;For years I preached to my two, youngest 19, kids to avoid pot until they reached the age of 25 or later.&nbsp; My readings indicate the brain is developing and continues to do so until 25, by using cannabis we may compromise this stage.&nbsp; There was a recent long-term longitudinal study concluding there are significant IQ reductions with certain patterns of use.&nbsp; A similar sort of study indicated potential trauma for young people overindulging in alcohol as I recall.&nbsp; My question then is, do you think younger people should be more cautious than older folks need to be when deciding how to pleasure themselves (pun intended, masturbate) using pot or alcohol?&nbsp; Do you think the older brain has a built-in protection against the potential damage simply because the older brain is less active may have both a physical and psychological immunity built up by having years and years of plain vanilla consciousness?&nbsp; <br />

My total test is virtually 0 mg/dL during the day, and around 350 mg/dL when being tested around 8 in the morning. Ive been working out for over 3 years and cant get any bigger with a solid diet. Im not sure if i should just start cycling juice to get bigger or if I should actually be seeking testosterone replacement therapy from a different doctor. But I have read a lot stating that TRT will cause impotency, and cycling usually does not cause impotency BUT has the potential to cause it.&nbsp; So I guess what I am asking is whether or not you think I should consider seeking out a different doctor for TRT or if I would be better off just cycling test and other juice. And also I am curious to just hear your opinion in regards to health in general about cycling anabolics, progesterones, DHTs, other performance enhancers, etc. <br /><br />also:<br />+100 to a doctor that isnt a douchebag.<br /><br />plz respond.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can´t find an explanation to your variations in testosterone levels. First of all you should get an accurate diagnostic (to find if there is some physical problem and what it is the cause) and then see if you need a treatment and what are the options.<br /><br />&quot;TRT will cause impotency, and cycling usually does not cause impotency &quot; is a very big simplification, in my opinion. It all depends on causes, persons, dosages and patterns of use. Some regimes (of both TRT and cycling) can cause little or many problems, depending on dose and exact characteristics of the person.<br /><br />In my opinion, the approach of steroids cycling should be similar to any other drugs. There are patterns of use reasonabily safe and others more dangerous. The problem is that, with recreative use of drugs it is easy to find valid information focused on risk reduction and responsible use. But with steroids there is a lack of this information. You will find some people saying that any use of steroids will cause gynaecomastia, loss of hair, cancer and impotence. But you will find also people talking about cycles with megadoses of different products that can have a significant impact on health. It is difficult to find reasonable information. In general I do not reccomend steroids use under 25 years aprox. I have an article about it in my web page, although it is in Spanish and I don´t know if automatic translators will help<br />http://www.doctorcaudevilla.com/index.php/las-sustancias/92-uso-responsable-de-esteroides-anabolizantes

This is valid when we talk about adverse effects and risks of recreational drugs and also for cancer treatment.<br /><br />In my point of view, if there are not enough valid scientific investigations about one treatment, it should be considered as useless.&nbsp; Unfortunately this is the case for Ganoderma lucidum or alkaline diet and so many other &quot;natural&quot; treatments. Data from Ganoderma lucidom come from in vitro test in laboratory conditions and the effects on human treatment of cancer are not proved. And there are no data in humans showing efficace of alkaline diet.<br /><br />I don´t think these treatments should be dismissed, if they are used as complementary treatments and the patient continues to use conventional options. It is very important to be careful and sensitive offering hope to people suffering from incurable or difficult to cure diseases. If someone feels better using non-toxic alternative therapies while continuing to use standard treatments, the complementary therapy can&#039;t hurt and may give hope to the patient.<br /><br />Rick Simpson´s oil is particularly annoying for me (right, this is more a personal than professional point of view). It is a mixture of conspirative theories, data out of context, pharmacological incongruences suggesting a global conspiration aganist cannabis therapeutic use. He says that cannabis cures cancer, suggesting that conventional treatments are toxic. There is absolutly no data to suspect that it will work. <br /><br />Of course we still can be critical with conventional medicine and its often times over-technical and dehumanized approach.. And pharmaceutical industry is not an innocent one. But that does not mean that there is a global conspiracy about cannabis and, I repeat, there is nothing to think that his method can work. As I work offering advice to people who use therapeutic cannabis (for nausea in chemotherapy, neurological diseases or neuropathic pain) I feel myself authorized that all the story is a fraud.

				I am curious about drug testing and ways to naturally pass a urine analysis dont in a lab that will be detailed and looking for specific usage.&nbsp; Obviously, being clean is the best option.<br /><br />However, lets say a person takes the test in the morning one day and last used the night before that.&nbsp; For example, test is Monday and person last took some pain pills on Saturday night and was using daily but not excessively before that.<br /><br />The lab will be testing for flush kits and the like.&nbsp; So, is there a way to flush out the metabolites and other markers for the use of opiates in that short of a time frame?&nbsp; I already drink a lot of water, take a Vitamin B Complex daily, as well as creatine.<br /><br />Any suggestions you have would be great?

Parents always told me that you&#039;re going to experiment in high school and college, just use your brain and do not be afraid to call us if something bad happens. From my experience, the parents that sheltered their kids from it always had the children most likely to try out this forbidden thing they weren&#039;t even supposed to know about.<br /><br />Again, it&#039;s all subjective but if the children are level headed, they will understand.

				Very subjective answer. <br /><br />It all depends on the extent of the damage to the veins themselves as well as the location of the tracks. Healing depends on tons of different factors from how often the site reused, the type of dope or cut that was in the product, and even stuff like basic genetics. <br /><br />I would think a dermatologist could give you at least some options despite the embarrassment.

				I would like to know just exactly how caustic/damaging the insufflation of adderall/amphetamine is (no cocaine, methamp, opiates, etc.). <br /><br />Clearly it&#039;s terrible and should not be used to put drugs into your body, but unfortunately I have discovered &amp; chase the euphoria associated with it. <br /><br />Specifically I am wondering what exactly is this &#039;caustic&#039; action that takes place with continued use. Does one&#039;s nasal cavity start to literally disintegrate or deteriorate? Are there any breathing problems as a result (excluding the obvious effect on sense of smell)? At what point (like any physical signs) should you know you need to be done for good?<br /><br />Also: random myth I would like debunked because I hope you have experience with adderall/stims being an MD :) Is it true that the powder from crushed adderall pills (either IR or XR) has some wax that clogs one&#039;s nose making in ineffective? Based on personal experience I don&#039;t feel like it does, but my friend swears by it

Nausea from chemotherapy, neuropathic pain, symptoms of multiple sclerosis and wasting syndrome of HIV are the most important applications for cannabinoids. And, as any other drug, they can have interactions, contraindications and not be adequate for everyone. Sometimes therapeutic cannabis is shown as a panacea for all diseases, I don´t think that is true.

				DoctorX: Thanks so much for offering your time and knowledge here. <br /><br />I am currently rather concerned after an experience I have had and hoping maybe you could offer some insight:<br /><br />Last tuesday and wednesday I did some pretty pure coke I bought from here on SR. Only 1 gram total for both days. I also had on hand, about 70-80 mgs of valium to help with the comedown and increased heartrate/nervousness. Besides having the valium on hand, having to do with history before taking the coke, I have also been taking 10 mg lexapro as well as 250mg Rhodiola Rosea 2x day for 2 years. Lexapro is an SSRI and rhodiola seems to be a dopamine/serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well (also read it could be a slight MAOI). But overall rhodiola has a very safe track record.<br /><br />So on the 2 days I did the 1 gram coke, I had taken my regular dosages of 10 mg lexapro and 500 mg rhodiola. Alongside those, I also ended up taking all of my valium (maybe 80-90mgs) as I hate the jitteryness of coke (do it for the euphoria) and I hate the comedown. <br /><br />The following days, starting thursday, up until now, I just feel so very very down, unable to feel back to my normal self and really unable to feel any sort of happiness. Just an overall feeling of shit basically. Like there was some overload of dopamine or serotonin maybe and some possible damage to synapses in my brain that are just not regenerating. I understand 1-2 days of rehab time is normal, but it is going on 4 days now and I still feel like shit. I have never felt like this after doing coke before in my life (but had not been on the lexapro/rhodiola combo) and I am feeling very very concerned that some kind of permanent damage might have taken place? Something to do with dopamine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors being maxed or damaged? OR could it just be I am still detoxing from all that valium? (4 days doesnt make sense though...) <br /><br />Do you think my brain could regenerate from this? Any ideas on what is going on? Should I stop taking the lexapro and rhodiola for a couple days to try and initiate a reset of my brain chemistry?<br /><br />Any feedback is massively appreciated.<br />

				bodizzle,<br /><br />Cocaine, as far as I know doesn&#039;t act very strongly on seratonin like it does dopamine. The feelings you&#039;re describing sound fairly standard from a weekend of some amphetamines and partying or what not. Now I don&#039;t know a whole lot about Rhodiola but I&#039;ve read it has shown to help fatigue and have similar mechanism as MAOIs. Not only that but MAOIs react with virtually EVERYTHING, especially amphetamines. <br /><br />I would personally drop the herbal shit you take just for a week or two but it sounds to me that your body is just extremely drained from a good amphetamine run.<br /><br />The feeling of worthlessness, guilt and general down feeling after a weekend partying with good coke or meth is normal. I&#039;ve felt like shit up to a week before after a good party hard weekend. Your brain is just taxed right now with depleted dopamine.<br /><br />Stick with the valium to keep your anxiety down and help you sleep just ease up on the amount. Only take enough to relieve your anxiety. Drink tons of water and eat some good meals. You&#039;ll feel better in a couple days. <br /><br />I did some MDMA while on celexa a few years ago and had panic attacks and extreme anxiety for a couple days. Finally I went to the ER thinking that I may have Seratonin Syndrome. He laughed and said, &quot;stop reading your medical books unless you have a exam, you&#039;re only scaring yourself worse.&quot; Fed me some valium and I was fine after that.

There are available test for some drugs (opiates, benzodiacepines, amphetamines, LSD, cannabis, cocaine...) but other drugs (GHB, ketamine, some legal highs...) are very difficult to detect in routine lab tests. <br />Each test has his own specificity and sensibility, characteristics that indicate the accuracy of the test to detect a specific drug during a period of time. Most routine test detect drugs between 1 hour after last use until 3-4 days, depending on the drug and the own test. A notable exception is cannabis: most test detect 1 week after ocasional use and 1-3 months in regular users.<br />The body has its own speed to eliminate drugs. This process does not affect by taking water, sweating, making exercise or taking supplements. All these measures are useless. It is not a good idea to dilute or adulterate the urine, the tests are designed to detect this too.

Obviously, they are not sold as &quot;drugs&quot;.They are offered as bath salts, aromas or fertilizers to avoid legal problems, but users know that they have psychoactive properties.<br /><br />Originally, MDPV (3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone) was the first psychoactive detected. The fact that MDPV is still legal in some countries does not mean that it is safe or better than other illegal drugs. MDPV is an uncommon stimulant with a short history of human use. It is known for its tendency to cause compulsive redosing and some users report sexual arousal as an effect. <br /><br />Anyway, in laboratory analysis of &quot;bath salts&quot; it is common to find a mixture of different psychoactives. Other cathinone derivatives, ephedrine,&nbsp; naphthylpyrovalerones... are commonly found in different samples. Even the same commercial name has different components during time.<br /><br />So, it is very difficult to know the possible health problems of these substances, as there is a lack of investigation data in human for most of them. From a risk reduction perspective, &quot;classical&quot; drugs are much less risky than these substances, or at least risks can be predicted more easily

I usually answer questions one by one, but I understand you have some urgency. I have read your story. It is difficult to give advice only by Internet, without personal communication. But, in your case, I suspect what is happening can be a &quot;normal&quot; effect after high doses of cocaine. I don´t know if you are a frequent user or if you have tolerance to the substance, but a gram of cocaine can cause your symptoms. Depressive episodes are common after a binge of coke. They are related to monoamine deplection, but they are normally reversible along time.<br />I would not reccomend to abandomn Lexapro, as it can help to mitigate symptoms. I have doubts on Rhodolia, as there is little information available about its mechanism of action. But, probably, symptoms will improve in following days. It is important that you sleep well (as long as you need) during these days and try not to be stressed or make important decissions. I think you will improve during following days, if it is not the case I reccomend for proffesional evaluation

				Thank you doctorx.<br /><br />Yeah, what concerns me is that in the past (4-5 years ago) I had done coke while on lexapro and didnt get these effects...<br /><br />The difference with this time is that the coke was most defnitely more pure and I am taking rhodiola as well.. The reason I mentioned getting off the lexapro temporarily is I read a wiki answers topic on this, and the guy said he tried coke w/ lexapro once (did more coke than me though) but said the following days when he continued with his lexapro dosage he experienced a reverse effect where he felt the lexapro was now doing opposite of what its intention was.

From my experience, the parents that sheltered their kids from it always had the children most likely to try out this forbidden thing they weren&#039;t even supposed to know about.<br /><br />Again, it&#039;s all subjective but if the children are level headed, they will understand.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />There are some commentaries before on this subject. I´m not an expert on education or drugs politics, so I think my opinion in this is irrelevant. But I think some of the moral prejudices with sex that existed in society some decades ago have changed to drugs. Drugs and drug users are scapegoats of all society problems. This prejudices can only be manteined through ignorance. There is a big ignorance and prejudices against drugs even between doctors and scientist. If we don´t educate people (and that includes young and adolescents) with reliable information there will always be more problems.

So it is, theoretically, an &quot;enhanced&quot; version of modafinil, and it has been studied with the same indications than this drug: sleep disorders, depression, schizophrenia and jet-lag. Only in sleep disorderes clinically diagnosed has shown efficacy, studies on schizophrenia have been dismissed and it didn´t get the FDA authorization for jet lag<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20957846<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20530317<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19880686<br />Anyway, it can have the same problems related to all stimulant drugs: tachycardia, restlessness,&nbsp; headache, and even psychotic problems at high doses<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775049<br />My personal opinion on most of this enantiomer drugs is that they are an easy way to get a new drug far much expensive than the original one, and, in most cases, there are not significant differences from the original. There are exceptions (escitalopram is different from citalopram, for example), but in most cases they are an easy way to improve pharmacological industry benefits.<br />I think the rest of your questions are out of the thread, but yes, I think I earn less money than a plastic surgeon in the US.

Of course illegal drugs have not sanitary controls and this is a problem and, depending on the drug purity and specific drug, there can be much or less problems. But washing hands, cleaning the site with alcohol after and before injection, using steril and proper material (clean needles and syringes, gloves...) and taking care of possible wounds with specific ointments or creams are the best way to avoid problems.

The degree is between little imperceptible wounds to massive destruction of bones and structure of nasal cavity. There are different factors to this: characteristics of the substance, purity, technique and frecuency of use... The presence of continuous nasals congestion, bad odour or green mucus or bleeding can indicate that there is a problem and use should be stopped or diminished.<br />There are some tips to reduce this risks or avoid it:<br />1) To crush very well the substance before using it<br />2) Using a clean surface<br />3) To use both nostrils to snort, alternating <br />4) Using clean material. Don´t use a bill to snort, use better a drinking snort or a clean paper. Several studies have shown a higher rate of Hepatitis C Virus in intranasal cocaine users.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15132748<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22740714<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17052278<br />It is unclear if sharing material to snort (straws) can be a route of infection, but you should use personal material to introduce in your nose and not sharing it, by general hygiene reasons.<br />Most prescription drugs susceptible to be abused are formulated in a way to avoid intranasal or intravenous use

They are two different substances and risks are probably different. To explain well the question I will start talking about ketamine. Ketamine is a well known drug, widely used in therapy during 50 years. Recreative use of ketamine has, more or less, 15-20 years. In the last 5 years there have been a lot of scientific reports talking about bladder and urinary problems in ketamine users. It was an unknown problem until 2005 (more or less), and has been detected after 15-20 years of recreative, intranasal use. In general, it only affects to intensive users.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21155941<br />PCP was used in medicine from 1920 to 1950 and it was finished then because of its adverse side effects, such as hallucinations, mania, delirium, and disorientation. In fact ketamine has its substitute, because it has less adverse effects. PCP has been linked to neurotoxicity in animals, but it is not probably extrapolable to humans.<br />Methoxetamine is a very new substance. We don´t know anything about its pharmacological properties and toxicity in humans, although there are reports of problems linked to its use:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23111916<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22578175<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22205276<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349353<br />Considering overall risks and benefits, probably ketamine is the safest, most pleasurable and less risky of all dissociatives, although it has it own problems associated indeed.

In your case, it also seems dangerous, because of the high doses used. LSD is not physically dangerous, but doses over 500 micrograms will have no more desired effects and are a waste of substance. Doses over 250-300 mg of MDMA increase adverse effects and risks of toxicity. The fact you have some tolerance does not mean that there are less risks: tolerance to pleasurable effects is generally faster to tolerance to, for example, cardiovascular effects. It happens the same witk K.<br />The only way I know is to wait several weeks and use lower doses of substances. I think this is not too much for advice, but it is the only thing I can suggest.

Even some studies on cocaine (that is a highly addictive drug) suggest that around 10-15% of persons who have tried once in their lives will have a dependence problem. <br />Strictly, a drug dependence problem must fit some criteria. There are some desadaptative patterns of use that can´t be classified as &quot;dependence&quot;, although this is a technical detail that maybe is not important. It is true that male have more abuse/dependence problem than women, although for some substances (prescription benzodiacepines for example) rates are inverse.<br />http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/federalcourts/pps/fedprob/2006-09/accountability_table1.html<br />The important thing, in my opinion, is that this &quot;10% risk&quot; is not a lottery. It depends on many factors: substance, route of administration, pattern of use and, very important, social, personal and psychological factors difficult to measure.What I mean is that the person behavior and his relation with the substance (motivations, objectives, pattern of use...) will make easier or more difficult that a dependence problem appears.<br />The cardiovascular benefits of low doses of alcohol are well stablished.<br />http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d671<br />Only red wine has shown this benefit, but in my opinion it is not a reason for start drinking. As I said, dependence is caused by many factors, I think the main motivation for drink low doses of wine should be pleasure, not a cardiovascular protective effect. I don´t think this effect should promote dependence, although it should be well explained and sometimes is not.<br />And I don´t see cannabis in the same way. There are no clear benefits for health of using low doses of cannabis daily . Cannabis can be useful for some diseases but has not health benefits for general population. OK... for some people it is relaxant, improves creativity or simply, they like or enjoy it: this is health too. But I don´t think it can be compared to the alcohol issue.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hi DoctorX<br /><br />I was guided to ask my question from you:<br /><br />I have one post in newbie section where i tell about myself and my health condition(ptsd).<br />However im asking here is there any drug that doesn&#039;t interfere with my memory and emotions much except it would soothe fear and anxiety(euphoria type feeling could of course push me at bit better forward)? This is for therapeutic purposes.<br /><br />I took MDMA only little while ago(couple days ago) and felt bit that high cortisol production(i suspect) kinda interfered any kind of remembering and feeling. I only felt like i want to rest and were really unable to think anything. It weren&#039;t bad, but it weren&#039;t something that i looked for either.<br /><br />So do you know anything that could help?<br /><br />Regards,<br />blackroses

Now after 2 months i&#039;m unable to reach my positive<br />emotions properly(mildly i can since before breakdown i managed to detach myself aka i have very positive feelings from time before bd but they are shut inside me) since there is fear barrier between me and my emotions.<br />My life is practically frozen because of this. Doctors have suggested me to talk to psychologist, without even understanding my condition. Other have suggested me ssri, but after looking what it may cause, i just couldn&#039;t. After making research i find out about marijuana use in Ptsd as well as the MDMA. Since i do feel my situation is a bit unusual because of mild presence on positive feelings and yet i feel i need some med to help me and my brain to recover i experience that numbing medication is wrong(cant really tell is it good for anyone). Naturally drugs like marijuana and MDMA are illegal<br />in my country and doctors are unable to prescript either as well, so after searching i end up here.<br />First of all i would like to hear opinions about my situation and suggestions what i should do. How should i use these drugs? Can i use both &quot;same time&quot;(Maybe use marijuana couple days a week and MDMA once later on week)? I need to know how much i can take without getting addiction and then again without damaging my brain more. I would be also happy to hear from other people who had/ have Ptsd or mental illness have they gotten help from any drug(these or other). Most important thing for me would be that that huge fear/anxiety barrier would low down and i would be able to get contact to my other feelings so that i can relax and process my break down properly with them.<br />I dont hope to become regular user :P ,but my situation needs action and i want to help myself(since doctors are unable). I hope to get quick answers<br />because i want to get &quot;my medication&quot; on before i loose my reach to those positive feelings and maybe fall into depression.

These measures have no known health benefits other than the possible placebo effect. Moderation on doses and frequencies (and abstinence in the case of liver diseases as viral, autoinmune or drug-induced hepatitis) are the most important and effective ways to avoid or minimize harm.<br />

				Hi Doctor,<br /><br />On the subject of cocaine binges -- using .75grams of decent cocaine (presumably no active cuts) 5 out of 7 days a week for a couple months straight, usually over the course of 6 hours or so.&nbsp; Healthy diet -- lots of fruits and veggies, immunity &amp; respiratory supplements (various mushroom extracts, active), 100-200 ue Vitamin E daily, along with ending each session with 7-10mg diazepam and a good saline wash.&nbsp; &nbsp;Daily GABA Calm supplements (Magnesium 5 mg, gamma-aminobutyric acid 125 mg, Glycine 50 mg, N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine 25 mg, Taurine 20 mg). Also exercising 45-60 minutes in the mornings 4 days a week.&nbsp; Male age between 26-32, generally healthy otherwise, don&#039;t smoke or drink.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel amazing but I definitely don&#039;t feel like a wreck either.&nbsp; &nbsp;Though my eyes have looked better -- I am definitely getting some bruising near &amp; below my eyes next to the top of my nose.&nbsp; Anything I can do to help with that?&nbsp; And am I in serious trouble (aside from getting an addiction under control)?&nbsp; I have heard stories of people using cocaine for years.&nbsp; I know not everyone is different, just trying to get an honest assessment of how dangerous this might be.&nbsp; Be honest please :)&nbsp; Many blessings to you.

I had beed diagnosed by both a neurologist and a pychiatrist (however that&#039;s properly spelled) with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder with Disphoria (a low to mid level) depression. I was prescribed a few SSRI&#039;s (not simultaneously, we worked on several &#039;til We found one that worked well. Celexa, Effexor and finally Lexapro were the SSRI&#039;s, with Lexapro working quite well with no side effects at all (for me). I also suffered from panic attacks (severe ones) for which I was prescribed Xanax. These all worked extremely well for me (note: as someone stated a few pp up everyone is different - Zoloft was absolutely horrible for me, for example). I took these (legitimately under a doctor&#039;s care) for approx 6-9 years with excellent results - I&#039;m rather shy, but after a few years I was entertaining the idea of joining a nudist resort - I didn&#039;t, but gave considerable thought to it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It should be noted that Xanax is, as previously stated, bext for short term anxiety issues (panic attacks, for which it works very, very well), but is is very addictive and the withdraws (if not tapered down gradually) can (and did with me) cause Grand Mal siezures - very bad while driving or the like, obviously. Also, the SSRI&#039;s, if that is the route you would take, are a multi-year therapy, perhaps permanently - this it best decided by a medical doctor.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is help available for this, very effective help, so don&#039;t fret too much nor fall into depression - lots of people have these issues, and the pharamsuticals (sp) are getting quite sophisticated.

				You will never find a drug that replaces the human spirit.&nbsp; Cry with fear, that&#039;s what it&#039;s all about.&nbsp; Just cry full stop.&nbsp; Laughing also activates the same neural pathways too so seriously, a good hearty laugh helps too, with friends especially.<br /><br />Meth has helped me for the dopamine reward combined with exercise, boy it sure helps &#039;behavioural modification&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about MDMA as I don&#039;t think I need any more seratonin.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually cautious about boosting seratonin and think dopamine is the key and then use indirect / other methods to boost seratonin - like lifestyle overall and a healthy social life.<br /><br />Dopamine helps focus, and in small modest amounts meth seems to work really well despite all concerns and suggestions I should try something else, not that I have much if any experience with anything else so I wouldn&#039;t really know.<br /><br />I just need to dive in and do stuff, not run around hugging people.&nbsp; An active social / community / physical lifestyle seems to take care of that bit.&nbsp; Was once depressed..&nbsp; Community involvement and making lots of friends cured that pretty quickly.<br /><br />Be careful of replacing the basic human need for ongoing social connection in a &#039;village&#039; with drugs.<br /><br />That&#039;s why (ironically) I think I prefer meth.&nbsp; It just helps me improve my lifestyle, lose weight, focus etc but leaves the rest of the &#039;personal development&#039; to me.<br /><br />Unorthodox I know, perhaps.&nbsp; But... who knows.

Also exercising 45-60 minutes in the mornings 4 days a week.&nbsp; Male age between 26-32, generally healthy otherwise, don&#039;t smoke or drink.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel amazing but I definitely don&#039;t feel like a wreck either.&nbsp; &nbsp;Though my eyes have looked better -- I am definitely getting some bruising near &amp; below my eyes next to the top of my nose.&nbsp; Anything I can do to help with that?&nbsp; And am I in serious trouble (aside from getting an addiction under control)?&nbsp; I have heard stories of people using cocaine for years.&nbsp; I know not everyone is different, just trying to get an honest assessment of how dangerous this might be.&nbsp; Be honest please :)&nbsp; Many blessings to you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />With some drugs it is easy to calculate or estimate the risks of a concrete pattern of usage. There are epidemiological studies about safe dosage of alcohol, for example. Other drugs (like GHB or methamphetamine) have been used as prescription drug and so we know adverse effects or toxicity. But, as far as I know, there are no studies about risks of daily or very frequent intranasal dosage cocaine and its relation with dosage.<br />So, my &quot;honest&quot; (as you request) opinion is not based in scientific studies, but in my experience and general knowledge. In general, frequent use of drugs is more risky than ocassional, recreative use. This is obvious, but I think this rise of risks is greater for stimulants than for other drugs like, for example cannabis. <br /><br />I think daily or almost daily use of such a dose of cocaine may be harmful at medium or long term.&nbsp; Cocaine has robust cardiovascular effects and frequent use can cause problems such as hypertension. Psychologically there can be also some problems: frequent users of cocaine are prone to anxiety, depressive or paranoid reactions. Sometimes these conditions are not serious but there are subtle personality alterations. The risk of dependence also exists and may be increased if you are using another addictive drug at the same time (diazepam). This mixture (benzos after cocaine) can be useful used occasionally but I don´t think it is a good idea an an habit. It is important that you consider yourself ( I don´t know if this expression is correct in English...&quot;consider yourself&quot;, &quot;think about...&quot;) about the motivations, objectives and feel of self-contol of your cocaine use.<br /><br />We talked about safe intranasal drug use some days ago:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1328056#msg1328056<br />

I had beed diagnosed by both a neurologist and a pychiatrist (however that&#039;s properly spelled) with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder with Disphoria (a low to mid level) depression. I was prescribed a few SSRI&#039;s (not simultaneously, we worked on several &#039;til We found one that worked well. Celexa, Effexor and finally Lexapro were the SSRI&#039;s, with Lexapro working quite well with no side effects at all (for me). I also suffered from panic attacks (severe ones) for which I was prescribed Xanax. These all worked extremely well for me (note: as someone stated a few pp up everyone is different - Zoloft was absolutely horrible for me, for example). I took these (legitimately under a doctor&#039;s care) for approx 6-9 years with excellent results - I&#039;m rather shy, but after a few years I was entertaining the idea of joining a nudist resort - I didn&#039;t, but gave considerable thought to it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It should be noted that Xanax is, as previously stated, bext for short term anxiety issues (panic attacks, for which it works very, very well), but is is very addictive and the withdraws (if not tapered down gradually) can (and did with me) cause Grand Mal siezures - very bad while driving or the like, obviously. Also, the SSRI&#039;s, if that is the route you would take, are a multi-year therapy, perhaps permanently - this it best decided by a medical doctor.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is help available for this, very effective help, so don&#039;t fret too much nor fall into depression - lots of people have these issues, and the pharamsuticals (sp) are getting quite sophisticated.

While this may be not DoctorX&#039;s specialty I wonder if he could comment on treating nicotine addiction as such.&nbsp; Whatever that means, {as such}, I mean.&nbsp; <br /><br />One reason not to take anti-depressants is to avoid going about sans clothes.&nbsp; Since occasionally I would like to go to a nudist colony, I&#039;m afraid if I take those new fangled drugs I will find the impulse to disrobe so powerful and extraordinary that I would find it impossible to keep my clothes buttoned up.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">But it is very difficult (I would say almost impossible) that one can do that by oneself without a good professional psychologist or psychiatrist specifically trained and&nbsp; personally experienced on MDMA.

Nicotine replacement therapy imitates the heroin/methadone model, changing the way of administration of nicotine from a high-addictive one (smoked) to a less adictive one: chewing gums, patchs, bucal or intranasal sprays. The other two approved prescrition drugs for this purpose are bupropion (a dopamine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) and varenicline (a nicotinic receptor partial agonist). Each one of these drugs have their own benefits and disadvantages and are more o less suitable depending on the situation.<br /><br />Regarding MDMA therapy it is very importat that the therapist has some experience with the drug. This is one of the particular characteristics of therapeutic use of psychedelics. You don´t need to have cancer or diabetes to be a good doctor in cancer or diabetes. But this practical knowledge is essential for psychedelic therapy.I think the unique characteristics of MDMA experience can be useful for PTSD, but I don´t think the same for behaviour modification. In this case I don´t think MDMA could work

				I don´t agree with the idea that it should be very difficult to find a therapist with practical experience with MDMA. The history of MDMA is closely vinculated to psychiatry.MDMA first use was therapeutic, and during the 70s-early 80s, at least in United States, thousands of professional ( medicine, psychology, psychiatry) learnt and experimented with patients.<br /><br />&quot; When Shulgin had him try MDMA in 1977, Zeff was so impressed that he came out of retirement to proselytize for it. Ann Shulgin remembers a speaker at Zeff&#039;s memorial service saying that Zeff had introduced the drug to &#039;&#039;about 4,000&#039;&#039; therapists. &quot; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html<br /><br />Most of these professional remain &quot;in the closet&quot; as nobody wants to be related with a forbidden drug. There are a few professional that administer MDMA to patients in therapeutic settings, but they remain underground and information is only available by personal , selected contacts because of the severe legal problems thwy would have to face if their activity is illegal.<br /><br />I think this personal experience is fundamental. Nobody can learn to drive or skiing without a professor who knows the subject. With psychedelics it is possible that oneself experiments &quot;illuminative&quot; or trascendental experiences that mean deep changes without other persons. But these experiences can´t be provoked or searched, they just happen sometimes. Therapeutic use of psychedelics imply some kind of guide or help by a person with enough knowledge, both theoretical and practical<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1376125#msg1376125">Quote from: findingcure on July 25, 2013, 06:24 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1371437#msg1371437">Quote from: cleansober on July 24, 2013, 11:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But it is very difficult (I would say almost impossible) that one can do that by oneself without a good professional psychologist or psychiatrist specifically trained and&nbsp; personally experienced on MDMA.

				A Drug Testing Service is the best (and only) way to avoid PMA and other adulterants. The simplest techniques use reactives (Marquis, Mecke, Mandelin, Robadope...) to detect the presence or absence of a determinated substance or family of substances. They have limitations. For example, a sample with pure MDMA and other sample with MDMA+other substances will test both positives. They don´t difference similar substances (MDA and MDMA have the same reaction). There can be some false positives ( some opiates give a positive reaction to Marquis test). They only offer aproximate qualitative information, never quantitative). On the other hand, they are easy to use and can be easily purchased through Internet.<br /><br />A Thin Layer Cromatography has a medium difficulty (it needs an equipment and training), but it separates different substances in a sample and gives more information about its composition. Other techniques more sofisticated (Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-ultraviolet) give accurate information about the exact composition of almost every drug, but they are expensive and need using complex equipment.<br /><br />There are a few countries in the world that allow Drug Testing Service as preventive measures related with drugs. My country, Spain, is one of them although these services are poorly financed and bad considered by many politics and drug experts. You know, the kind of people that say that Drug Testing Services promote the use of drugs, that are the same who thinks that using condoms causes sexual promiscuity, or that fire extinguishers promote fire.

Think about the question &quot;How much is too much alcohol to ingest in one setting? &quot;. For some people 2-3 drinks of whisky should be too much, other people would think that one bottle, there are even people that think that any quantity of alcohol is too much. Factors like age, sex, speed of administration, adulteration and personal factors&nbsp; are very important. Tolerance makes that people who use regularly a drug, can take doses that would be toxic for a non-regular user.<br />It is also important to consider what do you mean with &quot;too much&quot;...Too much for having mild adverse effects? To have an overdose? To die?.<br />In the particular case of cocaine, in general it is considered that a normal dose in a line should be 30-100mg, and it also depends&nbsp; is on the intensity of effects sought. Some people take just one dose and other will take more than 20 in a unique occasion.<br />We have exact ranks of dosage for prescription drugs but not for recreative drugs. In pharmacology, there is a parameter called &quot;LD50&quot; used to measure the toxicity of a drug. LD50 means the medium dose necessary to kill 50% of a group of experimentation animals. Knowing the LD50 for different species (rats, dogs, monkeys) and using mathematical models, it is possible to calculate the human LD50, although it is only an estimation. <br />In the case of LD50 for cocaine there are different data.&nbsp; Grinspoon and Bakalar say in their book &quot;Cocaine: A Drug and It’s Social Evolution&quot; that it is 20 mg/kg orally in dogs or 10 mg/kg subcutaneously/intravenously. LD50 for humans is calculated in the rank 1.5-2.5 grams of pure cocaine, although I insist that this parameter in only a theoretical estimation. Some people would have serious problems using less cocaine in one occasion and other (people with tolerance) could use higher doses.<br />In any case, I think 3-4 grams in one occasion is a very high dosage and can lead to problems. You should also consider that nasal surface of absorption is small, capacity of absorption is saturated and the vasoconstrictor effect of cocaine makes that, when you reach certain dosage, the rest is not absorbed and wasted. <br /><br />

				Wow doctor, thanks for taking the time out and replying to everyone&#039;s questions.Respect.<br /><br />I have a question for you regarding drug&nbsp; interactions. I am currently taking abilify,an anti-psychotic medication. I have recently thought about doing MDMA on a social basis. How will that drug interact with that particular anti-psychotic?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard it reduces the effects of MDMA at best,at worst it can make you really sick with serotonin syndrome. How likely is SS?<br /><br />Also, if you have the time to explain how abilify interacts with other drugs such as; mephedrone, ketamine and LSD, this information would be of most help. <br /><br />Thank you.

I am aware of the concept of an LD. My concern with &quot;too much&quot; was ODing specifically. I have passed out before from snorting cocaine. Not really sure what happened to be honest. I was snorting rails all night with a friend then he leaves and I obviously continue. I must have had about a gram before I purchased an 8ball. I just remember waking up on my bed, then having a very intense urge to vomit. Which I preceded to do for about 10 minutes then I was left with massive diarrhea. My body temp skyrocketed and I felt very faint. No idea how I came to end up on my bed.For some reason I completely blacked out. I had fallen and hit my head leaving a cut. The glass picture frame I was using to crank lines off of was broken on the floor with my blow every where. I am guessing that I overdosed..

				The relation between MDMA and lactation is not clear. As far as I know, there are no published studies on this particular issue.

So I think it should be prudent to take some sugar or carbohidrates, at least a few hours before the experience.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1402802#msg1402802">Quote from: Bluto on August 01, 2013, 11:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Doctor,<br /><br />I am doing a very low carb diet.

				Hello DoctorX, I am a nursing student, and i have become interested in disassociates, mxe in particular. I started with DXM, and thru my research i have discovered that many believe it to be worse than mxe, because of its&quot;dirty-ness&quot;. I have been using it and it seems to help with physical motivation, I was wondering what your opinion on the chemical is. I know it is a new chem, but if i am to continue using disassociates, is it better to stick with occasional dxm, or mxe usage? <br />I was curious if you are under the impression that is as neurotoxic as pcp, or dxm?<br />Also, i was wondering if you could go over some of the effects disassociates have on organs and organ systems?<br />I enjoy psychedelics, but i find mxe helps with my seasonal depression<br />While cannabis does help my depression it also leaves me anti social, and feeling less intelegent<br />mxe on the other hand, makes me feel social, functional, and on small doses lets me &quot;think outside of the box&quot;<br />I feel ketamine has a more addictive craving quality due to its shorter duration<br /><br />I was wondering if believed the negative effects of mxe, and disassociates in general are greater than what they allow me to be

In fact I´m not sure if I have understood your question. <br />I thinks drugs have to be used for pleasure, it must be the person who controls the substance and not the opposite. For some people, in some situations, with some substances...sometimes this can be difficult. It someone thinks that his pattern of use is inadequate, and feels unable to stop it,&nbsp; maybe it is the moment to look for help. It is not a question of the concrete substance (you are talking about cannabis, but it is the same for any other drug), but also the person and the way he/she uses the drug.<br />Depending on the concrete case, sometimes is necessary pharmacological help.

				In general snorting is the most safe of the three ways you indicate to use cocaine. The risk of dependence depends on many factors, one of them is way of administration. The fastest the substance reaches brain, dependence potential is higher. In case of highly-addictive substances like cocaine, heroin or meth, intranasal use reduces this potential, although it exist indeed. In relation with other physical and psychological problems, intranasal use is better also.<br /><br />Combustion of vegetals produce toxic substances for the lungs. This is valid for every vegetal (tobacco or cannabis). It is unclear if products of combustion from tobacco are more toxic than that from cannabis. But there is a way to avoid this problem. Using a vaporizer eliminates completely this problem. There are some models used in clinical trials that have proved to vaporize cannabis without toxic components<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16637053<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17437626<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17429350<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1408395#msg1408395">Quote from: top44 on August 03, 2013, 07:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">doctor x, i have a question sorry i did not read 29 pages, i am too lazy now<br /><br />Cocaine.

There are some studies linking use of cannabis and after development of schizophrenia, particularly in teenagers. <br />One important point in this subject is that, the fact that two things are correlated or linked does not mind that one is the cause of the other. I will try to explain with an example. I read some time ago a study saying that &quot;people who read the composition of the food&nbsp; have less problems of obesity&quot;. Probably,&nbsp; who read labels and get information about what they are eating, are more concerned about their health and have better dietary habits. But the fact of reading a label won´t keep you thinner ;)<br />This is a very important idea,and it is forgotten many times talking about drugs. In the model we explain schizophrenia actually, there is a susceptible or pre-morbid personality and there are &quot;stressing factors&quot; that trigger the disease. Known factors developing schizophrenia are divorce of parents, military service or sentimental break-up. Use of psychedelics can also trigger an schizophrenia, but only in susceptible, pre-morbid personalities. Think that use of cannabis has grown all over the world in the last 20 years and incidence of schizophrenia remains stable, around 1%.

				Doctor, thank you so much for volunteering your time and energy to the users on this site. It is quite a bonus to have access to a doctor for our questions. <br /><br />I actually quit using opiates by doing a flood dose of Iboga under clinical conditions in Mexico (where it is legal). It immediately halted my physical addiction (130mg of oxy daily) and withdrawals from it. I mean it when I say immediately. There were zero w/d symptoms after taking it, though the experience of having Iboga in my system required a lot of help for a day. It causes major ataxia and can cause vomiting, though I did not experience that. To me, it is an amazing option for those who really want to quit. <br /><br />Do you know about Iboga/Ibogaine?

				hi doc,<br /><br /><br />i am an old, longtime coke user.<br /><br />in the beginning i was injecting it for many many years, had good qualities back then, was in peru and bolivia, and, as usual in cases like this, in the end came paranoia.<br />it came slow, first a little, then getting harder, after 16 years it was so extreme that i had to stop injecting.<br /><br />i did base and crack a while, which, after some years, as well developed paranoia that can be compared to the para i have when injecting.<br /><br />today i can only snort.<br />then the para, which comes in times a little bit, can be controlled mostly.<br /><br />but when i injected now (after a break of 15 yerars i did it once shortly ago) it has not gotten better even after a 15 years beak injecting and over 10 years break in doing coke at all.<br />it is all there, as if there was no break.,<br /><br /><br />anyway, today i am just in the mode for some more coke.<br /><br />when i did this one injection shortly, it brought me to hell.<br />as the kick arrives, i feel like being thrown in a world or situation like in the movie alien 2, when they are on that planet in that building and all of a sudden the aliens start moving all around them (and they realize they are surrounded by these deadly hostile aliens and will not get out anymore).<br /><br />all i do is rush back to the wall, down on my knees or lying down on bed, and try to not move.<br />behind me (though there is no space behind me) i know and feel THEM who are attacking me any second now by stabbing knifes into my throat, into my eyes and whatever. they will do things i wont describe, they are horrible. <br />if someone i know is there with me, and i usually trust her/him, i dont trust them anymore in this moment.<br />this person may assure me : there is noone, we are all alone !<br />i dont believe it, i rather believe that person works now together with the attackers, whom I FEEL AND KNOW are on the jump and located hidden all around me.<br />depending in the amount i start trembling but not in a normal tremble way, but more in an epileptic way.<br /><br />i dont want top describe further, the horrors are much worse than i can describe here.<br />as good as it was in the beginnign, as bad it is now.<br /><br /><br /><br />my question to you :<br /><br />I WANT TO GET RID OF THIS PARANOIA !<br />i want to inject again and have those divine cocaine kicks i used to have in the early times.<br /><br />there MUST be some biochemical way to remove or block this paranoia !<br />there must be some chemical stuff that stops it, makes it not appear.<br /><br />what do you think could be done ?<br />what is the reason for this paranoia ?<br />where is it located in the brain, what happens there when this extreme paranioia comes ?<br />and why it hasnt turned less after many years of not doing coke.<br /><br /><br />i know, you probably want to tell me : <br />stop it - its not worth it,&nbsp; you kill yourself&nbsp; etc. etc pp.<br /><br />this is completely useless as i wont.<br />i am a convinced coke user, i may say it is more like a religion to me.<br /><br />i have it pretty much under control when snorting.<br />but earlier i called snorting &quot;kindergarten&quot;.<br />it doesnt give a tenth of what an injection can give you.<br /><br />as it is now, i wont inject anymore, it is simply horrible and nothing else anymore.<br /><br />but i wish i could !<br />i&#039;d love to.<br /><br /><br />if i am to die from coke - so be it.<br /><br /><br />but what can be done to remove that nerv killing paranoia and be able again to enjoy the &quot;injecting coke kicks&quot; ?<br /><br />even if it wouldnt be as good as in the beginning, but without that paranoia it would be still good.<br /><br />so : <br /><br />what is the reason for this paranoia ?<br /><br />has anyone ever tried to find out moire about this ?<br /><br />where is it located ?<br /><br />what can be done against it ?<br /><br /><br />i dont need hints like &quot;use diazepam, use lorazepam etc.<br />i do.<br /><br />but it only lowers the paranoia, it cannot remove it. not at all.<br /><br /><br />could you think of any way and anything i could try to get rid of this paranoia and <br />enjoy the blessing of cocaine injections again ?<br /><br /><br />thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Brilliant work doc :) One very simple short question: Is nightly use of GHB to aid sleep going to be causing physiological damage? Just I notice that people with narcolepsy can be prescribed it (xyrem) with two 4.5g doses a night to help them sleep at night and stay awake in the day. So it can&#039;t be that damaging, if at all, right?

				Hi Doctor,<br />I have a question about tolerance regarding Diazepam. My doctor told me that the effects are cumulative, meaning that the effect is greater each day. I always thought that the more you take a drug the less it affects you. What is your opinion?

I have been using it and it seems to help with physical motivation, I was wondering what your opinion on the chemical is.

Experience with DXM is considered by many persons as &quot;dirty&quot; although is possibly the safest and best known dissociative. Effects of ketamine are pleasurable and interesting for many people but it has its own problems :abuse and dependence potential or urinary bladder problems in frequent users. This last problem has been recognized only in the last 5 years, when use of ketamine has spread and grown and, consequently, some problems are more frequent in general population.<br />So, the after-effects or long time effects of MXE are, in this moment, unknown. It will be necessary some temporal perspective to know if it is more or less risky than K. MXE was marketed by some &quot;legal high&quot; vendors as &quot;bladder friendly&quot;, although there are no data to be sure of this. Anyway, the best way to avoid problems with dissociatives is using them&nbsp; occasionaly.

				Hey doc, I know you have expressed your concern of research chemicals, but would you still recommend against using 25I-NBOMe only once or twice a month? I research things before I put them into my body, and I haven&#039;t seen anything suggesting normal doses at such a frequency to be particularly harmful (albeit the chemical is fairly new). The doses I plan on doing will be around .5-2mg on 1mg blotters. I have used the substance once before, I took 1mg and very much enjoyed the experience. No lasting side effects at all. Thoughts?<br /><br />And thanks for using your limited time to answer our questions. It&#039;s appreciated.

				I think it would be fair from now on if the people asking the doc questions also send some coin his way. Specialist medical consultation doesn&#039;t come cheap, and I&#039;m sure s/he had to work damn hard for a long time to acquire the knowledge s/he has and is willing to share.

				Hi DoctorX<br /><br />I have a question concerning Tramadol and Ecstasy use which seems to cause a lot of confusion online. As we know, Tramadol is a complex multi-action painkiller which effects serotonin-levels in the brain, similar to how SSRI drugs work.<br /><br />Note: For the sake of this question, let&#039;s assume that &quot;Ecstasy&quot; is pure and has been verified as such (I know the risks involved with Ecstasy pills being laced with other substances, but let&#039;s assume for this question, this is pure tested crystal/powder form Ecstasy, and not pills).<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1) Is it at all dangerous to take both Tramadol and Ecstasy together? i.e. 50mg Tramadol, then 8 hours later, 130mg Ecstasy?<br /><br />2) Assuming it&#039;s not safe to take these two drugs together, what would be a reasonable &quot;wash-out&quot; period to abstain from Tramadol before using Ecstasy? (I&#039;ve seen people suggest wide ranging time periods, from 24 hours, to weeks, but generally 3 days is the recommend wash-out time period).<br /><br />3) If you did take both drugs together (by accident) and had some adverse reaction, would taking a short-acting benzo (i.e. Xanax) help in that situation and prevent or lessen the risk of seizure and/or serotonin syndrome?<br /><br />4) Is the risk higher on the Tramadol side or Ecstasy side if taken together, in terms of dosing? i.e. It&#039;s far more dangerous to take 250-400mg of Tramadol with 130mg Ecstasy, than it is to take 3x130mg Ecstasy (spread out over several hours) with a single dose of 50mg Tramadol in your system?<br /><br />Thanks for your answers, I&#039;m sure this will help clear up a lot of confusion and keep people safer out there!<br />

				Hi DoctorX!&nbsp; It&#039;s so refreshing to see someone doing something like this!&nbsp; Thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to help the members of the Silk Road community. My internet was crapping out so I was unable to read the whole thread and I apologize if someone else has already asked my questions.<br /><br />I&#039;m a type one diabetic and so I&#039;m always worried about long term effects drugs might have on me.&nbsp; I try to do everything in my power to minimize risks and maximize fun with any drug experiences I have but I have heard some things recently that make me a bit concerned.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard from multiple sources of pancreatic damage due to drugs, and everything I have read has been so vague as too just say drug use.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also heard that users of Black Tar Heroin will have their veins harder and become smaller.&nbsp; To me these both sound like very dramatic reactions to long term addiction where daily use was involved but I can&#039;t find anything thing to back this up.&nbsp; What are the risks (if any) of recreational/social use of Black Tar Heroin and how difficult is it to receive pancreatic damage from social use of drugs in general?<br /><br />I would also like some more information about Pipe Dreams or dreaming while awake on Opiates and Opioids, and how and why it works.&nbsp; Also if there is anywhere online to read up on this subject I would appreciate a link.<br /><br />Thank you for your time Doctor.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to hear what you have too say. :D

				Ibogaine is the active chemical found in the African Tabernanthe iboga root and other plant species. It is a strong psychedelic used traditionally in rituals of passage but also known for its modern use in treating opiate addiction. Ibogaine and noribogaine have action in many different cerebral systems (dopamine, GABA, serotonin, noradrenaline...). In relation with drug depencence, its mechanism of action does not work as a substitutive for narcotics or stimulants and has been defined as a &quot;chemical dependence interrupter&quot; that would have the ability of &quot;resetting&quot; some parts of cerebral circuits responsible on manteining drug-seeking behaviours.<br />There are enough scientific communications to assert that ibogaine can be useful in opiate dependence, at least for some patients. <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15064541<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10506904<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10911935<br />But, until now, there are no good clinical trials on it. The cause is probably that ibogaine itself is a scheduled drug in many countries, and the fact that pharmaceutic industry does not have a particular interest on it. Ibogaine does have its own adverse effects and toxicity and it should be prescribed or used by professionals with enough knowledge on it. Finally, there is no magic drug to quit opiate dependence in everybody. Some people are more sensible to a particular treatment, Iboga may be useful for some people, for other it would be better traditional options.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1420918#msg1420918">Quote from: bananafandango on August 07, 2013, 02:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Doctor, thank you so much for volunteering your time and energy to the users on this site. It is quite a bonus to have access to a doctor for our questions. <br /><br />I actually quit using opiates by doing a flood dose of Iboga under clinical conditions in Mexico (where it is legal). It immediately halted my physical addiction (130mg of oxy daily) and withdrawals from it. I mean it when I say immediately. There were zero w/d symptoms after taking it, though the experience of having Iboga in my system required a lot of help for a day. It causes major ataxia and can cause vomiting, though I did not experience that. To me, it is an amazing option for those who really want to quit. <br /><br />Do you know about Iboga/Ibogaine?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				if one is taking dmt for the first time, and is taking it on his own (one person), is there anything that should be taken into consideration?

				I´m sorry I have no specific answer for your question. Your explanation is very careful and detailed. I can´t say many things. Only that substances have their own risks and characteristics,and paranoia is one of the main characteristics of long-term, high-dose of cocaine, as yours. It is related to the biochemical circuits activated by cocaine, related to regulation of function like fear and alertness that are directly affected by use of cocaine. There is no way to avoid it, at least as far as I know. It is simply an adverse effect of cocaine, typical of intensive use of some ways of administration (iv, smoked...) and there is no way to avoid it. Suppose that you like the taste of chilli but don´t like how it burns.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1422207#msg1422207">Quote from: schnelles on August 07, 2013, 09:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">hi doc,<br /><br /><br />i am an old, longtime coke user.<br /><br />in the beginning i was injecting it for many many years, had good qualities back then, was in peru and bolivia, and, as usual in cases like this, in the end came paranoia.<br />it came slow, first a little, then getting harder, after 16 years it was so extreme that i had to stop injecting.<br /><br />i did base and crack a while, which, after some years, as well developed paranoia that can be compared to the para i have when injecting.<br /><br />today i can only snort.<br />then the para, which comes in times a little bit, can be controlled mostly.<br /><br />but when i injected now (after a break of 15 yerars i did it once shortly ago) it has not gotten better even after a 15 years beak injecting and over 10 years break in doing coke at all.<br />it is all there, as if there was no break.,<br /><br /><br />anyway, today i am just in the mode for some more coke.<br /><br />when i did this one injection shortly, it brought me to hell.<br />as the kick arrives, i feel like being thrown in a world or situation like in the movie alien 2, when they are on that planet in that building and all of a sudden the aliens start moving all around them (and they realize they are surrounded by these deadly hostile aliens and will not get out anymore).<br /><br />all i do is rush back to the wall, down on my knees or lying down on bed, and try to not move.<br />behind me (though there is no space behind me) i know and feel THEM who are attacking me any second now by stabbing knifes into my throat, into my eyes and whatever. they will do things i wont describe, they are horrible. <br />if someone i know is there with me, and i usually trust her/him, i dont trust them anymore in this moment.<br />this person may assure me : there is noone, we are all alone !<br />i dont believe it, i rather believe that person works now together with the attackers, whom I FEEL AND KNOW are on the jump and located hidden all around me.<br />depending in the amount i start trembling but not in a normal tremble way, but more in an epileptic way.<br /><br />i dont want top describe further, the horrors are much worse than i can describe here.<br />as good as it was in the beginnign, as bad it is now.<br /><br /><br /><br />my question to you :<br /><br />I WANT TO GET RID OF THIS PARANOIA !<br />i want to inject again and have those divine cocaine kicks i used to have in the early times.<br /><br />there MUST be some biochemical way to remove or block this paranoia !<br />there must be some chemical stuff that stops it, makes it not appear.<br /><br />what do you think could be done ?<br />what is the reason for this paranoia ?<br />where is it located in the brain, what happens there when this extreme paranioia comes ?<br />and why it hasnt turned less after many years of not doing coke.<br /><br /><br />i know, you probably want to tell me : <br />stop it - its not worth it,&nbsp; you kill yourself&nbsp; etc. etc pp.<br /><br />this is completely useless as i wont.<br />i am a convinced coke user, i may say it is more like a religion to me.<br /><br />i have it pretty much under control when snorting.<br />but earlier i called snorting &quot;kindergarten&quot;.<br />it doesnt give a tenth of what an injection can give you.<br /><br />as it is now, i wont inject anymore, it is simply horrible and nothing else anymore.<br /><br />but i wish i could !<br />i&#039;d love to.<br /><br /><br />if i am to die from coke - so be it.<br /><br /><br />but what can be done to remove that nerv killing paranoia and be able again to enjoy the &quot;injecting coke kicks&quot; ?<br /><br />even if it wouldnt be as good as in the beginning, but without that paranoia it would be still good.<br /><br />so : <br /><br />what is the reason for this paranoia ?<br /><br />has anyone ever tried to find out moire about this ?<br /><br />where is it located ?<br /><br />what can be done against it ?<br /><br /><br />i dont need hints like &quot;use diazepam, use lorazepam etc.<br />i do.<br /><br />but it only lowers the paranoia, it cannot remove it. not at all.<br /><br /><br />could you think of any way and anything i could try to get rid of this paranoia and <br />enjoy the blessing of cocaine injections again ?<br /><br /><br />thanks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				In general most users of MDMA notice that effect diminish if using more than once a week. It is not a mathematical rule, but a general impression. For some people the appearance of this effect is quicker, for some is slower. But sooner or later it always appear for everyone.<br /><br />It is unlikely that a line of cocaine has negative adverse effects or significant toxicity during a LSD experience. But most people think that stimulants can ruin a LSD (or psychedelic) experience. It is not a good combination because it diminish psychedelic effects and increases adverse psychological effects from stimulants.

				Doctor, around tapering off Diazepam, is it important to be really strict about the mgs?&nbsp; <br /><br />Specifically, let&#039;s say I&#039;ve taken roughly 7.5mg daily for 3 months.&nbsp; Do I need to start tapering down to .70 for a week, then .65 for a week, etc.. or can I fairly safely taper down in larger amounts initially?&nbsp; i.e. is there more concern in tapering slowly from 2.5mg to zero than from 7.5mg to 5mg?&nbsp; <br /><br />the reason I ask is because I have read some pretty stringent tapering suggestions online, and quite frankly I eyeball the 7.5mg anyway (I just break the 10mg in half and half of it in half) so the idea of tapering down by like .05mg per month seems a bit extraneous.<br /><br />Tip coming your way!&nbsp; THANK YOU

				Bluedev, if you&#039;re particularly concerned about exact dosages when it comes to tapering, you have one of two options to make your doses accurate:<br /><br />- if you&#039;re obtaining your Valium legally (ie. with a prescription) you can go to a compounding pharmacy and they will formulate a preparation with whatever dose you want.<br /><br />- if you&#039;re getting your Valium from SR or you don&#039;t have a compounding pharmacy near you, titrating Valium in milk is very easy. Let&#039;s say you want to take a 1mg dose. Drop a 5mg tab into 100ml of milk, leave it for a bit, shake. The pill will dissolve readily and the mixture will be homogenised. Put it in the fridge. When you want your dose, shake the preparation, measure out 20ml, and drink. The milk will go bad before the meds stop working; don&#039;t worry about that. Of course, it&#039;s easy to adjust your dosage. If you are micro-tapering, just use less Valium in more milk to make tiny cuts.

				Brilliant work doc :) One very simple short question: Is nightly use of GHB to aid sleep going to be causing physiological damage? Just I notice that people with narcolepsy can be prescribed it (xyrem) with two 4.5g doses a night to help them sleep at night and stay awake in the day. So it can&#039;t be that damaging, if at all, right?

				Doctor, I have decided that i have smoked enough in my life. I have decided to quit smoking, i know it is hard, i have tried with temporary success in the past, and i know it is a thing that can be done. The key is &quot;forever&quot;. I cant promise it to my self though.. <br />I want to be like that member, i was reading when i was noob, that was telling us that he uses only illegal drugs!!! but was free from alcohol and tobacco and coffee!!!!! I am SO jealous of him :D<br />So, i am really into going for a (portable) vaporizer, but since i am not rich, I dont know what to buy. i dont want to spend more than 150-200 euros. Do&nbsp; all vaporizers need replacement parts over time?<br /><br />Actually doctor, i wonder if it is the toxicity of the smoke in lungs that gets me &quot;high&quot; rather than the THC itself. Will i get high with vaporizer?<br />And also, if i vaporize tobbaco, do i get the nicotine in my blood? or only the taste??? Is it nicotine that causes cancer, or the whole toxic mixture of smoking a cigarette. <br /><br />And now that i spoke of cancer, i want your opinion, this is only that counts, on this question: Is the Hash oil (rick simpson&#039;s recipe) the cure for cancer????<br />I mean, there is scientific evidence that THC kills cancer cells, isn&#039;t there? but Rick Simpson says only the oil does.. not buds or so. <br />What do you think doctor? Tell me a reason that someone would promote this as the cure of cancer, since it is illegal to obtain. I do believe it is.<br /><br />I do drugs, cause i want to feel different the real world. With cigarettes all i see is myself raping my lungs, and yet no change in perception of things / world. <br />Really these bastards have put all their effort to make you addicted to smoking for life... People prefer to die over quitting smoking, even after doctor&#039;s final recommendation.<br /><br />I would really like your to see your answer Doctor. Have a nice day and thank you in advance. This shall be my last cigarette.<br /><br />I am very bad psychologically, with all this social hypocrisy on the matter of drugs. Smokers see themselves as no junkies, i feel it is...funny,&nbsp; i dont know the word, it is frustrating!!!<br />I now will smoke the last cigarette. Tomorrow i will not buy, neither the day after tomorrow. I really do know the first days are the difficult. I prefer isolated and clean from smokers around, rather than social and with the temptation around. And until i buy the vaporizer, i would use my bong.<br />

				Hey DoctorX, what are your opinions on Dextroamphetamine?<br />I like to use it recreationally sometimes. I&#039;ll take 65-70mg and then 6-8 hours later take another 65-75mg. I&#039;ll generally be up all night and sleep the following day. I once binged on 420mg Dextroamphetamine during a 48 hour period. I&#039;ve only done this once, but I was curious as to what type of damage I was doing. I always end my night with a high dose (3-4mg) of Alprazolam for the comedown, sometimes taking another 2-4mg 5-6 hours later as it&#039;s quite short acting.<br /><br />I always space my highs out 14-21 days apart as I get a prescription every 3 weeks. Do you think I&#039;m causing any permanent damage considering how long I wait in between doses? I also stay hydrated during my highs.

As we know, Tramadol is a complex multi-action painkiller which effects serotonin-levels in the brain, similar to how SSRI drugs work.<br /><br />Note: For the sake of this question, let&#039;s assume that &quot;Ecstasy&quot; is pure and has been verified as such (I know the risks involved with Ecstasy pills being laced with other substances, but let&#039;s assume for this question, this is pure tested crystal/powder form Ecstasy, and not pills).<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1) Is it at all dangerous to take both Tramadol and Ecstasy together? i.e. 50mg Tramadol, then 8 hours later, 130mg Ecstasy?<br /><br />2) Assuming it&#039;s not safe to take these two drugs together, what would be a reasonable &quot;wash-out&quot; period to abstain from Tramadol before using Ecstasy? (I&#039;ve seen people suggest wide ranging time periods, from 24 hours, to weeks, but generally 3 days is the recommend wash-out time period).<br /><br />3) If you did take both drugs together (by accident) and had some adverse reaction, would taking a short-acting benzo (i.e. Xanax) help in that situation and prevent or lessen the risk of seizure and/or serotonin syndrome?<br /><br />4) Is the risk higher on the Tramadol side or Ecstasy side if taken together, in terms of dosing? i.e. It&#039;s far more dangerous to take 250-400mg of Tramadol with 130mg Ecstasy, than it is to take 3x130mg Ecstasy (spread out over several hours) with a single dose of 50mg Tramadol in your system?<br /><br />Thanks for your answers, I&#039;m sure this will help clear up a lot of confusion and keep people safer out there!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />1) In more than 40 years of recreative use of MDMA there are no known cases of significant toxicity by combination of tramadol and MDMA. It does not mean that the combination is sure or safe, but is probable that it does not mean severe risks.<br /><br />2) Half life of tramadol is 6-9 hours, so a 24 hour wash-off would be enough to be 100% sure<br /><br />3) I don´t think that the combination will produce seizures or serotonin syndrome. If there were a serotonin syndrome it shouls de managed in hospital. A benzo will diminish the effects of the drugs, basically MDMA.<br /><br />4) The theorical risk would be lesser with small doses of tramadol

Let&#039;s say you want to take a 1mg dose. Drop a 5mg tab into 100ml of milk, leave it for a bit, shake. The pill will dissolve readily and the mixture will be homogenised. Put it in the fridge. When you want your dose, shake the preparation, measure out 20ml, and drink. The milk will go bad before the meds stop working; don&#039;t worry about that.

It depends in many factors (age, degree of control of the disease, habits, patterns of use...) In general is important to know the properties of the substances and adapt it to your disease. I mean, some substances will make feel no hunger (MDMA, stimulants), other stimule apetite (cannabis), some of them can make feel your body different (ketamine) and you should be careful not to hurt you or have wounds in your feet, for example...<br />Drugs that affect circulation system (arteries and veins) should be used with caution. Tobacco is the most important and should be avoided by diabetics. Probably, intranasal use of heroin will not affect too much your disease (although you should be concerned about all the problems of opioids) Other ways of use of heroin (smoked and iv) are much harmful in your case. Pancreatic damage depends on the substance and way of use also, alcohol is the most harmful drug in this sense. <br />This matter is so extense and complicate...if you have a more particular or specific question I can try to assess...

It´s like planning a trip. If you do it well, risk of problems is much lesser. I always reccomend this document:<br />http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_experience_faq.shtml<br />And in your case, specific information about DMT:<br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/dmt_basics.shtml<br />Although DMT is a short acting psychedelic, it is always reccomendable not to do it alone, to be with someone else that does not use the substance at the same time. So he/she can help if something goes wrong.<br />Metylphenidate is a CNS stimulant. It will reinforce stimulant properties of other drugs used at the same time. Probably effects on psychedelics will not be noticeable (depending on dose), combination with stimulants (speed, meth, cocaine, caffeine) will make adverse effects more noticeable.

As we know, Tramadol is a complex multi-action painkiller which effects serotonin-levels in the brain, similar to how SSRI drugs work.<br /><br />Note: For the sake of this question, let&#039;s assume that &quot;Ecstasy&quot; is pure and has been verified as such (I know the risks involved with Ecstasy pills being laced with other substances, but let&#039;s assume for this question, this is pure tested crystal/powder form Ecstasy, and not pills).<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1) Is it at all dangerous to take both Tramadol and Ecstasy together? i.e. 50mg Tramadol, then 8 hours later, 130mg Ecstasy?<br /><br />2) Assuming it&#039;s not safe to take these two drugs together, what would be a reasonable &quot;wash-out&quot; period to abstain from Tramadol before using Ecstasy? (I&#039;ve seen people suggest wide ranging time periods, from 24 hours, to weeks, but generally 3 days is the recommend wash-out time period).<br /><br />3) If you did take both drugs together (by accident) and had some adverse reaction, would taking a short-acting benzo (i.e. Xanax) help in that situation and prevent or lessen the risk of seizure and/or serotonin syndrome?<br /><br />4) Is the risk higher on the Tramadol side or Ecstasy side if taken together, in terms of dosing? i.e. It&#039;s far more dangerous to take 250-400mg of Tramadol with 130mg Ecstasy, than it is to take 3x130mg Ecstasy (spread out over several hours) with a single dose of 50mg Tramadol in your system?<br /><br />Thanks for your answers, I&#039;m sure this will help clear up a lot of confusion and keep people safer out there!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />1) In more than 40 years of recreative use of MDMA there are no known cases of significant toxicity by combination of tramadol and MDMA. It does not mean that the combination is sure or safe, but is probable that it does not mean severe risks.<br /><br />2) Half life of tramadol is 6-9 hours, so a 24 hour wash-off would be enough to be 100% sure<br /><br />3) I don´t think that the combination will produce seizures or serotonin syndrome. If there were a serotonin syndrome it shouls de managed in hospital. A benzo will diminish the effects of the drugs, basically MDMA.<br /><br />4) The theorical risk would be lesser with small doses of tramadol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Many thanks Doc for clearing this up, and now we have a reference to show people on other forums who are confused about the risks.<br /><br />I thank you for your time replying, and have sent BC.&nbsp; <br /><br />NOTE: Everyone who asks the Doc a question which keeps them and others safe, please consider sending a few bucks (whatever you can afford to spare, why not donate any loose change BC on your account - see his signature for his BC address). The Doc is making his time available and it&#039;s clear this is taking up a lot of his time now. He needs payment for that time, just as anyone else would.&nbsp; This is extremely valuable have a medically trained doctor on hand and it would be a shame if the Doc felt he was being taken for granted and stopped answering questions.

				Hey doc, I have a question regarding the use of MDMA..<br />I&#039;m not a heavy MDMA user in the meaning of doing it much in a year. I only do MDMA on festivals and I only do around 3 a year in summer holiday. But on those festival I tend to take A LOT of MDMA, 600-800mg in around 6 hours, just because I love to roll that hard :D. Before and after I roll, I take exra vitamine supplements and also take tryptophan supplements after i have rolled.<br />I&#039;m 19 years old and weight 58kg.. for the rest, I never touch drugs except weed, 2C-B and alcohol sometimes.<br /><br />Will this heavy MDMA use 3 times a year will affect my body a lot in the long term? i&#039;m still in High School and don&#039;t want to destroy my body.<br />greets

Even if a lot of the problems people talk about here don&#039;t apply to me, I still find them very interesting.<br /><br />My question is this: Is there any cross-tolerance between psilocin/psilocybin and DMT.

				Hi doctorX,<br /><br />I have a couple benzo related questions. I&#039;m not sure if this was asked before. <br /><br />Anyway, this first question is about xanx. I was wondering how tolerance quick a tolerance develops and lasts. Specifically, if I take 1 mg a day for 3 days would the effects decrease each day? Then let&#039;s say I take a 1.5-2 week break would my tolerance be back to zero by then? I haven&#039;t used benzos regularly for a while now for some background. Though, I did take 1 mg a week before. <br /><br /><br />Accordingly, I have a question about post acute withdrawal for benzos specifically clonazepam. A little background here, as adolescent I was prescribed clonazapam for anxiety. I don&#039;t remember what my initial dosage was but I was taking 1 mg three times a day for a while. Well, after doing that about ~10 years the docs decided to pull me off because they are addictive. I&#039;ve been off benzos for nearly a year (except for just recently) and I am not sure if this is a withdrawal, but for a long time I&#039;ve been feeling constant anxiety. The anxiety makes life so much more difficult because I tend to avoid social interaction and makes falling asleep difficult; haven&#039;t had a good sleep in about a year now. In addition its affecting my concentration. <br /><br /><br />My question is this normal to have affects so long after discontinuing benzos and if so how long could this take? If this is not normal could it be because I began taking them at such a young age which complicates the matter?<br /><br />The only reason I took the xanx is to help get through a stressful situation and to come down from a psychedelic trip this week and another in 2 weeks. <br /><br />Also, do you have any suggestions as to my anxiety? I&#039;ve tried SSRIs in the past and they all cause suicidal thoughts. Should I just begin taking benzos again? I would rather ask for your opinion because my current doctor is completely against benzos under any circumstance so I would prefer a more objective answer. <br /><br />Thanks a lot for spending your time helping people. Its a shame most doctors aren&#039;t like you. Here in the US if you start asking questions about drugs they can put a note on your medical info; this piece of info is then available to other doctors. Basically, you will be treated like a junkie. I know many people who refuse to go to the ER because of this. <br /><br />Glad to see a doctor who cares more about safety then being indoctrinated to preach don&#039;t do drugs.

I must confess that I`m not a expert in this particular kind of substances, but I have been searching about them and most I have found are preclinical data. They are no so developed to be sure about their real effects and risks. In my opinion, is much better, safe and even cheap to use human growth hormone. At least it has been a prescription drug used about 70 years and all its properties, problems and risks are well studied

I have decided to quit smoking, i know it is hard, i have tried with temporary success in the past, and i know it is a thing that can be done. The key is &quot;forever&quot;. I cant promise it to my self though.. <br />I want to be like that member, i was reading when i was noob, that was telling us that he uses only illegal drugs!!! but was free from alcohol and tobacco and coffee!!!!! I am SO jealous of him :D<br />So, i am really into going for a (portable) vaporizer, but since i am not rich, I dont know what to buy. i dont want to spend more than 150-200 euros. Do&nbsp; all vaporizers need replacement parts over time?<br /><br />Actually doctor, i wonder if it is the toxicity of the smoke in lungs that gets me &quot;high&quot; rather than the THC itself. Will i get high with vaporizer?<br />And also, if i vaporize tobbaco, do i get the nicotine in my blood? or only the taste??? Is it nicotine that causes cancer, or the whole toxic mixture of smoking a cigarette. <br /><br />And now that i spoke of cancer, i want your opinion, this is only that counts, on this question: Is the Hash oil (rick simpson&#039;s recipe) the cure for cancer????<br />I mean, there is scientific evidence that THC kills cancer cells, isn&#039;t there? but Rick Simpson says only the oil does.. not buds or so. <br />What do you think doctor? Tell me a reason that someone would promote this as the cure of cancer, since it is illegal to obtain. I do believe it is.<br /><br />I do drugs, cause i want to feel different the real world. With cigarettes all i see is myself raping my lungs, and yet no change in perception of things / world. <br />Really these bastards have put all their effort to make you addicted to smoking for life... People prefer to die over quitting smoking, even after doctor&#039;s final recommendation.<br /><br />I would really like your to see your answer Doctor. Have a nice day and thank you in advance. This shall be my last cigarette.<br /><br />I am very bad psychologically, with all this social hypocrisy on the matter of drugs. Smokers see themselves as no junkies, i feel it is...funny,&nbsp; i dont know the word, it is frustrating!!!<br />I now will smoke the last cigarette. Tomorrow i will not buy, neither the day after tomorrow. I really do know the first days are the difficult. I prefer isolated and clean from smokers around, rather than social and with the temptation around. And until i buy the vaporizer, i would use my bong.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />About vaporizers, my recommendation is usually the Volcano model. I have no relation with its company and I´m not trying to give free advertising, but it is the only model that has proven in clinical trials efficacy in delivering cannabinoids to lungs without any other toxic or carcinogenic particles.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20118579<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19852551<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18515447<br />I suppose there are other similar devices, cheaper, with similar properties but Volcano has the best guarantee in this moment. If you vaporize tobacco you will have nicotine, but not the rest of toxic particles.<br />My opinion on Rick Simpson´s Oil is a big scam. There are no real, clinical data about its efficacy and all the story sounds incredible. He talks about &quot;investigation&quot; (not showing how,when and what...), he does not consider the variety of the plant, dosages are unknown (&quot;a bit&quot;) and, in medicine, there is no single drug that can cure almost any disease of humanity. I think this story is giving false hopes to ill people, and I think it is not fair. Therapeutic use of cannabinoids is one of my fields of work, I am a strong deffensor of it; for this same reason I reject all this story

I&#039;ll take 65-70mg and then 6-8 hours later take another 65-75mg. I&#039;ll generally be up all night and sleep the following day. I once binged on 420mg Dextroamphetamine during a 48 hour period. I&#039;ve only done this once, but I was curious as to what type of damage I was doing.

This limit can work as an orientation, but it is difficult to say what and how probable are the risks. In general, the higher is the difference between your recreative dosage and the prescription dosage,&nbsp; the risks increase. But some people can have negative or adverse effects at therapeutic dosages, and other seem to be almost immune to overdose. It is not only a question of permanent damage (neurological, for example, although the risks of occasional overdoses are probably low) but also of an acute problem caused by a high dose (blood presure, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events). In young healthy people these events are uncommon, but possible

				Typical dosages of DMT are 10-50 mg, depending also on personal sensitivity. Smoking in a joint or cigarrete will destroy most of the active DMT. It is much better to use a glass pipe (or even aluminium foil). Full psychedelic effects of DMT are of short duration but very strong.

				As far as I know, this subject has not been studied. But DMT and psilocin/psilocybin (4-0H-DMT) are quite similar substances, act in same receptors and are metabolyzed in a similar way.

				Hi Doctor X i just logged in to give you simple suggestions since you seemed someone who should receive all that is good in the life.<br /><br />-First i suggest that you translate your webpage more international and accessible, translate it to several languages just by investing a bit in cloud workers to do that for you.<br />-Start accepting more cryptocurrencies if you want.<br />-Add your website into the wiki https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Health_Care, it brings a lot of bitcoiners directly to you.<br />-Keep all the website simple and stupid, by providing more information to the question that most people usually ask so that when people do ask you, they will come with bigger and better questions.<br /><br />This was just some ideas nothing mandatory to do.<br /><br />Much Respect<br />Anon

I&#039;m not sure if this was asked before. <br /><br />Anyway, this first question is about xanx. I was wondering how tolerance quick a tolerance develops and lasts. Specifically, if I take 1 mg a day for 3 days would the effects decrease each day? Then let&#039;s say I take a 1.5-2 week break would my tolerance be back to zero by then? I haven&#039;t used benzos regularly for a while now for some background. Though, I did take 1 mg a week before. <br /><br /><br />Accordingly, I have a question about post acute withdrawal for benzos specifically clonazepam. A little background here, as adolescent I was prescribed clonazapam for anxiety. I don&#039;t remember what my initial dosage was but I was taking 1 mg three times a day for a while. Well, after doing that about ~10 years the docs decided to pull me off because they are addictive. I&#039;ve been off benzos for nearly a year (except for just recently) and I am not sure if this is a withdrawal, but for a long time I&#039;ve been feeling constant anxiety. The anxiety makes life so much more difficult because I tend to avoid social interaction and makes falling asleep difficult; haven&#039;t had a good sleep in about a year now. In addition its affecting my concentration. <br /><br /><br />My question is this normal to have affects so long after discontinuing benzos and if so how long could this take? If this is not normal could it be because I began taking them at such a young age which complicates the matter?<br /><br />The only reason I took the xanx is to help get through a stressful situation and to come down from a psychedelic trip this week and another in 2 weeks. <br /><br />Also, do you have any suggestions as to my anxiety? I&#039;ve tried SSRIs in the past and they all cause suicidal thoughts. Should I just begin taking benzos again? I would rather ask for your opinion because my current doctor is completely against benzos under any circumstance so I would prefer a more objective answer. <br /><br />Thanks a lot for spending your time helping people. Its a shame most doctors aren&#039;t like you. Here in the US if you start asking questions about drugs they can put a note on your medical info; this piece of info is then available to other doctors. Basically, you will be treated like a junkie. I know many people who refuse to go to the ER because of this. <br /><br />Glad to see a doctor who cares more about safety then being indoctrinated to preach don&#039;t do drugs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi,<br />Tolerance to benzodiacepines develops in weeks. Not everybody develops the same degree of tolerance and tolerance to each effect of benzodiacepines (sedation, anticonvulsive, ansiolitic, muscle relaxant) develops at different speed. But it is neccesary to wait 2-3 weeks to appear tolerance.<br />Anxiety can be a symptom of benzodiacepine withdrawal. In general, symptoms of withdrawal persist during weeks or one/two months depending on the pharmacological characteristics of the specific benzo. One year seems too much to think benzos are the cause of your anxiety.The fact that you started at young age should not be important.<br />In general, benzos are not reccomendated for long-time control of anxiety because of dependence potencial and rebound effect. Escitalopram, venlafaxine, duloxetine and paroxetine are, in general, the best options. Some patients also get benefits with lamotrigine or gabapentine. Of course, it is neccesary some psychological support. The best option/s needs to be discussed face-to-face with a professional.

Cardiovascular training through physical exercise produces, among other effects, vasodilation ( widening of blood vessels ) of coronary arteries that give blood to the heart.Physical exercise has effects on the rests of the muscles and apparatus of the body . But using cocaine produces the contrary effect (vasoconstriction) and electrical and biochemical changes to the muscle of heart.&nbsp; So using it for &quot;cardiovascular training&quot; is useless and dangerous.

Another possibility is that your weed was mixed with some synthetic cannabinoids. If you have shared your weed with other people and you are the only one having effects with such a little dosage, that would mean that you are very sensitive. If other people have the same effects with so little quantity or if the effects have some differences with other weeds synthetic cannabinoids adulteration should be ruled out.

In fact, I don´t think I can help too much with your question, because it is impossible to give an advice without knowing exactly the case. Sometimes Internet is good for giving advice but in this case it should be neccesary a personal evaluation.&nbsp; Cocaine can trigger palpitations in sensible persons. As far as I know, ramipril or amlodipine in combination with cocaine should not give additional problems.<br />But there is a important thing you should know. Mixture of cocaine and beta-blockers is not a good idea. It can trigger hypertensive or cardiac diseases. There is still some controversy in medicine on this topic, but there are enough data to strongly advise against this combination.<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16627850<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18072171<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20206876<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059982

You inform people on how to use drugs safely, and i feel more than proud of being able to ask you any drug-using related question.<br /><br />But on the other hand doctor, if it was as simple as taking this oil, and it worked, why wouldn&#039;t you get well paid to hide that truth....?<br /><br />No offense doctor, you have your doubts about R.S , i have my doubts about you, and doctors, generally. I have not taken any medicines for many years. <br /><br />This is world is simply full of conspiracies brothers and sisters of Silk Road. :( They want to kill us all, but before that give all our money to the so called &quot;medical system&quot;<br /><br />If you, DPR, or any other admin, thinks that what i am talking about here is completely irrelevant to this thread, i would understand it, so go ahead and delete this. All i wanted is an open discussion on the matter<br />Thanks<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is no reason for deleting your message. The only limits should be lack of respect or bad manners and this is not your case. <br /><br />It is possible that &quot;scam&quot; is a too strong word. You should excuse that my English is limited and expressing complex ideas is sometimes difficult to me. What I mean is that there are no proofs of its efficacy. I can´t say that people in that video are actors, they probably beleive what they are saying and, probably, some part of the story is true (Simpson and friends began distributing cannabis oil, and Health and Law Canadian Authorities got very angry because of that).&nbsp; But, in science, demonstrations must be positive. It is them who should demonstrate with irrefutable evidences that their story is true. Things work like this. The fact that a story appears on Internet or reaches popularity does not mean that it is true. If you look in YouTube or Google for &quot;Queen Elizabeth lizard&quot; you would discover that the Queen is really a reptilian. Arguments are similar to those of RS story.<br />I will try to summarize some of the points that make this story incredible.<br /><br />1) RS oil is supposed to cure cancer. &quot;Cancer&quot; is a generic word for more than 140 different diseases, each one of them with their mechanisms of productions (genetical, enviromental, toxic, metabolic, infectious...), and different prognosis and treatments. It is impossible to &quot;cure cancer&quot; as, a lymphoma treatment is different to lung cancer or cervix cancer.<br /><br />2) RS oil is also supossed to cure not also &quot;cancer&quot; but many other diseases (he mentions asthma, high blood presure, &quot;wounds&quot;, Alzheimer, Parkinson...) . In medicine, each disease has its own mechanism of production and there is no medication that is useful for almost everything. In fact, when a drug is promoted as panacea it should considered a fraud.<br /><br />3) RS video says that &quot;they have investigated properties of cannabis oil&quot;. In science, methods of investigation must be clearly explained in order that other scientist can repeat, critic or refuse them. There is not a single word about this &quot;method of investigation&quot;. In the documentary they quote some investigation data about cannabis in a false, biased way (as works of Dr. Manuel Guzmán on cannabis and one specific type of cancer, multiphorm glyoblastoma).<br /><br />4) In medicine, every drug is active at a specific dosage rank. Every drug in the world has adverse effects, contraindications and toxicity. Nothing of this happens with RS oil. There are weed plants that only have THC, THC/CBD or CBD in very different concentrations. Nothing of this is important to RS oil, which is active at a dose of &quot;one or two drops or a grain of rice&quot; (not very precise pharmacologically)<br /><br />5) RS oil story has all the elements of conspirative theories. I´m not saying that pharmaceutical industry is a innocent one (as many other enterprises). But such a political-economical-pharmaceutical-judicial conspiration to hide curative properties of cannabis oil is incredible. The best argument I can offer is the fact that cannabis has been a medicine widely used in the last 6000 years by different cultures. Surprisingly, Rick Simpson was the first person in the History of Humanity who discovered that cannabis oil cures everything. This fact had been unobserved by doctors of all the cultures ( Ancient Chinese Empire, Classical Greece, Hindi, Latin, Shamanic Eastern Cultures...) that have been using cannabis as a therapeutic drug during&nbsp; milleniums. Or maybe they were all included in the conspiration.<br /><br />You ask me if I have tried to treat my cancer patients with RS oil. I have never done that. But I have the experience of three different cancer&nbsp; patients who have left all their treatments, changing it for RS oil. The three of them died in months. OK...maybe this make me to be a bit combative in this subject.<br /><br />You say you have your doubts about me and doctors. To be critic and a bit sceptic is, in general, a healthy attitude. As long as we use reasoning and logic arguments&nbsp; I´m open to continue discussing this subject

				Doctor X. I wondered if I could ask you about 4FA.<br /><br />Ive been using this &#039;research chemical&#039; for a while in a range of doses as a party drug (100mg) and as a study/work aid (around 20mg).<br /><br />I recently read an article on the website &#039;drugs-forum.com&#039; [warning - clearnet link] (http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=175262)<br /><br />Where a guy claims that 4FA in particular, as well as other &#039;halogenated amphetamines&#039;, are terribly neural toxic. He says 4FA is closely related to a compund called para-chloroamphetamine (4-CA) which is used in research labs to selectively kill neurons.<br /><br />So I am wondering if you know anything about this Doctor X? <br /><br />I have stopped using 4FA after reading that article.

I wondered if I could ask you about 4FA.<br /><br />Ive been using this &#039;research chemical&#039; for a while in a range of doses as a party drug (100mg) and as a study/work aid (around 20mg).<br /><br />I recently read an article on the website &#039;drugs-forum.com&#039; [warning - clearnet link] (http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=175262)<br /><br />Where a guy claims that 4FA in particular, as well as other &#039;halogenated amphetamines&#039;, are terribly neural toxic. He says 4FA is closely related to a compund called para-chloroamphetamine (4-CA) which is used in research labs to selectively kill neurons.<br /><br />So I am wondering if you know anything about this Doctor X? <br /><br />I have stopped using 4FA after reading that article. But I am wondering to what extent I have given myself brain damage :(<br /><br />Thanks<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is true that &quot;halogenated amphetamines&quot; seem drugs more risky than other amphetamines. I agree with some of the arguments in the link of drugs-forum. In human pharmacology there are chemical elements common and other that, in general,are more toxic. Some fluorine and chlorine compounds are highly neurotoxic and structure of 4-FA resembles some of these drugs.<br />But in animal experimentation there is no evidence that 4-FA is neurotoxic:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8749023<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1196472<br />With this, I don´t mean that 4-FA is sure. Animal data do not suggest that neurotoxicity is an important problems but there is a lack of investigation on 4-FA as it is a drug made popular in the last 3-5 years. In fact there are recent reports about deaths caused by 2-FA,3-FA and 4-FA. <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22286570<br />I think advice against its use is valid but, probably, there are no data to be extremely worried about neurotoxicity. Classical amphetamines have been used during decades and their risks are perfectly known. This is not the case of 4-FA and, in my opinion,this is enough to advise against its use.

Stimulants are widely used for this condition, although there are important differences in diagnosis criteria and neccesity of drug therapy. For example, clinical guidelines in UK only reccomend stimulants in very severe cases, and in United States this kind of treatment is more easily prescribed. <br />I don´t want to expand on this issue, because I don´t want to create more doubts in you, but I don´t think auto-medication with amphetamine is a good strategy. In general, available amphetamine is an unpurified mixture of amphetamine salts (with high amount of caffeine and other adulterants, in many cases), and only dextroamphetamine is the approved treatment for ADHD. And even dextroamphetamine (and other medications as methylphenidate) should be used with caution in ADHD (from a medical point of view)

				DoctorX. <br /><br />First i want to say thanks for a great work in this thread and its very learning and intresting! <br />My question is (and i do ask for forgiveness in case its already been asked). Ive been usin cocain for about 8 months now on and of. The latest 8 months maybe a gram in month give or take a little. How damaging is this for the heart? Besides that i try to take care of myself i train 4-6 times a week and try to eat healthy. My father resently had a heart attack so there is a risk of bad genetics in this case. I really love to put some luxury on the everyday life like this but how bad is it for me? =) Regards Rambo ;)

				Hi Doc, <br /><br />Great job, just sent some spare coins your way, I strongly encourage encourage everybody else to do the same (BTW Erowid also has a fundraiser at the moment, please also consider sending some coins their way).<br /><br />I have some questions that I hope answers to which other users will also find valuable:<br /><br />1. What kind of drugs for emergency would you recommend to have at hand - let&#039;s say you are in a remote place and would like to have something when things go south with experiments. (Of course I&#039;m not treating them as the replacement for proper medical treatment in cases of really dangerous side effects/ODing, just in super mild ones).<br /><br />So far I tried to have with me:<br /><br />- diazepam for bad-trips emergencies with psychedelic drugs<br /><br />- prednisone and some antihistamines for every new drug in case of being allergic for any cutting agent or active substance (also doing allergy test with very small dose with each new substance/batch)<br /><br />- some drinkable electrolytes supplements from pharmacy for dehydration (for MDMA and stimulants)<br /><br />- mild stims (ephedrine) if me or friend shall feel that new depressant shall go to strong (GHB, opioids etc.)<br /><br />- proton pump inhibitors when taking things that maybe harsh on a stomach (like bigger amounts of plants ;) also always before drinking)<br /><br />- modafinil in case of drugs that tends to induce partial amnesia or downers that make sleepy (it works PERFECTLY for this -- you loose less from the experience and from what I researched is very safe drug)<br /><br />- sphygmomanometer (for blood pressure measuring for those unfamiliar with the name) and glucose meter for checking if everything is okay in some cases<br /><br />I would also love to know what&#039;s your opinion on the last one, as I know that mixing uppers and downers is wrong because it may interact or promote dose abuse, but I&#039;m talking only about &quot;emergency&quot; use<br /><br />I also do electrolytes and vitamin supplements prophylactically before and after testing most substances.<br /><br />So, what would you add to these/would you modify that?<br /><br />2. Friend has elevated blood pressure and is significantly overweight -- is there any blood pressure lowering drug that could be taken temporarily to counteract the heightening effect of some stimulants (coke in different forms, amphetamine analogue family, some psychedelics)? I&#039;m not talking about constant treatment, I&#039;m just talking about 2-3 times a month at most experiments, each time with something different. In my country getting something prescribed for this reason is impossible due to legal issues with drugs (use and possession is illegal). <br /><br />Alternatively, is there any fast acting drug that could be taken once pressure would go too high that could be added to the kit I&#039;m asking about in first question? (Also, as I said we have pretty decent electronic sphygmomanometer at hand during experiments so we can control it - so any advice about when such drug/s shall be taken can also be of value).<br /><br />Also, if they are types of lowering blood pressure drugs that may have dangerous interactions with any of drugs from mentioned categories I would appreciate heads-up (I try to research such things but of course I can get sometimes drowned within amount of medical, specialized info).<br /><br />Many thanks in advance and take care.<br />

It wolud be neccesary to have big epidemiological studies with accurate information about patterns of use. There are some studies on tobacco and alcohol that are useful for these substances. But for the rest of substances it is far more difficult.<br />Cardiovascular risks depend on many factors: genetic factors, age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, diet, obesity, diabetes...it is very difficult to estimate the weight of cocaine use in an individual among these factors. The fact of familiar antecedents of cardiovascular disease should be considered as an additional risk factor, but not as an irreversible indicator.<br />The way of use of cocaine is also important. You say &quot;one gram a month more or less&quot; but, obviously, it is not the same to use one gram one night (once a month) than four times 250 mg. According to medium doses of cocaine use, one gram a month does not seem a tremendous excesive quantity, although I don´t mean with this that it is absolutely sure.<br />In your case, as a risk reduction measure, it would be important to control other possible cardiovascular factor risks (weight, blood pressure, tobacco use...) I don´t reccomend to use at the same benzodiacepines and alcohol as &quot;downers&quot; (as you say in the following message). The mixture of these two substances can increase adverse and toxic effects from benzos. Leaving cocaine use only for special situations, and not integrating it as an habit or usual activity will also help.<br />

Its analog alpha-ethyl-tryptamine seems to have neurotoxic potential at very high doses in animals.

On the other hand there is a recent report on cerebral toxicity in humans.&nbsp; I think (I insist, this is only my personal opinion) that this case has to be considered as a rarity and not as a frequent risk <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077393<br />Role of antioxidants is only theoretical speculation.

				DoctorX,<br /><br />I am prescribed Vyvanse 60mg which I take everyday at like 7 in the morning. Coming up is my buddys bachelor party where there will undoubtedly be cocaine. If I chose to partake, would I be making a big mistake by combining these two stimulants? Everything I read says do not combine because of cardiovascular issues, but they dont reference a time layover. I know about when the medicine starts to dissipate from my system as my eyes become foggier and my thoughts become jumbled together. This usually occurs around 5-6 that night, but can last till 8 depending on how much i eat that day. Now the cocaine would not be ingested until like 9-10 in the evening probably even later than that. With 12+ hours in between my vyvanse dose and cocaine, would it be safe to partake in the cocaine, or are there still too many traces of the amphetamine in my system? If thats the case then more than likely if i decide that day to participate, i wont take the vyvanse. Thanks! Love the Thread

				I have a question regarding out phasing (dont know the correct english term) Benzos - mainly Clonezapam, I don&#039;t know the exact dosage but say that I have roughly taken 2mg per day for 7-8 months now. My own physician gave me a fast schedule with Diazepam 5mg: [Week 1] Half a pill in the morning, 1 pill in the evening [Week 2] Half morning, half evening [Week 3] half evening. I personally thought this schedule to be too fast since Clonezapam is around 10 times stronger than Diaz, but he told me there is no magic out-phasing schedule, I will still have withdrawals irregardless. <br />What are your opinions on this schedule? He gave me more pills than I need for this schedule in case I would feel it not working out, so I could go as long as 6 weeks instead of 3. The reason I&#039;m not going CT is that I am starting college soon and I tried CT couple of months ago and it made my brain sooo slow... This is my main concern, not being able to concentrate for 2 cents.<br /><br />Great thing that you are here for us!

				How long does heroin withdrawal last?<br />Everywhere i read it says that its over after 5 to 7 days. I quit heroin after 2-3 months of everyday use and today is my 9th day (will be starting the tenth day in several hours) and the withdrawal isnt going away. I have a very achy back and legs and im constantly getting chills and goosebumps, and I have terrible anxiety and depression and the worst part is that I havent slept more than 2 or 3 hours a nite since the 1st nite. My body (especially my legs) is very restless at night and i feel like i have electricity running thru my body.<br />So my question is that will this last much longer or is it almost over? I know each person is different but is this normal?

What kind of drugs for emergency would you recommend to have at hand - let&#039;s say you are in a remote place and would like to have something when things go south with experiments. (Of course I&#039;m not treating them as the replacement for proper medical treatment in cases of really dangerous side effects/ODing, just in super mild ones).<br /><br />So far I tried to have with me:<br /><br />- diazepam for bad-trips emergencies with psychedelic drugs<br /><br />- prednisone and some antihistamines for every new drug in case of being allergic for any cutting agent or active substance (also doing allergy test with very small dose with each new substance/batch)<br /><br />- some drinkable electrolytes supplements from pharmacy for dehydration (for MDMA and stimulants)<br /><br />- mild stims (ephedrine) if me or friend shall feel that new depressant shall go to strong (GHB, opioids etc.)<br /><br />- proton pump inhibitors when taking things that maybe harsh on a stomach (like bigger amounts of plants ;) also always before drinking)<br /><br />- modafinil in case of drugs that tends to induce partial amnesia or downers that make sleepy (it works PERFECTLY for this -- you loose less from the experience and from what I researched is very safe drug)<br /><br />- sphygmomanometer (for blood pressure measuring for those unfamiliar with the name) and glucose meter for checking if everything is okay in some cases<br /><br />I would also love to know what&#039;s your opinion on the last one, as I know that mixing uppers and downers is wrong because it may interact or promote dose abuse, but I&#039;m talking only about &quot;emergency&quot; use<br /><br />I also do electrolytes and vitamin supplements prophylactically before and after testing most substances.<br /><br />So, what would you add to these/would you modify that?<br /><br />2. Friend has elevated blood pressure and is significantly overweight -- is there any blood pressure lowering drug that could be taken temporarily to counteract the heightening effect of some stimulants (coke in different forms, amphetamine analogue family, some psychedelics)? I&#039;m not talking about constant treatment, I&#039;m just talking about 2-3 times a month at most experiments, each time with something different. In my country getting something prescribed for this reason is impossible due to legal issues with drugs (use and possession is illegal). <br /><br />Alternatively, is there any fast acting drug that could be taken once pressure would go too high that could be added to the kit I&#039;m asking about in first question? (Also, as I said we have pretty decent electronic sphygmomanometer at hand during experiments so we can control it - so any advice about when such drug/s shall be taken can also be of value).<br /><br />Also, if they are types of lowering blood pressure drugs that may have dangerous interactions with any of drugs from mentioned categories I would appreciate heads-up (I try to research such things but of course I can get sometimes drowned within amount of medical, specialized info).<br /><br />Many thanks in advance and take care.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1.- Some of the drugs you propose seem reasonable in the indications you suggest, other not so in a pharmacological point of view. Benzos can be very useful in some stimulant or psychedelic complicated situation, although more incisive drugs (sublingual alprazolam or lorazepam) seem better in these cases. Prednisone or antihistaminic can control allergic reactions, although in this case it should be very reccomendable search for medical help if this reaction is not quickly controlled. Dehydration from MDMA is really uncommon, and pharmacy electrolytes taste is in general awful. Any soft-drink is suitable for this purpose. <br />I disagree with use of &quot;mild stimulants&quot; to treat problems with depressants. Neither ephedrine, modafinil and any other stimulants are used in the treatment of intoxication with depressants. So there is no evidence of efficacy of this, and I think also that there can be negative, idiosincratic effects. Naloxone and flumazenil are selective antidots of opioids and benzodiacepine, respectively, and may be very useful in these circumpstances. But GHB, cannabis or alcohol intoxication is never treated with stimulants.<br /><br />2.- It is important to distinguish if that person has a diagnosis of arterial hypertension or not. There is a general confussion between isolated high blood pressure registrs (very common and not necessarily pathological) and arterial hypertension disease. In this last case it would be necessary a personal evaluation of risks.<br />But in general, common dosages and occasional use of classical drugs produce moderate raises in blood pressure, limited in time,&nbsp; and there is no need of medication to diminish risks. There is no evidence that using antihypertensive drugs before using recreative drugs has any health benefit. <br />As a curiosity, only carvedilol and doxazosine have been used in combination with MDMA in clinical trials. In the case of cocaine, it is very important to avoid its combination with selective beta-blockers (propanolol, atenolol...) as it can increase cardiovascular risk

Coming up is my buddys bachelor party where there will undoubtedly be cocaine. If I chose to partake, would I be making a big mistake by combining these two stimulants? Everything I read says do not combine because of cardiovascular issues, but they dont reference a time layover. I know about when the medicine starts to dissipate from my system as my eyes become foggier and my thoughts become jumbled together. This usually occurs around 5-6 that night, but can last till 8 depending on how much i eat that day. Now the cocaine would not be ingested until like 9-10 in the evening probably even later than that. With 12+ hours in between my vyvanse dose and cocaine, would it be safe to partake in the cocaine, or are there still too many traces of the amphetamine in my system? If thats the case then more than likely if i decide that day to participate, i wont take the vyvanse. Thanks! Love the Thread<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Half-life of dexamphetamine is 10-12 hours. It is necessary this time to lower 50% amphetamine levels in body, and additional 10-12 hours to diminish it to 75%.<br />Depending on the cause of the prescription and your general both physical and mental health state, you can contemplate the possibility of avoiding your medication 1-2 days, in the case you are using cocaine that day. In order to estimate the risks, it is also very important to consider the dosage of cocaine. Moderate ocassional amounts have probably very limited risks, even in the case you don´t suspend your medication. If you use larger quantities, probably the risks are higher.

Modafinil is only recommended in narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome and shift work sleep disorder. Technical sheet of modafinil says that “Caution should be exercised in giving modafinil to patients with a history of psychiatric disorders including psychosis, depression, mania, major anxiety, agitation, insomnia or substance abuse”, so it doesn&#039;t seem very useful in your case. I think you&#039;d better ask your doctor and search for the best medication for you.<br /><br />The most noticeable neurocognitive effect from cannabis is a subtle alteration of short time memory (memory used, for example, to remember and learn new data). This effect depends on cannabis dosage, frequency and individual characteristics (some people are very susceptible to this even with low doses, other don’t feel it even with high dosages). It is reversible after a few weeks of complete abstinence. There are no other “cognitive declines” associated to cannabis use.<br />

He he he!), I was still getting unbearable aches in my legs 2 months later, mainly at night.<br />Withdrawals can be very much affected by stress-&nbsp; and can be alleviated by exercise- you really won&#039;t feel like it but should force yourself, it really makes a difference, but as I said, if you get into a stressful situation, the withdrawals can reappear with a vengeance- I believe this is connected with the fact that you tend to produce too much adrenaline when in withdrawals, which intensifies your bad feelings- if you are exercising, you are burning up the adrenaline rather than it floating round your body!<br />The worst thing you can do after you have started to feel better is to take any opiate as this will take you right back to the beginning again, it can be very tempting to just alleviate the withdrawals for a day for a rest, BUT REFRAIN, honestly, it is the worst thing to do. All you can do is take each day as it comes- it will take time! Also remember that once you have shaken it fully, it&#039;s as if your brain is hard wired to opiates- if you resume your habit, it takes a fraction of the use it would a novice to regain your addiction!<br />Hope some of this is some help, the longer you have been using, the more ingrained your use will get, so get off it earlier than later.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very interesting and constructive information, thanks +1!

There are many other definitions for dependence, but this is the most common.<br />So, addiction potential of substances is not a question of personal opinion, but on data based on neurochemistry, animal models and, over all, studies on population. Some substances as heroin, cocaine, alcohol, tobacco or ketamine have higher potential of addiction than others as MDMA or LSD. (View Table 3 of following link)<br />http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607604644<br />In the concrete case of ketamine, there are enough scientific data to consider that dependence is one of the possible harms associated to its use. This does not mean that it is an unavoidable consequence of every pattern of use, but it is a risk to consider.<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12075653<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11476262<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20214100<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12762561<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23444938<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16869851<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10402883<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8166324<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3247410<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23882190<br /><br />The case of other recreative drugs, as MDMA or LSD (and psychedelics in general) is opposite. Treatment presentations for dependence involving MDMA or LSD as a principal problem drug are rare. They have a low potential for dependence, although they can have other different risks.<br />

				Hi DoctorX,<br /><br />Thanks for giving us this information. It&#039;s extremely valuable. I have one question:<br /><br />My friends and I are planning to take LSD. Most of the group has done it before but myself and my friend a first timers. I take no medication at all and am a fit and healthy person. My best friend is taking 120mg per day of cymbalta for major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. He has smoked a lot of marijuana lately and doesn&#039;t have any problems but is a little concerned about potential side effects LSD might have when combined with cymbalta. What would be your advice?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Boogiesteve.

				Hi DoctorX<br />Really appreciating the time you spend on this forum. Thank you!<br /><br />A friend of mine has had some complications for 4 days now after comsuming MDMA. During the night he did not feel any unusual negative effects, they began the day after and include vomiting every day, almost constant nausea and an upset stomach.<br /><br />It was almost 1½ years since his last encounter with MDMA, so he&#039;s not a heavy user at all. In total he consumed 300-350 mg (but he&#039;s quite big (~100 kg) oral and nasal. Also he drank quite a lot of water/juice. He fell asleep OK. Also worth noting is that he&#039;s used MDMA a number of times before and never had these kind of quite severe complications.<br /><br />His problems are less troubling now after 4 days. But the nausea is still there to some extent. He also says that his sensitivity to alcohol has increased the last years. He gets much more hung over than before.<br /><br />I on the other hand consumed the same MDMA and had no such problems, or other, at all. Neither of us did take more than usual. For me it was a very smooth experience, both during the night and the days after. Further we did not feel it was a stronger experience than usual, or being more warm.<br /><br />Can it be his liver/kidneys? Other causes for this?

Even after a couple of weeks, it will interfere with your recovery, you won&#039;t go back to withdrawing, but the aches in your legs will intensify and the lethargy will most likely worsen for a few days.<br />As for the hard-wiring, it is certainly long-term as in years, probably permanent, though I believe some drugs can reverse this- such as dmt. I think the jury is out for being able to say that definitively- it needs more research. When I say &quot;fraction of use&quot;, I mean fraction of the use that it took you to get addicted to it in the first place, ie, One can generally take heroin for a week or more without getting properly addicted (though if you used for over a week, you could certainly expect to suffer some discomfort after use is stopped!). After you have had years of addiction, and you have fully detoxed, your brain is &quot;hard-wired&quot; and it will only take a few days of use to get your addiction back, ie, if you then stop after the couple of days use, you will get all the cravings back and your body will feel like shit!

It does not mean that you will fall immediately but risks are higher.<br />Think about tobacco as an easier example. Most people dependent of tobacco can’t use it occasionally again once they have quitted. There are exceptions to this rule but, in general, the example is valid for opiates. <br />

A major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder could be a reason enough to warn against LSD use, at least during pharmacological treatment. Effects of psychedelics are somehow more unpredictable than other drugs, but in people with mental health problems the possibilities of negative experiences are higher.

The effects depend on the opiate used, route of administration, pattern of use. Opiates act in different receptors all over the body.

Risks of dependence and adverse effects are always there. Some adverse effects can be managed with medication. Although tolerance to nausea develops in 5-7 days, there are drugs that can be used in this period (haloperidol, ondansetron…). These drugs have their own adverse effects, so they should only be used in clinical settings and with medical advice. Antihistaminics can be useful to control itching and some laxatives (lactulose, polyethilenglycole…) can be used in case of constipation.<br />

				Learning and Cocaine.<br /><br />Doctor -in the news today:<br />Clearnet: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/26/cocaine-decision-making_n_3818400.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Cocaine Rewires Brain, Overrides Decision-Making After Just One Use, Says Study<br />Posted: 08/26/2013 6:10 pm EDT&nbsp; |&nbsp; Updated: 08/27/2013 12:41 pm EDT<br /><br />A new study at UC San Francisco&#039;s Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center has revealed that cocaine may rewire the brain and drastically affect decision-making after just one use.<br /><br />While similar studies have revealed such rewiring in long-term use, the new study&#039;s results are especially alarming, showing that the brain can be altered after one dose.<br /><br />Using live mice, researchers from both UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley studied the frontal lobe -- the area of the brain that handles decision-making and memory -- when cocaine was introduced to the body. After one dose, researchers found substantial growth of new dendritic spines, which are &quot;tiny, twig-like structures that connect neurons and form the nodes of the brain’s circuit wiring.&quot;<br /><br />According to researchers, these new spines rewired the brain to seek cocaine, explaining why the search for the drug might override other priorities in human users.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;ve long known that when you become a repeated drug user, the search for more drugs tends to dominate your attention and decision-making,&quot; Linda Wilbrecht, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at UC Berkeley and the lead author of the study, explained to The Huffington Post. &quot;But it&#039;s quite shocking that these neurological changes happened after just one use.&quot;<br /><br />A series of brain scans exhibited how the spines changed over several days after exposure to cocaine:<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>(relevant pictures in article)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The changes were evident not just in the mice&#039;s brain scans, but in the animals&#039; behavior.<br /><br />Before exposure to cocaine, the mice explored two chambers, differentiated by scent and design, and selected a preference. They were then given cocaine and placed in the chamber they did not prefer. Once put back in the chambers without the drug, the mice overwhelmingly selected the chamber they did not prefer, presumably seeking more cocaine.<br /><br />“The ones that developed the biggest change in preference for the cocaine side were also the ones that grew the most spines,” Wilbrecht told the LA Times.<br /><br />&quot;We have limited real estate in the brain, and this shows how drugs dominate what its users think about,&quot; she told HuffPost. &quot;Drug exposure fuels drug use, potentially at the expense of other priorities.&quot;<br /><br />However, Wilbrecht explained, because our brains regularly grow and lose new spines, she is hopeful.<br /><br />&quot;The frontal cortex regulates decision-making and, as we grow up, we make decisions in an increasingly habitual manner,&quot; she said. &quot;But the brain can rewire, and it is rewired by lots of experiences. So even though it was so much more rewired by the exposure to cocaine than it usually is, it can return to normal. I see this as evidence that recovery is possible.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve had a very positive learning experience with cocaine as an undergraduate. Basically, I was failing an organic chemistry class and needed an A on the final in order to pass the course. I had to memorize a ton of crap and I thought it was impossible. <br />One benefit I had was that all the test material was derived from homework and previous test material. I had the answers to all of these but still would have to memorize an inordinate amount of material to pass.<br /><br />A few days prior to the test I got a little cocaine and resisted the urge to &quot;party&quot; (ie get very high) with it.&nbsp; I started creating a huge list of flash cards for the relevant nomenclature and worked on a Leitner system of 4 boxes. I would go through the list of cards and as I memorized every third card (in the last box) -I would &#039;bump&#039; with cocaine.<br /><br />Memorizing the actual chemical reactions were a bit different. I ended up rote memorizing the steps presented in the homework solution outline; again bumping with cocaine only when I was able to repeat the steps.<br /><br />In the end I passed the class. I don&#039;t remember any of the material long term. I&#039;ve never&nbsp; (quite frankly) had to know anything about organic chemistry in my professional life so there is a lack of context. <br /><br />I&#039;m not looking for validation. Illegal cocaine has many adulterants and funds too many narco-terrorists for validation. (Of course both of these issues would go away if it was legal.) Cocaine affects everyone differently and some people -I feel; just can&#039;t handle their drugs. <br /><br />So what is my question... do you think that this is a placebo effect or do you think that one can cram like this. I don&#039;t deny that I really didn&#039;t keep the knowledge from the class and that it was temporary at best. I have to (once again) study for a test and I&#039;m looking for something to help me.&nbsp; This new test is more contextual than that one and perhaps the subject matter is more boring.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read things about low doses of 2C-D although I&#039;ve never tried it.&nbsp; What are your thoughts on drug aided learning?<br /><br /><br />

				This question is directed at both Doctor X, and also at all DMT users reading the thread.<br /><br />For the past three months the woman described below has continued to experience a range of psychotic delusions, often of a paranoid nature.&nbsp; The psychiatric symptoms are not present constantly -- on some days she seems positive and perfectly normal, while other days I feel like she ought to be physically restrained to prevent harming herself and others; though I lack the medical authority to do so.<br /><br />The patient continues to firmly believe that her one and only DMT experience, three-and-a-half months ago, was THE cause of all her psychological problems, and not merely one element in a complex of interacting psychological factors.<br /><br />Of particular concern is a recent claim she made:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: patient</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have been doing a lot of research and it seems that it is common knowledge among DMT users that you should NOT be sitting on a chair as we were, and that you should not attempt to talk to someone who is tripping, which both you and [another person present during her trip] did.

There are some rare diseases (like temporal epilepsy) that can curse with symptoms like that. I´m not stating that is the cause of the problem, I´m only pointing one possibility and the idea that, in general, auditive alucinations are not typical of panic or anxiety.<br /><br />Of course DMT can trigger a psychotic problem. It is an uncommon situation but, in my experience this can happen more frequently with DMT than other drugs. In general, these episodies&nbsp; occur in pre-morbid, predisposed personalities. The symptoms you describe could indicate this (once more, it is only a possibility, I can´t be 100% sure). Anyway, if she is experiencing psychotic symptoms I think she should search for professional help. DMT psychosis usually have an excelent response to antipsychotics and 2-3 months are enough for most patients. It is important also to avoid DMT and psychedelics in general.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

A sofa will be perfect. I wouldn&#039;t lie down, as this might cause trouble breathing.<br /><br />Do some more reading on the subject. also, there is a docu on detroid from drugs inc (motor city rush or something). there you can see two guys actually smoking DMT and talking about it. just seing that will let you understand why you don&#039;t want to talk to them during the trip. Or even just after coming down. also many videos of people talking about using DMT can be found on YT.<br /><br />doc might supply some rules to you, but there is good info out there too.

Thank you!<br /><br />A friend of mine has had some complications for 4 days now after comsuming MDMA. During the night he did not feel any unusual negative effects, they began the day after and include vomiting every day, almost constant nausea and an upset stomach.<br /><br />It was almost 1½ years since his last encounter with MDMA, so he&#039;s not a heavy user at all. In total he consumed 300-350 mg (but he&#039;s quite big (~100 kg) oral and nasal. Also he drank quite a lot of water/juice. He fell asleep OK. Also worth noting is that he&#039;s used MDMA a number of times before and never had these kind of quite severe complications.<br /><br />His problems are less troubling now after 4 days. But the nausea is still there to some extent. He also says that his sensitivity to alcohol has increased the last years. He gets much more hung over than before.<br /><br />I on the other hand consumed the same MDMA and had no such problems, or other, at all. Neither of us did take more than usual. For me it was a very smooth experience, both during the night and the days after. Further we did not feel it was a stronger experience than usual, or being more warm.<br /><br />Can it be his liver/kidneys? Other causes for this?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I´m sorry I missed to answer your question…I reviewed and I should have done yesterday…sorry <br />Intranasal use of MDMA facilitates apparition of adverse and toxic effects. If nausea/vomiting is the only symptom, ha can take some liquids and there are no other alarm signs (strong abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms, fever, change of skin or eyes colour…), it is probable that symptoms will disappear in following days. A toxic effect on liver is possible, although tipically this happens 1-2 weeks after MDMA and it is very uncommon. Intranasal way also facilitates neurotoxicity and should be avoided. If symptoms don´t improve or appear some different, you should seek for medical advice.<br />

One of the best designed studies on this issue is this:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884611<br />Results show that mixed amphetamine salts have no more than small effect on healthy cognition, although the drug is subjectively viewed as cognitively beneficial.<br />A recent complete review of cognitive enhancers shows that, in healthy people, mental training seems far more effective than drugs to improve memory.<br />http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00283908/64<br />

In a practical case, it is not really important if she believes that her problem has been “caused”, “trigged” or “exaggerated” by DMT use. The thing is, as you say, that a person is suffering from periodic symptomps that seems psychotic in their nature (disorientation, voices shouting in head, anxiety…).n this case a real face to face medical evaluation is important for obvious reasons. Some rare epilepsies look similar to this women&#039;s symptoms. maybe is the consequence of DMT use or maybe not, but it would be important to clarify the diagnosis and use a specific treatment in order to reduce her symptoms and avoid problems (for her and for other people). Some psychotropic drugs, used for weeks or maybe months, are extremely effective for this problems. We don´t know what is the role of DMT in this case, but, as a preventive measure, she should avoid using psychedelics.<br />There is no logical reason not to stay sitting down while using DMT. In fact, to sit down or to lie down are the best way to avoid falls or accidents in a modified state of consciousness. The closer one&#039;s head is to the ground the better since falls are a common risk factor for most drugs. On psychedelics, some people prefer to concentrate in their inner world and avoid communication. For other people is different. But there is no “sacred rule” that prohibits oral communication and this should not trigger any psychotic problem.<br />

				Hi!&nbsp; Thanks for answering all these questions.<br /><br />I asked in another forum, but do you know if fentynal will show up in my drug test at the pain clinic? I was tested when I came in to pick up my regular medications (morphine). I made sure to take some that morning so they would show up, but I was taken by surprise with the U.A., because they usually do that during my appointments, NOT when I am just picking up med slips. Anyway, YEARS ago, the same thing happened at a different clinic, but I hadn&#039;t take any of my regular meds and NOTHING showed up (which can also be an issue).&nbsp; This gives me hope that maybe they won&#039;t catch the fentanyl in my urine analysis?&nbsp; Plus, I would think they would have called by now. I don&#039;t want to be surprised when I go to pick up my med slips on the 12th or when I go to my next appointment in October. <br /><br />Any thoughts?

Of course, opiates have very pleasurable effects (and that is one of the causes of the high addictive potential), but the effects you say (nausea, itching and constipation) are also part of the opioid experience. With regular use there is some tolerance to these effects, and that makes easy to take notice of pleasurable effects. The problem is that the development of tolerance is associated to a higher risk of addiction, and, as you say, it is a dangerous game.<br />There are also individual differences. Some people don´t notice too much these negative physical effects. Logically, they are more prone to have problems with opioids.<br />Use of SSRI should not interfere significantlly with effects, as different cerebral routes are involved.

It is difficult to calculate exactly the risks, but basically it depends on the conditions of conservation. If&nbsp; syringe, water and needles are sterilized and mixture is kept on the fridge (re-heating after as you say) probably &quot;a few hours&quot; does not increase risks too much. Cleanliness of needle is the most important part, so you should use a clean steril new one for injection. Leaving at air conditions syringes is not so important than needle, that should always be new. Waiting &quot;several days&quot; will undoubtedly contaminate&nbsp; the preparation, increasing risk of infectious problems.

MDMA itself does not affect intracraneal pressure. But this is possible in concrete situations. Hyperthermia is the most feared MDMA complication and an adequate hydration is recommended while on MDMA. But drinking too much water can be very dangerous, also. There are described cases of cerebral oedema in people taking excessive amount of water (more than 5-10 liters) under MDMA effects. In this case intracraneal pressure increases and consequences would be even worse in people with previous intracraneal hypertension. So it is enough to drink &quot;normal&quot; amounts of water (or better, isotonic drinkings) to avoid this problem.

				DoctorX thanks for posting and replying often in the thread, your contributions are much appreciated! I apologize if this was already addresses but hard to skim 40 pages quick :(<br /><br />With regard to rectal administration (plugging) of medicine and recreational substances. Is it a generally safe method of administration for long term periods, if its done carefully in moderation? Ive researched this topic and see that some medicine is regularly used this way ie Morphine Sulphate Suppositories. What about pure Amphetamine Sulphate, I know it can be done safely on occasion, but what about extended periods of use (low dose, pure Amp Sulphate dissolved in water solution). Clearly there are risks with insufflation, and we know all about the long term damage coke and amp can cause to sensitive nasal membranes over time. However, many times its the cut or the dry power doing the damage right, rather than a neutral PH saline solution? Im specifically asking about pure Amphetamine Salts, not MDMA or Methamphetamine....<br /><br />Also, Amp Sulphate just how severe is its Hepatotoxicity? This is another point of confusion from my research, but from what I read its relatively mild on the liver, even with chronic use as compared to something like Acetaminophen...<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks for any feedback on this!!

Hyperthermia, hyponatremia and acute hepatotoxicity are the three main causes of MDMA related deaths. Exposition to excessive heat, or combination of heat and humidity, that crushes the body heat-regulating mechanisms can cause dead in combination with MDMA. But in real life this happens very rarely. An article published in British Medical Journal in 2002 showed that deaths related to ecstasy are statistically similar to those produced by aspirin. <br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1123822/<br />It does not mean that MDMA is “ intrinsically safe”, and the user’s behaviour is fundamental to avoid problems. But the “Russian roulette” image does not seem coherent with scientific data. Fortunately, MDMA is safe from a pharmacological point of view in acute administration compared with many legal and illegal drugs.In theory, using isotonic drinks is better than water in order to avoid hyponatremia risks, although the risk of hyponatremia is small drinking reasonable amounts of liquid.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; 4) No comment…&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I recently asked this question to a friend of mine who works as a pediatric neurologist but he was unsure of the answer.<br /><br />Cocaine acts as a reuptake inhibitor of seratonin/dopamine/norepinephrine, meaning that the pharmacodynamics of the drug specifically does not result in increased production of the aforementioned neurotransmitters.&nbsp; Given this, why is there a reported &quot;rush&quot; when users inject/snort the drug?&nbsp; Logically, I&#039;d expect that specifically acts as a reuptake inhibitor would only provide a rush if the production/depletion cycle was quite short.

I apologize if this was already addresses but hard to skim 40 pages quick :(<br /><br />With regard to rectal administration (plugging) of medicine and recreational substances. Is it a generally safe method of administration for long term periods, if its done carefully in moderation? Ive researched this topic and see that some medicine is regularly used this way ie Morphine Sulphate Suppositories. What about pure Amphetamine Sulphate, I know it can be done safely on occasion, but what about extended periods of use (low dose, pure Amp Sulphate dissolved in water solution). Clearly there are risks with insufflation, and we know all about the long term damage coke and amp can cause to sensitive nasal membranes over time. However, many times its the cut or the dry power doing the damage right, rather than a neutral PH saline solution? Im specifically asking about pure Amphetamine Salts, not MDMA or Methamphetamine....<br /><br />Also, Amp Sulphate just how severe is its Hepatotoxicity? This is another point of confusion from my research, but from what I read its relatively mild on the liver, even with chronic use as compared to something like Acetaminophen...<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks for any feedback on this!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In general, rectal administration of drugs implies some changes in its distribution and effects. A higher proportion of the drug reaches brain without passing through liver an it produces a faster onset, shorter peak, and shorter duration than the oral route. The absorption can be conditioned by the presence and quantity of faeces in rectum and colon, but in general dosages should be 10-20% lesser than oral route. In moderate use and using hygienic measures risks should not be different to oral route and there are no communicated cases of serious adverse effects using this route (although it is not very common). Not every drug is suitable for this method, but morphine, cocaine and amphetamine work.<br />Amphetamines can produce hepatotoxicity, in general in a dose-dependent way. It is a possible problem for this substance but not a very common problem in moderate doses/frequencies.

				Hi DoctorX!<br /><br />What you&#039;re offering here is simply amazing, big thanks for this. I&#039;m new here but I&#039;ll definitely donate some coins to you whenever I can.<br /><br />I&#039;ll describe my question in spanish first since is my native language and we can understand each other better. Below I&#039;ll transcribe it to english for the rest.<br /><br />ESPAÑOL:<br />No tengo muchisima experiencia con drogas fuertes. He tomado algunas pastillas de extasis en un pasado (hace 5-6 años y nunca más). Fumo marihuana ocasionalmente, un par de secas por semana. Y en este ultimo tiempo he probado LSD en dos ocasiones (medio &#039;tab&#039; en cada ocasión).<br />Estoy queriendo hacer uso de LSD y MDMA de calidad, pero no unicamente para recreación, si no que estoy buscando una experiencia mas &quot;espiritual&quot; si se quiere, trabajar ciertos aspectos de mi personalidad.<br /><br />Soy un joven de 25 años, saludable, aunque bastante ansioso y un poco obsesivo en general, tiendo a sobre-preocuparme y sobre-pensar todo, me resulta dificil relajarme por completo y &quot;dejarme ir&quot;. He ido al psicologo durante un buen tiempo, no tengo ninguna patología psicologica/psiquiatrica, ni nada por el estilo, simplemente soy ansioso y me cuesta relajarme. Es algo que me gustaría mejorar y creo que este tipo de experiencias (junto con otras como meditar, modificar ciertos habitos de mi vida, etc) me pueden ayudar.<br /><br />Como la salud es algo muy importante para mi estoy buscando que estas experiencias sean lo menos dañinas posibles. He leido algunas guias sobre el MDMA (rollsafe.org me gustó bastante) y LSD. Dado que el acido solo me produjo cierta ansiedad durante el viaje, he leido que combinarlo con MDMA puede ayudar a que uno se relaje y pueda tener un viaje mas ameno.<br /><br />Entonces mis pregunta son:<br />Cual seria la mejor forma en terminos de dosis, tiempos y suplementos de abordar dicha experiencia?<br />Hay algun suplemento de los que recomiendan en rollsafe.org que no deberia ingerir si voy a tomar LSD?<br />Deberia tomar 1 dosis (100-200ug) de LSD + 1 de MDMA (100mg) o por combinarlas deberian ser menos de cada una?<br />Basicamente cualquier información sobre el uso combinado de estas dos sustancias me seria muy útil.<br /><br />Perdón por la extensión de mi pregunta, es la obsesión manifestandose jajaja.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />ENGLISH:<br />I don&#039;t have much experience with &#039;strong&#039; drugs. I&#039;ve taken some exctasy pills in the past (5-6 years ago and never more). I smoke weed ocassionaly, some puffs a week. Lately I&#039;ve taken LSD in two ocassions (half a tab each time).<br />I&#039;m willing to make use of quality LSD + MDMA, not only for recreation, but seeking to have a more &#039;spiritual&#039; experience that allows me to work on some aspects of my personality.<br /><br />I&#039;m a 25-year old healthy male, altough I&#039;m a bit anxious and obsessive in general, I tend to over-think and over-worry a little and it&#039;s hard for me to relax completely, to &quot;let go&quot;. I&#039;ve done therapy for a good time in the past and I don&#039;t have any real psychological/psychiatric pathology, I&#039;m just an anxious and hard-to-relax guy. That&#039;s something I&#039;d want to work on and I think these kind of experiences (along with others like meditation and modifying certain habits of my life) can help me.<br /><br />Because health is something important to me, I want these experiences to be as harmless as possible. I&#039;ve read some MDMA (rollsafe.org is great) and LSD guides. Considering acid alone made me a bit anxious during the trip, I&#039;ve read that combining it with MDMA can help one to relax and have a better trip.<br /><br />So my questions are:<br />Which would be the best way in terms of dose, times and supplements to approach this experience?<br />Is there any of the rollsafe.org recommended supplements that I should take if I&#039;m also doing LSD?<br />Should I take 1 dose (100-200ug) of LSD + 1 of MDMA (100mg) or because I&#039;m combining them I should take less of each?<br />Basically, any information about combining both substances would be helpful.<br /><br />Sorry for the long question, it&#039;s the obsession manifesting itself hahaha.

In fact, we don´t know perfectly how it works. Compared to other human organs (stomach, liver...) knowledge about human consciousness and mechanisms of action of drugs that act on brain is much limited. This is a valid idea for illegal drugs and also for prescription drugs as antidepressives, which mechanisms of actions are based in experimental and animal models.<br />There are different theories about mechanisms of reinforcing drugs, but the most accepted is the circuits of rewards. Explained in an easy way, there are neuronal circuits that produce &quot;pleasure&quot;, and are genetically created to rewards activities that are necessary for survival of the species: drinking , eating or having sex for example. These activities are perceived as pleasurable and repeated by activation of an ancient cerebral circuit present in all vertebrates: the dopaminergic-mesocorticolimbic way. According to this hypothesis some drugs produce &quot;rush&quot; (and are able to cause repeated self-administration and dependence) because they overload this circuits. This hypothesis is based in animal models and have some critics actually, but is the most admitted to explain effects of several drugs.<br />This article explains these concepts in a deep way:<br />http://ciitn.missouri.edu/2007009/group25_drugaddiction.pdf

So most of the information comes from experiences from users. Organic toxicity and risk of severe adverse effects of this combination seems low, as there no exist toxicological reports of this combination. Anyway, it is important to have enough experience with both substances and take all risk-reduction and common sense measures. As both substances act on serotonin receptors and have sinergistic properties, I would recommend reducing dosages of both. It is better to repeat further experiences than being overwhelmed or disconnected.<br /><br />About timing, there are all kind of opinions. I think there is not a unique, right way to do this. For people without experience or anxiety, MDMA first has the adventage to induce a calm state of consciousness that will make easier the LSD. On the other hand experience can be too long and after-effects more noticeable.&nbsp; Using LSD first has the inconvenient that psychedelic effects can be more noticeable than empathogenic, but is much shorter. 1.5-2 hours between substances seems a reasonable timing.<br /><br />Anyway, personal reactions and effects can be difficult to predict and it is important to act with caution, in a safe environment, good company and common sense<br /><br />I recommend you the Spanish forum in www.energycontrol.org, there are several posts about candyflipping and you can ask for more opinions

Impurities of heroin or plastic covering aluminium foil can be a problem, the last can be avoided using the matt surface instead the brilliant one (in commercial aluminium foil for wrapping food) and passing quickly a flame over the surface to burn plastic.<br />A glass pipe (the kind used for meth) can be an alternative, although it is easier to burn and waste heroin.

Anisocoria caused by oral route seems, at least, unusal.

				Non-native English speaker so I didnt notice that.<br />Maybe it has something to do with blood pressure, it gets insanely high with the combination GHB (sometimes combined with amphetamine). Trying to quit now, if this eye thing doesn&#039;t happen again I will not seek a doctor. Thanks for the advice.<br />Will pass you some BTC.

				Dear Dr. X,<br /><br />I wonder if you could tell me if it&#039;s dangerous to take amphetamines while also taking Moclobemide, a reversible MAOI, which only slightly (and reversibly?) inhibits MAO-B, and mostly works on MAO-A. Both would be taken in &quot;therapeutic doses&quot;, ie. no more than 600mg Moclobemide a day and small amounts of amphetamine throughout the day.<br /><br />I know that one should never take amphetamines with &quot;regular&quot; MAOIs and I also know that one should never take the way more serotonergic MDMA with Moclobemide, but from my understanding and the few results a search on Google revealed regular amphetamines should not be a problem, unless taken in huge quantities.<br />Is my understanding correct? Or might there be other problems (as far as I understand the obvious problem would be causing a hypertensive crisis), like increased neurotoxicity if taken together? Or might there even be less neurotoxicity? (A study found that Ritalin could lessen the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine and probably amphetamines as well, even though I have to little knowledge to understand the mechanism behind that process, so I thought maybe this reversible MAOI might even have a similar effect)<br /><br />

There are not reported cases of toxicity or deaths in association with amphetamine. In fact the technical sheet of moclobemide does not mention anytjing about amphetamine although it states that &quot;The pharmacologic action of systemic regimens of sympathomimetic agents may possibly be intensified and prolonged by concurrent treatment with moclobemide.&quot;. That means that, at least in theory, it should be recommendable diminishing doses of amphetamine if using moclobemids simultaneously.<br />If you are using &quot;small amounts of amphetamine&quot; neurotoxicity should not be a problem of importance. Anyway, there are no data to estimate if use of moclobemide could improve or worsen this hypothetical problem

				Hey DoctorX,<br /><br />I tried LSD and MDMA on separate occasion and enjoyed both very much, but candyflipping is just the best thing ever in my experience. I read somewhere that in order to use MDMA safely 2-3 times a year is the max. I follow this rule right now but I wonder if it is safe to do it more often. The best answer I could wish for is like 6 times a year, I&#039;m not going to do it more than that anyway. I also read your post about candyflipping where you state &quot;As both substances act on serotonin receptors and have sinergistic properties, I would recommend reducing dosages of both.&quot; I would like to up my dose of LSD but I don&#039;t think I need that much MDMA. Last time I did it I ended up puking out most of my MDMA and still had the best time ever. So I would like to take between 360-450ug of LSD (3 tabs), how much MDMA can I take safely?<br />I found this combinations so great because I was very euphoric and my thought train was like when I looked one step back in thinking it was too broad to understand, like life, stuff, things etc. Do you know any other drugs or combinations that could set me in such a mindspace and is there like a scientific name for that?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your time, I wouldn&#039;t go see my regular doctor to ask stuff like this, so yeah :)

According to pharmacological mechanisms it is possibly safe with opiates, GHB and, maybe, ketamine, although you should consider the problems of these drugs.<br />Anyway, you should also consider the impact that using drugs can have, not only in a pharmacological point of view (pharmacological interactions), but also in your depression. Some drugs an patterns of use can affect this.

				Hi DoctorX<br /><br />I hope you can answer my question. Last week i took teaspoonful of Phenibut at 8.pm night. I have never used it before, but i hoped relaxing effects. After two hours of consuming i didn&#039;t notice any major effects and decided to go to sleep. In the mirror of bathroom i noticed my pupils were slightly dilated(and i had blur in my vision), reminding me of MDMA. I felt suddenly anxious and after sitting to a chair i shacked or shivered(no temperature feelings) about 10 minutes until it stopped. Since i didn&#039;t feel otherwise much different than usual except &quot;maybe&quot; bit less anxious that usual(i have anxiety disorder) i went to sleep that was extremely disturbing. Not really relaxing as promised and morning i had my usual anxiety.<br />What happened? Did i took too much/little or could it be Phenibut doesn&#039;t fit to me as substance at all? Because i dont know what happened, i haven&#039;t tried it second time so far.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.

There is not a rule for frequency, but, in general, it is recommended not to use it in a regular way. Ann Shulgin said that &quot; I found out, for myself, that using MDMA more often than four times a year was not wise&quot;, but other authors recommend &quot;twice a year&quot; or &quot;no more than once a month&quot;. In general, once a year is better than once a month, and much better than every weekend. I think that 6 times a year can be an adequate pattern of use,if used properly and with caution.<br /><br />450 ug of LSD is a really very heavy dosage. I don&#039;t think it is an adequate dosage for candyflipping, neither for LSD alone. If you have calculated this dosage according to a seller, it is very possible that real dosage is much lesser. In our Drug Testing Service (www.energycontrol.org), most LSD marketed as &quot;150 ug&quot; contain really 40-50 ug when submitted to analytical quantification techniques. If you feel that 3 tabs is good for you, that&#039;s right, but be careful when testing a new batch, as quantity of LSD in different batchs can be very variable. 100 ug of LSD in combination with 80-100 mg of MDMA is enough for a first experience, according to users experiences and communications. These sources say that MDMA + 2C-B can be an interesting combination, both in quality of the experience and pharmacological safety.

This depend on many factors (number of persons that manipulate a determined batch, geographical situation...) but most important is physical characteristics: presentation in powder, liquid or crystal are much easier to adulterate than pills or blotters. Levamisole (an anti-parasit drug) is a common adulterant for cocaine, that, in high dosages can produce dermatological or immunological problems. Aproximatelly 50% of cocaine incautations have some degree of this adulteration. Speed only contains normally 5-15% of amphetamine, the rest is normally caffeine or paracetamol.<br />Other significant adulteration is for LSD: in street market some 25-NBomE blotters are being sold as LSD. MDMA pills are, in general, less adulterated, although in some moments and places they contain different substances as pyperazine derivatives (m-CPP)

Investigation and human experience with this substance is very limited. Supossed properties are reduction of stress and anxiety, improvement of impaired sleep, and potentiation of the effects of tranquilizers, narcotics, and neuroleptics. But data are limited and there is not a well stablished dosage in humans, so &quot;a teaspoon full&quot; is an undetermined dosage that could be not enough or, more probably, a very high dosage. People with anxiety disorders are more prone to have uncommon reactions to some psychotropic drugs. I would recommend to try another substance for improve your sleep, or better, talk with your doctor and search for an adequate pharmacological alternative

				Hey Doc,<br /><br />Not sure if you can help me out here but i have a question regarding sexual health......<br /><br />I have recently received some Viagra, i don&#039;t necessarily need it but i wanted to try and boost my sexual performance.So to try it out, i took half a 100mg pill,waited about half an hour and then started masturbating. However,as i began masturbating, i felt an uncomfortable feeling in my lower penis, not pain as such,just an aching sensation. <br /><br />Is this normal with Viagra usage, is it safe to continue usage? I can still feel a slight aching sensation in my lower penis when i become aroused now. Should i be worried? Would you recommend stopping use of the Viagra?<br /><br />Many thanks Doc, your work here is much appreciated i have to say.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hey Doc,<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a few questions:<br /><br />1. Is it OK to take MDMA or psychedelics whilst on terbinafine? I read that terbinafine inhibits one of the enzymes that metabolizes MDMA, although it&#039;s not clear how important that particular enzyme is or if this would be dangerous.<br /><br />2. Is using noopept or piracetam in combination with MDMA likely to cause harm? From reading it looks like these racetam drugs do not cause any damage and I can&#039;t see how it would make MDMA more harmful.<br /><br />3. In your opinion how probable is it that 2C-x-NBOMe&#039;s cause long-term damage (with normal dosages)? I have so far (perhaps naively) assumed that since it&#039;s pharmacology and short-term effects are so similar to DOx that it probably won&#039;t cause any long term damage (unless you overdose).<br /><br />Thanks very much!

Common adverse effects include headache, flushing, nasal congestion or impaired digestion, but local symptoms in penis are very rare. Sildenafil could cause priapism ( erect penis does not return to its flaccid state) although it is extremely rare. And it is very strange also that a single, ocassional dose, could cause symptoms persisting in time. <br />By the way, in healthy young persons I think 25 mg should be enough as a recreative dosage for most people. Increasing dose causes more adverse effects.

LSD is not associated with disease or damage to any organ or system. Several hundred studies in various animal species have indicated the low toxicity of LSD and long-term effects are not demonstrated. The most common acute adverse effects of LSD are all psychological: anxiety, panic attacks, a prolonged unpleasant experience (or “bad trip”) and psychotic reactions. Transient anxiety or depression after taking LSD have been reported. In general, these reactions are more frequent in people using large doses. So a high dose will have a greater chance to produce these effects but there are not long-term consequences.<br />In the fifties and sixties of last century there were some therapeutic studies with high doses of LSD but they did not show benefits compared to normal doses. Actual protocols dosage is 200 ug.<br />http://www.maps.org/research/lsd/swisslsd/LDA1010707.pdf<br />

				Hi Doc,<br /><br />Many thanks for answers!<br /><br />I have some new questions.<br /><br />1. In one place in this thread you say:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you could try short-acting well-studied psychedelics like psilocibin, 2C-B or 4-Aco-DMT</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is that correct? Erowid states that 4-Aco-DMT is still considered research chemical. [clearnet] http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_acetoxy_dmt/4_acetoxy_dmt.shtml<br /><br />Didn&#039;t you mean 5-Meo-DMT?<br /><br />Also, in other place:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In my opinion, if you are planning to stop a LSD trip because is too long, one alternative is to choose another short-acting psychedelic instead (4-AcO-DMT or even psilocybes).</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, 5-Meo-DMT is much shorter lasting than 4-Aco-DMT, so maybe you meant this one? (I know that it is considered really strong though).<br /><br />2. Benzos and driving -- which of the top four most popular anxyliotic benzos you know to be safest to use when one has to drive? Apart from obvious conclusion that everybody needs to test how affects his or hers body etc. I&#039;m more interested is there are studied contradictions for some of the specific benzos (I&#039;m interested in diazepam, clonazepam, alfoprazolam and lorazepam especially since they are most common and easy to get). I&#039;m talking about occasional use in very stressful situations.<br /><br />Thanks a lot again!<br />

There is a big difference between theorical interactions and pharmacological interactions with clinical relevance. Many of these interactions don&#039;t have importance in real conditions.

Clinical protocols of MDMA research in humans do not exclude people using this drug, so the combination is probably safe.<br /><br />2. There are no reports of toxicity in combinating MDMA and piracetam. By the way, piracetam does not have demonstrated effects in healthy people. Probably there is no impact by combinating two drugs, piracetam seems harmless but useless also.<br /><br />3. There is no way to predict toxicity of drugs according only to its chemical structure. We can take the example of alcohol. Ethanol is the main component of alcoholic drinks. If you quit one single atom of carbon you will have methanol, that is extremely toxic for human optic nerve and can make blind with a toxic dosage. 2C-NBOME family are substances with no human experience and short and long time risks are impredictible. Classic hallucinogens (LSD, psilocibin, DMT...) have a much higher profile of security

Compared to other human organs (stomach, liver...) knowledge about human consciousness and mechanisms of action of drugs that act on brain is much limited. This is a valid idea for illegal drugs and also for prescription drugs as antidepressives, which mechanisms of actions are based in experimental and animal models.<br />There are different theories about mechanisms of reinforcing drugs, but the most accepted is the circuits of rewards. Explained in an easy way, there are neuronal circuits that produce &quot;pleasure&quot;, and are genetically created to rewards activities that are necessary for survival of the species: drinking , eating or having sex for example. These activities are perceived as pleasurable and repeated by activation of an ancient cerebral circuit present in all vertebrates: the dopaminergic-mesocorticolimbic way. According to this hypothesis some drugs produce &quot;rush&quot; (and are able to cause repeated self-administration and dependence) because they overload this circuits. This hypothesis is based in animal models and have some critics actually, but is the most admitted to explain effects of several drugs.<br />This article explains these concepts in a deep way:<br />http://ciitn.missouri.edu/2007009/group25_drugaddiction.pdf<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry it took so long for me to reply, I havn&#039;t been on the forums in quite a while.<br /><br />If I understand your response correctly, you are saying that the rush I referred to is due to the physical process of administering the drug itself, I assume through some positive/negative re-enforcement dynamics.&nbsp; Does this mean that first time users shouldn&#039;t experience an initial rush whatsoever?

				Thanks for answering so quickly :)<br /><br />I&#039;d like to discuss the third point a little though:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1535176#msg1535176">Quote from: DoctorX on September 13, 2013, 11:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.

The receptor affinity/efficacy is also known, so we know that it isn&#039;t really acting anywhere other than at 5HT2A &amp; 5HT2C. If it had never been tested in man, we wouldn&#039;t know if it also acts as a reuptake inhibitor or an allosteric modulator etc. at a totally different site by chance.<br /><br />We do know that it can cause severe vasoconstriction, seizures and death; particularly in higher doses. These effects are very similar to DOB, which shares the property of having a very high efficacy at the 5HT2A receptor when compared to classical psychedelics (LSD/Mescaline/4-HO-DMT etc.). It seems to me to that the safety profiles of drugs such as LSZ and AL-LAD are probably quite similar to that of LSD and 4-HO-DMT, whereas the safety of 25I-NBOMe is probably similar to that of DOB (obviously nothing is definite but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s unreasonable to think this is likely).<br /><br />What I want to know is if a similar line of reasoning can be followed for the long-term effects. I don&#039;t really know what can cause long-term effects, other than highly reactive molecules damaging parts of the cell (e.g. degradation of axons by MDMA when the enzymes to prevent this are at too high of a temperature, or having too much of a reactive chemical in the liver so that there is not enough enzyme to go round). Are there mechanisms by which long-term damage has been caused, but would be totally unpredictable and wouldn&#039;t show significant short-term symptoms?<br /><br />Note: I am in no way trying to argue that RCs are safe, it&#039;s obviously much better to stick to drugs that are known to be safe.

				Hello dear Dr. Fernando:<br /><br />I really consider your post as a priceless help to guide our experiences. So I´d like to discuss my experience to get your opinion. <br /><br />More than a year ago I discovered the help of psychedelics as synergistic tools in the understanding of my vision of cosmos. <br /><br />Along some months, I experimented few but greatly rewarding experiences with Salvia divinorum, ayahuasca, magic mushrooms and HBWR. <br /><br />I considered all these experiences as very insightful and overally pleasant, but at some point I suffered a few weeks of stress at my job and severe familiar problems. These circumstances maybe added to the effects of some of my tryptamine experiences led me to an acute episode of anxiety that made me visit the doctor and start a treatment.<br /><br />At first, my prescription was citalopram an alprazolam... and that was the beginning of the worse week of my life. In fact I use to say I´ve visited paradise (specially one of my ayahuasca experiences) and hell (that terrible week with citalopram).<br /><br />After that, my psychiatrist changed the citalopram for sertaline, and that was the beginning of my recovery. In fact, in less than two months, with the help of my psychiatrist, the treatment and my wife, gradually my point of view of all the problems sorrounding me improved totally (of course, I did not dare to take entheogens during that recovery proccess.)<br /><br />And that brings me to the present day. About one month ago, my psychiatrist considered that I was ready to quit gradually my sertraline treatment (in fact quit taking alprazolam some months ago because I no longer needed it).<br /><br />Some weeks ago, I began cautiously to try Salvia, HBWR, DMT and tentative doses of 25-I-NBOME, allylescaline, LSD and 2-CB.<br /><br />I succeeded to get pleasurable experiences with all of them. Nevertheless There is a significant difference with my old experiences: The visuals are almost absolutely gone! The other effects are still there with my previously known substances, but when took 25-I-NBOME, allylescaline, LSD and 2-CB, did it to experiment the visuals and could not perceive them with any of these.<br /><br />I´m quite sad about this issue. I´m still reducing my sertraline gradually to minimize the bad effects and I have the hope to recover my inner sight as soon as my brain gets to its pre-sertraline state. <br /><br />My question for you is, do you think I´ll recover my ability to feel the visuals?&nbsp; Is there anything you could recommend me to do or to take in order to reopen my eye?<br /><br /><br />Thanks a lot in advance, Dr. <br /><br />Peace.<br />

In that thread we were talking about psychedelics compared to LSD. Experience with 4-AcO-DMT is shorter than LSD but qualitatively similar. 5-MeO-DMT is not active orally, its effects are very short (minutes) and very different to classical psychedelics. That´s why I talked about 2C-B or 4-AcO instead of 5-MeO in that example<br /><br />2.- I have been searching about this issue but I haven´t find anything clear. The general idea is that benzodiacepines impairs driving, and risks of accidents are higher under its effects. Some studies show that risks are higher in ocassional users than in regular, probably by tolerance development. I have only found specific studies on Lorazepam, showing that a dose of 2 mg produces more potent effects than heavy alcohol:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24007754<br />I think in this sense is more important the dosage than the concrete benzo, obviously avoiding those with a more sedative profile. Anyway, benzos and driving are never a very good combination.

				Hello,<br />Two questions further down:<br />A friend&#039;s goldfish has been buying (probably illicitly) morphine for back/sciatica pain. It always had an addictive personality and used opiates for recreational purposes sometimes. Usually it tried to keep the dose to a minimum 25mg-50mg once or twice a day, sometimes three times. And sometimes when the fish has a rough day or does hard exercise that agitates it&#039;s back, it will say F**K it and take a whole 100mg-180mg. It doesn&#039;t like the constipation that goes hand in hand with any sort of prolonged use, nor does it like feeling controlled by a substance.<br /><br />It has decided that it wants to investigate suboxone as a method for discontinuing use in conjunction with physical therapy.<br /><br />So, the goldfish&#039;s questions are:<br />1) Would the 8mg/2mg suboxone seem like a standard dose? How often should this 180 pound fish take said dose? The half life would seem to suggest possibly as infrequently as once every three days... <br /><br />2) Are opiates gentle on the body? The fish has GI issues from NSAIDs and decided liver damage is likely from Tylenol (both used as pain relief at times, and from past abuse of opioid-containing products, and concurrent alcohol consumption). It would appear that since there are opioid receptors throughout the body, it would be a substance that is expected to be consumed, biologically speaking. It also seems to slow down aging and doesn&#039;t harm any organs (so long as one takes time away from it every other day enough to poop). Is this correct? Or what causes physiological damage/what is damaged?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your response, the fish is &quot;itching&quot; to know!<br />You can also PM me.

This is valid for legal prescription drugs and for any other kind of drug. In fact I think to distinguish between “physical” and “psychological” is somehow artificial. Psychological effects of drugs have a neurological correlation and vice versa.<br /><br />“Rush” is uncommon in first experiences with some drugs. Effects of drugs are explained mainly by neuropharmacology but there are also psychological and social factors. Learning processes are important to recognize and process effects of drugs, so first experiences are not necessarily the best. Regular use is more associated with “rush” than occasional experiences. But, for example, administration of intranasal placebo (local anesthesic) to cocaine addicts can produce physical effects (tachycardia, raise of blood pressure) similar to cocaine. So even placebo effect can explain ( a part) of some drug effects. <br />

There is no real break with reality but a false belief that he could hear you talking about him in a bad way. Paranoid reactions are very typical of high dosages of stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines or methamphetamine). If this disappears in a few hours, nothing else is necessary to do. Anyway, some people are prone to this effect and he should know this and be very careful with stimulant dosages. He should think about this once the cocaine effects have passed, analyzing the situation again and realizing that this was not true.<br /><br />If these unreal ideas persist hours or days after cocaine use or if the paranoid ideas are out of reality (for example, you and your friends are aliens that are laughing at him) it should be necessary medical-psychiatric evaluation and specific medication. It is not worthy to try benzos (or worse, opiates) without medical prescription. A paranoid person can be dangerous (for himself or others), as he feels fear. He could feel, for example, that he is going to be poisoned if he is offered medication. So, if the strange ideas do not disappear in a few hours I would recommend medical evaluation

There is no way to predict toxicity of drugs according only to its chemical structure. We can take the example of alcohol. Ethanol is the main component of alcoholic drinks. If you quit one single atom of carbon you will have methanol, that is extremely toxic for human optic nerve and can make blind with a toxic dosage. 2C-NBOME family are substances with no human experience and short and long time risks are impredictible. Classic hallucinogens (LSD, psilocibin, DMT...) have a much higher profile of security<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The example with alcohol is certainly a&nbsp; good demonstration of how the chemical structure doesn&#039;t tell you anything on its own, but I think that we have more information about NBOMes than to just say we have no idea at all about how safe it is.<br />The 25I-NBOMe have been tested in man by what must be a fairly large number of people by now, and it is known that they are not so horribly toxic as to make you drop dead or go blind with high probability. The receptor affinity/efficacy is also known, so we know that it isn&#039;t really acting anywhere other than at 5HT2A &amp; 5HT2C. If it had never been tested in man, we wouldn&#039;t know if it also acts as a reuptake inhibitor or an allosteric modulator etc. at a totally different site by chance.<br /><br />We do know that it can cause severe vasoconstriction, seizures and death; particularly in higher doses. These effects are very similar to DOB, which shares the property of having a very high efficacy at the 5HT2A receptor when compared to classical psychedelics (LSD/Mescaline/4-HO-DMT etc.). It seems to me to that the safety profiles of drugs such as LSZ and AL-LAD are probably quite similar to that of LSD and 4-HO-DMT, whereas the safety of 25I-NBOMe is probably similar to that of DOB (obviously nothing is definite but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s unreasonable to think this is likely).<br /><br />What I want to know is if a similar line of reasoning can be followed for the long-term effects. I don&#039;t really know what can cause long-term effects, other than highly reactive molecules damaging parts of the cell (e.g. degradation of axons by MDMA when the enzymes to prevent this are at too high of a temperature, or having too much of a reactive chemical in the liver so that there is not enough enzyme to go round). Are there mechanisms by which long-term damage has been caused, but would be totally unpredictable and wouldn&#039;t show significant short-term symptoms?<br /><br />Note: I am in no way trying to argue that RCs are safe, it&#039;s obviously much better to stick to drugs that are known to be safe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am sorry but I don’t agree with some of your arguments. I understand your reasoning but I think it is not based in right ideas. Compared with classical recreational drugs, even with drugs like GHB or ketamine, life of 25I-NBOME is very short. The number of persons that have used it is really limited compared with many substances. It was synthetized in 2003 and first reports of recreational use are no longer than two years. Chemical and pharmacological properties are based in incomplete in-vitro and animal studies and there are not enough data to know about its security, neither short and long term. Maybe you are right when you say that it is not “horribly toxic” as it is true that it is being tested by hundreds (maybe thousands) of persons in this moment, persons that are acting as guinea pigs as animal data on 25I-NBOME are scarce.<br /><br />I understand the logical reasoning under your hypothesis about toxicity, but it is a theoretical speculation. It may be right or maybe not. The only way to evaluate long-time effects of drugs is waiting years or decades until these effects appear. This happens to prescription drugs: some of them are retired from market years after commercialization because of unexpected serious adverse long-time effects . There are many recent examples in human pharmacology (clozapine, rosiglitazone, celecoxib, rimonabant…). Knowledge about its chemical structures has not been useful to predict toxicity or long time effects.<br /><br />I think the ketamine example can be illustrative enough. Ketamine has been used in human and animal anesthesia during more than 50 years. And a serious, long time toxic effect (hemorrhagic cisthopaty, ketamine bladder) has only been described in the last 5 years, associated to the exponential growth in its recreational use in the last two decades. This effect is probably associated with intranasal route and very intensive patterns of use, as it has not been described in 50 years of clinical use in animals or humans. And I think it shows the difficulties to predict toxic effects even with relatively known drugs.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don´t like to sound alarmist and maybe I am repetitive advising against new drugs. Everyone should be free to take their decisions but having all the data. And, as you say in your last line, it&#039;s obviously much better to stick to drugs that are known to be safe.<br /><br />

				Hi Doctor,<br /><br />What are the harmful effects, if any, of taking small doses of LSD on a fairly regular basis? I have been experimenting with doses of less that 15 micrograms. I am currently taking 5 micrograms once a week. Is this harmful in any way? Would it be harmful to take 5 micrograms of LSD more frequently, such as 3 times a week?<br /><br />Thank you for your time

It always had an addictive personality and used opiates for recreational purposes sometimes. Usually it tried to keep the dose to a minimum 25mg-50mg once or twice a day, sometimes three times. And sometimes when the fish has a rough day or does hard exercise that agitates it&#039;s back, it will say F**K it and take a whole 100mg-180mg. It doesn&#039;t like the constipation that goes hand in hand with any sort of prolonged use, nor does it like feeling controlled by a substance.<br /><br />It has decided that it wants to investigate suboxone as a method for discontinuing use in conjunction with physical therapy.<br /><br />So, the goldfish&#039;s questions are:<br />1) Would the 8mg/2mg suboxone seem like a standard dose? How often should this 180 pound fish take said dose? The half life would seem to suggest possibly as infrequently as once every three days... <br /><br />2) Are opiates gentle on the body? The fish has GI issues from NSAIDs and decided liver damage is likely from Tylenol (both used as pain relief at times, and from past abuse of opioid-containing products, and concurrent alcohol consumption). It would appear that since there are opioid receptors throughout the body, it would be a substance that is expected to be consumed, biologically speaking. It also seems to slow down aging and doesn&#039;t harm any organs (so long as one takes time away from it every other day enough to poop). Is this correct? Or what causes physiological damage/what is damaged?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your response, the fish is &quot;itching&quot; to know!<br />You can also PM me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1) First of all, I would not recommend the fish to do this on his own. Guidelines for detoxification from heroin using subuxone are clear, but it is not so easy using oral morphine. I think it would be easier just tappering down oral morphine dosage. If pain is being a problem, it should be necessary controlling it with an adequate medication, otherwise pain would be an added problem to achieve detoxification.<br /><br />Anyway, in order to start a detoxification from opiates, subuxone 2 mg/ 0.5 mg is more adequate than subuxone 8/2. First dosage should be used when first signs of abstinence appear. Initial induction dosage (first day of treatment) should nbe in the rank of 2/0.5 ( 1 pill) to 8/2 mg (4 pills). In the following days dosage should be adjusted to a maximum of 24/6 mg, dependind on physical and psychological symptoms, and then tappering down during several weeks (rate depend on initial dosage and clinical symptoms).<br /><br />2) Opiate toxicity for human body is very low. The main problems are tolerance, dependence, psychological symptoms and constipation. But opiates are not adequate for all kinds of pain. In fact, there are much better options for back pain/ciatic than morphine.

Quitting morphine cold turkey doesn&#039;t cause withdrawls that are super intense, just a day or two of feeling a little lame. But then the pain comes back and makes all 24 hours of the day excruciating. So, an illicit use of this substance has allowed sleep and normal ADL&#039;s. There is definitely an addiction issue beyond physical symptoms arising from the euphoria that morphine, oxy, H, or any opiate provides. <br /><br />1)So, would the suboxone reduce the cravings for opiates as the pain issue heals (hopefully) through physical therapy and an epidural steroid? And, would it help to mitigate the pain in the meantime?<br /><br />2)You said that morphine is not the most effective drug for this type of pain. What is more effective/better suited for lumbar issues/sciatica? Marijuana actually helps as much or more than morphine sometimes, or, it can complete the relief when MS isn&#039;t taking it all away.<br /><br />The info is very useful! Thank you very much!

				I have had major depression and anxiety for years... I&#039;ve tried every med available for these conditions ( just started prestiq last week )<br />Several months ago, hemroid surgery left me with a stricture (found by colonoscopy). <br />After taking 10 mg Percocet for a few weeks, I realized that my depression, panic, anxiety, was greatly reduced.

A few days of that, and I&#039;m back to percs. What is the real reason that treating depression, anxiety, fymbromyelga, etc. with opiates is such a huge no-no?

				Ive read that anti-oxidants can be used to combat MDMA neurotoxicity and reduce most of the damage it causes to the human brain. Specifically, I read that Alpha Lipoic Acid is one of the best anti-oxidants for such a thing because it helps combat free radicals. I recently took 90mg MDMA and 30mg MDA at the same time. An hour before taking it I took: 1g Vitamin C, 200mg ALA, and 100mg Co-Enzyme Q10. During the experience I also took 200mg of ALA every hour for 6 hours until I had finally consumed around 1.5g of it by the end. I also took some before going to bed, and in the morning the next day when I woke up. The next day, my insides has essentially liquified from all the ALA im assuming and I had extreme diarrhea for a couple hours but felt fine other then that.<br /><br />The next few days my mood was actually lifted and I felt fantastic. My question is: Is it necessary to take a fair dose of Anti-Oxidants (such as 200mg of ALA) every hour to fully combat neuro-toxicity from free radicals, or is one dose before taking MDMA, during it, and after it ok? As much as I would like to think the constant redosing of anti-oxidants helped, the &quot;shitty&quot; experience the next day was really a downside and would not make me want to do that on every trip.<br /><br />Thanks! 8)

Guidelines for detoxification from heroin using subuxone are clear, but it is not so easy using oral morphine. I think it would be easier just tappering down oral morphine dosage. If pain is being a problem, it should be necessary controlling it with an adequate medication, otherwise pain would be an added problem to achieve detoxification.<br /><br />Anyway, in order to start a detoxification from opiates, subuxone 2 mg/ 0.5 mg is more adequate than subuxone 8/2. First dosage should be used when first signs of abstinence appear. Initial induction dosage (first day of treatment) should nbe in the rank of 2/0.5 ( 1 pill) to 8/2 mg (4 pills). In the following days dosage should be adjusted to a maximum of 24/6 mg, dependind on physical and psychological symptoms, and then tappering down during several weeks (rate depend on initial dosage and clinical symptoms).<br /><br />2) Opiate toxicity for human body is very low. The main problems are tolerance, dependence, psychological symptoms and constipation. But opiates are not adequate for all kinds of pain. In fact, there are much better options for back pain/ciatic than morphine.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for the response!<br /><br />Pain has definitely been a problem for relapse because when no potent substance is used, it cannot perform exercise such as running or picking up dirty clothing from the floor. Quitting morphine cold turkey doesn&#039;t cause withdrawls that are super intense, just a day or two of feeling a little lame. But then the pain comes back and makes all 24 hours of the day excruciating. So, an illicit use of this substance has allowed sleep and normal ADL&#039;s. There is definitely an addiction issue beyond physical symptoms arising from the euphoria that morphine, oxy, H, or any opiate provides. <br /><br />1)So, would the suboxone reduce the cravings for opiates as the pain issue heals (hopefully) through physical therapy and an epidural steroid? And, would it help to mitigate the pain in the meantime?<br /><br />2)You said that morphine is not the most effective drug for this type of pain. What is more effective/better suited for lumbar issues/sciatica? Marijuana actually helps as much or more than morphine sometimes, or, it can complete the relief when MS isn&#039;t taking it all away.<br /><br />The info is very useful! Thank you very much!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1) Yes, subuxone, if used properly, will reduce the craving for opiates. But I don´t think it will have a significant impact on pain<br /><br />2) I think you should ask this to your doctor. Prescription is much more than giving a drug for each problem. It would be necessary to know exactly what is your &quot;lumbar issue&quot;, what image tests have been performed and the results, what drugs have you used previously, possible interactions and contraindications....There can be used different drugs: Non-steroidal-antiinflamatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aceclofenac...), analgesics (metamizole), steroids, gabapentin, tryciclic antidepressives...can be different options dependind on the characteristics of patient. It is not that I don´t want to give you the information, but I think that information through Internet is only valid and adequate to a limit, and sometimes (as your case) is necessary a personalized professional evaluation.

I&#039;ve tried every med available for these conditions ( just started prestiq last week )<br />Several months ago, hemroid surgery left me with a stricture (found by colonoscopy). <br />After taking 10 mg Percocet for a few weeks, I realized that my depression, panic, anxiety, was greatly reduced. I have quit taking opiates for a few days, on several occasions - I start with a nervous breakdown and about 4 days later just feel back to my &quot;normal&quot; levels of depression and anxiety. A few days of that, and I&#039;m back to percs. What is the real reason that treating depression, anxiety, fymbromyelga, etc. with opiates is such a huge no-no? Aside from the obvious media and government hype about how awful they are. I&#039;m thinking long-term, it is safer than alcohol in several respects; I have a doctor in the family who has almost eluded such? <br />Also have a private question I will PM. <br /><br />Thank you,<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Opiates have antidepressant and antipsychotic properties. There is enough evidence about this, although opiates are not usually prescribed for this. There are drugs that, at least in theory, are pharmacologically safer, less toxic, less addictive and with less adverse effects than opiates. Of course there are also other factors, and moral prejudices against opiates are one of them. Even with pain management, the principal medical indication for opiates, prescription is much lower than it should be due to these prejudices and this has been shown in different studies.<br /><br />There is some evidence that oxicodone can be useful in very severe depressions:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10588427<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22901349<br />http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=173886#R15612BCFGBDJI<br />http://www.opioids.com/antidepressant/opiates.html<br /><br />This does not mean that is the best drug, or indicated for every kind of depression. I can&#039;t even say if it is adequate for you or not. But there is a logic in the fact your symptoms improve with Percocet. You should discuss this with your physician, and search for the best option for you, valorating all pros and cons.

Specifically, I read that Alpha Lipoic Acid is one of the best anti-oxidants for such a thing because it helps combat free radicals. I recently took 90mg MDMA and 30mg MDA at the same time. An hour before taking it I took: 1g Vitamin C, 200mg ALA, and 100mg Co-Enzyme Q10. During the experience I also took 200mg of ALA every hour for 6 hours until I had finally consumed around 1.5g of it by the end. I also took some before going to bed, and in the morning the next day when I woke up. The next day, my insides has essentially liquified from all the ALA im assuming and I had extreme diarrhea for a couple hours but felt fine other then that.<br /><br />The next few days my mood was actually lifted and I felt fantastic. My question is: Is it necessary to take a fair dose of Anti-Oxidants (such as 200mg of ALA) every hour to fully combat neuro-toxicity from free radicals, or is one dose before taking MDMA, during it, and after it ok? As much as I would like to think the constant redosing of anti-oxidants helped, the &quot;shitty&quot; experience the next day was really a downside and would not make me want to do that on every trip.<br /><br />Thanks! 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />you forgot 5-htp ;) for serotonine, and green tea extract as anti-oxidant<br /><br />btw, while waiting for DoctorX answer, you can find some info on ***CLEARNET*** rollsafe.org, and other sites too.

				Hi Doctor, hope your well (like if your not, were all going to wonder how good a doc you are!)<br /><br />So, my thing is the usual colds going around. I always say the best palative for a cold is to eat 2 grams of hash and stay inside, keep warm but wrap up and walk a few miles, likely before eating the 2 or 1 gram of hash.<br /><br />Smoking hash will obviously not help a cold or flu, so eating it, I would argue that it is a good thing to do.<br /><br />However, not every likes cannabis so this &#039;cure&#039; or palative for a common cold is for cannabis lovers only.<br /><br />2 grams for hardened tokers<br />1 gram for little tokers<br />Half gram for non tokers.<br /><br />Don&#039;t drive for 24 hr after you ingest.<br /><br />Watch some nice DVDs or something.<br /><br />Do take that walk!<br /><br />I would also like to say to everyone - please do walk, if you can. Walking is THE best preventative medicine (unless you live in Compton or some bad area)<br /><br />Thanks doc!<br /><br />In advance!

Ive read several reports saying 5-htp before or during the roll changes it somewhat which I would like to avoid. As I said, I took ALA/Vit C/COQ10 instead of gren tea extract. It doesn&#039;t matter what anti-oxidant you take in my experience, as long as you take enough to fight all free radicals swimming around in your brain.<br /><br />The idea for this experiment I did, (with taking 200mg of ALA every hour during the roll) I actually got from RollSafe, which is why I asked the doctor here. I followed the rollsafe guidelines and was not expecting the after-effects the next morning :P<br /><br />My question was more regarding the prevention of damage through anti-oxidants and how long the anti-oxidants effects will last before they start becoming less effective and free radicals start forming again. I appreciate your advice though

Specifically, I read that Alpha Lipoic Acid is one of the best anti-oxidants for such a thing because it helps combat free radicals. I recently took 90mg MDMA and 30mg MDA at the same time. An hour before taking it I took: 1g Vitamin C, 200mg ALA, and 100mg Co-Enzyme Q10. During the experience I also took 200mg of ALA every hour for 6 hours until I had finally consumed around 1.5g of it by the end. I also took some before going to bed, and in the morning the next day when I woke up. The next day, my insides has essentially liquified from all the ALA im assuming and I had extreme diarrhea for a couple hours but felt fine other then that.<br /><br />The next few days my mood was actually lifted and I felt fantastic. My question is: Is it necessary to take a fair dose of Anti-Oxidants (such as 200mg of ALA) every hour to fully combat neuro-toxicity from free radicals, or is one dose before taking MDMA, during it, and after it ok? As much as I would like to think the constant redosing of anti-oxidants helped, the &quot;shitty&quot; experience the next day was really a downside and would not make me want to do that on every trip.<br /><br />Thanks! 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Some aspects of this issue have been previously discussed in the thread. Here are a bit of information about neurotoxicity of MDMA, after-effects and the role of supplements:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.75<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.90<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1166735;topicseen#msg1166735<br /><br />The question is, none of the pre-load or post-load guidances are based on scientific research in humans because these studies do not exist. Studies with mega-doses of MDMA and mega-doses neuroprotective agents are performed in order to understand the mechanisms of neurotoxicity. But doses used, both of MDMA and neuroprotectives are never extrapolable to humans.<br />The main study on alpha-lipoic acid and MDMA is this:<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619665<br /><br />They used 20 mg/kg of MDMA and 100 mg/kg of ALA twice a day injected to achieve the neuroprotective effect. So you (supposing a weight of 70 kg)&nbsp; would have to inject 1400 mg of MDMA and 7 gr of ALA to do this. Please don&#039;t try because you will definetly die, as the rats do.<br /><br />There is no evidence that ocassional, moderate dosages of MDMA produce neurotoxicity in humans. There is no evidence of efficace for neuroprotective to diminish neurotoxicity neither for after-effects. 30-50% of the effect of any pain-killer is explained by placebo effect, so the role of ALA (and any other supplement) is unknown, and probably useless. Using MDMA moderately and in controlled settings is the best way to avoid this problems. All the rest is probably harmless but useless too.

				DoctorX,<br /><br />Do you think the pain killing properties of marijuana might cause lack of response in the affected individual&#039;s&nbsp; pain receptors which could result in an avoidable injury? For example, a runner who feels no pain, or less pain than normal, causes damage to his health by running too much while high.&nbsp; I suppose the same thing could happen with any pain killing drug if it does happen at all.&nbsp; Too much happiness.<br /><br />Police and public health officials report certain drugs seem to cause some users to be unstoppable or react in extremely aggressive manner. We read reports of how someone was hyped up on something and it took six people to subdue them.&nbsp; Can you comment on this reported aggressive reaction some users have to some drugs?&nbsp; <br /><br />Why is it that whenever there is a report of violence associated with drug purchases gone bad, it is always a fact that drugs, or the personal craving for drugs among loser criminal types, caused the senseless violence?&nbsp; Poverty has no blame for these wanton evil acts.&nbsp; This may require the rest of my life to figure out, but at least now the drugs are safer to buy, here, on the dark web.&nbsp; Governments have defacto become drug distribution networks. Ironic isn&#039;t it? <br /><br />By the way Doc didn&#039;t mean to dis you bout the x instead of X.&nbsp; What is your preference anyway?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Clean<br />

				DoctorX, let me first say you&#039;re awesome for doing this. :)<br /><br />I have a question about tolerance. First some short history:<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken pseudoefedrine. The first day (60mg) was awesome. The second day (60mg) I had some clear effects, but my thoughts also quickly became dark. Signs I believe I had depleted my dopamine. When I take it now, all it does is clear up my sinuses so I&#039;m not taking it anymore (unless I have a cold). The first two days, pseudoefedrine took my visual snow: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow away.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken caffeine. 200-300mg does absolutely nothing for me when I had a good night sleep, so I guess my adenosine levels are just fine. At 600mg (yes I know I am insane) I got some decent effect, but it was only once I took 800mg (I know, it&#039;s a lot) that I really felt great. At 800mg it also took my visual snow away. Due to side effects, I lowered the dose again and tapered off. After I had been clean for a week (apart from some very low amounts in milk chocolate), I once again took 800mg. This time I had far fewer side effects, but the positive effects were not as pronounced either. My visual snow did not go away this time.<br /><br />Apart from some very low amounts in milk chocolate, I stopped using caffeine.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m on modafinil. A fairly low dose of just 100mg/day. I really liked the first few days. But in less than a week, I feel like the effects are not as strong anymore. I&#039;m afraid once again I might be developing tolerance.<br /><br />This madness has to stop. Not using medication is not an option for me (believe me, I would if I could). I just have to stop developing tolerance.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read about anti-tolerance drugs, NMDA-antagonists like dextromethorphan or (prescription) memantine. Would this be the way to go?

				Dr. X,<br /><br />Now that was interesting. Yesterday I had what I&#039;d guess was a panic attack (high BP (up to 173/100 when I was able to measure), high HR, scared shitless, sweating, chest pain, and so on). I&#039;m not sure what exactly caused it, but I guess it was dosing up amphetamine too fast in only a few days (a week or so) with Moclobemide being present, and maybe the (not related to both drugs) little sleep I had the last weeks.<br />Just to be specific: I was at 3x8mg d/l-amphetamine throughout the day, and I only had slightest if any changes in BP throughout the day, while also taking 600mg moclobemide as prescribed. The amphetamine worked wonders for my adhd even after the in that case undesired euphoria disappeared, and only in the afternoon I felt a bit &quot;wired&quot;. The panic attack happened in the evening, probably three or four hours or so after the last dose.<br />Of course I stopped taking any amphetamine the next day and will probably only and carefully try it again when I get my hands on some dextroamphetamine, because without the l-amphetamin it should probably have less effect on noradrenaline and so cause less bp issues or anxiety, as far as I know.<br /><br />So now my question is: If something like that happened again, could/should I take a benzo as it seems to be recommended for &quot;general&quot; amphetamine overdoses and/or rebound, or would the combination of moclobemide, amphetamine and a benzo do bad things? From what I know moclobemide only slows the breakdown of the benzos and one should take a smaller dose.<br />And if it would be the right option in an situation like that, is there any recommended benzo for that purpose? I might be able to get some sublingual lorazepam, would that be OK? And at which dose?<br /><br />Thanks again for your work, by the way, I guess I should get some coin and send it to you asap. :)

I&#039;ve tried every med available for these conditions ( just started prestiq last week )<br />Several months ago, hemroid surgery left me with a stricture (found by colonoscopy). <br />After taking 10 mg Percocet for a few weeks, I realized that my depression, panic, anxiety, was greatly reduced. I have quit taking opiates for a few days, on several occasions - I start with a nervous breakdown and about 4 days later just feel back to my &quot;normal&quot; levels of depression and anxiety. A few days of that, and I&#039;m back to percs. What is the real reason that treating depression, anxiety, fymbromyelga, etc. with opiates is such a huge no-no? Aside from the obvious media and government hype about how awful they are. I&#039;m thinking long-term, it is safer than alcohol in several respects; I have a doctor in the family who has almost eluded such? <br />Also have a private question I will PM. <br /><br />Thank you,<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Opiates have antidepressant and antipsychotic properties. There is enough evidence about this, although opiates are not usually prescribed for this. There are drugs that, at least in theory, are pharmacologically safer, less toxic, less addictive and with less adverse effects than opiates. Of course there are also other factors, and moral prejudices against opiates are one of them. Even with pain management, the principal medical indication for opiates, prescription is much lower than it should be due to these prejudices and this has been shown in different studies.<br /><br />There is some evidence that oxicodone can be useful in very severe depressions:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10588427<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22901349<br />http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=173886#R15612BCFGBDJI<br />http://www.opioids.com/antidepressant/opiates.html<br /><br />This does not mean that is the best drug, or indicated for every kind of depression. I can&#039;t even say if it is adequate for you or not. But there is a logic in the fact your symptoms improve with Percocet. You should discuss this with your physician, and search for the best option for you, valorating all pros and cons.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Doctor<br /><br />Thanks very much for all the information in these Q&amp;A it&#039;s very helpful.<br /><br />A bit about my history - I have used caffeine regularly since 14-15y.o. and am a daily &#039;addict&#039;<br />- Alcohol regularly since 18y.o.<br />- Cannabis since 19y.o. (irregular)<br />- Codeine since 19.y.o (rarely)<br />Used to be addicted to tobacco but have quit for over a year now.<br />- Have used MDMA a few times.<br />- Maybe couple lines of ritalin.<br /><br />I am in my early twenties still but am having trouble getting motivated. There is a history of alcohol addiction in the family and unfortunately I find it quite enjoyable myself. I have managed to give it up entirely in the past for 1-2 months at a time. Cannabis I can go without easily for six months at a time in fact, I&#039;ve only smoked a few times in about the last 8 months.<br /><br />What I&#039;m wondering is if genetics may have led me down paths of addiction? My father is a daily drinker, only stopped for the week or so when hospitalised for 3 heart attacks now in the past few years.<br /><br />Also my thoughts always seem so constant like I just can&#039;t stop worrying about things? I&#039;ve managed to reduce my alcohol consumption to just one or two drinks per week; Haven&#039;t binged since 3 months ago.<br />I talk to people that say in the days after using MDMA that they feel &#039;scattered&#039; or down. For me it is just &quot;back to normal feeling&quot; definitely not happy the week after but it&#039;s still like my thoughts are always leaving me to be a &quot;dreamer&quot;<br /><br />These days I am regularly sober except for caffeine use.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that after 3 years of university study I quit because of a lack of motivation. I also seem very indecisive all the time. Alcohol and cannabis are probably two things that I enjoy.<br /><br />In fact since my reduced consumption of substances lately I have become even more withdrawn socially then when I used to go out partying with friends; or just generally being chatty. Actually that&#039;s what I miss about smoking cigarettes.<br /><br />I know this is hard for you to answer as you have said before it depends on the individual, but in your professional opinion would it be better to treat depression/anxiety symptoms (or just general malaise) with drugs/pharmaceuticals? Or would abstinence from all substances be better?<br /><br /><br />I am also asking as I was concerned when my brother went onto antidepressants - notably &quot;Pristiq&quot; He didn&#039;t even last two months and went off them because they were making him feel so bad. Actually he is a almost daily pot smoker and finds that better.<br />

It is not the same the kind of pain produced by a sprained ankle (inflammatory pain), pain produced by constipation (visceral pain) or herpes (neuropathic pain). In fact cannabis is more effective for neuropathic pain than for other kind of pain. And all analgesic medications don’t just make disappear completely painful sensations, but only diminish it.<br />Drugs do not “cause” these reactions, but increase previous characteristics of personality. Violent behaviour is more frequent after stimulant use but not everybody become aggressive after taking these drugs. Alcohol is other drug frequently related to aggressive behaviour. <br />I prefer X rather than x ;) <br />

Main risk is sedation and increasing risk of crashing but it is not the same flunitrazepam 2 mg (would be very risky) than 1.5 bromazepam, for example (probably much safer). To be honest, doctors forget very frequently warning about this to patients when prescribing benzos. One possible option would be a beta-blocker (propranolol). This drug affect only on the somatic-organic component of anxiety leaving mental functions unaffected. Propanolol is contraindicated in persons with asthma and some arterial problems.<br />In clinical use of opiates, haloperidol and chlorpromazine are elective drugs to treat nausea associated to opiates. Adverse and psychoactive effects of these drugs make them unadequate for most recreative users, I think adverse effects should be greater than desired effects, but in theory they should be the most effective drugs. Serotonin antagonists (ondansetron) are effective but very expensive. Metoclopramide and antihistaminics could be adequate too, but it also has a sedative effect. Effect of thietylperazinum is probably weak but risk of interactions is very low. <br />There is a lot of experience with opiates, as they are used in medicine. But advice of 4-AcO is much difficult, as there is no clinical experience. Combination with the previously mentioned drugs probably affect to the psychedelic experience (except, maybe, antihistaminics)<br />3.- No clinical guide says that opiates prescription or dosage should be modified in people using nicotine or caffeine so, in general, risks, effects and problems are similar to no users.<br />4.- Lorazepam is more easily sublingual-absorbed than other benzos. Time to peak is much shorter for lorazepam used by sublingual than oral route, so&nbsp; that is why it should be a good option.<br />

I just have to stop developing tolerance.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read about anti-tolerance drugs, NMDA-antagonists like dextromethorphan or (prescription) memantine. Would this be the way to go?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Tolerance is a intrinsic characteristic of some drugs; depending on the drug it takes more or less time to develop. There is no significant tolerance in two days to pseudoefedrine, the change of effects you explain in two days should be explained by other factors (probably, psychological predisposition) but not for pharmacological tolerance. In clinical use of modafinil there is no need to increase the dosage after a week of use. It is not a question of pharmacological tolerance, it is probably the way you are using the drug that makes increase dosage.<br />It is not clear in your message why do you need to use medication. If your problem is visual snow, in general use of psychoactives (except some benzos like clonazepam) increases symptoms. If you are suffering other condition it seems that your&nbsp; auto-medication with stimulants is not helping, so you may consider asking a doctor for your best treatment option.<br />Dextromethorphan or memantine are not useful for diminishing tolerance in clinical, real-life situations.<br />

Yesterday I had what I&#039;d guess was a panic attack (high BP (up to 173/100 when I was able to measure), high HR, scared shitless, sweating, chest pain, and so on). I&#039;m not sure what exactly caused it, but I guess it was dosing up amphetamine too fast in only a few days (a week or so) with Moclobemide being present, and maybe the (not related to both drugs) little sleep I had the last weeks.<br />Just to be specific: I was at 3x8mg d/l-amphetamine throughout the day, and I only had slightest if any changes in BP throughout the day, while also taking 600mg moclobemide as prescribed. The amphetamine worked wonders for my adhd even after the in that case undesired euphoria disappeared, and only in the afternoon I felt a bit &quot;wired&quot;. The panic attack happened in the evening, probably three or four hours or so after the last dose.<br />Of course I stopped taking any amphetamine the next day and will probably only and carefully try it again when I get my hands on some dextroamphetamine, because without the l-amphetamin it should probably have less effect on noradrenaline and so cause less bp issues or anxiety, as far as I know.<br /><br />So now my question is: If something like that happened again, could/should I take a benzo as it seems to be recommended for &quot;general&quot; amphetamine overdoses and/or rebound, or would the combination of moclobemide, amphetamine and a benzo do bad things? From what I know moclobemide only slows the breakdown of the benzos and one should take a smaller dose.<br />And if it would be the right option in an situation like that, is there any recommended benzo for that purpose? I might be able to get some sublingual lorazepam, would that be OK? And at which dose?<br /><br />Thanks again for your work, by the way, I guess I should get some coin and send it to you asap. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not sure that moclobemide and amphetamine combination is a good idea. Moclobemide is much safer than other MAOIs but combination with amphetamine should be done with caution. It is possible (but not sure) that combination of both substances has caused your problem. It is possible that d-amphetamine has fewer effects, but I do not recommend combining with moclobemide, anyway.<br /><br />Combination of benzos with moclobemide and amphetamine is probably safe. Lorazepam 1 mg sublingual is useful for panic attacks. But we can`t be sure that your problem was this. So if you are suffering again it should be prudent to confirm diagnosis before using benzos.<br />

				Thanks a lot, once more.<br /><br />I have to admit I&#039;m a bit reluctant not to try d-amph and moclobemide, because I neither want to give up the moclobemide (since it is the first thing to help with my chronic depression) nor want to leave the adhd untreated. But I&#039;ll be very careful indeed, even more careful than before, because that was not a situation I&#039;t like to be in again.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll be able to have all this done and surveilled by a doctor, but I doubt it. It&#039;s hard enough to acually find one who&#039;d be willing to prescribe (d-)amphetamine, much less one who&#039;d prescribe it with moclobemide and/or give advice on benzos without thinking I&#039;m only &quot;in it for the drugs&quot;.<br /><br />I actually tried to have a doctor check me out when I felt able to do anything again. But since I was better once I had arrived there I was just sent home and told to &quot;relax&quot;.

It is not the same a runner`s pain produced by a sprained ankle (inflammatory pain), pain produced by constipation (visceral pain) or pain as herpes (neuropathic pain). In fact cannabis is more effective for neuropathic pain than for other kind of pain. And all analgesic medications don’t just make disappear completely painful sensations, but only diminish it.<br />Drugs do not “cause” these reactions, but increase pre-existing characteristics of personality. Violent behaviour is more frequent after stimulant use but not everybody become aggressive after taking these drugs. Alcohol is another drug frequently related to aggressive behaviour. <br />I prefer X rather than x ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I&#039;ve tried every med available for these conditions ( just started prestiq last week )<br />Several months ago, hemroid surgery left me with a stricture (found by colonoscopy). <br />After taking 10 mg Percocet for a few weeks, I realized that my depression, panic, anxiety, was greatly reduced. I have quit taking opiates for a few days, on several occasions - I start with a nervous breakdown and about 4 days later just feel back to my &quot;normal&quot; levels of depression and anxiety. A few days of that, and I&#039;m back to percs. What is the real reason that treating depression, anxiety, fymbromyelga, etc. with opiates is such a huge no-no? Aside from the obvious media and government hype about how awful they are. I&#039;m thinking long-term, it is safer than alcohol in several respects; I have a doctor in the family who has almost eluded such? <br />Also have a private question I will PM. <br /><br />Thank you,<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Opiates have antidepressant and antipsychotic properties. There is enough evidence about this, although opiates are not usually prescribed for this. There are drugs that, at least in theory, are pharmacologically safer, less toxic, less addictive and with less adverse effects than opiates. Of course there are also other factors, and moral prejudices against opiates are one of them. Even with pain management, the principal medical indication for opiates, prescription is much lower than it should be due to these prejudices and this has been shown in different studies.<br /><br />There is some evidence that oxicodone can be useful in very severe depressions:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10588427<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22901349<br />http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=173886#R15612BCFGBDJI<br />http://www.opioids.com/antidepressant/opiates.html<br /><br />This does not mean that is the best drug, or indicated for every kind of depression. I can&#039;t even say if it is adequate for you or not. But there is a logic in the fact your symptoms improve with Percocet. You should discuss this with your physician, and search for the best option for you, valorating all pros and cons.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Doctor<br /><br />Thanks very much for all the information in these Q&amp;A it&#039;s very helpful.<br /><br />A bit about my history - I have used caffeine regularly since 14-15y.o. and am a daily &#039;addict&#039;<br />- Alcohol regularly since 18y.o.<br />- Cannabis since 19y.o. (irregular)<br />- Codeine since 19.y.o (rarely)<br />Used to be addicted to tobacco but have quit for over a year now.<br />- Have used MDMA a few times.<br />- Maybe couple lines of ritalin.<br /><br />I am in my early twenties still but am having trouble getting motivated. There is a history of alcohol addiction in the family and unfortunately I find it quite enjoyable myself. I have managed to give it up entirely in the past for 1-2 months at a time. Cannabis I can go without easily for six months at a time in fact, I&#039;ve only smoked a few times in about the last 8 months.<br /><br />What I&#039;m wondering is if genetics may have led me down paths of addiction? My father is a daily drinker, only stopped for the week or so when hospitalised for 3 heart attacks now in the past few years.<br /><br />Also my thoughts always seem so constant like I just can&#039;t stop worrying about things? I&#039;ve managed to reduce my alcohol consumption to just one or two drinks per week; Haven&#039;t binged since 3 months ago.<br />I talk to people that say in the days after using MDMA that they feel &#039;scattered&#039; or down. For me it is just &quot;back to normal feeling&quot; definitely not happy the week after but it&#039;s still like my thoughts are always leaving me to be a &quot;dreamer&quot;<br /><br />These days I am regularly sober except for caffeine use.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that after 3 years of university study I quit because of a lack of motivation. I also seem very indecisive all the time. Alcohol and cannabis are probably two things that I enjoy.<br /><br />In fact since my reduced consumption of substances lately I have become even more withdrawn socially then when I used to go out partying with friends; or just generally being chatty. Actually that&#039;s what I miss about smoking cigarettes.<br /><br />I know this is hard for you to answer as you have said before it depends on the individual, but in your professional opinion would it be better to treat depression/anxiety symptoms (or just general malaise) with drugs/pharmaceuticals? Or would abstinence from all substances be better?<br /><br /><br />I am also asking as I was concerned when my brother went onto antidepressants - notably &quot;Pristiq&quot; He didn&#039;t even last two months and went off them because they were making him feel so bad. Actually he is a almost daily pot smoker and finds that better.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The role of genetics in human diseases is, in general, less important than people think. Several morphological characteristics are genetically determined. For most diseases, there is a genetic predisposition but there exist also environmental factors that condition the fact that an illness appear and its severity. Genetic diseases are rare and none of them is psychological. So characteristics of personality (impulsivity, shyness, addictive behaviours…) have a hereditary component that implies a certain tendency, modulated by education, motivation, determination, personal decisions and life-experience. So the fact that in your family there is an alcohol problem does not mean that it is “genetically” transmitted to you.<br />I can`t be sure if in your case it is better to treat depression/anxiety with drugs or not. But I don`t think that auto-medicate psychological symptoms with psychoactives is a good idea, regardless if they are legal or not. In fact I don`t think auto-medication is good, except if you have a flu or something like that. On the one hand, there is the knowledge factor. Drug prescription is much more than choosing a drug depending on symptoms. But, most important, a person can`t be objective with himself. I`m a doctor but, when I have a health problem I search for an independent, unbiased opinion. If we are talking about psychological problems and psychoactive drugs I think this is particularly important. Cannabis can be useful for certain psychological conditions but, in general, it is not a good antidepressant.<br />

				Hello DoctorX, and thank you SO much for your time and generous advice. It is so appreciated.<br /><br />My history:<br />I have been a recreational user of oral oxycodone for about 2 years. I started off feeling a great buzz with just 7.5 mg of oxycodone, and now two years later it takes me 30mg to feel the same buzz.&nbsp; (Tolerance is a lovely thing.)&nbsp; When I make an oxy purchase, I usually go a little nuts and take about 60mgs over the course of a day, usually 5 times per week.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I run out, it&#039;s no big deal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get terrible withdrawals-- just some (mostly amusing) restless legs/arms which go away with one 50mg tramadol before bed for a few days and that&#039;s it. (I&#039;m lucky.)<br /><br />My question:<br />I have to get a wisdom tooth pulled in a few weeks. Am I going to be in agony as I try to ease the legitimate tooth pain because of my opiate tolerance?&nbsp; Should I make sure I have a stockpile of oxy for when I get my tooth pulled?&nbsp; I know my dentist will prescribe me a few 5mg hydrocodones, but I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;ll be very helpful.<br /><br />What will happen, heaven forbid, if I need surgery or something someday? Will any medication be able to ease my legitimate pain?&nbsp; Would I have to tell my doctor about my oxy use?<br /><br />Thanks again.<br />--chakrakhan<br /><br />ps: For the record, I feel VERY blessed that I don&#039;t feel any physical or psychological addiction t oxy.&nbsp; I enjoy it very much, but if you told me I could never have it again, I&#039;d say &quot;OK&quot; and then I&#039;d go have a sandwich.

In general, you should be careful if you are using stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA…) and practising sport the day after, as there might be residual effects on blood pressure or heart rate. 1-3 days seems a reasonable time to wait before doing intense sport, although it depends on substance and dosage. It is not the same a few puffs of cannabis than a high dosage of LSD or MDMA. If used occasionally and in controlled conditions, there are no data to suppose that these substances could affect your physical gains. The exception is 25-NBOMe family. As I have explained several times in this thread, the lack of data about its effects and toxicity make these substances much more risky (at least, potentially) than cannabis, LSD, 2C-B, MDMA or cocaine

There are anecdotic reports of renal vasculitis associated to MDMA, it is possible that people with previous vasculitis are prone to this effect, although it is not confirmed:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10193849<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9794581<br />Anyway, it should be necessary to know exactly the kind of vasculitis and pharmacological treatment to assess risks.<br />

I started off feeling a great buzz with just 7.5 mg of oxycodone, and now two years later it takes me 30mg to feel the same buzz.&nbsp; (Tolerance is a lovely thing.)&nbsp; When I make an oxy purchase, I usually go a little nuts and take about 60mgs over the course of a day, usually 5 times per week.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I run out, it&#039;s no big deal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get terrible withdrawals-- just some (mostly amusing) restless legs/arms which go away with one 50mg tramadol before bed for a few days and that&#039;s it. (I&#039;m lucky.)<br /><br />My question:<br />I have to get a wisdom tooth pulled in a few weeks. Am I going to be in agony as I try to ease the legitimate tooth pain because of my opiate tolerance?&nbsp; Should I make sure I have a stockpile of oxy for when I get my tooth pulled?&nbsp; I know my dentist will prescribe me a few 5mg hydrocodones, but I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;ll be very helpful.<br /><br />What will happen, heaven forbid, if I need surgery or something someday? Will any medication be able to ease my legitimate pain?&nbsp; Would I have to tell my doctor about my oxy use?<br /><br />Thanks again.<br />--chakrakhan<br /><br />ps: For the record, I feel VERY blessed that I don&#039;t feel any physical or psychological addiction t oxy.&nbsp; I enjoy it very much, but if you told me I could never have it again, I&#039;d say &quot;OK&quot; and then I&#039;d go have a sandwich.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oxycodone causes drug tolerance (need to increase of dosage to achieve the desired effects). It also causes cross-tolerance with all strong opiates that work through opioid receptors (hydrocodone, fentanyl, heroin, morphine, codein, methadone…). If you are ever prescribed any of these medications and you are a regular user of oxycodone, you will need higher dosages to achieve analgesic effects, so you you should tell your doctor abour your oxycodone usage, or suffer pain ;( <br />&nbsp;Tolerance and cross-tolerance dissapear or diminish substantially in several weeks of abstinence. This effect of cross tolerance is not applicable to other non-opioid analgesic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics…) or anaesthetics. <br />

Some persons (but not all) improve their symptoms of anxiety using cannabis. For some people cannabis has an an anxiolytic effects, although paradoxically it can trigger anxiety in other persons. This can be explained by differences in personality and differences in cannabis composition. Cannabis rich in THC ( tetrahydrocannabinol) is, in general, more psychoactive than cannabis rich in CBD ( cannabidiol), that possess more relaxing qualities. Strains of the plant with a ratio THC/CBD 1/1 are the most suitable for therapeutic use.<br />Recent studies have shown that CBD has also antipsychotic properties. Although cannabis use is not recommended in persons suffering psychotic disorders it is possible that CBD has a role as a drug for management of this disease.

				Hi there Doc! I spammed my way to 50 posts just to come here and ask you some questions :)<br /><br />I LOVE MDMA, and clubbing without taking MDMA is, for me, like eating cake without sugar, or something like that. That sucks, but still, because of neurotoxicity, tolerance, depression and loss of magic, I want to find a good stimulant replacement so I can keep MDMA for moments which are more special. What I&#039;m concerned about at the time of finding this replacement, is: First, health safety (neurotoxicity, abuse potential, addictive potential, health risks). Second, tolerance. And third/fourth/fifth would be either of the MDMA&#039;s best effects (empathogen, entactogen, euphoria, uninhibitedness, etc). <br /><br />And as far as I researched, the best option I found seems to be 2C-B. Which leads me to some other questions:<br /><br />1- Is there any risk on doing 2C-B every weekend or even more frequently? Maybe supposing I&#039;ll be using it specially in low doses so I can get the stimulant effects rather than the psychedelic effects?<br /><br />2- What can you suggest about redosing 2C-B and mixing with MDMA on the same short period of time (let&#039;s say, one night)?<br /><br />3- Finally, is there any interaction between cannabis and 2C-B?<br /><br />I think that&#039;s it for now, thank you VERY much, your help is priceless.<br /><br />[EDIT: I&#039;m in the age range of 22-27, healthy, and low weighted]<br /><br />

				Dear Mr. Jackpot,<br /><br />You did exactly what I did; spam to 50 and tell Fernando he is great.&nbsp; <br />What does neurotoxicity really mean and what does clubbing mean?&nbsp; As FC has pointed out earlier, the brain is a very complex thing-a-ma-bob.&nbsp; Treat it kindly.&nbsp; <br />Now for the hard part.&nbsp; Since there are drugs out there that can give a man a perfect erection for two hours, why does anyone care about any other drug?

				First to help answer few questions then I will introduce myself to those who don&#039;t know who I am.<br /><br />chakrakhan87,you surely are blessed with absence of hellish WD,I can only envy you!<br />To answer you a question.<br />Although immensely popular in USA Oxycodone is very lousy pain medicine considering high <br />number of people getting addicted from legit use,price and very short period of duration is main problem.<br />Especially if you defeat SR mechanism! Even pure pharma grade heroin is much better in any way you can count!<br /><br />Since you are O addict with such tolerance already and if your doctor won&#039;t give you more I strongly advise you to stockpile something strong and long lasting like Oxymorphone (Opana) and Methadone.<br />(have great and cheap contact for last one)<br /><br />You will probably like Opana more since it&#039;s long lasting Oxycotin on euphoric steroids. ;-) It&#039;s my favorite rec-drug by far among opiates. Unfortunately Oral BA is extremely low (cca. 9%) so NOT extracting is waste of very expensive goods. Since potency ican drastically differ in different people,sometimes nearing potency of Fent to some people don&#039;t OD by accident! Titrate your dose slowly until you find the sweet spot. IV for best rush in your life,IM for longer acting pain relief. Since you are already taking almost identical molecule (oxycotin) it should be sligtly more than 2x as potent,but still,start slowly! As much as pinhead can kill opiate naive person!<br /><br />But I prefer Methadone for non-fun use over anything since it&#039;s EXTREMLY long lasting and great oral BA.<br />It was my painkiller of choice when I was medic during the war.<br />Far superior to morphine to whom many people are a bit allergic and best for those who are already long on opiates,illicit or legal. Only downside is that it can&#039;t be used IM in emergency.

				Jackpot<br /><br />Can&#039;t agree more with you on MDMA bro!<br />It&#039;s not a drug,but probably something Angels lost while raving! ;D<br /><br />I was MDMA cook and fanatical user for years,introduced it to countless people and took it every week or two,until magic was gone... :(<br />That hurts like loosing best,cutest and sexiest girl on Earth!<br /><br />I am live example that MDMA neurotoxicity is over exaggerated at least x100 times but I also<br />had habit of harm reduction by preloading and postloading with loads of vitamins and supplements.<br /><br />Best medicine for MDMA blues is opiates,especially up to 0,5mg Buprenorphine if you are opiate naive.<br /><br />To boost MDMA effects,avoid follow up doses,return some magic and extend experience up to 8h with single dose (at least in my case) there is one trick...but being very risk,potentially deadly to some people I am not comfortable sharing it publicly. It can lead to fatal Serotonine syndrome unless you are extremely depressed and in that case resistant. I mean depressed beyond words and resistant to all legal medicine.<br />&nbsp;If you are,then you might be safe (I know I am! Took the combo 100+ times) and feel free to PM me.<br /><br />I usually don&#039;t recommend to other people what I do cus in most cases combos and dosages I take without consequence are fatal to ordinary Joe.<br />Dangerous chemicals and drugs alike! <br /><br />As for fair replacement,there is something good in store: beta-ketone-MDMA (Methylone) and 4-MAR.<br />4-mar is obscure but piss easy to make in kitchen,just don&#039;t let subtle effect and euphoria fool you into <br />re-dosing which leads to seizure and death. On the plus side it&#039;s said to be almost entirely non-neurotoxic at normal doses,at least in animals. But lab animals are in my experience lousy surrogate for that kind of feedback...Same mg/kg of one chemical that will kill human won&#039;t kill 5 rats and vice versa.<br />No wonder totalitarian states like 3rd Reich were exponentially better in finding new and effective medicines<br />when their scientists had as much best possible test subjects as they pleased!<br /><br />

It properties make it a unique experience and I don`t think there is anything that can compare, in particular for clubbing. There is no other drug that combines mild stimulant properties, sublte pshychedelic effects easy to manage and a deep emotional aspect. So, instead of searching a “replacement” I think you`d better think about exploring other psychoactives but do not expect that they are going to give you the same of MDMA or try to compare with it. Even you could try clubbing sometimes without any drug and try to evoke previous experiences…Some substances can “teach” you abilities (I´m thinking in particular about MDMA and sociability) and it can be fun to explore this in a non-alterated state of consciousness. Anyway, your reasonment for choosing 2C-B is very logic in your arguments.<br />1.- Although there are not too many human studies on 2C-B, neurotoxic effects or long time toxicity seems very unlikely, according to molecular characteristics and previous human experience. Doing 2C-B once a week or more will get to get bored of its effects (we can call it tolerance, loss of magic or whatever but to use a unique, magic, delicate experience as an habit or routine leads to loss of interest sooner or later). At a stimulant rank 5-10 mg pharmacological tolerance will appear in a few weeks.<br />2.- This is a very popular combination that tries to get together emotional aspects of MDMA and psychedelics of 2C-B. First, you should have enough experience with both substances. Total dosage used in combination should be 20-30% below than dose used separated. A reasonable time of 1.5-2 hours between administration is required. Some people prefer to start with MDMA, other with 2C-B. In Internet forums you will find different opinions about the correct order to take substances but the only rule is personal preference. From a risk perspective there are no data about fatal or severe intoxications, but I insist in being careful with dosages and environments.

In a clinical setting, if someone is very aggressive and can harm himself or others the strategy is to knock-out with strong medication (antipsychotics, incisive benzodiacepines…). But, long time, psychology therapies are much more effective than drugs. I don`t think cannabis plays a role here, at least for most cases.<br />An in-person examination is essential to a correct medical evaluation. That is why diagnosis can`t be made through Internet, so my advices here are general orientation and can`t replace a complete medical evaluation <br />

I spammed my way to 50 posts just to come here and ask you some questions :)<br /><br />I LOVE MDMA, and clubbing without taking MDMA is, for me, like eating cake without sugar, or something like that. That sucks, but still, because of neurotoxicity, tolerance, depression and loss of magic, I want to find a good stimulant replacement so I can keep MDMA for moments which are more special. What I&#039;m concerned about at the time of finding this replacement, is: First, health safety (neurotoxicity, abuse potential, addictive potential, health risks). Second, tolerance. And third/fourth/fifth would be either of the MDMA&#039;s best effects (empathogen, entactogen, euphoria, uninhibitedness, etc). <br /><br />And as far as I researched, the best option I found seems to be 2C-B. Which leads me to some other questions:<br /><br />1- Is there any risk on doing 2C-B every weekend or even more frequently? Maybe supposing I&#039;ll be using it specially in low doses so I can get the stimulant effects rather than the psychedelic effects?<br /><br />2- What can you suggest about redosing 2C-B and mixing with MDMA on the same short period of time (let&#039;s say, one night)?<br /><br />3- Finally, is there any interaction between cannabis and 2C-B?<br /><br />I think that&#039;s it for now, thank you VERY much, your help is priceless.<br /><br />[EDIT: I&#039;m in the age range of 22-27, healthy, and low weighted]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well…some people seems that is difficult to find a substitute for MDMA. It properties make it a unique experience and I don`t think there is anything that can compare, in particular for clubbing. There is no other drug that combines mild stimulant properties, sublte pshychedelic effects easy to manage and a deep emotional aspect. So, instead of searching a “replacement” I think you`d better think about exploring other psychoactives but do not expect that they are going to give you the same of MDMA or try to compare with it. Even you could try clubbing sometimes without any drug and try to evoke previous experiences…Some substances can “teach” you abilities (I´m thinking in particular about MDMA and sociability) and it can be fun to explore this in a non-alterated state of consciousness. Anyway, your reasonment for choosing 2C-B is very logic in your arguments.<br />1.- Although there are not too many human studies on 2C-B, neurotoxic effects or long time toxicity seems very unlikely, according to molecular characteristics and previous human experience. Doing 2C-B once a week or more will get to get bored of its effects (we can call it tolerance, loss of magic or whatever but to use a unique, magic, delicate experience as an habit or routine leads to loss of interest sooner or later). At a stimulant rank 5-10 mg pharmacological tolerance will appear in a few weeks.<br />2.- This is a very popular combination that tries to get together emotional aspects of MDMA and psychedelics of 2C-B. First, you should have enough experience with both substances. Total dosage used in combination should be 20-30% below than dose used separated. A reasonable time of 1.5-2 hours between administration is required. Some people prefer to start with MDMA, other with 2C-B. In Internet forums you will find different opinions about the correct order to take substances but the only rule is personal preference. From a risk perspective there are no data about fatal or severe intoxications, but I insist in being careful with dosages and environments. Interacting with other persons and setting is, in general, easy with MDMA. Depending on dose of 2C-B and combination this can be more difficult (I´m thinking, for example, in a very crowded club). 2C-B is very dose-sensitive (effects change in the rank of 2 mg), so I suggest not to re-dose. <br />3.- As it happens with other drugs with psychedelic properties, using cannabis while on 2C-B increases hallucinogenic/psychedelic effects. For some people this can trigger anxiety or fear, particularly if they are not regular cannabis users.<br />Thanks for taking the effort to post…and don´t take too seriously cleansober commentaries.

And although I think you have already understood what I expect out of a &quot;MDMA replacement&quot;, let&#039;s say one night I go to some party but I just feel tired, like I need a little boost, mood lifting, and of course MDMA is not an option. For this, some people recommended me things as speed. What do you think of speed in terms of safety? It&#039;s not safe enough as far as I know, but I&#039;ve been told this from a bunch of people.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m waiting for a 2C-B order, so I&#039;ll try it, but hey, It&#039;s good to have some other options.<br /><br />And I think that&#039;s enough of your time for now.<br /><br />Thank you again!!<br /><br />EDIT: So you say it&#039;s not a good idea to redose 2C-B after a comedown on the same night, right? Let&#039;s say I take 10mg and I got the stimulant effects, then I come down. If I redose with another 10, I&#039;d be most likely having psychedelic effects, right? Sounds awesomely versatile :)

				@Cleansober<br /><br />Both!<br /><br />Drugs are tools,just like guns or electric drill.

Not even in war. My brain is hardwired differently. It has to do something with hardcore depression that killed almost every normal human feeling as form of self defense to suffer less and nasty self-inflicting pain/injury&nbsp; OCD type of disorder I had before I could walk.<br /><br />Closest to it I ever felt is anxiety like when order is too late or I miss the therapy.<br />As for LE...they and politicians are more afraid of me because they know I know too much about their dirty business and skeletons in closet but they also know I am reasonable,non-violent if not provoked,quite,and will remain so as long as I have my peace.

MDMA can be considered a safe drug if used properly or a very dangerous substance if you eat a pill omelette everytime you go clubbing.<br /><br />MDMA,&nbsp; stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine), and, to a lesser extent, GHB and ketamine are the drugs more frequently used in recreative settings. &quot;Legal highs&quot; (mephedrone, MDPV and derivatives) are not recommendable as there is no experience with humans with these substances and risks are impredictible.<br /><br />Each drug has its own pleasurable effects (that may not be pleasurable for everybody), risks and precautions of use. For example, a little increase on MDMA dosage usually does not have terrible consequences, but that increase on GHB or ketamine can ruin a night. From a pharmacological point of view, amphetamine (speed) is a well known substance. Effects are pleasurable for many people and risks are acceptable if you use it properly (in dosages, frequencies and pattern of use). <br /><br />Before testing any drug it is important to have enough reliable information about effects and risks. Erowid is one of the best sources of information in Internet.<br />http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/psychoactives.shtml<br /><br />Redosing 2C-B when effects are diminishing is quite impredictible. Sometimes you will get psychedelic effects, stimulant, a mix or just tiredness as neurotransmissors have been liberated enough.

I take enalapril to keep it in check, 10mg and it seems to do okay. There is no physical reason for my high BP and, after doing all tests, my Doc feels it&#039;s caused by anxiety and stress. Generally I find that MDMA makes me feel good, but I am&nbsp; worried about the dangers of what I&#039;m doing. I weight about 200lbs and my average dose is 100mg max.<br />Another question…I think I use MDMA in order to attack my depression. I do It once or twice a month. Since I started using it my social life has started again. I have had personal problems, I want to get rid of my depression but I don`t want to depend on drugs my whole life<br />Thanks a lot doc<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It should be important to have more information. Let´s supposse your blood pressure is well controlled with medication, you are young, no other diseases, and no other cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, tobacco, high cholesterol, obesity...), and, that your doctor thinks the cause is stress and he hasn´t prescribed you limitations for your normal life (you can do intense sport, for example). In this case, use of MDMA at the doses you´ve said is probably sure and you are facing the same low risks as other person.<br />In my opinion there is no pharmacological cure for depression. It is not an organic disease, but, as you say, caused in general by psychological distress. Antidepressives (both legal and illegal) can releive symptoms but will not cure definetly the disease. Medication can help to set you in a psychological situation where you will be able to deal with the situation, but should be used as a temporal help. And MDMA is not a good antidepressive for long-time treatment at all. The best way to solution the problem is to seek for psychological advice. It doesn´t matter if it is a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist, but someone with good technical (universitary) formation and you feel comfortable with. It is very difficult to solve this situations by oneself, there are parts of oneself that must be seen from &quot;outside&quot;, with the help of a good profesional. Sometimes this process is painful and long in time but is the most effective way to solve problems like yours.<br />

Not only is it a great pain killer but best shock treatment and best gift imaginable to dieing individual.&nbsp; <br />Got nickname &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot; by soldiers! One of the things I am most proud in my life. After the war,instead of free and proud country there was anarchy,poverty &amp; misery.<br />Deserters and cowards became rich and war heroes bumps with skyhigh rate of suicide.<br />Incompetent and malignant politicians;bad bunch of capitalists robbing us of future and even worse bunch of commies destroying our past only cemented social situation. So,I did what I knew best,which was pretty easy in anarchy and became good at it,Breaking Bad good in my best period.<br />Don&#039;t want to brag but anything related to MDMA and opiates,including their unconventional use I mentioned and personal massive (ab)use until I found harmony and self-discipline in drug use that really helped a lot with my condition.

And in all the scientific literature about MDMA or amphetamine derivatives you will never see anything about analgesic properties. Opiates are the most potent analgesics, that idea is not logical neither based in scientific evidence.

This is such an incredibly helpful thread and I really appreciate your time and patience in addressing our questions.<br /><br />I would like to ask you if bronchial or ventolin inhalers are of any benefit to a person (who does not have asthma or any known health conditions) who is experiencing some breathing difficulties due to opiate use? I&#039;m not referring to respiratory depression, but difficulty drawing breath. <br />For example, if someone IV&#039;s heroin and then feels like they can&#039;t inhale enough air or can&#039;t fill up their lungs. They try to take a deep breath but this still feels unsatisfactory as if they&#039;re not getting enough air. In this instance resting heartrate is not below normal. <br /><br />Thank you<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bronchodilators as ventolin are only effective in cases of bronchial obstructions (asthma or related conditions). It sounds a bit strange to me that someone using heroin feels difficulty for breathing. There might be different causes (cardiologic, neurologic, respiratory...) but bronchial obstruction induced by opiates sounds very unlikely. So I think bronchodilators would be useless, but the important thing should be knowing the cause of difficulty breathing. The most likely probability should be respiratory depression but it should be necessary to rule our other dangerous causes.

Amphetamine salts for intranasal or oral administration (speed) are, in general, the most adulterated substance in illegal drug markets. Medium purity osciles between 2.5-15%. That´s a six-fold variation and explain why some people react different to amphetamines. Recently, other stimulant amphetamines are added (as 4-FA or even PMA) . And in some countries there is a confussion between meth (far more potent and less adulterated) and amphetamine. I think this factor is important.<br />On the other hand, amphetamines generate pharmacological tolerance quickly, and this tolerance remains weeks or months even with non-daily adiministration. Finally, as it hapens with many other drugs, some people are more sensitive or resistent to its effects. It is a question of personal pharmacology :)

There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans. Drugs in class D should only be administered during pregnancy evaluating if benefits for the mother are very important and there are no other options. Some authors think that diacepam or chlorazepoxide should be less risky, although, in general, benzos are contraindicated during pregnancy.<br />Active dosage of alprazolam is 0.125 to 2 mg. So &quot;1 or 2 mg&quot; is not a low dose at all. Probably the risk for the fetus in a esporadic, ocassional use is very low. But if your gf is using alprazolam regularlly and she is pregnant, I think she should seek professional advice to search for another way to treat her problems

				Hi there Doc. Thanks for your service. Couple questions if you have a moment.<br /><br />1) Have you ever come across anything&nbsp; about cannabis and REM sleep? I recently quit smoking cannabis and have had the most incredible, vivid, wierd, personal, and sometimes overwhelming dreams. I have had dreams of this magnitude before but it seems like every single night since cessation I&#039;ve had an incredible dream sequence. I was an all day every day smoker for about 12 years. I was wondering if this phenomenon has ever been studied or documented that you know of. <br /><br />2) Safrole is carcinogenic, do you think unreacted precursor, byproducts, or otherwise unpure MDMA may also be carcinogenic to any extent? i.e. MDMA containing MDP2P, bromo-safrole, iso-safrole...might these typical impurities be carcinogenic as well? <br /><br />3) I&#039;ve studied MDMA have read that MDMA acts as both a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and as a potent agonist of serotonergic neurons owing it&#039;s profound affects to significant release of and sequestration of serotonin within the synaptic cleft. In PiHKAL, Dr. Shulgin speaks about a study that was done in the 70&#039;s where patients were administered 160mg of MDMA per day and after 7 days could not feel any effects from the drug at all showing MDMA a rapid tolerance. Some patients were given MDA on the 8th day and were able to get the full effects of the drug. I recently tried MDA for the first time but have done MDMA &gt;20 times and found differences to be remarkably hard to distinguish. The study suggests two completely different mechanisms by which MDA and MDMA act in the brain. Can you shed any light on the mechanism of MDA in the brain if there is indeed no cross-tolerance between the two drugs? <br /><br />Thank you for your service and opinions. I love references too if you have any but don&#039;t trouble youself please :)

Now that I have gotten use to the intensity I do not want them to end and almost everyday I try to go back to sleep after waking to extend the dreams. Extension of my dreams in the morning is often the most pleasant because I feel like I can somewhat manipulate what I was dreaming into what I would rather change the dream into...if that makes sense.

				Hello everyone. I have a couple of questions for the doctor. <br /><br />I have been using cocaine about once to twice a month for about 5 years now. I recently had a nasty sinus infection which I believe was due to the coke use and it lasted about two weeks. <br />My question is, are there any things that I can do now that I am going off of coke for good that may be helpful to my sinuses? I feel like they are not completely recovered. Still congested a lot. <br /><br />Also I read somewhere that 80% of cocaine has levisamole in it. Can you confirm or deny this? From what I understand its a nasty drug and part of the reason Im giving it up. Thanks for your contributions to the community. I look forward to your response.

As far as I know this effect has not been studied but is a very common complain of regular cannabis users that quit using it. This effect lasts several weeks but dissapears and dreams are normalized.<br /><br />2) Data from safrole toxicity come from animal studies and its carcinogenic potential is low. Dosages of safrole or safrole derivatives as MDMA synthesis sub-products are far below the minimum carcinogenic dosage in animals. I don´t think that this risk can be considered significative.<br />http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out116_en.pdf<br /><br />3) The difference between MDA and MDMA effects is probably related to specific action of MDA on a subtype of serotonin receptors (5HT-2A). Activation of these receptors has been linked to&nbsp; psychedelic effects. MDMA does not act on these receptors, at least at common dosages. The specific effect on 5HT-2A of MDA probably explains the lack of cross-tolerance. The story you have explained is a anecdotical experimental report by Shulgin´s team and the lack of cross-tolerance between MDMA and MDA has been proved on animal models<br />http://www.lycaeum.org/research/researchpdfs/1990_zacny_1.pdf

				Doc, straight and simple:<br /><br />What can affect the tactogen nature of MDMA? Quality? purity? setting? dosage?<br /><br />Long version:<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a bit of MDMA last sunday, which I didn&#039;t weight because I had no scale, but I guess it was around 100mg (small person, almost empty stomach, took an antacid,&nbsp; 2gr vitamin C, 32mg caffeine, 325mg aspirin and 200mg Lipoic Acid beforehand). When it went up, I was in a cold place waiting for a bus by myself, so I didn&#039;t have all this &quot;loving everybody&quot; feeling, but what I did feel was dizziness and a buzz in all my body. When I ran to the drugstore and called a taxi to my girlfriend&#039;s, I noticed I was speedy as hell, as I usually am when I roll (talking very fast, and my legs moved by themselves when I walked/ran). I didn&#039;t have this urge for rubbing my skin that I usually feel, though; touching my skin felt normal. No jaw clenching either, no difficulty to pee, no difficulty to ejaculate, I eventually felt hungry, and duration was short I think (I didn&#039;t time it, actually, but it felt short). All in all, it felt quite mild outside the 20~ minutes that the euphoric peak lasted. This would be my first time to take MDMA in a setting which was not in a club.<br /><br />Again, thank you very much for your help!

A limited cycle of intranasal corticoids (no more of one week of intranasal 0.05% fluticasone) is helpful if there is no bacterial infection. If this is not enough you should ask for medical evaluation, as some complications (nasal polyps) should be ruled out.<br /><br />Levamisole is an antihelmintic (drug for parasites) that has been widely detected in 30-70% of cocaine samples since 2009. Levamisole is added because it has stimulant effects, and reacts as cocaine in the “bleach test,” a quick, widely utilized street test for cocaine purity. Skin problems (vasculitis) and blood diseases ( leukopenia, agranulocytosis) are related to cocaine adulterated with levamisole. In general, risk depend on dosage and occasional/sporadic use is low risk. But it depends also in levamisole concentration, some samples of cocaine can contain up to 30-50% of levamisole. Levamisole-adulterated cocaine is one of the most important problems with this drug since 2009.

At least you should use a Marquis/Mecke reagent to verify that the drug you are taking is really MDMA (if in your country you can access to a quantification technique that would be the best). And using a scale is also very important: it can be very difficult to distinguish between 100-150 mg without a scale and difference of effects in this rank is very important.There are cheap and simple scales that can be very useful.<br /><br />In general, empathogenic effect of MDMA is very specific of this drug: your story sounds a bit strange to me, you would have to verify that your drug was really MDMA. If this is true, differences on effects would be explained by setting/dosage.But everytime you buy a new batch of supposed MDMA you should verify purity before using

Quality? purity? setting? dosage?<br /><br />Long version:<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a bit of MDMA last sunday, which I didn&#039;t weight because I had no scale, but I guess it was around 100mg (small person, almost empty stomach, took an antacid,&nbsp; 2gr vitamin C, 32mg caffeine, 325mg aspirin and 200mg Lipoic Acid beforehand). When it went up, I was in a cold place waiting for a bus by myself, so I didn&#039;t have all this &quot;loving everybody&quot; feeling, but what I did feel was dizziness and a buzz in all my body. When I ran to the drugstore and called a taxi to my girlfriend&#039;s, I noticed I was speedy as hell, as I usually am when I roll (talking very fast, and my legs moved by themselves when I walked/ran). I didn&#039;t have this urge for rubbing my skin that I usually feel, though; touching my skin felt normal. No jaw clenching either, no difficulty to pee, no difficulty to ejaculate, I eventually felt hungry, and duration was short I think (I didn&#039;t time it, actually, but it felt short). All in all, it felt quite mild outside the 20~ minutes that the euphoric peak lasted. This would be my first time to take MDMA in a setting which was not in a club.<br /><br />Again, thank you very much for your help!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Purity and a correct dosage are fundamental. At least you should use a Marquis/Mecke reagent to verify that the drug you are taking is really MDMA (if in your country you can access to a quantification technique that would be the best). And using a scale is also very important: it can be very difficult to distinguish between 100-150 mg without a scale and difference of effects in this rank is very important.There are cheap and simple scales that can be very useful.<br /><br />In general, empathogenic effect of MDMA is very specific of this drug: your story sounds a bit strange to me, you would have to verify that your drug was really MDMA. If this is true, differences on effects would be explained by setting/dosage.But everytime you buy a new batch of supposed MDMA you should verify purity before using<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Thank you doc!! Though I was referring to tactogen effect, as when touching things feels wonderful.<br /><br />I&#039;m having a hard time to find a marquis locally. Doing it internationally would take ages. And better not even think about verifying purity. <br /><br />The seller I got it from was a massive seller so I guess this MDMA is of standard quality. I don&#039;t think it was methylone though, because the comeback felt so clean I didn&#039;t even notice. I may have just lost the magic or worried too much about the setting.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m getting a scale tomorrow and hopefully a marquis reagent too. I&#039;ll update when I get a reagent.<br /><br />EDIT: <br />OK; I got a scale now and now I know how much is 100mg. I&#039;d say, for what I can remember, I had about 50mg, so things now make more sense; it was impossible to get 100mg with a single fingertip -my size, of course-.<br /><br />Could that have been a reason why I got all speedy but almost no tactogen effect at all?

Years later a pal told me, he had a similar experience, having a pin removed from their thigh or shin, under local anesthetic, he reckoned that the use of cocaine, the day before, and the day he was in hospital caused the anesthetic to have limited efficiency to the point of not working.<br />What is the truth of this?

				Hi Doc,<br /><br />Thanks again for answers (and again sent some spare coins your way).<br /><br />Some more questions:<br /><br />1. Are there any studies for greater bioavailability for drugs absorbed from intestines (using entering coating) versus orally taken (absorbed from stomach)? For example, people are using MAOIs to take DMT orally -- would DMT be available orally if taken with entering coating/capsule? (MAOIs have lots interactions). Also, the same for drugs that have very low bioavailability orally (some opioids for example). Or would it be roughly the same?<br /><br />2. Benzodiazepines + weed -- any contradictions? (I&#039;ve read a lot of bad reports, but most of those had also alcohol mixed -- and mixing benzos with the alcohol is stupid in the first place). I must to keep my weed doses low because of high risk of anxiety on stronger doses and would like to use benzos to counteract it (if there are no indications to not do so).<br /><br />3. Scopolamine -- what are physically dangerous doses (I&#039;m talking in &quot;recreational&quot;/&quot;experience-seeking&quot; usage range) and if there is any method/drug to prevent anterograde amnesia while on it (to remember as much from experience as one can)? Or is it impossible due to the anticholinergic nature of the drug. <br /><br />Also, if there are also some &quot;safety valve&quot; drugs for deliriants (like benzos on psychedelics)<br /><br />4. If you would strongly recommend against scopolamine use is there any other deliriant to be used safely? (I know that all deliriants are not really advised, but would just like to try it once).<br /><br />5. Are there any muscle relaxants that would not interfere with the psychedelic experience? I tend to have very strong muscle tension (legs would be most affected) during psychedelic (LSD, shrooms, 2CB etc.) experience coming up and would like to be able to do something with it. <br /><br />Also -- if one feels this tension is it better to try to &quot;walk it off&quot; (especially since there is a lot of stimulation connected with most of psychedelics) or sit still and try to not flex muscles at all?<br /><br />Thanks a lot again and take care!<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />6. Do you know of any drugs that use nebulization administration way for recreational use? (for example, for quicker onset or improved bioavailability).<br /><br />

				On the issue of purity of drugs, I have a question for anyone who might know the answer.&nbsp; My 28 gram purchase of weed seemed much more like a bushel-basket than an oz, however, in the interest of science, I am slowly using this product up. After smoking a few days, three or four times a day, I had a digestive problem, first throwing up in the early morning and diarrhea later. Some of the best throw up sessions I&#039;ve had since stopping binge drinking or getting a good dose of some flu like bug.&nbsp; This must have been a body response to the border weed I was smoking and trying to cook up. My wife is very upset I am so selfish as to get sick. The upset occurred again, under the same drug use pattern about a week later, not quite as bad though.&nbsp; I wonder if I am getting a tolerance built up to the cannabis or what? Almost gone, I hope I can avoid reordering!<br /><br />Sex addiction may be a good alternative to drug use, think?Talk about tactile wonderment, I can feel the flesh of gods or perhaps them touching me, so it seems. Alternatively I&#039;m touched. Perhaps sex addiction is as bad as drug addiction but it seems like more fun, sex addiction that is.<br /><br />DoctorX,<br /><br />Mr. T says &quot;EDIT:<br /><br />6. Do you know of any drugs that use nebulization administration way for recreational use? (for example, for quicker onset or improved bioavailability).&quot;<br /><br />What do you thing of the BHO method of using cannabis?&nbsp; Seems very likely to cause more than casual use, or not.<br /><br />Cleansober<br /><br />wonder how long this site will be working? I&#039;m surprised it is still up, maybe they want to collect all address and info they can to bring fear into the hearts of would be evil people?&nbsp;

There are no studies like that for recreational drugs. Only some opioids (morphine, oxicodone) have modified presentations to make effects more long lasting, but they are commercial prescription drugs.<br />2.- Well...it basically depends on the kind of weed and potency&nbsp; of benzo. Strains of weed rich in CBD have more narcotic effects than those rich in THC, more psychedelic. Some benzos are relaxant (tetrazepam. bromazepam), other more hipnotic (zolpidem), other more ansyolitic...so the result will depend on many factors (dosage of both weed and benzos is important).<br />3.- Prescription dosage of scopolamine for sedation is 600 micrograms<br />4.- I strongly advice against experimentation with scopolamine. Recreative, desirable or interesting effects are minimal, individual responses are not predictible and risk of intoxication is high<br />5.- Effective muscle relaxants are benzos or benzo derivatives, so they will have some interference with psychedelics.<br />6.- Cannabis and some opiates can be vaporized. Effects will be noticeable at same rate than smoked, but in a safer way for lungs.

				FC,<br /><br />We are all wondering what your next move will be.&nbsp; If you do go to BMR are you in a way endorsing potentially dangerous addictive patterns of drug use? Not to mention the firearms, underage porn, etc. Or it could be viewed as an attempt to prolong the dark web for some political or social reason? Or you selfishly think you can help people get control of their usage.<br /><br />Whatever you choose I feel like I have learned a lot new words and ideas, some of which I still remember and will know for many years, god willing. Thank you DoctorX and sorry the man got my spare change before you did.<br /><br />Can you set up a forum on you personal site? One way to control content and set your own question protocol. Additionally you could have some legal disclaimer in bold letters to protect you from international and other law suit issues.<br /><br />Just my two cents. A phrase I reacquainted myself with talking to a heroin addict on the street a few days ago.&nbsp; He pays two cents per text, thus he literally is giving his two cents worth every time he texts.<br /><br />CleanS.<br /><br />Still interested in you opinion who should not take E, or who should go to their own spring of selfhood and ask themselves if they should avoid or experiment with potential fire.<br />&nbsp;<br />

Also, when he talked, he sounded like a foreigner (Foreign Accent Syndrome?). <br /><br />When the effects of the MDMA went away, he came back to normal.<br /><br />I&#039;ve searched about possible relationships with MDMA and Foreign Accent Syndrome but I&#039;ve found nothing... and you&#039;re the best option I can think of having an opinion from.<br /><br />Thank you very much for your help.

				As far as I know that syndrome has not been reported or investigated in relation to MDMA. I only have noticed that some people that speak usually a foreign language have a more pronounced accent under MDMA effects. In my knowledge, difficulties to coordinate body and mind are typical (although non specific) of MDMA high dosages.

Would fist time uses need less to be really empathetic?&nbsp; Many other questions come to mind.&nbsp; There are no answers only guesses or estimates. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Haha, we just popped 2 capsules of about 100mg MDMA&nbsp; into a water bottle, shaked it for a while and then served it in 3 glasses. 200mg / 3 = 66,66666...<br /><br />The reason why we took this low dose was a mix of things. We didn&#039;t want too much of it because the party wasn&#039;t very good, and it turned to be worse as the time passed, but we didn&#039;t expect that. Moreover, they felt safer not to take an entire pill, so I encouraged that idea with the fact that the party would probably not be as good as it should for a rolling situation.<br /><br />We had a good time, but not even close to be as awesome and unforgettable as my first rolling experiences were.<br /><br /><br />I wonder if MDMA didn&#039;t solute it evenly in the water and maybe my friend took the &quot;bottom of the bottle&quot; or something.

Aswell as people thinking they can actually speak a language they cannot. Recommend you go to Sports Bars or similar places with tourists where people drink heavily if you want to study the phenomena closer and maybe get a clue why it occurs during intoxication of MDMA aswell. I think there even was a Finnish vodka-brand which suggested drinking of it made people talk Finnish.

				Dear Maria Larsson,<br /><br />Also known as Rosetta Stoned.&nbsp; What would Micheal Thoms (sp?) say? http://www.michelthomas.com/<br />The friendliest way to learn a language until they invent a pill form of language learning.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting for that day to come. For now I learn one sentence every 3 years and seem to forget the previous sentence soon after stopping to use it. Why not in the beginning was reason, in place of in the beginning was the word? Do we have any non Christians on this forum? Wonder if there are different perspectives on drug use in other cultures?&nbsp; The various sects who practice sacred drug ceremonies.&nbsp; GTG<br /><br />Your Friend,<br /><br />CleanSober <br /><br />
