				First time I took MDMA 100mg - lots of eye wiggles during the peak, constant smiling, not much euphoria, more outgoing/loveuped<br />Next night took 200mg - some eye wiggles, constant smiling, euphoria felt like I was in a cloud/chilled out, more outgoing/loveuped<br />2 weeks later - 250mg - no eye wiggles, no constant smiling, super intense euphoria/pure bliss, cigarettes &amp; gum tasted like heaven,more outgoing/loveuped<br />5 weeks later - 200mg - no eye wiggles, no constant smiling, mild euphoria/more physical euphoria from touch, more outgoing/loveuped <br /><br />Now from now on I get the same effects from the last roll I listed, no matter the dose and with waiting up to 4 weeks. I&#039;ve never been able to get eye wiggles, constant smiling, or the pure bliss euphoria.

				Is it all from the same vendor, the same batch?&nbsp; That can definitely have an effect.

				Are you using reputable vendors with quality products?<br /><br />And is it 200mg in 1 dose, or is it 200mg spread over the whole night?

				You&#039;ve been waiting less (or equal to) four weeks? I would suggest waiting longer if you want a stronger roll.&nbsp; Either your serotonin levels may not have completely recovered, or your serotonin receptors are still desensitized, from your last roll.

				Slow your roll, i like to wait at least a month between rolls.<br /><br />the stuff you had after those first two nights probably weren&#039;t as strong.

				As an MDMA lover I can safely say the eye wiggles (nystagmous) are more common on the first few trips and normally just an effect of taking a little too much. Your body acclimates to MDMA in my experience and more often than not most folks don&#039;t get insane eye wiggles unless they take it rarely or take bigger doses. <br /><br />Spacing out the rolls as others have mentioned will help some. A month is a pretty reasonable amount of time to wait but the longer the better. You have a finite amount of MDMA joy available in life. You can burst through it quickly or let it recharge longer between rolls to stretch the fun out longer. <br /><br />A few tips.<br /><br />Try some MDA sometime, it&#039;s more like the first time with MDMA than MDMA is the third or fourth time out. Heck, the first batch might have had a little MDA in it which increases the visual stuff as well as the physical euphoria in my experience. <br /><br />If you are adventurous, consider plugging the dose (yeah, up the butt, I know, but hear me out). By plugging MDMA you bypass a lot of variables like last meal, stomach acid composition, bio-availability issues and the like. It hits harder, faster, and lasts about as long as taking it orally. Obviously, there&#039;s a stigma associated with the whole idea but most people who actually give it a try end up agreeing it&#039;s simply better than eating when conditions allow for privacy of administration.<br /><br />Setting makes a HUGE difference in the roll you have. I take mine with my wife or girlfriend and we just sit around being in love. It&#039;s consistent for us because we always do it the same way. If you take it on a night out on the town or with new friends over it&#039;s going to react to the environment. The same drug will feel different based on something as small as the person you are taking it with smoked some pot earlier that night or got a little drunk. The key is to just go with it and see what you get out of that night. More often than not you&#039;ll get to bond with someone or find out something about yourself or just enjoy a little well earned bliss even if the rolls feel a little different.<br /><br />Have fun though!

				I have been MDMA way to much, about a gram in a day the last 4 times I have done it. Which we all in about 3 months. I am losing some of the effects. I will do it again in about a week, but then I am done for a long while. Maybe til summer.

				I also echo the sentiments of space out your rolls buddy! I gave my friend his first rolling experience on the weekend and a couple of days later, he&#039;s asking me for more for him and his friends who haven&#039;t done it either -- but I&#039;m not going to give it to him because I am the grinch! ho ho ho!<br /><br />Not really, but I&#039;m not giving it to him -- with great drugs, comes great responsibility and you need to learn that like a dry guy using lube when wanking, it should only be used for special occasions, otherwise it truly loses its magic. I stick to the at least a month, 2 is better is 3 months is great rule for when it comes to rolling.

				I&#039;m not sure where you&#039;re all getting a month + from. I&#039;ve never seen anything indicating that from a reputable source in the scientific press, but maybe that&#039;s just me.<br />&nbsp;Obviously it depends on the strength of the dose and such but typically seratonin levels are pretty close to normal after a week, after 2-3 weeks you&#039;d find it tough to tell the difference.<br /><br />One thing that can help in the immediate aftermath is 5-HTP, it&#039;s a seratonin precursor and can bring you back up to a more normal level more quickly - I don&#039;t roll without some on hand...
