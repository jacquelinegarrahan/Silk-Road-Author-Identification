				Alright, there are just way too many NBOMEe forum posts (many of which are started by me ;)) to not have an official thread to point everyone interested in this substance to.&nbsp; Below I will try to compile as much info as possible on all the NBOMe substances.<br /><br />If you have anything to contribute please post below and I will edit it into this 1st post and give you credit :)<br /><br /><br /><br />_____________________<br /><br />What is a NBOMe?<br /><br />The NBOMe series of chemicals are primarily N-o-methoxybenzyl analogs of the 2C-X family of phenethylamines, and are 5-HT2A (serotonin 2A) receptor agonists. A few are amphetamine analogs. With few exceptions (e.g. mescaline-NBOMe), compounds in this group are active at very low sub-milligram doses. These chemicals have nearly no history of human use prior to 2010 when they first became available online.<br /><br />Who makes up the NBOMe family?<br /><br />1. 25c<br /><br />2C-C-NBOMe = (25C-NBOMe; NBOMe-2C-C) <br />2C-C-NBOMe →<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;phenethylamine<br /><br />2. 25i<br /><br />2C-I-NBOMEe = (25I-NBOMe; NBOMe-2C-I)<br />2C-I-NBOMe →<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;phenethylamine<br /><br />3. 345<br /><br />mescaline-NBOMe = (345-NBOMe; NBOMEe-mescaline)<br />Mescaline-NBOMEe →<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3,4,5-trimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine <br /><br />What other drugs give similar affects to the NBOMe family?<br /><br />According to most users, the NBOMe family (specifically 25i) produces similar affects to LSD.<br /><br />Is NBOMe safe?<br /><br />All the NBOMe&#039;s are still RC&#039;s (Research Chemicals) which basically means this substance hasn&#039;t had enough tests in controlled environments to determine the safety.&nbsp; Popular Clearnet drug information sites such as Erowid and Bluelight strongly suggest against taking more than 4mgs of the substance?<br /><br />What is the best way for me to take NBOMe?<br /><br />This issue is still being debated however unlike LSD, NBOMe must be absorbed bucally, meaning if you swallow a blotter paper containing NBOMe your stomach acid will just destroy the substance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Alright, just going to post this for now and try to get some help from other forum members... going to add in some trip reports and as much information as I have compiled around my computer.<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; :-*<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Here&#039;s a great trip report c/p&#039;d from another site:<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Today prepared a HPBCD-complexed 2&quot; x 3/8&quot; wide blotter with 500ug of 25i-nbome, I sprinkled a thin layer of HPBCD on the blotter before applying the etoh dissolved drops of drug. allowed it to dry for 1/2 hour with a fan heater placed in front of it, the blotter suspended horizontally by two clothespins then placed on upper gum for 30 minutes, then removed.<br /><br />I felt it kick in 1.5 hour later (the iodo takes a very long time to set in), by 2.5 hours, I was fulling full peak effects.<br /><br />I am completely blown away by this dose, this higher dose is soooo much more to my liking, it feels equipotent to 150ug of acid or so....<br /><br />I just had acid not but 2 days ago (once again) but promise to give a full 4 weeks before I take another psychedelic again.<br /><br />I am experiencing an incredible empathogenic headspace with maginficient euphoria, I am enjoying this trip even more than my 175ug acid trip 2 days ago.<br /><br />I am so in love with this molecule. I am getting visual activity very similar to that of acid trip, staring into an image on computer monitor, colors and patterns of the image begin to morph and almost change into other things, there are shadows everywhere, and afterimages everywhere. I am enraptured by the power and beautiful headspace of this substance. Watching movies I am sooooo into the characters and plot and visuals, I&#039;m even in a better empathogenic headspace then even the acid trip days ago, way far ahead of it in fact...the euphoria is absolutely delightful as well. This a deep and meaningful molecule. The tracers are quite strong and looking into a mirror is an experience. I see patterns on actors and actress foreheads when watching them on TV, the headspace is deep and meaningful and incredibly empathogenic, the &quot;human-ness&quot; of this molecule is identical to the &quot;human-ness&quot; imparted by acid, strong glowing empathogenic quality with a great sense of humor. Every now and then I see &quot;bursts of visual electric energy&quot; shoot through the air, everything seems alive with electric energy...the visuals are just as powerful as those of acid, there is alot of visual stuff going on, I love the visual activity alot. Looking at a poster I see patterns on all of the skin of the actress, colors jump out and energy is everywhere. Music sounds glorious and has deep emotional impact. I may even prefer this stuff to acid (in fact, I think I do), I place it ahead of acid in many respects. There is indescribable beauty all around me. This is a real Gem, just like Erny saids. Love, love, love this stuff!!!!<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe I am tripping this hard after having taken approximately 175ug of acid not but two days ago, how is this possible, perhaps it is the extrememly high affinity of this nbome molecule for the 5-HT2A receptor as compared to acid???<br /><br />Well, whatever the case or mechanism, I am enraptured and place this experience among the best I have EVER experienced on psychedelics or empathogens.<br /><br />p.s still no body load and absolutely no nausea at this higher dose, I will never go below this dose again, 500ug is where the magic happens! If I could cross acid with ecstasy, this is exactly what I would imagine it to be, the best of both worlds without the fatigue of ecstasy the next day. <br /><br />This is no doubt, my Favorite Psychedelic.<br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Awesome, eh?&nbsp; Fortunately, here on the &#039;Road we can get this product already complexed, so no need to break out those dusty Chemistry skillz!&nbsp; <br /><br />Omega<br /><br />

				Hey Omega, would you mind just grabbing the link of that trip report... I am going to compile my favorite trip reports off Erowid/Bluelight/SR and just put links as that way the first post will be as uncluttered as possible.<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Suggestion for additional questions on the FAQ..<br /><br />&nbsp;What chemicals are known to exhibit cross-tolerance with the NBOME family? What is the tolerance effect/window for this substance with repeated dosing oof the same or similar NBOME?
