				Looking for information on dosage, injection site and H quality / type for IV injection. I have had some exp with H years back but never via IV. I would like to try it at least once in this life time. My main concerns are dose and quality. I plan on doing this once so I don&#039;t plan on trying to step up dosages. Just want to know what is safe for a given body weight without having any previous tolerances built up. Is it H4 that is the best for IV? How should it be prepared? Distilled water, cotton and lighter? What gauge and length of needle should be used? Proper injection site? Any other precautions? Any help is appreciated.

				have someone experience u know well to do it for you and then they can take off after they make sure ur ok with the needle out. I always said i wouldn&#039;t but after some major surgerys and having had a needle in my arm with the same narcotic one of my friends convinced me to do it. best feeling ever even though I puked for like 2 straight hours but some how I still felt pure bliss...the puking almost felt like that good feeling u get from a sneeze. personally i would stay away because I thought I had amazing self control but as soon as I tried it I was secretly trying to hide it from my wife. If I wasn&#039;t bleed with horrible thin veins (doctors and addicts can&#039;t hit a vein for me) so long story short I would be a shooter if my viens could take it but I advice to STAY AWAY. You will start to put the drug before everything eventually. trying it just once is ok but I promise u you will rationalize it to yourself a few times can&#039;t hurt and after that it&#039;s down hill. <br />Cant say with the quality h here though I haven&#039;t thought about getting some for a rainy day.&nbsp; Wouln&#039;t mind trying 100% quality meth for a time or two just to know the feeling but would never do it recreationally. Kind of wanted it to replace molly once or twice at a festival.

				Just started iving again too.&nbsp; I would go with hatter26&#039;s cold shoot, you can get it in 500mg/5ml and 250mg/2.5ml solutions.&nbsp; Thats the easiest way to measure out your shot - 1m = 100mg of h.&nbsp; When I first purchased it my tolerance was pretty low and 20-30units of a 1ml syringe did it for me, I was fucking floating off of that dosage.&nbsp; I&#039;m about average height and weight so I would imagine anyone would without a tolerance would be fine with that.&nbsp; I would stick with the cold shoot because it&#039;s just the easiest way to measure out a shot and know exactly how much mg you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; Measuring out powder or tar is pretty difficult, especially if you&#039;re getting back into the game.&nbsp; Hatter&#039;s prices are expensive but his packaging, speed, and quality product are unmatched.&nbsp; Plus you just draw up his solution and voila...easiest and safest way if you ask me.&nbsp; Let me know what you think

				What other people have said in this thread is great, but also, please do it with a sitter, especially if you&#039;ve never IV&#039;d before. I threw up my first time and thankfully someone was there to make sure my airway stayed clear. The peace of mind attained by having someone there to keep you safe and help you if needed is very important to me when I&#039;m using any harder drug; I like to be in a calm mental state without having anything to worry about before using something like H.

				Can I just say, please consider stepping up your dose. I know it means more injections and it&#039;s nice to get smashed in one go. But, as a safety procursion I always do a small (0.05g for me, maybe 0.02g for beginner) if the H is from a new dealer or is a new batch (I do this both here and in real life). Once you have a feel for how strong it is then do as much as you thinks best in the second shot. I mean this could be a matter of life and death, especially to a beginner. Are your reasons for not wanting to step up your dose that important you&#039;d risk OD&#039;ing for them?<br /><br />Be safe, have fun.&nbsp; :)
