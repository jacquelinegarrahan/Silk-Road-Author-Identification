				So the lady and I are headed to our first Burning Man in a month! <br /><br />&nbsp;I have 2 different 10 strips of LSD in transit right now, and a 1/4 of fungus.&nbsp; I already got sold 25i-nbome as LSD 5 months ago (by an acquaintance in person) and had the most horrible trip of my life on it. I plan on taking all this stuff to the Burn (going to give away the 25i-nbome to people who like that kind of thing.).<br /><br />As we ALL know, LSD is horribly degraded by HEAT.&nbsp; Every day at Burning Man the head exceeds 100 degrees.&nbsp; Are there any Burners out there who can give me some advice as to how you have stored LSD to make sure it stays in good shape while waiting to take it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve considered keeping it in the ice chest because it&#039;s cold and dark, but VERY fawking humid.&nbsp; I&#039;m just not sure what the best way to store it might be.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d definitely like to have some of my L in good shape for the Temple Burning!<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />One Love &lt;3

				Keep it in the cooler like you said but vacuum seal it in individual doses with a piece of paper wrapped around each dose before you vac seal. This way no humidity will get in. It will stay nice and dark and cold. This way you open only what you eat and the rest is still safely sealed. Make sure you vac seal it properly maybe even double seal just to make SURE they stay dry.<br /><br />Have fun

				Do you have one of those jars with an o-ring that snap closed? They&#039;re pretty effective at keeping moisture out. Maybe stick it in that in the cooler?

				Moisture and light are the big ones with L.&nbsp; I would use a jar as suggested and put a good sized sachet of silica gel in the jar to keep it really dry and wrap the outside in black tape.&nbsp; The silica gel can be dried out in an oven to &quot;regenerate&quot; it.<br /><br />I keep all my &quot;supplies&quot; in jars with silica gel to keep stuff as dry as possible. and it realy helps keep things perfect.<br /><br />hope you have a blast!

				Yeah I totally know what the stuff is, I just only ever get it when I buy a new pair of shoes, a bottle of vitamins, etc.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; -&nbsp; But it&#039;s always a surprise when I get them.. I never know exactly what items will contain these little packets.

				Get some epsom salts put them on a cookie sheet preheat your oven to 350F and stick the cookie sheet in the oven for about 30min I believe is sufficient or until its all white and like a cracker instead of salt like. Fill a cloth pouch haha or a sock with this. Throw it in a jar next to your L and that will keep it dry.<br /><br />But the only reason I didnt say a Maison jar before is besuse it is really bulk for just a little paper. And if someone where to look in the cooler it would catch someones attention more than a flat vacuum sealed bag. I did the double vacuum sealing deal inside of a false bottom coke can and I put that in the cooler for Bonnaroo. HAHAHA well actually I had a cooler full of false bottom coke cans. I had quite a collection of goods going to Bannaroo with me.

				Why did you have such a bad trip on 25i? What was wrong?

				Why did I have a bad trip on 25i?<br /><br />Well, for starters the body load was absoluetly horrible.&nbsp; I&#039;m was an acid head growing up and there is nothing better than some good clean acid (I haven&#039;t gotten a hold of any acid in 10 years and have my first strip coming in the mail today from SR!&nbsp; So excited.)&nbsp; So, yeah, the come up and body load felt horrible to me.&nbsp; THEN - the visuals.&nbsp; This is what made me so curious about this drug.&nbsp; I read thatyou can have amazing visuals with no head trip.&nbsp; Well, the visuals were very intense.&nbsp; But they were not the fun visuals I get on LSD.&nbsp; These visuals made me nauseous.&nbsp; For example, when I would turn my head, my visual field would strobe with about a half second delay.&nbsp; My entire visual field looked like I was in a wet water color painting.&nbsp; Nothing would hold still and I couldn&#039;t even keep my eyes open.&nbsp; I just ended up laying in childs pose (yoga posture with your legs and knees on the floor with your body laid over the top and your hands out over your head in front of you on the ground) for about 5 hours waiting for this whole trip to end.&nbsp; On top of that, I felt like I had injested a POISON.&nbsp; I could feel this nasty chemical in every pore of my body.&nbsp; I wanted it out so badly.&nbsp; THEN, I eventually started puking.&nbsp; That barely made me feel any better.&nbsp; I had brought a bowl up into my room with me for in case I started vomiting and sure enough, 4 hours in I started to.&nbsp; I threw up probably 4-6 times.<br /><br />I felt so &quot;bad&quot; in my body that I coudln&#039;t even lay in bed and let my girlfriend comfort me.&nbsp; That&#039;s how disgusting and uncomfortable I felt.&nbsp; And I&#039;m an EXTREMELY seasoned tripper.&nbsp; Been on well over 300-400 trips in my life on LSD and mushrooms.&nbsp; But this stuff was my worst nightmare.&nbsp; Not only did I have a horrible time on it, I woke up the next morning and was STILL hallucinating!&nbsp; The worst part about that was it made everything around me look &quot;dirty&quot; and crusty.&nbsp; It was so strange.&nbsp; In my shower, I could see EVERY spec of dirt and grime and it was completely exaggerated.&nbsp; I had a &quot;chemically poisoned&quot; feeling in my body and was &quot;hung over&quot; on this stuff the ENTIRE day and even woke up the next day still feeling a little assy and chemmed out.<br /><br />That stuff was just disgusting to me and my body and mind.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand how anyone could enjoy that stuff.&nbsp; Not even for a DOLLAR a hit.<br /><br />But to each his own.&nbsp; I read QUITE a few trip reports on 25i before I took it and it seemed that about half the people who ate that stuff did not enjoy it...&nbsp; But the people who DO like it, seem to love it.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;So I will take it with me to Burning Man and give it away to people who enjoy it.

				Are you sure that&#039;s really 25i? <br /><br />That doesnt sound like 25i but there again drugs affect everyone differently so maybe it is.<br /><br />How long did it last total?

				I&#039;ve taken 100 or so trips on LSD myself and was curious to take 25i myself and so I finally did last night. My experiences was great unlike yours, but I did feel jittery at first. I honestly think you didn&#039;t take 25i and it was DOI or some DOx. The duration for 25i is nowhere near what you described whereas something like DOI might be.
