				I have been looking around this board and the internet for days now trying to find some basic instructions on how to prepare H (and what type is best) for IV.&nbsp; I am not new to IV&#039;ing or opiates, and of course do not recommend this method to anyone, however, I do not want to make any mistakes when it comes to using H by IV. <br />I also wonder about the differences between#3 and #4.<br />There is no shortage of information about the smells, tastes and so on regarding H for smoking, so I would like to request this thread be mostly limited to injecting information only.&nbsp; Hopefully I am able to ask these questions and get straight forward instructions on how to prepare both #3 and #4 properly. (if it even is possible to inject both ). <br />I learned #4 is&nbsp; for snorting and IV only.<br />AGAIN MY MAIN QUESTION IS: HOW DO I PREPARE H FOR INJECTING IV?<br />Thanks in advance to anyone who contributes to this thread. <br />

				lol, youve been looking around for days?&nbsp; seriously? if you honestly had you would have found plenty of info.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7932<br /><br />search for heroin helper, and &quot;getting off right&quot; manual<br /><br />use resources on bluelight and opiophile forums for experiences/advice<br /><br />#4 is a the salt form, #3 is freebase and requires conversion using acid before it is water soluble

				Hi Londoner! I take it your in the UK? If you are, I would recommend getting your syringes yourself (trust the responsibility of getting clean syringes to yourself alone, it&#039;s the only way). You can go to any chemist which has the needle exchange sticker displayed in the shop window, this is a circle with two horizontal arrows pointing in opposite directions, one red and the other green. <br /><br />In there you can ask for either 1ml or 2ml syringes (as standard ten packs). 1ml have the smallest needle and are the most common ones used. 2ml have a few different needle sizes that can be attached and are used more for deeper veins. If your new to this I&#039;d recommend asking for a &quot;1ml pack please&quot;, you may have to fill out a data gathering form but you won&#039;t have to reveal any personal details on this. This 1ml pack will contain everything you need for injecting either #3 or #4, except water. Feel free to find some sterile water if you like, I personally used bottled water that has just been opened (but that&#039;s me).<br /><br />Firstly, make sure you have everything you need; the 1ml pack, some clean water and a lighter. It is then recommended that you clean you hands (with an anti-bacterial hand wash), the surface your using to prepare your shot, and also the area on your body that you&#039;ll be injecting into (with the little alcohol swabs you&#039;ll find in the 1ml pack).<br /><br />For #4:<br />&nbsp;<br />1 - Take your spoon (provided in 1ml pack),<br />2 - Add the amount of #4 you wish to use into the spoon,<br />3 - Take your 1ml syringe and suck up 70 units (0.7ml) of clean water into it,<br />4 - Squirt the water from your syringe into your spoon,<br />5 - Take your lighter and begin to slowly heat up the spoon, gently swirl the liquid around in the spoon by rocking the spoon. Don&#039;t let the liquid boil by taking your lighter away when bubbles form, and then putting the lighter back after it has cooled down for a few seconds, <br />6 - Once the liquid has turned completely transparent (or if the only bits that remain are some insoluble particles - cut), then sit the spoon down and add your filter (also provided in the 1ml pack),<br />7 - Suck up liquid though the filter into the syringe,<br />8 - Hold the syringe vertically with the needle pointing upwards. Tap the syringe until all the air is at the top and the push it out using the plunger. You may have to repeat this step until all air is gone,<br />9 - Finally, you can now inject the H (providing you wiped down the hit site with alcohol swab provided in 1ml pack).<br /><br />NOTE: some people would argue that you shouldn&#039;t need to heat the water for the #4 to dissolve. This is true of good #4. However, if you find that the #4 does not dissolve completely into the cold water, then heating will speed up the process. I believe heroin (#3 or #4) has a lower boiling point than water, so try to avoid boiling the liquid when cooking up. I&#039;d be interested if anyone could tell me if that&#039;s true.<br /><br />For #3:<br />&nbsp;<br />1 - Take your spoon (provided in 1ml pack),<br />2 - Add the amount of #3 you wish to use into the spoon,<br />3 - Open a packet of VitC (provided in 1ml pack), add to spoon at around 1 part VitC to 2 parts #3. You may need to add more later, but it&#039;s best to start with less and add more (because VirC damages veins due to it&#039;s high acidity), <br />4 - Take your 1ml syringe and suck up 70 units (0.7ml) of clean water into it,<br />5 - Squirt the water from your syringe into your spoon,<br />6 - Take your lighter and begin to slowly heat up the spoon, gently swirl the liquid around in the spoon by rocking the spoon. Don&#039;t let the liquid boil by taking your lighter away when bubbles form, and then putting the lighter back after it has cooled down for a few seconds,<br />7 - Your aiming to have the liquid turn transparent (if not 100% then at least 95% or so). If, after you&#039;ve gently heated the spoon a few times (for around thirty seconds in total) the liquid remains cloudy, you may need to add a pinch more VitC. Add the pinch, then heat up the spoon to near boiling (when bubbles begin to form), whilst gently swirling the liquid around the spoon. This should only take ten to twenty seconds. If the liquid is still cloudy then repeat this step, adding a further pinch of VitC and heating the spoon again. Keep doing this until the liquid turns transparent (some particles may always remain undissolved, that is the cut. But the liquid should never be cloudy). <br />8 - Once the liquid has turned completely transparent (or if the only bits that remain are some insoluble particles - cut), then sit the spoon down and add your filter (also provided in the 1ml pack),<br />9 - Suck up liquid though the filter into the syringe,<br />10 - Hold the syringe vertically with the needle pointing upwards. Tap the syringe until all the air is at the top and the push it out using the plunger. You may have to repeat this step until all air is gone,<br />11 - Finally, you can now inject the H (providing you wiped down the hit site with alcohol swab provided in 1ml pack).<br /><br />I hope you find this info useful. Remember, start small with your H dose and always have some responsible on hand, just in case. Be safe, have fun.&nbsp; :)

				First, laugh if you will, I had searched for awhile.Heroin Helper and all. Apparently I didn&#039;t look in the right place. Regardless, mm, I appreciate your feedback. As for ZATA(pardon the short form) Thank you for clarifying the difference between #3 and #4. As I said, I am not new to injecting or opiates, however, having someone set me straight on what i was sure the proper way to do things the day before I get my first shipment was very reassuring. I am a &quot;scratch your back, if you scratched mine&quot; kinda guy, so ZATA, if and when you find yourself in a jam(dispite how simple and well known your advice was), feel free to send me a PM and I will help you anyway I can. If anyone else has some advice, feel free to butt in. TY

				Also, just to clarify, #3 is for smoking only(unless treated as ZATA explained) then it is good for injecting. Can you sniff #3?<br />And #4 is good only for sniffing and injecting?

				What is the difference between Afghan raw #4 and refined China White #4?<br />Are they prepared for injection the same?<br />Is one stronger than the other(generally)?<br />For BTH, do I just put it in a spoon with water and heat it then filter and suck up?<br />What&#039;s the best for injecting?<br />What&#039;s the best for smoking?<br />Is opium just as fun to smoke?<br />Can you inject opium?<br /><br /><br />Any answers are appreciated!
