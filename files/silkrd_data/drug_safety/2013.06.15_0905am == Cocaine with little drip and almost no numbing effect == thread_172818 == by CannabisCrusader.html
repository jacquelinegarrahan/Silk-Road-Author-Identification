				Bought an 8 ball of coke from a local guy and he charged an extra 10 for it because he was saying this shit was way better than last time so I agreed to pay it. I had recently had stuff he sold my friends that had a strong drip and numbing effect with the drip, but this stuff has no drip and when I rubbed a little on my gums it had pretty much no numbing effect. Is this a sign of good coke, or it not being coke at all or what? Also, it feels like the coke I had before but less jitteriness and it lasted a little bit longer, also didn&#039;t burn at all.<br /><br />Any insight would be appreciated.

				Can be both. Or it is extremely good or it is fake.<br /><br />The only way to discern what is of the two is testing it (with equipment or on yourself).

				I&#039;ve never heard of coke with no numbing effect. I heard if it tastes salty, its probably baking soda or something else mixed with baking soda.
