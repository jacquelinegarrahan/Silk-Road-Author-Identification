				I have been curious and known about DMT for many years, but haven&#039;t had the nerve to touch the stuff although I could get it here or in real life from a buddy who does it all the time.&nbsp; I like to trip acid and sometimes mushrooms, but my only experience with smokable psychedelics was many years ago with Salvia Divinorum extract.&nbsp; My Salvia experience was way too intense and fucked up, although it didn&#039;t last long.&nbsp; I lost all grip of reality, saw some intense and realistic hallucinations and when I came to I was being held down to the floor by 3 friends and apparently I&#039;d been freaking out and foaming from the mouth.&nbsp; Needless to say it wasn&#039;t pleasant and I wouldn&#039;t want to do it again although I still have those vials somewhere.<br /><br />I kind of want to try DMT, but my buddy who does it is a very strange guy who does all kinds of hardcore drugs a lot more often than me, so I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m cut out for it since this same friend was also able to have positive experiences with Salvia.&nbsp; Is it as intense as strong Salvia extract or is it more chilled out?&nbsp; My friend insists it is more chilled out but I haven&#039;t ever taken it when he&#039;s offered because I&#039;m not so sure it would be for me just because it affects him that way.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a bad acid trip before, although I&#039;ve had some bad shroom trips, which is why I&#039;m still kind of on the fence with DMT, maybe I&#039;m hyping it up too much and shouldn&#039;t compare it to Salvia?&nbsp; What do you guys think?&nbsp; Should I give it a go or keep passing it up?<br /><br />Also in general how would you describe the effects of it compared to say LSD or other psychedelics?&nbsp; I realize these kind of drug trips can&#039;t really be explained in words accurately, but any opinions would be appreciated.<br /><br />+1 to all who reply

				Yes, by all means, you should! More chilled out than salvia? HA! No, it&#039;s just as intense, if not more. However, the trip has a much more warm feel to it, after the first hit from the pipe you get a warm rush over your body, colors become more vibrant, everything starts to shimmer and music sounds AMAZING. DMT is different from shrooms and LSD in the aspect that with the aforementioned psychedelics, you have to kind of guide your trip. With DMT, you are guided. Basically you get catapulted into a peak experience, which you should be ready for before you take it. I compare it to a roller coaster. You&#039;re in line, all anxious, and then you strap in and you&#039;re even more anxious and nervous/excited. Then it blasts off and you have an amazing intense experience and come back from it literally ~5-10 minutes later and you are back to baseline and you will be babbling about how that was the craziest thing you&#039;ve ever- and then you&#039;ll realize you can barely remember most of it. That would be a large dose though, once big enough to &quot;break through.&quot; I would recommend purchasing some DMT, and smoking a few smaller hits to get the feel of DMT land before diving headfirst. However you can&#039;t really get a feel for the real DMT land when you blast off into another dimension from the smaller doses, but you can get an idea. It&#039;s an incredible experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone in search of some deeper understanding (or utter astonishment) of the lives we live. A peak experience will change the way you look at life moreso than a heavy LSD/mushroom trip. You truly meet the divine, DMT is a connection to the spiritual realm that I never would have thought existed before using psychedelics.<br /><br />edit: Forgot to mention that I personally HATE salvia, however LOVE DMT. The salvia trip as I&#039;d explain is is just downright fucking weird. Not in a good way. In a weird, strange, fucked up way. I have had out of body experiences with both substances and can assure you the DMT trip is much much more pleasant.

				Yes, DMT is an amazing little substance. Every time I smoke it I am amazed at how fast your body is able to process it. I would describe it as you literally being able to feel it pass through your body and the high leave you. The post-peak is what I&#039;d imagine your &quot;soul&quot; leaving your body would feel like. IMO however, it is entirely unnecessary to educate yourself in terms of what you are too expect because words are always a disgraceful&nbsp; description of the experience. However, you should certainly know how to consume it. <br /><br />In terms of ingestion, a glass vaporgenie is the tool of choice for most experienced DMT smokers or a glass vaporizer that is similar. You use it in conjunction with a torch lighter (must be a torch lighter). If you so choose you can use the alternative of a bubbler or similar pipe. You should pack any smokable herb -- cannabis or parsley are usually recommended. Simply because many people like weed and people usually have parsley around already. You should pack a small base, then sprinkle 25-50mg of fluff evenly around, then sprinkle a thin layer of herb on top. Be sure to be inhaling when the flame is brought near the herb. The DMT should NOT be touched by the flame, the herb should spark and that heat vaporizes it. Take as many hits are&nbsp; you can before the rush onsets. Three is the magic number for a novice. <br /><br />After you have consumed it for the first time going back and reading others experiences with it makes a whole lot more sense.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126234.msg865554#msg865554">Quote from: sl1pknot on February 27, 2013, 07:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I would recommend purchasing some DMT, and smoking a few smaller hits to get the feel of DMT land before diving headfirst.

The first time I smoked it I did what you recommended and it still did nothing to prepare more for the never-ending wonders of hyperspace. It certainly is amazing small or heavy dose, eyes open or closed -- although with a big dose it doesn&#039;t matter whether your eyes were open or closed -- you&#039;re off!

Some incredibly vivid and lucid interactions with entities of sorts, some of the most beautiful visuals, feelings of being connected to everything in existence and some things i just am not able to put into words!<br /><br />This is the only method i use therefore the only one i can recommend. It is an expensive option but the GVG Sherlock is a thing of beauty

				I been smoking DMT all week, first time ever was last friday. Initially, yes, def do it.. but you said that salvia was too intense? If thats the case then DMT may not be for you. Not unless your absolutely ready for the kind of experience the Spirit Molecule give you.<br /><br />&nbsp;Just as I read before trying it, as im sure you have already...It is a psychedelic rocket ship, that blasts out of a cannon, on a B line directly for Mars. It is very intense, scary even.. but ultimately, it is the final frontier for the psychedelic&nbsp; experience, especially when smoked on the peak of a LSD or 2c-b trip. Utterly amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;So think long and hard about what your looking for, then make the wise choice. Much love dude. God speed

				please don&#039;t let your bad salvia experience keep you from trying dmt. completely different in all senses, except for their power<br /><br />salvia was the worst experience of my life, completely lost it for about 15 minutes and was convinced my entire life up to that point was just a play. some sort of complete ego loss I guess, looking back on it I definitely learned a lot about myself but would never repeat it,<br /><br />dmt is just pure beauty and I will gladly repeat the usage of it

				mhm, my belly says me, since you ask here, better wait till you can answer that question to yourself.&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br />BUT, the guys here are speaking just the truth .. its an amazing substance! amazing experience, amazing... well, i dont even know where to start or stop ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />of what you told of your salvia experience, maybe try to go with a real soft hit, even when many people advertise full blowns regulary. since a full blow is for sure the real &#039;cake&#039; of the dmt experience, i had lots and lots of absolutely beautiful and remarkable experiences with humans, landscapes, moments with very low doses of dmt ...... so that can work, too, in its own way, its worth a try, and surely not THAT impactful as a 20,25, 30,... 40mg dose vaped properly.&nbsp; u can jump in the waters deeper always, afterwards. <br /><br /><br />enjoy, if u do it, and try to take a look into the heart of creation. &lt;3

I would describe it almost like a waking dream if you fully breakthrough -- the only difference is that it is more chaotic and you KNOW you are tripping, unlike most dreams. <br /><br />Something important to any DMT user: you should never try to resist the experience, let your muscles and mind completely relax. It is so much more powerful than you are and you must respect this. It is very helpful to be in a meditative mindset before consumption. Your mind is a blank canvas and DMT is the paint. If you use a dirty, cluttered canvas (a distracted mind), the art won&#039;t be as good (the trip).<br /><br />Comparing DMT to salvia simply because it is smoked is ignorant. A non-breakthrough experience is similar to the closed eye visuals on a high dose of mushrooms. Mushrooms and DMT are very similar and combine very well together. Probably better than LSD, but hey, it&#039;s apples and oranges.

				Your right dude. When I said scaryy, I meant that nothing can prepare you for the rush you are experiencing, and so fast. It made my heart beat out of my chest, and I kept hyperventelating.<br /><br />&nbsp;All in all, its is the end of the line as far as psychedelics go. Utterly amazing stuff.
