				Yeah so I&#039;m sick of this blocked nose shit after a weekend of railing lines. <br /><br />I heard someone say recently to spray saline up there. Anyone else got some solutions they like to use?

				It really depends on how much you do.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a neti pot before, but was too stuffed up so it didn&#039;t do much. I had to get my sinus&#039; clear first (spicy food is a good way to do that), then use the neti pot afterwards and you should have better results.<br /><br />Still, don&#039;t expect miracles if you just inhaled a ball in 2-3 days.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried other stuff too (nasal sprays, vicks) but with no real results.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi <br /><br />Been there too many times and have tried everything from neti pot to q-tips and pipecleaners.<br /><br />Best result to this day is a nasal spray called DexaRhina - it contains cortisone, it works charms for me!<br /><br />Here it is non-prescription but dunno abt. other countries.

				Preventing it is the first step - So this starts with having cleaner coke with no active cuts. Or do a wash<br /><br />After a night, use saline water to clear out the nose.

				Take an aspirin to reduce the swelling in the nasal passages ,then maybe a little vic vapo rub or eucalyptus oil, or clove oil on your upper lip. Eat a few pepperoncini salad peppers if that fails, you might&nbsp; have done some damage in your sinuses so let them heal up naturally.<br />I dont recommend using a nasal&nbsp; flush ( nose enema ) unless you have one of those 1 way spray bottles with saline and moisturizers.&nbsp; This is because&nbsp; blasting my nose with water after doing lines caused me to develop a wicked ass cough that took forever to clear.<br /><br />BTW wash your toot straws out&nbsp; or throw them away - it a great enviroment for Streptococcus bacteria and strep throat sucks, found that out the hard way too

				Less cut = less blockage in my experience. But if you&#039;re cramming a gram or more a time up there it doesn&#039;t matter if its cut or not, it&#039;ll be blocked.<br /><br />I personally inhale about a tablespoon of distilled water through each nostril, makes my eyes water like crazy but clears my nose out pretty fast

				IMO, based upon long periods of no drugs in nose, and also regular but not constant insufflation of H#4, cocaine, meth:<br /><br />Stay away from any OTC nasal sprays with any active ingredients (anything other than just saline solution).&nbsp; These are extremely habit forming and if you enjoy putting fun drugs up your nose, you don&#039;t want to add that habit.<br /><br />I have never tried the pure nasal saline products, only a full neti pot routine.<br /><br />Neti pot is fantastic.&nbsp; Google it up on clearnet.&nbsp; I would universally recommend this to everyone, whether or not they ever insufflate drugs.&nbsp; There are a few crucial points regarding neti pot use:<br /><br />Always use distilled bottled water.&nbsp; NEVER use tap water.&nbsp; Heat the water up on the stove.&nbsp; NEVER EVER EVER USE HOT TAP WATER.&nbsp; Normal bottled water isn&#039;t the end of the world, but distilled is far less risky. <br /><br />You want the final temperature and salinity of the water to be similar to tears.&nbsp; Boo hoo.<br /><br />If you are too congested to make the neti pot process work, don&#039;t try.&nbsp; It will only make things worse.&nbsp; There is some catch 22 here for nasal drug users.&nbsp; But if it isn&#039;t happening, just abort mission.&nbsp; You need some flow or you aren&#039;t helping things.<br /><br />Fully exhaling all the water from your nose when you are done is a very important step.&nbsp; Any neti pot instruction will include these details.&nbsp; Don&#039;t skip this step!&nbsp; Even better, use the neti pot right before a proper aerobic/yoga/running workout.&nbsp; That will lead to amazing results.&nbsp; Still - don&#039;t skip the quick heavy exhale step before the workout.<br /><br />As far as unplugging the nose, I don&#039;t have much to offer.&nbsp; Sometimes snorting more drugs helps&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />

				Hot Sauce then Saline<br />or<br />Neti pot<br />or<br />stuff your nose with gauze (they have nose gauze) and leave it there for about 15 mins then rinse it with saline<br /><br />Blowing your nose hard can have negative outcomes, so I wouldn&#039;t suggest that<br />Drinking hot tea regularly promotes clear sinuses

				Otrivin with sea water and aloe helps a little. Taking an advil to reduce the swelling is a good suggestion (will try that myself, thanks)<br /><br />I agree thou, a little surprising you&#039;d ask for advice and then not look up neti pot before you get a little snarky. lol!<br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s &quot;rage day&quot; after a weekend of partying?&nbsp; :-\<br />Take it easy man. Take an advil, snort some water up your nose, blow like crazy, get some rest, eat a sandwich. <br />
