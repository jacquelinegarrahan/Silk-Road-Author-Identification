				I&#039;m not able to find a lot of information on this subject. Is there cross tolerance between MDMA and 2C-B? I took MDMA last night, and want to take 2C-B tonight. If there is cross tolerance, I&#039;ll wait another week. I&#039;m a patient man.

				There are a few threads on this swimming around but no go ahead.<br /><br />The only cross tolerance with 2C-B is mushrooms etc.<br /><br />You should seriously wait though until you take MDMA again, and take the 2C-B a few hours later. Mind blowing. On it&#039;s own, just a buzz.

				I just got the 2C-B in today, otherwise I would have taken it on the comedown. I do want to take it apart from anything else and see what it&#039;s like on it&#039;s own before combining it with other drugs though.<br /><br />

It makes you think about yourself a lot, and you can end up feeling quite depressed and bad, like a negative spiral, even if your life is great. But the MDMA first makes you happy and puts you in a positive frame of mind meaning the 2C-B only has positive effects.<br /><br />Anyway good luck, let us know what you think&nbsp; :) 2C-B is still one of my favorite drugs, despite everything.<br /><br />Also, it has a high tolerance from one day to the next, so don&#039;t take it two days in a row or you won&#039;t feel much the second day. But it&#039;s tolerance dies quickly (3 or 4 days and you&#039;re back to normal).

				You should be fine, be sure to try them together at some point, it&#039;s like they just multiply the effects of each other. One of my favorite trips!
