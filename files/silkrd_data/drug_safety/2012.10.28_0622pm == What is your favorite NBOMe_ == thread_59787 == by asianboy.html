				Definitely 25c!!! <br /><br />I myself prefer 25c over LSD or 25i any day.. lsd really warps me in a bad way the 25c doesn&#039;t.. <br />25i is fun but somewhat different of a body high I always get..<br /><br />

				C!!! I often administer C to noobs who have not tried any intensive psychedelic... in mid-mic doses (approx 600ug on blotter) it is very easy to cope with and ive seen it responsible for enlightening people to see patterning they were oblivious to, and despite seeing SOME individual trip their ever-loving balls off on what i&#039;d consider a light dose, none of them felt the anxiety and mind-fuckery experienced thru most triptamines

				I still can&#039;t get tripping hard off of those 600ug tabs.. I need around 1.6 to 2mg to have a nice trip., I wish I could get there on one of those tyler tabs or hardhustles..<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some tabs that have something to mask the taste of the nbome I&#039;ve been thinking about throwing up for sale for a while.. to make it taste anything other than the shit that it tastes like. <br /><br />Anyone ever find any NBOME tabs that DONT taste bad on SR?!<br />

				yea, takes me about 1.2-1.5mg to start gettin off myself, but some people are much more (or less) receptive than others. and concerning the flavor- if u dose as advised (like snuff in the upper lip) the taste isnt such a factor as it doesnt apply to your tongue

				Yup, I always go with the upper lip. <br />I feel like having used dipping tobacco for years in the past has made it harder to absorb in my lower lip..<br /><br />lol I got a complaint once about the tabs so I thought maybe they don&#039;t get absorbed that well when placed on the tongue.. turns out that dude was just straight eating multiple tabs and wasn&#039;t feeling anything!!! hahaha I almost shit when he was complaining about how they weren&#039;t working when he told me how he was dosing.

				Last night I experienced my first psychedelic trip on 25C-NBOMe (4 x 300 microgram) blotters. It was mind-blowing, like your body was being pierced by layers upon layers of pleasure, it was like orgasming for 6 hours (not exhaggerating). I would liken it to a transcendental, religious experience, music sounded fucking out of this world (I listened to Pink Floyd, Tame Impala, Spacemen 3, etc). And felt like I was learning about how the world came about, why people were different to each other, and how we were just wisps of energy twisting synergistically in the universe, really really great. Open eye visuals really intense, everything was breathing, I had a Pink Floyd poster on the wall (the one with the ladies sitting by the pool), I think I now understand why van Gogh painted the way he did. Only negative side effects, sweaty hands and feet, stomach cramps and sleeplessness, but so fucking worth it.
