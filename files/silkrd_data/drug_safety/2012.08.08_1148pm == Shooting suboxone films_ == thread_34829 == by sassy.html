			<dd class="postbody">
				recently i have been needing extra cash so i have been selling the majority of my suboxone prescription. but i still need a small amount every day. i came up with a logical idea and started shooting 1/4 of a suboxone strip per day. i must say that its easily equivalent to taking a whole one or more sublingually. so i guess my question is: am i safe to be doing this? i filter it twice every time and am very sterile.

				I find the oral dose of a fraction of a suboxone still does work for me, not so sure I&#039;d IV it. <br />Maybe take it on an empty/light stomache?

				im prescribed 24mg per day and used to actually take that much so i guess my tolerance is too high to take a really small amount. orally 1 strip does good for me all day but its much cheaper only having to take 1/4th! sooo 80x20=1600$ extra dollars per month just for selling my subs&nbsp; ;D thats a little more than i make at my job! lol

				It&#039;d&nbsp; be ballsy but you could ask for more, although it&#039;s cliche of an addict to push the doc for more drugs. Doc might know your pushing them. I don&#039;t know.<br />Good point, I&#039;ve never been prescribed so I don&#039;t know the tolerance buildup on suboxone.<br />I just feel like IVing it will only fight the craving for a short bit of time, but whatever works for you! Maybe a big initial boost works best

				Doesn&#039;t suboxone contain naloxone to make shooting it impossible?

I know its true for the clinics in my state, just wondering what the deal is in other places.&nbsp; When i was on sub, the max dose was 32mgs...
