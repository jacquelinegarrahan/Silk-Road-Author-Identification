				Title: <strong>MDMA off switch</strong><br />

				MDMA needs an off switch.&nbsp; The adrenergic stimulation lasts much longer than the serotonergic or dopaminergic, resulting in lingering side effects and maybe a hangover.&nbsp; Ideally, we would like to turn the MDMA &quot;off&quot; at that point to block the adrenergic effects.&nbsp; Also if we could block NMDA receptor stimulation, so much the better.&nbsp; For the most part, I &quot;turn it off&quot; by having a nice big breakfast.&nbsp; I mean, isn&#039;t that why God invented Denny&#039;s?&nbsp; <br /><br />But with regard to pharmacological measures, what do you think would be best?<br /><br />This is not exactly the same as asking about serotonin repletion, which is a subtly different topic.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of the following being advocated:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; SSRI&#039;s.&nbsp; Some lab evidence of efficacy, but I worry about &quot;dirty&quot; chemicals that have some SNRI activity.<br />2.&nbsp; Benzo&#039;s.&nbsp; Interesting drug.&nbsp; They do have an effect on central alpha receptors, seems like the lab data suggests the are central alpha stimulants?&nbsp; But some central alpha stimulants (eg Clonidine) reduce peripheral adrenergic activity.&nbsp; Benzo&#039;s are known to reduce peripheral adrenergic activity and is the recommended choice for amphetamine overdose.&nbsp; Unclear to me the effect on NMDA receptors.<br /><br />I wonder about the following:<br />1.&nbsp; Barbiturates (assuming they can be found) which I believe are NMDA antagonists.<br />2.&nbsp; Alcohol, which is an NMDA antagonist.<br />3.&nbsp; Seroquel, which is pretty much the all-purpose &quot;off switch&quot; for psychedelics, of which MDMA is an example, in my opinion.&nbsp; Seroquel does have activity at the NMDA receptor but it&#039;s not totally clear to me what it&#039;s doing there.&nbsp; It seems to reverse the effects of NMDA agonists in animal studies, which is probably not precisely what we want, although in itself that statement doesn&#039;t tell the whole story.&nbsp; It is a potent peripheral alpha blocker.&nbsp; It has mood stabilizing, anti-anxiety and sedative properties.&nbsp; <br />4.&nbsp; Other specific NMDA antagonists, eg Ketamine.&nbsp; &nbsp;(But NOT tramadol, which has been associated with serotonin syndrome.)<br /><br />I am actually the most interested in Seroquel, which arguably should be included in the stash of any intrepid psychonaut.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anybody tried it?&nbsp; What do you think?<br /><br />

				Barbiturates are positive allosteric GABA-A modulators, just like benzos.<br />Alcohol is an α7-nAChRs agonist, positive allosteric GABA modulator, 5-HT3 agonist, NMDA antagonist, AMPA antagonist, KARs antagonist, glycine agonist, an inhibitor of potassium, sodium and calcium ion channels, as well as adenosine reuptake.<br /><br />Alcohol is out of the question because its shitty pharmacology makes it unpredictable.<br />Benzos and barbs will calm you down and they work well for MDMA comedowns and hangovers.<br />I have never heard of MDMA stimulating NMDA receptors and I can&#039;t find anything about it online so NMDA antagonists are probably not the best idea for MDMA hangovers.<br />Seroquel is also an antagonist of the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT7, D1, D2, D3 and D4 receptors, which is probably not too helpful when coming down from a powerful SNDRI like MDMA.<br /><br />If it&#039;s the reduction of adrenergic activity you&#039;re after, why not simply try α- and/or β-blockers?

				Perhaps it&#039;s a good idea if you&#039;re within walking distance of one, but Denny&#039;s sounds like an awful idea if you have to drive.

				Eh never liked beta blockers in amphetamine overdose because of risk of peripheral vasoconstriction.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not the same but still.&nbsp; <br /><br />Coulda swore I read somewhere that the theory on MDMA neurotoxicity was due to NMDA receptor stimulation, but maybe that was just speculation or sumpin

				I see your point tho on using seroquel in a serotonin depleted state.&nbsp; Not exactly the same as using it to abort say an LSD trip

				I&#039;ve never seen any data on adrenergic release from MDMA.&nbsp; Does anyone have a link?&nbsp; I&#039;m really surprised to hear that MDMA causes an increase in (nor-)epinerpherine that lasts longer than the serotonin/dopamine increase.&nbsp; Certainly interesting.<br /><br />To sleep I just take a benzo such as Valium and go to sleep but then again I usually don&#039;t do that until long after taking the MDMA.

				This is the case with most drugs.<br />The euphoria ends before the excessive stimulation does.<br />Just a part of the drug. Use a benzo after the drug to help sleep.
