				So I ordered a sample of 2ci and there&#039;s very little info on erowid about it. I&#039;d like to hear from some regular users; any advice is welcome.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are there any safety tips you can impart? What kind of dose would you recommend for a beginner/lightweight; I&#039;m interested in a threshold/light dose.&nbsp; Is there any kind of loading protocol that you found beneficial? <br /><br />I&#039;m always with my husband when I take something who prefers to stay sober and play with me while I&#039;m rolling/tripping. So if you have any tips for him, please share!

What kind of dose would you recommend for a beginner/lightweight; I&#039;m interested in a threshold/light dose.&nbsp; Is there any kind of loading protocol that you found beneficial? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>2c-i is nice in that it requires very little preparation. It&#039;s my drug of choice, I don&#039;t drink, smoke or anything. 2c-i is all I want or need.<br /><br />The only preparation would be to eat light or not at all. Go with fruit and shit, no dairy or greasy food.<br />Take it on an empty stomach (no food for at least 4 hours prior).<br />As far as dosage goes I&#039;d say go with 10mg and then boost with another 5mg at the 2 hour mark.<br />The trip will last about 6-8 hours like that.<br />It has a 1 1/2 to 2 hour come up, so be mindful of that.<br />You wont really need supervision or anything as it&#039;s fairly clearheaded.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;ve found that while your tripping you can kick of the trip for a moment of near perfect clear-headedness, however trying to do this for too long seems to leave me confused once it catches back up. Basically, the trip will continue while you avoid it and once it pulls you back in you&#039;ll be all weird because you didn&#039;t flow with it. Just watch out trying to really push your brain too hard.<br /><br />Stay home, dont overload yourself, no uptown/downtown adventuring or anything.<br /><br />NO GREASY FOOD while tripping, it WILL make you ill.<br />NO WELLBUTRIN, if you take 2c-i and your on wellbutrin you WILL have a seizure.<br /><br />Other than that I&#039;ve never had any real issues, no nausea, no motion sickness, nothing but fun.

				What types of things should I expect taking 10mg?<br /><br />Also, would you still recommend 10mg if I told you that I found 100mg of mda to be way too much (can&#039;t remember most of that night)?

Most people take 15-20mg their first time.<br /><br />Things will flow, you may see little sprially and/or spinning patterns in the carpet or ceiling (especially if it&#039;s a popcorn ceiling) it&#039;s REALLY empathnogenic, and you might see trails if you move your hands. Stuff taste better, lights are brighter. They say it&#039;s like mild acid (without the mind part) and weak MDMA, mixed together. It&#039;s closer to MDMA (2c-e is the same but closer to acid).<br /><br />Really, it&#039;s just FUN. It&#039;s near IMPOSSIBLE to have a bad trip, it just makes you happy and feel good and close to people.<br /><br />I suggest some music and Popsicle (the jollyrancher ones are great) also sweetarts brand jellybeans, FUCKING AMAZING.<br />Have fun.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be checking back here quite regularly, so feel free to ask more questions.

				I am surprised no one has mentioned taking 2C compounds rectally. Its really the best way IMHO. The effects are more clearly defined and the side effects like body load and &quot;metal mouth&quot; are not noticable. <br /><br />Just last week I made a mix of MDMA and 2C-B, administered rectally, and had crazy visions. During my peak I closed my eyes and saw a rippled pattern like someone throwing stones into a sea of milk. Then a hand rose out of the milk and dipped back in a few times clutching at the surface. The hand when risen had milk pouring from between the fingers as if the palm was bleeding milk.<br /><br />Anyway, it may sound crazy, but try any 2C rectally. It is way better and not just because its faster or cheaper because you take less. Its just that it feels better.

				And the winner is ... 2c-b (even though I ordered 2c-i the day before). Ah well, can&#039;t argue with fate, lol. <br /><br />I got some jelly beans and popsicles, loaded an mp3 player with classical music, and will be watching Hugo while I wait for it to kick in.

				So I took some 2c-b (orally) last night. It has a pretty long come-up and the visuals were fun at first. I marveled this world map as the colors swirled like playing with liquify in photoshop. <br /><br />Except I was counting on less to no visuals with some bodily sensations, especially at a threshold dose (there were none). I was cold so I think it ended up making me feel colder no matter how many blankets I was wrapped in. And eventually the CEV&#039;s started to disturb me so much that I started to stare at the map to avoid them. <br /><br />I&#039;m still debating on whether or not I want to try the 2c-i since this one was supposed to be closer to mdma and I wasn&#039;t feeling it. They also say that 2c-i has more visuals which I&#039;m not all that interested in. I just want an mdma-like stubstance that wont put me out of commission for the 30 or so hours after come-down; mostly makes me tired and drained the next day.

				They say 2c-i is like a mix of mild acid and mdma, but it favors the side of mdma.<br />2c-e favors the side of acid.<br /><br />Hope you have fun, visuals are my favorite part.<br />Also, when you say &quot;tossed&quot; you dont mean you actually threw it away do you?&nbsp; :o

				The visuals were fun at first but it started to make me anxious when the CEV&#039;s started to get very vivid. <br /><br />Yeah, I threw the rest of the 2c-b away, was only about 80mg left and was doing nothing for my husband. <br /><br />So we&#039;re on to 2c-i finally. I hope it&#039;s more like mdma than 2c-b.
