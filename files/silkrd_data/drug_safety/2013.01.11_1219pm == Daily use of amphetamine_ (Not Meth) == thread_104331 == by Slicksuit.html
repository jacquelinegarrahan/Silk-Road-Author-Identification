				To start off a thank you to everyone who comes in to the thread to help, I appreciate it. <br /><br />Anyway, a friend of mine (really a friend, not one of those things where a friend means myself) has started using amphetamine sulphate daily. <br /><br />It&#039;s very pure stuff, maybe 75%-80% and he is only taking 40mg daily, which works out to be like 32mg of actual amphetamine per day and obviously aphet sulphate is a 50-50 mix of dextro and levro. <br /><br />He isn&#039;t addicted (and I doubt he will get addicted, I can see him dropping this after about two weeks), he is purely doing it for bodybuilding purposes as he has to shed about 25-30lbs for a competition. <br /><br />His nutrition is on point, very very high protein, all the vitamins and what not he needs, and is still sleeping between 7-9 hours a night. <br /><br /><br />I was just wondering how much damage could he be doing to himself? his brain?

				Well at such low doses i think he will be fine. Remember Add kids get more mg a day than he does. When i used meds for add i took 200 mg a day of racemic amphetamine. The onl thing he should remember is to take extra care of his teeth cause even though it is a small amount his mouth will probably be a bit dryer and that will accelarate tooth decay.. That being said nothing is completely risk free..

				IF hes not snortin, or shootin it should be alright. ppl with adhd/add eat more than that. gettin off can be hard but its not physical addiction, its all in the mind. <br />tell him that&nbsp; he should stop right away if he experiences paranoia or hallucinations. symptoms of psychosis. everyone reacts differently to substances. maybe stopping for a few days right now would help determine the level of addiction he has developed. Just checkin if its anything bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />but i think there should be no problem.
