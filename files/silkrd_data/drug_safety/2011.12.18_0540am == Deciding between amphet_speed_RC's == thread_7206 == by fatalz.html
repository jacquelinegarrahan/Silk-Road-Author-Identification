				So Ive been doing adderall/vyvanse for years but always have a shitty<br />Comedown where I can&#039;t sleep and feel like shit, so I&#039;m thinking of adding another drug into my collection. Also, addys are getting harder to find for $5 and under and I&#039;d rather not pay the prices on here.<br />The drugs I&#039;m checking out right now are speed (from mr amsterdam), or a speed paste, or dex pills or those zztop pills (thought dex are expensive also, and aren&#039;t the zztop meth and not speed?), I&#039;m also checking out 2-FA as I&#039;ve heard good things, but just on df and erowid.<br />So my question is this, do you guys have any recommendations for drugs/sellers. Oh I just got a shipment of modafinil in that I am also trying right now, not experiencing great results though, think im looking for amphets.

				sup bro, my 2 cents:<br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend the RC&#039;s, they are not scheduled for a reason.<br /><br />If you want to get high I would go with vmm&#039;s cma.&nbsp; very pure, very clean. your hair will be tingling.&nbsp; His shit will fuck you up!<br />&nbsp;<br />If you want to get work done then mrouid&#039;s pills are the bomb.&nbsp; From my experience they feel like a high dose of +/-amphetamine sulphate, perhaps mixed with a small bit of meth, but they provide hours of very good concentration, much like Dexedrine, but a lot longer lasting, and with very smooth comedown.<br />I&#039;ve had the paste once, it was ok, but it took a full gram to get me where I wanted to be, and who knows what else is in that shit.<br />If you are dabbling in stims sleep will be a problem no matter what, I recommend waking up wicked early to dose if you want to get to bed like a normal functioning member of society.<br />--namaste<br />&nbsp;

				Thanks for the reply. I&#039;ve been researching for a while now, trying to decide on a few different ones. <br />I&#039;ve decided I don&#039;t really want to get into meth lol after reading up on it (maybe read too many horror stories?)<br />I&#039;m down to these products now:<br />1) ZZ Top Speed Pills - he says he doesn&#039;t know the ingredients which worries me, though I remember seeing someone say they tested pos for meth. But are they pure meth or speed with just a bit mixed in as you said?<br />2) Speed (either 1g from Blaatz0r, or 5g from DrAmsterdam), I&#039;ve never tried speed, but I&#039;ve heard it pretty much the same as adderall since they are both amphetamines.. is this correct?<br />3) Amphetamine Paste (10g from Der Speed Doktor), not sure on this as you said it took a lot, and he doesn&#039;t have a % listed, though he says it&#039;s &#039;more pure than anything listed&#039;. I&#039;ve found mixed reviews about paste in general also.<br /><br />If I can&#039;t decide I&#039;ll probably end up getting the pills first, then about a week later getting the speed and seeing how they match up. I&#039;m really just looking for a drug to occasionally take for all night parties etc (so maybe once week usually). Right now I use adderall, but as I said before, it&#039;s hard to find sometimes and the comedown isn&#039;t always the best.<br />
