				I&#039;d always read that you had to hold the saliva in your mouth for like 20-40 minutes while you had NBOMe tabs in your mouth, but I&#039;ve now been told this is not true if you are putting them on your gums.<br /><br />There&#039;s loads of people taking NBOMe here, are you all swallowing your saliva like normal? Why the hell did &#039;keeping your saliva in your mouth&#039; catch on in the first place if it&#039;s not true?

				Probably some daft attempt at keeping the Nbome &quot;in the mouth&quot;...<br /><br />I find the easiest way is to put it in the buccal pouch, ie. between cheek and gum (lower molars). It&#039;s out of the way, doesn&#039;t fill up with saliva, stays there comfortably. Have since seen several reports (Erowid &amp; elsewhere) saying this is the &quot;best place&quot; too.<br /><br />Dissolving it with a little MXE and snorting the dried residue is even better...

				Brush your teeth and use mouth wash.. Best place is in the gum line but under the tongue works well too.. <br /><br />YES, keep the saliva in your mouth as long as you possibly can .. NBOMEs will not work if you swallow them.. Look it up.. The longer you keep the saliva and the tab in your mouth the more of it you absorb.. It&#039;s not like LSD in that regard.. If you swallow LSD it will come on.. some times to a much lesser extent, but will come on.. NBOMEs WILL NOT<br /><br />DO NOT TAKE SSRIs or MAOIs with NBOMEs !!!

You&#039;re the one that told me about the MXE and 25i. 25i seems to be a no go for me, tried like 3 times and the most I got was like a body high which was weird as fuck since I had no visuals or mental shit. I might just have to try like 4mg at once :/

				The best thing to do is to focus on not making too much saliva. Just let the tab sit against your gum and your lip without getting super wet.

				If I&#039;m correct the only way for nbome to cross the blood brain barrier is buy absorbing it. Hence keeping saliva in your mouth so that it absorbs everything.<br /><br />Chaos
