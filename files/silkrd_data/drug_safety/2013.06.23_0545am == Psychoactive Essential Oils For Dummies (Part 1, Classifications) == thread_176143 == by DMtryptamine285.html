				A essential oil is a liquid concentrate of the volitile aromatic compounds contained within a plant. essential oils have been used medicinally at different times in history for everything from skin conditions, insomnia, and depression, to cancer and other life threatening illnesses. Aromatic compounds have long been known to induce biochemical changes in the body, so it is only natural that in this extremely broad range of compounds, there are compounds which will have an effect on the mind as well.<br /><br />similar to the diverse range of well known classes of psychoactive compounds (tryptamines, phenethylamines, ergolines, benzos, ect...) there are many different classes the aromatic compounds can be devided into based primarily on chemical structure. we will focus here on the primary classes of psychoactive essential oils.<br /><br />Diterpines<br /><br />A diterpene is a type of terpene, it is an organic compound composed of four isoprene units and has the molecular formula C20H32. They derive from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.<br /><br />Diterpines are only recently being recognized for there psychoactivity. One of the most biggest discoveries of psychoactive diterpenes is the case of salvinorin A (from salvia divinorum). It is believed that coleus and many other &quot;mildly psychoactive&quot; plants contain low levels of highly active diterpenes. It has long been assumed that alkaloids where the main psychoactives found in nature, however this is not true, In a way the discovery of salvinorin A changed everything we thought we knew about psychoactive plants.<br /><br />Allylbenzenes<br />&nbsp; <br />Allybenzenes are organic compounds that have an alkyl group bound to a benzene ring. These compounds are often used in industry (toluene), and can be found in many essential oils (myristicin, elemicin, Methyl-chavicol, ect).<br /><br />Myristicin, elemicin, and methyl-chavicol have been referenced by some independant researchers and a few publishing scientists as having psychoactive and perhaps even psychedelic effects.<br /><br />According to theories proposed by anonymous researcher 69ron, these allylbenzenes are deactivated by certain enzymes which need to be inhibited to attain psychedelic effects, these results have been confirmed by many psychonauts, although there are some who still claim that no matter what method they use, still get what 69Ron discribed as &quot;the melatonin effect&quot;, this may be due to a persons individual metabolism, and perhaps other factors are involved as well.<br /><br />Monoterpines<br /><br />monoterpines are simply a class of terpenes that consist of two isoprene units and have the molecular formula C10H16. Monoterpines have various industrial and medicinal uses, and some monoterpines may be psychoactive.<br /><br />there have been studies that have shown many monoterpines act in a similar way to classical sedatives. The following compounds have been shown to have a sedative effect.<br /><br />Isopulegol (1), neoisopulegol (2), (+/-)-isopinocampheol (3), (-)-myrtenol (4), (-)-cis-myrtanol (5), (+)-p-menth-1-en-9-ol (6) and (+/-)-neomenthol<br /><br />Lavender oil, Baccharis uncinella oil, Tea tree oil, Yarrow oil, and so many other oils contain various monoterpines which may or may not be psychoactive. Valarian contains non-volitile monoterpines which may explain its sedative effects.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Psychoative essential oils classified by effect<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sedatives</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>vetiver oil<br />Rue oil<br />Lavender oil<br />Coriander seed oil<br />Casimiroa pringlei oil<br />Clary Sage oil<br />Celery oil (mild)<br />Anise oil (depending on metabolism, may potentially be metabolised into a psychedelic with inhibitors)<br />Chamomile oil<br />Passionflower oil<br />Jasmine oil<br />Neroli oil<br />Sandlewood oil<br />marjoram oil<br />among many others<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Stimulants </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Betel Leaf Oil (Chavibetol, Chavicol, Hydroxychavicol)<br />Bay leaf oil (Chavicol)<br />Sassafrass oil<br />Various other allylbenzenes (allylbenzene, 3,5-Dimethoxyallylbenzene)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Psychedelic oils </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Parsley seed oil (Apiole, myristicin, tetramethoxyallylbenzene)<br />Crowea saligna (Croweacin)<br />Dill seed oil (Dillapiole)<br />Russian terragon oil (elemicin)<br />elemi oil (elemicin)<br />Nutmeg oil (elemicin, myristicin)<br />Calamus oil (Gamma-Asarone)<br />Sweet basil oil (methylchavicol)<br />french terragon oil (methyl-chavicol)<br />Tegetes Lucida oil (Methyl-eugenol)<br />Mexican Allspice (methyl-eugenol)<br />Nutmeg oil (myristicin, elemicin)<br />Sassafras oil (Saffrole)<br />Piper affinis hispidinervum oil (Sarisan)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NMDA antagonists</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Acorus gramineus oil (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11253173)<br /><br />Keep in mind that these have not all been tested with ingestion as a route of administration, the most common method is aromatherapy or topical application, these compounds are aromatic and thus can be active via inhalation, and aroma therapy likely does induce biochemical changes due to the presence of these active compounds. Lately many independant researchers and even some publishing scientists have noted that ingestion of these oils causes an even greater effect, further evidence for aromatherapies effect being a result of the chemical components of the essential oils used.<br /><br />However some essential oils have been found to be carcinogenic (although in massive unrealistic doses) and some have been found to negatively effect liver function (although no more dramatically than alcohol)...one must keep in mind these compounds are still relatively unexplored. As I have said before, there is a risk assumed with ingesting psychoactives of any kind and one should be prepared for both the positive and negative effects of any such action<br /><br />Part Two: Introduction to Enzyme Inhibitors, Allylbenzene activation, and oilahuasca

				Haha yeah, I work with isolating aromatic compounds and many of them are psychoactive. Almost want to team up with a vendor on here to bring the a whole new pharmacopoeia to the road, not to mention get free test subjects.

				^^ Great idea! I&#039;ve been using essential oils for many years and have a nice library, but this is all new to me!
