				A few days ago I tried Crystal Meth for the first time. I&#039;m a semi-regular to regular Amphetamine user user, but not Meth.<br /><br />I went through around 1/4 gram in 2 days (no sleep, but food, etc). Crushed and insufflated.<br /><br />From around towards the end of the use and up until now my left hand has been numb/tingly at the base in the karate chop area. Haven&#039;t had any noticeable heart attack symptoms or anything else concerning besides this, but it hasn&#039;t ceased at all even after a full night&#039;s sleep and it&#039;s very noticeable.<br /><br />Thoughts anyone?<br /><br />

				I get the same thing, soreness in the muscles and what not. I also get tingling in my hands and feet, so I&#039;ll walk around to get the blood flowing. Two days ago i went through half a gram in about two hours. The tingles, is really just your body&#039;s way of telling you that you got really high off meth i guess haha. If it progresses to painful stinging, that&#039;s what you got to worry about.

				A couple days onwards, it&#039;s still kind of noticeable. But it seems to be wearing off slowly, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Nice to see this is in fact fairly common and not some serious sign that I&#039;m about to die of a heart attack.<br /><br />Perhaps some kind of temporary neuropathy? due to just getting really high...?

Sometimes, it&#039;s because i haven&#039;t ate and my sugar is low and i need some carbs also. Other times, even when i eat i get tingling. I have noticed though, the more i stay hydrated while high, the tingling dosn&#039;t seem to linger as long.

				First off, to the best of my knowledge Meth does not have vascular constrictive side effects, I believe it might even dialate the circulatory paths slightly.<br />As for the numbness , you more than likely pinched a nerve in your back or shoulder while on your tweekfest and was too high to notice at the time, staying up and shit like that gets rough on your joints n muscles sometimes.<br /><br />In the 15ish years I spent deep in the dope circles of So Cal, I never have seen or knew of anyone that suffered a heart attack from doing the shit. My 70 year old uncle would do shit for days n days and he never suffered any heart ailments, hell he was in way better shape than every other guy his age too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pop a couple aspirins if your worried, go see the doctor . If he gives you crap about doing dope, tell him you only asked for his professional opinion about your heart.<br />
