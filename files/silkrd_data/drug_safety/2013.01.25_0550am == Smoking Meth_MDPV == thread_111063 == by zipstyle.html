				After doing a quick trial of this in the name of having the experience, <br />I decided that it wasn&#039;t worth the trouble. The MDPV provided a pretty decent euphoria for 30 minutes or so but I wasn&#039;t terribly impressed. It was a small dose (about 4-6 mg) put on foil and then chased.<br /><br />Then with meth, I barely felt anything to be honest. Maybe I used too little, maybe doing it off of foil is really inefficient (even though I&#039;m pretty experienced with foil). Either way, I have concluded that I won&#039;t be doing this again. Unless maybe I roll a joint and put a little MDPV in there. I think some of it would burn up but the stuff towards the back should vape. Might be enjoyable. Other than that, I didn&#039;t really see the appeal of vaping these chemicals. Taken orally or intranasally are much more enjoyable in my opinion. <br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d put this out there and wrap it up with a question: why is it that so many people love smoking these drugs? Does part of it have to do with the way that I smoked (off of foil)? If you enjoy smoking these, explain what is most appealing about this ROA.<br /><br />Thanks!

				This is an interesting question. I have smoked meth and I can see both sides of the equation. I definitely get a different feel if I smoke meth but at the same time I feel that I usually need to load a bit, if in glass, or need to be especially careful, if on foil, to get a really large hit--which I feel is the goal to experience as much of a &quot;rush&quot; as possible. I have attributed my lack of being impressed due to my technique previously but I am curious as to what others have to say about this or how others feel when smoking versus snorting, etc. I feel smoking could potentially hit you faster, I personally can&#039;t get, say, 20mg of crystal vaped at once to inhale--it takes time for me to vape that much while I can easily bump a small line like that. <br /><br />So I second this question and hope to hear from some of the more experienced dragon-chasers in the forum

				I&#039;ve been thinking about this recently. There really isn&#039;t much of a &quot;rush&quot; to speak of when smoking meth, especially when compared to heroin which gives you a nice rush with every inhale. Snorting meth definitely gives you the bigger rush.<br /><br />But one would assume that smoking gives the quickest route to the brain, so this doesn&#039;t make too much sense. As Snoopish said, this is probably because when vaping it takes quite a while to get a full dose into your system. I have good foil technique (I find foil to be better for big hits than a pipe - if you got the skills!) but even then, when my lungs are at full capacity I think I must only have inhaled maximum 10mg of vapor. I only feel a rush if I do one of these huge hits on zero tolerance.<br /><br />However, there is something more immediate and satisfying about smoking. Every time I have a bit of crystal, I know from experience that I get a nicer rush and longer high when snorting it, but I always end up smoking it unless I have a large bag and feel extravagant. There is something physiological happening when you smoke that makes it more appealing even though the high is mellower and shorter.<br /><br />For me, I just love the smoking ritual and I like being able to space out 100mg over the night instead of blasting it in one go.

One of my friends has used a similar sentiment regarding the ritual of smoking meth. I think there is some appeal to the process of preparing your intake method (bowl or foil) and your product and setting up your environment (I typically play some really dark or melancholy music and maybe dim the lights so there&#039;s only candle light) before beginning the journey of smoking. Yes it does take longer, but for me I enjoy the long process of preparation and then using while letting the music play in the background to beckon me deeper into the fog/abyss/wherever you aim to go with your drugs. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t smoked for about a month now. It&#039;s just not a constant thing to do for me but it is nice in some sense. <br /><br />Cheers.

				this is always been an interesting topic to me, I am a regular meth user usually every two weeks i get some and i&#039;ve noticed i like rotating between smoking and snorting, sometimes i just don&#039;t feel like the burn in the nose and the nasty drip but sometimes smoking just doesn&#039;t appeal to me either, its like i&#039;ll do one or the other for 6months and then switch.&nbsp; If the shit is good i get the rush either way but there&#039;s a lot of cut shit on the street i&#039;ve had pretty good luck with vendors here out of all my orders which for meth are probably 35-40 about 80% were very good stuff and 90% were acceptable stuff, only about 10% was shit i wish i hadn&#039;t bought so i think alot of the key for having a good experience is getting good gear, then the ROA is a matter of taste because if its jet fuel its going to rocket you up no matter what.

				zipstyle, <br /><br />Smoking meth can be very intensely enjoyable-- I have to respectfully disagree with the other posters that smoking meth doesn&#039;t give you a rush. If you don&#039;t get a rush, either you&#039;re not doing it right, or you&#039;ve re-dosed too many times and are already too spun.&nbsp; <br /><br />Technique-- using tin foil isn&#039;t the best way to vaporize meth -- it can be disappointing because you can easily not get enough.&nbsp; It&#039;s better to smoke H this way because it rolls down the foil, but you don&#039;t want meth to do that.&nbsp; The best way to smoke meth is with a ball pipe, or, my favorite, a light bulb vaporizer.&nbsp; Most good meth pipes are just a long glass tube with a round chamber at one end, and a little hole at the top.&nbsp; You drop a big shard into the round chamber, and you heat it until it liquifies, then vaporizes.&nbsp; A thick white cloud will begin to billow up and swirl around the pipe chamber.&nbsp; Inhale it slowly and deeply-- keeping the air moving through the pipe aids the vaporization as you continue to apply heat.&nbsp; The idea is to get as much of that thick vapor/smoke as you can in one enormous hit.&nbsp; If you do it early on, like after your first rail, then the rush is absolutely amazing.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as prolonged as doing a line, but if you don&#039;t know how great this feeling can be, you&#039;re missing out.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />My first few times I used a light bulb vaporizer (there are DIY pages on clearnet on how to make one, it&#039;s easy) and because it has more inner surface area, I could crush the crystal, spread it around, apply heat and vaporize it all at once.&nbsp; I found it is most intense when I&#039;ve already done my first or second rail, and I&#039;m still coming up.&nbsp; Without being too graphic, a big puff at that point can be like an explosion of sexual desire, especially if I&#039;m looking at porn.&nbsp; The only thing more intense than that is shooting it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The intensity of a meth high has diminishing returns after re-dosing enough times without coming all the way back down.&nbsp; Once you get to that point, smoking it just prolongs the high, rather than giving you the rush.&nbsp; So do it early, or a few hours after your last line. <br /><br />If snorting crystal is like cake, then vaporizing it is the icing and the cherry on top.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />I have yet to try smoking MDPV.&nbsp;
