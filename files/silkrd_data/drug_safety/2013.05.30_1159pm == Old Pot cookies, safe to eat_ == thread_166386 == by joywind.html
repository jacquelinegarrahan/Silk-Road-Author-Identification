				OK so I have these old cookies made with cannabutter. They were in my basement for like 5 months. Unrefridgerated. But I&#039;m looking at them, and there&#039;s no mould. They seem stale, but they smell normal.<br />Is it OK to eat them?<br />What&#039;s the worst that could happen?

				i mean they are full of sugar. maybe the sugar will prevent microbial growth because by dehyrdrating the microorganisms that try to grow in the cookies...i dont know...... but i dont want to get sick... but at the same time i&nbsp; need to get high.

				They should be safe as long as there&#039;s no mold. They might be a little stale/hard. You can always grind them us in a blender and make a drink out of it if they&#039;re too hard to chew ;)

				As far as the cannabis in them goes they will be okay - no worries about that degrading into something dangerous.<br /><br />When in comes to they actually being edible as cookies, i suppose it is up to you. They may have become too brittle to eat by now, but they should still be effective if you manage to get them down the hatch in some way or another. <br /><br />Mold is generally not a problem for baked-try cookies like these, they simply do not have enough water to sustain mold growth unless you keep them in a really damp place. If you do see any sign of mold growth you should obviously discard them, but in my experience these things have an almost eternal shelf life unless you store them in a condensing environment.
