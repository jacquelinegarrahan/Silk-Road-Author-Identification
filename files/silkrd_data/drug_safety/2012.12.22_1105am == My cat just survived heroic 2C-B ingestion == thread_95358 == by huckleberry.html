				Hi,<br /><br />i just want to write down this little story, that has happened&nbsp; to me last night.<br /><br />A couple of days ago, i have ordered 3 caps of bees around 20 mg each. Received my order yesterday and got even one extra cap in the package. After unpacking the stuff, i just turned away for few seconds to get my scale to check the weight, and switch on the pc to release my btc and do a review.<br />In this time my cat (6 years/ male) must have jumped on the table, and got one of the capsules.<br />When i turned back, i only saw and heard&nbsp; the cat chewing. I&#039;ve done a quick search over the table - there was only 3 caps left.<br />Another one was found cracked up but still containing powder. <br />From this moment on, i really freaked out. Major panic-attack !!!&nbsp; I jumped off running after the cat screaming: &quot;what have you done!!, you&#039;re gonna die!!&quot;<br />I try to catch him to look if&nbsp; it has something left in its mouth or throat. Also the cat freaked out because of my strange behavior. It was biting and scratching me when i try to catch it.<br />It was so scared of me, that it shits on the floor and starts hissing at me like hell.<br />I have tried to make it vomit, by throwing a teaspoon of salt in its mouth when it&#039;s hissing at me. After that major freakout of us both, he hides behind the couch. Maybe 15 mins later it was able to vomit a little bit, but the cap was maybe already digested. It did&#039;nt came out. I&#039;ve tried to calm him down.<br />After a while, the cat was just sitting in a corner very apathetic with huge pupils and kind of scared. I have really thought he will die at this moment.<br />I have taken it next to me, to talk to him and pet it, to calm the cat down and give him some good company.<br />By this time it was maybe 1.5 hrs after ingestion, and due to quicker metabolism it must have been on the peak. All the time,<br />i&#039;ve checked its breathing and heartbeat and behavior all the time.<br />during the peak it was very lethargic, lying on the floor without any movement, just staring in the empty space in front of it. Poor little cat, i am really curious what it was seeing. It must have halucinating strong by the way it looks by this time.<br />Meanwhile it was about 3 hrs after ingestion, and i have done a little research about LD/50 for 2C-B that calmed me a tiny bit down. My cat has around 4 kg and ingested maybe 20 mg. So it was 5 mg /kg. The LD50 for mice was around 100-120 mg/kg.<br />But i felt like a little piece of shit, letting get my pet get in this situation. Normally i am a very responsible person who cares a lot, not letting stuff lying around, specially due to my cats &quot;addiction&quot; to plastic-foils, baggies and tape.<br />After about the 6 hrs mark i was relativly safe, that the cat will survive this experience somehow. Even my wife and i start making little jokes about the hard tripping cat. First time trippsitting a cat. But we were both very sorry for that little guy, trippin his (formerly existing) balls off. By that time, the cat also starts to relax and pupil dilation was minor than before. We were happy that he starts moving a little.<br /><br />This morning that cat is mostly fine. It has eaten and drunk a little bit but is still scared entering parts of our apartment. It seems to be still suffering a bit from the after-effects but getting better hour per hour. <br />What a hell of a night !<br /><br />So if you have pets take care. I will never again let something lying around, even for a second. I am glad as hell my cat survived this heroic dose of 2c-b.<br /><br />Stay safe<br /><br />Huck

				OMG I just assumed that you were swimming. That when you said cat you were referring to yourself!<br /><br />Poor cat, I&#039;m glad all is well again now. I would have been terrified if it was my cat.<br /><br />Just give it plenty love and stroke it &#039;til it purs again.
