				Ordered a small batch of white no. 4 heroin, won&#039;t order again, as I know about the addictive potential.<br /><br />Still the first attempt was a major disaster:<br /><br />First I was very cautious insufflated with a straw (will never inject drugs i.v.) and eyeballed a tiny amount, I guess 10-20 mgs, after a couple of minutes hardly any effect even though I was pretty sure this was strong stuff and I have no tolerance (no user), so I tried a similar amount again, then maybe some drowsiness. Then some more, ok, then I was pretty drunk. Worse things were to come. In the night and the next morning I woke up, massive vomiting (I know this is typical without opioid tolerance), but the last time I was so messed up I had ordered a gram of medical grade opium and ate the whole gram (!) in an afternoon. I guess I might have insufflated 100 mgs at most, but with relative little immediate effect, a buzz, a slight drunken feeling but not much more, but than the whole next morning I was running to the toilet throwing up. And in the early morning before that I was in such deep sleep i was glad to have woken up alive when I did, like comatose. What really astonished me was the delayed effect, like isn&#039;t insufflation supposed to reach peak effect in 30 minutes or an hour, and not 8 hours later next morning?<br /><br />So is this just a result of first time, or how do you get the dosage correct?<br /><br />Second question: The stuff is sticky like sugar, sticks in your sinuses, even sticks on your credit card or spoonn when you try to grind it fine (not that that ever really works), then it sticks to whatever surface you have ground it on and you can&#039;t suck it up. Then I had nasty mucous coming from my membranes 3 days afterwards, sticky, unpleasant.<br /><br />Is there any advice to this, like dissolving it in water before insufflation, mixing it, or whatever?

				It doesn&#039;t sound like #4 white.&nbsp; It sounds more like someone has given you fentanyl.&nbsp; Fent is probably the most powerful opiate made.&nbsp; They commonly cut 10mg of Fent with 990mg of lactose to stop people from killing themselves outright.&nbsp; That would explain the sugary leftovers.<br /><br />Did you get this stuff off of SR?
