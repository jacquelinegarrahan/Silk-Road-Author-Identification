				It seems, based on a few recently conducted studies, that mephedrone causes permanent recognition impairment in rats and temporary serotonin depletion (&lt;10 days)<br /><br />http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045473<br />5-HT = Serotonin<br /><br />Repeated high doses of MMC (4×10 or 4×25 mg/kg, I.P., once every 2 h), paired with elevated ambient temperatures (≥27°C), depleted 5-HT when measured 7 days later in rats [10]. This is an effect reminiscent of that seen with high doses of MDMA in laboratory animals [25], [26], [27], [28], although controversy continues as to the significance of such effects for humans [12], [29]. It is unknown whether the 5-HT depletion reported in rats following binge dosing with MMC is permanent. Secondly, recently published work by Freeman et al. [30] is suggestive of lasting cognitive impairment (as measured by a prose recall task) in human MMC users.<br /><br />In the present study we therefore sought to clarify whether lasting decreases in regional levels of 5-HT or DA occurred following exposure to MMC in rats and to investigate the possibility that this treatment may induce lasting cognitive impairment. Our previous research has documented cognitive and social impairment in rats weeks or months after relatively brief exposure to drugs such as MDMA and METH [25], [27], [28], [31], [32], [33]. These effects are consistent with reports from other groups [34], [35], [36], [37].<br /><br />In summary, our data confirm powerful acute effects of MMC on monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. However, 10 days of chronic MMC did not appear to induce any overt injury or lasting alteration in DA or 5-HT systems. Despite this, the impairment of recognition memory observed in high-dose animals more than a month after the cessation of drug provides reason to suspect that MMC may still induce major neuroadaptations, albeit of a subtle nature not detected in the current study. Confirming this finding via replication and pursuing a mechanistic explanation for the observed impairment are obvious priorities for future studies.

				Yeah I guess I would immediately assume that when you induce these sort of conditions a priori. You&#039;re going to have increased expression of monoamine oxidase. The 5-HT receptor is going to be polyubiquinated and targeted for proteasome degradation as it&#039;s constitutively activated. And, over a long enough period induce alterations at the genetic level. However, you know there could always be some other physiology at play here than the horrid &quot;brain damage&quot;. For instance say, these rats were developing an immune reaction to the substance over this sort of long period of abuse. They would of course become indolent as they did and as they did less social.

				Is mephedrone the same as &quot;bath salts?&quot; If so I saw a documentary about this dude hooked on bath salts for about 6 months who developed permanent schizoaffective disorder and had to be confined to an institution.... there was also a news story I read about a homeless guy eating another homeless guy&#039;s face off while high on bath salts. That shit was legal at head shops up until a little while ago. Sad as hell if you ask me - I remember seeing kids fucking around with that shit bought legally from the shops.

				janus: indeed the conditions of the study seem rather sketchy when you consider that human mephedrone use is hardly similar to the administration performed in this study. i couldn&#039;t even fathom the idea of intravenous administration every 2 hours in a human, though similar studies conducted with other chemicals did not produce genetic changes like those seen here. and i agree that it is hard to pinpoint whether the social response was due to the vague colloquialism &quot;brain damage&quot; or due to some unseen force. in the end, however, the method of action is perhaps not as significant as the end result anyway; that is, after reading this, i don&#039;t care whether it induces chemically significant changes to my serotonin receptors, because the rat study reaffirms fears that mephedrone has permanent personality altering effects. i mean, come on, a dude ate another guy&#039;s face off. i certainly won&#039;t be trying it out!<br /><br />sawyer

				Yes, its well known that if you consume a LOT of anything it might have repercussions.<br /><br />Methedrone, I know people who used &#039;normal amounts&#039; and who seem to be fine.<br /><br />Using too much of anytthing is bad for you. Even too much sex. Or alcohol, food, too much oxygen, too much salt, too much butter, beef, red meat, chicken and fish.<br /><br />The moral of the tale is don&#039;t do a lot of anything until you know you won&#039;t drop dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Good morining to fellow UK workers!

				Have only had mephedrone 5 times, 1st time i was&#039;nt well researched and thought about a 1/10 of a g would be right, went a bit harder and snorted it, ended up rushing and puking violently while the buzz got stronger, got to say about the worst reaction i have had to a drug. Took it 3 more times in caps and it was ok. Then took the last biggest cap tonight, have been on the meth pipe for 4 days. As it started to come on i got so fukin sick, worst i have felt nearly ever, the pain getting stronger and stronger due to the drug comming on. Ended up with a cvouple of painfull pukes and some violent stink arse shit. In the puke bowl was a pile of bloody, pulpy stuff. Still dont know if it was blood or some undigested food. There are many chems, over the counter meds that cause spontaneous bleeding so i dont know.<br />Slowed me up a bit got me thinking about retiring.<br /><br />Oh and there was some bullshit article about a man eating some one on this stuff.<br />People with bad, anti social personalities do bad shit, on drugs they do badder shit<br />people with good manners and social concience get high, it does&#039;nt change them into monsters.<br />The media, government agencys and the ever powerfull booze lobby groups put that shit out for the sheep to read.

Trait schizotypy, depression, changes in mephedrone use since the ban and attitudes influencing use of a hypothetical new legal high were indexed at T2 only.<br /><br />Findings&nbsp; Compared with controls, mephedrone users had generally impaired prose recall (P = 0.037) and higher scores in schizotypy (P &lt; 0.001) and depression (P = 0.01). Mephedrone acutely primed a marked ‘wanting’ for the drug (P &lt; 0.001), induced stimulant-like effects, impaired working memory (P &lt; 0.001) and enhanced psychomotor speed (P = 0.024). Impulsivity in mephedrone users correlated with the number of hours in an average (nearly 8 hour) mephedrone session (r = 0.6). Users would be drawn to use a new legal high if it were pure, had no long/short term harms, and was positively rated by friends or on the internet.<br /><br />Conclusions&nbsp; Mephedrone impairs working memory acutely, induces stimulant-like effects in users and is associated with binge use. Factors that influence users&#039; attitudes to new drugs might help to predict future trends in use of the many new psychoactive substances emerging on the internet.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They apparently tested the mephedrone users while high and then some unknown amount of time later while they were no longer intoxicated. The only conclusion they came to was that it caused an acute impairment in working memory. <br /><br />In summary<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Secondly, recently published work by Freeman et al.

				Here&#039;s an interview I&#039;ve found from the guy who led the above-posted study, in which he explains in simple terms Mephedrone effects on the brain: <br /><br />http://www.news-medical.net/news/20121016/Mephedrone-and-memory-loss-an-interview-with-Craig-Motbey.aspx<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, when we looked at the brains of the memory-impaired rats, we didn’t find any long-term changes in their neurochemistry: their dopamine and serotonin levels were the same as the control rats who hadn’t had any drugs. So, whatever it is that is driving the memory impairment it is not something as simple and as obvious as too much serotonin, for example. That’s the next big thing: working out the physical mechanism of the interaction of mephedrone and memory.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Q: Did your research show a correlation between the amount of mephedrone taken and the level of memory loss?<br /><br />A: Correlation is too strong a word for it, but the memory impairment was only found with the highest dose used. The two lower dose groups did not show any memory impairment.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
