				levamisole is a terrible thing to be putting in your body, but unfortunately is added during the manufacturing process, and is hard to get rid of (for instance, acetone wash doesn&#039;t work.)&nbsp; Please don&#039;t be an asshole and add more of it to your product.<br /><br />If you absolutely MUST cut your stuff, please use something like the above poster suggested that at least isn&#039;t harmful.<br /><br />

				back in those days when you could get 90% pure, people used to cut it 1:1 with Inositol which was available in pharmacies.<br />Inositol was over-the-counter and it is reputed to protect your nose when doing much coke and dealers themselves cut the stash they used themselves with it. It is also hard to detect without special equipment.<br />Since I read about this Levamisole all my thoughts of having a line once again have vanished.<br />A mate had some white that made his nose hurt for 2 weeks from a half g. He could not say what it was cut with.<br />

				Cut it with Inositol and use lidocaine to bring the numbing effect up to par with a more pure product and mimic the quality of a pure product.

				A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away I knew someone who used to cut theirs with this stuff called Glucodin, a glucose powder that you can get at pharmacies. <br />It&#039;s completely non-toxic and if you&#039;re gonna cut any powder, it works well and it&#039;s water soluble, and even smokes up nicely if you&#039;re into that sort of thing.<br />Harm reduction is the way to go, and if you&#039;re gonna use an adulterant, at least use one that doesn&#039;t kill your clients.<br /><br />

				Cutting cocaine is ripping off the customer and depending on the cut it might also be a health hazard.<br /><br />When I first joined here I purchased some coke off a UK vendor who is no more. The &#039;coke&#039; vanished with a simple acetone wash. What was left went down the toilet. <br /><br />Of course, the dishonest cocaine vendors will use substances that will not wash out easily. <br /><br />Coke striaght off the block will usually see a loss of anything from 5%-20%. What is left turns into a yellowish waxy type waste. of various toxic chemicals which will leave a residue in the actual coke. In South America, they don&#039;t wash the coke to the standard which any pharm company would insist upon. <br /><br />And if you sell bad quality drugs you will not keep a loyal customer base. You might make a short term gain but most coke sellers are users who use too much! They are buying coke that has already been cut as soon as it comes into the country. Many people have never tried cocaine that is &#039;pure&#039;. I would not even touch cocaine bought from the streets in the UK. I would never use any coke given to me unless it was EZ tested for purity and cuts. <br /><br />The UK has a lot of coke smuggled in. We have mules carrying s kilo or two plus bigger syndicates who will buy coke by the hundred kilo. The only time most people will get hold of uncut coke in the UK is down to people who manage to get the actual pure kilos from South America and hand out the odd gift to people they trust. <br /><br />In the 80s we had a lot of pure cocaine for a while. Then everyone got greedy apart from the few dealers who stick to selling a pure product for a high price. We pay 20-30 for a gram of coke. When its off the block,(and not some repressed block)&nbsp; you will pay 100 UK pounds plus.
