				Is this wise?

				If you&#039;re already on antidepressants, you&#039;ll get virtually no benefit from doing MDMA. It would be a total waste. <br /><br />Someone else here can fill you in on the science because I&#039;m too lazy right now. Better yet here you go: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mdma+and+antidepressants<br /><br />5-htp post-roll is probably beneficial but there haven&#039;t been enough studies to prove this.<br />

You will not roll (get high) so there&#039;s no reason to even try. You will either have no effects or get serotonin syndrome. I&#039;ve had mild serotonin system before and its terrible. It&#039;s seriously the worst feeling you could ever imagine. <br /><br />I&#039;m don&#039;t know much about that AD so I couldn&#039;t advise you how long to stay off it. Although, I would highly recommend you continue taking it. Being depressed and taking MDMA will just exaggerate the depression. <br /><br />If your dead set on using it be aware that you should not just quit cold turkey. You would have to titrate your doses down and be off your AD completely for at least a month probably more. I can&#039;t tell you any specifics because I don&#039;t know just wait for someone else. They wait be able to assist you better if you decide to go this route.

				1) Your SSRI will likely block most of the subjective/pleasurable effect of the MDMA. Taking more MDMA to try to override that would be a Bad Idea.<br /><br />2) From review, I&#039;m in respectful disagreement with some other people here on this, but I&#039;d say there&#039;s some risk of serotonin toxicity. Not a universal certainty, but definitely possible.&nbsp; I&#039;m basing that on reported cases of serotonin toxicity with MDMA and reasonable-dose SSRIs, including citalopram.<br /><br />Assorted serotonin tox links:<br />hxxp://www.psychotropical.com/index.php/serotonin-toxicity <br /><br />This article is also long, but discusses some of the MDMA/rx issues.<br />hxxp://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/4/219.full.pdf<br /><br />SSRI pharmacology in general:<br />edited: links break, look up Preskorn and SSRIs<br /><br />Anyway - For me, the combination of increased risk and blocked drug effect would be a deterrent. I&#039;d think citalopram is less of a risk than some of the other SSRIs ... but would still not on my list of combinations to take. I&#039;ll combine lots of other things that are frowned on, but not these.<br /><br />I&#039;d hold the citalopram for five half-lives of the drug (35 hours is half-life for citalopram) if you&#039;re set on the MDMA [likewise for LSD.]<br /><br />Bear in mind that MDMA, while it has its benefits, also can exact a cost, depression-wise, as hypnotick wrote above. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t be without your citalopram for 7-8 days,&nbsp; then might need to look at the timing of the MDMA and push it out to another time.

				As someone who has experienced severe serotonin overdose it&#039;s a terrible sickness you won&#039;t want to experience ever.<br /><br />Anti depressants block the part of the brain that MDMA effects (you won&#039;t get high)<br /><br />Do NOT go off your anti depressants to get high, yes the half life might not be long but it will take weeks for your brain chemistry to return to the point where you can get high and the damage to your mental health will not be worth it.

This really isn&#039;t clear from your original message. Nor is it clear that you don&#039;t want to just hold your ADs so you can get high. Thanks for clarifying.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> It&#039;s just i don&#039;t feel depressed anymore,Ive&nbsp; been feeling fine for about 3/4 months, </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> If you mean 3 to 4 months, and not 3 weeks, OK.<br />6 months+ remission is preferable, maybe, before going off rx. But 3 to 4 months is impressive and a welcome respite...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i have been to the doctors and he has given me the all clear to get off SSRI&#039;s--and good riddance to them!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Then why is this even a question? Washout the citalopram and move on. (Or washout the citalopram, monitor for relapse for an appropriate period, then move on.)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">thats whats called a drug addict right!(arn&#039;t we all though!) hehe </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Hehe.

If your doctor gave you the &#039;all clear to get off SSRIs,&#039; then why not go ahead?&nbsp; Taper off if you want to be cautious, not always required with citalopram.<br />

				If your doctor said it&#039;s okay to stop taking your SSRIs and you plan on doing so then what was the point of this thread? Wait two weeks after your last dose to get it all out of your system and then do all the drugs you want.

				While there are no ill effects from combining SSRI with MDMA it would be a waste as the SSRI will negate any of the MDMA effects.<br /><br />Remember to temper down your SSRI use, even they have WD&#039;s - anxiety, depression etc etc<br /><br />Also, 2 weeks is a minimum for most before trying any serotonin related drugs but you should realize that for at least 2 months since your last dose there will still be some metabolites in your system, so actually you should wait a few months before rolling if you wanna feel the &quot;real&quot; magic.
