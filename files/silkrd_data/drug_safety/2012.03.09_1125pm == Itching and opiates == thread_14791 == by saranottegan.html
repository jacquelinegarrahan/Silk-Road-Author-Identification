				It comes with the territory unfortunately. Your nerve endings are fooled when by the derivative of morphine so during the &quot;high&quot; they are temporarily turned off. Ever notice that nice rush of euphoria, etc? Once you begin to come down they will fire back up and your CNS will notice them again which is typically why you start getting that itching feeling. I hate this part as well.

				It does suck. I keep using Benadryl &quot;Itch Relief&quot; Spray, but as soon as one spot stops itching, another one starts. I wish I could just bathe in the stuff!

				Itches and opiates are line PB&amp;J hard to separate. They get less noticeable or more normal the more you do them but you will always get them in some degree if you get high enough. What sucks is when your tolerance gets up and you itch but aren&#039;t high.

				For whatever reason I&#039;ve never really ran into any severe itching problems, like it doesn&#039;t really bother me, but SCRATCHING FEELS SO GODDAMN GOOD. I just run my fingernails over myself and it feels like ecstasy.

				I love the itch when I&#039;m home.. especially late at night for some reason.. it&#039;s so good! But it can be really annoying sometimes. It sucks though, itching at work, because I don&#039;t want people to notice!!&nbsp; I&#039;ve discovered that zyrtec really helps. I take 1 10 mg tablet before I do my stuff and it really helps alot for itching... but it makes my eyes red and dry though... benadryll works too but not quite as well. Happy scratching!

				I personally love the itching, as it only comes when I get a good high. One night I itched so much that when I met up with my ladyfriend later, she asked if I had cheated on her because of the red lines down my back.

				Opiates cause histamine release.<br /><br />Take antihistamines like Benadryl/diphenhydramine, zyrtec, allegra, etc.<br /><br />Fixes the problem and is an opiate potentiator to boot!

				I was wondering if it was safe to take benadryl with percocet. Maybe I&#039;ll take a little bit of benadryl and see how it does. Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; :)

				I get the most intolerable itches when I do H. My whole body itches like crazy, head to toe! Strong opiates release histamines into the body which makes you feel itchy. I take two 10mg generic Claritin about 30 min prior to shooting and it helps a lot. I love the feeling of scratching when I&#039;m itchy and high on H. For some reason it just feels so good, but I will scratch certain places raw -- like behind the knees, at the ankles, and around my shoulders. So I definitely have to take the Claritin.

These are side effects of opiates too. The peeing and the hiccups. Ugh...the hiccups drive me INSANE sometimes. The hiccups happen because of the muscle relaxing properties of opiates, it affects the diaphragm. And the excessive peeing is because (if I&#039;m not mistaken) opiates will dehydrate you like crazy. Always try to keep hydrated. It&#039;s one of the reasons people become constipated as well. Also, another funny side effect related to frequent urination is difficulty urinating. lol sometimes it&#039;s really hard to pee when you&#039;re high. But for me, this has only happened when I do H, not percocet. Percs aren&#039;t strong enough to cause this phenomenon.

				So I can deal with the itching - pop a few Benadryl before, it potentates the high and reduces the itching.<br /><br />I can deal with the constipation - take a laxative.<br /><br />I can deal with the peeing - I might have to wait a few minutes but it&#039;ll come out eventually (sitting down helps too!)<br /><br />But GOOD GOD THE HICCUPS!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Nothing gets rid of them.&nbsp; I only get them every so often, but when I do it&#039;s the most frustrating thing in the world.. and its a dead giveaway to people in the know that I&#039;ve been using.&nbsp; Irritating!
