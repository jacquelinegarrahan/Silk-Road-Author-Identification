				I&#039;ve always heard growing up that if you held the smoke in your lungs long enough it would crystallize i.e cause permanent damage? I wanted to try smoking it sometime but this totally turned me off of it, I was wondering if any pros could jump in with some ya/nah?<br />Thanks everybody, TK

				No, it doesn&#039;t recrystallize although I am sure I will get flamed for saying as much since everyone grew up hearing the same thing. It&#039;s a salt, salt dissolves in water, your lungs are very wet places.

				DiamondSky is right, this is merely a largely popular misconception. I don&#039;t know if holding the smoke in longer than a few seconds adds anything to the feel anyways but yeah, of the physical issues you could experience from smoking meth, crystals in the lung is not a problem you need to worry about. <br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Whew that was a relief to hear. I&#039;m just mostly curious because I&#039;m a pot smoker (bongs) so my tendency is to hold it in as long as I can. If I do a similar technique with meth will it absorb more? It just seems like a waste to take a hoot and blow it out right away (like DMT)

				If it&#039;s not absorbed in the system (and instead is blown out), then yes, some is being wasted.<br /><br />There&#039;s a good many other ways of administering, some with greater efficiency (and their own risks).

				I&#039;ve read all sorts of conflicting reports on the availability of meth in recycled smoke (technically vapor I think). Some claim the meth gets absorbed too quickly too make recycling possible while others think there is plenty still left in there. Not being much of a scientist myself I think the old school way of testing the theory is to shotgun hit a friend (i.e. blow your smoke in their mouth) and see if they feel it. <br /><br />As far as other ROI&#039;s go, I&#039;ve always been a big plugging fan and meth goes up the bum just fine. Won&#039;t hit as hard / fast as smoke but makes much better use of the drug and will get you higher / longer than snorting / smoking while hitting faster than eating it.

				I&#039;m thinking the shotgun tests sound like more fun than plugging, but that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />Perhaps replacing the water in the bong with ice?&nbsp; Guaranteed to cool and condense, plus much less likely to absorb.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure some science freaks could rig up a spiral pipe like a condenser and either cooling it with a water cooling system, like for a computer cpu, or a set of peltier cooler elements.&nbsp; Mmm, the mad scientist wheels are turning.

First off, just big ass bongs and stuff that I thought would be overkill just for smoking pot, then this one guy. Holy shit this guy was nuts.

The idea is that some of it vaporizes (aka smokes) and the rest still gets up the nose to be snorted... It&#039;s mostly for people who can&#039;t really commit or just want to mix it up a little. If you haven&#039;t smoked meth before I would probably do it with someone who has or, as funny as it sounds, read / watch a few tutorials. There&#039;s sort of an art to it since you don&#039;t actually want to burn it, just convert it into a gas.

A significant fraction of the human body is water.<br />Arthur Guyton &#039;s Textbook of Medical Physiology states that &quot;the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight. In a newborn infant, this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight, but it progressively decreases from birth to old age, most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life. Also, obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body, sometimes to as low as 45 percent&quot;.[1][2] These figures are statistical averages, so are illustrative, and like all biostatistics, will vary with things like type of population, age and number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure. For example, Jackson&#039;s (1985) Anatomy &amp; Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60% for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water, which approximates Guyton&#039;s 57%.[3]<br /><br />Not that it matters, just thought I would toss it out there, you all got me curious.

				What about risk of infections in the lungs since your exposing them to more moisture. It just has me curious. I can&#039;t seem to find any information on the correlation of infection when using saunas. The meth smoke isn&#039;t smoke, it&#039;s vapor correct? So in theory you would be introducing more moisture to your lungs also? I don&#039;t see the point in saving your exhale unless blowing a shotgun to someone of course. I personally don&#039;t like inhaling carbon dioxide. But, i would imagine it would intensify the rush due to oxygen deprivation. If the container only contained the meth vapor and carbon dioxide of your exhale.? Thoughts?

				I&#039;ve seen at least one person say that after they started holding it in instead of just blowing it back out, they found their meth lasted days longer (as in it was taking less to get him high).&nbsp; But I agree with Fractal... it never seems to make a difference.&nbsp; I gave up vaping though; I really don&#039;t recommend it.&nbsp; It&#039;s noticeably worse for you that way.

				Hey ladies and gentlemen I believe it&#039;s different for everyone. % seconds seems to be the optimized number for me but most times i hold it for 3 secs. Before I found out I used to hold it in like weed and then I started noticing the effects it had and said to myself, I said &quot;self, fuck that shit&quot;<br /><br />Anyways I used to live near a spring and so I got used to drinking lots of water. Just like anything else your body can slowly adapt and build up to certain levels. Believe it or not I was drinking ten milk jugs a week of spring water. That really isn&#039;t that much. It&#039;s just over a gallon a day and the more you drink means the higher percentage that your body is made up of. <br /><br />Has anyone seen the experiments of Dr. Emato or whatever the fuck his name is. That little asian dude who discovered all those secrets about water? It&#039;s easy to find by going to youtube and searching &quot;water discoveries&quot; and his name should show up in the videos liste in the search results. There&#039;s also a 12 video series that is very interesting. <br /><br />Basically the human mind is the control panel we are born with and water is the magical substance that can be manipulated by thought wave frequencies. Water is in more then the human body but since it is in the human body then there is some possibilities of self healing not to mention the possibilities of alchemy and the ability to change the minds and soften those hearts that are set against you.<br /><br />This rabbit hole goes deep. I guess it sounds pretty crazy to most people.

				Well, I tried it.<br /><br />Holding it in worked remarkably better, that being said after the second session (the one I held in my hoots) my back chest and kidneys started to get really sore. No idea why, but it definitely put me into a funk.<br /><br />Soooo probably will never smoke it again. Plugged or pills 100%
