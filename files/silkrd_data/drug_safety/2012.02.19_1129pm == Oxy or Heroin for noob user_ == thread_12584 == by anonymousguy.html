				10-20mg of oxy gets me a nice buzz and cures my back pain.&nbsp; My script ran out, so I need more.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was thinking of swtiching to IV heroin, as I am very familiar with self injections of other drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;So it boils down to whatever is cheaper.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />So should I go with heroin or oxy?

				well if you&#039;re looking for cheaper - easily it&#039;s heroin. with out a doubt. oxys are a dollar/milligram. absurd. personally, I like oxys better. you know what you&#039;re buying. heroin lasts longer though. especially the dope on here. buy from tony for H - or wung or psilocin. and pharmville for oxys - if you&#039;re in the states

				depends.&nbsp; some say heroin is more addictive and harder to quit.&nbsp; &nbsp;plus you never know the quality of the H your getting.&nbsp; With pills - as long as they are made by a legit pharm lab (trusted source), you can always know that the pills you are getting are going to always have the same potency. you can cross reference the source and potency of the pills by doing a quick google search of the imprint found on the pill.&nbsp; i&#039;v never done heroin, so maybe i&#039;m wrong about the quitting part.

				Definitely Heroin, if you&#039;re only on 10-20mg oxy&#039;s a tenth bag should go a long way for you for the meanwhile.

				Everywhere I loook there are posts about opiates! I&#039;m gonna go crazy. Might even attack the mailman :P<br /><br />Nah, I&#039;m just playing. I&#039;d definitely go for the H. Its cheaper by far and there&#039;s just something about heroin. I love her. She inspired some of my favorite musicians of all time. ::D sadly we had a fight when she killed Bradley Nowell of Sublime. She apologized tho, so we&#039;re good again! <br /><br />Best of luck with whatever route you go! <br /><br />Remember, fresh rigs!!

				H is a cheaper route to the same buzz... well, similar. OC&#039;s are regulated and monitored though so you know what you&#039;re getting.
