				The Comprehensive Phenibut Guide<br />(Β-phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid)<br /><br />Written by: DMtryptamine<br />copyright © Chemognosis Group, all rights reserved.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Table of contents<br />1. What is phenibut<br />2. Phenibut addiction and withdrawal<br />3. Dosing information<br />4. Effects and side effects<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -What is Phenibut-<br /><br />Phenibut is a derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA which has been altered to permeate the blood brain barrier more easily.&nbsp; It acts primarily as a GABA receptor agonist with a high affinity for GABA b receptors and a much lower affinity for GABA a receptors. Its effects have been compared to those produced by GHB, alcohol and benzodiazapines although there are some differences. It is sold legally over the counter in some vitamin shops and can be purchased online as a supplement. Despite its availability, legality, and designation as a supplement it is highly addictive and tolerance builds rapidly. Anecdotal reports seem to suggest that tolerance and addiction set in more rapidly than other GABAergic drugs, and even opiates, thus it is highly advised that one not binge on this substance or take it in high doses frequently or for long periods of time (this will be covered in depth in the addiction and withdrawal section).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some scientific literature suggests that phenibut acts as a nootropic (smart drug) in low doses although this is debated. Phenibut promotes sleep, reduces anxiety, causes a pronounced mood lift in higher doses, and elicits some degree of euphoria. It was purported to have anticonvulsant properties although some anecdotal reports and scientific studies on related GABA-b agonists suggest that it can cause convulsions in some people (although generally only in extreme overdose.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phenibut is a prescription only drug in Russia, and is used by Russian astronauts as an anxiolytic that doesn’t cause as much cognitive impairment as related compounds such as benzodiazepines. In comparison to other tranquilizers and gabaergic drugs, there isn’t much information on phenibut and as such, although it is openly sold as a supplement, it should be considered a research chemical.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phenibut hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder with a very sour taste. The LD/50 in rats is 91 milligrams per kilogram (91mg/kg), and it is generally well tolerated compared to other gabaergic sedatives/anxiolytics. In addition to being a GABA-b agonist (and at higher doses being a very mild GABA-a agonist) it also enhances levels of dopamine. The effects of phenibut last for a very long time, sometimes up to two days in high doses or with consecutive doses as the effects are cumulative.<br /><br /><br />Known Contraindications<br />Do not take with mono-amine oxidase inhibitors as these may potentiate phenibuts effects<br />Do not take with medications prescribed for epilepsy<br />May increase the effects of alcohol, opiates, benzodiazapines, barbiturates, or other CNS depressants<br />May decrease the effects of CNS stimulants.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Phenibut withdrawal and addiction-<br /><br />While no formal studies have been conducted on the addiction potential of phenibut, anecdotal reports and medical case reports suggest that there is a definite withdrawal syndrome that can be attributed to phenibut use. Dependence on phenibut is very similar to GHB, alcohol, and benzodiazepine dependence and can even be life threatening if large amounts are consumed for an extended period of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptoms of phenibut discontinuation include but are not limited to insomnia, anxiety, convulsions, agitation, restlessness, depression, dysphoria, and paranoia. If one uses phenibut for any extended period of time you should not stop abruptly, dose should be slowly tapered down just like one would do with benzodiazapines or other gabaergic sedatives. Because phenibut acts in a manner similar to benzodiazapines and alcohol, phenibut withdrawal can cause delirium tremens and even death if used in very high doses for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent dependence and withdrawal it is advised that users not use more than two times per week and never use multiple days in a row. Dependance can develop in as little as three days of consecutive use, and due to the substances incredibly slow elimination from the body withdrawals are prolonged, often lasting much longer than with other gabaergic substances. It has been said by many users that no other substance in the world causes addiction and dependence as fast a phenibut, so caution is strongly advised. As a general rule, NEVER BINGE ON PHENIBUT.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find yourself addicted to phenibut, the withdrawals can be mitigated with benzodiazapines, pregabalin, gabapentin, and a muscle relaxer called baclofen, which is an analog of phenibut with similar effects but doesn’t quite have the degree of addiction potential that phenibut does, thus it can be used for phenibut withdrawals and is easier to taper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all psychoactives, phenibut can be used safely or it can be abused. Due to its deceptively benign feel, ease of availability, and very low cost per dose it tends to be very tempting to abuse. Always remember though, people have had to go to rehab for phenibut withdrawals so just because it’s a supplement you must treat it as seriously as any other addictive drug. Remember, moderation is key with all psychoactives and phenibut is no exception<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Dosing Information-<br /><br />Threshold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approx 100mg (highly variable)<br />Therapeutic dosage range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;250mg-1,500mg (1.5g)<br />Medium recreational dose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5g-2g<br />High recreational dose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2g-5g<br />Nonfatal overdose (without tolerance)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5g + (highly variable)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Effects and Side Effects-<br /><br />Positive effects<br />1.

				form personal experience phenibut causes cross tolerance with most dopaminergic substances (amphs etc).&nbsp; strangely enough phenibut produces the best kinda sleep (uninterrupted, and wake up feeling mellow rather than groggy like with benzos) with very deep dreams. <br /><br />Also once you&#039;ve wd&#039;d from using it (a week of use) a few times.. you will pretty much have permanent tolerance and every wd will be worse.&nbsp; WD starts&nbsp; at about 30-32 hours since last dose.<br /><br />I can&#039;t even take phenibut 2 days in a row without experiencing agitation wd nowadays. when I first used I could take it for 4-5 days with no prob. I wouldn&#039;t even use it more than 2 days in a week without 2 days inbetween. <br /><br />If you buy phenibut on SR you&#039;re a moron. <br />The shit is legal and all over EBAY and amazon. just don&#039;t buy people selling the shit cause they cut it with some dextrosey stuff. primaforce 100g tub is good especially if you want to have a nice addiction to a drug with horrible wd vs high.<br /><br />it&#039;s not cross tolerant with benzos, you can pretty much nullify a phenibut WD (since htey&#039;re shorter than benzo wd&#039;s and dependencies) with benzos but.. uh. yeah, if you get hooked on phenbiut good luck not getting hoooked on benzos.<br /><br />but this just looks like a copy &amp; paste job to me....<br /><br />leaving out hte most important bit<br />Also it&#039;s great for exercising on for some reason. Makes me able to lift heavier weight, run farther without getting tired. <br /><br />It&#039;s similar to baclofen (with the difference being, phenibut has heavier tolerance set in and the dopamine element to it)<br /><br />IT TAKES 2-3 HOURS TO PROPERLY KICK IN. Take it on empty stomach, ALWAYS.&nbsp; See so many morons who take ita nd go &quot;uh nothing happening&quot; after only 1-1.5 hours. then take too much and get stuck in bed from nausea.

				^^ Good information to add. I didn&#039;t really copy and paste anything, I put this togather to distribute when I was selling phenibut. Yeah who would buy it over the silk road, I agree. That being said people buy cigs over the SR.<br /><br />I happen to like phenibut, Its just very important to never use it multiple days in a row.

				Thanks DMtryptamine285 for the info.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been researching this substance for more than 3y.<br />It&#039;s unique. Slightly nootropic and has a touch of afrodisiac.<br />Enhances dreams, normalizes them. Anxiolytic. Phenibuddh...<br />Definitely a socializer. Promotes extravertial behavior.<br /><br />Yes there&#039;s a withdrawal effect sometimes but certainly it&#039;s not an addiction.<br />I&#039;ve never had craving for it nor ever wanted to abuse it heavily.<br /><br />I&#039;d say it tends to promote anti addictive thought patterns.<br />Structurally similar to baclofen, which is helpful in treating alcoholism,<br />but the state of mind is quite different as far as i can tell from my xp.<br /><br />There&#039;s something more to it though. Some subtle magic is there, sometimes.<br />Best for trips in the nature where plenty of living energy around.

Addiction for me is craving which is very distinctive while wd is just rebalancing..<br />Certainly there are way more addictive legal substances around than mellow pheni.

				Yes but semantics is meaning. Isn&#039;t it?<br />Aren&#039;t we are here because of our search for meaning<br />and deeper understanding of the universe in the first place?<br /><br />We can really speak only from the point of view of our own experience.<br />You see you wrote a comprehensive guide but haven&#039;t said anything<br />about your own relationship with this substance nor duration..<br /><br />Not sure about many others. Truly brilliant people are quite rare anyway.<br />But do you personally find phenibut extremely addictive compound?<br /><br />P.S. in general your posts appear to be very interesting and..<br />my special thanks for the reference to the allibenzenes theory..

				^^ Well perhaps comprehensive guide isn&#039;t the best title for this thread. I have a lot of personal experience with it however, that wasn&#039;t the point of me writing this really. It was to distribute some safety information when I was selling phenibut (not on silk road).<br /><br />Yes I find phenibut quite addictive and always make sure to leave a week in between uses. I personally found it more addictive then heroin as even three days of consecutive use causes withdrawals for me. I realize everyone is different, we all have a unique internal chemistry and physiology.
