				Hi<br /><br />I ordered 1 of the 80MG OxyContin OP pills. I want to take orally. I have zero tolerance - I&#039;m a first-timer. I weigh 180 pounds.<br /><br />Should I take 1/4 of the pill at first? Or will that be too much/too little?<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming that I can cut the thing in half or quarters&nbsp; - I&#039;m not trying to snort or bang.<br /><br />And yes I am handsome.

				Supposedly the OxyContin OP pills cannot be crushed (you can physically crush them, but they will still be time release). That is why they are so much cheaper.<br /><br />When I started using opiates I would crush 2 or 3 percoset and get a nice high, so thats 10-15mg oxycodone. I would crush the pill up into as fine a powder as possible and try 1/4 tablet (divide the powder into 4 equal piles and take one pile orally). If you get a nice high then chances are you were able to defeat the time release mechanism.<br /><br />If you have a scale that can measure mg, then try to take exactly 10-15mg (10-15mg of oxycodone, 10-15mg of pill powder will not contain 10-15mg oxycodone, do the math!). If not you wont be able to eyeball anything smaller than 4 piles (20mg oxy in each pile).<br /><br />

				first id recommend you throw that shit away<br /><br />dont under-estimate the danger and addictive potential just because it is a prescription. oxycodone is a very powerful opiate with a high chance for eventually developing an addiction. (trust me i know) <br /><br />if you are going to use it, might as well not waste it. get a sharp sharp razor blade. cut it into quarters. then cut one of those in half so you have an eighth of the pill as a single piece. <br /><br />get a soda, or another acidic beverage like lemonade. split it into two decent gulps in two separate glasses. if you can chop the 1/8th into smaller pieces do it, but if not, just put an 10 mg (1/8th of the pill) in each glass. let it sit for about two to three hours during which the time release mechanism will be broken down and the oxy will be released into solution. <br /><br />id recommend gulp down one of the glasses, so 10 mg. give it 45 minutes and if you dont feel like youre gonna puke and want it to be stronger then use the other glass as well

				You should not start with buying 80&#039;s if you are opiate naive.&nbsp; There is plenty of hydro&#039;s or Perc on SR which will do you just fine and keep you from literally running down the road to addiction and/or overdose.<br /><br />You may get there eventually, but at least enjoy it slowly.&nbsp; And the lower the dose, the less likely it will be time release.&nbsp; Do some homework, it will save you a lot of trouble.

				Do NOT take the op 80!&nbsp; I have been on opiates for a while and that would probably&nbsp; kill even me.&nbsp; I take an op 20 and it is sometimes too strong.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; If you have to take it cut it into fourths, and then cut it again, take like 1/8 of the pill.&nbsp; You should try an OP 10, not an 80, that is the strongest dose!&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why you are trying to have a high tolerance...it is expensive as hell and when you have a high tolerance that usually means you will have withdrawals from hell.&nbsp;

				Thank for your concern folks. I used to be addicted to IV BTH. I used for about 3 years. But that was 12 years ago. So, I am new, but I am not so new, see?<br /><br />I just bought the 80 cuz I wanted to try Oxy and it was cheap.<br /><br />I promise not to kill myself ^_^&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s why I came here for dosage advice.

				the method works well for turning the OPs into IR - the ER formulation sucks so bad the people who were tolerant to the OCs even experienced withdrawal in some cases after being forced to switch to the OPs due to the greatly reduced peak plasma concentrations <br /><br />and if you just banged 4 mg of hydromorphone, i think you might just want to go ahead and start with 20 mg oxy or you may be disappointed, then maybe have another 10 mg dissolving and ready if you need it. <br /><br />its interesting you say you shot up - i am a daily H user but use nasally - i got started on oxy though for legit reasons its just too fucking expensive, but i agree with what was mentioned about H not really being all that different, almost prefer oxy if it was just cheaper. i shot up once, partly to get over my fear of needles (i like facing my fears and conquering them) but was too worried about ODing and didnt get much out of it cause i used a tiny dose. then tried again the next weekend (which was the time frame i said i wanted to wait ahead of time) and ended up sticking myself&nbsp; 8 freaking times without being able to register and i said fuck it. i just know i am wasting so much of the gear and want to know what H is really like... just worried if i find out i wont be able to go back. any opinion on this given your BTH experience?<br /><br />&nbsp;does everything really go down hill automatically that first time you feel the real rush from IV?&nbsp; are you already trying to figure out a way you can IV the oxy now?&nbsp; :) or is it just another ROA that can be used occasionally if done responsibly? <br /><br />and honestly if you got off the shit, please be careful and dont get back into it

				@microRNA&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah don&#039;t bother switching to IV. As many have said, it&#039;s a black hole. My PLAN is to wait at least 2 weeks between doses. I don&#039;t have pain and, at the moment, I don&#039;t have an addiction. I think if I space out 2 weeks between parties I should be able to keep tolerance low and dependence null. I know no one believes this plan will succeed. But I have gone on and off opiates, so I&#039;m not unfamiliar with the process, ramifications, etc.<br /><br /><br />Right now I have the luxury of using to get off, not to get well. I intend to keep it that way. We&#039;ll see how it goes - mwuhahahahaha!!! &gt;:-)

				Yes, take 1/4, I would recommend chewing it, it will last 12 hours if u just swallow and be probably kinda mellow.&nbsp; 20mg is actually a pretty big dose if you are truly opiate naiive, but its not too big. You will probably just be really high, enjoy.<br /><br />Although yeah if you have literally never taken an opiate, than I would say less than 20mg. Its in no way dangerous but might increase the likelihood of side effects.&nbsp; You should really get some smaller IR pills, maybe some hydrocodone, or a &#039;blue&#039; which is 30mg oxy instant, you can crack one of those bad boys in half and swallow that, 15mg is the perfect dose imo for someone with relatively low tolerance.
