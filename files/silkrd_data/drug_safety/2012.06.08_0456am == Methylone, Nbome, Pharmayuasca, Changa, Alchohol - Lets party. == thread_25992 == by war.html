				Im attending a 3 day festival starting tommorow.<br /><br />Right now I am breaking out my Methylone into caps.&nbsp; I have 500mgs.&nbsp; Should i break it into 3 even caps and take them throughout one whole festival day or make 2 big caps with 2 smaller follow ups?<br /><br />I havent done any psychedelics in a few weeks to get rid of all tolerance for this festival and I havent tried Pharmayuasca yet (been saving it for the right time).<br /><br />So right now my plan is<br /><br />Friday - 2 Pharmayuasca pills throughout the first day<br />Saturday - 25i Nbome and maybe mild drinking throughout most of the day.<br />Sunday - Methylone all day. <br /><br />My reasoning for Methylone last is I think it will wipe me the most<br /><br />I&#039;m up for any suggestions and am also looking for input on taking pharamayuasca in a &quot;party&quot; setting.&nbsp; (Im still waiting back on Dimitris opinion).<br /><br /><br />Oh and i guess changa on the way there in the car?&nbsp; Since im not driving.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Help me out guys!&nbsp; Much love &lt;3

				To sum the above clutter up... how should I break up my methylone into caps and ingest it throughout the weekend?<br /><br />Also, if alcohol becomes a factor on what drugs should I be safest mixing it with.<br /><br />Thanks again &lt;3

				Are you taking 5-meo-DMT or N,N, DMT?<br /><br />Take 25i early in the day as it can last quite a while. Enjoy my 25i :D <br /><br />BTW did I throw you a 25C tab? <br /><br />Methylone doesn&#039;t last much of anything. Have you ever taken it before. Its like molly coke. 500 mgs is a pretty normal dose for one decent night of partying.

I usually toss in a 25C tab into all my 25i orders since I lot of people who are into 25i have never experienced 25C.

				Most of the ayahuasca people I have talked to say it isn&#039;t a really a social drug. It is more of a get really comfortable in a dark room and meditate type of drug. But I would love it if you proved me wrong! I would highly recommmend that you adhere to the tyramine-free (no cheese, smoked meats, beer, many others) diet before you take the Pharmas, or else you will probably have a severe headache, high blood pressure and spend much of your Friday puking. No tyramines for at least 24 hours before an MAOI inhibitor should be good.<br /><br />Changa in the car sounds like a lot of fun. Wish I wasn&#039;t the driver for the festi I am headed to lol. The rest of your drug schedule sounds good, although I don&#039;t have any experience with Methylone.

				Pharmas are also heavy MAOI inhibitors so if I plan on rolling or taking methylone they could be pretty tricky.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe ill end up saving these for when i return home.&nbsp;

				Taking an MAOI before a 2c-X will spiral you into a neverending overly intense, not very fun trip. I would NOT recommend taking any 2c-x or 25x-NBOme after taking an MAOI. I did it once...it was disaterous. My friend ended up getting picked up by the cops lol.
