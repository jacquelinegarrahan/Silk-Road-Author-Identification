				Essentially I ordered a really nice vault. My bf is living with me and is anti-&#039;most of what SR is&#039; and would probably call the cops on me or something crazy (he just overreacts and makes impulsive decisions) Now I don&#039;t plan on this happening, right now I cant hide anything in the actual safe. Wow bummer. Because when the safe arrived in the mail from amazon it was a 25lb box that said like whatever the brand and then &#039;SAFE&#039; &#039;SAFE&#039;&nbsp; &#039;SAFE&#039; like a million times. Well I really dont need a big safe I need a small one.. like a micro safe or a nano safe lol... does anyone know of any of these that actually are good security( just in case ).. I would want a digital one not one thats like 30 bux with a shitty key safe.. <br /><br />Also if you know anywhere I could buy safes or vaults (small ones) without it having that really fking obvious packaging all over it like the last one I got? I would get in more trouble 1. and 2. the safe would be useless if he found out i had a second one. because with the first one thats big and had &#039;SAFE&#039; all over the box he makes me open it randomly or if hes suspicious so I Just never put anything really in there... and he would make me do same thing if he found out about another safe ordered which is why discreet packaging is essential.<br /><br />Thanks guys

				I recommend that you upgrade boyfriends.&nbsp; <br />Do NOT marry this guy.&nbsp; You say he would possibly call the cops on you?&nbsp; He makes you open the safe when he is suspicious?<br />He is too controlling and is treating you like a child.<br />This is just my humble opinion but every person deserves some privacy.<br /><br />I hope I&#039;m not out of line here but how much sweeter would your life be if instead of a controlling boyfriend you had a life partner that shared you interest.&nbsp; How cool would it be to have a cool boyfriend?&nbsp; &nbsp;I think its time for an upgrade.
