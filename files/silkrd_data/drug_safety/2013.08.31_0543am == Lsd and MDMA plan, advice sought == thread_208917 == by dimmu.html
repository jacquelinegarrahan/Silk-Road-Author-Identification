				Hi all<br /><br />I am aware if candy flipping however my plan is:<br /><br />Take approximately 300 to 350ug of fine acid, utilise my acid session for music creativity then about 6 to 7 hours later, when the LSD is wearing off, take an MDMA dose and dedicate that high to just listening to music.<br /><br />My question I guess is, are there tolerance issues to consider? Can my plan which effectively is to have 2 seperate highs in the one day/night work?<br /><br />I will be at baseline on the day of consumption, 15 days after my last lucy session and almost ine year since my last roll.<br /><br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Dimmu

				When I do that it costs me.... $0.5<br /><br />So I would not worry.<br /><br />LSD before mdma seems like a good plan.<br />Why not take it before the lsd stops working? <br /><br />Anti climax anyway.<br /><br />Perhaps bring some benzo&#039;s to cure that...

				@trippnmonkey, i have found trying to play guitar etc difficult on mdma. I really want to get the most out of the acid for music creation then when all is said and done, switch to mdma for pure music listening.<br /><br />@Alutnarat, i did the usual erowid and other drug forums however there seems to be no advice RE my plan. The usual advice is regarding candy flippn.<br /><br />Thanks for your replies.

				I think you should just make music and have fun and perhaps have some recording on while forgetting that.<br />This way you can hear how &quot;far&quot; away you are and how everything sounds fucking awesome while most of it is probably shit.<br /><br />Unless you&#039;re already a pro (at tripping and making music).<br />Then you can make AMAZING psychedelic trance/chillout. And if you&#039;re even more awesome you can stay sane and use your (un)sanity to influence future trips that other people have.<br />If you can do that, then you&#039;re totally awesome.<br /><br />Otherwise, just take acid, have fun, don&#039;t try to learn anything on any drug.<br />For me, taking mdma halfway is cool, then redose 2 times.. Then really weed and alcohol, or benzo&#039;s but those should be left out.<br /><br />But it costs at least a month of &quot;depression&quot;. Since reality is so fucked up afterwards.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand the question. Just DO IT!. Experiment and find out what YOU like/think is best.<br />And hope your friends can come on your frequencies....
