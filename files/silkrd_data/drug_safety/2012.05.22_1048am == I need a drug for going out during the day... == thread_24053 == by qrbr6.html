				Okay so this is kind of a weird question I&#039;m asking but here I go. Basically I use drugs like MDMA and LSD to party in clubs on weekends and that&#039;s all well and good but I was looking to use drugs for another purpose. I&#039;m looking for suggestions for something to take during the day, for say going to a shopping center or something. The reason is I want to be a bit more confident when hanging out with this girl I know (she does it because she felt nervous to be around me the last time we met up, she just smoked weed but that&#039;s not a good option with me because it makes me kind of dumb lol). I&#039;m thinking maybe just a few shots of alcohol or maybe a little bit of speed, not too much I don&#039;t want it to be obvious. Thanks for any help, weird situation I know.

				You could try serotonin supplements such as 5-HTP. 100mg in the evening every few days, and I find myself in quite positive moods. I&#039;m much more active and willing to participate in things and my replies in conversation seem wittier than usual. <br /><br />I&#039;ve stopped recently, however, as I don&#039;t really like the way it&#039;s changing me. By all means, you could try a short regime and see how it works for you, it may help with your shyness around this girl (I actually tried this out, because of a woman as well, but more out of curiousity, as she explained quite a bit about them).<br /><br />Another benefit, was that it made psychedelic trips happier, and more colourful, my drunken state incredibly introspective and marijuana highs more engaging. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.<br /><br />On another note, it&#039;s best not to mix this with alcohol. I&#039;ve read some alarming threads about seizures when the two were mixed, but take in mind, persons were taking doses &gt;150mg and they had had a lot to drink.

				For confidence or anxiety and just to be able to talk easier try benzos, maybe a small dose of GHB, or beta blockers. Coke, ritalin, adderall will give you confidence and make it easier to talk I suppose

				I&#039;d be doing low doses of mdma - the ones that just make you more empathetic and talky.&nbsp; Or nice quality coke if you want to come off super-confident.<br /><br />I definitely would NOT be doing alcohol.&nbsp; There&#039;s a fine line between confident and fucking drongo that no girl wants to be around.

				Thanks a lot. Well my normal dose is 150mg. I don&#039;t have much time to experiment on account of the 2 weeks in between rolling (minimum, I usually do 4 at least). I guess I will experiment with 50mg if I have time.

				As far as benzos go, they all basically accomplish the same task, any would work really. I&#039;d recommend xanax or valium though personally. start with 1mg xanax or 5mg valium, if its not enough double the doses (don&#039;t keep doubling them, just once lol) <br /><br />Be careful with them though, benzo addiction is terrible. Worse than heroin, benzo withdrawals are really the only withdrawals that could actually kill you. Just take it slow

				If you thinking about taking amphetamines for social interaction, just keep in mind that you shouldn&#039;t do go out intoxicated every time. You&#039;ll be socially awkward without it and worse off while sober. Keep a solid 50/50 sober to intoxicated ratio while going out and you&#039;ll be fine. Also, I suggest a low dose of psilocybin (like 0.3g). They give me that childlike sense of excitement while going out and it stays subtle. Weed works wonders for me too, but you have to buy a vape if you don&#039;t want people smelling it. It worsens anxiety for some people so see if it works for you.

I haven&#039;t got a lot of knowledge on the dosage of speed because I live in the UK... our speed is quite frankly piss poor. I ordered some paste from SR and I&#039;m speeding now after a couple of dabs.<br /><br />Good advice canorean - Use speed to break yourself open... By that I mean use it from time to time to help yourself get out - use it, then go out sober, use it, then get out sober. Eventually you should find that going out without speed is equally as fun.<br /><br />But like the person above me said, if you use it EVERY TIME you go out it&#039;ll become habit forming.

				For adderall I would just take 15mg. This will make you seem like an outgoing energetic and positive person. 30mg and you might seem like a jittery junkie having withdraws. If you don&#039;t abuse adderall and keep your tolerance down, I take 15mg, half of a 30mg IR, most mornings and I still have plenty of energy 9-10 hours later. I don&#039;t abuse them so my tolerance is so low that even if I take 15mg in the morning I still have to smoke a few bowls at night just to be able to calm down enough to sleep.

Our speed in the UK is worse than I thought. But yeah losing sleep on speed is very easy to do. Normally with me when I close my eyes I can still feel an increase in heart rate which puts me off. Yeah smoking weed would help a lot... I don&#039;t smoke it myself but an Indica strain is bound to help.

				Benzo&#039;s or a small dose of Codeine.<br /><br />Works a treat - except if you go shopping you might either blow your credit card on shit you don&#039;t even need, or get arrested for shoplifting. But you&#039;ll have a good day out that&#039;s for sure :)

				Speed may not be the best option in my opinion. In someone who is predisposed to social anxiety (I dislike the term. It is used far too frequently - we are all nervous of how others perceive us! It is normal and healthy) speed can make you feel extremely anxious. I am a big fan of the stuff but I have definitely had times where in social situations I wish I had not taken it and just stayed sober. Talking can become acutely difficult as your mind is racing and dwelling on how much a cock you might be acting like (I have the same reaction every time I drink alcohol) Other times, it has made me far too confident and caused me to say things I regret later.<br /><br />However, the increased confidence from the use of drugs can be easy to carry over into your normal life. It can be a wake up call.<br /><br />If it is a girl you really like please, pleeease get to know her sober! Humans are designed to interact and get to know one another while sober and I feel drugs only get in the way. When you get to know her, maybe then that is the time to start getting high together. It will be much more special!<br /><br />Benzos are commonly prescribed for anxiety but I passionately dislike them. Learning to deal with feeling &quot;slightly anxious&quot; is an incredibly useful skill and far too many people take the easy way out with these horrible, horrible drugs. They are valuable sleep aids/trip stoppers however.<br /><br />When I have to go to something boring with my girlfriend I take my MFLB with me. A small amount of THC makes you more sensitive to others emotions. Shopping is boring, but she enjoys it and being a little high just makes you realise how sweet it is to get such joy out of something so meaningless!

Very helpful. Yes it&#039;s a girl I like. I wouldn&#039;t say I have social anxiety, but like her I am a bit nervous around people I like who I haven&#039;t been around one on one much before. I am confident shortly thereafter. I just might be a bit shy first. I haven&#039;t tried hash, that has THC right? May be worth a shot.

				All weed products, including hash, contain THC! Assuming you aren&#039;t buying hash in the UK of course :D<br /><br />Weed can be good for these situations depending on the person but like you said - it can make you feel a bit &quot;dumb&quot;. Seeing as she has admitted to doing the same maybe it will be Ok to smoke a teeny weeny bit just to take the edge off. I used to find this useful but nowadays it usually makes me less sociable unless I&#039;m with other partakers.<br /><br />The nerves just make it even more enjoyable when you can finally relax together. Have fun!

				Still a few weeks out but I&#039;m looking to experiment a few times in between to see what is a good idea. I&#039;m going to try smoking like 50mg of speed in a few days to see how that goes.

				Cocaine would be my advice.<br /><br />There is no better drug for productivity and a high level of confidence and euphoria.<br /><br />If not cocaine then a small dose of ketamine is also a good choice however not as good for productivity.<br /><br />Lastly marijuana is another great option as it is safe, controllable, and readily available :)

If you do and you find you like something you&#039;ll want it everyday. Sounds real corny, but the perfect thing is to try and be drug free for work/normal days and be happy about it and then party hard. If you start dabbling every day, then there&#039;s nothing to look forward to and you are just hooking your mood on something.

				The drugs might make you feel better, but being on speed in a shopping centre, could make you appear a little wierd.&nbsp; I dont know about benzos, they make you a little laid back.&nbsp; For the little confidence you need I probably would stick to a few whiskys - more socially acceptable.<br /><br />I think I would try to share some with her, if she isn&#039;t into drugs she isn&#039;t going to be impressed with you speeding around or under any other influence.&nbsp; And it would be a very short relationships.<br /><br />I am a great fan of ice, and have shared with a few female pickups, and it generally leads to a good night.&nbsp; But dont take get them totally wasted and take advantage, that is wrong and illegal, generally the first night I just have a smoke with them, and only make a move on subsequent nights, but never if they dont know what they are doing.&nbsp; And sex with ice is amazing.

				If you don&#039;t care much for weed, try small amounts of valium - it&#039;s more physical than mental (like Xanax, which makes me a drooling idiot that can have the same conversation every 10 min). Go easy on the booze (half a drink at most, IMHO)
