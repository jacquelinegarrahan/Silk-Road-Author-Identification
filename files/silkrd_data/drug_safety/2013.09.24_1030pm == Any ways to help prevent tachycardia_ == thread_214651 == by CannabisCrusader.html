				My resting heart rate is at 120 BPM right now, and I only snorted ~2.5mg of Methylphenidate. My heart rate almost always sits at 120-130 when I take any speedy like substance like amphetamines, coke, or MDMA. Is there anything supplement wise that I could take to help with this?

				Different things work better/worse depending on the person and, probably, the drug (I don&#039;t even know what methylphenidate is--some amphetamine analog?). <br /><br />There are some things I use/try to lower my HR when I&#039;ve done too much methamphetamine or something:<br /><br />small dose of benzos<br />dose of opiates<br />deep breathing exercises (slow inhale, pause, slow exhale)<br />A deep exhale (trying to tighten your core/diaphragm to breath out) -- I&#039;ve heard a good way to try doing this is putting your thumb on/by your lips and trying to blow on it.<br />Laying down, eyes closed (or some other position that encourages relaxation/resting) and drink some cool water.<br />I&#039;ve drank some teas with some herbs/supplements that promoted relaxation with me: chamomile, kava...there&#039;s a bunch but I can&#039;t think of any others off the top of my head (a caffeine-free tea is a must). I&#039;ve seen a lot of teas named &quot;relaxation&quot; or &quot;sleep&quot; or &quot;calm&quot; and all of them&nbsp; have similar ingredients that promote relaxation, reduced BP and HR, etc. <br /><br />maybe drink a little alcohol? Not much (and may not be advisable for every stim) but maybe a beer, a shot, or a glass of wine<br /><br />avoid caffeine<br />avoid getting excited (control thoughts that might provoke such responses)<br />avoid quick/strenuous activity<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s what I can think of off the top of my head. Have you tried anything before with any success? I&#039;d be interested in hearing if you try anything (my suggestion(s) or something else) and how effective it was.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Thanks for the reply. Methylphenidate is what ritalin is but I&#039;m pretty sure the ones I have are generic.<br /><br />I wish I had some benzos and I&#039;ve never tried opiates but I usually take most stims for functionality, I wouldn&#039;t want to get too high.<br /><br />The others I have tried, or similar breathing techniques, and while they work, it comes back shortly after.<br /><br />Never thought to use alcohol for my heart rate but it&#039;s definitely helped in the past now that I think about it. I&#039;m gonna go buy a 6 pack, I&#039;ll get back to you :)<br /><br />Also, I have some CoQ10 for supplementing mdma, does anyone know if that would help?

I knew the name was familiar. I haven&#039;t had much ritalin experience. If you use the stims for functionality have you ever considered cutting your dosage by some? Not sure if it&#039;s the same for ritalin but I know adderall has other amphetamine salts in the pill designed to discourage abuse but really it just adds unpleasant side effects. If ritalin has something similar maybe try a different drug? I tried focalin once or twice and I thought it was a rather pleasant come-up without really tweaking me out or anything.<br /><br />Couldn&#039;t tell you about the CoQ10 enhancing mdma. A quick search has it recommended as a preloader so I would say to not take it if you&#039;ve already dropped the mdma but take it an hour or so beforehand to help potentiate vitamins/supplements already a part of your preload (I don&#039;t think it would have much effect on its own).<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Beta blockers are many amp users solution to the high resting heart rate. Read up on it.

				I&#039;ve found that kratom (an herbal opiate), which seems to compliment almost everything nicely, helps to take the edge off stimulants and does a decent job at minimizing/masking unwanted side effects like tachycardia. I&#039;ve used it for years with practically every stimulant under the sun including methylphenidate (Ritalin and Concerta) for the above reasons without any problems. It&#039;s a nice buzz on it&#039;s own too and pretty benign in it&#039;s addiction potential compared to other opiates and benzos. It&#039;s widely available legally in the US on the clearnet.<br /><br />Klonopin is king for me when it comes to controlling tachycardia, anxiety, and side stimmy side effects. I find it really compliments any stimulant I take. I&#039;m talking low/therapeutic doses like 0.5-2 mg per day. Only downsides is that it&#039;s a benzo and benzos are benzos, even in low doses :/ Long-term (and even short-term), the memory impairment and lowered inhibition can bite you in the ass, especially when paired with the sleep deprivation that stimulants can bring. <br /><br />As I see is mentioned above, Beta-blockers (propanlol specifically) are sometimes used by people to control heart rate and jitters (ex- for performance enhancement like in competative shooting). I&#039;ve never tried it myself but depending on your needs that might be the best option (assuming you&#039;re in good health) since it&#039;s not habbit forming or psychactive. You&#039;d want to first do a bit of research on it course.<br />

				Beta blockers are most effective at reducing heart rate that would otherwise be elevated due to some stimulus. This could be axienty, but also simply requiring increased bloodflow when running up a hill. <br /><br />A beta blocker may be able to limit this effect both for drug-induced and other responses. It will usually not do very much to lower your heart rate or blood pressure when you are at rest and relaxed. For chronically elevated blood pressure and heart rate things like ACE inihibitors are commonly prescribed.<br /><br />You should not look at your heart rate or blood pressure when doing any drugs however. It is important to check the values when you are not under the influence of any. This also includes things like a couple of mugs of coffee as that already makes a vast difference in test results.

				Try to really relax and don&#039;t bug out.<br /><br />Take a baby aspirin or half a regular 325mg tab if you start feeling any numbness on any body parts.<br /><br />Benzos would definitely be your best bet if you have any as I doubt you have any beta blockers on you.
