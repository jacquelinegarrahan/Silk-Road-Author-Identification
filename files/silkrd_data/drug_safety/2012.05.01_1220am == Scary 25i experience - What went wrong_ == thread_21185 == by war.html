				EVERYTHING I have read about 25i has been positive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just read this report on Erowid and I can&#039;t figure what went wrong for this guy.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=94953<br /><br />Anyone have any insight? A bit scary to be honest.<br /><br />

				The more you read bad trips the more likely you will have one. You need to have an open mind and let it just happen. Most bad trips are from people making it happen themselves. If you can&#039;t handle an intense ride then you shouldn&#039;t be taking mind altering drugs.<br />

				I usually agree with you on this, but out of all the 25i on Erowid I think this is the only bad trip report (pretty amazing imo) and if guy was in hospital for 5 days already at time of posting that&#039;s a lot more serious than just a &quot;bad trip&quot;.<br /><br />

				What is with you kids and reading OTHER PEOPLE&#039;S trip reports to death. I already said this in ANOTHER kid&#039;s topic from five minutes ago. If you&#039;re seriously this worried about it then it isn&#039;t for you, sorry. You HAVE to jump into hallucinogens if you even want a chance at a good time. Hallucinogens aren&#039;t like taking uppers and downers, doesn&#039;t work like that.<br /><br />Have you ever tripped before? Seeing as how you put &quot;bad trip&quot; in quotes you&#039;re more than likely 15 or 16. Stop relying on what other people tell you about something that&#039;s so integral to your own mindset. IT&#039;S STUPID TO PLAN YOUR TRIP AROUND OTHER PEOPLE&#039;S MINDSETS!!! <br /><br />By the way. WHY THE FUCK would you want start out with shitty RC&#039;s? Why not just get real shit. Can&#039;t stand RC&#039;s, except for MDMA if that counts.<br /><br />If you&#039;re seriously this paranoid, don&#039;t do it; you&#039;re most definitely not ready. <br /><br />By the way, it&#039;s EXTREMELY ignorant to say &quot;EVERYTHING I have read about 25i has been positive.&quot; You are just BEGGING to get scammed and scammed HARD.

Also, some people like to read about things before they do them. Taking any drug without doing at least a little research is asking for trouble. In addition, not all RCs are shitty, just because you don&#039;t like them does not make them shitty. Just my opinion though, you are more than welcome to have yours but it would most likely be better if you could display your opinions in a less abrasive way.<br /><br />And to answer your question war, I wouldn&#039;t put to much faith in trip reports on erowid, this one sounds exaggerated. Either that or there was a mistake made in the dosage.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Zubic<br /><br />

				Some facts of recreational drugs and their use.<br /><br />1) No one experiences a drug exactly the same as someone else, due to differences in personal chemistry, environment (both during the experience and in general), upbringing, personal philosophy, nutrition, etc.<br />2) No drug is 100% guaranteed to be enjoyable for those who take it.<br />3) Those who feel the need to talk at length about drugs are of a different mindset than those who simply use without discussing much.<br />4) Erowid only publishes reports they feel are interesting, well-written, and/or educational.<br />5) RCs (or rather, new and obscure RCs) are documented rather poorly. [25i is no exception.]<br />6) Drugs are not always 100% pure.<br /><br />To be frank, I have never had a glowing 100% super-duper excellent trip on foxymeow&#039;s 25i. I find the visuals and the mindset to be troubling but nutritious. Seeing a ++ mandelbrot set of laughing, screaming, jeering faces with huge pastel teeth for half of my trip isn&#039;t exactly &quot;positive,&quot; nor is climbing into one&#039;s mouth infinitely repeatedly. When I smoked on 25i I became overwhelmed and had a very strong +++ where I couldn&#039;t control my speech or actions at all. And yet despite the negative aspects I found the trips to be good for me. The next days I felt very well and thus I plan to take 25i again in the future.<br /><br />Meanwhile foxymeow enjoys taking 25i as a club drug and entheogenic sex enhancer. A report involving 25i and 6-APB on erowid makes it sound as rich of a &quot;candyflip&quot; as MDMA and LSD. Some prefer 25i to LSD. Why? Because we are all different and so are our environments and circumstances. There are 1000 25i users for every published Erowid report on it, I am sure, and they must all vary.<br /><br />Oh, and let&#039;s remember that since 25i is vasoconstrictive among other things. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a substituted amphetamine, but at any rate if you handle the raw chemical without proper protection you will kill yourself dead. It smacks of the bromo-dragonfly overdoses, especially because of the dosage threshold being so similar.<br /><br />So yeah, not all flowers and sunshine. (But I still love it.)

Especially with PEAs people&#039;s metabolism will vastly differentiate the effects/affects of all the NBOMe molecules. I started with 2mg of HPBCD blotters because I thought they were 500ug each when they were actually 1000 ug each, and I had a nice ride with the exception of the vasoconstriction you mention and some hypertension on the come up. I continue to research and learn about this drug, but the heavier body load doesn&#039;t warrant the high I&#039;d like to get off of it.&nbsp; I think 3mg would be ideal for me if the body load were less intense, but I&#039;ve read of people getting off hard on 500ug. I also take 120mg of Cymbalta, an SSRI, so consider your sources first. After that being said, I plan on doing 1750 ug this weekend with a friend at the river. We are taking the Arobe ( super cool frisbee ).&nbsp; The trails on this RC are beautifully long.&nbsp; Mind fuck is absolutely minimal. Pupil dilation is absolutely maximum. Have fun researching.<br /><br />~Tel<br />

The kid in it was suffering from an adverse drug event. Dangerously low magnesium &amp; potassium levels just from 500 ug of 25i? Seems like a freak case, but just goes to show you that this isn&#039;t as safe as LSD, and shouldn&#039;t be considered a substitute.

				You create your own experience on psychedelics.<br /><br />If you&#039;re negative, you&#039;ll get hit with fear/paranoia.<br /><br />If you&#039;re positive, you&#039;ll get the joy/love.<br /><br />It&#039;s really that simple, stop reading these reports. I used to read them and it would fuck up my trips, the last thing you want on a trip is some bullshit echoing in the back of your mind about some guys heart racing and wolves fucking him in the ass.<br /><br />Also there&#039;s no evidence that this guy actually got legit 25i, which he probably didn&#039;t.
