				Hello all,<br /><br />methanol is used for that, but hard to find... not so easy to buy. <br /><br />Are there other solvents - which work as well?<br /><br />for example Isopropylalcohol, which is easy to find?

				I did not found much info. <br />but this should be interesting:<br /><br />&quot;The hair samples of six opiate addicts, who died after heroin overdose, were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after extraction with 10 solvents differing in polarity and hydrophilicity in an ultrasonic bath. Morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine (MAM), and codeine were detected in all cases, and heroin was detected in four cases. With toluene, which is hydrophobic, almost no extraction occurred, and with the nonprotic solvents dioxane, acetonitrile, acetone, and dimethyl sulfoxide, only a relatively low extraction rate was found. The yield increased in the series of alcohols from n-propanol to isopropanol to ethanol to methanol. Water proved to have almost the same extraction capability as methanol. Using equal conditions, the extraction rate of the opiates decreased in the following order: heroin &gt; MAM &gt; morphine = codeine. Addition of 1% acetic acid or 1% triethylamine to methanol led to a decrease in the heroin yield and an increase in the morphine yield. The results are discussed in terms of the binding between the hair matrix and the drug, the penetration of the solvent into the hair, and the solubility of the drug in the solvent. &quot;<br /><br />you could try ethanol?<br /><br />

				&nbsp;ether or Di ethyl ether will dissolve heroin and leave other things behind&nbsp; BUT there are better methods depending on your purpose.<br /><br />&nbsp; what&#039;s your reason for wanting to do this, and with what quantity?

I have psychological problems and I know that Heroin/Opiats is good <br />for that, but I really have to prevent from other effects than opiats.<br /><br />I think they won&#039;t use other drugs for cutting it?! (do they?) - it just impurities with no own effect... but if I can rid of them all ... its the best I can do.<br /><br />First I want to try this with a low quantity - try some vendors (I already have H from 2 vendors, but want to try 1-2 others as well) and see which is the purest - and that&#039;s the place where I do bigger orders in future.<br /><br />But I know every charge can be different... <br /><br />Thank you<br />

				&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;thanks for replying Bastion&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Mate I honestly think that if you can find a vendor with good&nbsp; #3 beige alkaline powder (like theXchange has ... very nice guy too , great vendor ;))<br /><br />As long as you use preferably,&nbsp; &#039;distilled water&#039; or at least boiled water that&#039;s cooled ... If you need to heat it, re-heat it ....letting the water cool ALSO helps kill some of the tougher bacteria...doing very quickly, from hot to cold is called &quot;pasteurisation&quot; after Louis Pasteyr , the guy who figured this out, and it&#039;s what they do to milk, and most beer and other drinks to kill bacteria<br /><br />&nbsp;I am guessing you want to inject this stuff, so what REALLY important is that everything you use is clean....And use a new needle each time, and use a different place in that or another vein ..... try to keep the &#039;holes&#039; at least 5mm away from each other and give them time to heal.<br /><br />NEVER &#039;rub&#039; the spot you just injected into, after having a shot ...&nbsp; That&#039;s why people fuck their veins up so fast .... I&#039;ve been using iv drugs thousands of times over 35 years or so and I&#039;ve STILL GOT ALL my veins ... that I can still inject into 8)<br /><br />&nbsp;If you&#039;ve just had a shot in your arm, have a piece of folded toilet paper or tissue (DONT USE ALCOHOL SWABS to do this .... the alcohol MAKES YOU BLEED MORE! and the more blood the more scarring, and so on to a collapsed vein)) <br /><br />So ... Immediately after you pull the rig out, lift your arm straight up over your head to lower the blood pressure and then gently put a 2cmx1-2cm &#039;wad&#039; of tissue on the spot AND DO NOT MOVE IT.....keep it as still as you can for about 2 minutes ....btw once you are holding the tissue you can bring you arm down, ....the whole &quot;idea&quot; of doing this is to STOP THE BLEEDING UNDER THE SKIN which forms scars. <br />&nbsp;( you can also use a fair sized piece of cotton wool, or even a t-shirt&nbsp; but tissues are usually more available/handy) sometimes just holding it in the air above your head for a minute or two it will probably stop by itself, with a little bump at the site .... <br /><br />THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH COKE OR SPEED as they both RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE, and they&#039;re pumping that blood harder .... SO you MUST use a &quot;Blood Stopper&quot; with the &quot;speedy&quot; drugs ;)<br />&nbsp;(I usually give the rig a quick rinse once to stop any blood clotting in it&nbsp; and blocking it)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Injecting a few mls of 70% heroin mixed into it will cause you almost&nbsp; no harm (except the addiction-and that&#039;s your call) and veins are actually &quot;safer&quot; than muscles to inject into as the blood is full of lymphocytes, &#039;immune killer cells and their mates&#039;&nbsp; so&nbsp; IF&nbsp; you DO inject into a vein, a somehow &#039;polluted&#039; shot, you will have what I.V &#039;veterans&#039; would call&nbsp; &quot;a dirty shot&quot;&nbsp; .... you get a bad head ache and something like INSTANT &#039;flu, and you&#039;ll just want to get into bed and make it stop :P <br /><br />&nbsp;BUT ...sadly there IS NO thing you can DO but &quot;ride it out&quot; which is usually a couple of hours and it will go as fast as it came<br />And not even more heroin will help...becoz you are having an &quot;immune response&quot; which &quot;overrides&quot; your system to &#039;make sure&#039; it destroys the invaders. :o 8)<br /><br />NOW .... If you were to inject the &quot;same shot&quot; into a muscle, very possibly nothing will happen......for a while, and then the injection site will become red and swollen and maybe turn ulcerous and ooze pus...they can get very nasty&nbsp; :o ... think the&nbsp; &quot;crocodile&quot; they make/use in russia whose impurities cause massive infections&nbsp; :o<br /><br />This is becoz the muscles dont have the same amount of blood flowing through them that can deal with that ml of solution as well, and by the time enough &#039;immune fighting cells&#039; come along to take care of it, things will get worse<br /><br />this is why injecting into veins IS safer in almost every way and&nbsp; &nbsp;btw&nbsp; ... DO NOT INJECT INTO AN ARTERY! ... EVER! find out why yourself, Im getting tired<br /><br />Finally ...THE&nbsp; SINGLE&nbsp; MOST&nbsp; IMPORTANT&nbsp; THING&nbsp; YOU&nbsp; &quot;CAN&nbsp; DO&quot; while using is EAT the&nbsp; HEALTHIEST FOOD you can get your hands on ....I&#039;d rather eat 2 apples than anything from Mc Chuxalds :o&nbsp; You ARE what tou eat ....LITERALLY&nbsp; 8) think about it<br /><br />And use a laxative called &quot;lactulose&quot; EVERY DAY just take about 10-15 mls and you will&nbsp; never get constipated using any opiate ...It&#039;s great stuff ... and makes you shit perfectly &#039;normally&#039; like you weren&#039;t using narcotics<br /><br />I think that&#039;s about it&nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp; shoot me a pm if you need more help anyone ... goodnight&nbsp; &nbsp;motek :)

				Thank you Motek for your detailed information,<br /><br />but... I don&#039;t want to do IV... <br /><br />First try to snort only - perhaps going to chase the dragon sometime if its more effective than snorting it.<br /><br />One option I really think about is plug it&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to become hooked to the rush, I want to take it &quot;nice and easy&quot;... <br /><br />What I read... vaping gives you a direct rush (didn&#039;t try it yet) - snorting needs more time (and I have to be cautious not to overdo) - but I have to find some more information about plugging ;)<br /><br />So if I&#039;m right - nr3 brown has to be added some acid to dissolve into water. If I dissolve it, it should be good for snorting to? (taking a syringe - without needle of course&nbsp; :o and dropping that solution into the nose)<br /><br />Nr4 can be snorted without preparation ... I think... <br /><br />Have both atm&nbsp; ::)

				you would probably be fine just chopping up small lines, maybe the size of half a skinny match in length and width and take it slow, It tastes very bitter but once it starts to come on, you wont care!<br /><br />Booty bumping is a great way. comes on quite quickly , bypasses the stomach so much more gets into your bloodstream etc. but do that by mixing it in water and using a syringe to put it in...it wont &quot;leak out&quot; but you can just stay lying down where you are when you have it....lyind on your back with one hand going around your side&nbsp; and the other between your legs...it;s a good way<br /><br />As for purity, bro do not worry about it, it&#039;s such small amounts you&#039;re getting ... go to the vendor &quot;theXchange&quot; on the road he&#039;s new but check out what&#039;s being said about him on the forum ... I&#039;ve already had 1 wonderful order delivered from him...the nicest guy///check his thread becoz his gear is very &#039;clean&#039; as well<br /><br />I hope that helps<br /><br />Take it easy mate<br /><br /><br />motek
