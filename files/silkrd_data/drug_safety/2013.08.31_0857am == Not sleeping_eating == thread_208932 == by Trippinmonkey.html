				Ok so first I got some cheap dexies... Could not eat.. even drinking was hard except for alcohol.<br /><br />During the night I don&#039;t even snort anymore. Just drink, read, post obsessively.<br />I was thinking about adding 1 gram of meth to 5 grams of washed speed... But that just seems like a waste of money.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are people binging on speed/meth... How the hell do you keep up with this? Hallucinations in eye corners are not fun. Hearing paranoid none existent voices is fucked up. They go away after some seroquel...<br /><br />Why am I asking this?<br />Because I think I lost control. At some point I will surely collapse. And Im taking vit b complex + vit c and some fruit...<br />Sleeping seems like a waste of time.. and the nightmares and sweating is horrible...<br /><br />People addicted to meth must stay awake for days... are you even conscious of what you are doing? Like typing the same stuff over and over or cleaning while everything becomes a mess?<br /><br />All I know is that dicaprio slept 15mins every 4 hours and that there are different ways of sleeping that are not compatible with society.<br />But not sleeping/eating at all/drinking all the time?<br /><br />This can not be good.. so some advice will be welcome.. going outside is hell at the moment...

				Those are classic symptoms of stimulant overdose.<br />The best thing you can do for yourself bro is stop taking them ASAP.<br />You&#039;re having what sounds like some pretty severe anxiety issues and psychosis brought out by lack of sleep, malnutrition, and dehydration.<br />Call 911 if you start to feel like you&#039;re going to pass out, you need your fluids dude.<br />If you have some benzos on hand, take them. They&#039;re usually the first line of defense against stimulant overdose.<br />Please stay safe dude, you need to stop this binge ASAP, and avoid doing any more harm than you&#039;ve already done. <br />Consuming more stimulants is not the answer.<br />Please force yourself to drink some liquid (preferably with electrolytes, gatorade is great) and eat as much as you can.<br />You can make it through this man.

				Sleeping is not a waste of time.&nbsp; Your body takes care of a lot while you sleep.&nbsp; Eating is not a waste of time.&nbsp; Every cell in your body needs nutrients.&nbsp; At the very least, get some Vitamineral Green and put whopping tablespoons in a big glass of orange juice and drink that shit.&nbsp; Get as much nutrient dense food around you as possible so that at least if you&#039;re having a hard time eating you are getting vital nutrients. <br /><br />I watched a friend neglect their body due to meth addiction that took them over;&nbsp; they ended up dead from a serious lung infection, they were sick for 3 days and then died, they were like 30 years old.&nbsp; It&#039;s no joke.&nbsp; If you say fuck you to your body, your body is going to say fuck you too.

				+1 to bluedev if we could.<br /><br />Your body is like a high-performance engine. Like a RB26DETT worked off it&#039;s tits. (Google for the reference). If you blow it, and don&#039;t perform the proper maintenance, you&#039;re gonna fuck it. Hard.<br /><br />Think of it like this: you can run AvGas and NOS all day long on an RB (comparison to the human body is running meth, MDMA, Oxy&#039;s, opiates etc for extended periods of time). Eventually, a part is going to blow if it isn&#039;t reinforced with a new, stronger part or an upgraded part. Or, if you leave the engine to properly cool down and keep it well-oiled and serviced, it will be OK. Unfortunately, human bodies cannot have oil changes and parts replaced at whim.<br /><br />You are abusing your body like we abuse our RB&#039;s; we thrash the fuck out of them, but we know we can afford AND source the parts necessary to repair them. The difference is that you cannot just change out your liver for an aftermarket part like a turbo or camshaft. <br /><br />Your body is like an RB; take care of it, with the right fluids (electrolytes, vitamins etc) and a good rest period, you&#039;ll have a good body to carry you through for the rest of your years.<br /><br />Know it&#039;s a long bow to draw, but that&#039;s the basics of it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t over-do it. I LOVE thrashing my R32 all night long; however I know I have bought the right parts, and given the motor significant down-time to cope with the abuse.

				In the end I quit the stims and took 20mg valium some zolpidem and 100mg seroquel.<br /><br />After eating like a pig I slept for 8 hours (with teriible nightmares and waking up feeling like WTF!)<br /><br />Feeling a lot better now.. although Im either having issues regarding the half life of the valium or just have a big hangover from all the crap.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice though. Oh and taking some vitamine pills + forcing myself to eat at least something helped a lot of well :)

				Well it was my impression that not sleeping or eating was bad for you. So both isn&#039;t necessarily a great combo :P<br /><br />20mg of Valium!?! Hope you had a tolerance to be working with bro, or that they were shitty blues. That shitty-ness you&#039;re feeling could be the hangover, but if you&#039;re feeling dizzy/weak its most likely the Valium withdrawl :-\<br /><br />I only did 10mg of Valium and had the worst fucking withdrawls of my life for a good 4-5 days (the first 3 days were the worst). For your sake, I hope its just the hangover. Benzo withdrawls are fucking terrible<br /><br />I&#039;m not your mother, but I would try and cut back on the stims for a bit if I were you. Give your brain a few weeks to recover, binges are not easy on the brain in any way.<br /><br />Guzzle water over the next few days, take multivitamins, eat LOTS of food (preferably not junk), and get lots of sleep. <br /><br />And good luck to ya man! Hope you feel better
