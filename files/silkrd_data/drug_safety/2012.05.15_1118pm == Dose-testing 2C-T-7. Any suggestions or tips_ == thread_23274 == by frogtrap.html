				Hello,<br /><br />I got myself a decent amount of 2C-T-7, and over the last few weeks have taken it three times. I feel I should note that I&#039;m a relatively experienced mind-explorer, but not with RCs at all. My only psychedelic experience has been with LSD and mushrooms, though I do have a pretty decent bit of experience with those.<br /><br />First, I took 1mg, just put it on my tongue and washed it down with water. No effects felt.<br /><br />My second time, I took 5mg in a gelcap with water. No effects felt/possible minor elevation of mood.<br /><br />Feeling safe that I was not allergic to the substance or experiencing any other toxic effects, I took 15mg in a gelcap with water this weekend. Between 1 and 2 hours after ingestion, I felt like I was definitely &quot;coming up&quot;, but only seemed to get threshold effects. That is, I could tell I was under the effect of a substance, but not really what the effect was, only that it made me feel somehow &quot;good&quot; with a slightly cloudy head. I didn&#039;t get any visuals other than straight things having a slightly curved look to them, and a feeling that my depth perception was not quite right. One thing that seemed strange was that I really wanted to keep closing my eyes... I did smoke a few bongs with my roommate once I decided that I had finally reached the plateau of effects, so it&#039;s entirely possible I was just super-stoned. XD&nbsp; I actually fell asleep for like an hour at around the six-hour after ingestion mark, which surprised me, since there&#039;s usually no chance of sleeping on hallucinogens for me. But my roommate did remind me that we smoked a LOT of pot, and I did get up early that morning, so falling asleep for an hour at 9pm wasn&#039;t that strange (even though I did ingest the 2C-T-7 at 2:45 pm...).<br /><br />I measured out my next test-dose at 20mg. Is that too quick of a dosage increase with this substance? I know 15-30mg is an average &quot;common&quot; dose, but I also know that everyone seems to react differently to different doses, and that this substance has a sharp dose-response curve. I&#039;m really excited to feel the full effects of 2C-T-7, but I want to make sure I&#039;m playing it safe. I&#039;m pretty confident I can handle any effects the drug throws at me, I just like to play it safe with strange pills, powders, and plants. It seems to me like a 33% dose increase is a lot, but it&#039;s still a relatively small dose, especially considering I barely felt anything at the 15mg mark. I really wanted to try 25mg as my next dose, but thought better about blindly jumping into unknown waters. <br /><br />***TL;DR: Dose-testing 2C-T-7. Last dose at 15mg was barely felt. next dose to be 20mg. Should I go higher? Lower? Is that a smart rate to increase my dosage or too fast/slow? I&#039;m waiting a week between sessions so I don&#039;t mistake tolerance for ineffectiveness.<br /><br />Thanks for any advice!<br />frogtrap :-)<br /><br /><br />Edit: Silly spelling mistake

				i HAVE THAT SHIT MARKED AS skull and crossbbones.&nbsp; deaths have been reported.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be my first choice, but I&#039;m glad to hear you are trying it safe.<br /><br />can&#039;t wait to hear updates

				Yeah, I&#039;ve read about the deaths, and that&#039;s one of the reasons I&#039;m being careful with my dosing and not snorting it or combining it with anything other than pot (for fun) or alprazolam (only if I ever need it).<br /><br />&nbsp;My main intent with this post was to make sure I&#039;m not being retarded with my dosing strategy. I want to feel a strong dose, but I don&#039;t want to rush there and put myself in physical danger. I understand there&#039;s an element of physical danger with any RC, and that&#039;s why I want to make sure I&#039;m not going too fast. <br /><br />I&#039;m keeping pretty good notes on dose, ROA, timing of effects, and such, so I&#039;ll definitely post my full findings in another post when I&#039;ve found a dose that&#039;s strong and safe (after repeated administrations). I know each person responds differently to this one, so I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m laying any sort of groundwork that hasn&#039;t already been covered or doing anything different or better than anyone else, but it could be helpful to someone else out there like me, who has an interest in 2C-T-7, but does not know their own body&#039;s dose. I did a search of the SR Forum on 2C-T-7 dosing, and all I could find were posts about how moonbear took like 50mg with 3mg of 25i-NBOMe or interest checks and such. :P <br /><br />Nobody seemed too alarmed that moonbear took 50mgs, but I don&#039;t like playing that close to the edge of the cliff. ;)<br /><br />I did check out bluelight and Erowid, just checking again. The only wrong question is the one never asked, IMHO.

				um, moonbear....&nbsp; I&#039;m new here, but I read posts about him being suicidal and reckless and stupid.&nbsp; Take that for what it&#039;s worth (very little)<br /><br />Off topic, but if you want something intense, try 2c-e.&nbsp; I snorted 20mg, maybe (bought it from the street) and it was the most intense shit i&#039;ve ever taken.&nbsp; Almost actually horrible with the amount of visual and audio hallucination.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to do it again.&nbsp; &nbsp;LOL, what am I saying?&nbsp; It WAS horrible and waaayyy too long.&nbsp; Man, I can&#039;t wait to take it again. In a better setting, it would have been enjoyable.

				Hahaha, I didn&#039;t mean to say &quot;If moonbear did it, it&#039;s okay&quot;. Far from it. I only meant that nobody said &quot;50mg of 2C-T-7 is insane!&quot; They only said that once they realized he did the nBOME as well, though maybe it&#039;s because they were all used to him doing stupid shit with his drugs. I don&#039;t approach drugs the way he does. I&#039;m much more cautious, certainly not suicidal, and I hope I don&#039;t come across as reckless or stupid.<br /><br />I do like intense hallucinogenic experiences, but I&#039;m not in a hurry to get there with this. I like to start slow with a new drug, and get a feel for it, you know what I mean? I started with acid at high doses and was fine, but think I would have been better off if I knew more about the drug I was doing. I like to know what kind of bodily sensations to expect, what kind of head-space it puts me into... I like to examine my chemicals and my mind at the same time. Once I&#039;m comfortable with a substance, then I can go for &quot;intense&quot;. Also, with LSD, I knew that people had been doing it for a long time and it was, in a relative sense, safe. With 2C-T-7, there&#039;s just not enough information for me to &quot;know&quot; anything. While I appreciate reading things like bluelight and erowid, and I value books like PiHKAL, they only say so much, and the rest is up to the individual to find out for themselves. <br /><br />I do intend to try most of the 2C family, so I&#039;ll get to 2C-E, but had a strange fascination with 2C-T-7, so that&#039;s where I started. I still love my LSD and mushrooms, and I&#039;ll be trying DMT (in DimitriSpice&#039;s various forms) in the future as well, but for now I&#039;m trying to get my T-7 dosages correct for my body. For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m about 5&#039;10 and 150 pounds ((1.8 meters, 68kg/10.7 stone).

				oral LD50 is estimated at 62mg/kg. 0.6mg/kg insufflated. <br /><br />The risk of seizure is not necessarily dose dependent or route of administration. Pulmonary edema and diffuse aveolar damage are naturally increased by insufflation but still present in a lesser degree in oral dosing.<br /><br />Insufflation of an unknown amount was responsible for death. It was CLAIMED that 30 mg was insufflated....but the post mortem studies done showed that levels detected were far higher than what would have been expected at that dose.<br /><br />http://library.ouhsc.edu/epub/dissertations/Curtis-Byron-D.pdf

				Thanks for the info N2DEEP!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been talking to a friend about a drug we took once.&nbsp; I thought the guy said 2c-2-t, he thinks it was 2c-t-7.&nbsp; friend took a large dose, thought he was going to die, puked for half an hour, other girl snorted it, thought it was molly, had a horrible time.&nbsp; She is drug free now.<br /><br />me, well I took 15-20mg&nbsp; lines 3 times in the night, best fry ever.&nbsp; tracers, raining diamonds, car head lights were amazing, music caused the best closed eye visuals ever.<br /><br />FROGTRAP: please tell me what kinds of visuals you get.<br /><br />PS. I hate ignorant dealers. I hate street dealers.

				Yeah, thanks N2DEEP, looks like I have a bit of reading to do tonight. :)<br /><br />Sounds fun, Trippyskies. Well, at least your part does. :) I&#039;m hoping my next dose will be visual, so I can let you know what they&#039;re like (also because I want to see some damned visuals). If I don&#039;t get much off baseline from 20mg, I&#039;m probably going to jump to 30mg next week and see what happens. If I do get sufficiently off baseline, my next dose will be 25mg as planned.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update the thread on Monday and let you know what the 20mg was like. I think I&#039;m going to edit the first post to add a quick-view list of dosages and effect when I do, but we&#039;ll see if that makes sense when I go to do it.<br /><br />And yeah, ignorant dealers (I guess that&#039;s probably most dealers...) are shit. Glad I found the Road, where at least I have a selection of dealers and a forum where they actually get reviewed. This place blows my mind. :D

				I agree, this place is amazing.&nbsp; everything about it is amazing.<br /><br />I love how vendors have to maintain their reputation by selling primo.&nbsp; Price, fuck it, price can change, but product must stay premium especially when dealing with RC&#039;s.&nbsp; Bunk RC&#039;s can kill people.&nbsp; Try bunk once, do a huge dose, get good stuff, do a huge dose, death.<br /><br />oh danger, it&#039;s my middle name.

				Well, 20mg isn&#039;t my active dose either... Felt like I was so close, but that&#039;s how I felt with 15mg too... Like, my visual scene gets a &quot;velvety&quot; feel to it, and small details (like wood-grain) looked somehow more defined, but that&#039;s about all. Same thing happened this time, where I get really comfortable and lie down, only to fall asleep for like two or three hours. And that&#039;s only 7 hours after ingestion... Didn&#039;t feel poisoned or sedated, really, just comfortable, it felt nice to close my eyes, and next thing I know my roommate was waking me up asking if I was okay a couple of hours later. When I woke up, I was still felt the T-7 as much as I did before I fell asleep, and stayed awake for another five hours or so.<br /><br />I have no idea what the deal is with me falling asleep, but it could just be that I haven&#039;t taken enough to have it really effect me yet. We&#039;ll see next weekend. I&#039;m debating whether I should continue on my 5mg dosage bump or just jump from 20mg to 30mg next time. <br /><br />Anyone heard of people sleeping on 2C-T-7? Is that a danger sign? I never seem to want to sleep on any other psychedelic, but I know my doses for the other ones I like to take... I can sleep on 50ug of LSD, but not 150ug, so maybe that&#039;s all it is.
