				You can find any recipe that uses cannabis and substitute hash.&nbsp; Hash is extremely variable as far as potency goes, so I can&#039;t advise very well on how much for you to use.&nbsp; However, it&#039;s typically more potent than average weed, and I usually use below-average weed to cook with.&nbsp; When I do that, I tend to use 0.5-1.5 grams of bud per person.<br /><br />Crush it up, mix it in with some sort of oil (butter, vegetable oil, olive oil, lard...) and let it stay nice and warm/hot on the stove.&nbsp; Keep it set LOW, though, you don&#039;t want it to be boiling.&nbsp; Let the cannabinoids extract into the oil for &gt;30 minutes (up to an hour or two).&nbsp; At this point I would normally strain the weed with a strainer or cheese cloth, but with hash you might just leave it in, I&#039;m not sure.<br />Anyway, you can now use this oil to cook anything that oil goes into: brownies, cookies, cake, spaghetti, stir fry, spread onto bread...you get the idea.<br /><br />There&#039;s also the option of alcohol extractions/tinctures, but that&#039;s a lesson for another day.<br /><br /><br />Bonus: the best &quot;cannabutter&quot; is made in a slow cooker (Crock Pot).&nbsp; Just set that thing on &quot;Warm,&quot; throw in the butter (actual, unsalted butter, by the stick) and ground up bud.&nbsp; Stir thoroughly after it melts, then put the lid on.&nbsp; Leave for 1-3 days to slowly extract at low heat.&nbsp; You should stir it around every once in a while when you remember it, but each time you open it it&#039;s going to reek up your house for hours, so be ready.&nbsp; After a few days, strain through cheese cloth and use as normal.<br />The main reason, as far as I understand, that this is better-tasting than a faster method like I described first, has to do mainly with how much chlorophyll/other plant junk gets extracted with the cannabinoids.&nbsp; At the higher heat of the stove, more chemicals can be extracted, some of which make the butter taste like cannabis or at least &quot;plant-ish&quot; (This is also why I don&#039;t recommend the methods that call for adding water to extract out the chlorophyll: some of this chlorophyll-laden water gets trapped in the butter when it separates, and affects the taste.)<br />Also, high heat allows some stuff (probably mostly oil? not sure) to combust a little, which leaves a sort of burnt taste.&nbsp; Slow, low heat prevents both of these issues.

				I would not bother messing about making fancy cakes.<br /><br />For an easy way to consume hash follow this....<br /><br />Crumble up the hash - pur half a cup of milk into a saucepan and heat till it simmers - stir well and throw in half a gram of hash or up to three grams for the real committed. <br /><br />Pour the heated milk/hash into a cup - add half a spoon of instant coffee - add cold milk and one teaspoon of sugar.<br /><br />Stir but wait till its cool enough to drink in one then drink like a shot or some medicine. Taste is not the aim of this creation. It tastes like shit and hash always will!<br /><br />Have a chocolate bar ready to eat after drinking. This takes the bitter taste away and helps the crumbs go down the hatch.<br /><br />Wait 30 mins or so and it begins!<br /><br />We&#039;re talking red eyed stoned for 12 hours or so. <br /><br />Great for those occasions when you have a day free.&nbsp; ;D

				Firecrackers - peanut butter + biscuits ( I use a Salada ) + Tin Foil + Oven 350f for 20-25 mins.<br /><br />Sprinkle your weed onto the peanut butter then enclose it like a sammich, wrap in foil then chuck it in the oven.<br /><br />Easier than pie. The fat content in the peanut butter absorbs the THC and voila! Organic works best but any kind should do!<br /><br />Google it, there&#039;s some good tuts around.<br /><br />
