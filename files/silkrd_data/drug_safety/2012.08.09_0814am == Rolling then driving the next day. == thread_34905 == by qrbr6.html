				Alright so I need to drive somewhere at 8am the next day and need to know if it&#039;s safe to take mdma the night before (maybe at around 8pm at the latest). Of course I&#039;m going to be very tired the next day but I want to know if it will impair my driving and if I am pulled over is there any chance of some sort of drug test? Thanks for your time.

				I&#039;ve drove rolling before. I was on a road trip. I drove for about six hours before stopping. This was at night around 1 in the morning. So there wasn&#039;t that much traffic i needed to worry about. So i would imagine you&#039;ll be just fine the next day after rolling to drive. I do not condone or endorse driving under the influence of any substance. I won&#039;t do it again, that&#039;s for sure. (Not becauase i wrecked or had a bad time. I just feel like i wasted the roll focusing on the road) I think the only way you would get tested is if they found some mdma in the vehicle. They would use that to help their case in court.

				This is probably irrelevant because I had dirty roll pills but after crashing and driving home from friends houses I would easily run a light. This happened twice out of lets say around ten times, thank god it was very early morning 1-2AM with no traffic. I would also easily lose focus the next day.<br /><br />Just saying everyone reacts differently and sometimes your brain needs a break after being fried.

				I guess I&#039;ll give it a miss this weekend then.<br /><br />Nice buyer stats btw pal, good work supporting the road. I&#039;ve spent just over half what you have.

				Thanks mang.&nbsp; However, IMO my stats is only big as a piece of sand compared to other members.<br /><br />Anyways, just be safe and try to get ample rest and food if you are going to roll and drive the next day.

				Well if you really want to roll then roll out, you should sleep all the way up to the point of rolling, do it, then stay awake and redose when you start to drive.<br /><br />Personally I drive great when I&#039;m rolling, even on the comedown. The energy I get helps me focus a lot, but I like driving anyway so it all depends on what you like. If you have a friend going with you it would be much better.

				Yeah, I drive all the time rolling. As long as you&#039;re not rolling tits and so filled up with euphoria that you can&#039;t pay attention to the road, you&#039;ll be fine. I find that a low dose of MDMA or a normal dose of Methylone makes me alert, and I actually drive better than I do sober because I&#039;m paying attention to everything that&#039;s happening.

				It&#039;s definitely relaxing the next day after a roll, taking into account you got good quality and didn&#039;t over do it.

				I have found the best test of if you are good to drive is this:<br /><br />If you need to ask, don&#039;t do it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve known plenty of people (including me) who have driven high, drunk and/or withdrawing and while I don&#039;t have any horror stories as a result, I certainly wouldn&#039;t recommend it. Even being really tired is a pretty bad thing to be while behind the wheel, even more so during rush hour. <br /><br />For most reasonably responsible people who wouldn&#039;t drive if they didn&#039;t feel like they were capable the risk is not so much in killing themselves or someone else, its in doing something that just a little bit dumb (running a light a half second too late or forgetting to turn your lights on) that can get you pulled over. Once you get pulled over, if you have ANY drugs in your system, you&#039;re looking at losing your license. And those little mistakes are easy enough to make when stone sober. The only times I&#039;ve ever been pulled over were both when I was completely sober, once because I didn&#039;t have my lights on (i&#039;d just come out of a very well lit carpark and didn&#039;t even notice) and the other was because I missed my turning and was now going REAL slow with my indicator on the whole time to make sure I found it this time. <br /><br />Basically, be really careful. That fact that you are asking at all means you&#039;re reasonably sane about it and there probably isn&#039;t a risk of carnage, but that doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t end up in trouble. A DUI can wreck your life in lots of ways. <br />

				I&#039;ve drove after rolling (same night), almost got in an accident( was my first time rolling), but rolling the next day is just like driving sober, except your a little tired, and depressed.
