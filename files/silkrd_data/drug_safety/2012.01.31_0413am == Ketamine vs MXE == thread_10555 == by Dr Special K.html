				Imagine ketamine but it lasts WAYYY longer and to me, feels a bit more &quot;trippy&quot; than ketamine if you know what i mean.&nbsp; With ketamine you come down in 30mins-1hour, with MXE its kinda like a 3-4+ hour thing.&nbsp; Very similar effects however, I enjoy MXE more but I wish it didnt last as long so i could just take a bump when i feel like it and be zooming for 30 mins and then come down fine like i did on ket.&nbsp; Both Ketamine and Methoxetamine have been used to help depression, hell they were talking about ketamines anti-depression abilities on NPR the other day!&nbsp; ( USA&#039;s national radio station)

Look at the &quot;Dolphin Man&quot; John C. Lily, inventor of the isolation tank. That dude spent months shooting up ketamine rigorously on an hourly basis whenever he was awake. No Olney lesions, no kidney or bladder issues, no noticeable problems whatsoever (besides being insane enough to invent an isolation tank and dedicate a huge part of his life to teach dolphins how to talk with humans while tripping on Kate, of course).<br /><br />Now, if you go on week-long binges snorting half your body weight in ketamine every other day, you can damn well expect to have problems.

				MXE is less taxing on the body and is a less intense high. It retains a lot of the theraputic effects of K but loses some of its harmful effects (mainly on the Liver/Bladder).

				Haven&#039;t tried K. I can compare MXE to another dissociative like DXM (cough syrup, ie. &quot;robotripping&quot;). MXE feels like a much cleaner high than DXM. With DXM you feel kind of zombiefied, and look drunk. If you don&#039;t overdo your MXE you can function rather normally (not saying you should drive!) while percieving everything through a slightly altered state. I&#039;ve noticed MXE really gives you the urge to come back for more though. I don&#039;t know if its a physiological effect (like dopamine reinforcement) or just a psychological thing because it&#039;s so pleasent but you definitely feel like bumping a little line later. Just have to keep it under control and it can be very therapeutic. :)

				I love the K euphoria much more. If you binge on MXE one night, you&#039;ll be high until almost 24 hours. The high, like others have said, is more trippy. To me it feels dirtier. I&#039;ll take K over MXE any day.

				&nbsp;The trip the first time I did mxe it was fucking awesome, a cascade of emotion. You don&#039;t get open eye visuals on it, . when I shut my eyes it felt like a caterine wheel was going through space and I was sitting on it. The day after doing some I felt the happiest I have been for sometime, and had a really postive few days. Every time I&#039;ve done it after that, it&#039;s been good but not quite as fun and I haven&#039;t been able to get the deluge thoughts that go through your head and spent the next day feeling disconcerted. <br /><br />can anyone compare really high doses off the two. what are the respective k holes and m holes like? I&#039;ve not gone over 100mgs with mxe and yet to take ket.
