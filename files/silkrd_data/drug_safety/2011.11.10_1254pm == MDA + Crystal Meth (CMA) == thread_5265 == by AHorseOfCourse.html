				I just ordered 250mg of MDA from seakong, and it should arrive around the same time as Heisenburg&#039;s .2g of crystal meth (both are new sellers). Besides hoping that my orders arrive at all, I want to make sure I get the dosing right so I can have a good time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never done MDA before (I&#039;ve done X pills laced with speed though), so I&#039;m curious has anyone done these together? Is it cool, lame, sketchy, nauseous -- what? I&nbsp; plan to smoke the first .08g of CMA at the start, then a hit or two of OG Kush weed. I&#039;ll also be sipping on a 3-4g GHB/cranberry juice cocktail over an hour or more. How much MDA should I do at the start? Snort it? Also, is MDA better than pure MDMA?<br /><br />Lastly, I&#039;m thinking of doing a small serving of shrooms + CMA (smoked) + hit or two of 420 + 3/4g of GHB over 2 hours, in the near future. Any good?<br /><br />-Horse

				Would you mind doing each seperate? So people interested in both products can see the purity of each. I am not interested in meth at all just the MDA

				Agreed with gumby. Buyers interested in ordering from new sellers need informative reviews about the product, especially heisenberg because there is such a high demand for meth and rarely any legitimate sellers. That&#039;s what the .2 samples are listed for, anyways- for experienced SR members to rate and review everything about the transaction, seller, and product so that potential buyers will have enough feedback to make an informed decision. I&#039;m not as familiar with seakong, but I&#039;m sure he&#039;s in the same boat (especially if there are other MDA sellers). If it were me, I&#039;d try each product alone before mixing, so as to provide other users with good information. <br /><br />Either way, I don&#039;t know how good of an idea it is to mix GHB, a central nervous system depressant, and meth, a central nervous system stimulant. Perhaps in small doses it&#039;d be fine, but those kind of mixes always make me nervous. Be safe (:

				My understanding is that MDA and MDMA are partly amphetamine. Consistant use of MDMA over a period of a few days gives only speed like effects depending on its quality, eventually the good part wears off though no matter how much you re-dose - MDA i&#039;m not sure about but I suspect the same,&nbsp; I&#039;ve only take smallish doses of it.<br /><br />If you take meth you&#039;ll enhance the amphetamine aspect of the drug and that could possibly override the empathogenic and in the case of MDA hallucinogenic effects. MDA despite being more hallucinogenic then MDMA still isn&#039;t that strong of a psychedelic so i wouldn&#039;t be trying to dampened it - you want to take it with some that brings out the hallucinogenic aspect (2cb). I don&#039;t use meth don&#039;t like it much, but I think use it for what its made for and that is when everything else stops working and you want to keep going, then take meth.<br /><br />

				never take meth in conjunction with mdma/mda. Neurotoxicity from those substances happens because your body tries to replace the depleted serotonin with dopamine. this creates free radicals(which is why anti-oxidants are very important as pre and post dose) and can lead to a varity of ailments. The point is meth raises more dopamine and nor-epinephrine then serotonin and this multiplies the neurotoxicity infinitely. You really feel it the next day and will hate yourself. So save them for different days and enjoy each separately. Also after your roll remember that l tryptophan is your best friend
