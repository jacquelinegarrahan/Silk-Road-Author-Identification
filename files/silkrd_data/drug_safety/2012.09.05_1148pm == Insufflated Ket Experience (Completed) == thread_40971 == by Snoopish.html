				Well I haven&#039;t had a lot of ketamine experience and want a good time this evening. I figured I may as well hit things strong. In my defense, I had a killer DMT experience earlier and wanted to keep the ball rollin.<br /><br />Here we go:<br /><br />Target dosage: 95-100mg<br /><br /><br />T: 0:00 -- snorted two lines of ~35mg or so so about 70ish. Got another 30 lined up. <br />T: 0:05 -- writing this. Ears ringing. Getting...strange. head heavy. Hmm...dizzy maybe. World may be threatening to upend.<br />T 0:10 -- numbness in mouth and face. Loss of sensitivity in rest of body. Feeling good. Disoriented..<br />T 0:18 -- another line down. About 15mg. Walked around for water and dimmed lights. I became aware of my breathing while staggering around. The world feels heavy but good. Body is feeling distant. <br />T:0:20 --finished 100mg ket. Staggered doses may distance effects but I&#039;m typically susceptible to drugs. Everything is good. Not a care.<br />I&#039;ll try to update and keep you all in the know!<br />T: :30 -- effects of last line couples with the rest. Depth perception is off. I head to my bedroom and find how heavily I&#039;m shuffling. Changing where I look seems to produce tunnel effects. After I lay down and look at my feet they seem so far away. My body is heavy and it feels really good. <br /><br />T :?? -- The rest of this is more estimates as I&#039;m coming down and trying to piece things together. I laid down for a bit enjoying how good my body felt. I took a small dose of ket before but I didn&#039;t realize before how...healthy it made me feel. I felt really in tune with my body: likely because all of my aches and pains that I normally took for granted were gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />T :40ish -- effects from first lines are dissipating. I go outside to check the mail. Stairs prove an interesting scenario. I pause for a long while before going down. I feel rather content. It&#039;s not at all like benzos make me feel and yet I keep coming back to the comparison.<br /><br />T :45 -- I go back in and lay down. My mind feels relaxed and I close my eyes and find myself calmly exploring the corridors of my own thoughts for another 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />T 1:00 -- The dissociative effects are gone but I still feel pretty good. Head is still fuzzy and I find my body is still okay with functioning without protests (no aches or pains). <br /><br />I realize I wrote some of this while barely functional at a certain point but I will leave the points as is in case there is something somebody can glean from what I wrote during some of the more disabling part of the experience.&nbsp; I&#039;m using the initial thread time as a measure to approximate how much time passed since my pen and paper went neglected soon after my first bump. It has been about 70 minutes since I took the first line. <br /><br />Very good experience! I tried to be brief but explicit in my experience. I didn&#039;t expect Ket&#039;s effect on me to be quite so...intangible. A very powerful drug that has earned my respect.<br /><br />&nbsp;It might be beneficial for me to go back and reflect on the experience later but I wanted to throw this on here and see if these sorts of experiences were enjoyed/appreciated/useful on here. I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;ve had no adverse effects from my dosing at present. I am hungry but can&#039;t say that&#039;s because of the drug :P<br /><br /><br />Cheers!<br />

				I think you moved around too much... almost fighting it. Have no idea how you were able to keep it together at T0:20 still. :-)<br /><br />Next time try doing 90mg - 100mg in one go, but lie down in a very comfortable spot (bed or sofa) where you won&#039;t be disturbed with some nice music on (even headphones are good). And don&#039;t move - just let it take you and melt into the bed. Close your eyes and fly around your own thoughts.

I did lots of reading on Ket and K-holes and all that but I think the anxiety got the better of me this time. I had to assure myself I was okay multiple times. I&#039;ll give it a while so my body doesn&#039;t have any tolerance and try it again. <br /><br />Cheers

				Yeah dude nice try you did okay. However moving around, going down stairs (bad idea for multiple reasons!), is not the best thing to do, to enjoy it in my opinion.<br /><br />Small bumps while socialising might be nice to give you a &quot;drunk&quot; type effect, but if you&#039;re going to rail 100mg, you need to really let go. There is nothing to be scared of. You have around 45 minutes to really bliss out on K, I would plan things better. This is how I like it:<br /><br />Set up your hi-fi with an hour of music, preferably an hour long DJ mix to avoid interruptions. Put on headphones, or have it nice and loud.<br /><br />Take your 100mg or whatever all in one go. You now have 5 or 10 minutes to lie down get *really* comfy and totally flat, like you are about to meditate, put on your music, close your eyes, relax all your muscles. Honestly, you will love it. When it feels like you&#039;re falling through the floor, don&#039;t get worried and get up and walk around, just go with it. Don&#039;t open your eyes, but &quot;look&quot; and you will see.<br /><br />K is so safe, and I can&#039;t imagine anyone having a &quot;bad trip&quot;. Unless you are trying to &quot;not fall into the hole&quot;, and somehow think that the hole is bad. I read K-hole, it has a strange name, and &quot;hole&quot; doesn&#039;t sound awesome. I would call it the K-heaven. It&#039;s just the place you go when you are no longer worried about your body (or even have one). It&#039;s basically like sleeping, but having an amazing dream, that is so &quot;real&quot;.<br /><br />Have fun next time!

				Good advice, Cake. Thanks. I usually get a bit of anxiety when I take doses that erowid say are on the &quot;stronger&quot; side so that trashed a bit of the experience. I&#039;ll do more of what you said and try to find some good background music to run and just sit and enjoy it. <br /><br />Any music suggests for K trips would be lovely!<br /><br /><br />Cheers!

				Not a bad song! Some of the beats lost me but they might seem better under K. I&#039;d say the same thing about the vocals. Overall it was fun!
