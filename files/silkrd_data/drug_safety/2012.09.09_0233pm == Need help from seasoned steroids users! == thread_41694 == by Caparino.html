				First time? If your under 25 years old then wait. Don&#039;t complicate things, get 30mls of test-e or test-cyp @ 200mg/ml run 1 ml every 3rd day.<br /><br />Get nolvadex and keep on hand in case your nipples get puffy and sore then take nolva as soon as this occurs,&nbsp; this doesn&#039;t for must though. If you don&#039;t need it&nbsp; then take 20mg every day until the box is gone (30) start taking them 4 weeks after your last shot.<br /><br />Depending on your size at the moment eat around 5,000 calories per day from all different meat sources carb sources and don&#039;t forget fat and calcium.&nbsp; Drop your calories after nolva (PCT) but work out your new calories for your new bodyweight.<br /><br />If you can get HCG then get it as well, look up dosages, I would start this from about week 3.<br /><br />Train like a beast and sleep like a beast wagon.<br /><br />

				Cap,<br /><br />The easiest answer of all your questions is yes, synthetic testosterone (whether injected or pill) = anabolic steroids.<br /><br />As far as the rest, there are sooo many different forms of steroids, each with there own half life and differing traits, that there&#039;s no answer possible for the other questions.&nbsp; For example, Test cyp or Sustonon will give you mass while winstrol is for leaning out, however they both have significantly different requirements for taking it.&nbsp; Some water based roids will need to be injected daily or every 2-3 days while Sust you can take weekly or twice a week.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you do a large stack you&#039;ll want to get some Nolvadex to avoid bitch tits (gynecomasia).<br /><br />For the most part you&#039;ll want to start your dosage off small and peak it at the midpoint of your cycle and then taper off.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend finding a copy of Nathan Phillips &quot;Anabolic Reference Guide&quot; as a starting point.&nbsp; While not the most up to date info (though almost all forms of juice are old so there isn&#039;t much up to date info needed.&nbsp; But if you jump into GH or IGF or any of the crazier stuff you&#039;ll want newer data.&nbsp; But if your doing the really new crazy stuff you&#039;ve got a massive bank roll and are most likely aiming to go pro in some sport)<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak to which vendors to use here as I haven&#039;t touched the stuff in years.&nbsp; I will say this, though, you can easily put on 30+ pounds of muscle in a few cycles but the big issue to look at is whether or not your body can handle the weight.&nbsp; It really effects your joints and tendons.&nbsp; Also, you will see personality changes so make sure to keep a lot of weed on hand to mellow you out.

				Wow, thank you guys for all the info!&nbsp; I&#039;m a complete newb to the steroid game so all your help is much appreciated guys!<br /><br />I&#039;m 20 years old, 5&#039;11, 155 lb, and I&#039;ve been on and off in the gym before but I&#039;ve been steadily going to the gym every other day for four weeks now. Weight isn&#039;t an issue on this matter, I&#039;d just like to speed up muscle gains on the idea that after a 10-week cycle my muscle memory gained from it will help me out in the future. Ideally I&#039;d like to bulk up super fast, but I suppose that&#039;ll go away after I stop the cycle. So upon your info I&#039;m prompted to ask you a couple more questions.<br /><br />What&#039;s the best way to cycle so I maintain my muscle gain afterwards?<br /><br />What are the side-effects from IM steroids?<br /><br />(obligatory +1 for all your help)

				do you have two threads going about this topic? <br /><br />IMO your too young. Keeping your gains is all about recovery for this if its a testosterone only cycle then you will need HCG, Nolvadex. Dont drop your calories down to low when you come off you need the calories to maintain the new muscle.<br /><br />You should train constantly for at least 6 years to prime your body for what is to come, I also recommend not cycling until your over 25 at least. Steroids are serious business your messing with one of the most important hormones in the body but also messing with the supplier of those hormones. <br /><br />If you do steroids incorrectly it can results in you being on testosterone replacement therapy for the rest of your life, not to mention depression etc etc. Your body has a very smart and effective system at keeping your test levels stable something most people over look when cycling.

				You should definitly wait with juicing.<br /><br />Get your exercise routine down first!!!<br />Do more research on forums(don&#039;t pay attention to those who take insanely high doses btw).<br /><br />And pls don&#039;t take the advice of just randomly eating 5000 Kcal&#039;s -_-.<br /><br />Take the time to make a foodschedule.<br />Calculate how much protein you need,then look at how much fat a day you must eat and of course how much carbs.<br /><br />Also determine how much the % of your bodyfat is.<br />If you are high in fat and you take testosterone or other aromatizing steroids you are MUCH more likely to get bad sides.<br /><br />i&#039;d reccommend 250 testosterone a week to begin with.<br />You&#039;ll see how you&#039;ll react to it.If you believe your bodyfat is very low 500 testosterone TOPS!<br /><br />Keep in mind i&#039;m talking about % of bodyfat so out of your total bodyweight how much is fat.<br /><br />But i must say i agree with Kingpin,you are too young.Your test levels should be very high still.&nbsp; I&#039;m also aware that some are too pigheaded to listen so better inform yourself before you waste your money.<br />If you don&#039;t inform yourself some more i can garanty you will lose&nbsp; your gains very quickly.<br /><br />In regards of your food schedule,i like to use this calculator www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/.<br />Keep your proteins up most importantly and depending of your goals you&#039;ll see how much carbs you must consume.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Cap,<br /><br />The issue isn&#039;t just your age, which Kingpin pointed out, but also how many years (yes years) you have lifting.&nbsp; At age 20 your test is only starting to kick into gear so you have know idea what your body is capable of.&nbsp; Hit the gym hard for a few years (and by that I&#039;m not talking a juiced based workout, but rather hit your major muscle groups once a week and your minor ones twice - this will give you enough rest time to actually grow which Kingpin pointed out) which will build your natural muscle density.&nbsp; By the time your in you mid twenties you&#039;ll hit a wall and at that point you can start cycling.&nbsp; As it stands right now roids will be a waste, you don&#039;t have enough of a foundation to make lasting gains.&nbsp; Would you grow, yes, but you&#039;ll lose most of it all without the muscle memory to grow in the future.&nbsp; At a minimum, get two years of hard lifting and then look into hitting the juice.&nbsp; Trust me, if you don&#039;t have an idea what it&#039;s like benching 200 and squatting 300 lbs naturally (as an example, at a minimum) you won&#039;t have the either the form nor the mental state to juice and double those numbers.&nbsp; You need to understand how to call up strength, both physically and mentally, before you can push it to the extreme.

				don&#039;t do it this early or you WILL get injured or get problems with your joints.<br /><br />train natural for 1-2 years and if you still feel like it by then go for the juice.&nbsp; everything else is irresponsible and silly.

				Hah, yeah I had two threads going; one in rumor mill for who I should purchase from and another because the offtopic threads are usually less busy and more helpful with these kinda questions. <br /><br />But I&#039;m going with the overall consensus and waiting until I&#039;m at least 24 to take steroids. Or fuck it, I might not even want to take them at that point since I&#039;ll be at the threshold of my career by then. Thanks for all the info everyone :)<br /><br />Obligatory +1s all around

				Hey, <br /><br />&nbsp;An Ideal cycle would be <br /><br />2 x 250 shots of Test e a week 3 days apart, this produces little to no side effects. <br />if you want to really go for it as a beginner try:<br />2x250 shots of Test 3 a week 3 days apart and 3 x 100 shots of deca per week (this was my starting cycle) <br /><br />People say when you mix the deca in that you have more issues with oestrogen conversion, I had none but your best bet to avoid bitch tits is to work in Nolvadex during your cycle and then take both nolvadex and Clomid starting from week 4. Depending on the absorption rate of your chosen roid you may have to start PCT (post cycle therapy) earlier or later. The idea is that you are taking it when the hormone level drops. <br /><br />Steroids is not a magic answer. Weight training at 1hr a day min with 2 days off a week, cod liver oil and vitamin supplements every night. High protein diet, you should be eating plenty of Turkeys and chickens :P veg also, however avoid low carb food that does nothing but fill you up like salad etc.. <br /><br />Buy a tub of 100% microfiltered protein powder, creatine powder and yummy nesquik with added vitamins.. The minute you get back from your session you need 2 scoops of protein powder, 1 of nesquik and low fat milk. <br /><br />20 mins before you go to the gym a glass of water with a half scoop of creatine, and if you wanna lose a bit of weight try L-caratine (sp) <br /><br />If you dont sleep you wont grow, simple as, less internet and more dreams, at least 10 hrs a night. Also drink fuck loads of water<br /><br />Do not take oral steroids, it will fuck with your liver horribly.. If you must, get some milk thistle from a health shop and guzzle it down nightly! <br /><br />I have just finished recovering from a motorbike accident so I am going to start out my training light with the Test e, Deca regime in about 2 weeks so just before x mas. If you want we can do the cycle together and make shopping lists for food / recepies, schedule jab days work out training sessions etc.. So you know what your doing. If your cool doing it on your own then I wish you the best of luck. Stick to the above and you will become a fucking monster... Always remember though that whilst on the cycle you will retain a lot of water in your muscles, so expect to lose about 30% to 40% gains, you still gained 60% 70 percent so thats cool, and with hard training after and plenty of creatine and good food you can keep a lot... <br /><br />Train hard little grasshopper <br /><br />ACE<br /><br />
