				So it looks like I&#039;m one of the lucky ones that get to test out the Dalai Lamas from NN and the White Speakers from CB.&nbsp; ;D<br />NN posts the Dalai Lamas as 250ug and many users post as 200+ug.<br />CB posts the White Speakers as +200mg MDMA and I have found mixed reviews about this but for the most part by &#039;word of mouth&#039; they seem to be very strong as well, or at the very least, decent.<br /><br />I have plenty of experience with XTC and a little with Lucy.<br /><br />(Assuming they both arrive) To start, I was planning on taking 1/2 of the white speaker or 1/4, then 20 minutes later another 1/4. Waiting about 20-40 more minutes and taking 1/2 a tab of the Dalai Lama.<br />They are both considered strong and I have never &quot;candy-flipped&quot; before. I was wondering what you all thought of this, but mostly wanted to ask if you&#039;d recommend some (fun) things I should do while tripping balls?<br /><br />I plan to do this with my lover as well (her first time with both), and wanted to entertain her while still keeping her safe.<br /><br />I got the ecstasy part down, so you don&#039;t need to inform me much about that. (unless dealing with the combination...)<br />Note: I&#039;m not a noob, or an idiot. So spare me the treatment, thank you anyway... hahaha<br /><br />Please add your input below and thank you!<br />Remember, fun stuff and safety. (Can also be cool, interesting, a trip, mind blowing, deep, exciting, ...etc.) :)

				Me and my girl also start with taking the lsd first which is normally 200-250+ ug and half a speaker and its a really mind blowing experience espically if its with someone you really love, but as you say your not as exp with lucy so start with half of lucy and half a speaker imo. If your doing it with your girl i wouldnt really try to plan it as from personal preference with my girl we just see what happens and its always been amazing! planning on trips isnt always good tbh! Had some life changing spiritual expierences with my girl with trips espically like stuff you cant even explain =) ENJOY!

				Normally I&#039;d take the whole tab... the thing with acid is that redosing won&#039;t power up your trip at all, just make it last longer. But if this is your first candyflip, you might want to err on the side of caution... so your plan seems solid. Happy flipping! :)
