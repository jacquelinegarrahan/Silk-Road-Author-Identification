				its more like you take ketamine, and after you wake up from being passed out that you realize you actually feel good and that life isnt too bad and its time to clean the house after the party as opposed to suffering from depression and using ket to treat the symptoms.<br /><br />systematically using ket to cure depression is a difficult thing.Ket can be addictive and very habit forming

From what I read the depression symptoms come back between 1 week to a month, which was about right for me.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now I don&#039;t need Ketamine, but I definitely recognize some feelings that come up when I start to want to get some. I have progressively&nbsp; improved my thought process along the way, Ketamine helped me come face to face with some serious issues about me taking personal responsibility for my thoughts and actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;For me it has been a tremendous aid, I think that if it&#039;s to be used medicinally I think it&#039;s important to have the right mind set towards it. Ketamine isn&#039;t going to help you, the things that you experience and figure out and then integrate into your life will help you.<br /><br />&nbsp; The experiences I had were of immense love, and submitting all of my negativity. I must say that I do understand the habit forming side, if you start to depend on it to feel good it can become a bad thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;As far as dosage, as I understand it. They use 100-150mg and send you into a K hole basically, when you&#039;ve come out of the experience you would have cognitive therapy to discuss feelings and what you went through.<br /><br />&nbsp; As you go through each session your view on the world and yourself can change a lot. Many people experience God or Jesus or Buddah, and many believe they will survive life after death, and much more. This is the idea behind Ketamine, not to be used like prozac where you take a daily pill to &quot;balance&quot; you out; but a tool into your consciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp; Sessions for me can be very intense and I wouldn&#039;t have the emotional resilience to do it habitually, it&#039;s seriously too much on the mind. So I can&#039;t see a healthy person wanting to do this all of the time.<br /><br />Also Ketamine causes a bit of insomnia for me, which is why I can&#039;t do it all of the time. Sleep is so important to keep me in a happy mood. Once a week or twice a month would be good. Exercise has helped a ton as well, which for me the K helped me be more body conscious.<br /><br />Sorry for the super long post, hope this helps you. :) be safe and good luck.<br />

				thank you.<br /><br /><br />i think i accidentally k-holed but i&#039;m not sure. i don&#039;t know if i was just having very vivid and unusual lucid dreams or not. in this state i couldn&#039;t move. i was also going in and out of trance-like states where i wasn&#039;t thinking of anything at all, i felt like i wasn&#039;t even there. And at times i felt like i was &#039;stuck&#039;... hard to explain. I don&#039;t remember a lot of it, but at the same time it was very vivid.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Is this what a k-hole like, or was i just dreaming?<br /><br /><br />i did this the day before yesterday. i was very depressed, and have been depressed for a long time. i now feel wonderful. i also took some adderall today... and usually when i take adderall, i get VERY depressed during the come-down. but this time i&#039;m not depressed at all !<br /><br /><br />maybe i should always take ketamine the day before taking amphetamines?

				How much did you take?<br />The K experience, at least with me has never resembled a dream state. It&#039;s always been it&#039;s own thing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never mixed amphetamines and K, amphetamines aren&#039;t my thing anymore. I wouldn&#039;t recommend any friend of mine to do them anywhere near each other, because I don&#039;t know what/if any adverse reactions would be.<br /><br />The k-hole, to try and describe it. Is just a loss of ego, feelings of immense love, experiencing oneness with the universe and all things, seeing things I&#039;ve done and said and how I could have been better, all combined with a kind of out body type feeling. <br /><br />Words are completely useless to try and put into words the experiences I&#039;ve had, I think it&#039;s more about what you take out of it. Whether or not you &quot;hole&quot; or not doesn&#039;t matter to much, if you can learn something at 25mg then stick with that.

After a session of K I feel great and more connected with the world, I&#039;m able to not let small things anger me because that love is so deeply seated in me I&#039;m at peace most of the time. So no matter what I do the next day I&#039;ll feel great! So sure if it feels good I&#039;d go for it.<br /><br />Your K experience is similar to the way I&#039;ve done it in the past, just sniffing until I&#039;m about where I want to be. I do know that every K session is different, so maybe you&#039;ll experience something new next time instead of the lucid dream state; who knows.<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;m excited to hear how K helps you, I hope it helps with your depression. I think it&#039;s a great tool for that.

				In my experience, which is vast, (pretty much 80% of my friends are moderate/heavy k users and up until early 2012 I was using ketamine every day) using street ketamine recreationally to treat depression is a stupid idea.

When I was using K all the time I was a shadow of the man I am now, and I have know K to turn good people suicidal, with tragic endings.<br /><br />Seriously, please take my advice.

Just because one person can&#039;t handle self-medication doesn&#039;t mean others can&#039;t. It&#039;s this same mentality that causes irrational drug fear. There is a reason why Ketamine and St.John&#039;s Wart aren&#039;t on the same Isle at WholeFoods lol<br /><br />&nbsp; Just like with drinkers, you have a percentage who drink everyday and fuck up their lives. You have drinkers who know their limit and don&#039;t drink everyday, you have other people (like me) who don&#039;t drink at all but use some drugs in moderation.<br /><br />&nbsp;An obsessive personality who&#039;s incapable of regulating any part of his/her life will find something to fall down and fuck up with. I just don&#039;t like those sob stories, after school scpecials; Using Ketamine everyday is not how it&#039;s suppose to be used for depression. If you doing any drug, like Ketamine, everyday then your going to run into problems.<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry you went through that, but there&#039;s no reason to be scared from you story.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a story about personal addiction, than the dangers of Ketamine.

				If you feel you can control it then I guess it is up to you.... All I am saying is, be careful that it doesn&#039;t become a crutch for your depression.

				I feel for you Scientist.&nbsp; I suffer from horrible depression and have been hospitalized three times.&nbsp; I started using MXE about a year ago and it totally changed my brain, in a good way.&nbsp; It was like a 180 degree change.&nbsp; I went from being severely depressed and my memory being completely gone.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t remember anything.&nbsp; I lost about 3 years of my life after a breakdown in 2009.&nbsp; It&#039;s like I had amnesia.&nbsp; MXE totally reversed my memory problems and I actually felt &quot;Happy&quot; for the first time in maybe 20 years.&nbsp; It was totally bizarre.&nbsp; Unfortunately quality MXE has gone down the shitter over the past 6 months or so.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an addictive personality at all either so I know what you&#039;re talking about as far as doing drugs that most people would fold under and become addicted to.&nbsp; I feel like I need an MXE tune up because I haven&#039;t had any good powder since probably June.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking about getting some Ketamine and hoping that will put me back where I need to be.&nbsp; <br />Good luck!

				<br />thank you, tcobambientAgain. i haven&#039;t been depressed since i took ketamine on Jan 14th. haven&#039;t taken any ketamine since then. i just feel normal, but i haven&#039;t felt normal like this for at least 10 years. i am pretty sure it is from the ketamine, although i will have to wait until the depression comes back and take ketamine again before i will be sure.
