				There is little to no difference provided they are fresh ground.<br /><br />Psilocybin degrades in light, heat (above 180f (82c)), and in the presence of oxygen.&nbsp; Whole mushrooms will last years if packaged in an airtight container and placed in a dark freezer. Left out at room temp and in the presence of oxygen, they stay potent for up to a year.<br /><br />If the mushroom is ground, then the psilocybin breaks down faster. Ground should be used in 30 to 60 days or it will start loosing it&#039;s potency.<br /><br />Think of it like spices, spices are best if ground just before they are used. Pre-ground spice you get at the grocery store is not as strong.<br /><br />I am not suggesting that the pre-ground mushrooms are not as strong, only that they have a shorter shelf life.<br /><br />When I sold local, most wanted to see the whole mushroom to make sure they were getting the real thing and not something that was ground up with 10% dirt.<br /><br />Again, not suggesting that the vendors here provide anything other than 100% fresh ground product. Just things that I know from experience.<br />

				Once powdered, the potency clock is ticking! <br /><br />There are differences in the trip as well. Whole shrooms provide a more spread-out trip, while powdered produces shorter, more intense trips. Same amount of psilocybin, it just absorbs in your bloodstream MUCH faster when powdered, so it comes on more intense and dies off quicker.

				Provided that mushrooms are cracker dry and stored in an airtight container with desiccant, it will keep for several years if not longer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Sure fresh mushrooms are always the most potent but cracker dry ones arent too far behind. :)<br /><br />But like others said, if you powder them, consume it within a few weeks.

				Galindoi you must eat more than what you would have to cubes to have a good trip. <br /><br />The come up is about the same in terms of intensity but it soon mellows out and while it is still very &quot;trippy&quot; it&#039;s way easier to function and move around.&nbsp; I guess you can say there is less bodyload.<br /><br />On cubes I just straight up feel retarded and the bodyload is heavy.<br /><br />To see the real differences you just have to experience it yourself.&nbsp; IMO though, it&#039;s way more euphoric than cubes and it&#039;s just different in terms of the whole trip.

				For the cubenis does it make sense to just go with one of the cheaper vendors such as MushroomMafia or hashman?&nbsp; chroot and catfish916 appear to be charging a premium but do you basically get the same thing?<br /><br />I&#039;m a fan of visuals (+1 for cubenis it sounds like) but hate bodyload (-1 for cubenis is sounds like) but like you said just gotta try both.<br /><br />The effects are different but how much more Galindoi than cubenis is needed for a good trip?&nbsp; Are we talking like 25% more or 100% more or what?<br /><br />Thanks.

				Probably pointless to throw into this convo, but I hear that the reason why most people don&#039;t prefer their mushies ground unless they&#039;re making tea with it, is because when you chew on the mushies they can get stuck in between your teeth and cause them to ache and rot....<br />I always make tea with my mushies though, because I&#039;m an anxious wreck with come ups.

				The main difference as far as I am concerned is that when you buy whole shrooms you can see what you get. You are pretty sure that you are getting is in fact shrooms in the amount you paid.<br /><br />If you buy powder you wil have to take the vendors word that &quot;filler&quot; has not been added.<br /><br />I always prefer to buy shrooms. I have no problem eating them whole (chewing well of course) but should I want them ground then it is anyway just a one minute job with a coffee grinder or morrter and I still would much prefer to do it myself than getting them pre-ground.

				I went ahead and ordered 1oz of the galindoi powder from USAShroomz today since it is so cheap.&nbsp; Maybe galindoi powder isn&#039;t such a bad option for my first time on shrooms since it is said to be less intense than the cubenis.

				It is a little more complex than that. There are several active compounds that effect serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels. Every species has a slightly different mix of them and cause a slightly different trip but the biggest factor is the lower levels of psilocybin and psilocin. Psilocin bonds to the 5HT receptors and works as an artificial serotonin causing the bulk of the trip.&nbsp; The Psilocybin is converted to psilocin in the body. The more psilocin the faster the come on and the more vivid the trip from my experience.<br />

				My first shroom trip started out fine but I spent way too much time on the toilet and eventually I got nauseated.&nbsp; The trip duration was much shorter lived than how long the sides lasted.&nbsp; I prefer the effects from chemicals like LSD and 2C-B but then again I took P galindoi rather than P cubensis.&nbsp; I did make it into tea.&nbsp; Used about 5.5g.&nbsp; Trip effects were fine but very short lasting.

				Mushrooms are an amazing drug! <br />Mescaline is meant to be the BEST psychedelic out there which can potentially make it the best natural drug.<br /><br />Take 10 grams in a fruit smoothie of mushrooms, you will see God.

				you can always go for a chocolate bar. definitely the tastiest method of consumption! the mushrooms are powdered so they are absorbed faster and the maois in the chocolate should potentiate it a bit. :)
