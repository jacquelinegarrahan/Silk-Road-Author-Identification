				In the summer I will be going to plenty of festivals &amp; raves.

Not so sure about this as the amphetamine/speedy feeling you get when you take too much MDMA isn&#039;t what I&#039;m looking for. <br /><br />Alcohol &amp; caffiene to keep me awake?

When I&#039;m on the Mand I will do 100mg of K and it just makes life interesting. If you do 200mg+ it&#039;s K-hole time which is a whole different ball game.

				Necrotic neurotoxicity is fundamentally the result of a neuron&#039;s inability to restore its resting state after frequent depolarization (same is true to a lesser extent for glia). Increasing the energy supply by correcting malnutrition and attenuating the effects of acute and chronic toxins will nonspecifically increase the capacity of your brain to adapt to stressful events (i.e. stimulation by exogenous drugs). <br />On the other hand, MDMA is probably not neurotoxic in recreational doses, especially if your brain is well-nourished. Taking it every couple of weeks should not be a problem unless you take excessive amounts. Methylone is similar to MDMA but less serotonin-displacing (about equally dopamine- &amp; noradrenalin- displacing) and less empathogenic. <br />I sell nutritional supplements that optimize brain metabolism and resistance to toxins, they may benefit you (link below). I&#039;d also recommend that whatever you take you eat at least 10g vitamin C a day; if you go to a festival get a bottle of 1gram pills and eat them throughout the day. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/13b74fbf75

				Meph + Bing is extremely intense. It&#039;s the most intense stimulant rush I&#039;ve ever experienced and if you get good Bing that is tacky and high purity it hits you quite literally instantly. You feel a rush going from head to toe and then back up again and then you have an intense charge that lasts for about 20 minutes and then levels out after. Very intense feeling, a personal favourite. :)<br /><br />Gangster mix. ;)
