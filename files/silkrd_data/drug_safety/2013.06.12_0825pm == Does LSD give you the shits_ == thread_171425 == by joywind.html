				I can&#039;t remember where, but I&#039;ve read that LSD is a strong agonist of receptors that are abundant in both your brain AND your gut area. Compared to what your senses get bombarded with when on LSD, LSD-induced gaseous has to be one of the most benign and less freaky of the symptoms :P

				Perhaps its just coincidence - you might have eaten some (accidentally?) that didn&#039;t go down that well. <br /><br />Opiates will result in constipation, but most other common drugs like lsd, thc and such will not have that big an effect on bowel movements at all. This does not make it impossible that you really need to take a dump while taking lsd as it doesn&#039;t inhibit it much either.

				I do have the desire to do number 2 often when on LSD. But only when it starts, first hour or so. Usually it is just a &#039;false alarm&#039;, there is an urge, but nothing much really to do in the bathroom.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard the same about 2-cb.

				In the half-dozen or so times that I&#039;ve done LSD, &quot;the shits&quot; has never been a side-effect. Thankfully, as bathrooms aren&#039;t usually handy outdoors or at festivals. Not to mention going to the bathroom and looking at yourself in the mirror while really high on psychedelics kinda sucks.<br /><br />I have a funny story that we all like to bring up IRL whenever there is a mention of LSD however. A friend used to get constipated frequently and would dose (very large amounts of acid) regularly just to be able to take a shit. That was her rationale anyways. She&#039;s kinda special though, so we&#039;d just get a laugh from it. I hadn&#039;t really given it much thought, but now that you ask, I suppose LSD can give people the shits.

				I&#039;ve eaten blotters before that have made me gassy, and felt as if gas was building up inside but just wouldn&#039;t come out, and also I&#039;ve gotten weird stomach tension a few times. Sometimes I&#039;ve eaten blotters that have made me feel &quot;Full&quot; or bloated but not in a hunger way, but more of a &quot;oh shit I&#039;ma explode if I eat too much of these blotters&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />These were before our SR days when we just got random blotters off the streets and just went with the trip.

				This has happened to me as well. Used to be the first sign I was tripping. Nothing like watching the walls crawl while taking a big, wet dump. I get the shits if I have food in my stomach when I drop acid, but I can usually eat just fine once I&#039;m an hour in. I always fast for around 8 hours and it seems to have alleviated most of the stomach issues.
