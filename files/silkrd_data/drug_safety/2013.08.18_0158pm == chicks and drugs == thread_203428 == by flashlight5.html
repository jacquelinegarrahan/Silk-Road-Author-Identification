				99% of women are not inelligent enough to understand concepts like &quot;jailtime&quot; or &quot;drugs being illegal&quot;.<br /><br />Try to separate drugs and females and have your interactions with drugs and females be at parties.<br /><br />Or teach her to use PGP or some shit, chances are she&#039;ll give up and accept the jailtime because that&#039;s the way a majority of women&#039;s minds work.

				Ah, yeah, I wasn&#039;t quite sure which way you were going with it, but yeah I get it now. They just don&#039;t have the capabilities to think logically like men are built to do(well, most of us anyway). They get too caught up in their emotions when making decisions...which can work to their favor in certain situations but yeah. <br /><br />I thought you meant that bitch was fiending for them and you just wanted her to want the D, not the drugs haha.

				Never have sex with a woman on LSD, because she WILL fall in love with you. I made this mistake twice. Both were sluts I met at a bar. Both fell madly in love with me as a result of a shared LSD session.

Never! I was just curious as to why...if there was a specific reason. I&#039;ve never had Lucy myself, but I am planning on it and a girl I&#039;m seeing wants to partake too She&#039;s heard of my fun times on MDMA/2C-B and she&#039;s curious to start exploring the side of psychedelics...just kinda wanted to know what I was getting myself into...even though I&#039;m pretty sure she&#039;s already pretty into me.<br /><br />Either way, +1 for the laugh!

				@mucho<br /><br />-when still in &quot;dating&quot; phase, try it with sb you trust first. dont do a new substance with her. is you get a bad trip, you want sb there you can trust.<br />-make sure she ain&#039;t doing something stupid (dose,setting,etc)<br />-make it clear what your rules are for supplying controlled substances to her. dont be a dick about it, but eg talking on the phone should be off limits. also she should not talk with her friends about it. <br /><br />thing is, in most countries, if the chick never actually is in possession is the substance and just takes them, she aint doing anything illegal.

I prefer to find my females externally and bring them into the &quot;scene&quot; with me. Preferably with a college degree and SOME sort of life prospects haha. They generally seem more appreciative and understand the consequences of using/being careless. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=203428.msg1473324#msg1473324">Quote from: flashlight5 on August 20, 2013, 08:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">@mucho<br /><br />-when still in &quot;dating&quot; phase, try it with sb you trust first. dont do a new substance with her. is you get a bad trip, you want sb there you can trust.<br />-make sure she ain&#039;t doing something stupid (dose,setting,etc)<br />-make it clear what your rules are for supplying controlled substances to her. dont be a dick about it, but eg talking on the phone should be off limits. also she should not talk with her friends about it. <br /><br />thing is, in most countries, if the chick never actually is in possession is the substance and just takes them, she aint doing anything illegal. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Most people think of me as a wild child, but they also don&#039;t know I spend HOURS on SRF, bluelight, etc etc before I try anything new....reading stories and technical information. It just looks careless to them because all of a sudden I&#039;m talking about a new substance no ones heard me mention before. It&#039;s all a calculated risk on my side of things...and I def try to look out for my friends, especially when they are trying something new. I always tell them to err on the side of caution so they don&#039;t ruin their experience...you can always take more, but you can&#039;t take less(however, I do have xanax on hand should the need arise).<br /><br />I&#039;ve know the girl for almost a decade pretty closely, we smoke a lot of weed together and just recently started dating. I&#039;d pretty much trust her with my life already. She&#039;s not the one to run out and brag to her friends what she&#039;s all done...she&#039;s turned it down before but she knows I get high quality stuff compared to the grab bag on the street. She knows the risks of getting caught and especially my risks so she wouldn&#039;t do anything to harm either of us. I did learn this one the hard way once, or almost the hard way. Was messing around with a married woman and she knew I smoked weed. Her husband found out about me and was none too pleased(he was abusive, still doesn&#039;t make it right for me though haha). Faked complaints about me harassing her at work and what not...I was just waiting for the Police to show up looking for my weed. <br /><br />I generally test substances by myself or with my best friend because I know he won&#039;t hold anything against me. He had a &quot;bad&quot; experience on 2C-B(had some chest tightness unrelated to the trip but he was tripping so hard it made it worse) and woke up the next morning and wouldn&#039;t stop talking about how awesome it was ha. <br /><br />+1 to both of ya tho.
