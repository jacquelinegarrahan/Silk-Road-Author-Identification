				I&#039;ve been vaping DMT for a while.&nbsp; I&#039;m starting to understand the different aspects of it, but I need advice from people who have more experience with it than I do.<br /><br />On one hand, I seem to be able to &#039;tune in&#039; to something a kind of &#039;place&#039;, the way I would access a chat room on the internet, or a livestream room.&nbsp; There&#039;s like a grid that comes at me, expands into these pathways, and I&#039;m able to reach a destination.&nbsp; It&#039;s an extraordinary structure.&nbsp; It&#039;s beautiful.&nbsp; This happens when I close my eyes and concentrate on it.&nbsp; I can sort of focus on this journey, and I &#039;get&#039; somewhere.&nbsp; It is like I&#039;m developing this ability.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is all in my mind.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember the trips often, but I have these memories of being trapped in &#039;underground&#039; environments.&nbsp; These are like memories of dreams.&nbsp; Sometimes they go monochrome during my trips.<br /><br />My question is-- if this stuff is my own brain, can I use this to create dreams?&nbsp; Can I develop control over the mechanism and create dream-like experiences?&nbsp; Can I create environments that I can then experience at night when I dream?

				From my experience I can say you can&#039;t control a DMT trip.&nbsp; The molecule has a tendancy to take you where you need to go regardless of what you want.<br /><br />I will say that I have extremely vivid dreams after using DMT.&nbsp; Sometimes it borders on lucid dreaming, and there is a strange connected feeling that goes along with it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t try to control DMT.&nbsp; Relax into it, and trust that you will go where you need to go.&nbsp; It sounds like you&#039;ve broken through, but you could try carefully upping the dose a bit to see if that gets you to the place you want to be.&nbsp; Do it carefully, and respectfully.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t just mess around with DMT in my opinion.&nbsp; It is just a bit too profound, and primal.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to approach it like you would an acid trip as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />Obviously what you experience will be different.&nbsp; I love to think back on trips right after while the aftertrails are still running through my vision.&nbsp; Have fun with it.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t consider myself experienced, but I have certainly explored DMT to an extent.

It isn&#039;t? There is any difference at all between the two to begin with?<br />The only thing that matters for what it concerns &quot;it is only in my brain or not?&quot; is if the thing you do works for you or not (meaning you can have a practical result out of the experience), the rest doesn&#039;t really matter. I don&#039;t think any human will ever understand the truth one way or another.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161021.msg1142599#msg1142599">Quote from: ominuby2 on May 19, 2013, 01:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> can I use this to create dreams? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, you can, but not within the dream itself&nbsp; but outside of it (I will explain this better in the next couple of answers). <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161021.msg1142599#msg1142599">Quote from: ominuby2 on May 19, 2013, 01:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Can I develop control over the mechanism and create dream-like experiences? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Developing control into DMT is one of the most difficult things to do because like in OBE experiences your unconscious take the lead. If you try to grasp for control you will much probably fail because the unconscious bends only to love. Instead of trying for control while you are in the experience it is for this much better to create a direction BEFORE it and then create control in an indirect way. The indirect way to create control is directing your awake consciousness in a certain way so that when you are in the dream state you will react in that same way.<br /><br />Magic/occultism/shamanism/sorcery are not only tied to the moment of the experience, they are paths that go on also on the &quot;normal&quot; state of awareness just for this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161021.msg1142599#msg1142599">Quote from: ominuby2 on May 19, 2013, 01:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Can I create environments that I can then experience at night when I dream?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can, by setting the &quot;intent&quot; before (the longer the time and the stronger the intent, the stronger the experience will be tied to that intent; depending on what you have to do there are people that go on for days thinking only on what they want to achieve before starting - btw who you are or what do you think you are already has a factor just for this and why all the talk about set and setting in psychedelic circles, albeit in that ambit they just scrape the surface of the thing). <br /><br />For example you can execute a ritual before the experience so that your intent will be set and you will go where you want to. One example of this is using an Enochian call before the experience (search on google about the term and you will see what it means). Or you can use a tarot card or similar to implant the unconscious BEFORE you go. In shamanism you do this with special chants etc.

				If you are a material reductionist than it&#039;s all in your own brain. I am a heretical scientist on the other hand and believe in spirit and other realms. My hypothesis is that it allows access to the astral realm. This wont get you enlightened, and can be pleasant or unpleasant. But that realm is merely strange and entertaining but not by itself beneficial to your spiritual evolution.
