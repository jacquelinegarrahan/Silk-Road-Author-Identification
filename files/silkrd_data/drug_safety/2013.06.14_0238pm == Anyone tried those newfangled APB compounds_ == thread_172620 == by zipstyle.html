				Any thoughts?<br />5-APB? 6-APB? 5-EAPB? What&#039;s hopping? What are they like?<br /><br />I&#039;m !*!*!NOT!*!*! looking for an MDMA replacement, just interested in knowing if these drugs are worth trying. Thanks :D

				Damn kids with your newfangled drugs, get off my lawn!<br /><br />A friend of mine tried 6-APB and enjoyed it, but again said it wasn&#039;t good enough to replace MDMA.<br /><br />I honestly wonder how much of that is truly MDMA being superior, and how much of it is simply the placebo effect of thinking everything else will be inferior.<br /><br />Be careful ingesting RCs!

				You should always be darned careful to try any RC substance.<br /><br />That said, these synthetic agonist can be extremely potent. It is not uncommon for a synthetic to have 100 fold the activation of the natural substance (think thc vs synthetic analogues). The most important issue is if the synthetic is better, e.g. more specific, compared to the natural substance. <br /><br />Once the potency has been established it boils down to that question. At the moment i don&#039;t know if any of the APB series offers any benefit over mdma, but they are called research chemicals for a good reason...

				I have had some experience with 6-APB and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Like MDA and MDMA you can&#039;t take it very often. It needs to be spread out between weeks in my opinion. There is an increased psychedelic edge to it compared to MDMA and to me reminds me of a shorter acting MDA in that its not as touchy feely and is more speedy but not overwhelmingly so like meth. Its definitely fun and worth it. The comedown didn&#039;t seem bad. If you like MDA and MDMA you&#039;ll like 6-APB.

				Thanks for all the responses guys, but I would like to know what people think about the APB compounds NOT comparing them to MDMA or MDA. I mean, if you never took MDMA or MDA or Methylone or Mephedrone, how would you describe 6-APB, for example? I just wanna know if this a drug I should look into trying once or twice or keep around for my collection. :)<br /><br />

				Methylone is pretty good. I tried 6-APB pellets once that I ordered from the UK. Ended up with schizophrenic-like symptoms (a bad trip I guess) and ended up in the ER begging for xanax to stop the madness. IMHO, APB&#039;s are sketch.
