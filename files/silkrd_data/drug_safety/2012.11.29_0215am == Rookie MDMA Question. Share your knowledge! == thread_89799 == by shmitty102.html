				Hello all!<br /><br />So my friend and I want to roll for an event in a couple weeks, and I&#039;m trying to decide how much MDMA I should take and in what form. I&#039;m in between these two listings - the first is for Schizofreen&#039;s partyflock pill and the second is for a 0.25g tan MDMA sample from Powerade.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/42127e4734/10<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5cfcf189f6/30<br /><br />So here&#039;s my two questions:<br />My friend and I each weigh roughly 150 lbs. If we split either a partyflock pill (claims to be 202-220mg mdma) or 0.25g tan mdma, will that be enough to get a good roll?<br />Which would you go with - the pill or the crystal?

				thats how much they claim is in the pill or how strong the molly is<br /><br />buy a couple extra and take about 100 or so mg and see how you like it.<br />depending on the quality, i usually like to take three 100mg doses through out the night<br /><br />have fun at your show, <br />i just saw Cosmic Gate and had Cloud surfers MDMA and it was a beautiful show 8)

				When you&#039;re buying the big named dutch pills, don&#039;t worry about being poisoned or anything, especially when they&#039;re from a reputable vendor. <br /><br />The candyflocks are good pills, roughly 200mg of mdma - when I&#039;ve taken them I&#039;ve not noticed any other substance in them.<br /><br />The crystal, well... crystal is crystal 200mg is 200mg.<br /><br />200mg of MDMA in crystal or pill form is 200mg of MDMA, whatever way you look at it.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s personal preference.

				IMO don&#039;t take to big doses, for me it triggers the best if I take like 0,15g. Took 0,25 0,4 and 0,5 and I had a horrible hangover the next day. With 0.15 and almost no food over the day I made the best experiences.<br /><br />Take care!

				Don&#039;t take a stupid high dose. Just know your limits. take something like .3 of Molly or MDMA.&nbsp; As long as you keep your dosing right then you&#039;ll have a great time. Sometimes being floored is too much to be dancing at an event. but to each his own.
