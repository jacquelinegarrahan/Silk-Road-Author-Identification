				I have only ever been prescribed regular vicodin 5/500 for dental reasons.&nbsp; What else has everyone tried?&nbsp; I am not worried about getting a rush though it would be a plus...

IB800 is junk BUT better then nothing else. The best your DR is going to give you is Percocet 10/500.&nbsp; That is great and it is stronger then Loratab 10/500.<br /><br />Either will work...either will give you a buzz. But it all depends how bad the pain is and if you have a cavity where the hole is exposed/visable... if it is sensitive to water...as in if you have the pain..can you flush water in and out of your mouth and the pain will go away while you are doing that....but come right back when you stop? Or is it a constant pain? Or does it just come on when you drink or eat something. Is it affected by cold?

				After serious dental work (root canal, wisdom teeth extraction etc) ibuprofen is commonly prescribed in europe at fairly high dosages (1800 mg/day or so). Generally the pain is considered to be acceptable at this dose if nsaisd treatment, although not completely suppressed. Considering the pain does diminish over the course of a week or less, i suppose there is something to be said for this. It will hurt a fair bit, but only for a week or less, so there is no reason to risk opiate treatment etc.<br /><br />Practically patients my obtain substances like tramadol to alleviate the pain, which can be perfectly okay if used only as long as the problem lasts. The risk is people will keep taking it for a week or two, after which some dependence already sets in. <br />
