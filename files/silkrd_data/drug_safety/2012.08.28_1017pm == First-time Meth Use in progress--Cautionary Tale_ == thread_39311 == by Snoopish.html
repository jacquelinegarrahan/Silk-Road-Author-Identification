				So I got some of DE&#039;s meth the other day and was intending to see if it worked as a study aid: so my dosage is 5mg.<br /><br />So I took out my scale and dosed it out, crushed it, and snorted a long line. It seemed like a lot and I actually had to stop because it burned so bad. I finished the line after a short break and that was about ten minutes ago.<br /><br />Ready for the Shyamalan twist? I forgot that I have a shitty scale and that&#039;s why I bought a new one. The line I snorted is closer to 50mg(although who really knows--my new scale isn&#039;t in).<br /><br />So I haven&#039;t exploded yet but I&#039;m definitely feeling &quot;up&quot; and active.<br /><br />Sooo....chastisement, encouragement, advice. Put it all here. I&#039;m going to try and document my feelings as time goes on. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />EDIT: Another ten minutes and it seems that my scale must have been significantly off. I don&#039;t feel too different. Not very rushed. Definitely energized. Nose still burns a bit but altogether doing okay.

				i&#039;m interested in this since i use low-dose desoxyn, which i find subtle but essential. can&#039;t say it&#039;s particularly good for studying at the doses i take. but i was thinking about getting crystal as a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />but why are you snorting this? from what i understand, this roa has a high addiction potential. why not ingest it? it will probably go much smoother.<br />

				have fun, but take it easy.&nbsp; don&#039;t be too heavy handed with the meth...shit is potent as fuck.&nbsp; <br /><br />stay honest with yourself; no lying.&nbsp; if you start using it twice per month you&#039;re in a very vulnerable place.&nbsp; don&#039;t underestimate this shit, dude, it can suck anyone into its world.<br /><br />make the most of your time with it...party, dance, study, write, fuck, kick some ass, etc.&nbsp; but if you&#039;re still using it 4 months from now you&#039;re in dangerous territory.&nbsp; <br /><br />be safe homie.

				Thanks for the replies. So far I&#039;ve worked out and ran about 1.9Km. I&#039;m going to go shop and then see about studying some. Also cleaned my kitchen and paced some. I don&#039;t think any adverse effects are kicking in. I feel more sociable and have more initiative so we&#039;ll see how that translates to studying. Personally, I probably did too much for studying (especially my first time) but we&#039;ll see. <br /><br />And I snorted it because...well honestly I wanted the quick and easy onset. I&#039;ll try oral and smoking at some point and see what&#039;s the best for studying. I imagine my dose was closer to 30mg as I definitely didn&#039;t rush. I&#039;ll be using lower doses of 5-10 for studying over this week and let you guys know how it goes. I only have a gram and if I burn through this I will try to be honest with my usage and cut back.<br /><br />Honestly I don&#039;t see myself as having an addictive personality so I probably don&#039;t have enough respect for this drug.<br /><br />Stay tuned. I hope to bring good news!<br /><br />(BTW: @Whatcouldpossiblygowrong: If that isn&#039;t the most appropriate name for somebody replying to this topic I don&#039;t know what is =) )

BUT: one day i read about the positive aspects of nicotine. fuckin&#039; wikipedia said that nicotine on its own is not significantly addictive (without the added shit in cigarettes). so four months ago i found myself with my first pack of nicotine gum.<br /><br />i like to tell myself that i don&#039;t know if i&#039;m addicted to nicotine since i haven&#039;t tried to go a day without it&nbsp; :P<br />

But yeah, I heard nicotine has some beneficial effects(can&#039;t remember off the top of my head). <br /><br />Update: still feeling pretty chipper. I think it may have tapered slightly because I felt...I guess a craving to snort some more. It was like a strong urge in my head and chest for a brief second--like I panicked at the thought that I might lose my energy. It&#039;s still there a bit, but quieter now. It may be all in my head or just my general tendency towards anxiety. <br /><br />Anyhow. Went shopping and was engaging and friendly to people. A couple people talked to me while I babbled on. It was interesting in that I&#039;ve never had that happen before. Maybe I came off as more approachable today or maybe freak accident.<br /><br />Going to try and do some reading and see how productive I end up being and for how long.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Definitely tapering off now. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m craving another round as much as I was earlier. I read a hefty amount of text without becoming distracted too greatly. I think the primary effects have faded now though so I&#039;m not particularly geared up to try forcing more literature or work down my throat. There is some (very) small debris left from my earlier crushing that I may try to snort to keep reading (I will not actually go to my stash and get anymore though).<br /><br />I may try a large(50mg) dosage again once I have my new scale for the sake of providing an accurate report of potential productivity at that level. I intend to not use anymore until my new scale comes though and even then to work on smaller dosages for a bit. <br /><br />Cheers!

				It&#039;s addicting as shit. I&#039;ve only bought it twice and when I have it I can&#039;t stop using it and when I don&#039;t, I crave it. Seriously stay away. There is no &#039;responsible use&#039; of meth. I thought I would do that too but ended up just smoking it all day long and snorting it when I came down then smoking more until I was out then spending 10 minutes tapping and scraping the bag for a small line to go back up again or smoking the residue on my pipe for an hour to just get one more high. I don&#039;t really have any self respect so I don&#039;t see it as bad, but I can see how you would be disgusted with yourself doing something like this.

I think I&#039;m starting to see how it can be a drug that takes a hold of you, even after just one run. I&#039;m really hoping I can end up with a positive story though--it&#039;s all these rough experiences other people have had that make me want to believe in a possible &quot;good&quot; way to utilize it. If I could find that then I&#039;d be able to advise other people who want to use it in a controlled manner.<br /><br />But I&#039;m often fooled with a rose-colored way of viewing the world. I may try speed soon and see how it compares. I don&#039;t hear as many horror stories with it. <br /><br />Cheers friend

				When I first started using it I was snorting and had no trouble whatsoever having a bag in my drawer for weeks at a time without touching it. When you start smoking is when you realize how addictive it can really be. When you snort, the effects are nice but I find any physical side-effects are quite prominent (bpm increase, sweating etc.) and this, combined with the long slow comedown seems to put me off a bit. Also, snorting makes me horny but unable to perform. Torture!<br />Smoking is a different beast altogether - no side-effects whatsoever, just pure clean euphoria and stimulation. This fact means to me that I want to be on it every second of the day. Then by day 4 I&#039;m feeling kinda funny....<br /><br />However all this experimentation was done while unemployed and EXTREMELY bored, lonely and devastatingly homesick. Now I&#039;m back in action and have had a month with no real drugs to speak of - cravings for stims have gone. So I have ordered a small bag and will see if I can keep it under control when I have much more responsibility. If not, I&#039;m leaving the stuff for special occasions only. I will attempt 100mg once a week or something. Not sure what to expect.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that there is a &#039;honeymoon&#039; phase with smoked crystal where you can&#039;t believe how utterly fantastic you feel. Once this period is over, as with any drug, you are far more in control.

It should be here either today or tomorrow (which would be perfect because I have so much work to get done this weekend) so I&#039;ll hopefully have a chance to update this (or start a new thread) detailing my experiences with low dosages. Aside from insufflating a miniscule amount that I had left on my coffee table (mostly because I was tired of the residue sitting there) I&#039;ve not had any more. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t even known meth worked sublingually honestly. Will it just dissolve under the tongue? I still haven&#039;t tried a straightforward oral admin yet so I got a long way to go. If sublingual works I&#039;ll probably try that for my next &quot;practical&quot; application.<br /><br />Cheers!
