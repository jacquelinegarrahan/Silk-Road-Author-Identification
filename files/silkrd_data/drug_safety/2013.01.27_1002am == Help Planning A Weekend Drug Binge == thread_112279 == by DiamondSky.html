				Hi there!<br /><br />So me and the girlfriend are planning a weekend drug binge to help celebrate a wedding of sorts. We&#039;re not really the marrying types so we&#039;re getting tattoos, rings, saying nice things to each other and then renting a nice hotel room to have a Drugiemoon in for the weekend. We&#039;ve mostly been doing MDMA and 2CB to party together but were looking to mix it up a little for the special occasion. So far, the list of items on my check list for possible drug use is:<br /><br />MDMA (of course)<br />2CB (ditto)<br />MDA<br />5-MeO-DIPT (Foxy)<br />Meth<br />LSD<br />GHB<br />Xanax (to calm things down)<br /><br />Now, the issue is I sort of like this girl and don&#039;t want to kill her, plus I&#039;m pretty sure she&#039;d miss me if I fell over and died too, so as lame as this sounds I want to find the most synergistic way to have at least one good party night and a bearable next day. My somewhat conservative thought was that we could start with a LOW dose of Foxy 5-8mg to start things off, wait for the tail end of that and then move onto some MDMA, wait for that to tail off and then bump with some MDA to change things up a bit and then finish with either some Xanax or GHB depending on where we were at. <br /><br />The MDMA to MDA is a pretty well traveled road for us so I feel safe there, just never mixed it with Foxy at the start or GHB at the end. Mostly our drug nights are most enjoyable when we melt into a puddle and touch each other for hours talking about how awesome everything is. 2CB has been fun for the visuals at the end of a trip but she doesn&#039;t have as much fun with that on it&#039;s own. I&#039;ve been toying with the idea of getting some acid or meth to really mix things up some but my biggest issue, at least for this trip, is I want it to be shared without us getting into separate head places if at all possible. Meth seems like it would be a blast for the fun sex time I just don&#039;t know how it would fit in with the rest of the drugs and feel like being spun out for the weekend might be a waste if that&#039;s all we did.<br /><br />I figure a few of you out there might have executed a love drug binge in the past so just thought I would see what&#039;s worked well for you. I have a couple of weeks to secure the supplies so open to most any advice that will get us a nice 10-14 hours of fun time together.

				1. 5 MeO MiPT Moxy is smoother than Foxy by a country mile.<br /><br />2. LSD may be cross tolerant with Foxy or Moxy for up to a week after, we have had issues, others may differ. <br /><br />3. Go read the big threads in this corner of the forum about Meth GHB and Moxy, most of the advice you want re combos of all the other stuff you mention is there in spadefuls.<br /><br />Have a great non-wedding, and I&#039;m trying to say this nicely, but if the info you seek has been discussed recently and is easy to find here, you&#039;re not going to win many friends on SR asking them to do your homework for you.&nbsp; :)

				Hi there, yeah I&#039;ve been pouring through the forums here as well as Erowid and Bluelight. The issue really isn&#039;t so much finding the info on the specific drugs but more so looking for the best combination in a one night / weekend binge.<br /><br />I thought I would start with Foxy vs. Moxy just because it seems like there is a little more known about it. I keep hearing Moxy is smoother but almost all the bad trips on Foxy seem to be in the 15-40mg range while most folks have a pretty good time in the 5-8mg range. Had no idea about the cross tolerance between LSD though so +1 for you!<br /><br />The biggest reason for this question was around the fact that we tend to do drugs together for the loved up feeling while most everyone else is hunting down a psych / spun state of mind with them but I&#039;ve got to imagine there are a few folks out there with similar goals / experiences. There are times we are both looking for that two, I just don&#039;t think a Drugiemoon is a good time for us to spend the night throwing up, talking to trees or confronting ego death as we sit alone in a corner.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll pour over some more info on Moxy though and see if that might be a better fit to the Foxy at the start though now. I loath the fact that Fox seems to turn about 50% of the people into puking machines while giving the other 50% a nice body high that can easily turn into a sexual funland.<br /><br />Anyway, if anyone stumbles across this and has any other suggestions for a good love combo feel free to toss it out there. I&#039;m going to try to order in the next day or two and will probably go with Fox / Mox - MDMA - MDA - GHB unless anyone has any other tips / suggestions.<br /><br />Appreciate the help!

				well if i were you i would drop the meth. your gonna end up with a horrible comedown.<br />also i think you should research the interaction between ghb and xanax. that combo sounds like depressed breathing and unconsciousness.... <br />and don&#039;t take these 2&nbsp; if you drink alcohol...

				T+0:00: LSD<br />T+2:00: MDMA<br />T+6:00: 2C-B<br />T+10:00: GHB<br /><br />Let the GHB bring you getting a good night&#039;s rest after some amazing sexy times. Wake up, relax for a few hours the next day and feed yourself with a huge nutritious meal. Follow it up with:<br /><br />T+0:00: 5-MeO-IPT (take about&nbsp; 10-15mg as the effects will be diminished due to cross-tolerance with the LSD)<br />T+3:00: MDA<br />T+10:00: Xanax<br /><br />Pass out and slip into recovery mode. The key in my opinion is to let the first day be absolutely divine and allow the following day to be one more focused around reflection. I would definitely steer clear of meth as it will not offer you with the most pleasant of comedowns. In my experience, LSD is absolutely pivotal in any combination, and you shouldn&#039;t worry about your headspaces being different due to MDMA&#039;s euphoria. Candyflipping with other individuals offers for a beautiful connection between all participants. As you&#039;ve researched, steer clear from combining GHB and Xanax in one night. Cheers and have fun! :)

				It&#039;s wonderful to take 2C-B on the comedown of MDMA.&nbsp; I&#039;d say drop LSD and MDMA Followed by 2C-B in 2-3 hours.&nbsp; The visuals on LSD+2C-B are incredible!&nbsp; Ketamine in small amounts during the experience is fun. I&#039;ve noticed when I combine 2C-B with MDMA I don&#039;t feel the desire to redose on MDMA as much.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some MDA with the 2C-B when you dose that would be a fun addition.&nbsp; You should check out my vendor page(though I don&#039;t have any MDA) as I have most of what you&#039;d want for your experience. ;)

				Taking meth after MDMx has depleted your serotonin will likely result in some serious damage to your serotonin system as a result of the ensuing dopamine flood. <br />I also suggest not doing meth, although I have never tried it myself.<br /><br />LSD will probably increase psychedelic tolerance more so than foxy or 2cb as a result of it&#039;s duration.&nbsp; May be good to try out foxy first. <br /><br />2cb and MDMA go pretty well together. Could be too stimulating to combine 2cb with MDA.<br /><br />Although likely to be pleasant together I feel that LSD and MDMA can negate some important cognitive/ego-dissolving and emotional effects of each other.

				Thanks for all the suggestions!<br /><br />I think I&#039;m probably going to look for something along the lines of:<br /><br />T - 0:00 - 5-8mg Foxy to start with<br />T - 2:30 - 2g Shrooms<br />T - 3:30 - 120mg MDA<br />T - 5:00 - 75mg MDA<br />T - 6:30 - 15mg 2CB<br />T - 8:00 - 2g GHB with smaller chasers as needed till asleep<br /><br />The doses are pretty low but I&#039;m hoping they keep us grounded enough to enjoy some togetherness. We both seem to enjoy the visuals side of a good trip as long as they aren&#039;t too distracting. I think with the shrooms / MDA / 2CB we should get into the visuals decently over a few hours without being taken over by them. I really wish there was a way to mix some meth in here for some crazy sex time but in thinking about what you all have said and the other reading I&#039;ve done I think the meth adventure should probably stand on it&#039;s own. <br /><br />Appreciate all the help, still 11 more days before the big night but I&#039;ll probably report back here once we are done so folks know how whatever the eventual combo we come up with works out.<br />

				Be careful with the Moxy. Its an amazing drug, just dont have too much. More than 10mg will have you flying really hard. 50mg of mdma 2 hours in is pretty amazing, close your eyes when the molly kicks in and see the battle of dark vs light, was unbelievable what i saw.<br /><br />Have fun and all the best. ;) ;)

				Firstly congratulations! :)<br /><br />Looking at your (evolving) protocol I think you&#039;re going to have a splendid time ;)<br /><br />I definitely support AnimusVox&#039;s comments and protocol - one of my personal favourites too.<br /><br />And yes Moxy is smoother than Foxy - less cardiovascular push, more refined.<br /><br />Personally I would use acid instead of the shrooms in this particular combo - otherwise I think it&#039;s very cool!<br /><br />May you have Great Golden Copulations!! (in the words of the illustrious Jim Morrison...)<br /><br />Blessing to you and your lady,<br /><br />BG<br />

				So I normally like to try things out before I put them into my girl just because if one of us were to fall over dead from some odd drug combination I would prefer it be me and not her. Yesterday I got a mountain of drugs dropped off on my porch and the two I was most worried about were the Moxy and the Xanax powder so I went about doing some experiments.<br /><br />My super duper nice scale from Amazon upon which I was putting most of my faith decided to be accurate to about 800mg despite it&#039;s claim of .001g and numerous attempts at recalibration. Fortunately, I have a 1-3mg scoop which will being much less scientific did help me eyeball some smaller doses before committing to using volumetric dosing for the real weekend adventure. So I started with the Moxy, plugging about 4-5mg to start since I figured plugging would get me past base line fastest with this substance.<br /><br />It hit pretty quick, 30 minutes or so and I could feel I was off baseline. Much more stimulating than I had imagined. Felt a little bit of that stimmed up heart in chest feeling but nothing uncomfortable, no shakes or anything. Having put the GF to sleep shortly after taking it I wasn&#039;t over the top with &quot;Let&#039;s fuck Baby&quot; or anything like that. I did toss in a little porn when she was out and it got me off pretty fast, the body rush helping the feelings come to life a bit faster.<br /><br />Never content with threshold, at 1.5 hours I plugged a bit more again 3-5 mg and this time the physical push continued pretty good and again my porn experience went quickly I noticed a little color enhancement but not extreme.&nbsp; It should be noted that since the first dose I needed to keep my little portable heater up pretty high as I was having a harder time keeping warm than I normally do. Pretty sure I thought watching a little more porn on this run would be scientific and it produced a similar result as earlier.<br /><br />Now, wanting to make absolutely sure I had a grip on Moxy and what it was all about at least under these testing conditions, about 1.5 hours past previous bump I plugged one more 4-5mg dose and at this point I think things moved just a smidge past threshold into more of a trippy set. Got a quick return to that anxious - too much coffee - type feeling, body felt nice. Porn was consumed Colors were intensified, no OEV&#039;s but watching a movie provided several moments where I knew what I was seeing was not nearly the same as what was there, brighter, more halo like apparitions with pretty decent color distortion. There were occasional side of field of view movements that left when I changed focus. One more porn experiment to test randiness, and was hard as a rock cumming very quickly.<br /><br />Of note, I don&#039;t normally jerk off 4 times in 5 hours so the real or imagined effect on libido seems to be there and cumming at those doses was no problem, quick even.<br /><br />Moving onto the Xanax, I thought I would test that to take tre edge off a little, I tend to have trouble sleeping after any new drug so thought I should give it a go.<br /><br />1.5 mg Alprazolam&nbsp; powder oral and didn&#039;t seem to hit me too much. Maybe a little calmer but hard to tell as I am new to this drug.<br /><br />Waited an hour and tried 1.5 mg more Alprazolam and this time I felt a little smoother but again not tired or out of it in anyway. Took my normal sleeping dose of Melatonin and Tylenol PM and realized I was a little mind fucked as I could not be sure moments after taking it if I really had taken it or not. <br /><br />Decided about 1 hour after last Alprazolam&nbsp; dose that a tine touch up might be in order so did one last booster of that at about 1mg.<br /><br />Woke up 12 hours later with all my clothes on in bed having no recollection of falling asleep or ever having become sleepy;<br /><br />So what I learned is Moxy is pretty good stuff, will probably go for a single dose of about 8mg next time to get where I want to be. Plugging provided NONE of the intestinal issues I was worried about based on previous reports so that was a plus. It seems to make things pretty awesome and when you get the dose right sex seems to come easily. There is definitely some body load associated with it in the form of tight chest and an occasional need to remind yourself to take a good deep breath but it seemed manageable. It&#039;s easy to want to push yourself higher but rumors of this turning full psychedelic at higher doses was counter to my goals of finding out if this was a sutible erotic enhancer. And at least the bag I go at lower doses does not seem likely to kill me or my GF when we play with it.<br /><br />I see this as something that would be fun for the start of our little trip since it&#039;s a function drug. Things can be done, head is still clear, everything just seems a little different.<br /><br />For the Alprazolam, I think a little more care / research is going to be needed. I wanted to have it handy in case things went bad but the dosing is going to be a pain and the effect are pretty damn subtle at least with mixed with the stim side of Moxy. At this point I will probably leave it off the rotation and give the GHB a try to see how that goes in it&#039;s place. <br /><br />I got a shot load of drugs in the mail the other day and I am thinking we might try the schedule mentioned earlier with a switch from the shrooms to a smaller dose (100ug or so) of LSD followed by ther MDMA chaser and then if we can handle it a touch of MDA to end the visual side of the trip before moving onto the 2CB.<br /><br />I ended up grabbing some local GHB for this encounter but I hope it goes down well and next time around I&#039;ll pickup some of BG&#039;s stuff. I ended up in more of a time crunch when it came to ordering as I was waiting for BTC to stabilize before I ordered but it just stayed high and I only had a week left so had to go domestic. I just got 15g for this adventure though and if it&#039;s handy for helping with some good long love / makepout sessions between me and my girl I can see wanting to have some larger supply on hand for weekend make out sessions.<br /><br />Appreciate all the advice and help coming from everyone here. Sorry if there&#039;s a little TMI in the post above but I like to be as honest and complete&nbsp; as I can since we are the only real source for information on how this stuff effects different people.

				LSD!!!!<br /><br />Great drug to drop with your girlfriend! You just might fall in love!<br /><br />LSD is enough for me but is also great when combined with MDMA! I have only ever done this combination when I went to shows though and I don&#039;t have experience to recommend it as a good combo for you and your girl in a hotel room.&nbsp; Bring some along but you&#039;ll probably be happy with a 150-250ug dose of white fluff LSD.<br /><br />Have fun and stay safe&nbsp; :)

				I personally wouldnt go with any &#039;ups&#039; either. Aside from the essentials ,which for me would be LSD, marijuana, K and a few roxy30s..in your case lets say LSD,pot,MDMA and 2c-b..aside from that, If i where you Id stick more along the lines of the cuddle drugs, and things more on the down side..LSD is always more than enough stimulant for me, but then again, me sober is very high strung, so i like downs more than ups. <br /><br />Ive had 2 experiences with GHB and neither of them was i happy with in the end, yes it is fun some times, but the time its not fun, you might die, the shits dangerous. I was told that after convulsing, i had no pulse for a min or so, then just snaped the fuck out of it. 2nd and last time. But to each his own. Just be careful, theres no dose cushion witht that shit, threshold and OD is a fine line.<br /><br />Also, unless you particularly enjoy xanax bars, and are just using them for sleep, i can suggest some tylenol PMs instead. The xanax make you very cranky when you wake, verry cranky. If you think there may be a moment where you need to come down and straightn up in a sense for some reason or another, maybe some valium for that.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Bring some Ket and some percocets or roxys, im not sure what your stance on opiates is. i like to snort half a 30 and eat the other half when binging, gives me a nice dirty high, when im looking for it anyway...and maybe some haspium if any is available. But def K in the mix, esp with the 2c-b and MDMA, makes for an incredible cap. Much love dude.

				Also dude, if your new to xanax go real easy with them at first, even if you dont think their working, that dose you explained seems like alot, One 2mg xanax bar will fuck face a 200lb man, and you will think your absolutely fine, whilst acting like the town drunkard. Its strong sneaky stuff.

Before she left I had evidently crawled into bed with my clothes / glasses on and and sawing logs in no time so she wasn&#039;t worried (and she knew I had the night set aside for drug testing anyway, god I love honest relationships).<br /><br />To say that shit sneaks up is a fucking fantastic little understatement. I felt not even a little fucked up on the stuff at all up until the point where I don&#039;t remember anything. Watching TV, reading the net, writing a paper, out like a freaking light. Pretty sure 1-2mg is about where it&#039;s at for me to take the edge off even a sharp high, more than that is evidently spontaneous bed time at whatever moment it decides to strike me.<br /><br />Since we are all about the lovey connected thing I think the LSD / MDMA thing will be a good sweet spot for the weekend. I&#039;ve got two tabs of Tess&#039;s headed to my door soon and debating a whole hit or 3/4 each for the adventure. Since we&#039;re at a hotel, I mostly want the mind expanding love the universe trip without too much of the &quot;How do I make the aliens stop trying to eat my soul?&quot; sort of issues that can come up if we get mind locked into a bad spot. Pretty sure the E will keep it pretty cuddly for us though and worse case we are sort of the most important person in each others life so there&#039;s a good deal of trust / love there to keep things positive.<br /><br />Tonight&#039;s adventure is going to be 1.5g of GHB with maybe a .5 chaser. I&#039;m worried it&#039;s so much like alcohol that it might give me the spins / pukes which I would prefer to avoid on a fun night with the girl.

It is one of the friendliest substances you can partake in given a proper set and setting, and at a dosage of about ~200ug, you will be hard pressed to experience such negative thought loops. Such mindfucks typically occur at much higher dosages. Also, since you will be combining it with MDMA, you will experience a beautiful empathogenic pull filled with positivity, wonder, and excitement, especially if you time the peaks. Take the entire tab, you&#039;ll appreciate it. I also still stand by my previous recommendation completely, but perhaps moving the 2C-B up an hour. One day you will experience LSD + MDMA + 2C-B and see exactly how beautiful it is. I will actually be partaking in this combo this weekend, with the following lineup:<br /><br />T+0:00: ~400ug JackieChan&#039;s LSD<br />T+2:00: 140mg luckylucianno&#039;s MDMA<br />T+4:00: 30mg mahakala&#039;s 2C-B<br />T+6:00: 50mg jesusofrave&#039;s DMT<br />T+8-10: 2-3g BlueGiraffe&#039;s GHB<br /><br />I&#039;ll report back with my results. Cheers, brother! :)

				100% Agree on the probably overestimating the LSD side of things. Tess&#039;s were supposed to be running at about 200ug and I always figured 100ug would be a good starting place but I&#039;ve been bumping the estimate up as I read more and more. I think with the known good MDMA as sort of a buffer into the trip at about 2 hours it&#039;s going to be hard to get into much of a bad spot. As you can imagine, I mostly just want to create a great day for me and my girl with the smallest possibility that one of us won&#039;t have much fun. I think I might just bump it up to a full tab though and go with it. <br /><br />We&#039;ve had more than a few nights where one of us went a little too far but we still have fun with playing with all the drugs so I think even if a full hit was too far we&#039;d still end up having a good time with it.<br /><br />Sounds like we&#039;ll be getting high about the same time as you so make sure to send us some good vibes when you start feeling it and we&#039;ll make sure to do the same!<br /><br />Take care.

				I have found its best not to think too hard about this stuff beforehand. Psychedelic itineraries are tricky. Things never go as planned. That would be boring. Just keep any no-no combos in the back of your mind going into it and go with the flow!

				Try an experiment where you take ~100ug of LSD and just LSD.<br /><br />Would be better for you to know a bit more of what to expect since you think LSD can cause aliens to steal your soul. lol.&nbsp; Have fun brother

I wasn&#039;t able to score more than 2 tabs of Tess&#039;s hits this time (thanks in no small part to the insanely long shopping list I had already put in my cart). My &quot;fear&quot; is not so much with me having a bad trip, I&#039;ve roughed out some chemicals that got me to some pretty odd places and normally just look back with a smile about the adventure, it&#039;s more so I just don&#039;t want my girl and I to disassociate with each other during the trip, at least not for too long. When we are on MDMA it is all us all the time and my hope was to add a little more universal conscience to the adventure without having that become the central theme. <br /><br />After chatting with you all though I think I am just going to go with it and see what happens at a hit each. If things get weird, odds are they will get weird for both of us so we&#039;ll end up having some good stuff to talk about regardless. I was describing Moxy to my girl the other night and telling her how at small doses it&#039;s sort of a stim and gives some neat physical push but at larger doses it becomes a little psychedelic and she was all &quot;Well psychedelic is fun!&quot;, so I think she is really game for whatever.<br /><br />Only two days left before we get to find out how it all goes for us.
