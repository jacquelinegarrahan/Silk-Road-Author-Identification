				Well I believe dex is d-amphetamine and adderall is a-amphetamine, so likely amphetamine sulfate (speed) would be the most similar, and it arguably the cheapest substance on the road at about 10-20 USD a gram

				Dexies are a good option they are made in lab conditions.<br /><br />The speed is made in a jungle lab - i think the OP was after pharmaceutical grade but i may be wrong <br /><br />

				You get the same kind of feeling from orally taking ritalin as you did from adderall?&nbsp; Wow... I could never tell I took it unless I snorted it.

Or read the meth review thread; lots of good vendors around at the moment.&nbsp; And start really small. I mean you really don&#039;t need a very large chip to feel it.&nbsp; 50-100mg is a lot smaller than those pills -- they&#039;re mostly filler.&nbsp; It&#039;s a replacement for adderall.&nbsp; Not a great one, but it gets the job done, for the most part.&nbsp; Just take it sparingly.&nbsp; Amphetamines really are extremely habit forming.

				Maybe phentermine (sp?) also known as Adipex. Its has similar pharmaology as amphetamine I do believe. Its prescribed as a diet pill, but with a controlled dosage. Maybe reasearch that and see if its comparable to what your looking for.&nbsp;

				A buddy of mine said that before ADD/ADHD blew up he would take small doses of speed (it&#039;s really cheap too) with small doses of xanax. I&#039;ve never tried it but I can see how it worked out for him.

				I really wouldn&#039;t recommend phentermine.&nbsp; For one, it didn&#039;t really work very well for me personally and I&#039;ve never heard of it being prescribed for ADHD.&nbsp; For two, after abusing it for a few weeks many years ago, I started getting chest pains.&nbsp; They&#039;ve never gone away.&nbsp; Very rare, maybe once or twice a week, but it&#039;s always concerned me.&nbsp; Only happens after I eat though, so I think it&#039;s probably a stomach valve or something and not my heart.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really know.&nbsp; You may react differently, of course, but again: I wouldn&#039;t recommend it.

Phentermine is an amphetamine as well. Amphetamines are used to treat ADHD, and there for in theroy phentermine might be a cheap alternative to Adderall/Ritalin, it might work for some, and not for others.&nbsp; Also I didnt mean to sound like dout your pain, just had never heard that as a side effect. One thing you might look in to is maybe it caused an ulcer in your stomach, and when you eat or drink something it upsets it? IDk just a random thought.
