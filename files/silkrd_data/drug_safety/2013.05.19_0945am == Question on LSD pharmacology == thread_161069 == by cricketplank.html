				This might be posted in the wrong section.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if among all the well versed amateur and professional pharmacologists on SR if someone could answer me this<br /><br />What aspect of LSD causes diuresis? is it something to do with calcium channel agonism in the renal tubules?<br /><br />Also what is the mechanism that causes dry mouth both with LSD and marijuana, or are they different maybe (presuming same mechanism as similar chemical structure?)<br /><br />Thanks for insight<br />

				I can&#039;t say specifically what causes it, but I do know LSD will cause a little bit of vasoconstriction which could explain urinary issues in sensitive individuals.<br /><br />I do know that there is no chemical similarity between marijuana and LSD though, so that can be ruled out.<br /><br />Any pharmacologists want to chime in with details?

				I forgot marijuana would be with cannibinoid pathways? would it not have effect on 5-HT receptors?<br /><br />lsd as vasoconstrictor could be related to antidiuretic hormone, but diuresis would be from vasodilation (i think?). Thinking about my last LSD experience, I would consider it to have had &quot;high ceiling&quot; diuretic effects! I&#039;m thinking maybe it has a Cl- antagonist effect, or maybe has effects on the posterior pituitary inhibiting ADH release? <br /><br />could be similar pathways with salivary stimulation? composition directly altered by antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone, sympathetic nervous system causes thickening of saliva (Cl- antagonism theory could link in here).<br />Also noticed it&#039;s the same ion transporter in salivary acinar cells as in loop of henle in kidney (Na/K/Cl carrier)<br /><br />must be some pharmacologists here who have come across this<br /><br />

				Well, dry mouth from cannabis is a physical side effect and dry mouth from LSD is a chemical side effect. And actually I think that on LSD, you just need more water to be hydrated, because I am always just thirsty rather than having a dry mouth. <br /><br />And I kind of differ on the subject of urinating on LSD. I am usually normal, but sometimes I can&#039;t really piss. There was a talk on this in the LSD thread. Link below:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=84848.330

				thanks DMTisinME, this is an interesting thread alright, and i&#039;m sure that we could find good statistics, but i&#039;ll just have to do the reading on the pharmacology side myself i think!
