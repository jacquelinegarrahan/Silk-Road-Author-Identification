				So I&#039;m going to my first legitimate rave soon, and I&#039;m a little undecided as to what drugs I should consume there.&nbsp; I will be taking 200-400mg of MDMA throughout the night, but I want something else to supplement the experience, besides weed.&nbsp; My options are as follows:<br /><br />MXE<br />25C-NBOMe<br />25I-NBOMe<br />2C-B<br /><br />What would YOU take?&nbsp; As of now, I&#039;m leaning toward 2C-B.

				Hello happyroller1234,<br /><br />If it&#039;s your first rave you may well just be happy with the MDMA. <br />I would recommend if you are going to supplement it to use 2c-b as I have heard they combine nicely.<br /><br />At the very end (if you feel up for it) throw in some 25I-NBOMe.<br /><br />Have a fun night my friend!<br />&nbsp;8)

				Take 90mg MDMA with 60mg MDA, wait till this peak starts to wear off (around3/4 hours) and snort 10-13mg 2c-b. You&#039;ll have a great time man, its my personal favorite for raves, keeps you raving for around 9+ hours. :) enjoy!

				As it&#039;s your first rave I&#039;d stick to one drug, unless you&#039;re very familiar with the combination you&#039;re wanting to take. MDMA on itself is awesome and you&#039;ll have a great night. If you insist on taking multiple drugs then go for 2C-B. Do be aware not to take too much of either, combining drugs asks for lower doses of both unless you&#039;re experienced. It&#039;s easy to take some more if you want to, but once it&#039;s in you can&#039;t get it out and it can turn the fun rave into a hellish nightmare.

				MDMA and you should be g2g. After the rave take a nice shower and smoke some good bud.<br /><br />I personally wouldn&#039;t take 2cb at a rave. I did 25mg of nawlins with a group of friends at home and I was acting weird. Maybe a lower dosage would have made the experience a better one for me.

				I&#039;ll also going to my first real rave tomorrow night! I&#039;m ridiculously excited, and I have the best MDMA on the Silk Road as far as I can tell. Me and a few friends were considering candy flipping, but I need to be able to drive when it&#039;s over, so just MDMA for me. I figure everyone will be rolling anyways, I&#039;ll just be joining the fun.

				Forgot to add to the MDMA + 2-cb combo.. bump lines of Ketamine 30/40mg every hour or so and whack in some no2 balloons whilst you&#039;re rollin on this combo and you&#039;ll be in euphoria rave heaven.

				This isn&#039;t my first rave at all, but I have some qs for yall:<br />I&#039;m taking 2c-e not 2c-b and mandy the first day. It looks like I should start with the MDMA then 3 or 4 hours later take the 2c-e. Thinking plugging 3 mg or so. Will that get me through 12+ hours? Will I have to redose anything? I prob will with the MDMA because I usually drop half a g or so in that space of time. But will the 2c-e keep me going or will I need to redose the MDMA while I&#039;m on it?<br />Next day doing some nice acid, but I think I have that sorted...

				My first rave, I had 4 hits of LSD only because my friend broke the capsule of MDMA I had. No regrets. but if you don&#039;t have any experiences with psychedelics, go with MDMA (I&#039;ve actually never experienced MDMA but heard that it&#039;s tolerated better than LSD in public spaces)

				be safer than a fiend. you don&#039;t want to screw yourself. go for fun. you might have access to all you could want here, but not to binge in public. take some xtc and bring something light for a little kick. you don&#039;t want to be that guy. keep with the flow of the crowd. raves are largely social, not inner intoxication. take a pill and bring some xanax. i got stuck once when they hit the lights and i was still spun. drop and get down. mid night take a xanax to chill out and kick back. people aren&#039;t going to be fiending like you mixing so many drugs that can be affected independantly. there will be plenty more. go in with the right mind set and GROOOVE and meet ppl :)
