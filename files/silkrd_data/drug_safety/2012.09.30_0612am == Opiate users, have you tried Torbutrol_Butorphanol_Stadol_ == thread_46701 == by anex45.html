				So I found a bottle of a bunch of 5mg Torbutrol pills that are apparently Butorphanol and are also in Stadol...I was very surprised to find out it&#039;s supposedly strong and rare.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing...I know it&#039;s an antagonist so I can&#039;t take it right after doing some dope but I can&#039;t find to many personal experiences on how the high is when researching it through Google.<br /><br />Has any opiate users here tried it? I was thinking about waiting at least 16-20 hours after my last dose of heroin before I tried snorting 2.5mg to 5mg of it...would like to IV it but I&#039;m not going to attempt that since I don&#039;t know much about it or how the effects are.<br /><br />&quot;Butorphanol (Stadol) (INN) is a morphinan-type synthetic opioid analgesic developed by Bristol-Myers&quot;

				It looks like it&#039;s for mod-severe pain: 0.5-2mg IV q3-4 prn (start 1mg IV or 2mg IM: Max 4 mg/dose OR anesthesia adjunct: 2mg IV then 0.5-1mg IV prn.<br />Almost all opiates are categorized as &quot;Avoid/Use Alternative&quot; which is one step below &quot;Absolutely Contraindicated&quot; ...the combo with opiates may precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent persons, increase risk of CNS depression, psychomotor impairment (antagonistic effects, additive effects)... like you said, it&#039;s an &quot;opioid agonist-antagonist).<br /><br />The butorphanol nasal dose is only 1mg q3-4h... <br /><br />With the opioid antagonist narcan I&#039;ve noticed the Intra-nasal (atomizer) spray reverses opiate effects much more gently than IM/IV...which usually throws patient&#039;s straight into withdrawl (nausea/vomiting, etc). I&#039;m always a fan of nasal for patients, I&#039;m not sure about the drug you&#039;re talking about though...... this is why I sell narcan with the nasal adapter :) shameless plug

I appreciate the information, I&#039;m going to be in withdrawal soon anyways and that&#039;s why I figured I would try snorting some of these to see if it would get me by until I get my next order. I&#039;m just going to snort a very small amount instead of IVing and see what it does...I&#039;ve had precipitated withdrawals before and those are NO FUN!
