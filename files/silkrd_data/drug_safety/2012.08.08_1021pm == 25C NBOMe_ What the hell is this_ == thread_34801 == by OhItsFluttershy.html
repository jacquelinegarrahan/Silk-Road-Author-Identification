				So I was looking around the site and saw this: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/3a788e0612 It struck my fancy for 2 reasons:<br />1) Anything involving The Simpsons is something I&#039;ll probably enjoy<br />2) I don&#039;t like opiates or anything injectable, but when it comes to drugs hallucinogens are my favorite.<br /><br />So I tried to do a little research on this drug and, sadly, found very little. All I see is that it&#039;s similar to LSD (good) but I don&#039;t know if there are any health concerns or practice tips I should know before trying this. Any advice?

				its a very new chemical so the health effects are very unknown. i have however shared it with numerous friends and have never seen a bad reaction UNLESS it was from taking too high of a dose. i like it more than LSD tbh. it has much more stimulant, and happy effects with very intense visuals depending on the dose used.

				Okay thanks! I might give it a try then! Would it be safe to do alone?

				I happened upon sheets of this chemical on the streets.&nbsp; With my limited experiences ranging from 1-3 tabs and a single 10 tab trip, i can say this is chemical with some fun to offer.&nbsp; health effects aren&#039;t completely known so you&#039;re going to want to limit use.&nbsp; It is safe to use alone from my experiences, although i read some people have drastically different responses.&nbsp; The high is about 8 ish hr&#039;s if i were to guess.<br /><br />

				As long as you&#039;re not new to tripping (doesn&#039;t sound like you are) and you&#039;re&nbsp; in a good mindspace when you start, I&#039;d say you&#039;re fine to do this one alone. Just start with a small dose and work your way up. 300ug is pretty safe, 600ug is a solid trip. <br /><br />If you&#039;re prone to nausea or stomach upset, preload with some drammamine and magnesium an hour or two before dosing.

				Search for 25C on this forum. There&#039;s a lot of recent threads with a lot of awesome info. I&#039;d link you to them but I&#039;m too high, sorry.<br /><br />But all I will say is that 25C is pretty fucking awesome and it has a few advantages. I like that it doesn&#039;t last too long, so I can trip in the evening and fall asleep sort of late, but still be functional the next day.
