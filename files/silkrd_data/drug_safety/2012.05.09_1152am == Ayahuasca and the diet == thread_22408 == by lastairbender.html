				This weekend I&#039;m going to a retreat, to sample the medicine for the first time.<br /><br />We will be drinking the Aya on 2 consecutive nights, in &quot;shamanic doses&quot; under the guidance of a very experienced shaman.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had DMT several times and have managed to break through twice, so needless to say I&#039;m super excited to try the logical extension of that (I know I&#039;m in for a SERIOUS ride&nbsp; ;D ).<br /><br />He has instructed us to maintain a strict cleansing regime for the 4-5 days leading up to the first dose. <br /><br />This includes:<br /><br />- No booze<br />- No caffeine<br />- No other drugs, prescription or otherwise (This makes total sense to me as I realise the problems posed by SSRIs and other drugs)<br />- No sex/masturbation<br />- And eating NOTHING but steamed vegetables and small amounts of rice, with no added flavouring whatsoever (including salt, pepper, etc.), some of the lower sugar fruits and drinking ONLY water. <br /><br />So essentially a complete detox and no fun at all for a meat eating, weed smoking, beer drinker...&nbsp; :-[ <br /><br />He has also told us that the day of the first dose, we should &quot;water-fast&quot; if possible (which I understand the purpose of, for obvious reasons).<br /><br />The thing I&#039;m wondering is, how necessary/desirable is the cleansing diet in the ~4 days leading up to the dose?<br /><br />I&#039;m not a very spiritual person (although that may very well change after the weekend haha!). I mainly rely on proven science and personal experience for determining my behaviour.<br /><br />So I&#039;m curious as to how much of this is to do with the - I don&#039;t want to say it but... - &quot;hippy&quot; aspect of this ritual and how much of it is SCIENTIFICALLY going to contribute to a more positive, enriching and intense Aya experience.<br /><br /><br />Just a note; I&#039;m not looking to circumvent the guidelines that the shaman has put in place (even though all I can think about right now is a bong, a beer and a burger!).<br /><br />I&#039;ll stick to his rules, because it&#039;s fun to actually go into this thing in good faith.<br /><br />Adds to the sense of adventure&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />Wish me luck!

				All hippy except avoidance of pharmaceuticals and avoidance of stimulants (meth, amphetamine, etc).

				It sounds like more of a pre-ritual to me than anything else. Referring to it as a hippy diet is plain wrong. Your guide should obviously know more about this than SR, so why not ask him? <br /><br />I completely agree with him when he says to not eat meat, because DMT has and meat have never gone well for me. I&#039;ve had very intense purges after smoking DMT, not even aya, after a long day of eating meat. There is a point to whatever your shaman is telling you, that&#039;s for sure. He is an aya guide after all. You said yourself you weren&#039;t Spiritual. Sometimes thinking with a scientific mind will not lead to answers you&#039;re looking for, and you&#039;ll probably see that after your ayahuasca experience. Ayahuasca is a very Spiritual experience, and although DMT is considered the Spirit Molecule, that doesn&#039;t mean a switch is going to be flipped and you&#039;ll be Spiritual all of a sudden. Spiritualism is a commitment and way of life. If that&#039;s what you&#039;re genuinely looking for, then Aya can definitely show you the way.

				If I were you, I&#039;d do exactly as told, just like I won&#039;t question my brain surgeon&#039;s directions 5 days before the surgery :) You&#039;re going to go through something massive and you want to be as prepared as you can. In any case, he&#039;s not asking you to do anything out of the ordinary and it&#039;s only a 5-day fast.

				Thanks for the replies dudes.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, as I said I have no intention of breaking the diet.<br /><br />In fact I&#039;m taking it quite seriously, including daily meditation, cutting out my beloved metal for positive, relaxing music, etc.<br /><br />It&#039;s just that my inquiring mind can&#039;t help from asking questions, as per usual.
