				This new child is going to open a huge can of worms. It’s going to devolve into promoting drug use. IMO it is totally unacceptable to sell weapons (FYI, I am a gun enthusiast) and this new forum is yet another step closer to total outrage. It is feeding every available piece of fuel into the cops’ fire to burn down the house. It is inviting – no, demanding – every effort to find the people responsible for SR and destroy them.<br /><br />Rant over.

				I would hack the balls off of every CP perv, producer, and &quot;actor&quot; in the world if I could.&nbsp; That is the line right there - you want to buy six whores and make them earn their fucking money for the night, that&#039;s cool.&nbsp; They are consenting adults.&nbsp; You want to stash enriched plutoniun in your basement, that&#039;s cool too.&nbsp; YOu want an armory in your closet?&nbsp; Fine by me.&nbsp; You want to take any drug under the sun, it&#039;s your body to do with what you will.<br /><br />But CP is over the line.&nbsp; Kids.&nbsp; What the fuck.&nbsp; It&#039;s no coincidence almost every major empire on earth was heavily involved in this kind of stuff right towards their end.<br /><br />Besides, it isn&#039;t LE you should be worrying about.&nbsp; Half the politicians are into this shit anyway.&nbsp; What you should be worrying about are the vigilante groups that ARE on top of the tech and can storm this place.&nbsp; Why risk it so some sick fucks in desparate need of castration can get their jollies off?

				I believe if people are getting to this site, they are most likely decided that they are going to use. I hardly would see a HR thread make someone take a drug or manner of taking it. We are promoting drug use all over this site. With GPG keys, covert ways to sell thru the mail. <br /><br />There are all types of Harm reduction techniques used in the community every day. They are called needle exchanges. This thread is not about promoting any drug. It&#039;s PRO safety.

				I do respect your views, op. but, what if someone died because they purchased on silk road. Now, that would garner tons of unwanted attention. We cant save everyone and everyone has to take it upon themselves to be safe. But, I think SR was very smart by putting this thread here. If anything, this gives the appearance that sr gives a shit and wants everyone to be safe...

				I agree about keeping guns out of SR. While selling drugs online will certainly outrage conservatives (and certain democratic senators), the more liberal minded are less inclined to care as much or take it up as a &quot;cause.&quot; Selling illegal guns, on the other hand, is guaranteed to piss off liberals. Stopping the sale of guns will likely make SR less of a target for politicians and such.<br /><br />I think this topic deserves it&#039;s own thread.
