				Well...1mg is a set mass Pawl&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />But to give you a VERY general ballpark for what 1mg looks like...it&#039;s about the size of a (small) grain of sand.&nbsp; Nothing you should ever eyeball.

				10mg of any phen is gonna look so miniscule I feel the only way to send that is ready to consume. <br /><br />But ya you should never eyeball it but I guess if you really wanted to try and see what 1mg looks like without an expensive scale you can take a known amount of a substance, dilute it in like everclear (a known amount) say 20mg of 2ce diluted in 10ml everclear then take a syringe and pull 0.5ml and lay it on some glass.<br /><br />Once it evaporates theoretically you should be left with about 1mg =] <br /><br />This is all for shits and giggles though

				I hadn&#039;t thought about disolving it and then evaporating it away.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s just mind boggling to me how such a tiny amount of anything can have such profound effects on the human mind.<br /><br />It fascinates me. It draws me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Before when I heard about Bromo dragonfly, I became obsessed for a short while because .5 mg...&nbsp; wow.&nbsp; I would be fascinated by LSD, but I don&#039;t believe in it.<br /><br />2c-p, Bromo Dragonfly, and the &quot;Noms&quot;<br /><br />These things need dissolved in alcohol, not distilled water?

				What do you mean you don&#039;t believe in LSD? Its seriously one of the most potent psychedelics in existance noticeably active at around what &lt;0.00025gm? That&#039;s real fascination right there brother =]

				328502E dont be sarcastic and belittle someones statement if you dont yourself understand what you are blabbering about<br /><br />well 1mg is a set mass? duh... you really missed an important aspect, known as density. every chemical has a different density which means the volume the chemical takes up in space is different for the mass of each respective molecule...<br /><br />1 mg of a high density substance will be extremely small, a speck that could fit within the point from the lead of a .5 mm mechanical pencil, easily<br /><br />1 mg of a low density substance will be much more fluffy and take up more area, like the size within this &quot;o&quot; about the size of a small seed.<br /><br />for example, 1 mg of rocked heroin is a few grains of sand. once crushed and powdered with a lower density, a larger pile is produced. both still 1 mg<br /><br />ONE SOULD ABSOLUTELY NEVER EYEBALL SUCH A TINY MASS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO ACCURATELY. especially for 2c-p, with such a steep dose response curve, only a couple milligrams can be the difference between not tripping, tripping enjoyably, or overdosing. <br /><br />a volumetric measurement as suggested above should be used. every molecule has a different solubility in every solvent, so you cant use a blanket statement for all, but most RCs used these days seem to be fairly soluble within alcohol. This includes phenethylamines (2c-x)<br /><br />Can the person explain why they stated not to believe in LSD but are talking about br-dragonfly and phenethylamines???&nbsp; they are all semi-synthetic psychedelics based on a natural alkaloid backbone??? also what are the &quot;noms&quot;?

				You have to think of drugs as essentially computer programs and the more complex the effects the smaller they get (by and large) because that 1 molecule is more complex, it does more work and has more effects. <br /><br />If you look at say MDMA in comparison to LSD and their chemical structures and their dosage ranges you will see what I mean.<br /><br />The more complex - the smaller doses of shit gets. <br /><br />One of the few exceptions of this I can think of offhand at 3am though is Mescaline.<br /><br />

				Thanks modest mouse, <br /><br />The reason I say I don&#039;t belive in LSD is because I&#039;ve been used to buying on the street.&nbsp; I&#039;&#039;ve bought &quot;LSD&quot; but was it really?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; The first blotter I ever tried was 2c-I.&nbsp; I bought the fuck out of it when it was here for a moment.&nbsp; So, when people around here claim they have acid, lsd, I don&#039;t believe them, I don&#039;t trust what they are selling, I ignore them.&nbsp; LSD and ACid here is a blanket term for psychedelic substance.&nbsp; It bothers me.&nbsp; I want to know what I&#039;m taking.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like they would say &quot;oh, I got some 2c-e(or whatever)&quot; and I would back off.&nbsp; I would Love them.&nbsp; Literally. Most LSD is just RC&#039;s.&nbsp; at least the stuff sold in real life, (not SR, though I heard people were passing off RC&#039;s as LSD here too.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I bought some MXE off the street.&nbsp; Dude didn&#039;t know how to properly take it, I asked, he said snort it.&nbsp; whatever, I bought all I could afford.&nbsp; I love MXE.&nbsp; A few days later some guy I know asks me if I&#039;ve tried the Ketamine that has been around. he pointed at the dealer&nbsp; &nbsp; ok, so, MXE = Ketamine around here.&nbsp; If a street dealer said he had ketamine, I would believe him no more than I would believe a guy who said he had LSD.<br /><br /><br />*thinks about the girl who had bloodshot eyes for weeks after letting a guy drop &quot;lsd&quot; into her eyes&quot;*<br /><br />I&#039;m sure LSD exists,&nbsp; &nbsp;but I&#039;m going to avoid it until I marry a chemist.

				i know what you mean about blotters and not know what drug is actually on them. interesting story about the dangers: I had a seizure and possibly was close to dying on one occasion after receiving an unknown blotter sold as LSD, mixing with ecstasy and then trying to take something to sleep after i should have been coming down. later found out it was more likely a psychedelic amphetamine. it was scary, i was convulsing and came back to, still shaking and sweating gallons feeling like i was on fire, stripping from my outer layers of clothing out in the winter freeze trying to cool down and get my temp down. plus my mind went crazy and i started hearing voices, unable to think clearly or hardly talk and still shaking like i had parkinsons with the effects subsiding over the next day. still dont feel completely normal all the time, have mild recurrence of the body feeling or mental intrusion when i get real worked up or nervous. luckily am able to trip still with no negative effects. <br /><br />too bad people cant just sell blotters for what is actually on them, they are all worth the experience... just not worth as much<br /><br />i definitely know there is some lsd out there, so dont pass up every tab that comes by. just try to obtain from a reliable source and if it matches a set of characteristics, like no taste, correct pharmacokinetic profile and subtle effects between different molecules...&nbsp; plus if you cant tell the difference between 25x and lsd then whats the problem really, its an enjoyable clean psychedelic trip youre after anyhow. the main problem is one overpays I guess or ends up in a situation like mine, though if i hadnt mixed i woulda been fine...&nbsp; <br /><br />Kat, once you reach 100 posts you will be able to give out karma<br /><br />also TS, are you sure you had a blotter of 2c-i?? This is not normally found on blotter because dosages range around 20 mg. I am not aware of such large amounts being held by blotter paper unless you were munching on a giant square lol. generally only a couple mg max are on blotter, really limiting the compounds that can even be administered using a tab. You may be referring to 25-i which has active dosages within microgram quantities common to blotter. 2c-i and 25-i nbome are very different molecules - completely different psychedelics.&nbsp; also, mxe and k have different pharmacokinetic profiles and should indicate which you were sold. onset and duration for mxe is extended i believe, havent used mxe though so you should double check<br /><br />No problem, glad i could help clarify... appreciate the appreciation :)<br />- modest mouse

				&nbsp; I think the fact that I was told it was 2c-I really drives home the point about mislabeled crap.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; I really have no clue what it was now.&nbsp; It was really nice though.&nbsp; Really shroomy like.&nbsp; They swore they got it from a chemist...&nbsp; but who knows.&nbsp; No idea why they would lie though.&nbsp; at that time in my life, they could have told me it was just a RC,&nbsp; and I&#039;d have been happy.&nbsp; I dosed every day for a week, I loved it.&nbsp; I was sold 2c-b on a little tiny weird strip, it seemed just like the previous shit. Thankfully I&nbsp; found this place, now I can buy legitimate shit.&nbsp; Although, my wallet is not going to thank me, especially when I buy more than I&#039;ll ever do.&nbsp; Fuck it, I&#039;m starting a molecule collection.<br /><br />&nbsp; This week, it will be 2c-B and 25i.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m actually getting nervous about taking this stuff, although thats normal.&nbsp; I get nervous when I shroom, and I&#039;ve shroomed many dozen times.

				I&#039;ve often seen friends lay 2ci on ffat blotters and I&#039;ve also seen people refer to 25i nbome as 2ci nbome so maybe it was either of the two.<br /><br />More often than not the kids on the street don&#039;t remember what their vendor told em it was and they shouldn&#039;t touch it<br /><br />2c-b will ease your nerves though fast man
