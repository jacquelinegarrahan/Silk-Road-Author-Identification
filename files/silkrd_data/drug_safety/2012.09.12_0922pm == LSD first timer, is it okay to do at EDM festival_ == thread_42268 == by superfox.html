				I&#039;ve heard both good and bad things about trying it for the first time at an EDM festival (Tiesto!) and I&#039;m a little worried seeing as though I&#039;m a paranoid person and have had bad molly trips (if possible...?) <br /><br />vut do.

				Personally, I wouldn&#039;t waste my first LSD experience with hundreds of strangers around in a very uncontrolled environment. Depends on the dose I guess, but still, I would do it in a much more personal way.

				Everyone is different so if you&#039;ve never taken it before it&#039;s impossible to know how it will be for you.<br /><br />A low dose would most likely be ok, but a dose of 150mic for my brother was fine (trippy but without visuals) and the same dose for his friend freaked him out (visuals and complete mind fuck). My girlfriend took half the dose I took when we both tried it our first time and she had a really intense trip compared to mine.<br /><br />If you have the time and the acid I would suggest dosing ahead of time (at least a week in advance due to tolerance) to see how you do on it and then go into the trip at the festival more comfortable with what&#039;s to come.<br /><br />Hope this helps and happy tripping.

				it depends on your mental state...<br /><br />the first time i took acid my friends took me with them to the mall...i kinda had a bad trip simply because i thought i was acting weird in public and i felt like everyone on their cellphone was calling the police to report me...<br /><br />paranoia and hundreds of unfamiliar faces in a unfamiliar environment is a bad idea...<br /><br />before we went to the mall i was in the safety of my friend&#039;s living room and i was having a pretty good trip there...i was having a blast just sitting on the floor which transformed into a lush green meadow with blue skies and fluffy white clouds while millions of iridescent fractal butterflies flew around me...<br /><br />it might be very mentally overwhelming your first time so it&#039;s important to be around people you know and trust in a place you know and trust<br /><br />once we left the safety of my friend&#039;s house i started to bad trip...

				I wouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; I get freaked out sometimes at large shows and I&#039;ve done LSD hundreds of times.&nbsp; Plus on L all that electro music shows its evil self and isn&#039;t pleasant to the tripping ear.

				Don&#039;t do it. <br /><br />The more comfortable your surrounding is - the better the trip. And bad trip is a trip to hell.

				Alright thanks y&#039;all. My sorority sister took acid once and is trying to convince me out of it, she had a bad trip at a party. She&#039;s gonna end up going with us to the EDM festival. I was wondering, is it okay to do by myself?

				Tripping in public takes some practice. Chances are you will get bad anxiety and panic attacks. I lost sense of reality completely during my first few trips.
