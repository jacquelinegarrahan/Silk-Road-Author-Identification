				hello! We also work in our hospital with ketamine for narcotic so i know something about it!<br />If you IV 0,01 too much you gonna die, because you can&#039;t breathing anymore and you are dying because you get respiratory depression very slowly, i also have an patient which has IV ketamine and he died!<br /><br />So it is your life you can IV 10 grams Ketamine if you wanna die, but in my opinion it is better to snort ah bigger line than to iv! It have also nearly the same effects because Ketamine is also going into blood aftery ou snorted it but only 15 minutes after and than you have the same effect if you IV this! With IV you have the effect in seconds but is too risky to die!<br />Some people talk about&nbsp; not more of 0,15gram, this is the highest dose! But do that not!<br /><br />IF you really do&nbsp; it ps explaiin your rush and how much have you taken, don&#039;t know if you heat it up or not!<br /><br />Wish you the best, but do this not allone&nbsp; if something happens!<br /><br />Be carefully and think about it, you also get very high for snorting it!<br /><br />Regards

And you say these idiocies? C&#039;mon please, make up a better lie next time.<br />Ketamine IV can produce Apnoea on excess doses or if injected too fast, but dying from it can happen only in certain cases (as with opioids or for some natural respiratory dysfunction in the user), it DOESN&#039;T happen by itself. So you are saying a lot of bullshit here.<br /><br />For a normal user without other drugs interactions (and only if those interactions can cause Apnoea too, as the aforementioned opioids) it&#039;s IMPOSSIBLE to die by Ketamine, IV or not doesn&#039;t make ANY difference. The Apnoea last very briefly and it is not enough to kill you, and you will lose consciousness much before injecting enough to die (you will have to have someone to do that for you). <br /><br />As for &quot;you IV 0,01 too much you gonna die&quot; that&#039;s a complete and utter lie and imbecility; SOURCE please?

I said that with IM or IV it is simpler (and probably more trustworthy in the sense that you are almost 100% sure you will got there with the right dose), but I know many people that can reach a K-Hole without problems snorting K. It will just take more K and successive bumps, but it is doable.

				@BlackIris : youngblood may indeed be saying strange thing however you are mistaken on this (can&#039;t seem to insert a quote)<br /><br />EDIT: this is bollocks<br />Yes ketamine CAN kill you through its intended usage.&nbsp; Ketamine is used during operations because it stops the patient from breathing (without harming anything of course) at high enough doses.&nbsp; I can&#039;t ever imagine it happening at a party however, the person would have to be a MEGA ket head..<br />EDIT: the bollocking stops here.&nbsp; Please disagree with the rest if you like.<br /><br />@bodnostrokulum : I&#039;m going to try and answer your question while everybody else bickers :p<br /><br />Injecting Ketamine is actually a very good idea if you know what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; That is why you&#039;re going to inform yourself as much as you can before you do it.<br />People large and wide from what i&#039;ve read seem to prefer IM to IV, mainly because they prefer the effects with IM.&nbsp; I have only ever done IM and the doses vary according to the ket.<br /><br />My highest dose was 100mg of S Isomer.&nbsp; That was quite the blast.&nbsp; Re-dosing after is recommended only if you lower the dose since the ketamine still in your blood and brain will add up.<br />I strongly suggest starting with low 50mg doses and scaling up gradually.&nbsp; Maybe even across several days spaced out until you feel you&#039;ve broken through the way you wanted to.<br />100mg was the limit for me, I can&#039;t imagine what would happen with more and I&#039;m not sure I want to know, maybe someone else can enlighten us.<br /><br />Describing my experience is rather hard.&nbsp; Not only do you leave your body but reality starts smoothly blending itself into forms of energy.&nbsp; I became a form of energy, possibly my soul.&nbsp; I remember flying about a giant dreidel shaped entity with others.&nbsp; Without a single word but having understood everything, this big form of energy was reality and me and several other cosmonauts had joined in to make it spin and turn.<br />I also remember that, at times I realized what I was going through (not always the case the first time) and was able to mold my trip, without resisting it.<br /><br />Now this is only what I remember best.&nbsp; I am by far not the most experienced person with this but i&#039;ve done it enough times to recommend it (and recommend IM which is MORE than sufficient, IV seems rather unnecessary) and if you need advice, PM me!&nbsp; It&#039;s always best to be reminded and told what not to forget!<br />Most important : a decent scale that can measure milligrams, just as important as clean needles imo!<br />

				I forgot to mention, once you try IM I think you&#039;ll realise it&#039;s much worth the effort compared to snorting it.<br /><br />You always get that nasty drip when you shovel all that ket required to k-hole!&nbsp; The most important however is IM is a MUCH cleaner experience.&nbsp; It also seems to reduce your perceived half-life of the drug and you don&#039;t have to clean your nose after :p<br />Finally I suggest a light dinner and not too much alcohol when taking high doses!!! A sitting up position can also be more recommended to lying down flat on your back if taking a lot. Can&#039;t stress that too much! Keep it safe so you can let yourself go.<br /><br />PS: if you meet bob tell him I said hi, he&#039;ll know, you barely have to say it

This tied with the apnoea caused by fast injecting ketamine IV *can* (but also in this case it is NOT sure, some factors should be present, as a fast injection or an already started OD to the original substance) bring you to death.<br />C) Someone else injects you a Ketamine OD via IV.<br /><br />In all the other cases it&#039;s impossible. It&#039;s impossible to overdose on K by oneself either by IV. You will go unconscious much before it happens. As for the aponea caused by fast injection, that subsides fast, and it is not enough to kill a sane individual. At most you will blackout for 1-2 minutes and the breath will restart by its own.<br /><br />If you can provide me a scientific source that say that it&#039;s possible to die by OD injecting Ketamine IV *alone* on a sane individual without the addition of an external artificial cause I will delete this account immediately and will never return (this is just to demonstrate to you how sure I am of this; it simply is impossible - I studied extensively medical papers on K before trying it several years ago).<br /><br />There have been deaths by IV Ketamine, yes, but in 90% of the cases the death was caused by something having nothing to do with K at all (as the individual drowning, for example) and in the other 10% of cases the death cause was included in the ones I mentioned.

				@BlackIris:&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see those papers, out of pure curiosity of course I don&#039;t doubt your word.&nbsp; I suppose that theoretically speaking, you could!&nbsp; Practically speaking, I agree you&#039;re quite likely to lose it before you push your plunger half-way.<br />Everything depends on the dosage anyway.&nbsp; I would only recommend IV with ANY drug to someone who has medical experience.&nbsp; Needless to say, i&#039;m not a fan of anything IV (pun intended). I loathe blood tests and need a lot of courage to donate blood and finally I would only let a qualified nurse puncture MY veins.&nbsp; Maybe a scrumptious brunette with a soothing voice... that could help.<br /><br />To conclude, if someone really wants to try a heavy trip on ketamine, try IM first, much less hassle and much safer.&nbsp; It also gives you enough time to take the needle out, leave it in a safe place, sit back straight, say &quot;au revoir&quot; and enjoy.&nbsp; Invest in a decent scale as well.&nbsp; One that measures mgs (0.001grams).&nbsp; Not one of those for 20 bucks they&#039;ll only last a few months to a year.<br />A short tour on erowid can also provide you with all the information required to practice IV or IM more or less safely.

				@BlackIris: Yes I wanted to know where you found and read those papers. Cool anyway, i&#039;ll bookmark that, thanks.<br /><br />I put forward the assumption that ketamine stops breathing and that is why it is used, however that&#039;s not the case I admit.&nbsp; In fact it&#039;s quite the contrary.&nbsp; I have no idea where that assumption came from and I beg your pardon.<br /><br />Some people, though, have mentioned the possibility of severe respiratory depression under the effects of ketamine in conjunction with other drugs.&nbsp; I would like to precise that I currently cannot link this information to a reliable source or medical paper.&nbsp; However you seem to have mentioned it already.<br /><br />Finally, I found youngblood&#039;s comments absurd due to the doses he was mentioning. <br /><br />so... got something to say about your last trip or is something else bothering you? I don&#039;t think the person who started the thread wanted to hear all this.<br /><br />Actually there was a number of studies linking candle holders to quite a lot of deadly accidents.&nbsp; I read extensively about candleholders before deciding whether to buy one or not.

Would you please stop now to spread bullshit around?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i have snorted quiet some k and had mind blowing rides but till now i stayed away from needles.. i guess mainly cause of the heroin stigma. <br />do you think one cant reach the full effects of a ketamine-ride without injecting it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />what does ketamine has to do with heroin? so someone injecting steroids shouldn&#039;t because of heroin stigma ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i never told anyone what to inject and what not. i only stated my relationship with injecting things.<br />from what i understand &#039;a stigma&#039; is most of the times a uneducated generalization, and it was simply a guess why my preferences are towards &#039;not&#039; injecting drugs.<br /><br />please inject your steroids all day long, i do not care ;)<br /><br />regards minchia
