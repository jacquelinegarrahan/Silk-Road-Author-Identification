				So I&#039;m just throwing in my experience on 25i, I wrote this on 2 other threads but only DMTryptamine285 has commented that he had a similar experience..<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways, about over a week ago I got my 25i NBOMe&#039;s and took them now and then, until 5 days ago I took a blotter and a half, which was approximately 1800ug. I proceeded to smoke a joint (I haven&#039;t smoked weed in 3 weeks, and 3 weeks ago I had only smoked a couple of times, before that, 6 months clean, so it really hit me good).<br /><br />Anyways, after a while, I was just really high, and decided to eat a bag of chips, upon eating, I realized, I could not feel my body. I could not feel my face. But I kept on eating. I finally realized, that my &quot;framerate&quot; was so slow, what I was seeing, and what I had felt, were completely off sync.<br /><br />I began losing my trait of thought and became really confused. I felt sick, I tried rubbing my face to see if I could still control myself, and I felt like I was actually Schizophrenic. My reaction was so slow to things that I thought I was schizophrenic and another persona of myself is controlling myself. I was getting worried because I thought it was not possible since I was still conscious, but it genuinely felt like someone else was controlling me, I was shit scared if I stood up and went around the house doing shit, but thankfully I remained in my room.<br /><br />I have never been this scared, I had never taken NBOMe with weed and it had been so long since I smoked. I layed on my bed, stared at the walls and my vision was typically like a NBOMe trip (25i), there were strange spots around me, warping walls... Tons of colors and tracers, its like &quot;snow vision&quot; with the whole pallet of colours off the rainbow...&nbsp; anyways things began to slow down even more. I began recalling muscle memory, this may sound weird but when I twitched my face, or moved my lips, it felt like someone was out there pulling my face and doing it to me (involuntary movements). Have you seen videos of something played backwards? lets say someone is talking and the video is played backwards and his face movements seem odd and silly, or a ball hitting someones face played backwards, I felt like the ball had hit me and returned to the person who threw it with my face feeling fucking weird. I thought my mom was doing it to me (Moving my lips and face), The movements just felt really involuntary.<br /><br />But really I was just really out of it. I got scared that I was going to be brain damaged, I remember before knocking out (Thank GOD the weed helped me sleep, even on NBOMe.. but it was still the mix of the two that fucked me up) I was staring at the wall blankly, I couldn&#039;t hold a thought, I didn&#039;t know what I was, had visions of the universe, how insignificant I was.. Next I either had a dream while knocked out or right before it, but I felt like &quot;God&quot; or an entity with more power and intelligence that was governing the universe was showing me what I really was. It was like I was some kind of ball of energy, and it was persuading me that this IS reality, this is what you really are; The world and your body is nothing like what is lies beyond. And I layed there trying to accept this reality, this way of thinking, this &quot;new perspective&quot; at the time...<br /><br />While I was going through that I was just scared, really worried, but I told myself, just knock out, sleep, you will be ok later, you&#039;re just really really fucking high.. and eventually I woke up and everything was back to normal...<br /><br />Sorry if this made almost no sense, but this was my weird ass experience with 25i and weed, I think it was really because I&#039;ve never smoked in a while and I&#039;m used to smoking weak brick weed... meh If I were to take 25i alone itself, I can enjoy it a lot more, max I&#039;ve taken was 3000ug in one night and I had a great time. The only think I don&#039;t like about 25i is when you have shit cigarettes or nothing to keep your mouth busy like gum. The taste of 25i just lingers and I keep on swallowing my own saliva to satisfy some kind of &quot;urge&quot;.<br /><br />Although I&#039;ve got some weed coming late this week or monday, I&#039;m going to try mixing the two again, because i&#039;m not convinced it will happen again unless I smoke a fuckload or I take the 25i right after my first joint since my tolerance will be in the toilet again... I regret taking them at night though, Always end up sleeping late as fuck and waking up in the afternoons... <br /><br />This is what DMTryptamine285 said <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> While completely off topic I will answer the question because I experienced the same damn thing.<br /><br />I am convinced that weed and 25x-nbome leads to delusional experiences. I do not know why this occurs but it seems to quite regularly. You can be having a great experience and for some reason toking just completely throws you for a loop. I would like to know why this is as well. Perhaps you should start a new thread and see if this happens to anyone else.<br /><br />I have seen some experience reports on other forums regarding the same thing. Unfortunately its too new a substance to figure out the pharmacological reason behind it, I would just like to know if anyone else has experienced that as well. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Has anyone else experienced this, or something similar with the two?

				I personally have difficulty having a great time on 25i without weed. Keep in mind that I am vaporizing, not smoking. <br /><br />25i makes me really uncomfortable sometimes and the weed helps to keep me calm and relaxed and helps with the suicide tuesday, I never trip hard on 25i though. It simply doesn&#039;t have that effect on me.<br /><br />Two 25i trips ago I took 2000ug and I just got body load to the point where I couldn&#039;t get up from bed and overall my trip was terrible but not in a scary way, it was outright boring. When I take 1500ug it&#039;s my best dose and weed only makes the trip feel more &quot;real&quot;. I like to dose the tab(s) and then go vape and by the end of my vape session I&#039;m hitting my plateau.

				Interesting... Well Like I said, when I get my weed either on friday or monday, i&#039;ll try it again (weed and 25i) to see how its like, making sure to smoke weed only first so I have a &quot;tolerance&quot;.<br /><br />Well I mean my 25i trips arent intense, I get pretty horny, and an &quot;urge&quot; to do something. Dancing felt great strangely, even shaking my head! But I get what you mean by 25i making you feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />But I would think Vaping it would have a different experience from smoking it. Last time I vaped with a light bulb and some weed, I got euphoric, but mostly a lazy high. I just felt really stoned, but I&#039;m pretty sure either way of administration would have different effects while on 25i... but I can&#039;t say for sure!

				Whenever I&#039;ve smoked weed on 25i, the visuals increased tenfold making the trip almost overwhelming. If you&#039;re planning on combining the two, especially if you have a low tolerance to weed, make sure you take it slow and ease into the high.
