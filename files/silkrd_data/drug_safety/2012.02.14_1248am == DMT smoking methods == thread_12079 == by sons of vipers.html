				You should either buy a freebase pipe, or the best way to smoke it is to build the machine:<br />hxxps://mycotopia.net/forums/attachments/botanicals/124761d1240376674-where-buy-dmt-oil-burner-pipe-machine.jpg

				Thanks to SR I&#039;ve finally had the chance to try some deems as of late.&nbsp; The machine is definitely one of the best/cheapest ways to efficiently smoke it.&nbsp; At first I tried the sandwich method using cigarette ash but I switched to a rose stem with chore because I&#039;m cheap and lazy, however I did breakthrough.&nbsp; Your main concern is applying direct flame to the dmt, if you do this you will destroy most of it and the smoke will be harsh on your lungs.&nbsp; Once I switched to the stem(crackpipe) I just heat it while rotating until the product melts into the chore, then slowly start inhaling.&nbsp; Hit it 2 or 3 times holding it in as long as you can and you&#039;ll blast off quite nicely.&nbsp; Note that it won&#039;t really feel like you&#039;re inhaling anything, but don&#039;t let that fool you and don&#039;t fear the loud ZINGGG you get in your ears, its normal and will pass.&nbsp; Good luck, see you in anotha life brotha.

				easiest, most foolproof method for smoking dmt is just sandwiching it between two layers of weed (or any other herb of your preference) in a bong. this method has never failed me and i don&#039;t smoke dmt any other way... it just works so well! be sure to hold each hit in for at least 15 seconds. this is very important. :)

				For me personally, due to failing smoking technique, the most fool-proof method is simply an ice bong and Changa.<br />Everyone who fears wasting a lot of DMT on his / her first attempts should consider trying out Changa and in my case I&#039;m sticking with it.

				After many an attempt I can say that not to waste your spice and also not to inadvertently mix it with other substances I do recommend to build the machine as @x8Mx and @x01d suggested.<br />There is a good DMT ongoing thread on this forum - search for &quot;deemsters&quot; to find it :-)

				Freebase pipe didn&#039;t work very well for me. Vaporizing the DMT off of aluminum foil and inhaling it through a straw (which I also made from foil) has been the most effective method for me, at least twice as effective as just sandwiching it between your bud.

For those who don&#039;t know what that is...buy some Chore Boy and a mini-rose at your local 7-11. Take out the mini-rose...insert Chore Boy...and viola. Place .3 DMT in between 2 layers of a tiny bit of weed and good god! I just tried DMT for the first time two weeks ago myself...and I was floored by it. I was tripping balls before I could even exhale all of the smoke.<br /><br />Just tried it again last night, this time I railed a line of Molly 20 minutes before, and it maximized the body high quite a bit.<br /><br />I simply can&#039;t believe I&#039;ve wasted so many years without trying DMT...considering all of the other things I&#039;ve tried...I really missed the bus on this one. Anyone &quot;thinking&quot; about trying DMT...do not wait!

				IMO the best way to unlock the most active parts is to vaporize it. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bitch to work with though, it can be sticky and the portions are so tiny. <br /><br />One tip I got that works is to just put the DMT on top of some semi-spent weed in your volcano vaporizer. <br /><br />The weed is just there so you can easily vaporize the DMT without all the special mesh filters and BS you normally need to vaporize DMT in a volcano.<br /><br />Set to 170F and inflate your bag. Then, boom goes the dynamite. <br /><br />If you get that &quot;tennis shoe smell&quot; that means you&#039;re on the good stuff.<br /><br />I use nearly half as much per hit with this method FWIW.

				I never had a problem with that because i never used it. All i used, and told my friends to use, is the sandwich method. Which ALWAYS provided a breakthrough.<br /><br />Now look around those threads people ask to how they should smoke dmt, people suggesting &#039;the machine&#039;, they try and fail. people keep telling them to vape with a light bulb, - no success for them. Now go look around threads people suggesting the sandwich method, and look not a single one failed with this method.<br /><br />I think its about time to make a review thread about this question as it seems to pop up on a daily basis

				@b0m, I am glad it is working for you.<br />It did not for me. I also prefer not to mix the two in one device.<br />Comparison of different methods would be great!<br />May be we can just tell people to go to DMT-nexus ... There is plenty of info there.

				Wow really you are the first ive seen say the sandwich method didnt work! no kidding. And then the machine worked for you instantly? <br /><br />Indeed dmt nexus is the way to go. But i think its not so good to read that much about it before trying first time. Could make you kinda anxious about it. At least thats what it did to me.

This worked very well and I broke through with just one massive toke. It was incredible. I didn&#039;t use weed to sandwich the DMT as I don&#039;t smoke weed. I use herbal cigarettes that I get in the health shop. They work a treat. :)<br /><br />I was thinking of getting a Vapor Genie as I heard that is very effective as well, but they are really expensive!

				me bad - it is not that sandwich method DOES NOT work, but after trying the machine method IMHO it is just works better for me.<br />there are several reasons for this:<br />- i seem to be breaking thru on smaller quantities (did some of it stay on ashes, herbs when I did smoke it using sandwich method?<br />- i prefer to have a dedicated device for the spice rather than have some of it lingering for the next time I smoke some weed<br />- i find it a lot easier with a smaller internal volume to control the speed of inhaling and overall intake<br />- it seems to be easier for me to load it up, or put a cap on it and pop into my pocket for travel<br />- I also built it with my own hands, which makes the whole experience that small bit more enjoyable :)<br />
