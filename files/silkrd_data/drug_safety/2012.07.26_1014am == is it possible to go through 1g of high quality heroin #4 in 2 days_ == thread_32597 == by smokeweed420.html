				i have been in the suboxone program and clean for many months. Im prescribed 16mg per day but i only take 2.5-3mg per day. im going to stop taking subs for 5 days before i start my little planned vacation next week. i got 1g of heroin #4 from NoGenRx&nbsp; and a couple 8mg dilaudid pills. my question is: will i be able to use all of this in 2 days? i want to be nodding so hard i cant open my eyes for about 2 days straight.

				Anything is possible, doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll live through it.<br /><br />Ahem.<br /><br />Try it and come back and let us know. That way future users will be informed.

				funny u mention this. im on a similar dosage of sub and want to get off and back on H for a bit (will go back to subs eventually). i just came on the forums to search for more info. <br /><br />be careful. ive heard for the first few days while the sub is still in you (up to 3-4 days i believe) u need to take higher dosage of H to feel an effect because the subs are blocking your opirate receptors. especially the first 2 days. but come the 3-4th day and especially the 5th the subs will be more &amp; more out of your system and if u take the same dose as u were in the beginning u could OD. so ive heard. <br /><br />can anyone confirm this? maybe give their opinion of the best way to switch between sub to H/morphine/oxy ?<br /><br />thanks.

All you need to do is lower your dosage 1 to 2 days prior and then the day of, don&#039;t take any sub, just do your H. At lower dosages (2mg and lower), blocking effects are minimal. I&#039;m on 2mg and this is what I do.<br /><br />Also, who cares if you do it in 2, 3, 4 or however many days?

				Uhhh, I like Opiates as much as the next man, or the next multiple surgery patient, but you think that subox program is working for you? Isn&#039;t this the harm reduction sub-forum? I guess its not the addiction counseling forum, but damn try to take a real vacation aka one where your body is completely free of that burden. To quick an addictive substance you have to want to stop first and foremost.<br /><br />&quot;i want to be nodding so hard i cant open my eyes for about 2 days straight. &quot;<br /><br />Why are you even on a sub program?

				You don&#039;t have to prove anything to me, and I wasn&#039;t trying to judge, but isn&#039;t suboxone supposed to be a temporary withdrawal maintenance program? What I mean is, do they intend on having patients on suboxone permanently? I would think after 5 months &#039;clean&#039; of any short acting opiates, you could stop taking opiates entirely?&nbsp; You say your never doing any opiate again, but a big component of addiction and the addictive personality is the memory of how a drug experience was and therefore how it will be in the future. So I would think taking a &#039;vacation&#039; like that aka relapse, would make it that much harder the next time around, if you intend to ever actually be free of opiates, or maybe you just intend to take suboxone for the rest of your life I&#039;m not really sure how that works.&nbsp;

				i think you certainly could. 16 mg of suboxone? that&#039;s quite a dose!<br /><br />+1 (if i could :P) to you for doing it sir. when it&#039;s time to quit, it&#039;s time to quit.
