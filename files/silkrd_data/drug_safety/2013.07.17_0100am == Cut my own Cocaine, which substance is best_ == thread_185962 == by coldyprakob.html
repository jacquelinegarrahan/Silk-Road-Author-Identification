				Hi guys,<br /><br />I already read some threads about cutting coke and I know that many answers are: &quot;dont cut&quot;, &quot;its stupid&quot;, etc.<br />I got very pure cocaine and if I do it at home of course I can make my lines smaller (although I don&#039;t need very big lines anyway). But when I go out, pubs, clubs etc. it&#039;s sometimes on some toilet on my iphone etc. where I do it and I find it very complicated to exactly messure the amount you need. Also I&#039;m afraid of spillling or droping some. So I would only like to make it a bit more to make it easier to messure and not wasting any by doing too big lines or just spilling a bit.<br />From what I read I got these 4 substances I could use:<br />Inositol<br />Glucodin<br />B12<br />Glucose<br /><br />I don&#039;t use it very often so I don&#039;t need big amounts or anything. What would you suggest to use?! Effect wise, health wise and also where/how to get it and how expensive (in europe).<br />Thank you very much for any advices!!

				Try caffeine but it burns your nose!<br /><br />Otherwise, there is mannitol or inositol.

				Just get a snuff bullet (thanks National :P)<br /><br />They are a small glass jar, maybe holds a gram.&nbsp; They have a plastic top where you insufflate from, with a dial you turn on the side.&nbsp; You turn the dial to 6 o&#039;clock, and flip the whole thing upside down.&nbsp; A measured amount of your powder falls into a little chamber.&nbsp; Spin the dial half way around to 3 or 9 o&#039;clock, and it&#039;s trapped in there now.&nbsp; Flip the thing back around, and turn the dial to 12 o&#039;clock.&nbsp; Now, looking down the hole on the top, you can see your blow.&nbsp; You can either insufflate straight from it but I&#039;d recommend using a small straw (otherwise I end up with coke stuck to the bottom of my nose)&nbsp; The measurement is not exact of course but you can try it out at home, dump it out and see exactly how much it holds.&nbsp; It&#039;s about a small line&#039;s worth.&nbsp; <br /><br />They&#039;re like $8 at a headshop.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suppose you could also cut it with something that would help keep it dry inside, maybe a little talcum would be ideal for that?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp;

Out of safety for others if you have fish scale you more or less have to cut it as most people are not used to this level of coke and will just OD. <br /><br />As for &quot;Levamisole&quot;, I swear I read a study from a few years back that most coke was in fact cut with that! yuck, no fucking thank you!

				Take a pestel and mortar and gather the following reagents.<br />x1 bulb (any size)<br />x3 krokodil pill (desomorphine)<br />500mg cat litter (needs to have been used&nbsp; [BY A CAT])<br />50ml of Absolute vodka (any flavour is fine)<br /><br />First, take the bulb and smack the shit out of it inside the mortar.<br />Throw in 3 desomorphine pills and 500mg of cat litter and begin pounding them until its as fine as fuck.<br />Take your cup of absolute vodka and down it (yes, one shot you pussy)<br />Mix that shit with your coke and there you have it! (If colour isn&#039;t white, don&#039;t hesitate to dust some baby powder in there or a thin bit of paint, then let it out to dry)<br /><br />See this is how it works, the tiny shards open the nasal blood vessels even more, allowing more coke to enter the bloodstream, thus getting you higher faster. Concentrated Cat urine insufflated (in this case with cat litter) or ingested has intoxicating effects like GHB(fact), except you&#039;re more clear headed. <br />Don&#039;t get me started about the Krokodil, that shit levels everything out, it will help maintain the coke high for longer, thus using less coke! <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry if it looks like you have a nosebleed, it means its kicking in hard. <br />Never regretted this cut, bitches call my coke &quot;Satans Gooch&quot;<br /><br />Trust me bro, it&#039;s legit
