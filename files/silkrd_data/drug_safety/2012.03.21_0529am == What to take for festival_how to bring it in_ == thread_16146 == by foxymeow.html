				I am going to a festival this weekend and I was wondering what would be the best bet for a long festival. I am kind of leaning away from using too much MDMA as it is a 3 day festival (you know which festival it is) and there is no way I can take MDMA that many days straight or even last the whole day on MDMA.<br /><br />I have 2c-b, 4-ACO-DMT, AMT, Mushroom Caps (Galindoi and Cubensis), Hash Brownies/Hash Soda, MDMA, MDA, and Methylone.<br /><br />What does the SR community recommend and what combinations would be good. I am very excited about 4-ACO-DMT but I have never really used more than a small dose and have only used it in private.<br /><br />I know this is asked often but what are the best ways to sneak drugs into a festival. <br /><br />Do you guys think I could get away with bringing a trippy stick in and just saying its an e-cig.

				Getting it in - Crotch is always popular, in your socks can be done as well.&nbsp; Sometimes in your wallet.&nbsp; If female, you can open a tampon, replace it with drugs (obv in a way that could pass as a tampon) and reseal it with a lighter on the opened end.&nbsp; <br /><br />Order of drugs - I would save stimulant use for day 3 to avoid harsh comedowns during the event.&nbsp; I&#039;d take a break day 2, but I realize most people don&#039;t like going sober (why!?).&nbsp; &nbsp;Which leaves MDMA and a psychedelic.&nbsp; If you keep MDMA dose low, you won&#039;t really have a comedown / deplete your serotonin, so I&#039;d do that day 1, followed by a psychedelic day 2.&nbsp; If you do the psychedelic first, you may notice a large cross-tolerance on the MDMA.&nbsp; <br /><br />If it were up to me though, I&#039;d take a break day two.&nbsp; &nbsp;Take some selegiline or MJ.&nbsp; And yes, selegiline is surprisingly good at raves, just don&#039;t expect it to be a candyflip =).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve read 4-ACO-DMT is pretty much exactly follows shrooms in it&#039;s effects.

				As for getting it in: It all depends on how rough security is, best bet is right on up there behind your balls (if your a dude and sorry for the crudeness) or if they won&#039;t make you take your shoes off just put it in your socks. <br /><br />As for drugs: based on what you have I would go for a nice MDMA and MDA combo throughout day 1, smoking weed, eating brownies and drinking hash soda, maybe a little booze on day 2, and whatever psychedelics you are feeling on day 3.<br /><br />have fun dude 8)

				I am going to Ultra too! The cross-tolerance of 2C-B and LSD is killin&#039; me, but I think I have a pretty reasonable plan. Thursday at A&amp;B I plan to just do 2C-B, Friday at Ultra I am rolling, Saturday I&#039;m taking the day off (aka, drinking), and Sunday I plan to candyflip. I&#039;m hoping the 3 days between psychedelic use and 2 days between MDMA helps prevent some of the tolerance issues..I know I am going to have to take more LSD and MDMA the second time to achieve decent results. Also weed throughout the entire weekend :)<br /><br />I&#039;m probably going to carry them tucked into my briefs.. Any given day I won&#039;t be carrying more than a couple capsules and maybe a joint or two so I&#039;m not too worried about getting nailed.

				Not to sure on the order to take things I&#039;m afraid, I normally just eat it all randomly and see what happens!! But I can help you with taking stuff in. If there&#039;s going to be sniffer dogs I suggest wrapping it in clingfilm, then a condom and finally putting it in a tub of hair gel or Vaseline. I used to work with a doorman and he told me that dogs can&#039;t smell through Vaseline or hair gel. I&#039;ve walked straight past sniffer dogs on several occasions with large amounts of E and Mdma and they haven&#039;t noticed! It&#039;s a good feeling haha Behind the ballsack or safety pinned to the boxers is another good method as festival security won&#039;t search there! Hope this helps.

				I doubt they&#039;ll let you bring brownies or soda in, as usually these things don&#039;t allow food in. <br />But even if they did, I think the brownies are kind of cliche and they would definitely be suspected<br /><br />If you&#039;re a chick, there&#039;s all sorts if tricks you can do with make-up containers to disguise small amounts of drugs. <br />My favorite is taking a tube of lipstick and cutting off half, putting the substance down the tube and then replacing the top of the lipstick. Brilliant! I&#039;ve cut a little slit in&nbsp; &quot;scrunchie&quot;, put a baggie in there, safety pinned it, wrapped it around my hair....and there ya go.

				bring tons of mdma and mda, you will be set, easier to hide too. <br /><br />bringing 2cb and some mushrooms is always good. the more you can hide the better!<br /><br />festivals are awesome and if you have a massive amount of molly you can trade for just about anything :)

				Make it all look like food!<br />Any powder can go into salt/seasoning containers. Just make sure you have something to put the seasoning on so you&#039;re not like &quot;ALL I&#039;M EATING IS GOYA THIS WEEKEND!&quot; At wakarusa last year the guy behind me had a salt thing full of K.

The next day I just 5 galindoi caps and 30mg AMT and 1300mg Aniracetam and I had one hell of a time. I was dancing for a good 4 hours. Glad I didn&#039;t take any MDMA (it was very tempting since it was in my wallet) because I had very little comedown from the AMT and was able to dance for so long.<br /><br />Mt Eden(my personal fav), Benga/Skream, 12th Planet+Skrillex, Flux Pavillion+Doctor P FUCKING KILLED IT.<br /><br />Avicii on the other hand was complete and absolute rubbish.

				You can wrap up weed well and put in some suntan oil or shampoo or shower gel. Handy if you see some sniffer dogs at the train station or gate.

				I&#039;m pretty &quot;straight&quot; looking, if I was a bit beefier I could see some folks mistaking me for a cop...&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to hundreds of concerts and many, many multi-day festivals.&nbsp; To be honest at most festivals the pat down to the concert area is lighthearted and mainly to keep glass bottles out.&nbsp; For say outdoor amphitheater shows I usually &quot;sock&quot; it if I have shoes/socks on, tape baggie to inner thigh.&nbsp; If you need a mule to get a lot of things you can do a tag team, get the most sober respectable looking person to carry and have another guy play drunk buddy role, he goes through all amped up happy drunk, high fiving staff, you follow as the guy who&#039;s looking after him, typically your pat down will be weak.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you looked fucked up well, let me hold your drugs, I&#039;ll get them in for you.&nbsp; I&#039;m about 90% on those flat fifths of rum, I turn em upside down, stick in my waistband in the back with the top (bottom of bottle) flush with top of waistband, a lot of times they don&#039;t pat that far.&nbsp; Once or twice they actually felt it and just waved me on.&nbsp; Sometimes they make guys lift shirt and twirl around, do it quick and with flourish.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got 20 chinese flying lanterns into watkins glen, granted they were really looking too hard.&nbsp; I saw a nitrous tank inside the venue at the first bonnaroo, that shit was crazy.... Fuckers walking aimlessly with big bags of molly, taking hits off a big fucking survival knife edge, me I ate a fuck load of praders pulled pork sandwiches.<br /><br />Shit now I&#039;m rambling.....<br /><br />Oh yeah boys you can do the lipstick thing with chapstick, I&#039;ve never done it but I carry chapstick 24/7 never had it checked.

				Should&#039;ve bought some of my MindFood pills; the first time I tested them I went to a 3 day festival throughout which I was consuming psychedelics and mindfoods but virtually no food, and by the end of it my feet were wrecked but my mind felt as if I&#039;d just taken a nap. <br />At the very least get a bunch of vitamin c/flavonoid pills, and take them often. As for drugs bring them all in and figure out what to take once you&#039;re there.

Plus I eat like 2400mg gabapentin every 4-6hrs,couple hundred mgs caffeine every few hrs,low doses of dxm every few hrs.

				Firstly, an easy way to bring drugs is to pitch your tent before hand and put your stash in the tent pockets and pack it back up, they&#039;ll never assemble your tent to find your drugs (we got a lot of mdma/scales/caps/opiates) in that way. Or just put them on your person in &quot;discreet locations&quot;. <br /><br />I did some very potent LSD at a festival in Ontario and I have to say it was a cross between Louis-Ferdinand Celine&#039;s Journey to the End of the Night and Soluble Fish by Breton. What happened you might ask? Well it was something like hell on earth, in a good way; there was an awareness of the absurdity of the human condition, as I stood amidst a sea of tents soaked in urine, vomit, rain, and mud the irrational extremes of hedonism I was witnessing assumed Apollonian features. People fornicated in the mud, danced in the rain, but their willingness to forgo rationalism and temperance showed no becoming will. Where there could have been a will to life there was only the will to anesthetization and thus a subversion of anything esoteric, individualist, or self-affirming. For the week after that every bird song, circular saw, and dump truck sounded like drum n bass.

				Though it is very easy to bring things into a festival either in a tent or on your person. You might like to consider people will be selling drugs at the festival. As long as you dont look like a cop and go around talking to people in a friendly manner people will offer you anything and everything. People will just walk around muttering offers of whatever you need under their breath.
