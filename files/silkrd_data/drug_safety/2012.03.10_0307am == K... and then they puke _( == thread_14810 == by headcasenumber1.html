				Years ago I tried some K, I don&#039;t remember it being all to crazy, yet I had some extra BC and figured I&#039;d snag some from SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;It arrived today, yet now I&#039;m reading reports on Erowid and almost every one goes like this... <br /><br />- I dosed.<br />- I started feeling weird.<br />- I threw up all over the place.<br />- It sucked.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t sound like much fun, particularly because I am VERY afraid of vomiting as I haven&#039;t since I was a child.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gathered that this response is very much dose specific.&nbsp; I have a mg electronic scale, so I can control dosage, yet I&#039;m still a bit concerned.&nbsp; As much as I know everyone is different, is there a rather safe dosage if I&#039;m not seeking a K-Hole experience, rather just a bit of goofy fun...?&nbsp; Like 10MG?&nbsp; Or would you start with 5, is 5 ever worth it?&nbsp; Kinda bummed out as I should have read more before I ordered this particular substance considering my phobia.&nbsp; I have a box of Zophran at my disposal, perhaps a pre-load is in order?<br /><br />Your words of wisdom are appreciated!

				Keep in mind the quality of drugs is too variable to&nbsp; apply to Erowid experiences.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first times I did K I had nausea to the max, and refused to do it ever again.&nbsp; My second round of K came from SR, it was 100%a quality., and no nausea that I always had with K locally.

				Thanks for the feedback thus far, I think I&#039;m gonna start off low, like 10mg and increase if I&#039;m not feeling anything.&nbsp; I got the stuff from one of the top vendors, so I expect that it will be top quality.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post in the thread once I&#039;ve had a chance to give it a go.

				Weird.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had nausea from K.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only done it a handful of times, and the most I ever took was about 80mg.&nbsp; I swallow the drip, but I don&#039;t drink on it.&nbsp; It&#039;s enough of a(n awesome) mindfuck on its own!

That was more of it stays in your nose as opposed to dripping. There&#039;ll be a drip no matter what, but I didn&#039;t think it tasted too bad, personally.

				Snorting K wasn&#039;t bad for me...Not one of my favorites. But it was the time I Iv&#039;d it I quit and just flushed the rest down the toilet. I could literally feel it surging straight into my head like my blood brain barrier just shattered like the controlled demolition of a giant river dam. Don&#039;t remember a damn thing after that but no thanks I&#039;ll pass next time :P
