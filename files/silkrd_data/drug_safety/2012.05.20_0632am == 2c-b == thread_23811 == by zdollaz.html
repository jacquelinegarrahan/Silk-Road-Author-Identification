				i recieved 50 mg of it today, and split it into two. took one 25 mg capsule and nothing after 2 hours. so i took the remaining 25 mg and split it into two lines for snorting, after the first one did nothing (i waited a half an hour between the two) the second one burned a bit more but nothing happened other than the pain. how long should i have to wait? i think i just got bunk 2c-b. care to comment?

				2c-b shouldn&#039;t take that long nor should you need that much. 10mg is fun, 20mg is a trip. Buy from Ivory on SR, TOP NOTCH 2C-B, put it in a cap and swallow.

				Who was the 2C-B from? I&#039;ve hear good things about Ivory and generalm3sS.<br /><br />Probably bunk, 50mg is way too much, 2C-B has a steep dosing gradient, 5mg can make all the difference.<br />Redosing after unexpected results is not advisable though, as if both kick in at once, well, you&#039;re in for a ride.<br /><br />Got some bees from generalm3sS coming soon. Quality vendor, extended an offer because I couldn&#039;t get my shit together in time.

				I guess i should say, this post is rather invalid haha, because it DID kick in, and it was one of the best experiences of my life entirely.&nbsp; It was magical, it was, undescribably amazing really haha. I&#039;m not sure why it took so long to kick in, and i didn&#039;t weigh the dose, it was a free sample claimed to be 50mg. I assumed it was, but eyeballing a new substance is as we all know, impossible. so i may have had a much lower dose then i reported, but yeah when it hit, IT HIT. it was greeeeat :) i need me some more bees :D

				Unfortunately it was my first experience with 2c-b and i guess that might be why it was so profound, when it did happen that is. I did do my research beforehand, and did expect a more painful burning, and a much faster onset but i cant complain, I had a great time!

				2CB hurts like fuck to snort, but if you must do so, you need to take it in real soft and hold just inside your nostril - if you do the big hollywood coke snort, you&#039;ll lose half of it (and it will really really hurt).<br /><br />Better to put in a cap and drop (though it takes a long time to kick in) or shelve it.<br /><br />50mg is standard dose for me in a cap.&nbsp; Have gone higher but its a waste.

				shit really? that bad? wow, that must have been intense for you. I&#039;ve never had a bad trip per se, except ONE time when i got laced bud, friggin PCP scared the shit out of me. i thought i was on fire, and heard like this awful sound the entire time, it sounded like a million babies crying as loud as they could, like they were being burned alive. it was soo messed up. but then my dealer said he was sorry, he mixed up the shit and i got a free 1/8th of shrooms, which are one of my favorite drugs ever! but i think 2c-b has the lead for now, then DXM, then Shrooms, then adderall. idk what comes after that, what&#039;s your guys&#039;s favorite drugs? and why?

				yeah it was a really intense come up and a nasty body load, just really didn&#039;t enjoy it. tried it a couple of weeks later after doing 200mg MDMA and that was a much better body load but still had a nasty trip. just not for me i don&#039;t think.<br /><br />love the coke for when i&#039;m down the pub, just makes me captain sociable. when its good coke anyway<br /><br />love the e&#039;s when i&#039;m chilling at home with some good tunes, and then the hash because it brings out the best in a pill.<br /><br />like a valium for coming down the day after a pill<br /><br />big fan of K as well, again for chilling at home.<br /><br />hate speed, just makes me really jittery and i hate tweaking. <br /><br />like H but it nearly took over my life so not doing that any more.

				see, opiates and i never really got along. I have to take HUGE amounts just to get a buzz, and that damn itch almost makes it not worth it, however i think i secretly like the itch because it feels sooo good to scratch haha. but yeah, with no tolerance at all, i have to take like 40-50mg vicodin to just get a mild buzz, where that&#039;s a toxic dose of tylenol! i have to CWE just so i can safely use vicodin, so im not that big a fan of them. i just recently got 2 bottles of oxyfast in my hands, sorta by accident, but that can get the job done, it&#039;s just a hassle cuz i get stomach issues with high doses of oxy. but i am in line to get a sample of a new dealers opium, he said he&#039;d send me some so let&#039;s hope that has some effect, or im giving up on opiates in general haha

				Hey peoples<br /><br />I&#039;ve been experimenting with 2C-B after reading Alexander Shulgin&#039;s Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story (Great book btw made by the guy who invented 2C-B)<br /><br />This is my second 2C-B trip both times using 1x 18-20mg 2C-B Cap. (Still in the middle of my trip as of this post)<br /><br />It&#039;s so strange it doesn&#039;t feel like MDMA or LSD alone. (A very slight mix of both?)<br /><br />I just don&#039;t know what to make of 2C-B odd visuals strange emotions and a warm tingly rush of energy through my whole body with an almost pin and needle feel in my hands I feel very warm. <br /><br />But yet I find all my cognitive functions strangely intact like my mind is baseline all the way.<br /><br />Sry peoples I guess I&#039;m starting to ramble here. I just wanted to ask what other peoples personal experiences with this chemical compound have been like.<br /><br />Also on my third trip I have been thinking about taking 2x 18-20mg 2C-B Cap. But I keep wondering if the does might be a bit to high.<br /><br />If anyone has ever taken a 35-40 mg dose I&#039;d like to hear your experiences with it.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				Kapacino, I have heard of taking a dose of like 20mg of 2c-b right at the tail end of your comedown of E, and that&#039;s supposed to be incredible, but i haven&#039;t heard of acid and 2c-b together, I&#039;m sure it would be kick ass tho! I&#039;m not well versed in acid, however due to the lack of it in my area. But thanks to the magical silk road, i now have access to it! but it is kinda expensive on here, compared to the prices i get when it does come around. i get it for like 7-8 a tab, which is relatively cheap to my understanding. but yeah, i&#039;ll definitely put the combo on my to do list, thanks for the suggestion haha

				Was using 0.001g scales, but they weren&#039;t mine so I dunno if they&#039;d been dropped or bashed a bit or whatnot. Still - tried it, that&#039;s enough 4 me, move on to the next thing. Working my way thru what the Road has to offer :)

Looks like you snorted it though?? Anyways. Good way to swallow (tip was taken from a MOD on here or another site-dont remember) Weigh dose, put in capsule, poke hole in the end to allow fluid to enter faster and dissolve cap and absorb faster. ORRRR , weigh, put in cap--but when ready to eat take the top off the cap and swallow bottom full of the product. Should be 45 min onset or a bit more, of course depending on whats in your stomach. I always fast for 5 hours or so before swallowing some&nbsp; goodies. Hope this helps someone.

				I just had my first 2C-B experience thanks to gammagoblin. Took 20mg, and had a great time. <br /><br />My preferred ROA for all the PEAs I&#039;ve tried so far: clean off your weighing tray, weigh out your dose, pour a little bit of OJ into a small glass or clean prescription bottle, pour the powder from the tray into the OJ, mix and drink. Then rinse your tray off with OJ, letting that liquid fall back into your glass/bottle, add a little more OJ, stir it up again to make sure you get any lingering powder, drink the rest of that juice, and you&#039;re good to go in about 45 minutes. I like to lick my measuring spatula before stirring to taste the chemical first (after brushing the majority of excess powder back into the storage container), but that part&#039;s up to you. ;)<br /><br />20mg was great for my first time, but next time I&#039;ll be taking 25mg. I&#039;m glad I have some 2C-B, since I can&#039;t seem to find an active dose of 2C-T-7 yet. Maybe I&#039;m just being a pussy about dosing. :P

				<br />Just another shout out for Ivory&#039;s 2C-B. Swallowed 10mg tonight and had a delicious time!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;60 min come up, still getting stronger after 2 hrs. nice plateau. slow taper off. 4-5 hours total.<br /><br />Slight visuals with just 10mg, wonderful body high like rolling but not. Pupils dialated-details crawling on different inanimate objects. Clear head.....everything was fun and funny. <br /><br />Will be ordering again.<br />

				Yeah, 2cb does make it a little hard to go to sleep on the comedown. At least it&#039;s not as long in duration as a lot of other psychedelics though!

I haven&#039;t used it right before bed or anything, but after using it about half a dozen times it hasn&#039;t even been an issue to fall asleep after the effects have worn off. I&#039;m very sensitive to stimulants and have a hard time sleeping. This is why 2C-B is one of my favorites. Completely back to baseline when the half-life is over. Great stuff.

				Ordered some caps to take in a few weeks, any preparations I should do before like not eat for a few hours before or to do with surroundings? I&#039;ve only done weed and salvia before so I&#039;m taking 20mg in pill form. I would appreciate any tips that can make this as good as possible.&nbsp; :)

				Just placed an order for some 2C-B.&nbsp; I&#039;m so excited to try this compound!&nbsp; I had 2C-I once (20 mg), but was rather underwhelmed, possibly because of a tolerance from taking NBOMe a week before.&nbsp; Still prefer 25i, though.&nbsp; 2C-I seemed way weaker and had a horrendous body load that lasted way past baseline.&nbsp; I&#039;m rolling on some Defcons for the first time pretty soon, and plan on dropping 20-30mg of 2C-B once my roll tapers off.&nbsp; Ahhhh.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Lost patience and took 2C-B from generalm3sS. Specified as 18-20mg, personally I don&#039;t feel the need to try a higher dose, partly because the effects were pleasant enough, and partly because of the way it unsettles the stomach on the onset, which was quite dramatic the first time.<br /><br />Weirdly the first time I had it I was alone, and felt what I later learned to be mild effects. The second time was with a friend and the effects were far more pronounced, despite any tolerance (4 days after initial), with very noticeable auditory effects, and it lasted longer.<br /><br />Just wondering people do to counteract the sickness on the onset, as both times I had an empty stomach, as I thought this would help?
