				The more that I use SR the more I realize that it protects the sellers more than anyone else.&nbsp; As buyers we are still giving out our physical address, and although I want to re-sell in my local area that would create some loose ends because I&#039;d be meeting people in person.<br /><br />I live in the United States and it seems most large vendors don&#039;t sell out of the US, in fact many might just be re-selling stuff that they ordered from elsewhere (and re-selling into the US for an increased price).&nbsp; I have gotten a bit curious though:<br /><br />For MDMA do you think that the majority of vendors are also chemists?&nbsp; Or do you think they have a friend that is a chemist?&nbsp; Because from what I have gathered it seems that MDMA cannot be safely synthesized on a regular basis by someone without a college chemistry degree.&nbsp; It would be nice if I had a chemist friend who wanted to make some money and sell within the US but alas I do not have a chemist friend like this.&nbsp; Do you think it is even possible to seek out and find a chemist in my area who is interested in doing this without raising suspicion?&nbsp; I suppose it might have to be something that just kinda &quot;falls in your lap&quot; so to speak, right?

				No the majority of vendors here are not chemists, in fact I would be very surprised if even one of the major MDMA vendors was a chemist. The only one I&#039;ve ever though seriously could have been was SKYY but he&#039;s obviously not here.<br /><br />Also you are drastically underestimating the what it takes to undertake clandestine production, believe me it&#039;s not something that just &quot;Falls into one&#039;s lap&quot; it&#039;s something you have to take years of dedication to get to searching for the right contacts. <br /><br />I dunno why but I keep seeing threads like this popping up lately assuming that making drugs is easy as fuck when it bloody well isn&#039;t and it&#039;s extremely naive to think so.

Also I passed the tech he gave me on to my chemists and they verified it and it saved them a lot of work. I think people just get a bit wary of him because he appears to charge a lot for his techs/consults but actually, in my opinion based on what he&#039;s given me so far the guy should charge a fuck of a lot more. For what he gives you the price is next to nothin. <br /><br />So yeah in short if you are serious go for it, you&#039;ll be in safe hands. :)

				It&#039;s pretty basic networking and relationships. Think of how meeting a chemist would happen organically. The most common way something like this would come about is in college/university probably over 75% of connections made drug chemists at least in the US happen at school. Other than that if you hang around other people who use mdma or some other drugs chances are at least one of those people knows a chemist whether they are good friends are distanced acquaintances. If you really want to meet somebody it&#039;s not as hard as you might think.

				The MUCH more difficult problem than finding a chemist is figuring out the supply chain to get your illegal precursors, your equipment, getting a location, etc. Anything reasonably profitable in this industry is going to leave a few loose ends, no matter what. So the problem is finding people you can TRUST (this includes your chemist, your suppliers, your buyers, whatever). Clearly you&#039;re not going to find a chemist and actually get up and running, and if you do, you&#039;ll get caught quickly enough because you don&#039;t really know what you&#039;re doing. <br /><br />I think Christy was joking, but her solution is the most reasonable. Go learn how to make it yourself if you can figure out everything else. That&#039;s one less person that can fuck everything up.

				LOL I think some of you guys are overreacting a little bit here.&nbsp; I am more than aware of how hard MDMA is to synthesize, but I am just curious what the chemists are like that produce it.&nbsp; I mean we see kg&#039;s and kg&#039;s of it being sold on the Silk Road so it&#039;s obviously possible to produce such large amounts.<br /><br />And the more I think about it the more I think a lot of it is either not synthesized in the USA or is synthesized by high level chemists who naturally have access to the precursors (without being flagged wherever they are).&nbsp; The deeper I look into things though it seems that one can make plenty of money without being a chemist, the question is how they launder it correctly.

				So you want to Run a Clandestine Chemical lab at commercial scale? Pt. 1<br /><br />What you need:<br /><br />1. A chemist: The chemist is an easy thing to find if you are one of two things: A chemist yourself, or a college student/professor in a scientific or engineering based field, its also quite easy to find if you run a legitimate chemical company, but then again if you ran one of those why would you be making narcotics?<br /><br />2. A lab: This can be done one of two ways you can either piggyback off of an existing lab - (see the college/own chemical company thing) or you can make your own. Making your own lab requires a few months, about 5-100k for the construction, venting, lighting, electrical, generators, air conditioning, refrigeration, etc. depending on how large of a lab you want, then add in another 1k for glassware, scales, tools, cleaning tools, etc and then add another thousand or so for your start up chemicals assuming you are starting with a small batch. for a small lab make sure you have about 10 grand on hand. If you want to be some regional kingpin consider investing more in the range of 250k-1mil<br /><br />3. Reliable precursor: This can be obtained three ways, getting it from smugglers, set yourself up some shady contacts in India or China who will mislabel some barrels for you, then have a crew steal them off the ships when it arrives. Piggyback off an existing company (see: madrigal from BB). Or use underworld connections to get it for you I&#039;m sure limitless would be able to help you in that regard&nbsp; :P.<br />I mean there is always stealing it... but come on... you don&#039;t really want 10 years before you even start cooking do you?<br /><br />4. Distribution: you need to network dealers, or have the rave scene backing your shit so you can push off your product as soon as its made. No cash flow = no production.<br /><br />Now chances are that by this point you have realized that you are completely out of your depth and will give up. If you read this guide and the idea still fascinates you well then your in luck, because chances are even if you do get caught no charges will stick to you you can afford a small army of lawyers to keep your ass out of jail and have the sense to not get popped yourself. You aren&#039;t (at least legally) manufacturing the product, someone else is. You aren&#039;t selling the product, someone else is. You aren&#039;t smuggling, someone else is. All you fall in the guilty category for is criminal conspiracy and even then they&#039;ll have a hard time pinching you if you kept your money trail clean, and your labs cleaner.<br />&nbsp;
