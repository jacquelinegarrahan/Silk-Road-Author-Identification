				Whangarei legal high outlets say e-Cigarettes containing synthetic cannabis could be the future of the industry in the face of new legislation aimed to combat the effects.<br /><br />The Psychoactive Substances Bill is expected to pass its third and final reading this Thursday and become law the week after.<br /><br />It will see all legal highs removed from dairies and non-specialist shops and ban the sale to, and possession and consumption by, people aged under 18.<br /><br />The law will also force manufacturers to prove their products are safe and list all ingredients on the label, and gives councils new powers to restrict sales in their communities.<br /><br />The owner of the Brew Store, a vendor of legal highs, says he understands manufacturers have conducted focus groups and are ready to put out new products once the bill is passed.<br /><br />The man, who did not want to be named, said he is confident he can shift the stock he has before the bill outlaws them.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re not going to have a fire sale, we won&#039;t do anything silly like that.&quot;<br /><br /><br />He said he never keeps a huge amount of stock, as it could tempt thieves.<br /><br />His shop would be classified as a specialist store under the legislation, and he would ensure it complied with the new law that the stock would not be visible from the entrance.<br /><br />Another retailer in Whangarei, who also did not wish to be named, said he would also be applying for a licence to sell.<br /><br />They had both heard that e-Cigarettes for synthetic cannabis are in the making and could be on the shelves after the bill has passed.<br /><br />The Ministry of Health was working with police to develop a system allowing retailers to safely dispose of leftover stock.<br /><br />Retailers who flagrantly flouted the new law could be handed prison sentences or fines of up to $500,000.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Whangarei police believe a man they arrested for allegedly smashing a ranch slider at his home while they attended a nearby house on an unrelated matter was high on synthetic cannabis.<br /><br />Sergeant Howard Clement said police went to an address in Otangarei about 8.55pm on Sunday June 30 to speak to a resident.<br /><br />However, Mr Clement said, as police were at the address a man from a nearby home was observed extremely intoxicated and yelling abuse at Black Power gang members.<br /><br />The man was repeatedly opening and closing a ranchslider at his home with such force that it smashed.<br /><br />Mr Clement said the man then picked up the ranchslider and threw it on to the floor.<br /><br />A 41-year-old was arrested and charged with intentional damage. Mr Clement said synthetic cannabis was found and police believe the man was under the influence of the legal high.
