				It varies from person to person how quickly you body metabolises drugs. it takes 3 days for pretty much every drug to no longer be detectable, psychedelics are active at such low doses that it&#039;s useless testing for them. THC is fat soluble, if you&#039;re a heavy smoker it could take upto 28 days , although there are instances of positive results after 28 days.<br />Exercise and drink lots of water, the day of the test drink shit loads of water and flush your bladder as many times as possible.

				You need help passing&nbsp; a drug test, I know how to do it.. If It&#039;s a piss you will never flunk again.&nbsp; And you can do any drug the night before and still pass, even 4 hours before but don&#039;t do it the day of the test.&nbsp; Let me know I&#039;ll Pm you the instructions,&nbsp; this is because some of those labcorps might see it and you know.&nbsp; Let me know in the next 10 min or so..&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to be on that&nbsp; long.&nbsp; I did like 10 times already and smoked mad weed the night before and passed everytime.

				Nothing like that works, nothing from GNC the stuff on the internet works..&nbsp; This stuff I found about some from guy a long time ago is not made for drug tests.&nbsp; But the way the body reacts to this stuff will block out anything guranteed for 3 hours or so.&nbsp; Man I&#039;m not putting you on its like 4 bucks thats it.&nbsp; But I guess thjis gut don&#039;t believe me, so thats kool.

				Clearnet wasn&#039;t all that helpful?<br />Sorry to repost this:<br />hxxp://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/testing/testing_info1.shtml<br /><br />If you look for ARUP Labs, they also have excellent information but may be more detail than you want.<br /><br />&quot;Pissing in a cup for work&quot; varies depending on your work. Some jobs just do a standard 5 panel dip with high thresholds. Some run a 9 panel dip with varying thresholds. Some run a specialized panel with EVERYTHING confirmed by MS. Depends on your work or situation. <br /><br />For the ones you mentioned, assuming 9 panel, standard immunoassay:<br />- Ecstasy: 3-4 days, and can be false positived by a very high methamphetamine level as well<br />- Meth: 4 days, acidifying your urine will result in much faster clearance. You will come up positive for amphetamine as well. There&#039;s a thread on here somewhere about methamphetamine/amphetamine testing that has more detail than you might want on the topic - go to main forum page and search for &quot;methamphetamine testing isomers&quot; and I bet it&#039;ll come up.<br />- Oxycontin / opiates: Oxycodone/morphone and &quot;opiates&quot; are not created equal. Gender, other drugs, and genetics influence this. See the Erowid page.<br />- LSD: They aren&#039;t testing for this on a work panel unless you have a weird-ass job. Need to be looking for it.<br />- 25i: They aren&#039;t testing for this on a work panel unless you have a weird-ass job. Need to be looking for it.<br /><br />Synthetic urine: fine and dandy unless your lab is smart enough to look for the occasional white cell, etc., which should be present. Not 100%.<br /><br />The blocking/interfering agents will give usually a conflicting result (such as positive immunoassay/negative confirmation). Not the same thing as a negative, at all. But maybe DD has a magic thing, I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Try to ignore the people who are being mean, good luck at work.<br />

				it varies as each person is different than others.<br />the faster your metabolism is, the faster it is out of your system.<br />I remember this one time when i smoked some weed out of a bong,&nbsp; popped some percocets, had half a xanax bar and did a tiny bit of coke.&#039;<br />The next morning they surprised me and asked me to pee in a cup. Benzos, opiates, and THC&nbsp; showed up negative but I showed up positive for coke.<br />Just goes to show how unreliable drug tests are..

				My technigye will work for any drug type of Drug Test.. the promblem with my tecnique you need about couple hours to do the whole thing tl you take the drugtest.. So this tecqunique works the best for preemploymnent.. I mean if its by the court.&nbsp; Do you have time to do it.&nbsp; I mean it wll pass that test.&nbsp; This tecniques is not really made to be put in your body.. Need to know how much to take because it can kill you if you take more than needed.&nbsp; Yhe needed amount is more than then good enough.&nbsp; IYs not pretty but you got&nbsp; suffer a little.&nbsp; Try to sell it but if somebody dies or gets injured you know.&nbsp; If you do it right there should be no issues but it could happe.
