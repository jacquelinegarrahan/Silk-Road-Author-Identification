				Well I can say most weed dealers on SR are fucking phenomenal. To list a few; <br /><br />Listentothemusic - is amazing in varieties of strains, and has really good shipping within the US. <br />Anarcho - is pretty much famous for his prices on Jack Herer, one of my favorites. <br />MilehighMedicine - a newbie, but has a lot of great strains I am loving. <br />TimeTraveler - oh gawd the strains he has, I want them all...<br />CannaGirl - oh I think her boobs are amazing...uhh, oh right great strains, I&#039;ve tried the Skywalker...fucking godly. <br />MrOuid - this fucking guy is always stocked, and has the high teir baddies, hes awesome. <br /><br />I wanna try godofall&#039;s TNT strain, and LexiSadie&#039;s planetary strains, maybe next week... :)<br /><br />But overall those are the few of the really good ones I&#039;ve ordered from. Good luck. <br />

				You&#039;ve seen Cannagrrl&#039;s boobs?&nbsp; Are they awesome?<br /><br />I might be coming into this a bit biased, but I would put my HempStar that I just got in a few days ago against pretty much anything on this site.&nbsp; And, for it&#039;s being a AAA kush AND 100% sativa strain, it&#039;s about the cheapest you are going to find in a AAA kush on SR.<br /><br />Or you could do a mixed bag with herrer and hempstar, or if you are an indica fan I have Freezeland which cannot be beaten for potentcy:price on here.

				Just wanted to second Anarcho&#039;s claim about Freezeland, first time I vaped it and it kicked my ass pretty hardcore! I am a bit confused how a Kush can be a pure sativa, I thought Kush = indica from some ancestor in Afghanistan?

				Magic, you are correct.<br /><br />Kush is just a slang term in a lot of Canada for incredible fucking weed.&nbsp; Usually it&#039;s 100% afghani or purple or lemon, but anything AAA+ grade that fucks you up beyond AA mid or the usual Canadian fare is called &quot;kush&quot;.&nbsp; So when I say &quot;kush&quot; I mean it in the local slang way - that it&#039;s insane, probably 3 times the potency of that freezeland of mine you had.<br /><br />Good catch, though ;)
