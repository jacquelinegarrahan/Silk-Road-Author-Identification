				Saw this on bluelight. http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/604448-Dark-Chocolate-must-potentiate-mdma-in-some-way-shape-or-form.-This-isnt-a-repost.<br />Apparently dark chocolate potentiates MDMA in some way. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been eating Cacao nibs for the past two days and planning to roll on Saturday! Let&#039;s see if this works or not..

				I don&#039;t know the specifics of chocolate chemistry, but it wouldn&#039;t surprise me, I guess? Good luck. Come back with a sea of knowledge for us.<br /><br />I might give this a try too next time I get some molly. Sounds interesting.

				dark chocolate apparently contains some MAOI&#039;s, this probably is your &#039;active ingredient&#039;<br /><br />70% darkness or higher recommended, or go hardcore mode and eat 90% unsweetened!

				Chocolate&#039;s been proven to make the average person happy if I&#039;m not mistaken. Something related to increasing dopamine production or something.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard drinking or eating anything Mango really helps with Marijuana too. I wonder if that&#039;s true as well? :o

				monoamine oxidase degrades the neurotransmitters serotonin, norep, ep and dopamine and is in chocolate as someone mentioned, so it may VERY slightly raise levels but I kinda doubt it unless you eat a ton... <br /><br />also I eat mango and drink the fresh juice frequently and have never noticed an alteration on my daily cannabinoid consumption effect. i think its mostly placebo if anything

				Probably more like the effects of the theobromine and caffeine in the chocolate are synergistic with MDMA.&nbsp; Theobromine works on dopamine.<br /><br />There is no clear evidence that chocolate contains MAOIs, more likely that people confuse the fact that it is possible that eating chocolate whilst taking MAOIs can cause issues.&nbsp; Even this is debated now.<br /><br />Drink some grapefruit juice (another unproven potentiator) and eat some chocolate, or even better &quot;choocamine&quot; and see how you go.<br /><br />With the prices here on SR being so good (relative to Australian prices anyway) the best potentiator would be more MDMA - initially or an hour or so after drop.&nbsp; :)<br />

				I understand that in addition to being a very mild MAOI, chocolate contains a good amount of PEA. PEA is of course inactive due to how quickly it is metabolized, but maybe your MAO must work at breaking down both the PEA and MDMA simultaneously, slowing the MDMA breakdown? Good luck!<br />
