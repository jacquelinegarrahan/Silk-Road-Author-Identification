				basically I have been taking diazepam daily for a year or so, around a month ago I came off them reducing to 2mg daily, <br /><br />but for the last 2 weeks I have been taking them again, only in smaller amounts up to 10mg a day, and have for the last week reduced down again, I took my last 2mg last night.<br /><br />now I have a bit of H, only standard UK no3, which I want to smoke, I haven&#039;t smoked any gear for over a year so have no opiate tolerance at the moment<br /><br />how long would you leave it before deciding to smoke gear?<br /><br />&nbsp;as I say my last 2mg of diaz was 24 hours ago, I&#039;m just a bit worried about using gear with benzos in my system, and the fact diaz stays in your body so long compared to other benzos.<br /><br />any advice would be much appreciated<br /><br />thanks.

				I don&#039;t think the half life of a drug is nearly as important as the peak serum level when considering the contraindications of combining two drugs.&nbsp; And since your&#039;e smoking, it&#039;s even less critical than if you were going to IV it.&nbsp; The exception could be combining oral methadone and benzos, simply because it takes a while for peak serum levels to be reached with methadone, and both have very long half-lives.&nbsp; People &quot;abusing&quot; oral methadone often end up taking more and more until they feel the effects, which will continue to build even after the last does is taken.&nbsp; Combine with a quantity of benzos, and you could just stop breathing.<br /><br />Take a toke and see how you feel.&nbsp; Wait a few minutes.&nbsp; Want to get higher?&nbsp; Hit it again, and wait a few minutes.&nbsp; Rinse and repeat.&nbsp; Smoking will hit you pretty fast, you&#039;ll know when to stop.<br /><br />Any residual diazepam from 24 hours ago isn&#039;t anything to worry about.&nbsp; Always take it slow, and you&#039;ll have little to fear.

				Be careful with these two. Last year when I was still using, I spent 20 hours unconscious from slamming dope and taking Valium. Heroin seems to strongly potentiate the effects of Valium.
