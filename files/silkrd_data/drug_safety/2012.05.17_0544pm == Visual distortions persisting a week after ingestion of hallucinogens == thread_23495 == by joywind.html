				I have been taking LSD, research chemicals sold to me as LSD, and magic mushrooms almost every day for the past few months. I have been taking both high doses on my days off and microdosing while at work.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t ingested any of these substances for the past 7 days, and I am still seeing trails following objects in motion, patterns on walls and carpets, etc. <br /><br />Is that normal? How long dies it take for this to go away?

				You been doing it every day for the past few months? Wow! It could be a few more weeks before you feel normal. Flashbacks can occur for years after being straight. One vendors profile says to take 7 days in between researching. <br /><br />I would recommend you play it safe for a few weeks. I did some acid once and before it was finally over I was preying to be straight. What if you get stuck like that? At least you&#039;d be able to sign up for a crazy check hahaha, but all jokes aside, it&#039;s serious business taking psychedelics

				Damn son. Tripping every day will seriously fuck you up and turn you into a weirdo. Wouldn&#039;t recommend it. Sounds like you overdid it. I&#039;d say off the drugs, and if you must do psychedelics, save them for the weekend... In your case I&#039;d lay off of every drug for a while, make sure to eat healthy and sleep, and exercise...

				If by &quot;research chemicals sold to me as LSD&quot; you mean 25i-NBOMe, damn, dude.&nbsp; That shit is potent as fuck, and definitely something you shouldn&#039;t take everyday, or even weekly.&nbsp; After doing 25i four times in a two-week span, I had visual distortions that lasted for almost three weeks (probably because I kept smoking weed).&nbsp; If you are smoking weed, try and stop and see if that has any effect.&nbsp; If you smoked during any of your trips, I believe it can activate that memory of tripping and bring out the visuals more.&nbsp; Also, cease all hallucinogenic drug use, exercise, drink lots of water, take some 5-HTP and Vitamin C, eat as healthy as possible, and get good sleep.&nbsp; More drugs, a poor diet, and sleep deprivation will exacerbate HPPD symptoms.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible these visual distortions will be permanent, but even if they aren&#039;t, take this as a lesson and treat psychs with respect in the future.

				If you have been taking hallucinogens daily for months, it&#039;s amazing you can still tell the difference between a &#039;normal&#039; figure and a &#039;distorted&#039; one.

				OP just take it easy, eat well, and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />I had a two month period where I took LSD, 2c-p, 5-meo-mipt, mushrooms, DMT and 4-aco-dipt around 3-4 times a week, sometimes mixed.&nbsp; It took about half a year for some of the visual distortions to subside (computer screens, trees and checkered tile floors still sometimes bring out them out slightly).&nbsp; I never noticed any kind of cognitive impairment.

				All of the major hallucinogens works via the same pathways as some of the most major neurotransmitters in the human brain...&nbsp; primarily serotonin, dopamine and glutamate.&nbsp; Your feeling of &quot;well-being&quot; is basically from low dose LSD acting as a literal anti-depressant of the SNRI class.<br /><br />Be careful...&nbsp; you have to give your brain a break from these things otherwise you can risk really throwing things out of whack.&nbsp; If you keep introducing external sources of these neurotransmitters your body will eventually produce less and less of them, and that can turn into a horrible withdrawal.<br /><br />Low serotonin levels lead to a down in the dumps feeling...&nbsp; clinically low serotonin can lead to clinical depression.<br /><br />Low dopamine levels can lead to some serious compulsive issues and generally inappropriate behavior.&nbsp; &nbsp;clinically low dopamine levels can lead to chronic anxiety issues and motor control problems resembling Parkinson&#039;s Disease.<br /><br />Low glutamate levels lead to severe memory problems and diffuse cell damage all over the body.&nbsp; It can also contribute to anxiety problems via decreased amounts available for metabolism into GABA which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, and the one that most benzos imitate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Chronically low glutamate levels will pretty much break you...&nbsp; talking the potential to develop some really severe and potentially permanent mental disorders.&nbsp; There are models of schizophrenia that believe low glutamate levels could be a cause...&nbsp; but it is absolutely certain that low glutamate can lead to an extended psychosis and potential PTSD.<br /><br />After one month you won&#039;t have &quot;broken your brain&quot; yet...&nbsp; but you have to learn to treat these drugs with respect... and if you aren&#039;t capable of regulating your intake then you need to find some help and just cut yourself off completely.&nbsp; &nbsp;At the levels and frequency you are dosing it&#039;s a matter of when and not if as far as you eventually wrecking yourself mentally.&nbsp; And once you do, there is no cure... and the only treatments out there can cause some pretty nasty stuff themselves.

				If you detox, you&#039;ll likely be ok in a few days/weeks.<br />I don&#039;t know how you would take so many in so short a time, considering the tolerance of the aforementioned psychs is very pronounced and crosses between substances.&nbsp; What were you eating in the end, like 25 hits of acid in a day, or 12 hits of 25i?

				You&#039;re mind&#039;s perception of &quot;reality&quot; has now become accustomed to the psychadelic mind-set.&nbsp; Just quit taking everything and you&#039;re mind will adjust.&nbsp; If problems persist try taking 50mg of Thorazine PRN (Zyprexa and Seroquel work well, too).&nbsp; Benzos can help with some stress and panic if you experience either.

I&#039;m not sure if everyone sees these but I recognize them as smaller versions of what happens when I&#039;m tripping.<br /><br />It&#039;s like when we were kids, we used to just stare intensely at one spot until the whole background fades away and you&#039;d get a weird vertigo-type feeling. I often get this when I&#039;m having a conversation with someone and look into their eyes for a minute or two.<br /><br />I run a fair bit (do a 15km run most weekends), and play a lot of sports, and when my heart is really going (I have a pulse meter and it&#039;s when I&#039;m at about 90-95% Max HR), I can see the effects of my pulse in my peripheral vision fairly often. Kind of a pulsing change in brightness.<br /><br />Also when I&#039;m running I tend to see colors brighter than normal. Or maybe that&#039;s because I only run outside on nice days along beautiful waterfront tracks.<br /><br />I think I have pretty much always seen visual distortions, a small amount of trippy stuff in grass when it&#039;s moving in the wind, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;ve probably had about 10 trips in my life, a couple of times with mescaline (san pedro), and a few times with shrooms (which was excellent with mdma btw), and probably had mdma 10-20 times.<br /><br />Anyone else also see this stuff when not on drugs? I have a theory that people who&#039;ve never tripped just don&#039;t notice this stuff even though they actually do see it because they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re looking for.

One of the 2Cs were involved, so alcohol would also bring it back. I would recommend you stay way from ALL drugs for a long period of time. Try to space it out a little more.

				I believe HPPD happens when your visual cortex is exposed to the change that psychedelics bring. Depending on the person it may take one trip or 10+ for HPPD to occur. Note that HPPD is considered HPPD when it&#039;s actually distracting and debilitating. Otherwise be thankful and don&#039;t use drugs for awhile. I use to get symptoms close to HPPD, but not to the extent where it was actually annoying for my daily life.

				Professional ping-pong player for one :D<br /><br />Effects like these keep me away from hallucinogens though - taking a drug and experiencing the effect shortly (or for a few days) after is one thing, but overdoing hallucinogens can leave you suffering effects for extended periods of time or even the rest of your life. <br /><br />If its interfering with your normal life even when you stopped taking them for a week or so it may be a good idea to get proper medical care. I don&#039;t think there is that much of a chance of the actual drug or its withdrawal doing direct damage, but that isn&#039;t really required if you simple go mad and jump in front of a bus because you always wondered what those look like from the bottom :D
