				Hello I want to take LSD soon but am on Abilify, 30 mgs, and olanzapine 5mg. I plan to stop taking both for two days. Will this be enough time to get out of my system and not interfere with my trip? Anyone know? I appreciate any suggestions thanks.

				Safest way is to have a loaded gun beside you, spend the day wallowing in depression and self-pity, and to constantly worry you&#039;ll have a bad trip while taking it.<br /><br />On a more serious note, I sincerely doubt they&#039;ll be out of your system in time especially if you&#039;ve taken them a while. They&#039;re both serotonin acting and may diminish your trip.

				LMAO thanks for the info. <br /><br />Loaded .45 : Check<br />Depressed: Check<br />Worrying about having a bad trip: Check<br /><br />Should I keep you updated?? Seriously though maybe giving it a whole week without meds is the way to go? I have been on them awhile but only about two years. Last time I dosed it worked but it was a little weak. I thought it was just weak stuff but maybe it was the meds. Thanks again for the info any more would be much appreciated.

I doubt they&#039;ll be out of your system entirely by then, but they&#039;ll be diminished somewhat.<br /><br />Olanzapine has a half-life of 21-54 hours (one-two days); half of the dose you take will be out of you within that time frame.<br />Abilify&#039;s half-life is closer to three or four days.

I&#039;m also incredibly anxious, and my life had been going pretty downhill before my first acid trip. I had felt miserable the day prior. Perhaps it was irresponsible to do so– Yet, on the day of, I spent the time just being positive and thinking good thoughts- and I had a fantastic first trip, plenty of hours of fun, followed by plenty of therapeutic self-learning– mainly that things weren&#039;t as bad as I had thought.
