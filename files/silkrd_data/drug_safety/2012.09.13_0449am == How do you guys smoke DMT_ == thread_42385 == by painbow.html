				I don&#039;t have a vaporizer and I&#039;m not sure if I want to invest in one yet.<br /><br />I was trying to learn different methods of DMT smoking and I watched this video:&nbsp; *clearnet*&nbsp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtckVptu4I4<br /><br />The last technique he talks about by making a bong out of a empty liter bottle using foil as an enclosure seems like a good method.<br /><br />Has anyone tried this method before?&nbsp; Any other recommendations to this DMT virgin?

				In a bong on top of some kind of smoke-able herb. You can mix it in or just leave it as a pile on top, whatever works for you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tripped on DMT well over 200 times and this is the best method I&#039;ve come across.

				I have only smoked it infused into Damiana, and only when prepared exclusively by BuddhaNature.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />How do you feel after those 200 experiences, any lasting positive or negative effects? I really feel pretty much the same so far.<br /><br />To the OP, I used a waterbong and it worked fine, it requires a few hits though which can be difficult as it kicks in quickly.

				DMT is what sparked my interest in Buddhism and general self-improvement.<br /><br />One of my first trips I experienced this amazing sense of presence. There was no time for a worrisome or stressful thought to come into my experience. I was at one with myself and the world. No thought, just experiences.<br /><br />I spent the next week or so trying to put a name to what I experienced, and somehow I came across the topic of Buddhism. What I read about the practice and their goals reminded me exactly of my DMT trip. Since then I&#039;ve picked up a daily meditation practice and I have been able to get myself into some very interesting mind-states just by calming down my mind. There have been a handful of times where I was pretty much tripping off meditation. Hard to explain.<br /><br />So yeah, DMT has definitely changed my life. It sparked an interest that I didn&#039;t have before.

				I found i got the best results outta one of those meth pipes (with the ball attached to the stem)...&nbsp; b4 i got the pipe i used the tin foil 20oz bottle method which worked but i couldn&#039;t get a &quot;breakthrough&quot;....&nbsp; i also put it on weed but that had the lowest effects (though i still tripped).....also i straight vapid it off foil (takes practice but works),,, i cant stand using tin foil tho.....my next investment will be the Genie, iv heard nothing but good things outta them...

				Go to ebay and search for &quot;pyrex oil burner&quot;. Cheap and they work great. I stuck the oil burner along with 2 bendable straws into the mouth of a 50ml jagermeister bottle. Works great and looks awesome.

				Interesting BuddhaNature, but what is it only a spark? Did the 199 next trips only serve to fuel the flame that was ignited on the first occasion, or did they somehow leave their own permanent impressions upon you?<br /><br />How about your 2c-b? Any lasting empathy or interesting benefits, inadvertent long-term effects?

				I don&#039;t really know why I do DMT anymore. I taught me what it needed to teach me... now it&#039;s more just for fun. I enjoy a change of scenery every once in a while.<br /><br />2C-B is great for a night chilling with friends or maybe even a rave but I wouldn&#039;t really say it&#039;s anywhere on the same level as a teacher. It is special in that it&#039;s the only psychedelic that I&#039;ve done that also has an empathogenic aspect to it. I have yet to try mescaline and that is supposed to be even better, but we&#039;ll see.<br /><br />The one thing I have noticed about 2C-B is the LAUGHTER. I have never laughed as hard as I did on my last 2C-B trip. It was just an hour straight of maniacal laughter. Literally everything that happened was funny.

				2C-B sounds like a blast. I&#039;m still waiting on my order of that goodness. And if you aren&#039;t ready to invest in a quality item to vape your DMT in (which I highly recommend), my first couple DMT trips where out of a regular old glass weed pipe. I found it a little tricky and never quite got the hang of it but you just need a screen, dmt on top, maybe another screen above it, and such the flame down just enough to start heating the DMT without burning it. <br /><br />I usually ended up burning a lot but I could get a nice feeling/quasi-trip out of it<br /><br />Cheers!

				2C-B isn&#039;t really a cross between MDMA and LSD... it&#039;s more in between. It&#039;s its own thing though for sure. At low doses its more of a roll than a trip and vice versa at high doses.

It works fairly well. The only down side is that you have to take two or three hits to get the &quot;breakthrough&quot; experience. So far I&#039;ve only managed to get two hits in and have not quite broken through as others have described it. By the time I&#039;m holding my second hit I begin to drift out and I want to put down the hot pipe somewhere safe before I&#039;m totally gone and risk dropping the pipe or burning myself or some sheets with the hot pipe.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering buying the glass Vapor Genie that everyone recommends. From what I&#039;ve read you can take a full &quot;breakthrough&quot; dose in one cool hit. So a meth pipe is a cheap way to test the waters, but a bong or the GVG are probably more ideal.<br /><br />EDIT : One thing to note about using the glass ball &quot;meth&quot; pipe, do not test the air flow you&#039;ll get from the pipe when it is loaded with DMT. I tried this and got a mouth full of bitter, face numbing, burning crystals. Needless to say, this is not the kind of distraction or sensation you want on a DMT trip. Make sure to heat the pipe so the DMT melts or vaporizes before you start inhaling on the pipe.

				The machine works best for me. I can take 100mg with one hit and not burn anything. Recently had my first bad DMT trip. I took too much. That was a few weeks ago. Still haven&#039;t got the courage to pick up the pipe again.<br /><br />What do you guys think about smoking DMT at the peak of a LSD or shrooms trip? I&#039;ve done it once on a low LSD dose and it was fantastic.

				HAHA , I&#039;ll tell you what. I have recently taken a hit of DMT during a heavy 25c-nbome trip.&nbsp; WOW--I have only done it once-last wknd-- it was indescribable. So let me describe it. <br /><br />(just one hit-a biggun)<br /><br />exhale. immediate eyes shut-room change. bam-diff room of course. BUUT unbelievably detailed-even more so real than the realest of life ! i actually opened my eyes and closed and was right back into my new room. did not have to refocus or wait. the room was spacious and all white-clean-sterile. decorated in white with light grey accents. everything was so crisp and vivid. sharp corners on edges and everything. i looked across the room and the was was white--but had dots like light grey wallpaper--i wld choose to zoom in on any one dot and there would&nbsp; be 4 different shapes pushing out of the dot. foot, hand. face, brain (that was the only color in the whole room-it had reds blues yellows swirling)&nbsp; . taking turns morphing and pushing in an out. all very clear. zoom oout--zoom back into another-was the same thing. on every wall. decided that since they were all the same i may as well meet this one. then zoomed in and was sitting at a table like for a convo. when i sat down the shapes slowed down and the chaos subsided. just as soon as i was getting comfy the real life started coming back. <br /><br />that was the last one of the night. did one the next day and was totally different. <br /><br />not as vivid and crisp as this time. I could not believe how matter of fact real this room was. Had to have been the 25c. Will experiment more other times of course, but nothing has ever been so perfectly architecturally crisp before.&nbsp; <br /><br />I shld also add that the actual room I was in was a 10 x10 office w 8 ft ceiling. The room i was in w my eyes closed was easily a 30 x 50 w a three story high ceiling with sunlight shining through. Way different by contrast.

				I&#039;m a high rated US domestic DMT vendor an wanted to add my two cents regarding proper DMT smoking techniques.&nbsp; Quick addition, I&#039;ve smoked a shit ton of DMT, to the point where I rarely smoke it any more aside from testing new batches and special planned moments in nature or with my significant other, this is due to the fact that I have a rediculous tolerance to the effects of DMT, I talk to aliens and multi-dimensionals as if they&#039;re fellow humans, I&#039;m too use to it that it barely effects me in terms of flooring me, hard to be amazed anymore and is kinda sad aside from rare divine moments that the universe surprises me with.<br /><br />Anywho, my favorite method for smoking DMT is to place a small amount of cannabis/tobacco/sage/etc. in a bong, with a percolator and iced water, to act as a bed for the dmt, I then apply a butane torch lighter far away enough to melt the dmt into the herb present, do not burn, vaporize.&nbsp; I then exhale all the air in my lungs after a few deep breaths, and start slowly milking the bong without burning the dmt at all, slowly allow thick clouds to fill the bong as slowly as possible, once then super thick smoke reaches the top of the bong cover the bong with your hand and catch your breath, exhale all the air from your lungs and take the bong full of smoke and hold for atleast 10 seconds.&nbsp; If it is your first time than this should be enough for a blast off, by the way, you should load atleast 100mgs for a guaranteed blastoff, set the bong down immediately at this point if this is your first time or if you&#039;re a novice.&nbsp; If you are a very experienced DMT tripper, than start the milking process all over again.&nbsp; The peak effects will not hit you for around a full minutes after inhaling the smoke, do not gauge your peak from physical sensation, you will feel a body buzz at first and this IS NOT AN INDICATOR of how much you&#039;ve inhaled, if you are looking for a blast off experience than keep smoking until the world disappears and set your smoking device down quickly to prevent injury/being burned/ect. <br /><br />A close friend sitter is highly recommended to take away the smoking impliment, as well as being present as a confidant to talk to about really deep trips regarding oneself.&nbsp; I say this because I have come out of really heavy DMT peak crying my eyes out and needed a friend that understood and was tustworthy and open to these abstract experiences.&nbsp; DMT+nitrous has recently shown me, in a very extreme way, that I was molested as a child by a family member and it has greatly effected my current life, having a trustworthy and kind friend present in these cases is crucial.<br /><br />On a lighter note, always use the bathroom before smoking DMT, whether or not you need to, I&#039;ve watched people literally piss themselves laughing during a DMT peak, and they were lucky enough to have packed a change of drawers, always use the Lou first whether you feel the need or not.&nbsp; To add, a group of friend comfortable with you getting up and droppin your trousers is a major plus, even if you use the toilet ahead of time your body may still be trying to get some toxic shit out from the corporate fastfood world we live in, a set of friends willing to help an intoxicated friend take a proper dumpage or not puke all over themselves is a very good thing.<br /><br />This is what I have to offer you folks, much love and happy trips, the world is in a dark time and understanding folk is what future generations need to prosper and keep the human race from causing its own extinction.&nbsp; Much love and peace, understanding too, to bridge the gap of indifference, Voltaire, always remember Voltaire, &quot;Though I may disagree with what you say, I will defend to the DEATH your RIGHT to say it.&quot;

				Thank you all for your input, espcially KidCasio2 for that very detailed post. I think i&#039;ll be buying the vapour genie and the glass ball pipe and see which one works the best. As a resident of the UK i have decided that Walter is my best DMT vendor as he/she seems to have very good rep and top stealth packages + its within europe which is a bonus in terms of speed of delivery and customs interception. peace!

				I&#039;ve tried mixing dmt with kush. Worked pretty well, Then made a machine out of a tabasco bottle. I like the machine especially compared to the glass dick, the main reason is the smoke is much easier to inhale with it. Today while on 400 mcg or so of LSD, I ripped probably the biggest rip of it that I have so far, and there was no change in my consciousness, its like i didn&#039;t even hit it. Even on a small toke of it, like one that wouldn&#039;t make the room start to spin and stuff I get a feeling in my head, its like a good body buzz but in the head region. Well I didn&#039;t even get that feeling when i took that big rip. <br />Could marijuana cause tolerance for tryptamines? I smoke a pretty good amount of nug, sometimes up to a half zone a week. Could this be a reason why I&#039;m not getting my desired results with them?

				Oil burner w/ a butane lighter. Try to pull for forty seconds straight and don&#039;t hold back thinking there will be a second hit b/c that&#039;s all you&#039;ll need.

				I&#039;ve tried just about every method under the sun with this yummy plasticy goodness.<br /><br />My favorites:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; GVG - Dump 30-40mg on a bed of MJ ashes, hits smooth and easy, don&#039;t even taste it in the least.&nbsp; I can usually hit it 2-3 times and really blast off for a good 30 minutes or so.&nbsp; If you have the money for it, grab one.<br /><br />2)&nbsp; Regular VG - Just as effective as the glass, but the travel time is shorter and you also can&#039;t really see the DMT vaporizing as you inhale, so harder to gauge than the GVG, but still a good tool if you don&#039;t have the extra $40 to drop on the glass one.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; The Machine - I only rate this below the VGs because it&#039;s so...ghetto.&nbsp; But on the upside it&#039;s a cheap and easy way to blast off for minimal effort.&nbsp; The smoke is gross and your glass bottle tends to get gross really fast as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s just kind of annoying when you pull your machine out for a group session and people are like &quot;what the fuck is that?&quot;<br /><br />4)&nbsp; Oil lighter - Cheap, easy like the machine, but good god does the smoke suck.<br /><br />5)&nbsp; Glass pipe (sandwich method) - Takes some practice to get the hang of not torching the DMT by accident.&nbsp; Hits hard, smoke is rough, bleh.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; &quot;The Key&quot; - Cheap and easy to assemble, but for some reason I just felt like it was inefficient at actually getting the DMT smoke, felt like I was just wasting my supply.&nbsp; There might be a different, better design out there.<br /><br />7)&nbsp; Lightbulb - Dont&#039; do it.&nbsp; Friend cut up her face when the bulb blew up on her.

				Check out www.dmt-nexus.me for info on how to best use the glass Vapor Genie. Using regular screens doesn&#039;t work to well because the DMT liquifies and drips through the screens before it can be vaporized. They suggest using Chore Boy copper scrubbers to create a screen or filter that prevents the liquid DMT from passing through.

				(cross posted from other thread, but it probably belongs here)<br />Ok, I&#039;ve been reading all this stuff about ways to get dmt to be just perfect for your trip. and here is my summary of the ways I&#039;ve tried<br /><br />Bong (w/ herb or weed) - waste of DMT, you need to use much more then you normally would (2-3x) to get the same effects since some of it will burn off. If you have an ample supply it&#039;ll sure get you there, and the weed helps to enhance the experience, but for those without much on hand I&#039;d recommend against this.<br /><br />&quot;The Machine&quot; - it works, but it takes a long time to heat the dmt in the steel wool, and some of my wool ended up catching on fire, which made it taste really bad and caustic. I failed to take off, but could see it working.<br /><br />Vape (weed vape w/ a tin foil insert bowl) air flow was a problem, the dmt melted and leaked out of the sides, and on top of that its hard to get a full on hit. I&#039;d recommend against this method.<br /><br />Weed pipe - sucks, don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />Oil burner - air flow was an issue, i had problems keeping the temp low enough with a torch burner, and it requires numerous hits since each one is such a small dosing. maybe with a card hole drilled in it would work but as is its rather bad. *edit* I broke through with a 60mg dose (45-50mg active coughed some though, wasn&#039;t expecting the 2nd hit to be as strong) inserting a straw into the top of the oil burner allows you to pull air through around the straw and vapor up the straw. - I will be trying this again with a larger oil burner/ Erlenmeyer flask<br /><br />freebasing aluminum foil - no. just no.<br /><br />glass ball &quot;meth/crack&quot; pipe - tastes off, slighly burnt, a little too much seems to escape from the bowl and it takes a few hits to get anywhere, I doubt breaking through is probable with this method, i&#039;d recommend against, but its better then most on this list.<br /><br />2L plastic bottle w/ tin foil base - i got a decent hit from it, but it tasted the worst of any of the methods I tried, it burned really bad and had a melted tape/plastic taste, you can probably break through like this but the pain to your lungs isn&#039;t worth it.<br /><br />Extended can (rockstar/monster) w/ the top clipped off and replaced with foil, carb hole inserted near the bottom. Works, but is hard to gauge since you can&#039;t see the vapor, I was very concerned about burning the contents, but managed to get an ok hit, no where near breaking through though. this is a pretty bad method, but at least it tastes ok.<br /><br />My own personal creation&nbsp; - &quot;The Spaceship&quot; - basically a modified version of &quot;The machine&quot; allows you to take a solid hit, enough so that you can break through, heating is very easy and can be controlled quite well (I have yet to burn any with this method after 5 hits!) it still tastes like dmt and comes out rather hot (fixed in v2!), but its much nicer tasting then the crack pipe, can, or 2L. This is the first and only method that I&#039;ve tried that works every-time, my only concern right now is that my breathing hole might be too small (Fixed in v2!), which could impair getting a large enough hit to break through. - *edit* for prolonged use this method is bad, the bottle breaks from constant heat exposure, controlling the heat in the bowl is somewhat difficult and diffusion into the foil can be a nuisance, with a proper aluminum or glass cap it would work 100% though.<br />

				Things needed for &quot;The Spaceship&quot;<br />1 hobo stove - take a tin can (tuna cans are perfect) cut off the top, consume anything inside. create a wick from a paper towel or cotton balls (cotton probably works better) feed the wick through a layer of cotton that fills up the entire base of the stove.<br />fill the rest of the stove with rubbing alcohol, drill a hole in the middle of the can lid to allow for the wick to pass through, feed through the wick and replace the lid, the lid will be held in place by the clothes hanger.<br />1 clothes hanger - bend it so it has three legs and a middle ring above the legs large enough to hold your bottle right around 1/2-1&quot; away from the wick. place the three legs on the inside rim of the hobo stove so they sit between the can and the lid, this will fasten the lid in place.<br />1 liquor bottle (clear, glass, thin neck and a sturdy bottom) I used wild turkey but you could use anything. A 750ml bottle works but I&#039;m going to experiment with a 1.75L vodka bottle.-(editthe 1.75 vodka bottle is far better.)<br />1. drill bit for glass/ceramic, and a power drill to use it with (use a 3/4&quot; or larger bit)<br />Tin foil<br />1 paper clip<br />1 lighter (torch or fire starter)<br />a cork or other similar method for plugging the breathing hole.<br />Remove the labels from your bottle, wash it thoroughly with rubbing alcohol and salt, drill a hole in the middle of the bottom of your bottle (this will take a while) the bigger this hole is the more you can take in a single hit. build a dmt catch/ holder out of aluminum foil. It should be large enough to totally plug the bottom of the bottle, but not too long as to make it harder to heat. Crush two air channels into the side of the dmt holder when you have confirmed it fits the bottle - these are important so you can get some airflow during the heating., place a bent paper clip through the bottom to easily remove the dmt holder. (you want to tug it out a little when the vapor has collected to allow more airflow and a stronger hit). - That&#039;s it! its built.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Using it has to be the laziest method for smoking dmt, simply pack your hit into the vape bowl, cram the bowl into the bottle, place the bottle on top of the wire hanger above the wick, cork the top, and light the wick. sit back relax and prepare yourself while the dmt vaporizes, watch it to make sure it doesn&#039;t get too hot (if you made the stove properly it shouldn&#039;t- i use an 1/8&quot; hole for the wick). when you see the first traces of vapor give it a quick pull to help the air flow and pull out some of the clean air (if you taste the dmt stop) when the bottle is filled and cloudy and you can no longer see dmt rising from the bowl (or it starts to come out the air channels in the bottom) remove from the heat source, pull the dmt holder out enough to maximize airflow (wearing a glove, don&#039;t burn yourself) and suck down the biggest hit you can.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post pics when I find my camera.

I&#039;d welcome any tips and tricks from anyone!<br /><br />So, the Sherlock came with a gauze which i left in there, i then cut the volcano pad to fit the pipe nice and snug and I placed another gauze on top of that, effectively sandwiching the liquid pad. I weighed the spice on my 0.0001 digital scales (gotta get it right!), popped it into the pipe and placed the ceramic filter on top. With the vaporgenie lighter placed above it, I breathed in slowly just enough the suck the flame in but not touching the black filter. I managed to clear the pipe in one hit and held it in as long as i could, laid back and enjoyed the ride. The visuals came on almost immediately.<br /><br />I must say that experience is like nothing else! <br /><br />I started off with 30mg and that went down very nicely with some lovely visuals that are really impossible to describe with words. After about 90 minutes I went for my second hit, this time with 60mg, the visuals were far more vivid, clear and intense and after the initial visuals I had this overwhelming sense of something trying to pull me away from my body and take my somewhere... but I just couldn&#039;t quite do it... i could almost feel myself not wanting to let go of this reality. The weird thing was that this &quot;being&quot; seemed to be quite frustrated with me! I couldn&#039;t really see this entity/being but there was definitely something there and for a few seconds it seemed to materialize... then it was gone. This was my first time with DMT so its hard for me to judge how far i actually went but i felt like i came really really close to breaking through. Everything went by really fast and i couldn&#039;t really focus in on anything.<br /><br />My only concern with this method is the residue/liquid/crystal/salts left behind inside the pipe. It was as if it had leaked through the pad and gauze and not fully vaporized so i don&#039;t know how much was wasted each time i hit it up. Have you had the same problem? Do you have any advise on how to vaporize every last bit? What dosage do you go with in your Sherlock? Me and my friends seem to think that in order to breakthrough. we&#039;ll need maybe 80/90mg?<br /><br />Any input from anyone reading this would be much appreciated... I&#039;m going to be making my next order very soon!<br /><br />Peace.

				The way I have my GVG set up is with 3 regular weed pipe screens set inside the bowl area first, then I place a cut to size Volcano liquid pad on top of those. When I smoke it, I place the top on and take a &quot;dry&quot; hit to clean off the residuals and warm the volcano pad. I use a reqular bic lighter and never have issues as the flame doesn&#039;t go through the black vape stone. I load anywhere from 10-30 mg onto the warm pad and it instantly melts into the pad. I put the top back on, take a deep breath, then fire up the bic and slowly pull at first and finish up hard. I hold that as long as i can, try to hit the pipe again, but usually nothing is left. As the pipe cools, the dmt recrystallizes in the bottom elbow under the bowl. This is perfectly normal. Its not dripping through. When you clean you GVG pour 20ml of 95% alcohol through it and pour it into a shot glass and cover with coffee filter and let it slow evap over a few days and you &#039;ll have more dmt. With the GVG you should not need anywhere near 80mg to get through the veil. Everyone&#039;s body is different, but it shouldn&#039;t take much. The best advice I can share, that has worked for me, would be to smoke the DMT by yourself. Its much easier to let go when you don&#039;t have eyes on you. Subconciously, alot of people have trouble dropping their guard even in front of friends. DMT is a personal trip, so try it solo. Do it when no one is home and there aren&#039;t any distractions. Silence. No music. Be sober. Alcohol always prevents me from crossing over although a bit of weed helps. I like to lay back in a lazy boy after midnight when the dwelling is calm and then go for it. Earn your trip. Try working out or clearing something from your proverbial plate before hand. It gives a nice sense of accomplishment before your voyage.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t break through with your first dose, pack more up as soon as you can, don&#039;t wait. Your mileage may of course vary, but I hope it&#039;s some help.

				First i take a bong, then i pack a smallish nug super super tight into the bowl. then&nbsp; I take about a Half gram to a full Gram of n-n-DMT and lay it on top of the nugget.<br />At this point it is pretty simple. Smoke the bong. The water makes it easier to hold your hit so it is a little easier to break through. <br />But my by far favorite way to blast off it sit down with the bong loaded to the brim with DMT, and just take pull after pull until you are there lol <br />SPace travels
