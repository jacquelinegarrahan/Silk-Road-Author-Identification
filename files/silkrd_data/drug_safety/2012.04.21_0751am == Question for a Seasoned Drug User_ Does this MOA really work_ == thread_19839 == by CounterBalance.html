				Hello, I just joined the community yesterday, really a top notch gig here.<br /><br />OK, Question Time: I hooked up with my nephew and a few other college kids last night and although I don&#039;t do drugs with them I definitely&nbsp; listen and of course sip my beer and pretend to be the &quot;older, non drug user&quot; guy.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; If they only knew.&nbsp; I have been using a myriad of drugs off and on for about 30 years and either this Method of Administration just missed me or they are full of shit.<br /><br />What they do is take a couple of 30mg Oxycodone IR (roxis or whatever)&nbsp; and smash them and then drop them in a baby size OCEAN Nasal Spray.&nbsp; OCEAN is not one of the decongestant sprays it is merely a saline solution for cleansing.&nbsp; So, they let it dissolve in there and then of course take a toot as desired.&nbsp; They say it works way better than snuffing dry crushed or oral and it gives them about 5 x times the mileage out of the pills!&nbsp; It keeps for days in the spray bottle without losing potency.<br /><br />Has anyone done this? Heard of it?&nbsp; Seems to me the spray would so greatly dilute the oxycodone that you really would not get much in your system.&nbsp; They say contrary, due to the fact that oxycodone is water soluble the mist is much more membrane permeable and chemically loaded with oxy.&nbsp; Therefore, you get higher for much less money. <br /><br />Obviously I am going to try it but I do not know when.&nbsp; Anyone give me some feedback?<br /><br />Counterbalance

				I&#039;ve heard of this sort of thing, but it was quite some time ago, and i seem to recall it being different drugs and different solvents involved.&nbsp; That said, though, at first glance I think this would probably work.&nbsp; You&#039;ve got all the bio-availability benefits of nasal delivery, plus the drug is already pre-dissolved as opposed to having to go into your membranes dry.&nbsp; Whether or not you get 5x the mileage out of the pills, though, I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; That seems excessive.<br /><br />Related aside ... I do know folks whose preferred method of taking [insert powder/pill-form chemical here] is via insufflation, but they do it the traditional dry/crushed route, but then afterwards, they take a spray off of one of those OCEAN bottles.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s to help with absorption or just to try to keep their noses from drying out.
