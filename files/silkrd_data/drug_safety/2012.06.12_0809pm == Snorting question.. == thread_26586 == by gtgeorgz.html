				is it best to sort each line up the same nostril or change what nostril you use after each line? <br />i tend to keep it all up my left nostril but then i realized that my left nostril is going to be fucked but my right one fine.. <br />

				hmm, what do you guys think about making up your normal sized line, sorting half up your left, then the second half up your right? More absorption of the drug?<br />i&#039;m guessing this probably wouldn&#039;t be very effect for coke as it wont hit you that quick because of the time it takes to swap over, but what about in the case of mephedrone? <br /><br />actually but saying that you could split the line into train tracks and sort it up each nostril up the same time.. would that work best?

Left aint the way but obviously.....this doesn&#039;t always follow through.

				i tried to do some research, and its hard to find info or rationalize the potential mechanism<br /><br />from the anatomy of the circulatory system and nasal membranes, with nearly everything being symmetrical... i dont see any physiological evidence to support the claim. <br /><br />personally i have never really noticed any difference. possibly its psychosomatic to some extent<br /><br />i am very curious. please find the reference you mentioned, i would enjoy reading as well<br />

				in my experience of whacking various powders up my nose i&#039;ve got to say i hadn&#039;t noticed if it makes a difference which nostril you use, and like most other people i just alternate or use the one thats actually working at the time. i&#039;ll try to take notice next time.

When I snort I test to see which of my nostrils is the dominant one and then use that one. It&#039;s possible that when you&#039;re using your right nostril it&#039;s not dominant at the time and you&#039;re not getting a good line down. <br /><br />Dunno, just speculating .... I&#039;ve never noticed a difference between the two.
