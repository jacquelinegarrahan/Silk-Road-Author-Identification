				The prescriptions and OTC you may be likely to take will make a difference.<br />Prescriptions can cross react - such as, say, Effexor/PCP - which can result in send-out and more sensitive screening.<br /><br />A 12-panel catches more than 12 substances. Cross reaction of all of these would be many pages. I have the article, should you desire it. ?<br />Here&#039;s what&#039;s actually *on* the panel.<br />- methamphetamine<br />- amphetamine<br />- MDMA<br />- MDA<br /><br />- Cannabis<br /><br />- Cocaine (cocaine metabolites)<br />&nbsp;<br />- Barbiturates<br /><br />- Benzodiazepines<br /><br />- Opiates (morphine/codeine/hydrocodone/hydromorphone/opium)<br />- Methadone<br />- Oxycodone (and oxymorphone)<br /><br />- PCP<br /><br />Let&#039;s start there...<br /><br /><br />edited, too quick on the trigger

				Look into Research Chemicals. <br /><br />Synthetic Cannabinoids like spice and the JWH&#039;s. <br />LSD<br />Mecaline containing Cacti or pure Mescaline (Not 100% sure on this one)<br />Alcohol as long as its not the same day as the test<br /><br />Just a couple of the top of my head.

				SWIM had been eating a bunch of the noms (25i) and tested slightly for weed.&nbsp; He hadn&#039;t smoked weed in two months and his previous tests came up clean.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe it was the noms, maybe it was the second hand smoke from tripping in a room with 1 guy smoking weed. He doesn&#039;t stay in rooms with people who are smoking weed any more.<br /><br />

It&#039;s an arcylhexawhateverthefuckyoucallit and so is somewhat closely related to PCP. Depending on the type of the test and the accuracy of the test, it may or may not show up as a false positive for PCP. As soon as ANY of the panels show up positive, they will likely send it to a lab for accurate screening, in which case Ketamine probably will show up on the screening, and there is almost no chance you can explain away Ketamine in your system.

				Well, ketamine/metabolites will be around for 3-4 days.<br />You can only get away with the &quot;I was in the ICU getting intubated&quot; story so many times.<br /><br />Of the above, the resus a horse story is by far the best, plus I&#039;m still laughing on the third read.<br /><br />Also, on a quick skim, I didn&#039;t find anything on whether or not methoxetamine will cross-react with PCP, but for now I would assume it would. <br />Goodness knows Effexor, Demerol, Benadryl, Lamictal, dextromethorphan, and many other things do.<br />Ah, you say, but can&#039;t I just say I took a bunch of Benadryl?<br />No, they&#039;ll send it out for confirmation anyway, probably. <br />I mean, I guess it depends on your situation.

				Well you obviously can do mushrooms and LCD and probably other hallucinogens. One that hasn&#039;t been mentioned is Suboxone. I used to like taking pain killers like Hydros Percocets and Oxys but in fear of failing a drug test i would use Suboxone... some people like it and some don&#039;t

				I took suboxone without checking to see if it would show on a drug test.<br /><br />I read it stays 3-10 days.&nbsp; <br /><br />I drank shit tons of water, peed nice and clear for them<br /><br />But god damn I had the &quot;I was drugged at a bar and raped!&nbsp; Thank you for letting me know that I didn&#039;t get blacked out off of three beers and bang a stranger!!!&quot;&nbsp; story ready to go out.&nbsp; <br /><br />The test was 4 days after I ate it.&nbsp;

				Buprenorphine has to be screened for specifically as buprenorphine.<br />It&#039;s an increasingly common add-on test, though.<br /><br />Um, you ate it? Not sublingual? Also, seems like reporting a possible sexual assault (not clear from your description) could cause you far more hassles than a dirty UA, but maybe your region handles these things differently.&nbsp; <br />Hot tox screen is an administrative issue, false report goes above and beyond that.&nbsp; People tend to get pissed off when they have been lied to about such things and follow through with consequences.<br /><br />Anyway, buprenorphine won&#039;t cross-react on a 12-panel, but they really do add it on increasingly often as an extra screen, be aware of that.<br />

				personal experience has shown that:<br /><br />Fentanyl will not be detected bc it is synthetic. However you have to be well connected, flush with cash, and have a high tolerance to be using Fent for fun. I did...and I ate a lot of it (3 lolipops a day). It did not end up nicely... <br /><br />But if you like opiates...goto Subutex, not Fentanyl.
