				I&#039;m sick of seeing posts of people buying drugs then wondering how they can measure accurate doses without a scale. This is a general thread about the benefits of owning a scale. It is also a place for people to discuss the different scales they own and what they use them for. <br /><br />These are mine and If one of them ever broke, I would go buy a replacement.<br />1. 1000g accurate to .1 - got it because I can tare glass jars on it<br />2. 100g accurate to .01 - nice shape, nice tray - daily driver - gotten the most use<br />3. 100g accurate to .01 - looks just like a ipod nano so if I have to take a scale out of my house I&#039;ll take this one but has a really small tray.<br />4. 20g accurate to .001 - used for personal experimentation with minute differences in dosage - kind of a hassle to use<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to get drug residue on your scale you can always put a bag on it, tare the bag, then put your substance in the bag. <br /><br />If you are weighing out more than your tray holds, just put a party cup or bowl on it and tare that. <br /><br />If you own a scale, you can post accurate vendor reviews like &quot;Product came in .6 overweight&quot; rather than &quot;product received as described&quot;<br /><br />You will never have to deal with people telling you that you&#039;re skimping them - likewise - you will never be skimped. <br /><br />If your friend doesn&#039;t have one you can sell him yours at a slight markup and then just go buy a new one.<br /><br />IF SOMEONE HAS A REASON NOT TO OWN A SCALE PLEASE SHARE BECAUSE EVERYONE NEEDS ONE!

				that is&nbsp; true. i do have a scale to weigh 1 mg doses if i have to... but i travel and it not easy to carry that thing around. Ill stick to eyeballing at the moment... But i highly recommend getting one. Just to learn what doses look like!<br />I got mine years ago when i got my hands on some 5-meo-amt... That drug scared me so much i had to get a scale. But other stuff from the same vendor turned out to be bunk... so everything went down the toilet...... im telling this because most people need a push to get a scale. i od-d before getting one and that was not enough &quot;push&quot; to invest.... But being scared shitless from a rc did it for me and i never regretted it.

				after going over/under a few times on 2cb.... I wish i had enough money for a scale that reads good to the .01<br /><br />I have the gemini as well bought from amazon, and ive been using it with drugs that dont really need that much rigidity in number down to the tenth (molly, coke, GHB, shrooms, tits,)<br /><br />with 2cb...well...lets just say I accidently made my sister snort probably 5-10mg more than she should have as well as having my friend swallow 10-15mg more&nbsp; causing a nice rip in their space/time continuum.<br /><br />so, if your not gonna buy a good scale (like my cheap as isn&#039;t)&nbsp; go retardedly under on amounts and &#039;chip up&#039; till you achieve whatever the fuck you want to get fucked on

				If police finds 10 grams of weed in your house they&#039;ll fuck off with a warning, possibly without taking your weed.<br /><br />If police finds 10 grams of weed and a scale you have a very big chance of getting charged with dealing. (depending on many factors but still)<br /><br />Your call, I do have a scale but I&#039;m not using it that often and it&#039;s always well hidden just in case...<br /><br />In my opinion you have to be fucking retarded to overdose.

				ugh, i agree with you in regards to overdosing any drug?<br /><br /><br />but if that was intended to be said to me, know that, the &#039;overdose&#039; in 2cb wasn&#039;t dangerous, nor was it close to heroic doses of it...it was a mere heavy trip.&nbsp; Something that me and my bro-in-law have done, purposely, many times over.<br /><br />But yes, overdosing in anything is pretty stupid. i would have to aim that towards probably fentanyl and heroin that needs very serious measurements and caution.<br /><br />anything else is actually retarded.

				You can buy scales in a head shop for ten pounds. The problem is that they are all made in China and I have seen some very inaccurate ones out there, ones that fail the simnple penny test, or twp pence!<br /><br />&nbsp;I bought my scales over 15 year ago for weed and hash, they were jewellers scales, back then dealers would not be able to pop down the high street and buy scales, but some head shops did stock jewellers scales when they became cheap enough to mass market a bit. Even then it was over 100 UK pounds. But, worth every penny as nobody wants arguments over under-weight products! Were I live, lets just say that its unwise to sell underweight. Actually its unwise to sell anything so we stay online and away from the scene that starts with&nbsp; 8 year kids acting as lookouts and 12 year old children ferrying the drugs and selling by age 13 or 14 and having access to a gun aged 15/16. <br /><br />I have an old set of Tanita that I keep way off the premises. I actually thought I lost tose and got a cheap set off a friend. I&#039;m sure I overweighed some shit! <br /><br />And, top tip for dealers, NEVER keep scales and baggies on the premises even though its obvious a personal user of drugs would need scales, and sometimes bags if you want to split things up into smaller lots. Even a weed toker might want to keep a record of how much they are consuming. <br /><br />So I still use these scales as they are very accurate and never let me down. Years ago when selling weed was pretty safe you would have people come back to dealers claiming the hash or weed looked underweight! OIften we got Morrocan hash compressed so much that it did look a bit light to the eye. I&#039;ve seen people get half a gram of overweight chopped back off when they ask for a weigh in.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Today, I don&#039;t think most street dealers bother witrh scales. They just buy a post-stamp sized bag, fill it up a bit and sell it for 20 UK pounds! You can get ounces if you know the right people, that can range from a friends price of 80 UK pounds up to the 240 UK pounds commercial ounce sale. On SR I&#039;ve seen an ounce go for silly prices. I guess most buying that must earn a good wage - I do myself but would never spend silly money on weed when Amsterdam is like 2 hours away! <br /><br />You can get an oz of good Morrocan hash for 100 UK pounds if you know some guy in some shop who does his own little deals with people he knows. The Dutch can always buy an ounce in local shops. And these shops all have scales!&nbsp; Well the Dutch football fans I worked with were doing that. Stoned hooligans, usually behave themselves. <br /><br />So, for me,, the Tanita do not need replacing. I don&#039;t do RCs so don&#039;t need to measure out a mg which my scales cannot do. I think they are accurate to within 100th of a gram which was good enough for gold traders and so on. Good enough for hash for sure!<br /><br />For a gram of hash (and other things of course) , the scales are the ultimate authority. After all, some hash is VERY compressed, so iits going to look smaller. Some hash is made using a VERY fine screen, this &#039;No 1 hash&#039; also will look smaller. The hash made with the more course screen (No 3 hash) will always be a bit bulkier. I recall the classic Lebanese hash of the 80s and how big an ounce seemed to look.<br /><br />Also, never dismiss balance scales! They are very accurate for things like hash, weed and coke and other things solkd in grams. And bear in mind, even if you do clean your scales with alcohol or some other solvent, even if you use party cups or pieces of plastic to stop getting drug contamination, most scales, have openings into which the incriminating product can be found. Cops can always open up scales and swab inside. <br /><br />Some of the more high end kitchen scales are very good also - and can be left on open display. Main thing is NEVER keep bags and scales with any drugs you mioght happen to possess!<br /><br />And be inventive, its easy to make a stash off the premises. Just make sure you go off the beaten track as cops in urban areas often just flood a park or field with sniffer dogs and cops probing with metal detectors for guns.<br /><br />IF you use RCs, buy a good set of scales. I&#039;d say uoi only need one set of scales and if your just using hash and weed think about some balance scales. You can actually weigh out 3.5 grams with some string and two party cups. <br /><br />Yup, those party cups have many uses!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)
