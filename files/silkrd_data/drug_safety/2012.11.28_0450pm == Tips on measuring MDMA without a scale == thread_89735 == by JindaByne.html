				So I don&#039;t have a mg scale, and was planning on rolling with some molly. Usually when I do this I can just eyeball it for myself and if you go a bit too big I can handle it. But I was planning on giving it a go with my first lady and with it bein her first time, I dont want to go too overboard and her be overwhelmed but I also don&#039;t want to go to little and be having to deal with re-dosing and what not.<br /><br />Any tips on how to measure a good 140mg-160mg into a cap? or anything for that matter?

				Well, first of all, seriously consider going for less than 140mg for her first time. That is a heavy dose for a first timer, especially a female (unless she&#039;s fairly overweight.) You really should err on the side of caution for a first-timer with MDMA as individuals&#039; sensitivities can vary greatly, and some can be VERY sensitive. For my first time I was only using 50-60mg and rolling pretty hard on that, so be careful. If she&#039;s small, I&#039;d go with about 80mg, if she&#039;s a bit bigger, maybe 100. Even if you have to re-dose and she doesn&#039;t really get much out of the first time, you&#039;re better safe than sorry until you figure out her sensitivity.<br /><br />So about the measurements. Here&#039;s what you can do:<br /><br />Crush the MDMA into a powder or very small grains. Put it on a piece of paper and flatten it out using a knife or other flat, firm object. Don&#039;t crush it down too hard, just use moderate pressure so that you have it in a nice single flat layer. Next, shape it into a circle. Have the grains tight enough together so that there&#039;s not really any space between them, but not so much that you&#039;re creating a pile with grains on top of each other. When you have a flat circle of the powder/grains that is the size of a dime (American, Canadian-- not sure about equivalent sized coins in other countries) then what you have is approximately 120mg. From there, you can add or remove fractional amounts to get various measurements. Remove one third of it and you have 80mg for example.<br /><br />Another thing you can do is if you have a normal scale that weighs in grams. Weigh out 1g of it, crush it down to powder or small grains, then divide into 4 equal piles. Then you&#039;ll have approx. 250mg per pile. You can further divide each of the four piles in half and you&#039;ll have about 125mg per pile. You get the idea from there. These are the methods I used before I got a mg scale. Hope these methods work for you.<br /><br />Again, if what you have is good clean MDMA, I really would not give your first-timer friend as much as you&#039;re thinking. It could give her a very uncomfortable rush, she could throw up and/or have other negative side effects. Always be careful with a first-timer! 80mg should be plenty, and if she&#039;s not feeling anything after an hour or so, try another 40-50mg.<br /><br />Good luck!

				It&#039;s true, I&#039;m about 130 and have taken MDMA more times than I can count, and sometimes I&#039;ll still randomly throw up from it. Not nauseous sickness kind of throw up, but like when you take too many shots and throw up outside the bar, a relieving kind of yak. For the first time go insanely small, I would put your desired dose in a powerade or juice or something and just take a sip. Wait half an hour and then continue drinking it. <br />&quot;small risk of death; approximately 2 per 100,000 users have extreme negative reactions resulting in death (rare)&quot;<br />https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_effects.shtml<br />SO it&#039;s really important to &quot;microdose&quot; your first time.

				If you know how much you have then just split it over and over again. Chop it up on a mirror, split into lines of equal size and continue to split it until you have the amount you want. Might not be exact but it will be more precise than a 0.1g scale which may weigh everything from 51 to 149mg as being 0.1g.

				MDMA is stable in water. Take a water bottle and empty it. Add back 10 cap-fuls (as in the bottle cap, not a gel cap) of water. You could also use shot glasses, but the bottle cap works just fine. Dump 1 gram into it and make sure it completely dissolves. Now you know each capful of water that you pour out (filling the bottle cap) is 100 mg. If you want more granularity, you could dump the gram into 100 capfuls of water and dose yourself with 14 of them to get 140 mg. It&#039;s a bit of work and not good for filling gel caps, but it is a cheap and relatively accurate solution for not having a scale.

				You need to use a volumetric distribution method if you want to no be a fuckup since you dont have a scale. If your seriously gonna take a ecstasy cherry be real about it, get real beans and do it right! MDMA and lidocane :) :) :)

				When it comes to MDMA, you really cannot go wrong at all!!!! like that shit makes you super euphoric and you just cannot go wrong. No matter where you are, who you are with, You will have a fan-fucking-tastic time on MDMA!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />You accidentally take too much? Oh shit I guess you&#039;re in for a better time. Well of course stupid high doses are pretty neurotoxic!

				I would assume filling up that &quot;bump area&quot; on a Parliament cigarette would be 100-120ish MGS<br /><br />But than again, you can get a scale off clear net for a good price and quickly.

				Yes, on second thought, just forget about trying to eye it out and get that Gemini scale on Amazon for $25 or whatever it is. Easily affordable and the scale works fine.

				GET A FRIGGIN SCALE OMG!<br /><br />Eyeballing a first dose when it&#039;s someone&#039;s first dose is NOT a good idea...<br />The scales are very inexpensive and one lasts you a long time...<br /><br />GET A SCALE, do not use the method of &quot;weighing 1g&quot; and then making into 4 piles, you&#039;ll mess something up....<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Hi,<br />All you need to know is the amount you start with, I have a mg scale but most of the time I don&#039;t need it to weight my parachutes. I just split a gram in 8, I obtain roughly 120mg doses and split a few of them in two for boosters or for unexperienced users. MDMA is not very sensitive to dosage, it really doesn&#039;t matter if you take a 100mg or a 120mg parachute, you really don&#039;t need a mg scale to dose it.<br /><br />Just start small and enjoy ! <br /><br />WL

				Get a fucking scale dude!!<br /><br />Every self-respecting psychonaut should have one and (previous posters are correct) they are very inexpensive these days.<br /><br />It&#039;s your lady&#039;s first trip so don&#039;t fuck around. Introduce her to the blessed sacrament like a gentleman and get it right. Your intention is good on that score - now please follow through on technique.<br /><br />For first trips BTW I would suggest keep it to 1.5mg / kg for the initial dose. If she&#039;s sweet with it then take another 0.5-0.75mg / kg between T+1hr or T+1.5hr.<br /><br />BG
