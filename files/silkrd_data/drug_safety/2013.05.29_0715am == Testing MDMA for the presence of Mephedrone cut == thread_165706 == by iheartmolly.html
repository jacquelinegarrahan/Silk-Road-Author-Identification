				My question is, Mecke, Marquis and Mandellin can&#039;t really detect a slight mephedrone cut added to MDMA. Is my statement false or true? Are there ways to detecting if mephedrone was added to MDMA?<br /><br />What sparked my curiosity was that I heard of someone who got an extensive drug test done and testing positive for MDMA and Mephadrone. The person thought they took just MDMA.<br /><br />Random link that I also found interesting below.<br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/512598-Marquis-Mecke-Mandellin-results-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more

				What kind of drug test did they take?&nbsp; The standard drug tests don&#039;t test for mephedrone.&nbsp; It would probably require a fairly expensive blood test to specifically test for mephedrone.<br /><br />I would guess that your friend tested positive for MDMA and methamphetamine.&nbsp; Mephedrone and MDMA will show a positive under the mephamphetamine test.<br /><br />How long was it between when your friend took the MDMA and took the drug test?

Both sound closely alike. But the deeper I researched into mephedrone, the more it started to seem like a viable mdma cut. As far as I know, I have never messed with mephedrone so i&#039;m unfamiliar with its texture or smell.
