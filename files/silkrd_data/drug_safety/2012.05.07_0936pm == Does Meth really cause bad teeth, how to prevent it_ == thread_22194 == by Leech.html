				When I used to smoke meth I used to do numerous things to try to protect my teeth. I used to rub beeswax on them or Id go buy teeth whitening kits that had the Styrofoam covers..I tried mouth guards but you cant close your mouth around the pipe well...Iv also gotten all the sugar out of gum and covered my teeth before I smoked...all is works for smoking cocaine too. Your mouth is naturally salty. Keeping your mouth in that state will help against demineralization. I used to gargle salt water. Then I just quit the shit. Peace brother hope this helps

				&quot;Meth Mouth&quot; is merely caused by, lack of hygiene, eating lots of sugary foods/soda, and the fact that methamphetamine dries your mouth out like nothing else. So all you need to do to keep your beautiful smile is to brush, floss regularly, and either keep always be drinking a bit of water or chew some gum.

				Also recommend to use mouth wash, but NOT the standard Listerine etc... the mouthwash containing alcohol is really bad for you.<br />Have a search for some natural mouthwash alternatives that contain a lot of minerals and vitamins which promote healthy gums and teeth.<br /><br />Question - I tend to get a pretty blocked up throat after a smoking binge so I&#039;ve taken to hotrailing more often than just smoking out of a pipe.<br />Haven&#039;t really done it long enough to find out, but would hotrailing also irritate the throat in the same way given that the vape still passes through it except from a slightly different direction?<br /><br />FYI for those that don&#039;t know, Hotrailing is when you superheat one end of a glass or preferrably pyrex glass tube (around 4&quot; long) and then snort a line or bump of finely crushed meth. If you got the temp right on the hot end, the meth will vaporise as it enters the tube through the host side and you will end up blowing a massive cloud out even if you hold it in for longer in your lungs... this is mainly because you can do a lot more meth at once with a hotrail, SO BE CAREFUL to keep a track of your consumption...

Anything which causes dry mouth for extended periods of time will cause &quot;meth mouth&quot; it doesnt even have to be drug-related.<br /><br />Easily prevented if you are always mindful to drink plenty of watern stay hydrated, and chew gum, but not sugary gum.

				It say that meth itself doesn&#039;t factor in, I wouldn&#039;t totally agree but I would agree that hygiene plays the largest role. But keep on on all the hygiene and keep smoking that stuff for 10-15yr and watch what happens....Obviously washing your meth the best you can before consumption is key if its street dope.

				If you brush, floss, and overall take care of your teeth like you&#039;re supposed to, and then some (try for 3 times a day, for at least five minutes) you&#039;ll be fine. Meth dries your mouth out, so if you brush your teeth like the average person (once/twice a day, for a couple minutes), it may not be enough. Also- when do you usually feel compelled to brush your teeth? Before and/or after a period of sleep, right? Welp.

				i see alot of you saying meth drys your mouth out, ive never had this effect ive smoked meth maybe 10-15times over the last 5yrs or so and it dont dry my mouth out and yes its real meth had it of dopeboy, vmm, and crystal wife and never experienced a dry mouth! maybe its cos im a complete stoner and smoke weed all the way though my meth buzz, but they do say snorting courses tooth rot more, however my teeth do feel slightly strange for a day or so after use, like the same feeling i get after a mad night on mdma but a bit more full on if that make any sense, but like mdma they start to feel normal after a couple of times brushing them,&nbsp;

				I work in healthcare . The rotting teeth is usually a combination of diet, other vices like alcohol and cigaretters and general poor hygiene / lack of exercise. <br /><br />If you are a recreational user with good hygiene, don&#039;t worry about it. If you are a serious user... get good dental coverage ;)
