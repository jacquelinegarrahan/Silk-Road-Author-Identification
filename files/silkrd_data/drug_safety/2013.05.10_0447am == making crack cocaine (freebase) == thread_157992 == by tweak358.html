				any tips on cooking my 8-ball down to some nice big smokable rocks.&nbsp; I have have all sorts of ratios of soda to coke and some say filter everything when it&#039;s don&#039;t bubbling and some say scrape the crack off the top and dump whatever sinks, I guess whatever so is is 90% soda?&nbsp; I don&#039;t care about making super high quality I am not a smoker.&nbsp; If I can come out with some passable rocks that won&#039;t have these guys trying to stick me cuz I tipped them off but at the same time get a nice amount of volume I will be very happy.

				This is Quoted from the Clearnet.<br /><br />:P<br /><br />Cats do that&nbsp; :P<br /><br />The Microwave <br /><br />You need a shotglass if you&#039;re cooking like a quad. Any more and you should get a thick glass or pyrex drinking glass.<br />Baking soda<br />Cocaine<br />Water<br /><br />Put your coke in the shotglass, I&#039;d put around 7g in a shotglass for reference. Throw in about 2gs of baking soda and fill the shotglass about half full. Stir this up with something.<br />You do NOT want your mixture to &quot;pop&quot; in the microwave. It gets crack everywhere and is generally not fun to scrape your microwave down. -_-;<br />Stick it in the microwave for about 5-10 seconds. Pull it out, look at it, you&#039;re looking for a SHITLOAD of oil. If you don&#039;t think it&#039;s enough<br />put it back in the microwave for about 5seconds or so. After you think you&#039;ve got all you can get stir your butterknife in the shotglass until you&#039;ve got all the oil clung on there. You&#039;ll probably have to take it out because making a giant rock is somewhat hard.<br /><br />Spoon and Baking soda<br /><br />Probably the most common method.<br /><br />You need: Spoon, baking soda, water, lighter, small knife<br /><br />You want to use aproximately a 1:4 ratio. Meaning, 1 gram of coke .25 of baking soda.<br /><br />Put the coke in the spoon, put the soda in the spoon, put enough water to cover it with a little extra. Heat the spoon up. If your shit starts to foam that means it&#039;s garbage and is cut with way to much baking soda. You need to be very careful heating it up if it starts to foam, don&#039;t let it cool off, keep heating it but not to the point where it&#039;s smoking. You want to heat it until there is an oil on the top of the water (this oil is crack). If your shit doesn&#039;t foam thats a good thing just heat it up until you see oil. When you stop seeing more oil form you set your lighter down and pick up a small knife. Slowly stir the knife around the oil pile (this takes some practice as if you use an icecube it cools really fast and you have to know what you&#039;re doing so for people that don&#039;t I&#039;d 86 the icecube). When it starts to get cool you&#039;ll notice that the oil is sticking to your knife. Once you get all the oil onto the knife get out your pipe and throw that rock on there (it&#039;ll be smooshy until it dries...you don&#039;t have to wait for it to dry those wet hits are the best).<br /><br />The Coffee Pot <br />I&#039;ve only seen this used with amounts over an ounce or more so I&#039;m going to use an ounce in this.<br />You need 1oz coke, 7g baking soda, lots of water, bunsen burner or gas stove, pyrex coffee pot (glass ones work but they get really hot really fast)<br /><br />You don&#039;t need a huge flame to do this at all. Throw all the shit in the coffee pot<br />fill it about half full of water. Mix it around. Put it on the flame until you see it all bubble up stir it while its bubbling. In about a minute or so you&#039;ll start to see that beuatiful oil. Remove from heat,throw some ice in there usually like 12 cubes or so. Stir it some more. I would let this dry for a while on a plate or something.<br /><br />Shotglass Ammonia<br />You need 7g cocaine, ammonia, shotglass, knife<br /><br />Put the coke in the shotglass, fill it half full with ammonia and stir it. After a minute or two it will turn to oil and stick to the knife. Throw it onto a plate and let it dry for a second. You don&#039;t have to I guess, but when I cooked with ammonia I always got about 6 coffee filters, folded them half way and put all my rocks in there and rinsed it off for about 10seconds in the faucet. Then I let them dry.<br /><br />Spoon and Ammonia <br /><br />You need 1-3g of coke, ammonia, spoon, lighter, knife<br /><br />Put the coke in the spoon, cover it with ammonia, heat it up for about 3 seconds until it turns to oil (it turns to oil fast). Scrape oil up with the knife....I would also say you need to rinse this off as well with the above method.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br /><br />I know nothing about crack so i cannot assure that this is true&nbsp; :P<br /><br />but if i were to do some of these techniques...i would use some ice/ice water in place of the &quot;knife&quot;<br /><br />:P<br /><br />gottuh make &#039;em Rock Up when yur tryin to make that Jelly Roll&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br /><br /><br />ChemCat&nbsp; O0

				thanks guys, once I cook it down I won&#039;t be very tempted to use it.&nbsp; I tried it about a decade ago and didn&#039;t enjoy it but yet still found my self ghost hunting for little pebbles in and undrneath my car seat.&nbsp; I then proceeded to accidently leave a .380 in a hotel room.&nbsp; Also everytime I have been on the other end of a gun a smoker or a cop was behind the triggerr, funny thing is I never really felt threatened.

				Washing C is very easy with Bicarb or ammonia, Its a little scary first time as Coke is not cheap.<br />&nbsp;It may help to understand the chemistry behind it, I tried to explain it in another thread, I will paste it below<br /><br />&nbsp;When you wash Coke into Crack (freebase) you are turning the coke from a Salt back to a base, A salt is water soluble and the Base is not its turned into a salt to make it able to be snorted or IVed. Crack as you will know needs vitC or Citric acid to break it down, making it dissolve in the water. which is basically turning it back to a water soluble salt. Another point is that a Salt cannot be smoked as its vape temp is too high while the base vapes at a lower temp and can be smoked.<br />&nbsp;It is the same as the difference between heroin no3 (smoking Heroin) and no4 (snorting, IV) no3 being the Base and no4 being the salt.<br />&nbsp;You can wash H No4 back to No3 with Bicarb the same as making crack from Coke, and add citric/vitC to no3H to be able to IV it. Its all to do with the PH of the Coke/Gear.<br />&nbsp; I hope this makes a little sense, it took me a long time to get my head around.<br />&nbsp;Try washing a bit of Coke it really is very easy , and very difficult to fuck up.<br />&nbsp;In answer to the question, they should be the same but IMO I think the hit from the crack when IVed is better than a coke hit and that even when they originate from the same batch of Coke. IMO Crack gives a much better high than Coke, saying that I like working on Coke and I can&#039;t say that about Crack.<br />C

				Thanks for the highlights.<br /><br />Though does anyone have precise figures that we can work with? Maybe give the exact ratio for all substances in their pure form so we can calculate how much we actually need of each ingredient.<br />Does anyone also have some cooking times, heating information that can be used (for example the power setting for the microwave and how long it must be turned on).<br />Cooking this stuff while reading it off of here is very difficult, since the instructions are not very precise.<br /><br />Can anyone redirect me to a video that shows step by step process to making crack cocaine?<br /><br />Thank you all,<br />Happy holidays.<br /><br />

				Mr Lucy, if you do freebase (ammonia process) you don&#039;t need to know exactly how much to use, cause you can do it drop by drop &#039;till you see a reaction (white trails) and stop when doesn&#039;t react anymore.<br /><br />for sure there is some calculation to do things faster, but you can try and figure out by yourself.<br /><br />You need a right type of ammonia, not flavoured! and with a certain % (ammonia diluted in water), but I don&#039;t remember right now.<br /><br /><br />I freebase once, with a glass with some water, dropped coke inside (you see it disappear! that&#039;s scary lol) and than used a dropper for the ammonia.<br /><br />I did with just 0.2 of street cocaine and I got just a little Q of freebase... shame on my local guy!<br /><br />my 0.0002073฿

				Alright, so i am just going to assume the ratios are for their maximal pure form. So if i know my cocaine is 35% pure, i will need to mix 1 gram 99% baking soda to 11.4 grams of my quality cocaine. Is this true?<br /><br />I see there are also different types of baking soda? Will something called Baking Powder work if it has one or two of the substances needed; potato starch, inflating ingredient, disodium diphosphate, sodium hydrogen carbonate (danish: natriumhydrogencarbonat)?<br /><br />Isn&#039;t the sodium hydrogen carbonate the same as sodium bicarbonate or usual baking soda?<br /><br />Lastly, if i find out the ratio of the active bicarbonate ingredient to the mass of the whole product(baking soda), then i would need to recalculate my new baking soda/cocaine ratio; 1 : 11.4(+/-)<br /><br />Am i doing it right?

Will something called Baking Powder work if it has one or two of the substances needed; potato starch, inflating ingredient, disodium diphosphate, sodium hydrogen carbonate (danish: natriumhydrogencarbonat)?<br /><br />Isn&#039;t the sodium hydrogen carbonate the same as sodium bicarbonate or usual baking soda?<br /><br />Lastly, if i find out the ratio of the active bicarbonate ingredient to the mass of the whole product(baking soda), then i would need to recalculate my new baking soda/cocaine ratio; 1 : 11.4(+/-)<br /><br />Am i doing it right?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, you&#039;re right, sodium hydrogen carbonate = sodium bicarbonate = Baking Soda<br /><br />This is the net reaction :<br /><br />Coc-H+Cl− + NaHCO3 → Coc + H2O + CO2 + NaCl<br /><br />Use baking soda because it&#039;s just sodium bicarbonate.&nbsp; The other ingredients you mentioned don&#039;t matter, they&#039;ll get washed away as freebase forms.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use baking powder because it has both sodium bicarbonate and an acidifying ingredient already mixed.&nbsp; The acidifying ingredient that you use sodium bicarb for is cocaine powder, so a mix of sodium bicarb and an acidic activating agent prevents you from using cocaine as the activating agent, so stick with pure Na bicarb aka baking soda.<br /><br />Get the molar masses from the above equation and you can determine mass ratio of sodium bicarbonate and cocaine.
