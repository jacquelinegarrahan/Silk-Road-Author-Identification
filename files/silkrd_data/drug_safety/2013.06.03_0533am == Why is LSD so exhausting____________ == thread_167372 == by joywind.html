				well in my experience, it can certainly be exhausting 10 hours into the trip when you&#039;re starting to come down, especially if you&#039;ve been out and about.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yoblack&#039;s point is very good too!&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe I have usually had active outdoor trips, and then all those deep thoughts analysing yourself combined, has left me feeling knacked!&nbsp; - refreshed in a different way maybe a few days later.<br /><br />

				hmmm... well it&#039;s exhausting to me because I usually think alot, don&#039;t eat, and stay up for about 12 hours straight (Also, I take it at night, usually when i should be winding down my day).&nbsp; I mean... your body only functions for about that amount of time per day so why not be tired?

				Exactly what yoblack said.<br />Internal thoughts still use energy - though to a lesser degree than muscular movements. When I first took LSD I was so tired when I got home, felt like my brain was on overdrive and I didn&#039;t even take a big hit. Also try and drink water and eat food to replenish!

				I wouldnt say LSD is physically exhausting but more mentally. Youre thinking about a lot while on L which you probably need to digest a little bit after your trip. Physically I always feel fine after tripping unless I take LSD at night but then its more the feeling of being awake for so long, thats why I usually take LSD early in the morning so I dont change my regular sleeping rhythm.

				I like to go for a intense 30/35 minutes run at the beginning, in the come up, gives me very vitalizing feelings and sensations. Then throw myself in a pool or ocean naked, be there for a while and then move on with my full trip. All this in night time.

				I dont find LSD exhausting at all, I agree with everyone else that is invigorating, like a breath of fresh air. I realized that taking it early in the morning helps to not make it tiresome.&nbsp; I used to only trip at night and then figured out that I had to sleep longer once the trip was over.&nbsp;

				I used to be utterly exhausted the day after an acid trip. The morning after my first real trip, I ate breakfast straight out of the fridge, laying on the floor, and then stayed there for about an hour before I dragged my ass to the couch for a nap. The physical exhaustion wasn&#039;t as bad as the mental fatigue. I could barely think and had absolutely no patience for other people. This effect was constant regardless of when I dosed, how I dosed, whether I smoked weed or not, what I did on the trip or even the purity of the acid.<br /><br />At some point, though, the fatigue effect stopped. I&#039;m not exactly &quot;refreshed&quot; the day after, but I feel fairly normal. A little spacey, but functional. I don&#039;t really know what caused the change. Possibly just experience. The same batch of L that had me floored the next day now leaves me feeling just fine. A few variables have changed, though. I was already eating&nbsp; normally during my trips, but now I make sure to have a half-gallon of orange juice and some gatorade on hand, and I pop a couple of 5-htp before I go to bed. I also fast for about 8 hours before I take the acid now, which seems to cut down on a lot of the come-up side effects for me (that and a couple of beers).
