				Hi SR.<br /><br />This is my first post here, and i had ordered many times from here.<br /><br />But here is my question, in your opinion, who is the best combination of drugs for a rave? Electronic party.<br /><br />So, i have tried: Cocaine, Weed, Ketamine, MDMA, Alcohol, LSD, 25c-nbome. <br /><br />Now im waiting for some nintendos pills and some good ketamine. But im looking the best combo for a rave, you know, i wanna have the party of my life, but i have no idea who is the best combination.<br /><br />My next combination will be MDMA and short pieces of ketamine insulfated in the peak of MDMA.<br /><br />But im thinking that the best must be with speed or 2c-b, i dont know, i wanna see your experiencies and, principally who is the best combination in your opinions.<br /><br />Thanks and Merry Christmas.

				Not to be overly simplistic but just adding some MDA to the MDMA can make for a fun ride. MDMA alone makes me lovey while MDA adds a bit more visuals and a bit more of a physical push to touch and feel things. Lots of other combos out there, just tossing this one in early since most the MDMA I used to do in the old days was cut with MDA so that X feeling I liked so much was always a combo of the two.

				id try mixing a small amount of mushrooms with it. thats a very fun and social trip<br /><br />i was referring to an old press that went around called pokeballs<br />it was your normal pill image press on front of whatever and a line with a dot in the middle resembling a pokeball on the back.<br />they were always guaranteed to be high MDMA pills cut with ketamine that went around the west coast a couple years ago for a long time<br />until people started making pipe(fake) pokeball pills.<br /><br />who are you going to go see? or is it a show with local and unknown djs

				MDMA and K is my fave combo for a rave, as the K adds this incredible spacey trippy feeling that gets you flying on the dance floor as long as you don&#039;t overdo it.

				MDMA and K- my first roll bah it was awesome! (fucking red transformer from Canada, if anybody puts a roll like that up I will buy and love you forever)<br /><br />2c-b is probably my favorite drug or at least top 3 (DMT Weed 2cb)<br /><br />its trippy, uplifting, feels damn good, youll have fun definatly suggest.&nbsp; <br /><br />But MDMA and K in the right proportions is awesome and I think youre on the right path

				I posted a similar thread and it seems like MDMA with speed, meth, 2cb and K seems to be the most popular opinions around

				If your party is lasting long enough, LSD + MDMA (candyflip) - classic for a reason&nbsp; ;D

				Sorry for the time i tooked to answer.<br /><br />So, thanks all for your answers.<br /><br />Last night i tried this combo mdma + ketamine<br /><br />I took 2 pill from and unknown pills, cause i have think that they will be lower. OK, i have 4 gr of ketamine for my and a friend. So I started drinking some alcohol somking some weed. <br /><br />The pills hits and im happy like never, but, this mdma isnt the same i bought on sr its a different effect i cant explain but i preffer the mdma from sr all the way, i bought these because the nintendo i bought didnt arrived yet.<br /><br />I started a little snorts of ketamine. So i was euphoric happy and with close eyes visuals, really visuals like piramids with eyes, triangles with eyes, full of colors, i countinued tooking ketamine and i was OK, in a moment of the night the pill start to c omedown (a little early i dont know why) i continue tooking ketamine the disocciation was very, and i go to other party, and took another pill, and drink beer, smoking a lot, and, i continued tooking ketamine but, i cant remember how much i took since i take a big one... i wass sooo confused, soo crazy, i was having hallucinations like i was in other place, confused, like im dying, i willl fall dawn and i will die, i cant recognize to my friend, i was on a bad trip, for moments i went to the k hole.<br /><br />I dont know whay after that night i was sooo depressed, big headhache, i was with nausea for more time that the usual when i took ketamine. And i went to home, my friend continue taking K but i dont want more for the night my head is killing me, i think that this is beacuse i drink alcohol, the pill i took to much and i dont know what are made of. I took early that day 25c too. And a little snorts of cocaine at the end of the night.<br /><br />I think that a great combination is a GOOD pill, with LITTLE and CONTROLED snorts of ketamine, if you took too much, i will be disocciated and you&nbsp; will lost the effects of the pill. <br /><br />What do you think people?<br />

				Wondering if anyone could give some advice..<br />I&#039;ve tried K with some MDMA and loved it.<br />But what would K be like with a combo of MDA (50mg) + MDMA (100mg)? Anyone tried this?

				MDMA + Mushrooms! It&#039;s like a happy trippy awesome colorful wonderland. Lots of energy, excitement, and social stimulation from the MDMA, and a lot of fun, mellow yet interesting trippiness added from the mushrooms :)

				Personally, I think 2C-B is great to go out on things like, New Year&#039;s Eve. I&#039;ve had a blast at bars, and I wasn&#039;t even drinking (just 2C-B). HAven&#039;t gone out using Ket, and I don&#039;t think I would want to - it seems a strange combo - social activity and Ket.

				Thanks to all for your answers<br /><br />MDMA + ketamine its a good combo but you must take little snorts of ketamine, when the pills comedown then u can starting to take more<br /><br />MDMA + ghb, im going to try this combo, how do u think is the best way? i read and its says that the best combination is taking the GHB (im going to take a 5ml vial) after two hours of the peak of the pill, how will be the effect? eufforic? more empathy? and, how i can take the GHB? in the water? direct from the vial?<br /><br />Thanks

				strongxxx<br />do it in a shot size glass of water, if you drink it neat/concentreted its not very pleasant. watered down to 25ml was my standard.<br />i&#039;d fit 10 doses in a 250ml mouthwash bottle, with a little splash of blue food colouring and a drop of peppermint extract.<br />id carry it into a club along with an old toothbrush and never got questioned about it when they looked in the bag
