				Since I haven&#039;t seen a lot of reports on 2c-t-7 (aka &quot;Blue Mystic&quot;), I thought I&#039;d write up my own experiences along with what I learned from my research.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to hear from others: I&#039;d also be happy if we had a number of threads concerning various psychedelics and other drugs sold on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />2c-t-7 has a reputation for being idiosyncratic in its reaction. Two people can split a 50mg bag: the guy who swallows 40mg feels mildly altered while his friend is barely able to put out a coherent sentence after 10. I&#039;ve found this to be true even between doses.&nbsp; I vaped 20mg and had one of the best visual trips I&#039;ve ever had, albeit with a mildly uncomfortable body load. A couple weeks later 10mg made me twitchy, tense and dysphoric - like AM-2201 anxiety combined with fuzzy thought processes and an anti-aesthetic visual effect that made everything around me look remarkably dull and squalid.&nbsp; While the trip improved after 2mg of clonazepam, it remained mildly unpleasant at best throughout the experience. (By contrast, I&#039;ve always had at least an enjoyable time on 2c-b after the rough comeup subsides).&nbsp; <br /><br />I found 2c-t-7 to be much more visual than 2c-b or even 2c-e. But where 2c-b gives me a very extroverted and outgoing experience, t-7 is much more introverted and introspective. It&#039;s also far less erotic than 2c-b: 2c-t-7 doesn&#039;t really make me feel sexual at all. In some ways I think it&#039;s a more useful psychedelic for consciousness exploration and therapeutic work.&nbsp; There&#039;s a greater depth to the mental and emotional headspace and a more profoundly spiritual feeling, at least for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve sold the last of the t-7, I&#039;m not entirely sure I&#039;m going to re-up.&nbsp; I may keep some around for personal use, as I think it&#039;s a very profound and useful compound in the right set and setting.&nbsp; But the safety profile worries me. People have died from snorting 30mg of this stuff or from combining it with MDMA.&nbsp; (It appears to have an MAOI effect in some people that can do some really nasty shit when combined with other stimulants).&nbsp; My MO on Silk Road is to be a small and unobtrusive vendor, one who is so small-time that it wouldn&#039;t be worth the LEO efforts required to locate him.&nbsp; If some college kid decides to hoover 100mg of my t-7 and dies therefrom, the Grand Wizard is suddenly a much more valuable target.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t want to wind up being called a &quot;scammer&quot; because I sold to someone who was t-7 resistant and who assumes I sent baking powder.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d welcome any comments on experiences from other people.&nbsp; This is definitely a compound worthy of further study, and I&#039;d like to see some serious psychonauts making the exploration.

				I want to try this drug just for the positive feelings it produces, but I really like living and do not know how I&#039;ll react to it. Reports I&#039;ve read on erowid state that people have gotten violent on only 10mg. No thanks.

				I am still sitting on the sample of this that I got from you.<br />Its one of those things that I have this intense urge to try but at the same time I have a deep fear it.<br />I have had way to many bad trips in my life on drugs that I knew wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; kill me. (it is easy to handle a bad trip if you know that you will be fine in a few hours, but with something like this, you don&#039;t know what the next minute will bring. and that knowledge in itself can be enough to incite a bad trip)<br />and I would hate to have a bad trip on a RC of known dubiousness<br /><br />If I were you, I would re up just to keep some on hand for personal use and special requests. (it really is a rare and peculiar molecule)<br />But I would not sell it to people without first evaluating their competence<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know that it could be vaped though. and I am tempted to try it via route at a threshold dose. But I will have to research the specific caveats of that ROA before I attempt it. <br />Either way, I have a feeling that this will be in my medical bag for a while. waiting for that perfect moment.

I also got a lot of Baroque and Rococo CEVs and some gorgeous multicolored patterning in my OEVs that looked like Persian/Arabic geometrical patterns.<br /><br />During my second (negative) experience this worked in reverse.&nbsp; Everything around me looked incredibly dingy, dull and drab, like it was covered with a layer of dust and a thick psychic grime.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t frightening so much as unpleasant. The best way I can describe it is the world looked like cooking cabbage and stale tobacco smoke smell.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The bodyload for 2c-t-7 is heavier than the 2c-b load: I definitely had to deal with nausea and discomfort on both come-ups.&nbsp; And where the bodyload from 2c-b often manifests itself (to me) as warm fuzzies and MDMA-like sensitivity to touch, this one is just uncomfortable.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as bad as the load I get from 2c-e or 2c-i, and it fades as the experience settles in and you reach plateau. But it&#039;s definitely there.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the reasons I didn&#039;t talk much about my experiences with t-7 is because it&#039;s such an introspective drug.&nbsp; A lot of the time I spent on t-7 I spent up in my own head and includes a lot of stuff I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable sharing.&nbsp; Not bad things, just personal stuff that wouldn&#039;t mean much to anyone else but which was extremely useful for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;For me t-7 is not at all a social drug: in that respect it&#039;s much more like LSD than MDMA.<br /><br />The unpleasant experience I had was not by any means what I would call a &quot;bad trip.&quot;&nbsp; There was no overwhelming sense of panic, no feeling that I had lost control or that demons were taking over my mind.&nbsp; The main problem was a persistent irritation and (for lack of a better phrase) cosmic boredom. I took a klonopin an hour in because I knew the experience can last for 6+ hours: I probably would have ridden it out on 2c-b because b is pretty short-acting.<br /><br />As I said, I definitely like 2c-t-7 and want to keep some around for a personal stash. But I feel it&#039;s an ally one needs to approach with caution and respect. Let me know if you have any other questions and I&#039;ll gladly answer to the best of my abilities.

				Thanks for the details, sounds like quite the beast.<br /><br />It&#039;s funny that you said 2c-e had a body load, I felt so empty on it, compared to the other 2cs. The visually were pretty spectacular, crazy colors were my favorite part but I didn&#039;t feel there was much to learn from it, the headspace was extremely clear.<br /><br />2c-i used to have one of the most annoying body loads. It comes in waves, muscle tension and a slight agitation. I found that the more I used 2c-i this diminished which I figured is due to me and the drug learning about each other. I&#039;m prepared for the waves now and it&#039;s like an old friend coming up behind you and giving you a hug.&nbsp; The headspace on this one is great, very empathetic and can be introspective.<br /><br />2c-b there is a bit of a body load, usually just muscle tension for me, mostly in my back. Can&#039;t go wrong with 2c-b.&nbsp; feelsgoodman.jpg<br /><br />2c-t-2 I found similar to 2c-i, but I don&#039;t remember much of a body load at all.&nbsp; The visuals were quite interesting for me, similar to the &quot;under water&quot; feeling of 2c-i with a different sort of ripple pattern.<br /><br />Such a wonderful family to study.

As I got over that I found that the world had turned into various lovely shades of pastel, complete with rare tropical birds singing in the distance.&nbsp; It only lasted for a few seconds, but it&#039;s the closest thing to an opium vision I&#039;ve ever had from a 2c-*.&nbsp; I smoked a bit more over the next hour (about 20mg total over the night) but never recaptured that trip to Xanadu, although music sounded delightful and the headspace was intellectually stimulating and very pleasant.&nbsp; <br /><br />I strongly suspect that vaping it causes the same kind of MAO inhibition that snorting does, although it&#039;s almost certainly a less efficient delivery system.&nbsp; So I would argue for erring on the side of caution when vaping 2c-t-7.&nbsp; <br /><br />The effects lasted for about 6 hours total, with about 2-3 hours of plateau and 3-4 hours of fadeout.&nbsp; The comedown was actually not bad, although it was difficult to sleep.&nbsp; But it appears 2c-t-7 lasts considerably longer than 2c-b no matter how you consume it.
