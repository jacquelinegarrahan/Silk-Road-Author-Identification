				So I obtained 75 bitcoins... I decided too order 2 grams of DMT from trojan and 2 grams of synthetic mescaline hlc from gammagobin (or something). I am also getting a gram of heroin from no genrx.<br /><br />I have only done acid and shrooms, is DMT really intense? It is DMT-NN (or -NH). I would smoke/possibly IV it.<br /><br />Im also wondering the same about mescaline.

				you dont IV freebase DMT, needs to be fumurate and very clean... i&#039;d not suggest trying unless you know what your doing<br /><br />and yes, DMT can be very intense (far more than LSD/shrooms). best advice is to just accept and relax, its a hell of a ride, don&#039;t expect anything

				DMT is going to fucking knock your consciousness straight out of the ballpark mate, but in a good way. ;) Don&#039;t pussy out though, it&#039;s only for a half hour tops! :P

				DwarfSeeker is right but of course any salt can be made of DMT but fumarate is by far the most stable and easiest to work with. Methinks if you could source some fumaric acid you would know more than to think of IVing straight freebase, so I&#039;d pop it in a vaporiser and blast off.<br />It will be NN-DMT (obviously depending on purity). I have never had the honour of trying acid but in terms of sheer intensity it blows shrooms so far out the water they are in danger of becoming lodged in Geosynchronous orbit. Don&#039;t find, listen to some calming instrumental music, keep the lights off and dont panic!<br />Enjoy

				DMT is my favorite psychedelic! It only lasts for 15mins ora little longer depending on dose. Very unique. You get laser sharp psychedelic vision and CIVs are simply astonishing. There is also a full body roll that comes along with it.<br /><br />DMT produced in the pineal gland and is secreted during birth/death/sleeping<br /><br />Have fun!

				Strasssman isn&#039;t the only researcher that has reviewed dmt. Dmt is in trace amounts in a few animals including humans. It is analogous to serotonin and melatonin which isproduced in the pineal glad. Therefore, it should be in the pineal gland.<br /><br />Either way, it is synthesized in my house and i can manually put it in min brain. So I&#039;m fine.

There are many weird reactions that are theoretically possible within the human body, but that doesn&#039;t mean they happen. No one has proved it thus far, if you have seen a study that I might have missed please feel free to link it here. I don&#039;t mind being proven wrong, but repeating the same mess that Joe Rogan spouts as fact is a no-no.

				That seems kinda strange to me. I&#039;m not sure how prepared you are for these experiences. I&#039;d feel better if you were willing to post more about your previous drug experiences; only having done lsd and shrooms before bodes poorly in my opinion.<br /><br />Mescaline is one of the mildest drugs you can ever take. If there ever was a drug appropriate for first-time trippers, it is mescaline. I don&#039;t mean mild as in you won&#039;t enjoy it, but rather that the come-up is very gentle and that the experience is overall enjoyable.<br /><br />DMT is extremely intense when you smoke it. It is supposedly even more intense when injected, though based on the questions you&#039;re asking I don&#039;t think you should be attempting to convert the freebase to a salt. If you don&#039;t enjoy nausea, DMT may come as a surprise for you. DMT gave me the most intense nausea I&#039;ve felt in my entire life, even more intense than times I actually did throw up (I didn&#039;t throw up). It completely replaced my field of vision, and when I could see again every object in existence had somehow been turned into a face. It can be extremely interesting, but I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s enjoyable and I don&#039;t feel like there is usually time for a whole lot of thinking during the experience. I really think you ought to consider the decision to take DMT for a while longer before just jumping in; make sure you really want to do it. The first time I did it I thought I had actually died, which was literally the scariest experience of my life.<br /><br />Heroin is pretty interesting. You didn&#039;t mention what type of heroin you got, but I&#039;m going to presume it&#039;s #4. #4 is good for eating, snorting, and injecting. I&#039;ve eaten and snorted #4, and I&#039;ve also smoked #3. Of those three ROAs, I enjoy smoking the most. The things to watch out for are compensating for tolerance (that can be dangerous if you overcompensate), and addiction. I haven&#039;t run into problems with either, yet, but I certainly see how it would be possible for somebody to do so.<br /><br />You should probably do some more research, dude. Pretty much all the information you need to know is on websites like Erowid.com. You can find a lot of really interesting information there, particularly via the experience reports. Be careful, though.
