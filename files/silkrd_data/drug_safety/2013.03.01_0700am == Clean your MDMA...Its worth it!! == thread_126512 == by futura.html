				<br /><br />Started with .387 grams brown sand mdma. Placed in mortar and pestle and ground very fine...added 20 ml &quot;ANHYDROUS&quot;(IT MUST BE WATER FREE!!) Acetone, crushed mdma further with pestle, let sit then decanted off acetone and saved it&nbsp; leaving behingd cleaned mdma,repeated twice more. Added 160 Degree F Distilled Water to cleaned MDMA to flash vape off any residual acetone, fan evaporated water, and scraped up cleaned MDMA yielding .222 Grams. <br /><br />Evaporated Acetone yielding a yellowish oily substance (Sass oil??) and some blackish goo?? (See Pics) The hair is probably mine as I did not filter acetone before evaping...I did filter Water and also covered evap dish with pantyhose to prevent dust and hair from getting in it while evaping.&nbsp; <br /><br />SOOOOOO...This is what MDMA is supposed to look like!!! Hey alll you chemists out there...I know you probably dont want to do the final washes and lose 10-40% of your product...But please do..I had like 30-40% crap in my MDMA that should have never left the lab...<br /><br />And dont get me wrong...I am not knocking Magic Celos stuff. It was ok before the cleaning...Its just killer now!!! from the pics I have seen posted on SR I am guessing almost no chemist does the final washes as they are all from dark to light brown...<br /><br />MDMA people should be an off white crystal if simply washed properly. You could even go further and get an opaque needlepoint type crystal with a &quot;Sonicator&quot; and a dual solvebt RE-X, but triple acetone washing leaves a pretty pure product if thats all that you can do.<br /><br /><br />Demand your MDMA is washed...or wash it yourself.<br /><br />It is so much more enjoyable when cleaned!!<br /><br />Quote from: sl1pknot on March 01, 2013, 11:33 pm<br /><br />Advice on obtaining anhydrous acetone?<br /><br />The best way is to get regular acetone and dry it yourself...You can get acetone anywhere...but stay away from the beauty supply stuff for nails...try Home Depot, a paint store or any local hardware store (at least in the USA!!)<br /><br />To remove water from acetone(dont beleve the can even if it says 100% Acetone it still has water in it!!) all you have to do is:<br /><br />Get some regular Epsom Salts, turn oven on to 400 Degrees F. Put sheeet of aluminum foil on bottom rack and cover with a thin layer of the epsom salts. Leave in oven with oven still on for 2 hours. Turn oven off...DO NOT OPEN DOOR till its cooled down so it does not absorb moisture. (You can store this poswder in a sealed tight mason jar.) <br /><br />Add appox. 30 grams of this powder to a mason jar, add can of acetone, put aluminum foil on top of jar, then rubber disc with seal, then screw lid tight, shake well, and put in freezer overnight shaking occasionaly.(aluminum foil beneath lid is important or acetone will dissolve rubber seal!!)<br /><br />You can then either filter contents of jar thru buchner vacum funnel using 103 slow filter paper (I find I have to do this once, then let sit for 24 hours and do again to get fine particles out)...OR instead of filtering you can just use a syringe, or glass turkey baster or even a glass dropper to pull off as much dry acetone as you need to use off top of jar without disturbing the fine powder on the bottom of jar...<br /><br />Just remember try to do all of this as quickly as possible as the dry acetone wants to suck water out of the air!!<br /><br />And lastly when cleaning your MDMA...dont panic, you will not see any MDMA crystals forming in the evap dish till 99%+ of the water is evaporated...and be patient...do not try and speed evap up with heat!!!<br />

				Thanks much for doing this. Wish this practice was more common as dosing would be much more standardized though at this point I&#039;m just happy to be able to buy product on here that isn&#039;t cut with weak shit.
