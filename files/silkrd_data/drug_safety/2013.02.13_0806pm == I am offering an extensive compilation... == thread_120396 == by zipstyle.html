				Of drug-related wisdoms and practices that I&#039;ve put together over my time here on SR and on the internet in general. If anyone is interested, I would be more than happy to share them with you. And if you like them, I would request that you give a me a small donation for my time and efforts spent to make a guide that is organized and informative. <br /><br />Again, IT IS FREE. Just ask and I&#039;ll send it to you. <br />I am just putting the consideration out there in case someone wants to give back.<br /><br />Thank you :)

				Just curious about which drugs you&#039;re studying and the kind of format the compilation is in? Kind of like a user guide to each drug, or more a summary of effects?<br /><br />Finally, do you personally try every drug you research?<br /><br />Will definitely donate next time I put in coins &lt;3

				It&#039;s a text file, covers psychedelics, stimulants, benzos, and nootropics. <br />Both user guide and description of effects. <br /><br />Yes, I have personally tried all the drugs I research :)<br />Otherwise, how would I be able to talk about them? <br /><br />I&#039;ll send you the files via PM if I can...

				Hey,<br />I&#039;d just like to chime in and say that after a brief scan through these documents, they are really interesting and written very well. Particularly the discussion on addiction, and also the LSD and MDMA therapy info.

Some people have been able to ask me questions and get detailed advice in return. I would love to post the link publicly, but for now I will refrain from doing so. Any additional suggestions, comments, criticisms, etc are welcome, of course.<br /><br />much love to all.

				Wow, I&#039;m kinda flattered that there is a good amount of interest in this still. ::blush::<br /><br />Ok so for those of you who are interested...I am in the process of putting together a considerably comprehensive guide on research chemicals (I am trying to encompass the most popular and major groups) for medical health professionals facing Emergency Room type situations. The focus will be on overdose diagnosis (so they don&#039;t just assume the kid that overdosed on 25i is schizo) but I will also be discussing the differences between the classical drugs and the newer ones. Ex: bk-MDMA or Methylone or 6-APB vs MDMA. <br /><br />Anyways, that will be my newest and possibly last addition to my document compilation. I have put out so much information on these forums that my post history should reveal quite a bit of the information and knowledge that I possess. I hope it is helpful to others! <br /><br />Anyways, I still have the link handy to the old compilation, the new version should be done within the next month or two.<br />All the best!

				Zippyyyyy ZIP style, <br />I want to thank you again for sharing your knowledge and taking the time to put this together. You are so very sweet... in fact:<br /><br />You&#039;re so sweet like cinnamon that i could lick you up and take you like a vitamin.<br /><br />

				This sounds interesting, mind if I grab a copy?<br /><br />Not sure if people are still worried about potential security problems with this file but for the 2 mains problems I think I may have a suggestion. <br /><br />To combat the idea that zip style is somehow connecting downloads with user handles (I don&#039;t see the issue myself, why not wait a week or so access the file if you think he is watching, or access it multiple times from different exit nodes. In either case I still don&#039;t see the problem? What difference does it make if he can see a tor connection to a site? its no secret we are using tor and it makes no difference, surely if a given username does access the site? If that is STILL an issue for you...well make a new account and PM zipstyle for the link. Personally I think that&#039;s a bit of a non-issue.<br /><br />As for the contents of the file, I do agree its not ideal that everyone gets a link individually but I don&#039;t think that should be too hard to deal with. Why not ask a respected member of the community who is tech-savvy enough to open the pdf in a secure environment and check it out. Then they simply sign the file and we all get a measure of security.

				Coming here to leave an update on what&#039;s going on with the compilation:<br />I plan on going through it and revising some things, adding some more, so on and so forth just to make sure it&#039;s current with all the new research and experiences I&#039;ve been having. Seems like there will be quite a bit of work to do in this department and that it&#039;ll take a while, but know that this project ain&#039;t dead, it&#039;s just beginning!<br /><br />much love
