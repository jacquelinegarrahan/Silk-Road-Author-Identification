				I&#039;m looking to create INTENSE rolls with this MDMA for 420 :)<br /><br />I&#039;m going out with my friends and I&#039;m making the doses in the capsules as we speak. <br /><br />I&#039;m looking to make it as intense as possible, without it being overwhelming. Not having sampled tony&#039;s mdma before, how much would you recommend for a dose?<br /><br />Right now, each capsule has 190mg-170mg. I can change that if need be. Do you think that would be too much, perfect, less? <br /><br />I don&#039;t feel comfortable going above that. On top of the MDMA, hash/good bud will be used. This should combat any nausea. <br /><br /><br />Being fairly well versed drug users, were taking all the necessary precautions, as well as making sure we drink enough water :)<br /><br />GOD BLESS 420!

				It seems to vary greatly. I took 150mg and rolled really good but I gave my friend 130 and he barely even rolled.but we also are about 30 lbs apart.&nbsp; I dont know I say 170-190 should be pretty good. Most people that review his stuff that arent heavy users seem to be dosing around 170-200. Please let us know how it goes.

				If you take a larger dose, you won&#039;t feel the effects of the weed as much.. This just comes from personal experience.<br />Whenever I roll, I end up smoking all my hash instantly. <br /><br />I&#039;d do 150mg - 180mg, smoke a bit. Then put it away and save it for the come down. <br />I don&#039;t see the point of being supper high on THC and MDMA. Other than maybe a very intense rushes of euphoria?

				I&#039;ve just weighed out and dropped 200mg of dmtdoodeelsd&#039;s MDMA, dropped around 20 mins ago. Can start to feel the rush... I normally take around 200 - 250mg&nbsp; as I have a high tolerance. It depends on weight and tolerance... I weigh around 210 pounds and I&#039;m 6&#039;3.

				kinda late, but for anyone else reading about dosing:<br /><br />225 mg may be too much for some people imo... especially if you have a smaller body type or do not have any tolerance to serotonergic compounds.<br /><br />experience has shown the sweet spot for many people for pure mdma is around 125-150 mg. then if you want to intensify the effects after 45 min or so, then just down another 40-60 mg of the molly. or snort 15-20 mg but be warned it will burn like youre a dragon<br /><br />also, i have found bud to kinda dull down the edge somewhat which takes away some of the magic

				I&#039;d suggest 1.5mg for 1kg of body weight based on http://thedea.org/letsroll.html<br />That&#039;s if MDMA quality is great.

				Thanks for all the replies! It seems like anything anything between 130 and 160 should do the trick. Would you recommend a redose? I assume it depends on how you are feeling, but how long after the initial dose would you consider doing a re-dose if you aren&#039;t rolling yet.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to re-dose too early, assuming it&#039;s necessary, and then get overwhelmed because I did it too soon. And I will definitely update after I try it. Hopefully next weekend!

				I&#039;d say take re-dose of 60mg as you&#039;re peaking... No more though,taking more after that won&#039;t do anything for you... it&#039;s a waste of drugs and will only make the come down worse

				When I take MDMA I usually redose an hour after feeling a bit shitty (+6h after initial dose). I usually take 150-200% of the dose I initially took, and this feels great, although not as good as the initial roll.

				I&#039;m about 145lbs and pretty thin (not sure if that matters). Anyway I plan to take some of Tony&#039;s mdma at EDC and I want the perfect roll as well. The last time I rolled was in January with methylone. Would 150mg be good? I could always redose 45 minutes in (50-60mg?). How long does Tony&#039;s mdma usually last for you guys?

				I still haven&#039;t tried Tony&#039;s MDMA myself yet but all my friends who took .160s said it was awesome, several have a high tolerance too. Went out to a show last night and two girls who took .160s said it hit them really hard but didn&#039;t last as long. The other guys and I all took schizo&#039;s defqons and had an amazing night.
