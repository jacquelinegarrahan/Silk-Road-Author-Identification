				phew, i made 50 posts just to ask this question, yes it&#039;s important to me. :D<br /><br />i have stomach acid resistant capsules and i want to try taking them filled with a crushed pill in it, but i&#039;m a little conserned if i should take way less than a normal dose for my weight would be because it will be reabsorbed way better from the small intestine directly and not get destroyed by the stomach acid partially and then moving to the small intestine (small bowel? - d√ºnndarm halt ;) i hope it&#039;s clear what i mean). somewhere i red that only about 1/3 of the MDMA taken orally is acually going into the blood stream, is this correct or bullshit?<br /><br />i searched for this topic (only on german speaking internet tho) but with little to no result, there is one thread on a clearnet forum about this exact matter but that does not lead to any answer.<br /><br />also would dissolve in water and taken as retention enema provide exactly the same effect as acid resistant capsules? i would guess it could be different because of the lower parts of the bowel are less &quot;good&quot; in reabsorbing things than those parts that come directly behind your stomach? i know the whole bowel mucous membrane is very receptive happy but the lower parts normally don&#039;t have the mission to get the nutritions out of the food...<br /><br />finally, what do you think on an relativitly empty stomach how long will it take for the capsule to reach the small intestine and dissolve there? i would guess at least 2h++?<br /><br />(sorry if my english is not that good here and there, i&#039;m doing my best, long time out of school :P)

				I understand your intention with acid resistant capsules, but my own personal experience has led me to believe that even regular gelatin capsules are responsible for less than optimal absorption of MDMA and MDA compared to simply drinking or swallowing it in paper tissue. Have you tried that method? I find that 120-140 mg can absolutely floor me without a gelcap, while gel capped doses routinely fall short in &quot;wow&quot; factor.<br />Also nothing tops plugging it in the butt, but for me that isn&#039;t suitable for social situations. I find plugging can reduce the amount needed for desired effects by 20-40 mg (up to 1/3 less).

				why should they lead to a suboptimal absorption? i mean they open up in your small intestine only, because of how they made, and freeing the substance. i would guess this rather leads to a MUCH better absorption because no stomach acid or way less of it comes in contact with it...<br /><br />of course i tried the &quot;standard&quot; way of just swallowing a pill with very much water (and fast because even if you are REALLY fast with drinking they always &quot;explode&quot; inside my throat which is ok tho... just a little bitter ;) )<br />there is nothing wrong with that method, in fact i would always do it like that.<br /><br />the main question for me is if it is true or not that only 1/3 of the MDMA molecules get&#039;s to the blood stream when going through the stomach (acid) first, that would be a huge waste of material, don&#039;t you think?<br /><br />i can handle 200mg perfectly fine (had 2x 120mg as the initial dose once, that was also ok) but i should say that my body weight is about 120-125kg (187,5 mg @ 1,5mg/kg) i even think that 300mg would be ok, but maybe not in a bad setting (club) at home this should not lead to very bad (side)effects or worse, but i&#039;m not willing to try that anyway.<br /><br />the problem is with the large pauses you need (or let&#039;s say i want) to make (6-8 weeks but that is just my instinct telling me this is what i should do) i don&#039;t want to ruin my experience ether way. taking like 100mg and landing somewhere where i would have been with 300mg or taking 100mg and being disappointed because they have the same effect as 100mg regularly swallowed (as you all know re-dosing is not working well because of how MDMA works, so the initial dose is the most important thing). hopefully that makes sense, still a little bit unsure about my english skills :)<br /><br />in short i don&#039;t want to underdose nether i want to overdose which would be much worse of course.<br /><br />i&#039;m feeling <br />Kaycee - Unsolved Mysteries (Elektrochemie LK Remix)<br />in this topic :D

				There would be little reason to shield mdma from the stomach acids, as it is stable in those acidic conditions. <br /><br />Capsules that are stomach resistent are usually used on medications that are absorbed in the instestine, but are not able to survive the acidic environment in the stomach. This makes perfect sense for substances that are sensitive to degradation&nbsp; by acidic environments, but mdma is not.

				thank you for your answer, also i love the silk road bus. :D<br /><br />well i quit doing MDMA entirely, my first time was about 2 month ago and i realized that it&#039;s just not my cup of tea. cannabis is, ever was and probably ever will be. i love you mary. it get&#039;s old VERY fast, the tolerance is totally INSANE and it get&#039;s me nowhere in life. also i can not understand so many people saying it&#039;s magic, there is nothing magic to it, not even on my first 2-3 times there was any kind of magic, cannabis on the other hand really brings magic to my life.

				Reading this topic&#039;s name made me laugh so hard haha.<br />Never heard of stomach acid resistant capsules until now. My instant thought was you take the pill, and then 12 hours later you pop it right back out &gt;.&lt; So much fail lmfao
