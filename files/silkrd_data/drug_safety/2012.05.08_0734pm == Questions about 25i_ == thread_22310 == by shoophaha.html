				Hello! My friend and I are thinking of doing 25i tomorrow and had a few questions. We got the 1000 ug tabs as a free sample from Foxymeow (I&#039;m assuming they&#039;re 1000 ug 25i tabs—I got them with the 2C-B smarties and they are purple—any verification from people would be cool) and were thinking of just splitting a tab as this is our first time. We&#039;ve both done shrooms and 2C-B a few times and I&#039;ve done acid once.<br /><br />a) How many hours would a trip on 500 ug last?<br />b) Does 25i have dissociative properties? My friend experienced physical dissociation on 2C-B.<br />c) How functional would we be? Can we walk around campus, or should we just stay in our room? How obvious would we be to non-trippers?<br />d) Would you recommend some weed on the come down, or will that prolong/intensify it?<br /><br />Thank you in advance for your advice!

My friend experienced physical dissociation on 2C-B.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure EXACTLY what you mean here but yes, 25i is very visual and you will see tracers on just about everything that&#039;s moving.<br /><br />c) How functional would we be? Can we walk around campus, or should we just stay in our room? How obvious would we be to non-trippers?<br /><br />You CAN walk around, (I receive the worst side affects from 25i of our whole group and its just muscle cramps in my legs) but being around people that aren&#039;t tripping feels really weird.&nbsp; I would recommend you stay in your room and just enjoy the trip because you will end up talking about nature and you will really want to go run around in the trees but promise yourselves beforehand that you are just gonna remain low key in your rooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />d) Would you recommend some weed on the come down, or will that prolong/intensify it?<br /><br />I think weed and 25i is REALLY interesting and something that hasn&#039;t been discovered yet.&nbsp; It seems that smoking weed on the comedown WILL prolong it and if you are going for lots of visuals smoking during the trip will help too.&nbsp; Personally I have never smoked during the trip but noticed that smoking a few hours after comedown brought back some mild affects.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for your advice!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I would recommend jumping in and just taking 1 tab each though, because otherwise in about an hour you won&#039;t feel much and will end up dropping another half tab each anyways&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; My answers are in the quote btw :)

				Foxy&#039;s are about 660ug each, w/HPBCD. I&#039;d take one or two. 5-9 hours. Sober/Naive people will seem arbitrary and narrow-minded in their actions and thoughts, it&#039;ll be hard to interact normally with them (more that you won&#039;t want to than that you can&#039;t). It&#039;ll also be very obvious that you&#039;ve taken something. Cannabis intensifies the visuals but may also intensify the physical discomfort.

Light OEVs at 11 hours.<br /><br />b) Does 25i have dissociative properties? My friend experienced physical dissociation on 2C-B.<br /><br />Should clarify this. But, I was having a very nice time talking to a stick for about an hour.<br /><br />c) How functional would we be? Can we walk around campus, or should we just stay in our room? How obvious would we be to non-trippers?<br /><br />My friends and I walked around town, went to stores, parks, etc. It was a good time. Kinda obvious you&#039;re not 100%, but you should be fine. <br /><br />d) Would you recommend some weed on the come down, or will that prolong/intensify it?<br /><br />Weed helps mellow your mood. As does xanax. Both are good on the comedown or if you get to feeling a bit of panic. <br /><br />Thank you in advance for your advice!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Another note, the visuals are gorgeous. And you&#039;re happy and calm. At least I was. Kinda like LSD and MDMA.

				Thanks for advice, everyone! <br /><br />As for the dissociation, this is what happened to my friend on the weed/2C-B combo: when she moved her computer mouse, she could feel herself moving her hand behind her, if that makes sense. She didn&#039;t get any mental dissociation though. We weren&#039;t expecting this effect from the 2C-B, but then weed and psychedelics have a special relationship, so who knows.
