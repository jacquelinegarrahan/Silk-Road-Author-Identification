				I&#039;m currently enjoying some coke from C&amp;C, but it feels (alot) less euphoric ;(<br />It is still a very good high, and i&#039;m sure its not the coke.<br />The taste, smell, energy and focus are exactly the same as i&#039;m used to from this vendor, and i rate his coke as very good and pure.<br /><br />Personally i&#039;m thinking my tolerance is getting higher and sadly the first thing that is affected is the euphoria.<br />I was wondering if others have had same experiences?<br /><br /><br />grts,<br /><br />sam

				Your tolerance is definitely starting to creep up on you. Using a lot of stimulants including cocaine&nbsp; quite frequently can cause a tolerance build up where you start to lose the euphoria first then pretty quickly you lose the energy and focus too. You tend to end up just doing coke for the sake of needing/wanting to do coke. At least that has been my experience with coke and other stimulants. If you have really good coke I would do a couple lines on a night out and then not touch it again for at least a week. Then when you do touch it again you will definitely get that euphoria back. Just remember, everyone reacts differently. Hope this helps.

				Notice people in your local neighbourhood who always seem to be on coke?<br /><br />That&#039;s cocaine tolerance!<br /><br />Even in the 80sw/90s when we were seeing really pure kiilos of coke, there were guys and girls who pretty much got to the point were they would snort a few grams a day! <br /><br />Yiou should always weigh cocaine, not least to see if its the right weight but also to make sure you give yourself a set amount to use. I can use 100mg for a night but sometimes I will go for months without coke, times I left it a few years even. <br /><br />I noticed tjhat&nbsp; if I used coke two nights running, the second night I&#039;d feel less high because tolerance with coke is notorious, you can use for a few days and build up a BIG tolerence. People who use weekly might do 7 grams in a weekend easily, I&#039;ve read iit on here but seen it in real life.<br /><br />Cocaine is best used as a very special treat! Birthdays, special occasions. Coke is good because you can use it anywhere and not stand out. But for me it becomes boring if used too often and right now I&#039;m leaving out the yayo for a few months, I can just go out an drink alcohol whilst I know many combine alcohol with stimulants.<br /><br />Coke is the most expensive drug also and although I&#039;m niot mean I struggle to justify the cost of coke with the actual experience. Cocaine has to be &#039;the real thing&#039; to even make you feel good and its also important you feel good when taking it, have plenty of rest, eat well and so on. <br /><br />I am lucky as I can always use something like MDMA (not had for 7 months or so) or some dexamfetamine which a few of my coke snorting workmates have started to use due to nasal problems. That is the other downside of snorting a lot of coke, your nose suffers! Most coke users do not wash out the nasal passages when finished for the night, that would help a lot of people.<br /><br />Also, try swallowing cocaine! 100mg should creep up gradually and no nasal issues or sneaking to the toliet to rail some yayo.<br /><br />I&#039;s say that anyone using coke every weekend is building up tolerance and if they leave it for a fw months they will fimnd that 100mg - 200mg&nbsp; will last a night instead of 3.5 grams!<br /><br />With coke, less is more! A lot of people do have problems with coke addiction but keep it to themselves. One of my buddies went on a coke binge years ago , daily users can build massive tolerences but I guess a lot is down to the fact its very impure cocaine. <br /><br />Luckiy for anyone using coke that more and more South Americans are selling direct which cuts out the middle men. Coke might poass throuigh a few hands so its best getting off some who speaks Latino Spanish or someone who lives in South America.<br /><br />Give up coke for a few months, its the best way to get your tolerance issues sorted out.<br /><br />It also makes sense to economise these days, save for a stormy day! <br /><br />And smoke more hash instead! Or eat it!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				funny someone mentions eating it. My best ever coke experience was mopping up some (I don&#039;t know how much) with some bread and eating it. I could get waves of euphoria just by rubbing my gut. Lasted a good long time as well.<br /><br />As for snorting it, if I get used to it, I start getting used to the curve -- become familiar with it. Familiarity breeds contempt. Instead of enjoyment, once I feel even the slightest move down from the peak, I immediately feel cracked and anxious / annoyed and start pondering just whether I&#039;m going to do a bump or leave it for the day to feel more and more shitty.<br /><br />Then I know it is time to take a few weeks off. The nice part has narrowed down to maybe 10 minutes, and the rest is either preparation, or anticipating the crap feeling to come..<br />

				Yeah you can build a high tolerance with coke for sure.<br /><br />Before you know it your having lines just to feel normal.<br /><br />So yeah good breaks from the good stuff are essential. ;)<br />
