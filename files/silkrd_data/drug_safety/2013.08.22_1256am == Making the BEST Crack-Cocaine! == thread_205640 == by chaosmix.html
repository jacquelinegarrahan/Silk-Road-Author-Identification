				Ok guys.. well, lol<br /><br />@OP, if your looking to bring it back for resale, and trying to maximize profits, your just going to have to begin to cook as often as you can. Whipping rock is like an art. You hear people say, but its not BS. The only way to do it like a pro, is to practice. You can get step by step directions, and learn it through and through on paper but that does not mean you will bring back as much as a crack dealer will when cooking. <br /><br />I can tell you the basis of how it works, how you do it from there is on you. Maybe some one will give their best advice on details. The idea is to heat up the cocaine in water, until it reaches its melting point. At which time the cocaine will become an oily/jelly like bit of mass in the water. The practice of stirring the shit, or whipping it pending on what kind of materials your working with, is to keep all that oily/jellied cocaine in a tight group. Like a bushel of grapes. Once that is all achieved, you would then have to shock it. Ice cubes or ice chips is the preferred method for this. The water has to rapidly cool, bonding together all the oily coke dots into one big piece. Let dry, break down, distribute. Done &amp; done. hehe. <br /><br />Hope that helps you along. Good luck with your endeavors.

				I bet you would, haha. The reason i was intentionally vague, was so you can learn the details on your own, through trial and error, in turn making you a master in a short time ;)<br /><br />Ill give you a few more nudges in the proper direction. Youll need; some glass, like pirex cups or bowls. A heat source, ice cubes naturally and baking soda. The coke to soda ratio is roughly 1:4 coke/soda.

				Yea OP, you better be a bad muhfucka if you plan to get into dealing rock. Dealing drugs like cocaine, crack and heroin is nothing like selling any other drugs. Maybe selling dust juice, or having a wet spot but i digress. The &#039;hard&#039; drugs like the three mentioned bring a whole new element to the drug buying/selling market; violence and aggression.

You may very well lose product. Or you may get back 2 per 1. Try and see. I meant 4:1, yes sorry about that. <br /><br />&nbsp;When you see yellow crack rocks, that actual crack cocaine rather just freebase cocaine. Ammonia is used in the process of making actual crack rocks.

				Let me do it for you and give .5 to me ;)<br /><br />When I did that total crap I just put some coke on a spoon, add ammonia (just to cover it) light it from beneath just until it boils and then scrape the basecoke out with something made from metal which is cold.<br /><br />I guess it will be the same for larger amounts.<br />Not sure if it&#039;s profitable on SR. Would seem cool to sell good base. But if coke is $100 a gram on SR it&#039;s not worth the trouble...<br /><br />Good luck!
