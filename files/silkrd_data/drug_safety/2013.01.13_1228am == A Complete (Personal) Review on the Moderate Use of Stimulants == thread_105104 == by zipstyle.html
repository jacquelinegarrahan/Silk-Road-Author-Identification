				Hello all. As I have used many different stimulants for many years, I thought it would be helpful to share my own opinions and thoughts on each of them so maybe you don&#039;t have to go through all the trial and error bs that I did. Hopefully this information is helpful to someone. I will begin with the most basic and benign and move up to what would be considered more taboo.<br /><br />Nicotine - Pleasant stimulant, can take some getting used to. Far too sedating in my opinion to be very productive, but the residual stimulation can be useful. Can induce some creativity.<br /><br />Caffeine - Used to minimize fatigue, though causes a strong crash in my opinion. Do not like the strung-out feeling I get after redosing. However, caffeine can help stimulate some creativity.<br /><br />Adrafinil (prodrug of Modafinil) - Smooth, responds best when there are stimulating situations at hand. Even at high doses doesn&#039;t feel like your heart is going very quickly, yet the tweaky feeling is still present in the eyes. Somewhat easy to fall asleep while on the substance, depends on the dose. Expensive.<br /><br />Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, etc) - At first produced very intense focus and concentration as well as rampant creativity. However, with extended use strong personality changes were apparent. Short-tempered and not myself.<br /><br />Cocaine - The first time results in strong euphoria and very inflated ego. You feel like you can take on the world, lift 1000 pounds, maybe even fucking fly. But after about 20 minutes or so of this feeling, you quickly realize what a lie that was and feel somewhat ashamed for thinking this way. A small bit more of cocaine will give you a bit more of that illusion back. But every time you do coke again you get less and less of that illusion and are left with stimulation that does little to make you feel good and doesn&#039;t last long at all.<br /><br />Racemic Amphetamine (Adderall) - Decent stimulation, with time and tolerance proved to also have harsh comedown side-effects such as heart palpitations, loss of appetite, irritability, and depression. The time on the drug was marked by some degree of anxiety and jitteryness.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Dextrostat, etc) - Smoothest amphetamine by far. Both come up and come down are smooth, very few side-effects and after-effects. <br /><br />Methamphetamine - Also quite smooth like dexamp, though slightly more euphoric. Rather than just feeling stimulated and focused, one may also experience and inflation of ego. There is also a distinct distortion of time. It is easy to feel as if you have all the time in the world but before you know it all the time is gone. The comedown isn&#039;t too bad if one does not redose, but it can be marked by a slightly sad feeling of being let down, or deflated. The day following use is somewhat difficult as there is a marked difference in functioning, though while on the drug one does not notice such a large difference between normal functioning and the functioning while on the drug. It is easy to become fixated on an idea or concept, so in order to be productive one must also be a conscientious person. Sticking to personally set rules is most important. These same rules apply to any of the other amphetamines also. Taking amps is like leasing a superman suit, which one can never realistically own unless they were born with a very overactive brain. If you&#039;re using amps, then you probably don&#039;t have this brain (lol). We all want to be superman (or woman). <br /><br />MDPV - Effective orally in low doses. Nasally is also an option, but results in the desire to redose much more strongly. Would not recommend as the comedown from redosing is the most depressive and psychotic state I&#039;ve ever experienced. It did, however, teach me to use this chemical with more respect. When used respectfully it works quite well and is best suited for times where amphetamines are not available or one needs to extend their wakefulness for a few more hours to go out. One decent sized bump (5 mg max) will allow an individual to go out drinking with friends after a long day of work or study that normally would leave you wanting to go to sleep. Extreme caution is needed for this drug to avoid the bad side effects. Although I&#039;d say MDPV is less &quot;dangerous&quot; than methamphetamine due to this very reason. The meth comedown or aftereffects are nowhere near as bad as those from MDPV (in my experience using moderate doses), so therefore it is easier to rationalize one&#039;s continued use of methamphetamine. It&#039;s a slippery slope from there.<br /><br />Ask me any other questions or leave any comments, as I&#039;m more than positive that I&#039;ve left out details or gotten some things wrong. I would be happy to elaborate on any points that I skimped on.

				I&#039;ve stuck my nose in everything you mentioned. Mephedrone is my favorite. The come downs can be hellish, but it is the only thing that gives me full blown euphoria anymore. MDMA still gets me feeling pretty decent though.<br /><br />Btw.. you forgot to reflect on MDMA. care to?

It induces the release of practically every hormone and neurotransmitter. The release of each one individually is negligible, but actually quite potent when combined. Mad addiction potential, though in a stressful situation, it&#039;d be handy to have some nicotine gum around. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg722823#msg722823">Quote from: zipstyle on January 13, 2013, 12:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Caffeine - Used to minimize fatigue, though causes a strong crash in my opinion.

I always take around a gram when using one of the heavier amphetamines since the comedown is in the shadow of it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg722823#msg722823">Quote from: zipstyle on January 13, 2013, 12:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, etc) - At first produced very intense focus and concentration as well as rampant creativity.

It&#039;s like Adderall or meth, but it isn&#039;t the Euphoria of doing work that motivates you to be productive; it&#039;s the feeling of emptiness of not doing anything that motivates you to be productive. Even when you are working,&nbsp; you still feel emptiness. and don&#039;t even get me started about the horrible comedown.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg722823#msg722823">Quote from: zipstyle on January 13, 2013, 12:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Racemic Amphetamine (Adderall) - Decent stimulation, with time and tolerance proved to also have harsh comedown side-effects such as heart palpitations, loss of appetite, irritability, and depression.

It has less positive effects and more side effects than dextroamphetamine. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg722823#msg722823">Quote from: zipstyle on January 13, 2013, 12:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Dextrostat, etc) - Smoothest amphetamine by far. Both come up and come down are smooth, very few side-effects and after-effects. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I once took a 70mg Vyvance about noon. At about seven or so, I had terrible anxiety as the effects were starting to comedown. and then even after running two hours prior, and taking a somewhat substantial cocktail of doxylamine, melatonin, and dipenhydramine, I was completely unable to fall asleep until 8:00 AM<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg722823#msg722823">Quote from: zipstyle on January 13, 2013, 12:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Methamphetamine - Also quite smooth like dexamp, though slightly more euphoric.

I actually found 30mg to be substantially less euphoric than Adderall. I also found the drug to be incredibly smooth. I never knew when the drug had hit me and when I was coming down. In fact, I found the comedown itself almost pleasant, in the subtlest of ways. <br /><br />Of the few times I consumed it, it often ended up on my tongue. I would either lick it off my scale or place a crystal on my tongue. I would then almost immediately drink some water and try to wash it down. However, is there an chance that a substantial amount could have absorbed into my tongue muscles and not have gotten into my bloodstream, or have slowly been absorbed into my blood through my tongue?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also, you should either make mention of, or make use of so you&#039;re qualified to talk about Ephedrine. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Zipstyle, you and me have a lot in common. Actually, I think you my have even said something like that in the meth safety thread. Right now, I can already picture a coalition of you and me creating &quot;Safe Methamphetamine Dosage/Usage.

				I agree, good sir!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I always appreciate your contributions to meth/stimulant related topics I post about. Your contributions are always valuable. I look forward to our collaboration :)<br /><br />As for MDMA, I can briefly discuss that, but when I get back from sleeping....been up for far too long today. :P

				<br />Not only the substance itself form an experience but the route of administration as well.<br />In other words the rate of change of the blood concentration is more important.<br />The same stuff smoked or taken iv or orally consumed bring different exp.<br />More about that in psychedelic salon podcast #103 @ matrixmasters..<br /><br />Basically to me all stims are like taking a loan - you&#039;ll be returning more than you take.<br />The only think u can have is time.

It is a drug that I think is important for all to use at least once in their lives because it provides the full surrender of the user to love. I would not necessarily classify the drug as a stimulant since for me it actually causes a sedation of sorts, especially on the comeup (this is with very pure product). I ended up always preferring the tripping experience because it made me feel like I was being awakened rather than being put to sleep, as MDMA is almost a drunken sort of loveyness. You are in a way deceived into believing that all is wonderful and beautiful and perfect and so on. And things are, from a certain perspective. And that perspective is one that is somewhat &quot;off&quot;. That&#039;s the perspective that will get you killed in the real world. Because not everything in this world or this universe is actually beautiful. Maybe the concept of it is, or the balance of beautiful to ugly or bad to good is, but it is not actually beautiful like it seems on MDMA. The experience is essential for anyone that wants to learn to be more accepting, loving, caring, etc. I know that I am able to accept others and care for others much more deeply because of my experience. But I was only shown that I have the capability to do so. The drug can only do so much, which is why I don&#039;t take it anymore. It&#039;s a great experience for your first 10-20 times. Then after that, you just want to get on the same ride again and again. Not hating, just saying it&#039;s not really my thing. Candyflipping is another story (don&#039;t do this one either, but think it&#039;s alot more productive) that I won&#039;t get into right now.<br /><br />As for ROAs:<br />I&#039;m not going to talk about nicotine or caffeine ROAs since these are pretty standard and people already know about them pretty well. You&#039;ve got your coffee, caffeine pills, gum, etc etc etc. We all know those. Let&#039;s get to the fun stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to preface this section by saying that I think it is a complete waste of your fine and lovely nostrils to put pills up your nose. The binders are inactive and do nothing but clog up your nose or fuck up your nasal cavities. For me, if I&#039;m going to put it up my nose, I only want to be putting the active drug (or a mostly pure version of that) up there. So if the drug that I discuss is most commonly in pill form, I&#039;m going to say eat it, parachute it, or plug it. Fuck crushing pills and snorting. I&#039;ve done it and it&#039;s been a stupid waste of time for me every time. But go ahead and try it yourself. You&#039;ll probably agree with me afterwards. Or maybe not, whatever.<br /><br />Ritalin - If you&#039;re going to take this drug (which I think is a waste of time anyway), just eat it or plug it. Don&#039;t waste your time snorting it in my opinion. When you snort it, it&#039;s a quick up and then a very quick and devastating down which left me in a very depressed mind state. Not fun and not worth it. Again, just my opinion. I know of many people that love to snort ritalin. Orally, it&#039;s the effects I described above.<br /><br />Adderall - Please don&#039;t snort this. You&#039;ll have colored boogers forever and the onset isn&#039;t even that much faster than letting it dissolve under your tongue or by sticking it up your butt. If you want it to hit you quicker, just stick it under your tongue or chew it. It&#039;ll produce a little more of a rush but not too much more than if you just ate it. Now my favorite is plugging this one. It takes a little while to come on if you don&#039;t put the pill in liquid and inject the liquid up there but the comeup/high is way better. If you want to snort or inject amphetamine, get some pure amphetamine salts or whatever. Don&#039;t try to do it from an adderall pill. Plugging is like WOOOOOOO :D&nbsp; stop being afraid of your butthole. It&#039;s no different than your nose or your mouth. Just wet your finger a bit, push the pill in there, and get it as far as you can. It&#039;ll then dissolve in there and go straight into your blood. And then you&#039;ll grin when you feel like you literally got kicked in the ass by a chemical. My first plugged chem was 2c-e and boy did I get kicked in the ass ;)<br /><br />MDPV - just put a little of this guy under your tongue. That&#039;s all. Snorting is shorter duration, only do this during drinking. But don&#039;t redose, which is hard to do when you&#039;re drunk. So best to just avoid it completely unless you think you can handle it.<br /><br />Meth - Haven&#039;t really done much of this one orally, but I can say that it will probably be smoother that way and less fiendish. I like the quick onset of insufflation though. Feels a little bit like the movie &quot;Spun&quot;. (clearnet) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrWD1kVi0ME&nbsp; &nbsp;Mind you, this movie totally exaggerates a MODERATE user (which is what I would consider myself to be) but I think is a somewhat decent representation of what regular, chronic use could look like. Doesn&#039;t look all that pleasant. So take care of yourselves, people. Don&#039;t binge, and keep doing all the things NORMAL PEOPLE do. Like brush your teeth, take showers, EAT. Love yourself. Use drugs to help you get ahead in life, and stop taking them when they start holding you back. Good rule of thumb.<br /><br /><br />Also to bynter: how does ephedrine compare to all these others? Never tried it.

Rather than just feeling stimulated and focused, one may also experience and inflation of ego. There is also a distinct distortion of time. It is easy to feel as if you have all the time in the world but before you know it all the time is gone. The comedown isn&#039;t too bad if one does not redose, but it can be marked by a slightly sad feeling of being let down, or deflated. The day following use is somewhat difficult as there is a marked difference in functioning, though while on the drug one does not notice such a large difference between normal functioning and the functioning while on the drug. It is easy to become fixated on an idea or concept, so in order to be productive one must also be a conscientious person. Sticking to personally set rules is most important. These same rules apply to any of the other amphetamines also. Taking amps is like leasing a superman suit, which one can never realistically own unless they were born with a very overactive brain. If you&#039;re using amps, then you probably don&#039;t have this brain (lol). We all want to be superman (or woman). </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Easily my favourite, and this is just for legitimate uses. I actually found 30mg to be substantially less euphoric than Adderall. I also found the drug to be incredibly smooth. I never knew when the drug had hit me and when I was coming down. In fact, I found the comedown itself almost pleasant, in the subtlest of ways. <br /><br />Of the few times I consumed it, it often ended up on my tongue. I would either lick it off my scale or place a crystal on my tongue. I would then almost immediately drink some water and try to wash it down. However, is there an chance that a substantial amount could have absorbed into my tongue muscles and not have gotten into my bloodstream, or have slowly been absorbed into my blood through my tongue?&nbsp; <br />[/quote]<br /><br />This shit is somewhat insidious in my honest opinion.&nbsp; I love it, and it feels great, and I mostly use it for work but I also get this strong urge to redose as soon as the work day is over, which is where the trap lies.&nbsp; I definitely started out using it lightly, here or there, but it quickly became very frequent usage and habitual, and for the most part, I am probably going to just give it up because it&#039;s starting to interfere with my life too much.&nbsp; It is very addictive but the good news is you can quit it without any fear of serious withdrawals, just some mild craving for a day or two and then you just kinda clear it up, come to your senses and make better judgement when its not invading your brain.<br /><br />Otherwise if you have good self control and can stick to your rules meth is wonderful.&nbsp; I have learned however that I do not have the willpower to control it.

				Excellent and dead on descriptions! Do you have any method to control/reduce any tolerance to stims. Some examples would include Memantine, DXM, NAC, magnesium, huperzine A, memantdine (the holy grail of NDMA antagonists], drug holidays ect... I know there&#039;s more examples but I can&#039;t recall the others at the moment. <br /><br />I tried DXM (an NDMA antagonist) and while it was okay for reducing tolerance it also made me feel slightly more dumb than I usually am ::). The only others&nbsp; tried before is chelated magnesium and magnesium l-threonate. It also helps slightly, but most the most they do for me is ease the jaw tension/clenching and teeth grinding.<br /><br />Most of the anecdotal evidence I&#039;ve found on the clearnet have been from ppl who are taking theurouetic amounts of stim. So it&#039;d be nice to hear from,some fellow meatheads what works for them ;)

				The best way (in my opinion) to reduce tolerance quickly is as follows:<br /><br />MEMANTINE. Can&#039;t stress it enough. Take memantine (much better than magnesium) each day in the morning and at night and you&#039;ll notice a much smoother amp experience. Also, at night take l-tyrosine and remeron (mirtazepine). You&#039;ll wake up a slight bit groggy but once the amp and memantine kick in, you&#039;ll be ready to go. Drink lots of water through all of this and eat well. Hopefully you&#039;ll notice a difference. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve found that eating well-balanced meals and taking a multi-vitamin is very important. Take at least one day off of stimulants per week. If you can&#039;t be completely off stimulants for one day per week, at least use one day where you&#039;ll take much less than your normal/average dose. So if usually you&#039;re doing 100 mg daily, one day only take 10 mg or so. Continue each day with the memantine. I usually don&#039;t do the remeron for too many days in a row because I don&#039;t want to become dependent on it as well but it works wonders to take once a week or once every two weeks. <br /><br />Don&#039;t do the memantine cycle for too many days, I&#039;d say 2 weeks max. After 2 weeks of taking memantine like that, stop taking the memantine and try taking a lower dose of the stims you&#039;re using. It should have the same effect as the higher dose. I can explain this whole system more if need be.

				I&#039;d like to say something to everybody here who seems to be saying that methamphetamine is their favorite and the smoothest and all of that.<br /><br />I have abused stimulants of all kinds for 14 years.&nbsp; I once loved to crush and snort methylphenidate.&nbsp; I did this daily for almost a year.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know at the time, but it made me very irritable and quick to snap at people.&nbsp; I still love snorting this more than cocaine.&nbsp; Fuck, I love snorting it more than meth, but I never really liked snorting meth so that&#039;s not saying too much... anyway, I&#039;m just saying I love stimulants, they are my favorite drugs and frankly the only ones I enjoy.&nbsp; If I cannot think on a drug, I do not enjoy it as a general rule.<br /><br />You all sound much like me.&nbsp; I was not careful, I did not want to live and I let myself take whatever made the day more bearable.&nbsp; I still do this, because frankly, I still don&#039;t really want to live very much.&nbsp; I still do drugs because they&#039;re the only things I really enjoy, besides the studying I get done when I&#039;m on them.&nbsp; Maybe this sounds familiar, maybe it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; I hope it doesn&#039;t, because it&#039;s a terrible frame of mind and definitely not what you want your reason to take drugs to be.&nbsp; Just establishing my perspective.<br /><br />I binged on every stimulant I could find.&nbsp; Back before phenylpropanolamine was scheduled, I even fucking binged on that (plus whatever other stimulants I had on hand).&nbsp; Ephedrine too.&nbsp; Pseudoephedrine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything.&nbsp; But there is no other drug or stimulant I have ever abused that can make me wake up screaming.&nbsp; None other than meth.<br /><br />There are times when I&#039;m low on meth or run out and have to go without for a day, that I am so frightened, so panicky, and so paranoid that I literally wake up screaming in a state of unbearable anxiety after only being asleep for an hour or two.&nbsp; It fades in a few seconds when I realize what&#039;s going on, but I would not call it the smoothest of the stimulants by any means.&nbsp; Its regular use uniquely causes severe anxiety during withdrawal.&nbsp; None of the others you&#039;ve listed have done this to me, but meth does.&nbsp; It&#039;s a wonderful drug, and I adore it.&nbsp; It has many uses and many people I&#039;m sure won&#039;t ever develop a problem.&nbsp; I always had a &quot;problem.&quot;&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care.&nbsp; But while everyone else is talking about how great it is and how it&#039;s the best one... well I don&#039;t know about that.&nbsp; It&#039;s got some unique side effects that dextroamphetamine alone never did to me.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d throw in a downside for balance.&nbsp; These things are massively addictive.&nbsp; I mean I&#039;ll never stop.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to.&nbsp; That&#039;s the problem, I&#039;ll never want to.&nbsp; And I&#039;m okay with that.&nbsp; But before you go any further... make sure that you&#039;re okay with ending up that way, because I swear, to me, you look like you&#039;re headed there zipstyle.&nbsp; No judgements.&nbsp; And it might be projection.&nbsp; But you look like you are to me.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for sharing.&nbsp; It&#039;s always nice to read other people&#039;s perspectives on my favorite drugs :)

				Dang SS, I don&#039;t mean this in an offensive way, but what you just said up there is probably my worst fear. That I&#039;ll never want to stop. I haven&#039;t used meth for about 3 days, so I feel like I have a handle on it to some degree, but there is a sinking suspicion that the best parts of me are being buried in stimulants. That is to say, that the best parts of me can only come out and exist when I&#039;m using stimulants. At least for right now? Idk. Thanks for your perspective, it&#039;s always honest and I can definitely appreciate that.

Wisdom vs knowledge. SS is full of wisdom, we have a lot of knowledge. and we&#039;re really the ones that need to be the most careful, since this knowledge we have will have us jumping into drugs without slowing down to have an appreciation for them.&nbsp; Just remember that the most cautious, conservative side of your brain is the only correct part of your brain when your under the effects and you&#039;re making a decision regarding whether or not you should take more. Though, Zipstyle, just like me, make sure you&#039;re careful, and you should be fine. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />and at that, <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg725438#msg725438">Quote from: zipstyle on January 14, 2013, 03:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />How does ephedrine compare to all these others? Never tried it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;ve never actually tried it myself either. Lately, I&#039;ve been trying to get some, and I should be able to get back <br />to you in about a week. <br />As you seem to be determined to become well versed with every mainstream stimulant, I feel as though your list <br />can&#039;t be complete with some experience with Ephedrine. It&#039;s kind of pricy on the road. If you don&#039;t want to pay <br />very much for, or wait for shipping, you can get it at your local pharmacy.&nbsp; Just go to the back and ask for <br />Bronkaid. <br /><br />It&#039;s the mirrored stereoisomer of psuedoephedrine, and as such, it can be used for synthesizing meth, there&#039;s a <br />monthly cap on how much you can legally purchase, it&#039;s behind the counter, can only be purchased by 18+ people with <br />a driver&#039;s license. the main reason pseedoephedrine is more common for meth synthesis is because the tablets it <br />comes in are practically never isolated from gaunafesin.&nbsp; <br /><br />The effects of it are similar to this: it&#039;s what dextroamphetamine is to levoamtphetamine. It&#039;s an incredibly <br />powerful stimulant, and while it doesn&#039;t produce much Euphoria, provides an insane amount of physical energy. In <br />the 90ies, it was very common for body builders to use this, and aside from being made behind the counter for it&#039;s <br />meth-making properties, was also made as such just because it&#039;s makes your heart pump so damn hard that taking <br />semi-chronic high doses will leave you at a high risk for heart attack. This is why it&#039;s often combined with <br />aspirin. <br /><br />Also, some less mainstream stimulants you may want to look into trying include: levomethamphetamine, <br />ethylphenidate, pseudoephedrine, levoamphetmine(you&#039;ve probably tried this plenty with Adderall, but considering <br />how cheaply this can be purchased, is worth looking into on it&#039;s own), propylhexedrine,&nbsp; fluroamphetaamine(both 2- <br />and 4-), AMT, and PCP(this is actually a dissociative, but it dissociates tiredness and muscular strain, allowing <br />for a superhuman amount of energy and strength[though the amount of energy it provides is incredibly unsustainable, <br />to the point where I can&#039;t imagine many things more harmful to your body than chronic use, or even anything more <br />fequent than very occasional use])

				Hmm. Of all these, I&#039;d be most interested in the stimulants that don&#039;t affect the body as much. I&#039;m all for the neurological stims since that&#039;s most of the work that I do, brain stuff. My body is pretty full-on stimulated even without stimulants haha. <br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m trying to be cautious about my use, planning on making rules for myself and sticking to them, as Priscilla suggested to me way back on day 1. She said that breaking her own rules is what led her to lead an addicts life (not necessarily bad, but one that is dependent on meth, nonetheless). As I am not inclined or interested in becoming dependent on a substance, I am going to make sure that I don&#039;t go through that path. Got many things that I&#039;d like to do in life that don&#039;t involve drugs. And I think this is what has stopped me in the past and what I am pretty sure will stop me in this case of flirting with Tina. She&#039;s a cutie, but she&#039;ll cut you right quick. I gotta say that my brain is set up perfectly for her, and she&#039;s right at home. But I&#039;ve seen the deceptions and I&#039;m taking the precautions and setting the rules to avoid the kind of abuse that will set me back on a path that perpetuates itself. If/When I break those rules, I flush. Just like with MDPV. And I never did have to flush the PV. I grew to respect it, and the majority of it is still sitting in its .5 g baggie untouched for about 2 months. I&#039;ll continue to update here to stay honest and I urge others to do the same. Even if it seems like no one really cares or listens, it&#039;s important to be honest SOMEWHERE about what you&#039;re using, how much, and how often. Keep it real with yourself and you should be fine. :)

If you want to put the drug up your nose (like cocaine) I would suggest buying the extended release version of Dexedrine. A vendor I&#039;d recommend is Avon, but order the stealth packets instead of the actual capsules. Every time I ordered the capsules they arrived broken and the beads were everywhere. Avon made it right in the end but now I&#039;m getting sidetracked. Ok. So yes, get dexedrine spansules but just order the beads. Then go to CVS or Walgreens or whatever and buy yourself a pill crusher, the kind with the screw-on crusher. Put all the beads into the crusher, and screw it all the way down to crush all the beads. Now you will have a bunch of powder with pieces of wax/plastic/shit in it. Get a fine mesh strainer (like the kind you use to filter tea or for flour) and pour all the powder in it. Lightly tap the strainer over a plate or other flat container in order to collect all the (mostly) pure dextroamphetamine. Some of the wax shit will get through, but it won&#039;t make the snorting process that bad. At least you got most of it out. <br /><br />If you are planning on just swallowing it, then just get the instant release tablets. I would not suggest getting the tablets to snort because then you&#039;ll be snorting a shit-ton of binders which are not only gross but also pointless. There is no reason for anyone to be putting pill binders up their nose in my opinion. It&#039;s a waste of a fucking nose. Put pure(er) drugs up there, people. Otherwise you might as well be snorting a line of chalk for every bump of dex or whatever drug you&#039;re taking. Ok enough of my rant. I hope I helped.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg732333#msg732333">Quote from: bynter on January 17, 2013, 01:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105104.msg731461#msg731461">Quote from: zipstyle on January 16, 2013, 04:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br /><br />I would venture to say that an addiction cannot be controlled, which seems to be SS&#039;s primary issue here.

At any rate, I don&#039;t binge on any stimulants since I don&#039;t like the effects of binging. I usually will only dose once or twice and then call it quits. With stimulants I think it&#039;s a fast way to nowhere if you&#039;re taking large and frequent doses. Not saying you are planning on doing so, just thought I&#039;d put it out there. Maybe try a small dose yourself and tell us what you think of its effects?
