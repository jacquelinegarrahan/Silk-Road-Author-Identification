				I am going to buy some speed sulfate from BoyMaster (supposedly the best speed on SR) but am a bit confused as what is speed sulfate? From what I gathered on web, speed sulfate and speed paste are the same thing, just that sulfate is dry am I correct? So what I will get from BoyMaster is dry speed, that needs no baking and thus I will experience no weight loss?<br /><br />And how much do you think I should mix the stuff before it is ready to hit the streets, I was thinking of making 5g from 1g (so it would be about 25% purity which is pretty high I think, ofcourse depends on your sources).<br /><br />All info is welcome<br /><br />greetings,<br />danjohnken

				Why not ask him? I dont think it becomes &quot;sulfate&quot; when its dry but I am no expert. <br /><br />I cant really condone cutting your gear that&#039;s not good. Especially speed, its cheap as anything anyway.

Similarly, cocaine for snorting and injecting is actually cocaine hydrochloride, although cocaine base (aka crack cocaine) is used for smoking. Same thing with heroin.<br />If your amphetamine is a solid, even if it&#039;s wet, it&#039;s an amphetamine salt and good to use :)<br />25% purity would be rather high-end gear where I&#039;m from.
