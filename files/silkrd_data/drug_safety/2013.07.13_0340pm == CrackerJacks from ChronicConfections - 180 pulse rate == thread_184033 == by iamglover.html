				Hey guys! SO - I ate about 0.375 ounces or 1/4th of a 1.5 ounce baggie of CrhonicConfection&#039;s crackerjacks.<br /><br />I consumed it late afternoon/early evening. Finally went to bed at midnight. <br /><br />Woke up at 1am dizzy, rolled over and went back to bed<br />Woke up at 3am dizzy and same thing went back to bed<br />Woke up at 4:30 and sat up.<br /><br />As I sat up the room titled and my chest got exceptionally cold - my arms and legs went numb and I went from tired to panicked. <br /><br />Barely about to see anything - I managed to dial 911. They showed up and insisted I come to the hospital with them. My pulse was far too high 185 BPM.&nbsp; my blood pressure was also exceptionally high...at the hospital my pulse rate remained high for 4.5hrs from 160 BPM - 190 BPM.<br /><br />Is this NORMAL for Marijuana? I only had a little, little bit and&nbsp; I felt FINE on it - I never felt high and just went to bed until I woke up with these crazy symptoms. I am also practically a first time user so did that contribute? help is appreciated@

				That&#039;s a RIDICULOUS amount of marijuana to be eating. You were brave to take that much, haha.<br /><br />Just to clarify, did you eat it raw or cooked? When you cook weed, you&#039;re only supposed to put in around 1-2 grams max for each serving, and if this weed is good, you will get absolutely bonkers high unless you have a phenomenal tolerance. <br /><br />If you ate it raw, then yeah, you should expect to eat a lot more to get an effect as THC has very low solubility in water and needs to be absorbed in fat. <br /><br />In either case, there is absolutely nothing to worry about (although if you really did eat 0.375 ounces of properly cooked weed you would have probably just passed out for 6 hours and been unable to talk, so I&#039;m gonna wager you ate it raw). Marijuana is extremely nontoxic, and from what I&#039;ve read, it would take ounces and ounces or even pounds to overdose on. <br /><br />Seeing as you ate so much, it&#039;s really not surprising your pulse was so high. Weed increases your heartrate dramatically. Not sure about the blood sugar thing though.<br /><br />Relax, and eat less next time.<br />

				So how much cannabis did you actually ingest? It&#039;s not very clear to me what concentration was in those cookies, so its hard to find out what was going on there. <br /><br />Elevated heart rate is not uncommon when hallucinating on whatever substance you are using to do so. The experience can be frightening and heart rate shooting up over 160 is nothing odd when you get a good scare - from drugs or otherwise. Usually this rapid heartbeat comes down close to normal levels quite quickly and poses no threat if you are in good health.<br /><br />A numb feeling in your extremities could be something to be concerned about though, but it doesn&#039;t have to be in all cases. <br /><br />Perhaps the whole ordeal simply caused you to also hyperventilate which usually produces a tingling sensation in the extremities, but in some cases also causes a numb sensation.&nbsp; In itself this is no reason for immediate alarm though, once the fear subsides your breathing and heart rate will return to normal values and the feeling in your arms and legs also returns to what you are used to.<br /><br />Calling emergency services may be prudent if you are unsure of what you have ingested or how much of it. Otherwise, just lying still on your bed may prove significant relieve within minutes - focus on your breathing and keep to taking a normal breath every 4 seconds or so. <br /><br />

				I have a friend who is allergic to thc. If she smokes cannabis she breaks out in hives and starts having breathing problems maby when it is cooked it changes some of the molecules and causes an adverse reaction to you. <br /><br />The next thing I&#039;d say had you taken anymore drugs that day especially pain meds. I do this combonation all the time because I like the effects. But just one hydro5mg which by itself is a little week anda fire cracker(style of homeade eddible) with .5high grade bud will have my heart racing and the room spinning so much that I think I&#039;m going to throw up. The eddible and pain meds combo can be intense. <br /><br />Also maby you are sensitive to eddibles. The first couple times I took eddibles were smaller amounts than my friends and I just wanted it to stop.<br /><br />On another note I just orderd 2 bags of those and about 6 other eddibles of his erlier tonite. I&#039;m a huge fan and have ordered his rice krispys before. sorry for your experience.
