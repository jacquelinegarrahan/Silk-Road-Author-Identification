				(Pure) Heroin and oxymorphone are my favorite. Oxycodone seems to put everyone i know that takes it in a very pissy mood. I think it&#039;s like that for every opiate, but really bad with oxycodone for some reason.

It still makes me feel good but it seems to make me rather agitated/irritable rather than euphoric.

				I will echo what the others have said about Oxycodone increasing irritability, but I experience the same thing on high doses of hydrocodone as well.<br />For me, oxycodone is the best I have tried. 15mg insufflated is very euphoric and gives me energy.<br />Hydrocodone is good but much more mellow.<br /><br />I will be trying some H soon, just a few stamps for a weekend of insufflation.

				Heroine with out a doubt. <br />Makes you feel warm and content and bring that awesome coolness. Your like suddenly to coolest person ever.<br />Then I like the way it pulls on you muscles. Very nice. It also works like an anti psychotic. Takes to paranoia for almost every thing weed, crack. And such.<br />Not only I heroine my favorite opiate. But probably its my all time favorite drug.

				Just good heroin to snort.&nbsp; Opana the old school formulation was the best but turned me into a blacked out monster.&nbsp; Worse than xanax black outs.<br /><br />Oxycodone is good but most of the time due to my low tolerance is gives me a headache and nauseous and isn&#039;t as euphoric as the former two.
