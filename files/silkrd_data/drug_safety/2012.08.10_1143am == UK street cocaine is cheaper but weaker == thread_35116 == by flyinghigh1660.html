				&nbsp;Its the same way here in the US but its way more worth it to buy on the street. for me street coke is probley around 60% and costs 50$ a gram and coke here is like 120$ and 80% pure.

				In the UK, the BEST BEST BEST coke your gona get on the street is gonna be between 45-30%, and that&#039;s if you very lucky to find a dealer like that. mostly street coke is absolute cut up bullshit with less that 15% coke.

Area can play a huge role on purity - like the amphetamine going around my area it the moment is probably one of the best in the country, and it will continue that way until the person bringing here is caught, if they ever are.
