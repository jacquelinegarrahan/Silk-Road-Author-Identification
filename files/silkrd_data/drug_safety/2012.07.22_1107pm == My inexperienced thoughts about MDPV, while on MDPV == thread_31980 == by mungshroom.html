				<br />Okay so i was sending a quick message to qd8714 ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7ae85f44b2 ), who had recently sent me some MDPV, which was a new substance for me. <br />I was just asking a quick question, but while writing the message i randomly decided to actualy take some MDPV which i have only tried a few times so far, having received it only a week ago. So without any delay i insuf a line (30-50mg maybe, didnt weigh and cant remeber). And the simple message i was writing quickly began to spiral down into a long rambling rant of my views and random spculation on the substance MDPV. I quickly realised that this was no longer the message i had intended to send, and was now just random drug induced ramblings which had no place in the message i has supposed to be sending, so i&nbsp; figured maybe i could post it on the silkroad forums and someone might find it helpful or interesting, or not, either way; i was happy typing away, so i just continued regardless. <br /><br />Now i have only tried the substance for first time less than a week ago, so these views are probably quite ignorant and may be completely bullshit, as its mostly just random thoughts and speculation from my drug induced mindstate.<br /><br />I figure its still worth a post here, so take it however you like.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I i&#039;ve just had a small sample of some of your fine mdpv.<br />I think what i have here from you is white, not the tan? not sure.<br />But i&#039;d like to revise my statement from the other day when i said i dont find mdpv to be very fiendish at all.<br /><br />Well its not feindish in the same way that most stimulants are, with most stims i would crash and feel low and sad, thus have the strong sometimes uncontrollable urge to just get back up there, even when i know i shouldnt be having more i often do redose.<br />Which if goes on for long time can result in taking more just to not feel like shit, but not actualy getting much high at all, basicly wasting lots of good drugs. Thats fiending as i know it.<br />This MDPV has a much more insideous nature of redosing, which caught me off guard first time i sampled it recreationaly.<br />Because it doesnt realy give me a crash like with most stims, i&#039;m just smoothly coming down and still quite awake and happy instead. <br /><br />If i want to have some more mdpv; then i never see myself as not having the self control to resist the desire. <br />Instead i feel full in control, and feel i can quite happily not have any more with no wtrouble. <br />So with the the knowledge that i dont feel like i NEED to have more, just that i want to have more; I&#039;ll think, well why not have some more? <br />Im having fun here, im still awake and happy, so i might aswell have some more to keep it going, its my choice entirely to have more.<br />Thus whilst still thinking im in control, i lose control and feind. <br /><br />This can go on for much longer than originaly intended. Food and sleep are not something that is needed, but then i will relaise i betterput something in my belly because i relise i have been awake all night and not eaten anything, gotta eat something cos not eating would be unhealthy, oh and water when was the last time i drak water, better have a drink too. <br />The fact that i have been awake all night is no big worry though, its almost daytime now so might as well stay up for the day so i can sleep at normal time next night. I&#039;m not feeling tired at all anyway, so going to sleep now that its daytime is a waste of a good day right? And look, i have not feinded on the drug at all, i have barely had any of that MDPV all night, just like 4 small lines, theres still heaps left. <br />Any other stim i prolly woulda fiended most of it by now and soon be facing the prospect of an empty bag.<br /><br />Yeah, it caught me off guard.<br />Recreationaly i can see this to be a dangerous drugg, its a lot more potent than it might seem, so to achieve a recreational high, you actualy have a lot more than would be wise. And you will chose to have more, mutiple times, when you probably shouldnt, but never feel like you NEED to have more, just that you choose to.<br /><br />That&#039;s not to say i wont use it recreationaly again, but i will be very wary of its subtle almost insideous nature, and try to avoid too much abuse. <br />And fucking hell I realize i have just less than an half an hour? an hour? ago taken a recreation sized dose, with no intention to use it recreationaly, more just to try it again. And all i&#039;m doing is typing out this random shit. Is that bad that i&#039;m on a powerful stimulant (NDRI aparently, im glad no seretonin) and sitting on my own at home on the fucking computer? Sure sounds like abuse of drugs to me.<br />What can i say, i wanted to try a decent sized dose again to see how it goes, so i did. <br />And the clock tells me its getting late now, if i have more mdpv i&#039;ll have no chance sleeping for most the night... yet i&#039;m thinking i most likely will have more. Not because i feel that im crashing and need more to get back up there, but just because im awake, and liking where im at, its a long time off before i&#039;ll have more though, fine where i am right now. Yep, i&#039;ll prolly feind later, just seemingly done for different reasons than my fiending on most other stims. Other stims i often feel i dont have a choice, this stim i feel i do have a choice, it just so happens that the choice always seems to be yes.<br /><br /><br /><br />I do see a lot of potential as a more medicinal approach to MDPV though.<br /><br />1. As a motivator for getting work done. Maybe try a small amount oraly in the morning after breakfast would give energy and motivation for a lot of the day, and small amount after a (probably forced) lunch to keep you going till late evening maybe. Being sure not to take any more, else would end up being awake all night.<br /><br />I dont know what a good dosage for that would be, id prolly try 10mg and see how that goes. It would take some experimenting to find a nice balanced dose, so you get a small energy/modivation boost, but don&#039;t get too amped or scatterbrained.<br /><br />Could get a lot of work done with that extra bit of motivation and energy through the day, though the scatterbrain aspect would make using machinary and powertools more dangerous, and the complex logical tasks a lot more difficult. So its work potential might be limited.<br />That scatterbrained easily sidetracked distracted aspect i find mdpv gives me is annoying here, as it would seriosuly limit its uses for getting work done, hopefully with small doses theres not so much scatterbrain.<br /><br />But damn taking mdpv this way sounds like a dangerously habbitual and potentialy addictive thing to do. I could see myself doing it more and more often untill i was doing that every fucking day, becoming dependant on it. <br />Prolly resulting in trouble coping if didnt have any, like would have lack of energy and motivation and feeling like shit, without it.<br />Yep, that sounds scary if not done carefully.<br />I&#039;d still like to try it that way though.<br /><br /><br />2. As a dieat pill, in smaller amounts (like 3mg maybe) after breakfast, and same after lunch, would make a fucking great diet pill. Except of course the potential for abuse, and with habitual use addiction could easily follow. <br /><br /><br />3. A shift worker or someone who had to stay awake when they normaly wouldnt. This stuff makes you atualy feel awake and lasts a long time, wheres other stimulants; you are awake but still feel dregged out, and they must be taken at shorter intervals, and would crash ahrd if neglected to take constantly.<br /><br /><br />4. This is the third time when on mdpv i have sat down to write a simple message to someone and ended up writing a fucking whole tome of random shit that i had not intended when i started writing.<br />Infact i normaly write very little, just stating the point of the message and thats it.<br />So for anyone who does like to write, take a little bit of mdpv and you will be writing for hours about any random shit.<br />Theres no guarentee the writings will be very useful, or well written, or even comprehensible, but this stuff sure does make me write a lot of random shit. So i can only presume it will effect others similarly. Looking back at it when im sobre, i feel like i wasted a lot of time writing complete rubbish. But as i say, i don&#039;t usualy write much at all, as i would normaly feel i&#039;m wasting time that could be spent doing something more productive.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sure theres other potential uses for mdpv too, as it does seem quite interesting and somewhat unique in my experience of substances, but without a way to ensure controlled use (such as a doctor giving out prescriptions style) it looks like it could be the sort of drug that could easily spiral out of control easily.<br /><br /><br />So all in all, its is a great versatile drug that i am definately a fan of, but like all drugs, it&#039;s something i would treat with extreme care and respect, as its subtle nature can be quite aluring, but theres an insidious darker sid ethat i am wary of.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is my thoughts on it after only having come into contact with it 5 days ago, i have not had the time or desire to get to know it very well at all in just 5 days.<br /><br />

				Sounds interesting. I lol&#039;d when you said you see the potential for MDPV having medicinal properties. Too bad it&#039;s illegal now. <br />

				Excellent post, I would say this is the reason why anyone would try MDPV to begin with. Thanks for sharing :)
