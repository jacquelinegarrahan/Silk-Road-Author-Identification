But this hapenned, the burps, and alots of them, with 2 friends mine, that taked 2 mdma&#039;s, from 2 diferentes sellers,&nbsp; that i bought here, and both with great reviews.. the mdma&#039;s were very good, both, but they burped alot, and some big burps, almost puking. but after some 5 or 6 burps of the bigs, they stayed very good, and with a great energy, like mdma is.. <br /><br /><br />2 pills.. well, i cant do that. I only toked pills once, and it was only a half of a super mario, about 50mg.. i burped alot too.. <br />some people say that could be of the dose of water that we usually use..&nbsp; about 40cl per 250 mg of mdma, should we put more water? <br /><br />

Some of these are found in the stomach and parts of the gastrointestinal tract. One is the 5HT3 receptor. 5HT3 is the serotonin receptor from which all others developed. It differs greatly from the others in both appearance and function. All 5HT receptors other than 5HT3 are serpentine or G protein types.<br />The 5HT3 receptors are ion channels (as apposed to G protein types). In the stomach, they affect muscular contractions, and play a role in the digestive function as well as regulating the desire to eat. It is an agonist action on these receptors that is thought to cause the queasy tummy feeling. It is also quite possible some people have more of these receptors, making them more prone to vomiting. <br />Other factors can be involved. The tablet may “stick” to the stomach lining and cause burning and reflux, or in the case of prolonged use, ulcerations or permanent reflux problems. This is a common complaint with long term speed users who bomb their meth in a cig paper. Different tablet formulations (binders etc) may also take longer to break up where as others may release the amine salt quickly.<br />Although there should be no freebase MDMA in tablets, any traces of freebase will react violently in the presence of acid, and considering your stomach is normally around pH 1.5-2, this could cause agitation. The alkaline nature of freebase amphetamines may also burn the epithelium (outer cells of the stomach lining). <br />The normal life of epithelial stomach cells is around 3-7 days but the turnover rate is greatly affected by chemicals which kill the cells. No doubt, any rapid destruction of these cells would cause discomfort.<br />There are many possible variables which may predispose a person towards stomach sensitivity. Alcohol destroys the protective mucous as can some spicy foods. This protective layer is also affected by smoking and age. <br />Finally, heartburn can result from damage to the esophagus and the valve to the stomach (sphincter). This causes stomach acids to enter and burn the esophagus, which has little protection against strong acids. It can be damaged or inflamed by oral doses of amphetamines. This damage may never heal, producing the condition known as GERD or gastrointestinal reflux disease.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Never had this happen to me tho :)
