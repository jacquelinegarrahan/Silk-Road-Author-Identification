				Hello good people. I have done E, methylone, LSD, shrooms etc and I am looking to experiment a bit more when I got to Vegas later this year. I was thinking of getting some high quality MDMA from one of the fine vendors here and making capsules with other substance(s). I was thinking perhaps 2ce but I am open to suggestions. What else goes well with E? I would like something with at least mild visuals. We could do shrooms and/or acid but I was hoping to find something that I could sneak into the gel capsule with the molly. I appreciate any suggestions.

				If you are looking for BLISS try a little ghb (8ml - 12ml) after the MDMA peak (but no alcohol before, during or after), find yourself somewhere comfortable with fine music and melt into a time-devouring marshmallow.&nbsp; One of the most pleasant synergies I&#039;ve experienced.<br /><br />With 4-ho-mpt is good for a very powerful, positive self-actualization type experience.<br /><br />Obviously this is all highly subjective so &quot;enjoy responsibly&quot;&nbsp; :o especially when mixing and matching.<br /><br />peace

				Try MDMA, then when about half way down from that, 20mg 2c-b.&nbsp; Heard it can be a great experience.

				you shouldnt recommend ghb so easily, it has a very low dosage curve, the difference between not feeling it, having a great time and needing to go to hospital can be as little as 20% of your dose, i.e if 3 ml was your sweet spot, you might feel almost nothing at 2.5 but if you dosed another half ml while going good on 3 you could get way too fucked up and messy, ive seen this happen, often.<br /><br />not to mention: the ghb in my area, inexperienced people dose 2-3mls, 8-12 would almost without doubt kill someone without a tolerance

				MDMA/LSD is like the best combo ever!<br /><br />If your doses are on blotter you could just put the blotter in a cap with the MDMA?

LSD=8-12 hours, MDMA=4-6 hours. Who wants to come down from MDMA while still tripping hard? Not me! The best way to candyflip is to try and time it so they peak together. I say take the LSD, and wait 2.5-3 hours, then drop the molly. Good times!

				^ That is a good point. I typically drop the L a couple hours before taking MDMA. Redosing molly as needed has also worked well for me.

				Put a Microdot or Two in a gelcap of molly. It&#039;s pretty awesome. <br />And if you are in private near the peak somewhere that you don&#039;t mind stinking up - smoke some DMT. : ) <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I agree Ketamine and/or LSD are great with E.<br /><br />I doubt I&#039;d even feel the E if taken with 2ce.&nbsp; Take that FWIW though as I really disliked 2ce.&nbsp; It felt all metallic and the nausea was horrible.&nbsp; The visuals were intense though.&nbsp;
