				If one were to use Amphetamines, and as a result, stay awake for 20 hour stretches(followed by a normal 8-10 hours sleep) they could expect to experience deteriorating health, thats pretty much a given.<br /><br />However if you were to supplement this with say... 200mg Modafonil per day, how much of the potential long term damage would be mitigated?&nbsp;

				Frankly, in my opinion, absolutely fucking none.&nbsp; Not any at all whatsoever.&nbsp; I can only imagine the addition of modafonil would further disrupt the sleep cycle that you do get, causing even more damage (even if it doesn&#039;t cause damage otherwise).<br /><br />You can use amphetamine and stay awake for 20 hours, then crash for 10 and do that... well, almost indefinitely.&nbsp; I did stretches of 3-4 days one to two times a week for years, and my health didn&#039;t actually begin degrading (it baselined at a lower-than-average level is what I mean) until I started just doing back-to-back runs nonstop 6 months ago.&nbsp; It really depends on the person&#039;s physiology, frankly.&nbsp; But again, in my opinion, the addition of modafonil would just make it worse.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how it could protect you at all.

				Correct. Modafinil would do nothing to mitigate your sleep debt. <br /><br />Some studies show that as a minor dopamine agonist, it can reduce cravings for cocaine and it&#039;s effect by around 50%... so it has been considered for cocaine withdrawal, which may be helpful for some. <br /><br />Amphetamines work differently though. <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.
