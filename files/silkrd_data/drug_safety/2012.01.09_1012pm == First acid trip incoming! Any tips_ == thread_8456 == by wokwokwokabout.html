				Be in a good mood, with good friends, in a good place. Take two bucally (inbetween your cheek and teeth) and keep them there for about 20 minutes or so. And have fun. <br />If the worst should happen, remember it&#039;s just a drug.

				how experienced are you with psychedelics? i think two tabs for your first time with a psychedelic could possibly very overwhelming and cause lots of anxiety for you.<br /><br />i don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary to keep the tab in your mouth for 20 minutes but it doesn&#039;t really matter i suppose.<br /><br />also, yes if you start to get anxious, try to remember that it will all be over eventually. <br /><br />there&#039;s not much remedy for a bad trip besides music, benzos, or antipsychotics so your state of mind and setting going in is very important.<br />

				There have been a few threads lately about the strength of bloomingcolors tabs, not sure if they are up to the advertised 180ug yet or not. If they are, you will have a very very strong trip if you take 2. Take 1 to start, and see how you are feeling after an hour. If its fairly mild, drop another.<br /><br />Definitely keep a happy and comfortable environment, don&#039;t let the lights get too dark or it can get a bit scary. Take early afternoon if you can, being outside in nature is fantastic.<br /><br />Don&#039;t try to force anything you see, just relax and enjoy yourself. Let yourself be awed by visions, but don&#039;t try to control what is happening or you will start to freak. And have your favourite music going!<br /><br />I also suggest don&#039;t have too much screen time, games and tv can reduce the experience somewhat. On the other hand, if you are finding the trip going bad then focusing on a tv show or game can help keep a link with reality.

				I imagine it&#039;ll also depend on how strong your tabs are. I don&#039;t mean to hijack the thread, but I actually haven&#039;t taken LSD before either. I&#039;m sitting on some Shivas (advertised 150ug) from Psychopsilocin and Darkbanana. I&#039;ve done 1.0-1.5g of Rocker&#039;s shrooms a couple of times, and I imagine the tips for set and setting (good friends and a familiar, safe place) remain the same regardless of whether you take shrooms or LSD, so now I&#039;m also wondering whether I should take 1 or 2 tabs for my first trip.

				Take one tab and wait at least one hour. Anything else and you&#039;re ASKING to have a bad trip.<br /><br />And try NOT to realize that your entire perception of reality since infantdom was all a mirage perpetuated by every evil person you&#039;ve ever had contact with. :)<br /><br />

				try to be outside. in the forest. have some 2mg Xanax or valium on hand in case it goes bad. the first time i did acid i had a blast.&nbsp; i had a bad trip the second time i did acid, and now i have bad trips with every hallucinogen i try since then. i cant even do shrooms any more without being trapped in hell talking to satan or space aliens all the meanwhile praying to god huddled up in a corner wishing this hell trip would be over, vowing to never take drugs again. i wish i could get back to the days when shrooms were fun and made me feel like i was in a happy state or mind with colorful visuals and not a worry in the world. when it was good it was awesome. when it was bad, it was the most horrific experiences of my life, but there are many lessons to be learned and maybe i was so young at the time that all that knowledge that was so foreign and obscure to me and my catholic upbringing was possibly what overwhelmed me and caused me to have a bad experience.. or maybe i got some bad LSD the government is making to try and brainwash users to convert to christianinty.&nbsp; who knows. haven&#039;t touched them since and most likely never will. my feeling is that if i would have never done LSD and stuck with shrooms, i&#039;d probably still be able to have a good trip.

				Seriously take one tab for your first time. <br /><br />I was like you my first time with psychedelics. I wanted a strong trip right away. Sounded like a good idea until i took 3.5 g of shrooms and was so overwhelmed that i almost wanted to do anything to make it stop.<br /><br />And wait at least 2 hours before taking another tab. Sometimes it takes me more than an hour to come up.

				I would recommend just starting with 1, and then save the extras until your tolerance drops so you can have that experience of just 1 tab, so you can decide if you want to take 2. High dosages don&#039;t increase duration much longer than an average dose as well, so keep that in mind when thinking about your second trip.

				i have the same dilemma! i ordered some of darkbanana&#039;s lsd last night for my first time. it&#039;s advertised as being weaker than the average, at 100 mics. i don&#039;t know if i should do one or two. i&#039;m thinking splitting it in half is kind of sketchy because there is no way the acid is evenly distributed across the hit. will 200 mics be extremely overwhelming for a first time user?

				You should go easy the first time. 1 tab will bring you an unforgettable experience through.<br />I started doing just with a half one. LSD brings you on a long journey, you better stay with one foot in reality :)

				My first time I took half a tab, it wasn&#039;t disappointing but I felt like I was on the brink of something profound.<br />&nbsp;<br />I hope it isn&#039;t too late, but I have a super awesome trip environment that might help things go more smoothly.<br /><br />I was about to trip on some illicit substances, and I was worried that I wouldn&#039;t have a calm place to go if I felt over stimulated. (This is a problem I often encounter while taking psychedelic drugs.) This is what I came up with:<br /><br />Separate your home into two halves: High stimulation and low stimulation. The living room can be the high stimulation environment, it will be well lit and used for average volume music or movies. Your bedroom or parlor can be the low stimulation environment. It will be totally dark, or dim, in this room and there should be ambient music playing at a low volume. You can use a curtain to separate the two environments, and either knot the bottom or tie it to the side so that the mechanism doesn&#039;t confuse anyone. I did this, but by the end of the night it was taken down.<br /><br />If you can go into the woods, do that instead.<br /><br />Like others have said, if things get rough remember that it&#039;s just a drug.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was like you my first time with psychedelics.

				One requirement, at least for me, during a trip of any kind is music! My favorite for an acid trip is Daft Punk, Ulrich Schnauss, Pink Floyd, and Crystal Method. Enjoy the trip through your psyche!

Keep in mind Acid is serious business, quote of a friend comes to mind &quot;you dont know what &#039;fucked up&#039; is till youre been really fucked up on acid&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Totally agree with this. My advise on music would be psy-trance (1200micrograms, vibetribe, infected mushroom, and Transistance-albums and stuff) if you&#039;re into electronic music... <br />My first experience was a while ago with a good friend of mine (VERY important to be with good friends and people you trust! In a familiar environment! We were in his dorm-room, where I&#039;ve been plenty of times before)<br />Dosing is really hard... Since tabs differ per &#039;brand&#039; and per batch... We both took 1,5 blotter of &quot;The Original Albert Hoffman&quot; streetpharmacy ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/11842 ) was selling at the time... I don&#039;t know if the ones he has listed now are the same... <br />But 1,5 was perfect for the both of us, we had a great experience, yet not too intense... If you&#039;re looking for an intense first time I&#039;d advise taking 2 though (we spaced them 1 hour apart... start with 1, then at T+1 take another half). Remember it takes a pretty long time till you peak though!<br /><br />Be with someone who is also using it... It makes it a lot easier to talk about the stuff that&#039;s going on... We didn&#039;t have a trip-sitter because we couldn&#039;t find one (ppl were scared or had to go work day after...) and we went just fine... If you have a trip-sitter though make sure he/she also knows the basics about the substance (if he/she hasn&#039;t done it before)<br />Some benzo&#039;s are a good idea as well, just in case stuff goes wrong...<br />But just make sure that...<br />A. you are with people you like and trust<br />B. be in an environment you know and trust<br />C. are in a good mood, and excited about the experience<br />D. once you start tripping, accept the fact you are not in control, and just let the LSD do it&#039;s thing, don&#039;t try to control things too much!<br />E. whille comming up, if you start to get a bit scared, or start feeling negativity comming up, just go outside and make a short walk... This is what happened to me, after walking outside for about 20minutes... I was just fine and after that had an amazing time!<br /><br />Have fun though! And make sure to let us know how the experience was! =)

				dont tell anyone who is not tripping with you that you are tripping. they will try to fuck with your mind and it might turn into a very bad trip.<br /><br />one time my buddy(who is atheist) and i were tripping on shrooms. we told our devout christian friend about it. bad idea. he was driving VERY erratically saying things like OUT OF BALANCE!, and MESSED UP! as we were comming up. once we were into the trip the christian non-tripper spent the entire time trying to convince the athiest tripper to believe in god. not good

What a jerk! Don&#039;t tell ASSHOLES who are not tripping with you that you are tripping, haha. The very first time I tripped on shrooms, we had a sober sitter who took care of us and gave us fun activities to do, even though she had never done shrooms or LSD before.

				The most important thing is environment. That can and will make or break a trip. A friend and I dropped 3 WoW at a mall when we were kids...not a good idea. The more relaxed and mellow the environment the better but also make sure that you can move and aren&#039;t stuck in a room for example. Stay away from other people unless you are at a festival. Remember that you will be dealing with a ton of new sensations and there is no need to throw unpleasant surprises in there too.<br /><br />Beside that I would make sure that you have a great sound system so you can truly hear music for the first time. If you have the balls I recommend Hendrix. Grab one of his concerts and play the whole thing. If you can get your hands on it get the Maui show or get the Berkley 2nd show.<br /><br />Stuff like Infected Mushroom and Shpongle are fun too but once you listen to Hendrix you won&#039;t look back.

				Wow, lots of people giving dosage tips without knowing the dosage of the squares or the body size of the user...<br /><br />180s, I wouldn&#039;t take 2 the first time unless you are 250+ lbs,and have experience with drugs of this category, then I would! I might even take 1.5 your first time if your like me and dont waste time and money on half tripping. Most blotter at festivals seem to be 100s at best. more like 50s probably. I&#039;m excited about ordering off SR but afraid I&#039;ll set aside the time,put a bunch of time into prep,get my friends ready, and end up with bunk product (mail trucks get HOT inside)<br /><br />Its really hard to tell. Apparently a lot of people have no honest clue how the universe really is, and it scares them half to death. (I always assumed people at least think about these kind of subjects while sober and have probably given some bad advice based on that fact) <br />

				I wouldnt be around anyone who i wouldnt want to know im tripping, IE these people saying dont tell anyone they will fuck with you. dont put yourself in a situation where people can fuck with you, make an agreement with your fellow trippers not to do it to each other (it will be tempting as your coming up heh) and dont be at a party or similar were randoms can mess with you. <br /><br />As for a trip sitter whos never tripped, yeah they could be totally fine during a light &#039;smooth sailing&#039; type trip.&nbsp; but an experienced trip sitters awesomeness comes into play when shit goes bad. One of my first trips a friend started to get a bit anxious/nervous, our (100% inexperienced) trip sitter probably made it worse by offering to take him to the hospital after failing to calm him down<br /><br />that said, if they have done their reading and arnt a fuckstick someone whos never tripped could still be a good tripsitter. <br /><br />let us know how you go

				Do not expect anything, but accept everything. And if you don&#039;t know how much you should take, choose the bigger option. There is only one first time.<br /><br />And in the hard moment of thought loop or &quot;mindfuck&quot; keep in mind that you are not your thoughts.

				Drop 2 and do the following: <br /><br />Essentials<br />1. MUSIC - you will NEED a music player and headphones!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a. JAZZ - THIS IS A MUST! Go with Miles Davis w/Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and/or Charlie Parker<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;b. Pink Floyd - Ummagumma(live and studio), shine on you crazy diamond, and echoes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;c. tool - 10,000 days (both the album and the song of same name) <br />2. MOVIES<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a. The shining <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;b. Trust me on this, the shining!<br />3. CANDY - Sour Patch Kids<br /><br />Rules<br />1. NO SHARP OBJECTS!! YOU DONT NEED THEM LEAVE THEM BE!!! <br />2. SET AND SETTING -Keep in mind lsd sucks you into anything/everyting, like a moth to a flame, so if you&#039;re not feeling the vibes force yourself to change your set and setting, If the movie gets too intense, just mute it and listen to your jazz music... <br />3. Avoid mirrors!<br />4. REMEMBER: IT IS JUST A DRUG - it&#039;s supposed to fuck you up and THE EFFECTS ARE NOT PERMANENT! sounds obvious but it could save your ass if you have a bad trip<br /><br /><br />TRUST ME!! everybody I know who has followed this list (&gt;10 people) had a stellar trip!&nbsp; 8)<br />

				To add to the music list, Sigur Ros has some amazingly trippy songs/concerts well worth looking at. Hell they recently made a 6 hour long song which was specifically designed for an lsd trip!<br />Blind Guardian also has some amazingly uplifting songs.

				All you can do is look at the hundreds, possibly thousands, of tabs shipped on here and see how many people are getting great trips from them. They could lose a small amount of potency during shipping, but not a lot.
