				How easy is it to break the ER on the MS pills and Is there a way to clean them up for IV?<br />I&#039;d probably sniff them but would like to know about the IV method as well.<br /><br />Chronicpain spill the beans! :P

				It all depends on the ER pill. I would head on over to opiophile and check out their morphine thread. Personally, I would plug it. i know it doesn&#039;t sound appealing, but with morphine (other than IV) its the best way.<br /><br />come to think of it, Its been a long time since i&#039;ve done anything else to morphine other than eat it or plug it.

				@_@<br />Bioavailability IV - 100%<br />Bioavailability oral - 20%<br /><br />hmmmm<br />I didn&#039;t like any of the IV prep write ups.<br />I mean it kinda sounds like how you have to cook some east coast heroin but sliding the wax to the edge of the spoon before filter.<br />I might just pulverize and parachute. <br />Would be the safest route. :D

				you can get the morphine out of ms contin or the oxy out of the new formula OP by chopping it up, soaking it in methanol, filter, then evaporate the methanol. make sure the methanol is completely evaporated because it is toxic. what is left over can then be brought up in water with no gelling and filtered for IV. this method will recover nearly 100% of the opiate. use 1mL of methanol per 2mg of opiate. it works well and doesn&#039;t take to long to evaporate the methanol if you heat it gently. i can give you more details if you want.

				I have a morphine sulfate pill, 60MG. It&#039;s peach colored, 60 / ABG.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if I can break it into smaller IR doses? I was thinking like 10mg doses because that seems to work for me for analgesic effects. I take them by insufflation, it seems to be easiest when I just ate, etc.<br /><br />Is this possible/ easy?

				yeah it&#039;s possible.<br />I&#039;d probably take at least 30mg of morphine but that&#039;s me everyone has their own opiate method.

				I noticed a couple Morphine Sulfates (http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/6770, http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/6762) pop up over in the opiates section.<br /><br />Does anybody have any comment on these compared to Roxies (the 30mg IR in particular)? What does the drug feel like and what&#039;s the best way to take it? Is it a worthwhile substitute or a different beast all together?
