				I was on &quot;ARD&quot; which is a probation program with court ordered drug screening for 3 years and I was able to pass every time and I did drugs the same day of the tests.<br />&nbsp;I have a bought a sneaky little devise with a fake dick (looks real) which has a special valve and tube system with a heated pack with synthetic clean urine (comes as a powder that you mix with water) and it is covertly strapped under your armpit and its kept at proper temp for testing then tubes run through the thing with a special valve that opens when you lightly squeeze the head, like you would normally while taking a piss, and the thing looks 100% flawless, I passed countless supervised UT&#039;s with the thing and the synthetic urine is flawless and always will pass all drug tests and its scientifically same ass clean piss, just a safer not toxic version.<br />&nbsp; It is flawless and will not fail or get you busted , seriously. As long as you are not black skin (that would be a give away) it should match any Caucasian, even maybe some llighter skinned non caucasian could fly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It includes all the parts and synthetics, detailed instructions and it is perfectly functional and sterynized well after every use.<br />&nbsp;I have been off probation for a few years now so its just sitting in the closet and so i figured maybe someone can use it... Plus If I keep it forever, some day someone else will come across it in my closet and be like &quot;WTF is this guy into??&quot; <br />&nbsp;If anyone is interested in this thing, Make me an offer! I paid over $500 and it was hard as shit to get because it is not legal and all but I don&#039;t need it so MAKE AN OFFER!<br />&nbsp; PM or reply with any Q&#039;s or PM me to make offers, BTC or maybe trades or whatever.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If I sell it for BTC, I will donate some to the forum, pay tribute<br />&nbsp;Not trying to break any rules here or sell shit without paying, just don&#039;t know any other way and would like to pass this thing to someone who needs it.<br />&nbsp;

Bought one of those first and you might as well just take you chances pissing yourself, that POS will get you cought without a doubt. It don&#039;t look real, really shitty design and valve system but Learn that for yourself like I did but I sent mine back. If you are in a situation where passing the UT without being being detected, the extra money was worth my freedom!! <br />&nbsp; It was worn over boxers for me and sanitized as the instructions mandate after each use!!!

				I only just added a listing for urine drug test kits on the road tonight (Australians only). These are the same ones workplaces use to test their employees. It has all the anti-cheating features eg pH level, temperature gauge, creatinine and more. Good to get familiar with it all if you want to learn how to beat a drug test. If you don&#039;t get the temperature exactly right within 1 degree, and the urine is old or diluted - they can tell. <br /><br />The best way is simply to get clean for a while in order to take the test. Make excuses as to why you can&#039;t take the test immediately (you&#039;re sick, your parents died etc etc). <br /><br />Urine Drug Test : THC, Cocaine, Benzos, Opiates, Amphetamines, Meth Amphetamines<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e3d53a1a30<br /><br />Some workplaces are strict about taking drugs for no good reason (eg office work), but others I can see why .. (eg School bus drivers... sorry I wouldn&#039;t want any of you guys driving my kids to school!) Although in an ideal world testing would be about immediate intoxication, not mere presence. <br /><br />I hope this test kit on the road goes some way to minimizing harm and best case scenario - keeping someone get clean enough not to lose their job, and not to endanger others.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stay Safe, <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.<br /><br />
