				<br />Levamisole is a scourge to modern drug users. It reportedly has been found in most large scale cocaine seizures by the USA&#039;s DEA. It is very similar in look and chemical properties cocaine HCL. (White/slightly off white, opalescent)<br /><br />It has legitimate uses: As an anthelmintic in the treatment of many nematodes particularly in veterinary applications (Dewormer!). It is also an immunomodulator as an adjunct with fluorouracil to make it work better against colon cancer. <br /><br />Having said that, chronic use in the dosages it can be found in most cocaine hauls will lead to serious side effects. Specifically, it will reduce the effectiveness of your immune system. Large patches of blackened skin and localised infections. Generally, things we could live without&nbsp; :D<br /><br />It is also said to raise dopamine levels - one of the three neurotransmitters that make cocaine feel good. This is said to increase euphoric feelings of cocaine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this post is to help us all wash our stashes and remove levamisole. I don&#039;t have any reagents that will test for levamisole. Does anyone know of one? <br /><br />From my research, I&#039;ve found that levamisole is soluble in water and methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol and methylene chloride; insoluble in ether; stable in acid aqueous media but hydrolyzes in alkaline (or neutral) solutions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found plenty of evidence to the contrary but most of that is anecdotal and not from any &quot;legitimate&quot; chemical research sites. If you know something, please share it here. <br /><br />Now, cocaine HCL is very soluble in water, freely soluble in alcohol, soluble in chloroform glycerin and non soluble in ether <br /><br />Notice the similarities? <br /><br />From what I can gather, levamisole is only slightly soluble in ethanol, whereas cocaine is highly soluble in ethanol. It should be a matter of washing one&#039;s stash of cocaine in ethanol and filtering out the levamisole. <br /><br />I&#039;ve mentioned my method of washing my stash in a few posts - (triple acetone -&gt; water wash) It&#039;s not as effective as an A/B extraction, but it works very well and none of the chemicals are on any watch lists where I am. If one added an ethanol was to this (straight after the acetone washes), this should (in theory) remove most of the levamisole. <br /><br />Hopefully there are some others here that can chime in and help me on my quest. <br /><br />Grey

				Levamisole is the scourge of modern day cocaine.&nbsp; Its very similar properties to cocaine makes it very difficult for even experienced people to separate.&nbsp; If your information on ethanol is correct, and I am no chemist, I would suggest chilling the ethanol in the freezer (lower temp reduces solubility of slightly soluble chemicals) and using only the minimum amount of ethanol for the total weight to dissolve if it was all cocaine.&nbsp; Sounds like you already have a Merck Index, check it out.&nbsp; Let us know if you have any success!

				From what I&#039;ve read it is almost impossible to remove due to extremely similar properties. It is also very difficult to test for. I&#039;ve also read that unless you are really blasting through a large quantity such as a serious crack addiction, levamisole isn&#039;t going to hurt you too much. That said there seems to be certain individuals allergic or highly sensitive to the drug and that it can be extremely dangerous for them.<br /><br />I also am very very unhappy with the levamisole news. There needs to be a concerted effort to get the Colombians, Bolivias, Peruvians, whatever cartel is doing this shit, to stop and the only way is to be able to test for it and refuse it.

				I have a theory that levamisole may vaporise / have a much lower flashpoint than cocaine HCL. <br /><br />I will do some further investigation. <br /><br />If this is so, I can use one of my special ovens to vaporise the levamisole, leaving the cocaine HCL intact. I was thinking of perhaps doing a very slow staggered/incremental heating after my usual acetone and water wash ... bringing it right up to a ceiling close to the 187C flashpoint. I&#039;d like to get a profile of all the usual cutters/adulterants and establish what their flashpoints are. Wouldn&#039;t be good if they accidentally caught fire ..&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Just pure conjecture at this point. Shoot down my theory if you&#039;re able. <br /><br />

				A DEA report from 2008 indicated this, it&#039;s not new news.&nbsp; You would think if the majority of cocaine was tainted with levamisole and the risks of levamisole were so great as purported to be, that there would be a very large number of sickly blister covered coke addicted users on the verge of dieing.&nbsp; The fact is, there are not a huge amount of sick people as a result of&nbsp; the levamisole tainted coke.&nbsp; I have a feeling that what the DEA claims as the quantity of levamisole tainted cocaine seized is far from the truth.&nbsp; And even if the coke is tainted with levamisole, is there even a large enough quantity in coke to be of concern? I doubt it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Quote from Dance Safe:<br />&quot;The Drug Enforcement Administration (D.E.A.) says levamisole appeared in 69 percent of the drug it has seized in 2008.

If you know what you&#039;re doing though you should give it a go.&nbsp; I also saw noted that levamisole is sensitive to light, so who knows, maybe some time under UV is needed to negate any ill-effects.<br />

				An ethanol wash may not help, since it usually contains quite a bit of water.<br /><br />Why not just make it into crack and rinse with water?
