Like I said you you before I appreciate your frustration however this is how SR forums operate so you will need to re-frame your perspectives if you are going to overcome your unhappiness with this aspect of how the forums run.<br /><br />Welcome to the road.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Apparently the mods believe that potentially harmful trolling is acceptable and considered &quot;free speech&quot;. But oh wait, guns and CP aren&#039;t sold here either for that exact reason. e.g. causing harm to others. Fucking hypocrisy at its finest. Great job mods on fostering a forum of immaturity and potentially lethal advice. Can&#039;t wait til I get banned for my free speech that here for calling out a mod, but hey, these forums have proven to be an invariable shithole.

				Like I said man you need a thick skin for forums in general lol<br /><br />These types are here to stay for now so you either lump it and deal with or post elsewhere, I know that sounds harsh and I hope it&#039;s not coming across offensive man, but thats.. forums
