				I am attending EDC this year in Vegas and as a new SR user I have been immersing myself in <br />all the great knowledge found on this forum and elsewhere. Anyways I would love some help in<br />planning out my 3 day drug lineup. I will have access and am planning to have access to 2-cb, Weed, MDMA, LSD, and depending on some other people possibly some DMT. <br /><br />History: I got a med card in California so I smoke weed often and I have taken LSD once in my life and had a great trip while smoking gratuitous amounts of weed passively through the trip. I have also taken MDMA a bunch of times at raves or clubs.&nbsp; I have never done 2cb but I am interested and willing to try it out and have looked into it heavily. I have also never done DMT but if we do get DMT we would most likely do it in the hotel, and not at the festival.<br />&nbsp;<br />I am hesitant about taking acid at the festival due in part to the huge spectacle of it all, it might be to overwhelming. Or it might be just the thing to do if i can handle it which I think I can. My friend has advised me though that I might not be experienced enough to handle LSD at a festival due to my minimal experience. A candy flip (MDMA + LSD) is a possible solution Ive considered.<br />I don’t want to burn myself out on the first day or unnecessarily deplete serotonin or other neurochemicals for later days. I am aware there are some cross tolerances between some of these drugs but am not knowledgeable enough at this time to make that distinction entirely. I will also be supplementing with &quot;Raveaid&quot; which has helped tremendously with my rolling experiences in the past with little to no negative comedown. (http://www.raveaid.com/Articles.asp?ID=242) So in conclusion the main questions I would like help with are as follows, <br /><br />I am worried that the amount of people and the spectacle may throw me off while tripping hence the candy flip, am I right to think this? <br />What do you think is the best way for me to plan out my days?<br />Cross tolerances between 2c-b, LSD, MDMA, (maybe DMT)?<br /><br />Drugs Lineup:<br />&nbsp;2c-b <br />&nbsp;LSD<br />&nbsp;Weed/Edibles<br />&nbsp;MDMA <br />&nbsp;Xanax (if trip goes south)<br /><br />My consideration so far based on my current knowledge is<br />Day 1 -&nbsp; 2cb (Experience new drug/test my handling of milder than lsd psychedelic)<br />Day 2 – LSD + Weed (LSD if day 1 goes well, Weed with Booze if not)<br />Day 3 – MDMA (Save for last to avoid possible drain)

				Mmmm!&nbsp; that sounds like quite a exciting line up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would give a thumbs up to mid doses of 2c-b and MDMA as both being safe substances for wild festivals(Cannabis is a good neuro-protectant, so smoke lots while your on these stimulators).&nbsp; Both tend to leave your Ego in tact, worst case scenario you end up trusting someone more then you should(smiles, hugs, etc).&nbsp; &nbsp; Be careful with the LSD if your not a very experienced tripper or don&#039;t have a really tight crew that will be keeping a eye on you.&nbsp; Especially don&#039;t go mixing it with Cannabis unless you are feeling especially safe, that can boost the effects to mind melting levels.&nbsp; Xannax and a safe place to retreat to is a good idea in any case(dissolve under the tounge you will feel the loops melt away).&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, with the DMT if you can find a place in nature that you can sit peacefully for 10 minutes you will probably appreciate it more than you would in a hotel room,&nbsp; but if you have to, maybe burn a candle and turn the lights out with some good music.&nbsp; I have also found light doses of DMT mixed in with my joints on the dance floor have always been a welcomed boost, but you have to know what a light dose is.

				i personally would do the l before the 2c-b just because i wouldnt want to taint a true lsd experience.<br /><br />and i was going to say, try to have a day in which you dont do any drugs, at electric forest i slept through an entire day because i felt so strung out.<br /><br />even though i hate alcohol, i feel that it would be useful at a festi so you can stay loosened up but you dont have to fry your serotonin receptors!<br /><br />idk though man you know yourself more than any of us do, just plan ahead and stay safe!<br /><br />(i second the lsd in a social environment statement as well. things can get weird if you dose too high around all of those people/cops)

				If you&#039;ve never tripped in public or at a rave I&#039;d make sure you get mentally ready for it. Especially at EDC Vegas. All I did last year was roll and there were times every night that I was rolling so hard I would look around and almost&nbsp; freak out because of what all was going on. Its really overwhelming. I agree with wavelength. Recently I have started to stay sober the first day of multiple day festivals so I can get a feel for things. I&#039;m so vulnerable when Im tripping on L or 2-cb so most the time I play it safe. But looking back on it, it would&#039;ve been awesome to trip there so I hope you have a blast man!

				I would hesitate to take a lot of LSD at the sort of music festival EDM is if you really are not experienced with it...but I say that because it&#039;s not my cup of tea at all, really don&#039;t enjoy the crowds at that sort of fest<br /><br />EDM will, as someone said, have a lot going on; lights glaring at you constantly and flashing, people goin crazy all around you in both the way they look and act, constant high temp electronic music...<br /><br />don&#039;t get me wrong I love to party and dance all night, but sometimes when I was not very experienced with psychedelics and I took them in an environment that was very crowded, loud, and hectic (IE EDM) I would almost feel relieved when the more intense portion of the trip was over. <br /><br />now for me at say, a music festival like summercamp or all good that I will be attending, I am gonna trip all kinds of balls and have a blast, but it&#039;s a lot more mellow, laid back environment (in my opinion) and I have tripped countless times at this point.<br /><br />2CB is a nice compromise as for me it is a lot more lucid and less of a mindfuck than LSD or mushrooms, with a really fun body high thats great to dance on. Acid can also give me crazy energy at concerts, or sometimes not, it&#039;s just such a diverse/complex molecule you never know.<br /><br />mdma is a pretty safe bet for a good time<br /><br />and yea amen to people telling you to get some rest, did the same thing &amp; slept through a day at summercamp all of sunday last year and missed some great bands just because I couldn&#039;t sleep a fuckin wink friday or saturday nights. xanax is a wonderful thing to have for the end of the night<br />sounds like you&#039;ve done your research about it already, and the fact that you&#039;re on here asking for advice makes you more cautious than 95% of drug users. have fun man

				Have you thought about taking amphetamine on one of the days? Perhaps the last day, because you will most likely be tired and worn out. The amphetamine would help you power through the da and enjoy it more.

				Thanks for the help for those who posted. I think I will hold back on the LSD for a later date at a more controlled environment based on my lack of major experience with psychedelics and some of the advice given here. I still believe I believe I will still take the 2cb the first day, leave the second day for recuperation if needed, and then go all out the third with MDMA.

				My rule with festivals is to generally do LSD on the first day, as I like being fresh and clean for it.
