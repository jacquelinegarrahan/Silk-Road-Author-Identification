				Hello All!<br /><br />This is my first post here, so I hope it isn&#039;t too shabby. <br />I had a few questions about 25i. I have never experienced it, nor many other psychedelics, besides mushrooms, which was a very good intense trip. <br />I weigh in at about 130 pounds and take medication for bi-polar disorder, lamotrigine (anti-suppressant) and welbutrin (anti-depressant).<br />I&#039;ve read many trip experiences and it seems to be very strong in similarities to LSD. I want to try a 1mg tab but am a little too nervous or scared of whats to come.<br />Is 1mg a dangerous dose for someone of my body weight and prescribed medication? What precautions should be taken? Also, while here, has anyone every obtained these tabs from OZ before? How reliant should I be on the vendors when dealing with this chemical drug?<br /><br />Thanks in advance! :)

				I can&#039;t comment (with doctor certainty) about your SSRI/etc. usage affecting 25i.<br />You might need to check Erowid.org or the clearnet for a safe answer to that.<br />I would reccomend sustainging/reducing dosage of both of those if possible for a few days to a week (IF possible) up until the day of the trip.<br />That might help flush your system of said prescriptions.<br />I can say 1mg is not a bad amount, almost as others said LSD lite, you could always try a 1/2 tab (500mcg) and give yourself a few hours to see how it feels to you.<br />Given the duration ~8-10hrs, you still have plenty of time to add a little more if you feel very comfortable with a 1/2 tab, otherwise stick to a small amount for the first time.&nbsp; &lt;-- to see how you react with it<br /><br />I can comment on Duderugz tabs, he&#039;s a legit vendor, who knows how to lay the 25i carefully onto sheets/tabs. I would look around at vendor reviews to see how that vendor might stack up.<br /><br />Be safe, and good luck!&nbsp;

				1mg is fine, I wouldn&#039;t take any less but the reason I say that is I find a lot of people try a small amount of psychedelics first and get the mind fuck without the entertainment and then say they&#039;ll never try it again...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about Oz, I got mine from kwiktrip but have some on the way from foxymeow that I&#039;m looking forward to, and have read good things about duderugz as well.
