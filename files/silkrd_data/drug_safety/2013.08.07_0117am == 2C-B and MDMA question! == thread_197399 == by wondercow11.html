				A 15mg 2C-B cap will be psychedelic, with some visuals. Your headspace won&#039;t be too bad though. A lot of people like to take 2C-B on the comedown of a roll, since they have some similar effects.<br /><br />As for the MDMA, 250mg is quite a bit. You should do 150mg, then wait 60-90 minutes and then drop another 70mg or so.

Many people take MDMA first then about an hour later take the 2C-B. The effects combine much better this way, and smooths out the come down from MDMA with less desire to redose.<br /><br />I agree with others about the dose.<br /><br />You only have a finite amount of serotonin, taking a large dose does nothing extra for you. Once that is used up it is used up. Taking more MDMA doesn&#039;t create more serotonin. In fact serotonin takes some time to be replenished between MDMA use.<br /><br />Much better to take a dose worked out for your body size and then a booster later. A full dose is generally 75mg - 150mg depending on the individual (1.7 mg per KG). A booster will be 60-70mg 2-3 hours later.<br /><br />If it was me, I would drop 130mg then the 2C-B and hour later. Sit back and enjoy the ride and no re dosing.<br /><br />Getting into a habit of taking a larger dose of MDMA because you think the current quality is bad, is a dangerous thing to do. Quality varies enormously within batches and suppliers. The next lot could be spot on, you pop 500mg, and it&#039;s a trip to the hospital. You say you are a big guy, how big?<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to be rude, I just want to point out that people who are grossly obese, or who have diabetes, high blood pressure or heart conditions have a greater risk of overdose death from any stimulant<br /><br />Because of the way MDMA works you are just wasting your stash if you chase the high. Much better to dose correctly and if it doesn&#039;t work out, walk away. There will be another day and opportunity.<br /><br />FH<br />

				when I tried 2c-b orally it got like 2 hours to kick in :\<br /><br />molly, tried 2 times, exactly 30 minutes!<br /><br />so my advice is to get 2c-b and then after you are high on it, mdma. 2c-b last longer than mdma.<br /><br />with molly I use 2mg/kg and a redose 1/3 after 1 hour, stay hydrated and fresh (water not alcohol lol, don&#039;t overdo, it&#039;s dangerous too) and take care, take some fresh air far from the sun, take some pause if you are dancing, you get really hot.<br />Take some bubblegum with you.

The calculations of 15-20 mg/kg is just a rough estimate for people who have never tried MDMA before so that they have a general guideline of how much they should take. You seem like you&#039;ve rolled a few times and are familiar with how the drug affects your body and if you feel like 250mg is a good dose then who are we to tell you otherwise? I can tell you though, that a re-dose of 250mg would be irresponsible and potentially detrimental to your health. There is a lot of information on these forums and other boards that can explain in-depth the cycle of serotonin uptake and depletion that occurs after ingesting MDMA so I won&#039;t go into details about that. You should know, however, that a 15-20 mg/kg and a re-dose of 1/3 to 1/2 the original dose after you have come up fully (1 to 1.5 hours in) is the standard guideline that most people follow and is thought to maximize the positive effects and minimize the negative effects. The re-dose is not needed for a good roll, it is only ever used to maintain the same high for an extended period of time. A normal roll will last around 4 hours, with a re-dose it could last up to 6 hours. From these guidelines, you can experiment and develop your own procedure when rolling.<br /><br />The main purpose of combining 2C-B with MDMA is to ease the comedown of the MDMA and preserve the feelings of euphoria, empathy as well as physical energy. Quoting Shulgin in PiHKAL, &quot;The most successful reports have followed a program in which the two drugs are not used at the same time, nor even too closely spaced. It appears that the optimum time for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the MDMA&quot;. It takes anywhere between 30 - 90 minutes for the 2C-b effects to kick in (taken orally) and the effects last around 4 hours so if you are planning to combine this way (which I highly recommend), you will be high for a lot longer than a standard single-dosed roll (you should plan for this).<br /><br />Here is a general guideline I suggest you follow:<br />Start: 250mg MDMA ingested<br />1.5 Hours after initial dose: 100mg MDMA ingested<br />5 Hours after initial dose: 15mg 2C-B ingested<br />8-10 hours after initial dose: First signs of fatigue and comedown<br /><br />Hope this helps, remember to be safe.<br /><br />Much love,<br />Tilted
