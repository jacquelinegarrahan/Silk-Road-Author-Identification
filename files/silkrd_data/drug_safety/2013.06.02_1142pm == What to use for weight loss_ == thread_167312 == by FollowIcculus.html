				I currently am on a new exercise regiment and very low calorie diet.&nbsp; I already take 20MG Adderall XRs first thing in the morning.&nbsp; Any other idea&#039;s of substances to help shed some fat?&nbsp; I started a thread about that DNP stuff and got a resounding NO! from two people.&nbsp; What other options do I have?&nbsp; &nbsp;Has anyone tried this &quot;Black Silk&quot; stuff sold by 2hotchicks?&nbsp; They don&#039;t tell you the main ingredient so that kinda weirds me out.&nbsp; Anything else I can take along with my adderall to help shed pounds fast?&nbsp; Also open to just general weight loss tips too.

				T3 and clenbuterol. Or an ephedra/ephedrine, caffeine, aspirin (ECA) stack.&nbsp; Best to not use these with adderall though! Alternating between them would be much healthier. Phentermine is another to look into. <br /><br />If you are already eating fewer calories than you need and exercising then patience may be your best ally. Maybe save drugsfor any stubborn few pounds that remain.&nbsp; That&#039;s where they&#039;ll be most handy.<br /><br />Good luck :)<br />

				Black Silk&#039;s secret ingredient is a small amount of MDPV, probably like 3-5mg. Reviews say it works but I dunno. I do know that MDPV really works for weight loss. When I was using it, I lost 20lbs. I&#039;m 130 now. lol, not really a good thing since I wasn&#039;t using it for weight loss, but if you&#039;re trying to lose weight then it&#039;ll work for you. It&#039;s dangerous in terms of responsibility though so you&#039;d have to be really careful.

				The general recommendation is to eat 500-1000 calories below your maintenance level, ~1g/lb protein, and exercise 3 days a week. Sticking to that, you will lose weight, guaranteed. It&#039;s no secret. However, if you are a female willing to do anything to lose 100lbs quick, or a male that does not care about significant muscle mass loss and simply wants a defined abdomen, then I would say you&#039;re better off with the amphetamine route.

MDPV is known to cause psychosis so you just might want to stop taking the Adderalls so the two don&#039;t produce any amphetamine synergy if the Black Silk has a high dose in them, MDPV is also very hard to sleep on. MDPV is dangerous because of the urge to redose, I consider myself to have responsibility but I lost control with this substance a few times and now it scares me too much to ever want to touch it again. Look up some reports on Erowid if you haven&#039;t already, and you&#039;ll know what I mean.

I never bothered with aspirin because unless you&#039;re super obese it apparently does not help much at all. Ephedrine is okay if you&#039;re smart about it and stick to at least four hours between every 25mg dose. Sometimes I took it earlier than that and experienced chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, some of the typical symptoms of a heart attack. You also gotta stay hydrated, and also make sure you&#039;re getting enough potassium and other nutrients. And also watch your caffeine intake.

ADRs associated with ephedrine therapy include:[15]<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, vasoconstriction with hypertension<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Dermatological: flushing, sweating, acne vulgaris<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Gastrointestinal: nausea<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Genitourinary: decreased urination due to vasoconstriction of renal arteries. Also, difficulty urinating is not uncommon, as alpha-agonists such as ephedrine constrict the internal urethral sphincter, mimicking the effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Nervous system: restlessness, confusion, insomnia, mild euphoria, mania/hallucinations (rare except in previously existing psychiatric conditions), delusions, formication (may be possible, but lacks documented evidence) paranoia, hostility, panic, agitation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Respiratory: dyspnea, pulmonary edema<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Miscellaneous: dizziness, headache, tremor, hyperglycemic reactions, dry mouth&quot;<br /><br />If you&#039;re healthy ephedrine shouldn&#039;t pose a problem, it&#039;s by far one of the safer drugs for weight loss.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you decide to go the clen route start out at a low dose to judge your body&#039;s ability to handle it.&nbsp; It&#039;s honestly not a pleasant experience at medium to high doses.&nbsp; It&#039;s also not going to do much if you aren&#039;t already in shape.&nbsp; It&#039;s not going to shed 40lbs in a month, but it will mess with your joints and potentially do permanent heart damage.&nbsp; I highly recommend checking out some of the steroid forums that are out there.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of useful information on there, and you&#039;ll quickly find that diet and exercise are your best bet for weight loss.&nbsp; If you&#039;re dead set on trying to get quicker results I&#039;d recommend ECA or Albuterol and some CLA along with plenty of exercise and a proper diet.<br /><br />

				I would try to get Adderall IR (instant release) because it worked better for me , as far as being able to control the effects. The &#039;ER&#039; doesn&#039;t work properly for me. The whole &#039;one size fits all&#039; of &#039;ER&#039; medicines is just plain dumb. Everyone is different. <br /><br />Clenbuterol is a steroid used to treat respiratory illnesses in horses. It&#039;s never been approved or even tested for use in humans, but there’s evidence from animal studies that it’s taken up by muscle tissues throughout the body, and therefore can damage the heart muscle. <br /><br />Only dumb models and dumb athletes would put that shit in their bodies. IMHO ;)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t intend on losing weight, but did via Adderall, then when I lost health insurance, I found the Silk Road, then when the prices began to soar, I found the Amphetamine listings. - Not METH-amphetamine, just amphetamine. There&#039;s a big difference. Meth is highly neuro-toxic, whereas amphetamine, unless consumed in binge worthy doses, is relatively harmless. <br /><br />You can find some really good &#039;speed&#039; as we call it (not METH), on here. Right now, top dog is CapeCrusader. Ships from S. Africa, but don&#039;t let that frighten you. He&#039;s a 100% seller, and just look at the Speed/Amph thread. He is a wizard of a chemist. His stuff is more along the lines of Dexedrine. A cleaner, smoother head. With very little &#039;negative bodyload&#039; ie; Tachycardia etc<br /><br />I&#039;m in my 40&#039;s, and 6&#039; 2&quot;. I used to weigh 250 lbs, and just thought I was a &#039;big fella&#039;. I look back on pictures of me from 2 years ago. - I was a fat fuck!<br /><br />Now 170 lbs, my previuosly high cholesterol is &#039;below normal&#039;. Also I had high blood pressure, which is now always normal. <br /><br />I eat once or twice a day. Sometimes I fast for a day. Though when I do eat, I make it the healthiest thing I can get my hands on. Can even have a little fat! (actually you need fat). <br /><br />Well that&#039;s all of my unprofessional advice. <br /><br />Good Luck!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />PS. Also stay away from Sibutramine (previously brand named Meridia-banned in the US now) - I was out of Amph, and my ex-wife had some Sibutramine with her when visiting. I took two and thought I was going to have a heart attack!<br /><br />Also T3 is a Thyroid Hormone. You don&#039;t want to fuck with that shit either. It can do damage as well. <br />

				do coke. it can help you perform better at the gym, and it depresses the hunger center in the brain so you don&#039;t feel hungry as often and thus eat less.

The ephedrine gives you a pretty good deal of energy while reducing appetite. <br /><br />The downside for me is that ephedrine can be problematic if you have any anxiety issues. If you have none at all, i would recommend this treatment for weight loss. <br /><br />It does make you really edgy if you take large amounts however. At times i used ephedrine as a party drug of sorts to keep awake, and it really does&nbsp; a decent job at that. The downside of that is that you&#039;ll probably drink a fair bit more with the calories that come with it, so if&nbsp; weight loss is your goal only take it in the morning, not when going out at night.

				MDPV and meth work a charm, but like previously stated have high habituation risk and can make you crazy. You could dry getting a prescription from your doctor for Adderall. Then you&#039;ll be less likely to abuse them &amp; you&#039;ll also be able to exercise on it unlike most stimulants.
