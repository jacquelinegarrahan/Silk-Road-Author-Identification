				Back in my early 20s the popular drugs were weed, cocaine (no crack but there was freebase), LSD, shrooms, speed, MDA and MDMA, PCP and heroin. Did all of those except H in some case to excess. LSD was a fave, but now it&#039;s too big of a commitment unless you&#039;re at a festival. I see all this new shit here that I had never heard of like nbome and 25C and every letter combination imaginable. I&#039;d like a psychedelic similar to acid but shorter acting. Or I&#039;d like to try modern Molly MDMA. The stuff I had 20+ years ago was pure white powder/crystals and it blew your mind and made you want to dance and fuck!<br /><br />Now I&#039;m an adult with children (grown and out of the nest) and married to a woman who will smoke weed but considers the other stuff dangerous. Could probably talk her into shrooms. She smoke Spice for a while so she has some bravery (or stupidity). But maybe I should worry about what I should try next. I need it to be a trip I return from! Really curious. Googled a bunch of the stuff but Google woudn&#039;t tell which I should try!

				2c-b and 25i-NBOMe sound like a good fit.<br /><br />2c-b is gentle and fun, similar to taking LSD and MDMA at the same time but not...<br /><br />25i-NBOMe is similar to acid but has a different type of warmth and the effects don&#039;t linger as long. If you snort it, the effects can be short acting.<br /><br />4-AcO-DMT is very much like Mushrooms, maybe even better but isn&#039;t as forgiving as 2c-b.<br /><br />of course, there is DMT as well.

				not that old. Just half a century and a daily pot/hash smoker since I was 14 (took a few years off here and there). Once was a cocaine fiend but quit cold turkey when I had a premonition I would die. Tripped a lot back when Jerry was alive. Shroom about once every 2 years on average.Like my pain killers.

Read about them on sites like erowid and bluelight. You could then work your way up to stronger psychedelics like LSD, 2C-E, Shrooms. By strength I am referring to cognitive intensity of the drug. For me, stimulants are fun, but a little too much, so I only use them rarely now a days. For other drugs I&#039;d think you&#039;d love MDMA, especially if you haven&#039;t had it in 20 years. Benzos are fun the first couple of times you use them, and dissociative can be really cool too (Ketamine/MXE/DXM/PCP/etc..).

				Hubby and I have been exploring NBOME&#039;s lately: B, C, D, and I ... I wrote a summary of affects here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27995.msg329295#msg329295<br /><br />The most profound experience we shared lately was with mxe + 2c-c. Here is a trip report: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28015.msg325329#msg325329<br /><br />If tripping alone, 25i or 25b would be better depending on what you wanted to do with your time. And while it&#039;s not quite the same, mxe+2c-c would still be a wicked ride solo (just don&#039;t forget the music).

				I agree with a lot of the other posters here.<br />2cb and 25i seems like the best fit for you if you want to get back into psychedelics and try something new.<br />Easy to handle, but still intense.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably recommend a strong dose of each as you&#039;re already quite experienced with a lot of drugs.&nbsp; Maybe 30mg and 1.5 to 2mg.<br />Of course, that&#039;s just a suggestion i&#039;m throwing out there, nothing more.

				25b is the funnest of the nbomes when staying in with a movie or two. Still scenes become flowing with life and action scenes will pop out of your screen and flow all around you. <br /><br />We watched Secret Life of Arietty and a lot of times we felt like we had shrunk to the size of &quot;borrowers&quot; and big things were happening all around us. Our crappy computer speakers sounded like digital surround sound and we became so emotionally involved in the story, we felt like kids again. Hubby took 2mg and couldn&#039;t even finish The Dark Crystal ... imagine being scared of a bunch of muppets!<br /><br />Don&#039;t start with 2mg though, 1mg should be plenty.

				The drug you are looking for is DMT. The trips lasts 5 minutes tops and has about a ~20 minute afterglow after which you will be perfecetly functional/normal. On DMT you can easily hit a ++++ on the Shulgin scale. Watch the documentary &quot;The Spirit Molecule&quot; with your wife and she might open up to the idea.

				yo dude, i&#039;m older too....not quite as old as you but certainly not a kid.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried a lot of the 2c whatever, 4-ho-stuff, DOX.....you&#039;re not missing anything with those.&nbsp; they&#039;re all bullshit compared to LSD and mushrooms, and IMO a waste of time.<br /><br />if you&#039;ve never tried Ketamine or DMT, you should...they are very worthwhile experiences and neither is a huge time commitment.&nbsp; ketamine is more for pleasure and DMT is more for discovery, but both are highly psychedelic.&nbsp; ketamine can be habit forming, but its not a huge deal if you have a small amount of self control...you have to really WANT to get addicted to K.&nbsp; as for DMT, if you develop a habit with that, then God bless you:&nbsp; you are a Buddha.<br /><br />and if you REALLY want to trip balls, there&#039;s always Salvia.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; be careful with this one though, only take sally if you&#039;re a true warrior; the truth she teaches can be quite disturbing to even the most seasoned psychedelic user.&nbsp; Personally, my use of salvia divinorum has been one of the most important things I&#039;ve ever done and from it I have gained much strength and wisdom, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to most people....its kinda like a horror show.&nbsp; so if you find value in being horrified than go for it&nbsp; :P<br /><br />aside from that, it sounds like you&#039;ve been around the block there ain&#039;t much new for ya unless you want to get into stimulants (lots of new ones, but like all stims they are hella bad for you) or lame psychedelics.<br /><br />MXE is kinda cool, but its not that much different than taking a bunch of DXM (cough syrup).

				From someone how is close to your own age&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If your wife smokes, then the easiest to convene her to try with you will be shrooms. All natural, no chance of OD, etc. If taken in small doses say 2g you can have a good time and still function.

You had to handsome with a big dick so of course, I got in!<br /><br />Once there, I guess every women in the place headed for yours truly. I was surrounded by lady flesh and juggling and jiggling and pert little ones.<br /><br />Then the alarm clock went off and Mrs Red reminded me she never has sex in the morning. She threw me a tissue before leaving for work.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Well, seriously, I&#039;m no spring chicken and it is like a WTF moment for older people who generally still have access to the usual common drugs but have never seen a lot of the new drugs which are &#039;research chemicals&#039; which is a loophole in the law. Most of the &#039;new&#039; drugs here have been being used since the 60s, 70s AFAIK. It is just the internet and the willingness of foreign chemical companies and chemists to reproduce chemical formulaes to produce drugs perhaps patented in the 1920&#039;s, 30s or whatever.<br /><br />I find that shrooms and LSD offer all I need with the psychedelics. I am tempted to get a dab of some of these 1mg dosage chems but I do not think I need it myself. For therapy I got MDMA, for insight and a blow out its LSD. Shrooms are just, well, shrooms! Nothing like them. But you got to be with true friends! Or be of sound mind and with no worry. Psychedelics can give the horrors! I have had this. We all have I guess. That is why you start with psychedelics with friends and can use alone once you know what you can handle.<br /><br />Horrors helps many - its an outpouring of fear, better out than in but the ride can be wild.<br /><br />Good luck again.<br /><br />And the 60 yr old guy with the cannabis. I once got asked by a guy that age or so for some cannabis for pain relief from arthritis. I rolled a joint or two and left instructions which he ignored. I stated that he ought to take two tokes then wait for 20-30 mins. He took two tokes, waited for a minute, then smoked all of one joint. It was a creeper, often is for first time tokers. It was also powerful and he thought he was going to die. Panic attack for sure. He was lying in his bed looking at the ceiling buzzing so much he though he was dying.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />He never smoked again.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />My choice of &#039;new&#039; drugs is narrowing down. Mrs Red is going camping with me and when camping I go native, I like LSD, shrooms, with coke being a big no no. What use is coke sitting in a tent? Mrs Red says she will take a gram regardless as I have a stash that the Rolling Stones would be in awe of. But I will be hiking and rock climbing. I like camping wild and so do a few of the guys I know. We have some great times. You can get fucked up in the wild and using psychedelics like LSD and shrooms nobody can overdose on. Some of the new chems can range from 100mg doses to even 0.5mg. I hope all vendors label the bags!<br /><br />My choice would be a bit of K. Not a &#039;new&#039; drug but new to older people. It is well tested and fairly safe if used correctly. That is a new experience. A few of the guys in work use it.<br /><br />For LSD style experiences, maybe go for some of the exotic shrooms out there! A fine selection here on SR. I am going hunting for shrooms in the UK, with the rain so far, we may have a glut of shrooms here come Aug/Sept/Oct. 100 grams for 2 BTC&nbsp; ;D Less? More?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Good luck with the hunt for something new.<br /><br />As for the new RCs out there one good thing is that they will not cost the earth and its not time consuming, not like LSD were.<br /><br />When will of course take valium with us just in case! Knowing that is there can get you over any horrors.<br /><br />Funny how Valium is making a big comeback mainly as a parachute for trippers and coke, speed and other users. Always keep a few pills or pre measured doses of valium aside IF you dabble in certain drugs.<br /><br />Regards to older people.<br /><br />We had all the best drugs so know what good shit is.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Wow thanks for all the responses. Did some shrooms the other night at a concert. Should have eaten one more chocolate square I think but it was pleasant.

Currently I have one USA Std Strat all stock and one custom tele from the Korean custom shop with dual seymour duncan humbuckers. Plays like a Fender but has a rock tone like a Les Paul or SG. I used to be a fairly strict Strat purest but lately I&#039;ve been enjoying teles more. I used to find them tinny sounding. Maybe the popularity of teles in country music (Brad Paisley, Keith Urban) combined with the long-time Tele-vangelists like Springsteen have swayed me. I listen to everything from class metal to modern country to alt rock. When a play some mixture of all that comes out. I used to play live in bar bands but tired of that game and now just play for my own enjoyment. BTW for acoustic guitars I&#039;m something of a Taylor fanatic.

				Taylors, taylors, taylors, and more Taylors. <br /><br />I love Taylor&#039;s too. I have one really nice nice nice Martin though. <br /><br />Anyways, you should try some 5-Meo-MiPT, since it seems you like shrooms, I would recommend some 4-Aco-DMT as well. 25I is nice, so is 25C. Personally I prefer the 25x-Nbome compounds to any of the 2-C-x&#039;s, so I&#039;m not exactly impartial. <br /><br />25I is a great starting point though. I would go with some of dannyboone&#039;s 2 mg blotter on that one. Perhaps some of DiMiTriSpice&#039;s pharmayahuasca, or some of Trojan&#039;s? They&#039;re both great sellers, and both have a hell of a product in those little capsules. <br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				thomasm13, thanks for the advice. My first Taylor was a 714ce and I loved it. I sold it at one point and tried a few other models.

I don&#039;t think anybody really knows me well enough for me to even want to consider being around others. Maybe my cousin. <br /><br />Ah, Breedloves! My dad had one and I grew up sneaking into the basement to play it late at night. What beauties all those Gibson acoustics are. I just had a chance to play a nearly mint 1965 Breedlove Orchestra model in some new shop near where I live. Jesus man, the sweet sweet sounds of that guitar. <br /><br />You play any other instruments or strictly those with big bellies and strings tighter than Tipper Gore&#039;s ass, with far more action in all the right places, I might add.... ? <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend some good LSD salesman but I only have experience with international orders. In a few weeks reviews should come pouring in for Kat&#039;s though.

Screams like a tortured housewife screams for lack of anything better to do, but man does this guitar have things to do, you know? Great things at that, it&#039;ll be like Grant or Nikola Tesla or Stephen Hero, and it&#039;ll do all those things just cause it can scream through old heads and new cabinets and a whole universe of Moog pedals and fuzz faces and wah-wah&#039;s and talk boxes... <br /><br />My father used to have a strat with literally the exact same configuration.

				it&#039;s funny for me any talk of music, guitar or drugs soon morphs into a discussion of all three! I&#039;m mostly guitar and vocals, but in this gimmicky band I once played bass, drums and keyboards for a song or two.&nbsp; I like a real piano but sometimes use a Midi keyboard as a synth, piano and electric drums, But a lot of that uses a simple two finger hunt and peck style! I just find the art of marking music so profoundly awesome. it makes me high whether I do it straight or high.<br /><br />Kind of baked on some hash and sativa right now.

I actually don&#039;t even gig as a guitar player anymore, trumpet primarily. Used to be keyboards, I had a Moog Voyager- you have not lived until you have played a jam on a Moog while high on a ten strip of LSD. That&#039;s all there is to it! <br /><br />Yeah, there&#039;s a great line from some song that says if &quot;I want consciousness expansion, I just go down and sing&quot;.
