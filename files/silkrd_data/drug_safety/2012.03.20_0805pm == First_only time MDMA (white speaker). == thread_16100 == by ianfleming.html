				Ok, so my girl and I have 2 white speakers.<br />We were planning on taking them this Sunday (5 days from now).<br /><br />Both her, and I are taking this just so that we know what it&#039;s like, we&#039;re not really planning on making a big thing out of it.<br />Consider it an experiment.<br />I like 2c-i and take it occasionally (maybe 2 or 3 times a month). She drinks somtimes but she&#039;s not a drug user.<br />Neither of us smoke (cigarettes or bud).<br /><br />As I said, we have 2 white speakers from &quot;MadeinHolland&quot; (I assume they are the same as all other white speakers)<br />I weigh 120lb she&#039;s 140lb.<br /><br />We&#039;re planning on taking it mid day, on an empty stomach (she may eat a granola bar a few hours prior). Nothing but fruit juices and water.<br />After dosing we have water (literally gallons of it) and maybe some juice.<br />We&#039;ve got 5-htp for the aftereffects(1 per every 6 hours for the next 3 days).<br /><br />We&#039;re not preloading. Neither of us take any medication. I take melatonin to sleep (6mg per night) but I figure this will hurt the effects of the MDMA, so I&#039;m stopping for the next 5 days.<br /><br />We&#039;re planning on staying at home and not going out, we&#039;ll have music and each other.<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s my few questions,<br /><br />-First, does this seem like a good plan, or are there other variable I should factor in or things I should know?<br /><br />-Second, should we take the entire speaker or break it and take the smaller half at the 45 minute mark? She&#039;s afraid that if she splits the bean that she might not feel the full effects of the MDMA, but I worry that taking the whole pill at once is a waste. What should we do?<br /><br />-Third, will my nightly melatonin affect the power of the MDMA? Am i right in stopping or can I continue to take it?<br /><br />-Last, can she drive 5 or 6 hours after dosing?

				Hi !<br /><br />For me taking some MDMA with my girlfriend always sounds like a good plan !&nbsp; <br /><br />I would just add some gums and take some magnesium before dosing to avoid jaw clenching. Don&#039;t forget to plan what you need for the &quot;after roll&quot;, personally I hate to have something to do after rolling ! <br /><br />Take the whole pill or an half is a huge debate ! You will trip harder if you take the whole pill and might be overwhelmed when it peaks but it won&#039;t last long and shouldn&#039;t be a problem if you are home. You may vomit too, but not a big deal.<br />If you take an half, your roll will be less intense but last longer, it&#039;s a smoother sensation that may disappoint people who look for an heavier trip. As it&#039;s your first time with MDMA I would recommend to begin with an half, don&#039;t forget&nbsp; some people are more sensitive than others, we should always start softly when we try a new substance.<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely not a good idea to plan driving 6 hours after dosing, in fact it&#039;s not a good idea to plan anything after that, except cool things ! <br /><br />Be safe and enjoy, first time with MDMA is always an amazing experience.<br /><br />WL

				Hmmmm, I guess we&#039;ll go for a half.<br />I am used to taking 10-20 mg 2c-i, but for her sake we&#039;ll go softly.

				Ok, do NOT drink gallons of water if you&#039;re just staying home! Alternate between water and orange juice or some kind of sports drink, about 1 cup per hour until you start to come down though you might not even need that much unless your climbing the walls. Sometimes I experience time dilation so I&#039;ll set a timer to remind me to see if I&#039;m thirsty. <br /><br />Get some gum in case your jaw starts to clench, though preloading with magnesium would help too. Some people use pacifiers. <br /><br />And the only way she wont feel a half speaker is if she ate a lot beforehand. <br /><br />I would not let her drive after 6 hours. Have her spend the night and plan to sleep in the next day. <br />

				If it&#039;s your first and only time then I&#039;d do the whole pill tbh. I think the avg dose for full effects is 100mg so if the pill is only say 100-120mg then you could be underwhelmed. I don&#039;t know how much MD these pills contain however, so if they&#039;re a high dose it might be okay.

Remember that pills are pressed with stuff other than mdma to feign strength. And this is a very high quality pill. <br />

				I wouldn&#039;t see any problem with the meltonin, its just like seratonin that is being used. But I would probably do a half maybe 3/4. MDMA can be overwhelming. 2 mg per kg of body weight. I dropped a blue buddha my first time, 60-80 mg of mdma with a tiny bit of speed and I rolled BALLS. Stick to half and you will probably end up eating the other half later lol. No one does MDMA once haha way to amazing of an experience. This isn&#039;t a drug that gets you fucked up, its a very clean feeling high and just pure happiness. Enjoy :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				We rolled today and it was INTENSE.<br /><br />We took half a speaker, took a 40 minute bath and then popped the other half.<br />I started feeling it in the tub, she didn&#039;t feel it until afterwards.<br />There was a funny moment at the beginning of her peak, were she was literally rolling around on the floor yelling &quot;WOW&quot; (this lasted maybe 3 minutes and was quite amusing).<br /><br />We had a GREAT time, discussed our relationship and we were honest about a few things that we had been less than truthful about before.<br />We both feel that it was a VERY good thing, it helped us get our relationship back on track and work some things out.<br />Also went to a meadow and put a blanket down and just talked for a long time. It was wonderful.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It might be your first but I guarantee it won&#039;t be your only time </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>As much as I hate to admit it, Wowzers was right. We are planning on taking this again.<br />We&#039;re planning on the equinox, twice yearly, from now on. It really helped us a lot.<br />

				This is exactly why mdma should be legal. For responsible adults who inform themselves the danger currently lies more in contamination (and abvious LE issues) than the actual drug itself.<br /><br />Quite jealous though. My wife is anti-drug and although i explained that&#039;s it doens&#039;t really alter your consciousness in a major way she refuses to take it. I think with m we could sort out the various blockades we have.

She&#039;s always been very shy about drugs, she drinks sometimes but never smoked pot or done any drugs (except attempting to smoke catnip with her brother when she was maybe 14).<br /><br />She&#039;s always been kind of scared about my use of 2c-i.<br />But, when she said that she had been curious in the past about extacy and lsd-25, I realized I could get some and share an experience with her.<br /><br />I was never really the sort to take MDMA, and I still think it should be a therapeutic drug (I wouldn&#039;t take it just for fun).<br />I firmly believe that it should be taken maybe 2-4 times a year as a vacation and learning experience. Not every month.<br /><br />Seeing as how my previous use had only been with 2c-x chemicals, some speed in high school, I was also not really prepared for this.<br /><br />As we are both young adults, we did this at my mothers place so that we had an experienced individual to be there in case things got out of hand. (My mother and father used to take MDMA when they were younger).<br /><br />Either way, about an hour and a half in she said that she finally understood what the idea of psychedelics was about.<br />She experienced some closed eye visuals (my mother says that effect is usually only seen in women).<br />Otherwise it was a very good time, and now shes a little more open, accepting and willing to try some other stuff with me.<br />----------<br /><br />On a side note, the most amusing part of the whole experience was probably when it first hit me. As I said, I&#039;m used to 2c-x chemicals so I was expecting to &quot;trip&quot;.<br />We were in the Bathtub, I had been talking but once I started to feel it I got a lot quieter. I found that for a few minutes I had a hard time speaking and was incredibly dizzy. For a while it also felt as though my head was stuffed with cotton balls, yet i could hear just fine.<br /><br />She looked up at me and noted &quot;your eyes are huge baby&quot;<br />About this time I was falling into my roll and could think again.<br /><br />I looked up at the corner, were 2 of the walls and the ceiling meet. This bathroom is undergoing renovations (for the past 4 years) so it&#039;s not in the best of condition, even so, I was just awestruck by how white and clinical (but in a pretty way) the walls and ceiling were. <br /><br /><br />I was just not quite ready for that.
