				Hey SR<br /><br />What is everyone&#039;s method for storing their blotters? (would be good to see some vendors chime in too)<br /><br />I keep mine in a ziplock bag inside a sealed glass jar in the fridge.<br /><br />Also, when handling them ie; breaking tabs off for friends etc - does the natural oils on your hands destroy the chemicals on the blotters? Would freshly washed and well dried hands be fine to just quickly tear a few tabs off at a time? <br /><br />Thanks :D

				I&#039;m curious to know as well. I&#039;ll be getting LSD soon. Also, how can I safely transport this on a plane? Better to just put it on my carry on or pocket or check in my luggage? Thanks

				Keep away from light, heat, moisture, and oxygen. Wouldn&#039;t worry about handling the blotters. I always wash my hands and break off what I need them reseal.

				I&#039;ve stored blotter for over a year in a small plastic baggie(powdered drug size) without loss of potency. I made sure it wasn&#039;t exposed to light except when being handled(tearing off a few for a fun weekend).&nbsp; I try to minimize contact with my hands or anything else really while handling.&nbsp; It can absorb through the skin and I don&#039;t want to weaken the blotters by having some of the &#039;cid wipe off on my fingers.&nbsp; I DO lick my fingers afterward anyways in case. :P

				Light and moisture are the main problems, followed by heat. A lot of people worry about it too much though. I&#039;ve had blotters that were good after a year sat in a drawer in northern queensland which is super humid...<br /><br />Do you have some desiccant in the jar and let it come to room temp before opening? You should.

				I second catfishinmysocks&#039; comment about some sort of desiccant - maybe rice? this could make it inconspicuous, too. wrap in foil, seal in ziploc (or vacseal if you&#039;re planning on LOOOOONNNNGGG term storage), shove inside sealed jar of rice away from light and heat.<br /><br />When handling, I only handle the very edges and cut with scissors, even if they&#039;re perf&#039;d, so that my skin doesn&#039;t steal any acid from the tabs :P

				If you have a Google there&#039;s an article about some people trying one of the original sealed Sandoz vials a few years back. It was perfectly good after decades without any special storage, amber glass to stop the light and air-free (moisture in air being the risk).
