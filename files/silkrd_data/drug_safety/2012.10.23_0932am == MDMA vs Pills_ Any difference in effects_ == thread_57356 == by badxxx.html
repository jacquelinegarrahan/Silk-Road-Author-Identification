				Hi,<br /><br />a friend of mine said, with pills everybody sees that he is on XTC pills. On crystal MDMA nobody sees it. And that&#039;s exactly what he feels like. Pills are much stronger for him. (He rolls quite often and had many different pills and crystals!)<br />I have never used pills so far, because I&#039;m afraid of substances i do not want to use. But i feel the same effects like him on crystal mdma. Quite smooth and not very heavy.<br /><br />Is my friend&#039;s opinion correct, that pills are stronger than mdma crystals? Is there any evidence?

				Concerning pills with MDMA as the only psychoactive as to not complicate things:<br /><br />- crystal gets absorbed quicker thus higher highs but quicker comedown, while pills get absorbed more evenly resulting in a longer experience with fewer ultra high peaks<br />- pills that report 200mg MDMA do have 200mg MDMA, while 200mg crystal (assuming 84% purity) has only 168mg MDMA.HCl

				I agree with your mate<br /><br />A 200mg pill (decibel) absolutely floors me whereas 200mg of crystal is at least minimum dose

				You guys need to consider all the other stuff that gets cut into pills (amphetamine, mephedrone, methamphetamine, ephedrine, caffeine for the safer ones, and dangerous ones like paracetamol, ibuprofen, talcum powder...). So keep in mind that MDMA crystals have a certain purity to them, but a pill has alot more room in the pill for other cutting agents.

				Depending on the purity and strength of a pill or powder, the effects should be somewhat close.<br /><br />I&#039;m a fan of pills because they can only be cut once when a batch is created and pressed. A pill&#039;s stamp can sometimes be an indicator of quality, unless it is a counterfeit of course. But, they have a long history of being unreliable.<br /><br />Between pills and powder there is always a chance that you don&#039;t know what you are getting, obviously. A quick look at ecstasydata will prove this.

				You can trust the pills you get from SR...they&#039;re all pure MDMA unless stated otherwise...<br /><br />before I found SR i was getting pills that were nothing but meth-bombs, methylone, and piperazines from strangers...luckily i test every pill i buy with a marquis reagent before taking it....

				Okay i tested pills by myself. I tried the new Nintendo with 200mg. They are strong and the trip was good, but not 200mg MDMA!<br /><br />I had all the effects you get when mdma is strong: Could not focus, had to sit down for a while<br /><br />But when i take 200mg clean and hard mdma i think i die. So, i by myself can not say pills are stronger and mdma :(

				I think most people would agree there is a FAR greater chance of taking an &quot;ecstasy&quot; pill that&#039;s got at least one other drug added to it if not several. I remember the first time I ever did ecstasy, swallowed a little orange 007 pill and had a crazy experience that was VERY different from my first experience with pure crystal MDMA.

				In my days of experimentation, I was able to try very clean pills and also very clean MDMA powder. What I&#039;ve decided is that with MDMA powder you can find the &quot;magic dose&quot; that will get you on the perfect level you want to be on (mine was around 125 mg I believe at the time, 1 mg/lb), but I took pills that felt just as good as pure MDMA powder. <br /><br />So in other words, I think pills can potentially hit you harder since it&#039;s a bit of a mystery game (if they&#039;re clean pills) of how much MDMA is in your pill, but if you know you have pure MDMA powder and a scale you have the guarantee of finding the right dose to roll smooth for the night. I liked having a scale and powder because I liked feeling like a gangsta on that level I knew was perfect just for me. Plus, you can add in any other goodies to the cap if you so choose ;) <br /><br />Don&#039;t dis pills though, cuz some of the best rolls I&#039;ve had were on rolls. Not to say that they felt any better than powder, just sayin that they were so clean I had a great time and didn&#039;t come down feeling nasty from any other drugs in the pills.

				I think Bluelight is a really good place to look if you&#039;re looking for basic MDMA discussion and information. I&#039;ve learned a lot in my years there.<br /><br />But to answer your original question,&nbsp; MDMA is MDMA is MDMA no matter if it&#039;s in pill, capsule, powder, or dissolved in liquid. If you have 100mg of just MDMA in a capsule versus 100mg pressed into a tab with fillers and binders, it&#039;s going to be exactly the same thing. There are no differences in effects, despite what many people have formulated their opinions on. The difference in effects between presses and powders only comes from the quality of the source.<br /><br />If your friend feels like he rolls better on pills than on powder/crystal, his dealer might just have a better connection to a good pill supply than the other stuff.

				Your friend is indeed right about this, only due to the fact that roughly 90% of the XTC pills out there, are 90% cut.. maybe thats a bit of an exaduration, but the point is, its not the MDMA in the X pills that sends you to la la land, its all the other chems they are packed with. I personal cant stand MDMA crystal or powder, for it seems to hardly have any effect on me at all..with all the super dirty/speedy/trippy X pills ive eatn in my day.
