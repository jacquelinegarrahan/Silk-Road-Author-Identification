				Hey peeps,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a Benzo or similar, something that promotes winding down and going to sleep. (I&#039;m not a smoker so don&#039;t say &#039;weed&#039;)<br /><br />Well, I might consider weed as long as I don&#039;t have to smoke it, but I know nothing about weed AT ALL so please feel free to school me.<br /><br />Currently I&#039;m taking Modafinil (100 or 200mg, depending) on those days where I feel fuzzy and just know by 2pm it will take all of my willpower not to walk into my bedroom and go to sleep.<br /><br />The downside to this, is that on the odd occasion, I&#039;ll be lying there at 11pm and that part of my brain that is the &#039;awake&#039; part won&#039;t be switching off.<br /><br />The other functionality I wouldn&#039;t mind, is the odd time when I do some Molly and want to switch that off / compress the comedown.&nbsp; I can usually sleep sort of acceptably at T-6:00-8:00 depending on how much I&#039;ve done, but if there was something I could do to promote sleep in that situation, that would be a bonus too.<br /><br />Anyone got any recommendations?

				Etizolam withoutadoubt - 6 hour half-life, so not suddenly keeling over three days later unexpectedly like diazepam with it&#039;s extremely user friendly 100hour half-life....and as a bonus it&#039;s neurogenic, so makes new brain cells, repairing the damage you&#039;ve done enjoying yourself - I always wake up after using it feeling brilliant, not fluffy headed wtf&#039;sville, like some others. I even found that although I&#039;d started off using 1mg tabs, half a pill snorted was plenty - good times :)

				I heard GHB can give you a restorative sleep. More info found here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.0 <br /><br />Be very careful though with other substances, it often doesn&#039;t mix very well.

				I&#039;d agree on xanax as&nbsp; readily available drug.<br /><br />Beware that tolerance against the hypnotic qualities of xnax will develop readily. This is no problem for occasional use, but with structural use you will find in ineffective to induce sleep, Resistance to anxiolytic effects will take longer to develop (if they do at all), so if you lay awake a worry it may just be the thing for you.

				Hey Bruce could you see any problems using diazepam as a semi-regular anxiety relief/sleep aid? Mostly to treat social anxiety and insomnia but also to help come off LSD and MDMA

				Diazepam is my favorite personally because it is long-lasting to help me stay asleep.&nbsp; It also does wonders for anxiety.&nbsp; YMMV as everyone has different body chemistry and what works best for me may not work as well for you.

Easy to procure, not too expensive, and actually feels quite nice. And I&#039;ve tried quite a few benzos in my day. Even .5 or .25 mg is enough to help ease me to sleep as long as I don&#039;t take it often. I didn&#039;t know it was a neurogenic though, I&#039;ll have to read up on that. Any links, kissmyass? <br /><br />I always wake up feeling great after etizolam sleep. Feels pretty natural and I don&#039;t experience much depression on the days following when I don&#039;t take it. Treat it with respect just like any other benzo (all of which can be dangerously addictive due to withdrawals) and you&#039;ll find that it&#039;s a great friend on those hard nights.

				GHB (or GBL which is easier to find) is used in chronic insomnia treatment, as a Xyrem, so you might consider to try it. Someone can also mention that it used to be a popular club rape drug (and Rohypnol too) so imagine how powerful drug it is...

				I second Xanax, it is great for sleep...until you run out of it.&nbsp; Man that sucks.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really like Xanax as much as other benzos because it makes me feel like I am hungover when I wake up, but not everyone has that reaction.&nbsp; I prefer Valium or Klonopin, but Xanax works much faster and is pretty strong.

				For relaxation valium and clonazepam.&nbsp; For fighting off hard crashes xanax.<br />For real sleep problems temazepam.&nbsp; Warning:&nbsp; Unlike other benzos, overdose with temazepam is very real especially when mixed with other sedatives or drugs.

Being liquid helps to do so quickly, and despite its salty taste, people may just think that their wine, beer or cocktail tastes a bit odd, but won&#039;t think to much of it as &#039;salty&#039; isn&#039;t generally recognized as dangerous. <br /><br />Temazepam has suffered the same faith though. Usually its in tablet form, but the gel caps containing dissolved temazepam would be easy to mix into a drink. Considering it causes anterograde amnesia especially in combination with alcohol, i suppose this would actually be more viable then ghb for such purposes. <br /><br />For legitimate purposes none of this matters, apart from these substances being more actively looked for, driving up prices and making them more difficult to transport. <br /><br />I&#039;ve used temazepam as a sleep aid in the past, and its fairly effective. Considering the difficulty obtaining it nowadays i&#039;d suggest going for nitrazepam instead, which also has a decently short halflife. Valium has an extremely long halflife due to its metabolites, so its not really suitable as a sleep inducing drug, unless you want to be sleepy the next day (or two) too. Clonazepam (klonopin) has the same problem, perhaps to a slightly lesser degree. <br /><br />Xanax isn&#039;t all that hypnotic, its more of an anxiolytic benzo, and tolerance against its hypnotic effects will develop very quickly. <br />
