				From my limited experience of having only tried marijuana and cocaine, I have had wonderful head-ringing, body-tingling rushes from smoking (crack) and shooting (IV-ing) cocaine. What other drugs give you similar intense rushes as cocaine? Heroin? Crystal Meth? All inputs from experienced users will be welcome. Thanks.

				If you breath deeply a few times then exhale and have a friend bearhug you you&#039;ll black out and go into a weird tunnelvision state. Only did it once, but then again im not the type to intentionally damage myself.

				LSD can give you a pure rush of electric euphoria, even at lower doses. Meth also gives an intense rush but its nowhere near LSD in my opinion, it doesn&#039;t seem to give me any euphoria, but it does make me extremely focused on whatever I&#039;m doing. I&#039;ve worked out and wrote papers while on that stuff lol, but I&#039;ve stayed away from it ever since. Tolerance grows rapidly and can lead to pretty bad addiction, so just be careful if you&#039;re gonna try it man.

				DMT, especially 5-MEO-DMT is top of the list for me. Truly mind bending and takes you from normal reality &#039;to infinity and beyond&#039; off a decent hit!<br /><br />Ketamine is one of the most pleasurable rushes for me.<br /><br />IV H is up there too, but not really my thing. Tried a few times out of curiosity, but never again, becoming an addict is very easy.<br /><br />Nitrous is a good laugh too.<br /><br />Guess it depends on what sort of &#039;rush&#039; your after.

				Best rush I&#039;ve ever experienced was from IVing h for the first time.&nbsp; Holy shit I collapsed onto a couch and was simply amazed at the euphoria that engulfs you&#039;re entire body in warmth.&nbsp; It&#039;s like when you were a little kid on Christmas morning combined with when you have sex on molly.&nbsp; No other experience like it, not acid, any stimulant or even prescription opiate.&nbsp; Pure bliss, but then 6 hours later you realize that you just shot dope...

				For me &#039;best&#039; and &#039;most intense&#039; are two difference things. <br /><br />The best rush I have had was from 2c-i, you cant fail to have a great time on it as it makes you feel fantastic before the trippyness kicks in. That was my experience anyway. <br /><br />The most intense is a toss up between Salvia and Hawaiian mushrooms. <br /><br />I had only tried mexican shrooms before (apparently quite mild) and so did the same dose when I got some hawaiian ones, not realizing that they were much much stronger. 5 dry grams a&#039;la Bill Hicks in case you are wondering. Also made the mistake of taking them when a bit down. Spent most of night convinced people on tv were talking about me and being chased through my house by invisible demons. Not fun!<br /><br />The salvia I found to be a very scary drug, it hits so fast and hard you literally have to have someone ready to catch the bong when you drop it! I took a huge hit one night (after pot, baby woodrose, and absinthe). Got the familiar &#039;pulled out of body up and too the left&#039; feeling. Then suddenly I ceased to exist, I am guessing i experienced what LSD users call &#039;ego death&#039;. I was everywhere in the universe at once, but &#039;I&#039; didn&#039;t exist (hard to explain sober lol) Then suddenly I rushed back into my body in the kitchen, a feeling like the whole universe snapped back and shot into my head. Pretty damn intense!<br /><br />Have avoided salvia since but will try it again someday. This is going to sound really stupid but I get the feeling Salvia is sentient. If you disrespect it, then the green goddess will kick your ass!&nbsp; But have respect for it and use it warily and you ll be ok. Anyone who has experienced the green goddess on salvia will tell you it definitely has a &#039;personality&#039;. <br /><br />Freaky i know!

				I have never IV&#039;ed anything.<br />I don&#039;t smoke my crystals/powders.<br />I have not tried plugging.<br /><br />So its snorting, eating, or gums for me.<br />And hand down, the winner for me is:<br />GOOD COKE..<br />and i mean GOOD coke.<br />Its hard to find good coke.<br />

				IV heroin, but be careful with that shit.<br /><br />Properly vaporized DMT is incredible.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been a huge fan of IM&#039;d Ketamine, but again, that&#039;s risky as well. Helps to have someone sober do it for you just to be safe.

				SPEEDBALL (IV coke and heroin)!<br /><br />The worlds two most popular drugs (for good reason), that both combine to be greater than each individually!<br />I&#039;m in love with speedballs, which hasn&#039;t been good for my life or bank balance. I would never give a friend (or stranger) their first speedball, I wouldn&#039;t want that on my conscience if their life went down hill because of it. <br /><br />Addictive personality + two very addictive drugs IV&#039;ed = a two fold addiction!

				As far as rushes go, the Grand Wizard would give it a toss-up between crack and vaporized MDPV.&nbsp; Crack is more instantly euphoric but there&#039;s something about smoked MDPV that is even more fiendish than freebase coke (if you can believe that).&nbsp; Both of them will turn you into a lab rat pulling a lever so I don&#039;t really recommend either.&nbsp; <br /><br />For a slightly milder but still great comeup I&#039;m partial to genuine 4,MMC. Unfortunately there&#039;s so much shit meph going around that I haven&#039;t picked up any lately.&nbsp;

				DMT when you get the dosage just right - It&#039;s in a whole different league and makes every other drug look like Tylenol. Unbelievable but true.

				Forgot to add a big hit of crack, which is often overlooked by most users. It&#039;s a wonderful little drug that most people don&#039;t ever think about trying.<br /><br />I personally would love to try IV&#039;d Ketamine, but someone would have to do that for me.
