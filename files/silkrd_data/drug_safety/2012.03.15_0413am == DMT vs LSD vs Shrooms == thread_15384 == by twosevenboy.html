				I&#039;m interested in trying one of these three, and am only experienced with weed. <br /><br />What are your suggestions, for a novice, on what to take. Any information on dosage, expectations, and some short comparisons would be great&nbsp; :D. <br />I&#039;ll be doing this with a couple close friends who have already done LSD, but am doubtful it compares to the quality on SR.

				Start with the shrooms... progress to acid.. and graduate with DMT. That&#039;s the usual advice and I think it&#039;s sound myself.

				I&#039;d definitely start with shrooms and work my way up from there. DMT is just on a whole different platform than those two. If you breakthrough, you will have a very otherworldly out of body experience, complete with entities and profound realizations within a span of 10-12 minutes. LSD and mushrooms are in the more benign psychedelic state, although very powerful as well. With LSD you will have ego loss, and you may disconnect with reality, or shatter it completely, but it will be at higher dosages. Shrooms offer a very introspective experience, but not at the level of the latter.<br /><br />It really depends on what you&#039;re looking for though. I would recommend shrooms for an introduction into psychedelics, and depending on what you want out of it, be it spiritual/introspective/recreational, they are probably the best for novice psychonauts. LSD is a pretty good notch above mushies, with much more apparent and complex OEV and CEVs, along with deep introspection as well as a deep emotional connection with everything and everyone around you. DMT again, is several notches above even LSD. If you&#039;re looking for a complete shattering of reality even at low or &#039;non&#039; breakthrough doses, as well as the most complex visuals and something that the latter two do not offer; the awareness of trans-dimensional entities and connection to the divine.<br /><br />You can start with whatever you&#039;d like, but it is up to you to be truly prepared for whatever you&#039;re getting yourself into.

				They are all tryptamines and have somewhat similar effects but at varying intensities. I would start with shrooms as they are the least intense of the 3.<br />This post covers what you can expect visually pretty well:<br />http://disregardeverythingisay.tumblr.com/post/9331287956/the-visual-components-of-a-psychedelic-experience<br /><br />DM Turner described the experiences you can expect from each of these drugs very well in his Essential Psychedelics Guide.<br />DMT:<br />http://am4wuhz3zifexz5u.onion/Library/English/Drugs/Psychdelic/the%20essential%20psychdelic%20guide%20DM%20Turner/D_%20M_%20Turner%20-%20DMT.htm<br />LSD:<br />http://am4wuhz3zifexz5u.onion/Library/English/Drugs/Psychdelic/the%20essential%20psychdelic%20guide%20DM%20Turner/D_%20M_%20Turner%20-%20LSD.htm<br />Mushrooms:<br />http://am4wuhz3zifexz5u.onion/Library/English/Drugs/Psychdelic/the%20essential%20psychdelic%20guide%20DM%20Turner/D_%20M_%20Turner%20-%20Psilocybin%20Mushrooms.htm

				It depends on your reason for taking said substance. How much personal research have you done?<br /><br />All that follows is based on my personal experience, feel free to take it or leave it:<br /><br />Background: I&#039;m a lightweight when it comes to psychedelics (and drugs in general), almost always the easiest to get off of all my friends. Also, I tend to enjoy &quot;bad&quot; trips, as they are generally an excellent teaching tool and a confidence booster, which is why I tell people I&#039;ve never had a bad trip, just intense ones (intense for me means genuinely out-of-my-mind).<br /><br />3 S&#039;s (Set, Setting, and Substance): The first two are by far the most important to a good psychedelic experience. If you&#039;re crabby, depressed, dog just died, whatever, it&#039;s probably not a good time for your first trip. Psychedelics can be valuable tools for personal healing, but depending on the dose, it can be a lot to take in, so I recommend the first time be taken in a positive mindset. Setting is just as important. It can be difficult to interact with people who aren&#039;t tripping when you&#039;re tripping, especially at a strong dose. That being said, I do recommend a trusted friend (sitter), preferably with experience with the substance in question, who is either not taking any or not taking as much as the rest of you to keep an eye on things. Have some toys around, art books to look at, and good music to listen to, you&#039;ll be amazed by how significant the simplest of things can become.<br /><br />A fairly strong dose of LSD was my first psychedelic, and that has proven to be an experience that has stuck with me to this day. I find it to be quite possibly the best tool for introspection and self-examination. This can get a little harsh at times, and with higher doses the come-down can be a bit rough. The first 3-5 hours of a good &#039;cid trip, however, last a lifetime and are generally amazing. Also, the sex on LSD is generally amazing. LSD doesn&#039;t usually hallucinate for me; last time I smoked a bunch of hash (I mean a LOT) about 1.5-2 hours in, and that was absolutely amazing. Never done more than 400mcg or so (I&#039;m guessing), and some of those experiences have gotten pretty intense (some pretty terrifying moments, actually).<br /><br />Mushrooms are great, one of my favorites for exploring nature. One experience in particular stands out (NOT a good first trip experience!!!): 4.5 dried grams of good shrooms (p. cubensis), powdered in a coffee grinder, soaked in lemon juice for 10 minutes, and then taken as a shot. Within 10 minutes I was tripping, within 20 the visuals (open-eyed) were approaching DMT intensity, and after about 30 minutes I lost all touch with this reality for a good 2 hours or so. Incredibly intense experience. For the first time, I&#039;d recommend a gram or two and a good hike outside. Chew them until there&#039;s nothing left to chew or you feel the trip coming on: once swallowed, mushrooms are generally not broken down much by the digestive system, so you either want to powder them or chew them to oblivion.<br /><br />DMT is simply amazing. I would generally not recommend it as a first trip, as it is a bit intense, and while it might be enjoyable, I don&#039;t think you&#039;d bring much back from it. Other hallucinogens tend to alter this 3-D reality we normally find ourselves in, resulting in you &quot;feeling&quot; like you&#039;re intoxicated, like you&#039;ve taken a drug. DMT, at a full break-through dose, is more like magic than a drug: it takes *you* from this place and puts you into something completely different. A very powerful experience. I truly believe one of the other two substances (or one of the analogues of mushrooms, like 4-HO-MET or 4-AcO-DMT) is the best starting off point. Save DMT for when you think you have the psychedelic experience under control. :)<br /><br />If you take Set and Setting into consideration (and I suggest you do), there is absolutely no reason to pussy-foot around with the dose. Take 2 good hits of LSD or 2-3 grams of mushrooms. Have some pot on hand, as it tends to kick up the hallucinations when smoked at critical junctures, or mellow you out if you&#039;re starting to lose it (if you&#039;re an experienced smoker and pot normally mellows you out).<br /><br />Above all, be safe, have fun, and come back with a story!<br /><br />That may be more information than you wanted, but I&#039;ve got time to kill at the moment. Hope that helps!

				Forgot to mention something important. If you&#039;re looking to just have a fun time with your buddies and trip for the fuck of it, go with shrooms or LSD. DMT isn&#039;t that type of compound, nor should it be treated as such. Not to mention each of you should take turns with intervals of about 20 minutes until you&#039;re nearing baseline. LSD and shrooms last long enough, and the ingestion method being oral, is far simpler to accomplish than a breakthrough dose of DMT. Hell, you&#039;ll end up wasting 50-75% of the product attempting to find a suitable way to efficiently dose with the substance.<br /><br />I&#039;ll just leave you with this psychedelic analogy. Taking shrooms your first time and experiencing other than weed, is like jumping off the diving board into the icy depths of psychedelia. LSD to me would be like going on a 8 1/2 hour bungee jump, and the peak lasting about 3 hours, would be like the first rush you get when you jump off from the top of the platform. DMT is like base jumping from the top of the Sears Tower or other similarly tall skyscraper without a parachute. You may think you can handle it at first, but that&#039;s all talk until you&#039;re teetering off of the edge, wondering if it was a good idea.

				Wow! Really appreciate all the responses on this. Some great information here. I will definitely make sure I&#039;m in a good place, both physically and mentally before I attempt any of this. I am leaning towards shrooms. and was wondering which is better for going out into nature. Wallclimber mentioned going exploring while on shrooms, and wanted to know if anyone else had a preference for going outside.<br /><br />Also, if I do end up going and exploring should I alter the dose any so I don&#039;t have an intense trip. Intensity not necessarily being a bad thing, just a heads up either way.<br /><br />Apologies if this post is confusing, its been a&nbsp; long day&nbsp; :).

				I would recommend going with a slightly smaller dose if you do not plan on having a sitter. Setting is also important: if you are going to be outside someplace where you don&#039;t have much of a chance of running into other people or the public in general, a larger dose would probably be okay, as opposed to if you were in a relatively populated city park or botanic garden or something like that. If you have access to a clear night sky, looking at the stars is also highly recommended!! <br /><br />Safe travels!
