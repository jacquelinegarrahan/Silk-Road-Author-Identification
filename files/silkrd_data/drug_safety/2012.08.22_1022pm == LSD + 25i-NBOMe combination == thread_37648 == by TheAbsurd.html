				I checked erowid and the internet in general but I couldn&#039;t find any reports of this combination. 1) Do you think it&#039;s safe? 2) Has anyone here tried it? How was it? 3) Do you think the combination could be synergetic and I could end up tripping way too hard?<br /><br />My plan is to take 2 hits of acid. They&#039;re the dolphin blotters that Jannis was selling, estimated at ~100ug. I tripped on one of them last week and I was somewhat underwhelmed (probably lost potency when they were shipped). I think 2 hits would be perfect, but I&#039;m really looking to push the envelope and thought I could add 500ug of 25i-NBOMe (half a blotter from HardHustle).<br /><br />The setting would be at home. I want to have &quot;the&quot; trip.<br /><br />I&#039;d rather not trip as hard and not lose the magic LSD tends to have, but maybe 25i will only make it more magical. These are my last 2 hits of acid so I don&#039;t want them to go to waste with a weak trip.

				25i-NBOMe is highly active on the 5-HTA2 receptors ( hxxps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT_receptor ) (apparently more than LSD) which makes it such a quality psychedelic. The problem at high doses is vasoconstriction. 500ug _should_ be safe, it&#039;s really higher doses were you really need to start worrying.<br /><br />Someone on bluelight.ru has probably tried this combination if you&#039;d like to find more comments / experiences

				Ah yeah, I&#039;m a little worried about how 25i works on my receptors. I was thinking the 25i might somehow overpower the LSD even though I&#039;m taking more LSD.<br /><br />I know 500ug of 25i-NBOMe should be safe alone, but I don&#039;t know if the side-effects could be increased with this combo.<br /><br />I&#039;ll check bluelight, thanks. I can&#039;t seem to find anything so far though.

				Don&#039;t try this combo. Seriously. Don&#039;t. Around the 1 hour mark I was basically passing out as if I had taken 2mg of Xanax and needed to sleep asap. That&#039;s how strong the sedation was. Obviously something went terribly wrong because these aren&#039;t exactly the sleepiest of drugs.<br /><br />If you are curious yes I went through ego-death and even real death (cause I thought I was dying) and I guess I got &quot;the&quot; trip but I don&#039;t recommend this combo at all. I feel so strongly about this and you shouldn&#039;t take this with a grain of salt cause I&#039;m telling you what happened to me.

				Really sorry to hear it mate. I assumed this would be a lot of fun. What doses did you take? I have noticed 25i can make me slightly drowsy for the first hour or 2 of the trip. Do you think if your dosage was dialed back it would have been funner?

The funny thing is this is the first trip I don&#039;t smoke weed in (until I was safely coming down). Otherwise it would&#039;ve gotten really really weird. I was still tripping solidly at the 10th or 12th hour still. The 25i was totally overpowering but it almost felt like a new drug. I can honestly say I hardly felt the LSD. I can&#039;t say it would&#039;ve been funner because it felt completely unsafe and I am not recommending this combo to anyone.<br /><br />My biggest concern is the remaining of this 25i. It was obviously the synergy and I shouldn&#039;t be concerned about trying 25i right? Not that I ever want to trip again hahaha.<br /><br />The peak was extremely dramatic. I felt everything.
