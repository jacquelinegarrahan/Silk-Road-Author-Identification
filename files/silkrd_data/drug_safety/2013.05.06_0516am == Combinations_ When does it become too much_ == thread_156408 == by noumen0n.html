				I was hoping for some advice from people who have had first hand experiences with drug combinations, specifically psychedelics.&nbsp; I have some mdma, lsd, dom, shrooms, ketamine, cocaine and of course weed. These are all from SR so I dont doubt the potency or quality. Would it be too much to combine all of these in &quot;small&quot; doses? Are there any health concerns?<br /><br />Dosage:<br />130mg mdma<br />100ug lsd<br />5mg dom<br />2g shrooms<br />A few bumps of ket and coke throughout the trip, as well as hits of weed.<br /><br />If I were to go through with this, I&#039;d start with the dom and wait an hour for the lsd. Then wait another hour and take the shrooms and mdma together. Ultimately, I&#039;m not too sure about combining the dom with the others since it&#039;s not as widely used and there isn&#039;t a lot of information on it. Because the visuals are similar to lsd, I want to treat it as if its just another 100ug dose, but I know thats foolish.<br /><br />What are your guys thoughts? Should I change the dosage or timing or just not do it at all?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :D

				I would *suspect* based on my baseless and arrogant instinct that doing coke would negate the feelings of at least the lsd and shrooms, if not the others as well.<br /><br />I was tripping recently with some of my friends. Some of them decided to do a line of coke a few hours in. Before snorting, there was a nice 5-10 minute period of &quot;crisis&quot;/argument as people were concerned what the coke was cut with based on how it looked or some stupid blah blah blah bullshit. Then they done a line and said it didn&#039;t really do anything. <br /><br />So maybe I&#039;m a bit biased, plus I&#039;m not a big fan of coke.<br /><br />

				its gonna last too long.. comedown will be shitty. because of the Dom. and because of the coke. <br />get some benzos. <br /><br />and cross tolerance occurs with shrooms and acid. take them at the same time. <br /><br />mdma and coke combo could get dangerous. combining stimulants is never a good idea. bad for the heart. <br /><br />the whole thing sounds like a speedy mess to me... to be honest. acid is a bit speedy, Dom is speedy, mdma is speedy, coke is speedy<br /><br />skip the Dom! the dose could be too much (in combination) lasts too long&nbsp; and there is not enough info about it. <br /><br />good luck! and have a nice trip!

				if its good coke it will suppress the lsd psychedelics and mdma euphoria for a while<br />this can be used as a &#039;time out&#039; during or versus the end of the trip imo&nbsp; ;) <br />i would use ketamine in the very beginning when your mind is still fresh and not so disoriented.<br />ketamine while peaking on lsd/shrooms/DOM can be pretty fucked up...<br />personally i wouldn&#039;t mix so many psychedelics,&nbsp; but hey its your call<br />I strongly advice to get some opium - its like a safety boat sailing you safe to the land of sanity<br /><br />have fun<br /><br />...i know i would&nbsp; :)<br /><br />edit: the weed works perfect to lift the lsd euphoria at the beginning, would smoke it 40-80 min after consuming

				Thanks for the advice everyone. I think I&#039;ll leave out the DOM and use the coke sparingly near the end of the trip. I&#039;ve always been interested what ket is like at the peak of a trip, but I&#039;ll be sure to not do too much to k-hole. That doesn&#039;t sound like it&#039;d be very fun haha.
