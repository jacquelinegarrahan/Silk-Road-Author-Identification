				I dont use meth anymore but near the end of my use every time I took my first hit (smoking) it would make me gag and almost throw up (sometimes I actually did) I dont know if it was the taste or my body just trying to scream out ohhh noooo not this stuff again!! get out !!! <br />It just makes me cringe thinkin of that taste, after it was coursing thru my bloodstream though it didnt bother me one bit.

But yea pretty much everytime I take a fairly big or larger hit, it just makes me want to atleast gag ( I guess some people are calling it dry retch?) but I occasionally take hits that are just so horrible tasting that it makes me actually throw up slightly, never anything bad but just like heartburn acid reflux kinda garbage. I agree with you that its probably just your bodies reaction to the assortment of chemicals in it, it feels like it needs them out when it tastes something that bad but then it submits to it once it feels the effects lol. Best way I can describe it, but I definitely agree.<br /><br />To answer the op, I personally dont IV so I cant give you a good estimate, but I do not think you should need anywhere near that amount when IVing. I have quite the high tolerance myself and when I smoke it I usually only need maybe 20-30mgs at most to feel a real nice effect, and it should take less when IVing since it comes on faster and is absorbed much, much quicker and more effectively. I assume what you got had to have been fairly bad for it to take 100mgs. If I were you, I assume you are on SR because you are purchasing on there, so you should look for vendors from the US that ship to AUS, a few that I have and havent tried ( Ill say whichs one I have and havent) that I could suggest would be. <br /><br />1. DubG, havent tried him but he supposedly is a mainly international shipper and is known for it.<br /><br />2. FirstClassFix I have only tried him once and it was a very small order, but it seemed like atleast a 7 or higher on a scale of&nbsp; 1-10. He is supposed to be good at international too.<br /><br />3. Xinhai Ive tried him and his gear was alright, it was cut with something though for sure.But he also has listings exclusively for aussies last I checked so you can give him a whirl.<br /><br />Thats it for people I can recommend for international/aus shipping but if you dont feel like trying them, then you can ask Kush411 ( when hes back from his vacation or w/e it is) if he will ship to AUS. His product has a pretty high premium but it was the last stuff ive purchased on the road and its lasted me 2 weeks on a teener. I personally consider his gear to consistently be in the top 3 quality wise and most of the time #1. <br /><br />Thats the best advice I can give atm, hope you appreciate it.

				My opinion (that no one cares about I&#039;m certain) is that the taste, like so many other things in life, is mostly all in your mind!<br /><br />Sure, I&#039;ve had some variance in tastes depending on the quality of the batch and other shit in it, and generally what tastes good is quite pure and gets me going along super nicely, but I&#039;ve never had any ice that actually made me gag from the taste... and I&#039;ve had some that would have been 1% meth if lucky and the rest being someone&#039;s crystallized urine (not a cat&#039;s mind you...)<br /><br />anywho, to the OP are you actually referring to the &quot;cough&quot;?? I hear many IV-ers refer to the &quot;cough&quot; as the ultimate sign of quality..<br />I don&#039;t partake in using needles, however can advise based on substantial experience that DubG delivers the highest quality shit around!<br />Out of a crapload of orders I&#039;ve had with him, he&#039;s delivered it to me 100% of the time (to our fkt up &quot;Gaol&quot;-cell of a country) and his quality has never disappointed me. His current batch however is on a whole different level, very HIGHLY recommended before it runs out! Get on it mate and throw another shard on the barbie! :)

It will heavily depend on your tolerance of course.

				I don&#039;t do meth that often, but I had 100mg to play with tonight and wanted to test out different levels. I&#039;d say I definitely have medium tolerance to amphetamines at the moment.<br /><br />Smoked 100mg within 1 hour:<br /><br />25mg - significantly high<br />+ 10 mins: 25mg - Feeling strong effects but not yet &#039;tweaked out&#039;. Still social level but barely.<br />+ 20-30 mins: 50mg - Tweaked out properly. I would feel slightly weird/uncomfortable in social situations. High as fuck.<br /><br />Meth was probly rated &quot;Good + clean, not amazing&quot;. No/little taste.<br /><br />I never IV but I if I did would never want to IV 100mg of that, it would fuck me up big time.<br /><br />To go back to the original point, I&#039;m quite impressed with Aussie gear, at least where I am. It&#039;s expensive as fuck but I&#039;ve found it on par with the likes of DubG.
