				Ahoy -<br />I&#039;ll be brief: What does 1mg of a powder look like? <br /><br />Yes it&#039;s a very bad idea to try to eyeball 1mg. But if you were going to do it . . . How would you ? <br /><br />Divide a relatively small amount of something into A THOUSAND PARTS. Go! <br /><br />Possible answer: divide it in half over and over again. <br /><br /><br />Alternate hypothetical situation: add X.X digital scale. So then you could measure 0.1g ...... Divide it into A HUNDRED PARTS GO. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok. So 1mg. Thats dumm. But I&#039;d eyeball an 8th of weed... Once you get down into mg.... How many mgs are reasonable to try to eyeball? <br /><br /><br /><br />PS It&#039;s really hard to write a forum posting and count out complex time signatures at the same time ... And thats why John Petrucci is so much better than me.

				It depends on how accurate you need your eyeballed dose to be.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done it several times for an allergy test.&nbsp; Also, it helps if you are good at eyeballing and you have seen that amount of powder before, since they have different densities.&nbsp; So - if you know what 5 mg of a specific powder looks like, it&#039;s easier to do than picking up an unknown powder of unknown density and trying to find 5 mg.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the 1 mg range, it isn&#039;t at all smart to eyeball if you can&#039;t handle getting, say, 5 mg instead of one.&nbsp; Which rules out pretty much everything you&#039;d want to eyeball 1 mg for except for allergy tests.

				What kind of ballpark amount are we talking about here though?

				Density is a huge factor. If you took 1 mg of one powder and put that much of another powder it could be 5 mgs. You should NEVER be eyeballing some with a &lt;100 mg dose. If you must dose it with volumetrics.

				Thank&#039;aya for giving me some kind of basic order of magnitude... I suppose its true that eyeballing &lt;100mg is a bad idea. I was really just wondering what dosages under that looked like, regardless of density. I mean obviously different XYZ has different density but .......Not *really* when you&#039;re talking about something that small, you know? It&#039;s not like 1mg of Powder X looks like a grain of sand and 1mg of Powder Y is as big as a Buick . . . . <br /><br /><br />That kinda leads me into an underlying question: is a 1mg dose even ... uh.... lacking a better word (fuckoff it&#039;s Super Bowl night, of COURSE I&#039;m drunk.....) ....

Even 100mg of Powder XYZ is a ridiculously small amount. <br /><br /><br /><br />So then how the fuck do people take things in doses of like .... idk, 5, 10 mg ?&nbsp; ? <br /><br /><br /><br />/// stares angrily at my X.XX digital scale (which I obviously don&#039;t own, cus that would be illegal or sumshit&nbsp; :o ), mumbling Hare Krishna about some jibbajabba or other /// <br /><br /><br /><br />/// gets angry at all other inanimate objects in the room ///<br /><br /><br />/// breaks keyboard in rage so I can no longer ty

				Ehh I may have been a bit unclear. Let me clarify. <br />1- &quot;Heroin:&quot; I call it her&#039;ron because I&#039;m ridiculous. Her&#039;ron her&#039;ron her&#039;ron! :D<br />2- Solubility: Obviously if you&#039;re looking to dissolve something, solubility is where you&#039;d start, but her&#039;ron won&#039;t dissolve in water unless you add heat. That&#039;s some other thing.. A thing we call &quot; ____ what ____&quot; ? <br />3- Volumetrics WAS a long time ago for me : ) ...As was all chemistry. I just meant I learned about it in college, which was a long time ago. And I gave up before I got into organic chemistry, so my knowledge is limited at best (could you tell? :) ) ... Pretty sure adding heat to dissolve heroin falls into the organic chemistry region since the molecule is all carbon rings but .. Again I have no idea what I&#039;m talking about, and it&#039;s compounded by having no idea what I&#039;m talking about in talking about what I have no idea what I&#039;m talking about ..... That was the longest sentence I&#039;ve ever typed&nbsp; :o<br />4- ROA : Oral bioavailability for her&#039;ron is somewhere around 33% if I remember correctly, with insufflation being around 55% (I&#039;d look up the exact number but LAAAAAAAZY); however, that wasn&#039;t what I was really wondering about. The bioavailability for other ROAs are all higher than oral, but oral supposedly lasts the longest? I&#039;ve heard that a few times from different people I&#039;ve talked to about this - if you weren&#039;t looking to get high but to actually use the heroin as a medication for treating pain, wouldn&#039;t oral be the best ROA? My logic is that the higher bioavailability is what gives the rush, and that the first pass metabolism takes a long time so you get the dose spread out over a long period of time. Am I way off?<br />5- Taking 1mg: of course it&#039;s possible in that it will work. I was thinking about the logistics. Again the big question here is that I have no clue what 1mg of anything looks like. If it is one grain of sand, that could just get stuck on your finger and dropped on the ground before you got it in your cheek or under your tongue or whatever.. Anyhow with drugs that you&#039;d be measuring in small amounts on that order of magnitude, you&#039;d be actually measuring closer to ~10-15mg. If you had an&nbsp; X.X scale you could measure out 0.1g and start dividing it in half. Really you&#039;d be alright dividing it only three times in that case: 100mg &gt; 50mg, 50mg &gt; 25mg, 25mg &gt; 12.5mg ... <br />^^ That sounds so logical to me that I have trouble seeing how it could be a bad idea (aside from &quot;doin drugs is dumm&quot;) <br /><br />Yet on some gut level it seems like it probably is ... but why?&nbsp; &nbsp;/// boggle ///

				I just use simple math to mesure out my dose (because I do not have a Mg scale).<br />100mg 2c-i mixed with 20 CCs of a 50/50 ethanol/water mixture will be 5mg per CC (or 5mg per Ml)<br />This can be extracted with a syringe or anything that measures Milliliters and dosed perfectly into a shot glass (at which point I mix it with tea).<br />

This way I can get a near perfect dose.<br />2c-i clumps up in (distilled) water, at least in my experience and dosent mix well.<br /><br />The only other thing that I would advise is if you do this my way, or are ever mixing a drug with a drink. Make sure not to use anything acidic or basic (like lemonade). as I fear that this may weaken or change the drug.<br />(you never know, it could affect it)

				@ ianfleming<br />1- Re: your name: I&#039;m sharp like that!;) <br /><br />2- Re: forming a suspension:&nbsp; Interesting. But how did you know adding ethanol would prevent that from happening? It seems like there&#039;d be more to it than simply looking up the solubility of 2c-i in ethanol, because if it were completely soluble in ethanol you would just use that ... Unless you are just adding water for palatability or something. <br /><br /><br /><br />@ 328502E<br />1- Re: YOUR name: Wh.... Explain?<br /><br />2- It isn&#039;t insoluble though, is it? Because you add heat to it and ... it dissolves. <br /><br />3- Compulsion makes me include this number too =P<br /><br />4- Two things- First, wow I thought rectal was just under injection. I had no idea it was so low on the scale. Second, interesting about smoking (throat) vs smoking (lungs) with IM in between. You&#039;re talking about the amount absorbed in the throat and the amount absorbed in the lungs, right? Or is there some way of smoking where it doesn&#039;t get into your lungs ..?<br /><br />5- Good point on the scale.. It&#039;s true your scale could be just plain wrong and it shows 0.1 when it is really 0.3, but it&#039;s also true that it could be totally correct and still show 0.1 for both 180mg and 105mg (if it doesn&#039;t round up). The reason I intentionally overlook these things is that the goal isn&#039;t actually 1mg. That is irresponsible, though, if you&#039;re talking about something the size of a grain of sand. <br /><br />And yeah you can insufflate 1mg, but you can technically insufflate 1 microgram or 1 nanogram of something too; it&#039;d just be really, really, really, REALLY impractical. Is it totally impractical to snort 1mg? I&#039;m just thinking of times where I&#039;ve had a quarter gram of cocaine or something split between a few people and it would be like maybe a line each, and a small one at that. But still a significant portion of the bag (e.g., not 1/250th...) <br /><br />I guess the point to take is that volumetrics is the only way to do this. <br /><br />And also, an X.X scale is fucking worthless, lol.... <br /><br /><br /><br />@ Angelology <br />I think you meant you can&#039;t tell the difference between 1mg and 4mg (if you can&#039;t tell the difference between a gram and 4 grams, I&#039;ve got a bridge to sell you . . . . ). That said... Yeah, point. But I was thinking I&#039;d be able to do it on a digital scale without much problem. However, the experiences I have looking at 0-100mgs of powder come from crushed up pills, and that isn&#039;t ever anywhere near accurate. The biggest offender I know of is Xanax... But they all do it, if I&#039;m not mistaken. <br /><br />Anyone know of any pills that are pretty accurate? Obviously they all have binders and stuff (Xanax is mostly chalk, from what I hear) but surely there&#039;s gotta be one out there that&#039;s pretty close?

				@ianfleming - Yes, you can produce ethanol in &gt; 98% purity.&nbsp; While it is difficult to go above 95.63% (this is the azeotrope for water-ethanol), there are drying agents that can be used to get a higher purity.&nbsp; It is generally expensive.<br /><br />@jp - <br />2 - It is insoluble at one temperature and soluble at another.&nbsp; If I recall my chemistry correctly, this is actually true for ALL substances.&nbsp; There is a temperature zone that stuff is soluble in, and if you go above OR below this zone it is insoluble.&nbsp; However, it is often the case that a liquid would turn into a gas or solid before you exited this zone.&nbsp; I can try and look up a name for this for you if you would like to further read into this topic.<br /><br />4 - When you smoke something, there are two ways it can enter your body.&nbsp; It can either be absorbed through your throat (I believe heroin is this way) or it be be absorbed through your lungs (weed).&nbsp; This is why you get a rush from crack and not something like weed (as dramatically).&nbsp; Crack is absorbed rapidly through your throat, while weed is absorbed slowly through the lungs.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite a large difference - I think throat is something like 15 seconds, and lungs is 5 minutes.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;m talking about the onset duration, NOT the bioavailability.&nbsp; <br /><br />5 - There is a difference between accuracy and precision.&nbsp; Scales are precise to their last sig fig, but not necessarily accurate.&nbsp; If you weigh two things, and one weights 5.4 grams and the other 5.8, it is reasonable to say that they weigh 0.4 grams different, but NOT that one weights 5.4 grams and the other 5.8 (one may weigh 5.2g and the other 5.6).<br /><br />The problem with dealing in such small doses of a powder is that there is a large loss whenever you attempt to move it.&nbsp; The surface area to mass ratio is high, so wind may blow it away, you may leave some in the baggy, etc.<br /><br />What do you mean pills that are accurate? Every pill to my knowledge is combined with a binder to hold it all together, else it crumbles extremely easily.&nbsp;
