				If you&#039;ve heard the slang coming out of california you&#039;d think they were talking about a new cannabis ointment, but &quot;dabbing&quot; which is freebasing Butane Honey Oil &quot;BHO&quot; is the result of an extraction process that gives you high concentrations of cannibinoids mixed with liquid butane. I have an extensive history with hashes and cannabis and was looking into what exactly dabbing was about, so i acquired some 90% BHO and took a dab, less than a drop, and spent the next 12 hours reeling. <br /><br />A joint will get you up and down in 2 hours tops, if you were to eat the cannabis in the joint you would have 4-6 hours of being high. If you ate the cannabis of 5 joints you would only get so high, your body would eventually tolerate the rest. This was wasn&#039;t a high, this was a tweak, let me stress, this was NOTHING LIKE CANNABIS OR HASH.&nbsp; If i had huffed a bag of solvents i might have been closer to what this felt like. Thats not to say i couldnt make the best of it, but feeling like you&#039;re going to go into cardiac arrest for 12 hours straight isnt what i was looking for. I&#039;ve upped a guide on concentrates for reference, there are other ways of achieving high purity oils/waxes that dont involve distilling them into carcinogenic solvents, if you arent interested in hard drugs then be sure to ask your vendor what process they used.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34578.0

What? You clearly had a cannabis overdose, and are not familiar with them. Your comment on edibles is also wrong. Try eating a massive amount of cannabis edibles, you will become intensely sick and have quite the trip off them. I have had 24 hour+ experiences off edibles that were stronger than psychedelic drugs.<br /><br />Also, occasional smokers really shouldn&#039;t go after powerful concentrates. They aren&#039;t made for people with your tolerance. <br /><br />It also sounds like whatever STRAIN your oil was made from too was powerful as well. Strain is extremely important in determining effects.<br /><br />Also, BHO is only one type of oil. I find Iso or Acetone oils to be great quality without risking contaminants.

				ha ha, sounds like someone had a way-too-high freakout moment.<br /><br />unless you bought the oil from a complete dipshit, all the butane gets purged from the final product.&nbsp; you just got really fricken high and panicked, is my guess.

				Sounds like the oil did its job fine. Even if there was some residual butane left, which is not uncommon, 99.9% of it will either evaporate into the atmosphere or enter your lungs only to exit intact. Even if they used impure commercial butane, those impurities would likely harm you in the long run without actually inducing any immediate effects unless you&#039;re allergic to something. The whole cardiac arrest thing reminds me of the heart/head pounding highs you get when you smoke a lot of oil. Sativa-based BHO can feel really clear and speedy, confusing anyone not used to the effects.<br /><br />If you weren&#039;t just really high, it&#039;s possible that it could be very poorly made, fake, or contaminated product as well. Pics?

				I gotta say this sounds a lot like my first couple of experiences with MJ. I don&#039;t know what kind it was except I was assured it was &quot;good shit&quot;. A few too many hits and I felt my heart pounding out of my chest for a long time. Same thing happened on my first bong rip. It felt like a full blown panic attack for a while before I started feeling like I was in the past and future at the same time. <br /><br />12 hours seems like a hella long time though.

				What kind of weed are you guys getting that does that stuff to you ? <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to claim anything I&#039;ve ever smoked was all that (generic street weed), but I&#039;ve been blasted enough on it to sit for hours and seriously appreciate the carpet, and never had those kinda chest-bursty feelings. Only times I&#039;ve had anything similar involved gratuitous stimulants or using my water-cooler bong that makes you toke so hard you hyperventilate.

				My weed experience isn&#039;t very extensive--gotten most of my stuff from 2 or 3 dealers probably all getting shit from similar batches. But those experiences were limited to my early endeavors. Maybe part of it was initial anxiety plus the effects of the weed but I haven&#039;t had that too much lately. My heart will still speed up noticeably just about every time for a bit.

				Terrible thread title...And also completely false..BHO is actually a healthier and tastier vapor and does not contain all the bad things u get from combustion.<br />Normal Bud has a THC content of around 8%-28%..now concentrates have a THC content of 30%-80+%..for a beginner yes this will destroy you for about 5 hrs..but how big was your dab?? i mean u barley need any to get high..as in i can make a half gram last a month whilst taking 2-3 dabs daily,luckily in my state we are behind this whole movement and have all sorts of new bong technology different methods of making the &quot;wax&quot; or &quot;budder&quot;<br />All the clinics in my area offer a wide arrange of concentrates,just do some more research and choose the concentrate for u whether it be a sativa or indica

				I agree with most people here that you underestimated what you were getting yourself into. What you describe is exactly how I felt after a night of enormous bong rips of my first real dank. Back in my youngin years, all us stupid high school kids could get was either seedy brick swag, or some kids older brothers secret outdoor grow. When i got my first bag of sticky nugs I was so in love with the taste and smell i packed a huge bowl and milked it to solid white smoke, pulled the carb and proceeded to cough till my eyes watered and then, around the time my throat started feeling better, I got waaay higher than i had ever been, or ever prepared for. This one episode set off a chain of panic attacks, racing pounding heart, perceived chest pain , numbness in extremities....i got the fear, pretty bad. I know its pretty much impossible to be stoned for more than 12 hours from smoking,and it could just be the fact that it just felt like forever before I felt normal again......unfortunately the panic stayed with me on and off for months.....something would trigger it and i would find myself in a state of depersonalization.....start to panic and boom right back to how i felt that night.<br /><br />Having since conquered my panic attacks, and returned to smoking the ganj......ive tried BHO many many times and ive always enjoyed it...i used to paint a tiny bit on my lucky cig and get blazed on my lunch break....id say the chances of butane sticking around and being consumed by you is fairly low, its very volatile and boils off to a gas at low temp. and even if there was some residual, i doubt it would have more of an effect that the amount you inhale trying to hit a bowl and losing the flame. i could be wrong about that last bit. actually i could be wrong about everything, just saying, BHO made from top notch bud has taken me on some pretty colorful almost shroom-like trips...obviously not the same, but def an entirely different beast than couchlocked eating cheetos.<br /><br />but yeah, what you described sounds exactly like a panic attack brought on by The sudden 0 to fucking so fucked up moment you realize something is wrong is all it takes for natural fight or flight to kick in, compounding the already increased heart bpm. Best of luck tho, that one panic episode ruined smoking weed for me for almost 3 years....now i have a lot more respect for it, and more experience with the various plateaus (not as clearly defined as say DXM but i feel like they exist) of good weed.

I was smoking all natural sticky dank that I was not at all ready for. I&#039;d say residual depersonalization disorder that manifests out of the blue for 4-6 months after the fact is a pretty longterm presence....People like to believe that pot is a harmless drug, but you can certainly throw your head all outta wack by not respecting and taking it seriously, even for some who do....sometimes the ganj smokes you! I can&#039;t sit here and tell you what you did and didn&#039;t do obviously, but I highly highly doubt it had anything to do with butane. As soon as you hit that oil with a flame, any butane that may still be trapped in the oil would instantly become water vapor, CO2 and CO and a tiny amount of unburned butane....I&#039;ve seen people huff towels soaked in that crap....the miniscule amount you would&#039;ve been exposed to would be highly unlikely to cause the episode you described. Are you sure it was BHO? ive heard of people using methanol before and I know that can make you feel pretty shitty even in small amounts... I&#039;m not trying to be a dick at all man, but a lot of people can&#039;t fathom weed or in this case an incredibly concentrated suspension of the main psychoactive component of the drug as having the power really fuck up your mental wellbeing....it can and will if you aren&#039;t properly prepared....Everyone learns their lesson, respect.

In this case, its less an oil and more a wax at room temp.<br /><br />That&#039;s the beauty of errl, its pure! Places like AZ Med Testing (*clearnet* http://azmedtest.com) specialize in testing for impurities. They have scientific ass nerdy stoners who run big gas chromatagraph, and mass spectrometer to analyze every last molecule.<br /><br />If you&#039;re getting poor quality BHO, it very well could be contaminated, made with cheap butane, cut with human ear wax, etc. However, its false to say that all BHO is like sucking on your torch. Bringing me back to where I started, BHO when properly made is insanely pure.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34668.msg398595#msg398595">Quote from: Joey Terrifying on August 09, 2012, 05:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">where the fuck did the term &quot;errl&quot; come from?&nbsp; i don&#039;t get it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />errl is slang for oil.

				Inhaling butane gas causes you to lose consciousness in an interesting way for a very short time. I don&#039;t know if you ever did that thing when you were kids where you hold your breath and people press on your chest till you pass out?(ah the things we used to do before we could get proper drugs) It&#039;s kind of like that. Doesnt last 12 hrs.

				Maybe you are just really sensitive to butane then. I&#039;ve seen some pretty dedicated solvent huffers bury their nose in towels of butane before I have not actually huffed it, but i have inhaled plenty while trying to burn off hard to reach resin in my bowl by pulling as hard as i can while torching the empty bowl...occasionally the flame goes out and i get a big ol butane hit, never noticed any effects tbh......obviously I&#039;m not saying &quot;its harmless I watched those huffer retards breathe it like it was air!&quot;<br />It was both sad, impressive, and a learning experience.....I learned that I never wanted to huff anything. I mean they would huff any of those organic solvents you&#039;d find in a hardware store....I never witnessed it, but they would steal freon somehow from peoples AC units.. 2 of the brothers got caught doing it when then left empty cans of glade laying in the yard covered with their prints...Basically instead of having a town drunk, we had 3 brain dead huffers. No offense to anyone who enjoys huffing, all three of these guys were obviously mentally imparied somehow, my natural assumption was because of solvents but, i dont really know...I still think that your symptoms were probably caused by a massive amount of thc, maybe the butane vapor potentiated the experience somehow..I&#039;m no expert, I&#039;m not you, I can only try to connect the dots..The only solvent exposure i can relate too would be spraying a coat nitrocellulose lacquer thinner, and I got the fast heartbeat dizzy feeling for about an hour or so, and that was after spending about 5 minutes trying to fix a botched paint job in a hurry and misplacing my respirator.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t the smartest of moves but i really didn&#039;t feel like opening my halfassed homemade paint booth and getting dust or bugs on the paint job I just spent hours fixing. So thanks for the warning. I will avoid super THC BHO freebase concentrate......Id much rather smoke buds these days anyways, maybe the occasional edible treat.
