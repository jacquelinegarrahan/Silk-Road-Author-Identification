				&nbsp;motek&#039;s been lucky enough to have had some beautifully &#039;clean&#039; mdma recently ...... and after reading reports from all over the interwebz the decision was made :o <br />motek was Alone and at home...&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Unfortunately scales weren&#039;t handy, but it was known the total amount &#039;there&#039; was 300mgs .... and so eyeballing and using a&nbsp; piece of plastic as a spatula, took what seemed to be about the equivalent of&nbsp; 15grains of sugar, as it was xtstals and I only took the tiny ones, .... what I&#039;m saying is that it was a very small amount .... I&#039;m guessing at the most it was 40-50mgs, in about 0.7ml water <br /><br />well .....&nbsp; pushed it in over 15-20 seconds .... nothing happened .... for about another 15-20 seconds and then&nbsp; KAPOWIE BOOOM!&nbsp; I felt like I had been strapped to a rocket and wow!&nbsp; <br />I half freaked that I might have had a &#039;little too much&#039; as I was getting pretty hot, fast, so I stripped off, and felt much&nbsp; better, then while still rushing, I rapidly &#039;cleaned up&#039; and then had a&nbsp; (warm) shower for maybe 5 mins which was perfect, as it felt so nice! After that I was good. Just smashed :o<br /><br />&nbsp;I had mad eye wiggles from hell, BUT no teeth/mouth grinding AT all,&nbsp; but I couldn&#039;t read/focus and my sense of balance was like I was half pissed ... but as long as I was thoughtful of it all was fine! <br /><br />I smoked some nice weed an hour or two into the roll, and that was just what the Dr ordered&nbsp; 8) <br />I felt comfortably smashed and very relaxed . I was way too smashed in the first 2 hours to hold a sensible conversation, but after the smoke, I got a few unexpected and &#039;stra<br />ight&#039; ph calls, and found it easy to be nice and cruised through them... ;D<br /><br />It took about 6 hours to get back to baseline&nbsp; ... which surprised me, I thought it would&#039;ve worn off sooner, but it didn&#039;t .... rolling hard for at least 3 of them before it became manageable<br /><br />I was also hungry so I ate a few sandwiches and some fruit, which went down&nbsp; a treat ;D<br /><br />Slept like a baby ... feeling great today ...freah and clear headed!&nbsp; <br /><br />Just please BE CAREFUL WITH THE DOSE .... 30 milli gms of good quality dutch crystals IV&#039;d&nbsp; will take you to the moon&nbsp; :o 8)<br />be prepared to sit back and go WOW&nbsp; :o :o&nbsp; <br /><br />And definitely start small&nbsp; and weigh it ( ::)yeaah I know :-[) ...it would be a fucked way to go by&nbsp; overheating from a mdma dose ... or having a heart attack! REMEMBER mdma IS AN AMPHETAMINE!&nbsp; so bee BLOODY CAREFUL, and you&#039;ll have a ball, it this&#039;s your thing<br /><br />Stay safe to enjoy more things at later times ;)

				damn, it takes a lot to get my demons up and rattling their chains, but this post has me wanting to bang some drugs again, damn. i love mdma, and i can literally imagine how nice that would be. What is your body weight motek? And i agree it would be awful to od and die by molly lethal dose, the overheating and brain bake would be terrible. Thanks for getting my addiction up and raging!! JK lol, seriously i am jonesin now, lol, but it will subside. Stay safe, Love and Light

				I slammed about 70ish mg the first time taking molly ever. It was a slightly yellowish powder but dissolved pretty well. And holy fuck is right it hits you pretty hard and you end up getting almost naked from the heat! One thing I did notice though was that it leaves a horrible taste in the mouth (idk how) and when i pissed the next day or 2 it burned like hell.
