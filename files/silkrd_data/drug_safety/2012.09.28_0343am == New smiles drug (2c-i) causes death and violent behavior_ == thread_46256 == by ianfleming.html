				I dunno why people are bothered, it&#039;s just the same rinse and repeat shit. It sounds harsh but these articles are all the same and I actually just can&#039;t really be bothered to hear about someone else fucking up on drugs, it&#039;s depressing and it&#039;s just not what I want the media to subject me to. It&#039;s also pretty fucking crass to use someone&#039;s dead kid as a plinth for their rinse and repeat sounding board. <br /><br />&quot;WE HAVE A DEAD KID! WE HAVE A DEAD KID FROM AN OD! LET&#039;S WRITE WHAT WE THINK WE SHOULD SAY! COME ON! TIME TO WRITE THE ESTABLISHED TRUTH! DEAD KID, FRESH DEAD KID HERE GET YOUR PLINTH WHILE IT&#039;S HOT&quot;<br /><br />What annoys me as well is that we, or more accurately you (because as I said above I don&#039;t feel the need to care about a kid I never met) just react in the same way by complaining about the bias or the way it&#039;s written. Aren&#039;t you guys bored of giving a shit over and over again and saying the same thing time and again? <br /><br />My answer? Stop giving a fuck.

				Have to agree with limitless - this is the same rah rah rah... its not even anti drug media that the problem, its just sensationalist entertainment for the masses. Anything extraordinary is considered news, like a drug fueled zombie attack or a dude flipping out on drugs.<br /><br />The fact that this story made the news actually proves how fucking rare the event actually is. All the shit that happens every day, (cancer, car crashes, alcohol poisoning) doesn&#039;t even get considered for publishing.<br /><br />Don&#039;t read the news, it&#039;ll only make you depressed or angry. Instead give and take more &#039;smiles&#039; and check out the amazingness that is nature, or your hands, fucking anything and everything, you guys know what i mean :)

				Exactly and the only reason people react on here is because they feel as if they have to take a moral stance on it. Why? Some kid that you don&#039;t and have never known O.Ded and died. Happens every day. What made this kid special? Nothing.

				One of the latest Anderson Cooper Show episode, had a long segment on &quot;smiles&quot;. Were the father of some kid that died from &quot;supposedly&quot; taking 2c-i and Anderson (and his audience) verbally abused and talked over some dude that tried to make some valid points.<br /><br />Fucking nimwits<br /><br />Also, how can you know that your son died from 2c-i. I mean it&#039;s not like it shows up in tox screens or can be tested for.

				I have heard this too, however it dosent matter because the heat is still on 2c-i.<br />Again, how can you know, there is no test.<br /><br />Though one report came from some guy who said he put the smiles in a chocolate bar and ate it. NBOMe isnt orally active.<br /><br />Also, I love how they keep sayings it&#039;s a new. even though 2c-i has been around nearly 30 years.

				It&#039;s the same kind of sloppy sensationalist journalism that got mephedrone banned over here.<br />Two guys had a drug and booze binge and their deaths were blamed on mephedrone, it was only after they&#039;d banned it that it turned out the guys had taken methadone and not mephedrone.
