				I occasionally use adderall and speed and find the focus and mental clarity that they provide to be particularly useful. I&#039;m curious to know of other SR user&#039;s experiences with alternatives as well as any descriptions or suggestions that they would like to volunteer.

				Don&#039;t get me started... the hours I&#039;ve wasted on here rambling about this are outright shameful.<br /><br />Long story short: nothing works as well as adderall for me.&nbsp; Combining them tends to ruin their effects, generally.&nbsp; Really good clean meth will work almost as well as adderall, but just never hits the same level as the clean pharmaceutical stuff.<br /><br />Just my two cents.&nbsp; 2-FMA was a big disappointment, after I read one or two people say they replaced their adderall with it.&nbsp; 4-MMC (mephedrone) I guess could work for studying, but I don&#039;t care for it, personally.&nbsp; Cathinones also aren&#039;t known for their studying enhancing properties, to my knowledge, but your mileage may vary.&nbsp; That&#039;s about all I have to say as far as the hard facts go.

				Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine). Even better than Adderall! And generally cheaper to have prescribed. If you have an Adderall prescription and want to switch, just complain of jittery feelings and say that you read on the internet that Dexedrine has less body stimulation (which is the case).

				I know of at least one person who says adderall is far superior for their motivation.&nbsp; They switched from dexedrine.<br /><br />As for me?&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember there being much of a noticeable difference... but my dex hookup bailed on me like 2 years ago, so I can&#039;t really say for sure if I agree with that or not.

				Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is great if I&#039;m trying to get lots of productivity out of day&#039;s work.&nbsp; If I need to go long hours, like an all nighter, I use amphetamine or 3-FA.

				Were they perfect circles, or were they ovals?&nbsp; If they were circles, it was probably Corepharma (manufacturer).&nbsp; Look it up online: a lot of people say the same thing.<br /><br />The ovals are from Barr labs.&nbsp; People don&#039;t seem to have the same trouble with them.&nbsp; Personally I never saw much of a difference, but there was some.&nbsp; I never could have told them apart blindfolded or anything though.

I was on XR (brand name). Later on I got the shield shaped blue IRs but only for a month. But I&#039;ve had the orange ovals and a whole bunch of other types of Adderall, and they&#039;re all pretty similar to me. But I wouldn&#039;t doubt that some manufacturers would have poorer quality l-amph in there.
