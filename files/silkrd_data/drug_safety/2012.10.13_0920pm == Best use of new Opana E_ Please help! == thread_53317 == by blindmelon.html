				I&#039;ve got some of the new Opana ER &#039;plastic&#039; pills for the first time, not having any luck searching for a way to get the best use of them. I am interested in any ways of breaking them down to snort or at least dissolve fully for oral(or plug) use(I would prefer not to IV, but if there is a method of doing this that is relatively safe I am interested as well). I usually get Oxycontin OP which I slice very thin w/exacto knife &amp; dissolve under my tounge or swallow in order to get a better effect. My dosage level on the OP is about 40mg to feel decent. Would appreciate any advise/experience with this as these little plastic turds have me stymied at the moment. Thank you all, it&#039;s so nice to have the SR community &amp; I appreciate you all.

				at least with the OPs just dissolve the chunks in an acidic beverage for a few hours to release the oxycodone. i assume it works with opana too, but havent tried myself<br /><br />make sure you start with tiny doses, some even find a few mg of oxymorphone too much with a low tolerance<br /><br />also just so you are aware, oxymorphone has horrid oral bio-availability - about ten percent if i remember correctly - so dont think because you can take a whole pill orally that you should even snort a 1/4 of the pill. more like an 1/8 to 1/16th to start and work up<br /><br />there is a drug interaction between alcohol and OM that can easily result in a FATAL overdose as well, so please be careful - never drink on OM because some people absorb much more than usual, and some others absorb even less... no way to know how it will effect you<br /><br />i dont know if this works, but a different method was suggested by another member:<br />this is a quote from DrDeepWood from: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=48691.0<br /><br />&quot;Grind down with dremel tool.&nbsp; Boil powder in pure methanol for 15 mins (HEET fuel line dryer from walmart), maybe 10ml per pill.&nbsp; Put a teaspoon of sugar on a plate, pour 5ml on the sugar, microwave until evaporated and repeat until all fluid is gone,&nbsp; scrape and chop up the sugar.&nbsp; The ER is fucked at this point without destroying the good stuff.&nbsp; you can even snort! works on new opanas etc also!&quot;
