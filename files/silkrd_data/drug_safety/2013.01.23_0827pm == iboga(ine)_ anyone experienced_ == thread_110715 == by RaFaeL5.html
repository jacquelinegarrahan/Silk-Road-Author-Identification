				Hey, <br />I&#039;m quite intersted in this plant and the derivated product, <br />but can&#039;t find enough decent info on it. <br /><br />There&#039;s a vendor on SR offering it and he does give some info on how to use it.<br />But I&#039;d like to know more before deciding anything.<br /><br />I also searched this forum for iboga and ibogaine, but no text was found where the quantities, methods of use, ... were described. <br />What I did find on the forum is that the drugs is not without dangers - one more reason to try to get good, solid information before considering. <br />So I hope there are some people here who do have the experience and are willing to share it. <br />The &quot;tripping into your past&quot; effect of it seems very intersting...!<br />

				Not sure if it helps much but here is a Tihkal article about it:<br /><br />(Clearnet) http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal25.shtml<br /><br />Can get a little more info on Erowid, a few FAQ&#039;s and stuff. Here&#039;s some experience reports that might help with dosing:<br /><br />(Clearnet) http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Ibogaine.shtml<br /><br />In general this really isn&#039;t a recreational drug. The people most likely to use it are those seeing it for it&#039;s potential therapeutic properties in countering withdrawal from other substances. The trip is in general described to be fairly unpleasant but obviously a trip can be different for everyone. <br /><br />If you want to give it a go I would probably suggest you knock all the fun psychedelics off the list first since it might turn you off the idea for a while. People seem to have much more fun on LSD, Shrooms, DMT, 2Cx than this stuff but if you&#039;ve been through all those and want something new I guess it could be interesting.

				Well cool, have some fun with it if you try it and send up a trip report. It sounds like you need to take a pretty good dose (1000mg +) for the visual side to come out. Might not be a horrible idea to have a trip sitter unless you start small and feel your way around it. Only reason I knew anything about it was that they lock people in tiny rooms and give them big doses of this to help them get over drug addiction. As you mentioned it provides a different level of introspection that most other drugs out there even if the trip to that place is somewhat unpleasant.

				no firsthand experience with it.. but all i can say is that it can last for a looong time, it will completely rewire your brain and a sitter is a must because you will turn into a zombie for a few days and someone needs to help you drink and pee.....<br />Its not good for &quot;getting fucked up&quot;, its not a drug you take for visuals or euphoria. <br />But it can help you if you have serious addictions like opiate addiction. Completely clears you out. <br />I read reports about ppl who had to learn to talk and walk again after a high dose ibogaine experience... <br />

				I&#039;ve heard of it only as a substance to help cure other addictions such as smoking, drinking and even opiates.<br /><br />All of this is obviously experimental at best, but using it recreationally is rarely reported. <br /><br />I have no first hand experience with ibogaine, but by the look of things i do not to.

				so,<br /><br />&quot;Yeshua&quot; is the only vendor on SR distributing iboga(ine). <br /><br />What he writes about it is: <br /><br />&quot;Instructions:<br />Leave in your mouth and absorb all the bitter for at least 10 minutes before ingesting.<br />Please be aware that a dose of Iboga this size is not intended to interrupt an addiction to opiates or other drugs. It is possible to use the root bark (rather than an extract) for this purpose, but it would require at least 10 grams (in MOST cases it would be more than that, depending on body weight/intensity of habit) and would result in tons of vomiting and a much harsher experience than the extracts would..<br /><br /><br />Effects:<br />Eating just one gram of this root bark will induce a psychedelic/dissociative state that lasts about 6 to 8 hours.<br />Not to worry though, in small amounts like this it is a very pleasant experience.<br /><br />This is a rare entheogenic compound (also referred to as an &quot;oneirogen&quot; because of the dreamlike state it creates) that is sourced directly from Africa, but I happen to have a decent quantity of the stuff and think every psychonaut should give it a try.<br /><br />It has very unique visuals, with iridescent lines vibrating off of moving objects after the peak has ended (there are distinct stages with this drug, and although it will be less noticeable at this amount it is still very much there.)<br /><br />Low doses: leads to light flashes, sensory enhancement and motorial difficulties.<br />Medium doses: leads to light flashes, sensory enhancement, motorial difficulties and insight into personal events from the past.<br />High doses: leads to light flashes, sensory enhancement, motorial difficulties, insight into personal events from the past and encounters with archetypal stuctures deeper in the stream of consciousness. This trip can last up to 24 hours!<br /><br />In the Bwiti cult the drug is taken in 2 ways: regularly in small doses before and in the early part of their ceremonies, followed after midnight by a smaller dose; and once or twice during the initiation to the cult in excessive doses of 5 to 15 basketfulls over an 8 to 24 hour period. This to “break open the head”, thus inducing contact with the ancestors through collapse and hallucination.<br /><br />Warning<br />The first time take a small dosage (0.5 - 1 gram) to test your sensitivity to iboga. An iboga trip can be intense and people can react differently to it.<br />Make sure a sober, preferably experienced sitter is standby to avoid any accidents.<br />Do not use when: pregnant, depressed, on medication, driving motorised vehicles, under 18 years old, in combination with other stimulants or alcohol.&quot;<br /><br />I just invited him to participate in this forum page. I hope he&#039;ll join in to tell us more, or maybe he could ask some of his buyers to post their experiences on this page...

				Yes I&#039;ve done it before to stop the withdrawals from Suboxone. I took a pretty big dose (about 950mg of HCL) and while it definitely helped reduce the withdwals, it did not completely eliminate them. Also, ibogaine causes terrible insomnia and for weeks and weeks, I remmeber popping 5 mg of xanax and even a couple valiums 8 days later and still having trouble falling asleep...<br />Oh and the trip is not enjoyable. No euphoria, you just get really really dizzy like the world keeps turning and you get some cool visuals altho I wud say the visuals are more of a hallucionation (like a deleriant) than like visuals from a psychedelic.<br />This is what I experienced, but I suppose not everyone has the same reaction to psychedelics

				I actually traveled to Mexico to get a legal dose of therapeutic Ibogaine HCL and also the alkaloid extract. This is NOT a drug to do recreationaly. The high lasts about 2 days and you wont be able to get good sleep for at least 1-3 days, but on the other side it does clean out your body of opiate addiction and almost rids you of withdrawl symptoms. <br /><br />The way I was administered it was by taking about a 200mg hcl dose to make sure I didn&#039;t have an adverse reaction to it. Felt almost nothing from that. They then gave me a flood dose of the HCL of about 750mg. After about 2 hours I had very noticeable &#039;tracers&#039; from lights in the room, and I started to feel very introspective. With my eyes closed when the high hit, my past literally flashed before my eyes, yet it is a very controlled experience. It was weird how I wasn&#039;t thinking about going into my past before I took the drug, yet as the visuals started coming it was almost impossible not to catch a glimpse of a past memory, especially very emotionally charged memories and drug usage memories. <br /><br />It really gave me an outside perspective on how I handled myself as a person and how my actions and behaviors influenced my decisions, especially about using hard drugs. It&#039;s weird because everyone who takes it experiences nearly the same sort of thing where they go through a 2 hr &#039;viewing&#039; of things, then about a 10-15 hr &#039;intropsection&#039; stage. During this stage, you do have a small amount of visuals that are left over, and you&#039;re brain feels like its running at the speed of light through thoughts, memories, everything. It is by far a very interesting thing that this drug does. <br /><br />However, beware that for at least 12 hours of taking a flood dose, you WILL NOT be able to stand up on your own. It literally makes the room spin like crazy if you try and get up. If someone isn&#039;t there to coach you, 95% of you will throw up instantly. They actually had us not eat or drink 12 hrs before hand to minimize the amount of times we&#039;d get up. After the introspection stage it just basically felt like my ears were ringing and my brain was fried from so much thinking and not being able to sleep for at least a day. Being bedridden for that long and not sleeping is exhausting, as Ibogaine makes you think so damn much.<br /><br />There is another form of the drug called the alkali extract that contains other similar drug components directly extracted from the Iboga root itself. This seems to produce or more visual experience at a lower dose (500mg) without the extenuous mind exhaustion and sleep deprivation. To benefit fully from this drug, I would recommend taking a flood dose, and using it to aid yourself in beating a current addiction to opiates. <br /><br />If you are going to get it anyways for recreational use and choose to ignore my personal advice, get the alkaloid extract and not the HCl. I was told by the guy who ran the clinic I went to that it creates a more visually pleasing experience with less of the harsh side effects of taking an HCl dose. As far as dosage, I am not 100% certain of the exact mg I was given except for the flood dose (which was around 1g of the HCl), but they did give me a booster dose a week later of the total alkaloid which was 2 or 3 capsules that were about 250mg caps. That created a manageable buzz of visuals and head games that lasted about 6 hours. The tracers actually lasted about 2 days after that which was a neat effect, especially at night.<br /><br />Hope that gives a bit more insight to this little known but much sought after drug that is primarily used for an alternative opiate/heroin addiction treatment. And it actually does work!! You just have to want to stop living that life if you expect it to give you any sort of clean time. You have to do the work after the Iboga plant does its job and rids your body of that horrible withdrawl.<br /><br />

				@ WolfmanJack87: thank you very much for your answer! +1 karma! at least someone who has actually taken ibogaïne was willing to share his experience here... in the meanwhile I met, by total coincidence, a nice guy who has taken iboga many times himself and who has been giving it to friends of his for various reasons (stopping opiate is one of those reasons, but not the only one). <br />He said to me: &quot;Iboga is something, when you start speaking about it, it mean you&#039;re ready for it&quot;. He could only praise the effect on your life and soul. <br />He only uses the real root, thinking that it&#039;s better to feel the plant, the taste of it, the structure and smell - he says this is also a part of the experience...<br />Maybe in a few months I&#039;ll get the chance to go to his house and have a session of iboga with him... time will tell... <br /><br />But, what&#039;s for sure, is that his enthusiasm has strengthen my desire to look deeper into this plant and the effects it has on people. As I &#039;ve used many products in a shamanistic way it feels like iboga is gone be one of the next (and last) products to be tried... <br />According to my &quot;newly met friend&quot; iboga is a real &quot;rite of passage&quot;. Before you were a boy, after you&#039;re a man - with all the responsabilities that comes with it, but also with the understanding of who you are and why you&#039;re here...

				Iboga is legal in many a country and you can source it easily on clear net.<br />Ibogaworld.com is just one of them. But Michelle there is immensely helpful.<br />If you are going for dealing with dependency then HCL is, apparently, the way to go.<br />I was planning to go for an introspective one with several of my friends and we have opted for TA - Total Alkaloid extract. When I arrived they were 3 hours in and if was horrific and heroic - I bailed. When they came to their senses and told me their stories I was glad I did big follow them. They took 1.5g of TA each.<br />From sources on the net I found eboka.info by far the most comprehensive.<br />Best of luck. Do not take it lightly.<br />Having couple of close friends with experience of it I will stay away.

				You don&#039;t want to mess with it if you don&#039;t know what you are doing and have someone with you to make sure you stay safe. It can be dangerous so stay safe when using it. <br /><br />Like I said I am more optimistic about this drug after meeting people who used it and say it helped. <br /><br />It&#039;s too bad that it isn&#039;t likely that any research will be done in the US. Seems there is no way to patent the drug thus no money to be made to research it.<br /><br />As promising as it is it should be viewed as a last resort option. <br /><br />As always stay safe.
