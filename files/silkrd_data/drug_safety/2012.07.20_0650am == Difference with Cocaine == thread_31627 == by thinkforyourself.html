				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;ve never taken cocaine, but I decided now it&#039;s time to try it. I was all set with ordering the cocaine sesampino offers. They took the listing down for a while because of restocking and now the listing are back up but also feature a &#039;fishscale&#039; cocaine. Now I&#039;m not really sure which one I should order. Can you help me explain the difference?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hello -- If you are about to spend some money on some blow consult and lurk this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.0<br /><br />It is under the Rumor Mill sub-forum and is constantly updated with all the &#039;heads review of products being listed. Coke is probably the most disproportionate cost:effect drug on the Road and is cut and stomped many times while in transit from growers to consumers. It can be cut with all sorts of &#039;caines and foreign agents that might develop an undesirable side effect. It would be the smartest option for you to lurk that review thread and apply due diligence before making your purchase. <br /><br />If you are gonna get some shit -- Might as well be the fire. <br /><br />Good hunting!

				Now is actually a bad time to get into cocaine, Over the past 5 to 10 years Cocaine in this country has completely gone to s***, Most of the Supposedd fish scale is Littered with research compounds that are close in nature to cocaine but are not cocaine. For example benzocaine lydocaine novacaine, many different caines and most people in the country are stupid and can&#039;t tell the difference . if bought many batches of fishscale from all over the country. its severed adulturated, mostly with endocrine because it sorta gets you high, has the numbing aspects and will oil up or &quot;come back&quot; When the crack dealers cook there product, so they either don&#039;t know or cut it up more with benzocaine, in the eu they call it back. it fills the lungs with liquid like mucus and causes heart problems. it can be removed but it takes crystallization or utilizing weights of defenses in water to get partial seperation. the point of the matter is that even the best cocaine in the country will probably lie somewhere around 40%&nbsp; COCAINE hcl at the most, with different caines to mix in. I&#039;m gonna get good cocaine soon when I take my lab equipment to Brazil and clean up the local product. its prohibition man, it causes the quality to deteriorate straight from the source, don&#039;t think the cartels wouldn&#039;t rather synth some rc compounds that mimics the old natural product if it could save millions in overhead. <br /><br />here&#039;s a fast clean up for the average person. go get acetone from hardware store, buy Epsom salt. throw Epsom salt in oven and cook all the water I<br />out of it, until its a chalky block..now toss into acetone until bubbles stop appearing which is oxygen being releases as the salts gather up the water.<br /><br />now throw product into shot glass and toss in acetone, let<br />

				Sry I&#039;m on a smart phone..I know I know, shifty formatting and bad sleeping....<br /><br />let crystals rest at bottom and dump acetone, do this like 3~5 times, you should have always all shard crystals now...now you waste 10,000 and more. like me trying to figure out how to delegate&nbsp; benzocaine and others from the cocaine crystals. they look the same in hcl formation, slightly different weights and color in water as a freebases though .also, benzocaine and cocaine recrystalizze different out of alcohol,&nbsp; cocaine in monolithic plating while benzocaine as needles, and in defenses form, cocaine hcl will stick together in a glob, while benzocaine will make many globs that won&#039;t easily collapse into each other. also benzocaine as an oil is darker with a grey tint and heavier than cocaine and will sit towards the bottom. of the water as a freebase. <br /><br />sorry for mistakes and bad formatting I&#039;m on a phone.<br />it would be cheaper to buy a plane ticket to south America if you want good product then to search for it here in the states.

In my opinion though I would try some good shit you can find on the streets first. Just because I&#039;ve broken out some good shit with people who&#039;ve never done it and had bad results. This guy threw up all over this girl at a party cause the drip hit him too hard. But after your first experiment and tolerance build up go for the gold. ;D<br /><br />P.s. body weight and age also have to do with how much you need so tread lightly. ;D

First time I ever tried it was in the 90&#039;s, I lived in a large port city - the product probably wasn&#039;t pure but it was extremely potent. So euphoric, long lasting too. What dealers sell these days as cocaine doesn&#039;t even feel anywhere near like how it should. I rarely do it anymore these days, it&#039;s such a waste of money.<br />

				Thanks everybody for the helpful posts.<br /><br />I read about all these quality problems with the coke, this is really sad... But what I&#039;ve read from ses&#039; reviews it looks like his gear is good quality, so I will give it a try. I was never able to get some coke locally, that&#039;s why this is no option and I&#039;m so eager to try it ;)<br /><br />How much should I start to snort?<br /><br />
