				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve recently bought a few grams of MDMA from a dutch seller in SR (says made from PMK oil which is supposed to be good shit?) and it came crushed and powdery. Test came out OK and it smelled like the goods. <br /><br />The thing that worries me is if it might have been cut? its pretty much crushed to powder form so really no crystals or rocks that i can see.<br /><br />Colour is tan/whitish. <br /><br />I understand that it might have been crushed for postage but other dealers have always maintained at least small rocks or crystals in theirs so its dissappointing to see this in powdery state.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tested a bit on it and it feels like MDMA, Good comedown too but just didnt roll hard like the other 84% products.<br /><br />How do i know guys?<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

				I think there&#039;s only two real options.&nbsp; There&#039;s a GCMS lab test, which for most people is costly or inaccessible.&nbsp; Or there&#039;s an acetone wash, which should get much of the impurities out.&nbsp; If you weigh it before and after the wash you can get a good idea of how cut it was.&nbsp; There&#039;s tutorials all over the forums, and on the clearweb.&nbsp;

				sorry mate but without sending it to a lab there is no way to verify it. and i&#039;d bet good money most, if not all the top 1% vendors who state 84% pure or whatever have just pulled that number out of thin air

				Ordered from FM ?<br /><br />It is not MDMA, I got it too. That price sounded waaay too good to be true.<br /><br />Someone on the forum linked it to be tfMPPP or something like that using a color test.<br /><br />My guess is that&#039;s a savvy mix of RC such as tfmppp, methylone, etc.. to make it look like MDMA effect at MDMA dose, which indeed produces a MDMA-like effect but this is clearly not the real MDMA effect. <br /><br />I would love to get a full-analysis of this fucking stuff and rub it under the nose of Frank Matthews who says everywhere his products are the purest on Earth. <br />In Holland you can get those test for free, only if you&#039;re Dutch.<br />Please, please, please if anyone dutch read this thread, would you make the analysis with a sample I send you ?<br /><br />There is no doubt why FM asks FE, it&#039;s because this way people don&#039;t complain about the quality. He sure send some stuff to every customer but not what was described, and this hypocrit say it is enough to tell that he is a good and honnest seller. There is lot of feedbacks stating that his former products (coke, crack and heroin) were great but now became some cheap shit. FM works thanks to his reputation but does not live by it.<br /><br />I felt like making things clear.

				Moonrocks have to be cut ? Didn&#039;t know, do you know how do they make moonrocks from pure MDMA ?<br /><br />The reputation does not guarantee the best products. FM is surely a great business man because he is extremely professional and always ships fast and secure.<br /><br />Although what bring people to him is mainly his prices for decent products. From the reports, his coke is very decent for the price although some batches happen to suck. His crack was bomb then turned to average.<br /><br />His heroin I think it really is the quality that keep people returning to him.<br /><br />But then he decided to take advantage of his reputation to sell an MDMA that people would think is as good as his other products but actually it is way too much cheap to be the real deal. Of course I nevertheless stupidly wanted to believe his word and ordered out of greed and it is definitely not MDMA. I cannot sell this to anyone because I don&#039;t know what it is.<br /><br />Wavelength, it&#039;s not the aspect of it that makes me say that, the look or color of a drug will never tell anything about it. MDMA synthesis ends up to crystal MDMA, right ? Well if you crush them you have pure MDMA powder.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see what you mean on pure MDMA being an oil ?? Could you explain your thought a little bit further please ?<br />To my knowing an oil, the isosafrole, is used for the synthesis but the form in which MDMA comes out is crystal. At least that is what I always thought :).<br /><br />In that case what are moonrocks ? Aren&#039;t they MDMA crystals ?<br />And again it&#039;s not because it is a crystal that it is pure. It can be pure like this wonderful pictured probably is (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Tan_MDMA_Crystals.jpg/800px-Tan_MDMA_Crystals.jpg) but a lot a chemicals do crystallize as well and if the chemist is not excellent unwanted amounts of the transformed reactants will remain in the end product and will form an unpure MDMA crystals that will lead to an unpure MDMA powder if crushed.<br /><br />Only an anlysis can tell, or more roughly you can test the effect on you to know a little more on the substance you ingested provided you know the real MDMA and you know fairly well your body too.<br /><br />From what I have experienced, the &quot;MDMA&quot; from FM could maybe named ecstasy but not MDMA. You have euphoria, not much physical disconfort except intense grinding teeth, maybe more than with pure MDMA, but definitely you don&#039;t feel the unique MDMA high which is an high of an absolute purity, not speedy to me, and that DON&#039;T FEEL ARTIFICIAL, there ! is the concept I was looking for to explain the difference between MDMA and all other forms of what I call ecstasy, which can be anything made and mixed up to approach MDMA but none of them can nor ever will do. The MDMA bliss is unique and cannot be faked. It&#039;s like LSD, those molecules give a high so pure that you cannot mistake it for anything else once you&#039;ve tasted it. Those molecules make you feel that you brain was designed to integrate them in his functionning each in avery particular way of course, but you fill that every molecule of MDMA or LSD have found the right place in your body the one that will not bore the other cells, like making jammings at cross roads, parking on the handicapped spot, etc... When in your body, those molecules feel at home, your body treat them as a long-term friend to who you tell &quot;of course help yourself&quot; when inviting him &quot;do what ever you wish&quot; because you know he will respect your house and not mess around or finish the bottle of milk without putting a new one in the fridfe (people that do that piss me off so much, what&#039;s the point of eating cereals if you don&#039;t have COLD milk to put with ?).<br />With the other phoney molecules, well you feel that your body is pushed towards that direction, then this way, then forces you to be euphorice, nevermind your heart he&#039;ll calm down later !, you see ? Bad impolite guests. Funny guests though, but you always have to tidy up behind them.<br /><br />I wrote all this diarrhea just to state one point : Frank Matthews do not sell legit MDMA. MDMA does&#039;nt go by 18 euros the gram, this is so stupid to believe that he would do that like I did. I told myself, well he does good prices so that people only buy in bulk. No, no, it&#039;s because it&#039;s shit.<br />Even if it is an highly researched combination of RC&#039;s and idk what else it will for ever just be no more that plain shit because YOU DON&#039;t KNOW WHAT IT REALLY IS..... And it is a shame that the so-called best dealers lower themselves to this type of behavior, because it is irresponsible. P0och, we should go hit up his review thread some day, but I wish I had an analysis of his stuff... If anyone from NL come by, I will pay you for this !<br /><br /><br />&quot;if its from a top 1% vendor, stop giving a shit. people have been coming back to him for a reason!&nbsp; ;)&quot;<br /><br />This does not prove anything, everybody have an iPhone and maybe today&#039;s 5th version is finally quite good but still a lot of them bug and brick for no reason except having to buy a new one, and guess what they do buy a new one... because it is way too hard to confess to themselves that their choice is wrong, &quot;no it can&#039;t be a bad choice because it is everybody&#039;s choice, I will make a fool of myself if I dare to think different, bouhohou&quot;<br />but clearly the first iPhones were plain shit and people would still find them sooo awesome only because it was flashy and everybody told that it was the best. Today everybody tells FM is the best so the masses follow the masses. This by the way is what we call democracy, the power by the gather of collective dumbness.<br /><br />But FM is not bad at all, clearly you can&#039;t reach the 1% being bad, but that doesn&#039;t mean either that he can&#039;t be criticized or provide bad services from time to time. The problem is that people don&#039;t harm themselves, this was the whole point of SR, not to buy something that is not what you thought, but of course the human nature is stronger and comes back. But the good thing here is that people, choices and voices are free, so wa can make the things right and fix those situations only if we dare to speak up.

Test came out OK and it smelled like the goods. <br /><br />The thing that worries me is if it might have been cut? its pretty much crushed to powder form so really no crystals or rocks that i can see.<br /><br />Colour is tan/whitish. <br /><br />I understand that it might have been crushed for postage but other dealers have always maintained at least small rocks or crystals in theirs so its dissappointing to see this in powdery state.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tested a bit on it and it feels like MDMA, Good comedown too but just didnt roll hard like the other 84% products.<br /><br />How do i know guys?<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So the EZ test kit showed it is MDMA?

I have been worrying the past week from who to buy MDMA, narrowed my list to HolandOnline and FM, then HO went stealth over weekend, and finally when I got my coins today I ordered from FM. And then I saw these posts, daamn. You could have posted that in his review thread or somewhere, so people are informed.<br /><br />Personally, I still hope and believe I&#039;ll get mdma (maybe a bit cut), because I just doubt there are so many dumb people on SR buying off FM and that they wouldn&#039;t preform EZ test and then write a bad review.<br /><br />I will also take FM&#039;s mdma to the lab, we have free testing where I come from I think, and will report back in about a week or so (have to get the shipment first).<br /><br />Greets,<br />danjohnken

But I will probably be ordering from him once in the future, 1g or 5g listing, and will send it to the lab. Expect that to be done in about a month I hope, because I really should use this option of a free lab :) Meanwhile, I ordered from Full Escrow UK, check his review thread and MDMA review thread, where I&#039;ll post feedback on his stuff. But I won&#039;t be sending that to the lab, have enough trust in FEUK not to have it tested atm.<br /><br />Yeah, it&#039;s really weird nobody post reviews of FM&#039;s mdma anywhere, but it&#039;s best selling mdma on the road. I really look forward to testing it in a lab. You said that FM&#039;s mdma passed marquis test?

His crack was bomb then turned to average.<br /><br />His heroin I think it really is the quality that keep people returning to him.<br /><br />But then he decided to take advantage of his reputation to sell an MDMA that people would think is as good as his other products but actually it is way too much cheap to be the real deal.

You have euphoria, not much physical disconfort except intense grinding teeth, maybe more than with pure MDMA, but definitely you don&#039;t feel the unique MDMA high which is an high of an absolute purity, not speedy to me, and that DON&#039;T FEEL ARTIFICIAL, there ! is the concept I was looking for to explain the difference between MDMA and all other forms of what I call ecstasy, which can be anything made and mixed up to approach MDMA but none of them can nor ever will do. The MDMA bliss is unique and cannot be faked. It&#039;s like LSD, those molecules give a high so pure that you cannot mistake it for anything else once you&#039;ve tasted it. Those molecules make you feel that you brain was designed to integrate them in his functionning each in avery particular way of course, but you fill that every molecule of MDMA or LSD have found the right place in your body the one that will not bore the other cells, like making jammings at cross roads, parking on the handicapped spot, etc... When in your body, those molecules feel at home, your body treat them as a long-term friend to who you tell &quot;of course help yourself&quot; when inviting him &quot;do what ever you wish&quot; because you know he will respect your house and not mess around or finish the bottle of milk without putting a new one in the fridfe (people that do that piss me off so much, what&#039;s the point of eating cereals if you don&#039;t have COLD milk to put with ?).<br />With the other phoney molecules, well you feel that your body is pushed towards that direction, then this way, then forces you to be euphorice, nevermind your heart he&#039;ll calm down later !, you see ? Bad impolite guests. Funny guests though, but you always have to tidy up behind them.<br /><br />I wrote all this diarrhea just to state one point : Frank Matthews do not sell legit MDMA. MDMA does&#039;nt go by 18 euros the gram, this is so stupid to believe that he would do that like I did. I told myself, well he does good prices so that people only buy in bulk. No, no, it&#039;s because it&#039;s shit.<br />Even if it is an highly researched combination of RC&#039;s and idk what else it will for ever just be no more that plain shit because YOU DON&#039;t KNOW WHAT IT REALLY IS..... And it is a shame that the so-called best dealers lower themselves to this type of behavior, because it is irresponsible. P0och, we should go hit up his review thread some day, but I wish I had an analysis of his stuff... If anyone from NL come by, I will pay you for this !<br /><br /><br />&quot;if its from a top 1% vendor, stop giving a shit. people have been coming back to him for a reason!&nbsp; ;)&quot;<br /><br />This does not prove anything, everybody have an iPhone and maybe today&#039;s 5th version is finally quite good but still a lot of them bug and brick for no reason except having to buy a new one, and guess what they do buy a new one... because it is way too hard to confess to themselves that their choice is wrong, &quot;no it can&#039;t be a bad choice because it is everybody&#039;s choice, I will make a fool of myself if I dare to think different, bouhohou&quot;<br />but clearly the first iPhones were plain shit and people would still find them sooo awesome only because it was flashy and everybody told that it was the best. Today everybody tells FM is the best so the masses follow the masses. This by the way is what we call democracy, the power by the gather of collective dumbness.<br /><br />But FM is not bad at all, clearly you can&#039;t reach the 1% being bad, but that doesn&#039;t mean either that he can&#039;t be criticized or provide bad services from time to time. The problem is that people don&#039;t harm themselves, this was the whole point of SR, not to buy something that is not what you thought, but of course the human nature is stronger and comes back. But the good thing here is that people, choices and voices are free, so wa can make the things right and fix those situations only if we dare to speak up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is imo the market has shifted. Pills use to be the main form of MDMA. All types of crap was loaded into them because people where ignorant and didn&#039;t know better. Now that pill reporting websites exist a bad stamp gets flamed and can shunt sales very quickly. Molly on the other hand is indistinguishable from anyone else molly. It is sold by weight and prone to cutting at any level. Pills are sold by dose, a weak pill does not get purchased. A good press is alot more reliable than today&#039;s molly.

				Despite what a lot of folks here think, the competition is very high on SR for drugs like MDMA and other substances. Cutting various things may fly in real life but as soon as people catch wind that your product is an inferior product even by a slight hair, they will just hop over to another vendor. Some people actually take pride in their products..
