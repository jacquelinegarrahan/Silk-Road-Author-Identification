				I am an experienced psychonaut, but I almost never take a good sit down and listen to music while im tripping. I usually tend to be more into the visual aspect of things. Next time I dose, however, i think im going to have a nice music session. I&#039;ve heard that you can never go wrong with pink flloyd, but what other artists have trippy music like this? I&#039;ve heard that aphex twin is pretty trippy, as well as grateful dead. The song &quot;echoes&quot; by pink flloyd i hear is very mesmerising, but i&#039;ve actually never listened to it while sober, so it should prove to be an interesting experience when i do listen to it. What else do you reccomend?

				All of the songs on Pink floyd&#039;s Dark Side of the Moon<br /><br />Pink Floyd&#039;s &#039;Echoes&#039; (song, not album - it syncrhonises with the film &#039;2001: A Space Odyssey&#039;, if you want something to watch with it)<br /><br />

				Floyd can be fucking sublime, no kidding.<br /><br />But - and y&#039;all will think I&#039;m fucking nuts - Indian/African/South American drums, and religious choral (Gregorian chant, Muslim calls to prayer, etc.). <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard people say they don&#039;t feel euphoria on LSD.

				Favorites have to be boards of canada, the mars volta and pink floyd.<br />All very different moods can intensify or calm down a trip. Had many special moments listening to the entirety of shine on your crazy diamond while tripping&nbsp; :D

				whatever you choose to listen to, I would recommend listening to an album in it&#039;s full entirety. Really gives you a new perspective on the album as a whole and what the artists were trying to convey.<br /><br />Also any Sun Ra album is fucking life changing on acid

				This question is too open ended. A trip is so subjective and evolving. I find the best music is that that fits the mood best, so it can be anything. But in a meditative state if you are going lying in bed with headphones on and using it as a soundtrack music that evokes a &quot;deepness&quot; is best. I have been working on such a playlist this week. I may upload it or at least list it. Other than that, listen to what YOU like!

				I just said this in another similar thread, but the album Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys is sublime on acid, give it a go!<br /><br />Agree with the worldy type music too.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The extended version of &#039;Circle of Life&#039; from the lion king was awesome/kindafunny.<br /><br />Instrumental jazz can be cool too.<br /><br />The Beatles haven&#039;t been mentioned yet, loadsa good stuff there.<br /><br />Aaah most things are good!!

				Somehow I always end up listening or whirling around to dark psy, which kinda hard for me to listen to while not tripping. I think its mainly made for tripping. <br />Dunno, if you guys know psytrance icon Goa Gil, but he is playing that shit 24 hours nonstop on his trance dance experience partys 8).

Give me some gypsy violin or Nordic folk&nbsp; over most modern music any day/night.&nbsp; <br />That and Tool, lots of Tool.&nbsp; <br />Wardruna is amazing. <br />Really great nature tracks, chillstep or tribal, coupled with thunderstorm tracks(played at the same time) will take you to another place entirely. <br />Clean, acoustic is great. <br />Hell, even really heavy rock/metal can be great, it just depends on teh trip. <br />Tim Minchin. :D (God, especially if you&#039;ve never heard him or have any clue of who he is)<br />Most times the surprises are what make for great trips, planning usually leaves me restless.<br />I could name at least thirty off the top of my head, then you have branching out into deep soul, great bluegrass, clean acoustic, etc..... I could go all night, baby. ;P

				acid mothers temple. This music was made specifically for tripping. It doesn&#039;t sound that great when sober, but trust me, it sounds good with LSD. my favourite song is &#039;the beautiful blue ecstacy&#039;.

				Trip your balls off at a jam band fest and wonder what the hell you did with the rest of your life!&nbsp; Nothing like seeing into the dynamics of an improvisation, song transition and the push and pull of the band members on each other, the energy they pull from the crowd.&nbsp; It has to be experienced to be believed.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Dead is dead but there are still some kick ass bands out there that can bring you to another and different world each show they play.&nbsp; Jamtronica is my recent kick, Big Gigantic, Conspirator, STS9 all experienced live are recent highlights....<br /><br />Live music rules!&nbsp; Also, my big initiation into mind expanding states with music was Pink Floyd.&nbsp; No joke, Pink Floyd was decades ahead of their time.&nbsp; They are genius, all the albums, experienced as full albums are mind blowing.....<br /><br />blahblah1234

				you cant go wrong with any 60s psychedelic music.. Led Zeppelin concerts are awesome on acid (i remember seeing the waves of music coming out of my speakers).. personally i close my eyes and listen to classical music, anything with Beethoven on the piano or Bach is awesome brain stimulation!
