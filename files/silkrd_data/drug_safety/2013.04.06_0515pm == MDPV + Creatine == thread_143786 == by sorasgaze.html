				First off, I have no knowledge of muscle building supplements and anything like that so please forgive me if this is an extremely stupid question. I haven&#039;t had PV in months, and just ordered a gram. When taken in &quot;high&quot; doses (20+ mg) I noticed muscle tension making me tense my shoulders really bad. MDPV has played it&#039;s role in weight loss for me as well as gaining muscle in the stomach region from so much muscle tension, similar to doing sit-ups but from stimulant drugs lol. I&#039;m happy with muscle build from the PV even though it&#039;s probably not such a good thing to do high doses. Since creatine is a muscle-building supplement, could it be taken in oral doses with the PV to support muscle build even more? I&#039;m aware stimulants do not support muscle building, but PV gives me crazy muscle tension and works for me somehow. Once again, sorry if this is a stupid question. I couldn&#039;t find any info anywhere else. Thanks.<br />

				Lol I don&#039;t know where to begin.<br /><br />First you didn&#039;t get ab&#039;s because your tensing your body, it&#039;s because like you said you lost weight.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing you lost quite a lot of body fat which is why your ab&#039;s are more visible now.&nbsp; EVERYONE has ab&#039;s but some of them aren&#039;t visible due to the excess water and fat under the skin and over the muscle.<br /><br />Creatine will NOT build muscle with out hypertrophy. In other words, it won&#039;t do jack shit if you don&#039;t actually work out.&nbsp; Creatine is not really anabolic, it&#039;s just helps retain a better ph level in the muscle, create more atp aka energy for contraction, and a cell volumizer.&nbsp; Helps cells retain water which does help protein synthesis and the other things I mentioned.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly, sounds like your going a bit over board no?&nbsp; I&#039;m not to judge but for your own health sounds like your using this drug on top of recreational use to lose weight in an unhealthy way.&nbsp; Just to let you know, once you stop abusing it, you will rebound in weight and gain it all back in no time.<br /><br />Learn to diet and build muscle correctly.&nbsp; Become a bodybuilder like me :)

I was planning on working out with the combo, I think I&#039;ll use the PV for weight loss and use the creatine for working out once the PV is gone. I have a healthy diet and proper exercise and pretty good muscle build as it is, my abs have always showed, I&#039;m not fat at all, but it just seemed more noticeable from the peeve use. You know what you&#039;re talking about though, so thank you.

We had to run a mile at school once and me and a few friends were all on MDPV and it was hell in that heat. It&#039;s probably better off that I not do any type of exercise while on it. lol.

				Why the hell would you use MDPV to lose weight?<br /><br />If you have to use a drug for weight loss, use amphetamine.....
