				Look, basically I&#039;m a miserable bastard and decided recently to do something about it.&nbsp; While I&#039;m happy-ish most of the time, I can get pretty depressed, apathetic, lazy, bummed - not enough to cease functioning, but enough to realise that I&#039;m not doing/getting what I want because of my negativity, and that I&#039;m generally a downer to be around.<br /><br />So for the past week I&#039;ve been trying out Modafinil.&nbsp; Self-medicating, 200mg a day, first thing in the morning.<br /><br />Generally, it&#039;s a step forward.&nbsp; Enough of a mood lift to make a difference, I can definitely get off my arse and do things without talking myself down, and socially I feel I can talk to whoever, and I feel like I&#039;m less spacey and live in the moment more.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a bad place to be.<br /><br />Big downside though - 200mg has a fucking long half-life.&nbsp; Even taking it at 6am, by 10pm that part of my brain which I need to switch off to sleep doesn&#039;t really want to, so I struggle to get to sleep and stay asleep.&nbsp; Ironically though after a week of this I don&#039;t feel tired when I wake up, despite a week of very average sleeps.&nbsp; If I was having that without Moda I&#039;d be a train wreck.<br /><br />So next on the cards, is a week at 100mg to see what that does.<br /><br />What&#039;s your experience on low dose daily stims/nootropics?<br /><br />I&#039;m especially keen to hear from the less extreme cases - people who just want to turn themselves into a better version of themselves.

				So I&#039;m super late to reply to this but;<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to try modafinil for the same reasons. In the past I have used vyvanse for a daily &#039;boost&#039; of making myself a more productive, awake version of myself. Upside: in my business I accomplish a lot without completely neglecting my social responsibilities. Downside: after a few days I feel like crap, lose weight, and one winter I&#039;m completely convinced vyvanse was the source of me getting a really bad chest cold for about a month (in part due to forgetting to eat and generally neglecting sleep/health).<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts on using modafinil daily if you&#039;re still doing that. :)

				I supp every morning with 7-8 g piracetam. Not quite a &quot;low&quot; dose, but noticeably effective in producing cognitive enhancement, plus it&#039;s a great synch with my much beloved 25i (as well as numerous other substances). I&#039;ve heard rumors that piracetam supposedly combats amphetamine toxicity, and with 25i being a relatively new member of the phenethylamine family, my daily supplementation with piracetam gives me a warm sense of security. Let&#039;s just hope that sense of safety is rooted in legitimacy&nbsp; ;)

				Even if you switch to something &quot;heavy&quot; like amphetamine or methamphetamine, provided you never, ever, ever go above clinically approved dosages... the side effects and dangers are extremely minimal.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason adderall and dexedrine are so commonly prescribed long-term for treatment of ADHD.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t become an addict, there really is almost no risk.&nbsp; Still... that&#039;s one fucking HUGE &quot;if,&quot; right there.
