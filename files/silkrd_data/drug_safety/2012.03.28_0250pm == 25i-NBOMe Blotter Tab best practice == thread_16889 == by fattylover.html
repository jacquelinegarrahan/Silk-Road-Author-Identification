				I have some 25i-NBOMe on the way and have been instructed to place it between my upper lip and gum, my question is will brushing my gums with my toothbrush a lot help absorption?&nbsp; Also I&#039;m not going to stick it up my ass so don&#039;t advise that thanks.

				If you take it sublingually don&#039;t swallow for 20 minutes.<br />IMO the best way to take it is buccally, putting the blotter between your upper gum and lip. No need to worry about saliva this way :)<br />

				Yes, lightly brushing your gum to clean off someone the mucus membrane will aid absorption.&nbsp; Don&#039;t swallow your saliva.

				Wanted to include this 411 for archival purposes regarding those who have circulatory issues from previous trauma, or for whatever reason, and the consumption of 25i-NBOMe. I will start with some background. The subject I will be using for experiential data is myself so one must consider the source... I am a 6 foot tall, 250 pound, 42 year old male who, in 2004, was the pedestrian in a pedestrian versus automobile accident. Coma for 54 days, 120 days of rehab hospitalization, two steel rods - one in each leg, 11 hour facial/skull reconstruct - 8 pieces of titanium in my spine, yadda yadda. Anyway, all of my large deep veins in both legs were crushed in the accident and I am left with a network of much smaller veins to return my blood to the heart, so I am very sensitive to hypertension/vasoconstriction.&nbsp; If anyone else has the tendency to have&nbsp; DVT ( deep vein thrombosis - a blod clot ), this report may be of interest to you.<br /><br />I have been using psychedelics since 1985 and I have experienced most of the champions: LSD, peyote, psilocybes, tampenesis, MDMA, salvia, DMT, no ayahausca yet but you get the idea of my realm of experience.&nbsp; None of these aforementioned substances have ever caused me vasoconstriction or vasoconstriction with the exception of LSD, which has only given me hypertension a couple of times. After having three experiences with 25i-NBOMe (2x 2mg 1x 1.5mg). The RC was complexed and the 2mg trips were very nice. The 1.5mg dose didn&#039;t quite make it over the hump, but I did notice some pretty serious CONS for those of us with lower extremity circulation issues. What few veins I have left in my lower legs hurt all the way through the come up and didn&#039;t quit until after T 6:00. For me 2mg is the starting point for this molecule, but I won&#039;t do more than that because of the circulation thang....<br /><br />Thought I&#039;d let you guys know who may be on the seniors tour or have circulation issues.<br /><br />Love,<br />Telperion

				It&#039;s a great little molecule. Very forgiving. Very empathic in nature, visual and audio warping/distortion, electric trails, and ambient color overlays, very positive vibe with an upbeat current to it.&nbsp; It is great at 2mg - probably 3.5 or 4mg when trying to compare intensity level with something like an LSD breakthrough or DMT or those more intense hallucinogenic substances, but it seems to share some traits with mushroom visuals to a degree.&nbsp; 1mg or 1 complexed blotter was a 7hr thing for me, so maybe that&#039;s the kind of info you&#039;re looking for? As you see by my previous post, I experience a bit of a body load from it, but this is my first with anything outside of the &#039;traditional&#039; psychedelics/hallucinogens. The unique thing I did notice about Cimbi5 was it&#039;s gravity welling/energy welling in my core. Groovy groovy trait of this little fella. Nice feeling for sure.<br /><br />Telperion

				ha ha - Brain Rape - I&#039;m copping that riff for sure. Very funny.&nbsp; No, it is a very gentle molecule but has a bit of a higher velocity current to it, with a lot of potential for creation.&nbsp; What I mean is that the space&nbsp; is very pliable and minds it&#039;s manners well, and you can control it if things get too wacky while you are &#039;letting go&#039;. That&#039;s another really cool thing about this molecule - it&#039;s ability to be piloted - Remember though, my experience is only with a 2 blotter dose though (2 mg ), so that may change when you get around 3 or 4 blotters. I don&#039;t know.

				I just want to warn people not to do anything stupid like I did over the weekend. I ingested 2 tabs of 25i and was definitely feeling it. It was my 2nd experience with the drug and I have been enjoying it. After about 2.5-3 hours, I was loving the visuals, but my mind felt relatively sober so I decided to take 180mg of MDMA (thinking it would be like a candyflip which I have experience with).<br /><br />Once the MDMA kicked in, it hit fast. I was pretty worried for a little while because my heart had never beat that fast before. I was sweating and was getting kind of scared. Luckily, my dog seemed to sense my anxiety and he came and leaned on my chest. Stroking his fur and feeling him on my chest immediately relaxed me and my heart slowed down. It was all gravy after that---very much like a candyflip.<br /><br />Just wanted to caution anyone who may be considering this combo. It was fun after the initial heart-racing, but be very careful and aware of your heart rate. I made a mistake and will not be doing this combo again. I can imagine had I been at an event it would have ended badly.

				NBOMe&#039;s give some vasoconstriction and are stimulating, so it&#039;s better to be careful when combining them with other stimulants.
