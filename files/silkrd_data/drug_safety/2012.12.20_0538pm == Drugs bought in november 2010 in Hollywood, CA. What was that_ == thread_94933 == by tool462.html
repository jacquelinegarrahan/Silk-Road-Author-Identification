				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I spent a few weeks in Hollywood, Ca. in November 2010. I used to buy in a shop on Hollywood boulevard a product sold legally as a plant fertilizer. <br /><br />It was a mix between white powder/crystals powder. It was for snorting. The price was 47 dollars a bag (i think it was a gram). I used to take a bag a day, then 2 bags a day.<br /><br />The high was very euphoric, made you really active and focused, I was quite friendly, was enjoying music as never. <br /><br />Second effect was higher than normal body temperature, sweating, faster heart beat, no appetite. And I have to admit quite addictive. I do not remember it was hard for the noose. I had no problem to sleep after taking this drugs but I was taking trazodone to sleep at that time.<br /><br />What do you think It could be? I&#039;m already sure it was not Cocaine, Speed or mdma.<br /><br />Thanks helping me finding that drug and sorry if I&#039;ve made some mistakes in english

				Mephedrone is my first guess based on your description. But then you said that if is not hard to snort. I&#039;ve tried mephedrone and it is hellish on my nose.

				Wasn&#039;t in that area during that time, so I couldn&#039;t tell you for sure, but mephedrone would be a really good guess, it was being sold as plant fertilizer around that time and all the effects match up.&nbsp; When I was in fla I had a variety of rc&#039;s or i guess people would say bath salts, which werent mephedrone but had similar effects.&nbsp; Its probably just a derivative of it

And I took a lot of street cocaine in my life so my nose is maybe used to be fucked up.<br /><br />I ordered 5 grams. I will let you know if it was well Mephedrone.<br /><br />Thanks all for answering

				When JWH-018 first hit the market it was being sold as Bonzi Fertalizer. With the feelings you described, I can easliy see it being that. In the forms I recieved it in, it was white and a little crystal to it. I was deep into it when it first came out.
