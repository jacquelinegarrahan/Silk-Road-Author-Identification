				So this is my first time trying H, and being paranoid as fuck I used a small dose. I didn&#039;t get the rush I expected, aside from an already racing heart because I was really nervous. I gradually got high, it was nice like any opiate, but I&#039;m pretty disappointed. I&#039;m thinking I just missed the vein... Had a feeling that would happen too.<br /><br />Any tips for hitting the vein? I have been told I have good veins before. I didn&#039;t use a tourniquet or belt or anything, although I did try lifting some heavy stuff ahead of time. I really shouldn&#039;t need a tourniquet because I could see the vein bulging out pretty well. It was about in the center of my arm. I put the needle in at about a 30 degree angle and pushed it all the way in. I used swabs beforehand and a clean needle. Am I missing something here? Or just any tips?

				The OP sounds exactly like me before I became a pro at shooting-up. In no time at all i was waking out of bed in the middle of the night to fish dirty needles out of the trash so I could inject any kind of narcotics. Keep at it, you&#039;ll figure it out.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve missed a couple times (with pills, which you aren&#039;t &quot;supposed&quot; to shoot really) and I could feel my skin filling up and there was a bump, not very tall, about the size of a quarter/half dollar. It didn&#039;t hurt me, but if you don&#039;t feel something (drug) within a minute and then you do several minutes later you probably did miss. If you do miss put something warm on the spot to help your body absorb the stuff, so there will be less chance of abscess.<br />And make sure you don&#039;t hit an artery..<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link that has some info (reading material type):<br />http://harmreduction.org/issues/drugs-drug-users/drug-information/safer-injection-materials/<br /><br />The 5 &quot;Safer Injection Outreach Brochures,&quot; have very helpful information (all .pdf). I learned so much reading these, I&#039;d been IV&#039;ing a while before I found them.. I&#039;m obsessive about this kind of thing though.<br />This is probably the one you want out of the 5:<br />http://harmreduction.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/therighthit-goodneedleinsertion.pdf<br /><br />Hope you&#039;ve figured it out and haven&#039;t lost an arm&nbsp; ;)

				I would like to chime in and say M364M1ND is completely right about the needle being an addiction in itself, as I&#039;m sure they knows from experience. <br />Sometimes you just shoot water cause you need to shoot SOMETHING. You&#039;ll shoot anything and everything you can. It&#039;s completely ridiculous. Just thinking about the blood flowing into the barrel is a fucking rush... Yeah.

				If you use dope long enough you can usually find that &quot;perfect&quot; vein. I have a vein that runs down my left arm which I can hit EVERY time, I can&#039;t remember the last time I missed a shot.<br /><br />What I do is:<br /><br />I tie off with a belt, clench my fist and move my arm up and down a few times, slap around the vein and then rub it hard for like 2 or 3 seconds, and then the vein is nice and raised.<br /><br />I&#039;ll then feel it out and stick the syringe in where I want and when you hit, blood will almost always immediately shoot into the syringe...once you see that DON&#039;T MOVE THE SYRINGE AT ALL! Slowly push down on the plunger, take the syringe out, and wipe the blood off...bythe time the syringe is out of your arm (or wherever you&#039;re shooting) you&#039;ll be high as fuck hopefully!<br /><br />If blood is not shooting into your syringe, that doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re not in a vein...sometimes I find that I&#039;m in a vein (you get used to the feeling once you&#039;ve hit) and will have to pull up the plunger a tiny bit to create suction. If you&#039;re not in a vein, the shot will burn and the plunger will not press down as easily...and you&#039;ll start to see the area raise up a little bit. If this happens, pulls out and try again. Obviously the goal is to hit a vein so you feel that great rush, but if you don&#039;t you&#039;ll still get high it will just take around 5 minutes for you to feel it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not seeing blood shooting into the syringe, move the syringe around a little bit to see if the vein is close by...if it&#039;s not, then obviouslly pull out and try a different spot.<br /><br />Being a new IV heroin user, sometimes it takes a little while to get used to it but before you know it you&#039;ll be able to cook up, hit a vein, and get a rush all within 30 seconds or less! You can practice by filling a syringe up with water and try hitting a vein that way you won&#039;t lose any dope.<br /><br />If you&#039;re trying new dope out and you have a low tolerance, PLEASE BE CAREFUL! You can always do more but if you do to much you can&#039;t take it back! Hit a vein, push down the plunger a little bit, wait 5-10 seconds and if you can handle it THEN do the rest.

				First post here! Hey everybody..<br /><br />I haven&#039;t IV&#039;d any dope in almost a year I think, as for any other substance I think its been about that long too. It&#039;s a pretty shitty road (certainly not made of Silk), and I can agree the needle itself is quite an addiction. I started with the usually C&amp;D, wasn&#039;t too long before I&#039;d put all kinds of dumb shit in a spoon. And how many times you find yourself doing those cottons/washes for the Xth time when they were no good the first, shit!<br /><br />Those Harm Reduction type links are good, I saw quite a few years ago a HR PDF file with pretty detailed instructions, all that HR type stuff is good. It helps to use a fresh rig every time, even if not seen with the naked eye they can get some nasty burrs and whatnot pretty quickly. Sometimes too the drug itself can have an effect on how difficult it is to hit (not at first but, cocaine for example is a vasoconstrictor(sp?), may find as your evening of IV cocaine use goes on, it&#039;ll get harder and harder to hit a vein). I know certain substances are more prone to cause infection than others, pills I think are pretty notorious for being worse to miss.<br /><br />Theres some forums around the web dedicated to opiates, particularly IV, and you could gather some good info there I&#039;d think. Check out &#039;Wheel filters&#039;, I&#039;ve actually never tried them but they&#039;ll filter out things down to some microns, no space for microbes and whatnot, I think they&#039;re more for two piece rigs that aren&#039;t as common in the US.<br /><br /><br />Good luck, be safe and careful. They say &#039;you can always do more but you can never do less&#039; thats a good thing to remember I think, and definitely never share rigs/water anything, not worth it man.

				I read your post and I have two tips. <br /><br />1. Ask a friend to inject the heroin for you. It is much easier when you have two hands free. <br />2. You say that you pushed the needle all the way in. I&#039;m suspecting you went too far in. When you push it in, do it very slowly. It is possible to feel the moment you enter the vein as a decrease in resistance, and the moment you reach the other side of the vein there is an increase in resistance (telling you stop there). If no blood sucks out you could try pulling the needle back a tiny bit, because it is easy to push a little too far.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				All very good posts...<br /><br />just wanted to add a little detail:<br /><br />there are valves inside the veins as well.&nbsp; these valves are bicuspid (two leaves) and unidirectional.&nbsp; they help the low pressure venous circulation to transport the blood back to the heart and back to the arterial circulation.&nbsp; Because venous blood is pumped against gravity in the standing position, these valves prevent the back flow of blood that would occur in their absence.<br /><br />it is not uncommon when injecting to hit a valve with the end of your needle.&nbsp; Although you are technically &quot;in the vein,&quot; injection of your substance would be difficult.&nbsp; I find that using a shallow angle of entry into your vein, almost parallel if you depress the farther side of the vein first and pull back&nbsp; the more proximal side, helps the injection if you happen to run into one of these valves.&nbsp; Just pull back a little the needle and then proceed with injection.&nbsp; <br /><br />hope this helps, G<br /><br />p.s. - am wondering about listing some IV start kits.&nbsp; just a thought at this point.&nbsp; but, it would include an iv catheter that can be left safely in the vein for several days with proper sterile care and iv maintenance, i.e. flushing.&nbsp; pm me if you&#039;re interested.&nbsp; i&#039;m also designing a tourniquet that can be used one handed and released gradually.&nbsp;

				Def gotta get a flash before to push that plunger down or your gonna fuck yourself up.<br /><br />I understand as&nbsp; a beginner the anxiety of putting a needle in your arm and using one hand to work it ect.<br /><br />If your using short tips, for me I cant go at an angle. I gotta go straight on and it works great, its how everyone I know does it. <br /><br />Just be careful its a whole dif demon. Start shooting and watch how fast you get dope sick compared to snorting, its insane. I can shoot a 8mg D at 1 am and wake up sick as hell.<br /><br />Get a back up plan subs domes whatever and be sterile. Dont lick your needle ect and always make sure you register with a flash.<br /><br />You think this is hard wait till your puking and shittin everywhere&nbsp; shaking while trying to shoot. My hands get so clammy its like i can barely hold onto the rig.<br /><br />

I find holding a rolled up shirt or towel under my armpit and squeezing your arm tightly against&nbsp; your body works well, much easier to release the pressure in your arm, just need slightly raise your arm a bit. <br /><br />The releasing pressure part is super important , because if you try to depress the plunger before releasing the pressure , it feels almost like your not in a vein(harder to push it down) and if you do manage to force it into your arm , the moment you release the belt , you get a really hard hit , which ive found my heart really doesn&#039;t appreciate, especially if its a big shot or your first and your not certain of potency. Also it leaves a really bad bruise where the blood gets forced back out of the injection site after you take the needle out, the stereotypical track marks, not pretty.<br /><br />Once ive registered and seen blood in the barrel , i push the plunger to half way , pause for a few seconds , then i draw back again , to make sure im still registered(also this gives time for you to gauge how strong it is) then quickly decide if you want the rest or to hold off for awhile. This is why if your going to do it, its a really good idea to learn to do it yourself, or at least have a practice with just water to begin with, letting other people do it for you can be dangerous .I had mate do a shot for me one time, half way through i knew it was really strong gear , but didn&#039;t really have to time to say anything, because my mate was so focused. Ended up having a reasonable OD, not life threatening , but very unpleasant.<br /><br />Always start with a really small dose, you can always do more if its not strong enough, but you cant undo an overdose.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wish I didn&#039;t have to use a belt but my &quot;dope vein&quot; as I call it is like a 100% hit if I tie off with a belt. I can still hit it without a belt but it&#039;s a little more difficult. My veins aren&#039;t really noticeable but when I tie off with a belt they start to really bulge up and are VERY easy to see and hit so that&#039;s why I always tie off :).

				I guess one thing that would be good to mention since nobody else has. After you register, push the syringe down toward your skin at an angle so the end of the barrel grips into your skin. Like flat against your arm. This will help hold the needle in place while you inject. And don&#039;t just assume you&#039;re always in the vein once you register. Frequently pull back a little just to make sure you&#039;re in while injecting.

				Thanks for all the great advice. Sorry guys, I thought this thread died earlier than it did.<br /><br />I have not IV&#039;d since trying a few times after I first posted this. I know I hit a vein once but it was when I was using the very last of the batch, probably less than 25mg. I definitely like the needle and will try it again in the future, since I want to feel a really good rush at some point.<br /><br />In response to the warnings about addiction - lucky for me, I seem to have a good sense of moderation for now. I know it&#039;s sad but I actually kind of like the idea of becoming addicted. I love doing opiates, I love the idea of both opiates and needles, AND I have a weak personality, yet I haven&#039;t developed a problem. In fact I&#039;ve never even ordered more than a small amount off of SR (partly because it&#039;s expensive here). And then when it does get here I go through it slowly and incredibly cautiously. I think the real danger for me is if I end up getting connections in real life and fall into a junkie lifestyle. I guess it&#039;s a threat in the long run. Thanks for the warnings.

				@Sweatless -&nbsp; I think if you&#039;re already thinking cautiously at the very beginning that should bode well for you.&nbsp; It&#039;s when you get too comfortable with the idea that you can just use it when you want to is when you get into trouble.<br /><br />Just a general question, but would anyone be interested in an IV kit, i.e. having an IV catheter that you can place for a few days and can inject through a port.&nbsp; It would save your veins from multiple sticks if you are reinjecting several times a day.&nbsp; Which brings me to another question.&nbsp; How many times do you inject in an average session?&nbsp; Is it just once?&nbsp; I only sniff so I wouldn&#039;t know but I might resniff a few times a day.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks for the advice, G

Do you actually know what addiction really is? Do you also, kind of like the idea of your family fucking you off because you&#039;ve pawned your mum&#039;s jewellery for the fifth time, all your possessions gone, septic pits in your arms, lying in a jail cell, rattling your tit&#039;s off, looking at a 4 year sentence, lost all your mates because they&#039;ve had enough of your lying, cheating, stealing, reduced to shoplifting, getting dragged out of the store by the police with everybody staring, lying in your pit, contemplating suicide because your life has turned to shit!<br />Does that sound like your kind of thing, because that is what addiction is about, and not many people can climb back out of that pit.

				wow this brings back memories lol.&nbsp; i remember making an almost identical post on a different forum when i shot up the first time myself.&nbsp; it&#039;s almost funny to me now when i think back to how scared i was i was going to mess it up.&nbsp; i thought every little tiny bubble of air was a death certificate with my name on it.&nbsp; i was convinced i was going to OD on 2mg of hydromorphone lol.&nbsp; i will say though that everyone told me in that post don&#039;t do it man there&#039;s no turning back, and i spouted something about how i can handle my shit, but sure enough the thinking process went just like this:&nbsp; &quot;well i&#039;m only going to use a needle once so i can get that rush i&#039;m looking for just once.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;well that was alot easier than i thought,&nbsp; maybe i&#039;ll do it one more time&quot;&nbsp; than one more and one more and then there&#039;s no turning back.&nbsp; once i got that first rush and realized i didn&#039;t have to go to the hospital and lie to get it&nbsp; nothing else would do.&nbsp; so listen man i&#039;m going to tell you now.&nbsp; if you don&#039;t want to be a dope slave, don&#039;t use the needle.&nbsp; &nbsp;But then again i know i wasn&#039;t going to listen to anyone i wanted to be a junkie.&nbsp; But as a warning there&#039;s nothing fun about being dope sick.&nbsp; be responsible and have fun brother/sister!

				hey everyone, thanks for all the informative replies so far. i tested out on myself yesterday. i have 3ml/30g 1/2 syringes and decided to see if i could go through with injecting. i made several attempts injecting and found myself comfortably(i think) in one vein. no blood came out by itself but when i pulled back on the plunger nice, dark red blood came out. now i have some alright bruising around the injecting site. normal? as far as injecting, i want to inject at around a perpendicular angle to the vein or do i want it a bit higher until im in the vein? and i know im in the vein when the needle goes in smooth right?<br /><br />plus, i have some really meaty veins on my hands. would it be worth using them or should i stick to my arms?<br /><br />and not to highjack the thread but if i were to plug some bth, would i need to cook in spoon and then filter the solution or can i just add water to bth and then suck up into syringe and then inject? <br /><br />thanks everyone! :)

				If you&#039;re really in tune you can feel it kind of pop when it goes in to the vein. You should go in at about a 30 degree angle with the hole in the syringe facing up. Once in the skin draw back till there&#039;s a small air bubble, and push the needle in until the bubble fills with blood, or you see a nice plume of blood squirt into the barrel. Push the&nbsp; plunger, about half way done pull back to make sure you&#039;re still in, and then keep going until the plunger is all the way down. Pull it straight out, and if you can run warm to hot water over injection site, then wipe with alcohol.

Even though you can see the veins in your hands close to the skin, they are harder to hit and not easy to heal. Plus you risk some nerve damage in your hands. <br />Also, you shouldn&#039;t really have any bruising from one injection with a new needle. It sounds like you missed some there. You will KNOW when you hit that vein the first time. And then...it&#039;s up to you...

				It sounds like you hit it to me.&nbsp; You said that you pulled back on the plunger and got blood it sounds like you&#039;re in to me.&nbsp; Occasionally while injecting after I&#039;ve registered and am pushing the drugs into my veins my needle will slip out or I&#039;ll accidentally poke through the other side but i get that same painful bump i get if i missed completely&nbsp; and even if i hit a vein with a brand new needle i always bruise at the injection site no matter what.&nbsp; It probably changes from person to person but I agree with sickboy you will know without a doubt when you&#039;ve hit it.&nbsp; My suggestion is still don&#039;t bang anything ever.&nbsp; But if you are dead set on doing it.&nbsp; I found in the beginning it was much easier with pills (like dilly&#039;s) it took the fear of overdosing because I knew exactly how many mg&nbsp; I needed to get the rush I was looking for.&nbsp; But once again let me reiterate I suggest never banging anything ever.

				You check if you are in a vein or not by pulling back on the plunger when you think your in, if you see blood get pulled in it means your in a vein. If not, pull out and try again (you can use the same needle). When you pull back, if your in a vein the blood will come in easily and look like a crimson mushroom cloud. Usually when you miss a vein and pull back you arent able to pull anything in and the plunger pulls itself back in.<br /><br />Also when you inject, if you feel a burning sensation you are probably outside of the vein, unless you didnt let the alcohol dry!<br /><br />The onset will be within 30 seconds if you hit the vein and will peak quickly.<br /><br />I suggest bumping H instead of shooting it for a new user, you get a high bio availability and you get to enjoy those nice long nods before you get spoiled by shooting up.<br /><br />Also if you feel you are using too much, I have a great thread about how I quit H, search for &quot;opiate addiction miracle drug&quot;

I didn&#039;t get the rush I expected, aside from an already racing heart because I was really nervous. I gradually got high, it was nice like any opiate, but I&#039;m pretty disappointed. I&#039;m thinking I just missed the vein... Had a feeling that would happen too.<br /><br />Any tips for hitting the vein? I have been told I have good veins before. I didn&#039;t use a tourniquet or belt or anything, although I did try lifting some heavy stuff ahead of time. I really shouldn&#039;t need a tourniquet because I could see the vein bulging out pretty well. It was about in the center of my arm. I put the needle in at about a 30 degree angle and pushed it all the way in. I used swabs beforehand and a clean needle. Am I missing something here? Or just any tips?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am intrigued why you used a SR forum to ask this , there are loads of excellent sites on the open as well as this one for information, Have a look for <br />Harm Reduction Coalition<br />Exchange Supplies<br />Irish Needle Exchange Forum<br />Chicargo recovery Alliance<br />Some great sites in Canada too <br />Also have you smoked before or are you going straight into injecting , you want to ensure you are using the correct spike a 29G 1ml barrel for arms , make sure your well hydrated this will help keep your veins nice and raised for injecting . You need to go in a 45degree angle then bring it down to a 30 degree angle there is no need to go all the way in that will hurt and possibly&nbsp; mess up a vein make sure you ALWAYS rotate your sites too. The other important issue is to use a tester shot see what the purity is as there have been quite a few OD&#039;s recently in Europe from rogue batches , feel free to DM me if you want to
