				i ordered a few things at the beginning of the month. right around labor day SR got wonky. so i am still waiting for everything to come through. some ketamine, fishscale and m1 might seem like a wonky combo but thats what all i got alongside some so-so Moxy. i got needles and good filters for ketamine order but i forgot syringes so i figured i would lay down on some combo lines. <br />C+K=Calvin Klimb&#039;n no stop<br />i think ive gone through 120mg fishscale 150mgket, 250mg m1 and 5mg moxy. all that over the last 90 minutes split up by about 7 lines. this is some new territory.<br />didn&#039;t have this combo in mind but i feel like exploring.<br />ive read that ket is relatively safe and hard to od on. any other epic combos or comments?

				Whoa dude cool it with the &quot;epic combos&quot;<br />A mixture like that is a recipe for cardiac arrest or serotonin syndrome.<br />I honestly don&#039;t see the appeal of taking a stew of miscellaneous drugs and seeing what happens, sounds like a waste of money and a possible ER visit.<br />I never mix drugs, unless you consider taking a depressant (benzos typically) after using stims to help come down<br />I like to experience them for their own unique subtleties.<br />Hope you&#039;re okay dude, and be a bit less reckless with your next order...

				Disclaimer: I&#039;m not a doctor but have experience.<br /><br />Thats wasteful and dangerous. In the future avoid mixing coke with any of those. Separately the M1 with ketamine dose after should be safe. I wouldn&#039;t mix moxy and M1. Or Moxy and anything at all really. <br /><br />Curious. How old are you? Please be responsible. I&#039;m sure you&#039;d like to stick around for awhile and not end up in the hospital...of coffin.
