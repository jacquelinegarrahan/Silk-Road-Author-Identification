				I&#039;ve been doing some research on whether or not a low daily dose of NDRI, specifically pyrovalerone (to clarify, NOT MDPV) would interfere in any meaningful way with MDMA. I have a planned roll coming up in a couple weeks, and I&#039;ve already started pre-loading for it! I just acquired some pills containing 10mg pyrovalerone, and I was probably going to start taking 1 a day within the next week or so (for its stimulant/anoretic properties). I know that anti-depressants in general are known to decrease the effectiveness of a roll (and can be dangerous in the case of MAOIs), but what I&#039;ve read so far suggests that NDRIs interfere the least and should be safe.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really have much personal experience with anti-depressants, let alone NDRIs. I&#039;m not sure what the usual dose for someone taking one (like Wellbutrin, for example) would be, and further more, how extreme of an affect it would have on a roll. If 10mg a day would be enough to noticeably diminish my roll, I&#039;d rather delay starting them til after my event. Anyone have any first hand experience with this?

				i used to be on wellbutrin...i planned ahead of a roll once and stopped taking it for a month prior to the roll...despite not taking wellbutrin for a month i still noted a decrease in the usual physical euphoria of mdma...it simply just feel as good as it was supposed to and i know they were good pills cuz everyone around me took the same and they were rollin balls...

				Buproprion + MDMA = seizure. I dunno about pyrovalerone, but I would assume any NDRI would have the same risks as buproprion.<br /><br />MDMA does not mix with most pharmaceutical antidepressants because it is a triple releasing agent. Any releasing agent, when mixed with a reuptake inhibitor, is likely to cause flooding of neurotransmitters... which is risky. High doses of MDMA alone can cause serotonin syndrome because MDMA is not only a SRA but also a SRI. Wouldn&#039;t you know!<br /><br />edit - I may actually be wrong about MDMA acting as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, so go ahead and correct me if I am. I know it&#039;s a releasing agent and an agonist at the very least...
