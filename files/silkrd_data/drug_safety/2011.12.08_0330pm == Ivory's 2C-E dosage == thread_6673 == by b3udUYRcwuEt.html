				Hey folks,<br /><br />I ordered some 2C-E from Ivory, and am excited to try it as soon as it arrives.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m not sure about the dosage. Erowid says 15-30mg is a strong dose, but some people in other forums say, that they need 25mg to get open eye visuals.<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly experienced with LSD and Shrooms, so I would like to have a decent trip.<br /><br />What are your experiences with his 2C-E?

				Around 20-25mg seems to be the sweet spot. Much more and you start hitting a body load wall--but it can be managed. I would definitively stick to around 17-23 and push it up slowly if you think you can handle the body load. <br /><br />I warn you that it&#039;s quite powerful at doses 25 and above--but you&#039;ll not suffer physical harm. It can be very uncomfortable up around 30-45--mentally and especially physically.

				Thank you very much, I think I&#039;ll start with 20mg and maybe work my way up with the next times.

				I purchased two vials from davidd, each with 15mg of 2c-e.<br /><br />I was thinking the same, if 15mg would be give only threshold effects......&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I&#039;ll have to try it myself.<br /><br />

				On a related note, when i first got 2-CE, I accidentally took 100mg, thinking it was 10mg... im bad at math and was stoned, and read my scale wrong... not recommended. that was a wild ride... only time ive ever been legitimately scared that I might die, but obviously im still here kickin&#039; hahaha

				I&#039;ve had a pretty intense trip off 12 mg. Best advice is start low, as you can always take more, you can&#039;t very well take less. There is a lot of variance in dose response for 2C&#039;s, one person could take double the dose of another and experience the same intensity of effects.

				I also suspect the purity of 2C-E going around is variable, always good to start low with a new batch

				I would say insulfating 15mg would be a good start - I have never taken it orally so I an unsure about dosages for that

				So here is my short review of Ivory&#039;s 2C-E:<br /><br />My roommate and I each took 18mg last Saturday. After an hour, I felt huge energy flows through my body, and we both were extremely euphoric and restless. My roommate had open eye visuals similar to LSD, I personally only had very very light open eye visuals, although the closed eye visuals were not bad. After two hours, we both took another 6mg, which did intensify the experience. Music (especially Psy-Trance) was very intensive to hear, but I sadly didn&#039;t get more visuals. Compared to LSD there was absolutely no mind-fucking, only very good feelings. Next time I&#039;ll try this at a party.
