				Agree with the above post. If i don&#039;t take enough, I feel edgy and anxious. It&#039;s like the mind is still trying to control the experience and it doesn&#039;t feel good.

				yep, small doses are no good. mdma is a wonderful drug, but has it&#039;s limitations..<br />Rectal administration is relatively common for mdma. That way it hits harder and faster, and you need smaller dose (~2/3rds of what you would normally take). Google for more info on how to properly do this (bluelight forums are notorious for booty-bumpers) ;)

				Here&#039;s my thoughts:<br /><br />Taking MDMA is like taking alcohol. If you take a bit of booze you get tipsy, feeling tipsy is not the same as feeling drunk, obviously. Taking MDMA in a small quantity (enough to make you &quot;tipsy&quot;) will make you tipsy on MDMA but will not feel the same as rolling fully off of a full pill or however many you normally take.<br /><br />The Godfather

				I dont mean to contradict the whole thread- I usually take smaller doses like if Im not going to &quot;rage&quot; and what not.&nbsp; Ill take a few dips- and I dont necessarily feel like Im rolling but i feel awake and a bit giddy.&nbsp; This could all be a placebo effect, but most times I dont want to roll my face off and just need to get out of my world and talk to people, so i mean what the dude said about being tipsy i would agree, different feel, i wouldnt say its a roll, but its something for those relaxing evenings at the bar chatting with people about music and shit

				I&#039;d say always go for 125-180mg for a strong roll. You gauge where to dose within that range based on your weight, your pre/post loading routine (if any), and your tolerance, beit natural or built over recent use. The extremes for either direction would be 80mg-(this would be very light, but for a first timer not a bad way to start if nervous and the product is very high quality). 220mg for the high end. Note: 220mg is DANGEROUS. If you are not well above average weight and tolerance you will most likely vomit and be FLOORED if the product is pure, as most is on the market right now, especially US domestic vendors.

				Ahahaha.&nbsp; Boofing, such a goofy word.&nbsp; It reminds me of the most recent concert I went to, where a group of me and my friends all rolled on some caps of molly.&nbsp; We had been joking around about rectal administration earlier, and as it started to come on strongly, one guy was like, &quot;Damn, this shit is good.&nbsp; I&#039;m so glad I boofed mine!&quot;&nbsp; Then another guy chimed in, agreeing, and the first guy just burst out laughing, saying that he was totally joking.&nbsp; We all just about fell over laughing.&nbsp; Good times.

				OP, I don&#039;t think you should take a small amount of MDMA. Go for at least 100mg or just do a different drug for the night (benzos, alcohol, amphetamine)

				I find 80mg to 100mg is enough to get me gripping the sofa before I level out to be able to go out.<br /><br />I found using around 40-50mg had an adverse effect on me. I felt a bit uneasy - my stomach felt off and I did not feel social. This was with Ivorys top class MDMA - others have top class but Ivory is a yardstick by which I measure all others.<br /><br />Never enjoyed the 50mg but still had the aftereffects as if I had taken 100mg. Had the usual comedown 24 hr later as serotonin levels deplete and need time to restore so that 50mg actually ruins the chance of a good roll in the next few weeks!!<br /><br />Total waste of good MDMA. Another 50mg or 30mg and I would have enjoyed it immensely. I was blown away by 100mg.<br /><br />Hey! Some might be fine with low doses. My experience as a very occasional user of E is that low doses work in reverse for me. I feel uncomfortable slightly. I feel the physical effects on stomach but no euphoria. I ended up drinking 2 cans and smoking top hash and was in bed by 11.00pm on a Friday night. Hardly rock and roll!<br /><br />May work for some but I think its all or nothing. That said the &#039;all&#039; can also mean a redose to extend the MDMA experience. So far I have not needed to do this but an all night party I might.<br /><br />good luck.
