				A friend of mine bought some xanax off SR a few weeks ago.&nbsp; It arrived, but it didn&#039;t look like any benzo pill I&#039;d seen before.&nbsp; I searched the drugs.com database and some other pill identifiers and came up empty. <br /><br />It is round, and either orange or pink, unfortunately we are both colorblind so we can&#039;t agree on which it is most likely to be.<br /><br />On one side it has &quot;mf&quot; imprinted.&nbsp; On the other, it has a somewhat deep divider to break the pill into quarters(kinda looks like a 4 point star)<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp; The only pills I could find that were imprinted with &quot;mf&quot; was metformin, however none of the pills listed look anything like this one.<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember the name of the vendor as I didn&#039;t handle any part of the transaction.&nbsp; The person that did is out of contact for the next week.

				I&#039;ve bought xanayys off of my buddies that have pressed their own pills. I never see it too much out in the street anymore, always alprazolam pills.. but I&#039;ve read about big brother making big busts on those bad men that make their own knockoff/not safe home pressed pills that have random designs!! good thing we have the FDA looking out for our best interests and keeping random pressed pills off the street so we take the stuff that&#039;s been approved ;) <br /><br />sounds like another generic homemade benzo<br /><br />

				You&#039;re probably not going to find it. Does it feel like xanax?

				Yeah, its xanax.&nbsp; Crushed up a pill and stuck it under my tongue.&nbsp; Effects started about T 0:20, I&#039;ve had no experience with xanax, but have taken medazolam a bit.<br /><br />I managed to find some obscure reference to a pharmacy in the USA making pills which fit this criteria, 0.5mg alprazolam so I&#039;m happy with that result.

				I suppose posting a picture of that tablet would have been much more useful though. Even if you are colorblind, your camera probably is not. <br /><br />Xanax tablets are often produced as pink tablets, especially 0.5 mg doses. They are usually oval, not round though, since that resembles the pfizer brand product best.
