				I&#039;ve only done Ice years ago and I was already wasted so I can&#039;t really remember how much I smoked.<br />Just wondering how much do you need for a night out?<br />It seems to be expensive - I always thought it was meant to be cheaper than coke?<br />

				A lot of vendors only seem to sell 0.1 grams - surely this is not enough?

				Sorry, posted the wrong link before.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/meth/meth_dose.shtml<br /><br />Yes, .1 would be a strong dose.

				If you&#039;re a loner, 0.1 of a g will be fine. If you enjoy sitting round with a friend or two and talking shit until 3 days has gone by and you missed the night out completely, Id go for a couple of g&#039;s ;D

				For someone who does not use regularly like yourself, 0.1 g is enough for several nights out, if your keeping it to yourself.<br />10-15 mg should be plenty (snorted). If you don&#039;t have a mg scale, this would be be a pile of powder smaller than a match head. <br />Start small. You may or may not feel the need to redose. If you redose, again 10-15 mg (match head size pile of crushed powder or smaller).<br /><br />Do not consume 0.1 g all at once. I use frequently, often daily, and would never even think of taking that much at once. I&#039;ve rarely needed to even approach that amount in a single day. More like 50-60 mg or less on average during periods of heavier use.<br /><br />You&#039;ll see people reporting high doses all over here, but these these are frequent/heavy users. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never failed to get off for the night from a matchhead size bump or two. Any more and you&#039;re probably gonna have a bad time honestly.<br />:)

				I would definitely not recommend only buying 0.1g of meth for a night, but maybe that&#039;s enough for some people. I&#039;d buy at least a quarter(0.25g) just to make sure you have enough, in case the quality isn&#039;t completely excellent.

People tend to use more when they smoke since the duration is shorter than snorting or oral. I&#039;ve seen people on average go through a point to a quarter gram in night. I&#039;ve found that to be on the regular side. Take it slow as possible. Set the pipe, or foil down after your hit and wait a few minutes and see where you&#039;re at. Smoking in my opinion is smoother than snorting and this can lead to wreck less redosing. Also, make sure to bust the shards into fine powder. This makes it easier to eyeball and helps with even heat distribution. Good luck.

				Recently I divided a 50mg sample (free meth!) into 10mg capsules.. I usually took one about 9am than another 1pm after lunch. 20mg got me a seriously productive day.

				I&#039;m finding less = more with meth...it doesn&#039;t take much to get you in a good mood, or productive.&nbsp; The most I&#039;ve done was a point in 4 hrs (snorted) and all that was different about the high was I had a headache, I didn&#039;t feel more &quot;intense&quot; euphoria, or more confident, just more negative effects on top of the nice clean high I get at lower doses.&nbsp; 20-30mg and a re-up after an hour or two is all I need for several hours of feeling perfect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any more than that and I get serious depression for days after, and not for any noticably &quot;better&quot; effects during the high.&nbsp; I guess I don&#039;t enjoy the feeling of being spun, I just like meth for the motivation and confidence boost, so to me a point would last me a month or two at least.
