				Superior salutations and blue skies to yall!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />just some dum nab here with a possibly useless n futile meth-fueled spammy text including a question I felt like burdening those who don&#039;t mind with, while Im a bit bored awaiting sunny days, incase theres some point in it....&nbsp; sry in advance for possible bad english/typos n such, or if I posted wrong, offended anyone or whatever...feel free to delete/move it then I guess=|&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />I am about to dose some of what I think/hope is MDMA within an hour or so, and while I will prolly try it anyway as the vendor is a big apparently trusted seller and has pretty much only shiny positive reviews, it does look a bit different from all my previous times using it and along with 1 user here planting doubt, I got a bit unsure and just wanted some input if anyone had any idea, if its possible to say anything more with the little info I can give.<br /><br />Unfortunately I do not have any test kit and understand it&#039;s impossible to say for sure just judging by look and the subjective experience from a newb like me (also I just smoked some Methamphetamine that I will continue with thru the night which may impact the buzz thus further complicating a comparison with previous assumed MDMA experiences), but wanted to ask anyway incase its really all that unusual. Or maybe its just a coincidence when I&#039;ve gotten different looking product every time in the past..<br /><br />Just lil info on my order experience at the same time, scroll past&nbsp; the part within &quot;----- ... &quot;&nbsp; for my actual question about the appearance of this supposed MDMA :)<br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I&#039;ll start with sum additional details regarding the order for those who may search the vendor, have similar experience,questions or anything and find this post.. <br />I just got mail few days ago that I got my hands on like 30min ago. I had ordered 3.5G of MDMA from Technohippy and it&#039;s my first time with this vendor. <br />Everything seems very smooth with the order in every way. It took about a week to arrive in Norway. Stealth was excellent, and I guess it could be that customs or nosy spouses wouldn&#039;t detect anything worthy of suspicion even if they opened it and had a quick look. The product was also packaged in several layers and appeared to be air-less (vacuumed).<br /><br />I have ordered MDMA on SR in the past in total prolly like 10+ times, most from different vendors of which many aren&#039;t even around anymore (since like 2+ years ago in the start here, and prolly been thru most of the top/popular vendors selling MDMA at the times I ordered..),&nbsp; so I think Ive seen many different types of the MDMA that has been around, and usually its either very small crystal bits and powder that is white/milky, or have a lil brown on them that I assume is residual sassafras oil or other contaminant, and those with a brownish tint also often smelled chemically-licorice-kinda which I&#039;ve come to believe may be a good sign of legitimacy (indicating sassafras traces which would only (?) be used in MDMA synthesis).. <br /><br />Id also like to add a note that for a long time and who is still around, the vendors Juergen2001 and 3Jane has seemed very solid and never been a fail.&nbsp; Also 3jane&#039;s attitude/philosophy is imo worthy of loyalty and support really! However for different reasons, and at times that I wouldn&#039;t mind a fkup too much, with the chance of new somewhat trusted connects, I still some times choose different vendors to try..<br /><br /><br />I just got a bit unsure about this supposed MDMA I just got now, because I searched this vendors name on this forum and found a recent post from another user saying he&#039;s sure that its Not MDMA he received, but possibly Methylone, DXM or something, and suggests they may occasional selectively send bad/wrong product or such ..&nbsp; &nbsp;although he met some resistance with his claims, and others replying had good words about the vendor. <br />The user &#039;neuronirvana&#039; made the thread in question: &quot;methylone sold as MDMA (stuff tested: DXM)&quot; ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209533.msg1535493#msg1535493 )<br />In short he claims to be sure its not MDMA with which he has extensive experience, and that he tested it and results indicated presence of DXM (!), but many other users refute the claim of the vendor sending bad stuff, so it&#039;s really word against word.&nbsp; <br /><br />The vendor Technohippy seems to have a great reputation and I couldn&#039;t really find anything else really bad about him so I&#039;d think it&#039;d be fair to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he&#039;s legit and certain when asserting the legitimacy of the stuff.&nbsp; <br />All his feeback ( I checked atleast 20 recent feedback-pages of his, nothing but praise and good words.. ) aswell as the vendors forum posts and others posts with his name in it..<br /><br />But... just wanted to ask here anyway, because it indeed looks very different (albeit awesome-looking =D) maybe others were in similar situations and had a slight doubt or could clarify, cos as said I have no test kits to say for sure and are not very experienced with MDMA and the potential different looks it may have.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Now..... this supposed MDMA consists of pretty large crystal chunks mostly, the biggest bits are prolly like the size of a pea or bit larger (btw hehe, one pretty large crystal is even perfectly heart-shaped, lol, fits well for MDMA eh.. maybe Ill save that one for fun:P) , and it&#039;s pretty much completely transparent/clear and imo looks very much like meth crystals.. Most of it are big crystals like that, and imo I&#039;d guess it was crushed to fit into the bag and originates from a much larger crystal.<br />I have never seen such large bits of crystal MDMA before, and Iv also never seen MDMA being as clear/transparent (see-thru, almost like glass) as this..&nbsp; and I think Ive read in the past that high-purity MDMA should be in tiny crystal bits and will not be clear/transparent,&nbsp; but rather white/milky-like... <br />and that other compounds like methylone/bk-mdma and possibly others could appear like this.. along with the post from that user mentioned above within the ---&#039;d paragraph and that Ive never seen it as good-looking like this, I just thought I&#039;d ask here,&nbsp; if others have experience with verified MDMA being such big chunks that seems transparent.&nbsp; or even if any other recent customers of his could chime in or had same concerns..<br /><br /><br />anyway Imma just chomp down on some foodz now before possibly crunching like 100mg of these amazing-looking crystals between my teeth followed by some juice and some more puffs of the ever-incredible methamphetamine so Im sure I&#039;ll notice some of the effect atleast and would be able to tell more afterwards.. I feel pretty sure it&#039;s gonna be a good time no matter if its not actually MDMA or only partly anyway =D&nbsp; &nbsp; and really I guess it could be MDMA, atleast judging by all the good feedback this vendor has and all..&nbsp; just that Im not used to this good-looking stuff, I dno..<br /><br />uh, sry I guess meth had something to do with this post and this ample block of text =P<br /><br />consider it a combined vendor-review and inquiry concerning the (to me) unusual appearance of this supposed MDMA.<br />All excellent so far just thought Id ask here justincase or for whatever reason, and for sake of others. =)<br /><br /><br />cheers, take care n have a good one !&nbsp; :D ;)
