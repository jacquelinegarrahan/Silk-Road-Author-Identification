				Last night was the 2nd night this week where i&#039;ve rolled an&nbsp; MDMA capsule.<br />Took a while to start feeling it, then the high lasted about 2 hours followed by a bad comedown. Went from being on top of the world to depressed. Wanted to stop dancing, didn&#039;t want to interact and eventually i just left the club and felt pretty sad.<br />I didn&#039;t think MDMA was meant to have a negative comedown. Also, I basically fell asleep straight away. What would it have been laced with?<br />Is post MDMA depression common?

				It&#039;s very common especially with overuse as you did.<br /><br />2 rolls in one week is not so much of an abuse but most sensible users space out their rolls at least one month from each one.<br /><br />And since you already rolled twice in one week, your serotonin levels in your brain are pretty much down. You should wait for it to replenish itself in which good diet and some supplements help.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest you look&nbsp; more on the serotonin&#039;s work on the brain, how it&#039;s affected by mdma and check some of the pre/post loading guides they exists even some threads down here.<br /><br />What you feel is totally normal, so don&#039;t worry about it but next time make your research.

				Yes an MDMA comedown is very normal.. <br />Taking MDMA twice in a week is also considered a lot. It&#039;s best to leave it 2/3 months between rolls to allow your serotonin to recover properly. <br /><br />Do some research on sites like erowid and bluelight, even on these forums you&#039;ll find a lot of information on the subject.

				If you have access to some celexa or something in small amounts that would help nicely.

				Definitely limit your rolls to at least 1 month apart, but 2-3 is best.&nbsp; <br /><br />Taking 5-htp supplements for a few days after rolling helps combat your depression.<br /><br />Smoking weed may help for some people, but it does depend.

That&#039;s called a comedown. Doesn&#039;t even sound like a bad one. The idea that you think you can roll twice in a week and not suffer negative side-effects is depressing/ludicrous/hilarious. Even basic research would have shown you that everyone recommends to wait at least a month between rolls, preferably three, to avoid damage and unpleasant after-effects.

Some people always get an horrid comedown / aftereffects from MDMA. Some people feel little/no comedown or aftereffects. Really basic information after all and widely available.

				Please don&#039;t roll twice in one week! From what I&#039;ve read, rolling once a month is good. Waiting three months is the best option.

All it would take to figure out he fucked up is a simple Google search of MDMA, seriously he should have just read the basics of MDMA on Erowid before even thinking of taking it in the first place. It takes no less than five minutes to educate yourself. He should not be taking drugs at all, it&#039;s always a dumbass like this jerk that ends up on the news and gives drugs a bad rep. I see no reason to encourage this member to stay here, he is cancer.
