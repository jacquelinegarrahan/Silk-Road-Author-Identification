				Hi everyone.<br /><br />Basically i wanted to ask what the title says: whats the best pill (to take daily) for anxiety?<br />I&#039;ve heard awesome things about mirtazapine, but i also heard that it keep you zombified for most part of the day : P.<br />I&#039;ve tried xanax several times, but i don&#039;t see me taking it daily. It turns me sleepy.. calmed but sleepy, so i wanted to see if theres any other alternatives out there.<br /><br />Thanks.

				First, you should talk to your doctor.&nbsp; This way, you get much cheaper pills than you will find here. . .&nbsp; a pill a day from here will cost a fortune.<br /><br />Second, there are many Benzos to choose from.&nbsp; Ativan is most prescribed for anxiety.&nbsp; Next would be valium.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, there are a few antipsycotic meds that work wonders on anxiety such as zyprexa and abilify.&nbsp; These wont make you sleepy or tired, but they have more side effects.<br /><br />Xanax is basically a recreational drug.&nbsp; It gets people doped up and nodding off.&nbsp; It also causes withdrawal symptoms as any Benzo does from prolong use.<br /><br />Its usually pretty easy to score anxiety meds from a doctor.&nbsp; If you have a drug plan, its free or close to it.

				i would advise against taking benzos daily except as a last-ditch effort. they are very prone to causing physical dependence and the withdrawals are comparable to alcohol withdrawals if it gets to that point. definitely not good to take long-term. there are many safer alternatives that are more suitable for daily use, such as kava and kratom. i would recommend either of those for anxiety. cannabis can also be used to treat anxiety, provided it doesn&#039;t make it worse. ghb is another good alternative, provided it&#039;s quality powder and not gbl. i would even suggest trying low doses of ketamine or methoxetamine before going down the benzo route. of course everyone&#039;s chemistry is different and not everyone is prone to addiction, but better safe than sorry!

				benzodiazapenes are the most effective against anxiety but their other qualities mean they are not ideal for long term usage.<br /><br />personally I find clonazepam better than alprazolam for semi-regular usage, but it&#039;s more like a couple times a week not everyday<br /><br />you could also think about propranolol<br /><br />mirtazapine can work for anxiety but it&#039;s better for depression in many people<br /><br />lastly, I agree with the poster above that the best idea is to talk to a doctor if you&#039;re looking for a longterm rather than a recreational solution<br /><br />&nbsp;be easy 8)

				Is there a reason you can&#039;t see a doctor. If you are looking for a non benzo route you shouldn&#039;t have a problem getting a script. Not to mention its a hell of a lot cheaper. Just go to any public MH clinic. Nearly all have a sliding scale fee. I am not a fan of these clinics but if you are just looking for meds its adequate.<br /><br />I hate to say it but most of the non benzos like anti-depressant, anti-psychotic meds and the like have nasty side effects and are very toxic to your body especially your liver and kidneys.<br /><br />IMHO benzos really are the better meds for anxiety with fewer negative effects at therapeutic not recreational doses. Just wouldn&#039;t recommend using it everyday and only take the least you need as they are very addictive and with long term use tolerance is also an issue. That&#039;s their major down side. Have you tried lower doses like .25 or .05 which is the typical starting dose for Xanax.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know anxiety can be very disabling so I sympathize. <br /><br />Exercise, diet, meditation, etc can help a lot with anxiety. In the long run will help you a lot more with anxiety in the long run than meds.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yes, ive tried 0.5 xanax tabs... but still, its a bet meh.. i dont feel talkative and sometimes i get awful nighnamares and even semi-sleep paralysis (i awake suddenly, but then i can sleep normaly, but still, its a pain in the ass).<br /><br />As for exercise, i run 1-2 times a week. Is one of those things that i really enjoy.<br /><br />Ive listened that GHB works for all the talkative and social thing.. What do you guys think? (and yea, before you say it, i know that OD on this drug might be pretty bad).

				Diazepam is very effective, but only in the short-term. Tolerance is built up very quickly. And it&#039;s addictive.<br /><br />BUT, occasional use of Diazepam for anxiety is it&nbsp; my opinion, very effective.

				I&#039;m probably a weird drug user but i totally disagree with doctors using any kind of benzo on a daily basis to threat anything but totally disableling anxieties. And even then there&#039;s other imo better options like seroquel.<br />Benzo dont solve anything, you&#039;ll end up needing ever higher doses, completely addicted and your anxieties still present but numbed. In the long run, especially if you ever want to stop, they&#039;ll get worse.<br />Stopping itself after prolongued use is dangerous, it can be even deadly when you dont ween down step by step. Using these long term without consulting a doctor is a 1 way street to trouble.<br />I like a benzo sporadicly as recreation, but i think its a bad medicine that gets prescribed WAY to easy. From what ive seen it never helped anyone in the long run.<br />Anxieties are better treated with therapy and if you insist on medication, which after using them myself would avoid if possible, try an AD&#039;s .<br />I&#039;m currently on effexor and a lowest dose of amisulpride (solian), the AD&#039;s did little to aid the anxiety but helped with a depression. The amisulpride turned out to be a wonderdrug for me, i get commented on how ive blosemed open since starting it.<br />It doesnt work on the serotonine like most AD&#039;s but on the dopamine system<br />If you live in the USA you wont be able to find any, its not FDA approved i read somewhere, but it is used in most european countries. For me this is the best drug for anxieties (i had social anxiety)

				Klonipin is more mild than Xanax to some people and does usually last longer.<br /><br />It would help if people had a better sense of what your anxiety is like in severity. I am assuming you are talking about a debilitating anxiety. Or is it more of a hyperish manic episode. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about GHB. That makes me a bit nervous for you. I don&#039;t know anything about it other than what it is and the possible dangers. I won&#039;t tell anyone not to do something but please make sure you know what you are doing first and be safe.

				Seroquel is problematic because of weight gain issues, plus it can fuck with your head in other ways.&nbsp; Mirtazapine is a horrible choice.&nbsp; US doctors don&#039;t use it in doses high enough to affect mood, the way many European doctors do out of fear of triggering seratonin syndrome.&nbsp; Benzos are great, but like so many have already said, they&#039;re for the short term.&nbsp; The body builds up a tolerance, so you have to take higher doses.&nbsp; And, they&#039;re habit-forming, so now you&#039;re addicted to the 6mg of Klonopin a day, and now you&#039;ve built up a tolerance to that, and oh, by the way, the original problem is still there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m really just underlining all the great advice you&#039;ve gotten so far in this thread.&nbsp; Non-benzo anti-anxiety medication is easy to come by, and so are the doctors who prescribe them.&nbsp; Your doctor can also help you find a group of people who are dealing with the same issues you are.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s even more helpful to get advice from people you can look in the eye as people you can chat with in a forum.
