				Hey fellow trippers ;), <br /><br />I&#039;m an acid lover who read about those mythic thumbprints. Now, i&#039;ve done about 10-15 times acid in my life, and the highest doses I&#039;ve taken were in the 400 mics range. <br /><br />However, crystal / liquid LSD is impossible to find. So, I&#039;m wondering if you fine people know the effect of eating 20 hits of acid at once are the same? Anyone here ever took a thumbprint? My main worry is that blotter paper could contain impurities/ not very clean LSD, wondering how this will affect the trip.<br /><br />Thanks for the help guys!<br /><br />PS: I&#039;m keeping about 100 mgs of Diazepam on the side for trouble ;)<br /><br />

				I think your off just a tad if you think 20 hits will be anywhere near a thumbprint! Try more like 1000 hits! ;D

				a thumbprint is nothing compared to eating tabs.<br /><br />1gram of crystal = 10,000 tabs (very good tabs)<br />Lets say you stuck your finger into .1 grams, 1,000 tabs worth<br /><br />eating 1,000 tabs would be LESS potent and LESS intense than eating the .1 grams of crystal as is. Not to say 1,000 tabs would be weak by any means. Just explaining to you how crystal is more potent than the tabs will ever be.<br /><br /><br />So you can eat as many tabs as you want but your never gonna thumbprint unless you actually have crystal in your presence.<br /><br />Also, Liquid LSD is really no diffrent than eating tabs. I&#039;m not sure why you put crysal lsd and liquid lsd in the same category. You drop the liquid&nbsp; onto the tabs.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be so quick to eat 20 tabs if i were you tho, if 400 mics is your highest, try 8 hits of tony&#039;s 100mic acid. then work your way up slowly. I hit around 800 once and it was beyond what i expected. i didnt even plan on trying to trip that hard.

				Keep in mind that 20 hits of weak blotter could be the same as 2-6 hits of strong blotter. It all depends on how many micrograms each blotter is dosed with, which you&#039;re never really gonna know unless you&#039;re close to the source and/or extremely familiar with the batch.

				Hey guys, thanks for the info! Seems I underestimated the thumbprint a lot, lol! Round here you only find blotter paper, tested at around 80 mics a piece. I usually take 3 or 4 :)<br /><br />10 hits would be 800 mics...maybe in the weekend ;)<br /><br />Peace
