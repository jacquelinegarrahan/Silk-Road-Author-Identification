				I ordered a gram from sesampino which arrived today.<br /><br />Started sniffing after work around 17:00. It&#039;s now around 21:30 and I&#039;m done. So 4.5 hours for me.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been drinking or using any other drugs.<br /><br />Also haven&#039;t done coke in years either as no one in my circles nowadays use drugs. <br /><br />Sniffed surfing around on my computer surfing the internet. This time about average for everyone else too if you power through it alone?

				if it&#039;s good quality gear, a gram will last me and the misses the night, however, as Lim mentioned, you can can bosh the lot in a couple of hours!! - I&#039;d do 50mg bumps.. Nice amounts... You could double or treble that for a rollercoaster ride though! Enjoy!! :D

				As said, it totally depends. You did just fine it sounds normal :-) If I bought 1g on SR, I&#039;d probably aim to bosh through &lt; 0.5g, and keep 0.5g for my next night out, but perhaps I&#039;d do the whole 1g and order another 1g for the next night out instead. Depending on how good it was going down. Did you plan to do the whole lot at your computer? Or was it just too fucking good to put down? :-)<br /><br />Last time I bought 3.5g while out pub &gt; club. Usual shitty street lidocaine no doubt, but it had a little buzz to it. :-) I did way over a gram in 4 hours.<br />

Also no one I know uses even marijuana so I didn&#039;t really have much choice. <br /><br />Reassuring is that this coke from sesampino is of a quality I got back in the day, which makes me feel better than I wasn&#039;t getting ripped when i was younger. But I used to pay 60/G not 120...<br /><br />Also ordered one from pfand, hopefully get to try it before going on vacation. But his shipping time is slow. Sesampino really has a rigid system and great customer service. Gets those packs out quick.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth sesampinos doesn&#039;t feel cut with speed at least so hopefully sleep wont be a problem after polishing off this bottle of wine.

				The coke I get in real life is probably no more than 40% pure (seriously) so i&#039;d rip through a gram in a couple of hours!<br /><br />Have a gram on the way from GlobalCocaine and i&#039;m very excited about trying it! I will keep you informed on the quality of that gear :)

				Coke was absolutely one of the worst experiences of my life while i was doing it, I kept chasing my high meaning I would do a couple lines and start feeling the high come on and think i was getting high enough and immediatly do two bigger ones, it got so bad i could blow through a ball in about 4-6hrs by myself (i&#039;m not kidding iwas terrible and its a miracle my heart didn;t explode) then it gave me the worst come down it was really a came down as much as a crash off the top of the grand canyon and if i didn&#039;t have a few pills of vicodine or hydrocodone and some alcohol it was literally unbearable.&nbsp; I have plenty of friends who love coke can do it and make it last and then go straight to bed when their done and feel fine, but for whatever reason that shit just is the devil to me. and to asnwer your question how long would it take for me to go through a gram, about the length of time it took me to take it out of the bag, chop it up fine and snort it all, I know pathetic.&nbsp; Coke for me is like paying for suicidal depression so I haven&#039;t touched the stuff&nbsp; for 5 years and never will again, plus&nbsp; i hear it keeps getting walked on more and more and its harder and harder to find the good stuff

				Also it depends how you use Rip in general. I use it to relax on after I finish work, others use it more occasionally.

				A close friend of mine died several years ago ripping through a gram. She was close to 100lbs. It&#039;s unclear how long the gram lasted her. It could have been due to a pre-existing heart condition, I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />It takes me usually two weekends to get through a gram. 0.5 one time, 0.5 another. <br /><br />Crack is way different though. I know I&#039;ll smoke until I run out because that happens 100% of the time.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;
