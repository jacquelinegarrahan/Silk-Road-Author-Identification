				So I am now in possession of a 20mg Opana, crushable formula. Ive done a ton of research on this stuff because I heard its easy to OD and it will be my first opiate (Yes I&#039;m aware its a bad choice for my first opiate, no need to point that out). I intend to sniff it, but I was wondering exactly how I would go about doing that.<br /><br />It has a green layer over top of it and I remember reading that you should take off this layer. How would I go about doing that? The pill is so freaking small, I do have razor blades but I have a feeling that I will mistakingly cut off a lot of the powder underneath the coating if I try that, the thing is smaller then my pinky nail!<br /><br />I also read the dosage for nasal dosing is VERY small, so I think I will have to cut the pill into six parts and maybe do a small 3-4mg bump. I DO have a milligram scale so that isn&#039;t a huge issue, I&#039;m just not sure how much of the full pill to do for a first time. I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable doing over half the pill due to OD risks and the fact that I have ZERO tolerance.<br /><br />Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!

				Well I sniffed 3mg and ended up nodding off for a few hours. Total experience lasted about 5 hours before I felt pretty normal again.<br /><br />To be honest, I was expecting something completely different. Everything I read was people raving about the euphoria and how amazing you felt. It was my first opiate so I suppose I have nothing to compare it to, but definitely not what I was expecting. I did feel good as soon as I went to lay down and I didn&#039;t want to get back up again because of how nice it was to just lay there, but no mind-blowing euphoria :P<br /><br />My arms are also sore as fuck from working out the other day (To the point where I cant straighten them AT ALL), and even when I was peaking the pain was still there (less so, I could move my arms more without as much pain but it was still prominent)<br /><br />Well, guess opiates aren&#039;t for me lol. I do have like 3/4 of this pill left though, is it OK to sniff the crushable coating? Its pretty much mixed into the powder now ;D

				I think you just just up the dosage if you didn&#039;t feel euphoric enough :P If it didn&#039;t comletely removed the pain from sore arms then the dose was low... I&#039;d double the dosage, 6mg is a lot of oxymorphone but only a portion of it gets absorbed when you snort an ER because of the time-release mechanism. You could maybe snort half a pill but I&#039;d do 5mg and wait until it peaks before redosing.
