				Hey guys,<br />I know that long-acting benzos like Valium can be stored in fat cells for many weeks and there is not much that can be done about that. But I&#039;m wondering if there are any techniques to help flush your system of benzo evidence prior to a urine drug test.<br />I asked my local pharmacist and he suggested flushing out my bladder with Ural (a cranberry drink) but that&#039;s all he could suggest.<br />Does anyone on here have experience in speeding up the elimination of benzos and their metabolites from urine so they are below the detection threshold of standard urine tests? Any suggestions would be great.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Blue Machine <br /><br />PS. If I am drug tested the urine test will be performed under the watchful eye of the tester so there is no opportunity to tamper with the specimen.

				Iv had this issue a few times, I was on Parole for a while and had to deal with this.. Listen go to the drug store and Buy a urinary track Medicine called &#039;Azeos&#039;Maximum Strengh&#039; I may have spelled it wrong but its close enough.. There little burgundy pills and about $9 bucks a box, Take 2 or 3 drink plenty of water and when you start pissing its gonna be Almost a Orange color then as you continue to piss through out the day it will go to fully clear. Do that a few days before you go in and maybe the day before also and it should clean you out pretty good, Iv never failed a drug Test and iv been off and on probation and parole for 7 years.. JUST REMEMBER MAXIMUM STRENGH! NOT the other kinds they have like &#039;Azeo cranberry&#039; Also just drink alot of water or Kool Aid.&nbsp;

				You&#039;re fucked unless you plan on stopping taking them, and if so hopefully you aren&#039;t addicted. <br /><br />Simple advice:<br /><br />Switch to etizolam for like a week or pick up some phenobarbital or something in case you are addicted and if so hopefully don&#039;t have a seizure. I don&#039;t think they test for barbituates. <br /><br />Etizolam does not come back posititve as a benzo. I&#039;ve been told this by several friends and have done it myself.

Kinda related to Zyprexa and feels like an anti-depressant mixed with Ambien and Diazepam. Phenobarbital would prevent a seizure likely but I&#039;m unsure if they test for it.<br /><br />

				Thanks for all the replies.<br />I&#039;d really like to try the Azo option but I can&#039;t find anyone in Australia selling this product (or any other brand with the active ingredient).<br />Are there any Aussies reading this thread that have come across Azo products?<br />AnonymousAddict - is there any chance I could buy some from you if I can&#039;t find it in Australia?

				The only advice he gave you is basically a urinary tract infection treatment. That&#039;s not going to mask benzodiazepines. You need to stop taking benzos. If you have metabolites in your piss/body, you&#039;re going to fail for benzos. Period. Diluting your piss by drinking a bunch of water, and taking vitamins to stain your piss is for weed and sort of works if you&#039;re a casual smoker.

				It doesnt Mask The benzos but it helps clean your piss Long enuff to take the test and clear it.. Like i said iv done it off and on for years and was on probation for some time, Then Paroled.. It does work if you take the time to clean your self out, Not dilute it.. BTW OP I dont know if AUS has them or not im from the USA..I would have no clue where to look for them for u except online clearnet sites.. Its not a persription , I Use to just walk in and buy them by the Box here... Im sure there on a Clearnet site somewhere.

				If you&#039;re taking diazepam it has a very long half life so you&#039;re boned unless you either stop taking it, switch to Xanax and skip a day or two, or take something untested. They would test for phenobarbital in Australia as I believe it&#039;s still used around there in Asia and whatnot. <br /><br />

				Aren&#039;t there little bottles of solution that you can drink an hour before a drug test? It strips it from your system and you pass. Works for the boyfriend every time.<br />They&#039;re sold at head shops. They&#039;re also online...<br />Not sure of the name though....they make a shampoo too!!

				Ok first of all not sure how long you have been taking the Benzos stopping them suddenly your at risk of Benzo seizures , most drug kits will show up Benzos. The only thing in your favour is that its a urine test. I have heard of people using Milk Thistle , however this is not a 100% guarantee , its dependent on how long you have been using them for and how many your taking a day, if its a couple a day you are in with a chance.

				I tend to go on benzo binges for a few weeks and since finding the lovely SR, this particular binge is a big one...Xanax, Klonopin, Zolpidem, Zolpiclone, Temazepam (plus my daily Venlafaxine). <br />I&#039;ve come across several suggestions to beat the urine test (which is most important) but not necessarily eliminate the metabolites from my body (not a big problem).<br />Have any of you guys had experience with this website:<br /><br />http://www.passmydrugtest.com/benzo-detox.htm<br /><br />Cheers,<br />B.

				I&#039;d call all that crap snake oil. The only way you will pass is to stop taking benzos.

				It depends on the test method used - but if its any good its possible to detect you took a single 10 mg tablet of valium a week ago (or at least some benzodiazepine). <br /><br />Given that, the best defense would probably be an excuse. Perhaps you can get some benzodiazepins prescribed, or were administered some as pre-medication to a surgical procedure. <br /><br />Why do you need to test negative though? Benzo&#039;s are prescribed to many people that can function very well when taking them. Quantitative analysis is also possible in case someone wants to evaluate your fitness to operate vehicles or machinery.
