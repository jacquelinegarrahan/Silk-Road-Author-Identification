				hey guys!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So, fried on 25i nbome, most had a lovely time, one guy was unstable, thought he could handle it since he&#039;s banging all sorts of shit in his arms and all that, <br /><br />&nbsp; He got into a repeating pattern of actions and speech which was freaking everyone out.&nbsp; He kept saying &quot;it&#039;s my life&quot; and whatever.&nbsp; He started getting agressive towards others in the room (hotel room, on main drag)&nbsp; Kept trying to leave (Not gonna happen dude, not safe there for you)<br /><br />&nbsp; Eventully we all realized that he was stuck, or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;We tried to calm him, guard the door, etc.&nbsp; After an hour of him doing and saying the same thing, talking suicide at moments, repeating, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp; We tried to make him eat a ativan (alprozalam, I think) to calm him, he refused. chewed it and spit it every ewhere.<br /><br />&nbsp; finally we just realized we all had to calm down and shut up and let him ease out of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;an hour later, he slowly eased out of it.&nbsp; It was amazing seeing this guy come back to reality.&nbsp; He patterns started growing longer, his thoughts extended beyond the 5-10 second loops he was on for 3 hours.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anyone have experience with this?&nbsp; I am great on journeys alone or with people who are traveling with me and having fun, but I need advice on how to help people like in that situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any advice?

				Damn. That sounds like a shitty trip. It sounds like you did all the right things. I wouldnt really know what else one could do in that situation besides physically grabbing the dude and knocking him the fuck out or tying him up so he doesnt hurt himself. <br /><br />Maybe try to get some IV valium to keep on hand so you could inject someone wigging out like an epi pen for allergies or nalaxone shot for an H od. Scary.

				Just keep benzos or zyprexa or something on hand, works for lucy trips so I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s the same for nbome. If he won&#039;t take it and tries to spit it out like you said, I&#039;d feed it to him like a fuckin dog, hold his mouth open or get him to scream, pop it in, maybe with water if you&#039;re feeling nice, then hold it shut and rub his throat like a dog.<br /><br />Nothing pisses me off more while tripping than someone ruining it for everyone else because they can&#039;t handle it. I guess I just can&#039;t see it from their perspective, I&#039;ve never had a trip like this that everyone seems to describe, even on high doses of lucy I can still control myself well enough to at the very least not piss off everyone else.

				I got my finger bit putting it into his mouth. haha.<br /><br />He was pretty cool though, it was kind of bonding because I didn&#039;t know two of the guys much at all.&nbsp; I was glad I stayed true and didn&#039;t just bail on everyone.&nbsp; a friend was saying at the time, &quot;look, just sit, chill, try and keep him calm, act like everything is cool, don&#039;t leave, don&#039;t change the situation, don&#039;t leave him wnodering &quot;where&#039;s (insert name here)?&quot;, act like nothing is wrong, time is the only cure&quot;<br /><br />I was glad I brought the pill, cuz they were supposed to have tons.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m done frying with guys on lots of other shit.&nbsp; I had no idea that they were shooting bk and snorting mxe all day before we got there.&nbsp; all they said was they were on anti depression.<br /><br /><br />my friend and I actually were thinking that the two of them had some sort of secret suicide pact that we stumbled onto and fucked up by tripping with them.&nbsp; (saved their life maybe? Maybe)

				Personally, my friends and I love getting stuck in our circular thought patterns.&nbsp; Eventually I start realizing how everything in life flows in circles and it just is part of the experience.&nbsp; Regardless, imo it&#039;s always a bad idea to do psychedelics with people who are used to stimulants/opiates etc...

				Ive seen 10mg diazepam in an auto injector that shoots the whole 10mg deep into your muscle instantly. Its only supposed to be used in an emergency, but this situation sounds like an emergency to me.

				Chlorpromazine (about 100mg) is the classical emergency brake for a bad trip. Alternatively more modern antipsychotics should also help.<br /><br />But the best thing is not letting it get that far. Being in the same hotel room with people that i may not know too well would be a good way for me to get on a bad trip. Being outdoors in nature is much healthier.

				Everyone in here saying it&#039;s this dude&#039;s fault should get a reality check. This stuff happens, and can happen to anyone. Even the most &quot;hardcore&quot; can get stuck and it sucks for everyone involved but it&#039;s not necessarily anyone&#039;s fault. You&#039;re a good guy for sticking there with him. I&#039;ve found the best remedy is to change the scenery. Simply moving to another room or engaging the person in an activity can do wonders.

				I had a similar experience a while ago.<br /><br />A friend was driving me home after a massive night and I kept seeing the same buildings going by. This was around the time The Matrix was released, so I thought I was stuck in the Matrix and the only way to get out was to jump out of the moving car.<br /><br />Luckily my gf saw I was freaking out and about to jump out of the car. Apparently I turned white, started sweating and shaking. She calmed me down just by acting normal and speaking to me normally. I freaked out a couple of times on that trip, but that was the worst part. The best thing to do is not freak out yourself and not wind him up. Stay calm, chill and just look after him until he comes out of it.

				ACTUALLY, the guy probably had a bad time because he had shot up sass, mxe, had eaten some methadones, smokes some weed, and was on prozac. We didn&#039;t know they had done all that shit before he took the 25i. I knew the guy was extremely experienced with drugs, he takes RC&#039;s all the time.&nbsp; He&#039;s into the needle, we figured he was good to go.<br /><br />25i seemed really safe, especially at .5mg dosages.<br /><br />I personally feel that the forest is a very safe place to trip.&nbsp; Basically I&#039;m only afraid of cops hurting me, I really don&#039;t find drugs to be scary or dangerous unless they are taken at very high levels exceeding recommended dosages.

				oh, and the guy who I wanted to trip in the woods with is a pretty experienced tripper.&nbsp; He also has a good head on his shoulders.&nbsp; The one who freaked out, well, he&#039;s a totally closeted homosexual who probably wants to have a sex change.&nbsp; We actually thought he was going to come out, or say he wanted to be a girl.<br /><br />And honestly, when I was frying, I looked at him and he really looked like a girl.&nbsp; girls hair, female features, etc.&nbsp; The only thing male about him is his sexual organs.&nbsp; Poor guy.&nbsp; Feel bad for him.<br /><br />I did learn that I won&#039;t fry with people who seem like they could be unstable, no matter how often they do drugs.

				My friend had a problem like this, where we were tripping on acid and he kept forgetting who/where he was and trying to go home. It almost ruined our trip to be honest, having to deal with this guy and keep it together but he came to eventually. Best thing to do is just leave him be, if he starts kicking off then you gotta step in but otherwise leave him be.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t nice though tripping balls and someone is messing the vibe up, bane of my drug taking career in fact.
