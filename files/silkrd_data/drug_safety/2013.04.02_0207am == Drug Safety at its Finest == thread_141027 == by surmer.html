				Hey guys and girls,<br /><br />I want to talk to you about drugs....<br /><br />No, but seriously, here is a list of tried/true Vendors. I have been satisfied with their products and security. I do NOT know if I have been bugged... as in put on a list in some MiB computer somewhere... (MiB include local/state/federal SWAT, CIA, NSA, Secret Service, IRS, etc...)... If I have been, then this is a public service announcement, and I will be certain to have a public court trial so that everyone on the Road will know WTF happened to surmer AFK. I don&#039;t wanna waste public resources by way of expensive trials, but as every intelligent American knows, money makes Right.<br /><br />OK. That said... here we go.<br /><br />The following vendors are superb for what they offer--price, stealth, and quality:<br /><br />NorthWestDirect<br />CannabisArbiter<br />UnderGroundSyndicate<br />GodOfFall<br />RedHempfield<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Keep a look out for updates.... verify my trustworthiness through my previous posts....<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />A wise man can play the part of a fool, but a fool cannot play the part of a wise man.<br /><br />A wise man learns the difference between a fool and wise man... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...at some inevitable point: through trial and error.

				Oh, definitely subbing to this.<br /><br />I would add Smokeables, he deals in tobacco and accessories mostly but he has several neat products, has a fairly quick processing/delivery time and is friendly. He is also open to suggestions for products. <br /><br />DrWhite is also pretty good, he does not move dank but his product is fairly priced with decent stealth and quick delivery. All of my transactions with him were flawless, he was my first order too. <br /><br />UnWizard sells legit absinthe, quick delivery/processing and creative packaging too. Only had one order with him so far, but I was impressed for a new vendor with a very unique product.

				Sorry, but after reading a post where you are verifying vendors and trying your best to ensure the safety of these mentioned vendors, makes me nervous. You have left no specific comments on the products that are SOO top notch, nor have you mentioned the pricing. If you are on this site and using it correctly, you really need nothing more than individual reports from others on the vendors feedback page and then cross-reference on the forums. The way you laid this information out makes me think one thing.. Here is someone working for LE. I could be completely wrong, and you very well may be trying to help new people... but this is&nbsp; not the forum to do that. Personally, I will never order from those vendors now. Have a nice day.&nbsp; 8)

				If it is &quot;radical paranoia&quot; then please provide the links as to where you left positive feedback for the vendors listed. Also, this is not the section of the forum for you to be promoting vendors. This is drug safety, not drug promotion. I would imagine if these vendors have done so good by you, that you would have had the common courtesy to either MAKE a feedback thread for them, or comment on them. I will await the links. Not trying to be rude, but take that nonsense to another section of this forum.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t be bothered reading through ALL of your posts.. which brings me to another question. You have been a member for 6 days and have already made 170 posts.... That in itself doesn&#039;t mean much, but how much could you have really scored in 6 days? As I said, please post a few links to your good reviews for your highly respected vendors. You don&#039;t have to prove yourself to me, but I do smell something foul.&nbsp; 8)

				Well, first I would like to point out a very clear problem with this thread. There is nothing AT ALL about drug safety. Maybe something about security safety, or vendor quality. So, no this thread does not belong here. I did just waste 15 mins of my life reading through your rambles and bullshit posts. I think you are the paranoid freak :-\. After reading, no I do not think you are LE, just a lunatic. Enjoy. 8)

				no need to argue. if op is updating and testing and posting pictures then its a cool thread. <br />At the moment its not developed. Needs more work. Drug testing and pictures would be very cool!<br /><br />maybe a move to rumor mill would be a good idea. Getting quality is part of drug safety but&nbsp; we have a whole subforum dedicated to quality control.&nbsp; <br /><br />but i think its a good try .... the thread just needs to develop! Op needs to update it with interesting info!

				What I meant by &quot;using the site correctly&quot;, is that you read the feedback from everyone and all details of products. Then, come to forums and research the subject/vendor. I assumed we were all talking about the &quot;safe&quot; vendors you are endorsing and found your post pointless. BUT!! as mentioned, if you update or move, hats off.
