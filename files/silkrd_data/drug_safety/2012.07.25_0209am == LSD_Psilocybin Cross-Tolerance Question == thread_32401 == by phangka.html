				I took a large dose of LSD on Sunday, around 600ug.&nbsp; Today my friend called and asked me to drive him to a music festival a few hundred miles away.&nbsp; He&#039;s offered a free ticket, gas money, and an eighth of cubes.&nbsp; There&#039;s no way I am turning him down.<br /><br /><br />Question is, what kind of effects can I expect from an eighth after taking such a large dose of LSD 5 days prior?

				My rule of thumb is after one week you need about 20% extra for a similar experience, and after two weeks you can dose the same again. If you tried dosing the next day it would be more like an extra 100% or more. Admittedly the experience I&#039;m quoting here is LSD to LSD, not LSD to Psilocybin. If you assume that the cross tolerance will be roughly the same (it&#039;s likely less in actual fact, but I&#039;m thinking worst case scenario here) then I would say you&#039;ll lose about 30% of what you would have had with no tolerance.<br /><br />Everyone is different though, so this is a really rough estimate and probably won&#039;t mean shit for you :P If the cubes are free though I&#039;d just go with it and let the experience be what it wants to be :)

				after 5 days, you will still have a slight tolerance. 7+ days brings your tolerance back to baseline.

				You want to be safe and potentially not waste drugs? Don&#039;t take psychedelics within 7 days of each other. That includes LSD, Shrooms, DOB, etc. They all have cross-tolerance. Usually 2 days between trips is good for me, I&#039;ve got a pretty decent metabolism and drink a shit ton of water and OJ. My friends have to wait at least 7 days to get back to baseline though.
