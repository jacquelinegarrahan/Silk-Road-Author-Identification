The MAOI greatly slowdown the experience and make it longer. It also increases the effect of the DMT so you need to smoke less.<br />Taking MAOIs is useful especially at beginning, when you are not yet accustomed to the very fast pace of DMT making it possible to integrate better with the experience. <br /><br />Naturally to take DMT orally you need a MAOI, so there the question doesn&#039;t pose itself, but in the case of smoking there are benefits on using MAOIs too. Another way (even better) to do the same is using MXE with DMT.<br /><br />P.S: If using a MAOI is much better to take a reversible one, as Syrian Rue or similar, since the duration is much lower and there are many less dangers. Using an irreversible MAOI for taking is not a so good idea (if you don&#039;t have to use one for some reason already).

The antidepressants MAOI are the most dangerous and of longer duration, they are the irreversible ones. Things like Syrian Rue or Banisteropis Capii are much less dangerous and these are the MAOIs usually taken in combination with DMT (as in Ayahuasca). In fact it doesn&#039;t make any sense to take an irreversible MAOI unless you already have to take one for another motive.

When you are experienced with DMT and you use MAOIs it will seem like you are watching the trip in slow-mo and because of this you understand that nothing really changes (the trip &quot;velocity&quot; in reality is always the same); this doesn&#039;t happen with MXE, making it much more interesting for experienced users (but for beginners it&#039;s better MAOIs since in this case the problem is in your interaction with the experience instead). In this way you can make the trip longer and have full time to interact with what happens in case you need so.<br /><br />Moreover MXE have not the many drawbacks of MAOIs, naturally.

				To try you can use something like:<br /><br />For MXE a common/medium dose (look on Erowid about them depending on the ROA you want to use).<br />For DMT the usual breakthrough dose you use normally or a little lower (MXE differently from Harmala don&#039;t greatly reduce the amount of DMT you must take, with MXE it remains almost unvaried, or at last it is so IME).<br /><br />Then vary accordingly with experience on what you feel is better for yourself.

				I did some research on both methods...<br /><br />for oral consumption I found &quot;harmine&quot; (that can be bought on SR from &quot;omnis&quot;). Decent research is necessary before using this, but it seems to be a wonderfull experience (for those who want to go down that rabbithole). there are a few posts about the combination DMT + harmine (from omnis) - I thought they were worth reading...<br /><br />for anal consumption the trick seems to be to bring it up far enough, untill you&#039;ve passed the first cm&#039;s (where you have pain receptors that will react to the burning - once you&#039;re past those first cm&#039;s there seems to be no negative effect) - I have seen a post about someone who tried it this way, but can&#039;t find it right now... if you search long enough for it...<br /><br />Keep us posted!

				plugging should last much longer (if I remember right from that threat it could last up to 40 minutes or so). Untill now I have never &quot;plugged&quot;, but I&#039;ve always kept it as an &quot;open option&quot; (&nbsp; ;D ) - I think there&#039;s no shame in using it that way. Anemas (treatments by putting stuff in your ass) have been used for centuries all over the world and have had many positive effects/results. If you want to discover the world of spirits, why not use that door? <br /><br />sublingual isn&#039;t an application for DMT<br /><br />taking oral (with appropriate MAOi) can last for hours (depending on the combination)

I have been pondering this for some time.<br /><br />But I am back with my First Trial Report:<br /><br />Earlier this week, I got a 250 mg sample from JeffBobb (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b837eeb5d4) for his N,N DMT crystalline powder. The package arrived quickly, and the stealth was legit. If you are considering DMT vendors, I would highly recommend this one for the spice. I can say, after my First Trial, that this is very potent and also very close to pure (I have used DMT on several other occasions from a variety of sources).<br /><br />I decided to start with basics, since there is such little information on the internet (darknet or clearnet) about rectal administration of DMT.<br /><br />I put somewhere between 15-20 mg of DMT powder into a small bottle cap and added 1.5 ml of water.<br />DMT did not fully dissolve, but it did go into suspension so that I could draw it all up into a liquid syringe (used for infant medication admin.)<br />I put the syringe pretty far into my anus and delivered the DMT.<br />Then I laid down on my stomach for approximately 5 minutes. During those 5 minutes, I felt tingling spreading from my anus out to my lower body and also up towards my torso. You know, the kind of tingling usually accompanied by goosebumps. While this was happening, I was also experiencing a growing burning feeling in my anus. Also a very strong urge to defecate, even though I&#039;d already emptied my bowels before starting the experiment. After 5 minutes, I couldn&#039;t wait anymore. The urge to poop and the burning had become basically unbearable. <br />After expelling whatever else my body was able to push out, I sighed, thinking the experiment was over and that I&#039;d need to do another trial. But suddenly, I felt that familiar feeling in my teeth that I get when I do DMT (I don&#039;t know if other people get this or not). It&#039;s the sensation that my teeth are vibrating at a specific frequency or something, and then that feeling kind of spreads to the rest of my body. Either way, I realized the experiment was not over YET. :)<br />So I wiped my ass (which was feeling considerably better after) and laid back down on my bed.<br />The DMT comeup feeling continued to grow for about 2-3 minutes. <br />With my eyes closed, I noticed that the darkness behind my eyelids was growing steadily brighter (and my room was mostly dark). I could almost feel the DMT moving through my veins and into my brain like small waves on the beach as the tide is going up. That steady, rhythmic increasing. However, this feeling faded after about 4 minutes and I was left with a peaceful mindstate.<br />End Report<br />~.~.~<br /><br />Thoughts: I think I need to increase the dose to somewhere between 30-50 mg and possibly use a different substance to dissolve the DMT in. I&#039;m guessing butter was suggested because DMT dissolves easily in butter? Will have to research that property a bit more. I can say that rectal administration is most definitely a reasonable ROA, but the technique needs to be fine-tuned. I&#039;m glad I tried this before snorting it, that&#039;s for sure. I really enjoyed the gradual comeup vs the usual shot-out-of-a-psychedelic-cannon feeling one gets from smoking the DMT. I think this will be my ROA of choice once I understand what I need in order to achieve a breakthrough dose. This ROA didn&#039;t lose any of the feelings of sanctity that smoked DMT affords. I felt like I was on my way to be in a very &quot;holy&quot; kind of state and that I would be in touch with Teachers soon. <br /><br />As a (funny) side note: I think I may have at least successfully micro-dosed DMT! :P

				I&#039;m not 100% sure but I don&#039;t see how rectal is any different than sublingual. DMT crosses your mucous membrane either way and it&#039;s metabolized as fast as it gets through... unless you have MAOI in your system.
