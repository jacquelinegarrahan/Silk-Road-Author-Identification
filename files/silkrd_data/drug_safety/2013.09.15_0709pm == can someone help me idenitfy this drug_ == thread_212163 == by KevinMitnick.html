				so had a few people over my apartment last night. the usual, drinks, blow, chit chat. and some people brought people i don&#039;t know. and i don&#039;t mind usually as long as strangers don&#039;t take anything.<br /><br />but last night something strange happened. when the guests left, me and the girl were cleaning up and instead of TAKING something, someone (whom I dont know), LEFT something. left a tiny baggie of SOMETHING. doesn&#039;t look like coke to me. what can it be? i was actually gonna put some on my tongue or bump it to see what it is, but my gf half joked that it might be fucking bath salts. and we all remember the BathSalt Rambo... so yeah I dont wanna do that.<br /><br />i figures where else to go but to SR to ask my fellow drug gurus to help identify this substance. its white-ish, kinda looks beady? i took a picture, and uploaded it via tor to an image hosting site. had to blur our everything but the bag. can someone tell me what this might be? is it molly? whacky looking coke? BATH SALT? meth or some amphetamine? or is it maybe nothing? (which i doubt.. as who carries a baggie with a substance that aint drugs, ya know?<br /><br />it&#039;s not much, and its a shitty iphone pic, but i think it shows the texture/look of it well enough for someone more experienced then me to be able to venture a guess.<br /><br />*clearnet link* http://lookpic.com/O/i2/1229/HuTzjY2.jpeg<br /><br />Ok guys, who&#039;s got what?

				Yeah, no. All we can say is that it&#039;s a white substance that looks to have beaded up due to moisture. There&#039;s no real way of telling what substance this is without chemical analysis. I strongly suggest not &#039;trying it&#039; as it could be multitude of chemicals, some of them lethal. Putting it on your tongue is no litmus test either as other drugs can mimic the numbing effect of cocaine; in the process, you may absorb a lethal amount because it could be some wonderful drug or cyanide.

				hmm.. i doubt its ricin though. some fratboy type dude left it behind, he was drinking, blowing lines, being loud, energetic. i doubt he was bumping ricin in the bathroom!<br /><br />moon rock.. hmm.. is that rock form molly? some chick said she thinks its molly. but the &quot;beady&quot; look of it? I inspected it closely, its definetly not coke, doesnt smell like coke or look like coke.<br /><br />

				Why discard it? Someone obviously left it there and that person probably knows what is is, and may want it back. From the picture i really cannot tell what it is. I&#039;m sure that the person that lost that package knows exactly what it is though, and might either want to recollect it or could tell you what it&nbsp; is and how to use it if you want to.

				No way I&#039;d risk taking something without knowing what it is supposed to be... although whenever I buy from my dealer IRL I guess I&#039;m kinda doing this.<br /><br />Nice username, by the way :-)

But I wouldnt have flushed it, I would have tried to find out who&#039;s it was, what it was, and then offer to split it if it&#039;s something neat-o. but it&#039;s probably someones creatine powder or something they put on there food (my buddy used to put that shit on his ice cream).

				I would keep it for a few days and see if someone claims it as theirs, clearly forgetting it when they left in an inebriated state. If you hear nothing after a week, I&#039;d either test it or trash it.
