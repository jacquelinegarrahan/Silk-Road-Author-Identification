				Alright, I&#039;m waiting on orders from ST and another seller for MDMA, but I haven&#039;t rolled in a while so I (stupidly) made the plunge and bought some MDMA from a local guy. It was powder in capsules, a decent deal, but nothing amazing.<br /><br />I&#039;m still an MDMA amateur, this was only my 4th roll, 2 of the previous being from Supertrips white speakers and the other from a pill that had good reports on PillReports, so I believe I have a fair idea as to how a good roll feels. <br /><br />This roll, on the other hand, was completely different feeling.<br /><br />- Normally MDMA makes me very talkative, this roll I was very quiet.<br />- Very little tracers compared to the other rolls.<br />- I dosed at Midnight, then boosted at 2AM, maybe a total of 180MG, and now it is 1PM and I am still wide awake, my body is tired but my mind is still running quick.<br />- My hands/back muscles would randomly stiffen, to the point where I couldn&#039;t type on a keyboard.<br />- Cold sweats.<br /><br /><br />So just out of pure curiosity, does anyone have a guess as to what it may have been cut with? Or was it possibly just a sketchy synthesized batch?<br /><br />I have 2 capsules left, going to run a Marquis test on them when the test gets shipped to me, but I was hoping the forums would have a quicker answer for me.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

				who knows, not one can tell you definintivly.&nbsp; More than likely its cut with two or three substances, and often molly now a days is cut with M1 or speed.&nbsp; And than also cut with a non physco-active substance like niacin.&nbsp; Or it was pure m1 who the fuck knows, im just telling you odds are its not even half mdma.

				Ya there is no way to tell without testing it.<br /><br />Stay safe and dont buy from strangers and if you do always ask if you can test it first. If they say no, you will know right away they are cutting it

				Yea, lesson learned. Next time I&#039;ll just wait for my packages from SR :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered test kits, and I have two capsules that I can&#039;t make myself sell morally, I&#039;ll give it a test when I get them for the hell of it.

				Test kits will not help you much. other then determining there actually is mdma in the tablets in some quantity. <br /><br />Street dealers may use anything you can think of to cut. Usually its pretty harmless (lactose or something), but some use the most idiotic substances like household cleaning supplies. A few years ago a lot of street cocaine turned up here in the netherlands that had been cut with atropine - not the best idea if you have some heart condition. <br />
