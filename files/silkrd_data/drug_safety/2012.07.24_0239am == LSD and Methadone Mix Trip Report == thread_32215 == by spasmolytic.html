				Okay, so I&#039;m on Methadone maintenance at a local clinic, I am down to 90mg a day, but I only dose on Tuesdays &amp; Saturdays (slowly trying to get off the shit for good). I recently got some double-sided blotter from NL &amp; the only time I can do it is on the weekends. So this last Saturday, I wake up go to the clinic as usual, I take my dose around 8:30am and get back to my peeps which I&#039;m dropping with. Around 4:50pm we all dosed 1 &amp; 1/4 hits, around 7:00pm we start to feel it, now let me add, I hadn&#039;t had much sleep the night before, maybe 3 hours, so I know that didn&#039;t help. Things were going fine till about 9:00pm and the tiredness and Methadone caught up to me &amp; It felt like a normal trip, but It felt drowsy, it&#039;s hard to explain, like my eyes were heavy but at no point did they close, I had visuals and all the things that come with a trip, but a very noticeable drowsiness with it. So my advice for anybody else thinking of this mix, don&#039;t do it on the same day if you can help it. If you do, make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before, but more importantly, space them apart as far as you can. The trip was fine for me, just not able to truly get into it. I enjoyed otherwise. Obviously I knew there was going to be side effects, but I wasn&#039;t sure just how much &amp; for how long. It was quite stupid of me to have went through with it I suppose, but fuck it, I wanted to trip &amp; I wasn&#039;t sure when my next chance would be, to where all our schedules lined up with work and all. Over all I am glad I did it, I still walked away with some fresh insight, and I still had fun.<br />

				Methadone inhibits the effects of LSD. Your trip was diminished from what it could have been if you hadn&#039;t taken methadone earlier that day. Methadone is similar to heroin or morphine, and when LSD is combined with those two drugs it is usually not felt by the individual.
