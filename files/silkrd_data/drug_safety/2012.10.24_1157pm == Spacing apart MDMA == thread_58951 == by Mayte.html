				So I don&#039;t roll very frequently.. maybe once or twice a year normally, but I&#039;m going to make an exception for the upcoming weeks. I have a party this weekend that I&#039;m going to, and an event 2 weeks after that where I&#039;d like to roll both days. Ideally, I want to roll three times within this 2 week span, but I&#039;d like your advice.. (I have F16 and PF molly)<br /><br />For the first party, it will be my friend&#039;s first time and she asked me to roll with her - what kind of friend would I be if I made her take it alone?!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />The event is 2 days, which is 2 weeks after the party. I was planning on taking MDMA the first day, and then MDMA + 2cb the second day. these are the only substances I have/will be able to get in time.<br /><br />Would I be able to roll all 3 times? Do you have any suggested dosages (I weigh about 50kg if that helps) ? Also, I have some 5-HTP that I can take for after the party, if that would help.<br /><br />Thanks!

				In addition to the 5-htp be sure to take Vitamin C before and after you roll and alpha lipoic acid after you roll. It will reduce nuerotoxic effects and will keep your tolerance down, very important.<br /><br />I would try to refrain from doing it 3 times in 2 weeks especially when you are combing 2c-b with it. 2 times in 2 weeks is ok but only if you are doing it rarely and pre-loading/post-loading.<br /><br />Also do not drink alochol on MDMA its really bad for you idk why so many people do it.

				With outstanding molly like PF&#039;s (not tried F16), you&#039;re good to go. Don&#039;t make it&nbsp; regular thing but yeah, it is definitely doable.

				you might not feel the MDMA on the 2nd day of the event...you may deplete your serotonin during the first night or your receptors will have downregulated by the next day...<br /><br />also after only 2 weeks of recovery time you may experience diminished effects during the event...<br /><br />this is what i would do:<br /><br />as stated before preload with 5-htp and vitamin C...<br />do a moderately low dose at the first party...like 100mg of the molly...<br />postload for the 2&nbsp; weeks leading up to the event...<br />take just the 2C-B on the first night of the event...<br />then on the 2nd day of the event take a higher dose of MDMA...like 200mg...

				Would it affect anything if instead of taking molly for the party, I only took a small oral dose (15-20mg) of 2c-b while my friend rolled? I&#039;d feel bad being on a different substance than her, but would we be on somewhat similar levels? Or maybe I could ask if she would be willing to try the 2c-b instead...

				Do it OP, you&#039;ll have a great time, especially if you space your &quot;binges&quot; out by that much.&nbsp; I can usually roll two weekends in a row and then break for 2 months or so and roll for a couple events again with no problems.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have friends who&#039;ve rolled on a weekly basis for a year straight and were just fine, they admitted it wasn&#039;t nearly as epic by the 6 or 7th time, but still made for fun nights.&nbsp; I find 6 weeks is more than enough time to get your &quot;magic&quot; back up to speed.&nbsp; Hell I rolled 4 times in one week (big festival) and every night was equally epic as the last, but that&#039;s also a very magical place to do it so set and setting is still kind of a factor with MDMA ;)

				I wouldn&#039;t call MDMA a psychedelic at all...2c-b IMO is about as introductory to psychs as you can get without it being potentially boring.

				So I decided we&#039;re just going to take the MDMA for the party. My friend has had experience with shrooms before, so shes not entirely new to psychedelics, but I feel like we should just stick to the classic love drug for the time being. I will probably take 100-115 mg or so, no redose, and properly postload/preload throughout the 2 weeks. <br /><br />Thanks everyone for the help :)

				i rolled for 10 days straight on Dopeboys stuff when he was around, needed .5 to roll on the last day and had very little crash. Go big or go home. Since then i have not rolled that much nor do i plan on rolling that much again. Now i roll 2 times in a month then take 2 months off or more and then repeat. I find that works for me with no diminished results

But I&#039;ve read (don&#039;t remember the source) that it&#039;s not all that common. I don&#039;t even have to take that much anymore to get them but they can get really intense. The auditory hallucinations are the most ridiculous. I get those so bad.

				If i take more than 200mg of a good product, i can&#039;t talk to anybody normally. I even can&#039;t see things the right way.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had any strong psychadelic experiences, but my tolerance is quite high and the top of the trip is very short for me (but it last longer than for most others)
