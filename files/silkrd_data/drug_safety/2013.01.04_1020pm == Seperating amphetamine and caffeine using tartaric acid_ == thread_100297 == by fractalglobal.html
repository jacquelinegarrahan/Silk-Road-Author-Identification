				Just a thought I had, I have no formal education in chemistry but I do have quite a bit of experience in clandestine synthesis/extractions.&nbsp; Just wondering if it would be possible to seperate amphetamine and caffeine using the somewhat popular resolution of dextro/levo amphetamine with tartaric acid.&nbsp; Any chemist care to comment?

				No need to try to do an enantiomeric separation to get caffeine out of amphetamine.<br /><br />Off the top of my head, an acid-base purification seems like a good try.&nbsp; Dissolve the mixture in water, basify with NaOH solution, extract with an organic solvent, wash the organic layer several times with water to get rid of the caffeine.&nbsp; Dry the solvent and crystalize the amphetamine with HCl.&nbsp; You would need to chose the organic solvent carefully.&nbsp; Ether would work best; toluene would also be fine.&nbsp; Avoid dichloromethane and chloroform because caffeine is more soluble in those than it is in water.<br /><br />You could also try to separate the caffeine by sublimation, preferably under vacuum. Caffeine will sublimate at 170 deg C at atmospheric, but more readily at 160-165 deg C at 1 mm Hg.&nbsp; This might be a quick easy method, but I&#039;ve never done it before.&nbsp; You would have to be careful not to over heat as that could decompose your amphetamine. <br /><br />These are pretty standard organic lab techniques, so will leave it to you to look up the details of them.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, separation of caffeine from amphetamine should be pretty straightforward.

				A/B is something I&#039;m extremely familiar with 8). I was under the impression that it wouldn&#039;t work for amphetamine/caffeine seperation though.&nbsp; Caffeine is meant to be notoriously difficult to seperate from amphetamine, if something as simple as an A/B would work, I would have thought it would be somewhat common knowledge amongst tweakers.
