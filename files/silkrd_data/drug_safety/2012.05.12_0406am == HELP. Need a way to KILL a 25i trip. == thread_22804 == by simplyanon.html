				Benzos and sleep. Drink water/orange juice. Maybe try and have a tactical chunder if you feel the need. <br /><br />Benzos and sleep and keep hydrated.

				Anti psychotics (Seroquel) work good for this. Though they will knock you out and make you feel like a zombie as well.

				Benzos or some strong opiate/anti psychotic are your only hope... Sleep isn&#039;t easy on psychadelics. Try and keep your head straight and just remember it&#039;s easy to take another dose but most of the time you can&#039;t un-dose...<br /><br />^As for orange juice, I strongly believe that the idea of drinking OJ/taking lost of vitamin c has little to no effect on tripping just from personal experience, but hey that&#039;s just me.

				My girlfriend was terrified. We were FUCKED up. Like. Wow. Time was lapsing to a point where I would JUST remember doing something an hour after I did it. <br /><br />Personally I was alright with it, but my poor girlfriend was crying she was so scared. I wanted to walk but decicded wed both pop a xaxax and sleep.<br /><br />Another party today. More liquor than drugs, but this is gonna be a great weekend. <br /><br />Thanks a million guys. Lesson learned.<br /><br />Trip alone.<br /><br />&lt;3<br /><br />I still feel...amazing. I guess you could say. My brain was in overdrive whilst on that drug. Seriously. I can&#039;t explan it but I liked it.<br /><br />Also, thanks for the fat tabs and extras kwik. Much appreciated. &lt;3<br /><br />

				How can you not LOVE a 25i trip?!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Seriously though, my heart goes out to you dude.&nbsp; Scariest thing for me about tripping is that one of my friends will end up having a bad trip or just be too dumb to handle psychedelics in general.&nbsp; Thankfully it hasn&#039;t happened yet but you&#039;re lucky you got out of your trip and still had at least a decent time.

				i used to love psychedelics. they used to be my favorite drug. then i became stupid and got addicted to oxys/heroin. recently i thought it would be fun to trip. so i got 2, 1mg tabs of 25i. honestly it was the most scary experience of my life. i hate psychedelics now. nothing scares me more. i will never ingest another research chemical or psychedelic chemical again. lesson learned.&nbsp; :&#039;(&nbsp; all i can enjoy now are opiates, benzos, and mdma. sad days.

				The worst thing about tripping is when you get a negative thought and it spirals into chaos. Sometimes you avoid it completely and don&#039;t even consider it and its amazing and then other times you&#039;re just bogged down in noise and nonsense. It&#039;s a fucking tightrope that&#039;s for sure. Set and setting.. it really is everything.

				I found that a small amount of alcohol does help. Give it two or three hours when you&#039;ve started to calm a bit, and i don&#039;t mean get smashed, just a light nipper of spirits like jacks and coke, and some healthy type food, like a small amount of canned fish, stuff like that, perhaps some fruit, nothing big and bloaty or really unhealthy.

				Don&#039;t take more drugs, just enjoy the trip, turn on some lights and put chill music on and enjoy the visuals, if not go outside and kick a ball for a while.<br />Remember that it is all in your head, and you took the drug because you wanted those effects. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve done 4 25i tabs, but I think you get psychologically used to them pretty quickly so you need to step up the dose each time. But when I get tired of it I just vape a lot of weed and go to sleep.

				Antipsychotics will kill a trip. In a bad way. They&#039;re only for last resorts, like when you are trying to stop someone who has entered full psychedelic psychosis and is out of control violent.<br /><br />Benzos and alcohol will blunt a trip. They reduce the intensity of the trip to a small degree and also have anxiolytic properties that help calm you.<br /><br />Failing that, there is melatonin which will sedate you.
