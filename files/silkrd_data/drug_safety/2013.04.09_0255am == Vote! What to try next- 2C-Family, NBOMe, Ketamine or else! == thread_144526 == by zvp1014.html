				Hello, all!<br /><br />I&#039;m searching for my next substance to try, and am curious as to your input! In terms of what I have- LSD is by far my favorite drug, though MDMA is a close second (including salt which I presumed was MDMA, Pink Partyflock pills which I ADORED, and Red Armani&#039;s which were... not as great). I like relaxing weed strains but most make me paranoid. I also have DMT on the way to try (and am currently extracting it myself.) Also have been on Xanax for anxiety, but my base anxiety level is so high that I don&#039;t get much of a &#039;high&#039; off the Xanax.<br /><br />Anyways, here&#039;s the poll to vote from:<br />1. A 2C-Family drug– there are so many, so I don&#039;t know which to start with! 2C-B seems to be the popular one. I&#039;d love to try one that&#039;s a blend between euphoric and psychedelic. <br /><br />2. An NBOMe– I&#039;m really tempted by the prices here. 100 tabs for $0.55 each sounds like a ridiculously good deal, especially since a single acid tab can come to $10+. Main consideration is 25i-NBOMe, though the others intrigue me.<br /><br />3. Shrooms! Not sure if I want to do these as I hate feeling nauseous while tripping, but they are a classic. Other options seem better pricewise.<br /><br />4. Mescaline- pretty much the same reasoning as shrooms.<br /><br />5. Ketamine- a complete disconnect from myself sounds nice; I&#039;d love some transcendental relaxation.<br /><br />6. DXM- same as above.<br /><br />7. MXE- same as above.<br /><br />8. Something else! Suggest whatever you think might be best.<br /><br />Note that I&#039;m not particularly fond of feeling amped (though I do love caffeine, as well as the feeling of energy surrounding me ecstasy brings), so coke and meth aren&#039;t really my forté. I&#039;m more seeking to have a psychedelic experience, achieve euphoria or to leave the sensations of my body and enter transcendental relaxation.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Try shrooms if you enjoy tripping. I find the mushy guts to be tolerable.

				Tried all the same ones as you, plus mushrooms and 2C-E and 2C-B and my experience was mostly lacking with the 2C-x drugs, however I have really enjoyed mushrooms (maybe one day ill start up on here with em...), and DMT is a hell of a trip.&nbsp; Of the rest the #1 I want to try would be mescaline, but I am also interested in the NBOMEs.&nbsp; Curious but not too interested in the dissociatives.&nbsp; Have you actually tried coke?&nbsp; I only have a few times, but it was very clean and I was surprised at how smooth/comfortable it was, not really the &quot;amped&quot; I had imagined (and still imagine a number of other stims, though I haven&#039;t tried, other than adderall, which was used with intent rather than for fun).

				depends what your end-goal is..<br /><br />if youre just looking to screw around and have a bit of fun on the surface, nbome is definitely a good choice, 2c-b as well<br />if youre looking to go deeper, then mushys or ket<br /><br />im sure you know all about each one, but i think you would get better answers to your question if you stated what youre looking to get out of the experience :)

				25i-NBOMe still seems very tempting... especially given the $0.55 / tab price tag.<br /><br />At the very least, which psychs share the most similarities to acid?<br /><br />@londonlondon– I&#039;m looking for either transcendental relaxation (leaving my own mind and senses to enter a state of higher bliss and disconnect from the world), or for a similar state of disjointed reality that LSD provides. I&#039;m not really sure how to put it into words. I really do enjoy closed-eye hallucinations and would love open-eyed visuals distortions. On Acid I feel a sensation of energy dancing all over my skin, as if I could choose to smite lightning upon the world if I so chose- and I love it.

				Well, I&#039;ll answer according to which ones you&#039;ve listed that I have experience with, and suggest one you&#039;ll like <br /><br />25i has been compared to candy-flipping, in that it has a very speedy, energetic component. It meshes AMAZINGLY with weed, changing the high you get into something far trippier. When tripping on 25i, the visuals are moderate, but if I then get high, they get really intense, full-on &quot;acid trip&quot; visuals.<br />&nbsp;In fact, I&#039;d say having weed with 25i makes it 5-6 times better, because if you feel yourself getting stuck in recursive or stressful thoughts, a toke will lift you right out.<br /><br />25b has been described as less stressful, more pleasant (much like 2C-B compared to 2C-I, which in fact, they are the direct NBOME&#039;s of), and though I havn&#039;t had it myself, I&#039;m inclined to suggest it first, from what I&#039;ve read- especially since you say you aren&#039;t too keen on feeling &quot;amped&quot;<br /><br />DXM: Interesting, sort of a drunk / lurch-y high, felt like it turned my brains ability to process on its side; overall pretty fun. Definitely &quot;disjointed&quot;<br />However, it did leave me feeling somewhat drained the next day, to the point that I don&#039;t really take it anymore.<br /><br />I would suggest aMT! Given your description of what you&#039;re looking for, its perfect. It&#039;s around $5-10 a hit, and has been very favorably compared with LSD - often cited as being like it, but more relaxed / empathetic.<br /><br />Salvia will make you leave your body, but everyone has mixed results to it. I seem to find a correlation between people who enjoy salvia, and those who really enjoy hallucinogens, so you might want to give it a try.

				Hi,<br /><br />Considering you like LSD, you&#039;ll like very much 2C-B.<br /><br />Also, all my friends who have took mushrooms, LSD and mescaline said that mescaline was the best stuff ever ! Although hard to eat (San Pedra powder) and nauseous at the beginning.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t try mescaline but I highly prefer LSD to shrooms, it feels way cleaner. In fact you that you are just with yourself, your mind is expanding and it is not frightening if you know yourself well&nbsp; because it is YOUR mind, you know it,<br /><br />With shrooms, you feel that you are not alone in the trip, the spirit of the shrooms is there and guide your trip which can be rough as they like to give lessons. LSD just seemed cleaner to me.<br /><br /><br />For you problem of paranoia with weed, I know I&#039;m also subject to it when I smoke. When I smoke regularly it really penetrates my perception and even when I&#039;m not high, I can&#039;t see things clearly and truly. <br />Then I discovered Emerald&#039;s Ali Baba&#039;s Hash !!! This stuff is so extraordinary ! It gives a very gentle effects, you definitely feel the cannabis high, but instead of having your brain all smoked out on it, it acts just as a breeze of cannabis flowing around you. You&#039;re still the same person, able to function normally but with that touch of magic that smoking provides !<br />When I smoked regular hash, I wouldn&#039;t go out after and even talking with people was not enjoyable as I was way too fucked up in my mind.<br />With this, I was just able to enjoy myself with everyone, being stoned, and being cool at the same time. It really is extraordinary stuff. I understand now why Moroccans call hash a medicine. Their own hash, not the shit they export.<br />This is what you&#039;ll get with Emerald, I cannot vouch enough for this seller ! Haven&#039;t tried his other products, Ali Baba&#039;s is way good enough for me. I do not care for &quot;strong hash&quot; now, this just fucks your mind. <br />Ali Baba&#039;s hash surrounds your mind with joy and laughter. You remain the man in charge in your brain, as well as enjoying the nicest stone. Emerald should pay me for advertising, I could even sell this to my grand mother or to a cop.

				If I may, lysergic, I _really_ suggest xinhai&#039;s darkflower hash. So smooth, so potent. I literally need as much as I pinch off with the tips of my fingernails for a nice, smooth high.<br /><br />He advertises its an oil/hash mix, which results in something opaque, but with the consistency of amber / honey glass and a heavenly smell. He says his oil is made with natural solvents, so it extracts a more intact cannabis profile. I can&#039;t speak to the accuracy of those claims, but I can say it is my favorite hash to date, for that matter, my favorite cannabis form yet.

I&#039;m not sure what their composition was, though pill reports on the Red Armani&#039;s are saying they&#039;re entirely MDMA, whereas Partyflocks are being claimed to be either MDMA or Methylone (albeit I haven&#039;t seen any reagent tests, and there are multiple partyflock pressings of different colors). I had molly salts, which passed the reagent test, and the partyflocks felt more similar to it than the Red Armani&#039;s. So I like the &#039;amped&#039; of what I presume is real MDMA.

				i would definitely suggest you try ketamine asap. 2c-b is worth trying as well. i also hear they&#039;re great mixed. mushrooms are absolutely incredible, you should really eat some! they never make me nauseous unless i brew them in a tea. keep cannabis on hand for the nausea. if you&#039;re intimidated by the thought of eating mushrooms, i would try mescaline first. it&#039;s warm and euphoric, the queen of phenethylamines. truly a beautiful experience. you should read this before you trip: http://deoxy.org/psyexp.htm ;)
