				Here&#039;s my experience. 25-30 mg oral is lovely. Slow onset with the visuals but lovely body load. Snorting the same amount produces a faster onset hurts like an MF for 5-10 min but the visuals set in hard and fast, maybe too fast so i always half dose at 15mg if that is what I want.<br />I like to take it on the downslope of MDMA. Its prolongs the roll with its own flavor added and I have felt like it helps with the mood factor the next day. I have not binged on this or wanted to and I have my own personal stash.&nbsp; It is the safest of the 2C Family and Sasha called it &quot;an ally&quot; I think it may be his most perfect discovery.

				Yeah this is one of those odd drugs I actually feel better the next day after taking it. Cool thing about it is that it is active at very small doses. While most people take 20-25mg for a nice body high and visuals, even just 5-10mg will get you to a nice place so it&#039;s easy to start small and get to know it. Gotta be super careful with the doses though. The difference between 25 and 30mg for some people can be a lovely fun high and something that is far too intense.<br /><br />Snorting gets you high really fast.<br /><br />Oral get you high really slow.<br /><br />Plugging seems to be a happy middle ground if you are comfortable with that ROA.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t heard of too many people IV&#039;s this one.<br /><br />Anyway, start small and you&#039;ll be fine. If you do it with other people don&#039;t assume your dose is there does. Some people trip ass of 15mg and others don&#039;t. With something like this though once you get to know your dose you are pretty well set.

				Forgot one: How about storage? Is it a sensitive molecule? Is dry and dark storage good enough?
