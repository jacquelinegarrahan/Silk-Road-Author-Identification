				I ordered 100 mg of 2c-b which is a really small amount of powder, but approximately six times the dose I want to take for my first time. So do I get the dose right without a milligram scale?

				Poor entire bag onto plate/mirror.<br /><br />Divide powder into 5 piles.<br /><br />Remove a little bit from 1 pile and eat remaining powder.<br /><br />You won&#039;t OD on 2cb so eyeballing it is fine. If it&#039;s your first time, a ~15mg dose should be fun.

				Go onto Amazon.com and get the 25$ milligram scale they have.<br /><br />You do NOT want to fuck with high potency powders without a scale.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />It will come in handy time and again and its super cheap. <br /><br />I have the Gemini-20 by AWS.<br /><br />25 bucks.<br /><br />Do it.

				problem is you dont know how much you are starting off with unless you weigh it out, given some vendors will include a little extra or even send the wrong amount...<br /><br />if you can confirm you are starting with exactly 100 mg, then I would recommend volumetric&nbsp; measurement, where you dissolve known amount of 2c-b into known amount of alcohol solution (to dissolve, water wont work due to low solubility) then measure out correct amount of solution... say you dissolve 100 mg into 500 ml, then all you gotta do is measure out 100 ml and you have 20 mg... or 100mg/600ml then split into 100 ml for 15.167 mg dosages

				Just get a scale if you are using drugs like that mate. They are your standard kit for drugs like that.

				How do you know the vendor weighed it be exactly .1. Sometimes they through in a little extra or measure it fast and say fuck he will enjoy the extra 40mg+. Ive never taken 2ce but I imagine the threshold to over do it is slim if your does is 15mg.

I put in a bit extra because it makes people happy and it gives you good rep/customer satisfaction. You should always get scales out because you never know how much is what AND not every powders density is the same so what could be 100mg of xyz would be 200mg of abc.
