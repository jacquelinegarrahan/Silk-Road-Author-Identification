				After a shot in my hand between my pinky and ring finger the vein seemed to go dark red for a little bit and I could see it going down a little down my arm.<br /><br />Felt slightly weird afterwards, didn&#039;t get the normal rush and am a bit worried now that I&#039;ve hit an artery or something. It seems to have gone back to normal now, I definately registered but I can&#039;t remember how much blood came back into the needle. I pulled back a couple of times as although it wasn&#039;t painful I could definately feel the shot going in a bit more than normal. Hand seemed itchy for a minute or so as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably worrying over nothing as it feels okay now, although it definately didn&#039;t feel normal and just wondering if anyone else has experienced their vein going red.<br /><br />Did try google but couldn&#039;t find an answer and you guys have been great with other questions so thought I would try here.

				Sounds like you hit an artery. If you notice any swelling in the next 12 hours maybe consider going to the hospital.

				No swelling at all and everything feels fine now.<br /><br />So what I thought was my vein turning red was my artery turning redder? So basically if I ever see what I think to be my vein turn red in the future, it means I&#039;ve hit an artery?

				I give legit injections for a living and if I hit a small hand/finger vein sometimes the injection will &quot;push&quot; the blue/purple away and the superficial vein will turn pinkish red translucent as the material flows up the vein.&nbsp; Its weird like watching it change colors with the flow of stuff we inject.&nbsp; I&#039;d think you could chalk the lack of rush due to the small vein, that is speculation though.

				you would know if you hit a artery, hurts like hell and does much weirder thing then alittle redness. could just be a histamine release or phlebitis. hand is a dodgy place to hit because of vein roll although it is my fav sadly. those veins are pretty delicate too make sure if you are tying off your arm that you untie before pushing down the plunger because thats alot of increased pressure to that delicate vein if not. Was it a brand new needle? if not thats probably your problem.
