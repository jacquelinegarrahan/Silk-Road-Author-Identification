				My close friend and I are going to be trying some of the &quot;high&quot; quality EU MXE tonight. We have a lot of experience with psychs, LSD, mushrooms, a few 2c&#039;s, etc. But neither of us have ever tried a dissociative. So, what&#039;s a good dose to start off with? Best practices for good MXE experiences? Advice is needed!

				Small, key word, small bumps of about 30mg. For your first dose you can do a baby line just to get yourself started but after that stick with key bumps.<br /><br />It has an intense moreishness and you will want to keep going forever. Stop after like 3-4 doses. <br /><br />MXE is fucking amazing. Also I don&#039;t recommend going out on MXE. The only times MXE has put me and my friends in a bad spot is when we went out on MXE and were way too fucked up in public especially when we were dosing our friends. <br /><br />Enjoy you M-Hole.

				Thanks for the advice! What kind of setting do you think is prefferred for a first time MXE experience? We weren&#039;t planning on partying or anything, just hanging out at a safe house, taking some bumps, smoking some weed, playing video games and listening to music. Is this a good setting? Or is MXE more introspective?

Its more just about feeling fucked up and yummy. Its pretty nice. That sounds perfect! Download some good british dubstep such as Nero :P I suggest the Nero Essential Mix from BBC Radio One. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5954382/Nero_-_Essential_Mix_-_13-11-2010<br /><br />

				Wow thanks again for the link, I&#039;ll be DL&#039;ing these shortly in preparation for tonight.<br /><br />Any definite do&#039;s or don&#039;ts? Just trying to be fully educated and prepared when trying a new substance, especially when a very close friend is adventuring with me.

				The only bad thing with MXE and Ketamine is that sorting it kills your nose.<br /><br />The next day you&#039;re blowing your nose and taking out copious amounts of phlegm, like in the good old days of snorting coke.

				MXE IS SO FUCKING WEIRD.<br /><br />When I did it i&#039;d just tried DXM and NO2, when it comes to Dis&#039;s.<br /><br />Just, so indescribably strange. <br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

It won&#039;t get you as high as K will but it will also not sedate you as much and its harder to fuck up and take too much (as long as your not in public of course). Also each dose of MXE lasts a lot longer than a dose of K.<br /><br />Many people on bluelight agree that MXE is better than K. It is the only RC than has been considered better than the original. Than again it wasn&#039;t even created with the intention of being an analog...it was created with the intention of being a more long lasting, and more body friendly version of K. Its creator had phantom hand syndrome.

				Finally tried it last night - around did around 35 mg (eye balled it up as I don&#039;t have any scales at the moment).<br /><br />As a first time it was weirdly pleasant not nearly as full on as I thought it could be. No hints of paranoia or anything.... which I think is a subjective thing cause the others I did it with had some moments of panic or anxiety. I get real anxious on med- high dose LSD sometimes but this didn&#039;t even register on the paranoia meter at all for me. In fact it made me extremely talkative and positive. I&#039;m sure high amounts could easily floor a person if that&#039;s the effect you want.<br /><br />I would have re dosed more but the giddy after effects put me off, though mild I still feel slightly off balance and a bit mentally fragile today .... 10 hours later, could just be tired though and its NY eve tomorrow so better rest up :)

				I had read a lot of debate about routes of administration for MXE on the internet - most people said oral was ineffective, others seemed to confused sublingual with oral, and all in all it is confusing.<br />Usually, I take 30mg sublingually and that puts me in a pretty weird, enjoyable state, but I must say, not swallowing for 10-15mins is a pain.<br />So, last night I did an experiment. I made a gelatin capsule with 30mg mxe and swallowed it down, then went out for supper. About 15-20mins later, I felt the first signs of it kicking in, and from there it escalated quickly into the same level of dissociation as I feel from sublingual administration.<br /><br />So, if anyone has been put off by the debates around mxe routes of administration, I can say that I have found straight up eating mxe to yield identical effects as subbing.<br />

				Go slow with MXE.&nbsp; The other night I had some MXE sublingually, started with a few mg here, a few mg there, and when I noticed it I was in another dimension, I dissociated myself so hard that I thought I wouldn&#039;t come back.<br /><br />It was scary but fun at the same time.<br /><br />Watch out, this stuff is powerful.<br /><br />Sublingually hits you hard.<br />
