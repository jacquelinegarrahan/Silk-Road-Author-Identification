				Hello internet. Let me tell you a little bit about myself and this particular girl... From what I understand this is one of the few places people like myself can actually open up and get heartfelt advice from people in similar, ridiculous, drug addled scenarios, while staying anonymous. I find that fucking awesome. While I usually find myself to be the one giving the advice to my friends, I have this situation in particular that I do not know exactly how to approach.<br /><br />I met this girl 5 years ago, we saw each other as friends as I dated my high school sweetheart. My highschool sweetheart didnt like that I hung out with, we&#039;ll call her jane, because jane was hotter than her. I always wanted to bang jane, but never touched her once in that year I knew her. Then she disappeared for 3.5 years. In those 3.5 years I became a highly successful drug dealer in real life, with minor addictions along the way... I chased xanax for months, I chased ketamine for months, I chased cocaine for months, but I always managed to either substitute or put the shit down. She came into my life again and it was immediately apparent that she was crazy, and depressed to the point of being suicidal.<br /><br />I invited her to sleep over and we banged the next morning.<br /><br />She convinced me to pick up oxys/dope the week after that.<br /><br />I got us a room and supported us and our new dope habit for 3 months.<br /><br />Then she tried to kill herself and went to rehab for three months.<br /><br />Then she lived in a faraway state for 3 months.<br /><br />She came back a week ago, and being the sexiest girl I&#039;ve ever been with, of course we&#039;ve been hanging out. (I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m a bad person but that&#039;s for another thread...)<br /><br />She&#039;s super depressed, and predisposed to addiction. However, from what I understand, a single use of ketamine (I was thinking we&#039;d split half a gram of pure K over the course of a night) is reported to produce antidepressive qualities for up to a month after a single use. As such, I was wondering if it would be a potentially good thing for her overwhelming depression? Bear in mind she cannot source it without me, and I would supply it one time for medical purposes.... Sniffed not shot obviously....<br /><br />Is it a worthwhile venture? Should I tell her to just stick to pot? she&#039;s half a year clean but already making mention of &quot;I wanna get high on something else&quot; and I remembered the medical antidepressive use of ketamine.<br /><br /><br />Thoughts anyone? Please

				Worth a try.&nbsp; A lot of &quot;illegal&quot; drug users are self medicating for &quot;something&quot;.&nbsp; Find one that works for her but make sure to read up on the dangers.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; K is bad when you start taking a lot (tolerance+addiction).<br /><br />LSD is good too.&nbsp; Helps in opening up (if she goes to therapy).&nbsp; LSD afterglow makes you appreciate the little things in life.<br /><br />Have a try at MDMA too.&nbsp; An added bonus is the crazy wild sex.
