				I thought it was a bit irresponsible, but without really having the balls to outright say &quot;fuck it, it&#039;s fine.&quot;<br /><br />Saying that MDMA is perfectly safe ...through the example of known doses in a controlled setting... When in reality most people take God knows what, with God knows what else, God knows where.

				Good documentary - wish they had shown more of the scientific findings. Would also like to read the study findings and also that one professors reference material when he made claims about depression and memory. <br /><br />Other than that, loved watching the participants chew their faces off and be like &#039;yeah, i think i&#039;m on something, i feel really nice&quot;

				Cool - I&#039;ve just downloaded it and will check it out this weekend.<br /><br />It&#039;s interesting to see a scientist so vocal in his support for drugs like ecstasy vs alcohol. <br /><br />Thanks for the link sdesu

				Yeah, professor Parrot was kinda funny, with the painful grimace steadily fixed on his face. He looked like he&#039;s TERRIBLY concerned about something all the time.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />But despite all those various guests, pleasant and unpleasant experiences mentioned, and all the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s mentioned, I had a clear impression that the entire show was totally pro-ecstasy. How the host was insisting &quot;This is something AMAZING!&quot; when talking about the healing that occurred in the ordained priest as a consequence of the ecstasy experience. And, after all, he invited a professor named PARROT to oppose the two main guest, who were both clearly pro-ecstasy.... (Well I&#039;m not sure how this is in English, but in my language someone called parrot is certainly funny.)<br /><br />It is a pity they did not make a connection between the fact, that the ordained priest had the most significant and life-changing experience from all the subjects and the fact, that she was a spiritually connected and educated person.<br /><br />Also, it made me laugh how one of the main guests (the big guy) tried to explain everything through showing what happens in the brain. &quot;For the first time ever we have seen that there is heightened activity in the visual cortex in people on ecstasy. That explains why they see enhanced colors!&quot;&nbsp; Hurray!&nbsp; My goodness, these scientists can be funny sometimes... What the heck is that supposed to say about why everything you look at is soooo lovely and beautifully colored on E...? lol

				Hard to expect much more from a glossy TV show really. The DJ guy made MDMA users look like tools. And Lily Allen&#039;s dad didn&#039;t do the scene any favors either. The solider guy was a dick. The priest was the most honest about her experience. <br /><br />I thought the MRI results were very interesting actually. <br /><br />But I would&#039;ve like to hear them actually describe how MDMA can be safe (infrequent use, vitamin C, not redosing large amounts, drinking enough water but not too much etc).&nbsp; There is more science out there about neuroprotection they didn&#039;t go into. <br /><br />And for kicks.. why not put them into a car and see how they go against a drunk person! ;)

				Haven&#039;t watched it yet but they should have compared a number of things (if they didn&#039;t already), such as:<br /><br />average cost of a pill vs cost of alcoholic drink<br />number of pills needed to have a good time vs number of drinks needed<br />comparative cost across the evening<br />number of fights of people on E vs those drinking<br />E driving vs drunk driving<br />Cost to tax payers to manage both sets of people.<br /><br />Any others?
