				Lots of LSD stories in the news lately...<br /><br /><br />Easton, PA — It apparently turned out to be a very “bad trip” to school. Two brothers, ages 7 and 10, on their way to elementary school reportedly drank liquid LSD from a bottle of breath mint drops that was laying on the ground. By the time they got to the schoolhouse, the two Pennsylvania siblings were “foaming at the mouth and hallucinating” according to AP. They were rushed to the hospital and released the next day, so fortunately it appears they are okay.<br /><br />The incident occurred on September 24, but yesterday the local prosecutor formally acknowledged that the brothers ingested the hallucinogen (formal name&nbsp; Lysergic acid diethylamide) after his office conducted an investigation into the horrifying incident involving LSD found on the street.<br /><br />Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli also said that police were unable to obtain fingerprints on the bottle to trace it. He added that the boys’ mother and live-in boyfriend tested negative for drugs.<br /><br />The Foundation for a Drug-Free World explains that dropping acid can cause delusions, hallucinations, panic attacks, impaired time and depth perception, and severe depression among other things. Physical effects can include dilated pupils, high blood pressure, abnormally high or low body temperature, and tremors. Depending upon the dose and other factors, the effects start within&nbsp; 30 minutes could last as long as 12 hours.<br /><br />According to University of Washington neuroscientist, LSD is still a mystery to some degree even after all these years:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “LSD has a chemical structure that is very similar to the neurotransmitter called serotonin. It is thought that the effects of LSD are caused by stimulation of serotonin receptors on neurons, perhaps in the brain area called the raphe nuclei. However, it is still not clear what produces all the effects of LSD.”<br /><br />Read more at http://www.inquisitr.com/417519/brothers-7-and-10-accidentally-take-lsd/#tSXvw1FZRYsm2Fs2.99<br />

				Foaming at the mouth. Unlikely but possible of course. However since it is suggested that both had this symptom, it is highly unlikely they had LSD.

When animals get rabies, the virus spreads outwards to the salivary glands, which begin producing large amounts of saliva. The animal&#039;s breathing, coupled with excessive saliva production, causes the foam....<br /><br />A similar example of how a fluid is aerated, is white water in a river. The foam is just bubbles as air mixes in and then escapes.<br /><br />Extremely high dosages of LSD are known to produce unusual physical symptoms, such as rapid breathing, movements resembling convulsions, excessive saliva production, etc.<br /><br />So it is possible, though by no means certain, that the children did ingest LSD.

				Who knows what these kids ingested - as i read it the picked up some bottle off the streets and consumed its contents.<br /><br />Blaming LSD seems overly easily without actually having that bottle and analyzing its contents. <br /><br />Also, i think their parents probably need a firm lecture. What would compel one to ingest the content of some random bottle found on the streets? I may as well be a container of milk that has been lingering around at room temperature for months. Not that that would give any lsd like effects, but it could make someone seriously ill without any illicit substance involved.

				Did no one think to tell the children not to drink water from off the street even if it looks like it could be candy... This my friends is the problem.&nbsp; Parents are the problem here.&nbsp; Since when do kids eat gum, nuts, sunflower seeds, or mints, off the ground? The parents should get a nice talking to about that, not the wild hallucinations the kids must of had.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For all we know they could have bought it off of an older kid...and they did that to avoid a long story with parents, eh?

				1) Yes, kids shouldn&#039;t put random crap in their mouth, but this makes more sense in context.<br />2) Yes, it was confirmed as LSD.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> November 28, 2012<br />Two Bangor Area elementary schoolchildren&nbsp; inadvertently took LSD in September because it was disguised as breath drops they found on their front steps, District Attorney John Morganelli announced today.<br />Although investigators say they have learned knon drug users lived below the 7-year-old and 10-year-old brothers, Morganelli said police cannot determine how the illegal hallucinogen wound up outside the home in the 500 block of Market Street in Bangor.<br />No charges will be filed as a result, Morganelli said.<br />&quot;Although it is quite unfortunate that these young children were exposed to LSD, luckily it appears that there will be no long-term effects,&quot; he said. Neither boy has any memory of the incident other than recalling going to the hospital, he said.<br />The boys&#039; mother, Dawn Connors, told police her sons were late for school Sept. 24 and one had not brushed his teeth. The other boy then pulled out the small breath freshener container and gave him two drops and took one drop himself. The mother then drove the boys to the bus stop, where they boarded their bus without incident, police said.<br />On the bus, one of the boys became sick and began to vomit. By the time they were taken to the nurse&#039;s office, both boys were foaming at the mouth, hallucinating and staring into space, Morganelli said. They were taken to Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg and later transferred to Lehigh Valley Hospital, Salisbury Township, where they were released the next day.<br />Once recovered, the boys told police they found the bottle on the front steps outside their home and took it inside. Pennsylvania State Police tests determined it contained liquid LSD. The bottle was too contaminated for police to gather any useful investigative information from it, Morganelli said.<br />Investigators tested Connors and her live-in partner for five weeks, and the Northampton County Division of Children, Youth and Family Services conducted visits to the home. Both adults passed all tests, and the children were never found to be at risk in the home, Morganelli said.<br />Morganelli said the boys&#039; downstairs neighbors at the time had a history with drugs, but no evidence existed that linked them to the bottle. Both neighbors have since moved out of the house, with one in rehab and the other out of the area. He declined to name the neighbors.<br />&quot;It&#039;s probably not going to be determined at this point. No one is going to volunteer that it was theirs,&quot; Morganelli said.<br />Attempts to contact Connors for comment were not successful.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />edited - psychedelia already posted the other LSD/kids in Pennsylvania story<br />:)<br />

				Indeed, just teach kids not to drink/eat anything found on the streets. <br /><br />It could contain lsd, or anything else for that matter. <br /><br />Things like PET soda bottles are actually pretty good to store a wide range of chemicals in, including things like paint thinner and such. Some kid surely could pull a bottle used like that from the trash and drink its contents. If someone used that bottle filled with thinner to clean some paint brushes, i think the effects could be far worse than an accidental dose of lsd. Even worse would be grabbing a bottle used by someone that uses them in chemistry experiments. I&#039;m sure spent soda bottles are used by people cooking meth at home as lab vessels from time to time, and i can only imagine what shit would remain in those - probably krokodil without the nice effects ;)

				I&#039;d wager it&#039;s LSD.&nbsp; I mean the kids were really young, and they drank whatever was left of a VIAL of acid.&nbsp; And didn&#039;t die?&nbsp; Pretty sure an epic dose like that would be lethal for such young kids if it was say, 25i.&nbsp; Foaming at the mouth could happen in kids that young, especially at such a heavy dose.&nbsp; Either way I can&#039;t imagine the experience being pleasant.&nbsp; At least they both survived.

				It would be interesting to see if it affects their development over time. <br /><br />Surely i&#039;m not advocating experimenting with drugs on children, but since it already happened, i would be interested to see if the incident has any effects on their future mental development.

				Yeah, it would be interesting to see how they turn out. The sample size is too small to draw robust conclusions, but that&#039;s usually what you get with &quot;accidental&quot; experiments that are unethical to perform otherwise, like the few gender reassignment surgeries that occurred in the 1970s and told us something about the biological determination of gender identity.

				Oh, i&#039;m sure it will not be enough to state anything about the effects of lsd exposure during childhood at an academic level.<br /><br />The anecdotal value will still be there - exposure to lsd can do nothing for these kids, or perhaps they end up messed up for life - we will see in a decade i suppose ;)

How negligent can you get for your 7 and 10 year old to not have that lesson? =/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Amen brother. Then they go and make it this public slander show for LSD. *sighs*

				Actually though﻿ LSD has been used on children suffering from schizophrenia and autism with very positive results...<br /><br />But anyway, just put this phrase &quot;Children on LSD&quot; on youtube do get what you want :)

That is sad, and really frightening.
