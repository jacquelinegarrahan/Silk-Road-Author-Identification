				Would it be stupid to take 1/2 hit?&nbsp; I realize there are many factors like dosage, individual person, etc.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t taken LSD since the 70s,&nbsp; and I am a little apprehensive just because it is has been a long time, and to be honest, I am now old.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; &nbsp;So I am thinking of starting with 1/2 hit. I am mainly after the euphoria anyway.&nbsp; Had anyone done this, and if so, is it worth it?&nbsp; I did read on Blue Light where a few people posted that is their favorite dose and a few others said they they had the best night at work ever with 1/2 dose. lol&nbsp; <br /><br />What do you think, SR friends?

				I like taking a half hit.&nbsp; Last time I did it, a friend and I only split a single tab and had a good time (dosage was probably 110-120) and a solid trip.<br />Try a half and wait an hour or two then decide if you want more or not! :)

				Not stupid at all. The effects of LSD vary greatly with dosage. Half a hit will give you a nice buzz, make you very social, and you&#039;ll probaly laugh a lot ;D Its not enough for a full-on religious experience or anything, but it doesn&#039;t sound like that&#039;s what you&#039;re after anyways.<br /><br />You&#039;ll have a great time! Enjoy!!

				I am pretty sensitive to LSD and have found that half a hit is perfect for being out in public and not acting too strange or feeling especially paranoid. I have added other substances after a few hours if I don&#039;t feel it&#039;s strong enough and that has worked out quite well.

				Well, I ended up doing the 1/2, and I am very glad I did not take the entire hit.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; I had a pleasant time with LOTS of laughs, but I think this will be my final trip (remember, I am old, lol).&nbsp; My oldest son left me alone in the car at the grocery store, and I decided it would be a great idea to text my middle son.&nbsp; I&nbsp; was laughing so hard (yes, by myself, well, with my dog and he just gave up on me and sighed&nbsp; and fell asleep on the floor of the car, probably thinking: crazy lady, lol) that I could not really see what the hell I was writing and my texts auto spelled some pretty strange and&nbsp; funny messages.&nbsp; I apologized for being &quot;silly,&quot; and he told me that is the name of the person who had the LSD: &quot;Silly.&quot;&nbsp; lol!&nbsp; &nbsp;I won&#039;t go into the details, but let&#039;s just say that I had fun, could not sleep worth shit when I wanted to go to sleep, but all in all, it was an experience that brought me back to old times but probably will not do again just because it is so damn intense.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for all your responses.&nbsp; :)

				Thank you for sharing your wonderful experience.&nbsp; I myself haven&#039;t taken LSD in about 10 years and I have my very first SR order marked &quot;In Transit&quot; as of today for a 10 strip of White Fluff Blotter Paper.&nbsp; I am VERY excited to open up those door ways in my mind again.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking, did you do a lot of acid in the 60&#039;s &amp; 70&#039;s?&nbsp; What made you stop taking it so long ago?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;;D&nbsp; &nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D<br /><br />One Love!

				I did not do a lot of acid, but I did do it a few times in the 70s, lol.&nbsp; I guess I just mellowed after I had my children, and I was pretty &quot;straight edge&quot; while raising them.&nbsp; I stopped enjoying pot, it just put me to sleep, and I just spent more time with my family than I did partying, putting that all behind me. I must be experiencing my second &quot;teen hood&quot; now.&nbsp; haha!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope you enjoy your time with the &quot;spirit substance,&quot; as my son calls it.&nbsp; :)

				I like the euphoria and laughter, but I also like to always be very much in control of myself (which is probably why I don&#039;t care much for alcohol anymore,&nbsp; too).&nbsp; So the 1/2 was just right. <br /><br />I am probably a terrible example, because my son seeks the &quot;spiritual&quot; aspect, whereas I just want to have some fun.&nbsp; lol <br /><br />Glad you are making&nbsp; some summer memories, lol
