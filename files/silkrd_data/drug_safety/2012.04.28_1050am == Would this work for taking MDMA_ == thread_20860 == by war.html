				If you ordered a large batch of crystals and instead of cutting them down and putting them into pills you just measure out crystals between .1 and .2 and swallow those?<br /><br />Would hit your system right away and better than parachuting cause u have something easy to swallow...&nbsp; I havent seen this mentioned before but seems like possibly one of the better ways for taking MDMA.&nbsp; Any flaws in this system?&nbsp;

				Yep, it works. I always eat the crystals then quickly down a glass of water to get rid of the bitter taste. IT comes up slightly faster than the pills, but other than that there&#039;s no difference. The advantage, of course, is that you have much better control over your dose than with pills, and it&#039;s less likely to be cut with something else.

				I wonder why people bother capping it up when they&#039;re taking it themselves! Short of being at a fest or transporting it!

				Yes this method does work just put the crystals on your tongue and wash down my friend. :)<br /><br />I mainly do this method along with lines or dabbing under the tongue on the vein.

				Swallowing raw or parachuting is going to hit you at the same time, Its just with parachuting ,you don&#039;t have to taste that nasty shit, heh. That&#039;s why I do gelcaps or parachute.

				If you can handle under the tongue it&#039;ll hit you pretty fast.
