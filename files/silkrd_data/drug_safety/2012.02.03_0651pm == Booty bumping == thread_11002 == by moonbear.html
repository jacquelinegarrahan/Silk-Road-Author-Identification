				Today one of my friends recommended &quot;booty bumping&quot; I do not recommend this method of ingestion. Here&#039;s why.<br /><br />I wrapped up a joint, but today it was not going to be smoked. Oh no! Today it was going up my booty pipe. I made sure to empty my butt of all feces before trying this.\<br /><br />I gingerly shoved the joint up, making sure not to crush it so it would be comfortable in there. It began to sting slightly but I ignored it. I know how to take it like a man.<br /><br />I waited, and waited... and waited. Nothing! I was no mad steam came out my ears. I decided to poop it out. I had to unwrap it and dry it with my moms hair dryer. So now I had weed that had dried butt juice on it. Oh well, I thought, might as well get high. I lit it up, and it got me less high than usual. But oh well. Lesson learned. Maybe trolls came up with the retarded method of &quot;booty bumping.&quot; Who thought of shoving drugs up your ass anyway? A retard.

				Plugging (or &quot;booty bumping&quot;, as you call it) works with several drugs, so long as they can be absorbed by mucous membranes. Basically anything that can be snorted can be plugged. Obviously, this won&#039;t work for weed. But it works for most powder or liquid drugs, including alcohol. A friend of mine who works at an ER once told me of a girl who died from an alcohol OD because she and her boyfriend thought it would be a good idea to use alcohol gel as anal lube. As it turns out, the rate of absorption for alcohol up your butt is several times larger than when you ingest it. Such is life. And death, in her case.

				By the way (since you&#039;ve expressed interest elsewhere), I wouldn&#039;t get any ideas about putting ketamine up your butthole. Depending on the route of administration, different amounts of drug yield different effects and plugging Kate is a waste of product.<br /><br />For a k-hole, which is the highest plateau of ketamine effects, and probably what you&#039;re after, intramuscular injection will get you there with between 50 and 70mg, depending on your body weight.<br />If you&#039;re gonna snort it, you need between 200 and 350mg for the same effects.<br />Plugging will get you to the k-hole at about 400mg.<br />Finally, if you eat, parachute or drink (in a solution) the ketamine, you&#039;re looking at a minimum of 600mg for the same effects. They&#039;ll last a bit longer, but you&#039;ll also be puking your guts out and have a two- to three-day hangover. It also tastes nastier than anything else I&#039;ve put into my mouth, and this is coming from someone who has eaten the fetus of four different species of animals as a delicacy.

				Stop trolling us. <br /><br />If you are indeed being serious, and I am using all my self control to not type in all caps here, why the fuck do you not research any and all new ways that you plan on ingesting a drug. You not only lack common sense, but are out right stupid if you do not research what you are going to do before doing it.&nbsp; Shoving a fucking joint up your ass thinking that you will get high? Seriously? You don&#039;t know that THC requires heat (and not butt heat) to be activated? Please, stop browsing this forum and go research all drugs that you are interested. You should spend a week on each drug. <br /><br />I&#039;m convinced, by the way that your posts are getting more and more outlandish after this whole school and address thing, that you are trolling us.&nbsp; Please tell me that your avatar pic is actually you.

				Are you serious? LOL. LOLLLL.<br /><br />I booty bump things all the time but as with any time you do a drug you have to do research. Plugging is advantageous because often, rectal BA is higher, but it isn&#039;t always. Weed being a prime example (where I imagine rectal BA is about... nada). I don&#039;t know anything about weed and I have half the sense not to stick it up my butt.

The THC are not soluble in water, but are easily soluble in fat, that&#039;s how you make marijuana butter. Even wikipedia have article on this. But the weed required is too large and uneconomical. And you might end up getting stoned and crapping in your pants in same time, if the method works :D

				moonbear, your SR&#039;s version of the boy who cried wolf. But the wolf came early in your story and was you being genuinely stupid. You got the attention of everyone by being such a dumbass and now desperately try and redeem it by trolling a bit (crying wolf) and muddying the waters.<br /><br />the whole saying &quot;obvious troll is obvious&quot; would be clearly apparent in a shit load of your posts. But then, you counter this with a real sublime indication of your genuine stupidity.<br /><br />Ive come to the conclusion, your the rain man of trolls. Kudos.<br />
