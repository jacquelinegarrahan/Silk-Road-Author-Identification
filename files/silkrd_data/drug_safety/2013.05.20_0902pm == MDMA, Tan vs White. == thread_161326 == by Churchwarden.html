				ayo drug people,<br /><br />I know it has probably been said before but the search function is being seriously uncooperative for me right now, just keep getting this &#039;your last search was less than 5 seconds ago&#039; bug no matter what I do. I could use the extra posts anyhow.<br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering, in terms of potency, different trip types or lengths, health implications or any other difference there might be between tan and white MDMA?<br /><br />I&#039;ve never really known and if we can&#039;t come here to learn then WHAT&#039;S THIS ALL ABOUT ANYWAY.<br /><br />EXCELSIOR.

				The color is really not indicative of the length of experience, how clean the experience is, what kind of side effects there are, how strong/potent it is, or how harmful it is. All the color means is that there are impurities present in product, which could be slightly harmful (though not really in the amounts one takes when dosing) or not harmful at all. But I believe there could still be impurities even if its white. In my experience, white mdma tends to feel less physically jarring but this may just be the particular batches I&#039;ve had vs. colored batches that were maybe somewhat exhausting, though still potent. I&#039;ve had colored mdma that felt very clean with as little side effects as white. <br /><br />In general though, white mdma typically means that it has been washed properly so many of the impurities are gone.<br /><br />

				Oh okay, thanks for the quick reply. This actually helps a lot in some decisions I was making for purchases.
