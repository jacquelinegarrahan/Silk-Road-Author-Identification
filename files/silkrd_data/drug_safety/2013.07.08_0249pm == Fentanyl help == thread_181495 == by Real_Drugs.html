				I have recently acquired a 50 mg fentanyl patch, which I would like to use recreationally. I have no experience with the substance, no real opiate tolerance (I dable with Oxycontin every so often, a standard dose for me being 15-30 mg). I am wondering what&nbsp; a good dose would be and what ROA to use, as well as any other relevant information.<br /><br />Thanks.

				fentanyl patches i remember those :)<br />be careful tho<br />When i was younger i used to buy those 50 mcg&nbsp; patches.<br />I would put a tiny bit of the gel on a piece of tinfoil and roll up a dollar bill and put the dollar in my mouth and hold it over the foil and light the foil and inhale the vapors. <br />Be very careful with fentanyl, if you have no tolerance, theres enough fentanyl in that patch to kill you. One of those 50 mcg patches can probably kill 10 ppl. that shit is strong.<br />Whichever ROA you choose, start off small! you can always take more if you dont feel it strong enough

				The best thing to do with fentanyl patches is to sell them to some poor bastard with a tolerance &amp; then go buy something harder to OD on. ;)<br /><br />Seriously, be careful. Fentanyl is dosed in micrograms (0.001 milligrams), not mgs - it&#039;s orders of magnitude stronger than other opiates.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a 50 milligram patch you&#039;ve got - it&#039;s a 50 micrograms-per-hour patch. <br /><br />Because of the delivery method, there&#039;s much more fentanyl in each patch than the dosage level it shows. Most 50 mcg/hr patches have around 8400 mcg of fentanyl in them - the exact amt depends on the brand.&nbsp; sofish89 is right tho - 8400 mcg is four or five times the lethal dose for an adult male. <br /><br />At least make sure you have someone there with you when you try.

				Thanks for the replies, I apreciate the information. But could someone please tell me specifically how much is a recommended dose? like 1/4 or an 1/8 of the tab etc..

				If I can chime in, I&#039;d like to ask if these patches can be cut up into pieces and applied to the skin? I have no idea how strong the stuff will hit me, and i have a job that I can&#039;t ever skip out on. I don&#039;t want to be blasted off my head and nodding out. I&#039;m a many years user of oxycodone, 80-120 mg a day for more than 5 years. There&#039;s no way I&#039;d slap the whole patch on my skin and see what happens. I&#039;ve seen a fentanyl overdose, it terrified me. I just wanna know if I can buy a patch and test it out after cutting it up with scissors?

If you cut it you lose control of the built-in dosing mechanism. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In a case recently reported to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), a physician instructed staff from a hospice health care agency to cut a 50 mcg/h fentanyl transdermal system patch in half and apply it to a patient to deliver a 25 mcg/h dose.<br /><br />Soon thereafter, a visiting nurse discovered the cut patch, immediately removed it, and called the agency to notify the physician about the risk of an overdose with this practice and to request a supply of 25 mcg/h patches.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The risk depends a little on the type of the patch. The Duragesics will leak like crazy &amp; you&#039;ll get the whole dose at once, the Novartis ones use a newer system so are a little safer. You&#039;re much less likely to OD from an undamaged patch - they&#039;re designed to release the drug slowly over time &amp; in most cases it would take a while for you to even feel anything. <br /><br />@Real_Drugs: 1/4th or 1/8th? Did you read what I wrote about dosing?&nbsp; ??? You&#039;re making me nervous. <br /><br />If you&#039;re opiate naive, you probably want to start w/ 100 mcg &amp; go up from there. Look at the wrapper &amp; find the total amt of fentanyl in the patch - it should be around 8300 mcg or so - and then figure out how many pieces you&#039;ll need to evenly divide the patch into to get 100 mcg in each of them. If it&#039;s a 50 mcg/hr patch you&#039;ll need around 80 little pieces, but check the label to be sure. Once you&#039;ve done the math, carefully cut the patch into those pieces, making sure they&#039;re all the same size. <br /><br />100 mcg of chewed (chew it &amp; press it under your tongue to be absorbed) fentanyl should be about the same potency as the low end of your Oxycontin dose. (If you smoke it, it&#039;ll be twice as strong). The rest I assume you can figure out yourself. <br /><br /><br />

				Thanks a lot Lorimer +1,<br />By 1/4 or 1/8 I meant as an example of how much, not what I actually think, I&#039;ll start off with 1/50th. How long does it last and what is the best way to smoke it?

Carefully. sofish89&#039;s description above is pretty easy to follow. If you&#039;ve ever smoked those original ocers it&#039;s the same straw &amp; tinfoil technique. Try chewing it first, tho, just to see how you respond. <br /><br />The high depends on the ROA. If you smoke it the rush is really quick &amp; euphoric, w/ maybe a 15 min glow afterwards. If you chew/hold it under your tongue you&#039;ll probably start feeling it at about 15 min w/ the high lasting closer to an hour.&nbsp; <br /><br />***IMPORTANT ***&nbsp; &nbsp;Fentanyl will stay in your system &amp; continue to affect your CNS &amp; respiration long after you stop feeling it. It&#039;s why smoking it is so dangerous - the high will pass so you&#039;ll do another hit (&amp; another &amp; another &amp; another) &amp; even tho you feel as though you&#039;re taking the same careful dose, in reality the drug is accumulating in your body &amp; increasing your risk of respiratory arrest. <br /><br />Last tip - Fentanyl can cause pretty severe nausea, esp you&#039;re not used to it. If you start feeling sick while smoking it, stop. Not all fentanyl ODs are due to respiratory arrest &amp; choking on your own vomit is not a sexy way to go. <br />

				Thanks, I really don&#039;t like smoking with foil so I might put it in a glass pipe. I&#039;m going to try wait a few days for the OC to be out my system (no tolerance) and test out the fent.
