				Take a few deep breaths, lay down, and sip on some water. Everything will be alright, you&#039;re going to be just fine. Panic attacks are common with MDPV, so just relax and be rest assured that it will be over soon. :)

				How much did you take? Did you combine it with anything else? How much do you weigh?<br /><br />How long ago did you dose and with what method?<br /><br />Chances are, you&#039;ll be fine unless you took a rediciously high hero dose. If you have benzos or benadryl, nows the time to take it. <br /><br />Call up a buddy and ask if he has xanax, diazepam, zolpidem, ect if you don&#039;t have any. <br /><br />Sleep is your friend. Just make sure breathing and heart rate isn&#039;t sporadic. <br /><br /><br />DONT stress yourself out. You will give you self a panic attack. 99% of the time, problems from slight OD&#039;s/high doses are more from your perceived problems rather than actual medical issues. If your resting heart rate is about twice your average for a extended amount of time, 1-2 hours, seek professional help. <br /><br /><br />We&#039;re here to help, not judge.<br /><br /><br />In fact, I just took around 100mg of JWH-018 last night, has a slight OD, threw up this morning, and am already feeling better. <br /><br />You live and you learn. <br />

				Try to take a quick nap. <br /><br />What I do to calm me down, listen to Italian music...<br /><br />My personal favorite is Andre Borcelli <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=andrea+bocelli<br /><br />Also, instrumentals work great, like the lord of the rings soundtrack. Any orchestra music is great for your mood. <br /><br />Since you took a valium, THE RIGHT THING TO DO :),&nbsp; the thing to make sure to monitor is your heart rate. Make sure it isn&#039;t sporatic. Benzos and uppers tend to counter act each other sometimes. <br /><br />Example: -bump-bump-bump-bump(double beat in the same amount of time in a regular beat)-bump-bump-bump-bump-bump-bump(double beat)-bump-bump-bump-bump<br /><br />Also, lay off weed/other drugs besides natural stuff, usually increases anxiety. <br /><br />Post any other symptoms that you might find to be weird/out of the ordinary. <br /><br />From the sound of it, you had a small anxiety attack. You will be fine. <br /><br />Stay safe :)

				I always hated MDPV, found it *extremely* addictive and it gave me mad compulsions to re-dose.... I also always had crazy heart palpitations for hours after I&#039;d come down off of the initial high. Nasty stuff, peevee.

				When I get &#039;over&#039; jacked, like coke or amphetamines or hell, any of&#039;em, I find the best thing is to get a washcloth, and wet it, and then lay down, wipe my face, and focus on my breathing...even a minimum amount of basic yoga is handy in these situations, just breath in, then breath out, listening to the breath, and waving at the crazy thoughts as you sail on by them...breath in.....breath out....ommmmmmm...I meditate on some huge pine trees I saw down in southern argentina while my breathing gets somoother and somoother.....<br /><br />It&#039;s all cool, and it will all be cool......

				I would like to second what phubaiblues said in regard to the breathing.<br /><br />I used to smoke a good bit o rock, and occasionally I would find myself going a little too hard and it felt like my heart was trying to beat the shit out of my rib cage.<br /><br />When that happened, I would lie down and fixate on one spot on the ceiling while breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth.&nbsp; I would usually count my breaths and by the time i got to 100 or less, everything would be back to normal and the guilt for doing too much coke would set in. However, no amount of breathing would get rid of that.<br /><br />Hope this helps

				I&#039;m not quite sure how I feel about MDPV.&nbsp; Have a decent amount on me, so I just tried it for the first time the other day.&nbsp; Probably did too much.&nbsp; The first snort was a tiny little bump.&nbsp; Then I did a TINY baby line after about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Then another one probably 10 minutes later.&nbsp; All together, I think I took 10-20mg of it.&nbsp; It was nice, but I thought the superfocus part was supposed to last longer?&nbsp; I felt overstimulated, hyperfocused, slightly euphoric for 2-3 hours, then just shitty for the rest of the day, and even had some negative thought patterns the following day (which is unusual for me).&nbsp; I can see why people have problems redosing.&nbsp; Also, the comedown lasts forever and is pretty dysphoric.&nbsp; My heartbeat was 135 bpm resting hours after coming down.&nbsp; I think I will give it a shot another day when I am more rested, and this time definitely not smoke a whole fucking joint.&nbsp; Probably will take less as well.&nbsp; I also realized that nicotine on MDPV makes it feel as if your heart is going to be ejected from your chest.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll wait till I have a benzo for the comedown.

				thanks for the advice guys....i&#039;m all good now, had a few beers and that helped me get my grip, i feel great now....i&#039;m not sure what the fuck happened to me as i consider myself a pretty experienced drug user.. but i have never freaked out that bad.&nbsp; The thing that really scared me was the dizzyness associated with it.....like i was so lightheaded i could have gone to sleep and my muscles were all clenching up so tight that i was walking all weird and shit...could hardly function ... it was fucking weird.&nbsp; I had done mdpv before but nothing like this shit.....thanks again...i&#039;m gonna delete this topic in the morning...I&#039;ll still be up i&#039;m sure.&nbsp; perhaps i should stick with meth!!

				This wasn&#039;t really uncommon for me..Although I never got it *as* bad as OP did, I noticed MDPV to have such a ridiculous dose curve that it wasn&#039;t worth it at all dabbling in it. One line you&#039;d be happy(ish), feeling real speedy, do a quarter of what you just did and you&#039;d be nauseous, on the floor, waiting to come down. Can&#039;t really recall a time that I really enjoyed the stuff. Eventually threw my 2g bag away, was way too moreish for a not so great feeling.

				Sounds like you just did a bit too much too quick OP. Glad to see you sorted yaself out. <br /><br />MDPV is a fucker of a drug though, I wont do it because I just find horrible. Smaller doses in future. It&#039;s ok to do this anyway because it teaches you to be more careful in the future. <br /><br />

				it&#039;s amazing how common of a reaction this is on MDPV.&nbsp; happened to me my second time doing it, and third, and forth, and fifth..&nbsp; the xanax had too short a duration to cover the whole panic attack...like it would literally start up after 2 hours.&nbsp; i needed a longer lasting benzo.&nbsp; <br />then i had a someone close to me flush the vial.&nbsp; never touched it again..&nbsp; ::shudder:;&nbsp; i know it sucked but wanted to do it every day.&nbsp; <br /><br />i like the euphoria though.&nbsp; it was clean, light-headed, empathogenic...&nbsp; made me love people.&nbsp; but my body was weak and wracked..&nbsp; i had to move slowly or else my chest would pop.&nbsp; <br />blah.&nbsp; glad u made it through!&nbsp; reading the post made me shake a bit&nbsp; <br /><br />*destiny*<br />
