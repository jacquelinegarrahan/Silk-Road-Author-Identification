				So here is the deal. I recently bought an oz of mushrooms from a vendor. They were cheap so I figured it was good deal and got them. Apparently too good to be true. So when they got here everything looked good and I finalized. I opened up the bag yesterday and half the oz are the stems and caps and the other half are like the bottom half of the stems that grow in the cakes and that half seems to have this white fuzz growing on almost every single piece and I&#039;ve also noticed grey fuzz growing through the inside of the stems. There are also little black baby mushroom feteses growing off the bottom of these closer to where the bottom part is. I messaged the seller and he assured me this is fine. Basically my question is, is this normal and are these safe to eat?

				It sounds like the vendor is a tad cheap and to add more weight he included some of the spawn cake.&nbsp; Those little black baby mushroom fetuses are aborts, and they are strong.&nbsp; I mean like way stronger than you are used to best mushroom trip of my life was off of two grams of aborts.&nbsp; I would clip them off of the cake as that just tastes like rot and has very little psilocybin in it.&nbsp;

				Yeah, call me crazy, but when I&#039;m buying an ounce of mushrooms I&#039;m trying to buy stems and caps.... not stems, caps, and roots. So is it safe to eat? I don&#039;t think I can sell it, who the hell wants to buy mushroom roots??

				Yea I agree with you, that sounds like some dirty trick a kid would try to pull to increase the weight.&nbsp; The spawn is safe to eat but I have no idea why you would want to it contains almost no active chemicals.&nbsp; Make sure you clip the aborts off tho there the best part of growing mushrooms.&nbsp;

				Well I messaged back the seller so hopefully it can be worked out. To be honest I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be happy with anything other than him resending me 14gs of caps and stems to make up for the spawn. Hope it all works out. If not I&#039;ll be sure to name to vendor so others know to stay away.

				Dan: I was very happy with Ragura&#039;s powdered/capped mushrooms. Just the ease of dosing, plus they look like supplements for easy transport/stealth. Nice potency.

I like to see what I&#039;m eating :D but BreezeTheGnome has never done me wrong and he has a very potent and rare strain so I&#039;ll stick with him. I still haven&#039;t gotten a response back from the vendor yet. Fingers crossed.

				hi,<br /><br />firstly are they dried or fresh?<br /><br />as HCeline said the aborts are fine, and super strong! thats why its better to dry and grind the shrooms up so the dosage is consistant in my opinion.<br /><br />unless there is a problem with the grow the white fuzz generally comes from the last flush when the mycelium is getting old and tends to grow up the stems, its not very nice, i dont sell it, but it wont do you any harm. the weight of the fuzz will be very small though so you wont have lost much product because of it.<br /><br />the stringy stuff, or roots, is probably where the shrooms have been picked not quite so carefully as they could have been, its likely just the surface of the mycelium around where the shroom was growing. again it wont do you any harm, but i wouldn&#039;t leave it on mine. apart from making your shrooms look unappealing it damages the surface of the mycelium unnecessarily and it will likely have a detrimental effect on recovery time and future flushes.<br /><br />the grey fuzz up the middle of the stem is not uncommon and isnt really anything to worry about. are they slightly wrinkly looking?<br /><br />so yeah, overall they&#039;re fine to eat, just not so pretty maybe.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />UKshrooms

The shrooms in question are dried and they don&#039;t really look wrinkled. This is just the first time I&#039;ve ever gotten that when ordering shrooms. You being a mushroom vendor what do you think about the practice of filling half the ounce up with that stuff? It still has dirt on it from being picked btw but that&#039;s not really a big deal. Am I in the right to be asking for another 14 grams of caps and stems?

				I hand loaded his order myself and he got 18-19g of large caps/stems and the rest in smaller and 2g worth of aborts. He complained in his messages like all the mushrooms were COVERED in mold and were unsafe to consume and said i packed in a bunch of dirt. We reasonably clean off the mushrooms but pull them in bulk so yes some bits can make it in. That combined with shipping breaks them up some and makes a bit of shake that combines in with that....... Just make tea with the portion as we can&#039;t make every oz Pristine &quot;bag appeal&quot; quality for you to resale with a 1oz order which is what you complained about is using them for resale. 1oz is considered retail and we pack retail type order for you. I will not be sending you a 1/2 oz of mushrooms as by the way you handled the situation, you are uneducated about the product you ordered and should not be selling it to others anyway. I have no problem defending what I sold you and would send it again in a heart beat as we have sent that exact type bag out to many others with 0 complaints. Sorry to sound a dick but you accused me of selling you something that was dangerous to yours and others health without researching shit so I can&#039;t believe your opinion on &quot;bag appeal&quot; or the acceptable amount of shake in an oz of mushrooms that traveled MANY states away to you by a shipping company that doesn&#039;t give a shit about your package despite my best efforts to pack them well.

I have been nothing but cordial with you the whole time man. I was trying to work this out through pm&#039;s and specifically didn&#039;t want to mention anyones name in the forums because like I said I am uneducated on mushroom growing techniques, hense this thread. Not once did I say anything the amount of shake or the dirt on it, I was just curious why you sent me a half ounce of roots. Never once did I ask for coins back, never once did I ask for a reship. I was simply asking about it in this thread to see if others thought that would be appropriate of me. And as far as researching things that might be dangerous to other people&#039;s health... that&#039;s why I started this thread, to see if it was even safe to eat the white and grey stiff that was growing on your mushrooms, which apparently its safe. Strangely enough I&#039;ve been doing mushrooms for 10+ years and never HAD to research any of this. I could be 100% wrong, though. Like I said all this fuzz and root stuff is new to me.<br /><br />&quot;Sorry to sound a dick but you accused me of selling you something that was dangerous to yours and others health without researching shit&quot;<br />I never accused you of anything ??? I was simply asking you questions about the product you sold me. <br /><br />&quot;He complained in his messages like all the mushrooms were COVERED in mold and were unsafe to consume and said i packed in a bunch of dirt.&quot;<br />I never said all of them were covered I said only the ones with the roots on the bottom part of it by where the aborts were. And the thing about the dirt that was the very first message I had sent you before I even realized they were roots, I was just curious why there was dirt on them because that was the first time someone had ever sent roots with aborts when I ordered shrooms. I wasn&#039;t insinuating you packed in grams of dirt to make it heavier.<br /><br />&nbsp;But I&#039;ll post a picture and people can judge for themselves. I really don&#039;t want to discuss this any further until people can actually see what I&#039;m talking about. So much for friendliness and customer service :(<br /><br />EDIT* I think this whole thing could have been easily avoided if you would have just put in the item listing description that it would come with the aborts on the roots.

If he posts up crumbles or something jacked up I will call foul on him and nothing more will come from this situation. He and I have already messaged back and forth and have decided to agree to disagree. He is satisfied with bad mouthing us when WE have been cordial as well with him. When someone doesn&#039;t realize the white and gray &quot;mold&quot; at the bottom is extra mycelium, then no I do not trust their judgement on that drug or selling it to others which is the only direct criticism I gave to this person being incompetent. We have shipped out hundreds of oz&#039;s with this and one other complaint under our belt. I even gave him an accurate eta message and thank you note for his order before he ever contacted us. We are professionals and will defend ourselves as well.<br /><br /><br />You seemed to cherry pick my message so I will cherry pick yours as well to show how you don&#039;t know anything about mushrooms.<br /><br />&quot;Especially since the roots hold the most moisture and weigh the most.&quot;<br />You act as if the SMALL amount of substrate stuck to the bottom of the few mushrooms it was on adds up to a huge weight...... As if I sent you WET substrate. And no it doesn&#039;t hold the most moisture as the fruit body is 90% moisture. You got your weight and I am done with you.
