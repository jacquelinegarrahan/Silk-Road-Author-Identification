				&nbsp;I have used various IR oxycodone for years but the fact that it is expensive coupled with the pharmacy industry&#039;s crusade to make abuse proof pills has pushed me to want to make a change.&nbsp; My idea is to buy in bulk east coast brown/#4 powder and convert it into purified Diacetylmorphine soluble salt/ heroin HCL.&nbsp; Getting rid of all the crap and cuts by doing so.<br /><br />&nbsp;I plan on using a metered nasal spray bottle with sterile water&nbsp; to take the heroin the most efficient way without dealing with needles.&nbsp; Now regular heroin base (brown powder) my understanding your can snort because the mucus membrane is slightly acidic.&nbsp; But I want this to be as efficient and pure as it would be as if it was made by a pharmaceutical company.&nbsp; Or at least as close as reasonably I can get it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now heroin especially in its soluble salt form is hydrolyse and it will react with the water and convert to morphine over time.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t want to make up big batches by putting whole grams of H in a solution.&nbsp; Rather I plan on doing it in say 100mgs to 1ml of water at a time.&nbsp; I think a good dose of the IM method admission is about a dose of 20mgs at a time (I have always started with a match head sized dose of powder when tooting H).&nbsp; It would be a daily chore to mix this up and I am thinking about a fabricating a tiny measuring spoon that holds about 100mgs of the heroin hcl for convenience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any feedback anyone has please let me know.&nbsp; The government terribly oppresses and demonizes opiate users who are just pursuing our god given right to pursue chemical happiness.&nbsp; Harm reduction and information is our greatest asset in fighting back against the war on drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Below are a couple of TEKs I found on purifying heroin:<br /><br />####-TEK-1#################################################<br />How to Purify Street Heroin<br />Heroin purification to nearly USP<br />by Steve J. Quest [squest@moonwatcher.avrtech.com]<br />from alt.drugs, Wed May 18, 1994<br /><br />[Erowid Note: We&#039;ve received notes saying that following this procedure with street &quot;heroin&quot; that contains fentanyl or other non-heroin psychoactives could result in a substance that would be dangerous to use. One primary concern is that substances more potent than heroin such as fentanyl could be concentrated so that the resulting material would be far too strong. This purification process should not be used for street &quot;heroin&quot; that contains other substances. It is for the purification of actual heroin (diacetyl morphine) not to separate heroin from other psychoactive chemicals. See the notes below for additional comments about this issue.]<br /><br />This is as complete and as accurate as I can remember, it has been something like 9 years since I have used heroin. The process I used for purification was straight forward. Diacetylmorphine can exist in two forms, an insoluble base, or a soluble salt. Often it contained a plethera of other agents like pieces of broken glass, pieces of foil, dirt, wood, metal, mannitol, lactose, maltose, sand, you get the idea. The first stage of the process I used was to make sure the diacetylmorphine I received was totally converted to a soluble hydrochloride salt. The heroin I usually received was a brown powdered heroin, sometimes off white, very little vinegar smell. Today all you can find is a black crud that reeks with a vinegar (acetic) odor. The way I made sure it was a soluble salt was to drop enough 28% hydrochloric acid to make it wet. This insured that I would not waste any of the available drug, but would remove most if not all of the cut. I think that it would be better for me to detail it in a procedural manner. FYI, hydrochloric acid can be purchased in gallon jugs at hardware stores under the name Muriatic acid, 28%.<br /><br />First weigh out one gram of heroin from the stock you received from your supplier. Place this gram into a 13 x 100mm test tube. Add a few drops of 28% hydrochloric acid until it is evenly damp. Allow to react for a minute or two. Next add 5 ml distilled water, place your thumb over the end and carefully shake to dissolve all that will dissolve into the water. Allow the insolubles to settle. Using a pipette, remove and transfer as much of the liquid to a fresh test tube leaving the solids behind. Dispose of the undissolved remains in the first test tube. Slowly add via pipette, one drop at at time, ammonium hydroxide (water clear household ammonia) until the white precipitate ceases production. Add several more drops at this point just to be sure. Shake gently to be sure that all the solution is evenly ammoniated. The solution should look milky. Now add 100 ml ethyl ether (some kinds of diesel starting fluids, read the label) to a 150 ml beaker. Dump the milky liquid into the ether and stir briskly and allow the water to settle and collect on the bottom. The water will turn clear. Using a glass pipette, remove this water from the bottom of the beaker and dispose of.<br /><br />Now mix up a solution of 5ml 28% hydrochloric acid and 5ml distilled water and add this to the ether in the beaker. Stir briskly keeping as much acid/water suspended as possible for several minutes. Allow the water/acid to collect on the bottom of the beaker. Using a glass pipette, remove this water layer from the bottom of the ether and transfer to a glass petri dish. Transfer the ether back to its storage bottle for reuse. It will still contain small amounts of heroin base, so don&#039;t throw it out. Recycle! Slowly add small portions of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the water/acid solution in the petri until you don&#039;t notice any more bubbles being formed. Place the glass on a warm surface, and allow to evaporate. The residue will be diacetylmorphine hydrochloride and salt. Table salt is a by-product of the reaction and will not hurt you at all when injected. Scrape up the residue and weigh it. Yield from one gram of smack (yea, we called it that) would be anything from 100 to 300 mg, rarely more. Place 100 mg of this powder in a test tube, add 10 cc sterile isotonic water for injection (available OTC at drug stores) and heat to boiling. Transfer this liquid while still hot using a syringe (available OTC at some drug stores) to a 10 ml rubber stoppered empty sterile ampoule (available OTC at drug stores).<br /><br />To use this drug which is 10 mg/ml, extract with a sterile syringe as much drug as you wish to use. 10 mg would send me flying believe it or not. 2.5 mg (1/4 cc) was usually enough to keep me &quot;happy&quot; and was my normal dose. 20 mg was the most I could take safely in my opinion, and was a waste of drug and money. Normally, for most 150-170 lb males, 2.5 mg is more than enough in my opinion. Using heroin in this manner avoids the problems associated with &quot;street use&quot; and will keep your body healthy and safe, reducing the risk of disease and overdosage.<br /><br />My memory is pretty good, and I think I covered all the bases here, but I may have made a mistake somewhere. Overall I think this is an accurate method, to the best of my ability to remember.<br /><br />Notes #<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; April 2009: D&#039;s Note : As a chemist who has dealt with fentanyl, I wanted to comment on the issue of whether this is a dangerous procedure to use on street &quot;heroin&quot; that actually contains fentanyl.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Plain fentanyl should *not* convert to anything dangerous via the procedure listed. Unless the high or low pH values associated with the procedure were coupled with prolonged exposure to heat, no modification of fentanyl should occur. Nothing dangerous would be generated, to the best of my knowledge.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If the product is a fentanyl analogue like sufentanil, I am unsure of what may happen to some of the more fragile aromatic rings upon exposure to strong acid or base, but I would still assume that nothing *dangerous* would occur.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; However, if the &quot;heroin&quot; did contain fentanyl, two problems would arise trying to use this procedure. First, the hydrochloride salt of fentanyl is insoluble in water, and the extraction procedure would be useless as in several steps the desired product would be discarded. Second, the amount of fentanyl in such a mixture would be very small, probably something like 10 mg in a gram of stree *heroin*. This would be exceedingly hard for a novice chemist to extract, and even harder to use properly.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, if a user suspects they have fentanyl (a short lived high, less euphoria, very white powder, etc), *I* would suggest they not try this approach. For regular heroin I would highly recommend it. Several details about this could be verified by reading Siegfried&#039;s &quot;Synthesis of Fentanyl&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Jan 2008 : BS&#039;s Note : If we supose than street heroin could be fenantyl+filler excipient to dilute and reduce the potency at the heroin level and we eliminate the filler, it would be posible to suffer an overdose taking the purified fenantyl. So before the purification we must be sure than we have heroin and not fenantyl with TLC or colometry test.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand this purification technique is only valid to eliminate non-alkaloid fillers/cuttings. If the &#039;heroin&#039; contains caffeine, morphine, codeine, cocaine or other alkaloids, those will will pass through the purification process with heroin because those react similarly to heroin in an acid base extraction.<br /><br />####-TEK-2#################################################<br />[Editor&#039;s Note: The following method for purifying street heroin comes to us from a once infamous clandestine heroin chemist who has &quot;gone straight&quot;. He has asked to remain anonymous for obvious reasons. He also asked that we be very clear that this recipe explains a serious chemical process with the resulting risks: (1) accidents made during process could cause harm in the form of explosions, toxic vapors, and unknown other threats to the safety of the would-be chemist and those in close proximity; (2) even if performed exactly as written, this recipe will not increase the quantity, only the quality of what was already there; (3) the very act of using this recipe breaks drug manufacturing laws (along with many others besides) that can result in multi-year prison sentences and even death as punishment. The recipe is provided for educational purposes only--and as such, it will likely be quite useful to students of beginning organic chemistry.]<br /><br />I was curious about the procedure for cleaning street heroin [that is on your site: Purifying Heroin]. Most of my practical laboratory experience was with various opiates, street, pharmaceutical or self made, so this is definitely something that I know about. In fact I purified some street heroin for a friend of mine one day. It requires only a little knowledge of basic organic extraction technique.<br /><br />This is what I did:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Dissolve the street heroin in water.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Use the easily available Hydrion pH papers to monitor the pH during this procedure. Add Sodium Hydroxide in solution dropwise while checking the pH. Use a narrow glass or plastic rod to touch a minimum of the drug solution to the paper to avoid loss. Stop when the pH reaches about 9.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Extract with chloroform. Chloroform is far superior to diethyl ether in that it is non-flammable and does not present storage problems, where explosive peroxides can be formed. Note: Chloroform is an ideal solvent for heroin, codeine, and most other opiates, with the major exception of morphine which requires a mixed solvent.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Separate the chloroform layer and wash with a minimum quantity of cold water: 1-2 ml works well. Evaporate the chloroform taking care not to burn the residue on the bottom of the beaker. Note: Chloroform is a known carcinogen, so plenty of ventilation (and a respirator) would be advisable. The chloroform is so volatile that this step is actually quite easy to perform.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Add a dilute solution of HCl dropwise while stirring with a glass rod. Monitor the pH closely. As the acid is being added, the diacetyl morphine base is being neutralized and converted into the water-soluble hydrochloride salt form.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When all the solid material has just dissolved, stop adding the HCl. I found that this takes place around pH 5-6. Note: If one tries to bring the pH all of the way up to 7, the free base alkaloid precipitates back out requiring addition of more HCl.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The resulting solution will be in an injectable form; it will now be completely clear with no colored impurities or particulate matter.<br /><br />Having clarified this procedure, I would hope that nobody would actually attempt it. To an experienced chemist this is all so routine that you could do it blindfolded. But I noticed that even the college students in my Organic lab class, who had no prior organic chemistry experience, were remarkably clueless around a separatory funnel the first time. This is to say that what is trivial in the hands of an experienced chemist will likely be unusable (at best) and dangerous (at worst) in the hands of an amateur. This chemistry isn&#039;t to be played with. <br />

				If you are set on shooting H the teks that describe purifying street H to pure Heroin HCL should interest you too!&nbsp; It may be a pain but you will be saving abuse/poisoning your body/veins on nasty cuts and toxins.<br /><br />My thing is as a longtime oxycodone user I think that a refined Heroin HCL with a nasal spray delivery system is going to provide me more of a &quot;rush&quot; per say than I am use to.&nbsp; I am concerned I will miss the energetic longer lasting high of IR oxycodone over the purified H.<br /><br />Finally that bitcoin spammer is really ruining this forum.&nbsp; This spammer should try Raid nasal spray or try shooting Drano.

				As a fellow chemist i can only applaud writing down the details of your purification in such detail. <br /><br />I do wonder what the yield of this purification protocol is - you seem to go from freebase to .hcl form a couple of times. which will probably result in losses due to active compount remaining in the water and organic phase upon separation. <br /><br />If you happen to live in a temperate climate area, it could perhaps be more useful to grow your own poppies to harvest/milk morphine from those, and convert that into heroin if you like. Ofcourse that also is an elaborate process, but you would be sure that no substances are added in the mix that you would not expect. <br /><br />Growing poppies as such is not that difficult and could possibly be done even indoors. They aren&#039;t overly picky plants when it comes to soil composition and such - somniferum poppies will grow in the average western backyard as long as they get sufficient light, water and nutrition. The downside is that they do need quite some space to grow, but the upside is that they will not look suspicious since many people grow all kinds of papaver species as decorative plants - the only difference is that you will milk yours before they bloom, something invisible from any distance.

				Honestly, this is the only reason I&#039;m switching to heroin. It&#039;s not that I can&#039;t afford Oxies, it&#039;s that my tolerance is getting too high to use them and it&#039;s ridiculous paying that much when i can pay a hell of a lot less and get more bang for my buck.

				that wasnt his method he wrote down - thats from erowid <br /><br />i actually switched to H from oxy, and it works pretty well actually. i use it half for a medical GI condition and partly cause i am addicted to the anxiolytic properties <br /><br />the highs are different slightly - as you mention oxy is more energetic in a way and the H can cause nods more easily if you do too much, but who knows if thats from the cuts so purification may enhance the energy cause really good quality #4 definitely has an &quot;up&quot; component to the high<br /><br />one thing is the varying quality though, at least with pills you know what you are getting, some batches of H can basically just waste all your money and you have nothing to show for it, where at least with pills youd get less but your getting something for the money guaranteed <br /><br />sometimes its more difficult to find H though especially - it can be frustrating when you cant get anything good cause you dont want to spend the extra money and waste it on the over-priced pills. plus your tolerance will go up so you need even more, but if i could afford enough oxy for a reasonable price i definitely would still prefer it over the H probably, its different but i just like the oxy high and its energetic euphoria, maybe cause thats what i initially got addicted to <br /><br />snorting H doesnt really give you a rush, its pretty mellow - you need to shoot it really to get a rush, or at least plug it which has much better BA. just like with oxy snorting it will waste a good bit but i dont want my addiction to get even more out of control by shooting. starting to do H really strengthens the motivation to shoot even if you say now you never would cause you just think about how much better it would be given how awesome it is already... i used to be terrified of needles, but that went out the window, and have even shot a couple times

				i guess you didnt get the point - it doesnt matter how much you purify the batch if you receive really weak gear... its because there is very little H to purify so your money will be wasted. but if you have good sources you definitely get more bang for your buck with H. the quality will vary even between bags from the same source though, which is the difference between pills which is constant. i think the euphoria might be stronger with oxy in a way though for me personally<br /><br />from the best sources on the road you may even get in excess of 700 mg of diamorphine<br /><br />like i said, i switched from snorted oxy to snorted H and have been very pleased... even saved money.&nbsp; snorted H definitely lasts longer than just an hour or two... it can easily be the 4-5 hours you mention before really needing to re-dose<br /><br />i dont know how well the nasal solution will work or if it will hydrolyse too quickly - i have definitely considered this method and am interested if you could please report back if you try it&nbsp; <br /><br />you can actually synthesize chloroform pretty easily if i remember correctly from accessible ingredients, recipe can be found online
