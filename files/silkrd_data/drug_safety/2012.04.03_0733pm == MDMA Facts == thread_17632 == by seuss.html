				alright ive tried mdma, or rather xtc pills (probably impure as fuck with fillers). that was a few years ago. never tried pure mdma (molly). i dont know much about it, but everyone always says it basically damages your brain. i sense its bullshit propagated by LE and clueless idiots. can anyone spill the beans about the truth regarding this substance?

				Long-term/heavy use is almost definitely not good for you but the &quot;ecstasy pokes holes in your brain&quot; thing is bullshit. Erowid.org and dancesafe.org are useful relatively unbiased sources of information.

I always recommend taking multivitamins before, during, and after your trip, just to be on the safe side. It is recommended to space out your MDMA dosage by at least 2 weeks (although if you want to reduce damage completely you should wait at least 2-3 months, but most people don&#039;t) <br /><br />As whatever stated you should check out Erowid.org to find out more, it&#039;s also great when you need to look up most substances.

				MDMA is definitely neurotoxic in and of itself. I remember reading a while back a study in rats that found that MDMA and meth were approximately the same in neuron damage, but I&#039;m unsure how that was quantified and I don&#039;t think they accounted for the differences in typical dosage by users. <br /><br />Regardless of this neurotoxicity, most users can&#039;t tell a difference after taking it multiple times, and most certainly find it worth the risk. That being said, if you&#039;re concerned about neurotoxicity, Nichols did a lot of research into non-neurotoxic analogues such as MBDB. You might be interested in those if you&#039;re too concerned about real MDMA.

				Moderate MDMA use leaves no permanent damage. Depletes Seratonin and thats about it.

				A few tips to reduce potential damage from MDMA and make sure you don&#039;t &quot;lose the magic&quot;:<br /><br />1. Keep doses reasonable. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The higher the dose, the more potential neurotoxicity. A lot of the misleading studies in the 90s/2000s claiming brain damage from MDMA came from administering the human equivalent of 500mg+ MDMA to rats, and it really fucked up their brains. Don&#039;t be those rats.. If you&#039;re taking more than 200mg of pure stuff in a night you&#039;re building up a tolerance and need to scale back your use. Don&#039;t redose more than once, it increases potential neurotoxicity.<br /><br />2. Space out your rolls. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Alexander Shulgin (contemporary father of MDMA) suggests you roll at most 4 times a year. So I try to stick to that. But if you wait at least a month between your rolls you probably won&#039;t run into (many) negative side effects.<br /><br />3. Try to keep your body temperature relatively cool.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are at a very hot &amp; packed club/rave, and people are literally drenched in sweat, it may not be the best environment to roll in. People usually worry about your body temp in terms of the possibility of collapsing from exhaustion, but they don&#039;t realize that higher body temperature also significantly increases MDMA neurotoxicity, at least in animal studies. If you are going to be in a hot place while rolling, taking breaks from dancing periodically and drink water or sports drinks.

				Tangent here but why do Americans call MDMA &quot;Molly&quot;? In the U.K it&#039;s called Mandy. :S<br /><br />Weird trans-Atlantic semantics.
