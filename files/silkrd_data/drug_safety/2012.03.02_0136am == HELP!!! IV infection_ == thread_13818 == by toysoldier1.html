				an infection wouldnt instantaneously pop up into a huge boil. bacteria exhibit a lag phase of growth before the exponential growth kicks in during which they have to realize theyre in the appropriate environment and start producing the cellular machinery for reproduction, which generally takes at least a few hours. <br /><br />an infection will also be very red and tender, with the swelling and redness spreading outward. if you come down with a fever IMMEDIATE medical attention is absolutely necessary because it could be indicative of sepsis where bacteria get into your bloodstream and reproduce systemically<br /><br />I dont shoot, but it sounds like something other than an infection, more like what I have heard of when people miss.

				Sounds like you missed, and had a histamine rxn at the injection site.&nbsp; If the Benadryl helped with the swelling, it would seem to confirm this theory.&nbsp; You should be fine...<br /><br />HOWEVER:&nbsp; Keep an eye on it.&nbsp; If you notice it getting red, swelling up again, or faint red streaks under the skin moving away from the injection site, then don&#039;t waste time posting here- just go to a doctor and get some antibiotics.&nbsp; Last thing you want is an abcess!

				Read the PDF guide posted in the sticky thread on IM injection, please!!!<br /><br />Also, you can shoot in the same spot multiple times, this is what usually creates track marks.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is stupid, people go just a few millimeters up or down from where they last hit on a vein and it creates a lot of internal scarring.&nbsp; The bumps on your hand will go away.&nbsp; A 29 gauge is totally fine for hitting the crook of your elbow or backsides of your arms.&nbsp; Get a friend who knows how to IV to show you what to do, watch some videos on youtube, and most importantly -- DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! -- USE A NEW NEEDLE FOR **EVERY SINGLE SKIN PUNCTURE*** AND ESPECIALLY ROTATE YOUR SPOTS!!! I&#039;ve been shooting for about 10 years and you&#039;d never know it because I rotate my spots.&nbsp; I inject cocaine up to 50 times a day sometimes and only then will I get some noticeable marks but they go away quickly because I have done the research to figure out how to do things right.&nbsp; Go slowly bro, once you turn to the spike you don&#039;t turn back.&nbsp; If you ever have any questions feel free to PM me.

				Shit, did the same thing again.&nbsp; I think I poked through the vein.&nbsp; Swelled up again.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doesnt look like its gonna get worse.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Think it would be safe to shoot up again? I didnt get a rush from the last shot cause it was skin popped.

I&#039;ve sone considerable amounts of SC injections due to unavailability of needles ( for example having 23g needle and not wanting to stab a vein - have shaky hands). so I just inject under the skin.&nbsp; The bubble sometimes quite big appears and after a while is gone. never had a problem - you risk abscess if you;re in bad health but is still IV is safer than SC.<br /><br />Also change injection sites, inject only in hands, do not inject into the same spot or vein (well try not to). Why in hands ? because they&#039;re more resistant to abscesses and onfections than other parts of your body. Rotation means trying to avoid same spot or same vein and letting one heal while using another - thats vein saving - never lost a vein YET but I&#039;m getting lazy and just going to the easiest spots and they already developed bruising, so for your own sake rotate injectuon&nbsp; sites.

				Fuck dude, you are not hitting a vein at all. When you hit the arteries in your hands they will swell like a bitch but then go down slowly as the H gets pulled back out of your capillary beds.<br /><br />It going into the capillary beds is what is causing the swelling. <br /><br />Are you by chance hitting between the index finger and thumb? There is a good size artery there. A decent vein too, but once the vein gets beat people start digging a little deeper and hit that artery.

YOU SHOULD HAVE PAIn - but I never had somehow .. Also you get high in 15-20 mins because arteries bring blood away from your heart. Only had a few accidental arteries injections, the whole hand was itchy as hell though and was very scared because i&#039;ve seen necrosis due to arterial injection and amputations. he did SC injection thats all nothing so serious if heroin is clean and filtered and he is healthy. Lump is just solution he injected under his skin which I&#039;m sure now is disappeared.
