				Hello fellow brothers and sisters! I have decided from some of your suggestions that I want to try LSD tomorrow, before I try it in a festival environment in a few weeks. I have 5 of Albion&#039;s beautiful 100ug Shivas. A quick personal background, I have taken MDMA a ton, and have taken shrooms a handful of times as well. Some of the questions I have for you experienced fellas are:<br /><br />What is the appropriate dosage for my first experience? I was thinking start with 1 tab. <br /><br />What would be a good time of the day to ingest? I would like to see the day turn to night.<br /><br />How long will the trip last? Of course depending on dosage<br /><br />What are a list of tangibles that are a must have? <br /><br />Any must watch movies, shows; or must listen to music?<br /><br />Any food/drink that are a must to have on hand?<br /><br />Any advice you guys have is GREATLY appreciated, I love reading you guys&#039; trip reports and hope that I will have such an opened perception of the world from this experience&nbsp; :D<br /><br />

So, you are good there.<br /><br />LSD affects everyone differently. But 100ug (1 tab) is a good starting point.<br /><br />During what period of the 24-day you get least disturbed by folks? That would be your starting time.<br /><br />You can expect the trip to last between 6-8 hours. But YMMV.<br /><br />Keep some music, movies ready. These are for the &quot;just in case&quot; scenarios. Music impacts the trips quite a bit. Try not not have vocals. Instrumentals are better choice, IMHO. <br /><br />Keep some water, food at hand. There is no hard and fast rule about drinking water. But I normally try to consume about 2 liters of water during the 6-8 hours time period. It keeps my system healthy.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br />GSE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks GSE! I live alone so I am pretty free to start whenever, I am thinking between 2-5pm to start. I saw that you said something about fruit on one of your posts? Is that simply because you enjoy fruit? What will I typically feel like after I am completely done? Strung out to an extent? Is smoking weed during a good idea?

				So 100ug is a pretty light dose - don&#039;t expect full blow visuals or too much mental madness off that dose - which is probably a good thing if you are doing it at a festival for the first time. Normally I&#039;d suggest about 200ug for a good first trip but you would want to do that somewhere safe, comfortable and predictable. Most acid heads shy against an abort button but if you have any hesitation going into it, you might want to track down a Xanax just in case things get too weird for you - but at 100ug I think you&#039;ll still have pretty good control over the world. <br /><br />Acid can take a good long time to hit so if you want to do 1 hit I would only bring one hit or through complex drug induced math you might find yourself eating the rest an hour or two in.<br /><br />Also, acid is very dependent on state of mind. You might not feel like you are feeling much of anything until you sit down and stop to appreciate things. Try and find a few minutes of quiet time to just gaze and something and you might be surprised and what you see gazing back at you. <br /><br />My personal advice would be to forgo the weed the first time or two out. Weed can really amp up the visuals of the trip but it has a pesky little habit of sometimes introducing a little paranoia too. A clean LSD trip can be a beautiful thing on it&#039;s own so no reason not to get to know it a little before you go mixing in other substances. When you do decide to mix, even though I know you&#039;ve sworn it off for a while, a little MDMA really is magical on the stuff. <br /><br />Anyway, enjoy the trip!

				When you smoke weed on psychedelics, you really can&#039;t even feel it. Most of the time I do it while tripping it, to do something while conversing with others. If you do do it, I&#039;d suggest smoking near the end. But like GSE said, since it&#039;s your first time you may want to understand the single substance the best you can. Although I doubt it&#039;d take much of anything away -- a lot of people love smoking while tripping. <br /><br />I&#039;d suggest taking it 8 hours before you usually go to sleep. That way you can trip, unwind, then nod off. I usually eat a protein hearty meal before and then don&#039;t eat until after -- usually. But yes, keep water on hand. I am more thirsty than normal while tripping, mostly because I end up talking a lot to other people. <br /><br />Listen to music you really enjoy yourself, and take notice to the enhancement. I like GSE&#039;s suggestion for instrumental music, but I would do this if you were looking for a &quot;soundtrack&quot; to whatever you&#039;re doing. Otherwise, listen to what you really like. <br /><br />Make a list of idea&#039;s that you can do from your location so that you have some go to activities. Suggestions if possible are outdoors ones, such as hiking or just sitting on the porch in the sun, lying on a bench and looking&nbsp; at the stars. If you like doing creative things, obviously do those: drawing, playing/making music, and writing are all great. Only use a movie for a backup. Something I&#039;d suggest is to keep a notepad near and write down any revelations that come to you so you don&#039;t forget them. Sometimes my short-term memory is absolutely fucked when I&#039;m tripping, but I think on 100ug this isn&#039;t likely. <br /><br />Also, I think 100ug is a good starting point, maybe 150ug. So if you want to do&nbsp; 1 and 1/2 that&#039;d be good. <br /><br />Oh, also, it depends on the person, but for some people I suggest putting your phone in the dresser drawer and forgetting about it. You don&#039;t want to be getting calls from people you shouldn&#039;t be talking to in that mindset and it&#039;s really just a distraction. <br /><br />So yeah, make a list of things that you think would be fun and on hand, and then once the stuff kicks in, pick whichever you are in the mood for. :)

				From my limited experience..&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;d say go for one and a half at least, especially if you have experience with shrooms.<br /><br />Fruit is an awesome idea!&nbsp; I suggest getting a small selection of fruit before your adventure.<br /><br />I enjoy lying on the floor becoming immersed in some good music.&nbsp; As has been said just whatever music you like is good.&nbsp; My favourites so far have been Pink Floyd, the Beatles, Beach Boys (indeed) and some jazz.

				Take one, see how you feel after an hour or so.<br />Setting is key. Comfortable surroundings, good mind-set etc..&nbsp; main thing is to relax and just let it do its thing.<br />Music and movies as suggested above is good advice. Personally I would avoid weed while on lsd, just seems like a waste to me.<br /><br />There are charts and stuff out there that supposedly work out your ideal dose based on body weight etc.. but tbh I think these are total bollocks.<br />Start with 100ug, see what occurs.<br />Personally my first lsd experience involved 160ug dose, and I didn&#039;t see anything except some slight &quot;fluttering&quot; in my peripheral vision, and some mild &quot;breathing&quot; of surfaces. Someone else however, might have a much stronger experience on the same dose. <br /><br />Just start small, see how you get on.<br />Main thing in my opinion is to just relax and don&#039;t fight it.

				I recommend total darkness and silence. Some music could be nice if you dislike the silence :) Something like Shpongle or Hinkstep. Prepare a bottle of water and some easily cooked food incase you get a major acid munch (rare, but it happens). Vegetables, like salad or cucumber are highly recommended while tripping! Wear light clothes that you would be comfortable sleeping with, and light some incense. Avoid computers, phones, TV and radio. Candles are preferable to electric lamps. Then let your mind play :D<br /><br />If you like doing art or play an instrument then that could be very rewarding to try.

				Great thread! Thanks, OP. <br /><br />Is there an LSD preload, like for MDMA? Good harm reduction strategy. Since it likes the same receptors, might the same harm reduction practices apply? <br /><br />

It might be a good idea to eat some bananas if your joints are aching.

And&nbsp; no other drugs during that week. Some medications to be avoided the day of tripping. erowid.org might have more details on this. Some people like to take 5-HTP but I don&#039;t think that helps. Good night sleep the night before is a must.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One week? Total overkill. This isn&#039;t ayahuasca, which I would recommend 3-4 weeks preparation. No, with LSD a few hours is enough time. What I usually do is schedule the trip about a week ahead of time and look forward to it. You only need good rest the night before and good food the day of.<br /><br />As for other drugs, I don&#039;t think it matters. I don&#039;t partake in many other drugs besides psychedelics anymore, but obviously if you take those (excluding DMT) recently before tripping it will effect tolerance. But it shouldn&#039;t matter if you smoke weed the day before or whatnot, but depends on the drug, and depends on you. <br /><br />The medications to be avoided are mostly anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, but yes check erowid to be safe, although LSD is a very safe drug. <br /><br />But like badniff says, be in a stress-free, good mood.

Did you copy that dosage from erowid? Yes, I see you did. But I would recommend against taking them at two separate times. I&#039;ve never regretted taking too much, only too little. And being the first time, I could see someone thinking wow, this is intense from any amount and not taking more. Also, there is tolerance that builds quickly to consider, by the time it actually kicks in, the seconds dose will not be as effective as the first. It&#039;s better to take it all at once. <br /><br />Love, Alive 2007, one of my favorite electronic albums. Daft Punk is bliss while tripping.&nbsp;

				Repost from Avengers page :] Thanks for all the advice again guys!!<br /><br />So this past Friday night I had the pleasure of trying LSD for the first time, what a wonderful experience! I had 5 tabs of my FAVORITE seller on the SR Albion&#039;s 100ug Shivas&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />My girlfriend and I (both LSD virgins) dropped the tab on our tongue at 7pm, a little late I know! We also ate a little dinner right after swallowing them, probably wasn&#039;t the smartest idea and definitely made it take a while to digest.<br /><br />By 9pm I was feeling extremely euphoric and things were starting to look extremely vibrant! We took a step outside and to our luck there was a firework show a few miles away, so we climbed on the roof and watched. It was like an orgasm every time they exploded! It was simply amazing. We had a great time listening to some good music, and looking at some trippy pictures. We went to some friends house and smoked some pot and joked around, it was a ton of fun.<br /><br />Around 1am we went home and chilled out. We lit an incense and took a bath and it was super cool. She was getting some intense visuals and I was trying to get on her level haha.<br /><br />Overall it was an amazing experience and I am very excited to try LSD again, at a higher dose than 100ug in a few weeks. Thank you Albion and please come back soon!<br /><br />On another note does anyone have any recommendations for 50-100 tabs at a good price and can get to the USA by next Thursday? JOR said his won&#039;t be shipping til thursday and Jerseycow is all out, I am starting to worry&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Love and Light avengers&nbsp; :D

				Yeah it was nice it made me feel all tingly and sensitive on my body, gave me the giggles as well! Didn&#039;t really hallucinate on it though, only took 4mg. Oh sweet, what was the euphoria like on it compared to something like MDMA? And I presume it was the effect of the acid that gave you the peace of mind? <br />I&#039;ve heard 2c-e or 25i are the most comparable to LSD!

Cheap and plastic are good words to describe. I felt almost completely sober in terms of my headspace, except perhaps that it made me feel kind of stupid. the visuals can be fun, but not as good as others psyches. If you do get 25i I&#039;d suggest getting it in powder form in caps. Tis better.

I live alone so I am pretty free to start whenever, I am thinking between 2-5pm to start. I saw that you said something about fruit on one of your posts? Is that simply because you enjoy fruit? What will I typically feel like after I am completely done? Strung out to an extent? Is smoking weed during a good idea?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sure you already took your trip by now, and I hope it went well. That being said, weed is definitely a nice addition to any trip but only when you are comfortable with the experience. I tend to love a nice blunt (either grape, white grape or blueberry) when I trip. I spark that the second I start to feel the body load (usually after a shit lol) and get minor visuals. I turn off the lights and hit the blunt with a &quot;White Rabbit&quot; by Jefferson Airplane playing nice and loudly on my sound system and a visualizer running from my computer to the TV (all set up way ahead of time). This gets me into a good trip mentality, and I havent had a terrible trip since i started this routine :). As far as music goes, I tend to go back to the 60s, 70s and early 80s of rock. Get the nice hippie/tripping music going (since thats what it was intended for heh) and then I throw in other ambiance music like Aarni or Buckethead - &quot;soothsayer&quot;. I smoke throughout the night usually because after the weed wears off, the LSD gets less visually intense so its nice to have a boost. Also I don&#039;t know if you went outside, but transitioning from inside to outside is very transcendental. Most people on here have their own little routines when it comes to tripping. Just figure out what you are comfortable with, what you like, and what you can handle and just have fun!

Alive 2007 is absolutely fantastic; Daft Punk are musical deities yet somehow manage to focus solely on making amazing music rather than boosting their ego as celebrities. On MDMA, Alive 2007 gives you incredible sensations of energy and interconnectedness with the world; on LSD, the music gives me an incredible sense of time dilation, especially when they slow down into those glitchy vocals that build and build back up to the proper tempo- it&#039;s loads of fun.<br /><br />Another group I&#039;d recommend listening to is Infected Mushroom- They&#039;re a psychedelic/goa trance group who have a sound no other artists encompass and incorporate stylings like metal guitar solos into their tunes. Each album is entirely different from the last, yet still has the IM vibe. I&#039;d recommend listening to Legend of the Black Shawarma in its entirety if you&#039;re looking to have a therapeutic trip- it gives me a sense of a looming demonic presence, waiting for me to become just weak enough for it to encompass me; it&#039;s a representation of my sub-conscious&#039;s perpetual anxiety. It sounds like a bad trip in words, but when you experience it it&#039;s truly amazing and great for self-learning.<br /><br />Finally– I&#039;d personally jump straight to a 200 µg dose. I did 200 my first time, it was phenomenal. You have a lot more control over how a trip goes than you&#039;d think; worrying about whether or not you&#039;ll have a bad trip is more likely to give you a bad trip than anything else.
