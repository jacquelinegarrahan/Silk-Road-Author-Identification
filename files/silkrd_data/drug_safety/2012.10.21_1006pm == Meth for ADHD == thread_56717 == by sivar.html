				Hi,<br />I&#039;m considering using crystal meth to treat my adhd, but i have a few questions first. I want to take a measured amount orally. Since I don&#039;t want to buy a ug scale, I plan to weigh the meth crystals using a cheap scale and then dissolve it in distilled water. I would keep the solution in a syringe and measure out doses directy from the syringe. Would this work? How long can I store the solution in the syringe? I only expect to take around 10mg/day so I need it to last a couple months. Any other recommendations?

				i dont think meth is the best decision for adhd - especially not for daily use due the stress on the nervous system. perhaps regular amphetamine would be a little better <br /><br />definitely not recommended to make up aqueous solutions and store for long periods because they become cultures for bacteria and fungi which will ruin the entire batch of drug. it will also promote degradation of the chem in aqueous solution particularly if exposed to increased temp or light. for this reason if you are going to mix it up do it in smaller quantities with bacteriostatic water you will use within a week and keep in the fridge. it would be best to use an alcohol solution to prevent contamination growing though<br /><br />probably be better just to buy some capsules and make the doses up that way even though you will need a decent scale - well worth the expense if you plan on following through with this plan to use meth in that way
