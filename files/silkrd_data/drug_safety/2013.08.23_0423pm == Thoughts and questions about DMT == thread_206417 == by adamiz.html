				Hello people. I send yesterday a post in the Deemsters thread but thought it is better if I start a new thread about this since the answers I seek for can be more personal and so I will avoid spamming the Deemsters thread with those. So copy paste, here it is.<br /><br />Hello Deemsters and friends!!<br /><br />I would like to place some thoughts,experiences and questions about this mystical substance called DMT, in order to understand some missing parts more clearly.<br /><br />I heard about DMT 2-3 years ago and wanted to learn about it and try it without having any experience into other psychedelics. Last year I firstly tried LSD and since then I can say I have done it 10-15 times. All this time I was also researching about DMT.<br /><br />This July I started experimenting with DMT. Just after my first try I started using the Machine method. The first 2-3 weeks I was obsessed with the term &quot;breaking through&quot; and did consume about 0.7g from different vendors. I must mention also that my dose varied from 20-40 and two times 50mg. In all of my tries I have had only one or two &quot;meaningful&quot; experiences. (in case you are interested, here is my report ---&gt;&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1409935#msg1409935<br />In addition in all my tries I have never been or experienced visions/situations/places that are out of body or reports similar to others. I always know where I am, and despite the visuals all the trip has a feeling of multi thinking and loss of time.<br /><br />So after this experience I kind of lost the need to try breaking through or using it daily.<br /><br />Being guided and influenced by public or personal posts by BlackIris, I came to a conclusion that psychedelics and especially DMT is a substance that &quot;needs&quot; a very good mind and consciousness state in order to adapt in to the experience of this substance. So I tried to keep a distance away from DMT and managed to do it for about 3 weeks. During these weeks I have succeeded in changing some habits or &quot;addictions&quot; I had such as daily use of cannabis, meaningless surfing on the net, porn and others. I also try to work on my body and meditation. Although I can state I have not fitted those two entirely in my daily schedule. Anyway, the thing I want to say is that I try to improve my mental/body state for two reasons. One is the obvious one that concern health and mental prosperity and the other reason is that I want to deepen my psychedelic experiences, in this case DMT.<br /><br />Before some days I bought another 0.5g from a trusted and vouched vendor and started experimenting again.<br />This time I am not alone, a good friend has joined the &quot;quest&quot;. First time after weeks I and him tried the product. It was his first time, and even though he didn&#039;t do the perfect tokes he experienced something that you may call break through. In short, he was in a operation bed, having his chest opened and operated by some entities.<br />That was my first time doing DMT with company and I really felt different or I can say not free and blocked by his presence.<br /><br />Anyway, in my last trip before 3 weeks and in the next two ones these days, I seem to have lost everything about the trip. Can&#039;t remember anything except that I had the feeling of loosing time. Today before an hour I tried again, and the only thing I can remember is the visuals..<br /><br />I know that DMT isn&#039;t a easy substance, I know you need to have a &quot;clean&quot; mind before trying it and honestly I try. I don&#039;t consider myself stupid or anything, on the contrary I would say, but clearly I miss something important that doesn&#039;t allow me to feel the experience or this &quot;break through&quot;.<br /><br />If I would personally ask BlackIris I know that his answer would be like: My mind blocks it and I am expecting too much from it or have been affected by so many trip reports and information that I have read. I trust this is the case but still I want to share this thought to all of you.<br /><br />Any comments on this perspective that concerns mind state are more than welcome. But I want also to make a clear question about the practical part of it that concerns the dose.<br /><br />I have seen that many talk about the dose being around 50mg but on the other hand I keep reading from experienced users that they need only one or two tokes with 20-30mg.<br />And another part of this question that has troubled me long time is the following: Again influenced from reading and especially even before I tried, I thought that after inhaling it you wouldn&#039;t be able to move much and therefore it is advisable&nbsp; to have someone to take your machine/pipe away in order not to burn. Even in the &quot;How to&quot; instructions, people mention that you can take 2 or 3 tokes if you are able to do so.<br /><br />One thing I try to follow (without ever trying to do opposite) is to keep a moderation when it concerns the dose. And the thing I want to ask you people before trying it is: Since every time I take my tokes, I always&nbsp; always have the feel that I can inhale more. My mind maybe starts &quot;playing&quot; but again I know for sure I am able to take more hits. So the idea is to make another one or even two machines more load them (20-40mg)&nbsp; and try to inhale until I can&#039;t anymore. What do you think about that? Will it make any difference? And is it possible that because I will inhale a lot I will overdo it and just &quot;sleep&quot;?<br />Honesty I don&#039;t like to abuse anything especially psychedelics, and that is why I want your thoughts on that.<br /><br />Going to focus a lot the next days on educating myself in meditation practices and put it into my daily schedule not only for my shake, but maybe because it will help me on future DMT attempts.<br /><br />I am really sorry about the length of all this, maybe it is even a worthless text to read, but since I am having troubles understanding this &quot;Spirit molecule&quot; you are the only ones that I can ask advices and have some extra knowledge.<br /><br />Just to make it clear again, I use the machine method, and I don&#039;t want to sandwich or any other methods.<br />Lastly I want to wish you all a nice day and to thank you in advance for reading this or even answering to it.<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Adamiz

				Welcome to the world of DMT!<br /><br />You are very very correct in your mental preparation for the experience.<br /><br />However, if a full breakthrough is what you wish to experience, I feel your caution (regarding dosage at least) should be thrown to the wind.<br /><br />Load up your machine with 100+ mg (you won&#039;t be able to smoke all of that in a single sitting, but this way you know you&#039;re not running out of DMT before you breakthrough) and just hit it like a champ.<br /><br />Also, speaking from personal experience, maybe your machine is too big or is inefficient in some way. I could never break through on my first machine, then I built one that was about a quarter of the size, and I breakthrough everytime on this one (less air/more DMT inhaled). The smoking device/technique is very important, you want to inhale as much DMT as quickly as possible.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t read your experience thread yet, please let me know if I&#039;ve horribly overlooked anything.<br /><br />ALSO: If you&#039;re on any SSRIs they will almost completely prevent the DMT from having any effect.

				CiscoYankerStuck thank you&nbsp; for your answer.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206417.msg1486297#msg1486297">Quote from: CiscoYankerStuck on August 24, 2013, 08:52 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, speaking from personal experience, maybe your machine is too big or is inefficient in some way.

The first machine I made was from a 250ml bottle and it was a total failure. My current is about 100-120ml and I can say it works pretty well. Yesterday though I got 3 bottles of 50ml and will try and keep those since I believe that the smaller the better. But since I find it difficult to put 100mg I am thinking to do it with 2 machines where I will load 50mg to each one. What do you think about that? I can&#039;t find any reason why it would be different if instead one machine with 100mg I use 2 with 50.<br /><br />Although when I built my new machine I will make a usual dose (30-40) just to test the efficiency of a smaller bottle before I do the &quot;big&quot; try.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206417.msg1486297#msg1486297">Quote from: CiscoYankerStuck on August 24, 2013, 08:52 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ALSO: If you&#039;re on any SSRIs they will almost completely prevent the DMT from having any effect.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No I am on any SSRIs.

				Look for a pipe called the Vapor Geni. You load about 10 screens into it and it has a ceramic filter to block the flame but let the hot air through. I get the full amount every time, have not misfired since I got it.

				I think using 2 bottles would work just fine.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t do it myself because it just annoys the crap out of me knowing that there&#039;s a small amount of spice just sitting in there unused unless I reload it. Would rather just have one that I can top off as needed and get every last little bit out of.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear all about it once you you breakthrough. I read your thread, it sounds like you&#039;re getting pretty close.

				Alot of DMT is extracted using hardware-grade solvents. This ends up on the end product. You cant smell it but you can feel it (wheezing after a trip).

				I have an eclipse vape.. it comes with a couple sized vials.. seems the small one makes it easier to hit DMT but you have to be quick..<br />My first time I wasted loads of it since it was my first time vaping anything..&nbsp; i am not much of a smoker.. also my trip showed me that I was still in a dark state emotionally..&nbsp; gray and black patterns and telling me i had no love in my life and without any, no point in going further on the DMT path..&nbsp; strong message that I took to heart..<br /><br />second time, a month later and much better spirits and better in opening my life to family etc, and while on LSD, I was able to see some wonderful patterns but not break through.&nbsp; I did manage to burn my lips a bit toking a third time while borderline trance state so watch that..&nbsp; I could of melted my face off and not realize it so beware<br /><br />also, learning to hold it in for long times is more important than just taking more and more hits..&nbsp; tough to learn on your own, but I feel I am getting the hang of it

I don&#039;t remember the specific results but I think it amounted to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Basically if you are healthy enough for a roller coaster then it is safe enough to smoke DMT.<br /><br />The only physical danger would be that it knocks out your physical body(your are still conscious, just not in your body). You could potentially burn yourself with the pipe or aspirate while unconcious. You could fall off your chair and hit your head etc... It is always good to have a friend watch you.<br />

				Lately, I have often this experience that I don&#039;t remember much even with small doses of 30-40. After yesterdays session I decided to quit DMT for 1-2 weeks or more since the last experiences is meaningless. Need some time to put my mind in a peaceful state before trying. Yesterday evening I tried as well &quot;overdosing&quot; because I really want to experience this so called break through. I have been trying 2 months without success. During the toking yesterday I felt really strong effects and did about 5-6 tokes until I couldn&#039;t more. I lied down hoping that this was the time finally. But no, I actually don&#039;t remember much.... So I said enough with it. I have wasted more than a gram without any big success. I feel I have to slow down a bit and take a break. I find this substance the hardest ever. I have tried more than 20-30 times and had only 2 meaningful experiences. I had with me an female entity before some weeks, who lately has been lost. I miss her.... I need a break obviously..<br /><br /><br />All the best, <br /><br />Adamiz

It is only sold from the maker&#039;s main site in Canada (I think). Holding the hit for a 20 count is how you get the most from it. With a GVP, you can hit 30mg, hold it for 20 and breakthrough. It really is efficient. <br /><br />Now, as for the &quot;black outs&quot; and lost time...<br />Sometimes the spirits want us to get something other than pretty pictures. Sometimes the ego awareness is pushed aside so that Higher can get something important done, such as a healing or download, etc. I don&#039;t sweat the blank time anymore when I do something that expands my consciousness, as I have given my allies in the spirit world permission to do what needs to be done for my highest good, etc. Think of them more as the downtime of a hard reset to your computer :)<br /><br />SS<br />
