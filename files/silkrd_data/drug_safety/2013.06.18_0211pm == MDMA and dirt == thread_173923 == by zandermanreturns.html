				so as i open my first ever order from SR i am very happy to see the quality of this MDMA is outta-line. I place my molly in a glass vial, because it looks cool of course and my friend promptly knocks it onto my damn carpet. Having managed to save nearly all 10 grams,7.3 fully intact i have this other two gram ball of dirt and molly shards.<br />This is my question is there any way that i can separate the MDMA from the pile of garbage in the ease of my home?<br />If worse comes to worse then i will end up parachuting that dirt pile, its really a very fair amount of Mandy still and my big show is this weekend but i would rather get em separate before consumption.<br />Friends never let friends come near your stash.

				you could wash it with acetone, that clears out a lot of adulterants so should clear out some if not all of the dirt. theres a thread on how to do it in drug safety i think. think you&#039;ll need to search for it though as i don&#039;t recall seeing it for a while.<br /><br />hope your &#039;friends&#039; are reimbursing you for their mistake... :)

However, personally I think an extraction/recrystallization would be your best bet, since I&#039;m not sure how well acetone would work on the mixture you have there. So do the following:<br /><br />1. Dump your solid mixture into a container that you can pour liquid into<br />2. Heat up some IPA (grocery store, 91%, make it anhydrous by baking some MgSO4 (epsom salts) and using it as a drying agent)<br />3. Pour a little acetone into the IPA until a cloudy mixture is formed<br />4. Pour The IPA/acetone mixture into the container with the solid mixture in it (make sure it the container can handle the high temp)<br />5. Gravity filter whatever did not dissolve (the crap you don&#039;t want)<br />6. Let sit 30min at room temp for recrystallization to occur. <br />7. Filter (keep the remaining liquid)<br />8. Wash crystals with acetone<br />9. Throw remaining liquid in the freezer for a couple of hours to recover a second crop of crystals<br />10. You&#039;ve now got your crystals, free of dirt, AND they&#039;re more pure than when you originally got them!<br />11. By the way, that second crop should be washed. It is supposedly less pure.<br /><br />A modified version of RC advice from one of the best to ever do it.

				Thanks for all your input, just got home and am ready to start washing. funny its really not very much and heel i could eat it with the dirt and be fine but who wants to eat dirt? Never washed anything before so this will be fun.<br />Yes i know i know be more careful, my fault as much as his. No reimbursement for accidents the first time but if it happens again then show me the money sucka. Ohh i cant wait to eat some of this at the huge festival this weekend, excited<br />thanks again :D ;D

				You can buy acetone at Home Depot or Lowes. Klean-Strip acetone is $7.50 for 1 qt and you can see the MSDS online. Used it myself for washing amphetamine paste back to pure.
