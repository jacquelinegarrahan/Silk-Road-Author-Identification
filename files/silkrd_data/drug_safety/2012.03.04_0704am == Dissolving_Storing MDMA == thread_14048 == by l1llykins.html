				I was thinking of buying mdma crystals but a lot of vendors will only sell a gram at a time and I have an issue of being able to measure out doses (without an accurate scale). <br /><br />I figured I can dissolve a gram into water and then accurately measure out doses with a measuring syringe, at least accurate enough for me.<br /><br />But if I did this, is the shelf life still going to be the same as if I just kept it crystals? Do you know if it will go bad or something if I stored it in a bottle as a liquid?

				i would advise against this.<br /><br />I think you would be better off eye-ing out a small amount, despite what you believe about your inability to eye out a dosage i think it would be harder to measure the exactness of&nbsp; your dose with an oral syringe. it just seems like your complicating the process...<br /><br />but if you did go this route, to my knowledge mdma is an extremely stable chemical and will not go bad in our lifetimes. can&#039;t be 100% tho about having it in water and if that somehow (i doubt) would speed up its degradation process.

				you could just set up a crude balance scale and then measure out the appropriate dose by splitting the piles. the balance will indicate the quantity has been split in half. you would need to make sure you started with exactly a gram! but you have this same problem if you use the volumetric method as you plan also so please be careful. <br /><br />split in half, two piles of 500 mg, again 250, again to 125 mg, repeat with each pile. check some piles against each other to verify the accuracy. then this should leave you with 8 piles of 125 mg if you start with a gram, 1000 mg
