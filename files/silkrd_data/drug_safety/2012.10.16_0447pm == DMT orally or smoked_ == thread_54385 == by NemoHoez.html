				Hello everybody, I was wondering what experiences have been better when doing DMT. I watched the DMT spirit molecule documentary and seen the indigenous people cooking and drinking it. It also looked like the added some other stuff to the soup, and they said they found ways to make the experience last longer.

				you cant take dmt orally by itself, because it is metabolized by MAO before reaching the brain - you must take something like the harmala alkaloids which have MAO-I properties and that changes the experience from that of a smoked one<br /><br />smoked is most common, because pure dmt can be used by itself - results in a very short and intensely visual dissociative experience rather than a longer drawn out but less intense dreamy visuals experience from oral consumption

				DMT Nexus and Mycotopia are great forums you should check out. <br /><br />Personal smoking dmt is amazing and has changed my life but id rather take it orally<br />because its easier to remember what your going through and its easier to take from your experience and learn from it

				<br />Yes, smoke your DMT. Or make it into changa. Or research the MAOI ingredients on DMT Nexus and make capsules. You can also (i think you still can) buy stuff to make the drink. You cannot just EAT the dmt crystal.

				Depends on what you are after,<br /><br />A quick hit?Then smoke your DMT, most people start with smoking first anyhow.<br /><br />But as microRNA says you have to stop the DMT being broken down before it reaches your brain. To do this you need to ingest a MAOI (Monoamine oxidase inhibitors), you can ingest a MAOI by smoking or eating it. <br /><br />Infusing DMT onto herbs and adding a MAOI makes changa, which can be smoked. This lengthens the trip and brings in more of a spiritual quality.<br /><br />You can ingest a MOAI as well, and then ingest or smoke pure DMT. This is really another level your trip will be intense and sometimes very overwhelming. Not something to rush into in my opinion.<br /><br />There are dangers, and potentially fatal ones, mixing MAOI&#039;s&nbsp; with other substances, so you must know what you are doing. Like others have said look on the DMT nexus for high quality information before trying anything with a MAOI.<br /><br />Otherwise just smoke pure DMT first and then move up, most people will end up ingesting it with a MAOI eventually if you really want an experience to write home about.

				Yeah, MAOIs are not necessary to smoke freebase.<br /><br />Also, there is a third way, a middle road, if you like, that has come up recently in the Nexus: insufflation.&nbsp; Might be a bit caustic on the nasal tissue, but it does offer some nice features.&nbsp; It also requires no MAOI.&nbsp; In addition, there is a less &quot;shocking&quot; come-up -- when smoking, it&#039;s really more of a oh-my-God-what-the-fuck-is-happening blast off -- and sniffing lasts a bit longer, with a peak of maybe half an hour.<br /><br />Experiences from smoking it can be difficult to integrate, I think, because the transformation is so radical and it&#039;s over before one knows it.&nbsp; A member of the ILF readily admits that intense fear and even shame, though by no means the totality of the experience, were certainly a part of one of his rocket rides. Still, it was an incredible, even life-changing experience.

				&nbsp;in my opinion it is best smoked using a vaporizer. if you don&#039;t own one you can make one out of a light bulb just google it or you can use this: http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/8540219

				The only two times I tried DMT I smoked it, well, more of burned it I suppose, I used a crack-pipe-type-thing. The first time I only took two hits and felt AMAZING. But the second time I took that third hit and i was GONE. Like, I left this world, honestly, I transcended space.<br /><br />Use a crack-pipe (not to sound weird) and TAKE AT LEAST THREE HITS
