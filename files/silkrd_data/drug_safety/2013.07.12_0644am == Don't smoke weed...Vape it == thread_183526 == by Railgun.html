				Seriously, I wince when I think about smoking anything now.&nbsp; My lungs feel so much better, and the highs are much cleaner.

				right on.... I&#039;d never go back to smoking... I don&#039;t use pot now but if I did, I&#039;d vape all the way... so much better in every way.&nbsp; Just get your temps right and don&#039;t over do it or over extract.

				And a Vaporgenie coil is just 30$!<br />It&#039;s a bit trickier than MFLB, but it only requires a Bic lighter.<br />And when you are done vaping you can collect your already vaped material for cooking or even oil extracting. There&#039;s still some THC and CBD left.<br />Vaping is just amazing. Also if you have to be stealthy, the smell goes away twice as fast as smoking.

				Ah damn, I would love to, but as a smoker I just can&#039;t seem to find vaping a satisfying act.<br /><br />It&#039;s like... getting off from a blowjob without actually getting blowed.<br /><br /><br />Please pardon my crass analogy.&nbsp; It lacks elegance, just as my day has.

				If you get a good technique with a Vaporgenie Coil it&#039;s like a chillum hit, I&#039;ve sent heavy smoker friends to bed with it.<br /><br />I understand what you are talking about anyway, the first days without smoking you lack something. It&#039;s the tar and those heavy compounds you get with combustion. After some days you&#039;ll focus on healtier lungs and not anymore-short breath (this is what happened to me at least).<br />

				I agree the MFLB is pretty neat, shame a battery can only deliver 4-5 hits. I usually end up rolling blunts at a party, carrying 5 batteries isn&#039;t really great.

				I have wanted to try vaping for a while now, I just don&#039;t have the cash to spend on a device at the moment. I bought a pipe last month and I find that way too harsh prefer my trusty bong, also it&#039;s more fun to smoke out of.

				Vaporization is the purest form of cannabis consumption. <br /><br />Combustion is just so dirty and leaves me feeling a bit woozy... probably all the noxious crap (crap that is practically nonexistent with vaporization).<br /><br />Any regular user who&#039;s health-conscious should look into it. Medical users especially.

				I used to have a MFLB and loved it, but the big drawback for me was the batteries.&nbsp; They never lasted very long and there was no indication of the battery levels.<br /><br />I was thinking about investing in a Pax soon.&nbsp; Its a portable vaporizer that has 3 temperature settings, a battery level indicator, and a rechargeable battery.&nbsp; The only bad part is that it is very expensive.<br /><br />Has anyone had/tried the Pax before?

				Another good thing about vaping is the health benefits.&nbsp; Much of what I have read about the harmful effects of weed have to do with inhaling smoke rather than THC itself (although of course in excess it will still harm you or send you psychotic if you are prone to that of course).<br /><br />Vaping is SOOOO much healthier..&nbsp; Period... If I &#039;smoke&#039; weed again, it&#039;ll be with a vape...&nbsp; You feel better, less &#039;crap&#039; dragging you down... just cleaner... healthier..&nbsp; As healthy as &#039;weed&#039; can be anyway..<br /><br />Get a pocket electric one if you need a portable..&nbsp; electric for more precise temp control and silence / stealth.

				Do the portables ones go over 450°F?<br /><br />I quit smoking a long time ago but now feel like having a puff in the evening ..only pure,no tobacco.<br /><br />From what i read,vaporizing does not get all the cannabinoids.<br />So if i consider portable vaporizers i prefer to get them ALL.<br />And smoking pure the benifcial cannabinoids regarding cancer could be counteracting the negatives from smoking the herb itself according to some literature but this was only based on to one study and 2 doctors. One was a lungcancer specialist thou if i recall correctly.

I just love smoking in general I gues. I do smoke cigarettes every once in a while like a pack last me two weeks to a month unless I roll on mdma then they just disapear. <br /><br />I stick to vapeing just every once in a while and it actually hurts my throat worse than smoking for some reason.
