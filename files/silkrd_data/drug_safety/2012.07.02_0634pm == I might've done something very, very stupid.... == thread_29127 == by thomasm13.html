				What does BuddhaNature&#039;s DMT look like; according to the following descriptions: <br /><br />translucent, and crystalline, almost like Ketamine <br /><br />or an off-white-powder, like 2-C-x&#039;s <br /><br />See, the thing is, I bought a bunch of K, 2-C-P, and DMT, and got what looked like Ketamine, and a white powder that I assumed was freebase DMT. I chalked up the 2-C-P to lost in the mail. <br /><br />See, I just smoked about 40 mg of what I thought was DMT and am now re-evaluating as potentially 2-C-P or special K. See, I may be about to die. I feel an elevated heartbeat. Color and music is enhanced immediately. I vaped it. It obviously was not DMT, as over the course of 1 minute I got about 4 hits. <br /><br />Can anybody help me? Also, please- after the course of this day, should I die or remain alive, please delete this thread as I don&#039;t want SR to get negative press because I fucked up. <br /><br />I feel fucked up.

				Okay, I just ingested 1.75 mg of alprazolam. I am feeling obvious signs of mood, elevated heartbeat continues, vision and perception has been altered moderately. Vasoconstriction is becoming a factor. Well, I guess I&#039;m in for a... trip. Fuck. Alright, I&#039;ll keep it updated. Luckily, I&#039;m not going to die, at least I don&#039;t think.

Hey, you might even end up in enjoying it, i think you&#039;ve worked yourself up into a panic attack, so just, relax, calm down, don&#039;t freak out and breathe slow and try you&#039;re best to enjoy the feeling. <br />Also don&#039;t take any more Xanax, although it will help you with the panic attack, it might send you to sleep. Just try youre best not to sleep. Also if its an option you should get someone understanding over to come and look after you, just in case anything bad happens. But I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine and you&#039;ll look back on this situation and laugh about it :) At worst i think you&#039;re just gunna have the panic attack, trip balls and be sick. But try to enjoy it :) also update frequently on here so we all know you&#039;re doing okay!

				Alright, my favorite quote, &quot;Those who would choose security over liberty have none and deserve neither.&quot; Okay, I&#039;m calm. The Xanax worked out, I&#039;m calling a trusted companion to drive me somewhere and keep an eye on me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve resolved the issues of my initial panic attack, and have resigned myself to my fate- a hell of a trip. I am integrating a wide variety of media as well as objects so as to manipulate my initial overreaction into something to be remembered and learned from. Seeing as I&#039;ve had experiences with up to 4000 mcg 25I-Nbome sublingually, I am not too concerned at this point. I am drinking lots of water, have taken my second dose of regular nootropics and vitamins for the day, and am going out to do some yardwork, subsequent to which I would like to go for a swim. The elevated heartbeat has subsided, I am debating consuming a small quantity of marijuana from a hash pipe. I am at this point, sitting in front of a fan in a very cool room, feeling rather euphoric. It has been 1:15 minutes since the initial ingestion. I am preparing myself to optimize this situation in every possible way. <br /><br />I will now eat a healthy meal, along with some extra 500mg Vitamin C tablets and 1 B12 shot. <br /><br />In fact, I feel very good. Perhaps my tolerance to 25x&#039;s may decrease the intensity of the trip to a certain, hopefully favorable extent. <br /><br />The only thing I have to be sure to do is avoid at all costs any manifestation whatsoever of anxiety and nervousness. Marijuana should alleviate some of these concerns, I think. <br /><br />I will continue to update regularly. Thank you for all your kind words of help and advice. <br /><br />Subsequent to this, I will be writing a report in the form of an essay. I will accept and analyze all aspects of this trip. Perhaps, rather serendipitously, this could be an unforgettable experience if I sail my psyche&#039;s ship the right way through the oncoming storm. <br /><br />I am also anticipating that perhaps calling a female friend may be enjoyable. Hmm.. many options available at this point.<br /><br />Vasoconstriction has been lessened.

				Good to see you&#039;re actually quite enjoying it :) excellent idea on getting you&#039;re friend over to look after you. Just in case anything might happen.. <br />If you smoke some hash don&#039;t smoke to much, you don&#039;t want to be to &#039;out of it&#039;, unless you feel comfortable too of course...<br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine dude, just remember to keep us updated on here and too keep calm. <br />also don&#039;t be to quick on throwing them powders away, you might regret it once your trip is up!

				I have come to the conclusion that I will most certainly not dispose of my powders. I will however take far further care to identify them. I am currently combating alprazolam-induced drowsiness, aside from that I feel wonderfully euphoric, slightly confused because of the alprazolam, and am reading Finnegan&#039;s Wake and an anthology of Native American myths. <br /><br />My good friend and female companion should be over within the hour. I&#039;m going to go for a swim, set up a YouTube playlist, get my materials ready... and seeing as I&#039;ve already got the ticket, all that&#039;s left is to take the ride. <br /><br />My body is slowly beginning to be ensconced in what sensationally feels like complete immersion into the depths of a perpetual orgasm.&nbsp; :) :) :) 8) ;D<br /><br />Thanks man! I owe you and Shannon one. Shannon, ya saved my life in the midst of that panic attack. I was literally preparing to assemble a blanket fort, a flashlight, and hide for the next forty hours, anticipating my apparently eminent death. Fucking panic attacks.

				At this point I don&#039;t necessarily feel intoxicated at all, which is very strange. In fact I feel mildly high from smoking a bowl and drowsy from the alprazolam I previously consumed. <br /><br />This is very strange, as by this point I would expect to be feeling all of the previous characteristics, intensified. There is little to no enhancement of color, and I find myself actually mildly inebriated rather than in an immersive psychedelic state. Perhaps there is more to be offered by this chemical as I pass through the comeup stage, perhaps it was actually placebo, and any initial effects were the result of a panic attack, who the fuck knows. <br /><br />I simply, rather disappointingly, do not feel any 2-C-x typical effects at this point- 4 hours after initial vaporization. What the fuck just happened to me? I felt as if I could&#039;ve very easily entered an immersive synthetic PEA trip. But now, I think the alprazolam may have negated the 2-C-P. I will update tomorrow if my condition improves, but as of right now I feel depressingly sober.

				Staying out of the pool is a good idea indeed :)<br /><br />I think this should be a good warning about properly storing and labeling your substances though. Mistaking one for the other can obviously have serious consequence. In some regard you are lucky to have taken a substance that has little risk of a fatal overdose, and just got to endure the brunt of the experience at no risk to life of limb. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure getting on a trip like this without intending on it is a very unpleasant experience though. The unexpected part may contribute to the anxiety a great deal, and even a decent dose of xanax only goes so far to curtail that.

				As Mr. Vonnegut says, &quot;So it goes&quot;. <br /><br />While I am inexpressibly appreciative of all the support everyone here offered with regards to curtailing my evening&#039;s planned aquatic interlude,&nbsp; I&#039;ve just spent the last 12 hours or so in my hot tub. <br /><br />It was a very beautiful, liberating experience. I feel as if my existence has, through the prolonged immersion in the hot tub, been recrystallized and almost refined to the point of a figurative diamond. In spite of the fact that I had no exterior source of music, the entire trip was prolonged by a sort of Joycean &quot;Merry Go Raum&quot; synesthesiac syntheses of alternating Zappa/Hendrix-esque guitar solos and waves upon waves of red, yellow and blue hues which tantalizingly danced in front of my eyes and manifested themselves throughout my physicality in maddeningly sensitive and fantastic ululations of sensations. It was as if nearly every sensation you could ever experience was compressed to a point, grafted onto the needle of an old gramophone, and sent around this strange psychedelic vortex which was my current instantiation in the physical world under the influence of ~40 mg 2-C-P. <br /><br />In retrospect, I CANNOT express my thanks to all of you within this community for your support, both throughout my panic attack and the remainder of the trip, aquatic refuge and all. Being human, it is all I can do to attempt to say thank you- so that is exactly what I will do. <br /><br />THANK YOU!!! <br /><br />So, social niceties having been presented, what is this thing called the real world and just exactly how do I get back in? Do I even want to?? Hmm. <br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to kick back and watch my walls move for another few hours.&nbsp; ;D ;D :-*

				Thanks for the suggestion! I&#039;ll be sure to check it out when(if)ever I get the chance.<br /><br />If you really want chaos, try insufflated 5-Meo-DMT + LSD. I love killing my ego though, so it may not be for everyone. <br /><br />With respect to ketamine, I feel like I get that dark vibe that you mention regardless of whatever dissociative I am using. PCP is a whole different story from K and DXM though, or even its&#039; 3-Meo/4-Meo analogues. For me, dissociatives have always been a great way of getting ready for family functions. But PCP.... not a good one.
