				Sorry for the stupid question, but what is the difference between N,N-DMT, Changa, and freebase DMT, and their effects. Thanks for any help!

				freebase refers to N,N DMT in its freebase form vs fumurate. (fumurate is a salt form, while its smokeable in its freebase form)<br />changa is a blend with other herbals<br /><br />you may want to browse www.dmt-nexus.me has some decent info regarding a lot of these types of topics.

				Changa is also said to last longer than NN DMT but NN DMT is still the main ingredient in changa. The herb just makes the trip experience about 30 minutes<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				N,N-DMT refers to the freebase form of DMT, which is less stable than the fumarate form, but has a lower boiling point (easier to smoke).&nbsp; Both of these crystals can be ingested via vaporization, but the freebase doesn&#039;t require as hot of a flame.<br />Changa is basically some herbs (any kind: mullein, mint, caapi) soaked in a DMT solution, then allowed to dry so the solvent evaporates out and leaves the DMT behind inside the leaves of the herb.&nbsp; Think of it like smokable DMT blotter paper (but not paper :P).&nbsp; It&#039;s simply a much easier way to smoke DMT, though some people also like to use an herb with its own effects.&nbsp; Some of these herbs are claimed to prolong or intensify the experience.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24247.msg255684#msg255684">Quote from: Trainwrecked on May 24, 2012, 02:20 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, so Changa...&nbsp; How much would be considered a fun time for me and my g/f and maybe a friend or two to enjoy together for a day?&nbsp; Been interested in DMT, and extremely interested in Changa.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a few friends who would enjoy it, and I know me and my g/f want to try it.&nbsp; So how much should I get so we can sit around for a day/night and enjoy?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your question is difficult to answer for a couple reasons.&nbsp; First, changa has variable amounts of DMT, depending on how it&#039;s made.&nbsp; DiMiTriSpice, for example, sells changa that is 1/3 DMT by weight, so smoking 0.1g of it would be like smoking 33mg of DMT (a medium dose).<br /><br />Second, no offense intended, but perhaps you should do a bit more reading on the subject of DMT before diving in head first.&nbsp; It&#039;s not really a social chemical, one that will provide a &quot;fun time&quot; with friends.&nbsp; If you correctly smoke DMT and break through, you will not be capable of communicating with other people.&nbsp; You will probably not know you are a person or that you have a body, and you won&#039;t be able to see your environment or interact with it.&nbsp; A breakthrough DMT experience may as well transport you to another world in another dimension, with its own laws of physics and ways of doing things.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to frighten anyone, but it&#039;s not an experience to be taken lightly, and it&#039;s nothing like doing LSD, mushrooms, 2c&#039;s, MDMA, etc. and having a fun trip/roll with your mates.&nbsp; Even if you all wanted to trip at the same time, I would recommend against it.&nbsp; Someone should be sober to ensure everything goes well (you don&#039;t drop the bong when you blast off, for example) and the tripper(s) stay safe.&nbsp; Also, I personally would be uncomfortable going into a DMT experience with an audience.&nbsp; Having one safe sitter with whom you&#039;re comfortable and familiar is one thing, but having a few people sitting around watching you trip out?&nbsp; Not my cup of tea.<br /><br />The experience will probably last 10-30 minutes, though it will probably feel much MUCH longer to you.&nbsp; I doubt you&#039;ll want to do it over and over again to make a day of it.<br /><br />I hope all of this didn&#039;t come off as negative or scary, I know reading about DMT can be overwhelming.&nbsp; DMT can provide the most beautiful, enlightening experience, but I would be remiss if I didn&#039;t discuss the other side of things.

				Good point.&nbsp; How about just me and my g/f?&nbsp; I&#039;m not new to DMT.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen people on it, been around it, etc.&nbsp; Changa is the only new aspect that is new to me.&nbsp; DMT is fairly common around here, but extremely expensive.&nbsp; Always been interested.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been told some amazing stories.&nbsp; One story involved my friend being held by God and crying in his arms.&nbsp; It sounds like an amazing journey, to me.&nbsp;

				Changa is best, in my opinion.&nbsp; It&#039;s so easy to dose compared to straight up crystals.&nbsp; A scale that can accurately weigh &lt;100mg tends to be a bit expensive, but with changa you can weigh in much larger increments.&nbsp; It&#039;s also pretty damn easy to smoke, you can kind of treat it like cannabis and burn down a bowl in a pipe or bong.&nbsp; At first, apply the flame gently for a few seconds, like you&#039;re just trying to pull hot air through.&nbsp; Then angle the flame slightly more directly until you get the bowl cherrying, and finish it off.&nbsp; You should try to do it all in a couple hits, you have limited time!&nbsp; See here for dosing information (clearnet!): erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/dmt_dose.shtml

				Hi,<br /><br />For someone who is new to DMT, changa is the better choice. There&#039;s a couple reasons. One, smoking freebase D can be tough for the uninitiated, especially if you&#039;re trying an oil burner or light bulb etc. (really you should spend the hour and make the machine). Because of the flavor and intensity (which lets face it, can take a min. to get used to), it will be difficult for first time users - especially those who don&#039;t regularly smoke tobacco or cannabis - to hold in for the necessary 15-20 seconds. Changa is a bit more gracious, though you will certainly taste the D. Smoke it in a bong - it will be pretty easy - and if you do it correctly, you will have a fantastic time. Pure D is stronger, stranger, and if you open yourself up, strange and beautiful things will come. In a vaporizer, when you smoke it correctly, it will surely change your perspective. Hope this helps.<br /><br />Paz,<br />DiMiTri
