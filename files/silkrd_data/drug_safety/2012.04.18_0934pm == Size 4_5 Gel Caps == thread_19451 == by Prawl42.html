				Hey all,<br /><br />Looking to cap up some 2-cb for just ease of use.<br /><br />Apart from the obvious and possibly quite tedious method of doing each one by hand are there any pressers/capping machines that are not super expensive? Iv done&nbsp; a fair bit of research before making this post and iv only been able to find 0 + 00 press&#039;s.<br /><br />Any info you could provide would be great :)<br /><br />Also for 2-cb would size 4 or 5 caps be more suitable ?<br /><br />Thanks in advance <br /><br />-P

				They do not make home cappers for sizes below about #1. Size 4 or 5 would be super tiny anyway. They are filled by automatic machines which are very expensive and used by manufacturers. I suggest mixing your 2-cb with another powder and capping with a larger size cap. Use corn starch to mix with white powders. Its yellowish and you can see if any lumps of white are in it and crush them all up. Mix up your stuff and cap one by hand and see if its the right potency. If it works then cap it all up. Cap &#039;m quick makes a #1 size capper

I think I paid around $150 for a set of filler plates covering size 5-00 from china. Size 4 is actually my preferred capsule size. Using 0 and 00 Caps looks unprofessional....and makes people feel like they are being scammed..Smaller colored capsules, and using specific colors for specific compounds works best for me on compounds that Ive too little movement to bother tableting.<br /><br />If you are unable to procure or are unwilling to spend the initial money for an encapsulator.....you can easily cap #4 DIY. Take a sheet of cardboard. Use a BIC pen to press through the cardboard between two ribs....press just until the smaller removable section of the writing nib has penetrated fully...do not push until the pen color indicator portion has penetrated. Repeat this action 10 times then skipping one cardboard rib repeat the series of 10....until you have the desired number of capsules. <br /><br />Assuming you have 1 gram of active material....1000mg....100 holes will give you 10mg.....50 holes 20mg etc.<br />Press the small side of each capsule into a hole. Then without measure or concern for uniformity....dump your active onto the cardboard and scrape it all into capsules....this obviously is not what you want at the end.....once your cardboard no longer has active material available to fill the capsules....spoon some powdered sugar (cornstarch can actually inhibit the uptake of some compounds) Level off the sugar until every capsule is full.<br /><br />Put your cardboard with improperly filled but full capsules into a ziplock bag. Flip the whole assembly over and carefully tap the capsules backside with a pen until all material has fallen out into the bag. If any capsules fall out just reinsert them into their holes when emptied. <br /><br />Thoroughly mix you active and sugar. Put the mixed powder back into the capsules. Then carefully press the capsules up from the backside exposing the capsules walls....place the larger capsule halves on top of the capsules....then once they are all covered begin squeezing them one at a time until the capsules &quot;click&quot; engages.<br />

				N2DEEP, that&#039;s a pretty useful post.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t thought about that method for mixing the powders and making the capping easy at the same time.&nbsp; My only concern is actually EVENLY mixing the powders.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s possible to get anything near a homogenous mixture of two powders without some serious work.&nbsp; If one is smaller than the other, won&#039;t it settle to the bottom?<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been hesitant to use powders directly, so I dose things volumetrically, in a liquid solution.&nbsp; I would like to be able to use a method like the one you mentioned to make homemade capsules that are dosed accurately.&nbsp; Have you ever run into the problem of a capsule that obviously had too much/too little?

				APPA:<br /><br />homogeneous mixture is relatively easy. As for settling...that takes time....I imagine if one were to place a few capsules in a fixed orientation and applied vibration....you might very well have some substances separate....but once closed its in the capsule...so no real concern. The greater risk, in my experience and opinion, for dose variability lies not in the risk of uneven mixture...not that it is impossible to poorly mix but assuming one is thorough...but rather the uniformity of pack density. It is common practice to &quot;tamp&quot; down capsules add additional powder and tamp again. I do not bother with this and never have. A uniform mixture spread quickly and evenly should yield fairly even fills. I DO, however, like to take my completed batch.... Weigh it as a whole, then I weight 2-3 decreasing quantities (ie whole batch 100 caps, 2nd weigh 50, 3rd weigh 10).....provided the results of my weighing are consistent, I then randomly select a small percent for individual weighing. <br /><br />If you were SERIOUSLY concerned about the uniformity of their compounding...I guess you could select a filler with a good solubility in a similar liquid as your active ingredient..one could dissolve both filler and active then evaporate off the solvent. I dont really think its necessary though. <br /><br />Baseball:<br />I cannot for the life of me remember where I got my capsulators.....its been years....but my friend just picked up a 100 capsule number 4 filler off, Miracle Cottage International on aliexpress for $75 delivered.<br /><br />Simply:<br />Tpac funnel would be a huge PITA their sheet style encapsulators are good but retardedly overpriced.....$900+.<br />

				Thanks for clarifying, N2DEEP.&nbsp; It sounds like you&#039;ve got that system down perfectly.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to give it a try in the future.
