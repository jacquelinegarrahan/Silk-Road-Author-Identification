				A few nights ago, I dropped .250 grams of my MDA order from the ILF (very legit vendor, I highly recommend) after a two-month break from MDMA. Here are my takeaway thoughts: <br /><br />1) MDA is a much more psychedelic/less euphoric version of MDMA. I knew this was to be expected going in, but the visuals were much more &quot;trippy&quot; than I had imagined, producing some nice CEV&#039;s t:4:00-t:9:00 after dropping. The euphoric impulses also felt somewhat muted, lasting only t:1:00 - t:3:30 and did not lead to the personal introspective thoughts I&#039;ve come to expect from MDMA. <br /><br />2) The MDA experience is a two-parter; the first is like a normal roll and the second is somewhat similar to a mild LSD trip. Although the first &quot;euphoric&quot; stage only lasts a few hours, the second stage lasted 2x as long. Hence, MDA felt much longer lasting than MDMA, as I still had lingering visuals and huge pupils 20+ hours after dropping. <br /><br />3) The MDA hangover is absolutely terrible, much worse than MDMA&#039;s. I&#039;ve never felt that mentally broken before, it was as if I was experiencing temporary brain damage. I struggled to put simple sentences together, and it felt like someone was driving a pick axe into my skull. Just thinking about it is giving me migraines...<br />&nbsp;Now granted, .250mg is a heavy dose for me and I wish I had halved it, but I&#039;ve had pleasant comedowns on MDMA after using .400mg&#039;s in a night. This experience was in a league of its own. <br /><br />Final thoughts: <br /><br />Would I do MDA again? Probably, although I&#039;d take it in lower doses/combined with MDMA next time and in a different setting. It seems ideal for use at a festival or psychedelic show, but definitely not in a solitary setting, as the therapeutic self-reflection felt toned down vs. the one experienced on MDMA. Just not worth the mental anguish I felt coming down. <br /><br />Overall, an interesting experience, even taking into consideration its negative aspects. I&#039;d recommend any seasoned molly veteran at least give it a try, although I caution anyone buying it as a replacement to MDMA, as the two are definitely not one in the same! <br /><br />Anyways, thanks for reading! If you have any personal insight to add, it would be very much appreciated.<br /><br />

				I had pretty similar experiences with the MDA I got from ilf. The come up/rolling is definitely extremely similar to molly, but much shorter (2-3 hours is a good approximation), and then the tripping feeling kicks in (lasts 3-5+ hours). I&#039;d compare the tripping to an odd mix between mushies and acid. No visuals or anything, just that body high feeling you get when on psychedelics. I found it very nice and relaxing, and after spending a few hours playing beerpong, chess, having crazy conversations and running around having fun it was really nice to just lay back and listen to some tunes and let my mind float off for a couple hours.<br /><br />I agree with you about the hangover part of it (I got it pretty bad), but I also only got 4-5 hours of sleep before having to get up very early to catch a bus and drank 8-10 beers. Definitely felt pretty braindead for a good 12+hours or so, but after getting a full night of sleep I woke up feeling pretty damn good the next day.<br /><br />Overall I feel with MDA you can&#039;t push it too much (anything over 175mg in a night is probably not a great idea) and you have to make sure to get rest afterwards, whereas with MDMA you can push your limits a little bit more and theres definitely less of a comedown with it. <br /><br />Still sitting on a good bit of a bag that I got from Ilf and fully intend on doing it again.

				250mg of MDA is a bit much. Like by about a third probably. I like to mix MDMA and MDA at a 2:1 ratio with a bit of methamphetamine or cocaine, or both.

				Hey thanks guys for your $.02, glad I&#039;m not alone on this one. Most of what I read on the subjects hints at higher neurotoxicity for MDA vs. MDMA, and my experience with it suggests the same (http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/13lp0b/mdma_neurotoxicity_part_1_metabolites/) Really felt like I did a gram of the stuff, I&#039;m just now pulling myself out of a emotional lull (thanks 5-HTP!). <br /><br />I like the ratio ideas, 2:1 MDMA: MDA seems about right with no more than 150mg - 175mg of MDA ever again. I&#039;ve read reports that stimulants like coke and speed only increases the neurotoxic effects of molly though, so I question the meth/coke + MDMA combo. Seems like it would heighten the chance of dehydration at the very least.

				My first time on MDA, I thought it was MDMA. I had been buying MDMA from the guy, I had a test kit but didn&#039;t test it cus it looked and tasted like all the other shit i got from him.<br /><br />But yeah, I ate about 225mg and got floored. I was at a concert in Colorado, and I couldn&#039;t even stand up. Everything in my perferial vision had an electric look to it. It was great, just a bit too intense. I had lock-jaw even worse than what I&#039;m used to on MDMA, and the next day I felt like shiiit. <br /><br />I&#039;d really like to try 90mg of MDA with 90mg of MDMA <br /><br />Speaking of I have just about enough coin for a gram of MDA....
