				Hello to everybody!<br /><br />Everybody of us know that Subutex have ah opiate blocker!<br /><br />Xanax AND Diazepam have not ah blocker but it have a chemical structure which is very very important for users which mix benzo&#039;s!<br />Both have ah very&nbsp; long-acting partial agonist as metabolites, so every other benzo you take after Alprazolam and Diazepam have no effect, maybe ah little 5% but it is a waste to take other benzo&#039;s if you take before diazepam or alprazolam! <br /><br />Alprazolam have not a long half-life period but diazepam have the longest, so you have wait one day (24 hours and more) that other benzo&#039;s have the full effect!<br /><br /><br />For example you take 3mg Xanax (or 30mg Diazepam) and want to get more high and take 6mg Bromazepam and 5mg Flunitrazpam , the Bromazepam and Flunitrazepam have no effect , (i would say only 5-10%) but as i mentioned before it is a waste of the stuff!<br /><br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Diamond<br /><br />If you know the chemical structure of Xanax, and you have a knowledge in chemistry, you will see it in the Gaba

				Thanks for the warning.<br /><br />I just wanted to add that the elimination half life of alprazolam and diazepam is actually WAY WAY longer then you said.<br /><br />Alprazolam has and this is from the wikipedia benzo comparison page a half life of 9-20 hours (depends widely on the user) and diazepam 20-100 hours with it&#039;s active metabolite lasting 36-200 hours.<br /><br />That&#039;s just the time for HALF the benzo you took to be eliminated from your body.&nbsp; So you&#039;re looking at weeks of waiting if you want a full benzo experience.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice though, really, not trolling you at all.<br /><br />And are you talking about the GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid ... did I get that right?&nbsp; off top of my head lol) receptor system in your brain?&nbsp; (vs. NMDA receptors)?&nbsp; Do I win a prize?

				Hey, oh i know you are not Ã¤hm ah guy which&nbsp; have good knowledge! Maybe ah medical student or something like that, or you are very interrested in this kind of prescription, also could be, but this knowledge you can&#039;t google, and also if you get ah box(diaz or xanax) from you doctor there is no sentence where stand&#039;s don&#039;t mix it with other benzo&#039;s because this don&#039;t have any effects! :( :(<br /><br />yes of course alpra have a longer half time, but diazepam is the king depending on half time !<br /><br />But i read last in some feedback that a guy writes: warning this benzo&#039;s are fake, i take a whole blister, and before i also take Diazepam and i don&#039;t fall asleep! ;D ;D<br /><br />So i think 85% which takes benzo&#039;s don&#039;t know this!<br /><br />So i only want to write this, because i know that every minute people are wasting their stuff! <br /><br />Yes if you want i send you a price! If you live within EU i could send you something :-) , only a little!<br /><br />Regards (PS: you can give me some +karma for this good post :-)&nbsp; )<br /><br />&nbsp;;) ;) ;) BTW: i need a loan of 0,02, give back next week on friday 0,1 Coins!

				Yes, you need to be very careful from whom you buy your benzo&#039;s.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good reason this forum exist&#039;s, because for example there&#039;s been an ongoing thread about best benzo vendor&#039;s at that time, so if you read the freshest posts you can get a bit more confidence in which buyer you choose.<br /><br />BTG (Black Tuna Gang) = Diazepam.&nbsp; Man, they are the best place to go, I have never had diazepam (valium) that&#039;s as good as theirs!&nbsp; They just came back to SR too thank god.<br /><br />I appreciate your offer but i&#039;m ok and not in need of any of the benzos I take ... unless you have Nitrazepam.&nbsp; I only bought a few like 30 and i&#039;ve come to quite adore them.&nbsp; I&#039;m in North America too :(<br />

				I&#039;m not sure that this any new information though.<br /><br />Especially good old valium has a halflife that can be something from 2 says to a full week, depending on the person taking it. <br /><br />If you consider this a bad or a good thing depends on what you want to use the drug for. If you are looking to treat problems like anxiety the long half life is useful, as taking a fixed daily dose wil result in an ever increasing blood level. This allows the patient to get used to the side effects without getting the full brunt of the desired effect right away.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you were to use a benzo to cancel a bad trip, long lasting drugs like diazepam would not but the substance of choice, and you&#039;d be better off using drugs that have much shorter halflives such as oxazepam, xanax or nitrazepam.

				All fast-acting benzo&#039;s would be useful in such a scenario.<br /><br />Flunitrazepam is very good on paper really, but it is difficult to obtain due to its reputation as a &#039;date rape drug&#039;. This reputation may not be warranted at all since most users actually take it themselves and don&#039;t slip it into anyone elses drink. <br /><br />Comparing price, availability and such, xanax probably is your best bet to cancel a bad trip. It&#039;s not the very best substance in the world for this function, but it is something very widely available, with good shelf life and reliable suppliers. <br /><br />If you have to treat a bad trip and all you have is valium, you should use it though. It&#039;s onset speed is about as fast as xanax. The equivalent effective dose is about 10 to 20 that of xanax (i.e. you need 10 to 20 mg of diazepam to get the same effect as 1 mg alprazolam). <br /><br />The main downside of using valium for this is its long half life. If you were to give someone 50 mg of valium to cancel a trip gone wrong, chances are that person would be affected for a week if not used to taking benzodiazepines. But that may actually be preferable to continuing a bad trip with the antidote within arms reach despite such consequences... this is something you need to decide on the spot, and will not have much time to contemplate when push comes to shove.

				@Ben: What do you mean with this sentence: &quot;Flunitrazepam is very good on paper really====????&quot;<br /><br />and i never would waste a roofie for another person, can somebody be so stupid?&nbsp; ;D<br />No way, and only because it was in the past a topic it would be also in 100 years a topic!<br /><br />I am not sure but i think nowadays it is more a myth than a true incident in these days! but i am not sure!<br /><br />regards

I do not claim this is fact, but authorities believe so, and it is more scrutinized than any other benzo. <br /><br />This is not a matter of my personal opinion either: Internationally flunitrazepam is a schedule-III controlled substance, where virtually all other benzo&#039;s are schedule-IV. This could make a distinct difference if you were to get caught transporting the substance across international borders - schedule IV drugs include many prescription drugs which you could be using legally, even if you do not have the documentation to prove that on you. Chances are customs would let you go if it a small amount for personal use. <br /><br />In case of a schedule-III substances they may get a bit more inquisitive, and ask to provide a script for the medication, and may want to contact the prescribing physician and such. This would obviously be a problem if you got the drugs by other means.
