				I need a scale that will be on point with ounces (of weed and shrooms). Will any best selling cheap kitchen scale work well for zips? I just need it to be as accurate as possible. At least when it says 28, it really means 28.

				For MG I really like this one: *CLEARNET*&nbsp; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UACEHS/<br /><br />It is cheap and super accurate.&nbsp; But that isn&#039;t going to work for ounces.<br /><br />To buy a scale that can properly weigh ounces and be accurate to the mg level you will end up spending a ton.<br /><br />If your minimum sale prices will really just be ounces just get one that is accurate to .1g and you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; There&#039;s a billion out there and they all work the same.&nbsp; Unless you need more precision I wouldn&#039;t sweat it too much.&nbsp; &nbsp;And if you do, get that one above plus another for bigger amounts or be prepared to spend several hundred at least to get one that can do both.

				I got a new scale today - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003STEIYY/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br /><br />Works perfectly for ounces and grams. Had to get it to replace a similar scale. Platform is large enough to put a large cup on it as a weight platform. The tray can be used as a weight platform too, just pull it off the scale (won&#039;t break if you&#039;re quick about it).<br /><br />hooby you&#039;re right, a scale that accurately weights ounces to the mg level is expensive. I was looking on a website that has a shit ton of different scales. http://www.oldwillknottscales.com/

Don&#039;t let the reviews on Amazon scare you from experiencing it yourself. Just don&#039;t expect it to accurately weigh less than 10mg. Anything over that should work just fine though. So yeah, it&#039;ll be good for 2C-E, but definitely not for something of a greater potency, such as xanax powder... because if the bulk powder xanax on SR is as strong as some say, you wouldn&#039;t wanna fuck around with a few MG off.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking at it&#039;s bigger bro, the Gemini Pro: http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-GPR-20-Gemini-PRO-Milligram/dp/B003STEJD4<br /><br />It&#039;s 30 bucks more, but I&#039;m not sure about there overall quality.

				Blade has worked well for me... Had one for about 7 months and it only got to about .04 off on 100g which is pretty damn consistent.&nbsp; You can get it online or at just about any tobacco store.

You could buy ah weight where you could reset the scale , we does this in our company but it is not necessary! <br />To check the precision look in the internet there you can find for every moneycoin the weight for example in this link:<br /><br />Weight of Euro Moneycoins:<br />http://euro.raddos.de/deutsch/muenzen.php<br /><br />For other coins from other country just google and tip weight of american moneycoins!<br /><br />So you can check the precision of the Scale!<br /><br />Regards ;)

				I got a few of these and they work great, been using it for about 5 years now. Any diamond scale will work. If you really want to be on the exact weight go with a triple beam, I got mine for a $100 10 years ago...lol still works wonders. If you&#039;re going to be doing zips of weed and shrooms the scale below is what you want for zips. Just tare the baggy before and you&#039;re golden. I should also mention don&#039;t go with a kitchen scale, it&#039;s not as accurate as a diamond scale, it&#039;s off actually and just expensive for nothing. Best place to look is on ebay it&#039;s so cheap.. If you really worried about precision buy one that you can calibrate yourself and buy a set of the weights..<br />&nbsp;<br />*CLEAR NET*<br />http://www.ebay.com/itm/500g-x-0-1g-Digital-Pocket-Scale-CS-500-Portable-Jewelry-Scale-/230995389899?pt=US_Pocket_Digital_Scales&amp;hash=item35c865edcb

				The scale mentioned on DX is actually incredibly good value. <br /><br />Considering how cheap it is, it has amazing resolution, and is also fairly accurate. One thing to keep in mind with cheap scales like these is to verify they are still accurate quite often. You can do so by a reference weight, which is included with the DX scale. The reference is said to be 10 grams, but may read a bit off from that (say, 9.995 or 10.1 grams) which is all fine. Just check that the reference weight keeps giving you the same readout over time.<br /><br />If you want to compensate for the last percent of error or so, you can weight the reference weight on an analytical balance which will give you its exact mass (this will not be 10.000000 grams). These things are not far off however, i&#039;ve tried to weigh some of the 10&nbsp; gram reference weights on proper lab equipment and found them to be very well within 1% of the advertised value. <br /><br />Bottom line is that these scales are far more accurate compared to, say, the scale you weigh fruits on in a supermarket, and are amazingly cheap. I have no idea on how they manage to make a scale so accurate for 20 bucks, but verification doesn&#039;t lie: they just are!<br />

				todays market is flooded with digital pocket scales. very cheaply priced which is great but you get a cheap product and inaccuracies in weighing. probably not a huge deal if you plan on weighing ounces cause +/- 100mg isnt a big deal when your buying that much. if your only weighing 100mg, most of the corner store/head shop .01g scales arnt even good enough. not all scales are created equal, not even close when it comes to 3rd world country sweatshops trying to produce the cheapest product possible. i was able to mess around with a high precision scale in a laboratory and we compared 3 scales, all measuring in .01 and they were all inaccurate, obviously your not going to get the same result compared to a top of the line lab scale, but some were better then others. often a scale will be very accurate at a certain point in its range, i guess like a sweet spot and then fluctuate at other points. thats why if you have a .01g-50g scale and you weigh 28g it might be almost dead on but if you weigh 3.5g 8 times and throw it all in the bag you might have 29.4g or something. <br />if i&#039;m weighing different amounts, i like to have multiple scales for different weights. a set of calibration weights is priceless and you can get nice sets from 10mg-1000g on ebay for under $20. i would get a scale that only weighs to 50g or 100g. the less range, the less inaccuracies. calibrate with a 50g and just use it for 28g weighs. dont use it too weigh 500mg unless you recalibrate with a 500mg weight. never bounce, shake, walk with in pocket or expose to extreme temps. leave in on and always weigh on a flat surface you should have some pretty solid reads. calibrate on a regular basis too.
