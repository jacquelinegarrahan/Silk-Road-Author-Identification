				I smoked weed last Wednesday, and had laggy vision while high. This has been happening for the last few weeks, but everytime has went away 100% after sobering up. <br /><br />Laggy vision, or frame vision, is like playing a movie or game in low frame rates, almost like my brain is trying to keep up with the barrage of visual information. I say this because closing one eye helps me see better. <br /><br />But this time it has me worried. I went to a eye doctor yesterday, 20/20 vision, &quot;perfect&quot; eyes. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t seem to be getting better, I wouldn&#039;t say its getting worse though either. <br /><br />I&#039;ve read online this happening to people after getting high, but usually goes away after sobering up. <br /><br />I&#039;m afraid I could have done some permanent damage with it, but not really sure. I&#039;m 99% my weed was clean and not laced. Of all things I take weed to fuck me up, weed... <br /><br />Has this ever happened to anyone else? <br /><br />I&#039;m going to wait a week or so before I go to a neurologist or something of the sorts. <br /><br />Stay safe

				i definitely know what you are referring to, i have experienced it before on weed when i had a very low tolerance and psychedelics <br /><br />it never persisted beyond the period of intoxication however for me. i dont think the weed would have caused any permanent damage however. you arent taking any other medication or drugs in addition to smoking?<br /><br />i cant imagine you having dealt with it for 3 days honestly... how did you drive?<br /><br />just curious, did you get the bud from a SR vendor?

It was about a week after E and drinking that I smoked and this happened, I was just smoking weed and this happened. I went to bed high, seeing frames, expecting to be fine Thursday morning. Went to class seeing like that, its weird, I still have 20/20 vision, just my framerates aren&#039;t smooth. <br /><br />And, no, I bought it from a buddy, but he smokes the same shit so I doubt he would lace it.

				hopefully you just got super baked and still havent come down completely <br /><br />it takes a while to process out cannabinoids so even though you dont feel as high there may be residual low levels still effecting your visual cortex or something that may be more sensitive then the other regions... nothing about weed should permanently alter your neurochemistry in such a significant way

				I think it may be a side affect of the MDMA or E you took before smoking.. even tho it was weeks before..<br /><br />I dont know why this happens but i stopped doing MDMA because it happened to me a few times.. I even got dizzy spells because of the eyes lagging on me... it was one of the worst side effects I have ever dealt with...<br /><br />I could be wrong but I really think MDMA has something to do with this.. the weed was just a trigger.. the mdma was the bullet&nbsp;

				frame vision is a very common occurrence smoking weed, therefore i dont think it has anything to do with the mdma in my opinion<br /><br />i have done way to much mdma and never had any effects like frame vision, but i did get frame vision frequently from smoking before starting to use mdma<br /><br />i did some research and there are numerous people who report lingering effects from high dose marijuana, even up to weeks after<br /><br />generally its a sensation that i personally get, an electric tingling numbness that persists after i have stopped feeling high as well, even for days - i just dont get frame vision anymore because of my tolerance<br /><br />your visual circuits are still just receiving more input than they are used to processing...<br /><br />i am sure the effects will subside over the next few days or week - the worst thing to do is freak out and think you will be like that forever, its a very common thought with psychedelics and basically never true... <br /><br />maybe next time try smoking a little less and that might help

				I recommend you go see an actual medical doctor and explain exactly what happened. Your doctor will know 10x more than a couple dudes on the internet. I&#039;ve been hospitalized after smoking resin and told the doctors about it, they&#039;re not going to report you or anything. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the story, if you want it. I was playing THUG2 and had no weed (weed+THUG2=bliss), so I decided to take some resin hits. Every 5 minutes or so I took another hit. I got up to take a piss, and realized that I had been doing this for two hours. I walked to the bathroom and mid stream I passed out. I came to and stepped out the door, then passed out. I got up again, feeling lightheaded, and I tripped down a small flight of stairs hitting each step with my face on the way down. I stood up, and felt like passing out again so I stayed at the bottom of the stairs. This is when I realized things were seriously not cool. <br /><br />My brother and his roommates called the ambulance and I went to the hospital. I was there for three days. Every time I tried to stand, I would immediately pass out. The doctors thought it was most likely from inhaling too much butane or that possibly I was in shock, from being so goddamn high and falling on my face. <br /><br />Be safe guys!

				Frame vision as you call it, its not that uncommon even without the effects of substances. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what causes it exactly or why its bothersome to some people but others suffer no effect at all, but i recognize it personally. Traffic lights have been upgraded from using lightbulbs to LEDs, blinking at a european 100 Hz here. In my central vision thats all okay, but in my peripheral vision these lights keep annoying me. Same deal with some other panels that flash, such as the destination displayed lit up on busses and such.<br /><br />I think its a matter of being used to it though. I started noticing these things once i went from working with a crt screen to a tft, effectively taking out the constant bombardment with 60-80 hz stroble light flashing in my face for most of the day. <br /><br />Eye tests will probably not provide an answer though. Those only measure your ability to focus on a static chart far away, and there would be no reason to assume you could not do so with these problems. Imho this is not an issue with the eyes themselves, but with how the brain processes the visual information.

				What your describing sounds a little like depersonalization disorder, look it up and let me know if it makes sense to you.<br /><br />If that is what you are experiencing do not freak out and just go about your life normally, the disorder feeds on anxiety and may go away or it may never go away.<br /><br />I know because I&#039;ve had it most of my life (non-drug induced)

				It&#039;s too specific to be classified as such really.<br /><br />The issue is that blinking/strobing lights in the peripheral vision attract way more attention then they normally should. As such this is not very problematic to deal with at all, but its an interesting observation. I&#039;ve done quite a bit of work with eye hazards (such as powerful lasers) to tell the difference between a problem that originates in the eye and one originates in the brain. <br /><br />The eye is normally pretty sensitive to rapid changes in the peripheral vision, which is a perfectly sound thing considering human evolution.<br /><br />I suppose the difference is that we went from having blinking crt monitors and tvs all around us to calmer lcd monitors by now. <br /><br />This just requires adjusting though. Humans are pretty flexible when it comes to that, and the distracting effect of bliking traffic lights and such does diminish over time. To me traffic lights are still strobes, but i just got used to that and can mostly ignore that by now.

				It doesnt sound to me like you are describing what i am referring to, and what i believe the OP is talking about from what you have said<br /><br />what i meant was certainly not normal, and i have never known anyone who has experienced that was not on a drug/psychedelic<br /><br />the effect is as if you visual input is actually like the reel of a movie. you dont get a constant visual feed but instead the input is jumpy especially as you move around... as if the movie frame rate is too slow and instead of a steady movie you actually see each frame of the movie jump by one by one, except in this case the movie is your vision. so its not smooth, you just get one image, then another image, then another - like a picture flip book of still images that forms an animation playing too slowly <br /><br />is that the same effect you are commenting about? <br /><br />and mtljohn - i understand where you are coming from, you definitely had a good point. i think in your case it was possibly the lack of the excessive serotonin so your receptors were becoming re-sensitized and therefore you were more susceptible to some of the serotonergic changes from smoking the bud...&nbsp; i think these effects on the visual cortex are common with weed alone for some people though that maybe are particularly sensitive already, as i mentioned my experience before ever using mdma, and experiencing the same effect which is just why is said it wasnt the mdma actually causing it, but the weed - just that the mdma made you more sensitive to that particular effect of the weed you were not before
