				Title asks the question.&nbsp; Seems like everyone has something that they would never even consider trying.<br /><br />Crack, meth, and heroin are the ones I&#039;m cautious about.&nbsp; After reading about meth, I wanted to try so I have some on the way and I might try heroin by snorting it.&nbsp; Injection still scares me.

				It&#039;s hard to advise against one particular drug. Everybody reacts differently to every drug. Some people have more of a tendency to get addicted than others. Some people have less common sense than others as well.<br /><br />My only advice would be to do your RESEARCH on whatever drug you&#039;re trying. That way, you know what dose to take, what to expect and what side effects to look out for bla bla. If you&#039;re prone to addiction, avoid the drugs that can easily become addictive. If you have a heart condition avoid Stims etc... Some people can take H once and leave it (like myself) and others it consumes their life.<br /><br />If you&#039;re smart and you know your limits, you can decide what drugs you can try or should avoid. But just because you would avoid a drug, doesn&#039;t mean someone else would. Everybody is different.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not really sure about the mouthwash thing. In western europe mouthwash rarely contains usable amounts of ethanol, but i suppose that must be different in the US since people are drinking it for the alcohol. Then again, i also read that some people ingest disinfecting gel because it contains a lot of&nbsp; alcohol and is often freely available from public restrooms and such.<br /><br />Where sniffing glue is concerned: i have never tried it myself, but i&#039;ve seen plenty of kids do it in countries like cambodia. Similarly, i heard about people inhaling things like deodorant spray cans since the solvents/carrier gas (mostly propane) has a similar effect. <br /><br />It doesnt appeal to me personally, but i suppose you could knock yourself out using a gas canister intended for a camping stove quite easily. I presume the side effect of that would be waking up with a terrible headache (or not waking up again at all), so it does not sound that appealing to me.

				I&#039;ve tried pretty much every drug under the sun, and if I had to stay away from one drug it would be crack.<br /><br />Yeah I know, not original. But I got hooked on crack 8 years ago and spent a year doing crazy stuff like robbing cars, houses, and pawning family items to fuel my habit. The thing with crack is, there is never enough. You are always fiending and looking for more. I made so many bad decisions back then and did so many things that would put me away for a long time that it&#039;s a miracle I didn&#039;t get caught by LE.<br /><br />I eventually quit and cleaned myself up, but not after I broke a lot of bridges and engaged in some very shady shit. I&#039;m still ashamed of what I did back then.<br /><br />Stay away from crack guys.

				Crocodile. lol obv.<br /><br />When I first heard of it I thought, how can someone be so insanely stupid.<br />But I found out that those are hardcore H addicts who don&#039;t have the money for H and have nothing to loose anymore.<br />Sad but true.<br /><br />In general every drug is dangerous if you become addicted, but MOST drugs CAN be used responsibly.<br /><br />To answer your question, there is a lot of shit I would never try. But if we speak about common drugs, I personally would never try H.

				Heroin<br /><br />Because my father put the fear into me from an early age regarding it. I know people on here do it so don&#039;t wanna sound to harsh but I have seen it destroy communities, families and leave a lot of deaths of young people behind. It destroyed towns and areas in the early 80&#039;s and again in 90&#039;s.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure once taken and enjoyed and controlled by a user it&#039;s all good but what I said above is true for a lot of people.

				I like that link, seems somewhat accurate.<br /><br />It really seems like a LOT of people are in the ER for alcohol related issues (either falling down, liver failure and the myriad of problems that accompany it, sometimes kidney issues, just being a chronic alcoholic and having jacked up electrolytes and thiamine levels/ability to absorb nutrients).<br /><br />Also, there seem to be a lot who combine alcohol with oxy or random other opiates/benzos to get a better buzz (especially opiate pills actually) and that&#039;s a major cause of liver damage and death.... you see people who&#039;s livers stop working, fluid seeps into their abdominal cavity or lungs and they drown in their own fluid.... or varicees pop and they bleed to death internally (eventually it comes out the two ends) and even being in the ER survival rate is so-so. Then there&#039;s the jaundice chronic alcoholic who can&#039;t stop and keeps getting resuscitated from end stage liver disease and MAYBE makes out of a coma after 1 month (these are people in their late 30&#039;s-40&#039;s.... I&#039;m talking multiple people per week... it&#039;s not a slow hospital by any means, but still, that&#039;s a lot for one problem).<br /><br />Besides that, CRACK, heroin = never.<br />And meth... there seem to be a lot of people with long term depression because of meth so I don&#039;t think so. Not to mention some people seem to age by a decade after one year of use.... ever see those meth face ads?<br />Cigarettes, obviously.... got the nicotine replacement but I know it&#039;s still bad. damn tobacco industry.... seriously a lot in the ER with smoking related COPD, asthma, CHF (congestive heart failure)....plus the little kids from the poor area always coming in with asthma attacks because their parents smoke.<br /><br />oh yeah and those bath salts (mephadrone is it?)... already seen a couple of those people permanently schizoaffective because of that drug. seems like absolute trash to me if you&#039;re going to go absolutely nuts with a few months of heavy use.... better off with cocain. then again, I&#039;ve seen dudes in their 20&#039;s with heart attacks after a night of coke and booze.<br /><br />man, buzz-kill. haha

				I suppose I&#039;m lucky as crack does nothing for me and H just makes me sick (as most opiates do, though I can enjoy some prescriptions in very low doses).&nbsp; Granted, it&#039;s been years since I&#039;ve tried either but even if you like them the risk just isn&#039;t worth it.&nbsp; Sure, some people can do them fine, but even then you&#039;re playing with fire if life decides to throw you a devastating curve ball.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suppose I have issues with H because of Lane Staley.&nbsp; Well before he locked himself up in his U district condo it had taken his life from him.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s a brilliant multimillionaire at the height of his popularity and yet whose bedroom had no sheets on the bed, blood splatters all over the walls, and bloody toilet paper all over the place.&nbsp; A buddy of mine who lived with him told about how Lane was cool as hell when he woke up but once he started shooting up it was down hill from there.<br /><br />If cocaine is god&#039;s way of telling you you make too much money then crystal meth is god telling you its time to go shopping for double wides.&nbsp; What it does to your grey matter and how it ages people just makes me think there are a lot better ways of killing yourself.

				Snake bites don&#039;t sound too appealing to be either - perhaps in the category if licking toads but with the added risk of choosing the wrong snake.<br /><br />As far as identifying a drug you should, or should never, try, i&#039;d say opiates in general. Considering a moderate dose of something like 20 mg morphine, i find it hard to choose between never doing that and doing it because it will be the experience of a lifetime.<br /><br />I cannot compare the euphoria you will experience when taking drugs like morphine or heroin to anything else, but the chance of addiction is so great i could not recommend trying it either. I supose its something everyone should experience in their life, but probably best to reserve for the end stage of llife too.

				I&#039;m not sure if krokodil should even be called a drug, since its basically an uncleaned synthesis product that contains numerous substances. <br /><br />It is on the stupidity level of simply pushing some poppies in a blender, injecting whatever comes out and hope for the best. This is not a recommended way of administering morphine, though it might probably work for a couple of times before you get a deadly infection that costs you a limb in the best case scenario.

				Some drugs aren&#039;t just worth the damage it causes on the person&#039;s mental and physical health like meth and heroin.<br /><br />Also, any other drugs you have to inject IV.&nbsp; Frequent IV&#039;ing will damage your veins badly.<br /><br />I think majority of drugs are fine for exploration and social purposes.<br /><br />With all that said, what an irony it is that the legal drugs like nicotine, alcohol and prescription painkillers are killing more people than ever than any illegal drugs combined.

				IV is not nearly as scary as it seems. I have done it maybe four times (not recently) and I&#039;m not addicted or infected or anything, its just another way to go. But you should do it carefully. That being said, I found heroin to be disappointing. It made me really sick mostly. And I only tried strong pure heroin acquired through the silk road.<br /><br />Crack I have smoked on two occasions, that my friends and I made it ourselves for fun. Maybe my homemade crack was shitty, but I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t understand why people are addicted to crack. Or coke for that matter, never cared much for it. When I tried it first I was like WHAT THE FUCK WHY IS THIS SUCH A BIG DEAL IN THE WORLD? ITS JUST A TOPICAL ANESTHETIC! like licking a slug makes your tongue numb too. The first time I smoked crack I writhed in bed all night sweating and half thinking half dreaming about crack. So did both my friends I was with. It was weird.<br /><br />Meth on the other hand, is GREAT! Its my favorite. It makes sense to me. I recommend trying meth, just eating it and staying up all night talking with your friends, its really not a big deal.<br /><br /><br />The only drug that after trying I attempt to dissuade people from doing is SALVIA! Fucking stupid childish shit that salvia is. I was so curious in grade 10, and finally I got the salvia, and I smoked it, and it FUCKED ME UP in no fun way at all. Dont smoke salvia, unless you are a shaman, in which case its your job I guess.

				Salvia is something i&#039;m not that inclined to try either. Not because i believe its that dangerous, but all the videos of &#039;people on salvia&#039; give me the impression that it is not something you enjoy yourself, just something others enjoy when you take it and watch you act all stupid. <br /><br />Meth is something considered to be for bums in europe really - perhaps its just the availability of better drugs that keep people from using any. That said, its not a drug i wouldn&#039;t consider trying. It seems like meth addiction will cause severe health problems, but the same could be said about alcohol.<br /><br />Taking something IV is a bit of a limit for me though. I&#039;m sure it can be done safely with some substances (like morphine), but i have my doubts about using something ordered online or bought on the streets. It&#039;s hard to verify that a vial is actually sterile, and if is not, the results could be pretty disastrous. <br /><br />

				Meth, especially crystal meth, if your going to do meth get desoxyn or dextrostat (prescription). But really, they are better, safer amphetamines.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had 4-fa, but I&#039;d advise heavily against it, it&#039;s too simaler to 4-ca which is one of the most neurotoxic chemicals known to man. In fact 4-ca is soo neurotoxic that it&#039;s used in mice specifically for that purpose.

I hadn&#039;t even considered mentioning them. The only time i&#039;ve seen people sniffing glue was in cambodia, mainly kids with tubes of glue and plastic bags to inhale the fumes from. Somehow i think t his will have a very bad hanger/fun ratio though. I was sort of surprised by the claim that &#039;solvent abuse can cause immediate death&#039; on a european can of spray-on deodorant. The carrier gas in that is propane/butane (lighter fluid, sort of). <br /><br />As far as taking diphenhydramide to the point of delerium: I suppose it&#039;s possible if you take 50 tablets or something, but the thought of how drowsy i&#039;d be and for how long, would be reason enough not to attempt it ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i tried to do a DPH one time when i quit doing heroin and was going through the stupid whining wanting to get high junkie thing. i think i took like 600 mgs (i can take upto 300 mgs without like even getting tired from taking it like chronically since when i was little to help me sleep. then i didn&#039;t have as high of a tolerance). i started like tripping really hard and thinking shit was happening that wasn&#039;t and after like 20 minutes after that i fell asleep and slept for 2 days and didn&#039;t wake up for my phone alarm or any calls or anything. horrible horrible horrible fucking idea. i don&#039;t remember what happened after like 45 mins after i took the dph till when i went to sleep.<br />i felt like shit for like a week. i don&#039;t get how people could do it every day (i knew someone who did it religiously because he was on probation and wanted to get fucked up. i don&#039;t understand it but whatever).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I guess desperate people take desperate measures. In case of someone going through opiate withdrawal and no alternatives left due to mandatory drug testing i can imagine why they would take idiotically high doses just to get to sleep. <br /><br />Its not an experience i&#039;d recommend though - taking large doses of antihistamines can cause hallucinations for sure, but those are mostly unpleasant, and you will feel like shit the day(s) after. Sometimes i have to take quite a bit of them to halt allergic reactions, at which they are very effective. The downside is that i&#039;ll notice the adverse effects for a day or two after, drowsiness and such. And that is from doses like 100 mg benadryl, nothing in the order of 500 mg which would probably be far worse even several days after taking it.

				Heroin (the fastest way towards the route towards&nbsp; stealing your parents property)<br />RCs (Thalidomide waiting to happen or a mass poisoning off some bad batch)<br />Crack (coke is fine, but crack, although it is cocaine, is not cocaine an d crack heads look a mess and I like to look good and not have to prostitute myself to buy &#039;a bag&#039;<br />UK cut hash (soapbar, also ANY imported hash can be cut)<br />UK or Dutch sprayed bud. (this might be anything from sprays for mould, pests or the reckless spraying of other materials to make bud either put on bulk or to make it look &#039;sticky&#039; because the kilo has been stripped of hash trichomes. Another tr25x-nbome series health issues. (C&amp;P by BBB – source at end)<br /><br />Research chemicals are inherently a &quot;playing with fire&quot; business. Essentially, the longer a chemical is out, the more research is done with it, the more we have some idea of its safety profile in humans. The 25x-nbome series is one of the newest families of psychedelics to enter the marketplace, and there has already been a lot of human use. The initial reports were all extremely positive, with some of these (25c and 25i in particular) being hailed as equals to LSD, or better than LSD, or the new LSD.<br /><br />However as time has continued to pass and more and more individuals sample these chemicals in a wider variety of set, settings, and most importantly, combinations, there are emerging some red flags, and I would like this thread to be an open repository of information regarding those red flags.<br /><br />Although the mechanism of action of these chemicals is not completely known, we can assume from their molecular structure and subjective effects that they act primarily on the serotonin system.<br /><br />There are emerging two distinct areas of concern with these chemicals.<br /><br />1) Lingering effects caused by strain on the serotonin system<br /><br />2) Acute Vasoconstriction<br /><br />What do these mean?<br /><br />The first means that users are reporting that after using this substance, they have lingering effects that are extremely similar to what MDMA users would call &quot;suicide tuesdays&quot;. That is, depression, irritability, heightened levels of arousal and anxiety, and memory impairment. It is very important to note that this area of concern is HUGELY affected by the users drug habits. If you have been tripping twice a week for the past 6 months, and then have a strong NBOME trip and feel like you&#039;re a little &quot;stupid&quot; for a few days or weeks afterwards, understand that a big part of that is the previous use of drugs. Your brain is a complex and delicate self-balancing ecology of chemicals, receptors, and electrical activity. You can think of it as a big lake that you require both for water and for swimming pleasure. If you continue to have big parties in the lake every weekend, with people pissing in it, litter being thrown into it, and it generally being abused, and then suddenly a few months down the line you think to yourself &quot;gosh the water in here tastes like crap&quot;, well, that means that its time to stop having parties in it and let the natural state of nature come back (which it will, slowly, with sobriety).<br /><br />The second means that while under the effects of this chemical, blood vessels are tightened, which effects blood flow in the body, particularly to extremities like hands, fingers, feet, toes, etc. This presents as pins and needles (potentially painful), blue/purple discoloration, and swelling. This condition has the potential to kill you. It is completely counter-indicated for people who have a history of cardiovascular issues. This effect seems to be most pronounced when combining NBOMEs with other chemicals.<br /><br />Chemicals which are likely dangerous to combine with NBOME are:<br /><br />MDMA<br />LSD<br />COCAINE<br />METHAMPHETAMINE<br />DOX<br /><br />I have had several trips now on 25c+25i blotters, and on their own I do not notice any signs of vasoconstriction, although some people do. This is highly dose sensitive and has a lot to do with your individual body. I had one trip where I combined those same 25i+25c blotters with LSD, and I had the worst vasoconstriction I&#039;ve ever experienced in my life. It really scared my during the trip. I did not write about it for a long time because at the time I could not be sure what happened. The trip was immensly intense, and even inside the peak I thought &quot;holy shit, is this vasoconstriction? this is really bad&quot; but afterwards I questioned my judgement, and thought perhaps I was just feeling something else, was tripping hard, had anxiety, was being a hypochondriac, etc. Since then I have read that others have experienced the same thing particularly when combining NBOME with LSD. The effects I felt were STRONG pins and needles throughout my body, a strange sensation in my heart, a little light-headedness, and a little tightness in my chest. It made me instantly listen to my body, and what I heard was &quot;never ever do this combination again!&quot;<br /><br />My gf and I have both felt that since this trip our mental state is not 100% baseline. Important to note, this is after a summer of many trips, and this trip was one HELL of a trip. The exact same thing happened to me two summers ago. I took aMT every weekend for a few months, and then I dosed 50mg 4-aco-dmt and suffered several weeks of a battered serotonin system. So I am being careful here to point out that NBOME on its own is not likely to suddenly make you stupid, but rather it is demanding enough on your brain to exacerbate an already stressed chemical system if you trip often.<br /><br />Please post your own stories so that we can add to the communal knowledge base of this very new class of psychedelics. They are incredible enough that they deserve to be rigorously examined as potential therapeutic agents, and the first step in that is to establish a safety profile for them.<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Taken from http://www.hipforums.com/newforums/<br /><br />C&amp;P by Red for your harm reduction knowledgeick is to strip the plant of hash, reform into a block using leaf that growers throw out. Bud is also cut and sold 3 days after beign harvested. It is sold wet to increase the value. Other times the bud will be bone dry but dried too fast, harsh tasting and fit only for hash making, oil making for cooking.<br />Hydro Weed. It is NOT a health risk and nor is it that bad tasting IF grown to perfection, but most UK hydro is overfed to boost weight, often pushed to the limit which means the actual bud is packed with NPK and all the trace elements. We have measured the content of rival bud and found the EC level off the charts. (ground bud put into water will give a reading of excess nutrients in the salt form.)<br />Any drug which is less than 9/10 might as well be 1/10 in my eyes.&nbsp; Would you want 8/10 MDMA or 8/10 coke or heroin? (ok, heroin users might see the 8 was great because the street heroin is 5 at best!<br />I oppose men who take womens period pain pills. I took one by mistake and nothing happened. No period, no pain, and still had an hangover from cheap nasty red wine from a well known UK supermarket.<br />Bootleg alcohol also, this is an issue in the UK<br />And last but not least, fake tobbacco. UK is flooded with this shit. The people selling it should hung at dawn, or maybe 2.00pm to give the potheads time to wake up.<br />&nbsp;;)<br />

				To tell the truth, I have done most of the drugs, at least popular ones and really enjoyed only a few. The only thing I regret is that I started smoking (cigarettes). Such a useless, addictive, unhealthy and available drug.<br /><br />My experience with &#039;scary&#039; drugs:<br /><br />heroin - did it once. tried vaping it and that hardly worked. Sniffed ~30mg. started nodding, got nauseous and itchy. Euphoria was minimal, but it fixed my toothache:) I still have some left, but don&#039;t plan on trying it again anytime soon, even if it would feel nicer second time around. Getting stoned on some indica hash is much much more pleasant:) heroin not worth it for me.<br /><br />cocaine - did it few times, about 5 grams total. The one batch I enjoyed was from LiberPater I got here on SR. Other batched were &#039;MEH&#039;. Very expensive, short lived high that doesn&#039;t even feel that great for me. I still might do it from time to time if I get good stuff for cheap, but still, mehhh..<br /><br />meth - did 0.2g. sample in various ROA&#039;s and couldn&#039;t get high. Always felt like small dose of amphetamine. This one I want to try again before crossing it out.<br /><br />mdpv - shitty high and once when I did a lot I felt really sick for couple of days. Worthless.<br /><br />Hell, I don&#039;t even look forward for my next LSD trip...<br /><br />Weed/hash, amphetamine, 4-aco-dmt, mdma three times a year - these are the drugs I enjoy and I really could do without anything else..

				Ill do anything. Especially opiate.<br /><br />ADVICE: Never, ever, EVER, smoke Fentanyl powder. Especially if you like opiates. Its way too good. Its the best thing in the world. And you will never want to stop. It will grab you the first time. Id put money on it. It will become the love of your life, and you will be its slave. And if you ever manage to kick, you will experience the worst withdrawls of your life. Withdrawls worse than benzos, methadone, alcohol, heroin...the sickness lasts for weeks, months.. (i was sick 17 days straight, until i freaked out and drove 368 miles to a solid subutex connection) and at first, NOTHING will help. Your tolerance will be through the roof. You will eat a handful of subs your first day sick, and nothing will happen. Fent will ruin your body, your health, and any sort of human relationship you may have with anyone around you.&nbsp; and if your not found blue, sitting on the toilet, dead, youll end up wishing you were. And then youll have to just keep smoking more F to make you forget about how much your life sucks.<br /><br />Today i am 20 days (17 w/o subs, 3 with) clean from fentanyl. I had a 1400$ a day habit for 3 years.

				Paramethoxyamphetamine or PMA, also known on the streets as Dr. Death, it&#039;s cut into E&#039;s, not very often but it does happen, with fatal results &#039;&#039;Pink ecstasy&#039; drugs warning issued in north Wales&#039; (clearwebalert)&nbsp; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18310110 Fuck the dealer that cut E&#039;s with PMA, and fuck PMA, always use a proper test kit, and check up a proper pill report site, like (clearwebalert) www.pillreports.com. Everybody stay safe&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I would never IV anything, no offense to anybody that does, it&#039;s just something I&#039;m never going to do, and Heroin, Crystal Meth, and that Krokodil shit, no offense to anybody that does these drugs, again, it&#039;s about me drawing a line, I enjoy drugs in moderation, and I never want to become addicted to them. From what I&#039;ve read and seen, Heroin and Crystal Meth are far too addictive, and that Krokodil shit is just one of the most fucked up drugs I have ever seen.

				I don&#039;t think you should bunk a drug just because of how its synthesized. <br /><br />The chemistry involved in synthesizing about any over the counter drug would leave very nasty side reaction products in the product if it were not purified afterwards.<br /><br />A drug like aspirin was traditionally synthesized by reacting wintergreen oil wilt anhydrous acetic acid and sulfuric acid as a catalyst. If you were to inject the raw reaction product of that, it would most likely be fatal on the first attempt, but purification allows the synthesis of a perfectly safe medication in tablet form. <br /><br />One prime example is a drug named &#039;krokodil&#039;. The active compound in that is desmorphine, which in itself isn&#039;t that much pdifferent from morphine it both adverse and desired effects. The extremely bad health effects are caused not by desmorpine, but by administering the unpurified product directly. Reactants like iodine and phosphorous remain&nbsp; in the product, causing conditions like gangrene to develop in users. These effects are in no way to be blamed on the desmorphie - if itaken as a pure substance it will not cause anything like that.<br /><br />Meth synthesis is prone to similar problems - if meth use causes acute health problems it is far more likely that contaminants are to blame then the met itself. Obviously meth has its dangers when taken as a pure compound, but those should not be confused with adverse effects caused by contaminants in &#039;street&#039; meth.

				There is always a risk of some contaminant left behind in the drug if you are taking it off the streets. <br /><br />Meth is a drug rarely seen in europe, but given its synthesis routes i&#039;d suspect any batch to be contaminated. This is not because the substance is that hard to make in proper lab, but mostly because people attempt to make it in illicit labs. They may skip purification stepts to save on cost and increase &quot;yield&quot; <br /><br />The chemistry behind isn&#039;t all hat complicated, its just purification steps being omitted became the suppliers don&#039;t give a rats ass about the consequences for the end users.

				Interesting that you mention tramadol in this thread. For most people it doesn&#039;t pose any problems, and acts as a painkiller that will relax you quite a bit too without resorting to straight opiates like morphine just yet. <br /><br />As you point out everyone is different and for some people tramadol may have unpleasant effects, but i wouldn&#039;t say this is so common it should be a warning for the population at large to avoid it. <br /><br />Personally i don&#039;t use it recreationally, but if something hurts to the point where nsaids aren&#039;t going to really cut it, i&#039;d be happy to take a tramjet or two. Perhaps a problem is that people have too high expectations, counting on a morphine like effect and keep taking more of the stuff until that is achieved. I suppose it will never be however, and at such amounts side effects will become rather unpleasant.

				I have tried crack meth and heroin. I absolutely did not like crack. It was an overwhelming flight or fight rush and it lingered with me through out the day. I do not see it as recreational or even enjoyable, so certainly did not become addicted after one use. Heroin was fun and I think I handled myself quite well on it, I didn&#039;t get addicted etc but I have seen heroin fuck peoples lives up and it is bad news. Meth is highly addictive and I would suggest against it, I still get cravings for it to this day many years after trying it last and after never having been a heavy user.

				I would not do LSD again, I did it once almost two decades ago and tripped for an afternoon, then went psychotic and ended up sectioned (committed) for two weeks it was at times quite terrifying &amp; confusing, memories of being sat on by 3 male orderlies in a padded room while they injected whatever in my butt cheeks will never leave me.<br /><br />The worst was having to show you have recovered your sanity in order to get out. It is surprisingly hard to get a grip on reality when locked in a psych ward surrounded by full time psychotics. My assigned doctor pushed me to go on lithium,&nbsp; for the rest of my life. fuck that, he was wrong. Luckily the whole thing did not screw up my career but it absolutely wasn&#039;t worth 8 hours of hallucinations and the realization my apartment badly needed dusting.<br /><br />I would advise any first time LSD users to check their family history for psychosis/depression/whatever and if there is stuff there, avoid hallucinogenics, it isn&#039;t worth it.<br /><br />Oh, and I&#039;d not start nicotine again. Even smoking for two years and quitting you spend the rest of your life tempted by nicotine you never truly become a non-smoker again - just an ex-smoker.

				Crack, meth, and heroin. All have strong addictive qualities, all are very dangerous if abused. I&#039;ve never tried either of those, and not plan. I have heard heroin is the best high you&#039;d ever have, and if it wasn&#039;t so damn addictive, I might try.

				Oh and another thing. I will never inject anything, needles freak me out. I could never inject myself. I fucking hate the rare doctor visit were I get a shot or blood drawn, I certainly would not want to do it to myself no matter how good the potential experience is.

				I absolutely refuse to take a drug that&#039;s really addictive (like benzos/coke/opiates). I don&#039;t want to become a junkie or something, my wallet cant take it, let alone my job. Especially cocaine, I&#039;ve heard it just makes you want to do more cocaine, which isn&#039;t my type of deal. Plus the only people I knew who were really into coke were a couple of idiots and lost me ~$200 once, so I refuse to be anywhere around coke now. It&#039;s just booze and other, lesser drugs for me!

				Is there a drug I would never try?<br /><br />Nope. I&#039;ll try anything once.<br /><br />IMO hard drugs are plenty safe to do, but you have respect the drug and the power its going to have over you as soon as you get your hands on it. Don&#039;t buy large amounts, and force yourself to not buy any more. Once you &#039;go down the rabbit hole&#039; with an addiction to a particular drug, you can&#039;t touch that drug again, ever, or it will become a problem again. Before an addiction? Manage yourself and your cravings, don&#039;t let yourself slip, and occasional usage won&#039;t be an issue. <br /><br />Experienced hard drug users know what I&#039;m talking about.

I felt spacey as hell, but I got it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Snorting ritalin, will help you get work done, and keep you awake, but even though I have access to it, I decline to use it.&nbsp; The comedown, is bitch.&nbsp; I have calculated that 5-6 hours after taking methylphenidate, you SHOULD be able to sleep it off.&nbsp; OTH, I&#039;ve been up 7 hours after doing a huge(300-400mg) binge, and it was crazy, I fell asleep with my eyes open.&nbsp; The only time I didn&#039;t have a comedown was when I went on a super-binge,&nbsp; I did 30-40 20mg tablets over the course of 3 days, I got wavy vision and passed out.&nbsp; &nbsp;I only used it once after that, but I really enjoyed it when I first started using it.&nbsp; Narcolepsy and ADD are legitimate uses for this compound, as well as the hangover function I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason the time from T+0.0-Peak gets shorter every time when you snort it, little by little.&nbsp; &nbsp;So after a while, you get maybe 30-45min of come-up with a down of 4 hours, which kinda sucks.&nbsp; I&#039;ve smoked and injected it as well, both of those routes are not very fun(don&#039;t do it!).&nbsp; Hope this helps people who are interested in what I formerly referred&nbsp; to as &quot;Vitamin R.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

Actually it was my 2nd time using it that it made me initially swear it off...&nbsp; the quality was fine, friend wanted me to get the vendor&#039;s phone # so he could be his gay lover (he snorts some junkie quality street shit all day err day) this was like filet mignon to him in comparison he said.<br /><br />Anyway, I basically did lines when I got home from work, hadn&#039;t eaten since noon, so once the high tapered off I got this AWFUL nausea and felt like absolute shit on the comedown, something that definitely didn&#039;t happen the first first time I tried it.&nbsp; In conclusion, I&#039;m always going to eat before coking out, and following up with a regimen of vitamins and maybe a benzo for the really tough comedowns in the future.&nbsp; I seriously felt like death all night though...and my friend confirmed that some people need food in their stomach or coke destroys them (confirm?)<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna give it another shot, in hindsight the actual high was very pleasant and I caught up with so many old friends while I was snorting the last of what I ordered, it felt good to be social and open with people, just the fact I couldn&#039;t hold out more than 2 days before dipping into it again worried me.&nbsp; I know my ability to curb the craving for getting high is stronger than that, seeing as I haven&#039;t touched any of the other swell products sitting around, I think it was more of a conscious experimentation binge (I tend to binge on a new drug initially and then it gets old within a couple weeks) rather than an early addiction.<br /><br />Really I think coke is one of the &quot;softer&quot; drugs out there still, it has less instantly troublesome effects than something like MDPV, or PCP.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">IMO hard drugs are plenty safe to do, but you have respect the drug and the power its going to have over you as soon as you get your hands on it. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Honestly this in a nutshell.&nbsp; I noticed a pattern of gradual opening up to experimentation in my years.&nbsp; It started out as:<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m never going to do drugs.&quot;<br /><br />into<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ll just smoke weed&quot;<br /><br />into<br /><br />&quot;Shrooms and acid are cool every now and then&quot;<br /><br />into<br /><br />&quot;MDMA, psychs, and some psychedelic RCs&quot;<br /><br />into<br /><br />&quot;Fuck it, I&#039;ll try coke, but thats as far...&quot;<br /><br />into<br /><br />&quot;I might try snorting meth once&quot; (not quite really at this point though, I am still sketch about it)<br /><br />---<br /><br />But most &quot;hard&quot; drugs are what you make of them.&nbsp; You have the power to regulate your habits, and I think the SR is particularly positive in terms of harm reduction.&nbsp; We have a very open and supportive/knowledgeable community of semi-responsible (lol) users who can offer expertise on any drug in the world at the same touch of a button where you can buy said products.&nbsp; It&#039;s also harder to give into cravings and addiction since you have to go through the whole BTC process over the accessibility of a local dealer who can toss a bag at you every day.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of like a 3 step self-check every time you think &quot;I&#039;m gonna buy something from SR&quot;...at least to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, with coke I feel if I was going through a friend or local dealer to get my supply it could potentially be a problem, but accessibility through SR makes me think twice about how much I&#039;m getting and how frequently, since I usually only drop a bunch of BTC into my account once a month or bi-monthly at most, so if I blow through my drugs too fast then I have to force myself to wait it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, habit-forming is just that, if you form a bad habit, it will stay with you, but if you catch it early and turn it into a moderated habit, then you tend to stay to that schedule -- so in a way even if you do decide to test the waters with potentially dangerous/addictive types of drugs you have a system in place that&#039;ll catch bad habits and correct them before they become life-altering.&nbsp; My cokehead friend has offered to hook me up with his cheap supplier but honestly, after sampling my first from the road I can&#039;t settle for less lol.&nbsp; That&#039;s a good self-check IMO, though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve given his a try just to see and it really sucks in comparison, he&#039;s like &quot;Yeah honestly if you can get shit like that don&#039;t bother going cheap, it&#039;s just not worth it&quot; (still boggles me why he keeps doing coke...if it&#039;s even coke at all, probably like 90% levamisole) -- then again I stopped asking why people smoke cigarettes like a chimney anyway.<br /><br />For the most part though any drug has tons of safety information on the internet you can do the research yourself and decide what you&#039;re willing to give a try or not, there are just some drugs that you have to be extra careful with because the safety bounds are not well written or studied, especially with the RC market, I know things like PCP or MDPV can have serious consequences if you don&#039;t be extremely careful with them, though, and drugs that have a higher-than-average risk factor, respected or not, are beyond my comfort zone, personally.&nbsp; Opiates are one thing I refuse to even go near simply because of the heavy addiction potential in it though, that&#039;s not anti-drug propaganda either, even the opiate users agree it was a big mistake getting sucked into things like heroin in the first place.&nbsp; Some drugs there IS no responsible use for a majority of people.<br /><br />But as far as all the rest, as long as you are prepared to deal with the potential crashes, negative aspects, physicalities, withdrawal symptoms, -- it&#039;s well worth it, because 20 years down the road you&#039;ll be able to provide your kids with real experience and knowledge of what drugs you&#039;ve done, and often times it&#039;ll be something you can bond with your kid over when you&#039;re like 60 and they all grown up.&nbsp; Even to this day, I wish my parents were less constrictive and hard-headed about drug use, especially since they did coke, and psychedelics in their youth, then somehow decided to follow the propaganda and myths.&nbsp; But making drugs seem more &quot;legendary&quot; drives us to experiment with them and see what there is to offer, especially once you realize they&#039;re no worse than a cup of coffee or hard alcohol for your health.<br /><br />All things in moderation, whatever you do, do your homework on anything you decide to try.&nbsp; Especially if it&#039;s more obscure, or an RC. <br /><br />

				Did some quick reading. <br />I would advice people not to take drugs that they know not every bit about.<br /><br />And stay away from antidepressants and antipsychotics. Unless your mental condition is really serious.<br />I&#039;m seriously afraid I will never be able to get off of them anymore and I can&#039;t enjoy drugs anymore like I used to: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=64155.0<br />And nobody wants to help me out get some cash to become a vendor and make a small profit to take an alternative route to quitting my meds.<br />But there is always a way.. I hope...<br /><br />I&#039;ve been addicted to benzo&#039;s. I wouldn&#039;t advice not doing them. Just be careful with them and not take them every day. Just when really needed, or take more than a therapeutic dose for recreation.<br /><br />I used to advice against heroin,(base)coke and amfetamines. Now I am searching for good dex, basecoke and I want to try H again. Last and first time it made me itchy and had to take a dump. Nothing more. Some called it luck.. I dunno. Cocaine made me nauseous. I like the taste of basecoke and the sound how it burns. Never had that &quot;flash&quot; though. Which might also be good. Both H and C are way too expensive. And I don&#039;t think taking meth is a very good idea either.<br /><br />There are more drugs I would advice people of trying at least once or twice though :)

				I would never do heroin, crack or meth. I&#039;m sure there is plenty of others but I would say these are the big three I would avoid. As for drugs I would advise others against I would probably say coke, it seemed very underwhelming and expensive, part of that is high expectations (scarface and any other movie) and probably low quality. Also having tried preban mephedrone which seemed to blow it out of the water in price, quality and addictiveness. I would also advise against mephedrone because of its addictive nature, i&#039;m sure there are plenty of people who can handle it but i&#039;ve never fiended for a drug before trying it and I feel I don&#039;t even have an addictive personality.

				&#039;lo all. <br /><br />I&#039;d advise people that like their dissociatives to avoid 4-meo-pcp like the plague. <br /><br />Bought a gram several months ago &amp; took it up to c. 100mg. <br /><br />Low doses it has a kind of heady, almost sickly sweet high to it in place of ketamine euphoria and that lovely glow that can be achieved with mxe. Higher doses there was all kinds of nasty cev imagery &amp; it felt like blocks of my visual field had stopped working while whatever part of my brain that was still doing it&#039;s job was going &quot;cough...POISON!...cough&quot; quietly in the background somewhere.<br /><br />-edit: ended up binning slightly less than half the gram.&nbsp;

				Research chemicals in general. You cannot predict how will they affect you. There is (usually) no toxicity data available. You might be putting rat poison in your body. If I had to choose between methamphetamine and a research phenetylamine that would deliver the same effects, I would go for the meth. At least you know what to expect and what precautions to take. Now many of you mentioned hard drugs in general. I wouldn&#039;t say that. Hard drugs can (and will) show you the highest highs and the lowest lows. The lows are inevitable, sooner or later. <br /><br />Another class of drugs I would advise everyone not to use are&nbsp; various pharmaceuticals. Ironic how can something that is made to help do so much damage. Benzo withdrawal can be worse than heroin withdrawal and can take months. The same goes for SSRIs. Not to mention all the side effects. <br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot. PCP, desomorphine (Krokodil) and scopolamine. No explanation necessary.<br /><br />Whatever you choose to do, just try to take all the precautions you can, do a lot of research beforehand and so on.<br /><br />Oh and a golden rule: Moderation. Is. The. Key.&nbsp; 8)

I looked at it and i basically thought the shit was gonna be amazing. It was shardy and at that time i expected it to be some good stuff. Boy was i wrong. Ended up eating 2 caps that could fit .3 powdered mdma. But they were full of all meth, maybe a tiny bit of mdma. Enjoyed it until i started to come down. I had the worst thoughts&nbsp; in my head. I was up for about 50 +/- hours. For the remainder of a week i was extremely depressed. I wanted to kill myself, and all i did for was a week was bars. The bars helped me forget. But i dont regularly do bars. On the bright side the first time i actually did mdma it was some of SKYY&#039;s mdma and i rolled absolute face. It was at kaskade and was amazing.<br /><br />2. Heroin. I have a good friend that does not seem like a addict. But in reality, he is. It is the most sad thing, because when he first started to do it he told me, I was extremely upset. He told me he wasnt gonna make a habbit. Guess what? he did. He is not addicted to it and gets withdrawls. The hardest part is that he lives in a different state then me and i cant be there to help him. I would do so much to help him, but im utterly useless. Long story short if you mess with the bull, you will get the HORNS.<br /><br />3. barbiturates. Although above i stated that i used xanax. But this was an extreme condition and i will never take it again. It has caused heartache in every user ever. i know for a fact that everyone that has taken xanax or other barb&#039;s. Just dangerous<br /><br />Z420K

The heartache i speak of is all the problems people face with bars. I know people who were prescribed bars. They liked it. But when they tried to get off of it they had extreme withdrawls. It is one of the most abused drugs in the united states. I have watched a friend have a seizure because his body was freaking out that he didnt have his xanax. Maybe you have a good experience but ill tell you. if your prescribed you are gonna have a hell of a time getting off of it. Ive read that getting off a xanax addiction is harder then a heroin addiction.

				I would advise most people not to take any highly addictive drugs, just because too many people have little to no self-control.<br /><br />As for me, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever try crack. I&#039;ve only done four other stims (cocaine, meth, MDPV, and mephedrone), but just those are enough for me not to want<br />to try any others. I don&#039;t like &#039;em. I also think I&#039;m through with taking any opioid that isn&#039;t heroin. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve always said that there are certain drugs that I would never try, but I&#039;ve messed that up. Now I just don&#039;t take drugs that have a high potential for addiction. It&#039;s easier for me to steer clear of certain drugs now that I have a clear reason why I don&#039;t want to take them.<br /><br />As of the moment I won&#039;t take meth, heroin, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, or benzos. This is purely because I&#039;ve had addiction problems in the past with cocaine and I know for a fact that I couldn&#039;t handle the addictive potential of those other drugs that I listed.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t take research chemicals or dissociatives because the effects worry me.

				herion, crack, crystal meth, benzos and bath salts<br />all rather addictive and not good for the body although i have had a benzo or 2 and suffered no ill effects but it was as a medicine not recrational<br /><br />however i would not judge for doing those drugs but the best advice is definitely to research the drug make sure its from a trusted source and it is what they said it is - also look into how your body would react ie if you have any medical issues or anxiety issues some drugs may not be good for people with issues such as that :)&nbsp;

				If I don&#039;t know what it is, or a relative direction from whence it came...I do not partake. <br />I recently backed out of a mda order due to facts about ssri contradictions. <br /><br />As far as &quot;hard&quot; drugs go, haven&#039;t seen many, probably never will.

				Personally, I would never use inhalants to get high (huffing paint thinner, dust remover, etc.).<br /><br />My advice to others would be to stay as far away from opiates as possible (unless absolutely needed for medical reasons, obviously). I started off partying with pain pills at a young age, and to make a long story short graduated to heroin. From there it was only a matter of time before I was injecting. It wasted years of my life, bankrupted me in every way possible, cost me countless jobs and good relationships (including my fiance), and basically ruined every facet of my life. Some people can party socially with it no problem, but not me. My body likes it a little too much.

				Methamphetimeine, cocaine/crack, heroin, BZP, marijuana, valium, oxycontin, valium, xanex, and pretty much everything that&#039;s smoked, snorted, or injected. <br /><br />I will never inject, smoke, or snort anything because I believe that doing that should be illegal. I mean eating is a natural human action, we were supposed to do it, and I don&#039;t see anything wrong with taking a pill or putting a peice of paper in my mouth for the most part. Smoking, snorting, and injecting things just doesn&#039;t feel right. Your inhaling foreign material when you&#039;re only supposed to inhale oxygen. Same goes for snorting and injecting, it just doesn&#039;t feel right. Don&#039;t call me a preacher but typically, injecting, smoking, and snorting drugs is more addictive than taking them another way. Lastly, the pills I listed are very addictive, and I would like to keep my use recreational and to have a good time every once in a while.

				Whilst being quite fit, worked out 5 days a week, etc, and only occasionally smoking weed, i tried ice for the first time a few years ago and i hated it. <br />My bones felt like chalk and i couldnt hit the gym for nearly 2 weeks.

				Ive been a steady drug user for 15 years. Here&#039;s my list of donts:<br />DXM: While the high is fun, and it goes well with weed, this drug caused some problems for me in the future after using it every weekend for about a year. <br />Crack/Cocaine: I still enjoy snorting coke but I wouldnt suggest smoking it, felt like a huge waste to me, the high was not fun. <br />Heroin: Dont want to step on toes here but thought this one wasnt worth it either but I have never injected it only snorted it, have seen what it does to friends though and I dont recommend it. <br />And last but not least: Research chemicals: I would stay far away from these, and I do, I dont want to be a guinea pig. I made the mistake once of trying a research chemical when I was a teen, a friend said it was a derivative of dxm, not sure that it was but I took some and had the worst night of my life. Heavy hallucinations, not able to move through most of it, no balance when I was finally able to move, effects lasted for about two days. <br />I love this community and I hope that everyone is taking all precautions with drug use and being as safe as possible, thanks for letting me share!

Meth is something which cannot be used responsibly.<br /><br />You can say that something can be used responsibly only in retrospect (ie after you have a few years experience with the drug). Then, if you&#039;ve used it responsibly for years, you can claim that it can be done. But you cannot do a drug once and say &quot;oh haha, such an idiot I was thinking that this is anything but easy&quot;.<br /><br />Trust me, drugs like heroin and meth will &quot;grow on you&quot; so to speak. And meth is arguably more addictive than heroin. <br /><br />There are three possible options with first time use of meth:<br />a) you can use once, not like it, and never do it again in your life - consider yourself lucky<br />b) you can use once, not like it that much, and keep doing it occasionally (because &quot;my fears were unfounded&quot;) while addiction creeps up on you<br />c) you can use once, like it, and you&#039;re basically fucked.<br /><br />Meth addiction is like nothing else. It&#039;s not worth it. PM me if you would like more info. <br /><br />imo, no one should try drugs like meth and heroin for the first time. &quot;Not even once&quot; should be the mantra. It&#039;s playing with fire and you will get burned. Note that this is a &#039;do as I say not as I do&#039; kind of deal... I&#039;m not trying to be holier than thou. But I&#039;ve seen it happen time and time again. No one has &#039;addict&#039; stamped on their foot when they are born, and not one junkie aspired to become one. Keep that in mind.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m no advocate for the use of meth, but you are wrong.&nbsp; Meth has a high potential for addiction but it&#039;s not as much of a slippery slope as you&#039;re saying.&nbsp; It is possible to use once, like it, and not be addicted.&nbsp; I ingested a carefully weighed dose, so my experience may not have been as intense as most other recreational users, but I was able to enjoy the experience without craving it again.&nbsp; Perhaps because I went into the experience with the intention of only trying it once and then moving onto other things (I have a lot to cover on my drug bucket list.)<br /><br />Although, I will agree that the best policy with meth is to never try it.&nbsp; I just couldn&#039;t help my curiosity.

				Quite honestly I&#039;d like to try most things apart from RC&#039;s, meth, crack and heroin. <br /><br />Reading in the newspaper tonight there are 50 000 heroin users in Scotland who use H at least 261 days of the year - scary! Wonder what it&#039;s like in other parts of the world?
