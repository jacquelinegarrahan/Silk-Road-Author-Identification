				A few days ago I received in the mail these white dextroamphetamine pills, sold to me as dexedrine. in the past ive only done dexedrine<br /><br />However, they appear to be street amphetamine pills.<br /><br />They are supposedly 10mg<br /><br />They are labelled &#039;dx&#039; on one side, and &#039;1|0&#039; on the other side<br /><br />has anyone here tried such pills with such labelling?<br /><br />are they pharmaceutical pills or street amphetamine?

It would help addiction issues a lot if when people crushed and sniffed their oxy, literally nothing would happen, like with Vyvanse.

				never seen these before. i used to extract dextroamphetamine sulphate from blue pills. dextroamphetamine sulfate (the form you see in tablets) is usually either a blue circular pill, or an orange diamond pill. it is unlikely that the vendor sold you junk pills, since dextroamphetamine is one of the easiest amphetamines to convert from the most commonly used precursors. in fact, most street speed is indeed dextroamphetamine. when you take dexedrine, you are taking pure dextroamphetamine sulphate (salt). drugs like adderall consist of levoamphetamine as well, which is believed to balance the euphoric effects of dexedrine and cause more peripheral nervous changes. because of this, dextroamphetamine or methamphetamine alone are much more euphoric than adderall or prodrugs like vyvanse. they also produce worse comedowns and hangovers. anyway, i would not worry about these pills. they are likely generic, obscure pills from another country. scoring the pills with letters and numbers isn&#039;t usually done on cheap dirt. the letters are usually a sign that it is not cut with toxic chemicals. either way, the effects of dextroamphetamine are indistinguishable from a-amphetamine (what you might call street speed) because dextroamphetamine is almost fully metabolized into a-amphetamine inside the body.

				quality is really just a term used to describe how pure the drug is. the molecule itself, as long as it is indeed dextroamphetamine, is not likely to be different whether it&#039;s made on the street or made in a pharmaceutical lab. based on the side effects you described, i would say someone made this by extracting the binders from pharmaceutical speed (a combination of d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine) because the side effects of irritability and headaches are mainly caused by l-amphetamine, while the effects of euphoria and energy are mainly caused by d-amphetamine. d-amph is just an abbreviation of dextroamphetamine. if you study the molecules, you see that dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are the same chemical by all standards except they are mirror images of each other. that is called chirality. i suspect that you either consumed a mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, OR someone tried to make amphetamine salts out of pseudoephedrine in a similar process to manufacturing meth. the reason i consider this possible is because the pill was not dyed, suggesting it may have been produced illicitly. anyway, if it gave you a headache, i would not take it again. not only is it unpleasant but it can also be a sign that the drug is harming your cardiovascular system. in this sense, it may not have been the levoamphetamine in the mixture but rather some byproducts of illicit production OR adulterants used to cut the mixture. some of the chemicals used to synthesize amphetamine from pseudoephedrine can be extremely dangerous, for example red phosphorus. for this reason, i wouldn&#039;t take my chances with these sketchy ass pills.
