				I&#039;m planning to hoard some LSD for a while. I would like them to last a very long time.<br /><br />This is currently what I&#039;m doing: a layer of cellophane (or corner of a ziplock cut off and lighter sealed), following by a layer of glad press and seal to protect from oxygen and moisture, followed by two layers of aluminum foil to protect from light, then placed in an altoid or prescription pill bottle (I prefer the pill bottle because it seems airtight, but with the batch I just got there doesn&#039;t seem to be enough room hence the altoid tin).<br /><br />Stored a couple hits in the freezer for a week to see if it would destroy them, and they didn&#039;t seem to lose potency.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I was concerned about the altoid tin so I&#039;m continuing to keep my shit in the fridge.<br /><br />Was wondering if anybody could offer any criticism or input about my method.

				I keep mine in an altoid tin :)<br /><br />This is my set up: tinfoil around the blotters, which are inserted into a tiny plastic bag (squeeze all possible air out), which is placed in an altoid tin can with a silica gel pack. This tin can is placed in a dark drawer closest to the floor. Though, I&#039;ll be hoarding as well soon, so I know I&#039;ll have to find a different way to store them because my tin isn&#039;t that large either. <br /><br />As for the freezer method, I&#039;ve read that works great on a lot of forums, though I have also read that it is overly-cautious and unnecessary. If you do plan to keep it in the freezer, I would still recommend to wrap in tinfoil, plastic, etc. Do whatever you have to do to keep light/air/moisture out! :)<br /><br />Oh, and FRIDGE? Please tell me you meant freezer at least! There is soo much moisture in a refrigerator. You are facing the risk of condensation degrading your tabs. (EDIT: This is what I have heard on many forums, at least, and it seems plausible to me. Though, Erowid Answers doesn&#039;t mention anything about refrigerator condensation, so who knows!)<br /><br />P.S. I&#039;m an LSD newbie, but I&#039;ve researched a lot a lot before trying the drug, so hopefully my advice will be of some help (though it&#039;s probably just the same information you&#039;ve already read countless times, regurgitated) ;)<br />&nbsp;<br />EDIT: http://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.php?ID=82

				As for the fridge that&#039;s not a good idea. <br /><br />Freezer - You could storage them in there, but allow to bottle it&#039;s stored in to return to room temperature before opening the bottle. If this route was taken I&#039;d recommend the hits in a small jewelry like baggie all air pressed out, that wrapped in foil, then placed in a small glass amber vial.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alternatively I&#039;d recommend the hits placed in a small baggie with air pressed out as previously mentioned, and that just placed in an amber glass vial. ( You could store this anywhere you&#039;d like in varying temperatures, and leave it near a light source it won&#039;t have much, rarely if any effect on the potency of the blotter.

				Long term storage if kept in an amber glass vial like someone else posted with hits placed in a small baggie first with air pressed out it will last longer than you will. :)

				Awesome. Ill go to store tomorrow and score a glass amber vial and some little baggies.<br /><br />I&#039;m still gonna use the press and seal too for added protection.<br /><br />As for the freezer vs. fridge thing, I&#039;ve seen people argue that condensation is a bigger risk in the freezer as well. In fact I&#039;ve seen every possible freezer fridge argument out there (for, against).<br /><br />Conflicting opinions in abundance... idk who to believe :(<br /><br />&nbsp;I am prolly gonna move em to the freezer after I hit submit tho.but I do appreciate the input.

				why all the hightech?<br /><br />I am doing the same for years now. (though the blotters normaly do not hold that long hehe)<br /><br />Just a ziplockbaggie, press the air out and lay it between a thick book in a bookshelf.<br /><br />This way I have:<br />no moisture <br />no air<br />no light<br />constant roomtemp.<br />and last but not least always enough trips at home hehe.<br /><br />take care.
