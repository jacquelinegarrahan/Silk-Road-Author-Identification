				so I hang out on a tobacco forum where people talk about all forms of tobacco use, and nasal snuff is quite popular, it&#039;s supposed to be the best method to absorb lots of nicotine.<br /><br />so I thought, I wonder if anyone has tried making snuff out of weed?

				Well, there are inhalers of synthetic THC for medicinal use - I think that&#039;s the closest you&#039;ll get at the moment.<br /><br />I think the problem is the cannabinoids in marijuana aren&#039;t particularly water soluble - that&#039;s why eating weed doesn&#039;t have any effect, you have to extract the cannabinoids first into a fat - so the mucus membrane in your lungs wouldn&#039;t really get the good stuff out, aside from the practical problem of how to snort it. Just a hunch, though.

				I once saw a Guy &quot;dip&quot; a bud- he put it in between his cheek and gums, really heady humboldt nug, almost a gram, and while he said he didn&#039;t immediately feel anything, the next day he looked distressed, so I asked him, and he said that he woke up in the middle of the night, the most stoned he had ever been.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ate brownies the same night, and saw the guy EAT a nug beforehand, so I know he did a lot of other weed that night, but dipping weed could possibly get enough into your system for it to work.&nbsp; The solubility goes up for non-polar compounds when you&#039;re talking about bodily fluids, mostly because of the proteins in the blood, spit, snot, etc. help the compounds to cross the barriers and transport them effectively.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope that helps, weed sniffer!

				So you are telling me out of all the drug users here not one of you has watched one of your buddies snort a line of kief?<br /><br />Of course it doesn&#039;t work, and if you have ever snorted plant material before (YOPO :( ) you will know it is not for the faint of heart.<br />Stick to smoking or eating your bud.

I do not guarantee the accuracy of it.<br /><br />Any comments about curing are 100% conjecture. There is far too little knowledge about what curing really does, aside from turning junk to dank.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />THCa, which is what the cannabis plant manufacturers via enzyme-reactions(among other cannabinoids) is not psychoactive in the human body. THCa slowly converts to THC when cannabis is curing in a jar. Or laying out in the open. Or existing. THCa very rapidly converts to THC when heated, however. Like when making cannabutter.<br /><br />THCa is also, I&#039;ve read, water soluble. As is CBDa. The little &quot;a&quot; at the end is for the carboxle group, or however that is spelled. Decarbing is the process of rapidly converting THCa to THC and can be done via making cannabutter, or even just heating the cannabis in an oven at a very low heat. Or curing it in a jar{BLARGH NOTE: I&#039;m not actually certain about this}. Curing has the benefit of preserving the terpenes which are lost from heat. Too much heat will start to boil off the lower cannabinoids.<br /><br />As far as what I&#039;ve read goes, and as far as my understanding extends, you want to keep the heat at 200f or less. The &quot;problem&quot; with oven-decarbing is that the terpenes will boil off from the plant material and the chlorophyll will break down(turn brown). Good for stealth and stealth-edibles(as in, make cannabutter after oven-decarbing), bad for bag appeal and artisan-smells. Also, this doesn&#039;t mean that brown weed is good weed.<br /><br />Oven decarbing will also dry the bud more, making it more potent BY WEIGHT. This doesn&#039;t mean it magically becomes stronger, though. Just that as more weight is shed, the ratio of cannabinoids-to-plant material goes up, in that there is less plant material.<br /><br />There is rumors on the clearnet about how heating your bud in the oven will make it &quot;stronger&quot; because it decarbs all the THCa into THC. There is no science to support this or contradict it but based on my, admittedly limited, understanding of the myriad processes, I believe those people are just stupid and don&#039;t realize that the lost weight means they end up packing more cannabinoids into a bowl.<br /><br />More specifically, the reason I think it is bullshit is because the process of smoking, vaporizing, or anything else involving heat and inhalation will convert THCa into THC.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />I highly suggest not trying to make &quot;snuff&quot; though. Just... don&#039;t snort it, really. Nicotine is FAR more psychologically per mg than THC is, that&#039;s why snuff works for tobacco. Nicotine also absorbs through your skin with relative ease... as in, if you drop liquid nicotine onto your skin, you need to go to the hospital.<br /><br />However, an oven-decarb will(should) allow you to eat the weed straight and get high from it. Plus, you could just stick it in your mouth like chewing tobacco or something.<br /><br />If anyone wants the Blargh-theory to making the best fucking canna-lcohol ever, just PM me. Until it gets tested, I won&#039;t know if it IS the best, but I&#039;m pretty confident in the theory.<br /><br />In addition, I&#039;ve got actual experience combined with a little theory on making the stealthiest edibles possible. And by stealthy, I mean no canna-taste but FULL stone.

				What the fuck ? You are supposed to smoke the weed, sometimes eat it but don&#039;t fucking sniff it...Day by day I am coming to the conclusion that the world is coming to an end sooner than we think.

I knew an old hippy who was unable to smoke anymore, so he liked to eat his buds whole, and he did get high from it. Still wouldn&#039;t recommend it though, especially as the threshold dose is far beyond that of smoking it. If someone does want to eat it, I would suggest they decarboxylate the weed first, to get the maximum amount of THC in the buds at the time that it is eaten.<br /><br />As to snorting it, THC is a non-polar solvent and so is nearly insoluble in water, so the basic chemistry is prohibiting insufflation from working. Even if it could be absorbed, the amount necessary to get high vs the surface area of the weed means you will be putting a lot of weed up your nose, most of it inactive organic material. So no, even if you could get high that way, I doubt you could insufflate enough THC fast enough to get high.
