				a few days ago, I took 20 hits of LSD, about 2000ug. I had never taken this much LSD before. at most i had taken 3 hits at once.<br /><br />At normal dosages, LSD distorts the sense of time, but at this&nbsp; dosage I entered a timeless state of existence. At first it was the most beautiful state i had ever experienced, but this changed into a terror like no terror i&#039;d ever felt.&nbsp; Each breath I took and each beating of my heart felt like an eternity, sounds stretched out to the point where they were unrecogonisable, everything i saw seemed to move at a snail&#039;s pace, colours were bleeding into each other, i could feel the vibrations of the blood coursing through all of my veins, and i could hear all kinds of strange high frequency sounds that i had never heard before, they felt like they were entering my mind, reading my thoughts, and then leaving<br /><br />The feeling of timelessness was so profound, that I thought I had stopped breathing and when i put my hand on my chest i thought that my heart stopped beating because each beat took an eternity, I thought I was dead and had passed into some kind of afterlife, and this lead to all kinds of terrifying fears that i believed with absolute certainty. Everything I saw seemed to confirm, through symbolism, that I was dead. I was crying and begging to be given a second chance, and fearing that i had wasted my entire life. i felt like i was in hell, and i still have a strange intuition that i am going to pass into this state after i die. <br /><br />i can&#039;t even remember all of the thoughts and fears that were going through my head at this time; what i have said only touches upon the bear surface of my experience. I wish i had the ability to describe the things that i had seen, the places i had been to,&nbsp; the evil things that talked to me, which i still don&#039;t know whether they came from myself or exist independently of me<br /><br />When i started to feel better, i felt like the gods had taken pity on me and given me a second chance, but i was reborn into the body of someone identical to me, in some kind of parallel existence, or new cycle of the eternal recurrence. i thought the old me had died in the other world and i was deeply sad that i had left so many people behind. i thought the old me had got hit by a car, and that the only reason i had no recollection of it was because i was under the influence of lsd.<br /><br />i beg you, please, don&#039;t do LSD at this high a dosage, unless you have worked your way up to it first!!<br /><br />i would not wish this experience even upon my worst enemies. this is what hell will be like, if it exists

				This is all a dream. It&#039;s your mind&#039;s release of DMT right before death so you can live out the rest of your life. Which means you can do anything you fucking want to in this world.

				Sober sitters can help with things like this. I&#039;ve never dosed this high before though mind you, so who knows if you&#039;d even be able to see or comprehend a friend trying to calm you down.

My vision was more and more replaced with full blow visuals until I was thrown out of this world.<br /><br />&quot;The feeling of timelessness was so profound, that I thought I had stopped breathing and when i put my hand on my chest i thought that my heart stopped beating because each beat took an eternity, I thought I was dead and had passed into some kind of afterlife, and this lead to all kinds of terrifying fears that i believed with absolute certainty.

I was one with everything, but nothing at the same time, everywhere but nowhere It was the most fucked shit. I then was seeing my life before my eyes, I watched and accessed every memory I had up until the moment I took the 2c-p, I remember feeling that I was going to die, I was scared shitless, thinking of my family and girlfriend, anything good in my life wishing that I would see them again. I was 100% convinced that death was at the end of what I would call an out of body experience.<br />Then something weird happened, this all happening made me realize that I actually am very happy with my life, I am usually a little down.&nbsp; And in that instant I felt what could be described&nbsp; as complete inner peace, accepting death and the end of my life. (I should note I thought I had snorted 4mg, so I was like just go with it, your bitching it.) And at that moment it felt like my breathing had stopped completely as had my heart and I was fine with that. That feeling lasted 1-2 seconds and I snapped out of it and realized what was happening and just pushed my hands as hard as I could pushing me off of my bed, forcing my out of this dream state( I have done this to get out of bad dreams since I was a kid)&nbsp; I was overwhelmed with a billion emotions, most of them positive, I was so happy to be alive and I truly felt like I met death, racing for air just forcibly breathing. It felt so good to be alive.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;When i started to feel better, i felt like the gods had taken pity on me and given me a second chance, but i was reborn into the body of someone identical to me, in some kind of parallel existence, or new cycle of the eternal recurrence. i thought the old me had died in the other world and i was deeply sad that i had left so many people behind. i thought the old me had got hit by a car, and that the only reason i had no recollection of it was because i was under the influence of lsd&quot;<br /><br />Same when I had come back I felt lucky to be alive, like a second chance, but it felt so weird just like &#039;i was reborn into the body of someone identical to me&#039;<br />30+ hours later when I stopped tripping I realized I had measured out 40mg and snorted that, so If i had know I was actually in danger I would probably be in a ward, just from psyching myself out. <br />

				haha!&nbsp; <br /><br />try and chill out, man.&nbsp; I know these types of experiences can be very frightening if you&#039;re new to them and don&#039;t have a supporting guide with you.&nbsp; but really, you&#039;ve been blessed.&nbsp; What you surmised is true:&nbsp; the old you did indeed die on that trip and you are new so don&#039;t waste this one or you&#039;ll have to do another 20 hits of acid to refresh again.<br /><br />you said that your intuition tells you that you will pass to a hellish place when you die?&nbsp; if this is what you feel, then it is true.&nbsp; I urge you not to stop here with your psychedelic exploration, you can fix this.&nbsp; It sounds to me like you&#039;ve got some demons to fight; you need to be up to the challenge.&nbsp; only you can turn that hell into heaven, and no one can tell you how to do it.&nbsp; <br /><br />you are an immortal warrior from the time before time; go forth and slay those demons my brother.&nbsp;

				Taking 20 is a bit insane to begin with i suppose. LSD can result into a very realistic dream, bit also in a complete nightmare. There is no guarantee in how it turns out even taking the pure substance - take care before you end up permanently insane!

				This experience reminded me a lot of my own &quot;bad trip&quot; which retrospectively I&#039;m grateful for.<br /><br />Firstly, I also felt like I was going to die (while I kinda know that maybe that was the fear of the out of body experience) but that made me come face to face with the &quot;horror&quot; and really ask my soul what is it that really holds me to this life, to which the answer was my mother. From that day there is nothing my mum can do to me that will make me angry because I look back at that experience and realize that deep down both me and my mum love each other unconditionally. And if I&#039;m one step away from death ever again, it is my mum I will be crying for. <br /><br />Secondly you mention being in hell and battling demons and that is precisely how it felt for me too. I know everyone says it&#039;s all in your head once it&#039;s over, and in a way it is, but the way I look at it is that on your LSD high you enter into the world of your subconscious (and even deeper) which is still very real. Also entities do exist, but we don&#039;t normally see them. So while we don&#039;t come face to face with our own &quot;demons&quot; while sober, we sometimes do when on LSD. And I&#039;m pretty sure mine was one nasty fucker - the whole thing reminded me of exorcist - I was trying to cling to the simplest acts of love and the demon would not allow me and then I could hear it scream when I was trying to play a positive song (e.g. John Lenon - Imagine). It was like I was trying to calm down the most negative force I have ever met - and I&#039;m pretty confident no matter how negative I sometimes may be - I would never become so evil like the thing I was facing. That being said, I figured out how to stand up to it soon enough (which was positive music and repeating my meditation mantra) and from that moment it didn&#039;t bother me again during that or subsequent trips. However, since then, I have become more sensitive to the frequencies that all our actions emit (e.g. the mere talk of something negative for me means I&#039;m tapping into the demonic frequency so I&#039;d rather always talk about good stuff).
