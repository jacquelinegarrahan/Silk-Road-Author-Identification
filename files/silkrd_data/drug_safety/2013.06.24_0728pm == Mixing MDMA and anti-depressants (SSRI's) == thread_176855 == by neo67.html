				Is this wise? I guess not because both effect the release of serotonin but how common is serotonin syndrome? <br /><br />I&#039;ve been on SSRI&#039;s (citalopram) for a year now, 40mg a day (a pretty high dose really)- i know i shouldn&#039;t be thinking about taking drugs like MDMA whilst on SSRI&#039;s but i want to know how serious the consequences can be if i do?<br /><br />Someone please help,<br /><br />Thanks.

				SSRIs will kill the MDMA high IIRC. Not 100% sure though.

				SSRI&#039;s will completely nullify the MDMA experience, rendering effectively nothing more than speed. Serotonin syndrome is also a real possibility.

				Do not take MDMA while on ADs. You will not roll at all, no matter how much MDMA you take. You will either have no effects (except stimulation from dompaine) or get serotonin syndrome so absolutely no reason to try. I have had mild serotonin syndrome before and it SUCKS. It was by far the worse feeling/experience ever!<br /><br />I would strongly suggest remaining on your AD especially if you are benefiting from it. If you discontinue your AD your depression will return and when you do roll your depression will be exaggerated after the experience. Being massively depressed is not worth 3-5 hours of rolling. Wait until your mood stabilizes and your experience will be much more enjoyable and the crash will be minimal. <br /><br />If you decide to not follow my advice be aware that you should NOT quit your AD cold turkey. You will need to titrate off. After you have been completely weened off your AD you will need to wait at least a month probably longer before you try MDMA because of the high dose and long duration. Basically you have to wait til the AD has left your system which takes time. If you decided to take this route wait til someone more knowledgeable comments about titration and how long it is in your system.

				I&#039;d agree with the above: you will not get any fun effects of mdma while on ssri&#039;s. <br /><br />You can get negative and even dangerous effects like serotonin syndrome if you do so anyway, all of that without any positive experience. <br /><br />I&#039;m not overy sure about the time it would take between being off SSRI&#039;s and being to enjoy mdma again, but the timeframe is at the very least a week or so, and giving it a month may be a wise precaution.

				All your replies have been noted..so thank you for them! I will not take any MDMA whilst on SSRI&#039;s it seems it is not worth it at all. Waste of money at least and with a high probability of SS, no i wont go there!<br /><br />One more question though will MDMA store well? if i leave it in a cool,dark environment will it still be as potent as it was when it was first made?<br /><br />thanks guys

				Sure, its a stable molecule and should store very well in dark, dry, cool conditions. Don&#039;t overdo the &#039;cool&#039; part though: Its perfectly fine to store it at freezer temperature, but once you take it out condensation will form unless its hermetically sealed and that can affect potency on the long run. <br /><br />The best place to store it is in some dark place (and in brown bottles) somewhere around the house where its not too moist and the temperature is relatively constant, such as a pantry. A livingroom drawer will be fine too however, unless it gets extremely hot there in summer (i dont know where you live, it would obviously work better in new york compared to miami with windows on the south).

				Thanks Ben for your reply, very reassuring it is now kept safe and sound like a little baby is kept in the warmth of his/hers mothers arms.....occasionally checking up on it, feeding it, changing its nappy(diaper), helping it to grow and become a potent drug....to realize its potential!!! hhaahha wtf!

				I have taken MDMA (as well as M1) on high does of SSRIs and have felt the full effects!<br />It&#039;s no wise and the next few days are not pleasant but it works just fine for me, maybe it depends on the person.

				i watched a friend go into a full-blown 40-minute seizure because they took 200mg molly while they were on ADs.. as we were all rolling too it was a pretty horrific experience to see one of our best friends seizing uncontrollably and pissing themselves with no way to help her except to try and hold her down and keep her airways open until the paramedics arrived.&nbsp; it was deeply traumatic enough for one of our clique that they soon after quit using all drugs except weed, including alcohol, and they still won&#039;t even touch a hydrocodone or even look at a shroom to this day.<br /><br />i also take ADs myself and have for most of my life and as a teenager i experimented a lot with MDMA, and while i had some amazing times when i wasn&#039;t take SSRIs, when i was the crash that followed would leave me feeling extremely suicidal and withdrawn and disoriented for up to two weeks..&nbsp; and beyond that, it would barely do shit except make me feel a little jittery and nauseous.&nbsp; the only time i really felt anything close to rolling on ADs was when i took 400mg of MDMA, but about thirty minutes after peaking i had a complete emotional breakdown and a mild psychotic break (i could hear people crying and screaming and moaning that didn&#039;t exist, i heard police sirens and walkie talkies and cops walking around outside and thought i saw someone peeking through the window, i was crying so hard at one point that i threw up and then fell face forward into the puke and just kept wailing).&nbsp; i had to be hospitalized for two weeks.<br /><br />just don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; especially if AD&#039;s really do help you (like they do me, i would be dead without them).&nbsp; and don&#039;t titrate yourself off without really looking into it and hopefully talking with your psych doc..&nbsp; crazymeds is a good site with a lot of info on self-titration, as is the icarus project, if you choose to do it that way though..<br /><br />look at it this way: would you rather feel really fucking amazing for a couple hours and then be miserable the rest of the time you&#039;re conscious, or feel better and normal all the time and just stick to drugs that don&#039;t fuck your personal neurochemistry so hard??&nbsp; it was an easy choice for me, at least...

				That is a choice for anyone to make personally. SSRI&#039;s can sometimes be beneficial, but also have serious side effects ranging from apathy to sexual dysfunction. <br /><br />As far as messing with neurochemistry: being on ssri&#039;s does that 24/7, by design and mechanism of action. This does not mean they are a &#039;bad thing&#039; per se at all, but you must realize this when committing to treatment by these substances. If the alternative is dealing with depression i can certainly see the value in ssri&#039;s, but if you are prescribed ssri&#039;s for anything else (like anxiety) i would seriously reconsider.
