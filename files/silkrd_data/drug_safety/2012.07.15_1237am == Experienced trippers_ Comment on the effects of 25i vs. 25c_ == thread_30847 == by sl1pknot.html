				I have recently had my first 25i experience, which was lovely. My friends and I all were surprised at the warmness and visuals of the experience. I am curious about trying out other NBOMe compounds, and I see 25c is quite popular here. I was wondering if anyone who has some broad experience with the NBOMes could comment on the difference between the 25i trip and the 25c trip. And possibly the other similar drugs. Thank you.

				From a discussion with someone who had taken both 25i and 25c (and both of them together too!), apparently 25c destroys 25i. Much stronger visuals, more europhia, more trippy than 25i.<br /><br />And then you have 25d, which according to foxymeow (last time I checked, he/she is the only vendor with 25d because it&#039;s even newer than 25i/25c!), IS EVEN BETTER THAN 25c.

				And 25c is more potent by dose than 25i correct? I see the blotters for sale are usually smaller ug dosage. Is a ~600ug 25c trip similar to a 1000ug 25i trip or still &quot;better?&quot;

				25c felt way more euphoric, but seemed to have less visuals than 25i.&nbsp; I found 25c to be way better.&nbsp; 25c seemed kind of cloudy to me also.&nbsp; Different type of visuals in my experience.&nbsp; Not insanely different though.

				Wait till you try 25D.<br /><br />The thing about 25C is it has a lower dose/response curve. Taking too much 25C can be much more of unpleasant and overly intense trip. Whereas 25I is much more forgiving.<br /><br />3 hits of 25C (even at 600ug) would be way more intense, for better or for worse, than 3 hits of 25i.<br /><br />25D is just completely different, and is pretty impossible to explain to be honest.

				I am very interested in finding out these differences also!&nbsp; I&#039;m really hoping that when I wake up tomorrow, i&#039;ll be having a nice espresso on the balcony and hear my mailman with foxy&#039;s tabs come-a-rumblin!<br />That would make my day!<br />Only had 25i, but found it amazing!&nbsp; Great visuals and great positive mood enhancement!

I took 25i 1.2mg blotter last week and 25c last night from Tyl3r Durden&#039;s capsules :)<br /><br />25i is far more visual and has a decent amount of euphoria. I found it harder to communicate though, but that might just be me. Amazing visuals for me and lots of OEVs, really fun experience and seemed more introspective.<br />25c was mildly visual. Colours look amazing and really saturated and glowing. I didn&#039;t experience any OEVs at 300ug though. Lots of euphoria though, and I was really chatty with my friends who were feeling similar. It seems like a far better drug for parties/festivals.

				I&#039;ve had both by Tyler, and to me, 25i is more visually stimulating always.<br />And it&#039;s better overall as well.<br />Seems that either we&#039;re getting NBOMe of varying quality, or the NBOMes have extraordinarily individual effect. Or both.

				25i is eye candy with a mood boost. There is euphoria but it&#039;s mild compared to 25c and 25d. It makes everything seem pretty and flowing with life ... the mood boost gives you a sense of awe and excitement when you&#039;re looking at things, like the way you imagine children discovering things for the first time. I normally need to concentrate to actually see visual distortion, slight morphings going back and forth of various edges. When looking at photos, parts of the people in them shift a little bit, kind of a toned-down version of those Harry Potter pics. <br /><br />25c is a euphoric chem, a nice and steady stream of bodily goodness fills you and stays for the duration of the trip. Visuals are strongest in the beginning but as the euphoria kicks in the visuals start to die down. <br /><br />25d&nbsp; is also euphoric but instead of a steady always-there kind of euphoria, it comes in rolls. Think molly/mda but the rolls happen less frequently and also peak for much longer --about 30 seconds to a full minute before tapering back down. The euphoria surges into you and fills you up, then resonates within you for a long while before settling down to a steady buzz of bliss. There&#039;s also some time dilation so the rolls can sometimes feel like they&#039;re never-ending. The visuals are similar to 25c in that they start to die as the euphoria kicks in. <br /><br />P.S. 25b is one of the more forgotten nbomes because it&#039;s difficult to obtain but it&#039;s eye candy on steroids. The visuals make everything look like they&#039;re filled with vivid technicolor life, a sense of magic is infused into everything. It also allows you to hear things with crystal clarity; I remember zoning into certain sounds only to realize later on that they were just footsteps of a neighbor walking up their stairs or the water trickling into the ice-maker (made me feel like superman at times). Music sounds awesome, you can pick up any instrument in the background. It also felt like my blood was flowing with adrenaline the entire time and my emotions were all heightened. It&#039;s lots of fun so pick some up if you ever see these gems up for sale.

I have no idea what people are talking about visuals on 25i, I took 2000ug myself and found I actually had to concentrate on a wall, floor or other surface to actually get visuals which mostly consisted of quite beautiful patterns, minor nonetheless. Sitting on the bed I could see tiny moving snakes on the stitching of my blanket. The tiny snakes turned into maggots which was pretty cool. For me, 25i was visually underwhelming, but llykins describes it well. I&#039;d say about 80% of the trip is all about the mood, everything is quite interesting, and you feel very creative.
