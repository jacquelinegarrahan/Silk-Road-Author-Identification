				Okay im looking to try DMT for the 1st time and i&#039;ve been looking around on SR and i see a couple different kinds of DMT!!!(4-AcO DMT,5-MeO DMT, then there&#039;s just a DMT listing) and i know that i need the 5-Meo DMT, but what&#039;s the difference between the other DMT&#039;s and the 5-MeO DMT?

				I have tried DMT and 5-MEO-DMT and here is my trip report and summary of the two.&nbsp; <br /><br />My third trip on DMT was without a doubt the scariest and coolest experience of my life.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now I have experimented with LSD, shrooms, ecstacy and a fair bit of research chemicals in the 2cfamily but I have never experienced anything like the DMT trip I experienced the other night.&nbsp; <br /><br />The setting:&nbsp; Two friends and myself, in a room lit by a big candle with some kind of awesome tribal music playing in the background.<br /><br /><br />We all loaded 60mg of DMT crystals, which were a tan-brownish color, into our crack pipes.&nbsp; Yeah, you have to smoke DMT out of a crack pipe, so you’re aware the whole time you’re about to smoke a freaking hardcore drug.&nbsp; <br /><br />I load up my pipe with 70mg of DMT.&nbsp; <br /><br />The taste is god-awful, like burnt plastic.&nbsp; I remember laying back and the effects coming on in seconds.&nbsp; <br /><br />It’s pretty scary thing smoking DMT, because DMT is released from your brain when you die, and you’re about to put that in your body via a crackpipe and butane lighter.<br />&nbsp; <br />Within seconds my vision changed and it looked like I was looking through gel.&nbsp; There was a thick viscous gel covering everything making it look plastic or something and then piece by piece the DMT coursing through my body took away all my senses: My ability to regulate time, my vision, my hearing…<br /><br />I no longer knew who I was, where I was, that I had a body, or that I had memories I just went for a ride, a very unnerving ride.&nbsp; I felt like I was touring through the operating system of the human mind.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />If you could imagine your consciousness, as a Ping Pong ball.&nbsp; A ping Pong ball that sits in the middle of your brain and makes all your sensory information come together.&nbsp; I felt as if my “Ping Pong ball of Consciousness” just got bounced around my head for 10 minutes.&nbsp; It was scary and beautiful and felt all too familiar.<br /><br />The only thing I can compare it to&nbsp; is a feeling I got in my “rolling days” when we would pass each other out.&nbsp; If you’ve ever done this then you have felt a tiny DMT trip.&nbsp; That feeling of&nbsp; “coming back” from being passed out is the feeling of DMT, but it lasts for 10 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember thinking I was at some sort of Native American séance because at one point I had vision of my friend who suddenly looked like an Indian in the candle-lit room. I laid back and the ceiling lowered and dropped at my face it danced there for a few minutes and piece by piece I started to remember things and figure out where I was.&nbsp; I tasted the disgusting taste of plastic in my mouth, I remembered I smoked DMT the visuals were still going pretty hard and its at this point I start to figure out where I am and that I am DMT tripping.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to hold on to that world where “I didn’t know who or what I was…that DMT crazy fractal world and was able to minutes after I figured out I was tripping.&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt as if God took me on a magic carpet ride, and I don’t even believe in God.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This feeling persisted for another few minutes leaving my whole DMT experience to be about 15-17 minutes long, with after effects for at least 60 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />When I tried 5-MEO-DMT a couple years back it was much more “horrifying” and certainly much more of an elusive trip.&nbsp; I broke through but I have very few memories of this trip.&nbsp; It was very colorful like the most amazing Acid trip but was pretty different than regular DMT. <br /><br />&nbsp;On 5-MEO-DMT I felt like I was a chimpanzee that was dying.&nbsp; I found out later that my friends recorded me, because all I could say was “oh my fucking god, holy fucking shit, oh my god” on loop for a few minutes.&nbsp; It’s worth it, and If I could go back I’d probably do DMT before 5-MEO-DMT as that would be a logical progression.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				All of those drugs are of a class of psychedelics known as tryptamines.<br /><br />The typical DMT is N,N-dimethyltryptamine, a naturally occurring psychedelic. It can be found as white crystals (usually pure, may have some solvent residue), yellow crystals (some plant/solvent impurities or n-oxide DMT), red gunk (aka jungle spice, often DMT with plant oils/fats involved). A breakthrough dose is very visual and intense.<br /><br />There is 5-MeO-DMT which is known for being very intense - especially in terms of body load. It&#039;s not very visual though. New psychedelic users aren&#039;t recommended to use this..<br /><br />4-AcO-DMT is a research chemical similar to mushrooms which is 4-HO-DMT. 20-25mg is similar to 3-3.5g of cubes.

				Jookie knows his stuff, I&#039;d recommend taking N,N DMT (just regular old DMT) or maybe Changa if it&#039;s your first time and then experimenting with 5-MeO-DMT and 4-AcO-DMT. The latter is pretty different in my opinion from the first too, if you&#039;re looking for the classic DMT trip I&#039;d stick with DMT or Changa.

				Changa is herb mixed with DMT, it&#039;s considered easier to smoke by some people. Could be either kind of DMT mixed with herb, it&#039;ll depend on the vendor.

Also, consider making it yourself.

				Haven&#039;t bought DMT from SR yet, but I&#039;d go with either DiMiTri, his Changa has great reviews, or BuddhaNature, who just has incredible reviews for everything and apparently has some very high quality N,N-DMT. I&#039;d try both&nbsp; :)

If the solution is too concentrated then it will crash back out into red goo and harden when dried. Just take 10g&#039;s or so of yellow crystals and melt then in a hot water bath and they turn into a red mass. <br /><br />From my experiences n-oxide isnt any less potent than fresh nndmt, though due to having been oxidized is probably much more stable. <br /><br />also protip: dont use xylene as your solvent, even if you defat first, dont use xylene ever except for mesc extractions.

				Since everyone seems to be saying you should be careful with DMT, I just want to chime in with my first time. <br />I had heard of the drug but had little to no idea what it really was or what to expect. <br /><br />One afternoon my buddy asks me if I want to try it. I ask a couple questions but pretty much just get &quot;it&#039;s intense, you gotta try it.&quot; Well, he measures out a moderate dosage out of a glass pipe and hands it to me and tells me what to do: smoke it all in one go, hold it in as long as you can, etc. and I follow his instructions. <br /><br />The first thing I remember is my whole body shaking. I collapse back into a chair and have an intense wave of just...sensory intensity for about ten minutes or so. <br /><br />So I say it is a very intense drug, and I didn&#039;t really have any visuals (some distorting/vividness), but it is wonderful and I love it. I think as long as you have some supportive friends or a supportive/comforting environment it is a fine drug to try. I&#039;d only caution to attempt a lower dosage and work your way up (with any drug really). <br /><br />Pretty much what everyone else said but if I had read this thread before I tried it my first time, I&#039;d probably have felt a lot more anxious than I did. The important thing is to let yourself relax and let the world go by. <br /><br />
