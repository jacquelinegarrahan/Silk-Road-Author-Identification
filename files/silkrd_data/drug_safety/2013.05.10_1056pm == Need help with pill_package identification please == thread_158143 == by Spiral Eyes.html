				Hey all. Today I received a package from Thailand containing something like 100 little tan round pills with an &quot;S&quot; on one side. They are tiny, about 1/4&quot;&nbsp; across and 1/8&quot; deep. I don&#039;t remember ordering anything from Thailand, and I have no idea what these pills are. Can anyone shed any light on this? I&#039;m almost 100% certain they were sent to me by mistake. And no, I will not send them to you so you can check them out...&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

Have you ever received unidentified drugs before joining the road? I know I&#039;ve ordered shit from ebay/amazon while drunk and receiving it thinking WTF, did I buy this?? Though I suspect you keep a close eye on your BTC expenditure so it&#039;s a headscratcher! I wish I could receive random drugs in the post!

				&nbsp; Thanks guys. So, ya I did check pill id online when I got them, but nothing came up. That&#039;s why I posted here. I have been waiting for a pack from onion rx of codeine pills for awhile, which I&nbsp; FE for. Tonight, I got home and decided to check that listing in my history. The pic in the listing does look just like these. Before you call me a stoner, realize that all the codeine I&#039;ve ever got was white and bigger. These tan things look more like ecstasy or something.&nbsp; Also, I thought I&#039;d read Onion is in Uk, not Thailand, so that threw me off. Anyway, looks like I&#039;ve got it figured out. Waiting for confirmation from Onion. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone ever seen codeine like this before?

				Once I ordered a UK listing of xanax 1mg purple footballs..that was suppose to be shipped from the UK. 2 months later after I figured it was lost, it came from Thailand.<br /><br />Many of these pill sellers(mostly cheap benzo sellers) have sources from the Middle east and Southern Asia where they make cheap ass bulk pills and sometimes they ship straight from the source.

				Vender has confirmed it was his package. Here is the listing:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4e74020e48<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen codeine like this, but I&#039;m not overly experienced with it. I&#039;ve had tylenol 3. Anyway, thanks for chiming in guys.
