				Last night my friend tried some of my 2c-b and loved it. I have not tried it before and planned on doing it tonight. He said he would like to do it again as well, but would it be worth it for him to do it 2 days in a row? Obviously the effects would be somewhat diminished, but would it be a total waste? Thanks in advance for any advice!

				there seems to be a phenomenon with 2c-i and 2c-e where doing them multiple days seems to make the redose more sensitive during your first few uses. i was told this has to do with the chemical still being present at the time and <br /><br />i am not sure if this is true for 2c-b.<br />the effects do seem to diminish over time if you aren&#039;t taking long enough breaks in between trips, and at those points - if you must - you have to dose higher<br /><br />my advice is to do the same dose or a little less with a booster on hand. weed can help with adjustments after that.

				Like ZingZong above says, same dose and then a booster an hour later, but not before an hour&nbsp; :) <br /><br />I do this from time to time when I take is Friday &amp; Saturday nights and notice only a mild increase in tolerance.<br /><br />As always MDMA at the beginning of the night then taking the 2C-B a few hours later is infinitely better and more fun&nbsp; ;D

				As someone who takes 2c-b on a semi-regular basis I can tell you that if you take it again the day after you have to take a much larger dose for it to be effective. I have found that taking a double dose the next day seems to do the trick, but I&#039;m guessing it varies from person to person. I normally take them in doubles anyway, so I find a quadruple hit the next day does me nicely. Hope this helps!

The whole point of the 2C-B is to extend your MDMA rolls and keep them going, and then it gives you a more warm gentle come down in the morning than the straight MDMA would have done alone.

				Not only does the roll get extended, but the visuals are exponentially increased (I think it has to do with the serotonin release, since the combo with methylone produced similar visuals).

It&#039;s also a well known anti-depressant which is why you feel great for days afterwards, and you always have a happy high. From my own personal experience and reading many many trip reports people always end up laughing their heads off for several hours on 2C-B.
