				Your heroin solution would have to be pretty concentrated to work in a nasal spray. You could just snort it, or plug it like someone else said. I would just snort the powder, why use a nasal spray for that? With fentanyl you don&#039;t have much of a choice since you&#039;d have to snort really small amount and ODing would be really easy. <br />If you plan on still putting it in a spray, keep in mind that one spray is around 1/8th of a mL so don&#039;t make it too dilute.

I wouldn&#039;t begin with heroin if you&#039;ve never had opiates before though, I&#039;d recommend starting with hydrocodone (vicodin) or something like that, but it&#039;s way too expensive on SR.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=169699.msg1210966#msg1210966">Quote from: hopdub on June 07, 2013, 06:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">waterline it<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What&#039;s waterlining? ???

				Snort or plug.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to plug, make sure you don&#039;t have a lot of shit in your colon.&nbsp; In other words, probably a good idea to use the toilet and wait a couple hours to plug.&nbsp; The poo matter sucks up a lot of the drugs before it can get absorbed into the colon walls.

				Well i tried #3 in a spray and it worked. only down side was the citric used to break it down is quite sticky so it was not a pleasant experience. Next i will try #4. I think this will be better.<br /><br />Purple hue, if you have never used H before and you sniff some please bear in mind that you may need to change your name to blue hue. Most of the h i have got on sr has been pretty stong and you could easily o d if you are on your own and trying for the first time. Just a thought.

				I know it sucks but this shit has me laughing.<br /><br />Plugging is just as good as shooting up without any of the track marks, abscesses, death, etc. It may seem gross but gawwwwdamn<br /><br />TO THE MOON!~<br /><br />&quot;There I said it.&quot;

				Plugging also makes a cleaner but stronger high.<br /><br />It gives you a good rush depending on what you are plugging.<br /><br />Edit: Make sure you go to the bathroom and wait a couple hours before though so there isn&#039;t a lot of poo matter still around in the colon.<br /><br />The poop will absorb a lot of the fluid if it&#039;s not excreted out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t plug my self but tried it with my ex.&nbsp; Drugs makes you do crazy things you would never do.

				Should i use or do an enema first. Seems like a lot of hassle to go to just to get a hit. Also when plugging would the angle of the syringe make a difference. I have to say i have plugged in the past but found it did not work well. I note that someone says it&#039;s just as good as a hit without the death ,abscesses ext. I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s that good but I am prepared to give it a go if it means re living&nbsp; the good old days. I must say i miss sticking pins in my arms ext.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s not that much work if you want to make the most out of every bit of your drug of choice.<br /><br />If you used the toilet earlier in the day enema is not necessary but if you haven&#039;t gone for 2-3 days then definitely yes.

It&#039;ll only help the absorption. Then you&#039;ve got a handy little syringe for the solution too! Also, if you&#039;re trying to get the feeling of IV without IV&#039;ng you should plug as whether you hold it in your nose in a water solution or snort it doesn&#039;t seem to make much difference.
