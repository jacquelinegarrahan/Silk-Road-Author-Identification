				MDMA and 2C-B are not really comparable, experience-wise.&nbsp; MDMA will cause you to &quot;roll,&quot; meaning that you&#039;ll probably feel very energetic and euphoric, won&#039;t mind dancing and talking all night.&nbsp; 2C-B will cause you to &quot;trip,&quot; which means you will probably think very differently than normal, as well as have sensory distortions (hallucinations).&nbsp; 2C-B is a particularly visual chemical (think &quot;oh shit, everything is a cartoooooon!&quot;), so as awesome as it is, I don&#039;t at all consider it a party drug.&nbsp; MDMA, however, is the ultimate party drug in my opinion.<br /><br />Here are a couple of links (clearnet) to get your started.&nbsp; Do lots of research before ingesting new chemicals.<br />www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb.shtml<br />www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma.shtml

				thanks for the reply Appa.<br />I do know the difference between rolling and tripping, but I heard that 2-cb, while a psychedelic, also has energetic qualities similar to MDMA.. hence it IS a party drug, clearly my source was wrong. But that&#039;s just what I heard, so I&#039;ll take your word for it and go with MDMA :)<br />thanks again.

				Yes, 2C-B does have energetic qualities, which I guess it&#039;s fair to compare to MDMA in some ways.&nbsp; They&#039;re both phenethylamines.&nbsp; Despite this, the heavy visual distortion that comes with 2C-B would make standard socializing difficult for me until perhaps a bit after the peak of the trip, whereas MDMA is, in my view, one of the ultimate social lubricants.&nbsp; I find it more empathetic and less distracting.&nbsp; However, a low dose (~10 mg) of 2C-B probably wouldn&#039;t induce many visuals, and could make a good party drug.&nbsp; It is somewhat popular in the rave culture, often because it&#039;s passed off as MDMA.<br /><br />Both chemicals are worth experiencing, I just consider MDMA to be a bit more social (unless most everyone you&#039;re hanging out with is also tripping on 2C-B, in which case it&#039;s often amazing).&nbsp; I hope you have a great time!

				MDMA is good at making you want to have sex and you might be more open about it, but it&#039;s not very good for the act itself. At least I know I can get really focused on touching and wanting to be touched (though mostly in non-sexual places, lol). <br /><br />What does 2-CB do for you? I get a lot of adjectives when I ask but rarely any specifics.

				I smiled when I saw this question. Just tried 2cb (from greenPEAS - 17mg oral + ~7mg insuffulated after an hour or so) and it was not what I was lead to believe it would be. Personally I found myself even more comfortable than I am with MDMA. No crazy mind bending or uncontrollable visuals at this dose for me. Some nice distortions, and a damn incredible feeling of openness. That was me though, and everyone responds differently!<br /><br />MDMA is not that much of a&nbsp; party drug as others are saying. The pills the high school kiddies get are usually cut with plenty of speed or some other junk and people are really shocked at how relaxing and calm MDMA can be is by itself.<br /><br />As with every other drug: SET AND SETTING!<br /><br />Godspeed on your travels!

				MDMA for me is the ultimate party drug, you can&#039;t beat the euphoria and love it produces. But it is not something I wish to indulge in more than a few times a year because of the known neurotoxic effects.<br /><br />So 2CB has actually become my go-to drug for most parties/raves/festivals etc. With the right dose, it can be the perfect psychedelic party drug. It&#039;s very easy for me to handle but makes the music &amp; lights look/sound so amazing and gives me enough energy to dance throughout the night and has little to no comedown/next day aftereffects. In the right setting it can have very strong empathogenic effects as well. I like to do 2-3 lines of ~8-10mg spaced throughout the night. <br /><br />I can also confirm sex on 2CB is absolutely amazing! Two weekends ago my boyfriend was rolling while I was on a moderate dose of 2CB and we had the most intense sex ever. 2CB does not impede erection like MDMA can sometimes.:)

Alexander Shulgin and David Nichols have both stated they believe there is little to no potential for 2CB neurotoxicity. And while there is little academic research on the neurotoxicity or side-effects of longterm 2CB usage, there is a long history of anecdotal frequent usage not resulting in noticeable harmful effects. On sites like Bluelight I have yet to encounter anyone claiming to have suffered depression/anxiety/&quot;brain zaps&quot; from long-term 2CB use (i.e. high doses multiple times a month for years at a time). People have also claimed to have done 100mg+ of 2CB over the course of a night and felt little to no residual negative effects over the next few days--which would be uncommon for a proportionally large dose of MDMA.<br /><br />You could not say the same for MDMA -- on sites like Bluelight the Ecstasy board is flooded with people claiming MDMA use has caused them significant problems from either long-term abuse or one-time binges with large doses. If 2CB caused significant neurotoxicity I think long-time users of drug-related forums would know about it by this time, considering its availability and low price.<br /><br />The one thing I would caution with frequent use of 2CB is the chance of developing Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) (look it up on wikipedia if you don&#039;t know it). 2C-X drugs are thought to be some of the most likely to cause this disorder if frequently (ab)used.

				I will be cranking out 2c-b smarties as soon as I get down with some IRL stuff. I just got 50g of 2c-b in. I am giddy with the amount of doses I can churn out. Now if only I could get a hold of some 180 Proof Grain Alchohol.

				I just took 2C-B last night for the first time and I&#039;ve done MDMA in the past and I&#039;d say the MDMA was much better in a social setting, I&#039;ve heard it called the Love Drug and that&#039;s what it does, you literally think everyone is beautiful and you love them all. 2C-B was more of an acid trip than MDMA roll, it was fun but I didn&#039;t love anyone anymore than usual.<br /><br /><br />From Shulgen&#039;s book:<br /><br />2C-B seems to be an extraordinarily colorful hallucingen similar to LSD -- apparently somewhat analytical and dissasociative in higher doses or in those sensitive to those effects.<br />&quot;At high doses (above 30 mgs.), 2C-B is intensely hallucinogenic, and, like any major psychedelic, can be frightening for certain people. In small doses, it becomes a mild sensory enhancer but does not have the strongly empathogenic qualities that MDMA has.&quot;<br />&nbsp;
