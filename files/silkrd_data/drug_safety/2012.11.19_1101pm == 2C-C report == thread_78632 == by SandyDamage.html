				Title: <strong>2C-C report</strong><br />

				10/20/12<br /><br />2C-C Trip Report<br />________________<br /><br />Dose: 208 mg (I would not recommend anyone taking a dose this high, it was given to me as a sample from my best friend who <br /><br />obtained it from a vendor off here. The biggest dose I&#039;ve read someone take was 120mg.)<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />*I am a regular user of benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medication) as I am scripted them, so this maybe why I did not <br /><br />experience a heavy body load like others have reported from the 2C-x family, nor any anxiety during the trip (for obvious <br /><br />reasons.) About 10 hours before the trip, I ingested my regular dose of 2mg Clonazepam.<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Ingested 9:00 P.M: Taste much worse than 2C-I or 2C-E in my opinion. I first ingested about half of the bag of 208 milligrams<br />at 9pm. At around 10:00pm, I decided to eat the remaining half of the bag. I have never read anyone taking such a high dose of <br />2C-C before, but I figured what the hell and prepared myself for the trip of my life.... so I thought. Prior to 2C-C, the 2 <br />weeks before I did 100 milligrams of 2c-I, 4 days later did 50 milligrams of 2C-E,and a few days later 2 hits of 25i-Nbome <br />(which were weak hits containing about 200mcg each.) I believe the reason I didn&#039;t trip as hard as expected is because of <br />having ingested a few phenethylamines the week or two before, so I already had a tolerance to the 2C-X family in my eyes.<br /><br />10:30 P.M: At this time, I felt a pretty heavy body load, no nausea at all, and put on my light up rave gloves. I sat in front <br />of the mirror in my basement for maybe 40 minutes twirling my fingers between each other, as well as giving myself a light <br />show. I was definitely seeing tracers, the patterns on the walls of my basement have these black lines as designs, I saw them <br />breathing and rippling. It was extremely pleasant. I then decided to go into my room which has a blacklight, glow in the dark <br />pot leaves on the ceiling, and prior to ingesting, I had taped glowsticks to my ceiling fan so when the fan was spinning all I <br />would see was glowing, spinning tracers. :) I also sat and stared at a Thomas Kinkade(sp?) wall mount picture that lights up, <br />and couldn&#039;t help to keep staring at the little cabins in the photo with light shining out of them. For a few minutes, I <br />actually felt if I was in the scenery of the painting though I was fully aware that my name is ****** and I live in *******. I <br />snapped out of it, stood up and walked into my room. Walking felt kick ass, and I really wanted to go for a walk around my <br />neighborhood just for the sake of walking, but there is a big police presence in my area and my pupils were the size of dimes. <br />lol So I sat down in bed with the blacklight on and spinning ceiling fan which is glowing.<br /><br />11:15 P.M: I kept thinking about what I was going to do with my life after graduating college in the next few months, and <br />realized I still have absolutely no idea , nor did it matter at that time. I kept thinking about my closest friends and how we <br />could start a business together, and how easily we could make it happen.For some reason, this thought would not leave my head <br />for some time. I visioned us operating a pyrotechnics business (something we all love and have a true passion for.) I then <br />realized at that moment that I am not just going to be able to sit here, and figure out what I am going to do for the rest of <br />my life. Sure I had ideas running through my head, but my brain kept telling me not to worry about it, and that &quot;you&#039;ll make <br />it someday, just enjoy your trip.&quot;&lt; Yes, my brain told me this lol.<br /><br />12:00 A.M: I started listening to some Swollen Members and Madchild&#039;s solo music, La Coka Nostra, Jedi Mind Tricks, <br />Snowgoons,(all hardcore underground rap) and realized I didn&#039;t enjoy it very much while tripping. I was watching the <br />visualizations in Windows MediaPlayer, and every 5 seconds or so, I would right click the play button and select &quot;play <br />slower&quot;, then go back to the normal speed of the song after my favorite verse had passed lol. I did this for about 30 minutes <br />with the underground rap and decided to put some Skrillex on. I don&#039;t know why, but the sound of a group of Transformers being <br />gangbanged, heavy metal objects being slammed into cars and random elephant trunk sounds, sounded great. I always loved EDM of <br />any sort, melodic trance, typical mainstream club shit (ie :Basshunter.) I sat back in my bed with my glow gloves on this <br />entire time, while watching the visualizations change in WMP. I loved hearing almost every song off the Bangarang album, as <br />well as watching him perform his live sets which were mashups and remixes of his previous songs. I was looking at my ceiling, <br />and noticed the walls felt like they were about 3 feet away from me, and then would &quot;breath out&quot; to their regular distance of <br />6 and a half feet away. I did notice a tiny bit of jaw tension, but nothing that made me realize after the trip, &quot;damn my jaw <br />fucking hurts.&quot;<br /><br />1:00 A.M: This is where things got really fuzzy. I recall sitting in my bed, staring at the blacklit pot leaves, and they were <br />kind of dancing around on the one part of my ceiling I have them stuck too. Each leaf was rotating about 180 degrees then <br />would move back to it&#039;s original position. Each leaf also had a halo-ish like glow around it, definitely amplified by the <br />blacklight and me ingesting a hallucinogenic substance. (duh)<br /><br />1:45 A.M: I went out my side door as quietly as possible, walked into the darkness of my backyard, and began smoking a <br />cigarette. I sat down out back in the &quot;backyard furniture chairs,&quot; slowly rocking back and forth in the chair while staring at <br />the trees around me. There was barely any wind, but all the leaves were moving around as if there were 20 mph gustsof wind. I <br />loved it. I sat outside for maybe 20 minutes after smoking, just looking at the neighboring houses an thinking about how <br />content I was with my life. There was nothing wrong at all, and my cheeks were killing me from smiling the whole time. (This <br />happens whenever I&#039;ve ingested any of the 2c-x&#039;s.)<br /><br />2:30 A.M: Went back into my home, went into the kitchen and just walked back and forth looking at the tiles on the floor. Each <br />one was unique, forming it&#039;s own breathing and line patterns. My kitchen and everything in my entire house seemed new, as if I <br />was seeing it all for the first time, though I still knew I had lived there for 15 years. I didn&#039;t care that I had to be up <br />for school in 2 and a half more hours, as I didn&#039;t plan on sleeping that night anyway. At one point, I was just thinking in my <br />own world, though again still fully aware of the address I was at, and that I was in my basement. I must have thought for a <br />while,&nbsp; because next time I looked at the clock it was 5:20 A.M and I had to begin getting ready for class. This is where it <br />got really fun.<br /><br />7:00A.M: Still seeing fractals and certain patterns and colors were extremely vibrant to me, all while riding the <br />train/subway. <br /><br />9:00 A.M School: Everything the professor asked me to answer, I had a very witty / smart ass response to that sent the entire <br />class laughing each time. (with me, not at me lol) The professor even found my answers to be funny. My pupils were still the <br />size of dimes, as I asked the kid next to me if it looked like I was tripping balls. He laughed and said &quot;shit, they&#039;re huge, <br />I knew something was a little different about you today.&quot; The classroom is small, but it felt so much more longer than it <br />really was. It was only an 18ft long room but the teacher seemed about 30-40 ft away. I started to experience some anxiety as <br />I felt myself coming down, so I wet in my pocket and placed a (2mg Clonazepam under my tongue 11A.M.) It definitely helped, <br />but I still had all this energy boiling inside my stomach that made me want to jump up, felt like I had electricity running <br />through my veins. I felt as if I was a power generator waiting to explode. It was truly a great feeling and experience that is <br />very hard to put into words. In short I would definitely do it again, I had a wonderful time. <br /><br />12:30P.M: I noticed that almost all the effects were gone by my afternoon class besides tracers, and I was still anxious. I <br />knew it was just the comedown of the drug, told myself I ingested 2mg of Clonazepam and that I&#039;ll be fine. The entire time in <br />school, I was able to volunteer, answer questions and ask questions all without anyone noticing I was tripping. (unless I told <br />them of course.)<br /><br />Hope this trip report helps those who are wondering how much 2C-C is &quot;safe&quot; to take. (Being it is an RC, I am aware there is <br />no &quot;safe&quot; dose.) I know it&#039;s hard to judge as everyone&#039;s brain chemistry is different. I&#039;ve read stories of people saying they <br />had terrible times on 50mg, and that was when I stopped reading trip reports lol. I wasn&#039;t trying to set my self up for a bad <br />trip. Clear your head ahead of time, go into it being self aware and you should be fine. --SandyDamage&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />
