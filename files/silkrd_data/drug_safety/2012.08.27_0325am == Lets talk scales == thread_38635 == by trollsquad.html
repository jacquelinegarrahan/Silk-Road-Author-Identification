				I&#039;m thinking of getting a gram of mxe and basically i need a new scale to do it safely. <br /><br />So i would really like to know what scales most of you guys prefer.&nbsp; best bamg for you buck would be nice as well.

				You can get scales on amazon that are .001 g for about 20-30 dollars. They work surprisingly well for me with an error margin of only +/- .002 g.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your just weighing out shit for personal use you don&#039;t need anything fancy but if your dealing and capping and want to be a good guy you need to throw out like over a hundred for a good miligram scale.

				Thanks guys i think i&#039;ll go for the AWS g&nbsp; 20 fpr the time being. I wont be being using it that often.&nbsp; Not many rcs i&#039;m trying to weigh out.&nbsp; If only 25i wasn&#039;t so small of a dosage.

				I&#039;d recommend the cheap one on Amazon for things like MXE, MDMA, etc. It is not a good idea to use it for substances such as 25i-NBOMe or DOC. I used it for 2c&#039;s with a steep response curve and it was a hit or miss. Sometimes my 20mg cap of 2c-i would be on the weaker side, but I also tripped balls on it one time with the &quot;same dose&quot;. It&#039;s probably the best scale for MXE, MDMA, etc. A decent scale for 2c&#039;s. And a terrible scale for NBOMes and DOx.

The 50 mg you can reliably measure with affordable scales, the 0.5 mg you cannot measure reliably without an analytical balance that costs more then the average car. <br /><br />The way to go then is to measure out the 50 mg of substance, and dissolve it into a suitable solvent. Something like methanol will work well for many drugs, but check solubility before proceeding. You use a pipet to add* 1.00 ml to the 50 mg you have weighed, and shake/stir/wait to dissolve completely. <br /><br />Then you take a 10 uL pipette to produce each individual 0.5 mg dose from the solution you just made. Once the solvent evaporates you have pretty precies 0.5 dosages of something you could not possibly measure to that accuracy. <br /><br /><br />* Technically you should not add 1.00 ml of solvent, but add solvent until the solution is 1.00 ml in total volume. Practically this doesn&#039;t make that much difference if you want to get it right down to a few percent, not to ppm&#039;s.
