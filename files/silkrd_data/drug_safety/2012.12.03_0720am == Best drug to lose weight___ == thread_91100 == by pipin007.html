				The amphetamine family. In the 60&#039;s and possibly earliler? until sometime later (I know I&#039;m very precise with my information) they used to prescribe dexadrine, which is an amphetamine but not straight up amphetamine. They also used to prescribe methamphetamine, I think for weight loss. So ......<br />And when you&#039;re on this stuff even eating is difficult and makes you feel kind of nauseous IME (even if you feel nauseous from not eating in the first place). Cocaine might also be a good one, but eating at all is dangerous if your throat is numb from the drip...<br />Uppers in general are appetite suppressants.<br /><br />I would imagine if you don&#039;t over do it with the amphetamine family and pop the pills, like say 10-20mg of dexadrine for example, it would work as an appetite surpressant without the effects mentioned above and without necessarily &quot;speeding&quot;...

				Meth may be effictive, but also a bit drastic.<br /><br />One of the best substances i found to result in weight loss is ephedrine, with a dosage of 30 to 70 mg a day. Taking it does make you a bit jittery (comparable to drinking too much coffee), but it will increase activity (i.e. jumping around) and reduce appetite somewhat too. <br /><br />There are some downsides though: it will make you anxious, if you have ever suffered from problems with anxiety, panic attacks and such, its not a good idea. Same goes for people with heart conditions and such.

				Cut Carbs from your diet. Eat Protein. Lower your caloric intake to 12 calories per pound of body weight.<br /><br />Run Clenbuterol with Ketotifen Fumarate for 3 weeks on, 1 week off. Rinse and Repeat. Do your research online, there&#039;s a ton of info on how to dose it among steroid/bodybuilding forums.<br /><br />Clen is a 10 hour stimulant, heats you up, kills belly fat... but has some manageable side effects.<br /><br />You could also do the ECA (Ephedrine, Caffeine, Asparin) Stack.

				From what I&#039;ve gathered it seems Clenbuterol and DNP are some of the best for losing weight. DNP is some serious shit though so know what your doing and own a scale.

				Meth.&nbsp; Oh wait....how important is tooth retention to you? <br /><br />If you like your teeth then phentermine and clenbuterol (not sure of the spelling or iff you can mix the two).&nbsp; Maybe adderall instead of any of those, but it gives more of a speedy high feeling that phertermine doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />

				IMO and the opinion of fit people I know dieting/maintaining weight is a lifestyle and using a drug as wild as METH to try and lose some weight is gonna create piles more problems then just your weight when your done lol<br /><br />I would listen to Knexx, join a gym and take it off 6-8lbs a month.

				DNP is a drug that inhibits ATP usage while uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation which means you basically turn energy into heat instead of it being used elsewhere. Similar to how hibernation works, it has been described as putting your body in a moving jogging rate all day. Basically it will raise your body temperature as it converts excess energy to heat. This allows for rapid weight loss, though it is a little dangerous with the raise in body temperature. It is safe an not carcinogenic as long as you don&#039;t exceed recommended dosages. If you go too high in dosage you literally just cook your organs to death so great care is required when using it.<br /><br />Also used to ignite TNT, it&#039;s some crazy stuff but highly effective. It will make you very tired as it depletes your energy all day so a ECA stack with ephedrine or clenbuterol or some kind of amphetamine is usually paired to get you through the day. With this combo weight loss will be incredible, the rumored 1lb a day. Great care is required though to balance this as it can be deadly if your careless. Please research before trying this shit.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol

				i have used adderal in combination with portion control and diet modification. kefir for breakfast. i prefer lifeway blueberry. 1 serving. it has great probiotics and aids in digestion and colon cleansing. eat 2 portions of protein daily no larger than the size of your fist. combine the protein with 2 servings of a grain or starch of your choice daily. 4 servings or more of vegetables daily(no carb containing vegetables!) go for as much dark green as you can ...again using your fist for portion guidance. <br />NO alcohol, soda or any kind of carbonated beverages(diet or regular). coffee and tea are a must! 2-3 days per week i use 5mg of adderal. im quite sensitive to stimulants and have residual appetite suppression into the days following administration, so...titrate to efffect.<br />one day per week i say fuck it and drink and eat what i want. i usually go for wings and beer!<br />ive lost 70lbs doing this! good luck!

				be careful ..<br /><br />If you want to loose weight I would suggest you take ephedrin. You stack it with asperin and coffein tablets. Just research in the clearnet ECA stack! Dont overdose, and just use it for a month on/ month off.<br /><br />If you need more advice just pm me&nbsp; :-*

				That sad truth is this: THERE IS NO GOOD WEIGHT LOSS DRUG.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; If there were, it would be legal.&nbsp; Are you fucking kidding me?&nbsp; My God, AIDS, diabetes and weight loss are like the golden trinity of pharmaceuticals.&nbsp; Whoever patents the first effective long-term weight loss pill, even if it crawls out of you at night and rapes your children, is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.<br /><br />You think people eat a lot now... just imagine what would happen if we could eat ice cream all day and not gain weight.&nbsp; Fuck, I admit it -- I&#039;d have one in my lap right fucking now.<br /><br /><br />Why I feel I&#039;m qualified to state this in absolutes: I tweak. Stimulants of all kinds are my thing.&nbsp; They will get you down there, but no matter what, they will not keep you down there.&nbsp; Sure, if you want to experience being 10-40 pounds thinner for a week or two before you yo-yo back and snap up past where you started... meth&#039;ll do the job, and you won&#039;t even have to try.<br /><br />But goddamn life must suck when you end up even fatter than before, and this time with a taste for meth.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; There is no good weight loss drug today, legal or otherwise.&nbsp; They will all fuck you up more than they&#039;re worth, fail you in the end, outright kill you, or just do nothing.<br /><br />And fuck Atkins and that no carb shit... lord, I&#039;m so sick of hearing about that.&nbsp; Atkins had a heart attack at a relatively young age -- you may want to consider that when gauging the effectiveness and health benefits of his eating plan.
