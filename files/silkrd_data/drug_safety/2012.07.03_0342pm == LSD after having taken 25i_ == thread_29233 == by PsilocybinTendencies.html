				This is in drug safety because it&#039;s about the safety of my LSD. Lol.<br /><br />I tried googling for this but I am obviously not a google-ninja by any means.<br /><br />In a previous thread somebody mentioned LSD as the granddaddy of psychedelics.<br /><br />Meaning that taking LSD will make other trips suck, but LSD will still feel pure and true even after tripping on other stuff.<br /><br />My question, anyone have any experience with LSD while they have a tolerance to 25i?<br /><br />I had my first 25i experience two nights ago, and I was thinking about eating some Lucy tonight, but I don&#039;t want to waste my acid.<br /><br />Is this advisable?

				Just wait&nbsp; a week. You&#039;ll get more out of the experience all ways around. Unless of course you feel an overwhelming desire to eat LSD tonight. Were that the case, by all means indulge and learn your lessons. Shit, you can take a look at drug safety just to see how much I&#039;ve learned mine!&nbsp; :P

				LSD is the grandaddy of psychedelics, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s the best.&nbsp; Each psychedelic is it&#039;s own, and some offer advantages (and disadvantages) in comparison to LSD.&nbsp; Treat each as a drug in their own right, don&#039;t force a comparison to LSD, and you will get the most out of each.<br /><br />There is a fairly large cross tolerance between LSD and 25i-NBOMe.&nbsp; Waiting a couple days will significantly reduce that, and waiting two weeks will hugely help.&nbsp; However, if you have it now, here is what you can expect:<br />25i targets the 5ht receptor responsible for giving visuals the most (which is why 25i has such amazing visuals).&nbsp; It does not target the receptors responsible for chaotic thoughts or spirituality as largely or at all, respectively.&nbsp; This means that were you to take LSD right now, you would get less visuals than a normal LSD trip for that dose, but you would still get most of the mindset and the spiritual thinking.&nbsp; Taking a larger amount of LSD would increase all of the above.

				Albions recent Beatles?&nbsp; Please update with a report!<br /><br />I have some of those coming right now.&nbsp; SOOOOO excited!<br /><br />I&#039;m curious...how much 25i do you usually take, to where you don&#039;t get visuals?&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken 1mg blotters (wedged between gum and upperlip) 3 times and 2x1mg blotters twice (same administration method).&nbsp; On 1mg, good visuals, interesting thought patterns, odd body...kinda a bit tweaky...some time dilation.<br />On 2mg, visuals were very intense, experienced very trippy thoughts and ideas, would have some thought-loops for 5-10 minutes at a time, EXTREME time dilation, found myself muttering to myself about all kinds of stupid shit, slight ego death, a good amount of introspection and insight.&nbsp; The second time I took 2mg, I ended up lifting weights for 30 minutes (curls, bench, shoulder press and pullups) and was going at it so hard and fast that I pulled some muscles and hurt my elbow joints.&nbsp; 25i is weird...not really sure how I feel about it.&nbsp; The body is too unpleasant and the taste is just abysmal.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t like about 25i is that you get really sick feeling if you drink alcohol....which absolutely never happens on LSD.

				I&#039;ll give u as much of a report as I can. I&#039;m under the influence of 1 beatle tab from albion right now. Which by the way, came packaged very cleverly, and promptly.<br /><br />This beatle tab is being effected by my first time dosing 25I, two days ago, compliments of hardhustle, 2mg. So take that as you will.<br /><br />Also I&#039;ve done a small bump of meth in the morning the past couple days.<br /><br />Holy fuck I think I just hallucinated while staring intently at the screen... well maybe not but...<br /><br />Its very clean. I now know what people mean when they say &quot;clean,&quot; this is fucking perfect. My head is not tangled up and messy, and feel coherent but I definitely have the body buzz euphoria factor going on. Idk bout you guys but that feeling is exactly what I&#039;m seeking when I do a drug recreationally.<br /><br />I went out exploring earlier, and wasn&#039;t scared.<br /><br />The 25I was fucking amazing too, rainbow. There is absolutely no aspect of it I didn&#039;t enjoy. <br /><br />Anyway yea there are moments where I think I&#039;m seeing like a blueoragish wave swirl hallucination in the corner of my vision, but then I snap back into it.<br /><br />Its probably just because of the tolerance thing, but this is one of the most unique lsd trips I&#039;ve ever had in my life. Its fun but still very tame and chill. I&#039;m fucking loving every moment of it. I had to question whether it was lsd, this feeling is so distinct from other trips I&#039;ve had, but there is no doubt.<br /><br /><br />I think you guys are going to love these tabs.

				That&#039;s awesome dude.&nbsp; What type of visuals?&nbsp; Would categorize them more as wavy, swirly, pattern based....or just anything you look at starts morphing?<br /><br />Any taste on the blotter?<br /><br />How long did it take to come up?&nbsp; How long did the peak last?&nbsp; How long was the trip, overall?&nbsp; How easy/hard to get to sleep afterwards?<br /><br />Any interesting thoughts, insights or spiritual moments?

Sometimes I wasn&#039;t sure if they were visuals or not, sometimes I was. I attribute this to the 25I tolerance I had going.<br /><br />No idea if there was taste on the blotter, I swallow mine like a pill with liquid.<br /><br />Took an hour before I knew for sure I was feeling it. 2 hours before I started to ascend the peak.<br /><br />peak was maybe a half hourish, but I still felt it strongly for hours afterwards. <br /><br />The trip was a solid 6 hours as prescribed, not including lingering effects.<br /><br />I did not sleep last night. But this could be related to the tiny, tiny bumps of meth I did the preceding couple mornings.<br /><br />Once again, I had a strong 25I tolerance going on, and did probably insignificant tiny bumps of meth a couple mornings leading up to the trip.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />No spiritual insights, or interesting thoughts. This was the clearest thinking trip I&#039;ve ever had. I sat in here writing bigass forums posts directly before and after the peak.<br />

				I have tried the Beatles tab this week too, and I have to say it&#039;s really great! I had trouble sleeping too, even after like 12hours of ingesting the tab. But it didn&#039;t matter cause I had a great time with the last visuals while laying in the dark :P<br /><br />
