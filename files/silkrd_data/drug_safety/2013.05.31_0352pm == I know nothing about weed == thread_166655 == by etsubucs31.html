				One of my best friend&#039;s birthdays is coming up in a couple of weeks and I wanted to buy him some good weed. As the title says, I have no knowledge about the different types. Does anyone have a recommendation? I&#039;m basically looking for something that is less common that he has hopefully never tried before. Also it would likely have to be US domestic since his Bday is so soon. Thanks for any suggestions!

				I myself don&#039;t like the taste, but amnezia haze is really strong. (but we&#039;re from the netherlands and the weed here is what is should be). I prefer jack herrer and santa maria.<br />Sorry but we&#039;re not from the US otherwise we could ship..

				If you want some good american weed I&#039;d recommend the &quot;classic&quot; blueberry, or blueberry variants like blueberry kush, blueberry haze. Purple Kush is also a very nice weed. Blueberry isn&#039;t so common anymore (it used to be really popular in the 90&#039;s) so your friend probably never had it but it&#039;s one of the best there is so if can have some on the road I say go for it! Amnesia haze is classic dutch strain and is also good, amnesia is good as well. But some haze strains tend to make unseasoned users paranoid, shaky, etc. <br />Don&#039;t take too much potent weed for your first time! Not a whole gram! I&#039;d say start with sharing a joint with 0.1g in it and if at the end of the joint you&#039;re still fine then you can take more. Too much weed isn&#039;t dangerous but it&#039;s not very pleasant so that&#039;s why I&#039;d start slow if you&#039;re planning on having a good time.<br /><br />If you want something really exotic there&#039;s a vendor called SealTeam6 that has some Hawaiian something something (I can&#039;t remember the name and it&#039;s not on his page), it&#039;s apparently really good, people that tried his old account liked it a lot but he bought a new account for some reason and has 0 sales. He was a good vendor on his previous account though. Maybe PM him asking him if he can send you just one or two grams... His weed is pretty cheap too. He&#039;s a weird vendor but well, I&#039;d give him a try if I bought my weed here.

				Heheh, 0.1grams of weed :p<br /><br />I feel sad for non dutchies. Prices for weed are so high.<br />We used to smoke 5 grams a day.. haze mix for 20 euros.<br /><br />Prices have raised a lot lately in the netherlands though.

				A lot of people aren&#039;t happy with sealteam6, he&#039;s a bit of a dick to his customers on the forums it seems.<br /><br />Are you planning on smoking some yourself or is it just for your friend? If so then I guess it being too strong for someone new isn&#039;t an issue if you&#039;re friend has smoked before.<br /><br />I have heard that this stuff is the shit, hence the price...<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1b6a36106e white rino

				Yeah SealTeam6 is a dick on the forums but nobody tried buying from him (because of that). He used to have happy customers for the same weed on his previous account though. I think he just bought a new account to troll and had enough money to do that.<br />And virmo, I was talking about weed as strong as dutch weed. If it&#039;s your first time, 0.2 grams of some dutch white widow or lemon haze or whatever strong weed, will make you way too high.. Lemon haze is such good weed though that even if you take too much, it doesn&#039;t feel bad, unlike with white widow (which is popular in holland but they don&#039;t feel so good, they&#039;re just really strong).<br /><br />And I wouldn&#039;t recommend white rhino either, those kind of strains make you way too high and if it&#039;s your first time or you&#039;re not used to weed, it&#039;s not gonna feel good at all. White rhino and white widow aren&#039;t very euphoric, they fuck you up in a strong way but they don&#039;t make you laugh or make you feel that good... That&#039;s just me though, some people like those. I still really recommend blueberry, it&#039;s for sale on the road. Or maybe sealteam6 will make you a cheap sample since nobody has bought from him... I think he&#039;d do that if you PM&#039;d him, but he&#039;s also a dick so I don&#039;t know, if you act nicely he&#039;s actually cool.

First time for dutchies is that high doses either dont work at all or they giggle a lot and other experienced users notice it works.<br />First time I smoked I smoke white widow, one joint with 1 gram, one pure joint and another 1 gram joint.<br />I did not notice anything until we had to meet some parents. I was sitting all the time and when standing up a friend told us we could get sober from jumping up and down. Which was a scam ofcourse and after that I could not resist giggling when meeting the parents :p<br /><br />Most people don&#039;t notice anything out here for their first times. I really wonder where you are from but we are responding to eachother in so many posts now.. perhaps you already mentioned it.<br /><br />We really want to ship amnezia haze but the smell is so intense.. vacuum sealing a bunch of times but then how to make it stealth?<br />Stupid question to ask cuz LE will be happy to reply.

				It&#039;s for his friend but he&#039;s also gonna smoke it, that&#039;s how I understood it at least. And I don&#039;t mean white widow is too strong, I mean it has too much side effects compared to good effects, other strong weed are just way more euphoric but they&#039;re more expensive. It&#039;s not really the strength per se but some strains only makes potheads feel good and will make non tolerant people paranoid and shaking. Other strains will make both groups feel good, and pothead also prefer the good stuff. <br /><br />It&#039;s true that the first time people don&#039;t feel anything usually, but I think it&#039;s because most people don&#039;t know how to smoke, at least in my experience. And also, you have to get high a few times to be truly affected by weed. It&#039;s kinda weird but you have to get your brain used to it. Honestly, 1 gram of dutch weed fucks me up real bad, unless I&#039;m sharing. I&#039;ve maybe had 1 gram of dutch weed in one single night with a very low tolerance and I was really stoned. It was good weed, not white widow which makes me super paranoid and gives me like spasms at higher doses. And I&#039;m from... everywhere maybe you can tell from my posts but probably can&#039;t, I don&#039;t really want to disclose that.<br /><br />To conceal the smell of weed, you have to use MBB, first vacuum seal it, then wash it with soapy water and then acetone, or isopropanol, then put on new latex gloves, because your old ones will smell like weed, and put the vacuum sealed weed in an MBB, heat seal that MBB, make sure no air can come out, check for bubbles in water, and wash it very thoroughly, also soapy water, and acetone or isopropanol. Don&#039;t use the same things to wash both layers! Change the water and use another piece of cotton to apply the alcohol or acetone. (sorry for hijacking the thread there)

				Go for anything with a fruity origin, ie, blueberry, blue dream, sour strains, purple strains. There are numerous resources on the clearnet that describe the taste and high of the strains. The best ones I have gotten off the road were granddaddy purp, which probably had the best high, and sour trainwreck, which was by far the best tasting strain I&#039;ve every had. It tasted like candy. I couldn&#039;t stop vaping it. Both were from humboldt&#039;s finest -- although I doubt you&#039;re looking to get a QP for your friend.
