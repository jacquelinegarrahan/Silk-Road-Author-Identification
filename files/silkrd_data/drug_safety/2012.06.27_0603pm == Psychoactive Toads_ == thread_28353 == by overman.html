				I&#039;d really like to know if anybody here has tried this, supposedly the&nbsp; Bufo alvarius toad secretes&nbsp; 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenin, which can be extracted and smoked or licked off the toad. Now is that is not the best thing you have ever heard of?

				It&#039;s the venom of Bufo Alviarus that contains the 5-Meo-DMT &amp; Bufotenine, its quite well known. You have to get them to &#039;spit&#039; venom onto a sheet of glass, dry &amp; scrape it off, licking them won&#039;t do it.<br /><br />A few years back BBB was selling them. They&#039;re a bit harder to get a hold of now (&amp; often confused with B Marianus I understand) but there&#039;s a lot of info out there on them.<br />Check out &#039;Tryptamine Palace&#039; by James Oroc as that talks about the, and 5-Meo-DMT, a good deal.

				Come to my house, those fuckers are always getting in my pool during monsoon season or when I irrigate. &gt;:( I believe they have a total of 5 glands that you can milk like you&#039;re popping a pimple to secrete the sweet goodness inside. Just be careful not to harm or kill them and you can milk them again in a few weeks time. ;)

				I had tenative plans to take a trip to toad country during monsoon season. I assume the area is pretty sketchy as it is a huge corridor for illegal immigration with a bunch of border patrol agents and Mexican cartels running amok. Bufotenine is scheduled class 1 I believe, so if LEO somehow find the venom on you it would be a felony. And to take the toads legally you need a fishing license.<br /><br />Monsoon season also happens to fall on one of the hottest times to be in toad territory. Heat stroke city.<br /><br />I figure with gas prices and the above stated risks combined, it would be far more lucrative to order some 5-meo off of SR. Thank goodness for SR!

				i have had frog venom before, it comes from Colorado River Toads (also called Sonoran Desert Toads) and i live pretty close to a where they are.&nbsp; when it rains you can go out and follow their distinct croak and find em by the hundreds.&nbsp; once you get em, they have like big glands on their legs, arms and necks, and you pinch em and squeeze em like a zit, really the first time i did it i was so worried i would hurt the toad, but he was cool with me, and anyway like a milky white substance that look like glue or jizz comes out, let that dry and smoke it up.&nbsp; it tastes like your are smoking death itself, but two puffs and welcome to the mindfuck!

				No, I&#039;m just following your logic that most drugs originate from men&#039;s asses. I put a smiley face in there for comic relief. I thought the idea of plugging toads was humorous. You&#039;re no fun.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />By all means, proceed.&nbsp; :-X

				Who&#039;s the one hating here? You&#039;re the one accusing me of being some sort of ass powder fiend and child-fucker for my alternate views on DMT extraction. I&#039;ve tried a local batch and it was shit, I didn&#039;t &quot;take off&quot; as you may put it. I&#039;d try the stuff again but I&#039;m a perfectionist and would rather make it myself. Fuck, I&#039;d gather up some toads for the hell of it if they were indigenous to my area. Which they aren&#039;t, so, from my point of view and geographical perspective milking toads isn&#039;t feasible. There might actually be some local plants and fauna that I could perform an extraction on, but there certainly aren&#039;t hallucinogenic toads.
