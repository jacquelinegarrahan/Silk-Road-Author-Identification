				No offense but if you haven&#039;t read the basic information on X you should wait. You are not ready. Go to erowid.com and check out experience reports. Read all you can of how this substance works and what you should do to make the best of your roll. Good luck!

				In a perfect world, nothing. The pills should just be a conveniently , happy looking way of taking mdma, rather then dealing with bags of foul tasting crystals etc.<br /><br />In reality pills can contain many contaminents as well as vastly different doses of MDMA, even between pills of the same type.<br /><br />Personally I prefer pills for clubs etc. just for ease of use, what could be easier then swallowing a small brightly coloured tablet eh?&nbsp; That being said its important you get them from a decent source and if possible try them before going mental in a club.<br /><br />Peace

Both can be full of adulterant (it&#039;s a common myth that powder Is pure MDMA and pills dirty; powder can be just as cut or fake as the pills). If you&#039;re buying from the SR, make sure you purchase from a trusted vendor with 100s of buyers confirming that it&#039;s actually MDMA, otherwise if it&#039;s just coming off the street, you need a marquis reagent test kit to confirm you&#039;re not getting meth or possibly something a lot more dangerous.<br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend caution with using using MDMA for the first time at a rave. For many, the come up and &quot;body load&quot; can be extremely overwhelming and cause you to have a panic attack, ruining your night. Do a test at home in a quiet, peaceful environment first. Just make sure to wait about a month between your uses, so if your rave is coming up immediately, you may want to reconsider using it at all. If you do though, take nothing more than a COMMON dose (100-120 mg is very standard) and do an allergy test (~20 mg) of it before the rave to make sure your body doesn&#039;t adversely react to it.<br /><br />Have fun and stay safe!

				All these pieces of advice saying you should check erowid, and research thoroughly before doing it are sound, but they do make me rofl a bit when I think about how me and my mates all took our first pills, at raves in 1989 with no real idea what they were or what they&#039;d do.<br /><br />Ecstasy is a pretty benign substance. It is good to do some research, but it is also good to just take a pill (or 150mg of crystal) and see what happens.<br /><br />Of course, back in 1989 there were no fake pills. Buy a reagent test, maybe.

				Let me correct myself. Okay man. <br /><br />Lots of people have had friends DIE. It&#039;s highly likely you won&#039;t. But it happens. Safety. <br /><br />BENIGN!?<br /><br />Are you fucking kidding me? Benign substances do not change the world. I may be wrong but I doubt it. <br /><br />

The severe adverse reaction incidence of MDMA is less than that of acetylsalicylic acid. That&#039;s right, simple Aspirin kills more people than MDMA. This myth of &quot;deadly&quot; MDMA has been perpetuated by governments and is based on bad data sets, e.g. the numbers include EVERY death where MDMA was found our mentioned without regard to the actual cause of death. (meaning, a guy rolling monday and getting hit by a bus on wednesday gets counted as MDMA-related death etc).<br /><br />Then there are relatively high numbers of multi-drug users included in statistics, and the few death cases that actually come back to MDMA are usually caused by hyperthermia or hyponatremia (meaning people cook their brain by massively overheating their bodies or breaking their brain with water poisoning because they drink too much water because they are paranoid about dehydration). Again, it wasn&#039;t the drug that killed them but being stupid.<br /><br />There is a very very minute fraction of the general population in western nations that is prone to getting serotonin syndrome even at small dosages, but again, that fraction is smaller than the fraction that will have a sever adverse reaction to aspirin.<br /><br />So, yes, long story short, MDMA is an extremely benign substance.

				Ecstasy didn&#039;t change the world you massive hippy! And I am someone who was there, at those first raves in England where we all thought it might do.<br /><br />It&#039;s benign compared to most other drugs I have ever taken.

				Nice one johnwholesome. You pull the stats out and get all scientific on his ass. I on the other hand just call him a massive hippy!<br /><br />Bottom line is, ecstasy is definitely a benign substance, relatively speaking of course.

				You&#039;re not telling me something I don&#039;t already know. I started going to parties when I was a teenager...(graduated in the mid 90&#039;s). As soon as I had the key to my car I was out. When I was coming up in the rave scene I knew a guy who died after he took his second dose. It was his 21st B-day so his friends were trying to get him to have a good time. He had never taken X before. Had energy drinks and who knows what else that day. Then he started drinking. Died. Not saying everyone fucking dies and it&#039;s the worst drug on the planet but don&#039;t you think a little caution is good. <br /><br />This is before a lot of the information was readily available...at least in my area. There was no fucking dancesafe.org.
