				Many people have mentioned it but seems that people always have some strict opinion in this matter. <br />If you have experienced with psychedelics quite enough then you should know that speed as a feeling is an important part of trip. Not always and not only through driving but speed as a glue for eternal light and time to become a great understanding inside you.<br />(Sorry if it&#039;s a bad explanation for you.)<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#039;m wondering does someone have taken up the habit to go driving while acid and if it&#039;s so, do you do something to do it safely?<br /><br />I like to ride a bike like an hour or two while peaking but in the future I hope to buy motorcycle and drive all my city streets through the night. Summer nights right before the dawn are great for their emptiness and silence. It&#039;s very beautiful and you should do it.<br />For safety I would drive only at nights and of course it depends how hard I&#039;m tripping. There&#039;s no way I would take the car and go for an ice cream (which is very good while coming down) when sun is shining and all the kids are coming home from their schools. Can&#039;t give a chance to hurt someone just for my own fun.

				as a fellow cyclist you should fucking know better, what the hell is wrong with you man? some of my favorite rides are at night, less traffic, less noise, and i don&#039;t know - it&#039;s just surreal. <br /><br />i made the mistake (when i was a teenager) of chugging like 4 oz&#039;s of shroom-laden honey (it was probably a 1/4-1/2 oz worth of fresh shrooms worth) and insisted on going to meet with a friend to smoke a joint. the only thing i remember on my way back to the shroom-shed (my buddies house) was i swore i was in star wars because it was raining out and my head lights / street lights reflecting off the rain drops made it look like i was traveling through hyperspace.<br /><br />granted, it was pretty cool - but man, if i could turn back the clock there are A LOT OF THINGS I wouldn&#039;t have done.

				the first thing you lose when you trip is depth perception, and that is precisely one of the main things you need when driving. If you do the math and gauge everyone Else&#039;s reaction, it is not a good idea.

				Dont mix two of the most wonderful things on earth. Biking and tripping.<br /><br />How about taking a few curves and later after sunset take your trip. So you can combine it but dont be dump and try to handle both.<br />maybe throw in some sex on your trip or smoke some DMT, hell its not only you on this planet.

				Are you nuts? Cid is a stronger drug than alcohol and I think anyone would be against you drunk driving, let alone driving under the influence of a stronger drug.<br /><br />If you really want that experience go to burning man and bring a bicycle. Night time bike ridding on acid at burning man is amazing!

				The beach or a park are nice places to be on acid or shrooms, but not driving a car. I biked home from college on acid. It felt great. Luckily I didn&#039;t crash or get hit. Didn&#039;t Hofmann trip while biking home? ;)<br /><br />I tried to drive home from my friend&#039;s house the first time I took LSD. That was really dumb. I forgot how to get home even though I drove that way at least a hundred times before. I sat and listened to music for a while and then it came back to me how to get home. That was a weird experience, but once I got home it turned into a good trip. I drove at least one other time during the day and it was easier than at night without the lights trailing by.

				Guys— it&#039;s not about &quot;what&#039;s stronger&quot; it&#039;s about how acid affects YOU. Know yourself. You know whether you can drive or bike on acid or not. Me personally, I get much *better* at driving, because I feel like I have greater sensitivity to all of the parts of the car, more alertness, and a faster and more artistic mind. I understand competitive driving really well, from the side of being in the driver&#039;s seat, and I don&#039;t hallucinate at all.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you are the type of person, who takes acid and can barely function either from it just being overwhelmingly beautiful, or it taking apart your mind, then maybe you shouldn&#039;t drive, eh?<br /><br />The question is not one of a generality, but one of a specificity.

				I was driving my friends in car while they were high on weed. I was sober and driving safe, but some of them were freaking out. On another occasion I was driving while high on weed, and there was that strange feeling that car is not functioning properly, I constantly checked lights and gauges. And I was so afraid of cops, so if I can spot some of them, I will probably bail out from my running car. It was safe anyway, because all that happened on rural roads.<br /><br />Reenacting Bicycle day is not bad idea. Replacing bicycle with motorbike sounds dangerous.

				Here you have it, motorcycles + lsd straight from the horse&#039;s mouth:<br /><br />&quot;The Edge... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others- the living- are those who pushed their luck as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there. Or maybe it&#039;s In. The association of motorcycles with LSD is no accident of publicity. They are both a means to an end, to the place of definitions&quot;<br />- Hunter S. Thompson, &#039;Hell&#039;s Angels&#039;
