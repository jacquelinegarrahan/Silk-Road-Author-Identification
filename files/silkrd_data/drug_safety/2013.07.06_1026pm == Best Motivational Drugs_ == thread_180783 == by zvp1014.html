				Hello all- I&#039;m a musician, but as of late I&#039;ve been feeling too much apathy/laziness to get myself into the studio and work.<br /><br />In the past, I&#039;ve found Amphetamine sulfate to be a great motivational tool. However, the comedown is very unpleasant. I&#039;d like something that I could do more regularly, hopefully with less danger of bodily harm.<br /><br />What are some good substances for getting yourself out of bed in the morning and giving you the kick to get things done? On the aforementioned Speed, my mind always repeats how it&#039;s gotta get things done, gotta get things done.. It&#039;d be nice to have similar feelings without such nasty comedown effects. Perhaps there&#039;s an XR ADHD drug that might be helpful?<br /><br />EDIT:<br />***********<br />While drugs like LSD and MDMA are fantastic creative tools (I make my best music on them!), they&#039;re not what I&#039;m looking for. I&#039;m looking for something that I can use regularly, that will give me the energy to get out of bed / leave my desk and head into my studio to work on some tunes. I&#039;m not looking to get fucked up and creative- Rather, I&#039;m looking for enough stimulation to make me want to begin/continue working on a piece.<br />***********

				For me, provigil (modafinil) works perfectly for this.&nbsp; For others, they find it too mild.&nbsp; Definitely wakes you up and makes you very alert, and the comedown is basically non-existent, especially compared to amphetamine salts.&nbsp; Look into it, it&#039;s actually more of a &quot;smart-drug&quot; than a stimulant.

				I&#039;m putting in another vote for modafinil. It&#039;s not speedy at all, has mild (if any) side-effects, and as long as you keep your dose fairly low &amp; take a few days off every so often you don&#039;t need to worry much about a tolerance. <br /><br />As hojasanta said it&#039;s more of a &quot;smart drug&quot; than a stimulant (you don&#039;t feel high/euphoric - just focused), but it def works beautifully for motivation &amp; work ethic so might be just what you&#039;re looking for.

				Thanks everybody for the great suggestions!<br /><br />Acid micro-dosing sounds way too risky to me. I don&#039;t have access to crystals or a liquid solution, and therefore couldn&#039;t properly dose tabs myself. I don&#039;t particularly trust the dosing of most vendors on here (even though I love their products) and fear accidentally getting fucked up on acid during a time when I need to keep my head straight.<br /><br />Modafinil seems like the winner. I like how it&#039;s also an appetite suppressant. Any SR vendor recommendations for it? Would Adrafinil be easier to acquire given how it&#039;s unscheduled, and does anybody have experience with it?

				&nbsp;;D Hey! I have personally found help with my motivation from these substances:<br /><br />~Psilocybe Mushies :D<br />~5-fur-144 (a.k.a XLR-11)---- Be careful with this one and Try to stay under 5Mgs because this is a synthetic cannabinoid that has no actual studies.<br />~LSD is perfect but have a trip sitter if you&#039;ve never taken it before (good starter dose imo is 150mics)<br />~DMT is great for opening your mind to all of the amazing potential life has to offer but for me it has more potential than many other psychedelics<br />~Ketamine is great if your problem with motivation lies in Depression. In retrospect, This can cause some problems with motivation if you misuse it.<br /><br />Please be safe out there OP and beware of stimulates 8)<br />
