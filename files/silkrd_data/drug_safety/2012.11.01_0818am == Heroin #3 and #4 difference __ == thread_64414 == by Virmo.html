				I am looking for hours now what the difference is.<br />Comes down to #3 = 60% heroin and 30% morphine and 10% caffeine or 5% caffeine and 5% ace something<br />Usually people smoke #3 with a crack pipe. It can not be snorted, or inserted into a pill?<br /><br />Heroin #4 is 90% heroin and 10% morphine. <br />This is usually used to IV, since there is less morphine in it (which isn&#039;t very well water solulablablable).<br />You can snort #4, but not smoke it?<br /><br />You can make #4 from #3 with some acid?<br /><br />I really want to know what the real difference is here. Which is better, and how?<br />I do not want to IV. I do not want to waste a lot of smoke.<br />Number 4 is more expensive. So what is now what and which will make you have a better effect? How many times can you smoke 1 gram of number 3, or snort number 4?<br />How many mg&#039;s if they are uncut? Can you also smoke number 4? Can you snort number 3?<br /><br />What is the difference? And how hard is it to make number 4 out of number 3? <br /><br />

				its definitely not accurate to strictly define the percentages of any street heroin <br /><br />you are also forgetting about the monoacetylated versions, 3-mam and 6-mam <br /><br />youre being too specific... the numbers refer to the steps in the synthesis<br /><br />#4 powder just refers to the salt version, and shouldnt be smoked because its combusts more than vaporizing<br />#4 tar can be smoked, actually contains more of the other alkaloids than actual diamorphine <br />#3 just refers to the freebase - which is often cut with caffeine to enhance vaporization (generally more like 50 percent irc) and can also be snorted due to acidic nasal membranes, although its generally not pure enough for very potent effects but costs less<br /><br />often smoke on foil, not a pipe <br /><br />the process to convert #3 into a soluble salt version is simple - you just add some citric or ascorbic while in the cooker <br /><br />you dont take H orally because its deacetylated and horrible bioavailability

				That was what I got from some forum.. Oh well it was nearly accurate.<br /><br />Too bad #4 is not good orally. I knew it would cost more, but I prefer pills (or smoking.. but smoking caffeine? blergh).<br />Nasally it will be then. <br /><br />Any suggestions on how many mg&#039;s of the nr# to snort? On erowid I read like 5mg&#039;s. I dont have a scale :( but will figure something out I guess...<br />How much #3 to smoke? 100mg&#039;s?<br /><br />Oh well, guess these questions are pointless while not asking for a generalised answer. It&#039;s never the same quality. Once again, thats why I prefer pills.. more accurate/easier to test (at least out here)...<br /><br />Thx for the input :)<br />

				dont know your tolerance so its impossible to know<br /><br />if you have no tolerance then start by snorting a match head sized bump and wait about thirty min then do another basically

				Hmm, either H is not meanth for me, or I overdosed.<br />With the snorting I started shaking/feeling really unwell.<br /><br />Smoking #3 is not a lot of fun either. Prefer to basecoke.<br /><br />With H I cant piss all os a sudden.<br />Usually once an hour, not, with h nothing in a day :S<br /><br /><br />
