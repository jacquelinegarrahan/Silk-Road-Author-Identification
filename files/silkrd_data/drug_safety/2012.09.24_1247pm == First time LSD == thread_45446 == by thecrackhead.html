				Hello everyone, I&#039;m not new to this world It&#039;s been few months since I found out about silk road.<br /><br />I&#039;m not new to drugs, I&#039;m smoking weed on daily basis, I did cocaine, mephedrone, ecstasy, MDMA, some mushrooms in Amsterdam, ketamine, salvia and probably other stuff which I can&#039;t recall.<br /><br />I have never tried LSD, It&#039;s hard to get it on the streets and you can&#039;t really trust random dealers. I did some research on effects and it seems amazing, now, my main concern is not to get really fucked up. I never had a bad trip before and I was always able to control myself no matter how much I took or for how long but i believe that with LSD is different as is kind of&nbsp; &quot;next level&quot;. What also bothers me is the fact that I might not take enough and the trip will be weak I never had strong visuals, I did hallucinate a bit from mushrooms but it wasn&#039;t what I expected.<br /><br />So, how much should I take considering that I don&#039;t want a weak trip and I also don&#039;t want an extremely fucked up trip. I think I should be able to manage a strong one.<br /><br />P.S. How many bottlers should I take one night and what would be a decent ug?<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<br /><br />

				My advice means squat really, but I would start with one blotter of whatever you end up getting. If it&#039;s rated strongly (i.e. over 200 ug) I&#039;d start with less. You can always take more, but never less, and re-dosing in the first 90 minutes should still be effective if you feel the need.<br /><br />At less than 200 ug the effects are usually subtle for me, no closed eye visuals and subtle open eye distortions, but the mental state is great and definitely well worth it. If you&#039;re hell bent on a strong trip aim for 200 - 400 ug. It can be intense for a newbie so you may want to be inside or even have a sitter.<br /><br />Personally I would go low first as you will be able to appreciate it more without shattering your world in one go, and can explore deeper on subsequent trips.

LSD is different from any drugs you have tried before,Salvia and shrooms too (I&#039;ve tried both). @ 100ugs you will feel something you can&#039;t really explain but your feet are still on this planet...very manageable,lot of laughs and shits. Of course it depend where you will try the acid,I always take it with friends in the middle of nature,I like to have trees and flowers around me while tripping hard.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Why not try 50ug first. If this is too low, next time 100ug...<br /><br />Take no big risks with this heavy stuff&nbsp; 8)

				As long as it isn&#039;t double-sided (i.e. 200ug) go for 2.&nbsp; I had 2 my first time and had a great night.&nbsp; I would recommend having a friend around for your first time just so you are in a good comfortable state of mind, I did a solo trip my first time and it had it&#039;s ups and downs.&nbsp; I never felt like I&#039;d lose control.<br /><br />That said if you&#039;ve done as much as you say acid really isn&#039;t that hard to handle, start low to get a feel for it.&nbsp; 2 tabs will not be hard to handle though unless they&#039;re double dosed, in which case just eat 1.

				I&#039;m considering taking Alllove&#039;s 200 micro sampler.&nbsp; I&#039;m a potential first time user but not sure if it&#039;ll be too intense for me or not.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done weed and salvia which sent me to another planet literally.&nbsp; First what I understand on acid, you can still be in relative control and be aware what&#039;s going on is fake and not real.&nbsp; Will this 200 microgram blotter be too intense for a first timer?&nbsp; Thanks guys.

				hey, I will use this thread for personal issue. I think I will have first LSD trip too (before I had probably DOx). Anyway, my aim is something similar like S. Grof mention in his book. how much acid I should take to experience stuff as Grof is mentioned? I mean &quot;being all one&quot;, &quot;birdth&quot;, and specially &quot;karma&quot; - things from my last life etc. I think something like 400 mic and more? I do not wanna take much more acid than I must, to experience these things.<br />(this is submitted easliy, I know that acid takes me where wants, but I want to have at least concept of how much I should take.)<br />thanks for responses.

My first LSD trip was with 50ug (half a tab) from the GFD blotter sold by FartBomber months ago and it was one of the most exciting and beautiful night of my life.<br /><br />In my opinion you should take the L from a reputable seller with a real or close to real dosage and staying under 100ug&nbsp; ;)<br />The salvia trip is very intense comparing to LSD but it will last for minutes...the acid will be in your head for hours,don&#039;t underestimate this!<br /><br />

				Just wanted to chime in, IMO, the best combo is Ketamine+LSD dose at approximately the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;That way, when the K is wearing off, the hallucinogen kicks in.&nbsp; &nbsp;The K has *mostly* worn off, but just enough left to get spacial distortions and visuals at the same time.&nbsp; In addition, there is an uplifting effect after coming down off of K, it&#039;s like Lube for your Brain.&nbsp; Much less body-load with the trip, its like cleaning out the house for a party!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; Just my opinion, I&#039;ve done just about everything, and this is my pick.&nbsp; We did this a lot when I was really into LSD in my late teenage years.&nbsp; We would break into a health club and swim in their pool after this combo(not recommended), and would mix it with methylphenidate, too.&nbsp; Try it, you&#039;ll like it.<br />
