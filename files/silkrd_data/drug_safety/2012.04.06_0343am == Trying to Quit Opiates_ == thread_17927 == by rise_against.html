				i was addicted to oxycontin for about three years and went to a shrink that specialized in substance abuse recovery and he forbade me to take xanax because of my obvious addictive personality and its high potential for abuse. <br /><br />Taper off over a long enough period to ease the withdrawal. I also used naltrexone and loads of the supplement L-tyrosine. It works wonders for opiate withdrawals and is even cited in medical papers now. You might also consider heading to Narcotics Anonymous meeting.<br /><br />Being addicted to pain pills is really a waste of time and money so try not to get hooked in the first place. After a few months of regular use you&#039;re no longer getting high or having fun being on them but just taking them to feel normal. <br /><br />

				Weed helps me... Greatly.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say I quit, but Ive had hundreds of dollars on me for the past few days and no drugs. Well, at least not opiates. <br /><br />It is really all about getting motivated to quit. While you are still new to the habit you really don&#039;t stand much chance of quitting. It grabs you and takes you where you don&#039;t want to go, often. What one has to come to grips with is the fact, shit, Im bleeding hundred dollar bills here (or commiting felonies if you are fortunate enough not to have a large savings to waste) just to get a 2-3 minute rush off of 120 mg... Definatly not worth it.

				Honestly, the only things that helped me quit were weed and an ultimatum given to me by my other half. That and my increasing tolerance. I know for a lot of people an ultimatum wouldn&#039;t really do much though.
