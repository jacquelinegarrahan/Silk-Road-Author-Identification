The vendor has written a disclaimer below the product and admits that its a potentially dangerous product therefore only small amounts are sold.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s inherently dangerous. I frequently do a mix of IV heroin and methylone, which I mix myself. I put 10mg of heroin with 80mg of methylone, and it feels verrrrry nice. I suspect that MDMA + Heroin would be a little too intense, thought. What bothers me about that listing is he doesn&#039;t include any info on how much of each drug is in that .3 grams, which I think would make it easy to OD on one or the other, depending on the ratio of MDMA to heroin.
