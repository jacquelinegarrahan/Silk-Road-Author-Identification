				Ladies and gentlemen, I am going out of town on vcation this week to a local beach and plan on having a little fun. Has anybody ever tried a combination of MDMA and Nbome? Did they ever mix it up and add shrooms?<br />Me and my girl have 2 red Mortal Combats, a shitload of 25i, and enough shrooms to get me anywhere I want to. I plan on placing a half of a 1mg 25i tab in my lip and swallowing half of the 220mg MDMA pill at the same time. IS there any partricular order/timeframe I should do this in? I have done MDMA,LSD,shrooms,weed,M1 and Nbome before but never combined anything unless it was with weed. Im good at containing myself while tripping and am 160-165lbs.

				I would probably follow my normal rule when it comes to mixing psychedelics and mdma, which is to take the psychedelic first, make sure you are comfortable with it, then take the mdma.<br /><br />At least that&#039;s how I do it.

				I have tried MDMA + 25i, nothing special, I actually felt out of it.&nbsp; I thought it was going to be a lot better.&nbsp; MDMA + Shrooms or MDMA + cid provides a lot more euphoria and visuals.&nbsp;

				Maybe you&#039;ve already done this and it&#039;s too late but hey, I wouldn&#039;t. MDMA is pretty stimulating, and the NBOMes are also pretty stimulating AND vasoconstricting so I personally wouldn&#039;t combine the two. I&#039;m very healthy and all the times that I&#039;ve done an NBOMe my extremities got super cold and I was worried about my toes going blue or having a stroke from my blood pressure being so high etc.<br /><br />Just fucking get some LSD, dude, you know what site you are on right?

				I&#039;ve mixed both mushrooms+25i and mushrooms+MDMA.<br /><br />Both were very enjoyable experiences for me.<br /><br />I think as long you are comfortable with the doses it should be a fantastic time.

Just because you take MDMA, doesn&#039;t necessarily mean you&#039;re going to have a good time. I&#039;ve experienced some negative trips even when candy-flipping. You have to make sure you&#039;re only taking a small amount of both, as they tend to amplify each other&#039;s effects. For a good double-helix of tripping and rolling, ensure you&#039;re dosing at least 1/2 or 2/3 of what you normally would without mixing them. Trust me.<br /><br />But if you had&nbsp; lots of K, you could overdose on both and still have a nice time.

				One time I did a bunch of MDMA and It completely killed the trip off of an eigth of some extremely good mushrooms, weirdest thing ever, I was still more fucked up than just on ecstacy but it was more like a nice ass epill, like MDMA cut with another drug fucking me up(psilocybin =p) But the tripping disintigrated completely and I was just high on drugs lol

Better to just do small amounts of both, or keep it simple - one or the other.
