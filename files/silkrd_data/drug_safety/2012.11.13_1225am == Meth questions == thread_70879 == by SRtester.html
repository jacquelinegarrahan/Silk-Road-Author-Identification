				I used to do quite a bit, but after many years hiatus I&#039;m dabbling again. I&#039;m a bit off my game because after a weekend of use, I only had an &quot;average&quot; experience.&nbsp; Any meth experts willing to help me out here?<br /><br />Second-hand smoke:<br />Can this affect other people in the room? Would they feel any effects, positive or adverse? Especially concerned about someone I know with a heart condition.<br /><br />Cleaning the pipe:<br />My glass pipe, after a weekend of only smoking maybe .5, the entire bulb and stem are caked in snow-white residue. Is this stuff reusable, and how do I make use of it, or clean it out?<br /><br />Smoking:<br />a. Is it better to smoke chunks or powder? The hole is so damn tiny it&#039;s hard to put any sizable crystals in the bulb.<br /><br />b. Do you start sucking as soon as the vapor forms in the bulb, or wait till it fills up a bit?<br /><br />c. Hold it in, or blow it out right away?<br /><br />Snorting:<br />a. What&#039;s the best way to crush that shit up super fine (with household items).<br /><br />b. What&#039;s best: bumps, short lines, rails, etc.?<br /><br />c. Keep it up in the nose awhile, or suck it back right away?<br /><br />Smoking/snorting in the same session:<br />Do these counteract each other? Or enhance things?<br /><br />Coming down:<br />Advice on how to handle mood changes when the drug wears off? It&#039;s sudden and uncomfortable. The obvious answer is to redose, but are there any mental tricks that might help bring my spirits back up? FYI- I have benzos to use when I know I&#039;m done for the night.<br /><br />Thanks everyone.

				As for second-hand smoke, I&#039;d be absolutely amazed if there had been credible studies done.&nbsp; So any answer you get is going to be just as anecdotal as my own: not unless the person has an allergy or is hypersensitive to amphetamines for whatever quirky reason of biology.&nbsp; It is definitely a concern though, because you will get minute amounts of amphetamine getting in to your blood from second hand smoke... so to be safe, I&#039;d say air the place out before your second party will be in there.&nbsp; Not sure if you mean blowing it in the person&#039;s face, or just having them walk through an hour after you&#039;re finished getting your high on.<br /><br />Cleaning the pipe: I have no idea.&nbsp; I always smoke it when I&#039;m out, desperate, and need to stay awake long enough to get *something* done.&nbsp; It never seems to do much, but it does make me feel like I can stay awake more than 30 minutes.&nbsp; Whether that&#039;s psychological or not I dunno, but it&#039;s not really fun and doesn&#039;t feel good, so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it&#039;s just cut with a very small proportion of residual meth.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t matter what you smoke.&nbsp; It&#039;ll all melt together once you start vaping it anyway.<br /><br />I try to make sure all the smoke gets in me.&nbsp; I think some people blow off the smoke that they get before it melts and recrystallizes.&nbsp; Presumably because they think it&#039;s pure cut.&nbsp; I really can&#039;t say.&nbsp; Probably healthiest, since at worst you&#039;re only losing an equal amount of meth smoke and at best not polluting yourself any further than necessary.<br /><br />Hold it in as long as it&#039;s comfortable, but don&#039;t bother gasping for air over it or anything.&nbsp; Your lungs don&#039;t actually &quot;suck in&quot; the stuff you get through your lungs.&nbsp; They&#039;re a very thin layer, and your blood kind of attracts &amp; traps stuff and whisks it away as it pumps through them.&nbsp; So if you blow out a ton of smoke, chances are you just blew out a ton of your meth that didn&#039;t make contact with your lungs, and you aren&#039;t going to have much luck sucking it back up to try again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t snort it.&nbsp; At all.&nbsp; Don&#039;t snort anything, really, so I&#039;ll let somebody who knows what they&#039;re talking about there field that one.<br /><br />As for the come down... having a partner to give a hug to always helps me.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier to ignore the bleak, dismal, sometimes almost suicidal feelings when I remember how lucky I really am in so many ways and how much I have to be thankful for.&nbsp; And that it&#039;s okay.&nbsp; That it&#039;s just a shitty feeling I have to deal with, but it&#039;ll be better soon.

				Oh, I feel compelled to mention that I&#039;ve seen at least one researcher whose findings actually seemed extremely credible to me who said, the largest factor in addiction is not how fast it comes on, but how fast it goes away.&nbsp; Which actually seems to ring at least somewhat true if you think of the major drugs of compulsive addiction.&nbsp; Not all of them, obviously (alcohol sure as Hell doesn&#039;t, but you do kind of fucking crash all of a sudden when you&#039;re *really* sober, so maybe it works there too).<br /><br />Point being, smoking it is a bad idea.&nbsp; I actually try not to, but it always ends up happening at least some.&nbsp; I try to swallow it mostly.

				Make sure you scrape your entire pipe. The white fuzzy things in there are actually crystals developing, and are good to smoke when you&#039;re out.
