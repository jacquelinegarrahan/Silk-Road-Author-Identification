				I usually only buy mushrooms (3.5 gram bags) at festivals and such from people I just come across. If I want to trip all-out I usually just eat the whole damn thing. I don&#039;t know if the product at these types of places is as hardcore as what Rocker&#039;s got. I need to know so I can prep for the nye bash. Advice? I don&#039;t want to turn the party into a god damn nightmare.

				IF you are an experienced tripper, I don&#039;t see any reason why an eighth would be too much. I&#039;ve taken many 2gram doses of good, bad, and fantastic shrooms, and also taken many 5+gram doses on great shrooms.<br /><br />It all comes down to YOU. Don&#039;t let this guy tell you what you can and can&#039;t handle, and don&#039;t let me either. But if that is your regular dosage, I dont believe that any batch (unless it is a different, more potent strain) would be so much stronger as you give you a problem.<br /><br />Shroom on, my friend.

Average sized guy, how many grams ya think? I like to go all the way,but dont wanna be pukin or drowning in a puddle or anything,haha.

				Holy cow, I hope Koala came back with his mind in one piece!<br /><br />DON&#039;T DO A FULL EIGHTH of Rocker&#039;s shrooms unless you absolutely know what you&#039;re doing. The only shroom experiences I&#039;ve had is with Rocker&#039;s stuff, and 1.5g for me triggers plenty of open-eye visuals and slight aural/visual synesthesia. I know that I would not be ready to deal with social situations, but ultimately it&#039;s up to you and how experienced you are. 3.5g of Rocker&#039;s stuff would probably make me puke and drown in a puddle, hahahaha.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t done shrooms&nbsp; before, and you&#039;re looking into Rocker&#039;s goods, I&#039;d shoot for 1.5g if it&#039;s your first time. Grind it up in a coffee grinder, throw the ground shrooms into a mug, and pour near-boiling water into it, like a tea. Makes it hit faster and shortens the trip from what I&#039;ve heard, but it&#039;ll also reduce indigestion/nausea. Good luck and have fun!

				Wonderful shrooms, I hope you enjoy.<br /><br />As many are saying, it comes down to experience and what you can handle personally. If you are worried about nausea I would also recommend making a tea (Rocker&#039;s review thread has a recipe) or just be sure to crush up the shrooms finely.<br /><br />My experience with Rocker&#039;s shrooms:<br />2g of the shrooms you can have a decent trip and still be functional. I felt the trip lacked a certain fullness though. Good for a free afternoon imo, maybe a walk through nature.<br /><br />3g definitely increases time dilation and for me set in for a full trip and I was on the ride. Some confusion (trying to select music, use remotes, etc), but conversation didn&#039;t seem to take a hit. When I&#039;m alone however, the 3g dose becomes very internal and I get lost in thoughts quickly.<br /><br />4g seemed to have much clearer visuals and thrashed my depth perception for most of the trip. Slight nausea, subsided after ~45 minutes. Mostly the same effects as 3g except the euphoria was greater and my thoughts and CEV&#039;s were much deeper, with CEV&#039;s bleeding into my open eye vision at times.<br /><br />5g Had nausea on the come up, but it subsided once the trip hit hard. Became non-functional pretty quick and I did get sick at the end of the trip but it was very relieving. I felt my mind was mushrooming up and puking, leaving me incredibly clear headed with AMAZING visuals after I thought they were over with. The puke was probably quarter sized, which is what caused me to think it was mental. Overall they were great shrooms even up to 5g which at times can get very heavy for me. However, if you haven&#039;t tried 5g before I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend it with Rocker&#039;s yet. They are quite potent.

				Now I&#039;m even more torn.. somewhere between 1.5 and 5 grams,lol&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;I like to go all out,dedicate time to the event, and not waste my product on test runs or mild experiences. I&#039;m worried about nausea since I have stomach sensitivities..<br /><br />Is this a good strain to step-stack? Maybe start at 2 grams and see how I feel in an hour? Or would a gram or so extra at the later time just be a wasted gram?&nbsp; I have a lot to learn about shrooms&nbsp; :D

I should mention that I&#039;m 5&#039;10&quot;, 150 lbs (68 kg), and as I mentioned before, 1.5g was enough for open-eye visual distortion, light closed-eye visuals, weird depth-perception, difficulty in conversation, light aural/visual synesthesia, and time dilation during the peak of the trip. I wouldn&#039;t consider that a very light trip, but that&#039;s just my experience and that&#039;s how dosages work for me. <br /><br />Whatever the case, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be disappointed with a 2g dose.

				You can always take MORE after an initial dose, you can&#039;t take LESS after its in you though.<br /><br />Can&#039;t you just take a smaller dose, and if you plateau lower than you want, take more?

Psychedelics usually take 1-2hrs for me to feel ANY effects, whereas some fellow trippers will feel effects within 45min. But starting at 2g and working your way up sounds like the best idea. Happy tripping :)

I still get stomach cramps at the end of a mushroom tea session, so I can only imagine how uncomfortable it&#039;ll be if I chomped on whole dried ones.

				I suggest you have a sober sitter with you during the journey. Of course the set and setting is the most important aspect. Be safe and make sure you know it is beforehand.<br /><br />With that said, the sacred mushrooms have a whole different dimension at the higher doses. With the proper set and setting and a loving sitter to be the buffer between you and the outside world... a dose of 4-5 grams can be enlightening.<br /><br />Peace and love to you on your journey.
