				I assume it&#039;s not the best idea for the feint of heart (har har), but I figure I should ask anyways:<br /><br />Can you mix Viagra and ecstacy? Will it kill you? Does it depend on the ecstacy (like, say, could I use it with MDA but not MDMA)? Does it depend on if I&#039;m a healthy individual? <br /><br />I tried to search for an answer, but I&#039;m apparently too inept to actually find an answer myself.<br /><br />EDIT: I guess I&#039;ll also ask about mxe, while I&#039;m here: can it be mixed with ecstacy? Or viagra, for that matter.

				As ever, Erowid is your friend:&nbsp; <br />[CLEARNET:]&nbsp; https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Sildenafil.shtml<br /><br />The short answer is it&#039;s not a recommended combo, especially if you might have any cardiovascular issues, but plenty of guys have done it (in moderation at least) and lived to tell the tale. I did it once, and my gf said never again...it was simply too much and left her very sore.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;d say most guys struggle to perform adequately on E, but there are always lucky exceptions, and they tend to give a misleading impression... Perhaps you just need to find a better combo rather than force anything? I&#039;m looking forward to trying some &quot;Moxy&quot; very soon (5-Meo-Mipt) as it&#039;s basically described as &quot;MDMA for lovers&quot; ;-))<br /><br />You don&#039;t say how old you are, but you should be aware that anecdotally at least, younger healthy men who use viagra on a regular basis can begin to experience ED when not taking it. The body has weird ways of letting you know it&#039;s annoyed with your behaviour...<br /><br />Also worth thinking about is where you go after you&#039;ve had the wildest most loved-up sex imaginable, fuelled by whatever crazy combo. Plain old vanilla sex can start to seem unappetizing, and this can lead to issues of another kind. Personally, mephedrone was the wildest sex drug I ever tried. Used to call it &quot;dirty coke&quot;, which it kind of is, but the sex was wild, uninhibited, and completely without problems! Unlike e.g. real coke... However, meph consumes you eventually, so again, best as an occasional treat.<br /><br />MXE on the other hand, lovely stuff! Have used it lots (insufflated) with all sorts of things, and never any issues. Swallowed some once (by accident) and that wasn&#039;t too good, left me seriously monged out for a few hours. Just remember that it has a long half-life (about 4 hours back to baseline) so don&#039;t stack it too quickly or you can find yourself in a strange place. Seems to be about neutral for sex for me, not especially horned up, but not incapable either.<br /><br />Have fun, be safe, and make videos!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I just had to sit down because standing up made me dizzy and panicky.<br />I know that it does put a lot of pressure on your heart too, so definitely not a healthy decision. <br /><br />If you want to try it, I would at least suggest taking half a viagra, not the whole thing

I just have to put up with the anti-sexual side effects of amphetamine / MDMA.<br /><br />But it&#039;s up to you mate - If you try it, probably start off with a half a viagra.

				I&#039;ve taken viagra with MDMA...no problems. I definitely enjoyed the sex on it, but honestly I enjoy the touch/snuggling just as much. It&#039;s fun to try once or twice, or if you get two chicks it&#039;s certainly worth a run, but<br /><br />If you are young and in good health and don&#039;t have a heart condition and/or take any blood pressure meds, don&#039;t worry about it.

				<br />I pop a V prob 75% of my rolls. I too read a lot and was worried. But started low and experimented. I now will take 50mg in the beginning and another 50mg (usually not needed)&nbsp; towards then end. Personally never had probs-but everyone is different. Take it slow if you do.

				2nd or 3rd time rolling with my ex gf, I popped a viagra and then a roll with her about 30 minutes later.&nbsp; We started to hook up and started having sex.&nbsp; It seems as soon as the ecstasy kicks in no matter what phase you last much much longer.&nbsp; Granted we had hard core sex for a good hour and as soon as we were done we started peaking.&nbsp; Talk about good timing and a fun fun night.&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;ve done it once and it wasn&#039;t bad, although I only took half of a viagra so I don&#039;t think it was enough, I was still having trouble keeping it up.<br /><br />As someone above suggested, Moxy, 5-meo-mipt, is the perfect drug if you want to roll and have sex. Its slightly psychedelic, but the roll from it and the sexual boost is amazing. I have never had a better orgasm than my first time having sex on Moxy. Not to mention, its cheap and easily sourced.
