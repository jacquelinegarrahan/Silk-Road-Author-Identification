				I have a friend with ADHD (I believe) who has quite a stash of ritalin at home he has been given which he hasn&#039;t got around to taking. I was wondering if anyone has any experiences of using the drug (for recreational use not study) they could share to help me make up my mind if there is any value in trying it. <br /><br />Cheers!

				I once crushed up 2 pills of 10 mg each and snorted them, besides keeping me awake it didn&#039;t really do much for me, the dosage was quite low but the recreational value of Methylphenidate(Ritalin) seems to be quite weak compared to Amphetamine (Adderalll)

				IME Ritalin is a nasty drug when used recreationaly, unexpectedly it has the worst WD&#039;s than Adderall, Dexedrine or any of the other script pill.<br />Not only that, the euphoria is weaker at least for me - shorter.<br /><br />Not sure why you would wanna abuse that drug, but if you must, chose another upper (adderall being the most euphoric).<br />If you want a &quot;cleaner&quot; high and more focus-like drug then go with Dexedrine/Vyvanse.&nbsp;

				Ritalin works quite differently than amphetamines. It inhibits the reuptake of norepinepherine and dopamine. Its mechanism of action is more similar to cocaine than amphetamines. Amphetamines release dopamine while methylphenidate only inhibits there reuptake.<br /><br />Alot of people don&#039;t really like racemic methylphenidate, however some people like the D isomer of methylphenidate (dexmethylphenidate) ie: focalin and find it a lot cleaner.

				Its a good one to study because it makes you focus. Done it myself. Not so much for recreational use.

				As others here have said, Ritalin is not much fun as a recreational drug.&nbsp; The &quot;high&quot; you get isn&#039;t fun; it&#039;s just productive.&nbsp; Like, you&#039;re not gonna take it and then wanna go out dancing.&nbsp; You&#039;re gonna end up spending the night frantically cleaning and organizing your home.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like many people, I used to use Ritalin in college, whenever I had an entire paper to write in one night, or anytime else I was behind on my work and had a deadline.&nbsp; It was incredible.&nbsp; I could work for over 6 hours straight, no breaks, and at the end, the paper wouldn&#039;t just be done, it&#039;d be GOOD.<br /><br />But it also made me very nervous and jittery and irritable.&nbsp; There&#039;s no euphoria, and no desire to socialize, like there is with coke or meth.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t make me feel GOOD.&nbsp; It just helped me do what I needed to do.<br /><br />It&#039;s really not a party drug at all.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a useful tool to have around in case you have a lot of stuff to do in a short amount of time.&nbsp;

				after reading that ritalin molecule is similar to cocaine i&#039;ve tried some ritalin.<br /><br />ritalin is actually considered stronger stimulant than cocaine and acts much longer.<br /><br />anyways, in my personal experience snorting about 4x10mg crashed pills gives nice effect, more is to much buzz.<br /><br />maybe try 10mg first, wait an hour, see if you like it.<br /><br />good thing about ritalin vs cocaine is there are no poisonous&nbsp; cuts, it&#039;s clean medical pill (unless fake of course)
