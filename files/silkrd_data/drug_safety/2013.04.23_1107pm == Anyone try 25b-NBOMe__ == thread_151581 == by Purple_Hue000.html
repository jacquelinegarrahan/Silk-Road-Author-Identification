				What&#039;s your experience with 25B? I got some 1mg tabs but I&#039;m just waiting for my tolerance to go down before trying them. In the meantime I&#039;ve been doing extensive reading and research on most of what I can find about 25b before asking questions.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Will 1mg (one blotter) of 25b be enough for a good trip? 1mg tabs (one at a time) of 25i never affected me much.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is 25B anything like 2C-B? <br /><br />What can I expect out of an 25B experience?

				<br />Ive have some 25b. Only tried a half hit once just for the heck of it. IT WAS STRONG. NBOMe&#039;s are better to me than the bee&#039;s anyways. I will try 25d when I have time. I have played with the C and I many times at many doses and love them.

				&nbsp;Yes one tab should be fine if it was laid properly. Which vendor did you choose for your tabs? <br /><br />Personally 25b-nbome is my favorite out of the 25 series I highly recommend them.&nbsp; I have found that mixing 25-b with some 25i is the best way to go. I found that the b&#039;s give nice visuals and the I&#039;s provide euphoria.<br /><br />I love ENB00M&#039;s tabs personally because of how even laid they are. It&#039;s a shame they haven&#039;t got more 25b&#039;s in stock. That&#039;s the only nbome i&#039;ll buy nowadays honestly. <br /><br />I have found the nbome&#039;s to be jittery on the comedown. Benzoids are nice for wanting to sleep afterwards. You going to type up a experience (Trip)&nbsp; report? (We need more of trip reports here on the threads)<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve enjoyed 25i, and found it potentiates amazingly with weed.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m interested in 25b, as the &quot;speedy&quot; effects of 25i usually leave me somewhat fatigued and it has a weird, not-entirely-unpleasant hangover that just leaves your brain feeling &quot;fried&quot;, but almost in a comfortably cooked way.

				I got my 25b tabs from lightflower. Mostly because the really cheap pricing compared to other vendor&#039;s NBOMe. Does 25B give off strong euphoria or any kind of euphoria at all? How long does 25b usually last? once my tolerance goes down then I&#039;ll pop a tab and see what happens. I have four hits dosed at 1mg each. <br />I&#039;ve never tried 2C-B yet but I&#039;m curious and the closest thing I got to that is 2C-B-NBOMe.
