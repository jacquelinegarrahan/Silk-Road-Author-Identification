				Hello All,<br /><br />Excuse my ignorance but what is the attraction of using Addrall over &quot;illegal&quot; speed?<br /><br />I get it might be from a pharmacy but surely there has to be more to it then that? Its seems to expensive...<br /><br />I ask because I want to try some partly because I cant work out why it is so expensive.<br /><br />Look forward to peoples comments.<br /><br />Dicko

Which breaks down to 50% levero-amphetamine and 50% dextro-amphetamine. <br /><br />Dextro controls the mind high, levro the body. Levro is what most people consider to bring the side effects. <br /><br />Adderall is a mix of amphetamine salts that come out at 75% dextro, and 25% levro. <br /><br />That is it&#039;s made by pharmaceutical companies, make people consider that it&#039;s a cleaner drug altogether.<br /><br />Personally, I think a-phet is a dirty drug. Some people can manage the come-down from it but it just ruins me. <br /><br />If you are referring to speed as, &#039;Ice&#039; or &#039;Meth&#039;, well that is methamphetamine and that is a different drug.

				<br />Addies are for the rich. powders are for the poor. <br /><br />but <br /><br />Skip the amphet for party. not really worth it. <br />Its good for clearing out your eyes after a good smoke session or to help you win a drinking contest. ( harder to get shitfaced) or to dance all night(im loving this part)<br />But ! it will make you impotent. That can ruin the night. <br />You get more talkative, friendly, sharp, you will dance like a champ, ladies will be all over and no boner. Nothing. <br /><br />

				Adderall, unlike speed, can&#039;t be cut with various random white substances.<br />This is the main advantage imo, as my area is notorious for dirty powders.&nbsp; Also, adderall is available in extended release, which can unleash a frenzied 12 hour study session leading to high scores for us college kids :)

				it still blows my mind to see people paying 10-20$ per pill(depending on mg&#039;s) on SR when you can buy them for $5 or less on the streets.

				Do you know for certain what is in those pills on the streets though? Is there anyone to complain, name and shame if they turn out to contain something else like meth?<br /><br />The feedback system here ensures weeding out people selling drugs under the wrong description quite rapidly, while a&nbsp; street dealer has little to loose as you&#039;ll probably never encounter that person again, let alone get a chance to inform his other/future clients that they are being ripped off. <br /><br />

				Oh, in case its killing selling off their ADHD meds to make some pocket money you are probably good. <br /><br />Telling fakes from real is very difficult with most big pharma products too, but if its just some kid selling off a weeks dose of the stuff including the box and leaflet, i&#039;d be inclided to assume it&#039;s legit... faking all that would be too much effort for the noney fetched ;)
