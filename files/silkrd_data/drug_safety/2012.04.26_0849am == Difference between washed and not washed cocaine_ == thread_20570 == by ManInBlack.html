				What is the difference between washed and not washed cocaine? Is one cleaner than the other? Does it increase potency? Better tasting? I just can&#039;t quite grasp what is beneficial to washing your cocaine. Any help is appreciated. I&#039;m trying to get as informed as possible before I go spending thousands of dollars on what I don&#039;t want. I didn&#039;t see a thread like this one so I created one so it&#039;s easier for someone else to find this answer as well.<br /><br />-MIB

				Ok mate &quot;Washing&quot; is the same principle for any drug. It washes out the left over by products and purifies your product and leaves only (in this case) the Cocaine molecule left. It will make the product whiter, smell less and it will be a purer cocaine experience. <br /><br />Washing a drug can be a double edged sword. If you are selling to fuck-tards who only understand how to identify quality through silly shit like &quot;smell, look&quot; etc washing can put people off. For example I sell washed Mephedrone which means it has almost no residual Bromine left in it (Bromine is used in the synth). The Bromine that is left over in Drone gives it a speedy effect and strong fishy smell but also has some dirty residual effect like it makes your sweat grimy and smelly and it&#039;s also fucking lethal for your heart. Washed Drone like I have is less speedy but more euphoric which is how the product SHOULD be and it&#039;s better for your health/heart and makes you smell like shit less. However having a washed product means you have reduced the final yield so washed is more expensive by weight because it is purer and cleaner. The Chinese just left the Bromine in back in the day because it nets you a fuck of a lot more profit per kilo than having it washed out.<br /><br />It all comes down to personal preference but having a washed product like Bing should have less issues than selling washed drone. You may have to look out for the idiots who judge Bing on the diesel smell though. <br /><br />You got anymore questions just PM me and I can explain it a bit more.

				Mine is pre ban drone but it&#039;s not how the Chinese used to make it with the Bromine left in. Mine has the bromine washed out which means it&#039;s more euphoric and better for your heart but isn&#039;t quite as speedy as the Chinese product.<br /><br />The Chinese left the bromine in because it&#039;s a bi-product of the synthesis and basically washing it out brings the yield down and as I said the bromine being left in gives it a more speedy rush than euphoria. It&#039;s also what makes it proper tweaky and compulsive to re-dose. Mine is still stimulating but it leans towards a more MDMA feel rather than a speedy feel and is less tweaky. Also you get less dirty drone sweat from mine. <br /><br />I will be getting the Chinese version made soon too because I wanted to cater for both preferences.<br /><br />

				I would just like to add that whenever (unless especially mentioned) you are reading about health consequences (mechanisms or such) in the literature, know that it&#039;s about pure compounds. I&#039;ve had too many debates that turned into fights with people snorting &quot;5th hand cocaine&quot; and telling me that studies say that &quot;it&#039;s not so bad&quot;. Maybe but they had cocaine mate, you have cut white powder that contains who the fuck knows what.<br /><br />As far as I know &quot;Washed&quot; is actually a translation of the spanish word &quot;lavado&quot; which used to indicate cocaine that the cartels additional purified/&quot;washed&quot; in their labs. The actual procedure is unknown to me, recrystallization is a guess.<br /><br />I would be careful about blindly trusting a vendor about this issue and since you&#039;re buying cocaine there is always levamisole (search is your friend, if you are unfamiliar with the substance) to watch out for. A quick abstract from Larocque &amp; Hoffman (2012)<br /><br />&quot;Levamisole is a pharmaceutical with anthelminthic and immunomodulatory properties that was previously used in both animals and <br />humans to treat inflammatory conditions and cancer. Levamisole has been identified as a cocaine adulterant in the United States since <br />2003. By 2009, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated that 69% of the cocaine seized contained levamisole. <br />The first case reports of complications related to levamisole in cocaine users were published in 2009. The objectives of this article are <br />to review the literature regarding the full spectrum of possible complications related to levamisole use for medical purposes, to review <br />the current scope of levamisole-induced complications in cocaine users and to discuss the pharmacological properties that might explain <br />the motivation behind the large-scale adulteration of cocaine with levamisole. Literature review revealed that significant complications <br />were quickly reported when levamisole was used in inflammatory conditions. By 1976, several cases of leukopenia and agranulocytosis <br />were reported. Recurrence with re-exposure was well described and agranulocytosis spontaneously reversed upon discontinuation of <br />therapy. Vasculitis secondary to levamisole treatment was i rst reported in 1978 and mostly manifests as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, <br />cutaneous necrotising vasculitis and thrombotic vasculopathy without vasculitis. These findings typically, but not invariably, involve the <br />ear lobes. Discontinuation of levamisole therapy was again a critical part of the treatment. Various neurological side effects were described <br />with levamisole therapy, the most concerning complication being multifocal inl ammatory leukoencephalopathy (MIL). Literature <br />review identii ed 203 unique cases of complications in cocaine users that can be attributed to levamisole adulteration. The two principal <br />complications reported are haematological (140 cases of neutropenia) and dermatological (84 cases). Even though these complications can <br />occur in isolation, many cases displayed both simultaneously. No formal case of leukoencephalopathy in the setting of cocaine use has been <br />reported so far. A striking phenomenon is the apparent high level of recurrence (27.1%) of symptoms in cocaine users after re-exposure <br />to cocaine that is presumably adulterated. The importance of accurately identifying levamisole-induced complications is therefore critical <br />for symptomatic patients as discontinuation of exposure is fundamental and as a correct diagnosis prevents unnecessary and potentially <br />dangerous use of other treatment modalities like powerful immunosuppressive therapy. Literature review suggests that levamisole might <br />have the advantages of enhancing noradrenergic neurotransmission by inhibiting reuptake, by inhibiting MAO and/or COMT, by acting on <br />ganglionic nicotinic receptors and by being partially metabolized into an amphetamine-like compound. It could also increase endogenous <br />opioids and increase dopamine concentration in the cerebral reward pathway. These potential effects make levamisole an interesting choice <br />as a cocaine adulterant. It seems unlikely that levamisole use as a cocaine adulterant will soon reach an end. More information is needed <br />about the diagnosis and treatment of levamisole-induced complications, and the efforts of the medical and public health community is <br />needed to face this challenging problem. &quot;&nbsp;

And also if you ran tests on my Meph and compared it tests ran on Chinese Meph you would find that what I am saying is correct. My Meph is made domestically and isn&#039;t cooked with the same routes the Chinese/Indians and if you submitted samples to ED it&#039;d confirm what I am saying. <br /><br />My Meph is washed with an acetone wash to ensure all the bromine is extracted as possible. I used to sniff the Chinese product all day long and it almost knackered my heart, when I do the washed product though there is never any vasoconstriction or anything like that. If you examine the Chinese product and the compare the bromine content to before and after it&#039;s washed and see what it brings the yield down to you will see why they left it in. And also, as I said the bromine is what made Meph so tweaky and fiending. Mine you can do a line every 30-60 minutes and be happy rather than doing one every 5-10 mins. Also the bromine is what gives Meph the really strong fishy smell, mine does have an odor but it&#039;s not nearly as strong as the Chinese. If you get washed Cocaine the smell is also effected as the diesel smell nearly completely goes after the washing process. <br /><br />

				Haha gunna have to correct you there mate. It all depends on what you use to wash a product and whether you recrystallize it on top or not. I have made Bing with the people who make my Drone and MDA before and for a laugh we played with it and we got it to almost odorless and made the Bing into glass-crystals. Different solvents wash to different levels so if you use the stronger ones (the better ones than acetone) you can kick the odor and make it what you can almost class as &quot;Pharmaceutical grade&quot;.
