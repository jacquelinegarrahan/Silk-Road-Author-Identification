				posted this in another thread, and thought some people here might not be aware of how simple it is to make your own DMT.&nbsp; This is a really crude, inexpensive, but super easy way to perform an extraction.&nbsp; this is basically Noman&#039;s tek aka &quot;DMT for the Masses&quot; but in my own words.&nbsp; &nbsp; please be safe, though, lye is pretty volatile stuff and can leave with a nasty chemical burn real quick.&nbsp; always wear rubber gloves and goggles when working with lye and always have a big vinegar handy to neutralize lye spills.<br /><br />please be smart and wear rubber gloves &amp; safety goggles<br />and don&#039;t spill any god damn lye.&nbsp; if you do, wipe that shit with vinegar IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />the main ingredients are:<br /><br />mimosa hostilis root bark<br />lye (NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide))<br />vm&amp;p naaptha<br /><br />there are other materials you will need to buy such as:<br /><br />jars/jugs (tall and skinny is best)<br />pyrex dish (bigger the better...you want a big flat glass surface)<br />big metal spoon for stirring<br />siphon (i use a puppy feeder, which is a big plastic syringe)<br />RUBBER GLOVES<br />GOGGLES<br />i also use a face mask over my mouth and nose.<br />bottle of white vinegar (in case you spill any lye anywhere wipe it with vinegar immediately.&nbsp; do NOT use water.&nbsp; same thing applies if you get it on your skin.)<br /><br />put 750ml of water into the jar<br />slowly add 4 tablespoons of lye<br />gently stir with big metal spoon until it all dissolves<br />add 50 grams of powdered mimosa hositilis root bark<br />gently stir until its smooth.<br />let sit for a couple hours.&nbsp; you can stir it a few times an hour if you like.&nbsp; i think you should.<br />open the windows in your house<br />add about 50-75 ml naaptha. <br />gently stir for a couple minutes.<br />the naaptha will separate to the top.<br />stir it again<br />wait for it to separate<br />stir it again<br />wait for it to separate<br />stir it again<br />wait for it to separate<br />siphon off the naaptha with the puppy feeder and put it into the pyrex dish.<br />put the cover on the dish and pop it in the freezer on the coldest setting<br />leave overnight<br />in the morning you should see a bunch of crystals stuck to the dish.<br />pour the naaptha out of the pyrex back into the jar to repeat the stirring/separating.<br />leave the pyrex dish on the window sill to fully evaporate the rest of the naaptha.&nbsp; point a fan at the dish for a bit to expedite this process.<br />using a straight razor, scrape up all that DMT thats stuck to the pyrex dish and put it in a little jar or centrifuge.<br />share it with people you meet who are interested in trying DMT.<br /><br /><br />for more info search for &quot;noman&#039;s tek&quot; or &quot;DMT for the masses&quot;

				Safety note: Be careful when adding lye to water. It creates an exothermic reaction and can potentially crack weak glass and cause splashing. Just take it slow.<br /><br />For anyone wondering, this is one of the most popular and easiest teks out there. If you&#039;re a beginner, I highly recommend starting here. If you decide to try more complicated teks with higher yields, it helps to have done an easier one a few times so you have an idea of what you&#039;re going to be doing.
