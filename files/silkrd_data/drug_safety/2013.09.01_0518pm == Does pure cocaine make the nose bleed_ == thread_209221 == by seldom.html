				A friend told me that you can&#039;t sniff 80% pure cocaine cause the crystals will make your nose bleed.<br />You&#039;ve got to cut it with something like milk powder.<br />Is that true?

				I dont sniff cut cocaine, I pay the extra to buy pure. Usually 80%+ is what I&#039;m sniffing and goes up smooth as hell, no burn or anything.<br /><br />Every single time I sniff it I end up having blood in my mucus when I finally blow my nose. There hasn&#039;t been a single time when it hasn&#039;t bled, even if I chop it up SUPER fine it still bleeds. No avoiding it. I usually just wash my nostrils out with saline then let it heal for a few weeks.<br /><br />So, in my opinion &amp; experience, yes it does. Other people may say differently though.

Your friend is full of shit and doesn&#039;t know anything about pure coca.<br />Pure cocaine is smooth, it may cause minor bleeding from the nose as it constricts your blood vessels however taking a decongestant beforehand can counter that. As for a full on nose bleed that is very rare unless your snorting stronger drugs aswell.

That&#039;s the fucking truth, Ive had coke from some of the most reputable sellers on SR and they all do the same shit. I don&#039;t have blood pouring out of my nose.

				Thanks for the replies.<br />If i&#039;ve got you right:<br />- No need for putting something in the coca.<br />- Pure coca should even be finer for the nose than cut stuff.<br />Right?

				there are harsher cutting agents that will definitely make the nose bleed more.&nbsp; if your nose starts bleeding, it is time to stop and let your nose heal for a few days at least.&nbsp; &nbsp;continuing to do blow will eventually begin to eat away at the very sensitive lining in your nose and you could end up doing permanent damage that might not be so fun to deal with.<br /><br />one thing you can do is make sure you get your powder as FINE as possible.&nbsp; heat it up, push it through a gold tone coffee filter or grinder screen -- something really fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />i find it&#039;s also helpful to clean your nose out before but definitely important after use.&nbsp; <br /><br />get a neti pot and learn how to use it properly (using distilled or boiled water is important, tap water can apparently contain brain-eating amoebas that could kill you -- not even joking, this is real).&nbsp; <br /><br />also when blowing your nose it&#039;s actually bad to hold one nostril closed and blow out the other -- something i did for years, haha!&nbsp; you can damage your ear canals this way and it also strains your nasal cavity.&nbsp; it also tends to just clog one side of your nose for some reason so after you run saline through it try to blow through both nostrils evenly.<br /><br />also do not take decongestants or any kind of steroid based nasal sprays for the nose, they can actually cause more damage if the nose has already shown blood.<br /><br />
