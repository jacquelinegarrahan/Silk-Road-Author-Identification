				Hi all.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly new to the road and my significant other and I wanna give E a shot.&nbsp; We&#039;ve mostly just stuck to pot and psychedelics, but we&#039;re trying to branch out with some capsules.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read all the necessary precautions and dosages, but I&#039;m still left wondering which I&#039;m better off with -- something like kwikEmart&#039;s 100 mg pills or Aidoneus&#039; 140 mg pills.&nbsp; We&#039;re both average build, maybe a bit on the fit side.&nbsp; &nbsp;We wanna have a good time, but not lose our minds.&nbsp; Given that it&#039;s only a $10 difference between the two listings, price isn&#039;t that much of a concern, but stealth certainly is.&nbsp; Any tips or recommendations?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!

				depends on the setting, are you going to a club or going to sit at your house and roll? if I go to a club or concert I take anywhere from 100-200mg depending on how long the event is. i&#039;d recommend starting with a smaller dose as if you take 120mg plus you can feel a bit nauseated and have an awkward come up. as far as stealth goes, i&#039;ve never ordered caps. only rolls and powder. i&#039;d maybe look for an offer of 200-500mg of powder and split that up between you. the one thing I can promise you is you&#039;re going to want to do it again. it&#039;s to much fun.

				Thanks for the feedback. Just ordered 10 of kwikemart&#039;s green bulls. Looking forward to trying me out. Figure we&#039;ll each take one to start and then split another for a boost if we need it.

				hi man, my advice would be to go higher for the first time. the point is and everyone here can confirm this, that the first time taking mdma will be way better than every other roll you have in your life. so there, i would get together with some friends (girls optional but good for cuddling), atleast one of them should have experience with mdma and then go for 200-250mg. i guarantee you that you will have one if not the best time of your life :)

				I would have gone with Aidoneus I have heard wonderful things from friends about his caps so far.. <br /><br />I also stopped doing pressed pills nearly 10 years ago.. I have been eyeballing the skulls tho..&nbsp; ???<br /><br />personally have found that pressed pills just don&#039;t &quot;feel&quot; the same not sure 100% why even when they are said to be &quot;pure&quot; but they don&#039;t.. <br /><br />If you guys don&#039;t care for the presses, give crystal a try.. I think it feels cleaner and has a better come down. That might just be me.. but I figured I would toss out my 2ct on the matter.&nbsp;

MDMA affects females more because their brains are already set up to be more empathetic then males maybe because of child birth. <br /><br />I have a female friend who on her first roll only took 100 mg and she was so high she had to leave the party and chill in a quit room for a while. Save the 200-300 mg nights for another time and if possible keep doses low. I have never taken more then 300 mg in a night and I can still roll with breaks when people I know who did more have lost it.<br /><br />Also I would suggest you look into Molly or MDMA powder. When dealing with pill you could be getting other things. The combo of things in a pill WILL be a different experience then Molly. Take it from me I have done both and Molly is not going to have you dancing until 5Am, that effect comes from the speed/ caffeine or whatever else is in a pill. Molly will make you feel great but your just as content to sit on the couch and talk for hours. <br /><br />Some people like the pill effect though, especially ravers who want energy. A vendor will say they have good pills and they probably do but in order to make that pill you are dealing with more cost to the producer.&nbsp; Pill press, dyes, binders etc, all these things add to production cost.&nbsp; This extra expense could mean your getting extra things you don&#039;t want. <br /><br />Although some pills are just MDMA plus a binder, but I would say they are rare compared to pills that are MDMA and something else.
