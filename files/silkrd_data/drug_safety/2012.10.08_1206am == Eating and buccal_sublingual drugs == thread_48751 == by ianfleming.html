				Ok, so we all know that eating weakens the effects of drugs when taken orally.<br />But does eating weaken the effects of drugs taken in a buccal or sublingual way? (LSD, NBOMe, etc)<br /><br />I would assume no because buccal administration goes straight into the capillaries and bypasses primary metabolism.<br />But, I&#039;d like a definite answer.

				Most drugs are removed from your system by the liver and kidneys. Taking someone trough the mucus membranes does not bypass that route. Sub-lingual dosing of drugs is useful because it bypasses the process of ingesting something, passing it through the stomach and wait&nbsp; for absorption in the intestines.&nbsp; This will speed up delivery of a drug, bit it will still be processed by the body in the same fashion of ingesting a substance.<br /><br />The only process that can bypass that is inhalation - that route of administration will bypass metabolism, delivering the drug straight fom the lungs to the brain (and rest of the body) without any interference by the liver.

				But does eating before tripping cause a decrease in effects if your taking drugs buccally or sub-lingually?

				the effects of eating just before tripping depend on the drug you are taking:<br />MDMA - if you eat JUST before you take MDMA, you might throw up.<br />If not, due to the presence of the food, the absorption of the drug will be slower, as your stomach needs to deal with the load of the food as well.<br /><br />If you swallow LSD on a full stomach, the effect will take longer to set in. I think buccal administration would be similar in effect/duration/onset to swallowing it on an empty stomach. <br />Never Experienced nausea on LSD.<br /><br />NBOMe - these are destroyed by stomach juices and will have no effect if swallowed.<br /><br />Once the drug enters your body, the effects will also depend on the rate of metabolism of the drug vs rate of absorption.<br />e.g.<br />rate of absorption &gt;&gt; rate of metabolism = strong effects ( something like LSD )<br />rate of metabolism &gt;&gt; rate of absorption = no effect ( DMT, if swallowed)<br />rate of metabolism ~= rate of absorption = little bit to no effect (??)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=48751.msg507718#msg507718">Quote from: Ben on October 08, 2012, 01:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only process that can bypass that is inhalation - that route of administration will bypass metabolism, delivering the drug straight fom the lungs to the brain (and rest of the body) without any interference by the liver. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is absolutely correct, as can be seen with DMT - if smoked, it will hit you very hard, but the trip is short, as your body metabolises DMT pretty quickly, unless you take MAOI&#039;s with it. <br />Also, oral administration of DMT without MAOI&#039;s is ineffective.<br /><br />

				Ok, here is what I&#039;m basically asking.<br />Will eating effect the intensity of an NBOMe trip?<br />I will be taking 25i buccally after possibly consuming something like ramen.<br />Will this have as much effect as it would if I ate before taking something like 2c-e orally?

				not very sure about that specific question, but you can ask Tyler on this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24610.0<br /><br />

				Seeing as your only concern seems to be intensity I will say this: eating has never affected the intensity of a trip for me when taking LSD orally. Dropping on a full stomach has definitely taken longer to get to the peak than dropping on an empty stomach, but the end result has always been what I would expect for the dosage.<br /><br />So no I don&#039;t think eating will cause an issue at all if intensity is all you&#039;re worried about.
