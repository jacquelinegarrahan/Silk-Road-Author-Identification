				(apologies if this is in the wrong category of discussion, I wasn&#039;t sure which one to put it in)<br /><br />Hey all,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be flying this coming week (non-international) to see my gf, and I really want to bring a small amount of my weed with me (just like a joint or something, definitely not more than a gram or two). I&#039;m not planning on checking any bags onto the plane. <br /><br />So is there a way of getting a tiny stash through my carry-on luggage? Will putting it in my deodorant work? Seriously, if the only way of getting it through TSA is to shove it up my snatch, then I&#039;ll just pass on it altogether. It&#039;s not worth quite that much to me. <br /><br />any suggestions or stories of experience otherwise are welcome!

				Put it in a flat rate mailer and ship it to her<br />It will cost you $5.20 and save you jail time.

				The &quot;big&quot; question here obviously has &quot;send via mail&quot; as its &quot;big&quot; answer.<br /><br />Now to answer your original question, I first must say I am not US and thus have no experience in US travels... But I&#039;v been taking the plane in Europe regularly for a long long time...<br /><br />We&#039;ll assume you won&#039;t be smelled by dogs, because if you are, you&#039;ll almost surely get busted..<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: uniwiz</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Put in front of their face without them seeing it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Exactly that.<br /><br />Know that they probably aren&#039;t looking for drug, especially a small amount anyway... But it&#039;s your job to make sure your appearance doesn&#039;t &quot;hint&quot; them, dress properly, well shaved. Carry a book or magazine, and adopt the &quot;i&#039;m happy to go see my girlfriend, luckily planes are so fast&quot; face... The idea here is so that when security gauges you, they&#039;ll know instantly you&#039;ll pass through, but still have to do the checks anyway because it&#039;s their jobs. If there are multiple lines, avoid female security that in my experience tend to be more meticulous.<br /><br />Now where to hide, it&#039;s a small amount so it&#039;s easy. Don&#039;t put into shampoo/socks or inside anything metallic. Get rid of the smell vacuum sealing if you can, otherwise compress it tight and use duct tape. <br />Hide it, in a pocket, at the tip end of your foot inside your shoe, in your wallet, in your mouth, and my best bet in your crotch...<br /><br />But again, it&#039;s &quot;fun&quot; to pass tight securities with drugs, but it can fail... and for so small gains and so big possible consequence, do what listentothemusic tells you:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: lttm</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Put it in a flat rate mailer and ship it to her<br />It will cost you $5.20 and save you jail time.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Take ping pong ball and drill small hole in it.&nbsp; Grind up bud and put in ping pong ball.&nbsp; Seal drill hole in ping pong ball with silicone sealant.&nbsp; Lube ball up a tiny bit, stick into your anus.&nbsp; Works great, just make sure to only put just enough lube to get it into your anus or it could come out on it&#039;s own, you don&#039;t want a poop covered ping pong ball rolling down your leg while waiting in the security check lineup!

				Good advice Sarge.<br />My friend never knew were he was staying so he had no choice but to bring it with him.<br />He does fly in the us.&nbsp; Never hide it in your crotch they are looking there.<br />You may have to take a random pat down at anytime, and they WILL check your crotch.<br />Balls is handing the TSA your napkin (with weed in it) from your pants and she holds it for you, while they pat you down ;)<br />Nobody plays with a snot rag.<br />Best way is to figure out how to get past it by x-ray. Think same density.<br />My buddy flies weekly. He has been patted down, searched, and body scanned, and has no issues.<br />However he has dumped his load, if he feels uncomfortable.<br /><br />We have a thing they are now using called a body scanner.<br />Forget your crotch, pussy or anus. They are looking there now too.<br />Don&#039;t hide it in things you can&#039;t control, and throw away at the last minute.<br />They dogs sniffing for weed, are doing so in baggage claim.<br />

				I can only tell you what I&#039;m doing when I&#039;m in the states but there&#039;s no guarantees of course. I buy a bag of smokeless tobacco, the leafy ones, like RedMan or Beechnut. Dry it out for a couple days with an open bag, that shit is moist and could soak your bud. Just before you hit the airport take the tobacco out, put your bud at the bottom of the bag (unbagged of course) and put the tobacco back in on top. Keep the tobacco bag in your pocket and dump it in the tray for x-raying with your other stuff like keys and wallet. If they pull you for padding they usually leave your stuff in the tray til you&#039;re done.<br /><br />This offers two advantages. A) The smokeless tobacco leafs or leaf-cuts look about the same as bud on the x-ray, it won&#039;t stick out, and b) the smell of the tobacco will mask the bud smell quite well.<br /><br />Only downside is that you have to be quick, as soon as you pass TSA you should find the nearest crapper and take the bud out of the bag so it won&#039;t soak up smokeless tobacco moisture and aroma.<br /><br />It&#039;s not an ideal solution, but it worked 5 times for me already. TSA dun fixate on the shit they x-ray&#039;ed already hence it&#039;s really unlikely they start digging through your tobacco pouch. Even if they were trying to you could object because it&#039;s something you stick in your mouth so you dun want their fingers in it. Worst case scenario you&#039;d say you throw it away in the trashcan they have rather than having them finger something that goes in your mouth.

				i used to carry flattened, vacuum sealed weed on my person right through to the end of the trip.<br /><br />either taped to the inside of my thigh or under my nuts in a triple-sealed flat piece. i&#039;ve been patted down right on the fucking ganja stash too...you can imagine how that was.<br /><br />now that they use backscatter and millimeter wave, i dont travel with JACK SHIT.<br /><br />you either have your girl take one for the team (if she can hold more than half an O she&#039;s got a problem, or you should sell her to the mexiKartels) , or you yourself take one for the team, which i personally won&#039;t level to keistering a fucking bag of weed.<br />take heed, mailing it will save you the jailtime indeed<br /><br />L75

				person i know had an interesting trick:&nbsp; he would take a highlighter pen, pry off the back cap, somehow reach a tool inside to snip away the majority of the ink fabric, and stuff in a saran-wrapped roll of MJ, closing it up with the back cap.&nbsp; this leaves the tip intact so that it looks and functions like a real pen, and the pen case is effectively a hermetic seal.<br /><br />he traveled this way a few times post-9/11 but yeah with today&#039;s scanners who knows how different a wad of plant material looks on the bag scanner compared to a wad of ink-soaked synthetic fabric (or is it cotton??)

				Taking a joint through tsar is very simple...just don&#039;t overthink it.&nbsp; Talked the joint and put it in the waistband of your boxers or underwear.&nbsp; Roll the elastic waistline over one time to secure the joint.<br /><br />Even with a patdown, they will not feel the joint,especially stashed above your penis in your boxers elastic wasteband....<br /><br />I have successful done this at least 15-20 times over the years...<br />

				edibles is the way to go, I cross into the US and fly domestically all the time with edibles. even better if you make them with leftovers from vaporized weed, there&#039;s almost zero herb smell. whereas if you make a batch of something with a Q of fresh stinky buds, anyone who looks (or smells) closely will know something is up, i&#039;m confident my edibles could be closely examined by TSA and they&#039;d find no grounds for suspicion. not that they probably ever would be examined very closely, some cookies or muffins or the like in your bag are not going to raise any questions on the x-ray. <br /><br />haha... except brownies are the stereotypical pot edible and a weird, messy thing to carry as a snack, i would avoid those.<br /><br /><br /><br />
