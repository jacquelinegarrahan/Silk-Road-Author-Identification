				For me LSD trip always starts with joy, excitement, revelations, etc. But I end up feeling sorrow, small, unsure of anything, pessimistic about future. Don&#039;t like this part, but it gives me more than anything else. I become more responsible person.<br /><br />Does it always happen to you? Please answer if you are sure it was LSD, not any other similar psychedelic.

				All psycahadelics take you on a journey. Some parts of the journey can be difficult but the destination is always worth it. Well, unless you overdosed or dropped in an inappropriate setting.<br /><br />I go through some tough shit every time I take LSD, MDMA, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, or shrooms.

				Never really seriously. There may be bittersweetness, or deep empathy for a character in a book, or a film, or being moved to melancholy by music, but that&#039;s different to what you&#039;re asking, I assume? <br /><br />I am a big fan of listening to Alan Watts, in general and when under the influence... and his take seems to be that things are no more serious than you take them, and that you can just let go.<br /><br />I can be concerned about tendencies I have, or extra-aware of where I ought to be better, but I&#039;m never left (towards the end, or the day after) with a feeling that the world was any bleaker than before my trip started... On the contrary :)

				It happens often, but not always. I know what you are talking about, though. It used to happen to me all the time, even in my best trips there were moments of sorrow. But this doesn&#039;t happen every time any more. My last trip was 100% joy.<br /><br />And I am sure it was real LSD. My list trip was with 3jane&#039;s acid -- her LSD has good reputation here.

				I have never had a bad trip.&nbsp; I do get contemplative, but my inner demons are easily avoided.&nbsp; I only have a few small sins to worry about internalizing.<br /><br />Also, I just went into it the first time realizing it&#039;s just a drug, and never have let my mind dwell on the negative long enough to get upset about shit.&nbsp; Good times ever since.&nbsp; Take control of your mind, and steer it, instead of allowing it to steer you.<br /><br />I did do mushrooms this past weekend though (5g dried) and wound up a little sad for about 15 minutes towards the end - I thought I was fucking up my job and endangering my family - then I said, &quot;wtf, you&#039;re high asshole, go play some video games.&quot;&nbsp; So I did.

				It can&#039;t be said enough, Set and Setting. If you&#039;re getting this sorrow often with LSD you may want to look into your Set (that is your mindset, anything that&#039;s on your mind, troubling you, personal issues, ect...) and see if you can find the cause. It sounds like you have yourself under control, from your post I get the idea that you&#039;ve accepted this as part of the trip, and whilst it&#039;s not ideal it doesn&#039;t bother you that much? But seriously, it would be well worth looking into, doing some introspective work, to find out why this is. That&#039;s my opinion anyway, if it&#039;s not your thing then just ignore me I guess.<br /><br />One other thought, maybe you&#039;re overthinking this? If you had a bit of sorrow once or twice (let&#039;s say bad set or setting a couple of times) it would be reasonable to think it&#039;s going to happen the next time, and in thinking it you&#039;ve made it come true as the idea is now there for the trip.<br /><br />Short version: Set and setting is a big part of any trip (and if you&#039;re like me, arguably any experience in life) so that&#039;s where I would be looking to explain these kinds of feelings.

				Spukaroo, most probably you&#039;re right. I always mind about having proper set and setting. And I do believe they are good. Nevertheless I have strong &#039;tragic part&#039; of any LSD-trip closer to the ending. I appreciate those moments, but still sometimes I wish I could make them less tragic.<br /><br />Recently I did some 25i and the trip has started with fear and disgusting feelings but it also had some fantastic moments. I was at home in a perfect mood, so it actually hard to make better set and better setting.<br /><br />I think the most perfect for me is to spend some time with nature. When I had 25i few days ago my best moments were when I was wondering in my parents&#039; garden, talking to grape plant and flowers :) Oh my god they were beautiful<br /><br />Maybe also some Molly can do the trick and turn the trip into the right direction, I&#039;ve not tried yet.

				When you say you&#039;ve not tried Molly yet, do you mean at all, or just not in combination with psychedelics? I&#039;m going to try a candyflip at some point (it&#039;s on my to do list, but probs for sometime down the track) but would just say that if you haven&#039;t done Molly at all do it by itself first. Not so much for safety (although that is a valid point) but because I think your first roll should be a &#039;clean&#039; experience to truly get a feel for how great MDMA is :)

				Yes, I did MDMA before few times. This is my favourite drug, a number 1 drug to me. Candyflipping is also on my to-do list :) I&#039;m just looking for a right time and place. Rather impatiently :)<br /><br />However what I was just thinking is not much about candyflipping but about correcting the direction of LSD-trip by adding something that may change the mood to positive. Maybe not MDMA, but some other relaxing, mood-lifting drug. Maybe Phenotropil or something. Maybe even a good move like &quot;Some like it hot&quot; may save the situation, I&#039;ll have to try this!
