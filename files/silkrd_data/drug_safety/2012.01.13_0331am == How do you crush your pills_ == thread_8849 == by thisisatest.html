				Probably seems pretty straight forward to most people but I&#039;m curious if anyone has any innovative ways of crushing those shits up.<br /><br />I usually stick with a ceramic or glass plater, crisp bill or check, and a bic lighter.<br /><br />Smash the pill under the bill, then smooth the thinner end of the lighter back and forth until I have powder.<br /><br />I know there has to be better ways to get a finer powder, but I wonder if it really makes that much of a difference (for my scenario I am crushing an oxycodone 30mg or old school OC).<br /><br />Please share!

				I use my weed grinder. It&#039;s nice stainless steal and has a completely flat bottom. it works great. Except, for hard pills. I usually just break them down to smaller chunks and i have no problem. when u get it nice and crushed just push and spin in circles then smear it to make is extremely fine powder. Just be careful that on the initial crush the pill doesn&#039;t shoot out when it breaks.

				I personally use a swiss army knife to sort of shave the pill and to cut it up.&nbsp; I put the pill on my desk and just hold it with a finger while I shave away at it with the knife.&nbsp; Then comes the fun part. =D<br />It only really works for one pill at a time, but that&#039;s all I&#039;m usually doing anyways.

				I had friends who had a polished mable mortal and pestal, but I have a stone style, so that won&#039;t work for me.<br /><br />So I chock to cut chunks with a razor blad as other wrote, and then dump the it onto a table spoon and then place a teaspoon over it and crush it within seconds.&nbsp; Works like a charm.<br /><br />You could also prob try cutting into chunks, then using the bottom f a shot glass to get into a finer form also.

				i break it up with fingers, or cut into sall chunks with knife (careful that pieces don&#039;t do flying). Then take the small chunks put them in a folded paper and slide a bic lighter over it until fine powder.<br /><br />you hardly loose anything this way

				depends on what kind of pills.<br />the few times i snorted OCs a few years ago, before the OPs, i&#039;d scrape the external coating off with a knife or razorblade, then crush using the side of a knife and chop into powder, with roxis i just use the side of a knife or razorblade, push down, it&#039;ll turn to powder pretty much instantly, chop out and snort.<br />other than OC and roxi, only pills i&#039;ve snorted are pharm amphetamines (adderlols, dexedrines and mostly XRs), llamas method for crushing pharm speed, for when you need to crush down 6-10 dexedrine quickly at once (so you can snort them, cause you&#039;re impatient and wanna get high real bad but wont settle for half assedly crushed XR beads like a nub/dumbass) that for me can be done far quicker than the way with a lighter+piece of paper, lighter+dollar bill, shotglass+screwdriver and all the other ones i&#039;ve heard of people doing, and works just as good<br />take a small ziploc bag, SMALL, the smaller the better, but not like dime bags, as in small ziploc sandwich bag kinda things, open your dex/adderlol capsules, dump all the beads from the capsules (however many, i can crush down 10 dexedrine 10mg XR spansules to powder in just about 2-3 minutes....) in the bag, zip it shut, then take a spoon (metal obviously, the larger the better....) and roll the spoon over the beads until all the beads are crushed and you get a somewhat fine to very fine powder depending on how much effort/care you put in, oh yeah, last thing, once you have all the beads crushed down in the bag, you can snort that powder as is, but its best to basically get all the powder in the bag to one side/area when you crush it initially, and move the crushed shit to the other side of the bag, and then rolling the spoon over it a little bit more, it&#039;ll break it down even finer, <br />protip: if you use my method, if you can hear like crunching noises like from the bag, you havent crushed it down all the way...<br />i&#039;ve found no better way of crushing XR pharm amphs, and i&#039;ve got quite a lot of experience using RX speed under my belt...

				hose clamp is THE # 1 way, especially for OC<br /><br />it shaves it into such fine snow you&#039;ll see some of the nearly microscopic bits flying up and away. not any significant amount mind you but I keep my nostrils open while scraping just in case I can snag them lol

				sorry if this has already been posted, but i&#039;ve always used a hose clamp.&nbsp; just undo it, straighten it out, turn that fucker upside down, and run the pill along it like you&#039;re grating a block of cheddar cheese.&nbsp; fast (depending on how vigorously you grate it, i guess), efficient with zero loss of pill matter, and very easy.<br /><br />
