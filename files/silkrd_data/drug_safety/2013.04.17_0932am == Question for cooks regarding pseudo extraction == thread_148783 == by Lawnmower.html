				I&#039;m almost ready to do my first RP/I cook (push-pull) and have a question regarding the extraction of pseudoephedrine.<br /><br />I&#039;m not in the US and hence I have got hold of pseudo tablets containing only cellactose, magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide as excipients. These are common pill ingredients - there doesn&#039;t seem to be anything specifically added to foil extraction. They also have an orange coating that I&#039;m assuming can be washed/peeled off.<br /><br />From what I have read pseudo is highly water soluble so I was thinking that, after removing the coating, a simple cold water extraction, NP solvent wash (naphtha or toluene) and good filtering should be sufficient to give me pretty pure pseudo. <br /><br />Does anyone have any input on this? Thanks!<br />&nbsp;

				They may or may not list all the ingredients on the box.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never actually gone through the process, but I&#039;ve read quite a bit about it, so take my response accordingly -- but to the best of my knowledge, you can&#039;t always trust the box.<br /><br />If you extract with water you&#039;re going to be waiting fucking forever for the shit to evaporate though.&nbsp; I recommend something else.&nbsp; There was a stunningly effective method... it might have been by Geezmeister or Worlock, I don&#039;t really remember.&nbsp; I decided not to cook after studying it for awhile -- only wanted to supply myself anyway, and I&#039;d rather just buy the stuff frankly -- so it&#039;s been a long time.&nbsp; Was a procedure involving acetone, naphtha, and xylene I think... no soaking or anything.&nbsp; Well, whatever.<br /><br />My advice is basically don&#039;t use water, it&#039;ll take forever to evaporate.&nbsp; Also, you want the cleanest p-fed you can get.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the trouble getting it as pure as possible -- total failure is a lot easier to run into than the media would have you believe.

				Surely they must be legally obliged to state all the ingredients? In case of an allergic reaction or something. I have the manufacturer&#039;s documentation for the pills and these are the only ingredients listed. Still, I will keep that in mind.<br /><br />It&#039;s frustrating that all the teks for extracting pseudo require a larger amount of exotic ingredients than the main reaction does.... It pains me that this should be the hardest part of the whole process! <br /><br />Thanks for your input&nbsp; ;D<br />

				Assume nothing when it comes to chemical reactions.<br /><br />Whilst the rest of the book is VERY questionable (and downright wrong in places), a great primer on pseudo pill mushing (yes, that is a technical term) is one of the chapters of Uncle Festers Methamphetamine Secrets. Google it and grab the PDF if you haven&#039;t already done so, but if you are following any of the rest of the book, take everything you read in it with a pinch of salt.<br /><br />Why not take a small quantity of said pills and do a tiny dry run to see what it turns out like? You&#039;ll be able to tell pretty quickly if there is going to be difficult binders and stuff in there to deal with.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I will attempt a couple of grams of pseudo first, with the simplest method I can find. The pills are very cheap so I can afford to try a few different teks. I do not however want to end up wasting my RP since it is fairly hard to come by, so I will need to be reasonably sure of the purity of the pseudo. I guess it will be difficult to determine this without some kind of analysis? <br /><br />I am a science grad, but my organic chemistry knowledge is limited; are they any particular parts of Fester&#039;s push-pull reaction that are &quot;downright wrong&quot; and need to be avoided?<br />I plan on using a method that I have compiled from 4-5 different sources (including Fester), keeping the common parts to all of them to try and get a good &quot;average&quot; so to speak.<br /><br />Thanks guys

				Basically, as long as you don&#039;t use too much H2O and you have your RP and iodine in a suitable vessel that&#039;s being heated properly... the cook is likely to work.&nbsp; That&#039;s assuming you don&#039;t have other rubbish in it that screws everything up; after the cook itself, you just need to extract the meth and attach the hydrochloride salt to get your methamphetamine hydrochloride.&nbsp; Really the hard part is getting the materials and knowing what to do with glassware -- but again, I never actually went through the process.
