				Has anyone taken these two together?<br />I have been planning on taking 50mg Vyvanse (lisdexamphetamine) and 5 mg memantine once daily in the hopes of higher potentiation (less accumulation of tolerance) and smoother experience throughout the day. The idea is that memantine blocks NMDA-type glutamate receptors and therefore reduces amphetamine tolerance. Does anyone know of/have experience with this combo?<br /><br />Any advice surrounding this?

				Generally speaking, when I researched that sort of thing, I ended up coming to the conclusion that there hadn&#039;t been any definitive studies of anything that didn&#039;t actually diminish the effect of the amphetamine.&nbsp; Some of them quite definitely reduce tolerance, but they reduce how much effect the drug has as well, and I couldn&#039;t find any information on whether the reduction was proportional, greater, less -- you get the point.&nbsp; Lack of info.<br /><br />I&#039;m wagering memantine would be no different, but do let us know if you try it and disagree.

				Well, today was day 1 of the trial.<br />Took the 5 mg memantine several hours after the Vyvanse and I had also taken some Benadryl due to allergies earlier in the day. Therefore, the drowsiness that I felt was definitely due mostly to the Benadryl. Tomorrow I will be taking them at the same time and am expecting some slight mental fog due to the adjustment to the memantine but we shall see. Hopefully the memantine lets the Vyvanse fire back up to it&#039;s usual efficiency! After taking the memantine today, I felt a bit sluggish at first but then I felt another wave of energy, like the Vyvanse was picking back up (and this was later in the day so the Vyvanse effects should have been wearing off due to my tolerance). <br /><br />Let&#039;s see what day 2 brings.

				Memantine is very underrated, I&#039;m glad to see people know about it and yeah I have done this combo (well with adderall and xanax). It really does work in lowering your tolerance, but I still wouldn&#039;t recommend making a habit out of it.&nbsp;

				Delta, would you be willing to describe what your dosing schedule was and what you would recommend for best effects? I want to only do this kind of combo on an as-needed basis and want to do it in the most effective/efficient way. Any info on your experience would be great. Glad to know someone else knows about this and has tried it.

I hit 30mg/day IR of adderall and after hours of looking on how to break down the tolerance safely it lead down to NMDA antagonists and so I decided to go with Memantine because it seemed like the most effective for people using adderall/sanax. I started with 10mg of Memantine combined with my usual dose of adderall and about two weeks after starting the Memantine regime I took a break from both substances (the longer the better, I went a week cold turkey). Then I started again except this time I lowered the dose of the adderall to 20mg and it actually worked, I even felt the good ol&#039; euphoria that I used to get. You basically continue this routine until you hit the dose you feel most comfortable with, for me it was 5mg twice a day. I would also recommend on top of this regime to take supplements that will help you reduce tolerance and repair some damage:<br />-L-tyrosine<br />-L-theanine<br />-Gaba (still controversial on whether it actually helps but I figured it couldn&#039;t hurt)<br />-Magnesium Chelate<br />-Vitamin B Complex<br />-Daily Multivitamin <br />
