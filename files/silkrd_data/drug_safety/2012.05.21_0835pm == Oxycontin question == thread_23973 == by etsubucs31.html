				I have only tried oxycontin once, about 3 weeks ago. It was a 20mg and I took it orally without chewing it. Since I had no tolerance I thought it would really fuck me up, however it didn&#039;t do a whole lot. I got an extended nice buzz but no rush, and the buzz was nothing that special. Now I have gotten a 40mg and was wondering how I should take it. Right now I&#039;m thinking about crushing it, taking half of it orally, snort 1/4th when I feel the onset of the initial dose, and snorting the remaining 1/4th about 2 hours later. Do you all think this would be too much? I&#039;ve heard people say that 5-10 mgs for a first time user would be enough, but after taking the 20, I have no idea how that would do much for anybody.

				Are you certain that first 20 mg was legit?<br /><br />Getting &#039;really fucked up&#039; is a rather relative term, but you should have noticed some profound effects as an inexperienced user.

				i&#039;ve tried to research the release rate of oxycotin..&nbsp; not sure if it is a slow continuous release or a multi-phase release.&nbsp; but i know it&#039;s designed to work over 12 hours, so if it was two phase it would be 10 mg then 10 mg six hours later.&nbsp; if it is slow continuous it would be a mere 0.6 mg an hour.&nbsp; <br />so without chewing or breaking it up the release may have been so subtle to never achieve a decent peak blood plasma level to go beyond a threshold dose.<br />i have only broken and sniffed ocs before.&nbsp; that is your best bet to get a decent buzz.&nbsp; i would snort at least 10 to 15 mg to start, but be careful.&nbsp; then you can always do small 5 mg bumps to extend the effects.&nbsp; <br />orally may just be too unpredictable with those things.&nbsp; unless somebody else understands their release mechanism better then I.<br /><br />*destiny*

				It helps me to chew it up and then take a couple tylenol with it.

My first time I snorted a 20mg. It was good not great. Then a week later I tried snorting a 40mg. For me, That was great and I didn&#039;t get sick. Now keep in mind that I am close to 300 pounds. I got myself a green 80. Did not like it. I snorted half of it expecting to get the same effects as the 40mg. Did not happen so an hour later I snorted the other half and I got sick. I ask around and the word I got about it is that the pills are made and then the medicine is dropped into the pill. Sometimes the medicine can lean to being mostly on one side of the pill. I didn&#039;t really believe that stuff but I sure would like to snort a big 40mg about now

				For pills with the slow release layer, I&#039;ll put the pill in a shot glass of soda... after a bit, the peeling comes off and I just drink the &quot;shot&quot;...

				I did 20mg oxynorm (IR oxycontin?) my first time .. I felt it, but it was not what I was expecting .. in fact it was pretty lame&nbsp; :P It came in the original blister packaging so I&#039;m pretty sure it was the real deal. After listening to my friends talk so much about oxycontin I thought it was going to be something amazing .. but it&#039;s definitely something I would never spend much money on again. I actually spent ages reading through the SR forums after my first time trying to find out if other people also didn&#039;t &#039;feel much&#039; from it ..<br /><br />I have done it a bunch of times since that initial disappointing time and to me the trick to enjoying it is to not expect too much. I found it useful to take around people who usually irritate me .. the oxy makes me calm I guess so it&#039;s easier to put up with people&nbsp; :P

				I ended up doing the 40mg oxy today. I must say, it was much more difficult to crush then I thought. Anyways, I decided to just take it all at once. About an hour in I felt a nice buzz but thats about it. I then drank a fair bit of water, and it really started to kick in. I felt lovely for about 4/5 hours. Does anybody know how many days I should wait to take to other?

				I had a similar experience, with oxycodone, at least. i acquired oxyfast- concentrated liquid oxycodone. it&#039;s 20mg/ml and for my first time using oxycodone, i took 1.5 ml, or 30mg oxycodone. I really didnt feel anything other than a mild opiate buzz, and that damn itch haha. and with no tolerance to opiates! I think i just have a naturally high opiate tolerance for some reason, because i need to take like 40-50mg of vicodin to get where i want to be, which is a toxic dose of tylenol, so i have to CWE every time but i rarely do opiates. and i mean RARELY. So idk, maybe we&#039;re just some of those unlucky folk that dont get to enjoy the pleasure of opiates :(

				I&#039;ve never been on oxycontin, just IR oxycodone, and I don&#039;t really get &quot;high&quot; from it, mostly because I use it for pain relief.&nbsp; I do get the itchies and can be short-tempered, but I do have less pain and way more energy!

				are you taking IR oxycodone (roxies), generic Indian oxy (crushable), or do they have &quot;OP&quot; imprinted on them?&nbsp; There&#039;s a HUGE difference... if you have the OP&#039;s, you won&#039;t be able to crush or chew them, and you won&#039;t have any sort of real high from simply ingesting them.&nbsp; If you do have the OP&#039;s, there are tutorials out there on how to extract the goodies.
