				This past weekend I took some &quot;MDA&quot; which I now think was actually methylone. I noticed a sweet maple syrup-like smell when I was meting out doses which I had not read was a quality of MDA. After some additional digging around, I read that methylone has the maple syrup scent that I smelled, as well as the lack of psychedelic qualities that MDA is known for... so unless anyone has any anecdotal evidence for MDA smelling like maple, I&#039;m gonna assume this is the substance I&#039;m dealing with. :P<br /><br />I really need to get my hands on a damn testing kit. Buying drugs on the street is so sketchy.<br /><br />ANYWAY, all this back story aside, I took the &quot;MDA&quot;/methylone because I&#039;d read it had no cross-tolerance with MDMA since I&#039;m planning to roll at a show in late December. Now that I believe it was actually methylone, I&#039;ve been trying to find info on whether or not there is cross tolerance between M1 and MDMA. I can&#039;t seem to get a clear answer on this, so I thought I&#039;d crowdsource the info from the ever-so-knowledgable SR community!<br /><br />So, does anyone know if there&#039;s cross-tolerance between M1 and MDMA?

				depending on which precursor was used to synthesize it, most MDx substances have a sweet maple syrup/black licorice smell...<br /><br />this comes from using safrole which comes from sassafras which is used as a flavoring for traditional root beer hence giving it a sweet smell...<br /><br />i have read a report where a person took MDA from a trusted source and he said that it smelled like rotting carrots which oddly enough is also sweet smelling like maple syrup...<br /><br />my experience with methylone is limited but from what i gather, it&#039;s like MDMA without the empathic &quot;push&quot; or urgency...<br /><br />the psychedelic effects of MDA are actually quite subtle...it&#039;s more like tricks of shadow and lighting rather than full blown OEVs...like you think you see something there but in reality it&#039;s just patterns of light and dark...<br /><br />as for cross-tolerance...i always space my rolls far enough apart that it&#039;s never an issue so i wouldn&#039;t know...

				Any pics of the product?&nbsp; How much did you consume?&nbsp; How long did it last?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how there can&#039;t be at least some cross-tolerance between MDA and MDMA.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been asking on fellow SR people that use methylone the question &quot;why do you use methylone when MDMA is so cheap on SR.&quot;&nbsp; One person said that they can take methylone much more frequently than MDMA without as much of a problem building up tolerance.<br /><br />In any case, even if you took MDMA the effect it will have on a late December roll is negligible if that.
