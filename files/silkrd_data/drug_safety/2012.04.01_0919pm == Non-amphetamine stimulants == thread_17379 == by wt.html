				I&#039;m wondering if people could give me advice on how suitable any other phenethylamine or substituted amphetamine (or other) chemicals are as weekly-use stimulants (perhaps at much lower dosages).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m asking because talking doctors into scripts for adderall/dexedrine/vyvanse is becoming a pain in the ass and I&#039;m also just interesting in trying something new.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has any taken 2C drugs at low dosages primarily for the stimulant effect?&nbsp; What about Methylone?&nbsp; I&#039;m really kind of novice here and so don&#039;t really even know which drugs I should even be looking into (if any!).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks all!<br /><br />

				Dude Provigil (Modafinil) is killer.&nbsp; 5 days on 2 days off gives great results without tolerance and decent euphoria, mental stimulation and phys energy.. rarely any side effects for me or the tested population.<br /><br />Its going generic in a a few days in the US and a doc will readily write a script due to the $$ powers of Cephalon.&nbsp; It is already generic in Europe and MANY vendors are/ will offer it here on the Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Try COHERENCE on the road under stimulants.<br /><br />-<br />good luck bro<br />j

				yes, as said above, try modafinil. it gets you pretty alert without any jitter or other side effects. i can also vouch for coherence, had several orders and i was always very satisfied with him/her!

				I would love to find a good non amphetamine stimulant because I always finish my vyvanse script early, which is absolutely horrible, but in my experience there&#039;s nothing that can give me what I get from amphetamines, neither recreational nor psychiatric. When I dont have my meds I usually just drink lots of coffee and mope, become irritable and withdrawn, sleep all day sort of thing. This modafinil sounds interesting.

				I received 10x of Coherence&#039;s Modafinil (Modalert brand) yesterday and tried it today. I hadn&#039;t had it for a couple of years but it is just as good as i remember. A positive outlook and general desire to get things done without the body load and anxiety of other stimulants (dexamphetamine, caffeine, adderall etc). It came packed exceptionally well, for those interested. Coherence is a great seller! I am going to try the armodafinil next... hopefully with slightly less internal tension which i experienced later in the day after a second dose (200mg tablet)<br /><br />I won&#039;t try it again tomorrow, but will save for when i really need it (doing a masters at the moment and plenty of late nights and long days at work).<br /><br />

				Modafinil is good if you want to be mentally alert, but if its that amphetamine euphoria and speedyness you seek try some methylone you cant beat the price and the comedown is almost non-existant.

				I love stims of all sorts and Modalert or Modafinil is quite good.&nbsp; The are some advertised undesirable side effects such as a rash for a slim portion of the population. So I started with a allergy test like someone trying RCs should do.<br /><br />&nbsp;Very popular now to treat shift worker disorder and the US military uses it extensively for high alert long combat situations. Fighter pilots Green Berets sort of thing..Very good push for me and a nice focus without jitters or tough comedown.&nbsp; &nbsp;The structure is not amphetamine and actually all the study work indicate in actually works in the opposite fashion from amphetamines. In fact quite a bit of theory about treating meth addicts with it.&nbsp; Modafinil is a serotonin&nbsp; re uptake inhibitor not a huge releaser like meth or amph.&nbsp; Lots fo inof for the cutious minded out in the real web on this relatively new and increasing popular pharma product. I apologize for my horrbile spelling but spell check is confused too, The Speedy Nnija made a good start here on the US but has gone stealth but coherence is the man.<br /><br />Hilly<br />

Amphetamine is a shortened form of it&#039;s chemical name Alpha-MethylPHenylEThylAmine. Modafinil is a benzsulfinylhydryl compound and doesn&#039;t contain the a-methylphenylethylamine skeleton.<br /><br />Earlier this week I tried methiopropamine and dimethocaine, both alone and mixed. Methiopropamine is a stimulant and is the thiophene analogue of methamphetamine. at 50mg insufflated, it gave good focus and motivation lasting around 5 hours with few after effects. It would be perfect for studying.<br /><br />I have 12g of it but I think I&#039;m going to give most of it away as I have the feeling it has the potential to be quite addictive. I found myself reaching for the bag every hour and had terrible sleep 12 hours after dosing.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t at all impressed with dimethocaine, it was barely stimulating and I felt like there was a strong vasoconstrictive element, won&#039;t be touching it again.<br /><br /><br />
