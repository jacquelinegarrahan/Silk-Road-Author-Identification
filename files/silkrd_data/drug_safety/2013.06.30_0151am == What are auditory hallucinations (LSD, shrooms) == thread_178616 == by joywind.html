				Every time I take LSD, the same sounds play in my mind. These sounds are heard best when I am in complete silence. Crackling and wooshing sounds, high pitched drones, a high speed whirring sound like something out of a Sci-Fi movie&#039;s machine, etc. The whirring starts, gets more intense, then decreases, then repeats. Is this normal? Does anyone else have auditory hallucinations similar to these? From a scientific perspective, what causes these hallucinations?

				Often times when tripping on 2c-e, 2c-p or sometimes LSD I get this chopping noise like a helicopter is flying overhead. Also, on occasion peoples words get chopped up, like their talking through a fan.<br />These things happen the same way that visual hallucinations do, they&#039;re just a result of having taken a hallucinogen.

What is going on inside of the brain that corresponds to the noises.

				maybe it&#039;s the thought of hearing it that makes it seem like you actually hear it. Ketamine gives me sound trips but I&#039;ve had sound trips on LSD, and other psychedelics as well. Shrooms sometimes cause me to hear a vibration. One time I heard my mom say something to me and it was the Siamese cat I had. I&#039;m not kidding then My mom pulled into the driveway and said the exact same thing

				I tried DiPT 28mg once, from uhrwerk.&nbsp; It was sorta interesting, as it&#039;s a tryptamine that mainly acts on hearing.&nbsp; Music started sounding like the instruments weren&#039;t tuned and the musicians out of time.&nbsp; Some peoples&#039; voices became rather deep, even females, which was odd.&nbsp; But when I spoke I scared myself a little, my voice sounded really fantastically deep, it was like helium but the opposite, and for hours.&nbsp; I intend to take a higher dosage next time as the effects weren&#039;t as pronounced as I anticipated.&nbsp;

				you don&#039;t need DIPT for this effect : get some SF6 (sulfurhexafluoride, its a gas available in some laboratories) and inhale it. darth vader effect. youtube it. should be plety of entries for it.<br />You need to turn upside down to empty your lungs completely. <br />Would love to see the reaction of someone on acid together with you, who doesn&#039;t know you just inhaled this compound and you talk straight to him. should give you a good time. :)

That feeling like you are out of air and need to breath is not caused by being out of air but by having your lungs full of CO2. If you have a different gas in your lungs you will not feel like you are in need of air or like you need to breath, therefore you can pass out and/or asphyxiate yourself. This is not something I would try if I was tripping.<br /><br />Also, Nitrous makes LSD insanely powerful for about 3 minutes and when you exhale it (don&#039;t hold it very long (more than 10 seconds) for the same reasons as listed above) you get a nice deep voice, which makes it lots of fun to say demonic-esque things right before taking off.

				My mind starts playing music on Lsd. Not like I&#039;m thinking about a song or anything but clearly hearing it. I&#039;ve actually walked around my neihborhood trying to find were the music was coming from until shure enough walked like 2 miles and was still hearing it all in my head!!! I can play with it alittle now like change songs or change sounds inside the songs. Scared me at first with like ticking sounds but ddoesn&#039;t happen anymore just music
