				One must stress SET and SETTING for this mix. I had a terrible experience with this over the weekend at a concert. I heard good reports on this combo (similar to mdma+lsd, aka candy flipping), but I was still very cautious as it was my first time taking 25i.So I only took 50mg of MDMA, and 1 tab of 25i. I took the 25i in two halves, not feeling the first half after 45min I foolishly took the second one. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I was getting impatient with the 25i, and wondering why it hadn&#039;t kicked in yet; I had three other tabs on me and luckily I did not take them. When it kicked in I felt very disoriented and scared, not having tried 25i on its own before.&nbsp; I would HIGHLY recommend doing it on its own first, at home or in a comfortable setting. I get crowd anxiety even when I&#039;m sober, and there I was in the middle of a huge crowd, pressed against thousands of people, and no quick and easy way out. After getting help from my girlfriend to exit the crowd (my motor ability was gone, and I was feeling and experiencing events 5 seconds after they occurred), I walked around in the deepest fear I&#039;ve ever experienced for 2 hours. It felt like days. I was afraid of going anywhere for fear that I would get lost and disappear forever. I couldn&#039;t even use the portapotty to pee on my own! The looping was very hard to go through, and I could not find any clear head space. It felt as if I went insane and would never find reality again. Luckily, it did subside, as I went away from the music and flashing lights. Looking into my girlfriend&#039;s eyes also brought me back at times, for some reason. Deep breaths and a bottle of water helped too. I was not prepared for its effects and was expecting something totally different.<br /><br />I say if you are experienced and know the effects and your target dosage it would be fine. I wouldn&#039;t do more than 1/2 a tab. And remember, never do more than 3!

				No personal experience but an Erowid report if you haven&#039;t seen it:<br /><br />*CLEARNET WARNING*<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=96220<br /><br />I would say the biggest issue is that both are stims even though MDMA often doesn&#039;t feel like it when you are on it. I&#039;d lower the dose of both if you are going to try it since they will definitely add to each other. <br /><br />If you are looking for a safer option, MDMA goes well with 2CB and many more people have tried it and lived to tell about it. I normally like to take it at the end of a roll but that&#039;s just me. Another, likely safer option, would be to give MDA a try and see how that gets you. At decent doses it&#039;s extremely visual and keeps a lot of the feel greatness of MDMA.<br /><br />Last but not least if you want to candy flip you might as well just candy flip. LSD and MDMA go great together and a ton of people have tried and love it. Obviously there might be some reason you want to try the 2Ci with MDMA and nothing wrong with that, I love trying new stuff, just wanted to point out some alternatives and encourage you to start smaller than you think as they seem to multiply the effects of each other in what sounds like an occasionally uncomfortable way if not carefully dosed.<br /><br />Let us know how it goes if you try it!

				maybe Blood Pressure problems...... increased risk of Heart Attacks etc... <br /><br />25i is hard on the heart..... some people report heart palpitations.. MDMA would make this side effect worse! <br /><br />Skip the 25i<br />&nbsp;No need for the extra paranoia.<br />

				Don&#039;t panic! If really bad things were likely, you would have heard already...<br /><br />Fully agree that each individual should try each substance in isolation before starting to combine them. Time dilation (i.e. seconds feel like hours, can occasionally be a problem with 25i. Not that it&#039;s really a problem, as the longer you spend in the space the better imho. But not so good if you&#039;re trying to cross the street, or run from the feds etc...)<br /><br />I had a bit of an episode with 25i, 25c &amp; ket (full report on &quot;Tyler&#039;s Strawberry&quot; thread)<br /><br />But happily went back to all of them ;-)<br /><br />Main thing to remember is combined effects are often multiplied rather than added, if that makes sense. Start with a sub-optimal dose of molly (e.g. 80mg) just to ease you in a bit, far from a full on roll, wait an hour, and then take the 25i. Haven&#039;t tried the reverse order (sherbet-flipping?!)<br /><br />There are lots of reports about MXE being the ideal runway to 25i and that is definitely a lovely combo.<br /><br />Equally, 25i is so nice, you can skip any pre-dosing altogether and still have a great time. But I understand, if you have the toys, you want to play with them...<br /><br />Our favorite is: soaking 2x 1200 µg tabs of 25i in a capful of vodka for 2-3 hours, then dissolving 100mg MXE in the same solution. Dry out, on a heated plate, then snort 50mg of product. Fucking beautiful smooth vivid clean trip. Have used this with complete virgins (to both MXE &amp; 25i) and they LOVE it. The MXE works some magic and calms your body before the ride.<br /><br />A good heavy dose of K towards the end just wraps things up perfectly. The session will feel as good as a two week vacation...!<br /><br />Obviously, none of the above should be attempted away from a safe friendly environment...!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				Er, I wouldn&#039;t really like to try, besides the taste isn&#039;t going to be carried over in any useful way.<br /><br />I use vodka as it&#039;s a pure combo solvent, it&#039;s &quot;food safe&quot; and will definitely evaporate more quickly than water alone, leaving absolutely nothing behind. Some things maybe dissolve easier in ethanol too.<br /><br />All liquor other than plain unflavored vodka, contains other stuff besides water and ethanol. This may screw your results up. The one time I deviated (using lime-flavored vodka, as it was all I had to hand) I got sticky brown sludge instead of dry white crystals. Maybe the limonene (or whatever they add to it) fucked it up.<br /><br />So no, would not recommend it!
