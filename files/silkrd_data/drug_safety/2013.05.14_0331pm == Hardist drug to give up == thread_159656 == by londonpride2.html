I limit myself to monthly cocaine usage for this very reason. I know that if I use it too often it won&#039;t be a treat. It will be an unhealthy, expensive habit.

If everything was available, people would realize there is better and probably safer highs out there.<br /><br />i.e. the way things should be.

				I would say that the answer to this question will vary from one individual to the next. I don&#039;t think there is one definitive answer.<br /><br />That being said...<br />For me the hardest drug to give up is amphetamine because I know that without it (via prescription), I would have to suffer a reasonably long period of time of decreased functioning. Because I don&#039;t abuse my medication or amphetamines in general, I wouldn&#039;t classify it as addiction per se, but I definitely am dependent on the substance for daily standards of functioning.

				Cigarettes without a doubt, but mostly the act of smoking rather than for the nicotine, been living in heavy denial of my addiction for quite some time, I tried to quit multiple times, but longest i made without smoking it was about 1 week(but mostly failed before the end of the second whole day), feeling rather stupid if i think about how absurd some of the excuses(to myself) i came up with were, to buy a pack of cigs as an &#039;exception&#039;<br />I spend more money on cigarettes than I do on drugs monthly -.-<br /><br /><br />Ive done Meth and Heroin quite a bit, but I am nowhere near being a daily user and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever become one, because I have too much &quot;respect&quot; for those two (respect meaning being aware how easy it is to get too deep into it without even noticing and being afraid of the damages of too regular use)<br /><br /><br />

				Huh, good question, let&#039;s see while I was reading this thread so many of you had such valid points to which were or are the hardiest for you to give up. Other than the penile enhancement, which I have had some serious fun with letting the girls do their thing whilst I take a nap, I can identify with each and every one. First I thought benzo&#039;s, then it had to be cigs, no opiates for sure, wait a minute sugar yea that&#039;s the one, but then there was that weed in college that I swore I would never stop smoking, because you can&#039;t fix a car without a wrench, weed was my wrench for about let&#039;s say sixteen years, till it was time for her to take the nap. Now after all this grand thought into what was the hardiest drug to quit I have to say it is the one and only Vitamin P. This shit has and does cost me the most time, pain, joy and MF&#039;n money of everything I chase after. That&#039;s right that sweet stuff has run me ragged for 30 yrs and I see no stopping it. I have easily spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this stuff and have a monthly bill of over 8k for the past stuff I have had. Yep, even with the knowledge and experience I now have I can not stop pursuing this slippery stuff that consumes my every thought, keeps me breathing, and can put me to sleep.&nbsp; It empties my wallet and bank account, leaving me well,&nbsp; SATISFIED&nbsp; hahaha Whaahoo&nbsp; Got to love that stuff&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Can&#039;t stop!!<br /><br /><br /><br />
