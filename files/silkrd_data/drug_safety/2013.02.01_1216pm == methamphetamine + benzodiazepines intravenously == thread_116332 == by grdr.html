				Anyone do this ? I sometimes do combo of methamphetamine and diazepam vial 10mg/2ml in one shot and get unique rush kinda very mellow relaxing and high is kinda very pleasurable and&nbsp; very calm. Speech is slurred very interesting combo. Also gonna try experiment more with this combining midazolam and more of diazepam later if I have access to these drugs.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />2013 04 09<br /><br />Will be getting 0.25g d-methamphetamine from iisthisisi, will try to do it in 3 intravenous injections first will be only 83mg dextromethamphetamine, second 83mg dextromethamphetamine + 10mg diazepam, third 83mg dextromethamphetamine + 5mg midazolam.<br /><br />Will try to do in 3 days.&nbsp; If any cravings occurs will use opiates/opiods.<br /><br />Thanks iisthisisi for support, good chemist. His vendor page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/867d33d2f6 - I like his style, no silly pictures, no false advertisements, tells things how it really is, no bullshitter. Serious man - serious product. Even though I haven&#039;t even tried d-methamphetamine (aka crystal meth) I tried his <br />d/l amphetamine which was pure, without cuts. For european methamphetamine he&#039;s the man to go. OK now I&#039;m waiting for my package, will do these two speedball &quot;experiments&quot; and will write my experience, so this thread is gonna breathe for a while.<br /><br />2013 04 10<br /><br />Ahhhhhh my good old family doctor. She knows I&#039;m using drugs. SO I come there without even registering and even waiting in line to quickly ask for a script. I ask her to prescribe me some midazolam 5mg/ml ampoules. A few months earlier i was able to get her write me a script for 10 after a lot of nagging because she was afraid i was gonna overdose or something. Well then she starts writing and asks how much do you need ? I say 30 (you can maximum write 60 pills or 30 injectable ampoules on a prescription in benzodiazepines case). Well and to my surprise she wrote me all 30 and told me to get out lol. Thats a good family doc to have.:). I know that midazolam is used in combination with fentanyl before operations and currently I have some heroin so decided to try mixing up.<br />Well I dropped powder in the spoon and poured 1 ml of midazolam which is 5 mg. Cooked it up with intention to shoot half but shot everything up. To my surprise rush wasn&#039;t good. Wasn&#039;t as good as heroin alone or midazolam alone. maybe i did something wrong. But I got very heavy nods like standing and having visuals or dreaming. Now I&#039;m starting to sober up so updates here. I hope next week to get iisthisisi methamphetamine so I could write my experience to you guys. I will also try doing one more heroin/midazolam 5mg shot if I can.<br />Oh yesterday before going to bed I did a good fat H shot and went to bed but just wanted to do something so picked up some of Ruthenium 2C-B sample (you can read my crazy experience of injecting about 30mg of it without basically none previous experience om her review thread) and took a bit orally drank down with milk. Well unfortunately I fell asleep but had weirdest trippy dreams ever. it was VERy strange the dreams felt like reality but they were just dreams. very hard to explain this one with words.. Well thanks for reading.<br /><br />P.S. Mixing opiates/opiods with benzodiazepines while injecting can be very dangerous because benzodiazepines depresses breathing more effectively this way than taken orally.

				from diazepam alone if you haven&#039;t got big tolerance to benzos you kinda feel drunk but mixed it kinda gives you calm rush and it&#039;s very unique kinda hard to explain.

				I often throw a small dose of Ice into a shot of opiates. But considering the strength of drugs I enjoy, I&#039;m actually a very casual user, so they are small doses. Often ~30mg of Ice into 30-70mg of H/~3mg of Diluadid (Hydromorphone). <br /><br />I&#039;ll eat a Benzo now and again for sleep on a night where I cannot and have to work early, but rarely mix them with other drugs (I almost said never, although I realized back in my heavy usage days I would eat Xanax and Morphine together when H or OC was unavailable for my normal RoA). So I guess I&#039;m curious about this now that you bring it up. What is your common dose when used separately? used together?

Definetely if you do heroin and can&#039;t get any good quality and have access to diazepam try this i will update on meth + midazolam Iv later when i try it.

				Combining meth and benzoids is a very dangerous combo. It can cause you to be unable to regulate your blood pressure with it climbing very fast and then dropping heavily. This could lead to heart fibrillation and lead to your heart stopping. It&#039;s not a good feeling when you can&#039;t regulate blood pressure. Most people describe the feeling as overwhelming doom. But, who said speedballing wasn&#039;t scary? I can&#039;t say don&#039;t because i have. But, even after all the times i have. I wouldn&#039;t recommend someone doing it and after what happened last time. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever speedball again.<br /><br />Also, there&#039;s no going back when were talking IV. When your using other routes of administration. You have time to filter some out, and the onset is slower allowing your organs to have time. You have to remember that your body and brain treat all outside substances as an infection. Please stay safe. I wish i would of took&#039;s peoples advice on speedballing. All i can do now is pray my heart recovers with time.

				looked up on the net more about this and found out people who do this experience same feeling as mine - that opiate like feeling. for me personally meth isn&#039;t very fun because it lasts too long only for rush but with benzos it&#039;s like the different drug altogether. However I don&#039;t like mixing meth with heroin because they kinda cancel each other. can&#039;t wait to try midazolam + meth IV . Will update.

				My Opinion:&nbsp; Save the Diazepam for when you are coming of the other shit. I can see what you are trying to do but..yeah, not my thing perhaps.<br /><br />I once mixed valium with ecstasy , It was relaxing but I found the valium kindof took away from some of the euphoria of the E. I also had some other strange hallucinatory effect.. When I would close my eyes it was as if I could see the room clearly.. like my eyes were closed but I could look around at the room as if they were open..Fucked Up too say the least..

				Wow it was hard to find this thread i remember this quite well and will keep updating. So today I had bought 3 baggies of local powdered meth snorted 1 nothing majot&nbsp; shot up 2 god a decent rush and high. Ok so i had midazolam 5mg/ml ampoules but no more pity i didn&#039;t have methamphetamine. I will try getting more of them. Currently I&#039;m not in a very good place moneywise but can still get midazolam and diazepam ampoules. I wrote to one good person about quality d-methamphetamine and might be getting paid sample so folks i will update you sooner or later with my methamphetamine/benzodiazepine intravenous speedballs. Ah such a pity thinking about midazolam and no methamphetamine.... Would have been interesting trip report. Will keep you posted.<br /><br />P.S. Midazolam ampoules in my 3rd world country is HARD to get, hardest benzodiazepine to get. They alone give you a rush and very calm feeling inside, like a body high. Now if I get methamphetamine I will have to go asking and asking my family doctor to write a script for benzodiazepine which is used to calm patient before operations... :D .. Well if Diazepam/methamphetamine (street rubbish) was very GOOD with crystal i will be able to do proper trip reports for the archives of Silkroad.<br /><br />HM thread didn&#039;t start nice my point of this thread is to experience speedballs that not so much people have tried. Is anyone else into IV methamphetamine? I know there&#039;s benzodiazepine ampoules here on silkroad too so don&#039;t be shy and share your experiences. i did methamphetamine/heroin and it isn&#039;t that nice as methamphetamine/benzodiazepines. Now i can&#039;t wait to get reply If I&#039;m getting crystal meth. If i am then I&#039;m gonna go source midazolams right away.

				In conclusion combining large doses of benzos or IV benzos can cause what&#039;s called &quot;benzo blackout&quot;. You&#039;ll feel sober from meth but will do stupid shit/talk stupid bullshit you&#039;ll regret the next day. Althouth meth high was awesome.
