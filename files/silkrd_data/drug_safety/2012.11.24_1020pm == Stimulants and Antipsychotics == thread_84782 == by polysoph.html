				A few weeks ago I&#039;ve been prescribed an antipsychotic (Abilify) and I&#039;m wondering how or if it at all inhibits the effects of stimulants, especially Amphetamine. I occasionally take Amphe on weekends or in very little doses for studying. The prescription has nothing to do with drug issues though, it&#039;s mainly because of obsessive thoughts/circular thinking. I also take antidepressants additionally, but they&#039;ve been said to rather intensify stimulants effects, respectively soften the comedown.<br />Thanks

				I&#039;ve been taking Ability (2mg/day) for several weeks and I haven&#039;t noticed any changes to the effects of amphetamine, other than that it tends to even out my energy levels in general. Lately I&#039;ve been taking the latter fairly regularly.<br /><br />Wikipedia says Ability somewhat intensifies the euphoric effects of amphetamine and decreases those of cocaine. I haven&#039;t experienced this, but my dose of Abilify is rather low.<br /><br />Abilify is a dopamine partial agonist, but I&#039;m not experienced enough to know what kind of interactions this would cause.<br /><br />My psychiatrist says there shouldn&#039;t be any dangerous interaction.

				Think twice before you mix stuff like that. I once mixed amytriptaline (spelling? better known as elavil) alongside some amph one time and I spent the entire night curled in a ball in my shower screaming/crying cuz my back itched so bad. It literally felt like I had fire ants crawling under my skin. It got to a point where I was semi contemplating taking a knife and just goin to town on my back to get rid of the itchiness. Needless to say I will never do anything like that again... Those anti depressants are some fucked up drugs. I have two suggestions:<br /><br />1.) Consider if you have issues that you think could get worse with amphetamine use... I&#039;ve had some dark times where I turned to amps to try and forget about the world/my problems... just made it worse though... much worse.<br /><br />2.) If you absolutely must get that speed, is it worth risking a mixture with a chemical that really isn&#039;t experimented with too much (ie there is not widespread mixing of these 2 items). On a mixture like this you really don&#039;t know how your body is gonna react nor does you psychiatrist. You could have an awesome time or you could wind up taking a knife to your back to scrape off the skin... who knows?! lol<br /><br />Hope you feel better though whatever it is with the psych...<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Pink
