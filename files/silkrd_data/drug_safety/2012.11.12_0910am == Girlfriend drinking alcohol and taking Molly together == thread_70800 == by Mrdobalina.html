				So I&#039;ve told her this is not a good idea at all but it&#039;s hard for her to not drink initially (it&#039;s a social thing). <br /><br />What happens is that if she gets drunk then has some Molly she can&#039;t remember anything the next day of the night before. <br /><br />What is causing the memory loss?<br /><br />I&#039;ve said from now on if she is drinking she can&#039;t be on anything.

				I read sometime ago that alcohol affects the short term memory that&#039;s why when you get completely wasted you remember roughly what you did the night before.<br />Molly could also play a role in your girlfriend&#039;s situation but I think it&#039;s mainly because of alcohol.<br /><br />‘Our study&#039;s findings suggest that some people are more likely to experience alcohol-induced blackouts than others due to the way alcohol affects brain activity in areas involved in self-monitoring, attention, and working memory,’ said Reagan R. Wetherill of the University of California, San Diego.<br /><br /><br />

				But if we look at instances of when she gets drunk to a similar degree (without taking any other drugs), she doesn&#039;t have a problem remembering the night before - even though she may not want to!

				You may have already told her not to mix alcohol and MDMA anymore, but... tell her again. Very seriously. Sipping a single drink while rolling is one thing, but being drunk, she is asking for big-time neurotoxicity. Brain damage. When you combine alcohol and MDMA, the neurotoxic effects of each are amplified. Her memory loss may be a sign of this effect. She has to ask herself, aside from the memory loss, what else in her brain might be affected by this combination?<br /><br />You really need to get her to understand this and drive home the seriousness of what she&#039;s doing. She&#039;s being reckless with her health and will regret it later if she doesn&#039;t change this pattern immediately. I&#039;m sure she&#039;s young and feels invincible-- she is not.

				Drinking too much alcohol can and does cause alcohol induced blackouts where people just dont remember anything ...Far too common here in Ireland , you say she drinks and then takes some mollys, can you move the molly when she is drinking, the other issue is that Molly dehydrates the body mixing alcohol with MDMA is generally a bad idea, not only because the drink nullifies the effects of the MDMA, but also because when on MDMA (particularly at a club) it is important to keep hydrated, but excessive alcohol consumption will dehydrate you&nbsp; so that combined with alcohol could cause complications for her liver, which happened to a mate of mine.<br /><br />Some more links<br />&nbsp;http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/626787-Molly-Alcohol-Recovery-Help<br />

				Excess alcohol and a strong amount of molly will definetly cause a blackout its pretty much a fact. She has to back of the alcohol simple as. Its happened to me before and it makes for a regretful night, I have no idea why she would want to continue blacking out ?

				As other people saids, it depend of how your brain react to alcool and mdma.<br /><br />I remember one party, where i had sex time with a girl who was drunk and took 0.2+ mdma (same for me).<br />For me , my memory was not clear, but remember the xxx time.<br />For her, she could not rememory the sexe time until i gave her some crispy details about what we does together.<br /><br />It&#039;s only one story of what i experienced when girl took MDMA + Alcool.<br />If you care about the girl, then, ask her to not mix anything, just focus on one drug is enough :)

				If I take mdma sometimes I throw up. I don&#039;t get sick, I don&#039;t feel nauseous. I just throw up for whatever reason, it feels good afterwords but it&#039;s always freaked my boyfriend out. He drinks quite frequently on mdma and I have never seen any ill effects, it more or less just doesn&#039;t effect him (he&#039;s a huge guy). So I guess it&#039;s really just body chemistry. I&#039;m to understand that drinking and mdma together is not advisable but really taking mdma or alcohol at ALL isn&#039;t advisable if you really care about your health so much. Either or, body chemistry is key. Know your body!
