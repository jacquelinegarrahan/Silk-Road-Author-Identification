				quick question here....<br /><br />k has always been the drug i have the strongest love / hate relationship with. <br /><br />ive only done maybe 3 gramms in my life and usually use K for a specific purpose. <br /><br />yesterday night i did inject 45ish mg in my upper leg muscle. the injection was done professionally and i used K from a bottle i did use befor.<br /><br />still i feel very weird today. over slept, couldn&#039;t eat much, sport was very unproductive. never had that happen to me before on K. and done much higher doses as well.<br /><br />usually i am better off afterwards psychologically whan taking a psychoactive the right way. also not the case.<br /><br />any ideas?<br /><br />thanks!

				Sometimes this happens to me with opiates or benzos in my system with MXE, but usually doesn&#039;t carry over to the next day.<br />How are you feeling now?

Something you will have to work out your own solution too.

				In the past I&#039;ve felt that ketamine was easily one of the most amazing drugs but after some more recent experiences I don&#039;t have any interest in it unless I&#039;m high off methylone or a mephedrone-like chemical.<br /><br />Still, it is definitely am amazing chemical.

				Hopefully your feeling better mate,<br />As a long time on/off user of K, I sometimes have bad days, often from dodgy sleeping patterns etc.<br />I wouldn&#039;t worry to much, especially as it was from a vial you had used previously without any probs.<br />I would try snorting, its not to bad and much more manageable, it could be that some has stayed in your muscle and is slowly metabolizing into norketamine still, this has the effect of making you feel groggy.<br /><br />Peace.<br />(this is my first post in the big boys forum!)

				I would say that you possibly got a touch of cotton fever (note it is possible to get through both IยดV and IยดM, though very rare IยดM) . Did you notice a slightly elevated temp in the morn? <br />ACE
