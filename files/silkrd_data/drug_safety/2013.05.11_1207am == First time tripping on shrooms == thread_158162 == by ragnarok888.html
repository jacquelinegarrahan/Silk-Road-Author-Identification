				Hi.<br /><br />Next weekend will be my first time tripping on shrooms. I&#039;ve done my research and the consensus seems to be that first-timers should consume 1.5 to 2.0 grams. So I&#039;m planning and weighing that amount out and distributing to each of my friends who will be partaking.<br /><br />What can I expect to get from 1.5 to 2 grams? It doesn&#039;t seem like that much to me and I don&#039;t want to disappoint everyone with a weak trip. But maybe I&#039;m wrong. Any other trip enhancement/safety tips/suggestions would also be appreciated.<br /><br />Also, setting:<br />We will be outdoors camping in a wooded area remote from civilization when we trip. Also, I have compiled a playlist of trip music I have seen recommended on other forums that we will be listening to and we will have a sober babysitter. Does this sound good?

				Don&#039;t create unrealistic expectations for the trip night, just take it slow and ease into it, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re well prepared.<br /><br />What will the condition of the shrooms be, dried out or fresh? Dried out is the best and most potent, I&#039;ve never had a &quot;psychedelic&quot; trip on fresh magic mushrooms. How will you be taking your shrooms? Sugar/honey/syrup invigorates the effects of shrooms slightly. What I did was to grate (with a cheese grater) the shrooms onto four sandwiches which contained syrup and peanut butter for me and three friends. This helped with the ingestion of the nasty tasting shrooms and strengthens the effect somewhat. <br /><br />I can&#039;t comment on the weight as I had shrooms quite some time ago. One grow kit (sold legally in the UK at one point) between four people was more than enough for a nice strong trip, provided it&#039;s cured or dried out. But I can&#039;t tell you how much such a grow kit yielded in terms of weight.<br /><br />Setting sounds absolutely perfect!

				I would consider making tea if I were you. Why not throw in some lemon-tek while you are at it. Crush the shrooms in to a powder and mix it with a litte lime or lemon juice for 30mim before consumption. This converts psilocybin to psilocin. In theory this should make the shrooms more potent. <br />Personally I have only taken shrooms twice (both lemon-tek), so personally I not have &quot;experience&quot; at all to back this up. Look up lemon-tek on shroomery to read about it yourself. Tea is awesome because it tastes great, you do not have to consume the actual shrooms (of you do not want to) and the comeup is more rapid. <br />

				Depends on the shroom. If they were grown by someone who loved and cared for them, and picked them before the veil broke, then a gram should do it. If they were mass produced for weight, the veil broke and kept growing. 2-2.5 grams. When the veil breaks, the mushroom stops producing psyclobin.<br /><br />Outside camping sounds like a good ole scared jesus christ im going to die night.

				be sure to have some food or drink with lots of sugar, or pure sugar with you, just in case as it&#039;s your first time, if a mushroom trip turns to the bad site, eating lots of sugar will drastically and rather fast reduce the psychedelic effects, in case anything goes wrong.<br /><br />Wish you a good trip!&nbsp; Shrooms are awesome!

I have done this a few times so I can definitely vouch for this. There was one time I had an uneasy trip, physically, not mentally. A large glass of orange juice sorted me very quickly and calmed me down. This was before I knew about benzos. I would strongly recommend having a few Alprazolam(Xanax) or Zolpidem(Ambien) at hand, these will rescue you for sure in case things take a wrong turn.<br /><br />I agree that eating a nice full meal beforehand is a very good idea.<br /><br />Also, have a look on www.erowid.org for many good anecdotes on drug experiences, do&#039;s and dont&#039;s with recipes and combinations. <br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Mushrooms.shtml<br />http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_prep1.shtml<br />http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_prep2.shtml<br /><br />+1 on the tea idea, I&#039;ve done this too and it worked great, loads of sugar yeah!

				Ahh, I remember my first trip, 2g of mushrooms I grew my self. Ground them up and put them into a shot glass with cranberry juice.<br /><br />How about a little advice.<br /><br />Inside or outside is all dependent on where you feel the most comfortable. Mine was inside but that is just me. It needs to be a place where you are comfortable and feel safe.<br /><br />As to planning, I can not count the number of times I planned a trip. Not a single one went to plan! Things you thought you would like while tripping turn out to be boring and the smallest things will catch your eye. It is hard to explain. <br />I would suggest that you plan your music! Take a lot of time, listening to songs and asking your self how that song makes you feel. It is important to get the right music for the trip and only you can decide on what is the right music. Make sure to have enough music as well, 6 to 10 hours should be enough to get you through the tip.<br /><br />Never fight a trip! No matter how it goes, just let go and let it take you where you need to go. If you fight it, you&#039;ll never win!

				Best advice I can give is for you to relax, while tripping. <br />It&#039;s easy to become anxious, and then you end up in a battle against what&#039;s happening to you. Which is just a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />Go with the flow - is an appropriate term I believe.

				Thanks for the advice everybody. I think I&#039;m gonna pre-portion 1.5g for everybody to start with and 1.0 g to take after a couple of hours if we want to. This is what the seller recommended I do. Can&#039;t wait!

				I have also got my first pack of Texas/shrooms... and am thinking of what would be a good setting. <br /><br />I bought the licorice tea from a store here. made a very coarse powder from the shrooms, measured 1gm packets, <br />and have substituted about 50% of the tea with shrooms in each tea bag, made a few packets like that.<br />I can hence control how much I want to take. <br /><br />I am planing to be home and watch some non-violent or erotic move (not porn). as I trip.

				I think you&#039;ve got the right plans.&nbsp; Whenever I take psychedelics I always try to get as far away form civilization as possible.&nbsp; A remote place in the beauty of nature is idea.&nbsp; Also, mushrooms are most visual at night, so that is also a nice plan.&nbsp; Have you ever taken a psychedelic before?&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ever taken acid you&#039;ll find mushrooms less intense and not as profound, but still very nice.&nbsp; I also like your idea of taking a moderate dose to begin with and then boosting the dose once you&#039;ve got a handle on it and feel you would like more.&nbsp; A mushroom trip is considerably shorter than acid, so I think you&#039;ll be able to know whether you want more an hour after taking the initial dose.&nbsp; Also, re/ food, I would suggest not tripping on a full stomach.&nbsp; Eat at least 2 hours before you trip.&nbsp;

				I would do 3.5g.... 160mcg LSD was far too little for my first time. I&#039;ll likely do 5g+ of shrooms on my first use.<br /><br />The main &quot;problem&quot; psychedelic is DMT. Valium cannot help because the trip will end before it even kicks in, and you cant control it in any way.<br /><br />Shrooms/LSD are far superior, if not as powerfully &quot;trippy&quot;, as DMT.
