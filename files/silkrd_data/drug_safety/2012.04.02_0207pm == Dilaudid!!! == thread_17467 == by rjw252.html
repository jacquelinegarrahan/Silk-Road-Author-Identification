				Saw two people ask about Dilaudid (hydromorphone) yesterday, so I thought I would throw my two cents in.&nbsp; <br /><br />I definitely do not agree on spending the money on them for anything but Iv&#039;ing them.&nbsp; I&#039;m an average user of opiates, usually take 3-5 hydrocodone/oxycodone 10&#039;s and get a pretty decent buzz.&nbsp; In my experience,you will literally have to snort 12-20mgs to just get a little buzzd taken them orally is even worse.&nbsp; You can look up the conversion rate on those narcotic calculators.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure there is another drug with such wide range of effects from IV&#039;ing to orally to snorting them.&nbsp; Now Iv&#039;ing them will rock your world.&nbsp; 4mg dilly for me is compared to 60 of oxy, maybe even a better rush but does not last as long.&nbsp; I just looked up the conversion rate and here it goes.<br /><br />4mg Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) IV&nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;58.00mg oxycodone orally<br />4mg Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) oral =&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;11mg&nbsp; oxycodone orally<br /><br />Huge difference.&nbsp; The website conversion calculator is on the website below.<br />http://www.globalrph.com/narcotic.cgi<br /><br />Check out oxymorphone (Opana) conversions if you want to see some crazy potency when IV&#039;d compared to oxycodone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bottom line though, I wouldn&#039;t buy them for anything buy IV&#039;ing.&nbsp; Hope this helps.

				Yep im with you. I dont IV any drug and recently bought some dillies from the road. I crushed and snorted em expecting to have my world rocked and barely caught a buzz. <br /><br />At least I can cross them off my list as ive been wanting to try them for a long time.<br /><br />Opana, FUCK YEA! Love it!

				IMO you HAVE to IV Dillys, otherwise if you can&#039;t/won&#039;t it is a COMPLETE waste of time. If that&#039;s the case for you don&#039;t even waste your money on them, you could put that toward a much better opioid. Conversely, if you WILL IV them, you will get just about the most intense rush you have experienced. Dilly sucks on legs, so you&#039;ll be turning yourself into a pincushion, but some people dig that. Not me... Unless I can get K4&#039;s I don&#039;t even consider it.
