But have been very scared of trying it.<br /><br />So I decided to buy 10 tabs of 150ug LSD. Got it in the mail 3 days later then did some serious research on it. I have read about LSD before but if I was going to try it then I was determined to do some heavy research into it so I spent a few days doing that.<br /><br />Ended up booking 5 days off work and picked a day where I would be alone for 12+ hours.<br /><br />I know what everyone says if you trip do it with people you trust...But all my friends would tell me drugs are evil and there not as open minded. I love my friends but they just wouldn&#039;t understand.<br /><br />But with that said I took a lot of precautions before starting my trip.<br /><br />My safety list (Before I started my trip I did everything on this list)<br /><br />#1 Keep sharp objects out of reach in rooms where you will be tripping<br />#2 Unplug your phone + mobile<br />#3 Don&#039;t go out side in public on your first trip (I wanted to do this but knew it would be a bad idea if I did)<br />#4 Make sure all your doors are locked windows closed<br />#5 Keep music volume at a reasonable level don&#039;t want people coming over complaining<br />#6 Keep benzos handy. It wont abort the trip but may calm you down if you get to over stimulated or paranoid.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">I just want to say from my first LSD experience I think the most important part about having a good trip is </code><br />#1 be in a Good/Happy mood this is a must!<br />#2 be excited about the trip!<br />#3 remember it&#039;s just a drug it&#039;s not going to kill you<br />#4 What ever happens your going to be ok<br />#5 You are not in control accept this don&#039;t let it scare you – The more you try to control the visuals the more scary it gets. Just let the visuals&nbsp; /breath/flow<br />#6 Once you&#039;ve taken the tab there is no turning back! You must accept this<br /><br />During my whole trip I decided to document my whole trip experience in a text log in hopes that it would help me and other&#039;s better understand the trip and give people better insight into the effects of lsd.<br /><br />Before I post the log below I just wanted to say that I have no regrets about my trip and that it has been one of the best experiences of my life. It has changed my life so much in a way I see things with such a different perspective now.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">Trip Log<br /><br />13:30 Took blotter on tongue 150ug also got 60mg of diazepam handy if something goes wrong. It wont abort the trip but Might calm me down if need be. I don&#039;t see this happening<br /><br />13:38 Just double checking to make sure all sharp objects are not in my reach :)<br /><br />13:56 been listening to music to keep a calm mood and chill just let the lsd to it&#039;s Work. No turning back now :) I feel good about this :)<br /><br />13:58 Turned on my lava lamp about 30 min ago hope it makes for good visuals<br /><br />14:11 I feel very relaxed just listening to music :)<br /><br />14:23 listing to more music fell very relaxed having fun. I think time might be slowing down<br /><br />14:34 I feel inner peace with my-self and who I am<br /><br />14:43 I see the flow music = old friends old friend&#039;s = love :) It all flows together music people love<br /><br />14:48 I fell strange I think it&#039;s starting to kick in, I keep rubbing by feet on the floor and love it. everything fells so light ,real<br /><br />14:57 it&#039;s starting. I fell real connected I keep rubbing my feet on the floor I have socks on that make a cool sound. I enjoy listing to my feet rub on the floor more than the music it&#039;s more real .<br /><br />15:01:33 I feel sight confused but I know I am ok and going to be just fine. Going to stop log now...But will update when if something/cool/different happens.<br /><br />time is slowing down<br /><br />15:17 [EDITED after trip for SECURITY] log entry for 15:17 had be be removed something funny happened but if I made it public it could make my identify more traceable sry :/.<br /><br />15:17[RELATED TO EDITED EVENT] also double-checked if all my house doors where locked and phone unplug..

				Congratulations on your trip. Glad you liked it. Wow, you were exceptionally worked up about this. Hiding the knives? lol, it&#039;s only LSD :)<br /><br />So, you did a hit, you know the characteristic LSD experience. Some tingly sensations, waviness, time distortion, that trippy cool sensation of the interconnectedness of all things, yes? But there&#039;s another level, attainable depending on your current level of tolerance. If you&#039;d have done 2 of those, being your first time, you&#039;d probably just hit on it. I think of it as getting puddled. Some people may refer to it as &quot;mind-fucked&quot;. It is a little intimidating, I guess, but also something many of us find extremely purifying. Kind of like dying and being reborn again. And, yea, a little scary like that but really no more so than coming to grips with the reality of the certainty of death. I think of it as dissolution of the ego. And you really get a heavy dose of that interconnectedness of all things. You get a really strong sense that there&#039;s definitely something, some kind of existence after death and that it&#039;s completely unlike anything we&#039;ve ever imagined before. And it&#039;s beautiful. That&#039;s why a more experienced LSD user won&#039;t be afraid to drop a 10 strip (if they know its really LSD, got to know the stuff first). 3, 4 or 5 even might not get us puddled properly, ya now, if you&#039;re doing it every other weekend or so. But if a 10 strip don&#039;t get you puddled? Yo: it&#039;s time to take a break.<br />Sex is also very cool on LSD.

				Man, I remember my first acid trip. It was awesome. My girlfriend turned into one of the characters from the video game Infamous 2, and everything turned into spiders, but it didn&#039;t scare me. Also my girlfriend painted and it was awesome. We ended up on Chatroulette in the nude (without showing our faces obviously), and she gave me the best blowjob of my life. The guy watching us was just like&nbsp; ???, then&nbsp; :o, then&nbsp; :P, and finally&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D.

				Fun report, SpeedCrunch.&nbsp; Keeping the log while you did it was inspired.&nbsp; &quot;The lava lamp was pissing me off.&quot;&nbsp; I get that, I totally do.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;ve had two acid trips now.&nbsp; My first was a year ago -- my girlfriend set it up for my birthday present.&nbsp; It was just the two of us, in my apartment, very romantic and very safe environment.&nbsp; We walked around the gardens in my community for a bit, I saw more stars in the sky than I actually saw, and I was able to stare at a reflection of buildings in the pond until I could cancel out the ripples with my mind and see a crystal clear image.&nbsp; We also got naked and painted ourselves, using glow-in-the-dark paint so it was just as fun to shower it off in the dark.<br /><br />Notable quotes from that evening:<br /><br />* &quot;I keep stopping to analyze myself.&nbsp; What do you think that says about me?&quot;<br />* &quot;&#039;Woo&#039; is a color between indigo and duck.&quot;<br />* &quot;That tree looks TOTALLY three-dimensional!&nbsp; No, I know it is, but it LOOKS three-dimensional!&quot;<br /><br /><br />...My second acid trip was just this past Friday.&nbsp; My girlfriend&#039;s out of state now, so I gave it to _myself_ for a birthday present and invited some friends.&nbsp; One was a very close friend who&#039;d helped me get through a bad night with ecstasy before; he&#039;d never tried acid and I felt I owed him something good. Another was a girl I had only connected with a week or so before, but it was a good week and we were feeling close already.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)&nbsp; (My girlfriend and I are polyamorous; this wasn&#039;t cheating, everyone knew and was good with it.)&nbsp; We each took 2.5 to 3 tabs of the Ganesh LSD that asbjorn is selling here.<br /><br />Much sexier time.&nbsp; Half the night was pretty much an extended threesome.&nbsp; She fucked us both, and I felt like I could focus all the physical sensation of my body into my fingertips, or my cock, or whatever part of me was having fun at the time.&nbsp; She was also pretty submissive, and I was feeling quite powerful myself.&nbsp; This dominance/submission dynamic was already being hinted at before the trip, so I didn&#039;t feel like I wasn&#039;t abusing the situation by taking advantage of it.&nbsp; I enjoyed turning her on by having her feed me, or kiss my feet, or blow my friend, or whatever I wanted her to do.<br /><br />We did leave the apartment once.&nbsp; The girl&#039;s a smoker and had forgotten to bring cigarettes, and was starting to worry about nicotine cravings ruining the latter part of her trip.&nbsp; So she and I walked to the BP at the corner, about five minutes away.&nbsp; It went fine, but both of us admitted later to being really nervous.&nbsp; I was able to speak and think all right, but the world felt disconnected, so the simple act of buying stuff felt REALLY STRANGE.&nbsp; I was sure everyone in the store knew we were on drugs (and I think the cashier did look a bit freaked out) but I had no idea what signs we were giving off.&nbsp; I just remember that when I was handing money over and getting change back, I kept thinking, &quot;Am I doing this right?&nbsp; Is this how this works?&quot;<br /><br />On the way there and the way back, the girl wanted to walk behind me.&nbsp; Submissive instincts again.&nbsp; I enjoyed that.<br /><br />We all took excessive care of each other, and reminded each other constantly to drink some water, or move around a bit if we were still too long, etc.&nbsp; Late in the night, when we were coming down, we smoked some pot and watched a bit of Ruby Gloom.&nbsp; Nobody slept until about sunrise, and then it was only for an hour or two.&nbsp; The next day I was completely exhausted, and grateful that I&#039;d made sure I had nothing I had to do.<br /><br />Notable quote:<br /><br />Her: &quot;Suddenly the sixties make total sense!&nbsp; ALL of the sixties!&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Yeah, but they thought so in the sixties, too...&quot;<br /><br />Great time.&nbsp; Oh: and the girl and I are talking about seriously dating now, and probably having a master/slave dynamic continue.&nbsp; So I can&#039;t say acid made us do anything we wouldn&#039;t have done otherwise.&nbsp; If anything it just helped us get there a bit faster.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br /><br />I like the insights from acid.&nbsp; I want to keep doing it.&nbsp; Not OFTEN.&nbsp; It&#039;s too exhausting.&nbsp; But I definitely feel like it&#039;s led to positive experiences for me.<br /><br />

				Thanks so much for that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been so scared to try acid but your report kind of chills me out about it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve wanted to do it for so long but I&#039;m a product of 80s LSD propaganda so I&#039;ve always just been scared to do it.&nbsp; Your report sounds like it was a really great time.&nbsp; Can you PM and tell me who you bought from so I know it&#039;s safe acid (you were the guinea pig)?

Now you know what I&#039;m talkin about :)<br />Getting puddled can be fun, but that&#039;s where you have to be a little more careful about your surroundings. I mean, you&#039;re not gonna freakout with a knife or anything like that (unless maybe you&#039;re already a psycho) but you could pretty easily leave a stove on or knock over candles or something. So, like no deep-frying anything and no candles :) I think you&#039;ll find you don&#039;t really have much interest in food anyway, but a spicy cup of tea is really nice. Boil it up first then just leave it warming. Bay leaves, 2 or 3 cloves, stick of cinnamon, plenty of cardamom seeds and a chunk of ginger, boiled thoroughly, and poured over a tea bag with some freshly squeezed lime. mmmm mmmm, good with or without the LSD, lol.<br /><br />If you have any MDMA, together they&#039;re just amazing. Warning though, it will diminish your appreciation of the chemicals individually. Because, together, its like a whole new world, lol. Just totally amazing.

				Hey SpeedCrunch,<br /><br />Absolutely fascinating - Thanks for the heads up of your trip log from my Benzo &amp; LSD thread.<br /><br />The first two dud tabs I took were off on a whim but having read your log, I&#039;ll have to put a little more effort into a few areas of concern.<br /><br />These are personal to me and surround light/moderate feeling of anxiety - dealt with currently with an SSRI.<br /><br />I feel confident in my abilities to be conscious that while tripping, I am taking a drug and therefore any adverse will aside in a few hours. I&#039;m probably more agitated about the thought of my gf having a bad trip - there&#039;s no reason to think she would and if anything, she&#039;s probably more mentally grounded than me.<br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />Look forward to following your threads later.

I have read somewhere that it could cause what is called serotonin syndrome.<br /><br />I am not 100% on this so you may want to ask around on the forums about Antidepressant&#039;s and lsd.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				I haven&#039;t heard that using LSD with an SSRI could cause serotonin syndrome... just that the SSRI could diminish the effects of LSD, so you may need to take a higher dose.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken LSD multiple times when I was on an SSRI and didn&#039;t notice any difference, but I think the LSD I took was pretty strong (ie one hit = tripping balls for 12 hours).

				At first I expected this to be an annoyance to read but I caught myself smiling quite a bit while reading the log lol. And it actually persuades me a bit to do it alone rather than taking it with people. Thanks for the great thread though!
