				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be going to a couple of 3 day festivals in the coming months. I&#039;m wondering what my best bet for enjoying the three days to the fullest, while still being safe, is.<br /><br />MDMA I know should only be taken once per every 1-2 months. I&#039;ve heard people drop it all 3 days regardless, how is that even possible? I&#039;m definitely going to take it one of the nights, but I wish I could take it all three.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in 2C-B as well. Probably going to drop around 15 mg so the trip isn&#039;t as heavy and I can still enjoy the performances.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the kind of plan I had in mind:<br /><br />Day 1 - Alcohol only.<br /><br />Day 2 - Drop 15 mg 2C-B around mid-late afternoon, maybe alcohol?<br /><br />Day 3 - Drop 150-175mg MDMA at around 6-7PM to last until 12PM. (Will be preloading/postloading.)<br /><br />Any suggestions for my plan? Should I flip anything around, is there anything I can do more of and still be fine?

I would also limit your alcohol consumption leading up to doing this in order to avoid a hangover affecting your trip. Be sure you eat plenty of healthy food (fruits, vegetables, soup) both before and after tripping and pump yourself with liquids (within moderation). May I ask what you will be pre and postloading with? Also, do you have access to any LSD? LSD is one of the greatest substances for festivals in my experience.

				Take the MDMA and then the 2c-b following, the tollerance from the 2c-b might mess up the MDMA.

				You could substitute Kratom for alcohol on the first day.<br /><br />You could smoke some DMT whenever. <br /><br />LSD or mushrooms could also be taken as opposed to 2C-B to avoid cross-tolerance with MDMA.

Yes, take it 30 minutes prior to rolling. And unfortunately you must have 100 posts in order to hand out karma. In any case, I&#039;m glad I could help you! Have a fantastic time, my friend. Good vibes to you. :)
