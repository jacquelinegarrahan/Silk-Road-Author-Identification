				Title: <strong>Diazepam Powder Use</strong><br />

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a regular Benzo (mainly Diazepam) user for years, however never had it in powder form. I am very tempted to order some, I just have a couple of questions someone might be able to help with.<br /><br />Firstly, What is the best way to take it? dissolve under the tongue? If so I usually find this so fiddly with powder and awkward - any tips on the easiest way to do it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Secondly, Can it be mixed in a solution and drunk - if so what is the best liquid to mix it with?<br /><br />Other than that how else can it be taken? <br /><br />Thank you very much in advance.<br /><br />J1980.

				hi!<br />i had a gram of diazepam powder once and ended up putting most of it in 50mg capsules because its pretty hard to make a solution with household solvents. <br />if you dont want to cap it, putting your dose under your tounge, maybe with a little sugar and letting it melt in your mouth is an allright option. taking benzos sublingual doesnt really change the bioavailability, but can provide a great placebo effect and slightly improve the time till it takes effect, especially if your stomach is full.&nbsp; <br /><br />making a solution was really tricky. in 95% ethanol it would not properly dissolve at 250mg/25ml. there always was some at the bottom. what kind worked was isopropanol 99% (also 250mg/25ml), but only if you stored it somewhere moderately warm and shook it well before you got your dose out of the vial. in such small amounts, consuming IPA is no big deal. if it still bothers you, it evaporates very, very fast. if you want to drink it, you can first put the diazepam solution in a whisky glass (or something with a similar large bottom surface), stir it for a minute and add some juice to chug it down. the stirring should get rid of most of the IPA. <br /><br />in general: unless you get a really sweet deal on the diazepam powder, have a good scale or access to better solvents; keep using pills, its all not worth the hassle :) <br /><br />

				Thanks for the advice tedka - appreciate it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered some off googleyed as it&#039;s had great feedback - just gotta work out the best way to take it&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I guess if I don&#039;t have any capsules around the house I could just bomb it in a rizzla paper? <br /><br />Out of curiosity can you inject it?&nbsp;

				yes, a paperchute will do. <br /><br />if you want something you can safely inject you need propylene glycol to dissolve the diazepam properly and not have your veins fucked up by isopropanol or huge amounts of ethanol. injecting benzos isnt much different from sublingual/oral use though, with a few exceptions. temazepam/midazolam in the same gun with an opioid of your choice is pretty good. diazepam has barely any difference in different ROAs, the only reason to not swallow/let it melt in your mouth is being too incapacitated or resistant to do so :P

				Thanks pal.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll stick to parachuting it then&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I just find trying to put loose powder under my tongue very awkward - how exactly do you do it without powder falling off etc. Do you have a good technique you could share with me?<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions - but you seem like a very knowledgeable guy.

				no problem, glad to help, better than having people running around doing stupid stuff :P<br /><br />before i ended up capping the diazepam powder i just licked my finger, put it on the pile on the scale, licked my finger again, took a sip of juice (any juice will do) and started squishing it around in my mouth till it felt all dry and &quot;pelted&quot;. if you put like 50mg of something with such bad solubility as diazepam in your mouth and distribute it evenly, there will be a certain sensation of dryness in your mouth. when this was archived, i swallowed the juice.<br /><br />by the way, this is a great method to dose anything that doesnt qualify as an emetic in terms of taste or has horrible potency (not advised for properly dosed mdma or mephedrone). with most 2cs you can even save up to 50% of material for same(ish) effects, DOx compounds will start having effects withing a couple of minutes.<br />10mg of 2ce dosed in that manner will have similar effects as 20mg in a stomach working on a small meal. effects will also be &quot;undeniable&quot; in less than 15 minutes, rather than more than 45.

				Excellent.<br /><br />You&#039;re are star, I really appreciate your time in helping me out.<br /><br />If I knew how the karma system worked and how to give it you&#039;d definitely get some&nbsp; :D<br /><br />This is the product I have ordered:<br /><br />&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/48a771fc96<br /><br />What does the &#039;please be cautious as this is active at just 5mg&#039; exactly mean - does it simply mean 5mg of powder is the equivalent of a 5mg pill?&nbsp;

				yes, pretty much (equivalence to pills)<br /><br />i dont know what your daily dose is, but if you are beyond 20mg/day you can just whip out your cheapo battery scale for determining your dose, in that range +-2mg dont really make a difference to the experienced user.

				Presently I&#039;m taking about 6-8 blues every other day (in one dose)......However the MSJ and generic ones from here I&#039;m taking about 10-12 at a time - I just want real blues, like the roche one&#039;s from the chemist! <br /><br />So I&#039;m guessing the gram of powder won&#039;t last long&nbsp; :(
