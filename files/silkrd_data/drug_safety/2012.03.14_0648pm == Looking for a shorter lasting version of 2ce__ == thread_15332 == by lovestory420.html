				2c-e tends to last around 6-8 hours for me, which is a good portion of a day, but pretty short as far as tripping standards go.&nbsp; Mushrooms are similar in duration to 2c-e, LSD lasts 8-12 hours, and DOx can last significantly longer.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think of anything similar to 2c-e in the 1-4 hour range.&nbsp; Using the lemon tek on a dose of mushrooms seems to make it a more intense, shorter experience, but I wouldn&#039;t consider mushrooms that similar to 2c-e.<br /><br />The other two options I can think of for short trips:<br />1. DMT or salvia--these can both be smoked for a very short trip (~5-20 minutes), but they are very different from 2c-e.&nbsp; They both tend to be pretty intense, if you smoke a large enough dose, you&#039;ll &quot;break through,&quot; where you&#039;ll have ego loss, full-on hallucinations, etc.<br />2. Insufflation (snorting/sniffing) 2c-e itself--I don&#039;t really recommend this.&nbsp; It will burn like a motherfucker, the trip will come on fast, and accurate dosing is very important.&nbsp; Some people have died by snorting too much 2c-b, and 2c-e has similar toxicity.&nbsp; Please refer to erowid.org for dosing information before attempting this.<br /><br />Maybe someone else will think of a chemical I&#039;m forgetting that will suit your needs more directly.&nbsp; Good luck!
