				Considering its pure, I&#039;d say about 125mg each, especially because you sound a little inexperienced. If you don&#039;t have a milligram scale (which i recommend you getting if your gonna be buying drugs that are active at such doses) then divide it into 8 evenly seperated piles. <br /><br />Either put that in an empty gelcap an take with water, or if you dont have that, rip a corner off a tissue paper, or use a cigarette paper, and put the MDMA in the middle and fold it up and swallow it. <br /><br />Godspeed!<br /><br /><br />Oh, and if you buy MDMA you should also get a test kit. Even tho SR seems to have good MDMA, you never can be too sure. And its always fun testing drugs, you get to feel like Walter White and shit. <br /><br /><br /><br />http://dancesafe.org/products/testing-kits

				People in this thread have already covered dosage pretty well, so I&#039;ll go ahead and advise on accurate measuring.&nbsp; As mentioned, you would ideally use a mg scale (measures to 0.001 g).&nbsp; However, I bet you don&#039;t have one of those yet.&nbsp; So here&#039;s what you do:<br /><br />Weigh the product to ensure it&#039;s 1.0 g.&nbsp; Get some distilled water (not tap) and measure out a specific amount.&nbsp; Dump the MDMA into the water and stir it up.&nbsp; Now you have an MDMA solution of known concentration!&nbsp; You can measure out an amount of water and know that it contains an amount of MDMA.<br />Example: dump 1 g (1000 mg) into 1 L (1000 mL) of water.&nbsp; Every mL of water you measure out contains 1 mg of MDMA.&nbsp; So if you want to take 140 mg, measure out 140 mL and drink it.<br /><br />MDMA is very water soluble, so water works here.&nbsp; Other chemicals may not be water soluble, in which case you&#039;d need to use/add another liquid, like alcohol, or an acid or base.<br /><br />Store this solution short term in the refrigerator.&nbsp; Don&#039;t store this for many months, the product will probably deteriorate over time.

The other major metabolites are HMMA, HMA and MDA. <br />For pathology and forensics it&#039;s useful to see if MDMA degrades in urine and blood over time. It&#039;s a rock solid molecule though and is very stable to light, heat, pH, hydrolysis etc.<br /><br />**tordemon just beat me to that point^^<br /><br />I know it&#039;s not best practice but MDMA is fairly safe to eyeball. As the dose is around an 1/8th - 1/5 of a gram it&#039;s quite a lot of powder and so when crushed up finely, a gram can be fairly accurately cut up. Unlike say 2C-B, a +/-20% dose isn&#039;t going to be hugely different.
