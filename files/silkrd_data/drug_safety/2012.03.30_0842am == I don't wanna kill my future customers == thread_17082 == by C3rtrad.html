				Hi everyone, I&#039;m new on this place and it sound totally amazing, I&#039;ve only look and learn for two weeks and I&#039;m now ready to buy some C here ( the quality seems really amazing ! ) but I&#039;m going to sell some of my product and the coke here is maybe around 5-10% ( Amphet give me more pleasure .. ). So, my question is, how to cut ( a little ) my coke so my older customers ( Injection ) who&#039;ll probably don&#039;t trust me about the quality doesn&#039;t die with a 0.5g injection ( as usual for him. ) ?<br />Should I buy some Lidocaine ? Cafeine ? Are some sellers available for this ?<br /><br />Thanks and sorry for my English, I&#039;ll have to improve it a little ;)

				The visual appearance of high grade coke is completely different than than stuff thats been walked all over. If he dont trust you, have him trust his eyes.<br /><br />Or you could just sell him a tiny little bit and have him trust his personal experience with it.<br /><br />If you friend is so stupid as to totally ignore the advice of his dealer, and not make any effort to restrict his dose, he is probably better off dead because the human race is better off with out those types of people reproducing.<br />

				Yeah, I think you&#039;re right and just one line from this almost pure product maybe made him think twice about iv&#039;ing ( srry can&#039;t find other word ) 0.5g of that stuff ( he&#039;ll remember the price too I&#039;ll sell it for 200$ a g ).<br />Just don&#039;t want a dead body on my arms =) He is my only customer who IV coke and who I sell uncut prod ... Others will be very glad with 0.3g of C and 0.7 of lactose, I was just wondering cause I can&#039;t let inject so much milk powder in his veins.<br />Thanks for your answer, but were I am drug are so much cut you can&#039;t imagine imo and the way people think about drug purity is just ... bullshit !

				Yeah that is the problem with areas where quality is non-existent, people get so used to rinsing badly cut shit they think they are invincible not really understanding that they are buying crap. Then someone comes along with top quality and even if they are told they don&#039;t listen and snuff themselves out. <br /><br />I gave someone some 25I to sell the other week and they gave some to this girl, told her to go steady but she didn&#039;t listen and her mates ended up looking after her for the rest of the night. Dumb Fuck much?<br /><br />Just the way of the world though isn&#039;t it....?

				That&#039;s why i would never bother selling any powder substance. I&#039;ve never sold at all, but if i were to, i&#039;d only sell RX stuff. Stuff that is in mgs and people could check online and it came frrom a place where they are all the same quantity/quality. Cause if i was to sell, i wouldn&#039;t want to sell crap. I&#039;d really think of my customers and try to make them happy. so i&#039;d only sell quality. but what if i get those people that have been getting crap, and from experience, are a 3 bag shot kind of person (i know a few, doesn&#039;t matter what people tell them, they always do 3 bags, i&#039;ve witnessed it myself), and then here comes someone with even 60%-80% raw. and they think they are getting their regular 20%-30% crap and do 3 bag and then boom, they are a goner. Nope, i&#039;ll never sell h or c. That&#039;s how a dealer in NYC in the 70s became known for. his stuff for a little while went from 30-40% to 60or70% raw i think. and because of that, it killed a bunch of dope heads in nyc. like a wave, they were finding them in staircases, in their apartment. the bags all with the same stamps. So he had to start cutting it so he wouldn&#039;t kill the rest of his clientele, lol. i think his name was Frank Barnes. They even made a movie about him with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. People just don&#039;t listen and that&#039;s kind of sad. I always ask questions first. But i never really trust other users because sometimes their tolerance is not the same as yours. I used to hang out with this guy and he would always caution me about what we were getting. But all he needed was 1 bag (all the time, doesn&#039;t matter what). so i&#039;d always be disappointed when i used to listen to him and do 1 bag and nothing, lol.

				The dealer was Frank Lucas - he was jailed and cooperated with cops. He was a black dealer who actually went to Vietnam and done business with some defeated general (Vietnamese) who had remnants of his army growing poppies and producing heroin - the real pure deal! Straight from the jungle lab into kilo bricks and onto donkeys and boats. He shipped the heroin back in dead soldiers coffins. Thousands of US soldiers were using heroin there in the girly bars and brothels.<br /><br />I agree with not selling powder. In fact if drugs were legal we would just have pure levels accurately measured. <br /><br />I would also say that injecting drugs is not the way to go. Sadly I know that anyone who gets addicted to heroin for example will overcome the fear of injecting when they realize smoking heroin is not cost effective if your an addict and in the average financial position of not having much cash flow.<br /><br />The Frank Lucas connection saw heroin rated 100% pure bought over here. It was immediatly mixed but it was twice the purity of the best ever shit out there and cheaper also. I think it was called Blue Magic as Fran franchised the heroin and branded it. <br /><br />The movie kind of plays on the black independent businessman story for a while but the reality of the cheap and widely avaliable heroin did destroy communities and families. Had Frank Lucas imported lobsters or cheap suits then he would have been someone of note. <br /><br />Its one thing supplying a market but another to create it in your own community. <br /><br />Frank got caught by an honest cop who helped take down dozens of cops who were taking paybacks off the dealers. Prior to the Lucas heroin the USA had the cops seizing and reselling heroin cut down so much that many users would have spiked up twice. When the Lucas heroin came in its likely many were killed by overdoses. Not least because anyone mixing a kilo of 100 pure heroin with other powders cannot say what the purity of any given $10 deal might be! A clump of pure heroin can be sold easily. <br /><br />The movie is called American Gangster. The actual dealers were an ugly looking bunch but the movie not so.<br /><br />The Italians turned on Frank Lucas as he was undercutting them. <br /><br />Frank Lucas is out now - married for 40 years. He got all his cash taken. I guess he wishes he would have just sold lobsters.

				I watch that film all the time, it&#039;s fuckin&#039; A!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />And whilst I wouldn&#039;t sell H myself I don&#039;t have a problem selling powders, at the end of the day once you have said to someone &quot;Look this isn&#039;t your run-of-the-mill corner boy shite.&quot; you have said what you need to say. It&#039;s all about personal responsibility IMO. Like I said above I wouldn&#039;t sell H personally but each to their own and one must look after one&#039;s own affairs. <br /><br />

				Do not cut with lidocaine...it will/can immobilize the heart......resulting in death.&nbsp; Additionally, it is very common to have epinephrine in it as well, which would also be very bad.

				Yep I was actually thinking to American Gangster and his nearly pure H who killed so much people .. Was bad.<br />And for my prob, I&#039;ll just go to sell to close friends who arn&#039;t afraid to pay for quality &amp; just say to the iv guy I&#039;ve just mess with the deal. SR is just designed for personal consumption or close people deal but I&#039;ll cut the C a little anyway with lactose for my own security (non IV / Smoker customers)cause really, the product around me, is really bad and made me far away from coke for two years.<br />&amp; thanks for the advice, I&#039;ll don&#039;t go on Lidocaine (I just want to cut with the best available and I was thinking active products are better)
