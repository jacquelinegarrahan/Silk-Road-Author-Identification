				Just a practice i do to know i should stop using drugs for my brain health.<br /><br />I just take a pen at the complete end of my index finger and thumb and i watch it. If the pen is shaking, this is time to stop drugs.<br /><br />And when this back to normal, no shaking, you are ready your brain is in a better shape.<br /><br />DO NOT TAKE DRUGS EVERYDAY! lol

				Most of the population takes drugs on a daily basis, albeit legal ones. That doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re safe, though. I try to take breaks frequently, but sometimes it&#039;s difficult, y&#039;know? &gt;.&lt;

				Honestly, if you need to test yourself (almost daily?) to see if you&#039;re still &quot;intoxicated&quot; maybe it is time to stop for a while?<br /><br />If the pen doesn&#039;t wobble, you just continue doing drugs? It&#039;s almost like you want to reach that point.<br /><br />sdesu

				What if you&#039;re so under the influence of a substance that you question whether or not the pen truly exists or is only a figment of your constantly shifting realities? WHAT THEN?!?!?! :o
