				Which is better for what purposes, why?<br />What distinguishes their effects (especially in low, non-binging doses)?<br /><br />Reason for asking:<br />I have tried all three of these, and have noticed almost identical effects from all of them. I feel like maybe I am missing something? Is it only in binging that these all have different effects?

				mdpv is some filthy shit. i was coming down from an nbome experience and i wanted a little pick me up so i broke into my 100mg bag of pv.. only planning on doing a 5 milligram dose. i read on another forum that someone claimed mdpv could &quot;make even the strongest man weak&quot; and several claimed psychosis but i thought that was just some goofy ass paranoia towards the chemical. not really. comprimise after i comprimise, i finish the entire 100mg bag before sleeping, even knowing i had to work the next day... i repeatedly found a way to convince myself that another bump was okay. i would definitely say they are spot on when they say it has its own flavor of psychosis honestly. but i guess ill say something good about it. the first bump was amazing. reminded me of rolling on 2 tenths of mdma. the head stimulation and amazing sensations. after a while your doing it just to feel normal again though. fuck that chit wont ever touch it again haha. amphetamine is a lot better for you than methamphetamine and mdpv(i assume).havent done meth knowingly but i know that i would chose the amphetamine out of those three as its just in my opinion the safest bet... the highest highs come with the lowest lows...

				Can I hijack this thread in a related direction?&nbsp; Thanks :)<br /><br />I recently purchased .5g of 4-MMC, 4-methylmethcathinone (apparently pre-ban mephedrone, but I don&#039;t know if the 3-mmc + 4-mec post-ban garbage descriptions are really accurate or what).&nbsp; Got it from Goldust.&nbsp; If anyone&#039;s curious, product seems quite pure and all that, but bear in mind I have 0 experience with any kind of cat; all the feedback seems to say it&#039;s as advertised though, so there&#039;s that.&nbsp; But anyway...<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely more recreational than 2-FMA, which was... interesting &amp; a really silly daily addition to my usual meth/d-amp habit for awhile.&nbsp; But all in all, I don&#039;t really care for it.&nbsp; The sack is just kind of sitting here waiting for a rainy day or for me to feel particularly in the mood for every random drug I can get my hands on all at once or something.<br /><br />So my question is this: being the silly, silly individual that I am, would mixing meth/adderall/4-MMC/2-FMA/MDPV kill me, or just leave me twacked past any kind of productive level?&nbsp; Any insights (aside from the standard &quot;your heart will explode, wtf is wrong with you retard&quot; stuff -- it might, but never has, if it does oh well and that&#039;s all I have to say about that)?&nbsp; I&#039;ve mixed the above in the past, short of the addition of MDPV, and here I am still having never had a psychotic episode (kind of disappointing in a way, actually).<br /><br />There are times when I can&#039;t help but give in to my self destructive instincts and just want to light my neurons up like a nuclear Christmas tree.&nbsp; Stimulants are really the only drugs I have a taste for, and I&#039;m kind of running out of new ways to abuse them when I feel the need to go all out -- hence the inquiry.&nbsp; I&#039;m open to other suggestions aside from MDPV of course, since the compulsive need to redose kind of... scares me.&nbsp; I have enough trouble dealing with my amphetamine compulsions as it is.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for sharing your expertise peoplez :)

				IV Meth gives me less of a hangover than eating adderrall IR (racemic amp mixed with dextro amp).&nbsp; I find that extended release amps (adderall XRs or vyvanse, etc) hang me over way worse than say adderall IRs. Never tried MDPV but it seems like its not worth it.&nbsp; I did try &quot;bath salts&quot; when they were around and this could have been PV, but whatever I tried sucked.&nbsp; <br /><br />But yeah, meth.

				i think a better answer i couldve given you without going into all of that is to say that if you really want to try all of those, use much smaller than average doses since you are combining them. mdpv is the most fiendish substance ive ever done so just keep that in mind. i have good self control but mdpv pushed me to lose it for sure :P TOTALLY understand wanting to explore landscapes of the mind that have not previously been reached man, its nice to be an explorer (i call myself the guinea pig when i try out a combo ive never heard of =D) if you decide to try it regardless, do your best to make it a one time thing and dont make a habit out of it.<br />and you didnt bring me down mayn, i am just trying to help the best that i can based on experience. have fun man :)<br />(and tell us about how it goes if you try it, so the next person wont have to ask this question)

				Yeah... MDPV isn&#039;t something I need to experience, I think.&nbsp; The payoff is just too low (a new experience that apparently won&#039;t even be novel let alone feel great).&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br />Thanks for the input, and I appreciate you trying to be straight about things.&nbsp; I do realize what I do is bad for me.&nbsp; I just like doing it anyway -- but anything that&#039;s as fiendish as they say MDPV is I really just don&#039;t need thrown in to the mix.<br /><br />By the way, if anybody&#039;s curious, there doesn&#039;t appear to be any cross tolerance whatsoever with cats and amphetamines.&nbsp; Specifically 4-MMC and methamphetamine / amphetamine.<br /><br />2-FMA has no cross tolerance to speak of either, bizarrely enough.&nbsp; I mean a tiny, tiny line of 2-FMA (I&#039;m talking like 2-3 bumps worth) will get me to the best place it&#039;s gonna take me.&nbsp; More starts making me feel sick in a hard to describe way, and yet I can take a gram of meth or amphetamine in half a day and still be up for more.&nbsp; I definitely agree with the &quot;low dose&quot; thing though.&nbsp; If I had gone at meph or 2-FMA as though my tolerance for amphetamines was going to transfer, fuck would I have had one *bad* day...

				d-amph is the king of stimulants. Incredibly clean, very euphoric, not nearly as moreish as d-meth, very potent at low weights, low PNS stimulation (less heart strain and jitters!), and it&#039;s not a paranoid or tweaky high.<br /><br />Honestly, I like MDPV though. Small doses, especially orally, are full of clear-headed focus. You have to set rules for yourself on MDPV... no redose for 4 hours minimum, and don&#039;t stay up all night. A little goes a long way with PV. I would take it over meth.<br /><br />Meth is... a hell of a drug, and one I don&#039;t plan on doing again. It filled my head with weird ideas and made me very impulsive. It was impossible to focus even on a low dose because it was such a &quot;get up and go&quot; kind of stimulant. And it&#039;s much more moreish than MDPV... almost as much as mephedrone.

				It&#039;s really interesting to me the way my personal experience with stimulants can be so contrary to what some others seem to feel.&nbsp; For me, meth is not at all a get up and go kind of thing.&nbsp; Not in the slightest.&nbsp; And mephedrone being moreish... well... yeah, I guess I do get the sense that I want more because I fucking want more, not because I want to feel it more.&nbsp; Which is odd, but like I said, the sack I got is only .5g and I&#039;ve only done it 3 times since it arrived before deciding &quot;ya know, I don&#039;t think I actually like this stuff... I think I felt better before.&quot;&nbsp; My point is very low doses.&nbsp; Always in combination with meth/adderall though, which may modify it obviously.<br /><br />That kind of report is precisely what makes me consider MDPV an interesting drug to try.&nbsp; You&#039;re not the first person I&#039;ve seen say they actually prefer MDPV over meth, but that it&#039;s a very thin line to get it right... hmm... well, I think what it does for you and anyone else who feels that way is very different than what it would do for me.<br /><br />Amphetamines aren&#039;t a &quot;get up and go,&quot; thing for me.&nbsp; They&#039;re a &quot;I don&#039;t want to even move beyond tapping my leg like a maniac and typing for 12 hours until I&#039;ve finished this...&quot; thing.&nbsp; That&#039;s how they feel for me.&nbsp; Super focused, my thoughts flow the way I want them to and focus on what I want without aggravation and frustration... totally not what you describe.&nbsp; Since it&#039;s so different for you, I can only assume my experience with MDPV would be as well.<br /><br />So yeah.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ll pass unless some magically pops into existence in front of me someday.&nbsp; Good to know some people feel that way about it though.<br /><br />Edit: for context, meth and d-amp are very similar for me.&nbsp; Sometimes so similar I&#039;d have trouble telling them apart if I tried.

				If drpvmd ever starts selling it again, pick some up. It&#039;s cheap, and he&#039;s a great source for it - always pure and unadulterated. Otherwise, yeah, it&#039;s not something THAT worth going out of your way for. It&#039;s been sort of my &quot;backup&quot; stim... I am a narcoleptic and it takes 8mg of PV up the &#039;ol sniffer to keep me awake for 3-4 hours, even if I have to sit still (such as at a desk or in the car). It&#039;s useful to have a small bag on hand in case of things like this.

				Mdpv i find is closer to coke. Meth and amp are nice. <br /><br />Meth is good for long hours. You get good mental stimulation from good batches. You can get a lot done, but is obviously the most expensive out the three.<br /><br />Mdpv is wonderful smoked. You have to learn how to cook it up. It literally feels like crack when inhaled. If you don&#039;t cook it up, it feel like coke when shot. Obviously coke tops mdpv. :D But, you can get a huge rush from MDPV. I could see mdpv used for other purposes through a different route of administration. If you&#039;re looking to get high then smoke it. <br /><br />Amp is really nice i have found for bookwork. I can get some studying done with amp. <br /><br />Also, 4fa orally+mdpv nasally helped with school if i couldn&#039;t obtain some meth or amp. I love mdpv, meth and amp. I have had a few times where mdpv was a bad time for me, but that was only caused because of mixing mdpv with something else, or using too much, or re dosing too often.
