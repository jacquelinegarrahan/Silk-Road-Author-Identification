				OK - so I&#039;ve always heard that you want to take LSD no more than once a week -- and that&#039;s the schedule I&#039;m keeping to now<br /><br />I think it&#039;s pretty clear that you can&#039;t drop acid more frequently than that and still trip -- &quot;tolerance&quot; is the reason always given<br /><br />So is once / week still too often?<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to realize that most of the hits you get on SR are FAIRLY weak and are made to be taken 2-3 at a time for an experienced tripper who wants to get out there.<br /><br />BUT I&#039;m also taking DOB regularly and&nbsp; seeing that you can&#039;t trip on LSD the day after taking DOB<br /><br />So you have to plan to take them on some form of schedule<br /><br />I&#039;d like to hear what others think / do on this topic<br /><br />For LSD fans -- do you space your trips out more than weekly to make sure you trip harder?

				Once a week is fine, but after 3 months or so you start getting more tolerance and that&#039;s when you start to trip less and less.

				The only real reasons why you wouldn&#039;t want to trip too often are your mental health, your tolerance and maybe HPPD. Difficulty eating and sleeping after tripping may be a factor as well. Chances are if you feel fine, you&#039;re probably fine.<br />

				a weeks break is enough, but abused for years and you wont hulicunate or have fun anymore, believe me ive tried, can take years break and when dosed its just introspective, which becomes depressive, no visual hulicinations to be had,<br /><br />respect for special occasions, or it wil end up being another drug that you body cant/wont want to handle.

				From what I&#039;ve gathered most psychadelics (whether they&#039;re tradtional like LSD, Mescaline and Psilosybin or RCs like the 2C-x and DOx chemicals) will have some cross tolerance. As for how long it lasts for each chemical, I think it&#039;s quite different for each. My rule of thumb with all psyches though is two weeks, as at least for the LSD this has proven to be correct for me.<br /><br />Having said that I am going to cut back to once a month at most from now on, not specifically for tolerance, but more because you tend to lose some of the wonder if you dose too often. I had a 6 month break last time this happened.

				nice point about not letting it become routine and losing the &#039;wonder&#039; element<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably keep dosing 1/week when I am trying out a new vendor but otherwise plan to cut back to 1/ 2x weeks for now<br />Did that this past weekend and took 2 hits of acid with 2 hits of DOB and had a FANTASTIC time<br /><br />&nbsp;thanks all! 8)
