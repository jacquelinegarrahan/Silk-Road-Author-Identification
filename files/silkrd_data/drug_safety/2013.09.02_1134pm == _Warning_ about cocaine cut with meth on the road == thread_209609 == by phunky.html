				OK, I gave these vendors a chance to make right these fucked up situations before calling them out publicly.&nbsp; I was direct, courteous, and more than fair in trying to seek resolution with them.&nbsp; &nbsp;So all that is left to do for me is try and help others avoid this garbage.&nbsp; <br /><br />TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, as I did, to test what you buy if you care at all about what you&#039;re putting in your body.&nbsp; &nbsp;AND I IMPLORE YOU, DO NOT just take my word for it here.&nbsp; In fact, do not take anyone&#039;s word without a grain of salt.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I am sure these vendors will come on with their shill forum accounts and try to discredit me.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine, because I am only here to encourage people to test what they buy, and if these vendors stop selling shit that&#039;s cut with meth, then everyone wins.&nbsp; If someone else says they tested something and it came up clean, you have to decide for yourself whether or not you believe they are telling the truth or are who they say they are.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nobody besides yourself can ensure what you have is not deadly, especially not these particular vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal responsibility is the ethos here afterall.<br /><br />I bought from these guys because they have been around for a while and because they&#039;ve gotten at least some praise.&nbsp; From now on I&#039;m just going to warn vendors ahead of time that I will be testing their product and not to bother sending me product if there is a chance it&#039;s going to turn up positive for methamphetamine cut.<br /><br /><br />*********** WARNING -- GODOFALL ************<br /><br />godofall , officially blacklisted for selling cocaine cut with methamphetamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Great customer service right up until the point where I had a problem, sadly.&nbsp; Then he simply ignored my messages.&nbsp; This was 3.5g of his &quot;acetone washed&quot; new stuff -- $480 for an 8ball of the&nbsp; &quot;more mellow high&quot; (I guess he meant mellow compared to straight meth because this stuff was not mellow at all) -- this is the stuff he apparently spent 2 months trying to find after a long string of very bad quality coke began to deteriorate his reputation.&nbsp; I guess he couldn&#039;t and decided to settle for dirty coke.<br /><br />The worst part is I initially brought my water test results to him, saying I was surprised to see what looked like about 10% of the cocaine not dissolving.&nbsp; He responded and said his test showed the same thing and that he was OK with me publishing my review.&nbsp; I thought that was pretty honest.&nbsp; I think this also shows he was unaware it was cut with meth otherwise I don&#039;t think he would have been OK with it.&nbsp; Then the next day, he advertised his coke on the forums saying it was his best and had little or even &quot;possibly no cuts at all&quot; in it!&nbsp; Funny... I wonder how it went from definitely having cuts, confirmed by goa himself, to &quot;possibly having no cuts at all&quot; in just a day&#039;s time. <br /><br />Next up...<br /><br />************ WARNING -- RAILS ***************<br /><br />RAILS, officially blacklisted for selling cocaine cut with methamphetamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rails at least responded to my messages, but that&#039;s most I got from him.&nbsp; Here is how that conversation went:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Rails,<br /><br />I have some unfortunate news to bring you. What you sent me ([tx id removed], 3.5g cola) was tested and found to be cut with an unknown quantity of methamphetamine. And not for nothing, this is the second out of the last three orders I&#039;ve made on SR from different cola vendors with the same problem. The test was done using Marquis, Mecke, Mandelin, and Simon reagents and verified by a well-known harm reduction organization.<br /><br />I would like a partial refund for this -- I think 50% would be reasonable at minimum -- as this is an absolutely *unacceptable* and dangerous cut to find in cocaine. In all honesty a full refund would be the appropriate way to address this since reagent testing kits are cheap, easily available, and so there really is no excuse for this lack of quality control.<br /><br />I am open to discussing it more with you but ultimately this needs to be made right. I hope you understand the severity of this issue.<br /><br />Please get back to me as soon as possible.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To which I get this rather rude response:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Show me proof of your accusations and I will give you a full refund. Obviously it would be impossible for you to prove this to us so no proof = no refund. With that said I like keeping my clients happy. I will send you a gram of my new batch free of charge because you are unhappy. This is in no way us giving in to what you are accusing us of which in my opinion is a pile of shit because are stuff is tested. &quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I responded again and kindly asked for a 50% refund, as well as requested that he talk to me like an adult, and that I didn&#039;t want another gram, but I was again met with a brick wall response. <br /><br />What great customer service! &gt;.&gt; I have perfect buyer stats and with over $3000 in transactions from ~15 different vendors over several months, so yeah I guess it makes sense that I would now try and scam one for $160.... right.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be doing the test again today so that I can take pictures and will post it here later today.&nbsp; This is the best I can do to help others not get pissed on by these lousy vendors who won&#039;t man up and own this bullshit they pulled on me.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let them pull the same shit on you.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is absolutely no way for me to 100% prove anything and I know this.&nbsp; So all I&#039;m saying is that this is two established vendors selling coke cut with meth tells me there are probably more and that&nbsp; EVERYONE SHOULD GET TESTING KITS so these vendors can&#039;t get away with this bullshit anymore.<br /><br />Dancesafe for the 4-in-1 reagents (~$65 for about 30-50 worth of tests, which are good for a variety of substances -- I also used them to test some Methylone that was found positive for Methylone but also PMMA, and this potentially saved my life) and EZTestKits for cocaine purity and levasimole testing.&nbsp; Start testing your cocaine for these dangerous adulterants.&nbsp; This is the only way to hold the bad vendors accountable.&nbsp; PinneappleLove is no longer doing his lab tests so we need to do what we can.<br /><br />p.s. -- I did the same tests with Sukey&#039;s top quality stuff and it came up *completely clean*, so hats off to one vendor who ISN&#039;T pissing on his customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />****<br /><br />edit: As promised here are pictures of the tests I did:<br /><br />Rails test: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/MYgi.gif<br />Godofall test: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/Bc4k.gif<br /><br />And here again is the chart for your reference: [CLEARNET warning] https://dancesafe.org/sites/default/files/DS_TestingKit_Final_wBleeds_back_rgb.jpg<br /><br />The nail in the coffin is really the Simon test because very few things actually will turn Simon A/B any color at all, coke definitely doesn&#039;t, so having all of the tests available makes reading this pretty damn easy for determining the presence meth - thankfully.

				I like what you are doing here, can&#039;t imagine snorting meth if you have bought some good cola. Really sad to see that there are scumbag vendors that sell that shit as cola.<br />You can&#039;t predict someones drug behavior, not all people snort little lines or take key spoons, some people like to snort multiple grams and drink multiple bottles of whiskey while they&#039;re at it. You don&#039;t want someone having seizures because you cut it with that crap.<br /><br />&nbsp;+1 to you, and you might want to purchase less than 3 grams at a time when your buying meth coke especially at SR prices. Taste &amp; test it, then proceed to buy more. Kinda a waste of money to buy 3 grams of hillbilly powder.

				I second the &quot;holy fuck&quot; response.... these two were among the top guys. Fuck that shit. Community based knowledge... this is the reason why SR is amazing, and its people like you phunky who are the holy grail of this place. You are doing a good thing by sharing your information, and if it is truly based on fact then you may have saved lives. I truly appreciate you sharing your data. This shows we all need to be extremely cautious.

				@OP: Why are you using any additional tests after Marquis?&nbsp; Marquis does not react to cocaine at all, but reacts with the standard orange-&gt;brown-&gt;black to the phenethylamine&#039;s(i.e. meth.)&nbsp; &nbsp;Whereas the other reagent tests all react to both cocaine and methamphetamine, meaning they&#039;d be useless to determine cuts(as the color change would be based on all of the reactive compounds present)

				Actually that is incorrect.&nbsp; You can learn how to use the tests here and why it&#039;s important to do all of them:<br />http://dancesafe.org/health-and-safety/adulterant-screening-kit-instructions<br /><br />Only Mandelin reacts to Cocaine (which it did).&nbsp; You are right about Marquis, but Mecke does not react to Cocaine, nor does Simon A/B.<br /><br />I did all tests because I did not know what it was cut with obviously.&nbsp; Doing all of the tests gives you the clearest picture, and each test has the ability to further identify or remove suspected agents. <br /><br />For example, Marquis reagents turns the same color for amphetamine and methamphetamine (orange), and Mandelin reagents turn the same color for amp and meth (dark green), but the Simon A/B test only turns color if it&#039;s methamphetamine, while it does not change color for amphetamine.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Accidentally taking meth that was used as a cut for some molly I&#039;d bought was one of the most scary moments I&#039;ve ever experienced in all my years of taking drugs. This is one thing I&#039;ve been worried about when buying cocaine on the road... and its prevented me from buying any at all so far. Glad I hesitated, I almost went for GOA this past weekend for the holiday.<br /><br />+1 definitely.

				I can recommend Sukey and Studio54 from personal experience, they both sold me pure stuff, but that does not mean you should not get testing kits, too, they&#039;re worth the investment and will help not just you but everyone else as well.<br /><br />No matter what anyone says is good stuff, this is the cocaine business, spelt capital S-H-A-D-Y.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only thing you should trust in the end is a test.

				@fractalglobal no worries, actually they have updated these tests in the past couple years.&nbsp; They are not exactly the same as they used to be, a little more precise.&nbsp; But yeah, chromatography would be slick, I will look into it.<br /><br />I am trying to think this through as much as possible to be as fair as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />One thought I had: can you reuse acetone after you&#039;ve used it to wash meth to wash coke?&nbsp; Would there be trace amounts of meth in the acetone that could mix in with the coke?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never washed coke but I understand the basic chemistry involved.&nbsp; I&#039;m just trying to think if maybe this is a possibility.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not coke cut like 10% with meth obviously.&nbsp; I am not up for 2 days tweaking.&nbsp; But they definitely kept me up way longer than it should have,&nbsp; I had dilated pupils ~3.5 hours after last bump and couldn&#039;t sleep even with a good dose of benzos down the hatch.&nbsp; It&#039;s just plain speedy.&nbsp; Whereas I had Sukey&#039;s coke to compare it to which was clean and a much more mellow high, and the reagents tested exactly as they should have for pure cocaine with his stuff.&nbsp; Almost so mellow I thought I had got ripped off at first lol, you can ask him about the guy who pmmed him saying his coke smelt really odd like it was burnt and was a little bit worried, but after testing it with kits I realized this was not the case at all and my baseline had been fucked up by too much speedy coke as of late.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Not to belittle this subject, but it just caught my attention, as I&#039;m on a Meth quest tonight. The majority of Meth sold on SR is either completely fake, or cut to shit. Though there are one or two exceptions. <br /><br />My little &#039;joke&#039; here if you&#039;ll allow me is, &quot;Does anyone know where I can buy some Meth that&#039;s cut with Meth?&quot;<br /><br />Seriously it&#039;s that bad. Good Meth is actually a great high. Especially if taken orally. That&#039;s right, just take a piece that might weigh around 40mgs, have a good beverage ready, either really sweet or your favorite adult beverage, place it as far back on your tongue as you can, and &#039;down the hatch&#039;. <br /><br />Anyone who like&#039;s adderall would love a good Meth experience. <br /><br />A year ago, I wouldn&#039;t be talking this casually about it, as I was one of the sheeple being led by the Government Media Complex into believing Meth was somehow the new &#039;crack&#039; of the 21st century! <br /><br />Anyone old enough to remember the big &#039;Crack Scare&quot; of the late 80&#039;s? - Anyone who remembers, also knew at least one guy who said, &quot;Well I do freebase, but I&#039;d never smoke that crack shit&quot;. LoL. - Same thing. <br /><br />Anyway. I do hope you get some good coke vendors again. I&#039;ve bought coke occasionally as that&#039;s the only way I can handle it w/o becoming addicted. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had some interesting luck. There was one vendor earlier this year MarthaStewart that had it for $75 a gram, and a friends birthday was coming up, so we figured for old times sake, why not get a gram. Well the shit was practically pure! I only know, bc one of our friends is in the entertainment industry, and has had Mercke Pharmaceutical right out of the brown bottle,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he said, &quot;That&#039;s as close to the real deal as I&#039;ve tasted in a while&quot;<br /><br />Well MarthaStewart never had any to offer after that, which is probably a good thing for my bank account, bc that was the shit!<br /><br />Sometimes you just have to take a chance on a new vendor, and you just might get lucky. <br /><br />I wish you all the best. <br /><br />Keep up the good fight, and never be afraid to OUT the phonies!<br /><br />In solidarity<br /><br />&nbsp;8)&nbsp; Chip&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Thanks Chip.&nbsp; Well like I can&#039;t imagine this is like dirty joe&#039;s coke cut with meth.&nbsp; It&#039;s either very minimally cut so as to not be noticed for much beyond a little bit of a &quot;speedier&quot; coke, or it&#039;s accidental, as in my uninformed hypothesis that maybe this stuff is being washed with acetone that has been used to wash meth by someone up the chain and it&#039;s leaving some meth in the coke as a result. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s even probable or possible, just an idea.&nbsp; But regardless I wouldn&#039;t have even bothered with the test kit had the stuff not kept me up.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I&#039;m sure most people are in that same boat.&nbsp; I mean, how many coke users are really connoisseurs?&nbsp; How can you be these days?&nbsp; Well, maybe with Studio54 around we&#039;ll have a new movement of them, lol.&nbsp; But otherwise, I have to assume most of the people using coke test with their nose and understand that it&#039;s going to be cut most of the time and just don&#039;t care much for the risk.&nbsp; Take levasimole for example.&nbsp; How many people are testing their blow for that?&nbsp; I mean, nobody with half a brain wants to be ingesting something that deadly. Meanwhile there is plenty of evidence to show it&#039;s definitely out there and in pretty significant quantities, at least as of 2009 when they did that study, yet it&#039;s pretty clear most people can&#039;t be bothered to test for it themselves.&nbsp; I fall into that category.&nbsp; Or at least I did.&nbsp; Not anymore.

				Damn sites down again. Was just placing an order of course. <br /><br />Not sure about &#039;re-using&#039; acetone that was previously used to wash meth. It&#039;s plausible, but then my tiny bit of sensibility tells me, the acetone, washes away the cut, but leaves the meth, though some is lost, ie; goes into the acetone runoff. I highly doubt anyone&#039;s giving a shit to wash Meth, Coke, or Amph in order to sell it. Call me skeptical, but it seems counter productive to the whole &quot;profit&quot; idea of vending in the 1st place.<br /><br />I got out of HS in 1980, and man the bar scene on Long Island + NYC was flowing with coke. If you ever saw Goodfellas, where Paulie&#039;s making Henry promise him not to sell drugs, then it cuts to the great coke dealing scenes with the Brown Coup Deville. That was the early 80&#039;s, and that was the same area. So no doubt we were doing mafia coke.&nbsp; It was some pretty potent shit. Of course you&#039;d occasionally get the stuff&nbsp; cut to shit with speed. That was very common. We just took it in stride, like &quot;Don&#039;t buy from that asshole again, his shit is too speedy&quot;<br /><br />No doubt it was Meth. Though Meth was different back then too. I&#039;ll tell you what I like most since discovering SR and the selection of anything you want. That is Amphetamine. First I was getting the Dutch Paste. Then I discovered these here forums, and found the top two speed vendors, who are also the cooks, so they really stand behind their product. <br /><br />A good gram or two could last you a week, even sharing with a friend. Though you can get fiendy. <br /><br />Amphetamine is not neurotoxic like Meth is, and it&#039;s a lot of fun. Not to mention you&#039;ll never have a cleaner apt! ;D<br /><br />I was actually brought here after my shrink died, and I didn&#039;t feel like explaining my life over again to a stranger. Prior to that I&#039;d been so depressed and confused (ADHD) that there was a giant pile of mail, enough to cover a dining room table, that I went through in two nights. <br /><br />I&#039;m gonna be 50 soon. I only found out I was had ADD at 46. I always wonder how different my life would&#039;ve turned out, had my generation had the benefit of drugs like Ritalin and Adderall. <br />&nbsp;<br />Well, I&#039;m doing the old man rambling thing again. So I&#039;ll end it here, <br /><br />Take it easy<br /><br />&nbsp;8)&nbsp; Chip&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Wow, that would suck! But surely you&#039;d know if some meth was added as you&#039;d be up for 24 hr cleaning the ornaments.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a coke her cut with speed, except for one former UK vendor who slipped off after scamming enough coins to buy an oz of heroin and more lube for when it runs out. (guy has to earn a lving)<br /><br />I&#039;m actually putting some through a proper lab test ;-) Cannot say how - nor send any links and no way can I scan them because, I&#039;ve been told specific not to do that. We will copy and paste on Linux and wipe the originals. The lab test is more detailed than EZ test, but I always EZ test my yayo - or anyone elses. EZ test kits cost maybe 10 quid in a head shop. The EZ test website does like ten tests for 50 Euro, or just resell it (you make a few pounds if you have a resellers code link on any social networking, emails or msg, facebook and twitter.<br /><br />Meth in coke is a bad idea to force on people. And, would it be even worth doing coke when on meth? I was once addicted to speed, for a while, back in the day, and would not touch even the top coke then as when on speed, you felt nothing! I am reckoning that if on meth, coke is not going to register, but you could either waste 100 dollars or risk a heart attack.<br /><br />So, thanks but no thanks. Keep any coke cut with meth. And I could say were to stick it but lets not be uncouth.<br /><br />Who has the best gear is what we ask!<br /><br />Not who has the shit with meth added!<br /><br />&nbsp;::)

				&quot;Detecting&quot; meth cuts in your coke is easy as piss.&nbsp; Dissolve coke in water, add ammonia, if it turns yellow, there is meth in it.&nbsp; Generally the &#039;yellow&#039; will separate from the water and float to the top, forming a thin layer which is pretty easy to see.&nbsp; If this happens, feel free to take pictures and blackmail the vendor who sold it to you.&nbsp; Public awareness is one thing, but blackmail is more likely to make the vendor clean up his act(rather than cut his losses and get a new vendor account) and as an added bonus, blackmail often leads to free drugs!

				Don&#039;t understand why the dude would post this thread if he was trying to blackmail this vendor, the dude offered him a free gram of shit and he still posted this instead of taking the free coke. Seems like a nice thing to do for the users if anything. In my opinion the vendor seems shady giving such a response like he did, moral of the story I guess is test your shit if you&#039;re smart. Don&#039;t trust anyone other than your family.

				I wasn&#039;t inferring that the OP was blackmailing the vendor, I was inferring that he should.<br /><br />Negative reinforcement has been proven to be a far stronger motivator than positive reinforcement.&nbsp; Congratulating someone for doing the right thing is far less effective than calling them out for doing the wrong thing.&nbsp; Case in point, most people don&#039;t even bother to read the vendor feedback unless its a negative review.
