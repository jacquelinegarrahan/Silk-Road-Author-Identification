				Title: <strong>Methylone false positive?</strong><br />

				Has anyone ever had this? I had about approx. 300mg of methylone over the weekend and on Monday, I was drug tested and it came up positive for meth. I also had a small amount of MDPV and 5-APDB over the weekend as well but not much of those. I&#039;ve never done meth in my life and my first thought was that some of my stuff was cut but I now see others reporting false positives as well. It was just sent off to the lab, will they investigate more or just say it&#039;s negative? It was a shitty First Check test from Wal Mart given by a family member under the agreement of me living in their house. I&#039;m leaving in a few days to stay with a friend so it really doesn&#039;t matter, just curious as this has never happened before and I&#039;ve done up to half a gram of MDPV in the past, been tested while ON PV, and everything was negative. This was my first time tested for methylone though so I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s normal to come up a false positive. Thanks.

				Methylone is structurally similar enough to amphetamine to trigger a false positive, just like MDMA can. MDPV is structurally distinct enough that the probability of it being detected as an amphetamine is a lot lower.
