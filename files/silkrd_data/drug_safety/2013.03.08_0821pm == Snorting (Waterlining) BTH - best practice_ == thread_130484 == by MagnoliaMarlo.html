				Hey guys, when I mess with powder H I usually snort and I would like to do the same with my BTH from Nod (props Nod). I don&#039;t like smoking and would like to make a water mixture. I have done it before by putting a few drops of saline solution in the cap of the saline bottle and stirring the mixture of a little chunk of bth and water with a straw til it is primarily dissolved- however sometimes it doesnt completely dissolve. I am told heat would fix this but I dunno how I would do that since I am using a plastic cap. <br /><br /><br />For those of you who are more experienced, can you step by step walk me through the most effective way to snort (waterline, monkeywater- whatever you want to call it) bth? <br /><br />Thanks a ton in advance!<br /><br />MM

				Its hard to snort water. never tried it but if i wanted i would get a syringe lay back and slowly squirt some slowly into my nose. takes time.let it absorb.&nbsp; do too much and will run down the throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;or you could try plugging it!!

				yeah getting syringe with detachable needle cooking up and then putting carefully solution in your nose is very effective (just have not to get it run down your throat).. and gets you high in 5 mins when snorting even powder dope would take 10-15~

				We would do this in jail, but dissolve it in a spoon and just poured it down your nostril, making sure to keep your head back for a few minutes so it can absorb. Works good, but if you aren&#039;t using a needle I think smoking tar is the next best way to go. The syringe w/o needle works good too.
