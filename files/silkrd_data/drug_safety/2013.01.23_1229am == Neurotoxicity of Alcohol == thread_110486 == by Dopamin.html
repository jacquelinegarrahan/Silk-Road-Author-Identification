				Hey,<br /><br />I just did some googeling but found nothing on the subject. In a discussion about MDMA a person often reaches the topic of neurotoxicity. But what about alcohol? I heard no one ever say something like: Alcohol makes holes in your brains etc... Is it possible that recreational drug users are generally better informed about their DOJ then the usual drinker? Also, addiction to alcohol is a far less common topic then addiction to illegal drugs. These are just my impressions.&nbsp;

				While i do enjoy my alcohol, objectively its a pretty horrific drug. <br /><br />If you disregard the legal status, alcohol is addictive, damaging, fattening, and often leads to risks to non-users as well (drunk driving, fihgts and such). If the criterium for legalizing a drug would be &#039;not more dangerous than alcohol&#039;, substances like cannabis, xtc, benzo&#039;s, lsd and a whole lot more would qualify for immediate legalization. <br /><br />Tradition is an important factor there though. Things like sugar and salt would miserably fail food safety requirements as additives compared to what is required of newly developed substances as well, yet no one gives a damn about that.

				I will try to look for a link to the study, but the results showed that excessive consumption of alcohol decreased grey matter in the brain even after a relatively short period of time (&lt;/= 18 months).<br /><br />sdesu

				Good post Wazup, +1.<br /><br />I am uncertain of my stance on legalization/control of substances but I share a lot of those sentiments and have similar experiences with alcohol vs. MDMA. It does a whole lot more to your brain than MDMA does.

				People knowingly and willingly ingesting substances that will harm them is a problem indeed. This is true of alcohol, cigarettes, and even high calorie foodstuffs as you pointed out. <br /><br />I would argue that there is litte difference between legal and illegal substances where this is concerned though.<br /><br />With alcohol, many will keep it to 2 or 3 drinks before driving home. A few people will drink a lot more, and then still attempt to drive home, posing a risk to both themselves and society at large. <br /><br />In case of alcohol there is a very strict definition to what is acceptable in traffic in most european countries. Commonly this is an alcohol level in the blood of no more than 0.05%. With illicit substances there are no such established limits however, and there is no reliable testing equipment available either. The lack of clear definitions complicates things sometimes. How much pot can you smoke before its unsafe to drive a car? I&#039;m sure a milligram would be just fine and an ounce would&nbsp; not be, but a real limit needs to be established.<br /><br />This poses the question of tolerance having is effects too though. Someone used to drinking alcohol could be able to control a car at much higher levels of alcohol compared to a novice drinker. Making judgements in such cases would need a new form of testing: for actual function instead of for some predefined&nbsp; blood level.
