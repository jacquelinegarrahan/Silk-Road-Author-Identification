Go to your local pharmacy and ask the people at the counter for a baby syringe. It&#039;s free of charge, and they can give you more than one if you like. If they ask you what you need it for, just say you need to give a baby some cold medicine. What they&#039;ll give you is basically a 1-2 ml dropper.<br />2. Measure out your heroin dose in a small container like a 2 liter coke bottle cap or a milk jug cap. <br />3. Draw up 1-1.5 ml of water into the dropper.<br />4. Squirt out the water into the cap and stir the water and heroin until the heroin is dissolved as much as possible.<br />5. Draw up the water/heroin solution into the dropper/syringe.<br />6. Make sure you&#039;ve taken a shit recently so that your bowels are cleared, then lay face-down somewhere comfortable with the dropper in hand.<br />7. Depending on your anus, you may need some slight lubrication to get the dropper in there. Lubricate as necessary and insert the dropper into the anus about .5 inches.<br />8. With the dropper inserted, squirt the solution into the anus, making sure to depress the entire bulb. You&#039;ll feel the liquid go in. Wait until you feel the solution go deeper inside the rectum before you take the dropper out since sometimes the solution can follow the dropper back out of the anus and then drugs may be wasted. <br />9. Stay lying face-down for about 5-10 minutes so that the drug can fully absorb.<br />10. Nod the fuck out :)

Be very careful about the temperature, it should be a little higher than your body temperature. (because it will be a little cooler after it ran through the tube straight inside your lovely anus ;))<br /><br />Then wait for 1-2h before inserting anything, i would advice you take your 10-15ml or whatever and after that clear water, maybe about 100-150ml (not more) this way it will go very deep. the water will get absorbed by the bowel (use salt when you do the 1-2 enemas else your bowel will be saturated and the 100-150ml (without salt) will take much longer to get absorbed.) and this way i think more of the surface of the bowel get&#039;s covered with whatever (MDMA? :)) but watch out, test small amounts beforehand, the bowel is very sensitive and it&#039;s pure hell if you have agressive stuff in there. don&#039;t ever use alcohol to dissolve anything for plugging. it will make your bowel MAD about you for days at least.
