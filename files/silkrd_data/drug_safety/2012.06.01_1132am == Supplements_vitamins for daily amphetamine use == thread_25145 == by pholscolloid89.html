				Will keep it short and snappy..<br />If I were to be taking small amounts of amphetamine/adderall (~30-50mg) per day, and taking breaks at weekends, what sort of vitamins etc should I be taking to minimise damage to my brain?<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing I&#039;ll want something to help replenish dopamine, but don&#039;t really know where to begin.<br />

				There is a big thread on this on Bluelight!<br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/199749-Safer-use-of-stimulants-faq<br /><br />I cannot vouch for the accuracy of any of this however, so make sure you do your research. The guys on BL can get a little carried away.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking why are you taking speed daily? Is it prescribed?

				I don&#039;t have an answer to your question, but have you considered cycling between adderall and modafinil&nbsp; to reduce the potential neurotoxicity of adderall, such as taking adderall 2 times a week and modafinil 3 times or something? I prefer adderall but modafinil seems to get the job done for me, so that&#039;s what i am going to try.

				I am a regular user of ice and take<br /><br />- protein powder (to make for not eating and helping out with aching muscles)<br />- Fish Oil, co-exymine q10 (to help with circulation)<br />- A multivitamin<br />- A good moisturiser with vitamin e<br />- Use biotene toothpaste and mouthspray<br /><br />I only take the recommended doses and this has definitely to have helped with most of the physical effects - aching muscles, cold hands and feet, bad skin and dry mouth.

				Although I have never done Adderall (and I am not a trained physician)&nbsp; I do snort Meth on a daily basis.&nbsp; I am very aware of how harsh this drug can be on mind and body.. and believe that the following harm reduction practices are relevant for all amphetamines:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Omega 3 Vitamins (Fish oil) is a proven defense against neuro-toxins. <br /><br />2) drink LOT&#039;S of water and non-concentrate orange juice. Amphetamine&#039;s dehydrate you and raise your body temperature so this is an important element in harm reduction.I have found that the more I drink the faster the amphetamine is eliminated from your body (hence the darker urine). Avoid coffee as it is a diuretic and tweak you out.<br /><br />3) ensure that you take the speed earlier in the day so that it won&#039;t interfere with a regular sleep patterns. <br />I find that Melatonine is a remarkably effective sleep aid (buy it legally while you still can). This goes without saying but amphetamine use + sleep deprivation= shadow people. heh heh.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />4) speed is an appetite supressant so when you do eat try and choose healthy nutritious foods and avoid junk foods altogether if possible. You may want to consider taking multi-vitamins.<br /><br />5) I don&#039;t know about Adderall but the body odor of a Meth user stinks like cat piss (ammonia). It is one of the nastier side effects of Meth use (besides unpredictable rage/paranoia and hillbilly teeth). You might want to consider taking showers more often and possibly even carry around small deodorant sprays.<br /><br />6) I don&#039;t believe in illegal&nbsp; drug use (yeah..like I am serious) but a speed freak should always have some valium on hand just in case of a panic attack. Personally, I like good Heroin that I can snort or I.M. but then again I am just a degenerate fuck.<br /><br />6) if for some reason you run out of your stash don&#039;t freak out: it&#039;s a blessing in disguise. It&#039;s good to take the occasional break. Try to obtain natural dopamine from getting outside for some exercise and enjoy the sunshine. If you have an addictive personality be aware of how incredibly fast a stimulant habit can develop. <br /><br />Anyways, I hope that drug of choice works out for you buddy. I am interested in it so keep me posted. Be safe!<br />

				Eat a lot of green veggies (salads) - they tent to have vit. B complexes abd other pro-livier-pre-enzymes, and the fiber your body LOVES. I&#039;d also take a little more vit. C, and a small-moderate bit of vit D. The latter is a metabolism regulating hormone instrad of an actual vitamin. It has a role in controlling the uptake of all the other nutrients.<br />OK, take a bit more still of Vit C (just don&#039;t eat the whole bottle).
