			<dd class="postbody">
				Hi, I&#039;m buying a half sheet of non-perforated LSD from OrderOfThePhoenix.<br /><br />I need your advice guys, is this safe to do?<br /><br />1. Use ruler to draw cutting lines with mechanical pencil (each tab is supposed to be 1/4 inch).<br />2. Cut with sharp object.<br /><br />What would you suggest I cut it with? And is it okay to place the ruler on the blotter with minimal pressure just so I can draw the lines? Is there something else I should use other than a mechanical pencil?

				Start cutting it into ten strips.&nbsp; A ten strip is .25 x 2.5 inches.&nbsp; From there, just cut them up into individual tabs (.25 x .25 inches).<br /><br />You could just print out this 1/4&quot; graph paper, staple it to your blotter, and just cut along the lines.<br /><br />http://www.printfreegraphpaper.com/<br /><br />I just use a sharp scissor to cut.

				You don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; You can figure some other way to align it with your blotter, so as to suspend it in its position while you&#039;re cutting.&nbsp; Or if you have some other idea, tell me.

				Seems pretty straight forward to me.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even need to draw lines.&nbsp; Just put a little dot every .25&quot; along the edges.&nbsp; Cut with scissors or a blade or whatever.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably just cut mine as I need them.<br /><br />Try not to get oils from your hands on the paper.&nbsp; Use gloves or whatever.

				I would, but Amazon requires a $25 minimum for purchasing that since it&#039;s an add-on item.<br /><br />Nice signature btw, I&#039;m wearing a Sublime shirt as I type this. :P

Fantastic!

				It&#039;s pretty much as simple as you described.<br />From experience:<br /><br />Equipment:<br />1. Scissors - clean and sharp<br />2. Pencil - sharp<br />3. Ruler - clean<br /><br />Steps:<br />1. Make sure hands are washed and dry.<br />2. Lightly draw desired grid size.<br />3. Cut tabs as needed.<br /><br />Just makes sure you only hold the sheet as little as possible.<br /><br />Like I said, simple :)

				Oh yeah it&#039;s actually pretty damn easy. I didn&#039;t think it was gunna be too complicated I just had no experience at the time of posting.<br /><br />I received my sheet from OrderOfThePhoenix, pulled out my handy scissors and printed out 1/4&quot;x1/4&quot; graph paper. Even if the tabs get cut uneven it&#039;s not that big of a deal.<br /><br />Good shit. Was able to resell just fine, not one complaint, only great reviews.
