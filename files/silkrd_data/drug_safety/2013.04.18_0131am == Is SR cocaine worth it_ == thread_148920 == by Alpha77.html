				50% of the time.&nbsp; I have very good street connects that are something on par with the best on here for 50-60 bucks for .7-1g....<br /><br />Through trial and error you will find very good stuff on here but your still paying 40-70 dollars more than street prices and sometimes the seller you got good stuff last time may not have the best batch.&nbsp; Best idea is to just keep up in the cocaine sellers thread and see who is selling good stuff.&nbsp; I will tell you this though, I will not pay $140+ for a fucking gram.

				&#039;marketing wank&#039; is thrown around a lot in this neck of the woods, not sure about where you are from. <br /><br />SR coke is, to quote Xzibit, &#039;10% skill and 90% Hollywood&#039; . In other words, it is shit most of the time, not better than street at all, vastly more expensive and the least pure / least bang for buck from any drug on SR in over a year of my experience. <br /><br />avoid and save cash. If you are in the US, your street coke will be on parity with anything on here. <br /><br />CD8N

				Thanks for the very useful advice. I&#039;ll stick to the local dealers I know that have decent shit. But there&#039;s gotta be maybe a couple vendors that have really powerful cocaine that hasn&#039;t been cut, right? I&#039;m trying to get my hands on that.

				Nah the coke I get for $50/g on the street is good pure shit, they actually off that and this cut flavored shit that some people like, I just want the clean shit though... Weed and coke I never buy off here. LSD is also way overpriced so I&#039;ll only get it if I can&#039;t find any at the time..

				Every coke is cut, even right after it is manufactured or it will be paste like. <br /><br />Northern Dancer has very good stuff.<br />Kingofthetrill <br />DRPVMD<br />Delta11<br /><br />A lot of the people I use to get from aren&#039;t here anymore.

				If you don&#039;t have good street connects then SR is a godsend.&nbsp; I personally use SR over street because I get SO paranoid meeting up with them or even chilling at their house.&nbsp; I deal with big time guys and they&#039;ve gotten caught before. Anyways&nbsp; yes SR it is pricey but you will still get decent to pretty damn good stuff delivered to your door which you can start doing lines in the safety of your home.&nbsp; You just got to do your research on who is selling the good stuff and who has good stealth.

				honestly, no the coke on here is not worth it...at least for me, i went through to much trial and error.<br /><br />nods is good but i had to try like 8 vendors before that, with a lot of idiots claiming its great.<br /><br />in the end, i got good coke but i was pretty much pissed off hahaha, cause i spent so much money just to get a decent bag.<br /><br />i just hate how many assholes are out there that have no fucking idea what coke is, ruining for the dudes looking at vendors on reviews to get the right one.&nbsp; either way, coke is pretty fucked up and skewed on here. luckily i live in an areas and have plenty of connects for good coke, god bless my wall street days

				The coke on SR 100% slams the stuff on the street here in Aus.<br />I&#039;d never buy off the streets again. Then again, I don&#039;t buy coke often because it&#039;s so fucking expensive here.

				All depends on where you are and who you know. For me personally yes it&#039;s worth it. I pay 100 a gram both on the road and off, and quality on here has been consistently higher than most shit I&#039;ve been able to get in person. I have never received totally garbage or methy coke (that I know of) on SR when I have come across both of these in person.

				Personally ide rather spend 95€ on SR coke then 50€ on the streets. (EU)<br />My first SR coke experience was a review sample and it blew me away.<br />Cut streetcoke for me is a totally different, very crappy, drug compared to the 70ish% with no active cuts i order from C&amp;M.<br />But i gotta be honest if i hadnt invested in btc i wouldnt have ordered as frequently as i did(avg once every 3 weeks).<br />I&#039;m not sure any high is worth this kind of money for the avg joe working man.
