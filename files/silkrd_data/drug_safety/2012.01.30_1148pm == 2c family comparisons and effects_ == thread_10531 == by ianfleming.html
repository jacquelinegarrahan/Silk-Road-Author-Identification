				I&#039;d like for people who have used various 2c family RCs to describe the differences or the effects.<br />I&#039;ve recently purchased some 2c-i for &quot;testing&quot; and am interested in some of the other 2c RCs, mainly 2c-b and 2c-p<br />But I&#039;m interested in hearing about all of the 2c-x chemicals.

				Good choice for starters.&nbsp; 2c-i is less of a mind fuck than 2c-b, it can be a little speedy but that uncomfortable feeling comes and goes.&nbsp; It&#039;s clearheaded and for me the body high similar to MDMA is there.&nbsp; Some complain of a body load, I&#039;m fortunate to not have this but have friends that have felt nausea.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been having a little love affair with this chemical, redosing is not a problem, probably not the smartest thing as with any drug, you should use it too much... but you should be relatively safe ;)<br /><br />2c-b was my first and it was amazing, very fun at a rave, I was very talkative and loved all the visual stimulus.&nbsp; It was definitely more visual than 2c-i and the mind-fuck totally got me, I went into another world at one point.<br /><br />2c-p I haven&#039;t had yet, I have some just haven&#039;t put it in capsules yet but from what I read, it&#039;s pretty potent compared to the others.<br /><br />Enjoy!

				What dosages or 2c-i are you using?<br />I&#039;m looking at going with 15mg the first time, though I&#039;d like to go with 10mg to save product. I&#039;m a little worried that 10mg wont get me were I want to be though.

				I&#039;ve done 1mg, 7mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg.&nbsp; 7mg was more an awareness, so slight distortions in visuals, my friend was unable to tell but I had been taking it for a few weeks prior.&nbsp; 10mg was a little to weak but still enjoyable, easily brought up to a nice spot with a bong hit or two.&nbsp; This is what I capped most of mine as.&nbsp; I did just below 20mg, took a bong hit and ripped my mind right open.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think I could get that mind-fucked off 2c-i but with a bong hit at peak I was having a full blown mind twist.&nbsp; Visuals were entertaining but the mindfuckiness was a bit uncomfortable at that point.&nbsp; 12-15mg probably a pretty good starting point if you&#039;ve done other psychedelics.... remember it&#039;s better to dose too low than too high.&nbsp; Also worth noting that I&#039;ve had friends who require closed to 12 and others that require closer to 17mg, where I&#039;m comfortable at 15mg.<br /><br />it sneaks up on you too, it comes in slow waves and with the clear head, you might not realize how deep you are in the trip until you&#039;re like &quot;omg I&#039;m tripping my balls off&quot;<br /><br />best of luck :)

				2C-E = Most visual I&#039;d say, and one of the worst bodyloads on any psychedelic I have ever had. Vomiting, noticeable rapid heartbeat, and over all discomfort. 12 mgs is what you should do to test. 15 is a normal trip, 20 mgs for a strong trip.<br /><br />2C-I More colorful, lesss visual. More of a body high, WAY better body load. 15-25 mgs to trip.<br /><br />2C-P = I have not personally consumed it, but it is very long acting. 12+ hours. 7-11mgs I believe.

				2C-P was most rewarding in my experience, but all of them are very interesting to explore. 2C-I was my first, though I took too much for my first time. I railed ~16mg, while using other drugs. I tripped for 4 days. Definitely start lower. There&#039;s a ton of 2Cs, though, and it&#039;s difficult to say which is the best because I haven&#039;t tried all of them (yet!).

				In some earlier days when I fancied myself a designer psychonaut, I got my hands on nearly every psychedelic research chemical available to me at the time, including many in the 2C family.<br /><br />The 2C family—especially 2C-I and 2C-E—have value in a purely psychological and introspective sense at the expense of the experience itself—because, to be honest, they&#039;re not a whole lot of fun.&nbsp; My best friend and I can say now that we had three or four excellent moments while using the 2C drugs—not whole trips, mind you, just chapters of individual trips—over the course of several months of irregular use.<br /><br />When we ran out, we decided that while 2C-I and 2C-B were the most &quot;enjoyable&quot; and 2C-E the most powerful, they all feel far too synthetic, mechanical, fractured, and fucked up to impart the warmth, joy, bonding, fusion, and synch for which we looked to psychedelics.<br /><br />After we ran out of them all, we knew that we would never try them again, and have since stuck to fungus, MDA, and LSD.<br /><br />My $.02: Stick to traditional psychedelics.&nbsp; They can take you further than most other stuff out there today, and they&#039;re actually fun.&nbsp; 2C-E may be rewarding, but it&#039;s rewarding like getting water boarding resistance training.<br /><br />I remember one night we were sprawled out on his floor listening to music, and all of the sudden we started doing pushups because of how we could feel every muscle in our bodies—the sinews and fibers of every strand of muscle protein. With every repetition, we could feel every nerve send signals to every muscle—each one contracting, relaxing.<br /><br />Cool, right? Well, I guess. At the time, we were also fighting intolerable temperature changes, chest tightness, pressure flashes, neck soreness, and heads that felt hot and warped—as in, physically warped.&nbsp; Our whole visual perspective was distorted—we had tunnel vision, and angles didn&#039;t behave—, we experienced little to no euphoria, and generally felt more dissociated—akin to ketamine—than tripped out.<br /><br />But yes, there were good moments.&nbsp; Like staring at the art in the café where we went to get some beers with a cheese plate.&nbsp; The art actually animated itself.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t like LSD or mushrooms where you can&#039;t tell what you&#039;re looking at as it changes constantly, ever becoming something else—no: The underwater mermaid began to swim. One crystal clear unit on the canvas. Bubbles coming out of her mouth and rising to the surface.<br /><br />I mean, that was amazing.&nbsp; But damn it if I couldn&#039;t gawk and laugh, and instead squinted my eyes, held my head, breathed slowly, and tried to process the information in an enjoyable way—and this was on my best trip with the stuff!&nbsp; I have never encountered this kind of static with LSD, MDA, or fungus, but I get levels of it from most designer drugs, even including psilacetin.&nbsp; In my opinion, I don&#039;t think the detriments outweigh the benefits of any of these RCs—especially when SR is around.&nbsp; Stay careful out there.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S. — Dosage info for 2C-E: I snorted 5 mg once and decided never to do that again.&nbsp; Just felt off all night.&nbsp; The next week, I then took 10 mg orally followed by 20 mg a week later.&nbsp; The 20-mg experience was by far the best.&nbsp; The 10-mg night turned into one of the most frightening brain trials of my life as my CEVs showed my synapses and neurons at war with each other, and the geometric fabric of my psyche eating itself to pieces. Really bad night.

				Excellent post germanicus...very similar to my experiences.&nbsp; I found 2C-I to be extremely fun and it&#039;s one of my favorite drugs but I&#039;ve heard many people say things similar to what you posted...I think I just have a much higher tolerance for the bizarre and incomprehensible than most people (I always find it intriguing/enlightening rather than scary or unpleasant...can honestly say I&#039;ve never had a bad trip).&nbsp; With that said, I&#039;ll agree with you on 2C-E: it really isn&#039;t fun at all.&nbsp; I&#039;d say it&#039;s the closest thing you could get to experiencing schizophrenia but with a horrible body load on top of it.&nbsp; Your thought processes don&#039;t really feel altered (i.e. there isn&#039;t much euphoria/dysphoria); the world just doesn&#039;t look right.<br /><br />However, I found that if I took 2C-E then smoked some weed I would have the most intensely euphoric trips...beyond anything else I&#039;ve ever done (have not done LSD or DMT yet unfortunately so can&#039;t compare to them).&nbsp; I honestly can&#039;t even describe it except to say pure perfection.&nbsp; 2C-E by itself is a wholly unfun and I would even say somewhat dangerous psychedelic (had one trip where I was listening to Angel of Death by Slayer and could feel every action being described as if I was the one being experimented on...not particularly pleasant).&nbsp; But throw some cannabis in and it changes completely; don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever experienced a synergy like that between any other drugs.

				damn good post germanicus. <br /><br />Just one thing was different for me. <br />2c-e, I took it close to the 30mg border (on accident) was ment to be my sweetspot (20-22mg) but I messed up the caps a bit. This time I thought I would actually die. No, not the deaththoughts or some egodeath thing. It was pain, physically pain and some childish fearful complete blown mind. This trip feels like total poisoned. <br /><br />On the other hand, I had numerous times with 2c-e I couldnt stand the euphoria. I heard some old psytrance and was crying because of the love i felt. (have to admit that there were mush more RCs over a few days and quite some alkohol in game as well) But this was the most intense euphoria I ever felt.<br /><br />But I am done with my research and stick to good old lucy right now.<br /><br />take care<br />no_pain

So I had just gotten some 2cs from a supplier and I left them at his house (I was small time back then).

They had one hell of a trip but it ended up being pretty good lol.<br /><br />Long story short, don&#039;t snort random bags of potent powders.

				Thanks for the props.<br /><br />I will add one thing: When under the influence of any psychedelic, I am generally smoking herb the whole time, so I definitely did the same with the 2C-E.&nbsp; I generally smoke to enhance the trip, but with 2C-E, I smoked for the relief, but I didn&#039;t get much.&nbsp; It definitely calmed me down a little bit, but we couldn&#039;t do anything to shake the load. What works for some won&#039;t work for others. Tread carefully, Mr Flemming.&nbsp; :)

				Well, 2C-I is a great &quot;fun&quot; psychedelic, but don&#039;t underestimate it. It once put me so over-the-top I had to pop a Risperidone and 2 Etizolams and then lock myself in a private room. Keep it spaced out, and IMO, keep the doses low. I got a lot more out of my functional 7-12mg trips than I ever did from my 20mg ones. <br /><br />I also highly recommend plugging the 2C-x family. It reduces the come-up, the bodyload, and it definitely removes most of the intestinal complaints.

				I&#039;m getting some more 2c-i soon.<br />However I do not have a Mg scale.<br />I tend to use Volumetrics to get my dosages metered out. (5mg per ml in a 100proof labware corn whiskey).<br />However I&#039;m pretty sure that shooting 3ml of an ethanol solution up my bum is going to sting....a lot.<br />Is there any other way to meter out a dose without a Mg scale?

				You&#039;re fine. 40mg is the maximum fun dose. You CANT overdose on 2c-i, people have taken 1gram before and been fine. The only side effect was a headache for the next few days.<br />Amusingly they say that after about 35-40mg you cant increase the effects anymore, it just sort of stops there.

				Thanks.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; I think my scale is off.&nbsp; I just calibrated it and weighed a few pills.&nbsp; 2 that are 2mg pills and both come up as less than 2mg.&nbsp; Then I weighed a 20mg pill and that comes up less as well.&nbsp; The scaled I bought had great buyer ratings but maybe I got a bad scale that can&#039;t keep calibrated?&nbsp; Or, I&#039;m not doing something right but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case?&nbsp;
