				Hello my fellow connoisseurs!<br /><br />Today I bring to you a step-by-step guide on a simple and crude guide for the lazy layman that just wants to drink his opiates, dammit! ;P<br /><br />Things you will require:<br />-A 1 liter bottle of some sort (can be nalgene or glass) <br />-Ground poppy pods (approx. 10 g for this recipe)<br />-At least .5 L of Hard liquor (I used Hendrick&#039;s gin)<br />-Cinnamon<br />-Sugar<br />-Coffee filters<br /><br />Optional Ingredients (I will explain these later):<br />-Etizolam<br />-Cetirizine tablets (aka Zyrtec)<br /><br />Step 1: Put the dried poppy pod material into your bottle. I eyeballed it, but I would venture to say I used about 10 grams of the ground pods from High Carts.<br />Step 2: Put about 2-3 tablespoons of sugar into bottle.<br />Step 3: Put as much cinnamon as you think you would like. I used ground, but you may use sticks (in this case, I suggest 2).<br />Step 4: Pour in the gin! I poured in 500 mL.<br />*Optional* Step 4a: Add 2 mg etizolam for added nod and hypnotic properties.<br />*Optional* Step 4b: Add 20 mg cetirizine to counteract possible itchy side-effects.<br />Step 5: Close the bottle tightly and shake, shake, shake that baby up! <br />Step 6: Put the bottle in a cool, dark place and shake it every once in a while. Wait for at least 24 hours before opening.<br />**At the 24 hour mark I only took out a portion at a time so that it would keep brewing, but you can strain the whole thing and be done with it already**<br />Step 7: Once 24 hours have passed and many shakings of the bottle have occurred, it is time to open up that bottle of wonder. First prepare another container that will hold your Zipstylaudanum ;) lol. Secure a coffee filter over a second container with a rubber band so you can just pour into it. POUR SLOWLY. You will most likely need to use SEVERAL coffee filters throughout the course of your filtering process. The next step will explain why.<br />Step 8: You will notice that there will be chunks of poppy pods in your filter, and soon enough of them will accumulate to the point where not much liquid will filter through anymore. At this point, you need to take the filter off the top, scrunch it at the top, and squeeze (carefully, you don&#039;t wanna rip your filter!) those pod chunks. I believe this is where most of the opiates are! Use those strong muscles ;)<br />Step 9: You should now have a very dark brown if not darker liquid, which I call the crude laudanum. BE VERY CAREFUL AND RESPECTFUL OF THIS SUBSTANCE. You are mixing several very potent and potentially dangerous drugs together. Overdose is DEFINITELY POSSIBLE. Also take into consideration that the opiates can take a while to kick in, so only dose 1 shot every hour or so until you become familiar and experienced with the effects. All of the drugs in this concoction are depressants, so keep that in mind please.<br />Step 10: Take a shot (NOT THE IV KIND! lol), lay down, and ENJOY! If you were successful, you will be drifting off into nodland and morphine dream world within the next 30 minutes :) <br /><br />I hope this is helpful to those interested in an easy do-it-yourself laudanum guide. <br />Do enjoy responsibly and post back your results! <br />You may also want to add some lemon or orange juice and see if that helps.<br /><br />Any suggestions for improvement are also welcome! <br />I just thought this was a really simple way to get the opiate in a drink.<br /><br />And that&#039;s wussup.&nbsp; 8)

				sounds too temptingly easy...&nbsp; <br /><br />how do you define &quot;shot&quot; zipstyle?&nbsp; since this stuff is an easy way to od as the levels can&#039;t really be judged, I assume you&#039;re looking at something like a teaspoon?

				Sounds like a basically good idea for opiate extraction from poppies. <br /><br />Adding the zyrtec and/or etizolam doesn&#039;t sound like the best idea in the world though, especially in combination with alcohol.<br /><br />While zyrtec (cetirizine) is sold as a non-dorwsy antihistaminic,&nbsp; the non-drowsy part of it seems to go away quickly when combined with alcohol. I&#039;ve had this happen in the past personally, and the combined effect of cetirizine and alcohol produced mild hallucinations at moderate doses of either. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Thanks for the criticism. <br />I didn&#039;t know about the zyrtec/alcohol interaction (nor have I particularly experienced it) and the etizolam...well that&#039;s kinda obvious why it&#039;s a bad idea. Hopefully the rest of the guide is helpful to people. <br /><br />Abby: by &quot;shot&quot; i mean a standard shot of alcohol. Take less to start if you are feeling wary. I definitely did. Of course dosing is different for everyone, I just am posting what worked for me.

				Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I thought it was a proper shot until I went reading up and assumed that the stuff was more potent than it is.<br /><br />Extremely interesting though..&nbsp; and very tempting to try :)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				I find it hard it hard to believe that one single shot is enough, that would be the equivalent of 625mg of ground poppy pods and if you take it as a tea you&#039;d need more like 10g.

				According to wikipedia, apparently alcohol extracts from the pods much better than water.&nbsp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudanum&nbsp; and of course the alcohol would also have an effect.<br /><br />I suppose it&#039;s all to do with how well the pods are ground and how long they&#039;re steeped in the alcohol and your tolerance.<br /><br />

It&#039;s astonishing how much better alcohol extracts the opioids. I like making tea as well, but the tea can be a bit more difficult because of overheating dangers. Plus, you still have to let it steep for an hour or so anyways. With the alcohol tincture (which is more or less what I&#039;m making in this guide), you do have to wait at least 24 hours, but after you strain everything out and squeeze the liquid out from the ground pods, you have a liquor with concentrated opiate content which is stronger, quicker to dose, and more stable. I have a small bottle on my shelf and it&#039;s pretty strong! One swig every once in a while gets me in a nice, cozy, pain-free state. I have been doing quite a bit of research online about tinctures and laudanum recipes and I will say that there are technically more efficient ways of doing this, but I find that this method works and is pretty darn easy for someone that isn&#039;t too snobby or doesn&#039;t have the time to take all the extensive steps of other guides. <br /><br />For everyone&#039;s convenience, I&#039;ll quote here the recipe I based mine off of. :)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First I start with 1/4 lb. finely ground<br />poppy heads, a coffee grinder does the job for me. I dump this in any<br />big, fat, sealable glass container. To this I simply add 1 pint of good<br />quality 80 or 100 proof vodka. After mixing this and letting it settle<br />there should be about an inch of free liquid at the top (considering<br />you used a quart jar), if not, add enough to bring the level up. This<br />should be put in a dark place for 2-3 weeks, shaken well every day. <br /><br /><br />The solid should then be separated from the alcohol, yielding about 12<br />ounces of liquid, 4 ounces still remaining in the pulp. I then add 4<br />ounces of vodka or distilled water to the pulp and shake well,<br />separating again which yields 4 more ounces. Each tablespoon contains<br />around 3.5 grams of pods. I then do a double extraction with my poor<br />man&#039;s laudenum, though a little is lost in this second process,<br />yielding around 6.5 grams per tablespoon. I keep this in an amber glass<br />bottle, otherwise it should be kept out of the light. This will keep<br />for at least three years without losing potency. Hah! three years i am<br />funny. For those with a high tolerance and shitty pods I recommend<br />using an eighty proof vodka and using distilled water in the last<br />process instead of alcohol.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

People that are used to taking antihistamines for hayfever and such will recognize that problem to some degree.

I was TOTALLY interested in the history behind these substances, and I daresay gin is my favorite liquor to imbibe. Poppy pod tea is indeed a very civilized way to partake. Perfect adjunct to reading in the study by the window. If you know of Hendrick&#039;s and appreciate it&#039;s taste, then I will definitely have to try Plymouth. As of yet I have tried Tanqueray (both original and Rangpur), Bombay, No.7, Amsterdam, Beefeater, and Hendrick&#039;s. Gotta say Hendrick&#039;s is my fav so far, but you never know ;)<br /><br />I have an affinity for old substances (and old things), used moderately. I don&#039;t have much desire to replicate an opium den or anything like that, but a nice opiate/alcohol buzz while I read a new novel sounds lovely to me. Tobacco is another one...I&#039;m not a habitual smoker, but some nice tobacco from time to time is also a great pleasure. <br /><br />The poppy pods I put in the booze were already ground up, close to powder. I would also suggest using a t-shirt or similar cloth to strain the poppy pod pulp (which it kinda turns into after soaking for so long). If you&#039;re familiar with the prep of Kava, then I&#039;d say the straining process is similar. Come to think of it, a cheese cloth would probably be perfect, but not everyone has those haha. <br /><br />Have not tried a french press, but that would be good to try also. Though I would think that a french press would be better for making tea rather than the tincture.
