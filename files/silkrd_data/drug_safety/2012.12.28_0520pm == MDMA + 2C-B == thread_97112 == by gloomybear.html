				Hi All,<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this has come up many times before as it&#039;s a classic combination but most trip reports I&#039;ve read go from one initial dose of MDMA straight to the 2C-B or combining the two, I&#039;m planning on a few bumps of MD throughout NYE (possibly up to 500mg in total depending on strength), then a 15-20mg 2C-B HCL dose when we get home, so a few hours after the last drop. <br /><br />Does that sound about right? Any advice/experiences?<br /><br />Cheers!

				Yes that sounds about right man.<br />Words of advise.. take the 2c-b after the MDMA peak is over and make sure you&#039;re in the right setting where you feel comfortable. <br />Last friday I had a bad trip with this combo (including some ketamine.) Reasons were because I stupidly got my mate to measure out the dose which was to much..&nbsp; around 40+mg&#039;s of which was snorted and I was still rolling hard at this point and the setting wasn&#039;t good. So the result = bad trip. It was extremely intense. <br />Be careful and you&#039;ll have an amazing time though, this is a very enjoyable combination when done correctly. :)

				Cool, will definitely wait till we&#039;re comfortably at home and well after the last peak then, got some scales recently so will be careful with the dose too, 40mg snorted sounds mental! Will stay closer to the 20 mark I think..<br /><br />Thanks for the advice mate, appreciate it! Can&#039;t wait!!<br />

				Yeah it was pretty intense. Yeah man just chill out and relax and you&#039;ll have an amazing time. :) If you&#039;re dropping as opposed to snorting bare in mind it can take a while to hit you, up to 2 hours!&nbsp;

				Best time for 2C-B is just before baseline of MDMA - i.e. later than you think.<br /><br />If you want to tweak that very nicely then put a dash of acid at the beginning (low 25ug - 50ug) and start on GHB once over the peak of the 2C-B (about T + 3 hours).<br /><br />Delicious :)
