				You&#039;ve got to act like what you are doing is normal. So walking down the street, you are high as shit and you see a cop. Don&#039;t stare at him, in fact ignore him.<br /><br />Stuff like that. Also don&#039;t make &quot;life decisions&quot; when you are fucked up. If you are high it is not the right time to ask your boss for a raise, your wife for a divorce or tell your parents that you want to drop out of college and focus on your &quot;art&quot;. Save those decisions for when you are sober.

				^^ This. Plus all the obvious stuff. Don&#039;t reek of drugs. Don&#039;t show up with red eyes or giant pupils. <br /><br />And don&#039;t let paranoia get the best of you. Thinking that people &quot;know&quot; that you&#039;re high is a great way to give yourself away

				depends what drug i suppose: <br /><br />pot: get some eye drops to sort the red eye out and cover yourself in BO basher so you don&#039;t smell like a skunk plant. <br /><br />coke: don&#039;t do too much or you&#039;ll get a chin wobble on. shades are good for dilated pupils. know when to stop talking.<br /><br />mandy/lucy/2c-x/shrooms: good fucking luck! i don&#039;t know anyone that can look sober after taking any of these<br /><br />in all cases: confidently believe you are sober, paranoia about this can really give the game away. remember the majority of people don&#039;t do drugs and have never seen the effects they have on people, so they don&#039;t know what to look out for anyway. and keep hydrated - a lot of chems give you a mouth drier than ghandis flip flop, and if you keep licking your lips to moisten them thats a dead giveaway as well to people in the know

Last time on amp i was so motivated that i finished all of my business emails (way too long awake at that time). I have had a hard time looking some ppl in the eyes haha. Still too ashamed to read all that garbage i wrote. I was sure i wrote masterpieces while i was high.
