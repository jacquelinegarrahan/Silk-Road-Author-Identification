				I want to get into amazing shape for Christmas. Thinking of taking Dianabol. 50mg one a day tabs. I&#039;m already quite muscualr despite not training for two years (i trained for 18)<br />Any opinions?<br />I know long term they will harm me, but any more than the smokes, bad food and two bottles of JD I currently drink every week?<br />They didn&#039;t kill the 70&#039;s bodybuilders.<br />Am I just wrong again? If so, please tell me why. <br />Any advice very valuable to me.<br />Thanks!

				You should take this to one of the steroid forums like EliteFitness, steroid have a lot of risks that must be managed to be safe.<br /><br />If your goal is to be in shape by Christmas, when most people say in shape, they are talking about losing weight. Losing weight is all about counting calories and eating clean. Anavar/Primabol/Clen T3 are more suited to weight loss in the steroid family.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t going to clean your diet up, steroids are not worth the risks. Oral steroids and drinking are a huge no, oral steroids are already extremely hard on the liver, you don&#039;t want to end up the hospital with jaundice. You must do post cycle therapy if your going on steroids, so that your body re-regulates itself properly.<br /><br />

				Bro do not take dbol for 4 months. That is stupid and will cause long term health issues with the heart and probably kill your liver.<br /><br />Do a 12 week cycle with test, dbol, and deca.&nbsp; You will not keep your gains without a proper PCT with a SERM like nolva, clomid, or tamoxifen.<br /><br /><br />Another reason your idea is bad is because your gains will eventually come to a halt with out taking a break.&nbsp; 4 months is just way too long.&nbsp; Last reason is, oral only cycles are retarded and shouldn&#039;t be done without injectables.&nbsp; <br /><br />You think the golden era bodybuilders back in the 70&#039;s never had a problem as they got older? Many of them died early from heart diseases.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want more advice message me because it sounds like you have absolutely no experience with anabolics.

				I would not recommend staying on dbol for this long or any steroid for this long, dbol = 4 max - around 4-50 a day. 40mg&nbsp; a day 10mg every 4 hours.<br /><br />You need to inject if you want longevity in life! Look up liver support for dbol as well !! Dbol are normally used to kick start a cycle while waiting for the longer ester injectables to kick in, like enan or cyp. Injecting isnt that scary trust me !!

				Thanks for all the advice. I&#039;m fine with needles, though I have only ever had them during blood tests. I think i could handle that. I have so much to learn on this subject. So how do I do this Kingpin? Be very specific. As if I am a complete fool (I am).<br />

				Don&#039;t do dbol alone, unless you want to get watery and flabby.&nbsp; Oh, and have crazy lower back pain.&nbsp; And 4 months is way too long.<br /><br />As the other posters said, you gotta clean up your diet and be on a good/great training program.&nbsp; The juice is just a supplement (albeit a great one) but you don&#039;t just stick yourself a couple times a week and you&#039;re ripped and huge.<br /><br />If you&#039;re new to steroids, keep it simple while you can.&nbsp; Start with a 12-16 week cycle of Testosterone (basis of ANY cycle) and consider maybe adding in some EQ.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go crazy with dosages, eat clean and keep those workouts tough.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my opinion, test ethanate is the best testosterone.&nbsp; Less gains than test cyp but way less watery.&nbsp; Test prop is good, but you gotta shoot all the time, like every day or every second at worst and it becomes a pain.<br /><br />feel free to ask questions here in the forum and I&#039;ll do my best to answer ya.&nbsp; PM&#039;ing seems defeatest as no one else gets to read/comment.&nbsp; Again, just my opinion.

				Are Test E and test Depot essentially identical? I have just read on a forum that they are?<br />So what other meds should I take in this first cycle that will help and, importantly, prevent gyno?<br />Already decided Test-E (or test Depot) is the right direction for me.<br /><br />I could do with a UK vendor guru who provides literally everything I need. Needles, wipes etc etc. Everything.<br />Then the meds I need once the cycle is over. And so on, and so on.

OP just get test e and pin 12 weeks 250mg 2x a week. 14 week start pct and make sure you have adex on hand. Get a base line of how you react to one compound before you add others. I suggest paying 50$ to labcorp if your in the states and have pre and post blood test done. Do you want to run HCG also?<br /><br />OP first of all what are your stats? Sounds like you should pick up where you left off natty and build from there and decided if you want to do juice or not. <br /><br />Make sure you have Adex on hand for the water and dem titties <br /><br />Week 1 Test E 2x (250mg)&nbsp; a Week <br />Week 2 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week <br />Week 3 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week <br />Week 4 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week <br />Week 5 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br />Week 6 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br />Week 7 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br />Week 8 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br />Week 9 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br />Week 10 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br />Week 11 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br />Week&nbsp; 12 Test E 2x (250mg) a Week<br /><br />Start PCT 2 week after last pin<br /><br />Dosage depends on which one you choose.<br /><br />Week 14 Nolva or Clomid<br />Week 15 Nolva or Clomid<br />Week 16 Nolva or Clomid<br />Week 18 Nolva or Clomid
