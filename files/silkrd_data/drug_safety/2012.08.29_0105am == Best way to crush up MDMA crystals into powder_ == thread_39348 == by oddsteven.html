				What is the best way to crush up mdma crystals so the powder can be placed into gel caps? Would a mortar and pestle be the way to go or are there any other ideas that might work better?

				Put a credit card over the pile then run something like the butt end of a pocket knife over it several times then tap the credit card on the surface to get the stuff caked to it off. Not that hard.

				I always crush MDMA between 2 spoons in a big grip seal bag. Doing it in a bag prevents product loss and you can scrape the caked MDMA off the spoons into the bag also.

				I guess mortar and pestle would be the best but really, I&#039;ve crushed it with the flat of a knife and the bottom of a lighter with perfectly fine results. As the above posters have pointed out, it isn&#039;t too hard to get the crystals down to a more palatable powder but if you are planning on doing massive amounts, you may as well get dedicated hardware (mortar/pestle). <br /><br />Cheers

				If you&#039;re going to do this often, then get a pallet knife. (google it if you don&#039;t know what it looks like. It&#039;s like a flat and rounded tool used by painters and artists. It&#039;s amazing for all kinds of drug use. Use it to crush. Use it to take small accuracte amounts out of baggies. Use it to re-bag (or re-cap as in your case). You can even make lines with them. It&#039;s just an amazing tool to have around if you work with drugs often.

				i&#039;ve used the following frequently for a variety of powders especially when out and about.&nbsp; Get a note, fold in half, pour gear into the crease and crush against any hard dry surface (even a wall). Open note slightly and chop gear with card.<br /><br />With this method you can even snort off the note crease if needs be when theres no other flat surfaces about.

				Personally I think the best way to crush any pill/crystals is to put it into a shot glass then get a screwdriver and use the handle part to push into the shot glass while twisting to crush whatever substance is it your crushing, it makes no mess and nothing goes flying everywhere. Then you can just dump it out and bam there you have it powder :). I hope this helps you.
