				I&#039;ve seen people plug mdma before, it&#039;s as safe as it gets.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my tentative plan:<br /><br />5mg sildenafil citrate, crushed and dissolved in microcellulose gel<br />100mg MDMA crystalline powder, dissolved in microcellulose gel<br />10mg bremelanotide, predissolved, mixed with microcellulose powder to produce gel<br /><br />this gel would be used as personal lubricant for intimacy, pushed deep inside the rectum during intercourse.<br /><br />Can anyone find anything wrong with this? anything particularly unsafe? is 5mg sildenafil too much? is 10mg bremelanotide too much? is 100mg of pure mdma dissolved into sex lube too much?<br /><br />are any of these drugs incompatible with the anal route of administration for any reason?<br /><br />Thank you in advance for any advice.

				bremelanotide is basically a peptide, given the number of proteolytic enzymes and the sensitive residues, theres a possibility it may be degraded. concerns of hypertension ceased intranasal use, so in combination with mdma this could be especially dangerous if it is absorbed intact somehow...

				http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/890/ACF1A06.pdf<br /><br />according to this, there are not a lot of degradative enzymes in the rectum, so you can use rectal roa for peptides and protiens.

				Lol.&nbsp; Yeah that is a bit disconcerting.&nbsp; I&#039;m more wondering how well the Bremelanotide worked.

				As far as I can tell, there should be no reaction between the three, unless you&#039;re taking the sildenafil for hypertension (which is unlikely, but a possibility nonetheless).<br /><br />Why are you taking these drugs rectally? I understand the intention of quicker absorption, but this totally changes the dosing of the medicine. <br /><br />For instance, the normal dose for Sildenafil via oral administration is 50mg by mouth, 1 hour before sexual activity. However, the IV dose is 10mg three times a day (When used for anti-hypertensive purposes). <br /><br />Since rectal administration is somewhat similar to IV administration, in regards to metabolism, the dosages may likely be similar as well.<br /><br />sdesu<br />

(think BDSM + forced drug administration.) Administering when the drugs are dissolved in a gel would be easy, even if the subject is tied down in bed, and gagged.<br /><br />The quicker absorbtion is a plus.
