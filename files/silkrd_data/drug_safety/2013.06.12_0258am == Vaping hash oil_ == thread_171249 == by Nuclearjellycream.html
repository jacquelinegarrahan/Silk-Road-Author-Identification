				Interested in trying a healthier and strealthier alternative to a spliff, but unsure of what to do. As I understand it, oil can be used with any non-disposable electronic cigarette. I this true?<br /><br />Additionally, there are loads of oils out there. Some apparently specifically made for vape pens, whereas other, hash oils, are thicker? Essentially I&#039;m unsure of which one to get, as I wouldn&#039;t want to waste BTC on something that can&#039;t be vaped.<br /><br />Any experiences out there? Looking to buy a gram or two to start with.<br /><br />

				Buy a rig with a titanium nail.&nbsp; Its not very portable buy a good size dab keeps you baked for 6 hours so it doesn&#039;t need to be portable.&nbsp; If you really need the portability then get a health stone.&nbsp; IMHO E-cigs blow and waste product.&nbsp; Not to mention a rig or stone will handle any/all forms of concentrates (waxes,oils,shatter.)&nbsp; Many e-cigs simply don&#039;t handle some forms of oil well.

				You have to have a certain oil substance for certain ecigs. Example, I have an ecig but I can&#039;t just throw shatter in it and vape. It has to be oil in a shooter syringe that you can shoot down in the loader. <br /><br />I personally use my volcano to vape my dabs when someone is borrowing my rig. Works like a charm...<br /><br />here&#039;s the type of oil you will need...<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f65d862624

				If you want to really vape oil buy an omicron ophos. Its worth it, carts are mmade for one time use tho.. But can be refilled several times if taken good care of and really clean oil. Check out fuckcombustion.com and check it out. Dont listen to that ecig bullshit, altough if you could get it to work i salute you. But buy an ophos and a 5 pack cart and some oil and youll be set for a while(2.5 has nice clouds... 1.5 gets crazyyy ha). Like dont buy an trippy stick, atmos, or G pen. Atleast this is from my experince and other peoples too. That dude two messages above me, dont message him Lol he just sounds sketchy

				Lol it was a joke which i hope he was aware of. But still what if a random person on the deepnet asked you to message them? But i guess we all or most see SR as a somewhat safe place so i dont think it would hurt anyone to message a stranger who could possibly have good or bullshit advice. But me thats just too much work for me. But if you have goood advice you should read my post about a seller and tell me your thoughts.
