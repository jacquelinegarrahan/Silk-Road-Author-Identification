				I ended up trying heroin and thought it was okay. I didn&#039;t get hooked on it. Used for about two weeks and then quit. Just set a limit for yourself of the total number of times you will try it or the total number of grams you will use in your life and if you stick to that you will be fine. I found it to be less addictive feeling than meth. But from experience with seeing others I can tell you that it is a sneaky drug. Nobody thinks they will get addicted to it until they do. And then it is all down hill. So just make sure not to use enough to get addicted. I think it would take pretty regular use for several (more than two) weeks for this to happen though. <br /><br />I sniffed and smoked though. IV seems to get people hooked a lot faster.

Not sure if you&#039;re serious or not given the meandering on this forum, but I&#039;ve known many people who think this is a good idea and fall into a pretty nasty trap. It sounds perfectly logical. It&#039;s really a bad idea though. I could go into a number of tl;dr reasons or reasons people would ignore but I think the most useful logistical reason is that Subs are really friggin&#039; expensive. . . . <br /><br />Plus, yknow, having a Master of Puppets is never ever a good thing. I dunno how many other metalheads are out there ( we salute you! \m/ ) but let me tell you something about Master of Puppets :&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t end well! <br /><br />Just your Local Friendly Neighborhood Shredmod weighing in to make sure nobody reads that and thinks &quot;great idea!&quot; ;) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This thread was typed at 220 bpm.

				I guess I did kind of make light of the whole situation by saying &quot;If you ever get hooked just go on suboxone&quot; didn&#039;t really mean too, or shouldn&#039;t have anyways.&nbsp; The Opiate is a wild beast you shouldn&#039;t try and tame.&nbsp; You take your chances....<br /><br />In retrospect, if I never touched the drug, I&#039;d probably be better off.&nbsp; But I have no regrets...&nbsp; It is what it is.<br /><br />Edit: Grammar/spelling

				Depends on a lot of factors, honestly. <br />Have you tried other opiates? How did you react? Were they the most amazing thing ever, or &quot;eh. Kinda nice, I suppose&quot;?<br />Do you value money and personal health over, for lack of a better term, getting high?<br /><br />If you have never tried an opiate, do not make heroin your first. Period. You don&#039;t want to risk falling in love at first sight (or first dose, I suppose), and there&#039;s a chance you&#039;ll OD if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoy heroin on occasion. Sometimes shooting, sometimes sniffing. It varies, week to week... how much spare cash I have, how hectic my work schedule is, if I&#039;d rather use another substance, etc. I&#039;m one of the lucky ones who didn&#039;t develop a strong compulsion for it after going once. I have a few friends who weren&#039;t as fortunate.<br /><br />Semi-edit: There are always chances of negative effects. Risk of overdose, possible mild constipation, and vomiting are three things to think about.

First time I smoked it, I smoked a single 15mg dose, and then proceeded to vomit for 3 hours when I tried to swallow a vitamin 8 hours later. I vomited for close to 6 hours when I smoked ~23mg without even trying to eat anything. Both times I didn&#039;t feel right for a few days. I&#039;ve only smoked it around 5 times over the course of 4 months, but I wouldn&#039;t venture to say that it&#039;s a good idea in any sense of the concept. Part of me would hope that those bad effects would go away with higher opiate tolerance, but I would have to presume that the good effects would go away as well...

I don&#039;t want a stronger high I just want moneys worth. If money weren&#039;t an option I&#039;d stick to OC.

				It definitely isn&#039;t a good idea, but its a hell of a drug. I managed to avoid too bad of an addiction, but thats due to the fact that I watched my best friend go from occasional use to shooting every day, many times a day. The addiction he had and the symptoms of withdrawal he faced trying to quit is something that i wouldn&#039;t tell anyone to go through. I managed to keep my usage down because I barely had any money to spend on it, and got most of it when my room mate would pay me with it for doing deals for him.<br />The max I was ever doing was like .1-.2 a day(shooting and snorting it dissolved in water), and even from that I had some bad withdrawals(nothing compared to my roommates). But even when you wake up after feeling like shit from h, you do more because thats the only thing that makes it better, thus the addiction builds. <br /><br />tl;dr- Heroin is a great feeling drug, and i&#039;ve had some good times on it, but most of the consequences aren&#039;t worth it. (Addiction, personality change) You can have the greatest self control in the world, but once you feel the bliss from h you will at some point start going down the path to addiction. Be careful

				I don&#039;t have experience with oxycodone or speed, but I do know the withdrawal symptoms of heroin. It&#039;s NOT an easy drug to quit. You go through muscle pains, cramps, nausea that won&#039;t stop for anything, you&#039;ll be pissed off at everyone, you&#039;ll have hot and cold flashes that will make you miserable, you&#039;ll have times when you cannot stop shaking, and through all this, all you need to do to feel better is to just do a little heroin. <br /><br />Yes, you can use heroin without getting to this point, but it is very easy to get to this point. Especially if you go in underestimating the drug. AND all of this was from tar through street dealers, so I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t even compare to the level of heroin on SR.

				Not trying to be a dick Moonbear and I type this with safety in mind but judging by the shit I&#039;ve seen you write you do not have the willpower or mindset to fuck with heroin. Remember, about a week ago you had a thread titled &quot;Possible Accidental Overdose&quot; where you posted up a bunch of shit you mixed together and thought you were going to die. Even if that post was bullshit, it was a very juvenile thing to do. Besides, if you have to ask an anonymous forum of people that like to fuck with you if a deadly drug you will be mainlining is a good idea that&#039;s telling you something. <br /><br />Leave the shit alone.

Not that I am going to say anything here that hasn&#039;t been brought up, but I would also like to add my two cents. I have been a heroin addict for about 8 years (addict is the key term here, when using heroin there are no weekend warriors, please believe this), and if I could go back in time and stop myself from taking that first dose I would not hesitate to do so. Heroin WILL enslave you, I don&#039;t care how strong you believe your willpower is -- you WILL become addicted, as zhukov mentioned, it taps into the core reward/endorphin system within your brain thus you are hardwired to LOVE heroin, in fact you will love it so much it eventually will become more important than anything else in your life. I, like most beginner heroin users, thought that I could avoid full blown addiction, and for a while I did. Alas, that is the problem. It takes different ammounts of time for everyone, but once you use it, and feel the power and bliss of its warm embrace, the countdown clock starts, and it is only a matter of time before you absolutely need it. Is it possible you could avoid this? Sure, anything is possible I suppose, but I can say with 99.9% certainty that you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO. You know how I know this? Because everyone thinks they will be the one to avoid the trap, they believe their willpower or self-control is greater than other peoples, and everyone eventually fails. I beg of you, please don&#039;t try heroin. I can tell you exactly what it brought me: a criminal record, burned bridges with ALL of my former friends, collapsed veins, a family that looks on me with disgust and pity and anger, an inability to save any money because it invariably is all lost to dope, stints in rehab, and the horrors of withdrawal (especially withdrawal in jail, you&#039;ll love that one). And the worst part is I am one of the lucky addicts -- I don&#039;t have HIV/AIDS, or Hep C, my family will at least still speak to me (sometimes), and I still have my life (although I continue to risk it 2-3 times a day every time I shoot up). Ask yourself this before you try it if you really must: Am I ready to forsake everyone I know and love? Am I ready to steal, cheat, lie, and rob? Am I ready to brave the worst anguish I will ever know once my supply runs out?

Not that I am going to say anything here that hasn&#039;t been brought up, but I would also like to add my two cents. I have been a heroin addict for about 8 years (addict is the key term here, when using heroin there are no weekend warriors, please believe this), and if I could go back in time and stop myself from taking that first dose I would not hesitate to do so. Heroin WILL enslave you, I don&#039;t care how strong you believe your willpower is -- you WILL become addicted, as zhukov mentioned, it taps into the core reward/endorphin system within your brain thus you are hardwired to LOVE heroin, in fact you will love it so much it eventually will become more important than anything else in your life. I, like most beginner heroin users, thought that I could avoid full blown addiction, and for a while I did. Alas, that is the problem. It takes different ammounts of time for everyone, but once you use it, and feel the power and bliss of its warm embrace, the countdown clock starts, and it is only a matter of time before you absolutely need it. Is it possible you could avoid this? Sure, anything is possible I suppose, but I can say with 99.9% certainty that you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO. You know how I know this? Because everyone thinks they will be the one to avoid the trap, they believe their willpower or self-control is greater than other peoples, and everyone eventually fails. I beg of you, please don&#039;t try heroin. I can tell you exactly what it brought me: a criminal record, burned bridges with ALL of my former friends, collapsed veins, a family that looks on me with disgust and pity and anger, an inability to save any money because it invariably is all lost to dope, stints in rehab, and the horrors of withdrawal (especially withdrawal in jail, you&#039;ll love that one). And the worst part is I am one of the lucky addicts -- I don&#039;t have HIV/AIDS, or Hep C, my family will at least still speak to me (sometimes), and I still have my life (although I continue to risk it 2-3 times a day every time I shoot up). Ask yourself this before you try it if you really must: Am I ready to forsake everyone I know and love? Am I ready to steal, cheat, lie, and rob? Am I ready to brave the worst anguish I will ever know once my supply runs out? I am assuming you aren&#039;t willing to go through these things, so please believe me, I have already made these mistakes for you, you don&#039;t need to throw your life away to find out what I am already telling you. The high is not worth it, nothing is worth what this shit does to your life, it is the epitome of misery.

				Heroin is TOO good a drug to use once and shrug off. Its tempting to think that you might have a nice weekend relaxing with a half gram or something but its not like any other drugs in that the addiction is sustainable for a long long time and its a selfish kind of drug with many heroin users liking to use in their own company. <br /><br />As a prescribed user of codeine I know the opiate buzz at its very mildest.<br /><br />I&#039;m older than most here I guess and have always given heroin a miss because I know I&#039;d be addicted in a couple of weeks. Although injecting is something I would hate to do - the cost of heroin for most working folk means that injecting is a cost factor - and you can sustain the habit in work easier than slipping off to sneak a bump or smoke some on your silver foil (why don&#039;t they use a vapouriser pipe?)<br /><br />Drugs such as E or speed or coke - these are not addictive to me as they are social drugs to me and maybe a once a year treat usually with the exception of E which I will use every few months. <br /><br />Weed is a social or use alone drug. That is my addiction but its better than most others. <br /><br />Heroin is the sneakiest of drugs and can creep up on you until one day you realize its Tuesday morning and your in need of a fix. You feel like shit but heroin can cure that instantly. Its human nature to want the easy way out and that&#039;s why people become addicts. H just has more clout than most plus its illegal and has a stigma for users which is silly when you consider a lot of heroin users are working folk. I mean they work legally in some job.<br /><br />One other factor is depression. Opiates are great for curing it and I think many addicts find a peace via opiates that they otherwise never have. If prescribed heroin would not interfere with anyone&#039;s life. For addicts sourcing a clean supply is a matter of life and death so seeing it sold here does not worry me.<br /><br />If anyone wants to be as high as heroin but play it safe - buy 5 grams of good hash - eat some of it and smoke some of it. You will end up in a state which is not far off being wasted on heroin. <br /><br />Good luck.

Id like to believe this was true but when i get high (on thc) i get paranoid and eventually fall alseep. I wish i could get the same feelings off of weed and if its possible like you say on hash i will have to give it a try. <br /><br />Personally i have a lot of experience with opiates and addiction. If you let it H will make you a shell of your former self. I used to be a cocky proud ready to fight for anything crazy young muthafucka full of piss and vinegar as the old folks say. Now i just want to hide away when i get my next fix and say FUCK THE WORLD! Opiates are the greatest escape from reality and the world. But they will change you as a person. This is the truth and anyone who says otherwise is full of shit or lying to themselves. <br /><br />I wonder if it was worth the trade sometimes, but when the shit kicks in and my eyes roll back thats all that fuckin matters. FUCK THE WORLD! Its really the most selfish act that a person can do that I can think of. It makes you just say fuck everyone else and it will change you as a person. <br /><br />I wish you the best of luck.

				^Sounds like you took too much. If you are somewhat opiate tolerant and know the feeling of &quot;too much&quot;, then nevermind.<br /><br />TBH I always wanted to know if small amounts of heroin would be a good replacement for 30mg oxycodone pills. Only addicts are able to reliably procure controlled substances in my area due to doctor paranoia, so getting a few &quot;percs&quot; legally to take whenever I need them is out of the question. Seriously, fuck staying up all night suffering. If I sprained my back or have a bad headache, I&#039;d rather take the damn oxy and just go to bed. <br /><br />I don&#039;t even enjoy the feeling sometimes, it just reminds me of being home sick with a cold at a young age. Yeah, it&#039;s nice, but there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;d want to feel like that every day. So far, I&#039;ve tried oxy, hydro, codeine, and suboxone. Yes, I tried suboxone recreationally a few times. Still.... can&#039;t.... get over... that.... TASTE. Writing that just made me nauseous. I can taste that orange satan armpit essence of nausea right now. Blehhhhh<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m not about to try H any time soon, but it would be nice to have a cheap replacement for the ridiculously expensive, hard to find oxyo/hydrocodone. I can&#039;t see it being that much more pleasurable for me, but all the stories I&#039;ve heard throughout the years tell me it&#039;s a bad idea. Sticking to pharmaceutical grade pills that I&#039;m reluctant to buy unless I need to just makes more sense.

				Whats more potent, snorting heroin or smoking it? How many milligrams of does it take for each method? I&#039;ve never snorted it before but maybe I should start. I&#039;ve always smoked it. I usually do a very small amount on top of weed, I&#039;m not into the strong heroin rush. It kind of compliments weed for me. I guess that makes me lucky for not falling victim to heroin.

				It depends entirely on the heroin. Assuming its theoretically pure (roughly pure) then you could snort 25-15mg as a start. Smoking it on top of weed is a waste though, burning the diamorphine hydrochloride destroys it completely. Even smoking diamorphine hydrochloride by the proper method of vapourization is largely inefficient and wasteful, you really want a base form to smoke. You get something of a rush from smoking heroin base, as the hit is absorbed through the capillaries before straight into the brain.

Heroin and sex CAN be amazing, but also might be just as you described it too. The trick is the dosage. Too high and you have what you just described, and too little makes it no different than normal. However, there is kind of a sweet spot (at least I have found there is for me) in terms of dosage where orgasm can be delayed almost indefinitely but the ability to maintain an erection in not affected.&nbsp; Once you find this dose for yourself, and practice a little for yourself (fapfapfap), you can pretty much control exactly when you want to bust a nut. Girls will think you&#039;re superman, but it&#039;s really just a little vitamin H&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />I have a COMPLETELY FILTHY sex story I&#039;ll share really quick since I know everyone enjoys reading those... I once knew a girl, incredibly not haggard like you&#039;d expect, I met her in rehab when she was a smoking hot 20 yr old, I was 24. Thank the good lord she was also a complete nympho. Once, she invited me over to her mom&#039;s house who was a complete pill head and virtually in a coma most of the day. Needless to say, we took advantage of the opportunity by doing lots of drugs and fucking like rabbits in her backyard guesthouse. One day while we were both experimenting with heroin and meth she showed me quite the little parlor trick -- she lined up three syringes, no. 1 contained just a little bit of dope, no. 2 meth, and no. 3 another little dope shot. After doing all three in quick succession I noticed her breathing was quite labored and intense and she had literally soaked her panties through, totally dripping wet. She fucking gave herself an orgasm with nothing but the drugs! I was absolutely astounded and I have never seen anything of the like since. Luckily she also asked me to help her reach a few more, and I felt it was my gentlemanly duty to do so *boner noise*. You know how they say once you experience sex with the right drugs you become desensitized to sober sex? It&#039;s memories like that which make me wholeheartedly agree LOL.

				If you really interested, I&#039;d sign up on opiophile.org.&nbsp; They have a lot of longtime heroin users on there, who are forthright and honest about their lives.&nbsp; Heroin isn&#039;t all bad: most lives aren&#039;t.&nbsp; But it takes more than it gives, and by the time most realize this, it&#039;s too late.&nbsp; Nobody thinks they&#039;ll become an addict.&nbsp; All the young guys that I knew, we all thought we&#039;d just chip, and could quit when we wanted: and that was true, until it wasn&#039;t true.&nbsp; Everybody chips until they don&#039;t.<br /><br />Eventually tho, your life takes a bad turn, and you have money and a good source, and you pick up a habit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think until someone has been seriously strung out, that they can understand just how good heroin can be, when you are sick.&nbsp; And then it&#039;s too late.<br /><br />To me there is no joy I&#039;ve ever encountered, like a good shot of heroin when I&#039;m sick.&nbsp; &#039;Getting well,&#039; doesn&#039;t begin to describe it.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve lost and traded in everything that ever really matters on this drug, paid all the hard prices that have been already mentioned by others, lost friends and lovers in horrible ways...and in the end, doesn&#039;t stack up to much...<br /><br />But I&#039;ve never known anybody to get talked out of it, either, so it doesn&#039;t matter what we say.&nbsp; Someday tho, that sad song Carmelita will make all kind of sense, when you&#039;re sick in some strange city, and haven&#039;t got enough to fix, and don&#039;t know anybody if you did, but it&#039;s not much to look forward to, compared to what you loose along the way...seems romantic and cool when you&#039;re very young, I suppose...

				I&#039;ve decided that I&#039;ll probably use opiates when I&#039;m older (70-80 years old). I like the ideal of sitting down and drinking a cup of opiate tea. Something about opiate tea seems more inviting then heroin.
