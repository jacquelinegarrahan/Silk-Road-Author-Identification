				Title: <strong>Questions about Injection safetly, Benzyl Alcohol, Bacteriostatic water, Ketamin</strong><br />

				Hi there,<br />&nbsp; I have an important question regarding harm reduction. My goal is to convert crystal ketamine into a sterile vial ready to inject that will hold it&#039;s shelf life and where I don&#039;t have to worry about bacteria.<br /><br />&nbsp;I have done a lot of research and have experience using steroids, and known people that have made their own home brew. Based on what I&#039;ve learned I came up with a procedure that I felt would work and wanted to reach out to the community and see if anyone with professional experience could comment on my procedure.<br /><br />Supplies<br />-Wattman wheel filters 0.22ug<br />-Benzyl Alcohol<br />-Distilled Water<br />- pressure cooker<br />-gloves/mask/hairnet<br />- still air box<br />- Sterile Vials 10ml<br /><br />Procedure:<br />- First make bacteriostatic water, by pressure cooking distilled water at 15psi for 25 minutes. Allowing to cool, and place in the still air box<br />- Once cooled add in Bezyl Alcohol at 1% by volume in still air box wearing gloves and mask<br />- Draw out bacteriostatic water into sterile 10cc syringe, and mix in to jar with product already in. Mix and let disolve<br />- Take a new sterile syringe and attach wheel filter, draw up ketamine+bacteriostatic water through Wattman wheel filter<br />- Alcohol swab the sterile vial, inject sterile solution into the vial<br /><br />My ideas on this, was the distilled water is sterilized by the pressure cooker; acting as an autoclave. Benzyl Alcohol added at 1% by volume to ward off bacteria from growing in the water/vial. Ran solution through Wattman to get out any particles and some bacteria.<br /><br />Now, I know for a fact I can use the wheel filter safely for single shots. So the wheel filter is very effective even against getting out bacteria. My goal is to have a vial I can come back to a week 2 weeks or a month down the road and have a safe to inject solution.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know is if there is any adverse reactions to mixing benzyl alcohol with ketamine, I don&#039;t have any chemistry knowledge but I assume the practices of making injectable solutions is somewhat standardized. If they use it with steroids and other injectables, why not K; is my thought process on this. From what I&#039;ve read about Benzyl Alcohol it will just prevent bacteria from growing, and it&#039;s added for shelf life.<br /><br />Please, anyone with knowledge they can add to what I&#039;ve come up with would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />

				I have very little knowledge on injecting drugs but all you said sounds very elaborate and well thought-out.

				Thanks bro! I&#039;ve tried my best to do my homework. However I have a limited understanding about medical safety, germs, sterility, and chemistry.<br /><br />&nbsp;So I just wanted to get someone with knowledge to comment to give me some confidence :)<br /><br />&nbsp;I appreciate the comment, hopefully someone else can comment and maybe we will have a safe procedure for K users to follow if they chose to go this route.<br />

				Bumpity bump bump.... nobody huh? maybe this will work. I&#039;m know now there will be no adverse reaction to mixing the K with the BA water, now it&#039;s only a question of shelf life. It&#039;s looking like I may have to just guini pig myslef. Otherwise I feel like this is a fairly sterile procedure or as sterile as it can get.<br /><br />Still would love to hear from someone knowledgeable in medicine, chemistry, or homebrew steroids....don&#039;t leave a brother hanging if you can
