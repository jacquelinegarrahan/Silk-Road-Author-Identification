				I was just wanting to know if anyone had tried the hormone(?) oxytocin?&nbsp; I am interested in trying it and was just wondering if anyone has any experience with it or opinions if it can work.<br /><br />Also does anyone know where it could be purchased online at all?<br /><br />Thanks

				It has no recreational value. It&#039;s used to induce labor in pregnant women. Oxytocin doesn&#039;t cross the blood brain barrier through intravenous or intranasal administration. Sorry... :)

				Psh, I wish it had value. I&#039;ve got unmonitored access to oxytocin, it&#039;s also used to induce dogs into labor and bring them to their milk quicker, it also cleans the dam out after she&#039;s finished giving birth so she&#039;s not leaking all over the place for the next few days.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried it and bet it&#039;s probably not a good idea for you to do so either, but I&#039;d sell it to you! ;D Lol

				That&#039;s true. But there is at least one derivate (WAY-267,464) which can cross the blood-brain barrier better than oxytocin, and also has a higher potency.<br /><br />I&#039;m very interested in this too, I hope there will be a highly potent compound that can easily cross the bb-barrier someday.

				Haha, that&#039;s a typical big-pharma molecule made by chemists who need to meet targets. Wonder if the benzodiazepine ring is the pharmacophore? Will have to do some reading tonight..

				No, I&#039;ve never tried it. I think there is still a lot of research needed on this area, but if someday a good derivative is available I&#039;ll try it for sure.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s only possible using other chemicals, but I think it actually doesn&#039;t matter a lot. As far as I know MDMA increases Oxytocin levels through the 5HT1A receptor, and any future &quot;designer-drug&quot; with a similar way of action will be interesing.
