				G&#039;day SR...<br /><br />A friend of mine (not sure how long that will last) recently dropped in to borrow some cash.. After a quick chat etc things got violent and ended up having a quick round of punches being thrown.<br /><br />He was always a great person up until about 6-8 months ago when he started using steroids and gym everyday. I also know he has PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) but no idea if/what medication someone would take for that?<br /><br />TL:DR.. what other drugs can cause irrational anger and onset of violence? (besides steroids and whatever he may be taking for PTSD) He just snapped in a split second and went bezerk :/<br /><br />Thanks..

				Steroids should be more than enough to get someone to climb up the anger ladder. If he&#039;s out of money and angry, Meth is normally a pretty good suspect as well. Sucks when people you are close to end up going on a journey like that. Obviously see if the guy wants to get some help and if you&#039;re smart let him know he&#039;s not welcome back over until he cleans up a bit, something you&#039;d hopefully be happy to help him out with.

				As others mentioned it could be any number of substances along with the possible steroids, medication, and mental instability. I&#039;ve known people who&#039;ve been taking SSRI&#039;s and other drugs in combination with certain hormones/steroids that snapped almost instantly. If you are really focusing in on it being drug use, chances are its a stimulant in combination with steroids that would make him rage. I&#039;ve seen it plenty of times when cocaine and anabols mix, guys have just freaked out, broken a ton of things like TVs, windows, etc. and then they just chill out a few minutes later. It is almost like the rage comes out of thin air, but someone with PTSD could be experiencing things you wouldn&#039;t even begin to comprehend. Lend the guy a hand if you can, it sucks to lose a friend especially to addiction, illness, or a combination of both.
