				Over the past year or so I&#039;ve significantly reduced the amount of weed I smoke, sometimes not smoking for months in a row, mostly because I really dislike the game of chance when it comes to buying from dealers. My dealer usually has high quality buds, but it&#039;s hit or miss for whether I get a lot of anxiety. Plus, lately he has almost exclusively sold kush which I don&#039;t prefer and tends to make me feel anxious.<br /><br />I&#039;m not the type of person that can just buy whatever strain my dealer has at the time and smoke it &#039;till it&#039;s gone and enjoy it. Buying 3.5g of a strain that I smoke and come to find makes me very anxious/paranoid is a downer and I usually just let it sit in a jar or sell the rest of it. <br /><br />A good friend recently ventured to Colorado and picked up several strains and gave me a sample pack. This was very nice for me because I could try different strains without dropping $50 to find I hated it. The blueberry was particularly pleasant with almost no anxiety. Same with durban poison and lemon diesal. The g-13 was a bit anxiety-inducing but that was smoked during an LSD trip so I can&#039;&#039;t really judge its true effects.<br /><br />Anyways, I appreciate anyone who took the time to read all of that, the point of this post was really to ask if anyone had any suggestions for strains that produce very little anxiety. I had a strain one time that I was never told of the name. It was home-grown locally and it was just the best high in every way: totally clear-headed, energetic, zero and I mean absolutely no trace of anxiety or paranoia. Really, all it did was improve my mood with not one bit of an impairing effect. It was perfect.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a strain that produces little to no anxiety, a bit of euphoria, very cerebral and energetic, and as little cloudy-headedness as possible. Something that I could smoke and read a book or go to work no problem.<br /><br />Any suggestions? Thanks for reading this long-winded post.

				I find blue cheese is very low anxiety. One of my staples.

That high seems to be along the lines of what you describe. Of course too much of any is probably going to make it harder to work or read a book. Smoking to me seems to be a more pleasant high, but definitely more &#039;cloudy&#039;. Vaporizing seems less &#039;cloudy&#039; than smoking but not as clear as when eaten.<br /><br />You can search most strains on leafly dot com but they don&#039;t list all strains, and they don&#039;t always detail the sativa/indicia ratio in its lineage.
