				Hi,<br /><br />Just wonder when smoking meth through a sweet puff standard glass pipe, are you meant to hold it all in like when you take a bong hit or exhaule straight away ? <br /><br />Also what purpose does rotating the pipe while your heating it up server?

				rotating the pipe is to ensure even heat distribution, the idea is to heat evenly until it vaporises but does not burn in areas where the heat is applied for too long

				Any drug that you smoke, you should intend to hold it in your lungs as long as possible. Deep, long hits are the keys to smoking. The smoke from meth isn&#039;t harsh, so it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.

				I did a test once with a 16th/oz and a sports bottle i filled w semi-crushed ice cubes- the idea being every time I took a hit, I immediately exhaled into the straw of the sports bottle and the&nbsp; cold air inside would hold the smoke down,then when the ice melted, if there were any remnant of meth left, it would be in the water. After approx 14 hrs, a good portion of my 16th was used , but there was no sign of any meth in the water. Not the most accurate test, i know but , fuck it- there wasnt the slightest bit in there.<br />My theory is that that stuff clings immediately to your lungs , just like the fog on your pipe,then dissolving on the damp bronchi-oles and passing thru into the blood stream. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Im not really sure what the contents of the smoke you blow out is, impurities perhaps, who knows- but point being is that theres no need to hold in the smoke like yuo would with weed. Maybe a second or two of holding at most is needed.

				If your meth is clear crystals it is basically the pure methamphetamine chemical. When you &quot;Smoke&quot; it from a pipe you are not actually smoking it, your Vaporizing it. That is, you are raising it&#039;s temperature to the melting point and then to the boiling point. You don&#039;t want to raise it&#039;s temperature to the thermal breakdown point.<br /><br />Rolling it dose two things. First, it distributes the heat to help prevent the meth from reaching the thermal breakdown point. Second it increases the surface area and creates turbulence to help the molecules evaporate into a gas. I find it is best to spin the pipe and hold the flame under the thin trailing end of the moving drop instead of under the droplet itself.<br /><br />Because you are not smoking i.e. your not burning it, and assuming the crystal you have is nearly pure,&nbsp; all of the vapour you are inhaling is nothing but Methamphetamine molecules. Logically there is no reason to not want to hold in the vapour until all of it has cooled back down and dissolved into the fluids in your lungs and intern the blood stream.

				Beastie a very knowledgable reply.&nbsp; You seem to be speaking from experience, and I couldnt agree more.<br /><br />
