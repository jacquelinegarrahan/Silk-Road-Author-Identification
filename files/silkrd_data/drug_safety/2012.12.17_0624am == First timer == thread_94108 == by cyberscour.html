				hi, welcome to the road and forums. I&#039;d recommend trying E first as it&#039;s &quot;softer&quot; on the mind. With E it&#039;s pretty hard not to have fun and an awesome time, couple tips for you would be make sure that the setting is good and that you won&#039;t have to worry about say trying to act sober in front of strangers and so on and going into the roll you&#039;re in a good and positive mindset instead of stressing about things. I&#039;d say just take things as they come and go with the flow (that&#039;s why they call it rolling I think, cos you seem to just roll from thoughts to thoughts and places to places without much effort) music would be awesome to whether having it in the background or you and you girlfriend dancing to it. Most people seem to like having some sort of electronic music on so if you&#039;re an edm person, you can&#039;t go wrong with your favourite mixes or playlist of electro, techno, dubstep, trance, house and so on. <br /><br />The sense of touch feels awesome when rolling especially with someone you&#039;re very intimate with taking turns giving each other massages would feel fantastic while rolling, also ciggies are a must if you&#039;re a casual / social smoker. You&#039;ll also find that you&#039;ll have the most intense and transparent conversations when rolling which is an awesome setting to really bring your relationship with the person you&#039;re rolling with to the next level.<br /><br />I think that just about covers most points you raised. I know how you feel but it&#039;s always hard to cover all bases when diving in for something like this, but if you go in with a positive expectation, you&#039;ll no doubt have one of the best experience you&#039;ve ever felt up to date.<br /><br />Enjoy the roll and let us know how you went.

				E is easier, acid is more powerful. If you eat acid, keep some kind of GABAergic around for if you feel like chilling out. A couple of nice cocktails made with good liquor softens the edges a little. Also if you do acid don&#039;t forget to check out the closed eye visuals. I never looked at them the first few times and they&#039;re great. Here&#039;s hoping you have good acid.

				What LSD tabs do you have? how many mcg are they, and from what vendor ( if not bought IRL). Also what E do you have?&nbsp; Some E pills can be just as intense for a small period as LSD, if not more. Ive taken E pills that made me feel like i was on a DMT rocket ship on the come up, and I would blow up so hard I was hardly able to see. LOL

				I just want to give you a reminder that coming up on MDMA can trigger a bit of anxiety. It is good to remember that when you are beginning to roll, it will pass.

				The best advice besides having a safe/comfortable environment would be to enlist someone who has been there before.&nbsp; They can be your trip director who can answer questions and lead you through the new sensations. LSD can very mind altering and having someone to steer you back to the right path can be important.

Reduce the risk of being around or near law enforcement while on drugs or attracting the attention of law enforcement.<br /><br />Always have on hand&nbsp; a close friend who would be sober and able to act if anything went wrong, or you need support. Having this person there physically is the best situation. On the end of speed dial is ok as well. Make sure they know that frantic calling means they should pick up.<br /><br />Think about the risks of your chosen ROA. If by mouth, will eating before, during or after effect me in a negative way? Think about what you will eat, want to eat while on your drug. MDMA makes you avoid food, while fresh fruit and vegetables taste great on LSD.<br /><br />Set aside a time and place for your drug taking, make sure that you will be comfortable taking that drug in that place. No shooting up needles in dance clubs, no LSD in crack dens, different environments, different vibes.<br /><br />Make you understand the length of the drug effect, don&#039;t take LSD at 10 in the evening if you have to be at work/school in the morning.<br /><br />Look after your diet and fitness. Eat fresh non processed foods, and lean meats. If veterinarian make sure you are taking in and adding the correct supplements.&nbsp; Exercise regularly 2-3 times a week.<br /><br />Get good sleep, sleep restores the brain chemistry balance to normal. Work with your brain chemistry and not against it.<br /><br />Be careful with the desire to re dose. Re dosing can cause you problems, set a re dose limit and stick to it.<br /><br />MDMA or LSD<br /><br />Depending on what you are after they are different drugs, different effects. Your set, setting and environment should choose which one you do first. Go to a rave, or good dance club with close friends and all take molly. You will have a great time, read about the dangers of too much water consumption, and overheating drink normally not excessively. <br /><br />If you have a free day, good weather, safe environment, 12 hours free of life interruptions, go for the LSD. Have a sitter or one on hand on the phone if needed. <br /><br /><br />
