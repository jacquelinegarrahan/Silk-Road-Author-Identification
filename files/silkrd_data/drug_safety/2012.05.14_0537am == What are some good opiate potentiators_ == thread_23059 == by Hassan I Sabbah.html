				I am expecting some killer Heroin which I plan to I.V. as soon as it arrives. I have a high tolerance and take a 90 mg. Morphine slow release at bedtime.I have done my research (Drug Forums,Blue Light,Erowid, Opiates.com )and I def don&#039;t wanna use suboxone. Of course I know that benzo&#039;s,muscle relaxants, and alcohol can help but I don&#039;t want to risk an O.D. using those substances.<br /><br />&nbsp;From what I&#039;ve gathered fresh grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolism and def makes the high more intense taken 45 minutes before a fix. I have also heard that taking Tums beforehand will alkalize the blood inhibiting the enzymes that process the H prolonging the high. I have even read that Benadryl or Dimetapp Children&#039;s Allergy Medication (both anti-histamines) act as opiate potentiator&#039;s(?!) <br /><br />Any advice here from experienced junk fiends? This is expensive shit so I wanna get a good nod going.Thanks! :)<br /><br />&quot;Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benjamin Franklin

				I&#039;ve often heard grapefruit juice was the real deal, but honestly, with methadone and other pills, I&#039;ve never noticed anything.&nbsp; Best for me, is an empty stomach, and use a beer as a kicker.<br /><br />For good sites, actually a *great* site is opiophile.org.&nbsp; For this topic and others like it.

				Grapefruit does work but you have to eat/drink quite a bit of it. I have never done opiates recreationally but I know someone who does it religiously and says it works every time.

				There are a ton, but the term &quot;opiate potentiators&quot; is too broad, not specific enough because certain potentiators only work for a specific opiate, opioid, or even ROA...<br /><br />for example, when ingesting orally, the pH of the stomach can affect bioavailability... but if you are shooting straight into the bloodstream then the absorption in your stomach doesnt matter. <br /><br />There are too many to list, chemicals include first generation anti-histamines like promethazine and hydroxyzine among many others, H-2 antagonist cimetidine, alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptor agonist clonidine, anti-cholinergics like hyoscamine and dicyclomine, drug efflux pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, other otc opioids such as loperamide (occupy peripheral receptors), and catabolic enzyme inhibitors such as tagamet and compounds in grapefruit juice. Plenty of others I am sure I am forgetting... like DXM, naproxen and quinine. A high fat meal has also been reported to increase bioavailability, and many report noticeable effects just from even a glass of milk due to the fat especially with oral oxymorphone which generally only has TEN (!!! - shock) percent&nbsp; biovailability. <br /><br />check out site below for more in depth info and a great list<br />http://opioids.com/opiates/index.html<br /><br />The reason many are probably saying the P450 enzyme inhibitors such as grapefruit juice and tagamet do not work is because they were probably using the wrong opioid, in the case of oxycodone and hydrocodone the enzymes that breakdown oxy are inhibited, therefore producing decreased 1st pass metabolism which results in more reaching the brain when taken orally, and then also increasing the half-life, extending the legs. They are not myths, but very factual reasoning based on pharmacology and experience. However, if you take codeine and say it doesnt work, well, its because you blocked the conversion to morphine... reinforcing the idea not all potentiators potentiate everything! <br /><br />PLEASE BE SAFE. Diamorphine is more potent than you probably think even though you are on morph dont load up with potentiators for your first dose. Start small with the H alone, then work your way up to your sweet spot. Then decrease that amount significantly and take a dose of ONE potentiator as well... the way people OD is by mixing a bunch of CNS depressants, or one depressant and trying to potentiate their high with too many things. Just love you and want you to be safe<br /><br />- modest mouse<br />

				forgot the best one, smoke some fine herb!<br /><br />edit: some more reading suggests certain liver enzymes are occupied by molecules in grapefruit juice, tonic water (quinine), and/or cimetidine which may decrease the processing/excretion of H as well. not sure given no personal experience with that one, H seems potent and dangerous enough as is... the best potentiator for me is just more H. lol <br /><br />- modest mouse
