				Are you burning the foil before you use it? I was always told to run the lighter all over both surfaces of the foil to burn off a coating of some kind. If you don&#039;tdo this it will taste bad,

				Hungryghost burning the foil was just a myth that was spread around as people thought that the foil was coated. <br />If the H is sweet tasting then is generally cut with something but the The more pure Heroin is the more bitter it should taste. Its also worth noting the colour of the H as well. The whiter the H the better purity, if it&#039;s salmon pink, it&#039;s almost certainly been extracted from pill form, with the darker stuff, this can be the most potent, but it can also have been cut with sleeping tablets.<br /><br />The very sweet stuff is actually sugar. It&#039;s fentanyl sold of as diamorphine mix with loads of sugar (not your typical sugar, fructose i think it was since it melts nicely). If the fentanyl mix is just right, you will pretty strong fake-diamorphine, but if the fentanyl is measured wrongly, it will probably do you nothing. <br /><br />Real diamorphine tastes bitter, the pharmaceutical batches taste bitter and the afghan/turkish imports taste bitter with a hint of ground/soil after taste. <br /><br />The reason the fentanyl batches are so sweet is because so little of it is needed and the best bulking agent to make up almost 90% of the weight is sugar. Sometimes fentanyl is mixed with normal diamorphine cut with other stuff such as paracetamol.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Turn it to #4 and inject it. The taste of heroin is just awful. Or like, I dunno, plug it. I hate insufflating and smoking heroin. I&#039;ll insufflate on the odd day I don&#039;t have a needle, but I&#039;d rather wait the week or two for my next delivery of needles. Product goes farther and the taste doesn&#039;t ruin the high, which it does for me.

				Man I love the taste of it. When I was using (I am currently not) I used to have some #3 for smoking, because I craved that taste and some #4 for snorting and IVing. I also love the taste you get in your mouth right after injection...Mmmm. Only thing I found a bit disgusting and unpleasant was the drip after snorting.

				So, I just bought a small stamp of heroin for the first time. I&#039;ve never done it before, feeling loads of excitement. It&#039;s just some tannish powder, I&#039;d like to smoke it, I mean, that&#039;s what you do right? You can smoke all types of heroin? What&#039;s the difference between #3 and #4 and why are you interested in different routes of administration depending on that magical number? I&#039;m worried about wasting it.

				Thanks for your answer. <br /><br />The first hit is not good. After I&#039;m high enough and support the taste much easier&nbsp; :D&nbsp; So finally that&#039;s cool.<br /><br />I always burn the foil before. Not sure it is useful but i prefer to do it. <br /><br /><br />

				find an old incandescent light bulb pop bottle lid and a pen tube.... Take a utility knife and cut the metal off at the base just before the threads. <br /><br /><br />use something to break the filament and get all the insides out. clean it well with hot water. <br /><br />You now put the pen tube through the pop bottle lid.... and screw on to end of hollowed out light bulb... <br /><br /><br />Put your product inside and vap away. <br /><br />
