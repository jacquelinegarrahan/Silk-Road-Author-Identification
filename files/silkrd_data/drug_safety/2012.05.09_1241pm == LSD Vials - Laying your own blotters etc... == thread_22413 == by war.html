				If I were able to get 5ml of LSD what is the difficulty level in laying my own sheets?&nbsp; Also I am having a hard time figuring out the conversion rate of ml - ug.<br /><br />Anyways, any helpful advice or links on this would be greatly appreciated.... I am assuming at least semi-special tools are needed for this.

				Difficult level would be 34,2 :P<br /><br />For any practical calculations, you first need to know how much LSD is dissolved in your 5ml. Without that data all we can do is guess. The procedure is to have a know concentration then measure out the desired one, which you then add to the blotter.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure someone would come with a ghetto way but if not, micropipette is the way to go. I recommend some practice with test substances (don&#039;t have to be drugs), just to get a feel for it.<br /><br />And sarah is right, you need a blessing of your local hippie chief or else this will fail. And your karma has to be extra pure. And you can&#039;t have burger on that day. Or OJ.

				Now, I am no expert at all, but I do not think that there is a conversion from millilitres to micrograms.<br />How many micrograms of LSD there are present in a ml of a given solution are entirely dependent on the concentration of the solution, which is variable but should be known by the vendor.<br />Typically one drop is about 0.03ml or so and each drop usually carries from 100 to 150 micrograms of LSD.

				There IS a conversion from ml to ug but you have to know density and some other factors.<br /><br />Anyways, I am DEFINITELY into the good karma/being pure thing while handling the acid but unfortunately I dont have too many ties deep within the hippie culture locally :(<br /><br />Will I still be able to practice enough with other substances to be able to lay this liquid myself?

				Not quite war, you need to know the concentration of the solution and the volume of a drop.<br />By using a micro pipette you can accurately measure out one drop in ml (or fractions thereof) and then by using the concentration from the supplier you can work out the ug in each drop.<br />Generally though liquid is diluted such that one drop is equal to one dose, so just apply one drop to each blotter/sugar cube/jelly star/ whatever you are using.
