				So I have had a gram of AMT sitting around my house for some time now and last night i decided to give it a try so I wraped up about 30-40 mgs in some toiletpaper and made a bomb. <br /><br />About an hour an a half after taking it I started throwing up, which I hear is pretty normal around that time. But after I got done throwing up It was alright. That stuff didnt really take over my thoughts and made me think like most psychedelics, but I forsure had open and closed eye visuals. I want to say I didnt really peak until about 6 hours after consuming it. I say this stuff is decent but I dont think Its worth the puking. <br /><br />If I ever plan to trip 12-14 hours again im just going to take some good ole&#039; Lucy&nbsp; ;D

				I appreciate the review. Could you compare it to any other drugs, though? I&#039;m kinda interested in taking it myself, but haven&#039;t had the opportunity yet, and am wondering if I should do so in the immediately future or later in the future.

				hmm.. well I suppose I could compare the visuals to LSD. but that wasn&#039;t until about 6 hours after taking it. and the peak didn&#039;t last that long maybe 45 minutes.

				I hear vomiting is common though i have been lucky enough never to suffer from it off AMT.<br /><br />I am a fairly big chap (around 105kg) and i drop in 40mg caps, takes about 3 or 4 hours to really get going but i found the peak to last for ages and ages, not the 45min you reported :/ i would say peak was around 4 hours maybe from my experiences, a great party drug as i find it incredibly lovey

				Well I may be a little off on time for the peak but I would say It lasted more than 2 hours. Thats when I had the strongest visuals

				Yea actually visual wise maybe that timings about right, for me the enjoyment out of this drug was far more centered around how happy i felt and how everything i was doing, seeing and hearing seemed completely amazing. My senses were just in complete overload, total euphoria<br /><br />&nbsp;And to be able to wake up the next day and feel no negative affects was the icing on the cake

				Great topic OP.<br /><br />Have been wanting a first-hand review on this substance ever since it went up for sale.<br /><br />Do you think that the visuals occur due to toxicity and overstim @ the 5HT2A site @ 5-6 hours?<br /><br />I think drugs that peak later rather than sooner seem to feel more toxic. Another thing, does this drug feel toxic during the visual part/ mental part of the trip after the nausea/ vomiting occurs?<br /><br />I&#039;d be very interested in trying to smoke 8-15mg sometime soon.<br /><br />Again, thanks for the post- cool stuff.<br />J

				Id recommend taking orally over smoking, most of the smoked reviews ive read seem to be quite negative, apparently the smell and taste when burnt is awful aswell.

				i think 15mg is too low a dosage to really get much out of, research suggests doing 30-50mg as a dose (after doing a 1-5mg allergy test)

				My first AMT trip was a disappointment. Me and two friends took 40mg. of freebase each. Neither of us got any visuals, and mostly just felt drunk. Well, maybe drunk with a line of amphetamine added. Next time I&#039;ll try 80mg. if that won&#039;t be good then I must have shitty aMT...
