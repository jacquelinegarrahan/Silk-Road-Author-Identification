				Im a new user to meth and have some questions and trying to keep myself educated to not fall into traps of addiction. Ive been reading tons about meth and its effects from erowid, drugs-forum and here as well as many other sources for at least 3 years and yesterday was the first time i got &quot;proper smashed&quot; after&nbsp; a recent second attempt at trying it.<br /><br /><br />so my topic for today is - why do people go on several day binges on the stuff?<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to insult anybody here but i think its an incredibly crazy thing to do! it seems like allot of people are trying meth for the first few times times and they are staying awake for 3 days. to me that signals an instant pathway to addiction and damage to your brain.<br /><br />is it done because it is fun, the high gets better or just pure ignorance some people have on the dangers it will have on their body? i also do understand the &quot;escape from the comedown by redosing&quot; problem.<br /><br /><br />feel free to call me out on this one: i will never go on multi-day binges as described above! <br /><br /><br />NOTE:: while it may be linked, we aren&#039;t talking about &quot;becoming an addict&quot;, or &quot;daily addicts that use daily&quot;.. we are talking about deliberate extended usage- when people go on meth runs when they don&#039;t necessarily have a daily use problem or current addiction.<br /><br />i would like to hear why people do these binges considering the vast amount of harm it causes a user on so many levels.

				thanks for your reply. I had a feeling what you said was the truth but i just wanted to make sure seeming allot seem to do it as an activity.<br /><br /><br />we can put a vast majority of it too:<br /><br />1.) lack of education / ignorance<br />2.) lack of self control<br />3.) they may not care about their health<br /><br /><br />Therefore there is no valid or justifiable reason to go on binges.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just heard some people say &quot;it gets better on the second day&quot; and after a bit of thought that means those types of reasons apply to number 1 and 3<br /><br />Even if you are on a holiday in a foreign country and you got a few grams of the best meth in the world and you want to use it all before you leave (due to getting busted) you fall under the number 3 category.<br /><br /><br />
