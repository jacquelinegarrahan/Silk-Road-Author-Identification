				So I did 250mg of MDPV, actually not quite because there was spillage. I&#039;m a bit wacky afterwards. I can&#039;t concentrate, I can&#039;t think the same there is always like this dialogue in my head between me and the people I talk to. I&#039;ve used this drug on numerous occasions. I dug up some heavy shit a week beforehand when it became obvious that by any objective definition my mother despises me. I&#039;ve been thinking of seeing a shrink, now I can&#039;t stop thinking about talking to people.<br /><br />It&#039;s fucked up, I mean I&#039;m pretty dysfunctional the place looks like a smack den and wow. I&#039;m batshit bonkers bizarre. Beyond a shrink, any ideas? Any drug suggestions?

				When did you dose the MDPV? How long has it been?<br /><br />Maybe a benzo may be able to help you out a bit. But I would personally talk to a professional about it first before self-medicating.<br /><br />I remember one time I took half a gram of a stimulant RC (sold legally at a store) and I wasn&#039;t quite right for a few days afterwards. I was worried but I felt improvement as time went on.

				It&#039;s been about a month.<br /><br />Thing is it seems to largely be psychological and about what I obsessed about on the high.<br /><br />I was taken of flupentixol beforehand, it might be being without that.<br /><br />Uhm there&#039;s something else it will come later I can&#039;t structure much properly and that&#039;s a big problem I&#039;ve been a coder my whole life. I am useless like this, almost more useless than a corpse.

				Are you prone to having psychotic or paranoid episodes or anything like that? I don&#039;t know the reasons behind the flupentixol being prescribed.<br /><br />But the combination of being taken off an anti-pyschotic drug and taking a high dose of a stimulant can definitely have an effect.<br /><br />My best advice man is to get some professional help and be 100% honest. It sounds like being put back on the flupentixol may not be a a bad idea.<br /><br /><br />Stay positive though man! You&#039;ll get through this. You may just need a helping hand.

				250mg would be one fucking massive dose for me, but I&#039;ve heard of people blowing through that in a night or less... so I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Obviously without a tolerance though, that&#039;s not really important.&nbsp; When doses as small as 5-10mg increments are active, you basically took 25-50 doses.&nbsp; Damn, son&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />So why were you on an antipsychotic in the first place?&nbsp; Frankly I strongly suspect that&#039;s the reason for your lasting impairment.&nbsp; It seems much more likely to me than long-term MDPV damage.&nbsp; But I have heard of that... never known anybody who went that hard on it or anything though, so I don&#039;t even know if that&#039;s just myth (and let&#039;s be honest, with the stims there&#039;s a fucking lot of those, so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it&#039;s bullshit ya know).<br /><br />If it&#039;s any kind of option, try getting back on your med.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even have to mention the MDPV.&nbsp; Just say that you&#039;ve had some severe adverse reactions to discontinuing the medication -- hopefully whoever was providing it just doesn&#039;t realize what they&#039;ve done by taking you off of it, and will put you back on it once they&#039;re aware of your troubles.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t help or isn&#039;t possible... I dunno man, but I&#039;ll say this: emotional pain isn&#039;t the only thing that time heals.&nbsp; The human brain is unbelievable.&nbsp; It can recover from damn near anything with enough time and a little effort.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how you could have fucked yourself up for life with this one incident.&nbsp; Be optimistic, man -- even beyond being more pleasant, it really does help good things happen when you expect good things to happen :)

				I completely agree with what you&#039;ve said except I would highly advice telling the professional about the MDVP. Especially if it was the MDVP that triggered the episode. It&#039;s valuable information and realistically you&#039;re trusting the person with your well-being so you may as well trust the person with the truth..particularly as it may be beneficial for your health.<br /><br />Stay safe guys!

				The flupentixol was prescribed when I was a huge weed smoker for drug induced psychosis, I can&#039;t seem to handle bud very well. I also have post traumatic stress disorder.<br /><br />Ultimately with drugs it&#039;s better to be heuristic and consider things for each individual. The MDPV lasted me a few days or so.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen psychiatric nurses at the hospital and the drug is rare in Australia. I have chlorpromazine but I&#039;m dumb as fuck on it. It&#039;s weird. I&#039;ll have to wait until my next psychiatrist appointment before I really get to find out wtf I&#039;ve done.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had 25i-NBOMe before I&#039;ve ordered some it really clears my head the next day. Should be fun, seems to be the best course of action ultimately MDPV is a new challenge for the head shrinking business so... I guess I&#039;ll just blow my mind.<br /><br />Oh, my God, what have I done? (Do it again) All I wanted was a little fun (Do it again)<br />Got a brain like bubble gum (Do it again) Blowing up my cranium (Do it again)

				Seems like a big chance for you. You dug up a rotten root of your personal history. Drugs won&#039;t help you much without a bit of work on yourself. Try those:<br /><br />Miller, Alice:<br />Breaking Down the Wall of Silence: The Liberating Experience of Facing Painful Truth<br /><br />Bradshaw, John<br />Bradshaw On: The Family: A New Way of Creating Solid Self-Esteem<br /><br />Work a bit with those, then I would recommend MDMA in a place were you can be comfortable for some hours. AnimusVox has a pretty good thread on keeping neurotoxicity at bay.<br /><br />all the best<br />&nbsp;

				My personal experience with MDPV as it has the worst drug induced phycosis i have ever experienced. Literally watching 20 cop cars pull up and come running at your with guns drawn. close eyes, then open, they are still there yelling at you loudly &quot;get on the ground now&quot;!!! it all disappears when a car drives by, but then that car has blue flashing lights, it pulls up and you can still hear the cops talking about how they are going to assault the premises you are in. Started on the third day into the bender, by the 6th day i have literally moved cities! Usage would have been 1 gram over 6 days vaporized of tin foil.<br /><br />Your brain patterns change after mdpv and it seems to make mountains out of mole hills. You only start noticing this months later after you start rebuilding damaged relationships. Before this experience i thought meth had a bad physosis, but know now its a walk in the park.<br /><br />Respect mdpv and enjoy responsibly.
