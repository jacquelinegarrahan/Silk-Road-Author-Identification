				So SWIM is the boring fuck next door who never does drugs, but we got our outlaw paws on some Moroccan pollen hashish bar. It is hard as a sea biscuit, but good quality.<br /><br />We don&#039;t want to make an alcoholic soup out of it, neither do we want to be fucking about in the kitchen making canna-anything. And we are not going to play with red hot knives -what are you, nuts? Besides, that is for hash oil, and it&#039;s so ghetto the fuck outta my kitchen.<br /><br />We have so far vaped it, the results were we got baked nicely, but are we on the right thermodynamic track here by assuming that the hash will burn down in an &#039;erosion&#039; type of reduction with each vape, or are we gonna end up with a charred bit of charcoal on the outside with the good stuff still locked up in the core of the cooled hash?<br /><br />We think that vaporizing it once it has been reduced to hash-dust with an apothecary&#039;s mortar is the way to go.<br /><br />We tried bonging it, but it seems wasteful, the smoke is intense, and vaping it seems is a good way to get the goodness without the harshness.<br /><br />But, does anyone else out there have any ideas? Erowid and Bluelight were not very helpful. Anyone? <br /><br />

				Edar, <br />You serious? We know THC is fat soluble but is not heat also needed to release the actives? Eating takes way too long, we want everything yesterday, but in the interests of scientific research, do let us know a bit more plz.&nbsp; :)

				@MaidMandy,<br /><br />Thats the juice containers and the device kind of shotguns you right? That sounds worth a try, but maybe i can figure a way to use a bike tyre pump or something too. <br />I have hyper-sensitivity to smoke, due to doing so much poppers, so vaping is best for me, but vaping means redosing every 30 mins as well, and i never really get off the planet, which would be lovely... I may have to build wunna doze. Thanks.<br />

Let the hash burn at the top of the bottle in tin foil. Then let the water flow out of a hole at the bottom of the container. The water flow causes the container to fill with smoke and then you inhale. It burns for a second but you get so toasted from it. You definitely won&#039;t want to reload within 30 mins - not if the hash is any good anyway :)

				We read the construction instructions on Erowid (have not found the utube video, but they censor there, the arselickers.) The writer wrote that when you &#039;operate&#039; the gravity bong, the smoke is &#039;forced&#039; into your lungs... owww! it would be there a millisecond before I fell over coughing tears of blood. That&#039;s the damn problem, holding the shit down there for anything more than a sec or two is very difficult for this naked ape.

				Only shit advice in this thread so far... Using a vaporizer is just fine. If you have trouble crushing your hash, try heating the end of the bar with a lighter. The heat will make it crumbly and you can kinda rub it off with your fingers.

				Best if you heat the hash first, don&#039;t worry if you burn the outside a little.<br /><br />I hate tobacco, but if you smoke the best bet (given that it is dry stuff)&nbsp; is to make it powdery and sprinkle it through a cig.&nbsp; Otherwise do the same with a joynt. You can still taste the hash over the top of weed.<br /><br />If you want to be stingy, heat the point of a needle and push it in to a small crumb and light it up,&nbsp; hold a straw or mouth piece or cut top of a drink bottle to catch the smoke and inhale....<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
