				Ok- I am a journeyman junkie with, of course, a scrip for suboxone. As we know, 2 mg of suboxone contains .5 mg of Naloxone, or Narcan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; My doctor has assured me that the naloxone is just there to assure that the suboxone doesn&#039;t get shot up, as opposed to retarding the effects of opioids. This is significant because, when I wake up sick, I like to do 2 mg of suboxone so I can cope with things- but once I can cope, I want to go score, and, of course, I want to get the full effect of the dope.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I am pretty sure that the 2 mg of sub&nbsp; does not interfere (much) with the dope, if at all. The other crucial point is the method of administration. The subs need to be sublingual. But Naloxone is supposed to be IV, so sublingual admin may not be effective on that basis.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The other day I did 4 mg in the morning and got high that night.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; How much of the effect of the dope am I losing? Surely there are people with experience on this issue out there.

				Naloxone aside, the buprenorphine has a much higher affinity to receptor sites, and will bind to them much more readily than the molecules of your opiate of choice, so there must be some blocking effect going on...&nbsp; How much probably depends on your tolly, body chemistry, strength of your dope and how much you take.&nbsp; And other factors, too.&nbsp; Seems like I&#039;ve read that the full blocking effect is somewhere above 2mgs, although you&#039;ve gone up to four and still gotten quite high...&nbsp; When I maintained on subs, I could still get high, and although I was taking less than 2mgs per day, it took more H than it normally would without the subs<br /><br />I know most people on subs will quit for about 24 hours so as not to reduce their ability to get high when they indulge, but you seem to not have to worry about it...&nbsp; So just keep on doing what you&#039;re doing, I suppose!

				Dude, Sub blocks god damn everything that&#039;s nice. Even after stopping 4 days of that (long time ago with me) I still couldn&#039;t get a decent high/buzz. That is some powerful stuff. Really locks onto your receptors and doesn&#039;t let anything kick them off.<br />

				I wouldnt consider myself a journeyman, but I got hooked on H for a while and used subs I bought from a friend to get off the daily use.&nbsp; I dont understand why you would even mess with the subs while using H on a daily basis.&nbsp; Im sure this is going to make me sound naive, but wouldnt it save you a ton of money if you saved some of your H for the morning so that you could use that to get well enough to go get more?&nbsp; And also wouldnt run the risk of wasting any of your dope when you use that after subs in the morning?&nbsp; Sorry Im just trying to understand.&nbsp; Also Im sorry about your situation.&nbsp; Waking up sick is such a shitty way to go through life.&nbsp; Be safe.
