				I think this is a good idea. Maybe not for things like Xanax powder or Moxy which require doses &gt;10mg. But for things like MDMA, ketamine coke etc.. it&#039;ll be good. Maybe even 2cb..<br />I have some precession scales so I can upload of pictures if I have the time soon. I can use UK currency. <br />Will also have to make sure the substance is completely crushed and as flat as I can get it on the surface.

				How awesome of you! You&#039;ll be helping more folks than you know. <br /><br />I was also thinking that if the pile was spread out evenly in a line...you could place a ruler or tape measure beside it for added comparison. <br /><br />Think I should link to where you upload your pics in this thread or create a whole separate thread that could later possibly be stickied? <br /><br />Should they be on the onion network for safety reasons? <br /><br />Scrubbing the metadata before upload is probably a good idea too. <br /><br />Now we need someone from the US and other countries to volunteer a few minutes of their time.

				Yeah ruler is a good shout. Of course I would remove all meta/exif data lol, uploaded to a onion uploader. <br />I can probably do some point over the weekend:<br />MDMA and MDA, I&#039;m guessing these would have the same molecular weight?<br />Ketamine<br />Cocaine<br />2cb<br />GHB powder.<br />Probably some others as well. <br /><br />Though I think 0.000 scales are essential for all chemical users, obviously there is going to be a small minority who don&#039;t purchase them so I think this could be pretty useful for them.

				Density varies significantly. Think about fine powdered MDMA vs brown sugar lump MDMA. DMT can vary in density be over 40%.<br /><br />You cannot judge the weight of a powder by its volume.

				You&#039;ve all made very valid points and I completely agree. I play devil&#039;s advocate for the sake of lively discussion as well sometimes too. <br /><br />However, I still feel that the amount of people purchasing on here without scales is probably much higher than any of us think. It&#039;s such a simple and easy way to help others that I see the benefits far outweighing any negative. Think about it. If you were 16 years old with a part time job and you get paid your measly $150 a week and you want to party down. Think they are more concerned with buying scales or drugs? <br /><br />I know...16 year old kids shouldn&#039;t be using drugs at all...but they do. It&#039;s obvious they are here and buying.<br /><br />Every action we take as responsible drug users will help other become responsible drug users as well. <br />People are going to experiment and have fun and push the limits. Really though, how hard is it to make a measurement and take a pic then upload it? I do it all the time for clearnet sites.&nbsp; <br /><br />This could have great benefits for all of society. Maybe I&#039;m too utopian in my view of the world but it takes just a little effort from a few people to have a dramatic impact sometimes. <br /><br />PLUR<br /><br />

				With exploring new substances like 2C-B this has also become a problem to me. More than it was before with MDMA for obvious reasons.<br />Now I&#039;m measuring the MDMA with a dosage spoon that holds 120mg, this may be not super accurate because of the different densities of MDMA and of what the dosage spoon is for, but it seems to work really well.<br /><br />With 2C-B I just eyeball it with a knife from 100mg into 20mg or from 20mg into 5mg. But I would say +-5mg are not a problem with 2C-B, I know the whole world says the exact opposite, but this is my experience with it. I would also take 40mg+ as an initial dose without worries it could be to intense after my first trip on it, maybe you should do it differently if you want the pure safeness.

				Experience does help. Most kids have no experience. If I trusted my scales more I&#039;d do it myself but I figured someone would have the few minutes it takes to get their nice scales out and measure they have in stock. Could even write a note under the product with it&#039;s weight in the pic with the ruler or coin or whatever.

				I don&#039;t think such a guide would be a good idea, considering that the same substance from two different sources can have a completely different consistency (light and fluffy vs. dense and chunky), and therefore still render this sort of eyeballing inaccurate and dangerous.<br /><br />Just buy the damn scale. Hell, I got my milligram scale for $20 two years ago and it still works to this day. Sure, it&#039;s not the most accurate thing, but for the substances I&#039;m working with (all have dosages well above 10 mg), it works excellently, and I&#039;ve never had anything close to an accidental OD. If you&#039;re working with more sensitive substances, then you might have to take the plunge and buy a much higher quality scale, which will be quite expensive, but worth it for your own safety. <br /><br />I think you all have great intentions, but ultimately this just sounds dangerous. Even if everything is crushed into a fine powder, you just can&#039;t be certain what the actual density of the material you&#039;re dealing with is, due to the volume of air trapped in the solid.<br /><br />This will not &quot;reduce harm&quot;. Instead, it will make people more secure with their decision to not use a scale. If you want to reduce actual overdoses, we need to actively be putting it out there that eyeballing is NEVER a safe choice, even when working with familiar substances that you&#039;ve already weighed.<br /><br />If you have any questions for me, feel free to drop me one. I just want you all to be safe, and eyeballing (even with a guide) is NOT a safe practice.<br />

				I totally agree with the above. <br /><br />People are generally just very, very, bad at eyeballing amounts of anything. <br /><br />This has nothing to do with drug use or difficult quantities at all.

				Indeed - negative karma means either that someone does not agree with you, or that you are talking shit. Perhaps i do a fair bit of the latter, i have no clue really.<br /><br />Anyone else venture to guess how many grams a normal cube of sugar weighs?

				+1 Anonypunk for the idea and write-up. I&#039;m in the &quot;just buy some&quot; category as I&#039;ve invested in multiples and I&#039;ve used some that were less than 30 that went to .001. Obviously there is an error margin to be respected but if you&#039;re careful even ones that cheap can get you some reliable numbers to work with in the +- 5mg range. <br /><br />That said, I agree that there are some that just will not bother with scale safety or may be in a position where they don&#039;t/can&#039;t use scales (party, sudden breakdown of scales, rush, out of town, etc, etc) so I think some scale pictures of finely crushed drugs presented in a variety of weights both in piles on scales and then set up into lines of different lengths/thickness so there are plenty of reference points for others to use. <br /><br />I&#039;d be happy to present some pictures of some different products.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

They might, however, check out a picture: The density will be different but that&#039;s why an average from multiple pictures/sources would be optimal. Those who aren&#039;t going to bother weighing might at least benefit from a more accurate ballpark than &quot;eyeball&quot;. You think &quot;eyeballers&quot; are any less confident because they don&#039;t have reference tables? They size up lines according to what they&#039;ve taken before (a practice far worse than the disservice of giving users baseline sizes)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why you come across as trying to convince me. I weigh compulsively. I don&#039;t think having pictures available would discourage people from buying scales because &quot;they can just check out the pictures&quot;, either they will have scales and the pictures or only supplemental or they won&#039;t and the pictures are the only reference they have. Regardless, you&#039;ve solidified your point. This isn&#039;t an endeavor I&#039;d look into as a personal project so I&#039;ll move on. <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

Do you think I really care that much about you? As if you are soooo important that my whole world is falling apart.&nbsp; Hahaha.<br /><br />&quot;Oh No! What should I do? Someone is pointing out valid points that don&#039;t agree with mine...and I just can&#039;t handle the reality of the situation. So Nah! There&#039;s negative karma for you!

I&#039;ll say it again. I never gave you negative karma. <br /><br />You actually appear to be pretty good at providing your own negative karma. On a first world scale. Speaking of scales what was I going to say? <br /><br />***I know this isn&#039;t safe to do people! Remember the title to the post (that I wrote)? The idea isn&#039;t stupid and irresponsible nor would it encourage others to forgo the use of scales to make a decision of proper dosing amounts. It would be supplemental in nature and that could be clearly written at the top. (see)<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s quite fine to think that the idea is dumb but I still refuse to believe that it would encourage others to take this as their one and only guide to measure their doses. Hell even the little scoop spoons I have are pretty accurate and they were cheap as fuck. Just like my scales. <br /><br />There is basically nothing else for me to say regarding this whole thing and I never intended for anyone to get bent out of shape. If it offends you and you think that the idea is stupid that&#039;s okay too. You can just as easily start a thread flaming on me for giving a shit and spreading stupid ideas that will eventually hurt the community. That won&#039;t make it true in any way but if it makes you feel better then go ahead. <br /><br />Will those that want to contribute PM me so I can help with whatever I can help with? I wish I could make a private thread but notepad and copying and pasting into messages here can work just as well. I&#039;ll go ahead and type out a simple format and Intro and let anyone else to add and contribute to it as they&#039;d like. I don&#039;t think this is something that has to be force fed to people. Just something that could be available for those who don&#039;t have access to what they need at the moment. It would be better than nothing...especially with some of the RC&#039;s that are and have been hurting so many kids.

				This definitely sounds like it could help, but honestly, you can buy a mg scale off amazon for like $21, $30 with 2 day shipping. I know it&#039;s not the greatest possible scale, and you can&#039;t get that accurate of a reading on some RC&#039;s, but it helps a lot.

				@Anonypunk: Glad to hear you&#039;re still on board with this. I didn&#039;t even check names and assumed I got a reply from the thread-starter. I&#039;ll PM you.<br /><br />@CannabisCrusader: This is more or less my sentiment but the fact that people still don&#039;t use scales says to me that it&#039;s not an issue of cost but an issue of apathy. Some people just don&#039;t care that much (which is rather scary). It&#039;s for that reason that I like anonypunk&#039;s idea: obviously such a thread would encourage scale usage and emphasize just how unreliable eyeballin even with reference photos can be but it&#039;d be better than nothing.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Sorry that was for CannabisCrusader:<br /><br />I know that. Other people know that. People still don&#039;t do it. Think of it as supplemental and that may help you see the point. <br /><br />@ Snoopish. Thanks man! I&#039;m glad that you see my point. I don&#039;t need validation from others to go ahead with it but was hoping that everyone wouldn&#039;t be playing devils advocate.<br /><br />&nbsp;I see both sides of this equally well so I get what others are saying. The opposing viewpoint just isn&#039;t convincing enough for me to say that it wouldn&#039;t help at all you know? I know it&#039;s not possible but I&#039;d hate to see the actual amount of kids out there doing incorrect amounts and eyeballing their doses every damn day.
