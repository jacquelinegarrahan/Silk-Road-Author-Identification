				Wondering what a safe dose is for someone my size. I have very little tolerance to amphetamines at the moment (rolled on 1g of methylone in 1 day bout a week in a half ago, but before that it has been months). Here is a c&amp;p from my post in the meth vendors review thread:<br /><br />This is my first time trying meth. I feel pretty good, off about an eye balled 20mg (ordered .25g so it&#039;s fairly easy to eye ball). I think i might have taken closer to 30mg-35mg though, did a few small bumps.&nbsp; Any dosage recommendations? I&#039;m a bit over 6&#039;1&quot; 175 lbs lean<br /><br />The dose I&#039;m on at the moment feels about the speediness of 90mg adderall, but much less euphoria. Not much empathy compared to methylone or mdma. Low-med euphoria, med-high speediness. Feelin pretty good. i&#039;m thinkin this will be a good adderall alternate for homework/class. Btw, I have taken 120mg doses of adderall (generally do 90mg at a time) and upwards of 280mg vyvanse (usually do 210mg and bump 70mg&#039;s slowly after a few hours). I never really go under 60mg adderall or 140mg vyvanse. NOT the smartest idea, but safety precautions are ALWAYS taken, such as multi before/during/after, and slammin down protein shakes with a lot of amino acids :) Also obviously stay EXTRA hydrated<br /><br />ALSO: Last dosed about 4 hours ago, definitely wanting to do more, I still feel speedy but not a whole lot of euphoria

				I would highly recommend against pushing meth beyond 50mg, but most people tend to do so anyways. Nasty side effects can start beyond that range for some people. Of course, people will dose far, far beyond that and be &quot;fine&quot;, but it&#039;s quite risky. Just dose enough until you find your good &quot;place&quot;, and try not to push too far beyond it. The more you redose, the more nasty effects you can have as well. <br /><br />Basically, you know your own body, so keep it reasonable and don&#039;t push it farther than you need to. Erowid is always a great resource for these things as well.

				no problem, stay safe! also, if you can give it a chance, try doing meth orally. I&#039;ve actually made oral my ROA of choice, once I realized that it&#039;s nearly just as good as insufflation. Plus you&#039;ll be doing your nose a big favor!
