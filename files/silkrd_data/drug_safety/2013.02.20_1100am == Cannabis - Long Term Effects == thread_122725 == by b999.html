				I&#039;ve been using pot on and off over my life.&nbsp; My interest toward middle age has taken a resurgence.&nbsp; I really do enjoy a &#039;drink&#039; on weekends or after work shall we say.&nbsp; But I really need to be on the ball otherwise..&nbsp; Anyone have any experience with long term use and the effects?&nbsp; What about if you want to start a family, so effect on sperm or genetics and all that..<br /><br />I&#039;m about to pick up an ounce to see how far that takes me.&nbsp; So I&#039;m curious how it&#039;s worked out for you people... do you get a tolerance btw?&nbsp; I know some people who go through an ounce a week or even more, but surely a casual user would last quite some time on an ounce of good stuff.

				i dont think there is any evidence that it will affect your genes or sperm<br /><br />chronic, excessive consumption of cannabis may impair your short-term memory.<br /><br />cannabis smoke may be a cause of cancer.<br /><br />it may also contribute to the development of schizophrenia in those with a genetic predisposition to it.<br /><br />i say &#039;may&#039;, because the evidence for all this isn&#039;t conclusive. <br /><br />for me the only negative effects of marijuana - laziness, depression - occur with excessive daily consumption.&nbsp; they go away after i take a break.

				I smoke since 17 years now every day, sometimes i stop for one or two months in order to see if all is good with my brain.<br /><br />I can tell you that:<br /><br />IF you have NO mental problem in your family,<br /><br />CANNABIS is the less harmful drug you will have the opportunity to try in your life and finally the most &quot;connected&quot; with the universe drug. I know what i&#039;m talking about.<br /><br />I stuck with this drug for so long because with it i never felt sick or damn what &quot;disconnected&quot; with my soul.<br /><br />I never felt depression, sickness, uncontrollable or whatever after smoking thousands of joints, i&#039;m never ill with cannabis. And i never lose my soul i mean i always can be a good person when with all the other drugs, tobacco included, i&#039;m quite upset sometimes and not connected, not here.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like when i&#039;m not the master of the game.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget! The Life is the Game!<br /><br />Toke with responsability and smile with life.

				If you&#039;re not predisposed to any psychotic problems, you should be fine. The worst thing you may suffer from is laziness and lack of motivation. Weed is not physically addictive and causes some short term memory loss. I&#039;ve been smoking everyday for 5 years, attend college, run a business, and interact socially without any problems. But, to each his own.
