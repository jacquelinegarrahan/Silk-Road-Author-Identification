				i consider myself an experienced roller.&nbsp; i did the whole candygirl thing back from 99 to &#039;04 when the last ebbs of the rave scene were still strong in the mid-atlantic.&nbsp; and while pill quality gradually went down, i do remember some truly excellent rolls that weren&#039;t in my first 2 or 3.&nbsp; now i wonder were these just super higher doses of MDMA or some perfect combo of MDMA, MDA, or MDE?&nbsp; i really want to replicate this old school effect n i&#039;ve been getting some great shard MDMA on SR.&nbsp; it felt awesome, and the magic was still there (even tho i&#039;ve rolled like 20 or 25 times i took a 8 year break).&nbsp; it just was missing something.&nbsp; the euphoria wasn&#039;t quite right.&nbsp; i took 150 mg.&nbsp; wonder if i should push up to 200 or 250 or will this make it worse?<br />are there any sweet combos of MDxx that have proven to have that crushing, i-love-the-world euphoria?<br />just curious as to what others do when u have the raw ingredients and you know what they are vs. having mystery pills.<br />anyone combined 4-MEC with MDMA?&nbsp; i&#039;m curious about that one (4-MEC feels like ultra-short MDMA to me and I still have a small stash)<br /><br />*destiny*

				I don&#039;t know what the ratio of the mixture was, but I thoroughly enjoyed Dopeboy&#039;s MDMA + MDEA. I&#039;ve never tried MDEA by itself though, but the roll was perfect to me. It was not too long, nor too short, I feel like I kind of slipped into the feeling, and it was just really really nice. I didn&#039;t ever feel scared or worried or sad, it was just ecstasy.

				I hear that MDA+MDMA is the best combo ever. I plan on trying it eventually, the energy of MDA and the euphoria of MDMA seem like they&#039;d compliment each other nicely.
