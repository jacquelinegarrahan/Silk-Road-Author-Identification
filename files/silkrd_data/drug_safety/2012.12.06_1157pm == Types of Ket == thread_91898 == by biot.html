				I love K and have tried several vendors. Many were similar some stood out. Except from experience I don&#039;t really know the difference between types. I just tried S-iso and it was clean, didn&#039;t make me as groggy, and everything felt very cleansing. But I still prefer what&#039;s listed as Indian Ket. Is that different than racemic?

				Thanks taller, that was my guess after trying S. I felt white and cool and clean, but not as rich of a k-hole until well into the bag. It was nice for a fading winter day holding onto the faint shadows from the sun and overwhelming whiteness of it all. But the racemic gets me where i like to be. Thinking all eternity has been this experience of neverending transformations where I am just in existance. ah, dose me :)
