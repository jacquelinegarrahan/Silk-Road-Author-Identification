				I&#039;m wondering if I should do an ammonia wash to help get rid of that smell because I was reading that it is supposed to smell more like moth balls.&nbsp; Is the chemical smell residue from a shitty tek?&nbsp; What&#039;s going on?&nbsp; The color is a kind of translucent tan/orange.

				Mine was more akin to jungle spice so it was pretty yellow with more plant alkaloids, and it did have a chemmy mothball like smell. It&#039;s supposed to have that smell, and the almost burning plastic or like an old tire taste. The taste is actually like a loop for me sometimes, and it smells and tastes like an old tire, takes me back to the same place sometimes. <br /><br />But yeah to answer your question, unless it doesn&#039;t reek like chemical, but has a dull, strong mothball like odor, it should be fine. DMT color can range from orange, to yellow, to white, to clear.

				Hard to say which smell you are referring to without a better description... DMT has a very distinct smell, but hard to describe.<br /><br />As long as you don&#039;t detect any SOLVENT smells, you should be OK.<br /><br />If you want to try washing (though any responsible chemist should have already done this!) you can:<br /><br />Put your DMT on filter paper in a büchner funnel, or just in a coffee filter if you don&#039;t have one. Slowly pour COLD ammonium (about 14mL per gram) over the crystals on the filter paper. Spread the filter paper out flat and allow to dry completely. You now have beautiful white crystal DMT. You will lose a small amount of product when washing, but it should be negligible (&lt; 5-10%) and in my opinion itʼs quality over quantity in this case!<br /><br />This will also remove any possible traces of lye left in the product.

				Tagore:&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure the smell is from a solvent so I&#039;ll go ahead and wash it the way you suggest.&nbsp; It there a recrystalization that I should put it through or does that not matter at this point?

				Sure, you can recrystallize, but it&#039;s not necessary. I&#039;d suggest the wash first, give it a try, and then if you want to recrystallize, do a small amount and compare. Some people actually prefer some of the more yellow crystal to completely pure white/clear. The only difference is the amount of natural plant oils which may be left in slightly yellower product.<br /><br />RECRYSTALLIZATION- Something just for the geeks. After you have collected your crystals from the last step above, you will have nice pile of whitish powdery crystals. If you want the absolute purest possible product, (and something beautifully shiny to look at) you can do a solvent wash and then a recrystallization. Simply dissolve your product in the minimal amount of HOT solvent (usually Naphtha or Hexane) and swirl to dissolve. Slowly add solvent until the product is completely dissolved and no more. Allow this flask to cool very slowly to room temperature for an hour or so. Then move the flask to the fridge for about two hours. Then to the freezer. This way you will grow larger, more defined crystals which are incredibly pure. Pour off the excess solvent and allow crystals to dry. The crystals should now be almost clear as glass and quite well defined.

				DMT should smell EXACTLY like Nike shoes. If there is a hint of anything else, it is likely solvent trapped in the crystal structure. Need to cut it up, spread it out, let it dry until you no longer smell the solvent.

				This is amazing, &quot;WHY DO MY CHEMICALS SMELL LIKE CHEMICALS?&quot; you ever try a toilette wash, it will get rid of any fears or impurities. Simply pour into the bowl and flush, the cleansed product will be in the refill tank. Don&#039;t drink too much!!

				It smells like burning plastic when it is smoked. Go on wash that burning plastic smell out I dare you!!<br />If it still smells like burning plastic after you washed it 100 times maybe just smoke that DMT and its cocktail of chemical smelling goodness.<br /><br />Yellow crystal kicks ASS.<br /><br />edit- I once picked up some DMT at a post office. When I walked in through the main door I could smell it.&nbsp; ;D It had leaked a little ::)<br />I didnt realize but now I think you meant smelling it and not the smell of it burning? It definitely has a smell. DONT PANIC. As long as it doesnt smell more like solvent used in the extraction/cyrstalisation &gt;:(

				Yellow has always been my fav, I think it has something to do with it being re.g DMT rather than 5-MEO. And yes, it will smell somwhere between plastic and mothballs, kinda like a shpongle show.
