				Premise: I will be receiving roughly 100 milligrams of crystalline methamphetamine tomorrow. I will be injecting it (please no harm reduction lectures about this particular method of ingestion here, there are many other posts for that) This will be my first time using (please keep the lectures about the dangers of general use of methamphetamine to a minimum too, I&#039;m aware of the dangers and there are other places for that) I have extensive experience with IV substances, including nearly all subsets of psychoactive drugs.&nbsp; I have a few specific questions.<br /><br />Dosage: I have read and have decided to start small, between 10 and 30 mg&#039;s but I have also heard about people shooting over a point their first time, is this simply and issue of quality or is it the chemical difference between different isomers (is that the correct term) of methamphetamine? What IV dosage do you use and how often do you use so I can get an idea of tolerance?<br /><br />The Rush: I have encountered many experience reports in which the user feels the urge to cough after an injection of methamphetamine and seemingly more experience reports in which the user does not. My gut leads me to believe this is just the difference between l-methamp and d-methamp and their respective abilities to cross the blood brain barrier but I&#039;m not completely sure, it is definitely also be a matter of dosage as well. If anybody could explain this in better detail I&#039;m very interested, as a strong rush is my end goal. <br /><br />Quality: What physical attributes do you find most correlated with methamphetamine quality? Obviously crystalline versus non crystalline is a big factor but I have also read about other qualities being good indicators of quality like moisture, texture, opacity, smell and many more. <br /><br />Any input would be appreciated. I&#039;m doing lots of research to ensure my own safety and the safety of others but answers to these specific questions would help me a lot.

				I just started dabbling, I saw reports of 50 mg first timers but I think 100mg is probably the way to go if you want rush.&nbsp; I did not get cough the few times I did it.&nbsp; From what I understand you want a concentrated shot, so less water than you might be inclined to use.&nbsp; Please report back...

				I have found the meth takes a bit to OD on. I have never OD&#039;ed and without doing it for a long time I did a .2 of Vroom&#039;s and didn&#039;t feel too fucked up or get that &quot;Oh fuck&quot; feeling that I might have done too much.<br /><br />I would say .1 is fine, but if you are scared try a little less and you will still receive a nice rush as long as it is decent quality. 60-80 mg should give you a very worth while rush.<br /><br />

				Please disregard the above posts.<br /><br />When in doubt (especially with IV), start small. If you think 10-30mg is a good start and your source for dosage says so as well, don&#039;t shoot 100mg. You can always buy more, and meth isn&#039;t that expensive.

				go with addy&#039;s advice. whenever it comes to drugs especially with the R.O.A of iv, you should always take less then too much. you cant change taking too much, but you can always change taking too little. good luck on your adventures and above all be safe.
