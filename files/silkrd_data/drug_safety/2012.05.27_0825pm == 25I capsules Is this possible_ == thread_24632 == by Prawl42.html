				Hi guys, looking to buy some 25i Powder&nbsp; and logic says make tabs, however i prefer having capsules because it always gives you the option to snort it. I dont/cant get access to micro gram scales so would it be feasible to cut the powder with a inert substance that is harmless to snort to &quot;pad out&quot; the weight making it safer to weigh? If you think im talking out of my ass and this is a shit idea please let me know, i hate the thought of cut drugs but this would be purely for handling purposes.

				You cant eat 25i. Its not active orally, you either buy some HPBCD or w/e and make tabs or you have to snort it. <br />If you eye ball it (not recommended) snort the size of half a grain of rice and start with that.

				First...yes, you can take 25i-NBOMe orally.&nbsp; It will be 16 times less potent and be metabolized into 2c-i before it actually gets to your brain.&nbsp; So you might as well just buy normal 2c-i at that point. <br /><br />BUY A SCALE.&nbsp; This is absolutely essential.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have the money for a scale, you don&#039;t have the money to be messing with these drugs.&nbsp; End of Story.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care what excuse you have, get a good, accurate, milligram scale.&nbsp; You CAN NOT get by without one. It is absolutely irresponsible to attempt anything without one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do not eyeball a dose.&nbsp; You will have a bad time, and put yourself or someone else&#039;s life at risk.&nbsp; Buy.&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Scale.<br /><br />Also...no, you cannot cut it with an inert binder and then measure that out.&nbsp; The problem with solids is that they do not disperse evenly.&nbsp; Ever played with knex or lego&#039;s as a kid?&nbsp; Notice how the small pieces are always at the bottom?&nbsp; The exact same thing will happen here.&nbsp; The powder will not be evenly mixed no matter how long you mix it for, and some doses will end up inert while others can be 10x as potent.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do this.

				I do have a very good milligram scale but as i stated i dont have a micro gram scale, hence my question. <br /><br />I dont really intend to take it orally, mainly snort it, but thanks for for answer about the mixing of powders, i thought this could have been an issue. <br /><br />WIll just stick to making liquid solution&nbsp;

				Instead of tabs how about teeth whitening 25i nbome strips - kill 2 birds with 1 stone while your sitting around for 45m-1h waiting for it to kick in.
