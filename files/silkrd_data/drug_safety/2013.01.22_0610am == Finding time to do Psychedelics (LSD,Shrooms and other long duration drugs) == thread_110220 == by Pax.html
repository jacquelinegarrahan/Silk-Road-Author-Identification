Then when my little brother comes home I help him with his homework so I have practically no free time. (So to all you busy dads/moms) all of you 9 to 5&nbsp; workers who then get home and work with kids and on the weekend your kids are home soooo...&nbsp; When and Where do you trip? All details are appreciated and helpful. Thank you in advance.

				I don&#039;t have that many obligations other than myself at the moment, so I can trip when I want. That said, I tend to keep them few and far between. When I was younger, still living at home, I would have a few drinks with my parents and wait for them to go to bed. Then I would drop a tab of acid and go out strolling by the sea and through the woods etc during the night. I&#039;d always bring my ipod and a few beers. It was great. I would rock back home at about 7 or 8 am still high as kite and if my parent swere up, i&#039;d just say I got up early and went for a stroll. Then i&#039;d go to bed for myself for the day :)<br /><br />Good times :)

But yeah thanks for the idea keep them flowing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				I used to trip at home occasionally, but after some thought, I realized that tripping at home is kind of a waste, because I spent a good portion of my time being distracted by (or having to deal with) house-related things.&nbsp; Like my family coming home unexpectedly, or an emergency call from work.&nbsp; Even more than that, simply being at home would prompt me to be thinking about common, typical things that are in my thoughts daily.&nbsp; <br /><br />I much prefer to take a trip to take my trips.&nbsp; Being somewhere novel has always given me more bang for my buck with LSD (my psych of choice).&nbsp; New environment, new thoughts, and new ideas are what I enjoy most about LSD, and being somewhere that&#039;s not ordinary is my best way of achieving that.&nbsp; So I usually allocate my trips to times when I am free to take a vacation for a couple days.&nbsp; Like an overnight camping trip in the woods, or a night at a beach resort or casino, or my favorite, a weekend music festival where drugs can be used without worry.<br /><br />So needless to say, when I trip on LSD, I usually spend about $100 on the gas, food, accommodations, etc. that go with a one-night vacation.&nbsp; Sometimes, I take a proper vacation (flight and hotel, more than 1 night) and take my trip there, in which case I spend a lot more on the vacation, but get a lot more out of it.<br /><br />My main point is that for me, tripping in &quot;the usual places&quot; has gotten old, and I never find myself in a situation where I am at home and thinking that dropping LSD is a good idea.&nbsp; I much prefer tripping on vacation, in which case I will have already made the time to take the vacation.&nbsp; Those days of tripping at home are probably over, unless it&#039;s a good mix of people and the right opportunity comes around..

				well, I used to drop/eat shrooms at home but that time has gone. I now lie to my mom about helping a random friend move house and have to spend the weekend there when in reality I book a room at a hotel for the weekend to do whatever I want. This weekend, I&#039;m doing 10 tabs of L at a nice hotel. Maybe you can do the same?

				I&#039;m slammed with 2 jobs, school. I still find time to trip. <br /><br />Half blotter (or whole) of 25c-NBOMe<br />or<br />25mg 2C-B (empty stomach) <br /><br />Wonderful way to make it feel like you had a day off when you actually only had an evening off. <br /><br />Lasts about 5 hrs tops start to finish, and you can still hold a conversation knowing that your words are correct, if you know what I mean.
