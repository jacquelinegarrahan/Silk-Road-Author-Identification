				I will start off by saying, I am an expereinced psychonaut. I have dabbled in many psychedelics including all the classics (besides mescaline) and plenty of the new emerging RC&#039;s. Last night my brother and I decided to go deep with our new batch of 2c b. Because of our experience, we have a rather odd dosing strategy. We almost always seem to start uncomfortably high with doses, and work our way down to a comfortable level. Maybe not such a smart idea, but that is what seems to happen. Before this experience we had only had 2c-b two days prior for the first time. Started with 25mg bombs and slowly redosed about ~5mg at a time intranasally for a few hours. The end result was an amazing experience, but I didn&#039;t feel I had REALLY experienced the drug. Visuals were there, but not as intense as say NBOME. So last night we decided to try again, this time with 50mg bombs. Woah. Couple hours in, I had the ecstatsy from 25I and visuals to compliment. Visual stimulation was almost overwhelming. We decided THAT wasn&#039;t enough and we wanted to kick it up another notch. 10mg up the nose. This ramped up the visuals and body buzz x100. I was never confused, or had any sort of headfuck, like nbome it was just clean psychedelia. We then decide that smoking DMT would be a great idea as we started coming down. I loaded a bowl of enhanced herb I had made and we passed the bong back and forth. Before we started, we were both having some uncomfortable neck tension and a slight headache. After inhaling a few times, everything melted away to bliss. One more hit later, and the world LITERALLY turned into legos. My brother looked EXACTLY like a lego man, including the whole room around us. This was not just what I obeserved, but him also. I began to have some of the most intense revalations in my life. There were no more fractals, or many visual distrotions, but the world was distinctly made of legos. Some of the most impressive visuals I have seen in my carreer including MANY DMT journeys. But this was different, because it was so grounded in reality. We then finish the bowl, and from one second to the next lego-land dissolved. We sit and think (which it is becoming increasingly difficult to, talk, think, or process anything) about how to maximize that combination again. We only have a bit of enhanced herb left, and because of coughing and chest congestion decide not to redose on 2cb. Load the last bowl, and get about half way through it. No more lego, visuals ramp up a bit. Then what happens is what I like to call &quot;poo brain&quot; if anyone has ever mixed a MAOI and MDMA, you might know what I am talking about. I couldn&#039;t think, I couldn&#039;t talk, I would look at my brother and his face would disappear to what looked like a seamless bandana tied around his head. No eyes, nose, mouth. Just freaked me the fuck out in my state of mind, faces are an integral part of human recognition and it had just flew out the window. I start breathing heavily and making weird noises and we both decide we should stop. Suddenly I feel an EXTREME pressure in my bladder. I piss like a racehorse, and my brother ploughs in the bathroom after me. I wanted to take a shower, but he had to go pretty bad too. He seemed WAY too pumped to be taking a piss, like scary so. I walked in after he was done and told him to get out so I could shower, he looks at me with a stone cold face and in a cracked out voice tells me &quot;I have to wash my hands, I have to wash my hands, I have to wash my hands&quot; almost like someone with OCD twitches. He would not leave until he washed his hands in a rhythmic fashion. I was getting worried about underlying neruological conditions this may have unraveled. My bladder hurts, and so does my whole body. I push it aside, and hop in the shower when he is out. I turn it on and begin to wash. Visuals begin to ramp up, and it begins to get hard to breathe because of the steam combinded with the out of breath sensation 2c-b gives me. I cough a few times, and I begin to violently shake inthe shower. I&#039;m slipping about to fall, I can&#039;t think, I don&#039;t know anything, I&#039;m just uncontrolablly shaking. My brother yells, but I can hardly hear because I feel like I am going deaf. I try my hardest to hold on and get out of the shower, which I finally manage to do. I get out, and my hearing is gone completely. I&#039;m still confused and wet, and my brother sounds angry at me for making so much noice. I didn&#039;t know what had happened, so I try my hardest to put my clothes on my soaking wet body and get out. I didn&#039;t tell him what happened, because at that time I just wasn&#039;t sure. I was scared shitless, I didn&#039;t know what had just happened. I sit down on the couch, and tell him to let me sit on it a while before we smoke some more because i wasn&#039;t feeling so hot. He stands up and begins pacing, starts to walk to the bathroom and stands still. He takes off his shirt, and begins to take off his pants and I ask &quot;are you okay dude? why are you stripping?&quot; no answer, he stares down at the floor with a blank face and begins to wobble. I get up and grab him while he starts shaking violently, I push his tongue back inside his mouth. I knew now we had both just had seizures. I pull him to the couch, because he refused to sit down but couldn&#039;t stand or make any sense. After about 5min we are both just sitting on the couch left in wonder. I have never read of any seizure reactions from this combo, and it doesn&#039;t make sense that it would. I&#039;m not sure what kind of answer I am looking to get out of this that I haven&#039;t already thought of, but it makes me feel better to share this story with others.<br /><br />What a fucking night. Today, I am at complete baseline. I feel a little tired, as expected, but fair nonetheless.

				The moral of this story: do not attempt to ingest drugs like Hunter S. Thompson, unless you happen to be Hunter S. Thompson. <br /><br />Seriously, guy, WTF?&nbsp; You took two of the most benevolent and safe psychedelics out there - 2c-b and DMT - and managed to abuse them to the point where you and your brother had seizures. The problem here isn&#039;t with the drugs. The problem is that you&#039;re using them like an idiot.&nbsp; Your dosing strategy isn&#039;t &quot;odd,&quot; it&#039;s fucking stupid. If this is the worst thing that&#039;s ever happened to you so far, you two should count yourselves lucky and avoid doing this shit in the future.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry if I sound cranky, but your whole approach to using psychedelics needs a rethink and a reboot.&nbsp; If you keep this up you are going to do yourself serious, lasting and maybe even fatal damage.

				I research everything I do. You don&#039;t think I looked up the doses I was taking? They were safe in both regards, and I felt AWESOME before I smoked the DMT. My dosing strategy may not be appropriate, but I assure you I am not dumb enough to take life threatening doses. Maybe I push it too far, but THAT is what I get the most out of. I enjoy my bad trips more than &quot;pleasant&quot; ones. We have differing opinions and views in that respect. <br /><br />Calm down.

				You&#039;re an idiot. You say you&#039;re not dumb enough to take life threatening doses, but you had a fucking seizure. If you keep this up you&#039;re going to hurt yourself in the long run. <br /><br />I would never want to take drugs with someone who doesn&#039;t respect them. I bet your research consists of 5 minutes on the Erowid &quot;basics&quot; page for the drug. <br /><br />Just because Erowid says something is safe at certain measurements doesn&#039;t mean it is. Everyone reacts differently to drugs, and you should start off slow, and then ramp up as you progress.<br /><br />Also, 60mg of 2C-B is a shit ton. People have been known to get violent and have freakouts on doses over 40mg.

				What&#039;s funny is that after you felt that the effects of the drugs was getting too much for you (hard to breathe, a bit of shaking, your mind seems to be melting), you thought the best idea after that was to smoke MORE?<br /><br />The combination might not lead to a high risk of seizure... unless you smoke/consume too much of it. Too much of anything will kill you. The combination may be good, but at the dosages you went with what happened was probably expected. During the course of your research, were you certain that the experiences you looked at had the same insane dosages you just had?<br /><br />It&#039;s good that you are still alive. Lay off the stuff so it gets out of your system, and please don&#039;t try it again. If you do, let us know.

				Look - the fact that your vision isn&#039;t decomposing into fractals DOESN&#039;T mean you need more of a chemical. Some drugs (like 2c-b) are NOT inherently visual. You can&#039;t force the experience you want out of a drug by taking more of it. Find a different drug if something isn&#039;t what you&#039;re looking for. <br /><br />DMT and 2c-b are both very safe chemicals on their own. Maybe they are in combination too, but I haven&#039;t seen any research to indicate either way. Have you? Show me some links if you &quot;research everything you do&quot;. <br /><br />And if by &quot;enhanced herb&quot; you mean you smoked changa, or some other MAOI containing substance - well that&#039;s just ridiculous. I&#039;ve read reports of MAOIs potentiating 2c-x compounds 2-3 times over. <br /><br />Even if there was no MAOI, DMT causes a rise in blood pressure which is the last thing you need after ingesting 60mg of 2c-b. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you&#039;re okay, I really am. But I have no sympathy for you. Learn from this experience. But seriously, people like you give a bad name to safe and responsible drug users. YOU&#039;RE the reason that we have such a hard time proving we can use these compounds responsibly. <br /><br />Grow up.<br /><br />Stolea
