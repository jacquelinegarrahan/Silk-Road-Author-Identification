				100mg mdma per capsule ( i&#039;ve never personally loaded capsules, so i don&#039;t know how you got about putting all that together, but i know the dosage is 0.1 of a gram. <br /><br />

				Yeah, i&#039;d say 100-125mg, and buy some gelatin capsules from a health food supply store. The bigger ones will be easier to fill, but I guess whatever size they have will work. To fill them you need to carefully funnel it in, maybe try folding a piece of magazine paper to aim it in. OR you can actually look online (clearnet) to buy a pill/vitamin filling tray. It should give you a place to set the capsule, and just push the powder right into it, then cap it.

				I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;d want to put MDMA in gelatin capsules?<br /><br />Everyone I know just adds it to a small bit of drink and downs it, then maybe swills out the glass with a bit more?

				This makes it easier to travel with than eyeballing a dose from a baggie.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get a .01 scale and some capsule either from a vendor on the clearweb or from a health food store.&nbsp; Personally, I fold a business card in half, put it on my scale, and use a small spoon to dose out 110mg doses before pouring the mdma from the business card into the caps.&nbsp;

				put the cap on the scale, note the weight then get a straw and cut it diagonally so it looks like the tip of a funnel.&nbsp; Then use the pointy end to scoop up the powder from the bag.&nbsp; If you get the right size caps (I think it&#039;s &#039;00&#039;) the straw fits perfectly inside it so you don&#039;t have to worry about spilling any out.&nbsp; If you can, have some one help you by holding the bag while you scoop so you don&#039;t have to hold the cap and bag in your hand at the same time.&nbsp; Just grab and extra straw from a corner store, no need to buy and expensive machine.&nbsp; the paper works alright, but powder sticks to it and it&#039;s easier to spill out

				I use a rolling paper on my scale. Tare the scale. Add 100mg or the dosage you want onto the paper. I use my swiss army knife to get crystals from baggie to scale.<br /><br />Cut out a circle from some reasonably strong paper, then cut out a quarter of the circle, tape it together and cut off the tip. You have yourself a nice little funnel. Experiment with circle sizes till you find the perfect fit.<br /><br />I then poor the the crystals from the rolling paper into the funnel, using a blow gun dart to stuff the powder through the funnel if necessary. I use size 3 caps, they hold 300mg.<br /><br />Can usually fill around 30 caps per hour. Takes a steady hand though, not good if your a twitchy mofo.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/gelcap.sizechart.pdf

				Preparing capsules can be a bitch, as can chopping down a tree with a hammer. <br />The most efficient method depends on how many capsules you need filled and the tools you have at hand.<br /><br />Assuming you have no tools,<br />* If you have a small amount of capsules, it&#039;s no big deal. <br />* If you have something like 100+, there are many ways to go about this. <br />Here&#039;s a low-maintenance idea:<br /><br />1) Weigh out your desired dose per capsule of MDMA (say it&#039;s 100mg)<br />2) Put the MDMA in the open capsule, and put that on the scale, tar it<br />3) Fill the rest of the capsule with something like sugar, and note the weight (say it takes 30mg) it takes for the powder to reach the brim<br />4) Say you have 10,000mg (10g) of MDMA you want to put into capsules. Mix evenly with a proportional amount of sugar (3g) or food-safe item of your choice<br />5) Simply fill each capsule up to the brim with your mixture. This way each capsule will contain around 100mg MDMA and 30mg sugar. This will be much faster than weighing out 100mg 100 times. You can expect a little variation in the dose, but that depends on how evenly you mix it.

				Buy a &quot;The Capsule Machine&quot; and some vitamin C powder (magnesium ascorbate), mix the powders in the desired proportions, fill the capsules 24 at a time. You can fit about 610mg in a 00 capsule.

				If you buy a mg scale (you can get them really cheap) &amp; empty capsules (really cheap too) ~ probably around 20 - 30 dollars total for both of these.<br /><br />you weigh an empty cap on the scales then add powder into a separate capsule and compare the weight on the scales and it&#039;ll tell you how much is in the cap.. if it&#039;s too much you can just tip some out and reweigh it.<br /><br />

				This is my way. I weigh out 140mg then I place one half of the cap on a piece of blutack (sticky rubber that you put posters up with) and then use a funnel to fill it.

				^^^ What Tryptamine said<br /><br />A small capsule machine is ~ $20USD and will improve you quality of life at least tenfold.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I like to snort a mixture of coke/MDMA and throw some vinyl on the HiFi before I get started. Oh, and don&#039;t forget a sipping glass of Papi Van Winkle ;-)
