				I would first like to say I feel blessed to even get the chance to try acid - I consider myself to be one of the &#039;lucky ones&#039; who gt to explore spirituality in a very special way&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />owever, there&#039;s a slight problem. Almost every time the acid feels different. The very best acid I ever had was momiji&#039;s 80mg blots, but to me they felt like 100 (I&#039;&#039;m probably wrong though. I probably got ripped off before, so I expect a weaker potency. And I have a clean WoW 10-strip. That was my first trip (ate the whole dang thing after it didn&#039;t work at first, though I got ripped off... boy was I wrong!) <br /><br />But mostly I get this stuff I just don&#039;t like. I sometimes get a lonely depressed feeling on it, it&#039;s not spirutaul lie the other acid. And it is particularly speedy. This is a huge problem because the bad stuff is more common than the good stuff, and for some reason acid vendors come and go more than, say, weed vendors, I&#039;ve noticed.<br /><br />Should I just stick to shrooms? Always had similar trips on it, but potency is more unpredictable. I once took 2.5 g that felt twice as most shrooms... I think it was golden teacher or penis envy or something, don&#039;t really remember.<br /><br />Anyway. Is there anyone selling CLEAN acid at a good price? Everyone says its all clean, but I feel like the trip is chemically different almost every time I take it?<br />

				I personally gave up on getting real lsd from this site. Got burned too many times, only got the real deal once and never saw the vendor again. I would be extra careful getting it on here, the lucy vendors come and go for good reason, a lot of them are selling fake lsd, from what i understand they are using research chemicals instead, if it ever tastes bitter this is why. Dont mean to step on toes here, but this has been my experience, maybe for now you are better off with the shroomies.

				&quot;real&quot; acid isnt particularly speedy to me. its more stoning from my experience really.... certain phenethylamines are commonly sold as lsd because of their low dosage, and they tend to be quite &quot;speedy&quot;<br />if you go to the lsd avengers thread and do some research before you buy, im sure you will be happy with the result.<br />although fungus is almost always exactly what it appears to be. potency shouldnt bother you any if you are getting more than you payed for? most people think of psilocybin as an experience that one should have alone anyways... social trips can be ugly experiences.<br /><br />just be safe and make sure you have what you want before you take it :D<br />happy tripping

				i feel like i left out an extremely important point.... lsd depends on the set and setting more than any other substance ive taken. ive literally had trips that i was faced on, but as soon as i left my house and changed my environment, the experience would become more paranoid/depressing.<br />partially because i wasnt tripping any more and i knew i was the one who caused that by changing my surroundings.

				Yeah, acid is just different every time. I have tripped a bunch of times on the same supply and no two trips are ever exactly alike. That&#039;s part of what I love about the stuff, though. You never know what you&#039;re going to get, so its hard to get bored with it.

				always remember if its bitter its a spitter.&nbsp; Thats of course if it was represented as lsd.&nbsp; If it has that bitter taste and numbs your tongue a bit its usually an NBOME chemical. Theres also the possibility of DOC and the rest of the DOx family.&nbsp; Some of them are fun chemicals just when you are expecting an acid trip it sucks when you get those. I like some of those chemcials but never buy from people who lie about them and say they are acid. Even though they are fun I don&#039;t want to contribute to scamming.&nbsp; In my opinion passing anything else besides lsd off as acid is a scam and I don&#039;t believe in that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Been some good acid in my area lately though so im not complaining. But the summer was nothing but 25i-NBOME. Was so bad I just started laying my own and giving them out for free to people to try to curb all the nonsense. <br /><br />(edit- Just to clarify I was giving away 25i-nbome tabs and drops of liquid for free since I get that relatively cheap.&nbsp; Was always honest about what the chemical was.&nbsp; I lost alot of sales too because I was honest about it and people wanted &quot;acid.&quot;&nbsp; The sad part was they would tturn around and buy the same thing I was selling from someone who wasn&#039;t honest.&nbsp; I educated people but not everyone listened. :(&nbsp; Had to give them out for free in t hopes I could curb the nonsense.)

Even then you can get all sorts of names for the same quality crystal so the names are pretty much arbitrary and only mean something to you if you are aware of the nicknames in the first place. Percentage is the true indicator despite the popular colloquialisms for them. For example, Rose Crystal, Champagne Crystal and Czech Crystal are all names given to a particular batch of LSD crystal but without percentages the names are meaningless and no indication of purity.<br /><br />Not sure if I got across what I was trying to say but in case I didn&#039;t, I wasn&#039;t trying to be confrontational.

				I honestly don&#039;t think the LSD here is worth it, harsh conditions with the mail can degrade acid a lot, and it&#039;s really expensive. Why would I get 1 hit of LSD when I could get 2 hits of 2CB or some similar psychedelic?
