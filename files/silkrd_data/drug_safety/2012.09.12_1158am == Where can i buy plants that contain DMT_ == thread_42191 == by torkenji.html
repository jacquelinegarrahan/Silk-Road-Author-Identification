				Look for Reed Canary Grass, seeds are easily available, it&#039;s used as ground cover for game birds :)<br />Easy to grow, spreads like crazy, and you can pick it in 3 weeks.

				Ummm...how about off Silk Road. I know, it sounds farfetched that you could buy something like mimosa hostilis from a site like Silk Road. Seriously though, Etizolam has mimosa powder for sale. He can be really slow on his delivery time, but he will deliver. There are also numerous clearnet sites that you could get it from.

				Get mimosa hostilis root bark from vendors here on Silk Road.<br /><br />I know that nawlins and etizolam both sell it, but I&#039;d go with etizolam, even with the horrendous shipping times. He sells literally everything you need to make DMT. Get mimosa hostilis, sodium hydroxide (lye), and vm&amp;p naphtha.<br /><br />Seriously, you do not want to be buying MHRB and lye over the clearnet.

				Not to talk down on BuddhaNature (he&#039;s got the materials correct) but I purchased MHRB online before and so far haven&#039;t seen any repercussions, but then again it&#039;s up to your discretion. If you do plan to go through this you&#039;ll want to look up the STB (straight to base) tek. Lye is also easy enough to obtain, you&#039;ll need as much lye as you do root bark (gram for gram), and noone at the hardware store is gonna complain if you purchase a 2lb container of it. Just don&#039;t repeat the store every other day (you won&#039;t even need to) and make sure what you pick up is 100% LYE! Just be aware, here in the states lye is federally watched, you need to research your own country&#039;s laws before you go about bending them.<br /><br />you&#039;d have better luck browsing the clearnet forums dmt-nexus.me for info on this, but trust me when i say extracting DMT is the easiest thing, not to mention profitable as hell. good luck with your excursions
