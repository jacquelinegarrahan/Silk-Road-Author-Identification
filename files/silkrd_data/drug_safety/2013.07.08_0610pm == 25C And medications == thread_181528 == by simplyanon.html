				Alright, I have a friend who wants to try some 25c with her sister (whenever my order from T5 Gets here) Well, they&#039;re taking a whole shit ton of prescription meds. <br /><br />They&#039;re adults.<br /><br />Person 1 is on: trazadone, effexor, xanax, and abilify.<br /><br />Person 2 is on: lamictal, vibrid, xanax, and seroquel.<br /><br />Yea, I know, red flags popped up everywhere but I didn&#039;t know they were walking pharmacies when I informed them that I&#039;d be happy to toss em a few tabs for always being good friends. Now, they&#039;re excited and I&#039;m apprehensive to let them take anything because I don&#039;t know how the different drugs will interact. (I never take aspirin, let alone anything else, so I always have a cleanish slate to start with...well, usually.)<br /><br /><br />So, silk road peoples, what can you tell me?<br />

				Ok, jesus christ.<br /><br />I would recommend against offering them anything, until they can get off of all of those crazy prescriptions.&nbsp; It sounds like they are definitely not in the right headspace to be playing around with psychedelics. <br /><br />The Xanax would more than likely kill the high alltogether.&nbsp; It looks like the rest are anti-psychotics and anti-depressants.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s highly recommended that anyone mix those with psychedelics.&nbsp; It makes me wonder what is going on in their lives that they feel they need to swallow that nasty cocktail every day.....
