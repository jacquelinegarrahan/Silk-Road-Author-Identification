				Hi<br /><br />I have been taking MDMA for 15 or so years now and have never had a bad experience. I have dabbled with anything i could get my hands on but avoided H for personal reasons. I have taken acid a number of times but the last time i took it i had a really bad experience and lost it hard for 2 or 3 hours. I look back at it now as something which was quite funnt but at the time it was anything but.<br /><br />I had some ketamine since then and i started to feel some of the same feelings and since then have not really touched anything other than pills &amp; coke.<br /><br />I am looking for a psychedelic that gives me killer visuals but doesn&#039;t mess with my head. I don&#039;t want to have to stop doing psychedlics completely as i love the visual and aural hallucinations.<br /><br />Somebody said to me that DMT is a killer trip but your head feels completely normal to think about what you are seeing. Is this accurate?<br /><br />Anyway, i would love to hear peoples opinions.<br /><br />SLS

				I would say that it was accurate for that person however it may definitely be inaccurate for you.<br />Psychedelics are like that.<br /><br />I could say that psychedelics should only be used by those who have mentally prepared for the trip but this is inaccurate as well, because another can take psychedelics without any preparation, anywhere anytime.<br /><br />If you are after full on visuals you get the whole package. Sometimes it would be great just to get the visuals but unfortunately for some, they get the head fuck as well<br /><br />But overall the general consensus is... Prepare your mind and prepare your surroundings. Know you are about to trip and think and see things you may or may not like. Set and setting etc etc.<br /><br />Personally I only enjoy a trip if I am solo. If I really lose touch on things I usually have somebody on speed dial back in reality to touch base with.<br /><br />Have you tried any of the 2c-x??<br /><br />The most favorable experience I have had has been a acid mescaline combo. Beautiful ;) But once again it was the right time and place. <br /><br />edit- Also try lighter doses. It sounds like you are after awesome visuals but imo start off light and work your way up to higher doses. You may not get the visuals you are after but you will become familiar with how you react and think while tripping lightly.<br />

				I would suggest 2C-B and 25C-NBOMe.<br /><br />DMT can be very scary, but it&#039;s short-lived, so you might want to try it, too (vaporisation).

				I would think if you can handle K that you can handle anything,as far as messing with your brain. I honestly dont know how I ever functioned on it without incident. Good luck and a guardian angel I guess.&nbsp; Personally, DXM is a FUN trip with close friends. Those are some of my best memories. Never had mescaline, but heard the visuals can be overwhelming at times,as inanimate objects can appear to move tremendous amounts while moving objects seem to be slow as molasses.<br /><br />There&#039;s just too many substances out there to try, lots of legal ones that are excellent. I havent even delved into R.C.s yet. and may not ever after trying shrooms soon ;)

				Cheers for al your comments. I have tried 2c-b and i found it an excellent buzz when combined with mdma. I ordered some from namaste ages ago and i still haven&#039;t tried it as the time has not come up, but i might give it another go in a few weeks.<br /><br />Salvia and shrooms i used to do a long time ago, (before i had my bad time), but i would be hesitant to do shrooms again. <br /><br />edit- Also try lighter doses. It sounds like you are after awesome visuals but imo start off light and work your way up to higher doses. You may not get the visuals you are after but you will become familiar with how you react and think while tripping lightly. <br /><br />MAybe this is a good idea. So much easier with SR and the quality reviews.<br /><br />Keep the suggestions coming if anybody else has any.<br /><br />Whats mescaline like when mixed with mdma?

				Well I&#039;m not sure how qualified I am to give some advice but my 2 cents would be to try mushroom truffles--I did this while I lived in A&#039;dam (bought from a smartshop) and compared to other mushroom trips I have had this felt more recreational/visual than sheer &#039;psychedelic&#039;...though from the nature of the substance you&#039;re in for one hell of a ride anyways.<br /><br />This is only one trip among a fairly small sample size already...hope that&#039;s something to work with at least

				i too don&#039;t really enjoy mind fucks but like visuals.&nbsp; <br />AMT really produced those effects for me but lasted waaaay too long and some of my friends couldn&#039;t handle it.<br />2 C-B produced the most amazing synthenasia (with music, like watching a digital visualization) with little mental tripping, mostly just positive head space and a feeling vaguely like a weak roll.&nbsp; <br />the 2 C xxs are supposed to be some of the most forgiving.<br />K gives me full control.&nbsp; there is no mind fuck because i am just having a fully conscious lucid dream (medium dose).&nbsp; then i make movies and star in them!&nbsp; K is a great psychedelic for control freaks!!&nbsp; very high doses and I can talk to the Goddess<br />shrooms can be hit or miss depending on external stimulation (stuck in a room vs. being out in nature)<br />but no matter what it really comes down to SET and SETTING!&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br /><br />*destiny*
