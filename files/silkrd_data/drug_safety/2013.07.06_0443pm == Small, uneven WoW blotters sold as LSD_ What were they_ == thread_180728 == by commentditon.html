				Took some small (only a few mm wide) hits of what was sold to me as LSD yesterday, and am now wondering what it really was. As soon as I saw the hits I was very skeptical it was actually LSD, but now that I look back on the trip it definitely wasn&#039;t L. I had a splitting headache for the last half of my trip, I couldn&#039;t sleep for about five or six hours after I stopped tripping, I got no visuals, and it was very underwhelming even on three doses. The trip lasted only about seven hours tops, but I couldn&#039;t sleep til thirteen hours after I dosed, so I&#039;m going to say I was feeling effects of it for thirteen.<br /><br />Does anyone know what this possibly could have been? What substance has a dosage so small it can fit on a piece of blotter only 3-4 mm wide and 5-8 mm tall? Like I said, they were unevenly cut, but the person assured us each hit was the same dose, which makes me believe they were individually laid, since they were given to us pre cut up. Also, there was no taste.

				The drug most commonly passed off as LSD on blotter would be 25i-Nbome but you say you got no visuals even on three tabs so it sounds like ALL you had was body load. Only thing that ever gave me body load and no visuals or anything was morning glory seeds. Never trying that shit again.

				Yeah, it wasn&#039;t an NBOMe, as it had no taste. Perhaps it really was L, and was just a very impure batch? I can&#039;t think of anything else that would fit on a blotter that small.
