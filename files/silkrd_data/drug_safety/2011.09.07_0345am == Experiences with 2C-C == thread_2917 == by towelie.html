				I have been looking into 2C-C as there doesn&#039;t appear to be a 2C-B supplier in the US. And the C seems to be more my speed these days.<br />I have read Shulgins&#039; description where he says @ 24 mg it&#039;s an &quot;intense relaxation&quot; with the closed eye persian rug patterns like 2C-B but not as strong.<br />I am really intrigued by this and would like to hear more experiences before I pull the trigger.&nbsp; <br />I have read Erowid reviews but few of them seem to actually be 2C-C.<br />Thanks!

				In my experience 2C-C is fantastic stuff. Probably the most mild member of the common 2C&#039;s. The visual effects are still quite satisfying though.<br /><br />Start low and be safe.

				Its great for an afternoon trip, its pretty sluggish but with a little taste of nitrous makes the world light up. <br />I&#039;d say start at 30 mg.

				2c-c is amazing. Very good beginner psychedelic and the only one I&#039;ve tried. Requires a higher dose than the other 2c-x&#039;s. I felt nothing at 20mg, felt &quot;something&quot; at 30, and really only started feeling it at 40 but it was still very mild and pleasurable. At 40 I was laughing hysterically during a comedy movie. My Friend was spinning and the DJ software&#039;s waveforms were expanding and contracting a little. I didn&#039;t see anything out of this world. Just tracers and cool color effects.<br /><br />I weight 5&#039;10 170 lbs. I will try 50mg next. <br /><br />Try eating, smelling stuff (flowers, perfumes, etc), and having sex on 2c-c. Your mind will be blown!

				I&#039;m 6&#039; 220 with considerable experience with psychedelics in the past.&nbsp; My last trip was on shrooms I grew back in &#039;02. My last acid trip was prolly 4 years before that. And last experience with E was back in 04.<br />I&#039;m thinking I will start with 25mg and go to a nice arboretum we have in town and take a walk for a couple of hours.&nbsp; If that&#039;s insufficient I will bump it up to 30.<br />All in all I am really looking forward to this.<br />Thanks again.<br />T
