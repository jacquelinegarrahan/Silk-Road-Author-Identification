				Hey guys,<br /><br />Anyone have any tips on coming off opiates for a temporary period? e.g. Pacific island holiday with the missus and I don&#039;t want to take anything with me or will be able to buy anything there, but I will most likely have a physical dependence. <br /><br />I understand Valium is quite good but would love to hear any other ideas.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />sulay

				It really depends on your current tolerance and how long you are going to be away.&nbsp; I would be really skittish about going away for 1-2 weeks without anything at all on hand.<br /><br />Without knowing how much you are taking daily, it is hard to judge.&nbsp; But even if all you are taking daily is some 5-10mg Oxycodone/Aceto pills you could have enough of a tolerance that you could be into heavy WD&#039;s within 4 days.<br /><br />What I normally do is go to the pharmacy and find a vitamin that has a pill that looks close to what I want to take with me, then put the pills in with the regular vitamins and pack them in my luggage.&nbsp; Never had a problem.<br /><br />You do not want to be going through the WD&#039;s on vacation, believe me.&nbsp; I did it once, never again.&nbsp; I barely made it home, I was throwing up on the plane back.

				Ayahuasca is what a lot of people use to &quot;come down&quot;.&nbsp; It supposedly gives your brain chemistry a &quot;reset&quot;.&nbsp; So the effects aren&#039;t near as pronounced.&nbsp; Never tried it myself though.

				Valium, Xanax, Imodium. These are what you need. I like to have plenty of hash on hand as well. You should have no problem finding some herb on the islands.

				Sometimes there is an add on SR in the prescription section for Dextropropoxyphene which is basically a synthetic opiate.&nbsp; This drug is used extensively in many countries to bring hard core opiate users down without the physical withdrawl and cramping.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately I am in a country with anal drug laws&nbsp; and they wont write scripts for it anymore or at least thats what im told.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you cant get ahold of it my advice would be taper but do it seriously in a pre planned way.&nbsp; Set out your dosages for several weeks&nbsp; and you should be able to make it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have known people that did it successfully cold turkey but that is only because they were locked up.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Sounds awful but its true.&nbsp; :)<br />

				I didn&#039;t see anyone mention kratom.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Kratom has worked great for everyone I know, plus its legal and cheap.&nbsp; Google &quot;kratom&quot; for info and websites that sell it.&nbsp; Take about 5-10grams of the cheapest kratom leaf you can find, and your withdrawals will be gone for 5-6 hours at least.

				I don&#039;t have much experience with Kratom but like mentioned above it seems to be something that could help with alleviating withdrawal symptoms over a short period.<br /><br />The strains do have different effects; the ones I tried made me feel extremely wired.&nbsp; It seems like it would be best to go for one of the more sedating strains

				This is a little obscure but Lyrica(Pregabalin) is fantastic for opiate WDs. It&#039;s a neuropathic pain medication that is known for killing cravings to most drugs, from coke to nicotine to opiates. They&#039;re what I used to break my oxy addiction, one pill in the morning stops craving and withdrawal pain for 4-6 hours. They can also get you pretty high too, feels like a combination of marijuana and alcohol. You should look it up on Bluelight, if you&#039;re interested I still have a couple hundred and could put up a listing for you.

I was addicted due to some medical issues. When I was kicking it I went to the doc and she gave me xanax. Then I came across a link about Lyrica. I had some from a previous prescription and tried it. 300mg knocked the shit out of the withdrawals. So I went back to the doc and got some more. I still have PAWS 2 months later but only at night when I want to sleep. I take a 200mg pill and some doxylamine succinate and I&#039;m out. Good luck!

				I concur with the people that advise benzos (xanax/valium)and immodium. Cant speak for other methods.If you can, use this opportunity to kick, the dependency only gets worse and the destruction won&#039;t be far behind. Good luck.

				No one has mentioned methadone or suboxone. I also didnt read whether or not his wife knows... Valium, Xanax, Pregablin/Gaba and Immodium all just take away symptoms and do absolutely nothing to shut off the opiate cravings going nuts in your body after using opiates for some time. Kratom was the best suggestion in that respect, but kratom alone wont do it. If you&#039;ve only done it for 1-3 days, fine, get some valium, or better yet, klonopin, and immodium for your stomach pains and youll make it through day 1-2 and feel ok by 3. Slap on the kratom and you&#039;ll be much better, but theres no way youll be able to transport that shit over with you, especially after what that guy wrote about being double checked with dogs on the pacific islands... fuck that! If your 7+ days deep on the opiate binge and need to be social, get 10mg of methadone for day 1, 5mg for day 2. For suboxone, get .25mg for day 1 and .125mg for day two. you shouldnt need any more for day 3 other than a valium or xanax for sleep each night and immodium all the way through. The obvious addition to all of this is to stay as fucking stoned as you possibly can with some hash, but dont get some sativa island bull shit or else your gonna feel like you need a nice rip of h or some oxy. also, dont drink.

				Can&#039;t comment on during the day, except for some weak opie like tramadol or a single vike, but benzos are the way to go IMHO for getting sleep while going through withdrawal.

				In the &quot;kick packs&quot; I would get from the local clinic a few years ago, they would give me clonidine patches, loperimide, and atropine/ phenobarbital (chills, shits, and stomach cramps, in that order). If you said you drank a lot they would give you librium too, which was nice to take some of the edge off. I would supplement this with a couple subutex; break into quarters and snort approx 2mg every couple hours. Snorting worked faster for me, and let me stretch out each pill. When I had to do a bit of jail time on a stupid charge, I hid 10 of the subutex in my ass, and it saved me those first couple weeks. You still feel sorta drained depending on your habit, but you aren&#039;t a mess and can sleep at least. Plus, for my fellow cellmates without a high tolerance, tiny lines would get them high. It was as good as that situation could have been.<br /><br />Not sure if suboxone would work the same way; I greatly preferred subutex, since the idea of taking naltrexone didn&#039;t appeal to me. Good luck!
