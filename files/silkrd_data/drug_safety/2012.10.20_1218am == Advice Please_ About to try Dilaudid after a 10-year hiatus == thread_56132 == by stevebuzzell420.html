				I used to mainline BTH 10 years ago, but I haven&#039;t had any drugs since then.<br /><br />I am getting some Dillies. How should I use them? And how much? Can I plug them, or must I slam them to get off?<br /><br />What about Benadryl? Someone said I should take Benadryl before. Anyone have any experience with that? How much Benadryl and when?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />SB420

				From my little experience, low tolerance and pretty lightweight, I&#039;ve found snorting about 8mg is good enough for me, maybe 12mg if I really want to push it. However I&#039;ve done some research and everyone says that snorting and especially eating are not very productive when it comes to dillies. Plugging is apparently a good method though, if you don&#039;t mind it it&#039;s probably your best option although I wouldn&#039;t do it myself. I have also read that IV&#039;ing Dilaudid is better than heroin to some users. Probably not true for most people, but it&#039;s nice to hear. Whatever you do don&#039;t eat them, it&#039;s the worst by far, and I&#039;ve heard of cases where people eat 8mg and don&#039;t feel hardly anything at all.<br /><br />I think the bioavailability is supposed to be 100% if IV or plugged, something like 50% snorted, and something like 30% eaten. So definitely IV/plug if you want the most out of it. Hopefully other people can give more specific advice about the dosage.
