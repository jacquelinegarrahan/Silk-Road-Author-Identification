				I was just talking about these guys in the festival thread. The owner is a great guy, exchanged some emails in the past. They usually offer free testing at a booth at festivals and also walk around selling single use test kits and what not.

				I emailed them telling em i was going to a few festivals and that i go to a lot of shows locally and what i could do to help out but they never responded.<br />I&#039;ll probably just end up sending another one, I&#039;ve been wondering if it would be possible to do something like that at a festival and then in the Festivals! thread Mollysbf mentioned how they have booths where they test peoples stuff!<br /><br />I would love to help out in something like that, it really dissapoints me how much bogus &#039;molly&#039; goes around,

				The owner is a college kid who was pretty much working with 100% volunteers and spending a lot of his own money. He sounded like he might not be doing it forever unless some kind of sponsor stepped up.

				Here&#039;s an insightful post Bunk Police made on the /r/Drugs subreddit about the quality of MDMA at festivals:<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/izdfi/i_have_shocking_information_for_you_to_consider/<br /><br />They also did an AMA (a question and answer session) but it didn&#039;t receive a lot of attention:<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/k81il/iama_chemist_with_the_bunk_police_a_drug/<br /><br />Looks like they&#039;re/he&#039;s doing a lot of good work.

				I am also pretty peaceful and so are MOST of my friends. That&#039;s the first reason I probably won&#039;t do it. The second reason is because I saw so many people last year that genuinely believed they had the good stuff and got totally shut down when they saw the test results. I guess I could still do it if the test showed that the drug was completely bunk, I just don&#039;t wanna tag some guy for selling 25i-nbome rather than cid or methylone instead of molly. I know a lot of dealers do this on purpose but I know a lot of people that sell this stuff IRL thinking its the real shit until I prove them wrong.

				^ I think most of those guys DO know exactly what they are selling.&nbsp; Methylone can be purchased online from RC vendors for even cheaper than on SR...I have to assume most people selling M1 as molly know exactly what they are doing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wanna make sure my whole crew of 20+ ragers and anyone else I can help out are all getting legit stuff.&nbsp; Next time someone walks by our camp site saying &quot;doses, molly&quot; I&#039;m gonna ask if they are willing to let me test it in front of them...I assume most of them would just keep on walking...bahahaha fuck those scumbags at the least I will be shouting out to my neighbors not to buy their bunk shit maybe some sort of chant in unison that the dude is a straight phoney.&nbsp; If we can inform enough people maybe we can drive those pieces of shit out of our festivals and clean up the scene. Aw...wouldn&#039;t that be nice&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace and Love.&nbsp; :D
