				Basically, I&#039;ve noticed lately that even a single dose of heroin leaves me with somewhat of a &#039;hangover&#039; afterward. However, pharmaceutical opiates never do.<br /><br />Have any of you noticed this?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if its caused by the actual diamorphine, and pharms just don&#039;t have the same effect, or if its the impurities and contaminants in the heroin that cause it. I do notice that the high from pharms is much... &#039;cleaner&#039; feeling. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done a wide variety of pharms, and have never noticed much of an unpleasant feeling afterwards. You would think that if it were caused by the heroin and not the impurities, you would also feel a hangover from MSContin, considering once they enter your brain, their basically the same thing. Never noticed anything though.<br /><br />Anyone else get hung over from heroin? or pharms, for that matter?<br /><br />Concerning opiates, I typically buy in small amounts and go on short, 3-4 day long binges, then force myself to quit before my tolerance gets too high and I have to suffer through wd&#039;s. Because of this, I&#039;m fairly in tune to the after-effects of opiates.

				All of these posts on the forums regarding heroin just make it sound terrible. Hangovers, addiction, overdosing, tolerance, etc. I&#039;d rather stick with soft drugs than touch heroin or cocaine. <br /><br />I like my LSD and MDMA.

				asdf, it could be the batch you used was particularly impure or was cut with something you didn&#039;t react well to. I personally very rarely have a &quot;hangover&quot; from heroin, other than being a bit tired the next morning and needing an extra cup of coffee to really wake up. But even the worst I&#039;ve ever felt the morning after using heroin doesn&#039;t come anywhere close to hangovers I routinely get from alcohol, cocaine, or even benzos. <br /><br />Digit, sure there are some drawbacks to using heroin, but even &quot;soft drugs&quot; (particularly alcohol) can also cause all of the negative effects you listed above. Sure LSD and MDMA are pretty safe and if those are your cup of tea then more power to you, but heroin&#039;s not the only drug that can be harmful. I personally feel that its status as the &quot;most feared drug on the planet&quot; is not really fair. Look at countries like Switzerland, which provides heroin and supervised injection facilities to addicts. It&#039;s been shown that these people live productive lives, are able to hold down jobs, etc. Using the drug in a &quot;responsible&quot; manner like this, even if you are physically addicted, is much less harmful to the human body than alcohol use in those physically addicted to that substance. Heroin is harmful and &quot;feared&quot; because it&#039;s illegal, which leads to no regulation/product standards, unsafe usage conditions, and a lack of education on responsible use. If we had those things and legalized its use, it wouldn&#039;t be the scourge of the world that it&#039;s considered to be right now.<br /><br />Sorry for the OT rant...I just get worked up when I&#039;m reminded that heroin (my drug of choice) causes so much more harm in this world than is necessary. It doesn&#039;t have to be a scourge, our governments have just chosen to vilify it - thus leading to the current situation.
