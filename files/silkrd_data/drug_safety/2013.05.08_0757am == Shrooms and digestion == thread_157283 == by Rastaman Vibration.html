				Hey Silk Roaders,<br /><br />Do any of you experience digestive problems after ingesting psylocybin? And if you do, have you found anything that eliminates it?<br /><br />Personally, whenever I ingest mushrooms in any variety (straight, in chocolate or tea form) I get violently ill. As in vomiting and diarrhea. No fun while you&#039;re trying to trip, as you can imagine. I&#039;ve tried smaller dosages and that hasnt helped either. It just seems like mushrooms just don&#039;t agree with me, no matter what.<br /><br />Has anyone found anything that soothes the digestion and keeps you off the toilet?<br /><br />Any suggestions would be appreciated.

				Making a shroom tea (or coffee in my case as it tastes horrible) rather than eating the shrooms avoids the gastro problems in my experience.

				eating some ginger or drinking a ginger ale with the mushies might help, also make sure you chew them up very well or even put them in a coffee grinder and turn them to dust before eating. that will make it easier to digest in your stomach. you could also try grinding them up and then soaking them in lemon or lime juice for 15 minutes to turn the psilocybin into psilocin (which is what your body does) before you ingest, that could help with any digestive problems because the mushies go straight into the blood and dont have to be broken down. just google the lemon tek for more info

Feels like I&#039;m puking the whole world out. <br /><br />Thanks for the suggestions. I&#039;ve actually tried making tea and it did not help with the digestive disturbances. I&#039;ve ingested the mushrooms ground up in a chocolate and that didn&#039;t do the trick either. Might give the lemon soak a try

				The worst I ever got was a bout of gas that mad my eyes water and made the dog run. <br /><br />But it was a beautiful cloud of the most vibrant green you had even seen.&nbsp; :o

				So far I have only gotten sick the first time I tried shrooms. I took an eighth and had an amazing trip. At about 4.5~5 hours in I threw up.<br /><br />All I remember were little voices in my head, reminiscent of the munchkins from the wizard of oz, yelling:<br /><br />&quot;IT&#039;S TOO MUCH! HE&#039;S GONNA BLOW!&quot;<br /><br />And then the entire contents of my stomach projected up my throat, out of my mouth, and all over the blankets and snuggie I was wrapped in.<br /><br />I felt like I had just ingested poison and was going to die for about 15 minutes and once I realized I was ok and was just tripping on shrooms I was completely fine and relaxed for the last about 30~45 minutes of the trip. Still was the most amazing and longest shroom trip I&#039;ve had.
