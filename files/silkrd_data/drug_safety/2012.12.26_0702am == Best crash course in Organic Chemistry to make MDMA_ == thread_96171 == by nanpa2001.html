				Is there any book/instructional videos/online courses that I can take to learn organic chemistry, and from there how to make MDMA?<br /><br />Since there are a few users here that are actually able to make MDMA, is there any advice you can give me?

				Never made it, always interested in learning a bit more myself. Looking into it rather extensively, it&#039;s not really a weekend hobby. You would want to be able to get around basic chemistry and honestly your best bet is probably going to be to just pickup a few books on Amazon that will include some legal experiments you can do as well as the gear you&#039;ll want to start picking up. Understanding reactions and the processes involved are key and very few are specific to MDMA synthesis. If you want to play home chemist there is tons of legal stuff you can do to get the process down before you even think about jumping through the big hurdle...<br /><br />Getting sassafras oil or the safrole you will need to distill from it is not easy in the US of A. Some vendors on SR might have it. You might be able to find a source. There are other hard to get items but this seems to be the hardest. It comes out of one closely watched species of trees in southeast Asia.<br /><br />Assuming you got the essentials down and found some chem sources, the syth process can be found online in a few places. I liked this one personally, fun to read:<br /><br />(clearnet) http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/mdma.drdrool.html<br /><br />The guides on SR might be able to help with some of the specifics. Lots of people aren&#039;t real keen to share how they get the best yields and avoid mistakes so the clearnet stuff needs to be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />If I thought I could convince my girlfriend that setting up a full lab in the basement was a really great idea I would likely be trying this myself. It&#039;s not hard, their aren&#039;t many dangerous reactions involved (i.e. soda bottle meth can melt your face off, MDMA syth will probably just cost you a bunch of money in the learning process).<br /><br />Hope this helps a little. I think just picking up the chem would be fun even without the making drugs part. I always wonder if I had to rebuild society from scratch would I really have the technical know how to make my own glow sticks?

There are many books available on SR which have the ingredients required (in detail) and the instructions/equipment required to produce all types of drugs, ranging from crystal meth to MDMA (where 2 methods are detailed), plus numerous others. The instructions are very detailed and cover everything you need to know. Of course you will require some knowledge of Chemistry!!!<br />

I was basically saying the same thing you were :-&gt; There are syth guides out on clearnet but the folks who write them have no vested interest in me getting it right and might actually be better off if I fail completely. That&#039;s why I was saying the clearnet stuff needs to be taken with a grain of salt. If I drop someone a load of cash on SR they are likely to want me to get what I pay for so others will do the same.<br /><br />Long Live the Road!

				<br />The most interesting mdma synth is using black pepper as a source precursor..<br />But we need some practical experience down this road..

				Im going to try brightstars syth as well. Iny new things like harder to get chemicals and any cheap places to get the materials would be good advise.

				(CLEARNET) https://www.khanacademy.org/ has a good amount of basic chemistry and even has a separate ochem section. In addition the learning is progressive, ie you can start at as basic a level as you need and build your knowledge at your own pace. I&#039;m not sure about the chemistry section but several of the sections have quizzes and problems you can complete to test yourself as well.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how accurate the information is, but the site has been getting a lot of praise from a lot of people, so I imagine it must be worth something.

				I&#039;ve sold organic chemistry textbooks over SR before. Perhaps I can stock some more :) There seems to be interest.
