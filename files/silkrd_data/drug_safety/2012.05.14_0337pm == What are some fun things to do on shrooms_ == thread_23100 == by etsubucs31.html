				I am about to try shrooms for the 2nd time. The first time I tried them I had a horrible trip due to not knowing anything about correct dosage or setting. I swore I would never do them again, but after reading up a lot I think I am ready to give them another try. I am going to do them with a close friend this time, and not be around anybody else that is not on them (I think this was part of what freaked me out the first time). Anyways, what are some fun things to do on shrooms so I can keep my mind clear and have a better trip this time around.

				Go outside.&nbsp; Preferably in nature encumbered by trees, bushes, creeks.&nbsp; Look at the life all around you.&nbsp; You cannot imagine how awesome it feels to wade through a creek and see all of the organisms underneath you.&nbsp; Tripping in nature is the only way to go if you&#039;re doing shrooms.&nbsp; ;)

				Stay away from clouds and public places. Nothing stirs up fear and paranoia like feeling everyone around you knows you&#039;re tripping and judging you. <br /><br />Trip with people you know and have someone there tripping and someone there not. Its great to have someone who can relate to the you who is tripping and better to have someone who can relate to you wanting to be back in the real world.<br /><br />From the beginning make sure you&#039;re going through no hard times emotionally. Ie death of a family member, loss of job, seperation of a loved one. Any and all thoughts may be put in front of you to deal with the second you&#039;re not so distracted by the trippynesss<br /><br /><br /><br />Bring shit to avoid distraction. Toys the tripping shroomer loves toys. Try kaleidoscopes, foil gift wrapping paper, playdough, anything weirdly textured or wildly colorful will do the trick.<br /><br />Hide anything sharp or any weapons.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to accidentally play with anything.<br /><br />Always remember its just a drug and drugs subside, enjoy it while you can because no matter how wild it gets you&#039;ll miss it when it goes. <br /><br />Please be safe and have a happy trip.<br />Good vibes.

				Bring the person you love with you (as a sober person) <br />Go outside and play, what the sky, look at the plants, play with a ball, run around.<br />If it&#039;s raining, go play in the rain, it will feel amazing. <br />Kaleidoscopes are excellent also. <br /><br />If you ever feel like you&#039;re heading for a bad trip, change the setting, maybe turn on some light, turn on some music. <br />If you can&#039;t shake the thought away, go do something or talk to someone, keep yourself distracted.<br /><br />and always remember: It&#039;s all in your head, and you took the mushrooms to feel good and enjoy the feeling. <br /><br />Once I spent a whole hour playing with a rubik&#039;s cube, laughing my ass off because all the color where changing and I could never figure it out.

				I enjoy focusing on things to &#039;twist&#039; them into different fractals and eventually they usually turn into something interesting (Saturday&#039;s most interesting one was a weird looking cat, like the cat from Alice in Wonderland except it wasn&#039;t at all creepy and didn&#039;t have a huge smile, but had the big eyes).<br /><br />The last 2 trips I&#039;ve been doing this by just laying on the couch (with music) focusing on different HD wallpapers. Some take less effort to &#039;twist&#039; than others. I prefer beach scenes because without trying at all the clouds are always moving and the trees are always gently blowing in the wind, very tranquil but controllable.<br /><br />My main problem with taking shrooms in the woods is if I take 5g+ I WILL have to take a shit at some point, which I would prefer to do in my own home.

Dont want to give it away, but I know where you are from (or at least where you likely went to college) :p<br /><br /><br />Anyway, Go the the forrest and day trip. This time of year when everything is SO green, the side of a hill is beautiful. Get caught up in the Macro instead of the micro. Dont get under a tree and look at it, get on a hill side and look at a neighboring hill side. They look beautiful.

				The mushroom&nbsp; has conviced me that emulation is key. You must become a mushroom. Must be in a dark and quiet place...you must be alone and very close to the ground.&nbsp; Close your eyes and see that everything you see and hear are of the mushroom and not from outthere

				Me and my mates like to listen to calm music, with some of it being DnB and hiphop, but mostly just calm trippy music which i really don&#039;t know the genre of. Listen to that, and watch a documentary consisting of just short video shots of mountains and nature, not some guy running around explaining what is what etc. Good example was Wild China, we muted it and listened to music. Although even without being muted it is good because the program is focused on nature.<br />We also accidentally stumbled upon a paralympics channel, which as immature as it sounds, couldn&#039;t stop our-self from bursting out with laughter, i know how harsh this sounds, we soon after changed it as this wasn&#039;t a great thing to watch. <br />Another thing, is try to roll a spliff while tripping, if you eat alot of shrooms, it is almost impossible to roll up a spliff, the most confusing shit to do.<br />Play FIFA, or watch someone sober play games, such as skyrim while listening to music. <br />If you are tripping in a room, hang out trippy stuff on walls, we always do it, the place you trip in has an incredible effect on your trip. We hanged out blankets and scarfes with patterns on them around. It would be good to have a picture in a frame, my mate had a very nice one of a tree with eyes around the branches and everything, it was amazing.<br />We always planned to actually start drawing and see where our imagination can take us but we never got to do it, there is a million of things we always plan to do but end up doing 2-3 of them, because things get so trippy...

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shrooms are absolutely divine: I have done them maybe 30 times and never had a bad trip. Try and take them with an empty stomach.If you have some Syrian Rue I recommend taking a few grams: it will intensify your trip.Being outdoors on a sunny day in a park with few people is an ideal setting.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally tho..these last few years..I prefer to avoid ppl altogether so I stay inside.I recommend listening to some Jimi Hendrix real loud,smoke a few blunts, and have a real pretty open-minded lady nearby (just in case).<br /><br />Have fun dude. Be safe. Peace.<br /><br />&quot;Drug misuse is not a disease it&#039;s a decision: like the decision to step in front of a moving car.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Phillip K.Dick

				Go find some state land and go CAMPING!&nbsp; Nothing like being in the middle of nowhere with no cell service with a couple of like minded friends.&nbsp; Bring lots of shrooms and booze!&nbsp; You&#039;ll also need a tent some folding chairs maybe an air mattress sleeping bags, you know...the works.&nbsp; Start a fire in the late afternoon make yourself some food over the fire, eat dinner, then wait about a half hour for the food to digest.&nbsp; Then its time to drop your shrooms and let the games begin :D<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Stunt Bum
