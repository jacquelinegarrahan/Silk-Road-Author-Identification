				Mate... what the fuck?&nbsp; Street level mdma is MUCH too dirty for that.&nbsp; That&#039;s what your liver and nose are there for.&nbsp; Filters.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t do that unless it came from a Swiss laboratory.<br />Not to mention you have no clue what&#039;s in a pill.<br /><br />If you absolutely need someone to tell you though, there is no reason that it wouldn&#039;t work with crystals if it worked with a pill.&nbsp; Admitting that those pills were really mdma.<br />In any case, yes mdma dissolves in water.&nbsp; It&#039;s a salt after all.<br /><br />Most mdma is HCL, anything HCL dissolves in water.<br /><br />If you REALLY want to do this, you could have easily informed yourself on google.&nbsp; Check Bluelight - IV mdma.&nbsp; &nbsp;

There&#039;s also people that heat pills that gel up like MSContin or OPs to be able to draw it and then inject it :o The risk of getting embolisms must be pretty high. Wheel filters aren&#039;t so readily available and not everybody wants to spend an extra $2 a shot especially when they have a strong habit...

A study was done in Australia I think around 2003 so its not new seems to be in ceratain cohorts of groups<br /><br /><br />The problem is that people think that Methadone is&nbsp; a sterile fluid but it is not a sterile&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m thinking about making 3Jane&#039;s MDA into an injectable solution.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably use it by IM (intramuscular) injection initially.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like to hit the beautiful veins in my arms at this point since I&#039;m a novice with IV so I IV in my leg but most of the time I don&#039;t get a hit.&nbsp; Of course if I got off my drug-using ass and spent more time at the gym then maybe I&#039;d have veins popping out of my legs again.<br /><br />I might start putting more drugs into solution (water) because it is easier to measure doses (I have my cheap mg scales).&nbsp; If I filter properly I should have the option of IV, IM, oral (unless it isn&#039;t orally active) and rectal.&nbsp; Possibly for insufflation as well (like if I bother trying NBOMes again...I hate sub-lingual NBOMes because they are so bitter).<br /><br />I would love to IV LSD but it looks like I don&#039;t have any LSD crystal here.

Well to tell you the truth I was eyballing pure 2C-B powder - have half a gram of it. I took a pill with a good strong dose (Don&#039;t remember how much it was, probably 30mg) but I know that pure 5 mg 2C-B is the same. After you end up pushing plunger down you already tripping tripping, actually I start tripping halfway through. Effect of 5 mg are the same as oral, just I don&#039;t like the body thing that goes with 2C-B don&#039;t even know how to call it.
