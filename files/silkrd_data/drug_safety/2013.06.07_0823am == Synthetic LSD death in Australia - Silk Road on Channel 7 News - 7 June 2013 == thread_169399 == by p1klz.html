				Ok I don&#039;t know how many other threads have been started on this topic but the current front page news here at the moment is a story of &quot;synthetic LSD&quot; attributed death. 17 year old youth, Henry Kwan apparently obtained &quot;what he thought was LSD but was in fact a synthetic drug - obtained from another teen&quot;. Apparently this other teenager obtained 25i-NBOME blotters &quot;from the internet&quot; and then on-sold them as LSD blotters. However on the Channel 7 news report they had screen shots of the SR&#039;s main home page. Unfortunately this is another &quot;Man on LSD thinks he can fly and leaps to his death&quot; story. Without being disrespectful of the dead I immediately thought of Bill Hicks&#039; LSD routine straight away.<br /><br />Today&#039;s Daily Telegraph newspaper also has side column titled &quot;Teens get drugs by mail order on internet&quot;. Shit I started browsing SR after reading about it in a Daily Telegraph article about 6 months ago!! This article doesn&#039;t really go into any specific details nor does it mention SR (or any other black markets) directly. However it does state and I quote &quot;The most frightening thing was hw easy ir was for teenagers&nbsp; to get their hand on drugs. They can look it up on the net. They know the &#039;dark&#039; sites to visit then get it mailed to whichever address&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s this sorta bad publicity we all can really do without!! A little bit perturbing don&#039;t you think??&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
