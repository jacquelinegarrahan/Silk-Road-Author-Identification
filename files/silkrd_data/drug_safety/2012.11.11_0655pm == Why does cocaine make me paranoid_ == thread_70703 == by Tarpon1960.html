				I live in South Florida, where the blow is generally pretty good. And yes, sometimes I do too much. Inevitably, when i over serve myself, i get seriously paranoid. We&#039;re talking serious fear - like, the cops are about to rappel down the side of my building and kick in my windows. Or, my mother is about to visit me at 4:30 in the morning. Sometimes I get so freaked out I have to unplug the refrigerator because every time it comes on, the noise scares the crap out of me. Sometimes I lie on the floor and peer out under my front door looking for the shadows of the SWAT team that&#039;s preparing to bust in and arrest me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried googling &#039;why does cocaine make me paranoid&#039; but could find no answers. What exactly does blow do to my brain which causes these very real, very frightening paranoid delusions?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s called stimulant psychosis. Delusions and paranoia are good first warning signs. At least you don&#039;t feel like there are bugs crawling under your skin or that your kidneys are failing! (That happened to me from binging on MDPV.)<br /><br />You need to cut down your use. Take two weeks off, then you can go back to using, but try to limit the amount you&#039;ll do in a night, and in a week.

				Wow, that is some super serious paranoia.&nbsp; You need to cut way back, your body/mind is telling you that.&nbsp; I have very little coke experience but when I do it I use it as a pick me up while I am drinking so I don&#039;t get tired before I want to.&nbsp; Are you otherwise sober just blowing lines in your south florida apartment?&nbsp; A few flags being raised if that is the case..

				Cause &quot;cocaines a hell of a druug!&quot; (rick james voice). lol buet seriously, its because your use is way beyond an average &#039;user&#039;..what sucks is once your at that place, it will be nearly impossible for you to do any amount of blow and not eventualy be right back in that place. shit i was there one before, for a brief time..i havnt done the shit in years, for that same reason. I always had a pistol in my hand , constantly checking the windows and shit, no matter where the hell i was. again cocaines a hell of a drug. good luck to you my friend.

				It is because of these reasons that cocaine is an illegal narcotic, and should remain so. I stand by the law and will continue to enforce the law upon anyone who decides to tamper with cocaine. It will destroy your life.<br /><br />Suck my dick. Faggots

				First off - thank you. Thank you for your sincere worry on my behalf, and your sage advice to lay off the blow. Hearing worry and concern from the folks on this forum really made me sit up and take notice, far more so than hearing it from a doctor, priest or friend. If Hunter S. Thompson told me to be careful, I&#039;d listen - much the same as I am listening to you folks now. So thank you again.&nbsp; <br />That said, I am a drug addict and not a particularly bright human being, so there is a very real chance - try as I might - i will make the mistake of scoring an eight-ball and letting her rip again in the future. Generally in conjunction with inviting some beautiful latin hooker over to my place for a night of carnal excess. Hookers and blow are the milk and oreos of South Florida. But hopefully the fear of bugs crawling under my skin &amp; delusions of kidney failure&nbsp; will at least make me think twice before I go too far. And if I do go too far, hopefully a small part of my drug-addled reptilian brain will be able to manage my paranoia slightly more effectively now that I know the SWAT team at my door is actually in my head.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now if only that suspicious black helicopter would stop following me around I&#039;d feel even better. <br />Gotta go. I think there&#039;s someone at the door, and I am pretty sure it&#039;s John Ashcroft. <br /><br />Stay safe all. And thanks again.

				I know the feeling, OP. I went loony after staying up for days at a time this summer and binging on Adderall, Dexedrine, MDPV, Mephedrone, and Pentedrone... I know I&#039;ll be going back to stims soon. But you can learn from the advice here and learn from my mistakes and vow to keep some rules with your use... don&#039;t stay up more than 48 hours, ever. With heavy stims, day three is the day psychosis settles in, not day four.
