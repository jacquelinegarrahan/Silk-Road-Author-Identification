				Hey!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been craving acid for a while, but haven&#039;t had the means to purchase more. However, by some miraculous turn of events, 3x150Âµg of acid I ordered four months ago came in the mail today.<br /><br />This is the first time I&#039;m in possession of acid while also being in possession of MDMA; I still have 6 100mg capsules leftover from when I purchased a gram.<br /><br />Is the candyflip experience truly worth it? Since I have such little acid, I was considering just taking all three by themselves to hopefully achieve some deeply introspective ego-death-esque trip; But since I have the molly, I feel that perhaps I should take 1-2 of the acid candies with 1-2 molly capsules to see what it&#039;s like.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

				With a proper candyflip you take the MDMA right after the LSD peak, thi way you are not overpowered and they meld well together. You get your acid comeup and peak, and THEN you get the candyflip. DO it

				Throw some ketamine in there and you have one of my favorite combinations.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh yeah, for dosing, 2 of each should be more than enough for your first candyflip. MDMA and LSD potentiate/synergize so you don&#039;t need as much if you were only doing one by itself. Have fun!

				<br />ugh. i hate come ups.probably not a good idea to stack them.&nbsp; peaking on acid first is probably the best idea. <br />but an E come up on an acidtrip ..weeell....<br /><br />when I flipped&nbsp; last time I did it the other way around. molly first then acid and then molly again. <br /><br />its fun both ways!!

				i remember someone mentioned a good candy flip should have the mdma and lsd ending around the same time. so if your lsd trip is 6 hours and your mdma roll is 4 hours with a 1 hour up, dose about 1 hour into your lsd trip.<br /><br />candy flipping is interesting. i recommend trying it but it&#039;s not for me. the time dilation of the lsd makes it feel like your roll lasts forever. i actually got bored during my candy flip with 170mics lsd and 130mg mdma.

				i love candy flipping do not get me wrong.&nbsp; timing is key however to do this combo to the fullest.&nbsp; which honestly can be a huge bitch depending on how fast your body is deciding to digest during that day (AND YOUR ACID STOMACH :S).&nbsp; Ive found that two hours into the acid is the best time to try to unite the MDMA, this means take your MDMA like 30 minutes before this time occurs, so 1.5 hours after you take your acid.&nbsp; Everyone is different, this just works best for me.&nbsp; sometimes if you do it wrong you can just roll, or just trip, or just candy which I describe as exclamation pointing....all night long!<br /><br /><br />however if you want to have a conversation with someone, or hit on girls, or talk to anyone but yourself, stick to MDxx&#039;s.&nbsp; I cannot communicate with anyone, rather barely form a sentence on a combo of good lsd and mdma.&nbsp; whew!

				The first time I did either - or any &#039;hard&#039; drugs for that matter - was a candyfilp. It was sort of a benchmark you might say....<br />I&#039;d recommend dosing with LSD once - first. Take your trip/s, then wait about 20 minutes and take your first dose of MDMA. It should really catapult the come-up into the happysphere! Believe me, candyflipping is a GREAT idea.&nbsp; ;D

				Coming off the MDMA before the LSD has worn off is not very much fun, it can lead to dysphoria and feelings of unwellness. Make sure to try and make them end at around the same time. I say take the MDMA about 2 to 3 hours after the acid.

				oh the two in a unison peak will sky rocket you to a beautiful galaxy of wonder<br /><br />do a bump of MDMA one and a half hours after your L consumption,and then after an hour do another bump<br /><br />its important that the two peaks meet each other so that they make each other realize their hallucinogenic and empathetic characteristics<br /><br />Have fun !!

Mahakala gave me a 50% refund, then quite a while later the product actually showed up. I kindof feel bad that I didn&#039;t pay the full price for it- just one of the candies was driving me insane, I loved it.<br /><br />In regards to candyflipping... it&#039;s not for me. The peak of the two drugs was very, very intense (I felt like my body was going to explode), though when that subsided it was many hours of bliss and beauty. However, when the Molly started to wear off (I took 100mg 2 hours in then 50mg 3 hours in), the feelings weren&#039;t too pleasant. I didn&#039;t have a &#039;bad trip&#039; persay, but it definitely wasn&#039;t a good feeling. I also couldn&#039;t sleep like I usually do after rolling, as the acid was keeping me stimulated.<br /><br />I guess it was worth a try, though I think I&#039;ll be keeping my Molly and Lucy separate from now on.
