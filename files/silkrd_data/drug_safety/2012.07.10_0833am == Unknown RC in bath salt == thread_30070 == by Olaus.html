				I would be damn impressed if anyone actually knew this. There used to be a specific brand of &quot;bath salts&quot; called &quot;White Diamond&quot; in the US. The packets were color-coded for certain RCs. Orange was obvious mephedrone, silver was MDPV, and one other one was just dumb old caffeine anhydrous. However, the BLACK packets contained something unlike ANYTHING I have ever tested. It was, for lack of better word, &quot;fluffy&quot; like baker&#039;s flour as opposed to &quot;crystaline.&quot; However, it was definitely a beta-cathinone because it burned to orange/brown and also degraded the same way in alkaline solution. The cathinone identity tells me it was a salt of some type of b-cath because freebases degrade rapidly and are typically liquid. Effects could be described as belonging to a &quot;party type&quot; stimulant lasting around 2 hours, having no measureable effect on heart rate or vasoconstriction, etc and no obvious harmful metabolites as par mephedrone. High doses proved safe but produced shakiness and paranoia. Again, no blue/black fingers, knees, or toes. Was the most shockingly &quot;social&quot; stim I know. Added benefit was the marvelous and unexpected absence of a comedown/withdrawal. Just catchup on whatever sleep was missed. <br /><br />My major candidate is flephedrone, aka 4-fluoromethcathinone. The unofficial profile of fleph has the right markings for the effects observed. I was once told, however, that the substance was meTHedrone, aka 4-methoxymethcathinone (beta-cath analog of the dangerous PMA/PMMA). Methedrone has the same unofficial write-up as flephedrone. <br /><br />Despite the fact that only MDPV and mephedrone were banned locally, the product vanished due to branding and association. Does anyone have ANY more definite idea or experience related to this?
