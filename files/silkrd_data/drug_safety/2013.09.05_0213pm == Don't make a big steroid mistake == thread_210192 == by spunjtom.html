				just wanted to share a little advice for people new to steroids.&nbsp; comments welcome.<br /><br />-wash your hands before you inject.&nbsp; not just a little.&nbsp; more like a surgeon going into surgery.&nbsp; lots of germs hide under your fingernails- remember this and act accordingly.<br /><br />-clean the area you inject with rubbing alcohol.&nbsp; never hurts to splash it on your hands after you wash them too.&nbsp; you must be clean.<br /><br />-don&#039;t be stupid with number of compounds or dosage.&nbsp; don&#039;t push it!&nbsp; stay conservative.&nbsp; never add more than one new steroid at a time, or you won&#039;t know what is causing side effects!&nbsp; steroids effect you psychologically and this is a fact.&nbsp; keep the dosage low.<br /><br />-there are many guys bigger than you who only use test and have only used test their entire juicing periods.&nbsp; you don&#039;t have to load up on everything under the sun to get big.&nbsp; you have to work out hard and right, eat right, sleep enough, and take care of yourself in every way possible.<br /><br />-never do any recreational drugs while on steroids.&nbsp; never.<br /><br />-never drink alcohol while on steroids.&nbsp; never, never, ever.<br /><br />-if you have depression or psychosis or problems with your temper or if you are bipolar, you have no business doing steroids.<br /><br />-if you are under 18 you should never do steroids.&nbsp; most people say you should be at least 21 and have 3 years of solid lifting experience and you should already know how to eat and how to work out to grow muscle.&nbsp; steroids are not miracle drugs.&nbsp; if you don&#039;t know where muscle comes from and how to make it grow bigger, steroids will not change this.<br /><br />-read up and learn about PCT.&nbsp; if you don&#039;t at least know what clomid and nolvadex are, and how to take them- you are not ready for steroids at all.&nbsp; stay away.<br /><br />-if you have high blood pressure steroids are not for you.&nbsp; steroids will make high blood pressure worse, not better.<br /><br />-if you are taking steroids as a shortcut to a better body, you will fail.&nbsp; there is no shortcut.&nbsp; this does not mean that steroids can not help you reach your goals because they can.&nbsp; however, nutrition and proper technique will do much more for your physical appearance than steroids will.<br /><br />if anyone wants to add to this list please do.

				Good advise +1<br /><br />Testo will do you just fine. No need to put every deka- nandro- whathaveyou in the mix.<br /><br />Plus, taper off!!!!!! Again, taper off!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Don&#039;t just pump 1500mg testo into you week after week and then stop abruptly when your ampules run out!!! Slow tapering is where it&#039;s at. Give your body time to start producing its own juice again.<br /><br />Lastly, get your estrogen blockers! You don&#039;t wanna have your body up your estrogen like crazy because of the testo onslaught you unleash on it. Remember Bob from Fight Club? Yupp, this is Bob, Bob had bitch tits.<br /><br />Stay safe...

				PCT (post cycle therapy) and anti-estrogens are really important!&nbsp; so true!&nbsp; as for shrinking your cock, no.&nbsp; not true at all.&nbsp; you will have great erections while you are using testosterone.&nbsp; your balls might shrink a little bit temporarily since they are not making their own testosterone, but that comes back with proper PCT, and rather quickly.

With recreative drugs it is easy to find logical, accurate and reliable information focused in a risk-reduction perspective. But in steroids you will find on the one hand the anti-drug propaganda stating that every use will cause impotence, cancer and madnessâ€¦but in the other hand a lot of forums showing examples of cycles with strange combinations, very high doses and patterns of use that can have significant toxic or long-time effects. Most of the information is transmitted mouth-by-mouth but does not have a scientific basis.<br />Some steroids have been studied in clinical trials. These clinical trials can serve as indicative of cycles with reasonable risks. This does not mean that these patterns are 100% sure, but, at least, there are some proofs of its efficacy and security. Testosterone, oxandrolone and nandrolone are the most studied steroids and, from a pharmacological point of view, seem the most sure.<br />Some studies with reasonable dosing and duration are these:<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8970686<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8637535<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16424293<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14578370<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22848006<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10208143<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20974577<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16494628<br /><br />Gains obtained with these patterns are less dramatic than high doses cycles. But quality and duration of muscle is much better with these dosages. In fact, with high doses most of the weight gained is water that disappears when steroids are finished.<br />Other important aspect is that problems associated to cycling, like hepatotoxicity, are not frequent in the mentioned studies (only oxandrolone has a mild potential to produce this). So the rule of drugs to protect liver is unnecessary at these dosages and, in high doses, there are no proofs about its efficacy.<br />The same happens with PCT. Human chorionic gonadothropin has shown efficacy treating infertility, erectile dysfunction and azoospermia in very heavy users of steroids:<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9538490<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12801577<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7714991<br />But there are no proofs that it is useful or necessary in moderate regimes. There are no data showing efficacy of clomiphene or tamoxifen and its role is based in theoretical speculations transmitted mouth by mouth<br />

				All good points ACE, thank you.&nbsp; A lot of people think that steroids will work their magic without sleeping enough, eating enough protein, and working hard.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t work like that.&nbsp; I have people email me and ask about steroids when they don&#039;t work out at all- they expect to inject and grow muscle.&nbsp; Not kidding.

				The medical community was wrong when they said that steroids wouldn&#039;t help a person gain bulk (they actually said that, they also said that a normal diet was enough too) if you were a bodybuilder. <br />Now they say that steroids cause all kinds of heart disease (Arnold had that heart valve operation years ago-wonder if it was due to steroids?) and all kinds of stuff. <br />I wonder where the truth lies?

Unless you lived with low T most of your life, the greatest benefit you&#039;ll get from AAS use is improved recovery from workouts. In other words, steroids help you endure harder training so that when you actually build muscle after the workout, you end up with more and it will be of better quality. You still get what you put in.<br /><br />Now if you have low testosterone, taking a large dose of T alone will absolutely make you bigger and firmer even if you sit on your ass and eat normally. It won&#039;t have this effect on most normal healthy men, and certainly not professional athletes that are likely to have high levels of T naturally.<br /><br />It is also a myth that testosterone shrinks your dick. It temporarily shrinks your balls in steroid doses, and if anything it will make your dick LARGER. No, it won&#039;t literally grow in size, but it will get as hard as physically possible all the time. If your T levels aren&#039;t where they should be, you&#039;d be surprised at what a difference it can make.

				Thank you all for this information!! I feel like I might dip my feet into testosterone a bit, and this definitely helped as a basic guide. I haven&#039;t looked up much on it. Not even sure if I should be using PCT after a test cycle (maybe it&#039;s only estrogen blockers/tapering test?). I&#039;ve been working out to stay in the current shape I&#039;m in for about 2 years, prior to that I gained 30 pounds of muscle and fat in 2 years by weight gain, eating alot, cutting cycles, etc. My girlfriend complains that my sex drive is too low, we usually have sex about 1-2 times a week. I&#039;ve tried Test pills before, but the pain is taking 6 of these huge capsules 2x a day. The good thing was I had a huge boost of energy and my dick was rock hard when I had erections (plus I&#039;d have to masturbate for almost 15-25 minutes while watching some kinky porn just to get off. I know someone will probably just tell me to google it, but if anyone has any reliable links or info on how to start off on the right foot, I&#039;d really appreciate it!<br /><br />

				Definitely you need PCT after a test cycle but if you are doing testosterone replacement therapy that is different since there is no &quot;cycle&quot;, you just stay on it.&nbsp; You can get more general information and read about different user experiences on steroidology.com, elitefitness.com, and the forums at steroid.com.&nbsp; If you want specific advice just send me a message on the main site and I will get you sorted.
