				Out of mushrooms, LSD, mescaline, DMT and MDMA which would you guys say has the most potential for lasting improvement in mood? Or maybe there&#039;s others I haven&#039;t listed?

				DMT, high dose shrooms, 1000 micrograms + LSD, will shred any sort of depression.&nbsp; Not only that, but you&#039;ll probably most likely be declined to use any sort of drugs for a while because you feel serious enlightenment.&nbsp; Learning to let go is one of society&#039;s biggest problems, if you can let go of your physical self, your mind, you will be free and have no limits.&nbsp; The way it should be.&nbsp; Of course many people freak out, set and setting is always an important factor.&nbsp; Have a responsible, trustworthy, loving &#039;sitter&#039; will also aid you.

				First time I did mdma i was happy for a week or two. Nothing like that on lsd, shrooms. Everyone&#039;s different, though.<br />Also, OP, look into ketamine and MXE.

It&#039;s like the difference between tripping on shrooms or pure psilocin.<br /><br />Like aleph7 said, it&#039;s good to have an experienced shaman or other psiritual guide to oversee your ayahuasca trip if you want to get the most out of it. I mentioned Daime centers in my earlier post. The Church of Santo Daime is a Brazilian religious organization that mixes old Catholicism with some African and Amazonian religious traditions, and uses ayahuasca brew as a sacrament. I don&#039;t believe they have centers outside of Brazil, but I do know of another similar church, called Uni√£o do Vegetal, which has centers in the U.S.A. and some European countries. They can legally make and use ayahuasca, because, as a religious sacrament, they have a legal exception. However, it is still illegal pretty much everywhere for it to be sold, or even consumed outside of the context of a spiritual ceremony.<br /><br />If you can, tripping with these guys is a great personal growth experience that you should absolutely not pass up on.

				I suffer from clinical depression and I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s best to stay away from psychedelics such as LSD, shrooms and anything trippy or causing hallucinations. The reason is because anxiety occurs frequently as a comorbid disorder with depression, so taking psychedelics could induce anxiety/panic attacks in susceptible individuals. <br /><br />I have not tried them for fear of getting panic attacks/bad trips, but then I&#039;ve been diagnosed with anxiety and am on medication for it so you probably won&#039;t experience the side effects that I&#039;m likely to experience if you don&#039;t have anxiety, or if your depression is not severe. But I still think you should approach them carefully just to be safe, such as starting with much lower doses than normal and being in a relaxed state before trying them.<br /><br />
