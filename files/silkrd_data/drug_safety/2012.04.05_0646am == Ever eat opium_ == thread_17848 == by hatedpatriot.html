				Anyone here ever eaten opium? How would that compare to poppy tea or taking morphine sulphate? I know you can break that down into numbers and say well opium contains 200mg of morphine per gram and blah blah blah. But, we all know that chemical synergies are a strange and mysterious thing. Especially in the case of opium. I would like to hear from some people who have actually eaten it and have had experience with other opiates, regardless of the route of administration, and how it compares.

				So I dont have a lot of experience with opiates, have never had poppy tea and only a couple occasions with morphine(none too impressive, but I tend to need more than most).&nbsp; I have grown poppies a few times gaining a few grams of raw opium each time.&nbsp; I know when i would thin out the little ones to make more space I would eat the little sprouts, and would get a decent buzz from that.&nbsp; I also lick the knife and my fingers when I am scrapping the pods and also get quite high.&nbsp; I have been told to make a tea out of the remaining plant matter after the pods are done, but never have.

				Like green tea I would think some of the stuff in poppy seeds (whole or ground) are water soluble so tea is better than just eating it? (Don&#039;t hold me on it I&#039;m no expert.)

				It&#039;s basically the same as tea.&nbsp; If you have NO tolerance, I&#039;d parachute an aspirin sized bit, maybe a bit less.&nbsp; The effects will last WAY longer than tea, so you can start small and add more if you need to after an hour or so.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t going to ruin anything by dosing small over a few hours to get it right.<br /><br />If it&#039;s good, you should feel nice for a day or even more.<br /><br />Keep in mind that, as far as you&#039;re concerned, I&#039;m just a group of letters on the computer screen.&nbsp; Be careful as always.
