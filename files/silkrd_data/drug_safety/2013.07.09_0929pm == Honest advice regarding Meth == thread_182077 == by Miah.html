				So I&#039;m not new to drugs. Been using them since 95, started with weed and went from there. Past few years I&#039;ve been into opiates, mostly vics however once I lost access to them I got into stims namely adderall. Again I lost access to them and now using meth. <br /><br />I guess my question is to other Meth users is when does your using become a problem? I just realized that I&#039;ve been using Meth for the last 22 days straight. Like 2 day binges then I crash. I was supposed to go to a function recently and I couldn&#039;t cause I totally crashed out from using. I tried not to use and the most I could do was a day and a half and I used today cause I just felt so bad. Like I know it&#039;s a problem now but my question is how much of a problem is it and any advice on breaking this cycle from anyone that&#039;s been in a similar position would be greatly appreciated.

				At first glance that sounds pretty extreme yes.<br /><br />I try to stick to oral use only, I guess I lose a lot out of it but in theory that&#039;s much less dangerous?<br /><br />I get insomnia though, and then the next day I just can&#039;t &#039;get it up&#039; and I don&#039;t want to waste it or age myself prematurely so I just leave the rest..<br /><br />Got a thread going here on healthy meth use though<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182590.0
