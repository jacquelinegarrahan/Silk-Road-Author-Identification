				What up everyone. I just wanna say that after trying 25i for the first time like a week ago, I was pleased. It was my first order from SR and I thought it was awesome. So i&#039;m now thinking of getting more, but I noticed the vendor I ordered from last time is on vacation, so I searched more similar vendors, and noticed someone selling 25c-nbome. It is basically the same&nbsp; exact price, and seems like it&#039;s exactly the same.<br /><br />Does anyone here have experience with either one of these chemicals? I&#039;ve done 25i, and I heard it&#039;s a little more on the dangerous side. I also heard 25c is safer than 25i. Erowid showed that 25i had more confirmed deaths from 25i. <br /><br />So basically just feedback or knowledge on 25c and how they are similar/differ..difference in effects, body load ect. would be appreciated. I&#039;m really curious to know if 25c is safer.

				It&#039;s doubtful that some NBOMes are more or less safe than others. 25i is simply by far the most widely used.

				Dude, with all due respect to Vanquish I know he&#039;s on a one man crusade against 25i-nbomes after some bad incidents he had but really, if you stick with blotter and just hit a tab or two at a time I wouldn&#039;t worry. Now, if you have good cash, yeah, by all means stick to doing acid but I really don&#039;t think demonizing a chem just because a few dipshits go OD&#039;ing on a hundred times normal dosage is reasonable. <br /><br />I&#039;d a million times rather take my chances on nbomes than on hard drugs like coke, heroin or meth.

				Just 25i Nbomes for me. I&#039;ve hit up to two hits and tripped harder than on anything else before or after. Since it doesn&#039;t screw much with your head you can still hold a conversation and act normal if you must around other people but inside you&#039;ll feel like your head&#039;s a teakettle about to go off. Lots of visuals too. It&#039;s a fun drug, just gotta respect it and not go too hard. I can&#039;t for the life of me see myself EVER wanting to do three hits let alone a five strip. Even if you didn&#039;t end up frying half your neurons what would be the point? You wouldn&#039;t enjoy it. And enjoying it is what it&#039;s all about.

				I&#039;m in the same situation dude holy fuck. I&#039;ve taken 25i twice, first time(1x1000microgram blotter tab), was aight but I had no weed so it was OK. Still pretty impressive. Anyways the other night I gave one each to 2 of my friends. They tripped harder than anything else in their whole lives lol. I took 1 and like 2/3 tabs that night. I almost couldn&#039;t handle it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong it was amazing. I&#039;ve taken acid like 3 times and that&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve actually tripped(besides my first time trying 25i). The visuals were amazing, everything was just trippy as hell..and for like 6+ hours!! The fact that I tripped that insanely hard for hours on end blew my mind lol. The thing I DISLIKED about 25i was; I knew in the back of my mind both times I took it that 25i is a research chemical with no knowledge, and there are confirmed deaths, so it can kill me if I&#039;m not careful.<br /><br />I&#039;m always the careful one but the whole time that night, I was afraid that I was gonna die lol no joke. Even if it was just 1 2/3 tabs. I was freaking out trying to do tasks to make me feel better. Vascoconstriction was a bitch, but not too bad. Idk just the fact that something could go wrong at any point, and its possibly lethal kept me from really enjoying the experience.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Otherwise it was fuckin awesome!

				I&#039;m knocking on 45 myself and out of shape and only started doing psychedelics this year. Before now I&#039;ve done weed like maybe 2 or 3 times so talk about a noob and someone at risk! For me the worst was the sweats you get on come up. Just take a cold shower if this happens and you&#039;ll be alright. It&#039;s speed so you&#039;re probably not going to sleep too good that night so maybe do it earlier in the day.<br /><br />Again, this bears repeating, stay away from nbomes that come in powder or liquid. It&#039;s damn near impossible to not overdo it. Do a tab or two, that&#039;s it. And then give it a long rest before you do it again. That should do the trick to minimize adverse risks.

				This is an interesting thread, I have recently obtained both a sample of 25c (1200ug blotter) and 25i (600ug Snuff Cap).<br /><br />I have never taken either drug before. I have a long history with psychedelics with over 20 years of use. I have tried some of the &quot;designer&quot; psychedelics from the 2C family recently, I found them quite mild, but interesting. <br /><br />I had a little nose online and of course saw the deaths from these drugs, it appears these are for those taking a high dose? Im assuming a 600ug hit wont kill me lol or at least I hope it wont!<br /><br />Effects wise what am I expecting here, Ive heard its similar to the 2C family but is very speedy. I&#039;m not a speed fan, so be honest, is this an all nighter type of affair if I dropped this stuff in the evening? Is it one of those come 5am im cursing the fookin drug! lol<br /><br /><br /><br />

I&#039;m only doing psychedelics now after lots of reading up on it. Mostly I&#039;m afraid of getting hooked on something so hallucinogenics seem pretty safe if done with care and I&#039;m responsible enough in that sense.

I definately wouldn&#039;t make a habit out of it. I&#039;ve learned from past experiences not to make a habit out of anything seriously damaging. Which is why I smoke a alot of weed ahah. <br /><br />Well look, I&#039;ll say this...I wouldn&#039;t mind taking a tab every now and then but there is a serious margin for profit, IF and only if you are a caring, informative, genuine and HONEST supplier/dealer.

				Don&#039;t let personal anecdotes scare you, just use it moderately. 1-2 tabs every two weeks or so and you&#039;ll be fine, you already know the chemical doesn&#039;t react harshly to your body. If you want to use the drug, then use it. I find the experience of 25c pleasant, as long as I don&#039;t have an empty stomach. Taking 1 hit with no tolerance is crazy fun.<br /><br />Don&#039;t take retardedly high doses like everyone who writes a bad trip report for it, and you should be okay.

				Snorting definitely takes it to the next level. I have done 5 tabs on my gums at once (fuck that burn) and then re-dosed to like 14 throughout a night (before realizing that re-dosing with Nbomes is completely futile). But after snorting 3 of Tylers caps, I was tripping harder than all those tabs put together. <br /><br />As a result of my 25i usage, I would never touch it again. It wrecks your body. Like, severely. Even the 2C&#039;s are so much better that the Nbomes in regards to this. But if you are looking for hallucinogenic enlightenment (your username), then NBomes are very likely NOT going to get you there. 25i is like the party acid. Super speedy and energetic and over quickly with no real connection to what happened. Most of the time the visuals come so think and fast that you don&#039;t know what you are seeing. Doesn&#039;t leave much room for thinking. LSD and Shrooms on the other hand take you in a journey and you reach an understanding. <br /><br />That being said though, I fell in love with 2C-E. My favorite of RC&#039;s for sure! I suggest trying it out! <br /><br />Probably the biggest thing was the massive body load and the overwhelming chemical feeling of the NBomes. I really don&#039;t like that. Try something like Shrooms and you would never go back IMO. <br /><br />Anyways, I advise heavily against the Nbomes. Bad, cheap shit. <br /><br />DG

				I really appreciate everyones input on this. Btw- I know nbomes aren&#039;t the best things I should be ingesting, and don&#039;t plan on it for much longer at all.<br /><br />@Vanquish, I&#039;m sorry to hear about your bad experience with nbomes, that really sucked to read.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t enjoy ingesting nbomes but I do enjoy the effects. The body load is pretty bad for 25i(only nbome i&#039;ve tried), which has me wondering if the trip/high is even worth it. <br /><br />*But anyways, my original question for this thread was &#039;&#039;Is 25c-nbome or 25i-nbome safer&#039;&#039;? Like which one of the two is more OK to consume, and is there even much of a difference in the high between? <br /><br />Once again I appreciate everyone&#039;s input but I&#039;m still wondering about that question.

I thought I had been poisoned, felt sooooo sick on the stuff!<br /><br />Well I have 1200ug&#039;s of both these drugs, both free samples. I cant see me taking it anytime soon.

As with life, don&#039;t get sucked into the &quot;I want it now and want to do the least amount of work to get it&quot;. Nbomes will give you an experience and it will give it to you quick and hard, but if you are seeking something deeper, it will not take you there. If you are just going to a party and want to trip, then by all means, take Nbomes. <br /><br />To answer you question then, I would stick with 25i. I have tried both and I enjoyed 25i more. 25c is a tad more low key. 25i is the more popular one by far and for good reason.

It&#039;s a wonderful hallucinogen when respected and used wisely.<br /><br />Just my 2 bitcoins.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well ive never had so many negative effects from any drug i ever used (Maybe besides alcohol) but seriously, I had the worst headaches ive even experienced in my life on these chemicals. And the fact that some people sell them as LSD in my opinion is the worst (can be prevented if they print the chemical on the blotter). <br />But I find no real reason to support these when you have such wonderful psychedelics which are far safer and have been used for many many years, People still don&#039;t know what the long term effects of these new psychedelics simply because they are new! <br /><br />If you wanna use them go ahead but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary to recommend them!<br /><br /><br />Cheers, Hailsatan :)
