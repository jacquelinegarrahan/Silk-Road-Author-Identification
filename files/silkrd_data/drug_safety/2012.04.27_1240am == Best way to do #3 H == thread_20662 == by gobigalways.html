				I am expecting some #3 H because I thought it might be fun to try smoking H. I am used to shooting H. I am wondering what the best way is to smoke #3. I am also wondering the best way to shoot #3. I was doing about 40mg of OPI&#039;s #4 pebbles. Is #3 as strong as #4 H? Will I have to do more than 40 mg if I decide to shoot the #3 H.

				Are you getting it off Silk Road? I just got some from Psilocin, and it&#039;s really really good. I&#039;ve not tried OPI&#039;s #4, so I can&#039;t really compare the two, but I am female, weigh about 100lbs. and I banged 35mg last night with magnificent results. I have a fairly low opiate tolerance, though. My friend, who has a high opiate tolerance, injected 100mg and he was fucked up. I have smoked his before though too, and the best way to do it is off of tin foil, if you know how. I also was able to smoke some from a glass freebase pipe, but the tin foil really worked best.

				One thing id like to add is when smoking your H try and finish your lets say 50mg dose as fast as you can. I mean still hold in the hits but dont put small little 10mg ammounts on the foil at a time and keep redosing. If you smoke a nice ammount in lets say 5-10 min youll get a nice rush compared to spreading it out over 15-20 min. The first time i smoked H i kept putting tiny little bumps on the foil because I was scared of burning it all away by accident i still got high but tere wasnt really much of a rush at all...then i smartened up and put half a bag on the foil all at once and got a bueatiful nod.

				All I can say is if you have not tried OPI&#039;s pebbles you should . His gear is top notch. Thanks for the input. I am still also wondering what I need to do to shoot #3 H.

				I dont usually shoot but I did a few shots of #3 and used&nbsp; vitamin C pills I got from the pharmacy. Make sure they dont contain binders...the ones I got weighed 1000mg----980mg being vitC and 20mg being some herbal shit. Anyway I sucked the top layer off it was kinda yellowish(im guessing this was the herbal stuff) and the inside was pure white the vitC. So I crushed it up and used a small matchhead size to cook 50mg of dope. What I did just to be as safe as possible was dissolve the matchhead of vitC in a spoon first...suck it up through cotton...then wipe the spoon clean put in the 50mg of dope...then add the vitC water from the syringe...cook up the dope(didnt need barely and heat)...then suck up the dope through cotton again. Filtering the vitC seperately through cotton is safer then just combining it with the dope and filtering through cotton.
