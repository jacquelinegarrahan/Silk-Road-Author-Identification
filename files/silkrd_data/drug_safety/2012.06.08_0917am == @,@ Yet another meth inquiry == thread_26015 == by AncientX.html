				So, as most of you have read already, im an avid CM smoker. I dont do IV, or snort it, or any other way, just smoking it out of a good Freebase pipe ( Oil burner ).<br /><br />Well, when i first got into smoking about a year ago. ( Only about last august, did it start becoming a weekly, nightly kind of thing ), noone really told me what a &quot; Typical &quot; size bowl is for a new user, So far, i&#039;ve always just put little BB sized shard(s) into the bowl, and then roast it up lightly like the good book says to lol.<br /><br />Im just curious, as far as how much someone can smoke at once, and still be okay. ( Not OD, or have to hit the ER )<br />I go through maybe Half a gram every week to week n a half. <br />I wanna smoke more during my sessions, cause it seems after like 2 - 3 hours, im coming down gradually, and i need to hit up another BB sized shard. ( I don&#039;t smoke the entire shard in one sitting, its usually spread across 2 sessions )<br /><br />So any help to keep this Wannabe-tweaker Flying high safely is much appreciated.<br /><br />Also, its only been recently that ive started smoking by myself, i use to do it with a friend, but he;s away for a little while. <br />He was usually the one to regulate the dope, since it was his supply we were always smoking.

				Still need a answer to this...If you don&#039;t wanna post your knowledge for the public to see, go ahead and send me a private message.<br /><br />Im a long time smoker, just inexperienced when it comes to loading my own gear.<br />Trying not to push any boundaries. <br /><br />Also, pictures would help to if you can find any of what &quot; Typical &quot; bowl of Crystal meth should resemble.<br />

				So you wanna smoke meth huh? Great, I&#039;m your guy.<br /><br />First, buy a milligram scale. Seriously, stop reading and buy a milligram scale. Don&#039;t come back until you have a milligram scale and STOP SMOKING until you have a milligram scale. Understand?<br /><br />Next, how much can you smoke in one sitting and still be fine? That depends on what you mean by &quot;fine&quot;. By now, you probably have developed quite the tolerance so I can&#039;t tell you to take the normal medical dosages which is 1.0mg/kg. You can probably take more than that. I HIGHLY suggest that you stop using and taper your tolerance until 1.0mg/kg is enough for you to get a great experience. However, you probably won&#039;t listen to that piece of advice huh? Okay then, your best guideline on a safe dosage is low enough that you don&#039;t experience any disabling comedown effects. You know that hangover the day after drinking too much and you can&#039;t get out of bed? That means you have incurred massive neurotoxicity. Alcohol causes minor permanent damages and nowhere near as bad as amphetamines can. If you have a significant comedown, YOU ARE TAKING TOO MUCH. Please heed this piece of advice. Use the comedown as a lesson for your future dosages - it should only be very minor symptoms if any. Don&#039;t worry about smoking though. You are lucky in that meth is not anymore dangerous with smoking as long as you are not binging. If you want to binge, (DON&#039;T BINGE) use insufflation, oral, or anal. If you like taking high dosages, take 3-4 days break in between each dosage. For chronic daily use, the max you should use is 0.5mg/kg (although you could probably take higher on account of your tolerance).<br /><br />If you like meth AND minimize the chances of fucking up your life, don&#039;t fucking binge. Set aside a maximum of one gram per month.

				Im a meth newbiw because it is not so populaire in europe. <br />How can i make a simple test to know what quality my meth is ?<br />If i smoke it in a oil burner, is there something i need to know ? Or just put 0,1-0,2 in the pipe and burn ? <br />I smoked 10 years Heroin on foil.Is it the same practice ?<br />How much pipes (dosage) did i smoke at the beginning ?<br />If i want to snort, how much should i take ? 0,1 ? <br />I heard that i have to forget all things about snorting if i want to snort meth, because if i would take the same dosage meth like snorting&nbsp; Speed or Cocaine (0,2-0,2)&nbsp; i would get a heart attack.Is that right ?? So if i want to snort meth the maximum is 0,1 ?<br />What about the dosage if i want to shoot ? A quarter of 0,1 =(0,025) ?

				Wow, thank you! that is exactly the information i was wanting! <br />haha. <br /><br />I can&#039;t afford a scale at the moment, but i think i&#039;ve got the hang of what size/amount of shard i need to put in to get pretty ripped.<br /><br />My tolerance isn&#039;t really that high, cause i dont smoke EVERY single day, but i know i do it a few times throughout the week, very small doses, About 4 - 5 small bowls spread through out the day, with shards about the size of a pin head. ( the round ball at the end of a pin ) <br /><br />I crushed the entire bag of what i had, so that it is more of a miniature shard/powder.<br /><br />I equally divided it into 7 different piles, each a little smaller than a dime.<br /><br />Bagged them individually into tiny dope bags i had lying around.<br /><br />So, in theory...i think i have spaced out my dope evenly enough ( without the use of a scale ) <br />To where i will have a decent 7 day supply. <br /><br />And from stories i&#039;ve read/heard, the amount im doing, is miniscule as compared to what some other indulging meth addicts burn through a pipe hahaha. <br /><br />So far, i feel i have a good handle on my addiction thus far, I don&#039;t necessarily &quot; Crave &quot; the dope, its more of a &quot; Shit...i have things to do today, and im fucking lagging in the real world pretty hard... &quot; So, i&#039;ll pull out my handy little pookie ( oil burner ) , Drop in a shard or small pile of powder, rip it about 2 - 3 good times, set it down to cool off, and go on about my day until, i feel my high slipping a little. <br /><br />the only thing i see being a problem....is i know...its bound to happen... one night, im gonna finish one days supply...and somehow try to justify it to myself to break into the next days bag. @.@ such a vicious game it plays<br />

				If i were you, i wouldnt even attempt at trying to shoot it up your veins bro. Once you do, you wont be able to quit. and im not kidding, the one fact about dope that remains constant aside from health factors, is that if you use a needle....you will be instantly addicted, and find its one of the hardest drugs to kick.<br /><br />So just be careful.<br /><br />As for dosing, What ive been told since yesterday and today, aswell as reading 10&#039;s of hundreds of different forum articles and threads, is that for smoking, and snorting, A newbie should use around anywhere from 45 - 100mg. <br />If you don&#039;t know how to smoke it properly, there is a guide here on the forums, that explains in very good detail the steps, and process of smoking meth. <br /><br />As for snorting, and anything else. I&#039;ve only ever smoked it, and i only ever intend to smoke it. <br /><br />( It just dawned on me as im writing this.... i notice all of my addictions involve a substance that is smoked... So it may be a possibility that its not the drugs im loving so much, but the smoke itself.... Maybe it could be a mental thing? ( But i know with dope...its definitely a chemical thing.. )&nbsp;

With most drugs, spreading your dosages out is safer - but NOT amphetamine. <br /><br />Phew, I&#039;m glad I caught that. That is quite literally the worst thing you could do with amphetamines. Do not redose bro! If you want to take a lot, do it all at one time. It is several times safer that way in terms of lasting tolerance and neurotoxicity. Read my thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0<br /><br />I made it specifically for guys like us.

				Well when i dose myself, i always just take about&nbsp; 1 - 3 Okay sized hits, not huge fucking mushroom clouds of smoke, but about as much as you&#039;d exhale on a cigarette ( yes i know there should be more smoke, but im barely burning my dope so it will last me longer until i can afford more :D )&nbsp; <br /><br />And i think if you saw the size of the shards/powder im loading into the pookie,&nbsp; You&#039;d probably be like &quot; Oh? is that all...well fuck...thats baby doses... &quot; <br /><br />It really doesnt take alot for me to get a somewhat decent torque going on. and it usually only lasts a few hours before i cant feel the actual high, only that sensation of &quot; I couldn&#039;t even sleep even if i swallowed a whole bottle of tylenol PM &quot; <br /><br />And as for how long i remain high, i usually dose a few hours after i wake up ( if i even feel like it, some days, i just wanna curl in bed with my weed pipe, and just get stoned while i watch TV. ) <br />I always try to at least eat something before i start indulging in &quot;The Crystal Method&quot;, as i like to call it. <br />Im always hydrated from lots of coffee and water that i drink during the few hours after i first wake up. <br /><br /><br />But, on a side note my brother.<br /><br />A relative is coming to visit me next weekend, and she has an interest in trying crystal for the first time. <br />Any tips i should give her before i infect her with this posion of a drug? hahaha
