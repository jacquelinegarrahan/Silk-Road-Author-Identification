				Been clean two years now. I know how to slam dope. Problem is, no dope where I am. I have some 2mg Dillies, but other than 200-300mg of tramadol a day I have no opiate tolerance at this time. How much should I IV? 1mg or 2mg to start with? More? Less? Is height/weight a variable I should account for when adjusting dosage for co-user?&nbsp; How&#039;s the high? I&#039;ve heard the rush is awesome but the legs suck. What should I expect? Thanks. Gengted

				2mg is fine for a first dose. you may even want to use 4mg after you get used to it. but don&#039;t redose to soon because you won&#039;t get much of a rush. i&#039;m actually typing on dillies now. the rush is awesome but it is also true it has short legs. but if you have shit to do (like go to work) you won&#039;t be nodding out all day.

				Will I get a good rush off 2mg? Should I try 3mg? Keep in mind I have basically no tolerance.

				Alright. I&#039;ll stick with 2mg. I appreciate the info. On another topic, I saw you posted some in IPs H thread. Did he ever come through for you? Last I hard from him he was going to post new product yesterday but he never did. I was really trying to hold out for him to come through but I just ran out of patience.

				Also, what cc and gauge rig should I use for a 2 mg dillie? Thanks for all the straight up info too man. It&#039;s hard to try and filter through the bull shit when I try to Google anything about this.

So we may find out tomorrow. I think the problem is he has to wait to cash in his bitcoins before he can get more product and relist. Thats what everyone was waiting for last week.

				Well if you get Hydromorphone IV in a hospital it would be 1 or 2mg, but keep in mind that for some reason the hospital diluidid seems to be much better vs the pills, even in equal doses. No idea why, but it&#039;s true. <br /><br />In any event, in your situation I would think that 2mg would do ya just fine. Keep in mind with D&#039;s that it is pretty much all about the rush, the high doesn&#039;t last very long. With in two or three hours, max, you will feel like you could do it again - however, you need to go about 6 to 8 hrs between doses to maximize the rush. <br />
