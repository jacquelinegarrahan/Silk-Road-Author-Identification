				Sup guys probably 20 mins ago I dropped a tyler tab 25i 1200 ug&nbsp; my FIRST Hallucinagion ever. Havin a hard time keepin all this spit in my mouth without swallowing and about 4 minutes ago i sneezed and spit went everywhere....hopefully this does not affect trip.... I&#039;m excited and a lil nervous that I&#039;ve overdone It but I guess we&#039;ll see. <br /><br /><br />Not to much to report so far except for when I sneezed I laughed hysterically for probably 45 seconds straight.... Not sure If that&#039;s due to the nbome or the liquor I have previously been drinking.&nbsp; Anyways will update! Any helpful advice from experienced trippers :P

				No notable visuals so far but I&#039;m definetly feelin it. Can&#039;t look at myself&nbsp; in the mirror without laughing....Can&#039;t really do to much without laugh tbh. I&#039;m moving alot too. I&#039;m not 100% sure if I dosed correctly though because I lost alot of the spit when I sneezed,&nbsp; then lost the rest when I went Into a violent laughing frenzy realizing I had spit the rest out....

				I would stay with just the one tab at the minute mate, just get a feel for it and see how it develops, because sometimes drugs can take a while to creep up on you! To many times I&#039;ve taken to much of a particular substance due to thinking &#039;taking just one more half will make me feel better&#039;, then by the time it hits I&#039;ve realized i&#039;ve taken to much and then it turns into a bad time. But hope it goes well for you, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have a great time! :)

If you can, go look at a tree and be outside for some of it. If anything gets too weird just chill and keep in mind it is only temporary and will pass! Lay off the herb until you get a good feel for your new mindset!<br /><br />You probably wont be able to read this text on the screen pretty soon however.
