				I see alot of people talking about storing there meth in a freezer. Is this a good way to store it?Would this ruin it in anyway? How about if it was vaccum sealed and placed in a freezer?

				I don&#039;t see why you would do that at all. It isn&#039;t like acid that will degrade rapidly with light and air exposure. I think a nice baggie tied up is fine.<br /><br />I had to store 3.5 grams that was tied up in a baggie up my ass for a couple days one time when I went to jail and it was perfectly fine when I got out. My friends and I would crack jokes about having that &quot;good shit&quot;

				No, it wouldn&#039;t, but a better place would be in the fridge in the vegetable crisper drawer, because they are designed to keep low humidity where your freezer will typically have a higher humidity due to the ice on things in there.

				Get a spice out of your cabinet that nobody uses wrap up your meth real good and put it at the bottom of the spice in the very back of the pantry. Nobody ever looks back there, and nobody ever uses uncommon spices fast enough where they would uncover it. Cinnamon is a good one, because it usually comes in a solid rectangle container with a solid colored lid that you just sprinkle out and little does anyone ever know there are a few grams of shards at the bottom.<br /><br />Any of you out there ever do things like this? Get real spun out and then something happens to freak you out like a close buddy gets arrested for something and you think he might rub you out to save his ass and have to find someplace to hide it real quick secretly in case they already staked out your house waiting for you to step out and bust you?<br /><br />Probably seems crazy, but at the time it made sense. Especially when my friend got hammered with 1.5 oz&#039;s of crystal and a pistol and we had a partnership. I supplied the cash and he sold the dope.

				i actually thought that fridges had higher levels of humidity then freezers. what if it was vaccum sealed multiple times? i know temperatures going up effect the methamphetamine molecule but does it reaching any sort of low temperature effect it in anyway?

				That is why I said put it in the crisper. It has a low humidity to keep your veggies crispy and not soggy. There must be some time of humidity regulator in them some place, but it is widely used on the shroomery as a way to dry out mushrooms and store them since it has a low humidity.<br /><br />The regular fridge does have more humidity. The temperature isn&#039;t going to effect it that I know of, and usually drugs degrade when heated not when kept cold. Meth is pretty stable, so it is going to take a little cold to do anything to it.

				would multiple vacuum seals help with this? by crisper im guessing your speaking of the plastic drawer at the bottom of the fridge? i dont see how this makes the humidity any different to the rest of the fridge seeming its not even airtight?

				Then by all means do it! lol <br /><br />As long as you seal up the meth real good you can bury the stuff and it will be fine.<br /><br />A vacuum seal would prevent any moisture or air exchange which would keep the product just like it was when you sealed it. <br /><br />I am not sure why or how the crisper works, but I know it has been mentioned a lot on the shroomer by experienced growers for drying out mushrooms (takes significantly longer to dry) if you didn&#039;t have a dehydrator and storing them. They know their shit pretty well and mushrooms need to be cracker dry to prevent decay, so there is something to it. I never really cared to research the technicalities of it, because I read it many times and it was suggested by more than one respected grower and vendor member.

				No, it won&#039;t hurt it. Your worries are heat which you would have to get it up to it&#039;s melting point and water which it loses some of it&#039;s potency after sitting in it for so long, but not a whole lot. I actually read this really scientific report somewhere on the DEA website about all these tests they did on different drugs to see how different elements effected them and to what degree.

				so say somehow some sort or rare freezer moisture gets through my 20 ziplock bags and 646545 vacuum seals would it effect my meth? i thought that meth just suspended in water and once the water was evaporated it was just back to normal meth?

				I don&#039;t know the exact time variables, but water will effect the potency of meth after a certain amount of time. It doesn&#039;t damage it a bunch (again didn&#039;t remember the exact percent) but water definitely degrades it after some time. <br /><br />The exact variables are out there on the net. I was reading through all the DEA micrograms reports and it was in one of those where they didn&#039;t show drug seizures, but threat assessments I think. Get your detective skills out and you will find it.

				Most molecules aren&#039;t affected by cold - the lack of heat - but by the presence of heat. Methamphetamine is no exception. you can safely store it in the freezer for as long as you like. The effective humidity in a freezer is 0%, because water solidifies at zero degrees celcius, and a freezer is typically -14 degrees C, so the partial vapour pressure of water - or indeed pretty much any solid - at its freezing point is close to 0 mmHg.<br /><br />You can store meth under liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees without doing anything bad to the molecules.<br /><br />The reason there&#039;s an ice crust in your freezer is that the water present in any air that gets into the freezer freezes and is deposited on other ice crystals. Minutes after closing the freezer door again the humidity drops from whatever it is in the ambient air to close to 0%.<br /><br />The one caveat with storing meth in the freezer is that when you remove it it&#039;ll be -14 degrees C, and so water from the air will condense on the bag, or the crystals if you&#039;re daft enough to open the bag while it&#039;s still cold.<br />Double bagged is probably enough. Let the bags and drugs come to room temperature before opening them. This way condensation will form on the outside bag, but will never form in the crystals.<br /><br />There&#039;s no reason a solution of stoichiometrically pure methamphetamine in distilled water won&#039;t keep at room temperature for decades. Most methamphetamine isn&#039;t pure, though, so storing it in solution will likely lead to degradation.<br /><br />

If you&#039;re in a real fucking hurry, and it&#039;s properly vacuum sealed and watertight you can pull it out of the fridge, dump the package in a sink full of warm water, and have it at room temperature or slightly higher inside of ten minutes.<br />If you&#039;ve got time, just let it sit out of the freezer until it&#039;s no longer cold to the touch. Wipe off the condensation with a cloth or paper towel, and open it up. If it&#039;s not appreciably colder than the air in the room then no condensation will form on it.<br />
