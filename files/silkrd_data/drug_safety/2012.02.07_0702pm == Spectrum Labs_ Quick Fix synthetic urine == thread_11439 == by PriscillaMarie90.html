				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Quick Fix synthetic urine is premixed laboratory urine designed to protect your privacy during a urine test. The Quick Fix is unisex so a male or female can use it to pass nicotine tests. To ensure passing a urinalysis, the Quick Fix contains all the ingredients normally found in urine and is balanced for pH, specific gravity, creatinine, and several other urine characteristics. The Quick Fix bottle comes with an attached temperature strip and heating pad to ensure the sample is at body temperature.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://urineluck.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=4&amp;idproduct=10<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t know if anyone cares or not, but there comes a time in almost everybody&#039;s life when you will need to pass a drug test. I was lurking the web, searching for a miracle when I found this product. If you type the name into Google, about a million sites come up, mostly advertisements, some bluelight/grasscity posts, but no really helpful information. Regardless, I said &quot;screw it&quot; and purchased a 2oz bottle. To be safe, I bought an Integrated EZ Key Split Specimen Drug Testing cup (http://www.ezkeycup.com/E_Z_Key_Cup_5_p/dud-157-023-019.htm) to try this product for myself. The cup had test strips for Opiates, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Cocaine &amp; THC. It also had strips to test for adulterants, which included Oxidants(bleach,ect.), Specific Gravity, pH, Nitrite, Glutaraldehyde &amp; Creatinine.<br /><br />I was pleased to find that the Quick Fix passed with negative results on all the drugs, and it also tested as &quot;Normal&quot; for all the adulterants, meaning the specimen is legitimate. It looks like Quick Fix is going to help me build a better case for my lawyer to use for me!<br /><br />HOWEVER!!!!!!!<br />I don&#039;t know if this product works for urine tests that are sent in to labs for testing. I&#039;ve seen quite a few stories of urine that was sent in for a job or something similar and the results came back as invalid. It worked for the instant-result test cup but I can&#039;t say if it would work for any more thorough test.<br /><br /><br /><br />I dunno, hopefully someone else will find this useful! Lol :)

				I actually got some of that stuff, too. From Amazon. Just in case I ever needed to use it, but I still haven&#039;t had a situation I&#039;ve needed it in, yet.

				Oh I have taken plenty of drug test, and can say I have 100% success rate. The synthetic urine does work very well. It is a little nasty having to mix it, but it works. In my area they use Quest diagnostics and it has worked every time.<br /><br />I reviewed the site you went too, and I have never tried that brand. The urine that I use is dehydrated synthetic.<br />

				quick fix is a non mix synthetic urine. I&#039;m under the impression that this will pass a lab test as well (though I can not confirm this with positive results as I never ended up having to &#039;pee&#039;)<br /><br /><br />if anyone wants an unopened package 4oz (biggest one, newest formula 5.6 I believe the number is) I would sell it for 4.5btc shipped to US<br />I also have an unused white colored ALS pee weiner (whizzinator original) that I would sell for 13.5btc shipped<br />Prices are far under what they&#039;re sold for retail.. I bought them because I thought I would have to piss test for a job but ended up not having to. Only have 1 of each of these. Would also trade. US only.<br />
