				Hey guys, from what i&#039;ve learned over my psychedelic taking years, the act of &quot;making&quot; consumable LSD tabs is an extremely complicated process, and requires a very smart person with a background in chemistry. Unfortunately I do not meet those requirements. However, i&#039;ve noticed that a vendor is going to start selling the pure LSD crystals on the road pretty soon. Hypothetically, if you had the LSD crystal already in your possession, how ard would it be to make tabs? Is it still an extremely complicated process? I am just curious, and will most likely not purchase a pure LSD crystal as it is most likely very expensive.

				There&#039;s some posts on clearnet forums that go into pretty good detail.<br /><br />Takes a good setup, some attention to detail, and being able to continue laying the tabs while you get incredibly high.

				It&#039;s not that hard if you are well prepared. Just make all the calculations beforehand and try practicing with the solvent first (without any crystal in it).&nbsp; The true art is to get every hit the same dosage!<br /><br />Here is a guide that has been posted before:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />OK so you got some crystal and need to get it on blotter. It`s a pretty amazing feeling holding a jar in your hands that has 10 grams of crystal in it. That`s 100,000 doses in the palm of your hand. For dealing with laying we`ll say we got 1 gram. Acid is always layed 1 gram=10 tenpacks. A tenpack is tensheets. 1gram=10,000doses. If your laying needlpoint your doses will be 95mcg, because your crystal is 95% pure. If your laying amber your shit will be 70mcg, because it`s 70% pure. got it<br /><br />Now you get a glass pyrex pan to dip your tenpacks in. Your crystal is dissovled into 110ml. of everclear per gram.The purer crystals dissolve instantly with a little stirring. The not so pure take a little shaking. Champange is damn near impossible to get to dissolve evenly.<br /><br />Paper-for white blotter standard watercolor paper#14 or equivalent is used. It`s critical you get the right paper. If you don`t it won`t absorb right and you`ll fuck it all up.Print`s are made up ahead of time and perferated.<br /><br />OK so you got your crystal dissolved and your paper cut and ready. There are 2 schools when it comes to putting it on the paper. First dump the solution in the pan and dip each tenpack into it then lift it up and let any excess solution run off into the pan. Second method is to put the tenpack into the pan and squirt the solution on it with a baby syringe(the ones they give little kids medicine with). I Have done both and prefer dipping them just because its quicker .Then the tenpacks are layed out to dry which doesn`t take long since alcohol evaporates quickly. If you did it right there will be very little residue left in the bottom of the pan.This redidue is extremely potent and is either soaked up with a piece of paper(called mop up) or made into potent liquid(called wash). Whatever you choose this is saved for your personal use. While your doing all this you get very,very high. As soon as you open the jar of crystal it intoxicates the air. Most people were rubber gloves when doing this some don`t. Just don`t have any plans afterwards.<br /><br />There might be slightly different methods used when laying, but this is how the dead family does it. After the tenpacks are dryed there distibuted and eaten up. Since the end of the Grateful Dead the massive distribution network that used to get rid of so much acid has been broken up badly. Never fear Acid is still out there&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">#How much solvent do I need?<br /><br />Weigh the paper, then saturate the paper.&nbsp; Weigh the saturated paper.<br /><br />Saturated weight-dry weight gives you the weight of the alcohol needed for the sheet.<br /><br />Weigh out that much alcohol, add the powder.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(..) is right, I lay Nbome, you just check by seeing weight of saturated and non saturated then doing the math. With my blotter its about 1 gram of ever clear per 100 hits o a ful 9 sheet art would be 9 grams. Make sure to ALWAYS have excess solvent. I used 10 grams for a 9 sheet art to be extra safe cuz its better to have a little weaker hits than poorly laid hits because of not enough solvent. Make sure to weigh pre saturated and saturated blotter around 3 times and obtain an average. Best of luck!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Easier than nBOME because you don&#039;t have to be precise at all.&nbsp; The old way of doing it from the hippie days was to put the blotter sheet in a large ziplock with the liquid LSD solution then let it hang dry.&nbsp; The way to do it precisely is with a micro pipette just like with nBOME.&nbsp; I wrote up a small tutorial on how to do this on here somewhere but I&#039;m sure that you could figure it out without someone explaining.

				Haha.<br /><br />I like how everyone has a different answer and everyone is certain their answer is the correct one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone in here have a degree in chemistry?&nbsp; Anyone here the lay crystal back in the day?

				By the way Thisworld, it definitely does not take a degree in chemistry to be able to do simple elementary math and lay sheets of blotter. ::)

				I know, but I don&#039;t believe for one minute that 5% of the people here have taken high school chemistry.&nbsp; The basic stoichiometry I learned in the first week of high school chem is all the math needed to lay blotter; well, I suppose that and some common sense(which oddly enough, isn&#039;t seen very often anymore..).&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget to subtract the mass of the powder you&#039;re adding because that will throw off the nice accurate number you got for your weight of your solution.&nbsp; You can&#039;t just add the weight into the mass either because they don&#039;t combine in such an elementary way.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;ve got an attitude about it.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t being demeaning to anybody, simply making an observation and then taking the pressure off, by mentioning that those were rhetorical questions. Do you not understand rhetoric?&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s tedious to use a micro pipette?&nbsp; You wouldn&#039;t last very long in a lab.<br /><br />Besides, I can say with relative certainty that mrxempire is trolling at this point, so I&#039;m going to go do more productive things.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS: I like how you took a full three posts(including a double post) to respond to me, in attempts to be demeaning, then negged me to boot.&nbsp; Well, +1 to you friend.
