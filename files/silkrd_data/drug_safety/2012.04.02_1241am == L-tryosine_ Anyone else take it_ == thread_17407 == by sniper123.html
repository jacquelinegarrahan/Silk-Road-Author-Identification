				I been taking 1000mg L tryosine everyday for about a year now. I started to think it doesn&#039;t work so i quit taking it. I noticed within two days how agitated i became. Things just seemed to piss me off more easily and my quality of sleep started to suffer. Plus, for some weird reason i started craving nictone more. Anyone else take L tyrosine and has it improved you daily life?

				your not supposed to take that everyday.... l tyrosine causes a release of dopamine much like amphetamines(ironically it works wonders after a binge), which means addiction is a high possibility. why do you take it everyday? i usually use it after a long binge to feel normal again.

				I used L-tyrosine to kick my pain killer addiction and it worked wonders. Sounds like you may have a dopamine imbalance now that you took L-tyrosine for so long and will need to go into a minor withdrawal period until your body can get back to normal. <br /><br />Try working out and eating well - that should speed things up. Good luck.

But, doesn&#039;t fire dopamine like amphetamines. If i remember correctly it feels up the tank, but doesn&#039;t cause release of dopamine because of the way it crosses the BBB. Correct me if i&#039;m wrong. I wish i could find the journal entry. I hate not being able to source my information. After i get done with this essay i&#039;ll Google around and see what i come up with.

I imagine getting off them will be similar to caffeine withdrawals - a couple weeks of mild depression and irritability but after that you should start feeling normal again. Try eating a diet rich in protein where l-tyrosine is found naturally.

				1g is hardly a big dose, a couple of slices of chicken breast has more than a gram of tyrosine in and a couple of grams of phenylalanine.<br />Placebo.HCl sure is a powerful drug...

				Something i was wondering. If both of your parents used dopamine and serotonin heavy drugs are their life. Is there way someone could inherit a dopamine deficiency with a predisposition tolerance to those certain substances? <br /><br />Maybe that&#039;s why L tryosine works for me and seems like placebo to most because they already they are getting their dopamine in their diet or don&#039;t have dopamine deficiency.<br /><br />Also, on a side note. Is it possible to test for the deficiency of breaking converting it yourself through food? If i remember correctly. I remember reading something about people not being able to convert the amino acid on their own. <br /><br />Any thoughts and suggestion on what i just mentioned would greatly be appreciated.&nbsp;
