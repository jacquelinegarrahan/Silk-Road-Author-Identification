				Strange story. I was out drinking most of the day with friends then decided to drop one of schizofreens pills (150-180mg MDMA) at around 10pm. To be honest I had not eaten anything since midday and was drunk by then. 20 minutes later my whole world was upside down. Shit was morphing into each other, peoples faces, I was &quot;missing&quot; frames - as in people would jump from one position to another instantly like a video buffering online. It was some crazy, crazy shit and I was not expecting that at all.<br /><br />I had to go hide in the toilet for a good hour before I felt normal (high) again and stopped hallucinating.<br /><br />After that I enjoyed the night and was fine but god damn, not experienced that before. Possible that something was in the pill or just given the circumstances it was a heavy dose?

				i dont know how much you drank but drinking on an empty stomach and probably being dehydrated and then taking mdma is not best idea.

				Sounds like a strong pill lots of alcohol and a big case of nystagmus (heavy eyeball wiggles).&nbsp; High doses of alcohol or MDMA alone can cause this.<br /><br />MDMA is also capable of giving you decent visuals at a high dose - especially on an empty stomach.<br /><br />Cut a long story short you got owned....<br /><br />

				Sounds like dehydration. Similar experiences have happened to me, and each time they were remedied with water/food. Remember to eat/keep hydrated and it probably won&#039;t happen again.

				never take MDMA on an empty stomach. i take 150 mg on mdma on an empty stomach and i have the same effects even without the alcohol. so i think that and the alcohol should be cut out of your next roll. my advice is always eat about 2 hours before a small meal, so you are not hungry, but not full when u finally get around to eating it

				sounds like the pill was laced with something.&nbsp; the fact that you drank that much alcohol probably didn&#039;t help either.

				Sounds like I need to get some of those rolls.<br /><br />Seriously though this doesn&#039;t sound like that much of an abnormal thing to happen.&nbsp; The dehydration was a factor, and as its been said rolling hard can be weird sometimes.&nbsp; If I&#039;m going too hard, sometimes I will lose conciousness for seconds at a time.&nbsp; Not like I am passed out, but awareness of consiousness.&nbsp; That might not make sense, but I don&#039;t know how else to explain it.&nbsp; But it leaves those little glitches where a few seconds is gone.

				Woah this reminds me of a time when I took these shitty e&#039;s, I had loads of them! took 12 at once (they were such low quality, i&#039;m not trying to act like I&#039;m &quot;hardcore&quot;) after a full day of drinking, shortly after it started raining... I was stuck outside with a few friends who had also taken them and this rain was terrential! Like seriously the worst rain I&#039;ve ever seen, an I live in Scotland so that&#039;s very fucking rainy!<br /><br />Some weird shit happened to me though, Idk how to explain it but the rain made me trip like shit! It was a scary trip man. Like the rain was biffing me out, it felt like patches or something an I can only vaguely remember it but every time someone spoke to me I&#039;d like hear them in one ear then the other there was a delay or some shit thats what it felt like! It was just some dodgy shit to me, I&#039;m not much of a pill guy!<br /><br />Idk this was a pointless story, but yea sounds like you had one of they kinda things aswell, with different effects obviously!

				Shizofreens pills have good reputation as far as I know. But using pure MDMA crystals will reduce possibility of other ingredients acting together.<br /><br />I guess the alcohol played it&#039;s role here. I always resist the temptation to mix drugs, beer and weed both in moderate doses are exception.
