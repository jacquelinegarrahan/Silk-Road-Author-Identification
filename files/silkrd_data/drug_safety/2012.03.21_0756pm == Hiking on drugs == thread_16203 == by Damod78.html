				I usually bring some weed with me but I&#039;m gonna be carrying a heavy pack so was looking to see if any tried any other drugs that would help.<br /><br />No coke or meth, lasts too short and crash to deep.<br /><br />So far i really like 4-fa, gives a stim feeling and lasts 6 hours.

				I actually love *lower doses* of certain psychedelics while hiking- LSD or 2C-E in particular.<br /><br />Being in the nature while tripping is something special, and I love being &#039;active&#039; on these two chemicals. There is usually little body load, and when you are moving even less so. 2c-e give some nice energy without being at all &#039;speedy&#039; which is something I can not stand. At lower doses, I find it really uplifting, nice colors, no body load, great mental activity, while still being very manageable in terms of actually being able to carry out physical activity!<br /><br />Would personally not suggest speed- but that&#039;s just me. Weed is also great for taking breaks!

				yeah i was gonna suggest a psych - we always end up rambling on shrooms, lucy or 2c-X. might not be such a good idea if you&#039;re carrying shit though.<br /><br />i reckon speed would be ok for the actual hike, but probably a nightmare if you&#039;re coming down camping somewhere

				gonna bring some gandofi&#039;s shrooms and a couple hits of LSD. not sure how i&#039;m gonna like when carrying a pack though. 2c-e is something i&#039;ve wanted to try. <br /><br />so far its weed, 4-fa, speed, shroom, lsd, 2c-e, and hash. <br /><br />hope i don&#039;t freak out any people while hiking and tripping and tripping.&nbsp; :D

				Jesus, I couldn&#039;t imagine hiking on stims or psychedelics. I do pretty strenuous hikes, so anything like coke or speed would make me feel like my heart is going to explode. I would smoke some pot definitely, or better yet eat a brownie or cookie, because smoking anything will cause you to get out of breath faster. But I would wait til I got to a camp site or close to one before I took any psychedelics.<br />For me, the absolute best thing to take while hiking is opiates. Not enough to get wrecked, but enough to make you feel good and make that leg pain non existent.

				Definently bring some herb, and if you&#039;re not in a hurry, psychedelics like LSD or Mushrooms, just make sure you know how to get back and aren&#039;t doing anything too rough where you can fall off a cliff you&#039;re climbing. Shroom and Acid Hikes are so classic and a lot of fun, especially mushrooms, they are BUILT for nature. It&#039;s not so much as going to help you hike but rather you&#039;ll look at your path differently as if you&#039;re on a pilgrimage.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re going for the extra push, ephenedrine, opiates and painkillers for the survivalist.&nbsp; ;)

				LSA, in the form of HBR seeds, is a nice, light trip that always has me feeling full of energy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ran on LSA and enjoyed some of my best runs. It felt like I could go forever.

				Oh yeah! LSA is... interesting. Go for the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, (HBR) versus the Morning Glory, they have the most kick. They won&#039;t make you trip out ike acid would, it&#039;s more like a body high, with mild CEV&#039;s, and mind expansion. Although it can be sedating in a way, makes me yawn a lot more than CID does, but that&#039;s part of how relaxing they area. Very healthy though, but I read they have more issues with vascular constriction than LSD has but I&#039;ve never noticed a problem with either.
