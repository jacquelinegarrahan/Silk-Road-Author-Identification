				I&#039;ve tried quite a few drugs in my time and I am once again looking to expand my horizons. I&#039;ve been recommended 2C-b, which, from my understanding, is similar to lsd and mdma in one. Sounds like a lot of fun. My question is are any other in the 2-C family worth a try, and how do they differ from 2C-b? Just looking on the road we have the following available for purchase:<br /><br />2C-B <br />2C-C <br />2C-D <br />2C-E <br />2C-I <br />2C-P <br />2C-T-2 <br />2C-T-4 <br />2C-T-7 <br /><br />Also if anyone could tell me the dosages for the less commons ones as I cannot find any information online about it that would be much appreciated.

				Hey man!<br />I tried 2c-b a week or two ago. Id reccomend just doing 25mg swallowed first dose. Go to erowid to research all these. I have E and I on the way, and have ordered P before but it didnt arrive. Hopefully again soon. Gotta catch em all!

				I&#039;ve only had 2CE and 2CB so far, and both are equally awesome. 2CB&#039;s body load was quite intense (and only at 10mg!) and I felt like I wasn&#039;t getting much out of it... until I smoked a joint. Read my trip report in the SR forums titled - The Multiverse - if you are interested. It&#039;s a good read, I promise.<br /><br />2CE was amazing. Some serious visuals and serious enjoyment of music. I watched Across the Universe on that, and it is mind blowing.

				I like I when I tried it. More linear thought patterns but still sort of abstract so was great for some introspection. I have a sample of E as well and from what I hear it can be fairly intense (which I tend to enjoy :) )<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard P is only for serious psychonauts as it&#039;s just that intense, so maybe work up that one in particular (if you&#039;re keen at all?) No experience myself though so I can&#039;t really say.

				When people talk about the 2C family, they are referring to a class of psychedelics generally called &quot;substituted phenethylamines&quot;. The &quot;2C&quot; comes from the fact that there are &quot;2 carbons&quot; in the &quot;backbone&quot; of the phenethylamine molecule. If you go to Google and look up an image for phenethylamine, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m referring to.<br /><br />Since they all have this similar nomenclature (2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-C, etc) it&#039;s a pretty fair assumption most beginners make to assume that they are all very &quot;similar&quot; to one another. In actuality, they can be dramatically different in both effects and potency.<br /><br />As a class of compounds, they can have some negative side effects you may not like - nausea, cramping, headaches, variable duration of come-up, etc. The dosage required for effects is also variable from person to person. Even though you sound like you have a strong opiod tolerance, I wouldn&#039;t expect that to carry over to these compounds. As for the M1 (methylone), that compound has a very different pharmacological mechanism and I wouldn&#039;t expect tolerance to it to carry over either.<br /><br />The 2C family can be pretty seriously psychedelic and if you are just looking for a good time or a fun buzz, it might not be the best choice, but there are certainly a few that may be worth your time. I will give you my recommendations when I get to the descriptions of each in a moment.<br /><br />There are three types of 2C you will find around here and I will break them down according to *my own personal experiences* with them. Your mind may vary and I would advise reading on Erowid &amp; Bluelight extensively before investing in them. I would also recommend that you absolutely do not bother with any of the 2C drugs unless you have a nice milligram scale. Some people manage to get away with eyeballing, but I would never advise it. Even a 5mg difference can totally change the effects.<br /><br />When I discuss these chems, I&#039;m going based on my experiences at &quot;average&quot; doses per Erowid, etc. If you take a very high dose of *any* of them including 2C-C (despite what many will say), you can wind up in a full-blown, reality-destroying, rolling in your own vomit type of mindfuck. At the same time, taking a barely threshold dose can result in nice anti-depressant stimulation, or just a stomach-ache. You&#039;ll have to figure out your own personal dose-response curve on your own, but always start low!<br /><br />One last precaution - I really recommend having a benzodiazepine (Etizolam, Xanax, Valium) and an anti-psychotic (Haldol, Risperidone) around when you try these. I have saved my ass many a time with the anti-psychotics and sometimes you will come down from the trip but be entirely unable to sleep without the benzodiazepine. The benzos are also helpful when someone is having a &quot;rough&quot; trip. Save the antipsychotics for when you are in serious trouble.<br /><br />ALL DOSES GIVEN ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES. DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN PHYSIOLOGY AND ALSO QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT, IT MAY VARY. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO START LOW. START LOW. START LOW. INCREASE SLOWLY! IF NOTHING ELSE, REMEMBER THAT PLEASE!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Halogenated 2C-x<br />In my experience, these are generally gentler and more &quot;fun&quot; than the alkylated or thiolated 2Cs we will discuss next. These are the closest to psychedelic candy that you will find in this family. The &quot;halogen&quot; refers to the bromine, chlorine, or iodine atom that is placed on the phenethylamine ring.<br /><br />2C-C - least potent by dose, mellow, minimal mind-fuck, &quot;sparkly&quot; visuals.&nbsp; (Dose: ~30-45mg)<br />2C-B - best body high for me, interesting mind-space, can be very euphoric and recreational at 15-20mg, a true-blue psych at higher doses. (Dose: ~15-30mg)<br />2C-I - longest duration of halogens, crazy &quot;beams&quot; of light I do not get on any other 2C, very stimulating, headspace clear until higher doses. (Dose: ~7-20mg)<br /><br />All three of these combine well with many other drugs. I have found 2C-C and 2C-B to go very well with mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, LSD, MDMA, and weed. 2C-I is very popular but I suspect that has more to do with availability than anything else. I prefer 2C-B over 2C-I because the duration is shorter, the body-high is better (for me), and the headspace is more &quot;fun&quot;. Also, as the man who invented 2C-B said: &quot;Wherever you are with 2C-B, just hold on tight, in another hour you will be back to somewhere recognizable&quot; (paraphrased). 2C-C is a great compound - it has a fantastic headspace and very interesting visuals, but I feel somewhat mellow / relaxed and also do not get the interesting tactile sensations on it that I do from 2C-B.<br /><br />My recommendation for halogenated 2C-x: 2C-B. Whether it is the HCl or HBr salt, it is a great product. Look for anyone trusted on SR selling it and make sure it is whitish - you don&#039;t want anything brown or yellow - that means it wasn&#039;t washed very well.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Alkylated 2C-x<br /><br />These are 2C-x chemicals where instead of a halogen (bromine, chlorine, iodine) you have a carbon or carbon chain attached to the phenethylamine ring. With the exception of 2C-D, I find these to be much more &quot;serious&quot; than the halogenated phenethylamines. There are really only three that you are going to see around here.<br /><br />2C-D: Least potent, most forgiving, made me feel somewhat drunk or stoned, visuals were nothing unique until higher doses. (Dose: 35-75mg)<br />2C-E: Most popular, can be rough on body, serious visuals. Can be wildly euphoric and manic or very dark. A true psychedelic in every way. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br />2C-P: Absolutely brutal for me. Jittery and hard on my body, mind absolutely destroyed, duration &quot;infinite&quot;. (Dose: 3-12mg)<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend 2C-P to anyone. True psychonauts will seek it out on their own, but it&#039;s not my thing and I think it is too long and too rough for most people. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it unless you build your way up to it with other psychs first. 2C-D is very rare and some people really love it. I was not too impressed by it but it was forgiving and pleasant enough that I will definitely continue to return to it. 2C-E is bar none the &quot;winner&quot; when it comes to these three but I can only recommend it with the caveat that you absolutely start low with the dose.<br /><br />My recommendation for alkylated 2C-x: 2C-E. For some people, this is very recreational. All I will say is that in my experience, it has not been. I also feel no desire to go back to it, but I&#039;m glad I have tried it. I would recommend that you try it at home first and see how you react. It can be very beautiful visually but the body load was too much for me. You will be hard pressed to find a 2C-x that is more legendary or popular though.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thiolated 2C-x<br /><br />These all have a sulfur atom attached to the phenethylamine ring. There are lots of reports out there that indicate wildly varying dose-response curves and durations amongst individuals and I have found this to be very true in my own experience. The same dose of 2C-T-2 that barely affected me put my old girlfriend into outerspace for 8 hours. The duration tends to be longer and the mental effects more serious than the halogenated 2C compounds, but the visuals are wild for me. Again, you&#039;ll probably only see three of these.<br /><br />2C-T-2: My personal favorite but only due to circumstances that occurred while using it. Some GI distress but wild beams of light and fractal patterning, &quot;neutral&quot; and analytical headspace, somewhat dissociating for me. (Dose: 7-25mg)<br />2C-T-4: Only one I have not tried. Read some trip reports - duration is very long. Rare, does not seem to have enjoyable effects profile for most.<br />2C-T-7: Legendary, feels to me like a longer lasting, more visual, more euphoric 2C-T-2. I was far less lucid or coherent but had a much more enjoyable body buzz. Some trembling, tension, and cramping. Lasted much longer than DOC for me. (Dose: 5-20mg)<br /><br />If you find yourself enjoying 2C-E, these will probably be right up your alley. My experiences with T-2 and T-7 are similar to mine with 2C-E in that I&#039;m glad I had them, I can see the appeal and I enjoyed the ride, but I don&#039;t feel particularly compelled to return to them.<br /><br />My recommendation for thiolated 2C-x: 2C-T-2. The thiolated 2C-x compounds are a bit notorious due to the deaths from T-7 and T-21. This is generally regarded to be due to MAO-I (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) activity, so they shouldn&#039;t be combined with medication or other drugs although some still do so.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now, this is a totally shitty guide I have written for you here. Many will have DRAMATICALLY different opinions of these chems and doses. I hope that this at least gives you a ballpark idea of where to start. I personally recommend that you begin with 2C-B. Get a small amount, try a 15mg dose. See where it takes you. Wait a week and try a 20mg dose. Titrate up in a similar manner until you find what you&#039;re looking for. If you find yourself enjoying the experience, by all means explore the rest of the family, but just keep in mind the experience is different every time, every chem.<br /><br />I would recommend personally that you find a good LSD vendor (read reviews and make sure they aren&#039;t selling 25I-NBOMe or DOx on blotter) or a good source for 4-AcO-DMT / mushrooms and try those as well.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t look to anything I&#039;ve said as being textbook or authoritative - read up at Bluelight and Erowid.<br /><br />In any case, I hope you find what you are looking for.

				I tried 2C-T-7 and 2C-I years ago. Of those two I prefer the 2C-I, mostly because it doesn&#039;t last as long.<br /><br />Shrooms, LSD, and mescaline each seem to be more psychedelic, while the 2C series compounds I&#039;ve tried were more like &quot;you feel a little weird and see shit.&quot; Nothing wrong with either group, just depends what you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />2C-C and 2C-D both seem pretty boring based on their PIHKAL entries. If it were me I would try 2C-B because it has a very good reputation and it doesn&#039;t last too long. 2C-E sounds interested based on the PIHKAL entry too, just keep in mind it lasts twice as long and is a little stronger than 2C-B.

Many will have DRAMATICALLY different opinions of these chems and doses. I hope that this at least gives you a ballpark idea of where to start. I personally recommend that you begin with 2C-B. Get a small amount, try a 15mg dose. See where it takes you. Wait a week and try a 20mg dose. Titrate up in a similar manner until you find what you&#039;re looking for. If you find yourself enjoying the experience, by all means explore the rest of the family, but just keep in mind the experience is different every time, every chem.<br /><br />I would recommend personally that you find a good LSD vendor (read reviews and make sure they aren&#039;t selling 25I-NBOMe or DOx on blotter) or a good source for 4-AcO-DMT / mushrooms and try those as well.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t look to anything I&#039;ve said as being textbook or authoritative - read up at Bluelight and Erowid.<br /><br />In any case, I hope you find what you are looking for.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I found your post really interesting, especially last night, while 2c-e capsule was punch me hard...<br />I ordered few weeks ago, never tried 2c family, to be honest I didn&#039;t use a psycadelic drug from &#039;90s (excluding few mushrooms few years ago).<br />The capsule was 15mg inside, I didn&#039;t want to risk so opened and used only about 40/50 % of the powder inside... I thought anything happens...<br />Fuck me, really wrong!<br />After 2 hours first saw all green and pink colors, then big boom on my brain for about 4 hours (as a strong acid), sometimes I thought it was too much strong for me and I will be in panic, fortunately my old experiences gave me possibility to stay under control..<br />With the first lights of the morning I used one xanax pill for go to sleep after reading your advices posted here, I&nbsp; had few xanax pill again fortunately, but the effects already started to go down.. slowly..<br />This morning my head was after a night with alcholic... rest of the day all good, just a bit irritated...<br /><br />Conclusion: this drug is not for me, I&#039;m never been a big fan of psycadelic but especilly I am too much old!! :-)<br /><br />Thanks again for you post!

I&#039;ve been recommended 2C-b, which, from my understanding, is similar to lsd and mdma in one. Sounds like a lot of fun. My question is are any other in the 2-C family worth a try, and how do they differ from 2C-b? Just looking on the road we have the following available for purchase:<br /><br />2C-B <br />2C-C <br />2C-D <br />2C-E <br />2C-I <br />2C-P <br />2C-T-2 <br />2C-T-4 <br />2C-T-7 <br /><br />Also if anyone could tell me the dosages for the less commons ones as I cannot find any information online about it that would be much appreciated.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Honestly, B is only I could recommend to anyone in good conscious.. I&#039;ve experienced E, and some of the 25 variants, and B is by far a different experience from the rest of them. It deservves a class of it&#039;s own. The rest feel to harsh for me - If you want to trip take alice, if you want to roll take molly, if you want an awesome experience that is similar to acid and molly, but NOT a candyflip, take B.<br /><br />B is in a league of it&#039;s own, the others are all write offs imo compared to good lucy.

				2C-B.&nbsp; 20-25mg.&nbsp; Have fun.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; It&#039;s my favorite of the 2C-X family.&nbsp; It&#039;s also really, really fantastic with MDMA.<br />I personally wouldn&#039;t waste my time with 2C-I.&nbsp; In my opinion, 2C-I-NBOMe is much better.

				I finally got around to trying a larger does of 2CB and also combined it with MDMA.<br /><br />15-17mg of 2CB snorted is pretty horrible as everyone knows, and the come-up was shaky, cold and a bit nasty, but once up and tripping it&#039;s pretty nice!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why people say it&#039;s like Molly, because it really isn&#039;t.&nbsp; Maybe there&#039;s some mild similarities at lower doses in terms of the slight roll/empathogenic/teeth clenching sensation, but over about 10mg and it&#039;s very different.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a nice euphoria and the visuals are fun. At 15mg you can turn the visuals up or down depending on how much you zone out.&nbsp; Great fun.<br /><br />The other experience I did the Shuginesque thing and took 100mg of MDMA orally, then T-3:00 snorted 10mg of 2CB.&nbsp; It&#039;s like putting a turbo on things.&nbsp; Easier come up that&#039;s almost instantaneous, and 5 minutes later I was flying. Fucking wow.&nbsp; Kinda had to catch my breath on that one - the euphoria rush was kinda hard to ignore, like someone just grabbed the dial and turned it up.&nbsp; Super, super nice, I highly recommend anyone who likes Molly to give that a try.&nbsp; It&#039;s certainly better than redosing Molly because it adds another dimension.<br /><br />Otherwise, 2CB is great to have in your repertoire. A nice psych at higher doses, combines great with MDMA, and even at lower doses (&lt;10mg tooted) it&#039;s fun for a quick buzz.&nbsp; Another good thing is that you&#039;re not tripping balls for an entire day - even at 15mg+ you&#039;d only be a dribbling mess for 1-2hrs and then the return to baseline is quite quick.&nbsp; You&#039;d be down and functional in 4-5hrs.<br /><br />Another plus?&nbsp; The half-life is also super nice and puts you in a great mood.

I watched Across the Universe on that, and it is mind blowing.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I did that with 2c-p<br /><br />I&#039;ve had 2c-i, 2c-e and 2c-p multiple times. 2c-i is nice and rolly while being a bit trippy too. A favorite of many of my friends and a great starter psych, 2c-e is a lot less uplifting and very objective, you can easily have a bad trip, it&#039;s entirely set and setting. 2c-e is VERY nice, I love it. I&#039;ve never had 2c-e but I&#039;ve been told that the visuals are better than acid and second only to maybe DMT. I&#039;ll say they are great at the least.<br />I tend to go with 10mg with any of the 3 mentioned above. Though my most profound experience was with a mix of 10mg 2c-i and 5mg 2c-e, I was truly fucked. (at one point a smoke rose up out of the wood grain in the wooden floor, and I sat up as not to choke on the smoke. Took me a minute or 2 to remind myself that it was not real and I would not have any issues with breathing it)
