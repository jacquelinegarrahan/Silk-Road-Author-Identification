			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello There<br /><br />We have been selling, what we thought was, some smoking MDPV. However, excusing the pun, has anyone smoked it?&nbsp; We&#039;ve only ever used it as a coke substitute and any queries relating to consumption from first-time users have been given the same advice by us : tiny little lines to start with and work it slowly, EXTREMELY fine line between &#039;enough&#039; and &#039;OMFG I forgot what sleep was, can anyone fill me in plx?&#039;<br /><br />Hand on heart, the feedback has been glowing. Of the 30 or so packs we sold, a couple backed out when they read what it did on wikipedia, but the rest 100% thus far, bar one person who smoked it.&nbsp; Apparently it went clumpy and turned black so we would like to see if there&#039;s anything similar happening with other MDPV that people have had from other people primarily. <br /><br />We do have a different source for this but the consistency when dry is like wet coke, very clumpy and not as &#039;spicy&#039; when you sniff it, so we&#039;re aware that different sources can give out totally different textures for the same RC<br /><br />Just wondering if anyone has smoked it?<br /><br />Your thoughts?<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />TheEmporium

				I&#039;ve read that smoking MDPV releases some bad compounds that could harm your health. I don&#039;t know how legit this is, as it&#039;s hard to find reliable information about such new chemicals.

				There is that.&nbsp; <br /><br />We only ever used it as &quot;SuperCoke&quot; and sniffed till &quot;The Precipice&quot;, then it&#039;s either &quot;Rage on soldier, get to the chopper&quot; or &quot;2mg Xanax bars and sleepy fun-times&quot;<br /><br />We don&#039;t recommend IV or smoking it but we are responsible vendors so feeling a bit bad that someone tried to smoke it and it went tits up.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had to drop ship Xanax in a previous case where one guy took 3.5g in one night and then wondered why he he hadn&#039;t slept for a week.&nbsp; RC != Regular E&#039;s and Whizz, wikipedia anyone?<br /><br />We use everything we sell,&nbsp; probably more than we should (he says as his keyboard melts into the the table as the WoW/2CB kicks in, I LOVE YOU LUCY &lt;3 ) and this MDPV was ace, but RC is so variable that we&#039;re hesitant to re-list <br /><br />The WoW and MDMA is probably more appropriate and quantifiable.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want anyone to die FFS <br /><br />It&#039;s nice shit though, I&#039;ll snfff whatever :)) <br /><br />

				I am clearly leaving my run out the gate here a bit late (about half a year or so) but I thought I&#039;d mention this just in case it helps one person.<br /><br />mdpv only really took off in my city a few months ago and here it is generally smoked, though many have tried eating and sniffing it.&nbsp; Why I&#039;m not sure, the taste is horrible and my friends and I all found smoking delivered the best results.<br /><br />Smoked through a water pipe same as weed except we stack the cone with fresh cigarette ash and place no more than 1/3 of a point on top of the ash.&nbsp; Burning it slow and pulling gently with no intention of ripping the ash cone through delivers (we found) an almost instant high that would last for about three hours depending on body weight, personal disposition etc.&nbsp; Never dosing sooner than an hour between cones and never more than 1/3 of a point per dose resulted in nothing but positive experiences for the majority (about 25 people).&nbsp; Avoiding weed and meth during sessions also proved very positive for most.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some people can get real fiendish on it though and without some self control the results vary from no sleep for 4-5 days to intense paranoia, shaky nerves and all round &quot;i wanna die&quot; feelings, resulting from taking too much too quickly for far too long.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I love it and use it often (as per above) with no adverse effects as yet.&nbsp; Caution should be advised for first time use and as long as users are honest about their behavior and dose/method with themselves and others it&#039;s really no worse than the first time someone took a pill, mdma or meth etc in terms of come down/potential for shit times.<br /><br />Like I said real late here but I hope it helps someone, cheers.
