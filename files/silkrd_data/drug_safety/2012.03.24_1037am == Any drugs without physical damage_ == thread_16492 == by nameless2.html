				Alcohol is NOT harmless at all.<br /><br />In fact, it&#039;s actually one of the most harmful drugs out there. Physically and socially.<br /><br />I know LSD causes absolutely no damage to the body. Same as shrooms.

				Every drug will have some effect on your overall system, but the body is well equipped to deal with these disturbance if they are not overwhelming.<br /><br />Even alcohol is not so bad, and could actually be beneficial, in the right amounts.<br /><br />Cliche, but it&#039;s all in moderation.

				Anything in excess will cause damage (think about people drinking too much water). A lot of stuff in moderation is fine (most drugs). Some stuff will damage you even if you take a little (some radiation).<br /><br />A lot of drugs will be totally fine if you take the right amount and don&#039;t make a habit out of it. If one can keep to the right amount and not get addicted, really depends on the user.

				The theory behind DXM and MDMA&#039;s brain damage is the Olney&#039;s Lesions caused by Serotonin being released and no longer regenerating. So it&#039;s not a &quot;hole&quot; in your brain per say but rather an empty gap that&#039;s not healing. Still, like already stated your body is built to recover because they can be a huge body load.<br /><br />But to answer your question, vaporizing Cannabis is virtually no damage, Psilocybin, LSD and Mescaline have virtually no toxicity as well. DMT is pretty natural so they all have almost no potential for health problems other than what might happen to you while you&#039;re on said drugs. <br /><br />There&#039;s also the legal stuff, I don&#039;t think Kratom has any adverse side effects but I hear the really isn&#039;t any impressive side effects to begun with.<br /><br />Most hallucinogenic cause your body to build up a strong tolerance anyways with daily use so if you don&#039;t build one of those up I doubt you&#039;re doing enough drugs to harm yourself. <br /><br />That&#039;s not saying you might feel like you&#039;re harming yourself if you puke, just remember the Ayahuasca purging rule: It&#039;s cleansing out your body of a more unhealthy intoxicant; negativity!

				DMT, 4HODMT, 5MEODMT, LSD, Ibogaine<br />2C-X, DO-X, mescaline, 2C-X-NBOMe, MDxx/bk-MDxx (at reasonable doses). <br /><br />These are all easily metabolized by endogenous enzymes and can be used without causing lasting damage.

Most things are safe in moderation. Some things are safer than others but in the end how you use the drug is more important than the drug itself.<br /><br />@OP See prior statement but if you&#039;re looking for some drugs that are physically harmless you should look into LSD or Psilocybin. But again as I said, everything is safe if you&#039;re responsible and use moderation.
