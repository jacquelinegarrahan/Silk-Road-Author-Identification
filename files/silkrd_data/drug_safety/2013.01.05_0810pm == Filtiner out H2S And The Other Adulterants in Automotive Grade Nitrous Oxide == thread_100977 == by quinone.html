				Can anyone provide information on how to go about taking a tanking of automotive grade nitrous oxide (which should be easy to obtain) and removing the adulterant&#039;s to leave just pure nitrous oxide (to inhale from baloons :).<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard something about it needing to be treated by baking soda, but either way, how does one go about taking a pressurized tank of nitrous and treating it to remove everything but the nitrous?<br /><br />Do I need an empty second tank to ... bubble the nitrous from the automotive tank into?&nbsp; What kind of fitting&#039;s/methods and chemicals do you use to extract the nitrous from an automotive nitrous tank, treat it and then transfer the newly treated (and consuneable) nitrous into ... a new tank?<br /><br />Sorry if question sounds stupid, I just know you can buy a tank of automotive grade nitrous oxide (for a few hundred) and have it filled with automotive nitrous (for like $50) both legally.&nbsp; But just don&#039;t know from this point how do you guys treat the nitrous to remove the adulterant&#039;s so it&#039;s safe to inhale?&nbsp; I can only imagine I need a second tank to transfer the cleaned nitous into?&nbsp; But I dunno what sort of .... &#039;apparatus&#039; or which chemicals you would use to connect the two tanks so the dirty automotive nitrous i&#039;m flowing out of the automotive tank is cleaned of the adulterants like nasty H2S&nbsp; and then deposited into an empty second tank meant to hold the clean o so yummy clean and consumable nitrous (and of course you only do a baloon at a time and treat em like whippet&#039;s or else you risk being ignorant to the fact that overuse will lead to asphyxiation).<br /><br />Would be SOOOO much cheaper then buying whippet&#039;s (whipped cream chargers) and burning SOOO much money, cuz we all know how short nitrous lasts lol, a box of 24 whippets ... doesn&#039;t last long haha).&nbsp; Sure I can get em off amazon or e-bay for like $30 for 120 canisters, but jeez, a whole tank of nistrous used for automotive means ... that&#039;s equivalent to a HELL of a lot of whipped cream chargers lol

				There was someone selling conversion kits for those tanks on SR. I suggest sending that vendor a&nbsp; pm and he may have some good advice.

				Yeah ... I don&#039;t want a $500 &#039;kit&#039; (which is just information, he doesn&#039;t include a tank).<br /><br />I&#039;m asking which reagents are used, and how one maintains pressure between the two tanks.<br /><br />I do not wish to spend $500 purchasing information, especially when I can LIKELY buy most of the relevant equipment on e-bay, walmart and Fischer-Scientific/Sigma-Aldrich/etc.(I await his response on if that&#039;s untrue or whatnot and that his listing comes with the relative hardware.<br /><br />I just want a discussion on the methods of conversion, specially when talking about extracting the content&#039;s of a tank of gas (well liquid under pressure) into another, and any methods people have come up with too remove the H2S.&nbsp; I imagine you simply react the gas with a base such as lye, but removal of the residual sulfur I don&#039;t know how one would carry out.<br /><br />I figured this would be a topic of more interest to people who use nitrous oxide (N20) and are sick of buying box upon box of whipped cream chargers (no matter how &#039;cheap&#039; they are) since it&#039;s so easy and legal to obtain N2O by just going to any auto-enthusiast company that sell&#039;s tanks of it for what truly is cheap $300 tank, $40 refills ... don&#039;t even know how many hundreds -&gt; thousands of whipped cream charger&#039;s that&#039;s equal to.<br /><br />There is info out there, but I don&#039;t particularly trust drugs-forum.com when it comes to chemistry and I ... KNOW there are smart and honest folk on this forum with whom I thought this discussion would be of interest.<br /><br />Buddy with the listing want&#039;s $500 ... for information, doesn&#039;t even mail you a tank.&nbsp; <br /><br />Reduce the price to something uh ... reasonable (less then $100 .... $500 is ASININE) and i&#039;d be glad to look into their listing.<br /><br />Thank&#039;s for the reply/effort though LEFTY, +1 karma for at least trying to help :)

				I&#039;m a man of Chemistry, so the idea of using NaOH (in the form of lye), not a pipe fitter.<br /><br />So I get the side of adulterant removal, but as idiotic as I am to these things heh&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; just not whwt type of device/fittings you&#039;d need to put the NaOH into to bubble the adulterated N2O from one tank to another.&nbsp; Fairly confident it won&#039;t cost $500 in materials to manufacture the ... removal device / bubbler.<br /><br />If I&#039;m wrong and it would cost so much money then I apologize to this other vendor (rather not name him at this moment because I don&#039;t know if his kit is bogus or he really does ship the equipment needed to bubble out out adulterants ison some NaOH and that it does cost $500 in materials).<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind your name being mentioned and can provide me some detail eithere here or on SR on why the listing is $500+, i&#039;ll gladly throw your name out there/here for free advertising :D, but I just at this point until the process in some way is described a bit more detail and I don&#039;t end up just dropping $500 on a .pdf feel comfortable naming you, though any forum member whose read this thread and ... cared at all has probably already searched for and found you.&nbsp; In which case no prob. with the free advertising lol.<br /><br />I just know this process can&#039;t be as difficult or ... ELUSIVE as i&#039;m finding it to be.

				I suppose it looks something like an upside down glass or metal pop bottle filled with a liquid, the gas gets squirted out through a seive or gauze-like thing to split the gas into bubbles then through a layer of activated charcoal and possibly HDPE (although i don&#039;t see how that would help, it would help stop the liquid comming through into the balloons)<br />fill with something that scavenges the sulphur like HCl? or NaOH. then something to seperate the H from the N2O (this last step is only a matter of finding a chemistry forum and asking nicely)<br />alternatively, has anyone looked into sourcing medical grade nitrous somehow?<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen entonox vessels on ebay before but they&#039;re half filled with oxygen. still fun but not quite the bang. (you don&#039;t leave earth)
