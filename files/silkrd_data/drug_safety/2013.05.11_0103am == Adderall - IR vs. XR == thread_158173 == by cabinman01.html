				Okay, so I have taken Adderall 20mg IR plenty of times and it usually does the trick.&nbsp; Sometimes I even break them in half and use just 10mg and it works alright.&nbsp; My tolerance is fairly low I would say, and I also don&#039;t use them all that often(only for big exams and finals).&nbsp; My question is, in your experience would you say that Adderall IR or XR works better in general?<br /><br />&nbsp;I have never taken the XR&#039;s, and which mg of XR would work the best for a whole day for someone with low tolerance?<br /><br />

				It&#039;s a little less straight forward than that.&nbsp; Adderall XR is an extended release formulation -- basically that means that it dissolves more slowly in your intestines than the instant release tablets.<br /><br />So 20mg of instant release is instantly released and pretty much totally absorbed within an hour of ingestion.&nbsp; Give or take -- I always seemed to reach peak levels almost exactly 43 minutes after taking it, but your mileage may vary and I&#039;m no biologist and all that disclaimer stuff :)<br /><br />20mg of XR though, would be released slowly over a period of about 2 hours maybe (give or take).&nbsp; I&#039;ve never paid attention the extended release ones though, so I can&#039;t compare my own experience with them.&nbsp; In the end though, it&#039;s basically like taking a quarter of an instant release every 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; That&#039;s the difference.&nbsp; Which is better is up to you and the situation you&#039;re in :)

				Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I am basically just trying to see which is a better bang for a buck, the prices are ridiculous on SR. On the other hand, has anyone tried Focalin? I know it has similar properties to Adderall, but I&#039;ve never tried it.

				You could try some speed and see if that does the trick for you.&nbsp; It works for many, but for many it just doesn&#039;t do the job.&nbsp; Either way though, it&#039;s awfully cheap amphetamine sulfate -- you can get a gram of speed for about 20-30 bucks (which is anywhere from 40-80% pure amphetamine sulfate: so at least 400mg of it, or 20 adderall 20mg tablets).<br /><br />Fair warning, it&#039;s often mixed with caffeine and usually only available from Europe (not really a US thing -- it&#039;s all meth in the US).&nbsp; CapeCrusader and BoyMaster are generally considered the two best vendors if you want to check them out.

				XR&#039;s give me way more side effects than IRs.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why because it&#039;s not because I take so much more XR&#039;s dosage wise.&nbsp; That said XRs also seem way more potent too.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about both the actual original brand kind too. <br /><br />XR&#039;s if I take 40+ in a day I will have the worse high blood pressure side effects where I almost pass out when I&#039;m walking and my vision goes blurry and then total white to red.&nbsp; Not to add that I feel like total shit when I&#039;m crashing.<br /><br />Definitely feels better and for longer but the sides of XR&#039;s aren&#039;t worth it if I take higher doses.

				My point was IR at the same dosage and no side effects.<br /><br />First time ever taking adderall XR&#039;s was 60mg.&nbsp; Was still a new recreational user with a virgin brain so I stayed up for 2 days.&nbsp; However, the euphoria was bliss and was comparable to a 100mg MDMA roll.&nbsp; Good times till the sides kicked in.<br /><br />15-20mg XR&#039;s I can handle well.

				That&#039;s really weird, B0lix.&nbsp; Are you absolutely 100% certain that what you got was actual Adderall?&nbsp; Bear in mind that if you got XR gel caps, someone could easily have replaced the contents with something other than adderall -- I mean was it straight from the pharmacy or what?

				Lol yea straight from the pharmacy.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming it was just overdosing.&nbsp; Maybe the half life of the XR&#039;s has something to do with it.&nbsp;
