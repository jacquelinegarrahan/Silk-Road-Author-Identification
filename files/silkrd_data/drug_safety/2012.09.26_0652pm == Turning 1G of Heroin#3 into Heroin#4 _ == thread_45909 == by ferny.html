				What are the steps and tools i will need to turn 1gram of H#3 into H#4?<br /><br />I want to convert the entire batch in one go, rather than mix in some citric every time i use.

				its not recommended unless you plan to use the entire gram quickly (within a week i would say, and even then it may degrade slightly) because you will be left with the H in solution. <br /><br />add the gram to however much water you will need for each dose, then just add acid until all the H dissolves. store the solution in the fridge.<br /><br />this is a bad idea for so many reasons though... <br /><br />the first will be contamination unless you use bacteriostatic water. you will create a broth for bacteria to grow, and then it wont be healthy to shoot<br /><br />second, you cant just turn #3 into #4 because the base is generally always cut with caffeine, which you will not easily be able to remove. <br /><br />i am not sure of the solubility of H in other solvents but you could try to use alcohol and add the acid, then evaporate the alcohol away - though i dont know if that would work honestly.<br /><br />i think there is a reason the common practice is to add the acid while cooking in the spoon

				There is no simple way to convert #3 to #4 as far as I am aware.<br /><br />And as MM says above, it isn&#039;t recommended that you try mixing it all up in one liquid batch and storing it, the chances are too high it will become contaminated.<br /><br />Just add the citric when you mix it up.
