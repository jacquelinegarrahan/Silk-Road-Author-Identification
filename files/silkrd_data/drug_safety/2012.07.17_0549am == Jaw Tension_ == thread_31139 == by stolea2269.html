				Hey all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking for a solution to the horrible jaw tension I get whenever I roll/experiment with psychedelia (LSD is particularly bad). I&#039;ve tried taking magnesium (600mg) with little-no impact. It seems that I get worse tension than most other people... I&#039;m beginning to think that maybe I have TMJ or an actual problem with my jaw because I clench sometimes when I&#039;m not under the influence of anything. <br /><br />Anyways, if you have any tips for ways to deal with this annoyance, let me know :) <br /><br />Karma to anyone that helps!<br /><br />S

				Try wiki -&gt; bruxism -&gt; treatment.<br /><br />I have a bit of a hypothesis that says that anticonvulsant drugs might help, but that&#039;s not the sort of thing you just start taking out of the blue. I&#039;m on one and I think it helps, because as its dose has increased, so has my jawing decreased.<br /><br />Worse comes to worst, you just need to get more gum and roll less often :)

				I get that a lot... Need to really keep it in my mind and make sure I am being careful not to clench/grind too much. I haven&#039;t found a solution really..<br /><br />If it is very bad, you could try wearing a mouthguard while tripping?

				Magnesium supplements definitely reduce my jaw tension.&nbsp; Just beware, magnesium can also give you an upset stomach, so you might want to take a TUMS along with the magnesium.

				I don&#039;t know! For me, the only relief I get from jaw tension is chewing on like water bottles and stuff! I literally feel like a dog but it&#039;s so much fun!! Especially on the really tough plastic mouthpiece part of the water bottle!

				Coconut water has a lot of magnesium in it. I normally drink 2-4 cups instead of sports drinks to stay hydrated without sinking my electrolytes (alternating with water). <br /><br />I&#039;ll also take Chelated Calcium-Magnesium the morning of and a few hours before my roll. Make sure it&#039;s chelated as it absorbs faster and more efficiently. <br /><br />Gum is also nice.

				Yeah, I get this too, especially with LSD. Mushrooms luckily don&#039;t seem to have this issue. The only thing that I&#039;ve found to really help is a hit or two of pot. I hate adulterating the experience with pot, but the jaw tension and general tightness across the body (likely an effect of LSD&#039;s vasoconstricting properties) is worth it.

				the first few times tripping on LSD i had some jaw tension and in the neck back as well but just those first times, then never again so maybe you just need to trip more often&nbsp; ;)

				I had the same thing the one and only time I ever tried MDMA. It wasn&#039;t tension, but it was literally constant clenching to the point it was like my mouth was rattling. If I actively tried to concentrate on stopping it then I could, but obviously that ruins the high if you&#039;re made to sit there concentrating on your jaw movements instead of just generally feeling good.<br /><br />A tip I&#039;ve heard is if it gets real bad, put something soft like a washcloth inside of your mouth in order to not damage your teeth, as a practical solution.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also read about magnesium supplements being known to help, but I cannot comment personally.
