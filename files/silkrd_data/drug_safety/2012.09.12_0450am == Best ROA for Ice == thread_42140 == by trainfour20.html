				got some crystal and went to grab the ol&#039; glass dick, and it was busted... :( ... i have 3 or 4 of the glass rose stems, but they aren&#039;t the ones with the ball (oil burner).&nbsp; Was really hoping to smoke it, without waiting on a pipe delivery.&nbsp; and i&#039;d rather steer clear of tinfoil... id rather shoot it... <br /><br />thoughts?

				Eh if it is your first time I would do a small bump.&nbsp; or just smoke it off tin foil for now.<br /><br />Banging for the first time is a no no! IMO<br /><br />If you do smoke it off the foil, first wave the lit lighter under the foil to release the treatment chemicals off the foil.&nbsp;

				Yes foil is by far the best way to do it. you can load up one hit at a time. put a small crystal on the foil, light under it until it turns to liquid, than lightly vaporize it and slightly run it down the foil until it all vaporizes. me and my friends actually like to switch off even when we do have a meth pipe and take a couple hits from foil.

				I started off just taking small bumps of the stuff, and this is still my normal RoA. Quick and convenient, and no accessories to worry about. I just cut a little plastic coffee stirrer down to about an inch long, and clip the tip diagonally. This stays with the tiny baggie of powder and hides anywhere. If I were you, this is probably what I&#039;d do.<br /><br />I like mixing a little into whatever I&#039;m drinking, too, but you&#039;re probably looking for a bit more &quot;oomph.&quot;

				I&#039;ve only recently been trying out ice and I found an old vacuum flask that works great.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t know what it looks like, it&#039;s basically a normal flask, but with a glass pipe coming out near the top that is great to use as a handle and also as a carb.&nbsp; Since the bottom of the flask flares out, it catches the vapor so that you can get a decent huff.&nbsp; it sorta concentrates it.&nbsp; Also, the pyrex holds some heat so it keeps producing vapor, very easy and convenient.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also had a question for the expert tweakers out there...I find it strange that meth actually makes me feel calm.&nbsp; Is this weird at all?&nbsp; From all the media hype, I always imagined I would be going a mile a minute, but it makes me feel strangely calm but with some energy.&nbsp; Does that make sense?

				Anything less than IV is a total waste, but that&#039;s just my opinion.<br /><br />But did you know Rectal administration delivers 99% of the drug. Smoking is something like 70%. IV is 100% of course.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never done it myself, but if for some awful reason I couldn&#039;t get a needle, I&#039;d go that way. Why waste drugs?<br /><br />(ps: The way you do this is mix it up in a syringe with a few mls of water, lie on your left side, and squirt it up your ass (without the needle of course). Stay on your side for a few minutes and let it absorb. Voila.)

				Since you have the crack pipes you can hotrail. I love a hotrail that or booty bump, just did a booty bump for the first time the other day out of morbid curiosity and I was pleasantly surprised I was more spun for more time than ever before.

				Foil is fine if you know how to do it correctly. Do yourself a favor and research what a needle lighter is. If you don&#039;t have a syringe (to modify the lighter) then take a bic pen, take out the ink cartridge, cut off the last inch or so (where theres no ink)&gt; Your going to use this piece. Keep that. Take a piece of foil about 2 inches in length and smooth the hell out of it (between two lighters or something) . Wrap the foil around the ink cartridge as tight as possible then and it should fit onto the lighter perfectly. Oh ya this doesnt work for bic&#039;s. Use those cheap clear plastic lighters.

				@OP, my friend, depends on the gear. if you have smoked / railed it and felt a nice clean high.. then IV is ok but start with very little.. i personally IV, always use boiled or sterile bac water and filter it properly with q-tip cottons or even better a micron filter.<br />if your shit broke, you can easily order a meth pipe on (e)bay. search for &quot;oil burner&quot;, and you&#039;ll find exactly what you need. they ship worldwide too.<br /><br />@goldfibre1, yes good meth will give you a calm euphoria. some of the recent batches circulating on the road and even locally are too speedy which i personally don&#039;t like. i love the oldschool shit that renders that calming euphoria you&#039;re referring too. <br /><br />@trainfour, <br />1. place foil shiny side DOWN<br />2. place meth on foil <br />3. light up with a bic lighter on low flame<br />4. inhale with a regular straw or emptied out pen shell<br />5. enjoy<br />6. jerk off for at least 8-9 hours watching pay per minute gonzo porn<br /><br />hook up the good karma if i have helped you :]

				Was snorting mentioned? That would be my preferred ROA after IV. Smoking it in a pipe is fine, but I would check the pH of the meth before smoking it on foil. An acidic substance burnt on the foil causes a chemical reaction and harmful chemicals evaporate. The outcome of this is usually leukoencelophaty, which is a nasty, deadly disease. This is a case that&nbsp; occurs with heroin smokers, but it is very rare, because most of the #3 H sold is alkaline.

				Thanks for the info guys! Whats the best way to Hotrail with those pipes? you mean heat up one end then snort a line right? causing it to vaporize a bit, and blow out a big cloud of smoke?&nbsp; Is there a certain way to do it? i Just dont want to burn the hell out of the pipe and break it or something... though i have like 3 or 4 of them, unused.&nbsp; <br /><br />For IV, is it pretty much just like banging coke? i ALWAYS IV coke, and all i gotta do is throw it in a spoon with a little water...and suck up with a filter.&nbsp; Is Ice totally water soluble too?&nbsp; Just wondering if it has to be hot ( someone said boiling water), or if you just do that to kill bacteria.&nbsp; I get all my iv gear from a needle exchange, so i get the sealed waters, cookers, filters....all the necessary items :) .<br /><br />and also ive heard about using a lightbulb before, i forgot allll about that!! i will read the link soon, but does anyone have any first hand experience with using a bulb? just wondering if theres any rules or tricks of the trade i should know before attempting it!<br /><br />thanks everyone for the info +1&#039;s down the line :D .&nbsp; <br />trainfour20

				Ah, have been wondering this myself as well. I decided to get a little to see what it had to offer, but I&#039;m not sure how best to take it. I&#039;ve snorted it and that&#039;s ok, I hear it is more bioavailable that way than smoking (strangely) and I think I&#039;d agree...<br /><br />But then again, I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m smoking it correctly. I have a glass ball pipe, into which I put a tiny shard (about 20-25mg). Then I hold a lighter under it for a few seconds and it melts into a clear liquid and some vapor appears, which I inhale, hold for about 2-3 seconds, and then exhale. A few minutes later I get a bit of a rush but it&#039;s underwhelming. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve done it correctly... should I wait for the liquid to evaporate completely? I kept heat on a little just to see what it would do and it starts to turn black right before it disappears, and that frightens me.

				hello everyone,<br /><br />I have been enjoying Ice for a few months now so I&#039;m still pretty new to it.&nbsp; But here&#039;s what I&#039;ve learned so far...<br /><br />Fun facts - Methamphetamine HCl vaporizes at about 216 degrees Celsius under Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).&nbsp; A candle&#039;s flame burns around 1,400 degrees Celsius!&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to be too close to a candle&#039;s flame to reach 216 degrees.&nbsp; The inner part of a candle flame is already 800 degrees.&nbsp; The blue outer portion is 1,400 degrees.&nbsp; So, even a few inches above the flame is enough to vaporize tina.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using a pyrex flask to smoke ice.&nbsp; Before that, I used foil.&nbsp; I found that if you just use a flat piece of foil, you lose alot of the meth vapor that is produced, plus it was difficult to tell how far the flame was from it.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I fashioned a V-shaped piece of foil, then bowled out one end with either my thumb or a small round object like a shot glass.&nbsp; Start with a rectangular piece of foil about 4&quot;x7&quot;.&nbsp; Fold it over so you get a doubled piece of foil 2&quot;x7&quot;.&nbsp; Then fold over the last inch or so and open up the fold so that it forms something like a spoon.&nbsp; Like origami.&nbsp; I&#039;ll then stick my thumb in it to bowl it out.&nbsp; You can put a couple crystals of tina in this bowl.&nbsp; The long end of your foil is for the handle.&nbsp; Just like a spoon.<br /><br />Place bowl end about an inch or so away from the candle flame.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let it stay directly over the flame for more than a second or so.&nbsp; Keep going back and forth over the flame until you start getting the vapor.&nbsp; Then back away from it.&nbsp; It takes a little trial and error, but you get used to it.&nbsp; The first time I tried it, I set my tina on fire.&nbsp; It was way too close.&nbsp; Or else it&#039;ll just sizzle up and turn black.&nbsp; Remember, there&#039;s a 1,200 degree difference between the flame&#039;s temperature and what you need to vaporize tina.&nbsp; So go slow.&nbsp; <br /><br />You should try to make your piece of V-shaped foil with high sides to direct the vapor towards the straw you&#039;ll have in your mouth to suck up the vapor.&nbsp; The ice will run around, so try to hold it horizontally and not tilted down or up.&nbsp; Making a little finger sized indentation in the foil will help too.<br /><br />It is easier to light a candle, and then use the candle instead of your lighter.&nbsp; I use those little tea lights.&nbsp; Very cheap.&nbsp; Just light one up and place it on a table.&nbsp; Then you can wave your V-shaped foil with your ice in it over the flame.&nbsp; It&#039;s one less thing to do.<br /><br />&nbsp; So don&#039;t hold the foil or any other vessel in direct contact with the flame to avoid burning your tina.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hold my little pyrex flask about half an inch away and move it around while heating it.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see your tina turn clear like water.&nbsp; Then it will make a white vapor.&nbsp; Because I have a pyrex flask, I let the vapor build up in the flask before huffing it.&nbsp; I do this by either holding my thumb over the opening or using a rubber stopper.<br /><br />With a piece of foil, you&#039;ll need to be super careful to hold it at least an inch above the flame.&nbsp; Move it back and forth because it is very easy to burn the ice.&nbsp; It takes a little patience, but once you see when the tina turns into a clear liquid, then starts to vaporize, you need to back off.&nbsp; It will have enough heat to keep producing vapor and that&#039;s exactly what you want.&nbsp; You want to produce enough vapor to get a really good huff or else not enough will get into your bloodstream at the same time to give you a &quot;RUSH.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />If you make your little foil pocket deep enough, like even 2 or 3 inches, then enough vapor will collect there to huff all at once.&nbsp; Back off the flame a couple inches, then bring it closer, then back off again until you get the amount of vapor your want.&nbsp; It will look like when you are smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; A big cloud of vapor.&nbsp; Also. I fold over the end of my foil V shaped pocket at both ends so the tina doesn&#039;t come out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend getting an Ehrlenmeyer flask on ebay though.&nbsp; I use a 50ml one with vacuum attachment.&nbsp; I put a teflon 2 hole stopper in the top and then use a straw to suck out the vapor.&nbsp; I get really concentrated huffs this way.&nbsp; About a .1g will give you lots of vapor.&nbsp; I usu. use half that.&nbsp; But I&#039;m a lightweight.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not too sure about the light bulb thing.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t the glass coated with something toxic?&nbsp; Not sure about that, but I will do some research and update.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />p.l.u.r.,<br />G<br /><br />p.s. - sorry if the post was rambling, I went back through and added some details here and there.&nbsp; You get the idea.

Plus for some reason smoking it always made me feel &quot;dirty&quot;, maybe a regional thing but there seemed to be a stigma around smoking it (you would think IV would have the stigma but that and snorting were regarded as the &quot;respectable&quot; ways, go figure).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />thanks for asking about the toxicity.&nbsp; I did a little research and found out that the coating on the inside of incandescent bulbs is made from a natural mineral called kaolin.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically an aluminum silicon oxide that is also used in ceramics, toothpaste, and cosmetics.&nbsp; In certain countries, people also eat it!<br /><br />As a side note, I&#039;d just like to add that smoking it from a flask using the stopper I mentioned earlier is quite efficient.&nbsp; Very little of the vapor is lost and if you do it methodically, even the vapor that is not immediately inhaled, condenses on the inside of the flask which can then be reheated and inhaled.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the same can be done with the bulb method, but a suitable stopper should be fashioned.&nbsp; Waste not, want not, that&#039;s what I always say.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen people do it off foil and half the vapor just floats away.<br /><br />thanks everyone, G
