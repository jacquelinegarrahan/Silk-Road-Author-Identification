				Look into vaporizing, no smoke (only vapor) and WAYYY better on your lungs than smoking!<br /><br />I recommend the Extreme Q Vaporizer for beginners, its not too expensive gets the job done (fantastically if i may add)

				There must still be tiny particles with a vaporizer and I&#039;ve heard of the damage small particulates from vehicle exhausts can do.&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer an oral method - also less likely to get caught out by wife!<br /><br />Been reading around a bit and it sounds like it needs to be heated gently to activate it.&nbsp; Thinking of heating it in a slow cooker and then using caps.<br /><br />Comments welcome.

				Smoking a cigarette after vaping will definitely hide the smell. When vaping correctly there is almost no smell at all. When I vape it gets slightly smelly (nowhere near smoking a bowl) but that&#039;s because I like to gently toast my bud to make sure I got it all. ;) <br /><br />Skyhigh22, parachuting a hit is going to be just as harmful as smoking it. You did light your bud with a flame to get the bag filled...

				I think Skyhigh22 means he is going to wrap it in some paper and swallow it as in parachuting some powder. If this is the case it won&#039;t work.&nbsp; Eating bud or hash raw is extremely inefficient and a waste of product as your gastro-intestinal system is not very good at extracting THC from solid material.<br /><br />Also bud/hash does not need to be &#039;activated&#039;, this is a total myth, a popular myth, but a myth just the same. THC can be extracted from raw material by heating, but the raw material needs to be heated in combination with a high fat content substance. Most commonly butter is used. This heating process extracts the THC from the bud/hash and transfers it into the butter. The butter can then be used in any recipe that normally uses butter but the resulting product will get you high. <br /><br />An alternative way to extract the THC without heating is to soak bud/hash in high proof alcohol, but it needs to soak for a few weeks at least. The resulting liquid a.k.a &#039;Green Dragon&#039; will be quite potent and needs to be drunk in moderation.<br /><br />EROWID has some good recipes - http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_faq_eat.shtml<br />

				Vaporizers are a good option.<br /><br />As stated above edibles are also very good but the high is different, it lasts much longer. The advantage is you can put it in pretty much anything that uses a good amount of butter, like brownies, cookies, etc.

				Yeah, personally I vaporize (magic flight launch box FTW).&nbsp; Edibles are fun but cooking bud can stink your kitchen out, and the smell seems to linger for ages.<br /><br />With vaporizing the smell is almost non-existent and even if you do vape long enough to toast your bud it doesn&#039;t smell the same as if you were smoking it, more like a toasty, popcorny smell.&nbsp; Plus the smell doesn&#039;t last long and doesn&#039;t travel.&nbsp;

				If you want an easy edible that can be made individually, check out firecrackers (google &#039;firecracker recipe weed&#039; or somethin)<br />Basically 2 crackers and some peanut butter/nutella with 2-4 bowls worth of weed mixed in<br />Wrap in foil, bake for 15min at 320F or so.<br /><br />Nice cause you dont have to make a whole batch of butter/oil, and they&#039;re quick.<br /><br /><br />As for vapes, the iolite vape changed my life. vape in the car, at work, in a bar, fuckin beautiful. Vaped a few weeks at my folks house and they had no clue (I asked them afterword lol). Definitely more &#039;popcorn-y&#039;. Nothing beats a volcano or verdamper though (if you&#039;re ever in amsterdam, go to Any Day coffeeshop and get annihilated vaping hash in a verdamper.<br /><br />Wow i got off topic. Wonder why? :P

				Agree with vaping. I have a glass eagle bill vaporizer which works fairly well; there is no recognizable smell. It does pretty much smell like popcorn. It is more like steam than smoke so you can do it inside (I can&#039;t smoke in the house either, but vaping is fine) and the overall smell is very minimal. You don&#039;t get any weed smell on your breath.<br />I also have a &#039;VP-600 Pocket-Vapor&#039;, which probably works a bit better than the glass pipe and has a lot better control. It is a bit more expensive, but doesn&#039;t have the disadvantage of being occasionally mistaken for a crack pipe...<br /><br />One thing about vaping, you will find that the high is more in your head than your body and it will take a bit longer to get high (compared to a bong), it may also be difficult to get ridiculously high since it is fairly mild.<br /><br />If you are going to cook it, don&#039;t do it in your house.. Smell will be very strong.<br /><br /><br />One alternate idea might be to make green dragon. You need alcohol at least 60% or so to make it extract the weed, chop it up really fine and add it to the alcohol. Seal it up and shake every day for a couple of weeks. A good indicator that the THC is being extracted is the plant starts to sink rather than floating. If you can microwave the stuff for 30 seconds first before adding it, it works better, but of course that leaves a little bit of smell in the microwave. It goes away, but its there.

I think because it&#039;s a stronger head high and lower body high it&#039;s easier to notice how freakin high you are!<br /><br />If you&#039;re not getting very high from vaping I&#039;d suggest grinding the bud finer before vaping it. This made a big difference in the effectiveness for me when I first started vaping and now spend a little extra time getting a good fine ground beforehand.

				so i had an idea after reading about firecrackers. i like the premise of this food, it&#039;s easy to make, and sounds relatively non-disgusting. however, there are a couple drawbacks.<br /><br />food storage, handling (they sound messy), and cooking odors (they say its minimal, but i need a method that is stealth).<br /><br />so i thought what if you were to put the veg. oil/pnut butter/cannabis mix in a small canning jar, and then boiled the canning jar for an hour or two.<br /><br />i&#039;m assuming the heat will release the thc/boids without busting the jar (canning jars are supposed to be boiled). this also is an odorless method since the material is locked inside an airtight container under water, and it&#039;s pretty easy to spread some peanut butter on a cracker or toast. it&#039;s also relatively easy to store and keep stashed (whereas food will attract rodents).<br /><br />any thoughts from the more experience cannabis cooks?<br /><br />edit:: i went ahead and started a test batch. 0.283g of high grade cannabis finely chopped in a mixture of 2 parts pnut butter, 1 part veg oil (1tbs=part). I mixed them together, and put them into a 1oz. canning jar, sealed the lid, and placed into a pan of boiling hot water.<br /><br />i will let the jar boil for at least 30 more minutes, place in the fridge for an hour and then try the entire contents of the jar on a piece of wheat toast.<br /><br />i&#039;ll post a report later this evening.

				+0:00 - Ingested the majority of 3tbsp of the peanut oil .283g cannabis mixture. I used a rice cake to help sop it up since it was thin and watery. It tasted pretty gross, salty, and very much like any other cannabis food but without any sugar. I noticed that quite a bit of material wound up in the deep corner so if I make this stuff again I&#039;ll be sure to take it out mid-boil and give it a good stir.<br /><br />+1:00 - Not really feeling any effects, I became impatient and decided I would step outside to take a hit or two off the chillum. I stood up and felt kind of dizzy so I decided on just taking one hit. I was feeling a little nauseous up to this point but the puff seemed to help calm my stomach down. I&#039;m a very healthy person and my normal diet is very limited to vegetables, fish, rice, etc. I&#039;m sure my stomach was pretty pissed about the amount of fat I just ingested.<br /><br />+1:30 - Definitely feeling more than what a single puff of ganja would produce. Light swimmy head change, I can feel the stoneyness in my face and chest. I noticed a slight tightness in my chest as well, and a raise in BP/Pulse. It wasn&#039;t anything alarming so I didn&#039;t bother taking any vitals.<br /><br />+2:00 - Music is enhanced and I&#039;m getting slight visual patterning. I felt very calm and peaceful, I usually listen to high-tempo dubstep/dnb but I opted for Lush on SomaFM. My brother called me and wanted to play some BF3 and I&#039;m not sure but I don&#039;t think I sucked as bad as I usually do. +1<br /><br />+4:00 - Starting to feel sleepy and lethargic. I would have to call this experiment a success. I laid down and almost immediately fell into a deep sleep.<br /><br />+12:00 - Woke up refreshed and content. I don&#039;t think I moved at all. I was dehydrated (like usual) so I immediately chugged a litre of water and took a shower.<br /><br />Summary: It worked, going to try a headier dose next week, maybe bump up to .5g

				Great experiment and report, thanks for sharing!<br /><br />In my experience vegetable oil is not very effective, I&#039;d leave it out or replace with butter (not margarine), it&#039;s probably adding a lot to the gross factor too.
