				I&#039;ve read a few publications here and there claiming that derivatives of the Iboga root can drastically help in recovering from opiate addiction. I have a close friend who has struggled with opiates for years and has taken psychedelics with me in the past. I briefly discussed it with him and he said he might be interested. Does anyone have any first hand experience with it? I know its supposed to be a rough trip but will leave you feeling &quot;cleansed&quot; supposedly. If my friend does decide to take this journey, should i take it with him? or just sit for him. Any first-hand info anyone can provide is valued thank you.

				It&#039;s not a push-button process.<br /><br />The person has to be willing to seriously confront and reorganize their identity.<br /><br />Experience in psychedelics and the availability of a shaman or other experienced psychonaut is preferred.<br /><br />That said, I plan on taking ibogaine for the first time in October (so don&#039;t listen to me).

				I&#039;m curious to hear the experience report if he goes through with it. I&#039;m not sure why ibogaine is used widely for this and not other psychedelics. The only thing I can think of is that it is a kappa opiate receptor agonist... So is salvia.

				Honestly I wouldn&#039;t touch Iboga (or any other psychedelic) as a potential opiate &#039;cure&#039;. They scare the shit out of me. <br /><br />The problem that I see with Ibogain treatment is that it depends on someone really wanting to quit to be effective. If you have that deeply imbedded desire, then I guess there&#039;s a decent number of people who ride the trip and come out the other end even stronger committed to quitting and without DTs. <br /><br />That said, I am kinda skeptical about how effective Ibogain can be. Three days of ball-tripping hallucinations sounds a lot worse than a tapered detox to me. Perhaps its preferable to methadone or suboxone, because god knows I&#039;ve heard terrible things about those detoxes. But compared to tapering with morphine it seems worse.<br /><br />If the science guys can separate out the psychedelic effects from the withdrawl-canceling stuff, then we&#039;ll really be on to something. The ideal has to be quitting without DTs or hallucinating.

				ibogaine has had excellent results in the treatment of opiate addiction. but a warning: it can be very dangerous. one of the few known psychedelics that can actually be fatal. it should only be taken under the supervision of someone with a medical background, who can monitor vital signs. that being said, there are safer alternatives that have the potential to help with addiction. i&#039;d suggest a good dose of psilocybin mushrooms, or an ayahuasca brew. some of the strongest plant medicine and much safer than ibogaine.

				Thanks for all the replies guys. I think hes seriously considering it as he frustrated with all the attempts to quit he&#039;s had in the past. Our group of friends is just recently introducing him to the spectrum of psychedelics, and we&#039;ve seen a small but significant change in him. If he does decide to go through with it, ill promptly post the report here so the community has a little more of an idea of what the experience and effects of this wonderful plant are. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be safe,<br /><br />Shifty

				I believe LSD and 2C-B helped cure me of my Heroin addiction. I used for over 3 years before trying to go straight. I ended up relapsing every other month until I ended up in rehab. Still relapsing into the habit.<br />Then I began using LSD and 2C-B in what I considered where thereputic places and responsible doses. After a few sessions, I broke down and went back to shooting dope. But this time... I was sick after my first shot, threw up for hours, and I could tell my opiate receptors had returned to normal. My brain was reset in a way. I had no pleasure at all from the dope. I don&#039;t even browse the opiod section of SR anymore. Not even just to look. I have no interest.<br />This is a therepy that works. But you must want it to work at the same time. You should help your friend. I suggest LSD or something similar. Maybe Mescaline or 2C-B.

				Sickboy did the shot that make you sick get you high? Was it euphoric or dysphoric? Did it seem like a small overdose or is it possible that you just coincedentally had H with a bad cut or used unsanitary tools? Just curious. So, no cravings afterwards? Not one? Sorry for the barrage of questions I&#039;m just curious. I&#039;m a heroin and poppy pod user myself... Thing is, I don&#039;t want to quit... But again, just curious about your experience.

It sounds much more manageable than Ibogaine, and it may truly help my friend.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try 2C-B now before ibogaine and see if he likes the effects. I can&#039;t thank you enough for your insight and that of everyone else in this thread as I just want to see my friend&#039;s condition improve. Thank you all.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shifty

It was more dysphoric for sure, I just wanted it to end if you can even believe that. And no, I really don&#039;t crave it anymore. I think about the needle sometimes and I&#039;m sure I always will, but I really don&#039;t miss doing dope at all.
