				So I snorted heroin for the second time last night.&nbsp; I may have slightly overdosed, I puked (very gently) once and I can&#039;t remember much after that, I guess i just went to sleep.<br /><br />All today I had/have a massive headache and slept most of the day...<br /><br /><br />Is this something to expect after using? Is this an isolated incident?

				You must have definitely done too much.&nbsp; You probably blacked out and then passed out if you don&#039;t even remember what happened.&nbsp; Did you wake up on your bed?<br /><br />You probably have a headache because you&#039;re dehydrated from puking or just simply by doing too much like already mentioned.<br /><br />Don&#039;t snort more than .1 if you are new to dope.

				Headaches are not a common &#039;hangover&#039; for using Heroin. Like the above poster said, it&#039;s probably due to dehydration.

				It was much less than .1 my friend.... probly in between .10-.50 MAX. I dont have a scale to weigh the dope properly.. but it was not an amazingly heavy hit... I puked only 4 heaves very small amounts. I believe last night and today i was hydrated properly.<br /><br />After a day of sleep my headache is gone, but should I expect this to ever happen if i keep my doses friendly?&nbsp;

				Also any ways to clearly decipher between a nice dose and too much? the line seemed fairly thin in my 2 experiences.

				Because the strength of H can vary a lot and your tolerance (or lack of one) also plays a part, there are no real guidelines. Just start off small (like you did) wait 15+ mins before doing any more. Try to get an idea how strong it is. Unlike coke or some other drugs you don&#039;t have to get the amount right first time to get the best rush. You can build up by re-dosing until you feel as high as your comfortable with. Just don&#039;t rush it and overdose, the full effects can take up to half an hour to come on and then several hours to wear off. Like I said before, the strength can vary a lot. Some good H and 0.05g could get you really high (for someone who&#039;s new to it), but if it&#039;s crap H then you my need ten times that amount! Please take it slow though and you shouldn&#039;t do it on your own in case you do get into trouble and need help.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t think you should ever get a headache from snorting H, unless it&#039;s cut with something bad. It&#039;s a painkiller.<br /><br />Have fun, be safe. :)

				Yeah thanks for the post, I&#039;ve no friends that could sit for me.&nbsp; Never had any of the rest of my long list of drugs I&#039;ve had experiences with either though.<br /><br />If I&#039;m not nodding at all after 20 minutes, is it safe to assume I can dose another very small hit?&nbsp; Or should I wait another 20 minutes.

				You get dehydrated faster when your body is sick.&nbsp; You were obviously very sick from the dope and may even had the night sweats while you were passed out.<br /><br />It is either dehydration or something in the dope.&nbsp; Unless you woke up on the ground and hit your head on something.
