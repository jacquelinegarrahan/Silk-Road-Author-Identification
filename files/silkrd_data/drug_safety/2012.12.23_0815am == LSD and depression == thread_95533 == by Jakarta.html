				Hi, sorry if this question has been asked (I searched in the forums) but I was wondering what the risks are if you take LSD and have depression? I highly doubt I&#039;m predisposed to schizophrenia but could it possibly increase the risk of a bad trip? Btw I take Prozac and I&#039;m going to stop it a week or so before the trip (it&#039;s not working very well anyway).&nbsp;

				I would be very careful. LSD is like busting the door open to the subconscious. If you are not currently in a good condition mentally what comes out could be seriously unpleasant.<br /><br />If you decide to go along anyway ensure you are in a safe pleasant environment preferably with an experienced tripsitter and go with a relatively low dose first time like 100-125ug.<br /><br /><br />

				What busta said.<br /><br />But also it could help you if you went in it with the right mind state. It opens many thoughts, good &amp; bad, some can be used positively toward your life, others negatively. If you are second doubting it, then don&#039;t do it at all until you know you are ready. LSD is a powerful drug and if you are not ready going into it, then it can be a bad experience.

				I was in a reasonably positive mind frame when I did it although I kind of did it cos I was a bit bored that day so thought sod it I&#039;ll do some LSD. I found the strongest part of the trip was very happy and invoked positive thoughts and interesting ideas mainly because everything around me was breathing haha, but towards the end it got a little bit more negative particuarly because I couldnt sleep.

Sometimes acid tends to linger longer than some like. I would also like to mention that you should never ingest a substance because you&#039;re bored and it&#039;s something to pass the time. This is especially true when it comes to acid. <br /><br />I have personally seen someone suffer from depression after using acid for several months. He couldn&#039;t shake it and tried many substances and at one point was prescribed an SSRI. He eventually gave up on the SSRI since it was making him suicidal. A few weeks ago he tripped again off acid. He told me that his depression has improved. It isn&#039;t completely gone, but he&#039;s a lot better than what he was. He smiles more, laughs more, and it&#039;s really wonderful to see a substance help someone so tremendously.<br /><br />I would look deeper into your life and ask yourself if it&#039;s some life issue that is causing the depression. The acid may of brought it out more, or brought it to your attention. I hope you get feeling better and i personally like benzoids for the comedown of acid if i need to get to sleep. Personally, i love to ride the trip all the way out if I&#039;m not required to sleep for some reason.

				Maybe this thread is a help to you: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40100.0<br />and/or this one: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=78342.0 <br />These threads are about one person&#039;s journey how LSD helped him heal from childhood pain and move on in a positive way.<br /><br /><br />I am very grateful that I gained insight and healing from LSD. I strongly recommend to have a sitter who you trust and feel loved and respected by. Because LSD can get you into a thought/feeling loop and it can be very scary and dark, can trigger suicidal thoughts and behaviour. I know somebody who almost killed himself, but his mom sat with him all night and kept him from doing that.

				This is the OP. I lost my password, so I had to create a new account&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Well I haven&#039;t tried it yet (won&#039;t get the chance for a couple months), but just wanted to thank everyone for their input. I think I will try it, in a safe environment (I was thinking a garden). Sadly I won&#039;t be able to use a trip sitter. Nobody knows what I&#039;m doing, and I don&#039;t plan on them knowing either.&nbsp; :-X <br /><br />I&#039;ll update and tell you how it went when it happens. :)

				When I&#039;m feeling blue, I like to trip alone and put on some good, positive, uplifting music. Helps me when I&#039;m tripping stay positive and keep my head on straight and identify what I&#039;d like to change about myself. Through tripping, I realized that most of depression and suicidal thoughts came from past experiences that were plaguing my mind and keeping me from enjoying the present or thinking about my future. <br />Hope you can find happy place through tripping like I did. :) good luck my friend

				Hey Crack Fox I love your username!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I actually have a question for you regarding that- is it good to watch Boosh while tripping or a bad idea? (I guess it could spin you out)<br /><br />Another thing I wanted to say before but forgot- my sleeping habits are so fucked that I doubt LSD would make any noticeable difference anyway.

				OP:<br />wouldnt advise taking LSD whilst feeling especially down or depressed<br />not saying never take it if you regularly feel depressed or have a history of it nor often feel suicidal<br />thoughts and feelings exaggerate, very small issues or problems grow and quickly get the better of you if you let them etc etc, is why wouldnt recommend mixing stress/especially depressive state/mood with LSD and expect it to be alright (like drowning your sorrows with alcohol)<br />LSD can however help self healing if you are open to helping yourself and being honest with yourself.<br />also rather give yourself longer rest getting off prozac to taking LSD <br />no point in harming yourself or making matters worse.<br /><br />Peace<br />

				Maybe shrooms are a better option to start with. It is more gentle than LSD and it can give you an idea how you react to psychedelics.

				I&#039;m not thinking of self-medicating (not with LSD, anyway). I just always wanted to try a hallucinogen- I love the idea of them- and my medication from the doctor doesn&#039;t work very well, nor have the last 2, so I don&#039;t really see any harm in stopping it for a little while and just giving it a go, for experience. I have been suicidal in the past but for people who have and survived it, there&#039;s a 80-90% chance that they won&#039;t try again, because they know that the feelings pass. So I think I MAY be able to suck it up on a bad trip, but also I am not feeling particularly terrible right now. Although that could just be because I&#039;ve come on here and feel a bit excited to try some new things. I don&#039;t have an addictive personality, at least when it comes to pot, smoking, and drinking. I would hate it if my depression held me back from trying new things, even if that thing was a drug.&nbsp; :P I want to experience every emotion and feeling I possibly can. Plus I&#039;m a writer, and the inspiration would be amazing. I plan to record myself talking while on it, although it could just be nonsense it&#039;ll give me a laugh anyway&nbsp; ;)

				A small dose of ketamine will do the job on depression. Take about 20 mg and it kicks in after a few hours and lasts for days.

				I found ketamine made me very depressed the day after using it (in large amounts)....<br /><br />Anyway shortly after I started taking LSD years ago I decided to stop taking Prozac for a number of reasons. I would just like to say that quitting it cold turkey can be an absolute catastrophe (especially if you&#039;ve gone on and off of it before). It can take up to three months to start losing your mind and it really sucks ass. If you really want to quit you should wean off of it over a period of time that depends on how long you&#039;ve been taking it. For example it took me two years of gradual dose reductions after taking it on and off for four years. I used a powder scale and empty capsules...<br /><br />As far as LSD and depression, if you feel okay the day you take it you should be fine, and it can in fact be very beneficial. Just don&#039;t take it if you&#039;re depressed at the time. Also something interesting is that Prozac is supposed to render LSD almost completely impotent, but when I first starting using it, it was perfectly capable of doing its thing.

				you should be fine as long as your in a good place when you take it. if you have something on your mind that&#039;s making you depressed at that time.. then don&#039;t, because your gonna be trapped thinking and looking into it for your whole trip.<br /><br />just make sure your in a good state of mind, relaxed, energized, full stomach, and free to do whatever you want<br /><br />good luck

				I tripped myself out of a depression, <br />but it was a very painfull and long proces...<br />something that mostly will go wrong - I&#039;m one of the &quot;lucky ones&quot; that didn&#039;t get crazy,<br />but I lost some friends due to it.<br /><br />LSD has been used to cure depression (with good results!), but that demands lots of preparation, <br />good environment, good coaching, the help of the spirits (yes!) and some luck...<br /><br />if you&#039;re in a depression I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, <br />but as I already wrote: I tripped myself out of a 3 year long depresion.
