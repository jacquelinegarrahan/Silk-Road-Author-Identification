				I just recieved some pure Diazepam powder. I tried some oraly and I can&#039;t really say that is as strong as Roche or other domestic generics. Maybe about 85-90 percent strength at most, but I&#039;m judging completely subjectively, YMMV. <br />Anyway, does anyone have experience disolving pure Diazepam and IV&#039;ing? Or maybe rectal or insufflation?<br />I know it doesn&#039;t disolve in water, so any tips would be appreciated. Thanx!

				Sort of related I have been thinking of using xanax or valium powder and making blotters, after I saw kwikitrips do xanax blotters. If anyone has any sources for doing this type of thing I would like to check it out. <br />

				I&#039;m not too sure about blotters, but you can dissolve diazepam or alprazolam reasonably well in ethanol. You could use the resulting solution to make blotters, but also to pipet out smaller doses for future use. <br /><br />For diazempam you can probably weigh 10 mg doses with a good balance, but if you want to divide up 100 mg of alprazolam into 1 mg doses, dissolving it may be a better solution. You could, for example, dissolve 100 mg alprazolam in 1 ml of ethanol, and then pipet 10 uL aliquots onto a sugar cube each. <br /><br />Obviously sugar cubes aren&#039;t any good for further distribution, but for personal use they can make a very convenient medium as they absorb liquid well and can be kept in a dry place for a very long time once prepared.

				Probably best with volumetric dosing, dissolve in water or alcohol and dose by the mL. 10mg is the average dose, you don&#039;t want to put that on blotter.&nbsp; You can blow lines but insuffilation won&#039;t make it hit much harder, only faster.&nbsp; if you dissolve it, it&#039;d be easy to boof.

				I used to be able to get ampoules of diazepam whenever I wanted them, and IV hurt. You have to inject it very slowly... slower than is practical for a syringe. I used to just put in a cannula and inject through that, but even that at a rate of 1ml/minute was uncomfortable, and tended to make my veins harden and shrink.

				The United States Pharmacopoeia lists diazepam as soluble 1 in 16 ethyl alcohol, 1 in 2 of chloroform, 1 in 39 ether, and practically insoluble in water. So your best bet for IV usage is everclear at a ratio of 15mg per ml.

				Why would you want to inject diazepam?<br /><br />It is very readily absorbed from the intestines, on an empty stomach most of it would be absorbed in 15 minutes or so. Even if you can only get injectible fluid and not tablets, i would suggest simply drinking the contents of the vial. It has an unpleasant taste for sure, but i&#039;d prefer that over the hassle and risk of injection any day.
