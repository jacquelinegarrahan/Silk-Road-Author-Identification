				We&#039;ve all heard stories about people taking LSD once and never returning to a mental baseline. From what I&#039;ve read online so far, these types of cases occur as a result of LSD&#039;s ability to precipitate and amplify underlying mental disorders. I&#039;ve talked to various friends about the matter and it seems as though everyone has a story of someone who has permanently fucked up their brain as a result of taking acid. When I hear these types of stories, two questions always come to mind: (1) was the LSD actually LSD, and (2) did the person have some type of underlying or existing mental disorder?<br /><br />I consider myself a somewhat normal, laid back person. I&#039;m able to carry on intelligent conversations and can generally see humor in every life situation. I do, however, have a bit of underlying depression. If someone like me were to ingest some quality LSD from a reputable seller on this site, what are the chances of permanently fucking up my personality? Are we talking 1:50 odds or more like 1:10,000 odds?

				I don&#039;t know about Insane, I will say for me both LSD and MDMA have permanently changed me (in a good way) I rate taking LSD and MDMA as 2 of the most memorable and life changing experiences of my life. Only 2nd to the day my little girl was born. I have never heard of anyone taking 1 hit and going permanently insane. Some of the coolest most intelligent people I know have taken LOTS of acid.

				Yeah, LSD can make you insane if you take it on a daily basis (like 10 hits a week) but you will go back to baseline eventually. I had a friend who took massive amounts of LSD and it took him a semester to recover. I have another &quot;friend&quot; who is pretty much insane but that is probably more from meth than LSD, hah. <br /><br />Basically, your not going to fuck up your brain unless you hardcore abuse LSD. Which is just retarded. Still doing a 5 times dose of LSD is less likely to fuck you up than a 5 times dose of MDMA :D<br /><br />No you will not fuck yourself up from taking a trip if that is what you are asking.

				When I was younger I had a friend who, like me, really enjoyed doing acid.&nbsp; Hell, most of our friends were doing it.&nbsp; This was back in the 70&#039;s when I truly believe the best acid was around.&nbsp; I have many great memory&#039;s of going to outdoor concerts in the middle of the summer, high on acid.&nbsp; Great times.<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t seen him in awhile, he had gone up north for a couple of months, and I decided to drop by his place.&nbsp; When I got there his parents told me he was in his bedroom and had been for several days, with the lights turned off.&nbsp; He had gone to a concert, done some acid, then came home.&nbsp; His parents found him on the front lawn without any clothes on, in the middle of the night.<br /><br />He ended up having to go in to the pysch ward at some point.&nbsp; While the acid may not have been the main cause of his problems, it certainly set off whatever underlying problem he had.<br /><br />Syd Barret (Pink Floyd) is probably one of the best known people who were seriously changed by LSD.<br /><br />So, yes, I do believe extended use of LSD can make serious changes to a persons overall personality and physic makeup.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand, I think it is probably only a small percentage of those people who do LSD that are so effected.

				short-term, you could be considered &quot;insane&quot; because tripping does activate some schizophrenic receptors.<br />Though, long-term, you only have a real risk if you have underlying issues, look at your hereditory genes.<br /><br />The general population is fine.<br />LSD has made some people have a psychotic break, most come back, some don&#039;t.<br />Be healthy, get a good nights sleep every day, you should all be fine.

				It&#039;s hard to say for sure, I mean it&#039;s really all up to who you are and how your mind works isn&#039;t it? Just make sure you have a solid grip on reality. Being mad isn&#039;t all that bad though, hell...it&#039;s practically a lifestyle to some. Tim Burton for example. :D

				He&#039;s doing fine now.&nbsp; This was over 30 years ago (god I feel old :) ), the only RC&#039;s at that time were LSD, MDMA, Mescalyn and shrooms.&nbsp; $25 use to buy me a sheet of 25 blotters (Hotel, Poppy, Window Payne ...).&nbsp; I still remember the first time I did purple microdot, it was an amazing trip.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done acid in years.&nbsp; I actually purchased some on SR about 7 months ago, only to have it never show up and the vendor saying it was nabbed by a postal employee.&nbsp; That was my only refund on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was thinking about giving it another try, but I&#039;ve been reading all this stuff about people selling LSD that isn&#039;t really LSD, but some other RC, and I&#039;d rather not take the chance.

				Growing up, there was a guy in the neighborhood who used to dose very frequently for a long time (couple years) and ended up having a mental breakdown of some kind where he swore everyone was the devil.&nbsp; I did not see that part but I did see the charred remnants of the Led Zeppelin bootlegs he sprayed with lighter fluid and put a match to. I believe that in itself to be an act of insanity as some if not all of them were originals. :(<br />Never saw him after that and don&#039;t know if he improved or not.

				There&#039;s an urban legend floating around my living area saying that you should only take LSD once every two or three months, because it fries your brain. Meh. When i first heard that (before first taking LSD, and being very eager to try it) i did some research on the internet...bottom line being that even with long term daily abuse it is highly unlikely you&#039;ll get fucked up. Unless you already have hidden mental issues. <br />I do have an acquaintance that went to a festival and abused LSD non-stop for three days then went straight to the looney bin, but he&#039;s a hardcore junkie, that was bound to happen sooner or later.<br /><br />Anyway, if taken recreationally (weekend warrior style), it shouldn&#039;t endanger your mental health. Shit, acid and mdma changed the way i see and treat people, the way i listen to music, the way i act around socially and in general the way i see my life. All this in a good way.

				Main issue is what &#039;insane&#039; actually means.&nbsp; If it means a mental disorder under DSM-4, maybe. Under DSM-5 being a bit eccentric is enough to qualify for mental illness, so for sure!<br /><br />As an illegal drug in the US, real data is few and far between. A single dose would not be that likely to cause you to walk in front of a train happily waving your arms into the air. <br /><br />I&#039;d foremost suggest having a friend present if you experiment with hallucinogens - at least you have someone there to inhibit you when you want to go out and do something crazily stupid.

				LSD can exasperate conditions like depression or schizophrenia which is exactly the reason why they suggest you be in a healthy, strong-minded headspace before tripping.

				LSD can trigger psychosis and schizophrenia in people who are predisposed. It does not cause either, but it can lower the age of onset in people who would almost certainly develop the conditions eventually anyway. I have used a lot of LSD over the past five years, probably around 400 hits, and I am not insane. Although sometimes after particularly heavy use I do get kind of out there ;P.

				I used to high dose LSD trip ritually at least every 12 days eating at least 500mcg but the majority being over 800mcg.&nbsp; I think it very much depends on the person and whether they even have real LSD or not.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine eating DOB often.&nbsp; Anyway I won&#039;t say people that abuse L don&#039;t exist cause they are obviously out there but I wish those that are prone to addiction deep at that level would use Lsd to reconfigure themselves.&nbsp; That being said L still has the potential to schizoid people but really its all in your head...

				I have done hundreds of trips over the years and have seen some very bad things. <br /><br />Something that has the power to show you this amount of insight and love and the balance of the world, can certainly cause the opposite of this.

				NO. It is a very safe drug. <br /><br />It could open doors into yourself that might eventually lead to insanity. <br /><br />But more likely you will learn things about your perception, cognition, and personality. This is good for us in the long-term.<br /><br />The substance itself causing insanity? No way.<br /><br />However eating any drug like m&amp;m&#039;s will certainly change your brain chemistry, possibly permanently (classic example: BENZO&#039;S).

				I think the key is understanding your situation. LSD will change you, I don&#039;t believe there is any argument there. It is another experience that you have experienced, which will affect you. It is also unlike everyday experiences, which will also affect you. You will think differently and part of you may hold onto a part of that.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen any &#039;major&#039; changes in someone&#039;s psyche as a result of a dose they were comfortable with. On a single dose, I completely doubt that they will have any permanent effects. To the guy mentioned who ate a sheet of cid instead of getting caught with it, that&#039;s a risk it seems like he weighed out beforehand. I think we all know that taking such a massive dose could have repercussions, especially in the presence of authority and the risk of years of your life in prison. Personally, I work my up to heroic doses to try and avoid those sorts of mishaps

				You will go insane if you have schyzophrenia latent pathology! <br /><br />LSD definitly open doors... it is a very strong psychedelic, if you are on a weak mind when you take it, you can go insane i believe. I mean you are feeling completly out of this world for days/weeks maybe months for some people.<br /><br />You should be STRONG in your mind when you take LSD! You should have a lot of energy in you without any drugs. You have to be pretty sure of you. I mean feeling very confortable in you. MIND and BODY.<br /><br />If all is good, you won&#039;t go insane under 200/250 ug.<br /><br />You should know that a strong dose make you think a lot, i mean very profound thoughts. This is difficult to describe when you haven&#039;t try it once. But this part of the trip (the thoughts) are the most dangerous side of the LSD i feel. Very interesting but you should be very strong in your mind sometimes such the thoughts go very far away in your mind.

Those effects vary significantly from drug to drug.<br /><br />At their core, all drugs are &quot;natural,&quot; because we make drugs by taking something that has been laying around, and experimenting with it. Extracting stuff, mixing it with other stuff, until it becomes something different and unique. I don&#039;t think drugs that occur in nature are necessarily predisposed to being &quot;safer&quot; than drugs we figured out how to make. I think it just depends on the drug. It may be the case that all the drugs we have discovered in nature are safer as of right now, but suppose evolution had gone differently? That might not be the case.

				Short answer...<br /><br />Possibly, but very unlikely<br /><br />What&#039;s more likely is that you&#039;ll start realising bad things about yourself, feel terrible and afraid for a few hours and then wake up normal.<br /><br />That&#039;s still unlikely, but much more probable than actually going insane

In fact, of all drugs LSD is the one that makes me feel like I&#039;ve changed my state of consciousness without really involving my body. It flows through my thought and perception like liquid energy while shrooms tend to take an initial toll on my stomach (nausea) and sometimes make me feel dizzy and physically disoriented if I move into a smaller space than I initiated the trip in (such as going into the bathroom from outside).<br /><br />Shrooms are also the only drug which I&#039;ve taken and literally forgotten I was tripping. I recently read a report of a fever dream which was remarkably similar to a shroom trip I had once. The trip had three levels - head up, trying to talk to friends, I was slow, sleepy. When I looked down I couldn&#039;t communicate and my mind raced with strange thoughts. When my eyes closed I felt removed from this world, I felt sure this world was a dream I&#039;d had in the middle of an infinite soup of isolation and melting thoughts and senses. My thoughts were all that existed, all that had ever existed, and it was terrifying. Then it was over and I was normal again.<br /><br />It was the first solid lesson I was given about my fear of being isolated and unable to verify reality and track time by interactions with others. It was powerfully motivating, wouldn&#039;t trade the experience away.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is shrooms are no safer than acid and in either case you can go insane for a while and come back fully functional.

				I guess the word &quot;insane&quot; is thrown around alot in conjunction with LSD. I guess it depends on your definition of insane. I think people who don&#039;t experience the occasional psychedelic trip are insane, for never really getting to know themselves, and their connection to the world around them. Does feeling that way make me insane in the eyes of some? maybe, but it doesn&#039;t phase me.... also, do those who are &quot;insane&quot; know that they are insane, or are they continuing on their life just like you and I. But even further down this particular spiral, is it possible that I am in fact institutionalized, and my &quot;normal&quot; existence is a construct of my mind from an overpowering LSD trip that I never quite returned from, and if that is the case, maybe the psychedelic drugs I use now aren&#039;t causing me to &quot;trip&quot;, but rather peek back into the real world that has long been left behind. I don&#039;t remember where I was going with this, I am on day 2 of a pretty fun experiment.

				The question really isn&#039;t whether LSD can make you go insane (it does almost by definition even on a good trip) but whether LSD can make an insane person even insaner. The answer is yes, yes it can. Case in Point: Syd Barrett. However, the likelihood that someone with no symptoms of mental disorder developing them after one use of LSD? <br /><br />Slim as my ass.<br /><br />There are even reports of people WITH mental disorders losing them with use of LSD. That isn&#039;t a reccomendation, obviously, but something to think about.

				When I was in my 20s, around 10-15 years ago. I had a girlfriend who was into drugs, a bit older than me, hot pants and clubbing, hmmm fun times were had... but I digress.<br /><br />I soon found out she was bipolar, and had a strange male friend who was probably around 40. Anyway it&#039;s him I&#039;m getting to. We used to hang out with him on occasion and do a bucket load of drugs. He was a close friend of her&#039;s, obviously the mental &quot;conditions&quot; were a bond for them. We would only ever do an all nighter on uppers, then have a comedown day. While he would just go off and get more and not come down, and we wouldn&#039;t see him for a while. We usually did speed and E and weed. To be honest tripping with him would be fucking scary in hindsight :)<br /><br />Anyway he was a diagnosed schizophrenic for a long time, lithium I think he was on at the time. He did weird shit, heard voices, the lot, and that was whether he was on drugs or not. He would get so wrecked, he would be straight again, who knows. I don&#039;t think we, or he, knew what his baseline was any more. I have no reason not to believe him 100%, we weren&#039;t best mates, but on all night sessions you get things out in the open.<br /><br />My point is, he attributed his schizophrenia to the time he did LSD liquid in his eye. I have no idea how much, or how fucked he already was when he did it, but I have no doubt this developed his schizophrenia into &quot;full blown&quot;. I don&#039;t imagine liquid in the eye was his first LSD trip either, I&#039;m not saying he did a tab and went insane.<br /><br />Something in his psyche, or past, drew him to drugs/LSD. When he found it, it took him on a path, that was probably never going to leave him until he was fully &quot;schizo&quot;. He probably had many triggers for this, unhappy childhood, rough area.<br /><br />So really, IMO, it&#039;s a case of where you are now, and where LSD will take you. It will take you somewhere else, and change you, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />* Normal person, happy, doing drugs for fun, exploration, positive reasons... I think occasional LSD is probably good for you. I think it&#039;s made me more mentally stable and aware, but I&#039;ve only really &quot;LSD&quot; tripped out 3 or 4 times.<br /><br />* Mentally unstable, anxious, tormented past, using drugs to fuck yourself up because you just don&#039;t care any more... Your problems are going get a lot worse, or a lot better, it&#039;s a big gamble. If you have no idea what you&#039;re doing, and dose high in unsafe freak out situations, you are in for a rough ride.<br /><br />If you are asking this sort of question of LSD, you are probably going to be okay if you&#039;re careful. One bad trip isn&#039;t going to make you insane. Take care :-)<br />
