				A 20 mg aderall pill cost between $15 and $25 on SR, but 1000 mg of methamphetamine only cost around $100..<br />So doing some math, addrerall and other name brand ADD meds cost a dollar or more per milligram and a methamphetamine ( taken orally such as adderall or vyvanse) is only 10 cents a milligram (maybe even less). Well obviously meth is cut somewhat, but apprently its much cheaper than adderall and supposedly it has alot less side effects on the heart and doesnt raise your blood pressure as much as adderall or vyvanse. Any thoughts anybody?<br />And pls dont say that eating methamphetamine will lead to crystal meth abuse, I&#039;ve been eating crystal meth instead of my adderall on some important work days and i find that methamphetamine is just perfect and it doesnt make my heart palpitate like addderall does. Sorry for the rant, but guys lrt me know your opionions! Thanks!

				Try the Amphetamine that is sold in bulk. See the buyers review on Speed/Amphetamine. here&#039;s a link<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4750.5820;topicseen<br /><br />I&#039;ve was doing fine with that stuff until the 3 top sellers (CapeCrusader, Boymaster, and IisthisisI) were sold out around Memorial Day. I had a Meth sample someone sent me that I was saving, for just such a quandary. ::)&nbsp; I liked it too and started taking it since it was so easy to get. <br /><br />The difference? Meth on Silk Road is a total crapshoot. Or Russian Roulette if you will. You never know what you&#039;re getting, and I&#039;ve gotten almost &#039;run to the hospital&#039; sick from some of the cuts used. Particularly West Coast vendors, that are supplied by superlabs. <br /><br />Amph - Those top three vendors (all overseas if you&#039;re in US), have had their stuff tested by buyers in the wonderful Dutch harm reduction labs, and all three come back as high percentage purity, with NO cuts. <br /><br />Meth - Neurotoxic<br /><br />Amph - Not. <br /><br />I&#039;m just on a Meth break, and finally ordered CC&#039;s gear (5 grams for $100 ppd) - That&#039;s 166 - 30mg Addys <br /><br />Adderall is Amphetamine, not Methamphetamine. <br /><br />It&#039;s like Amph is Wine or Beer, and Meth is like hard liquor. And on SR Meth is the equivalent of Moonshine!<br /><br />I&#039;ll still buy Meth occasionally, but atm, there&#039;s so much fake Meth going around, I&#039;m glad I snagged that Amph when I did. <br /><br />Hope that helps. Good Luck!<br />

				agreed, the price of prescription amp&#039;s are off the wall.. locally I buy addy 25 for 4-5$ and addy 35 for 5-7...<br /><br />and on here they are going for like 5x that price.. its really sad.
