				It wouldn&#039;t hurt keeping it cool, the problem with the fridge is that it&#039;s sometimes a moist environment. as long as it&#039;s in that airtight you&#039;ll be good, even if in the fridge.

				nope. not for just a couple months. probably more important to keep dry so not in the fridge might actually be better. <br /><br />

				Your dope will be fine. You could leave it on your dresser in open air for a few months and it would be fine.<br /><br />Just think how old it probably is and all the harsh climates and things it has endured and still is fine. It comes probably from South America and is packaged and sits for a bit then collected and smuggled to Mexico somehow where it sits for a bit then smuggled into the states where it could sit at a stash house until the buyer or transporter is ready to deliver it to whatever location which could take a few weeks for a new supply is needed and all the details are lined up. Smuggling a 50 kilos across country doesn&#039;t happen with one phone call. A lot of people and coordination go in to getting a new shipment, so that a down payment of money is ready, a stash house, a person to pick up the drugs, and location of the delivery. <br /><br />
