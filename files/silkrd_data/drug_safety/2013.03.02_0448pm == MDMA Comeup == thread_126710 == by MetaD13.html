				Tried molly for the first time last night at a party....HOLY SHIT! this stuff is fuckin crazy! I&#039;m normally a pretty quite and controlled person but this stuff had me babbling on to any random person that I had never seen in my life before that night. The body rush that comes from this stuff is crazy too!<br /><br />Altho I noticed how unpleasant the comeup was before I started rolling. About 40 minutes after I took the pill(130 mg), i started to feel all dizzy and nauseous and for a little bit and thought someone sold me the wrong drug! I remember telling my buddies, wow I think something is wrong i dont feel right, he calmed me down and told me to relax until it kicks in. This shitty feeling lasted around 20 minutes and then I started rolling.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious about this because I don&#039;t remember reading anything about a nasty comeup on MDMA. I research every drug before I try it and have experience with LSD and DMT, so I was a bit suprised when this stuff almost made me lose my shit.

				This happens to me also!<br /><br />MDMA can be really hard on your stomach, Making you feel nauseous and so on.<br />The odd time it has made me vomit. Try not to eat a big meal or drink to much be for you drop your pills.<br /><br />The mean thing to remember is that those feeling always pass and when they do it&#039;s fucking amazing!

				Pretty much standard for phenethylamines; NBOMes are the same way: temp swings, nausea, vasoconstriction. Definitely unpleasant on the comeup but it all fades when it kicks in

				Try taking 80mg and then 50 a bit later. Make sure you haven&#039;t eaten any &#039;shit&#039; in the hours before taking it (and after); fruit is fine.

				Usually my come-up last between 45 and 90 seconds, all of the sudden I go from baseline to feeling weightless, like I&#039;ve been thrown off a cliff, I get a mild headache and tunnel vision (like when you stand up too fast (orthostatic hypotension)), I cant think clearly, then as fast as it came it&#039;s gone. I usually open my eyes at this point and everything is beautiful and I feel PERFECT (though still VERY light).<br />On one occasion I has CONSTANT eye wiggles for maybe 3 minutes, that freaked me out as I could not see straight, but it wore away pretty quick.

				I&#039;ve found that taking some ground ginger helps the mdma nausea. At the very least, it will make your burps taste gingery!

				This happened my first few times with MDMA, but you&#039;ll learn to love the feeling of coming up. It&#039;s like a pre-lude to the beautiful feelings about to hit you and that makes me excited.

				The scared or feelings of paranoia can be the cause of highly elevated cortisol levels during the kicking in of the MDMA. Your cortisol levels peak like crazy and can produce paranoid sensations. It really helps when you acknowledge what&#039;s happening to you. When ever I get the &quot;scares&quot; I just keep telling to myself in head that &quot;it&#039;s soon gonna be over and I&#039;m going to start rolling, chill the fuck out&quot;, does the trick every time.<br /><br />Some scientific info about MDMA &amp; cortisol from Pubmed:<br />&quot;Cortisol release is increased by stimulatory factors, including physical activity, thermal stress and stimulant drugs. In laboratory studies MDMA leads to an acute cortisol increase of around 150% in sedentary humans. In MDMA-using dance clubbers, the cortisol levels are increased by around 800%, possibly due to the combined factors of stimulant drug, physical exertion and psychosocial stimulation. &quot;<br /><br />Source: ***CLEARNET*** http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826870/ ***CLEARNET***<br /><br /><br />Google &quot;cortisol and paranoia&quot; = &quot;People may suffer from emotional disorders like depression, paranoia and anxiety due to elevated levels of this hormone.&quot;

				Especially with large doses, the period of time from about 40 minutes to 60 minutes is always especially unpleasant for me. I always get this feeling like &quot;oh fuck I think I took too much, I think I&#039;m gonna puke, I&#039;m gonna roll way too hard and not be able to move, my body is uncontrollably twitching, am I rolling yet?... etc.&quot; <br /><br />Then the 60 minute mark passes, and right on cue my thoughts change to &quot;Holy shit this was the best idea of my life! Things are so perfect right now! I love you! This feels soooooooo good... etc.&quot;<br /><br />Pretty much thats rolling for you! It&#039;s not just MDMA though, its MDA and all other rolls as well that have this effect on me<br /><br />ROLLING SUMMARY<br />Unpleasant anxious feeling<br />Awesome rolling sack feeling<br />Unpleasant drained feeling<br /><br />-Mao

During the peak I never really go over 20/30mg at the most. This adds a kind of trippy rushy sensation to the peak without dulling it. Very pleasant indeed :) After the MDMA peak is over I take my doseages higher and it brings back some of the MDMA euphoria, quality S+ isomer Ketamine is best for this.

				Yeah the comeup is sometimes a pain. In taking far too much of it I come to enjoy it because I know that after I walk through that wall there&#039;s an hour or two of bliss waiting for me. If it helps, for me, the hardest part is actually overheating and if I counter that at just the right time with some cold fresh air I can normally pass through it relatively unscathed.<br /><br />The thing I always tell myself and others is that if you do end up puking it&#039;s just fine. Everyone always feels better after the puke, sometimes they fight for a while and suffer when a quick purge would leave them rolling hard and happy.<br /><br />If it helps, I find by plugging I normally avoid the nauseous stage but that may not be true for everyone. Staging the dose as mentioned earlier can help too. 80mg than 50mg a half hour later. If you&#039;re like most of us though you&#039;ll learn to love the comeup. You&#039;ll know you&#039;re going to be fine, have a bucket handy in case you puke and be ready to have a great time once it&#039;s over. If I&#039;m eating my MDMA I normally do it on an empty stomach and drink lots of water so if I puke it&#039;s an easy puke instead of a &quot;I shouldn&#039;t have eaten all that pizza&quot; sort of deal.

				I see where your coming from, my experience is similar. My first time taking MDMA was unfortunately with very adulterated pills a few years ago. The come-up was strange and at times a little unpleasant. After the roll kicked in it was fantastic and I had a great time. However, about 1.5 hours after I dropped, I felt really really shitty, and contemplated leaving the event I was attending. I waited it out and after about 5 minutes of feeling down in the dumps, those negative effects went away and I was back to rolling really hard. To this day I cannot justify the experience. Maybe I was dehydrated, maybe I &quot;tweaked out&quot; or couldn&#039;t handle it? Possibly a bodily reaction to a foreign substance? I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />Hopefully your future MDMA experiences will be more pleasant coming up.

I just mentioned the small dose because if someone if questioning the comeup they probably are safer in the 120-130mg range till they get a hang of the stuff. I think most people who end up taking MDMA often enough end up in the 150-200mg range to get a good roll on but putting someone new on that much just makes the ride up more uncomfortable. You get used to it so quick though, me and my girl often take far too much of everything and right before we plug or eat the stuff we always say &quot;See you on the flip side&quot; because sometimes it&#039;s a hell of a ride.
