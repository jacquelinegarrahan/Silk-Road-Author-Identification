				Hey all,<br /><br />I just ordered my first gram from Hybridmike and I&#039;m fucking fired up to try his goods. I&#039;ve dabbled with blow over the years, but having bought through various middlemen in the past, I was never entirely sure what the fuck was actually in what I purchased -- to be honest, I doubt that I&#039;ve even truly experienced a good coke high. Having read up on the drug trade and how much the shit that hits the streets is stomped on, I&#039;m wondering if the &quot;coke&quot; I&#039;ve snorted is mostly speed cut with a *caine analog to produce numbing effects. One of the things I dig about SR is a kind of &quot;FDA-like&quot; labeling so you know exactly what you&#039;re getting quality and content wise.<br /><br />I&#039;ve purchased good chunks with little powder, but I discovered that re-rocking runs rampant, so chunks may not in and of themselves denote purity. Depending on the bag, sometimes I feel a nice euphoria. Sometimes I feel jittery for 10 or 15 minutes followed by a terminal crash which no amount of bumping can compensate for. Sometimes it goes smoothly up the snout. Sometimes it feels like I inhaled cayenne pepper. Some products have a good drip. Some have none. Unsure whether or not this depends on cutting agents or physiological state.<br /><br />Tons of discussions about how to gauge purity, how to wash it with acetone, what the cartels use to add bulk, etc. so I&#039;m not going to rehash those.<br /><br />Having finally scored a gram of quality blow, what&#039;s the best way to prepare and snort? To date, I&#039;ve taken the cliche mirror and razorblade to chop into a fine powder, followed by a hard sniff in one nostril while pinching the other shut. It seems to hit most of the back of my throat and doesn&#039;t make its way into the sinus cavities where it has a better chance of crossing the blood/brain barrier. Lots of drip. Face numb. Little euphoric effects. Could be the product. Could be my technique is completely wrong.<br /><br />For all the cocaine connoisseurs, what are the best practices for maximizing high with minimal product, i.e. not wasting it by blasting the back of your throat. Is a spice grinder better than the traditional razor blade chop? Should one take snort blasts along a line instead of inhaling the entire thing? Pushing your tongue up to the top of your mouth and making a grunting, piggy-like sound so the powder lands for maximum uptake? Is it possible to snort too hard or too soft? Maybe a middle ground is ideal?<br /><br />If you have any advice or wisdom to share, please pass it along!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				you&#039;re putting way, waaaay too much though into snorting coke. nonetheless, I shall share my coke ritual<br /><br />chop it up the best you can with a sharp razor blade. more powder the better - conserves it more efficiently. preferably on a glass surface. mirrors work just fine. but any surface will really do. as long as it&#039;s not a rug. roll up some sort of bill. or take apart a pen. or a straw - really, whatever you prefer. blow your nose. especially the side you plan on using. put your sniffing tool in your nostril - maybe like half of an inch. whatever feels comfortable. you don&#039;t need to jam it up there. take a breath and slowly release the air through your mouth; making sure to not blow your prepared coke away. as soon as your done exhaling, lower your head, and cover your opposite nostril and fucking bump that shit. speed and pressure is entirely up to you. as soon as the line if completed, put down your sniffing tool, tilt your head back, cover the opposite nostril with your finger again; and give yourself one more good solid sniff to make sure most of the line you just consumed does not sprinkle back out. next, enjoy the coke. <br /><br />repeat when needed. <br /><br />it&#039;s not necessary, but sometimes I would bump a tiny bit of water afterwards just to get the flow of the coke really moving - especially if I had a stuffy nose to begin with. just helps the overall flow of things. to end it all, I smoke a cigarette dipped in blow directly afterwards. <br /><br />congratulations! you are now done! you have officially and effectively ingested cocaine!&nbsp; 8) 8) 8)

				I would suggest the use of sterile saline solution spray for rinsing the nasal membranes, which will also help prevent some damage. Plus I feel like I might dissolve some extra and get a little bit higher.<br /><br />I would advise against applying tap water to the nasal cavities, due to the risk of infection by an amoeba. Acanthamoeba can live in the water from faucets and cross into the brain from the nose producing a lethal infection that is difficult to treat given the cells are eukaryotic and much more similar than prokaryotes.

				I like this topic&nbsp; &nbsp;;D <br /><br />I&#039;m surprised I haven&#039;t seen this info I&#039;m about to give elsewhere on the forum.&nbsp; it&#039;s by no means a secret, it&#039;s widely used.&nbsp; But I only see here people talking about using razor blades to cut up coke.&nbsp; Ugh, what a waste.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my Cocaine Handling and Usage Best Practices.&nbsp; AKA, How not to waste good coke.<br /><br />When I am home after my successful, albeit stressful, cocaine procurement (When buying it on the street and I&#039;m transporting it in my car, I like to blast &quot;they try to catch me ridin&#039; dirty&quot; to add to the fear rush factor.&nbsp; Especially fun when a cop is on your ass, but I digress...) and I&#039;m not going to do it right away, I make sure it is dry as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please take note of this Pro Tip, as it&#039;s key to making your precious coke last as long possible:<br /><br />Pro Tip No. 1:&nbsp; MAKE SURE YOUR COKE IS DRY AS POSSIBLE.<br /><br />If it&#039;s damp, I first dry it out under a heat lamp.&nbsp; I keep it under the lamp until its dry.&nbsp; I only determine this visually.&nbsp; That is, I can stir it around and it&#039;s not sticky, but it&#039;s all nice and loose, even if it&#039;s big chunks.&nbsp; You could go spend about a hundred bucks and get a humidity meter with a probe, but fuck that.<br /><br />Now that your coke is dry, you need to keep it that way.&nbsp; Coke seems to me to be somewhat hygroscopic, not sure if pure cocaine is, but the shit I usually end up with is.<br /><br />Get a bag that will hold all your coke, and then some.&nbsp; I always throw in a bag of desiccant or five straight into the bag of coke.&nbsp; Coke may be hygroscopic, but desiccant is more so.&nbsp; It will keep your coke nice and dry for a long time (longer that you&#039;ll be holding your coke I&#039;m sure).<br /><br />Here&#039;s a picture of a typical desiccant packet:<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=81f97495d069934cda7f210c212c98df.jpg<br /><br />I then store whatever coke I&#039;m not going to use into an airtight container.&nbsp; Also in the container is more desiccant (the big metal bar types, you&#039;ll see them online).<br /><br />I can&#039;t emphasize enough that, THE DRYER THE COKE THE BETTER, and the longer it will last!<br /><br />This brings us to the next Pro Tip:<br />Pro Tip No. 2:&nbsp; STRAIN YOUR COKE PROPERLY<br /><br />Using a razor blade to cut up your coke is ok if you have the right kind of coke to begin with (dry, fluffy, and powdery), but how often does that happen?&nbsp; Almost never for me.&nbsp; Therefore using a razor blade to cut chunks into lines is a great way to WASTE A SHIT LOAD OF PRECIOUS COCAINE. <br /><br />You want the greatest possible amount of surface area of coke to go up your nose and hit your membranes, and absorb into your body.&nbsp; Think of this extreme example:&nbsp; take a chunk of coke and shove it up your nose.&nbsp; The only part touching your membranes is the outer surface area of the chunk.&nbsp; Everything inside that chunk is essentially wasted.&nbsp; Yes I know the rest will eventually dissolve, but that&#039;s not how coke is taken for greatest effect.&nbsp; You want the maximum surface area to hit your membranes in the shortest amount of time.&nbsp; <br /><br />You achieve this by straining properly.<br /><br />Get yourself a good quality food strainer.&nbsp; I have 3, all with varying mesh sizes.&nbsp; <br />Something like this: http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=b645653e359fc8fabc33617f4c30f922.jpg<br />Ideally, you will always use a very fine mesh strainer.&nbsp; This will break down the rocks of coke into a very fine, fluffy powder, thus producing the greatest surface area of coke available to insuflate.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have 3 mesh sizes because if I do end up with damp coke and don&#039;t want to fuck with drying it, but get right down to business, I do use the bigger mesh size for straining.&nbsp; Straining damp coke through a fine mesh gives you gum, but you can manage to strain it through a larger mesh strainer.&nbsp; This is still better than the razor blade.&nbsp; For really wet coke, your pretty much fucked and should just do what I do and throw it on your friends pussy and snort it from there, and slap some on your cock and slap her face with it, but I digress...<br /><br />Straining dry coke through a fine mesh gives you a shitpile of coke.&nbsp; I can literally see my coke supply doubling in size as the pretty powder comes through the bottom of the strainer, guess what, it&#039;s like snow.<br /><br />I dump some DRY coke into the strainer and use the bottom of a rounded edge spoon and just go back and forth with the spoon while lightly pressing down on the coke, and watch the snow fall.&nbsp; Nothing like straining a couple 8 balls and seeing that huge pile of coke waiting for the party to start.<br /><br />I used to always use a plate but one time I decided to buy a teflon coated pan that comes with a tight fitting lid, and that works great!!&nbsp; I keep my coke covered (with desiccant in the pan) while not in use.&nbsp; It works awesome, everyone loves it!&nbsp; Your coke will last much longer!<br /><br />Not a fan of dollar bills unless in a bind.&nbsp; I just cut up a plastic straw, or use a small spoon.<br /><br />There are also grinding devices made for this purpose.&nbsp; You unscrew the top, put your DRY coke in, and crank the handle and watch the snow fall out.&nbsp; They even have threads on the bottom that the small plastic vials can screw into for coke-on-the-go.&nbsp; I had one years ago, but it fell apart and haven&#039;t since bought a new one.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Great tips<br /><br />Bridgehead - you are correct, pure cocaine is incredibly hydroscopic. I don&#039;t think its possible to get it much higher than 80% or so without it going to paste. <br /><br />Drying it is a bitch! Requires so much patience!<br /><br />OP: I reckon if its going straight to the back of your throat you could try snorting it with less pressure. I usually just take a normal deep breath in, rarely get much of a drip at all doing small lines....all seems to stay in my nose. This gives me great effects. I also hate having a numb throat...feels weird heh.
