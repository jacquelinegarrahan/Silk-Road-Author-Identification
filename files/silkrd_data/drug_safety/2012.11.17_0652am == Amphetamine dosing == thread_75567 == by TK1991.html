				Hey there, I was trying to find some information about microdosing amphetamine (speed) in replacement for dexedrine. Just a few questions regarding dosge mostly. I was taking 10mg dex a day but due to unexpected financial stress (bloody christmas) I cannot expect to fill my prescription for a few months and saw the price of &quot;jungle&quot; speed on the road, couldn&#039;t help but wonder. The vendor I was looking at claimed at least 50% purity, so by this logic I would take 20 mg of the amp a day orally to achieve the same effects? Also curious what people do as recreational doses for this substance (erowid is missing a dose section for amphetamine) but I&#039;ve noticed it is sold very cheap and generally in higher amount which leads me to believe more has to be taken to achieve the desired effects. Any information on this would be super helpful, thanks for letting me talk your ear off&nbsp; ;D<br />Much love<br /><br />EDIT: If anyone has any suggestions to alternatives aswell that would be awesome

				I&#039;m no expert on the issue but I&#039;ve noticed that many adderalls and methamphetamines in the US are being dosed at around 20-30mg. Here in Europe, a regular dose of amphetamine is anywhere between 150-300mg. I am going to take a long shot and guess that it&#039;s because amphetamine is not the same potency as dextroamphetamine or methamphetamine. If you are purchasing european speed, you might not feel anything from a 20mg dose, depending on how cut it is. But try it out slowly of course or you could kill yourself.

				The effect of Speed (amphetamine) lasts for 7 to 8 hours depending on the dosage. This means that you should wait for a relatively long period of time (30 mins or so) in between each new snort of speed. That way you can tell how much your heart is being pressured.<br /><br />I took way too much in one night, like 1,5 grams of 60% speed. Resulted in my heart pounding away for 8 hours....after that dosage of speed I couldn&#039;t sleep, obviously, so I stayed awake which weakened me mentally. Eventually resulted in very heavy panic attacks for like 7 hours or so....I didn&#039;t know about benzos back then so I went through all that crap without using 1 benzo lol.<br /><br />Moral of the story: be very careful with amphetamine dosage, wait for 30 mins in between each snort preferably as a safe measure.

				I was thinking of taking it orally for the most part, but if it&#039;d be more effective I might try snorting it. All the coca around here is cut with amp so I&#039;ve experienced that, up for 8 hours with my heart pounding erratically. I just want to take it medically but I imagine that I&#039;ll have to try it for fun first just to see how it feels&nbsp; :P<br />Also noticed that mostly all the speed listed is paste, is there anything specific I should be looking for i.e powder or paste, specific vendors anyone has experience with?

				There&#039;s seriously about 50 pages of discussion on speed as a replacement for pharmaceutical ADHD meds (adderall/dexedrine), their effectiveness/ineffectiveness (usually ineffectiveness, but not always), and alternatives.<br /><br />In a nutshell: <br /><br />* 2-FMA may work for you (2-fluoromethamphetamine, NOT 3-FMA or 4-FMA, you want 2-FMA).&nbsp; Some people seem to prefer it to adderall.&nbsp; I most certainly do not, but that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t much fun at all to abuse, so don&#039;t expect it to be.<br />* Clean meth will work almost as well.&nbsp; Actually getting a dosage in the 10-30mg range when you&#039;re staring at a shard the size of your thumbnail though, now that requires a milligram scale. Have one?&nbsp; Great, give it a try, but it&#039;s kinda costly (less so than buying the pills here though).&nbsp; Don&#039;t?&nbsp; You&#039;re gonna fuck up your dosage and take more than is clinically sanctioned and be able to think less well than you could in the first place.<br />* Speed is a poor replacement for pharmies.&nbsp; Very poor.&nbsp; In some cases, totally useless replacement.&nbsp; In other cases, kinda does the job, but almost never &quot;as well&quot; or even &quot;almost as well.&quot;&nbsp; Read the speed review topic for dozens of pages of information about this.<br />* Don&#039;t listen to anyone who says you should do anything with whatever you decide to try, except swallow it.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for medication replacement(s), ALWAYS swallow it.&nbsp; It always works better for intellectual enhancement if you swallow it (read: always).&nbsp; Don&#039;t even try anything else.&nbsp; You might like it, then you&#039;re stuck being reliant on a drug that you know in the back of your mind you *could* snort or *could* smoke on occasion... the problem is that you probably won&#039;t ever forget if you really like it, and it&#039;s your medicine that&#039;s going to be right there in front of you every day forever.&nbsp; Just not a good idea.<br /><br />Now don&#039;t get me wrong -- abuse your meds if you want, I mean I take enough speed to kill a small mammal most every day... I&#039;m not saying it isn&#039;t an option or your right to choose if you decide that&#039;s how you want to live.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying, &quot;why risk a life of having to resist the desire to abuse it if you don&#039;t have to.&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s all.<br /><br /><br />P.S. - sorry if I sound rude to anybody; just have strong opinions about amphetamines and their uses.
