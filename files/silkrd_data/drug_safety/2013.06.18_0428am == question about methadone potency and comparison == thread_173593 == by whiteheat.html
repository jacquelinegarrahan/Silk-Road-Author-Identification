				I&#039;ve searched the web/forums through and through and have derived that methadone is around 2x as potent as oxycodone orally (acute use), does that sound right?&nbsp; I wanted to just ask everyone what they think is the potency to make sure.&nbsp; i know everything else about it like really long half life and what not, but i&#039;m trying to figure out how much I can take to be free from withdrawals and even feel a little good for the whole day.&nbsp; I am physically dependent on opiates right now.&nbsp; To give you an idea of tolerance, my last purchase from sr was from gotsitall and his fire fucking dope.&nbsp; I was doing like .03-.04 intranasal and getting super high (maybe even less, i never actually measured it out).&nbsp; Last time i checked, as i dont take oxy often, 20 mg of oxy orally would have me nodding out.&nbsp; &nbsp;So yeah my tolerance is about as low as it gets for opiate users.&nbsp; For the next day I will finish my poppy seed tea off and then will start taking methadone.&nbsp; I have a bunch of 10 mg pills and was hoping to get nice of one half of one.&nbsp; I know you all arent my doctor and shouldn&#039;t give dosing advice, but do you think if I took 5 mg methadone with my tolerance, I could get a little above baseline (not high mind you) for a whole day and not have to worry about w/d until the next day?&nbsp; I mean, i&#039;m going to start off with 5 mg regardless but I just wanted to get some input to see what to expect.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks in advance for reading this and taking the time to help a fellow addict out&nbsp; 8)&nbsp;

				When I was opiate naive and had zero tolerance, I used to sometimes get 10ml of 1ml/mg methadone linctus, I would get a nice buzz, quite mild, 20ml and I would be very high off it. Personally, I think 10ml might be more in line for you, but 5ml is an excellent starting point and there is no point in taking more than you need as you will just up your tolerance!

				How can you be physically dependant on opiates when 20mg of oxy get you nodding out?? Usually tolerance is higher when you&#039;re already addicted. If it can help you with your conversions, 1mg of oral methadone is equipotent to 1mg of IV morphine, it&#039;s easy to remember that way. With zero tolerance, 10mg doesn&#039;t get me very high though.. 5mg would be enough to leave your withdrawals at bay probably but it won&#039;t get you high!

				I know I have a really rare tolerance thing.&nbsp; I just kept my use really under control yet it was daily so withdrawal symptoms nonetheless.&nbsp; 10 mg had me feeling pretty good. 20 mg to get real high, so yeah I overestimated it a bit.

I forgot to mention that. You shouldn&#039;t get high off the methadone if you&#039;re trying to quit, I&#039;d take the smallest possible dose. Subutex would probably be a better option too!<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty interesting that you managed to keep your tolerance low, at least quitting will be easier now.

				Please please please don&#039;t make methadone your drug of choice, it is the worst opiate to be addicted to

				yeah i know, heroin is still my fav.&nbsp; I just need something that can be brought on a plane easily as I am going on a family vacation and need something to get me through easily without having to constantly dose.

				&nbsp;I always like methadone more then anything else.. I would take 50-60mg each time and have a nice buzz, following an amazing nod.. If I had to choose between an oxy 80 IR and 60mg methadone, I would choose the methadone. Longer legs IMO.
