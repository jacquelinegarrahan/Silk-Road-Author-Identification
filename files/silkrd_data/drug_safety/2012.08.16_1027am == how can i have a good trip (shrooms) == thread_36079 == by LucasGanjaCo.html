				First step to having a good trip is becoming desireless, don&#039;t WANT a good tirp, don&#039;t NOT WANT a bad tirp.<br />Simply let it show you whatever you need to see.<br /><br />Bad trips aren&#039;t that bad IME anyway.

				I think Longtimer is right. These are the basics.<br /><br />But more generally, take time to really consider it. I recommend not to try it alone or in crowded place. I think the best situation is to be in a wide space, indoor or outdoor, not too dark, and have close friends around, whose at least one is clean (a friend of mine had a bad trip just because nobody was clean...).<br /><br />And the most important: don&#039;t forget some weed for the end! (it is useless to smoke while trippin&#039;)

If you&#039;re really worried stay at home your first time. Lock yourself in your room if you have to and just ride it out if it gets heavy.<br /><br />Better yet, do some research on the clearnet (Erowid, Blughlight, Shroomery, ect...) to ease any anxiety.<br /><br />PS - Shannon, thanks. Now all I can think about is pink elephants...

				Brainwash yourself, make yourself thoroughly believe that there is no such thing as a bad trip (IMO there isn&#039;t, even the negative ones teach you something)<br />It&#039;s all mind over matter baby.<br />Also make sure you don&#039;t have any mental conditions like depression, anxiety or schizo type stuff otherwise it may tip you over the edge.<br />Some people reccomend having benzos but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s right. Bad trips are usually caused by not lettin yourself go with the trip and resisting where the drug wants to take you.

				Go on erowid and read all the stories people have written about their wonderful trips on shrooms. Avoid the bad ones because that will just make you nervous and fill your head with bad thoughts. Most of those extremely bad trips are pretty rare anyways, you&#039;ll be fine as long as you&#039;re in a comfortable set/setting.<br /><br />Before I took LSD for the first time I was slightly nervous. I had a great time, and after that I realized that this bad trip stuff is kinda blown out of proportion IMO.

				first of all, get this &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; trip nonsense out of your head. it&#039;s just an attempt to paint the experience in black and white. every trip is a learning experience. as far as keeping a positive mindset when things get rough, it really comes down to surrendering to the mushroom. do not resist or try to control the trip, and you&#039;ll be fine. accept whatever you are shown--you&#039;re shown what you need to see. if you enjoy weed, that can help keep you calm as well.

				Bearing in mind what everyone above has said I would also recommend starting out with a rather small dose. You are uneasy because you do not know what to expect. That is understandable. <br /><br />Start with 1.5g and do not redose. This will allow you to crack open that &quot;door&quot; and peek inside, instead of kicking it in like the cops.<br /><br />Take your time. easy your dose up over time. Find your &quot;sweet spot&quot;<br /><br />You&#039;ll have a great time.<br />

I have severe episodic depression and (had) severe social anxiety, I started at 7 grams and went up to 12, gradually. If you have those problems, don&#039;t do that. Start at 3.5.

				Try to start with a low dose like 1.5g or 2.0g to introduce your mind to the tripping sensation. Being outside with my friends during a sunny day during the trip has always worked for me, I haven&#039;t had a bad experience doing that ever. Having some beautiful music and something to drink helps. Also i recommend swimming on shrooms, its an amazing feeling<br /><br /><br />Good luck and Be safe<br /><br />Shifty
