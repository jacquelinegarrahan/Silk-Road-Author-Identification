				So I just tested two samples of cocaine in bleach, I know the bleach test isn&#039;t the most accurate form of testing cocaine for cuts and such, but bare with me.<br />On the left hand side, I added about 30mg of the cocaine and as soon as it hit the bleach it turned into a orange/brick red colour. About 30 seconds later lumps of substance (which I believe might be cocaine?) fell to the bottom.<br /><br />On the right hand side I added about 20mg of cocaine from a different source. This remained white and after about 30 seconds the *cocaine* lumps started to fall like on the left hand side. <br /><br />Here are some pics.<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/y8ai.jpg<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/UZGg.jpg<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/oTEZ.jpg<br /><br />I know the pics aren&#039;t the best (especially since the only bleach we had was lemon flavour/colour ::) )<br />How would one analyze these results..? Does the red colour on the left hand side mean an amphetamine cut? <br />Cheers peeps .&nbsp; 8)

				have to see it myself to tell you more but the red/orange is amphetamine or synthetic caine (hard for me to tell you without seeing it myself as it happens.) that alone for me at lest make it no good. for the lumps it may have been it was just not into a fine powder it sould not fall straight down but more in a spiral and be dissolve before it hit the bottom. <br /><br />form reading what you said about the test. i think you got some bad cocaine may have very little real cocaine in it <br /><br />like i said may have been it was not into a very fine powder also it better to put it right in the middle not the side. whatever dose not fall down slowly in a clear/white spiral and dissolve before it hit the bottom. odds are that not cocaine. <br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi there, by bleach test, do you mean using ammonia? One of the best ways to test purity is by cooking cocaine rock or powder with bicarb soda or ammonia, in combination with a few other tricks to the game, you get a very good knowledge how good the coke your trying to analyze is. If you want me to explain it you how we test our shit normally, let me know. <br /><br /><br />Meerkovo
