				Please, for the sake of your health and cognitive functioning, spread your rolls out at least 2-3 months. The reasoning is simple. MDMA releases then depletes serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme responsible for producing more serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). The inhibition is permanent, so the body must compensate by creating more and this restoration typically takes 1-3 months. Taking MDMA prior to this restoration process is altogether stupid. Your body&#039;s reproduction of serotonin is already inhibited and by taking the substance during this healing period will start the entire process over.<br /><br />MDMA&#039;s mechanisms work as follows:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">MDMA binds to the SERT and reverses it causing a dump of serotonin. The hypothalamus directs the release of cortisol (an 800% increase) and ADH as a defense response to combat the serotonin release. This increases the speed at which serotonin is metabolized in the brain.<br /><br />This is the &quot;come-up.&quot; A sharp spike in serotonin characterized by a rise in cortisol levels. Skyrocketing cortisol levels are responsible for the come-up anxiety many users describe. And the rise in serotonin can sometimes cause nausea or bowel problems.<br /><br />Next: Serotonin is an inhibitor of dopamine in 3 out of 4 pathways. The brain-wide rise in serotonin levels is clogging up dopamine pathways and causing a buildup. Serotonin and cortisol levels both spike and begin to fall. When serotonin drops, the dopamine pathways open up and a rush of dopamine is released. Imagine a dam breaking. And with the rush of dopamine comes a release of oxytocin and prolactin into the bloodstream a la the hypothalamus.<br /><br />This is the &quot;peak.&quot; Characterized by a fall in serotonin and a rush of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway. The true &#039;magic&#039; of MDMA is a systematic release of dopamine, prolactin, and oxytocin, not serotonin.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dosing also plays a very large part in MDMA neurotoxicity as well, as it scales exponentially the more you take at a given time. With higher doses you are prone to hyperthermia and a decrease in antioxidant levels to deal with metabolites. While we lack the quantitative data for measuring the true damage done to a human due to obvious reasons, the neurotoxicity is very well established within mice and rats (see footnotes) and caution should be taken when choosing how much MDMA to ingest (1.5mg/Kg, more on that below).<br /><br />While the choice to roll often is obviously at the user&#039;s discretion, the best experience is had by maintaining this healthy time frame and also following a few general guidelines.<br /><br />Keep your body temperature LOW! Ensure that you do not overexert yourself when dancing as an increase in body temperature is the leading cause of MDMA induced neurotoxicity. As your body temperature rises, your body&#039;s natural process for creating antixodants is negatively affected and oxidative stress is increased, which leads to damage to your 5-HT axons. Take plenty of breaks when dancing so that you maintain a low body temperature.<br /><br />Eat right and exercise. This is a no-brainer. The healthier you are, the better your body will be able metabolize MDMA.<br /><br />Enjoy MDMA for what it is and don&#039;t utilize it to get intoxicated. It is meant to bring about an incredible experience that, for me at least, gives a profound outlook on life as a whole. Self control is a big part of this. Learn to resist the urge to take it, especially when under the influence of alcohol. The two really should NOT be combined. Respect the substance and it will respect you.<br /><br />Know your dose and do not re-dose! The general rule of thumb for dosing pure MDMA is 1.5mg/Kg. Given you have no tolerance, this is an excellent guideline and should be practiced thoroughly. If need be, take a booster (typically half of your initial dose) no later than T+1:00/1:30! Any subsequent doses will only greatly increase neurotoxicity and make the negative effects much more profound.<br /><br />Pre-load, post-load! Pre-load, post-load! This is CRITICAL and there is no reason not to do this as the vitamins are cheap and very effective. Antioxidants prior to your roll will largely alleviate neurotoxicity. Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Co-Q10, Alpha Lipoic Acid are all phenomenal antioxidants. A few other notables to smooth out your roll are magnesium glycinate for bruxism (jaw clenching) and ginger root for nausea. It is typically advised to take these one hour prior to rolling. Following your roll (when you are COMPLETELY DONE in order to avoid serotonin syndrome, so ~6-7 hours after dosing), a moderate dose (1-200mg, don&#039;t overdo it people) of 5-HTP will help begin the restoration process. If available, taking an SSRI on your comedown is very beneficial as it will prevent the uptake of nasty metabolites. A multivitamin at the end of your roll is also phenomenal in all regards, and while you won&#039;t want to, EAT! EAT LOTS OF FOOD!&nbsp; Pump your body with nutrients. You just exhausted your mind and body and it needs to refuel! Soups, fruits, and vegetables are great for the comedown and light on the stomach.<br /><br />Stay hydrated but don&#039;t overdo it. This is the biggest &#039;duh&#039; guideline, but it still needs to be reiterated. Drink a reasonable amount of water to compensate for whatever activity you&#039;re participating in, especially if you&#039;re dancing. Dehydration is not something you want to be playing with.<br /><br />All in all, MDMA is an absolutely amazing drug and much care needs to be taken when experiencing it and it can be near completely harmless if all the proper caution is taken. Respect your substance, know your body, and know your dose.<br /><br />Here are some great resources...

				Over the past 5+ months I have been pre/post-loading with this stuff **clearnet warning** http://www.raveaid.com/Default.asp **clearnet warning** and I really have noticed a difference along with eating well before/after.

				Excellent post, Animus. Thank you for this.<br /><br />I have been doing MDMA for about 2 years now, and have been for the most part having it once a month, with a few longer periods here and there. It was instinctual for me to wait at least this long, as I care about my health and don&#039;t want to screw with my brain. However, I think as you said, 2-3 months would be wiser. I am going to start waiting at least a couple of months between rolls now, as all of this makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />I have a friend who rolls all the time and takes a shitload of 5-HTP beforehand, thinking it protects him from everything and allows him to have a stronger trip. To him, it&#039;s as simple as 5-HTP being the firewood, and MDMA being the match. So as long as you have wood, you can have fire! Obviously an oversimplification, but I can&#039;t convince him of anything because he&#039;s been doing MDMA for years and thinks he knows it all. <br /><br />I like to take a single 5-HTP each day 1 week before, and 1 week after rolls, and I have recently started paying attention to antioxidants. BEST ADVICE I HAVE: MATCHA GREEN TEA! Matcha is LOADED with anti-oxidants, many times more than pretty much anything else on the planet. It is simply the best thing to have, in my opinion, to prevent neurotoxicity. Have it before, have it after, shit, have it every day of your life because it&#039;s fantastic stuff that most people still haven&#039;t discovered. It&#039;s expensive, but if you&#039;re willing to spend a bunch on your MDMA, you may as well do it right and spend a few bucks more to get your matcha/vitamins.<br /><br />Again, great post and an excellent thing to bring awareness to as there are too many people (like my friend) who are fucking themselves up and don&#039;t even realize it.

				Wow, I wish I had discovered this earlier. I took half a gram of MDMA over the course of the night which was a really horrible idea and I felt like shit the next day. I don&#039;t plan to do it again for a while; possibly once more this semester but not overdoing it like last time. I think people (like myself, before) treat it kind of like cocaine, with which you can keep doing bumps over the course of the night, but that&#039;s clearly not a great idea. At 5 am, I just started getting wide eyed and twitchy and straight up strung out.

Contrary to popular belief, you should actually avoid taking 5-HTP the day prior to rolling. The reasoning is simple: serotonin syndrome. Both MDMA and 5-HTP hone in on the serotonin system and having two substances that actively toy with this system is unwise, and while it is rare, can lead to serotonin syndrome. The best option for pre-loading with 5-HTP is to take it the week before rolling and avoid taking it the day of. For post-loading purposes, take it when you are COMPLETELY done rolling. Avoid taking it when coming down because MDMA is still relatively active. It&#039;s typically advised to wait 6-7 hours after your most recent dose before you ingest 5-HTP.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg566663#msg566663">Quote from: Niriane on November 04, 2012, 10:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From what I&#039;ve read, a re-dose for most people is typically a third of the initial dose, and not half?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The studies I have read vary between the two but ultimately leads to maintaining a booster dosage of half or less.

				From experience i can say 5htp is a must have..<br /><br />also strong doses 10mg of melatonin should be essential for the nightly come down, and plenty of alpha lipoic acid. you simply can&#039;t abuse mdma and still get great effects from it, after the abuse of this drugs, taking it is a waste.

				I&#039;ve done MDMA several times before but that was a night of excess because it was the first time I did it at a concert (usually I do it while chilling with friends at someone&#039;s house and playing music and doing poi). I&#039;d rather treat it as a social/heart-to-heart/learning experience again and stick to drinking for concerts and other such events.

				You simply won&#039;t roll or &quot;feel the magic&quot;. Negative effects will be accentuated and much more significant than if you had waited and the likelihood of depression and anxiety are much, much higher. It&#039;s essentially trying to release the floodgates of a dam that has no water behind it. As far as using other substances in between, yes, it&#039;s fine! LSD and mushrooms have a much different method of action and haven&#039;t shown to be neurotoxic.

				so like if im not a big user.. and ive never poped a whole pill.. so give or take my doses are like 100 mg of mdma. and i break those in halves.. <br /><br />the serotonin i used up is already depleted basically.. so even if i up&#039;d the dose and just poped 3 whole pills.. id probably feel it. but would be starting the whole cycle again... not to mention possible dammage from over usage.<br /><br />is ok to take like lil bits of mdma. continually untill i use up like say 100 mg within a day or 24 period ?

				The articles are talking about both meth and MDMA, as MDMA is an analogue of meth. Smaller animals are also much more resistant to neurotoxicity which accounts for the boost in dosing. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have the full text on hand, but here is an abstract of a study that shows the possibility for neurotoxicity at recreational dosages (1.28mg/Kg) in humans:<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=402<br /><br />In any case, until society wants to pump a live human with recreational dosages of MDMA for a better picture of neurotoxicity, these studies are all we have to go by. I&#039;m very much inclined to take great caution when it comes to ingesting a recreational drug and utilize these studies to my advantage. MDMA has been established over and over again to be neurotoxic. The big question that we are trying to figure out now is just exactly how it is neurotoxic. The forefather of MDMA, Alexander Shulgin, also advised a 90 day period in between dosing.<br /><br />I&#039;m with you in wanting a much more conclusive study in relation to recreational dosages in humans, but alas, we have medical ethics to abide by and instead must use animal trials as our basis of understanding. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg569270#msg569270">Quote from: metaphoe on November 06, 2012, 06:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">so like if im not a big user.. and ive never poped a whole pill.. so give or take my doses are like 100 mg of mdma. and i break those in halves.. <br /><br />the serotonin i used up is already depleted basically.. so even if i up&#039;d the dose and just poped 3 whole pills.. id probably feel it. but would be starting the whole cycle again... not to mention possible dammage from over usage.<br /><br />is ok to take like lil bits of mdma. continually untill i use up like say 100 mg within a day or 24 period ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You won&#039;t achieve the desired effect by spreading it out over a given period and you will typically induce more negative effects than positive.

Take a regular dose and enjoy yourself for a few hours. If you want to extend the feelings as long as possible, avoid alcohol. Maybe have some caffeine. Take a nice high dose of vitamin C before / during the roll and if you really want to extend yourself switch to a light tryptamine during the come down .. 2C-B is recommended at very low doses.

				What is your gender and weight, metaphoe, if I may ask? I highly recommend taking the full pill if you aren&#039;t below 46/Kg. Females are also generally more sensitive to MDMA as well. What is it you&#039;re afraid of? If you are used to a powerful psychedelic (mushrooms), you should be very comfortable taking MDMA. Also, what do you mean by &#039;extras&#039;? If you mean the vitamins, yes, they help tremendously and will help make the roll that much better. The greatest benefit of pre-loading and post-loading is in helping your body recover from the experience. It doesn&#039;t amplify the roll as you&#039;re probably thinking, but instead reduces neurotoxicity, helps with the comedown, and improves the feelings in the days/week after.

				You may be very sensitive to MDMA, which in that case you may be right in halving the pills. Another possibility is the fact you were smoking alongside. Weed can intensify a roll a LOT and can cause for the anxiety that you are talking about. Next time, try taking a full dose without taking any other drug or smoking. MDMA can be very intense, but as with any psychoactive substance, the best advice I have ever come across is to &quot;Breathe. Relax. Let go&quot;. Embrace it and let it guide you through a lucid experience.

				Then yes, you are probably one of the few individuals that are very sensitive to MDMA, in which case, continue halving your pills.<br /><br />Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a real thing but is incredibly rare. You really shouldn&#039;t worry too much about this.

				I actually ran across a reference to that article once but wasn&#039;t able to give it a solid read until just now. Very interesting information and an excellent study all around, microRNA. Thanks for sharing! THC truly is one of the most amazing compounds ever.<br /><br />TheBusiness, you&#039;re correct! Viagra is a PDE5 inhibitor and increases the release of natural antioxidants and protective chemicals in the brain which prevented 5-HT deficits in rats. I personally wouldn&#039;t recommend it as a solution in preventing neurotoxicity due to the potential for a bad interaction between Viagra&#039;s vascular effects and MDMA&#039;s heart-rate, blood pressure, and body temperature-increasing tendencies, but it&#039;s an interesting subject nonetheless.

Ask yourself this: is a night out worth the potential cost of irreversible damage to cognitive ability? It&#039;s really hard to say if you&#039;ve already damaged your brain and I would be more inclined to say no, you haven&#039;t, but what you probably will experience is a brief funk for a few weeks (or even longer). Given how much pressure you&#039;ve placed on serotonin system, you will most likely experience bouts of anxiety, depression, lack of interest in certain activities, lowered motivation to get up in the morning, headaches, and so forth. This could be from severe to very minimal depending on your overall health and various other factors. <br /><br />The long break you&#039;re planning will help tremendously and, assuming you haven&#039;t damaged your brain, cognitive functioning should be restored to normal levels. If damage does occur, you will most likely not notice it assuming you abstain. If you exercise, the recovery process will be improved exponentially. However, whether or not it will &quot;ruin&quot; MDMA (which I assume you mean &#039;losing the magic&#039;) is completely subjective to your chemistry and a total coin flip. Some users experience loss of magic after the first use while others can binge and still maintain the optimal effects. This is something I simply cannot tell you. What I can tell you is to rethink taking MDMA this weekend as the risk of damage is very possible. You should not only respect the substance, but also your body. Treat your mind as best as you can. Brain damage is a serious matter.

				***Clearnet*** http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/287832-5-HTP-and-cardiac-fibrosis ***Clearnet***<br /><br />I am not saying 5-htp is bad for you when taken in moderation, but don&#039;t start taking huge doses daily. There is always a possibility of consequences. I highly recommend thoroughly reading the bluelight link.<br /><br />I actually experimented with 5-htp last winter and got a great help from it. It&#039;s really dark here in Finland during winter and I usually get some anxiety during the winter. I tried taking 5-htp once every morning for a month and got a significant change in mood from taking it. I was taking a strong complex vitamin B capsule with it everyday. but I really wouldn&#039;t recommend staying on it for long. <br /><br />L-tryptophan should be somewhat safer to take on a daily basis for extended periods of time to aid serotonin biosynthesis in the body.<br /><br />As what are my thoughts on taking MDMA as OP said moderation is key. Also, there are huge differences in one&#039;s brain chemistry. Where others need 3 months to recover, some may need only a month to FULLY recover to baseline after taking MDMA. <br /><br />

Being new to MDMA this post gave me a lot of valuable input. I did some research myself and found the following list:<br /><br />*clearnet*<br />http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v04n1/04134pea.html<br /><br />Nutrient&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preventive Dose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therapeutic Dose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Form<br />b-Carotene&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider supplements of other carotenoids (e.g., lycopene) as they become available<br />Bioflavonoids&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed bioflavonoids from a variety of sources<br />Coenzyme Q10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only one form available<br />L-Ascorbic acid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2-4 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6-12 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free acid or calcium, magnesium salt<br />L-Carnitine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 gram&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L-carnitine HCl or, if possible, less hygroscopic salts (e.g., L-carnitine magnesium citrate)<br />N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 grams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only one form available; do not use L- cysteine<br />Selenium&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250 mcg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 500 mcg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Form not critical -- inorganic (e.g., selenite) as effective, and less expensive, than organic forms (e.g., selenomethionine)<br />Vitamin E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,000 IU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,000 IU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Available data indicate that form is not critical<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what to do with these doses. Daily, prior to rolling, postrolling? Which of the two doses should I use, preventive or therapeutic?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />These dosages are actually rather obscure to me as well and that article is quite outdated. I would honestly advise you purchase a quality supplement brand (NOW Foods is what I use) and to simply take the recommended dose that they have on the label prior to rolling. My reasoning for this is that if they are producing high quality and pure supplements, their research department has most assuredly gone to the appropriate lengths to ensure proper dosing. Doubling up on the recommended dose is also a sound strategy if you know how well your body metabolizes the particular supplement you&#039;re taking. The only antioxidant I would recommend NOT doubling up on is Vitamin E, as higher doses can lead to stomach problems, fatigue, and headache. As far as taking antioxidants after rolling, it&#039;s not needed. The half-life of these supplements is longer than the entire duration of a roll. A multivitamin afterwards is enough to fill the void after a roll, along with 5-HTP and plenty of food. <br /><br />The best advice is to test each supplement you add to your regimen prior to rolling with it so that you fully understand how your body reacts to certain dosages.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg569798#msg569798">Quote from: Dopamin on November 06, 2012, 12:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And I have another question:<br />*clearnet*<br />https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619665<br /><br />&quot;Repeated administration of the metabolic antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d. for 2 consecutive days) 30 min prior to MDMA did not prevent the acute hyperthermia induced by the drug&quot;<br /><br />This sentence makes no sense for me.

I think the biggest concern would be ensuring purity to the point of having no doubts whatsoever. I would send that product through multiple acetone washes before even considering it. What dosages do you typically take when IVing? Do you dilute in a saline solution?<br /><br />Due to MDMA&#039;s inconclusive bioavailability, I&#039;d be hard pressed to state anything definite about the neurotoxicity from intravenous administration. I would, however, assume that it&#039;s just as neurotoxic as oral administration, and perhaps even more-so. I&#039;ll do some study digging and see what I can find!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg570743#msg570743">Quote from: d4lyvi on November 06, 2012, 11:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Great post Animus, thank you.

The purpose of those studies was to better understand the SUBJECTIVE effects, and how they actually affect individuals and their perceptions on particular emotional variables. The neuroscience was incredibly downplayed and is much more complicated than what they depicted, and Nutt is oversimplifying the &quot;3-day blues&quot;. While I am very thrilled with the trials and how well it was executed, it actually does very little in determining the neurotoxicity from recreational dosages (and in fact their dosages were much lower than recreational). I could be completely wrong, though, and they may have been better documenting it than I am aware of and will be publishing said studies in due time. In which case, consider me very excited! However, in the meantime, I must stand by my previous post.<br /><br />And in my opinion, Nutt is far too pretentious for his own good. ;)

				i once took too much mdma in one night with my friend, Made my last 400mg bomb dropped it and it did nothing. The next 4 days i exprienced eletronic shocks through out my body whenever a noise happened or i drifted off to sleep or something moved.<br /><br />Each shock was like hearing static noise, i then saw a white flash and felt an eletric like shock down my body, this lasted for 4 days. My friend had the exact same symptoms.. it was horrible i got 4 hours sleep and couldn&#039;t go to work. <br /><br />Im now very cauious when using MDMA, i seriously thought i might not be ever be normal again. <br /><br />MDMA raped me, and i will never forget.

Drug use during developmental stages is always a very risky thing. I can’t stress it enough to teenagers to abstain or take great caution and use drugs sparingly until their brain has fully developed before ingesting recreational chemicals because it DOES effect cognitive ability in the long term whether they choose to believe it or not. Obviously complete abstinence isn’t realistic as experimentation is at its height during high school, but harm reduction should be a staple with everyone’s use. It’s a shame that our education system doesn’t stress harm reduction in the states. Here’s to hopeful thinking that one day we will!<br /><br />In any case, I’m quite interested to pick at your brain if you have the time. Like my previous question, can you outline your usage? What drugs did you partake and how often? Have you noticed any detriment now that your older, particularly in the realm of short term and long term memory?

				Those who are using Piracetam to bring back the magic, I find it way more effective if you take the Piracetam about 30/60mins before you drop the MDMA, rather than pre-loading with it for days/weeks before hand. At a dose around 2400mg.

Take a multivitamin daily (Controlled Labs Orange Triad). The day of rolling, load up on a nutritious meal. Thirty minutes prior to ingesting MDMA, take vitamin C, vitamin E, Co-Q10, alpha lipoic acid (ALA), and magnesium citrate. Seven hours after ingesting MDMA, take 300mg of 5-HTP and pump your body with healthy food (soups, fruits, and vegetables). Sleep. Wake up feeling like a badass.

The reasoning is simple. MDMA releases then depletes serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme responsible for producing more serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). The inhibition is permanent, so the body must compensate by creating more and this restoration typically takes 1-3 months. Taking MDMA prior to this restoration process is altogether stupid. Your body&#039;s reproduction of serotonin is already inhibited and by taking the substance during this healing period will start the entire process over.<br /><br />MDMA&#039;s mechanisms work as follows:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">MDMA binds to the SERT and reverses it causing a dump of serotonin. The hypothalamus directs the release of cortisol (an 800% increase) and ADH as a defense response to combat the serotonin release. This increases the speed at which serotonin is metabolized in the brain.<br /><br />This is the &quot;come-up.&quot; A sharp spike in serotonin characterized by a rise in cortisol levels. Skyrocketing cortisol levels are responsible for the come-up anxiety many users describe. And the rise in serotonin can sometimes cause nausea or bowel problems.<br /><br />Next: Serotonin is an inhibitor of dopamine in 3 out of 4 pathways. The brain-wide rise in serotonin levels is clogging up dopamine pathways and causing a buildup. Serotonin and cortisol levels both spike and begin to fall. When serotonin drops, the dopamine pathways open up and a rush of dopamine is released. Imagine a dam breaking. And with the rush of dopamine comes a release of oxytocin and prolactin into the bloodstream a la the hypothalamus.<br /><br />This is the &quot;peak.&quot; Characterized by a fall in serotonin and a rush of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway. The true &#039;magic&#039; of MDMA is a systematic release of dopamine, prolactin, and oxytocin, not serotonin.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dosing also plays a very large part in MDMA neurotoxicity as well, as it scales exponentially the more you take at a given time. With higher doses you are prone to hyperthermia and a decrease in antioxidant levels to deal with metabolites. While we lack the quantitative data for measuring the true damage done to a human due to obvious reasons, the neurotoxicity is very well established within mice and rats (see footnotes) and caution should be taken when choosing how much MDMA to ingest (1.5mg/Kg, more on that below).<br /><br />While the choice to roll often is obviously at the user&#039;s discretion, the best experience is had by maintaining this healthy time frame and also following a few general guidelines.<br /><br />Eat right and exercise. This is a no-brainer. The healthier you are, the better your body will be able metabolize MDMA.<br /><br />Enjoy MDMA for what it is and don&#039;t utilize it to get intoxicated. It is meant to bring about an incredible experience that, for me at least, gives a profound outlook on life as a whole. Self control is a big part of this. Learn to resist the urge to take it, especially when under the influence of alcohol. The two really should NOT be combined. Respect the substance and it will respect you.<br /><br />Know your dose and do not re-dose! The general rule of thumb for dosing pure MDMA is 1.5mg/Kg. Given you have no tolerance, this is an excellent guideline and should be practiced thoroughly. If need be, take a booster (typically half of your initial dose) no later than T+1:00/1:30! Any subsequent doses will only greatly increase neurotoxicity and make the negative effects much more profound.<br /><br />Pre-load, post-load! Pre-load, post-load! This is CRITICAL and there is no reason not to do this as the vitamins are cheap and very effective. Antioxidants prior to your roll will largely alleviate neurotoxicity. Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Co-Q10, Alpha Lipoic Acid are all phenomenal antioxidants. A few other notables are Magnesium citrate for bruxism (jaw clenching) and Ginger Root for nausea. It is typically advised to take these one hour prior to rolling. Following your roll (when you are COMPLETELY DONE in order to avoid serotonin syndrome, so ~6-7 hours after dosing), a moderate dose (2-300mg, don&#039;t overdo it people) of 5-HTP will help begin the restoration process. If available, taking an SSRI on your comedown is very beneficial as it will prevent the uptake of nasty metabolites. A multivitamin at the end of your roll is also phenomenal in all regards, and while you won&#039;t want to, EAT! EAT LOTS OF FOOD!&nbsp; Pump your body with nutrients. You just exhausted your mind and body and it needs to refuel! Soups, fruits, and vegetables are great for the comedown and light on the stomach.<br /><br />Stay hydrated but don&#039;t overdo it. This is the biggest &#039;duh&#039; guideline, but it still needs to be reiterated. Drink a reasonable amount of water to compensate for whatever activity you&#039;re participating in, especially if you&#039;re dancing. Dehydration is not something you want to be playing with.<br /><br />All in all, MDMA is an absolutely amazing drug and much care needs to be taken when experiencing it and it can be near completely unharmful if all the proper caution is taken.

Also I´ve changed a lot, not as happy, not as high on life.. I would say your post is very true and I´ve got a fraction of the serotonin left that I had before :P now if you could provide an article to fixing my brain that would be great lol :P Wish I had seen this when I was 16 lol

MDA and MDMA act very similarly and have an affinity for the same receptors, and it has actually been noted in medical literature that MDA may be even more neurotoxic than MDMA. Do not lead yourself to believe you can slip an MDA roll in between the advised waiting period and the restoration process will not be affected negatively. Here are a few studies:<br /><br />http://www.jneurosci.org/content/8/8/2788.full.pdf<br />http://www.maps.org/publications/1987_stone_3.pdf<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784586<br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg566562#msg566562">Quote from: AnimusVox on November 04, 2012, 08:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please, for the sake of your health and cognitive functioning, spread your rolls out at least 2-3 months. The reasoning is simple. MDMA releases then depletes serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme responsible for producing more serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). The inhibition is permanent, so the body must compensate by creating more and this restoration typically takes 1-3 months. Taking MDMA prior to this restoration process is altogether stupid. Your body&#039;s reproduction of serotonin is already inhibited and by taking the substance during this healing period will start the entire process over.<br /><br />Dosing also plays a very large part in MDMA neurotoxicity as well, as it scales exponentially the more you take at a given time. With higher doses you are prone to hyperthermia and a decrease in antioxidant levels to deal with metabolites. While we lack the quantitative data for measuring the true damage done to a human due to obvious reasons, the neurotoxicity is very well established within mice and rats (see footnotes) and caution should be taken when choosing how much MDMA to ingest (1.5mg/Kg, more on that below).<br /><br />While the choice to roll often is obviously at the user&#039;s discretion, the best experience is had by maintaining this healthy time frame and also following a few general guidelines.<br /><br />Eat right and exercise. This is a no-brainer. The healthier you are, the better your body will be able metabolize MDMA.<br /><br />Enjoy MDMA for what it is and don&#039;t utilize it to get intoxicated. It is meant to bring about an incredible experience that, for me at least, gives a profound outlook on life as a whole. Self control is a big part of this. Learn to resist the urge to take it, especially when under the influence of alcohol. The two really should NOT be combined. Respect the substance and it will respect you.<br /><br />Know your dose and do not re-dose! The general rule of thumb for dosing pure MDMA is 1.5mg/Kg. Given you have no tolerance, this is an excellent guideline and should be practiced thoroughly. If need be, take a booster (typically half of your initial dose) no later than T+1:00/1:30! Any subsequent doses will only greatly increase neurotoxicity and make the negative effects much more profound.<br /><br />Pre-load, post-load! Pre-load, post-load! This is CRITICAL and there is no reason not to do this as the vitamins are cheap and very effective. Antioxidants prior to your roll will largely alleviate neurotoxicity. Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Co-Q10, Alpha Lipoic Acid are all phenomenal antioxidants. A few other notables are Magnesium citrate for bruxism (jaw clenching) and Ginger Root for nausea. It is typically advised to take these one hour prior to rolling. Following your roll (when you are COMPLETELY DONE in order to avoid serotonin syndrome, so ~6-7 hours after dosing), a moderate dose (2-300mg, don&#039;t overdo it people) of 5-HTP will help begin the restoration process. If available, taking an SSRI on your comedown is very beneficial as it will prevent the uptake of nasty metabolites. A multivitamin at the end of your roll is also phenomenal in all regards, and while you won&#039;t want to, EAT! EAT LOTS OF FOOD!&nbsp; Pump your body with nutrients. You just exhausted your mind and body and it needs to refuel! Soups, fruits, and vegetables are great for the comedown and light on the stomach.<br /><br />Stay hydrated but don&#039;t overdo it. This is the biggest &#039;duh&#039; guideline, but it still needs to be reiterated. Drink a reasonable amount of water to compensate for whatever activity you&#039;re participating in, especially if you&#039;re dancing. Dehydration is not something you want to be playing with.<br /><br />All in all, MDMA is an absolutely amazing drug and much care needs to be taken when experiencing it and it can be near completely unharmful if all the proper caution is taken. Respect your substance, know your body, and know your dose.<br /><br />If anyone has anything to add or if you noticed a mistake in this post, please share it with me! Knowledge is power after all. Happy tripping everyone. Stay safe and be smart. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey AnimusVox<br /><br />Awesome, wise and beneficial post!<br /><br />So important that you addressed the issue of re-dosing, as in my experience this is where the neurotoxicity is greatly exacerbated. I agree that only one booster should be taken and also that it should be within T+1h30 at the latest. I would also add that I think that the booster dose should be AT MOST 50% of the initial dose, but ideally should be closer to a 1/3, i.e. 110mg + 40mg will be less neurotoxic than 100mg + 50mg (total dose of 150mg in both cases) even if timing is identical.<br /><br />Another thing I would mention is that the primary reason people re-dose (and re-dose) is because no-one really wants to leave that space of grace - and so, in the heat of the moment with the strong desire to extend the pleasure, many will simply re-dose again despite knowing about the potential toxicity.<br /><br />Exercising intelligence here, the trick is to transition from the MDMA to another drug that (a) is not neurotoxic, (b) allows extension of the MDMA space, and (c) has a baseline transition that is more gentle than MDMA and easier to endure.<br /><br />There are two drugs that serve this very well; 2C-B and GHB [Full Disclosure: I am a vendor of GHB]. <br /><br />Both allow a significant extension of the MDMA space while also creating a far smoother and benign transition towards baseline (and also better psychological/emotional integration of the MDMA consciousness with the normal waking state). <br /><br />Please see here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90975.0 for more detailed information on how to use MDMA and GHB together.<br /><br />Options that work well are:<br /><br />MDMA + GHB<br />MDMA + 2C-B<br />MDMA + 2C-B + GHB<br /><br />When these two drugs are used together with MDMA the whole experience is enriched, and more pleasure can be derived for less total MDMA ingested - which ultimately serves the protection of the nervous system.<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

				+1, BlueGiraffe. Tapering an MDMA comedown with 2C-B is absolutely beautiful. It offers for a much more lucid experience and is phenomenal for music festivals so you don&#039;t have to overly tax your brain on those long three days weekends. I have found taking 20-30mg at the T+4:00 mark to suit my personal needs. My absolute favorite combination, however, is when LSD is coupled with the other two under a timeline as such:<br /><br />T+0:00: 300ug LSD<br />T+2:00: 140mg MDMA<br />T+6:00: 30mg 2C-B<br /><br />No other combination I have ever partaken in is as divine. :)<br /><br />As for GHB, I skimmed through your thread and it&#039;s definitely peaked my interest. I&#039;ve personally never dabbled in it but it seems like quite an interesting substance! I&#039;ll have to grab a bit from you sometime in the near future. Thanks for the addition to the thread!

				Yeah that should do it!!<br /><br />That&#039;s tripped - just a couple days ago I posted an almost identical &quot;favourite combo&quot; here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90964.0 (see towards the end of the thread)<br /><br />We clearly have very similar drug tastes :)<br /><br />Adding GHB at the end of the LSD-MDMA-2CB sequence is totally exquisite - brings in a very deep eroticism and strong sexual energy (and is very playful) and rounds out the whole experience beautifully...<br /><br />Check your mail :)<br /><br />BG

				Great 1st post and overall great thread.&nbsp; Thanks AnimusVox.<br /><br />@Animus-&nbsp; Some forum users have suggested micro-dosing MDMA on a continual basis to help with anxiety.&nbsp; The listed positive effects of MDMA (less anxiety, a greater desire to connect with others, artificially increased trust) could be beneficial to me from a psychotherapy standpoint, but I&#039;m concerned about long-term continual usage w/ regard to toxicity.<br /><br />Any thoughts/opinions on this?<br /><br />Much appreciated.

I would highly recommend against it due to MDMA&#039;s method of action, neurotoxicity, and sharp increase in tolerance. I believe you would find microdosing MDMA to actually provide for adverse effects and an INCREASE anxiety due to it&#039;s inhibition of serotonin production. Those recommendations are completely ill advised. MDMA use, at any dose, is best kept spread out 2-3 months.

				Still curious about the effects of an IV ROA on neurotoxicity if you were able to find anything Animus! <br /><br />My cousin IV&#039;d a little more than .4 of high-quality (from dutchaandbod) in one night. He&#039;s got a bad diet and no exercise and i&#039;m wondering what kind of damage that could have caused.

				It wouldnt have caused much damage if at all any, but IV&#039;ing mdma is just a bad idea.<br />I remember selling someone a cap of pure M(200mg) and he IV&#039;d the whole lot. Looked like someone had thrown a bucket of water on him, he was a mess.<br /><br />Has anyone combined MDMA/2C-B and 5-MeO-MiPT(Moxy) together?<br />

				Drugs and the Damage they Cause<br /><br />All right, so lots of people here talking about fucking up their brains good and proud off eating too much MDMA and worried about what they did to themselves. I get that it&#039;s a pretty big deal but I think most people are looking at their body and mind as some sort of clear slate which, prior to their offenses, were majestic and pure.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t.<br /><br />We are sitting here trying to make a qualitative analysis of the damage done by ingesting a chemical and comparing us then and now to determine if we are the same person. We are not. The chemical changed us. There is simply no disagreement there. This drug and most drugs change who we are. But you know what? So does exercise. So does the choice of laundry detergent we use. So does the repetition with which we perform mundane tasks. So does every little thing on this entire planet change us is some large or small way. If no one took drugs there would still be cancer. There would still be car accidents. There would still be loss. And there would still be happiness.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s funny that we live in a world where a chemical that makes people happy is condemned to stigma while we happily eat billions of chickens a year pumped full of stuff that would make a chemist cry. Our diets consist of high fructose corn syrup and processed everything. Life is toxic. The world we have created is toxic. Every breath you take is counting down to that last one and you have no idea if that&#039;s going to come tomorrow or in seventy years. <br /><br />So yes, MDMA will fuck up your brain. If you want to enjoy it don&#039;t do too much of it too often. But for those that have binged and lament over the self they lost I would suggest that the person you are missing was dying anyway. We were all more brilliant when we were younger. We were all less depressed when we had an optimistic life full of endless possibilities ahead of us. It used to be much easier for all of us to get off the couch and partake in some grand adventure. But with or without the drugs we are all headed the same direction. I love getting old. I love not being the same person I was when I was younger. I love that life keeps changing and I have to keep finding some way to adapt to the person I am becoming.<br /><br />I get the whole thing about harm reduction and I couldn&#039;t agree more. I just think it&#039;s important to point out that if you spared yourself the drugs the person you would likely be is still very similar to the one you are now. Addictive people will binge on anything. Exercise, food, love, sex, caffeine or whatever. The little bit of damage caused by the MDMA might be better or worse than that caused by an STD from a sex addiction, the diabetes from a food addiction or the battered and sore joints of an exercise addiction.<br /><br />So do what you can to enjoy life. If you, like me, occasionally take things to excess, that&#039;s just who we are. It&#039;s our life and it&#039;s ok. I&#039;m not trying to disagree with anyone about the damage mitigation but we all know some people get fucked on a substance and others don&#039;t. Because the stuff we enjoy is illegal, most all of the information we get about it is biased and often incorrect. A lot of the complaints I hear from chronic users are similar to complaints I hear from anyone that is getting older. Maybe the drugs make it worse for some folks. Maybe they would have been better off never taking it but odds are you would have found some other way to squander your youth and regret it&#039;s passing.<br /><br />Anyway, do what you can to be safe. I love everybody and I hope they love themselves too. If you binge like mad though from time to time just try and remember you&#039;re still you. No one really cares if it takes you a second to remember just the right word you are thinking of because they all do the same thing too. If these evil drugs ever became legal they could finally do some real science and start giving us some real harm prevention ideas but for right now most everything we have is based on rats and hearsay. I&#039;m pretty sure that the average dose of MDMA will eventually be associated with the same risk factors as a bacon double cheese burger, large order of fries and a tall Mt. Dew. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s my rant. I really didn&#039;t feel like I could join a drug forum without going off on at least one senseless tangent about how drugs are bad but so is everything else in the world.<br /><br />Long Live the Road! <br />

A daily dosage of 100mg, typically at night time, the week up to but NOT the day prior is the best use. For instance, you&#039;re rolling on Saturday. Start taking 5-HTP Sunday-Thursday (not Friday, this is to avoid the potential for serotonin syndrome). 5-HTP is also great for post-loading the week after using the same dosages. It typically isn&#039;t advised that 5-HTP be taken on a daily basis for very extended periods of time, so utilize it for pre/post-loading. As for St. Johns Wort, I&#039;ve heard extremely varied reports regarding its use and it is very dependent on your body chemistry. I personally experienced terrible results whereas others swear by it, so test it out and see how it works for you.<br /><br />In any case, I&#039;m sorry to say that you have most assuredly damaged your brain, even though you may not notice it significantly. There are a few studies where researchers would pump primates with MDMA, and even with 90% serotonin reduction and after obliterating their serotonin systems, the monkeys appeared to function completely normally. However, once they pried into their brains they found absolute destruction of these serotonin systems. MDMA damage is much more insidious and subtle in its damage than nearly any other drug that we have access to, and I assure you, if you were able to take a look at your own brain, you would think differently.<br /><br />I highly advise you start exercising and eating a very healthy diet. Exercise stimulates a release of BDNF which encourages the growth of new serotonin axons and is used as a form of therapy in almost all types of brain injuries, so this will aide in your recovery tenfold. I can&#039;t stress it enough to individuals that DIET AND EXERCISE are the KEYS to enjoying recreational drugs to their fullest. Respect your body, respect the substances, and your brain will respect you.<br /><br />+1 DiamondSky, thank you for your contribution to this thread. :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg687634#msg687634">Quote from: chil on December 28, 2012, 12:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does Animus Vox or anyone else would know if the following statement happens to be true ?

Tyrosine is partially non-enzymatically converted to dopamine, which in turn leads to free radicals and this is a potential cause of neurotoxicity.

I got some great stuff from one of the top vendors on the road. Now Im a large male 200+ so the first time I tried it I took 200mg and kinda rolled but not great while my friend had the time of there lives, next time I dosed 340mg and had the time of my life, It was amazing and just right, except I redosed twice :( but hey Im trying to do better from now on. But why does it take me so much while everyone is having an amazing time at 200mg everything has been tested with marquise mecke and simons btw<br /><br />cheers =)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I&#039;m right there with you as a big guy and normally does a bit more than my girlfriend when we roll. There&#039;s quite a bit to keep in mind with MDMA though in that the roll can be effected by how much each of you ate, how recently, stomach acid, etc.. Trying to make sure you are both on empty stomachs and maybe dosing with some Tums to even out stomach acids a few minutes before the drop will normally help get you both to the same place. There are lots of dosing guides that talk about 1.5mg/1kg and that might help keep you in the ballpark. I&#039;m 250 and normally roll pretty good off 200mg but I&#039;ll often bump another 200mg a few hours in. If for some reason I&#039;m not feeling it like my traveling partner I can always sniff or plug another little top off to get me to the right place.<br /><br />Most people say MDMA is MDMA but honestly every batch is a little different ride for me. Sometimes I need more with one stash than another. The tests only show if something is in the drug, not what else is in there or in what quantities. <br /><br />With my girlfriend a good bit lighter than me our doses are still pretty similar in strength. I think I up mine more for the confidence that it&#039;ll get me high more than any real requirement for 20-30% more to get high.<br /><br />Anyway, be careful but a bit more for us big guys doesn&#039;t seem to hurt too much. It&#039;s normally a good idea to order enough of the same stuff so that you can have a feeling it out night followed by a full on party night. I know for some of the stashes I&#039;ve pulled from 340mg would be an uncomfortable ride up and with others it would be just right. So checking at lower doses first is never a bad idea.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Weight plays a huge factor in dosing, as well as natural tolerance due to body chemistry and other variables. As with any substance, you need to find the appropriate dosage that is both right and safe for you. The 1.5mg/Kg guideline is just that, a GUIDELINE, and should be used so you can further determine what your optimum dosage is. For instance, I have found that that 160mg to be the absolute perfect dosage for me. If I were to follow the guideline given my body weight, however, I would be dosing 120mg which ends up being only a moderately intense roll. The key here is to maintain your optimum dosage and not vary it every time you roll. This, in my opinion, is one of the big problems that people experience with tolerance: inconsistencies in dosing. Obviously tolerance is a huge unknown to us at present, but I personally feel this is one of the factors that play a part in it (along with individuals taking it too often) .<br /><br />The thought that every batch is different drives into the fact that washing your product is very wise as it will allow for the most precise of dosing. If you wash and recrystallize your product thoroughly, there should be very little difference in the dosing between one vendor and the other as you have removed the chemical impurities that would lead into variable dosages. Pure MDMA is pure MDMA is pure MDMA. WASH! YOUR! PRODUCT!<br /><br />Cheers, my friends. Keep the discussion flowing! I love hearing everyone&#039;s questions, thoughts, and additions on the matter. :)

				Have done mdma for over twenty years, I have a couple of tips that I find rather helpful.<br /><br />Drink water beforehand. ..during....after.<br />Have 5-HTP. ...afterwards. 300mg....and 100mgs for the next four days.<br />Sunshine. ....early morning sunshine to recharge. <br />Ocean...if you live near the sea...jump in..!<br />Fruit....have lots of fresh fruit the following day....load your body with fruit energy.<br />Food...fresh, raw...living.<br />Exercise. ...gym,&nbsp; walking,&nbsp; running, swimming. <br />Thinking....repeat positive thoughts and sayings to yourself. <br />Moderation. ....once a month..max.<br /><br />In my experience, the abovementioned are integral in enjoying the benefits of mdma whilst giving your body and mind good harm minimisation principles.<br /><br />These principles, alone, will bring additional health benefits to you.

				<br />Pure MDMA is also very interesting as it can be any number of &#039;mixtures&#039;....and depending upon the mixture, different potential neurotoxic levels.<br /><br />There are two geometrically distinct enantiomers of MDMA: <br /><br />R- Isomer, happens to be weaker and has a more psychedelic/chill out effect and the S+ Isomer, which is far more stimulating. Depending upon the % of each, one could have a more chilled out experience or a more &#039;speedy&#039; experience. <br /><br />R-Isomer is, apparently, less nerotoxic than the S+ Isomer.<br /><br />However the preferred MDMA is Racemic MDMA. Racemic MDMA&nbsp; is generally a mixture of the two, usually 50/50 and it&#039;s this combination that gives MDMA it&#039;s magic. It&#039;s the synergistic effect of both isomers.<br /><br />So you could potentially have quite a number of different % combinations of R- and S+ and many different levels of potential neurotoxicity.<br /><br />In any event, I think it will be sometime until long term documented studies bear light on the matter. But in the meantime play it safe, test your products and maintain a sensible, cautious approach.....and have fun!!<br />

				Thank you for all the tips everyone. I really just got into MDMA and like my experiances to be intense compared to what others may injoy. Im well experianced in mushrooms and lsd at heroic doses. So maybe on lower doses of MDMA i just dont feel that high. When I dosed 200mg from UGS I felt it but i was not really rolling that good, like 1 fot in on foot out. I even bumped another 50mg a few hours in somewhat of a let down.&nbsp; So next time I didnt eat for 7hrs ate 100mg 5htp for 4 days prior and did not take htp for over 24hr before drop time, preloaded with ALA and vitamine C&nbsp; and parchuted a 340mg bomb and WOW. I felt it coming hard in 15 min!!!! I have to admit the comeup was intense, I got a little worried for a few minutes but just rode the wave and wow was it amazing. Probably the highest Ive ever been in my entire life. Extream love, my body was floating off the ground major eye wiggles double vision and the ability to destroy the dance floor lol, awsome show I was at btw. But i also redosed 100mg cap at +2 and +3 stupid I know but i never wanted that high to end. So anyways next day standard hang over but not to bad. Threw down a couple norco 10&#039;s to help as well. more vitamin c and ALA. but something weird happened 3 days later which is why I was worried i might have had minor S&gt;S&gt;. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So # days later I had cheast pain and presure in my cheast it was weird. Didnt hurt very bad but something was off, so I went to the dr. right away, they did ekg blood presure etc. and everything was normal they told me to take zantac for heartburn for 3 days and come back if I was stillin pain. Still felt it for 3 days but after the 3rd day it was gone and hasnt came back since. Also one day I was driving on the highway to an apt. and I felt super disy almost like I was going to faint which has never happened before. Then when I would smoke weed it was almosdt like I waS rolling again for a whole week. None of this happens anymore and I feel fine, can smoke etc np, but it has left me a little worried. So I feel 5htp might have something to do with it cause ive consumed this amount before in a well know press verified on pill reports to contain 100mg mdma , tested and consumed 6pills, shit I get outa hand when im flyin high lol. So any thoughts guys? Oh and i have been piped before and it was one of the worst nights of my life FUCK BZP thx guys =)

				Oh one more thing have you guys ever seen anything like this??<br /><br />Got some great molly off the road a few times, small moon rocks of white maybe a little yellow but toatlly white when crushed. Amazing rolls. Anyways my favorite vendor was selling very dark mdma which I read was bad not properly washed etc. So I decided to try a new vendor with great feedback tons of transaction great reviews. His looked to be the same off white ive been getting. Anyways I get the package fast but what i find inside im not to happy with. Everything is already crushed and it is brown/light brown, def not tan but BROWN. It does not have the shimmer or crystaly look my other stuff had when held in the light. It smeels VERY strongly of liquorice where my other stuff was very faint smell. It is also somewhat sticky, sticks to the bag a little more and also if I squeze it together it clups together momentairly. Now here is the kicker, i did marquise mecke and simons test and it passed with flying colors, very fast and strong reaction mdma positive. And alot of other people gave this product great reviews saying it was flame. Im big on harm reduction and have been piped in the past horrible time and actully thats how i found this site ;) So what does everyone think? Throw it out and get new stuff only a g not much of a loss, try acatone wash? Never done before but think I can after reading about it. Leave as is and try a small test dose 1st, thx for your help everyone

				well thats my whole concer erowid list 200mg as STRONG but for me it feels week and my friends fell like 150-180 is super strong on the same gear. But for me i need around 300mg for 1st dose to get going good. one time i dosed 200mg then 200mg +1 hr and another 100mg +2 same gear and my roll wasnt even half the roll as the 340 bomd i peaked in waves for like 6hours straight. But I do look back and say maybe that was too much I might dose 280mg for next bomb, any ideas oh and I wait aT LEAST 1 month each roll pre and post load vit c and ala, but i duno about 5htp i might not mess with that anymore, there is tons of good foods you can eat which are 5htp rich and natural. Maybe horrible comedown or minor SS but I dont think I will more than 300mg anymore and only 1 redose 1/3 of 1st amount hr later and that it. Or what does everone think og bumping it? I feel like if I take more after my fist dose that it does not have much effect?

				I agree with gtgeorge do some kandy flipping if you can. MDMA is great when taken with MDA and I mean in small doses. I like to start out with 200mg of straight mdma but if i got 50mg mda and 100 mg mdma then those two taken at the same time will be stronger and last a lot longer then just plain old 200mg mdma or even 250mg mdma I&#039;m telling you the mda added to the mdma is awesome and brought back the magic for me.<br /><br />I can see where my tolerance has already went from starting with 100mg orally to having to have 250 mg orally and that&#039;s even waiting for 2 weeks in between rolls. Yea I am going to invest in some mdma and mda to make them each last longer. There&#039;s no cross tolerance between mdma an mda so you can possibly take one in one night then trip or roll from the other in a consecutive nights!!<br /><br />What I like to do if I have 2 or more days off to roll is take a big dose of mdma say 250mg and roll pretty good from that or at least i would then the next night you can take 100mg or 50mg mda+200mg MDMA. You should see very limited amount o tolerance from that such mix on the second day but the third day you would have a tolerance built up to both compounds but not as much from the mda so you could take like 150mg mda+150 or 200mg MDMA.<br /><br />You just have to play with it and see how your body reacts to what you ingest and go from there. Be careful tho if your are going to be your own lab rat. Trust me I know lol.<br /><br />Sorry to but into this conversation but I am unusually talkative at this time. I would suggest you just eat your MDMA just swallow it with a soda or whatever you like to drink and don&#039;t forget to keep those fluids going you need to be sure and drink plenty of fluids on these compounds and pay real close attention to your body for signs of exhaustion or other signs from your body that may be meant is a warning for you to do something like drink something or whatever just be safe.

				Good Deal Man! yea it&#039;s always good to know thy self and by that i mean to know where your limits are at and what your tolerances are with certain drugs. I guess I got carried away with all that rambling on hahaha. <br /><br />I&#039;ve only done MDA once and that was with 100mg of mdma in a capsule with 50mg mda. Yea it was better than 250 mg of straight mdma. That one vendor has those mixed capsules for sale for not very long tho he&#039;s about to sell out. The only other place to get mda is from the ilf and you have to buy at least a gram to get it domestically. Have you ever tried just MDA?<br /><br />I think it&#039;s like a precursor to MDMA there&#039;s only one more step to turn it into MDMA

				This is a nice informative post, but I think the &quot;dangers&quot; of neurotoxicity in MDMA are highly overblown.&nbsp; As a somewhat long term frequent user and having been around lots of other &quot;frequent&quot; users (easily more than once a month), there doesn&#039;t appear to be any serious repercussions from having a little fun with it.&nbsp; Of course, we&#039;re talking people who don&#039;t go overboard with it (under 300mg in any one night), and usually only use once on random weekends.<br /><br />I still think there should be some caution when using MDMA and especially if you want to do it within 1-2 weeks of each other, but honestly after years of rolls and friends who&#039;ve rolled for stretches of back-to-back weekends over the course of a month here and there it really doesn&#039;t appear to have that dramatic of an effect on our every day lives.&nbsp; Other than the suicide tuesday depression that is.&nbsp; We all are holding steady, good jobs, too if that means anything to this counter argument.<br /><br />This is also all assuming you&#039;re rolling on particularly well made MD too, all the molly i&#039;ve found on the road since I started shopping here has been exceptional, so I&#039;d have even less fear of the side effects knowing its clean gear.

MDMA is great when taken with MDA and I mean in small doses. I like to start out with 200mg of straight mdma but if i got 50mg mda and 100 mg mdma then those two taken at the same time will be stronger and last a lot longer then just plain old 200mg mdma or even 250mg mdma I&#039;m telling you the mda added to the mdma is awesome and brought back the magic for me.<br /><br />I can see where my tolerance has already went from starting with 100mg orally to having to have 250 mg orally and that&#039;s even waiting for 2 weeks in between rolls. Yea I am going to invest in some mdma and mda to make them each last longer. There&#039;s no cross tolerance between mdma an mda so you can possibly take one in one night then trip or roll from the other in a consecutive nights!!<br /><br />What I like to do if I have 2 or more days off to roll is take a big dose of mdma say 250mg and roll pretty good from that or at least i would then the next night you can take 100mg or 50mg mda+200mg MDMA. You should see very limited amount o tolerance from that such mix on the second day but the third day you would have a tolerance built up to both compounds but not as much from the mda so you could take like 150mg mda+150 or 200mg MDMA.<br /><br />You just have to play with it and see how your body reacts to what you ingest and go from there. Be careful tho if your are going to be your own lab rat. Trust me I know lol.<br /><br />Sorry to but into this conversation but I am unusually talkative at this time. I would suggest you just eat your MDMA just swallow it with a soda or whatever you like to drink and don&#039;t forget to keep those fluids going you need to be sure and drink plenty of fluids on these compounds and pay real close attention to your body for signs of exhaustion or other signs from your body that may be meant is a warning for you to do something like drink something or whatever just be safe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This &quot;advice&quot; completely contradicts everything we have established in this thread, ralph123, and also has a lot of false information. You are not treating MDMA or MDA with respect and are rolling far too often, my friend. Your statements that MDMA and MDA do not exhibit a cross tolerance are completely false as they have an affinity for the same receptors, and MDA has been said to be even more neurotoxic than MDMA. You are also completely missing the point regarding MDMA tolerance: you are depleted of the natural chemicals that produce a proper roll, and by ingesting more MDMA/MDA you are only prolonging the restoration process, and this is largely the cause for the tolerance you experience. Boosting your dosage the following days is very ill advised, and continual usage in such a manner will severely damage your brain. Please, stop spreading misinformation based on your particular experiences that contradict well established medical literature.<br /><br />Jopular, please completely read the first post of this thread and follow gtgeorgz advice regarding dosage.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg696542#msg696542">Quote from: Theaides on January 02, 2013, 12:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is a nice informative post, but I think the &quot;dangers&quot; of neurotoxicity in MDMA are highly overblown.&nbsp; As a somewhat long term frequent user and having been around lots of other &quot;frequent&quot; users (easily more than once a month), there doesn&#039;t appear to be any serious repercussions from having a little fun with it.&nbsp; Of course, we&#039;re talking people who don&#039;t go overboard with it (under 300mg in any one night), and usually only use once on random weekends.<br /><br />I still think there should be some caution when using MDMA and especially if you want to do it within 1-2 weeks of each other, but honestly after years of rolls and friends who&#039;ve rolled for stretches of back-to-back weekends over the course of a month here and there it really doesn&#039;t appear to have that dramatic of an effect on our every day lives.&nbsp; Other than the suicide tuesday depression that is.&nbsp; We all are holding steady, good jobs, too if that means anything to this counter argument.<br /><br />This is also all assuming you&#039;re rolling on particularly well made MD too, all the molly i&#039;ve found on the road since I started shopping here has been exceptional, so I&#039;d have even less fear of the side effects knowing its clean gear.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t believe the dangers are overblown and caution needs to be taken when taking ANY recreational drug, especially when there are a lot of unknowns regarding the substance. Everyone&#039;s experiences obviously vary, but the simple fact is that MDMA is neurotoxic and it needs to be used responsibly. Long-term effects (speaking 40-50 years from now) are still completely unknown, and just because you do not exhibit any negative effects does not mean you aren&#039;t damaging your brain. As I stated previously in the thread, there are a few studies where researchers would pump primates with MDMA, and even with 90% serotonin reduction and after obliterating their serotonin systems, the monkeys appeared to function completely normally. However, once they pried into their brains they found absolute destruction of these serotonin systems. MDMA damage is much more insidious and subtle in its damage than nearly any other drug that we have access to, and I assure you, if you were able to take a look at your own brain, you would think differently. <br /><br />I am in a position in life that offers me with access to a great deal of research regarding substances and I have taken a great interest in MDMA and wish to share the wealth of information I have acquired over the years. All these statements I back are not simple hearsay and are well established within the medical community, and for anyone that values their cognitive health, much attention should be paid. At the end of the day, however, it&#039;s obviously up to the end user&#039;s discretion. The only thing I can do is pass along information. It&#039;s how well you utilize this information that matters.<br /><br />Cheers and safe travels, my friends.

				No argument to be had, friend, just a civil discussion! :)<br /><br />I agree with you that there is still MUCH research to be had and I cannot wait until the day we can research these recreational drugs more thoroughly, but in the time being, I will continue following these guidelines and will advise others to do the same! Also, there&#039;s certainly many variables that are still unknown and there are definitely individuals that seem to exhibit negative effects much more than others. Some people may very well be resistant to MDMA&#039;s neurotoxic effects while other individuals very sensitive. It&#039;s one of those things that will hopefully be one day well established.

				Its when I roll more than once every 4 weeks the depression becomes quite bad, I usually take 240/250mg a night. Its only when I&#039;ve rolled 2 weekends in a row that the depression has become more noticeable, only seems to effect me in the mornings and evenings though for 2/3days after? <br />I stick to a pre/post loading regime that consists of 5htp (post roll), vitamins and antioxidants as well as a healthy diet as I do believe this helps a lot and helps retain some of the so called &#039;magic&#039;.<br />I haven&#039;t lost a significant amount magic and the last time i rolled which was spaced out just a week before the last time I dropped was probably the best roll of my life. I think it has a lot to with set and setting. Although the second time I ever dropped MDMA was probably the most powerful roll I&#039;ve ever had. I do believe there is a sweet spot for MDMA dosage as well; too much and anxiety can start to creep in, too little and there&#039;s not much of a roll. Mine is a 160mg starting dose followed by a 70mg redose. <br />Next time I roll which will be towards the end of this month I&#039;ll be doing a combo of 100mg MDMA + 50mg MDA with a redose of 70mg MDMA and possibly a second redose of the same, I will report back about the comedown effects. Last time I rolled was 14th dec so it&#039;ll be just over a months break. Interesting to see how MDA will effect the comedown..

				Great thread with great info and more people should see this.&nbsp; As someone with a degree in neuroscience and a few pharmacology courses under my belt, I can concur with AnimusVox on the advice, although these practices would be on the extreme side of caution.&nbsp; For those who have been using MDMA for many years with no noticeable side-effects, this doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that no damage has been done.&nbsp; If I could slice up your brains and stain for serotonin receptors, we would probably see a depletion as well as damage to serotonergic axon terminals.&nbsp; While this effect may not be noticeable, it&#039;s still there, and continued use would add up until effects are seen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I have &quot;binged&quot; on molly before knowing the consequences although I am not a long-time user.&nbsp; Now, I spread out rolls at least 2 weeks, usually.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get a chance to read through all the pages but I also take NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) a few hours prior to rolling (it can be purchased at any vitamin shop).&nbsp; It is a precursor to glutathione, which is your body&#039;s strongest anti-oxidant and has been shown to be depleted after MDMA administration.&nbsp; Of course, I exercise a lot, which is one of the best ways to upregulate serotonin production.&nbsp; I also usually take 5-HT after rolling as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, eat healthy, exercise, and be smart.&nbsp; I might post a 15 page write-up on MDMA&#039;s effects on the body that I did a few years back if I still have it.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				That article is phenomenal in all regards and brings up a tremendous amount of valid points, but I still feel until we can further establish MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity that great caution should be taken. Individuals that dose obscene amounts in one sitting and redose hours after initial ingestion are the ones most prone to MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity, and are ALSO the ones that do not exercise proper harm reduction techniques. These are the individuals that witness the most damage. His conclusion essentially wraps up the entire point of this thread, and that is HARM REDUCTION. The bottom line is everyone needs to research the drugs they ingest and respect them absolutely and completely.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I absolutely believe that MDMA can be neurotoxic in humans. There&#039;s just no reason to believe that it is at a sane dosage/under normal circumstances, and your odds can be greatly improved with a little common sense: Don&#039;t mix drugs, be aware of overheating dangers, and take some antioxidants.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On another note, I just read an absolutely phenomenal writeup over on reddit (any DrugNerds subscribers out there?) with the theory that MDA may be the root cause for MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity, which further establishes the idea that MDA is more neurotoxic than MDMA. I&#039;ve quoted the writeup below, but you can find the CLEARNET link here: http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/13lp0b/mdma_neurotoxicity_part_1_metabolites/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is probably going to be the first in a series of discussions I start about MDMA. There&#039;s just too much information for one post. Therefore, I am going to start with one that is very interesting to me: MDMA&#039;s metabolites and their role in neurotoxicity. I pre-appologise for the length and terminology used.<br /><br />First off, let&#039;s discuss how MDMA is metabolized. The human cytochrome CYP450 is responsible for the metabolism of MDMA. The primary enzyme responsible is CYP2D6, using O-demethylation. This process adds two hydrogen atoms to the two open oxygen atoms in MDMA to create HHMA. Let&#039;s look at the structure for a minute.<br /><br />MDMA is 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine<br /><br />HHMA is 3,4-dihydroxy-N-methylamphetamine<br /><br />So your CYP2D6 enzyme added two hydrogen atoms to the methylenedioxy structure to create a dihydroxy structure. Once it&#039;s been o-demethylated to HHMA, it is no longer active like MDMA is. HHMA can then be 0-methylated further to HMMA, or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine. Here is an image to help you visualize this process. (http://imgur.com/RY6Mt)<br /><br />This is the primary route of metabolism.<br /><br />Is that the end of the story? Nope! Yes MDMA is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. However, a portion of your dose (~10%) is also metabolized by your CYP3A4 enzyme using N-demethylation. What substance is created by this process? MDA, or 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. You see, this time your CYP3A4 enzyme changed the methyl group at the N position, and not the O position. This modified the methyl group into an amine group. We are now left with MDMA&#039;s more neurotoxic brother in our blood stream.<br /><br />Let&#039;s add this into the picture from above. (http://imgur.com/xTDcQ)<br /><br />MDA is then metabolized in the exact same manner MDMA was, o-demetylation by CYP2D6. So we add two hydrogen atoms to the O position to create HHA, or 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine. So we essentially end up with HHMA with an amine group at the N position instead of a methyl group. It can also be o-methylated further (like HHMA) into HMA 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine. Same thing as HMMA, just with an amine group instead of the methyl group.<br /><br />So at this point you might be thinking how this all really matters. Well MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain have been shown (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11351932) to NOT be neurotoxic. Well shit, there we go. Metabolism is to blame.<br /><br />Not so fast! A study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1908797/pdf/brjpharm00190-0167.pdf) showed that individuals with lower CYP2D6 did not show lower neurotoxicity. In fact, they showed slightly higher. It may have led (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874389/) to some deaths as well. This led to the notion being tabled for a while.<br /><br />So what is up then? Well where is the next logical place to look? Perhaps CYP3A4!!!!!<br /><br />A person that has a genetic condition resulting in lower CYP2D6 enzyme is going to have what happen to their MDMA? A greater percentage will be N-demethylated to MDA by CYP3A4.<br /><br />This is going to lead to what? Higher HHA serum levels.<br /><br />HHA is what? A potent neurotoxin! (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)<br /><br />So MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain show NO neurotoxicity. Individuals with lower CYP2D6 enzyme show higher levels of neurotoxicity. This leads me to believe that HHMA is not the primary culprit (probably still a factor though).<br /><br />MDA has been shown to be much more neurotoxic than MDMA. MDA is NOT neurotoxic when directly injected into the brain. MDA cannot be metabolized into HHMA, but is directly metabolized to HHA. HHA is a potent neurotoxin.<br /><br />Is anybody smelling what I am cooking over here?!? MDA is the cause of MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity through metabolism to HHA (Also known as alpha-methyldopamine). BOOM!<br /><br />Alpha-methyldopamine causes neurotoxicity. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128836)<br /><br />Another link (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)<br /><br />And another! (http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/37/7/1448.full.pdf)<br /><br />Now I have been taking quercetin and grapefruit juice with my MDMA for a while now. These substances are CYP3A4 inhibitors. I knew that CYP3A4 metabolized part of my dose to MDA. I knew it was more neurotoxic, which is why I did this. However, I did not connect the dots as to why it was more neurotoxic.<br /><br />Many postulated it was because of MDA&#039;s higher affinity for dopamine. However, why then did direct injections of it in the brain not cause neurotoxicity? If it was dopamine being re-uptaked by your SERT that was causing the damage, it would still be present when MDMA or MDA was directly injected into the brain. In fact, it would be higher. Yet we saw NO neurotoxicity.<br /><br />Others were skeptical because the metabolism to HHA was only seen in rats. However, the 2009 study proved it happened in humans too! So hot damn, I am pretty sure this is a verifiable theory here. We definitely need studies to prove it though.<br /><br />TL;DR I postulate that MDMA induced 5-HT neurotoxicity arises from the metabolism to MDA, consequently creating HHA or alpha-methyldopamine. Another route of neurotoxicy comes from the ring-hydroxylation of MDA to THA, or 2,4,5-trihydroxyamphetamine. Inhibit CYP3A4 using grapefruit juice to stop the metabolism to MDA and prevent both metabolites from being created.<br /><br />Now do NOT take what I am saying as the end all and be all of potential MDMA induced damage. There is excitotoxicity at your ion channels, as well as other oxidative damage that can come into play. I will speak to these in other posts. This has also not been proven yet. So please take this post as a starting point, not a final answer. Feel free to pick apart my theory and find anything that I may have overlooked. I would rather be wrong and find the truth, then think I&#039;m right and perpetuate a fallacy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				@AnimusVox<br />Tomorrow night I will be ingesting both MDMA &amp; MDA in combination and my pre-load consists of large quantities of ALA, Vit. C and Vit. E. My post load is the same but with added 5htp. <br />I&#039;m just wondering do you take MDMA? If so, what is your pre/post load regime you follow? Is there anything more you can recommend I take to help my brain?

				I definitely do, and will actually be candyflipping next weekend with a group of friends! :) My personal pre-load /post-load regimen is as follows:<br /><br />Alpha Lipoic Acid: 200mg 1 hour prior, then every two hours in<br />Co-Q10: 100mg 1 hour prior<br />Magnesium glycinate: 2000mg (200mg elemental mg) 6 hours prior, 1 hour prior, and 3 hours in<br />Vitamin C: 1000mg 1 hour prior, 3 hours in<br />Vitamin E: 100mg 1 hour prior<br /><br />Once I am done rolling (T+7:00 typically), I will fix myself a bowl of tomato basil soup and saltine crackers to go along with my post-load regimen, which is as follows:<br /><br />Full cycle of Orange Triad Multivitamin (6 pills)<br />200mg 5-HTP, as well as the week after<br /><br />In all honesty, don&#039;t ingest LARGE amounts of these supplements. The recommended dosages are typically spot on and should be advised. The key thing is timing, in my opinion. I will also note that I take a nootropic stack of piracetam and choline that I take every day (2400mg/600mg morning, 1600mg/600mg afternoon), and I have found that this greatly potentiates MDMA and smooths the roll out as well. It also works wonders with LSD and other psychedelics, too. Cheers!

				doctor OZ(TV doctor) bites his vitamins in half and takes half in the morning half at night for better absorption.<br />(If you read the dea.org then you&#039;ll know what I know)I think that MDMA isn&#039;t really neurotoxic by definition but just about everything is somewhat neurotoxic SO YOUR FEARMOGERING SUCKS. As far as I know the only way to kill brain cells (basicaly) with MDMA is if you get a temperature.If you have a temperature then MDMA will do what amoral people say and turn your brain into Swiss cheese as well as hurting possibly destroying organs. As for brain chemistry getting out of wack theirs no permanent damage. <br /><br />From &quot; http://thedea.org/hangover.html &quot; Human research suggests that it takes about a month for your brain to fully return to the state it was in before taking MDMA. Give it a month between uses and you should keep feeling fine (for some people, even once a month is too often in the long run.) If you push it, however, (such as weekly use) the severity and length of the &#039;hangover&#039; period can grow much worse as the regular disruptions of your brain&#039;s serotonin system add up. That&#039;s not to say weekly use will cause medical harm, but you may find yourself feeling like crap much of the time. The reason is that, besides temporarily depleting serotonin reserves, your brain &#039;adjusts the volume&#039; on the serotonin system in response to the massive serotonin release caused by MDMA. With very heavy use (several times a week) users can become quite dysfunctional (panic attacks, major memory/concentration problems, in some cases amphetamine psychosis has been reported.)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Responsible drug use means moderation. MDMA can be a very seductive drug, making it hard for some people to resist the urge to run out and repeat the experience as soon and as often as possible, but if you go overboard, regardless of the drug used, you will pay a price for it. The poet Blake said that the path of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. That&#039;s true, but when you drag your tired, fried, hung-over ass up to the gates of that palace you realize that wisdom was moderation in the first place. Been there, done that.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you overindulge, you will recover (it&#039;s a mistake to assume that these somewhat long-term disruptions are signs of brain damage) but it&#039;s no fun in the meanwhile. Some people just have to learn this lesson for themselves, but take it from the many thousands of users who have taken this road before: It isn&#039;t worth it. Once a month is fine. You might get away with twice a month for a while. But very few people seem to be able to get away with weekly use for long. Be sensitive to your own mental state, and if you start to feel a little emotionally unstable or more tired/forgetful than usual, take a break for several months. Your brain will thank you.<br />&nbsp;<br />(From me)One of your references for the article possible health risks of MDMA and methamphetamine was Ricard who&#039;s a frad and if thats where your getting your info then its wrong I read some of it and couldn&#039;t even understand it all it was very technical. http://www.thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html is my main source of info http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_media1.shtml next and to cut this shorter MDMA has been found to be less harmful for the user and far less harmful for society then alcohol from http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/dancing-with-molly-20121203-2ar04.html&nbsp; .

The real trick is that I know hardly anyone who ONLY does MDMA and most the &quot;studies&quot; are made up of similarly unknown drug combinations within people or just with those poor overdosed lab rats. So saying MDMA is dangerous is a little over generalized in my mind simply because we can&#039;t do any real tests on live people to confirm one way or another how any potential damage is done specifically by the drug and specifically in humans and at what specific dosing curves. <br /><br />The more obvious reason for most people to limit their MDMA use is that it really is a magical drug that in the right hands and that magic seems to diminish over time with too much abuse. I do sort of agree that based on what I have seen through my little life, alcohol, tobacco and processed foods are more destructive to a larger portion of the population as a whole than dropping a few hits of MDMA every month or two. For me, if the cost of admission to the wonderland that is an MDMA high turns out to be a little brain damage I&#039;m okay with that risk.<br /><br />Personally I would just love for the drug to be legalized so that real research can be brought forth to find out what damage really is possible and what ways their are to mitigate it. Honestly I think it&#039;s one of the biggest crimes in the war on drugs that we all have to jump into this with little to no real information about how it will affect us in the long term when in truth there are probably some simple steps we could all take to make this drug as safe as dropping an aspirin if only we knew more about it. <br /><br /><br />

Yes, my advice may be on the extreme side of caution, but until we further understand the neurotoxic effects of MDMA in humans, I am going to spread the information in hopes that people will find it valuable. Obviously you don&#039;t find this information valuable, so continue using MDMA however you wish to. After all, at the end of the day it is up to the user&#039;s discrection, but I hope that in the future you will come to truly respect the drug. Also, I&#039;m well aware that alcohol is more harmful to you than MDMA, but that does not mean you shouldn&#039;t exercise caution when ingesting a recreational drug of ANY type. Good luck to you.

				Whatever you could rename the topic. I edited my earlier post alot so its worth a reread.Ok history lesson the U.S. war on drugs was started by Richard Nixon I&#039;d say to destroy the hippie movements fuel in his mind. Not sure what the current government gains by the war on drugs. leap.cc is an interesting site for people who would like to see legalization and regulation of all drugs.<br /><br />Im way more interested in the stuff that&#039;s with the mdma just from making it how harmful is that stuff if at all with the mdma. Like theirs poisonis ingredients for alot of the ways to make it and all kinds of paint thinner and stuff idk after heating and mixing then getting mostly mdma like 80% by washing with alcohol and letting it evaporate whats in the last 20% can anybody tell me a method of making it and using that method what stuff is in it at the end and how harmful it is(possibly no harm).<br /><br />If you read the dea.org i don&#039;t even remember what the study group from a legitimate study took mayby it was mdma as pure as the average person can make from random street sources mayby it was made legitamatly anyway in that test no permant brain damage.<br /><br />Look on http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=97162.0 for more details.<br /><br />

				This is an amazing post. I only roll about 3-4 times a year, and each roll has a 2-3 months break in between. However, I have friends who roll 3-4 times A WEEK, and they’ve been doing this for almost a year now. The last time that I rolled with them was on the NYE. I must have taken at least 600mg of MDMA throughout the night. For the next two weeks afterward, I was depressed and contemplated suicide. That was one of the worst experiences of my life.

				I was under the impression it shows to be neurotoxic as the internal body temperature rises, i.e. at raves. Is that true? I really only do it at music festivals is why I ask. I space out rolls a MINIMUM of 1 month, with there often being larger gaps between some, is this alright? Since buying product strictly off the SR, I&#039;ve been taking far, far smaller doses (20mg/kg roughly), which usually ends up at 130mg for me, with a small booster of about 40mg when i hit the peak. <br /><br />Also, what are people&#039;s knowledge about rolling twice in one weekend on smaller doses? I&#039;m going to Coachella this April and would like to be able to roll two days of the three, taking minimal amounts, not doing a half gram or anything ridiculous... If i take only 150mg will I be depleting all of my serotonin reserves, will this render the second roll wasteful? What If i pre/post loaded with vitamins &amp; 5-HTP? <br /><br />Also on the note of 5-HTP, does it enhance rolls if you take some doses the week leading up to a roll? A friend told me that its really only necessary for afterwords but I could see it proving beneficial a priori. Let me know what insight you have on my situation!

Is that true? I really only do it at music festivals is why I ask. I space out rolls a MINIMUM of 1 month, with there often being larger gaps between some, is this alright? Since buying product strictly off the SR, I&#039;ve been taking far, far smaller doses (20mg/kg roughly), which usually ends up at 130mg for me, with a small booster of about 40mg when i hit the peak. <br /><br />Also, what are people&#039;s knowledge about rolling twice in one weekend on smaller doses? I&#039;m going to Coachella this April and would like to be able to roll two days of the three, taking minimal amounts, not doing a half gram or anything ridiculous... If i take only 150mg will I be depleting all of my serotonin reserves, will this render the second roll wasteful? What If i pre/post loaded with vitamins &amp; 5-HTP? <br /><br />Also on the note of 5-HTP, does it enhance rolls if you take some doses the week leading up to a roll? A friend told me that its really only necessary for afterwords but I could see it proving beneficial a priori. Let me know what insight you have on my situation!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A raise in body temperature is definitely one of the prime components to MDMA induced neurotoxicity as oxidative stress rises as your body temperature rises. <br /><br />Rolling two days in a row is ill advised and you won&#039;t normally have as effective of a roll as the first day due to being depleted of serotonin. Since I gather you&#039;re going to do this anyway, I would definitely not roll for at least 3 months (preferably more) leading up until Coachella so to allow for optimum restoration and to prepare your brain for what you&#039;re about to put it through. You would also need to take a higher dosage on the second day. Personally, I would take another substance on one of the days (LSD or 2C-B would be fantastic) but it&#039;s up to you in the end. Just be safe, my friend.<br /><br />There is some controversy whether or not taking 5-HTP in the week leading up to a roll will potentiate the roll or not, so it&#039;s typically up to the end user. If you feel the need to preload with 5-HTP, be sure you stop taking 5-HTP two days PRIOR to rolling in order to avoid the potential for serotonin syndrome. 5-HTP is typically best suited to be taken in the week following your roll at a moderate dose of 100mg.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg838506#msg838506">Quote from: dead salmon on February 19, 2013, 06:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Are there any scientific studies showing the efficacy of pre/post dosing of various vitamans &amp; supplements in reducing neurotoxicity?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you read the original post you&#039;ll notice links to a few studies at the bottom under &quot;Supplements/SSRIs&quot;.

				Well, I owe this thread a debt of brain cells. Couldn&#039;t be better timing for me. Rolled for the first time less than a week ago, and while I wasn&#039;t about to re-dose immediately, I certainly wasn&#039;t going to wait a month. In fact, I think I was set to wait a couple of weeks only because I intended to candyflip and am waiting out my psych tolerance/refractory period. I might very well have changed my mind and rolled again this weekend.<br /><br />And having learned of these issues mere days after my first time? You can imagine how disappointed I am. Grateful, but terribly disappointed.<br /><br />Another rare treat. It seems all I like are the rare treats. *sigh*&nbsp; :)

If you feel the need to preload with 5-HTP, be sure you stop taking 5-HTP two days PRIOR to rolling in order to avoid the potential for serotonin syndrome. 5-HTP is typically best suited to be taken in the week following your roll at a moderate dose of 100mg.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.msg838506#msg838506">Quote from: dead salmon on February 19, 2013, 06:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Are there any scientific studies showing the efficacy of pre/post dosing of various vitamans &amp; supplements in reducing neurotoxicity?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you read the original post you&#039;ll notice links to a few studies at the bottom under &quot;Supplements/SSRIs&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Didn&#039;t see that, oops.&nbsp; Well guess I&#039;ll have to start pre/post loading with some of these things now that there&#039;s some studies backing it up.&nbsp; Thanks OP and all, this thread is WIN.

If you take any SSRI&#039;s you won&#039;t feel much at all. If you take it on a full stomach with hard to digest food it might break down and get absorbed so slowly that you never feel it full force. Plus different people will have different reactions to the stuff just based on body chemistry.<br /><br />I&#039;d give the same dose another go on an empty stomach and maybe take an antiacid before hand since some people claim that helps and I don&#039;t see that it could cause much harm. If you&#039;re not in a good place in an hour to hour and a half I would bump 50-75 mg more at that point and see where that takes you. <br /><br />Personally, I just plug the stuff (liquid dilution up the bum) since it doesn&#039;t mater what I had to eat and gets more of the stuff into my system. Most people hate the idea (until they try it) but just mentioning it since it works great for me.<br /><br />I normally like to roll pretty hard and as a bigger guy that means about 200mg for me to get going well. Honestly though if you haven&#039;t rolled before and 150mg didn&#039;t get you going that&#039;s a little odd if something above isn&#039;t involved.<br /><br />And yes, the setting is HUGELY important from my experience. MDMA gives you the opportunity to drop all defenses and share bubbles of happiness with most anyone... but if you are in a place that makes you uncomfortable, around people you don&#039;t trust and on a drug you are afraid of you can absolutely dull the experience just by keeping your guard up. I&#039;ve lost many a roll in my time just because reality stepped in and needed to be dealt with. My best experiences are at home with my girl spending hours being in love. Safe, fun, predictable.

				Thanks for the advice DiamondSky. I have rolled a good few times before which is why I was confused as to the lack of effect with which that 150mg had, given that usually that would sort me out nicely.<br /><br />I do have to wonder if the medication I&#039;m on has an effect on my trip. It&#039;s not an SSRI however reported side effects of the drug have been depression.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found gumming to be effective in the past but never tried plugging, maybe I&#039;ll give it a go.

				Yeah MDMA can be a tricky one to get just right. Normally I like to find a supply I like and get a bunch of it because every batch seems to be a little different. Since it&#039;s not legal, we sort of deal with a lot of non-pharmaceutical grade stuff out there which means every batch will be different.<br /><br />I&#039;d definitely Google the drug to see if there are any interactions. There&#039;s so much traffic on Erowid and Bluelight that someone has likely tried to roll on it before.<br /><br />If you search these forums there&#039;s a guide on plugging, I wrote up my step by step a few pages in. Honestly if I&#039;m at home there&#039;s no reason not to plug and if I&#039;m out I normally just eat the stuff. <br /><br />Good luck!

In fact, MDA metabolites are actually thought to be the reason for MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity in the first place as MDA metabolizes into alpha-methyldopamine, which is a potent neurotoxin. I have quoted below a very thorough summation that explains this more in depth. In the end, you should definitely take precaution when ingesting MDA and be sure to practice the same harm reduction techniques as you would with MDMA. Unless you&#039;ve been consuming grams every weekend, I wouldn&#039;t worry too much. Our brain is an amazing machine and is extremely capable of repairing itself. With that said, I would definitely advise you to take a nice, long break (at least 3 months) and allow your brain to fully recover. Stay safe, brother, and start respecting the substance. Once you do that, it will respect you. :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First off, let&#039;s discuss how MDMA is metabolized. The human cytochrome CYP450 is responsible for the metabolism of MDMA. The primary enzyme responsible is CYP2D6, using O-demethylation. This process adds two hydrogen atoms to the two open oxygen atoms in MDMA to create HHMA. Let&#039;s look at the structure for a minute.<br /><br />MDMA is 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine<br />HHMA is 3,4-dihydroxy-N-methylamphetamine<br /><br />So your CYP2D6 enzyme added two hydrogen atoms to the methylenedioxy structure to create a dihydroxy structure. Once it&#039;s been o-demethylated to HHMA, it is no longer active like MDMA is. HHMA can then be 0-methylated further to HMMA, or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine. Here is an image to help you visualize this process (http://i.imgur.com/RY6Mt.jpg) <br /><br />This is the primary route of metabolism.<br /><br />Is that the end of the story? Nope! Yes MDMA is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. However, a portion of your dose (~10%) is also metabolized by your CYP3A4 enzyme using N-demethylation. What substance is created by this process? MDA, or 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. You see, this time your CYP3A4 enzyme changed the methyl group at the N position, and not the O position. This modified the methyl group into an amine group. We are now left with MDMA&#039;s more neurotoxic brother in our blood stream.<br /><br />Let&#039;s add this into the picture from above (http://i.imgur.com/xTDcQ.jpg).<br />&nbsp;<br />MDA is then metabolized in the exact same manner MDMA was, o-demetylation by CYP2D6. So we add two hydrogen atoms to the O position to create HHA, or 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine. So we essentially end up with HHMA with an amine group at the N position instead of a methyl group. It can also be o-methylated further (like HHMA) into HMA 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine. Same thing as HMMA, just with an amine group instead of the methyl group.<br /><br />So at this point you might be thinking how this all really matters. Well MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain have been shown (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11351932) to NOT be neurotoxic. Well shit, there we go. Metabolism is to blame.<br /><br />Not so fast! A study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1908797/pdf/brjpharm00190-0167.pdf) showed that individuals with lower CYP2D6 did not show lower neurotoxicity. In fact, they showed slightly higher. It may have led (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874389/) to some deaths as well. This led to the notion being tabled for a while.<br /><br />So what is up then? Well where is the next logical place to look? Perhaps CYP3A4!<br /><br />A person that has a genetic condition resulting in lower CYP2D6 enzyme is going to have what happen to their MDMA? A greater percentage will be N-demethylated to MDA by CYP3A4.<br /><br />This is going to lead to what? Higher HHA serum levels.<br /><br />HHA is what? A potent neurotoxin! (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)<br /><br />So MDMA and MDA injected directly into the brain show NO neurotoxicity. Individuals with lower CYP2D6 enzyme show higher levels of neurotoxicity. This leads me to believe that HHMA is not the primary culprit (probably still a factor though).<br /><br />MDA has been shown to be much more neurotoxic than MDMA. MDA is NOT neurotoxic when directly injected into the brain. MDA cannot be metabolized into HHMA, but is directly metabolized to HHA. HHA is a potent neurotoxin.<br /><br />Is anybody smelling what I am cooking over here?!? MDA is the cause of MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity through metabolism to HHA (Also known as alpha-methyldopamine). BOOM!<br /><br />Alpha-methyldopamine causes neurotoxicity. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128836)<br />Another link! (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378)<br />And another! (http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/37/7/1448.full.pdf)<br /><br />Now I have been taking quercetin and grapefruit juice with my MDMA for a while now. These substances are CYP3A4 inhibitors. I knew that CYP3A4 metabolized part of my dose to MDA. I knew it was more neurotoxic, which is why I did this. However, I did not connect the dots as to why it was more neurotoxic.<br /><br />Many postulated it was because of MDA&#039;s higher affinity for dopamine. However, why then did direct injections of it in the brain not cause neurotoxicity? If it was dopamine being re-uptaked by your SERT that was causing the damage, it would still be present when MDMA or MDA was directly injected into the brain. In fact, it would be higher. Yet we saw NO neurotoxicity.<br /><br />Others were skeptical because the metabolism to HHA was only seen in rats. However, the 2009 study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349378) proved it happened in humans too! So hot damn, I am pretty sure this is a verifiable theory here. We definitely need studies to prove it though.<br /><br />TL;DR I postulate that MDMA induced 5-HT neurotoxicity arises from the metabolism to MDA, consequently creating HHA or alpha-methyldopamine. Another route of neurotoxicy comes from the ring-hydroxylation of MDA to THA, or 2,4,5-trihydroxyamphetamine. <br /><br />Now do NOT take what I am saying as the end all and be all of potential MDMA induced damage. There is excitotoxicity at your ion channels, as well as other oxidative damage that can come into play. I will speak to these in other posts. This has also not been proven yet. So please take this post as a starting point, not a final answer. Feel free to pick apart my theory and find anything that I may have overlooked. I would rather be wrong and find the truth, then think I&#039;m right and perpetuate a fallacy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Further reading:<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2457659<br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784586<br />http://www.maps.org/publications/1987_stone_3.pdf

Moreover, the loss of 5-HTTs should be attenuated in animals given the combination of MDMA + MDL 11,939, as the latter drug is a selective 5-HT2A/2C antagonist. The results showed that MDMA-induced neurotoxicity was dose dependently increased by LSD.

				Thank you very much for the link to that study, badniff! Since I was completely taken aback by this study (and rather concerned since LSD + MDMA is my favorite combination!) and didn&#039;t have a thorough explanation regarding the findings of the study, I sought advice from a more knowledgeable individual.

What were the body temperatures of the groups?<br /><br />This makes sense, though. LSD is a 5-HT2a/b/c agonist. If you agonize 5-HT2c, your body temperature is going to rise. Remember all my ranting about body temperature and MDMA induced neurotoxicity? Higher body temps lead to higher 5-HT system damage. Hydroxyl radicals are the cause of the 5-HT system damage, but body temperature plays a huge role in how bad that damage is.<br /><br />So yes, LSD can exacerbate MDMA induced 5-HT system toxicity by agonizing the 5-HT2c receptors, consequently leading to increased body temperature, overwhelming your antioxidant systems. This study starts going off on a tangent about how since fluoxetine blocked 5-HT system damage even though temperatures rose, that means that temperature is not the cause. No shit dumbasses! Temperature is a mediating factor, not the cause. Alpha lipoic acid (a potent CNS antioxidant) also blocks 5-HT system damage even though temperature stays high. That does not mean your little experiment was a result of another mechanism surrounding 5-HT2a. MDL is a 5-HT2c antagonist as well, so it blocking the toxicity fits perfect with temperature rise being the factor here. They could have isolated that by taking body temp readings.<br /><br />Most of their postulations in the discussion are flawed. I&#039;ve read most of the studies they cite. There are some flaws in those studies as well, but it&#039;s mostly their interpretation of the studies that is the issue. I would be willing to bet that it was LSD&#039;s 5-HT2c agonism that led to a temperature increase, which exacerbated the MDMA induced toxicity by overwhelming the body&#039;s antioxidant system. It&#039;s not 5-HT2a agonism, it&#039;s the temperature increase.<br /><br />The two MDMA metabolites, 2,5-Bis-(glutathion-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine and 2,4,5-trihydroxyamphetamine, are to blame for the actual damage. Alpha lipoic acid binds to both and protects the axons from being damaged. Fluoxetine blocks the SERT, preventing the hydroxyl radicals from entering the neuron. It also happens to inhibit CYP3A4, preventing the metabolism to MDA in the first place. Both of those block 5-HT system damage, while body temperatures are still high. THC lowers MDMA induced 5-HT system toxicity as well, by lowering body temperature. It does not prevent metabolism, nor does it block the SERT. However, the lowering of body temperature allows the body&#039;s natural antioxidant systems to remain efficient. However, if you block the metabolism, you block the whole cause of the 5-HT system damage to begin with. THA and the gluthathione conjugate of alphamethyldopamine are the real assholes.<br /><br />So protecting from this is a threefold affair. One, block the metabolites by inhibiting CYP3A4. Two, keep your body temperature down. THC is good for this. Three, block your SERT at the end of your roll. Fluoxetine works well for this, as well as providing more CYP3A4 inhibition.<br /><br />So redo the study, but have the rats smoke some marijuana and see if the 5-HT system damage still goes up. Or they could have just measured body temps to begin with...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Taking an SSRI at the end of a roll (6-7 hours in) will block the SERT which will prevent the uptake of any nasty remaining metabolites that are floating around, in turn, mitigating damage. <br /><br />5-HTP is the direct precursor to serotonin, and is created from tryptophan hydroxlayse (TPH). Since MDMA reduces TPH levels drastically for a couple of weeks after a roll, serotonin will not be as readily produced. Supplementing with 5-HTP in the week following a roll will help your brain restore serotonin to its proper levels.<br /><br />The two are both beneficial to the recovery of your 5-HT axons but act completely differently, so taking both is definitely advised. I hope this helps clear up any confusion. :)

				I have been supplementing with MDMA off and on for about 3 years now. For the most part I would wait at least a few months in between rolls but there have been probably 5 instances where I rolled for multiple days in a row such as 3 day festivals. Overall I would say that I have rolled between 40 and 60 times. I am between 20 and 25 years old and have always been a straight A student, very bright business wise and always alert. <br /><br />Anyways over the course of the last year or so I have noticed that I constantly feel as if my head is in a &quot;fog&quot;. A lack of motivation is common and I feel really tired almost everyday. My doctor prescribed my wellbutrin for minor depression and minor attention deficit disorder and I have been taking 300mg ed for about 2 weeks now. Also I am a very healthy individual. I have always taken many supplements, multi vitamins, vitamin c, b complex, and exercise daily!<br /><br />I really want to know if I have potentially experienced some neurotoxicity problems? I am definitely not an &quot;e-tard&quot; by any means and can still function but I don&#039;t feel as &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;on point&quot; as I used to.<br /><br />Any input is appreciated!

				feel this is off topic, but don&#039;t really know where to put this<br />story time!<br />[=-sorry about spelling/grammar; would edit it, but don&#039;t have word and text is so small on the roads-=]<br />it could be from the mdma/too much previous drug use, depression, learning how to live life, or a combination of these.&nbsp; i know i did well in hs/jc cause my parents were on my ass.&nbsp; forced me to study, do athletics and kept on my ass.&nbsp; they made life easy for me.&nbsp; didn&#039;t have to work.&nbsp; all i had to do was get grades or get beat... once i got to college i had ultimate freedom.&nbsp; i first did attend class, but then didn&#039;t, eat shit food, party/drink every night which i did and get kicked out...i couldn&#039;t&nbsp; handle my shit you fuck up big time.&nbsp; never have spoken to a psychologist/councilor as this was recommended for my depression.&nbsp; i know many schools allow students to speak to someone for free for x amount of visits, but never went because maybe i didnt know to learn/know how fucked i am.&nbsp; just speaking personally i knew i didn&#039;t like learning what i was learning, but kept at it because i wanted to please my parents.&nbsp; this really fucked me over as i did worse the longer i was in it.&nbsp; i tired to change majors slightly to keep in the field but that wasn&#039;t helping.&nbsp; my personal habits (exercise and eating right) went out the window when adjusting to live by myself.&nbsp; i ran out of clean underwear and had nights when i was so drunk/hung over i would just deal with it rather then getting food from safeway which was across the road...&nbsp; im sure i became depressed and didn&#039;t really know it/couldn&#039;t cope with what was happening with my life.&nbsp; avoided coming home, answering the phone and dealing with the issue.&nbsp; to combat my hardship for whatever reason i started taking a shitload of e for a quarter.&nbsp; just parting my ass off.&nbsp; found a good group of functioning alcoholics.&nbsp; we drank m-su.&nbsp; like every fucking night!&nbsp; figured they could party and do school and so could i.&nbsp; &nbsp;i would roll 2-3 times a week consuming multiple pills.&nbsp; it got so bad i couldn&#039;t remember how many i had taken and decided to log them on a calender.&nbsp; im sure i did 15-20 pills a month easily.&nbsp; i really did a number on myself.&nbsp; my roommate had to sit me down and gave it to me straight.&nbsp; sometime in spring i stopped taking e to the point of no return.&nbsp; by summer i did it on occasion.&nbsp; after finals and or on days that needed to be cherished.&nbsp; i wanted to prove to myself that my brain wasn&#039;t broken.&nbsp; did 3 classes in one session and did well B/B-/B.&nbsp; had to put in a lot of time, but it felt great to know my brain worked to some degree.&nbsp; thought i met the requirements to get back into school, but still a bit too fucked up to realize that i didn&#039;t fulfill my requirements.&nbsp; in fall i was dropped from all my classes and started smoking mass amounts of weed every day.&nbsp; to this day only my other sibling knows what happened.&nbsp; another friend of 2 years suggested that i go see my doctor and talk to see if i have depression.&nbsp; it was reluctant, but i finally did.&nbsp; i was diagnosed with severe depression.&nbsp; i thought it was bullshit, but i did think about killing myself ect.&nbsp; after a few months on meds i realized this girl who i had been seeing on and off was bad for me and ended things.&nbsp; a bit after that i stopped taking my meds.&nbsp; they really wernt working.&nbsp; yes it did help me stop thinking about suicide, but the environment and double life i was living was very taxing.&nbsp; i came back home and well had to be clean sort of.&nbsp; realized that college was over and i had to get my shit together.&nbsp; slowly stopped smoking weed and applied to state schools.&nbsp; i got accepted and spent the next 1.5 years taking night classes while working part time to cover expenses.&nbsp; meanwhile i got a friend to make a fake diploma which is framed.&nbsp; both my parents think i finished at a much better school!&nbsp; went and saw another doctor a year later about my depression.&nbsp; it was considered moderate.&nbsp; i told him that i was soon going to be finishing school and looking for work.&nbsp; i wanted this off my record.&nbsp; he was down to change it to none or minor.&nbsp; currently looking for full time work.&nbsp; life has become bland and although i feel like i function normally something is off/missing.&nbsp; my brain still works to some degree as i am motivated to read a book a month and take classes for fun at my local jc since i only work part time.&nbsp; i can&#039;t tell if its from all the drug use or coming terms with my future and life as well as life becomes hard since i never had a hard childhood or young adulthood.&nbsp; anyways the last time i took mdma was in june.&nbsp; its been 9 months.&nbsp; i now have the control either from living at home and or finally getting my shit together to use responsibly.&nbsp; over the last few years i have tried to learn more about mdma on a deeper lvl and just common knowledge.&nbsp; i am shocked sometimes how reckless my friends take it.&nbsp; i try to advise them about what they should do, but its a learning process i guess. <br /><br />gpa<br />3.7 hs-did honors, but no ap<br />3.4 jc1shit was a joke<br />less than 2.5 @ private- hardest shit ever!<br />2.9 state-just like hs but with no hot bitches<br />4.0 jc2<br />3.5 jc3<br /><br />sorry for the long story<br /><br />cliffs<br />did well in hs/jc as it was easy<br />got into top 10 school in the nation and got kicked out due to living on my own for the first time<br />winter-got depressed/couldn&#039;t cope with failure so i told no one and drank/partied all the time-taking soo much e that i couldn&#039;t remember how many and which days so i wrote them on a calender<br />spring- slowly stopped taking so much e.&nbsp;

food in the fridge* (not sure if its cause im financially conscious and or have no new/old friends).&nbsp; go through odd periods of working out then nothing for several months.&nbsp; go hard maybe once a month (just alcohol) or every 1.5 months.&nbsp; ive abstained from coke, adderal, xanax, and e for 9 moths.&nbsp; i guess i still feel depressed, but not to the degree of harming myself.&nbsp; its probably still present as my motivation isnt there as well as just conforming and getting shit done on other people/the worlds rhythmic clock.&nbsp; not as bad as previous years ie missing/late to appointments/applying/filing paperwork on specific days.&nbsp; still, but can&#039;t tell if i am unmotivated because its due to drug use or due to environment/current living and future worries has partially immobilized me.&nbsp; i guess i see lots of people coming up in life and sometimes getting passed by by the younger cats.&nbsp; i know people are doing as poor as me setting up a future and some have not not bettered them self from high school.&nbsp; &nbsp; i can&#039;t tell if i am lost in life or have done irreversible harm/etard status.&nbsp; have lost many hobbies and friends then again i don&#039;t know if its an age thing.&nbsp; lately friends havnt been there for me so i am questing our friendship, but not sure if they are overly busy.&nbsp;

				onefishtwofishredfishblue: That is some serious shit, man :( I hope you can work things out. About your friends&#039; reckless use of E; some lessons can only be learnt from experience. I believe they know the risks, but probably without understanding them. My advice to you is simple; sobriety, lots of exercise, lots of fresh air and start talking about your problems with friends or family. I know it is hard to see the point, but I promise that it will help. Maybe you should start a martial art or yoga, those are great for both the mind and the body. With sobriety I mean: Don&#039;t smoke weed every day, and be careful with E. Hope all goes well &lt;3<br /><br />AnimusVox: I talked with a trusted contact and he came with the predicted response: &quot;This seems good and all, but we need better sources.&quot; If anybody finds a study contradicting the one stating that LSD potentiates the neurotoxicity of MDMA,or just a well written and published critique of it, I would be very interested in hearing of it :) Anonymous critiques - no matter how well written - are of limited use.<br /><br />

				@badniff: I understand completely where both you and your friend are coming from! Unfortunately I do not know of any literature that critiques the study so this is what we have to go by. On a personal level, I&#039;m going to continue to combine LSD and MDMA on occasion as the key to MDMA induced neurotoxicity is body temperature, and I always manage my body temperature extremely well. Maintaining a healthy set of guidelines when rolling and supplementing properly will almost completely, if not entirely, mitigate any potential damage that may arise as well. MDMA is incredibly safe when used responsibly, but unfortunately the majority of individuals using it are ignorant to this responsible use and are the ones in danger. The individuals that do not abstain between each use, overexert themselves, do not stay properly hydrated, ignore proper supplementation, and redose with large amounts throughout one sitting are those that are heavily effected. People like you and I who err on the side of caution are quite safe from MDMA induced neurotoxicity. :)<br /><br />Also, if your contact is of a medical background and is interested in reading the full study in question, you can find it here: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw6nSrA4s4MpYnFuZmVuUGJYN1U/edit?pli=1<br /><br />Cheers! :)

				Copied here since you posted over here too, happy to chat in the other thread though, easier in one place:<br /><br />Sure, here is a case by case run down for why this is not science:<br /><br />http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/44/3/375.abstract - Non controlled study of people that said they were active or had been active MDMA users. At no point was the use of MDMA confirmed and no other lifestyle or concurrent drug use taken into consideration. To put it another way, if I collected a portion of the population that had no cars and a portion of the population that had fords and examined the percentage of people in the Ford owning group who had been in an accident I could scientifically prove by the same logic in this study that Ford&#039;s caused auto accidents. <br /><br />https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11576026?dopt=Abstract - Exactly the same flawed &quot;science&quot; as above. How much MDMA did they take? Was it tested? Did they drink when taking it? Were they at raves or sitting at home? Did they snort a half pound of heroin at the same time? I could go on for days why this provides zero useful information and fails completely to qualify as science. <br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18991874 - Is not even a study but instead a proposal of how to look at how to study MDMA induced neurochemical alterations.<br /><br />http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/133/6/1779.abstract - Same as the first two, subjects took what they claim was MDMA as well as any number of other drugs and yet this study seeks to claim that MDMA caused any perceived differences between the groups.<br /><br />http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/175/2/186.short - Once again the same exact failing as the previous &quot;studies&quot;. I don&#039;t know how you are missing this but all of these are taking &quot;drug users&quot; who have also taken MDMA or what they thought was MDMA and found that their brains are slightly different. There is no single point of data in any of these that suggests that MDMA is responsible and I could change the criteria of the test to pot, speed, meth or anything else and come to the same conclusion because all the subjects did all that stuff too!<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21326196 - As above...<br /><br />You know I was going to go through the whole list but the reality of it is there&#039;s really no point in driving further down. The fact is not a single scientific controlled study has administered MDMA to human users in exclusion of other drugs and demonstrated before and after differences of the subject as a result of MDMA use. That is what science is, this, all of these, they are hearsay and supposition. <br /><br />I&#039;m all about harm reduction and yes I think that MDMA causes changes to your neurochemistry. However I think that by parading around non-scientific studies and claiming that they provide some insight into the potential harm of any given chemical is just as irresponsible as claiming there is no harm to be had. Everyone single one of the studies above could have been conducted on Marijuana and come to the same conclusion because there was no discrimination on what other drugs were taken. Is that really science for you when the result of the study can be exchanged for any number of other chemicals without any change?<br /><br />Not trying to pick a fight as you can hopefully tell. I love MDMA research, I wish we would actually do some. For all we know 90% of any damage done could be mitigated by something as simple as regulating body temperature through a cold shower or a glass of ice water. But these studies do not seek to mitigate harm they seek to propagate the idea that MDMA is bad and unfortunately I feel it&#039;s wrong to spread that rumor blindly.<br /><br />Anyway, love the thread and will continue to look forward to real information about the effects this lovely drug has on people. I hope some day this becomes a legally available substance that we can all learn to use responsibly since I feel like most people would benefit from seeing the world through the beautiful window that MDMA provides.

				In defense of DiamondSky&#039;s skepticism, I&#039;ll just point out that several decades of drug prohibition can easily tempt people, even intelligent people, to ascribe more danger to these substances than is justified. Many scientists have believed they found evidence that cannabis, for instance, causes brain damage, but the evidence typically turns out to be derived from faulty research.<br /><br />I shouldn&#039;t be surprised if the prohibitionist mentality influences even the drug-friendly Silk Road community. Perhaps the truly dangerous neurotoxin is the war on drugs.<br /><br />(I&#039;m posting a duplicate of this message on the other thread.)

It&#039;s sort of counter-intuitive since most the time when I stack drugs I feel worse the next day but for some reason 10-15mg of 2CB takes the edge off and I wake up the next day feeling great. Plus if I have the 2CB handy and dose that at the right time it normally keeps me from fiending on more MDMA by moving me onto a different high without such a sharp drop off like MDMA has (i.e. I&#039;m high and then I&#039;m not).<br /><br />Hope that helps.

				For this past festival(3 day festival), I used ...<br /><br />Mens 1-a-day multivitamin (1 in the beginning of the day)<br />Airborne (3 a day, when I woke up, before the festival, after the festival)<br />5-htp (1 before I went to bed)<br />melatonin (1 before i went to bed)<br />salmon oil (2 for breakfast, for the fuck of it)<br /><br />and I think that&#039;s it. Still experimenting with more things to add/change.<br />Will probably substitute xanax/valium on some days instead of melatonin.<br /><br />I rolled, drank liquor and smoked weed all 3 nights. By the 3rd night, I wasn&#039;t able to achieve a satisfactory roll.

				I partied pretty hard for four nights, rolled for the last three festival nights and I didn&#039;t have a single withdraw or shitty come down. In fact, the hardest night I rolled was the third night and my initial dose was only slightly bigger than the previous two nights. In fact, it was my best roll ever, so the magic is still there for me. I take L- Tryptophan on a daily basis and have for almost a year now. I tried to take 5-HTP before the L- Tryptophan and it just made me feel like shit. The vitamins I take regardless of drug use, and all I do is roll and drink.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly, I think it has a HUGE factor in the quality of stuff you are taking. I was taking JoR all last week and I felt great every single morning. That or the l- tryptophan, which I have to say has been amazing for me as an every day vitamin, it generates a lot of positivity towards every day life, regardless of rolling. 5-HTP on the other hand blew ass. <br /><br />With that said, everyone is different.

In fact, MDA metabolites are actually thought to be the reason for MDMA&#039;s neurotoxicity in the first place as MDA metabolizes into alpha-methyldopamine, which is a potent neurotoxin. I have quoted below a very thorough summation that explains this more in depth. In the end, you should definitely take precaution when ingesting MDA and be sure to practice the same harm reduction techniques as you would with MDMA. Unless you&#039;ve been consuming grams every weekend, I wouldn&#039;t worry too much. Our brain is an amazing machine and is extremely capable of repairing itself. With that said, I would definitely advise you to take a nice, long break (at least 3 months) and allow your brain to fully recover. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmm. So I&#039;ve been keeping in mind as a rule of thumb for MDMA: 3 months is ideal, 1 month minimum. Would you recommend against the single month interval for MDA?

There are studies to indicate that it is neuroprotective in animals. There are also some data suggesting that it can reverse certain types of brain damage caused by abuse of alcohol. <br /><br />I do take it Ian, and have found that it does &quot;bring back the magic&quot; (maybe because it is a nonspecific potentiator), and that I have yet to experience a hangover or comedown of any kind. But I do not use it to dance all night (which undoubtedly has a physical toll and a heat influence).

				I bloody well wish. I did take a break for 4+ years until a couple months ago. Perhaps coincidentally, my renewed interest in MDMA seemed to happen at about the same time I learned about BTC, then TOR. Go figure. I wish I had the self-control to space my rolls out as much as suggested. Oh well. Many thanks to the OP and others for their substantial contributions!
