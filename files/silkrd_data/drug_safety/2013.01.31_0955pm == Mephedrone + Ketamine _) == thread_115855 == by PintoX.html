				the speedy meph getting very trippy now... cant write or think properly so i will update later,<br />watching some random youtube drugs documentary without really understanding whats going on there....<br />euphoria +&nbsp; Dissociation interesting..... LOL&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />better than C + K&nbsp; as Coke&nbsp; gets a grip of your mind only wanting more lines&nbsp; where meph is pretty easy on this..

				Yes , this combination feels safe -<br /><br />i could not add later cause i was not able to write anymore, Got a K-Hole that blew me away pretty good, but with a &quot;stable&quot; feeling that was pretty good&nbsp; -&nbsp; what i find most amazing is that i have never done anything that had 0% comedown at all like this one had - guess it has to do with some other mental factors other than the chemical side,&nbsp; but had no comedown at all - not even remote,<br />fall asleep in a second and woke up like i have done nothing yesterday,<br />Will probably try that again :)
