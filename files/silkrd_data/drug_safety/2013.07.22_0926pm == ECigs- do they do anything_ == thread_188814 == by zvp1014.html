				Hello all!<br /><br />I&#039;m a non-smoker (well, solely a cannabis smoker) who decided to purchase an e-cig considering how it&#039;s inexpensive and my friends&#039; tasted pretty good.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking puffs of this Hi-Tech Peachy Mango E-Hookah for hours, and I don&#039;t really feel like I&#039;m feeling anything.<br /><br />What effects do ecigs have, if any?

				Does the one you have nicotine content in it?<br /><br />They certainly could give a non smoker a good nicotine buzz but other than that smokers just use it to quit cigs altogether or cut down.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d suggest you try smoking some normal cigarettes first, and experience their effect, comparing the results on e-cigs afterwards.<br /><br />As a smoker i&#039;ve tried a couple of e-cigs and the results are really mixed. All that i tried claimed to have nicotine in them. <br /><br />The latest i tried was a disposable model i purchased at riga airport for 6 euros, and that actually seems to work to some degree. To me it is no replacement for a real cigarette, but compared to something like nicotine gum/tablets it is better. Many airlines do not allow you to use e-cigs though, so you need to &#039;smoke&#039; them in the lavatory. The vapor coming out will not trigger smoke alarms however.

I&#039;d prefer the cannabis but I&#039;d also prefer to keep my savings in at least four digits. My new found McNugget addiction has been draining cash as is (damn those things are tasty now.. was a vegetarian for quite a few years, went to a McD&#039;s hoping to find chicken selects but all they had was the nuggets... they taste great though given how they&#039;re pink slime instead of a mashed up orgy of bones and feathers. Damn, I&#039;m going on a tangent in this parenthetical statement. I guess it&#039;s relevant as I fear McD&#039;s addiction moreso than nicotine).

				I went ahead and bought a different disposable; Blu&#039;s Menthol (as the only other option was classic tobacco). It doesn&#039;t taste anywhere near as good as the Hi-Tech did, BUT it actually works- I feel quite stimulated and relaxed at the same time.

				I don&#039;t think nicotine really has an effect. But if you are talking about the throat hit, there are like 2 different substances that make the e-liquid(apart from the nicotine and the flavoring), one substance is for more vapor/smoke and one for the throat hit.<br /><br />You can easily make e-liquid at home and figure out what suits you the best.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				As a(ny) smoker can tell you, nicotine definitely has an effect. <br /><br />Being deprived of nicotine for several hours will make most smokers feel craving it, uneasy, uncomfortable and what not - the effect is definitely really there. <br /><br />Nicotine can be administered in different ways though. For example, with sublingual tablets, nicotine gum, and using an electronic cigarette or other evaporation device. <br /><br />Things like nicotine gum, tablets and such reduce the discomfort of non smoking to some degree. But even if taken in equivalent dosages to smoking actual cigarettes they don&#039;t quite do the full trick. The physical withdrawal symptoms subside, but the cravings do not. <br /><br />I suppose this is where the electronic cigarette comes in: that delivers nicotine, but using it also simulates the act of actually smoking, making it feel less like an inferior surrogate and more like actually smoking a cigarette that is just a bit different from what you are used to. Perhaps comparable to smoking rolling tobacco when you are used to factory made cigaretts or the other way around. Maybe a bit further off than that, but at least it is something that lets you inhale something that remotely tastes and feels like tobacco smoke and delivers nicotine. <br /><br />Personally i&#039;d say that i would not consider things like nicotine gum or tablets as a serious option to replace real cigarettes, while i think electronic cigarettes could actually work. I&#039;m not looking to get rid of a nicotine addiction though, just interested in a safe route of administration that is less harmful but just as enjoyable.

				Its probably best to buy pharmacy ones as they should at least be more standardized than cheap ones.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I&#039;m actually getting a tiny bit of disassociation from my body which is weird.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Doesn&#039;t nicotine act as a dissociative at higher doses? I believe South American Indians smoke it in pipes for this purpose, and to commune with the spirit world. For a non-smoker large doses of nicotine probably has this effect.<br /><br />

				I always crave menthol cigarettes when I consume coke or MDMA. I used to chain smoke Newports like a champ.I completely cut it out by using the disposal mint ecigs. I forget the brand right now,a local gas station worker put me onto them.Now my lungs are fine and I crush it at the gym.
