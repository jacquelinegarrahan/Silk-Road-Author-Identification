				Right now I&#039;m throwing down some Subs so no narcotics for me for a while. Actually dropping narcotics all together. What I&#039;m looking for is something to take (pill, liquid, paper) that will just make me feel GOOD. Lift me up, but not give me jitters like phentermine or Adderral does. Remember, I have NEVER taken LSD or X at all. I would not want to take something at home and then go on a bad trip and have a bad nightmare. Is there something out there maybe in the Psychedelics area that will give me a good high/feeling but won&#039;t make me trip out mess up a first timer? I&#039;ve seen so many&nbsp; &nbsp;Psychedelics out there, but I have no idea which would be to start off with. I have read and read, but the more I read the more info I come across!<br />Thanks.

				Personally, i would recommend Molly (MDMA). In my opinion if you dose smartly its one of the most euphoric feelings out there. I had a few buddies that rolled with me this weekend for their first time (long time smokers but never really done anything but bud) and they said it was the best they&#039;ve ever felt. Mollys a lot cleaner than straight X pills or something like shrooms for me as it doesn&#039;t result in a hangover feeling the next day. Just read up on something like erowid and find something that sounds appealing&nbsp; :)<br />Hope that helps!

				I recently did the same thing. I quit Heroin, and with the help of some psychedelics, have managed to control the cravings pretty well.&nbsp; Psychedelic drugs seem to have a way of resetting yer brain and changing yer perspective. I would really recomend MDMA, LSD, 2C-B, or Mushrooms even. Athough I really think you should quit the Subs too. Just my opinion mind you. Its just that taking Subs/Done keeps you addicted. To really control the cravings you must face them head on. Cold turkey sucks but you can beat it.

				I heard Salvinorin A can be used to quit an addiction if you&#039;re interested, along with Ibogain.<br /><br /><br /><br />As for what drug I recommend you begin with? Hmm...<br /><br />25i-NBOMe can be euphoric and trippy, but has never seemed to intense for me at 2000Âµg doses so maybe you&#039;d like it to begin with?<br /><br />Magic Mushrooms make me feel all nostalgic and happy, with funny OEV&#039;s at the same time. They&#039;re the basic psychedelic which I feel everyone should try.<br /><br />MDMA has changed my life, my anxiety and depression seem much more manageable after trying it. Literally, the happiest moment of my life was on Molly.<br /><br />LSD is a classic and favorite, useful for sorting through my life when work stresses me out. Everyone loves LSD.<br /><br />DMT is on a class all on it&#039;s own. You&#039;re life will be effected by this, at least mine has. I honestly feel like I cross over to the other side on DMT, whether it&#039;s Heaven, Hell, or some alien world I don&#039;t know but it&#039;s breathtaking.

It has the euphoria of MDMA and the psychedelic properties of LSD, which in my opinion, is the perfect combo&nbsp; ;)

If you want a small amount of MDMA (smallest you&#039;ll get at a reasonable price is 1g) just go to the ecstasy section on SR.

				There are no bad trips. If you take LSD and see something totally insane you laugh it off and think &#039;wow i&#039;m stoned&#039;.<br />Salvia makes you feel good, weed, MDMA but start small.. LSD is crazy if it&#039;s good, like a 10hr high. <br />Can always buy LSD and cut one dose in half, then you&#039;re just high enough to enjoy it and not completely fucked. Of course, depending on LSD quality

				Personally I would not recommend starting off with shrooms or LSD if you are anxiety/panic attack prone .. I mean I know most people have a good time on these drugs but I&#039;ve had some hellish experiences that I would never want to repeat. If you don&#039;t think you have anxiety though then they can be lots of fun. Buuuut I would recommend MDMA first off, you are way less likely to have a bad &quot;trip&quot; on that and it&#039;s hard to beat mdma euphoria. If you wanna go even more low-key then even phenibut might work, although some people say it has no effect on them. It is subtle but I really enjoy it (plus it&#039;s legal, and cheap).

				You are going to buy some of Ivory&#039;s MDMA. You will take 250 milligrams of this MDMA. You will wait about a half hour. You will feel truly amazing. Do this in moderation (like no more than once a month for the best effect each time) and you will have a great experience. I just rolled with a couple newbies last weekend and they said they&#039;ve never felt better. It&#039;s my favorite drug for feeling good. Be careful with psychedelics because they can make you feel good (and I take them regularly for this reason), but if you&#039;re in the wrong mindset, they will put you in a worse mood and make you think about death and that sort of thing. With Ivory&#039;s MDMA, you really can&#039;t go wrong. You&#039;re just going to feel fantastic. Once you feel better, try some mushrooms, sit back to some good music, and relax. You&#039;ll feel much better, I promise.
