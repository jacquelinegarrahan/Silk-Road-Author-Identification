				New to IVing.&nbsp; How much water should I mix with #4 heroin?<br /><br />Im doing 5-20mg doses right now with 300mcgs of water (0.3cc).&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this too little?&nbsp; The heroin mixes nicely in this amount of water though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, does using more water get you higher? Or does it just prolong the rush or what?

				so the balance between the water concentration involves getting all the dope to dissolve, while not being too concentrated to damage the veins. probably not as big a problem for clean potent dope<br /><br />the less water the better to some extent because if the shot is too diluted the rush will be weakened. this is from all the dope being spread out and not being delivered quickly all across the blood brain barrier as rapidly together. <br /><br />not sure about the perfect amount, but youre doing pretty little shots so if its dissolving easily Id say its fine.<br /><br />a more experienced user may have better or more specific input though

				thats awesome, not sure if you will need more water for larger shots, but its great you have so many sharp spikes. one of the most important things you can do is use a brand new needle each time. have you seen the microscopic difference after just one penetration? its striking and dramatic.<br /><br />did you buy some of those crazy pebbles, i am waiting on some, but you definitely shouldnt need more than a tiny bit of water to dissolve that pure goodness<br /><br />btw make sure you are filtering, everyone says its important no matter how clean the solution appears<br /><br />Be safe!<br />

				This is why dull needles shouldnt be used, scroll down theres a pic:<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/348012-dull-needles-hurt!/page3<br /><br /><br />most people would probably pull out and re-use the needle if they miss, but some use a new needle for every single penetration to avoid more vein damage<br /><br />if youre doing pills many people suggest wheel filters but theyre expensive, cotton is generally what people use for H
