				I was wondering what the differences in high is between pure opiates and lortab? My only experiences thus far with opiates are lortab and percocet and that tussionex codeine cough syrup. I absolutely love them, but I get really cranky on them. What causes that? Is it the impurity? <br /><br />I want to smoke opium but don&#039;t know where to buy any. I&#039;m reluctant to try buying on Silk Road. <br /><br />

				By &quot;pure opiates&quot; do you mean natural, non-synthetic like opium or pills without acetaminophen/ibuprofen/asprin?<br /><br />As far as pills with just opiates - I feel like the high is a bit &quot;cleaner;&quot; less upset stomach, less side effects. If I take enough of any opiate, I can get occasional mood swings and unusually high anger for no apparent reason. I believe, not 100% though, that anger/crankiness/mood swings just comes with opiates. I haven&#039;t researched that at all, I&#039;m just telling you what I gathered from my experiences.<br /><br />You can also perform a cold water extraction on pills with codeine/hydrocodone/oxycodone and acetaminophen/ibuprofen/asprin in them to remove most of the acetaminophen/ibuprofen/asprin and leave you with just the good stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only tried opium once, and I&#039;m not even sure it was opium, so I can&#039;t really comment on it.

				Thanks for the reply. <br /><br />Yeah, I mean opium obviously and pills without acetaminophen and all that other crap. I feel like the high would be better without that crap, but I have no idea. <br /><br />I almost want to grow some poppies to try some opium.

				I can get moody and my friends also so I think it just goes with the territory. Some opiates are worse than others for me. Hydrocodone puts me in depressed mood and morphine makes me irritable. Oxycodone doesn&#039;t make me as bitchy. Try different ones if you can to see how they affect you.<br /><br />Opiates without acetaminophen are definitely the way to go if only for your liver. If you want to take doses that get you high you&#039;ll be taking a lot of other crap. Always go for the highest milligram with the least amount of other stuff. Just like street drugs really. I don&#039;t want the cut and filler, I want the dope.

				I have a regular diet of Norco 10/325, and wanted to have less of the filler. What exactly would be the cold water extraction process? I don&#039;t know if it is worth the trouble, but I must try!!<br />-S-
