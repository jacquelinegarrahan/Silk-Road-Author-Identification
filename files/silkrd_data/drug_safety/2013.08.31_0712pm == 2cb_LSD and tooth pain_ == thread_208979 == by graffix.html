				Hey guys, just wondering on if there&#039;s anyway to dull tooth pain when taking LSD or 2cb?<br /><br />My left side just hurts like crazy,more of a tooth pain than anything. So I try not to grind my teeth at all,and so far the only thing that seems to relieve some of the pain is chewing on a miswak stick. <br /><br />Is this just a side effect Ill always have to deal with? Cause sometimes the pain becomes pretty intense and kinda kills the whole fun vibe..

				Sorry about your tooth pain. I&#039;ve never had anything like that with psychedelics. It might be from grinding your teeth, but maybe you should see a dentist to make sure its not something worse. And take a painkiller for the pain?<br /><br />Best of luck

				Awww man this might suck then..... I always notice with those my teeth always start to taste very metallic , followed by the pain...I just did read something about a sinus infection due to sometimes when you do stuff like that it may lower the defenses in your immune system? <br /><br />I hope I don&#039;t have to give up 2cb or lsd, since they are just so great...when I do shrooms/dmt this doesn&#039;t happen, so I wonder if its some chemical in the 2cb/lsd that might be doing this?

				That&#039;s pretty bizarre, I haven&#039;t heard of anything like that before.<br />However, I know that LSD can increase sensitivity to pain, so maybe you already have a pre-existing problem with your tooth.<br />Otherwise, I don&#039;t really know why this would happen.<br />Psychedelics sure are strange substances
