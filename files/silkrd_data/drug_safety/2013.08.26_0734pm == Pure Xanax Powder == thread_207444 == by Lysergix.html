				Carefully cut the bag open with scissors then scrape it all out onto a mirror/dark sleek paper whatever. If scaleless from here on out it is easy to divvy up 10x equal piles, then divvy them up in 5x piles (2mg estimates)... and then take the smallest pile.<br /><br />Whatever u dont scrape from the bag.. keep the bag. then lick the fuck out of it after you&#039;re done with the stuff you&#039;ve played cause whatever it is ur tolerrance will be high.. but for fucks sake don&#039;t use xanax for more than 7 days straight or less depending on dosages.. I mean I can get away with 10x days. Shit, I ate 100mg of caslavas in a week and had no wd but remember, benzo wd&#039;s are the nastiest vs high ratio there are. it&#039;s easy to lose track. short half life ones such as xanax have the worst wd too..

				DO NOT eyeball or &quot;toothpick&quot; the dose with such a potent chemical unless you enjoy blacking out.<br />Safely dosing alprazolam is actually quite easy without an ultra-sensitive scale.<br />Simply make a liquid solution of it.<br />Alprazolam is not water soluble, but is freely soluble in propylene glycol, which you can find for quite cheap anywhere on the internet.<br />Measure out 100mL of propylene glycol, add that and the 100mg of xanax to a bottle, and shake vigorously.<br />Voila, you have a 1 mg/mL Xanax solution!<br />There&#039;s really no way you can screw this up, and you always know the exact dose you get every time.<br />You can also make a lot more concentrated solution and put droplets of it on blotters, candy, or anything the xanax will stick to.<br />That&#039;s pretty much all there is too it.<br />

				The above seems to be sound advise indeed, perhaps it will also dissolve into ethanol (as in everclear) to 1 mg / ml, i&#039;m not totally certain as this depends on temperature too. As long as you get a completely clear solution (as clear as water) you should be okay, if nothing solid remains all of it has dissolved and a good shake/stir should distribute it evenly. <br /><br />But why order something like 100 mg of a powder that you know is enough for 100 or 50 doses without having any means to measure it at all?

Buy some overproof alcohol and dilute it. If you have a gram put it into a litre. Then each ml with be a mg.<br /><br />If you have something like everclear 95% alc/vol then you can put as much as 10mg per 1ml of liquid. Then get a dropper bottle and count how many drops in 1ml, then you know how many drops to do.

If you leave the lid off of a ethanol solution it gets more potent, PG will do the oposite and pull water out of the air and get less potent.<br /><br />I personally hate the taste of PG and use pure ethanol and just keep it in an air-tight container.

				I&#039;d presume you&#039;d keep the lid on the bottle in either case really. Ethanol does evaporate at room temperature, but the couple of seconds required to uncap the vial and pipet out the amount you need should not be a problem. <br /><br />Then again, if you have no clue about how to work with a substance like pure alprazolam powder, do not order it. Just order tablets with a fixed amount in them that will remain the same for years. <br /><br />The powders are mostly useful for those that want to press their own pills and such, not for end users. Surely i could measure 1.0 or 2.0 mg on a balance, but i don&#039;t see myself doing that on a daily basis for personal use.

I&#039;d rather pony up the extra couple dollars for legitimate pharmaceuticals than deal with the hassle of powders. You could definitely make a massive profit though buying the powder, putting it in solution, and dropping it onto blotters. Not too interested in selling just yet, though.

				I suppose people beat you to that idea anyway, there are some vendors of alprazolam blotters out there as it is. Provided that their source material is good and the distribution is perfectly even, there would be little to say against this approach.<br /><br />Personally i prefer blister packed tablets - those can be messed wtih too, but the effort required to do that would probably exceed the cost of getting the real deal. <br />

				I don&#039;t think its a good idea getting bags of this - but if you got really good scales, then it is &#039;value for money&#039; providing you get the pure powder.<br /><br />With this being active at 0.5mg, I&#039;d suggest dabbing a finger into this stuff is not the way to go unless you want to build up a big tolerance to a drug that is very addictive, or at least it is in the USA were everyone from trailer parks to mansions in on the stuff!<br /><br />

				I would not recommend dabbing, toothpicking or by any other means trying to eyeball something like 1 mg. If you are familiar with the substance you could do this with reasonable accuracy (as in off by a factor of no more than 2). If you are not, you can make grave mistakes. <br /><br />You can try this by putting some piles of kitchen salt onto slides and ask friends to eyeball which is closest to being a milligram. You&#039;d be surprised how wrong people get that simple test - often under-estimating how much is really there. <br /><br />With salt this is a perfectly innocent game, but if you mis-dose 10 mg xanax for 1 mg you would probably end up in serious trouble.

				seconding the alprazolam/glycol solution suggestion. this seems to be a typical solution for those who buy the powder in bulk. be safe.

				Wtf, don&#039;t just eyeball this shit. If you know exactly how many mg you have, as mentioned, use a strong alcohol (everclear is best) or PG. PG tastes like shit. It also makes it a tad more syruppy. Alcohol evaporates quickly though. Food for thought. <br /><br />The next step is to get an oral syringe. I&#039;ve gotten tens of these from local pharmacies or grocer stores with little pharmacy sections.
