				Hi guys, kinda new to Silkroad so be nice :)<br /><br />Basically I got some acid off FlyingDutchman (great service by the way, highly recommend) and i left it in the airtight bag it comes in and put it in a tupperware box in a drawer. Unfortunately its been really hot recently and I was wondering if the acid might have degraded in the heat? It was in a drawer locked away from the sunlight and moisture but would the heat have affected it? Its in the fridge now but it was in that drawer for about 4 days.<br /><br />Also, is handling blotter with your fingers OK? Like tearing up the blotter with your hands to take single tabs?<br /><br />Thanks for any advice

Though, I won&#039;t deny it is a good practice as heat and skin oils are never good. I always use the tweezers included with my .001g scale(and maybe a mechanical pencil to hold down the rest of the strip if I am ripping a tab off).

				Are there any other ways for preserving it in the best possible way besides having it into a fridge?<br /><br />I don&#039;t live alone, so putting it into somewhere other could find it (such as a fridge/freezer) is not an option for me..<br /><br />I&#039;m actually planning on ordering some within a couple of days, but since it&#039;s around 30°C (85°F), I don&#039;t quite know how to preserve it, since I can&#039;t really do much more than putting it in a sealed bag into a desk drawer concealed inside something...<br />Any advices?

				In foil, in a fridge. If you don&#039;t live in a hot climate then I wouldn&#039;t bother with the fridge. You&#039;ve just got to keep it away from too much light/heat/contact.<br /><br />Anyone know anything about the degradation time of acid? Let&#039;s say someone finds a sheet of blotter stored away from the 70s, would it still work?

				The biggest killers of LSD are moisture, changes in temperature, light, and air.&nbsp; If you can avoid all of these things your acid will be good for a long time.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry about the fridge - it&#039;s really only important for really really long periods of time.<br /><br />It&#039;s a myth that LSD can be absorbed through the skin.&nbsp; If you have a sheet of dry acid and you touch all of it, you aren&#039;t going to trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, acid from the 70s will still be potent if it was stored correctly.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be it&#039;s full potency obviously, but it&#039;ll still be good enough to trip.

				I think it depends on how much of it you have and how long you intend to store it for.<br />If you&#039;re handling large amounts, yes, you should wear gloves when handling if you don&#039;t want to trip balls.&nbsp; If you just have a single sheet or less, no big deal - you should be able to cut a full sheet before an appreciable amount of L would soak into your skin.<br /><br />Sore in a cool dry spot, wrapped in paper, then plastic.&nbsp; Some folks believe since LSD is an acid it will actually react with aluminum (see project bluelight for storage tips and arguments, lol), and I&#039;ve seen L residue on many a plastic baggie.<br /><br />Where you CAN&#039;T use the fridge, either find a cool-dry spot in your basement(if you have one), or for short-term storage, just pick a book off your shelf and place it somewhere in the middle of the book and squeeze the book between others to keep it sealed. Choose a book nobody will take off your shelf.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ever use the freezer, due to condensation issues.<br /><br />I use a hermetically sealed locking stash box filled with silica gel packs to absorb any moisture myself.<br /><br />LSD through skin absorption is not a myth... sweaty skin is best.&nbsp; Slap a 5-strip in your armpit or under your nutsack sometime... you&#039;ll see what I mean.&nbsp; ;)

				So the few days in a drawer where it was really sunny won&#039;t have damaged it?<br /><br />If I put it in the fridge now that won&#039;t be too big of a temperature change will it?<br /><br />I&#039;m not a noob with acid, tripped plenty of times, just never had to store it before :)

Energy was coming quitly in my body. My hands was moist at this moment. The blotters was in fridge and this was dancing bears from LS ! Great shit! Old by 6 months so it is ok. I put anti-moist bags in the box that is in the fridge. I will be careful next time to cut it with scissors

				I used to keep my LSD in the freezer, in a baggie wrapped around and around with gaffer tape, then placed in tupperware with some silica gel. It never lost potency, even many years later.

				I&#039;m using plastic then wrapped in foil with a bunch of desiccant in a mason jar in the coolest, darkest spot in my house. I was reading an old thread that mentioned nitro packing, which got me googling, which led me to these oxygen absorbing packets... Would something like that be good to throw into the mix? They seem to be a good alternative to using nitrogen and are heavily promoted for food hoarding, so I don&#039;t think they&#039;d be detrimental... but anyone have any ideas or opinions on them?

				Good info, thanks guys! I was slightly worried about the storage of acid as well. Got some Grateful Dead Family fluff tucked away from last summer which I intend to consume with some friends come this lovely season of rebirth <br /><br />Be loved y&#039;all

				I just make it like the one mentioned the &quot;Book method&quot; worked for me. There I store all the trips I want fast access to.<br /><br />the rest will be stored in a stashbox in a cool dark place. <br /><br />I have taken L that was open in a book for over a year and have not noticed any loss of potency.
