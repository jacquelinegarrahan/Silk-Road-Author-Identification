				I was thinking of purchasing some Afghan Brown Heroin.<br /><br />I&#039;m more experienced than novice with banging H but I&#039;ve never had any of this quality My tolerance is quite low because i haven&#039;t done H in about 8 days. I can probably bang 2 &amp; a half 30mg oxycodone to give you a gauge of my tolerance level. I would assume i cut it with something then do the normal banging process. I&#039;ve had no experience with uncut H.<br /><br />If any experienced IV&#039;ers could shed some light on the process they use for banging this H i could greatly appreciate the input.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Respect,<br />Remmahraw

				Are you talking about the pebbles that have been rocking peoples faces off recently? That afghan brown? If so be very very careful from that. I have literally tried the exact heroin. (my buddy was military in Afghanistan.... will leave out the details) That gear is fucking wild. Watched someone croak on it, he literally had about 5-10 minutes to get some naloxone in his body before he was out cold, needless to say, he didnt make it.<br /><br />Anyways, don&#039;t cut your dope, use very little instead. I mean take a point. Break it into ten separate piles. Rig up one of those piles with about 80cc of water. Slowly inject about 30cc. Wait! feel rush :) if it was light then go ahead and boot the rest. If it made your knees shake I wouldnt do more. All of the dope on here is fucking great stuff. Be very careful with it unless you are experienced with that batch! I have seen 20+ year junkies croak out trying to do there normal dosage with good gear. This shit happens. If you can do 2 1/2 roxis then great, you can shoot pills! H is something completely different. Be careful. Start slow. Know the batch. Be smart, Stay alive. the H on this site is really that good.

				Thank you MakesMeShout123. I find your experiences and tales very intimidating, a bit frightening as well. Yet at the same time i cant wait for the paycheck to get some :D. I shall heed your advice and follow your methods very carefully. I infinitely appreciate your response.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking I&#039;d just poke my index or even pinky finger mildly into the powder, then knock it off into the spoon by rubbing my thumb and index finger together.<br /><br />Slso, what did you dissolve the H with if i may ask, it says on the product page citric acid might be needed? is this true, if so how will i go upon dissolving it?<br />

				PLEASE be extremely careful bro! <br /><br />Seriously if you are thinking of getting the pebbles from tony do not underestimate the potency. His regular gear is better than I could have imagined and you honestly should be intimidated regarding IV use. <br /><br />I may suggest you simply snort the dose initially, just to get a feel for the potency, then cut that dose by a third to half for the poke. Regardless, start out with WAYYY less than you think you will need. If you are going to get a punch of power on the end of your finger and shot all that, it sounds like a massive dose. You want to start with like half a match head sized bump, maybe as low as 5-10 mg for the uncut gear. <br /><br />It just depends on whose stuff you are trying. I would recommend Tony or wumg for the best stuff if you are into powder. These vendors have #4 H which is the salt form and will dissolve in water with just a touch of heat. You do not need to add an acid unless you purchase from Psilocin (or a EU vendor generally), whose gear is the #3 freebase version and will not dissolve without first being converted to the salt.
