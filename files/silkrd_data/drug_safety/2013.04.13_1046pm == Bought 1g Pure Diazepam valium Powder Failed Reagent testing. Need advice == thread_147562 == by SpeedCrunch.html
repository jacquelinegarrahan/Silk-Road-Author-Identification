				Hey SR community<br /><br />Not sure if this is exactly the right place to post this but I need some advice.<br /><br />I Bought 1g of Pure Diazepam valium Powder from fredthebaker. Just got it today put it through a MMC V&amp;R Reagent testing and it failed. <br /><br />I ran the test twice just to make sure as well as testing a known good Diazepam tablet (That came back positive) just to make sure my testing kits havent gone off.<br />So am not to sure what this powder is I had a single Marquis test available and ran that and got a strange red/brown color.<br /><br />[Failed Reagent test]<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/nsi.JPG<br /><br />[Marquis Test]<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/nsd.JPG<br /><br />This is what a MMC V&amp;R test should look like when testing real Diazepam. I tested a tablet of zepose 10 Diazepam.<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/nst.JPG<br /><br />I haven&#039;t finalized yet any advice on what I should do? iv never had a Reagent test fail when buying goods on SR. Also what do you think this powder could be from the Marquis Test?<br /><br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated<br /><br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				Right after sending a few messages back and forth and showing the pictures to fredthebaker I was given a refund.<br /><br />Although it seems fredthebaker is still under the opinion that the powder is diazepam based solely on the fact that he/she has sold over 500 grams of it with no complaints and still has the listing up.<br />I did some research on the Marquis test and it seems that the red/orange color that I got seems to indicate the presence of some type of Amphetamine.<br /><br />I find it disturbing that a vendor is selling an unknown white powder labeled as Diazepam that fails reagent testing.<br /><br />Yes I got a refund and yes I am happy with that but the main question is &quot;What is this white powder?&quot;<br /><br />I get paid in a few days so am going to order the&nbsp; &quot;EZ Test Complete kit&quot; it contains Marquis, Mandelin, Mecke Simon&#039;s and Robadope Reagents. Hopefully it should give me a good indication of what this white powder is.<br /><br />When I get the test kit I will report back my findings.<br />Stay safe people and remember always Reagent test your goods.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				Phenezepam? Dirt cheap long acting benzo. The kits probably dont test for that though. Also have never (knowingly) tried it so im not sure if the effects would be passable for diazepam. <br /><br />I guess it would also need to be cut with something else to prevent a 20mg dose from killing you.<br /><br />I am unfamiliar with the activity/chemistry of diazepam precursors. <br />

				Well him saying he has had no complaints is plain bullshit- I took mine to resolution for 50% (I felt like I should be due 100%, but thought I&#039;d have a better chance of getting 50% than having a long drawn out argument over it) It did have a vague valium type effect, but only after taking about a quarter gram in one go- started off trying 20 mg but felt nothing. He is a definite scammer, the only good thing I can say is that I got my 50% with no arguments, but he is selling something he knows to be dodgy and not pure, there seem to be more and more scumbags appearing on here in the last few months.

				I guess I ought to get a test kit as I like ketamine - I was initially afraid I would get PCP instead, but it fit the &quot;profile&quot; of K (I didn&#039;t cut off my own face nor get into an argument with a brick wall nor any of the other PCP horror stories one hears). Back to the diazepam, if you&#039;re brave, most benzo&#039;s I&#039;ve taken (valium, xanax, serax, rohypnol) all have a saccarine-sweet taste. But the chem test would definitely be the better way to test this.<br /><br />Since I mentioned ketamine, if you like vit. K, MarajuanaIsMyMuse is the vendor to get it from. I&#039;ve ordered several times from him/her/them, and am expecting some within a few days. MIMM!!! good vendor!

				I&#039;ll happily chuck some cash in for a test. I bought a g a month ago, it does exactly what I expected to do but I&#039;m a little alarmed at this.<br />Maybe fred will show up to explain himself.<br />Oh it was bitter tasting, like bile.

				Tasting these things is always a bit tricky. The pure substances sometimes have a distinct taste, but any additives could mask or alter that. <br /><br />Personally i do not find diazepam pills all that bitter, but they often contain a fair amount of lactose binder that could mask the taste a bit. Alprazolam does have a peculair foul bitter taste to it even when you chew down on a complete tablet with all the fillers and binders that are supposed to be in it (there is only 1 mg of alprazolam in a typical 100 to 200 mg tablet, but still).<br /><br />With pure powders, however, a reagent test should always prove positive if you checked it against a known-good source of diazepam and got the expected reaction with that.<br /><br />If the test fails, what actually is in the powder is anyones guess. It could be something that has similar effects but does not trigger the reaction. In case of valium this could be something unrelated like diphenhydramide, which also has sedative and anxiolytic properties, at about 5 times the amount you need from valium. If this were the case it wouldn&#039;t be all that dangerous a swap, but it would be a financial scam since diphenhydramide is available OTC at pennies for a 50 mg tablet. <br /><br />The possibilities are endless however, and even if you get a mass spectrum of the actual substance it can be hard to find what it actually is if you have no clue where to start looking.

				OK, I&#039;m willing to settle this.<br />I&#039;m obviously not another vendor and my only interest in this topic is finding out what I was sold. I&#039;m completely unbiased and genuine, check my post history.<br />Here is the review I wrote for this product a month ago:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=135662.msg924338#msg924338<br />As you can see I was impressed by the product, it has the same effect and potency I would expect from pure diazepam.<br />I still have ~0.2g left so my solution is this, if we can find the best value test kit, me and fred go halves on it and I will upload pictures of the all the tests and settle this once and for all.<br />I just want to put my mind at rest that I haven&#039;t given some my some random chemical, if the test comes back positive I&#039;ll put a large order in right away.<br />Sound good fred?

You are just making a fool of yourself and proving to everybody who has tried it what a low down scamming lying swindler you are. It does not work- you are selling it as being pure, but 20mg of real diazepam will have me nicely chilled (I have no tolerance at all).

				I missed this part first time I read your post, but at the end you say, quote:<br />&quot;All you do is jump on us when 1 thing goes wrong.&quot;<br /><br />Hang on a minute, I thought you said your diazepam was genuine, you&#039;ve really &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot; with that statement. We are jumping on you because you are selling bunk diazepam that you swear is pure, in making that statement, you are admitting that something has gone wrong, ie, your &quot;diazepam&quot; is not real.<br /><br />People who lie, usually slip up somewhere- you just did. lol

				Right I just want to make a quick statement now that am coming down from my LSD trip.<br /><br />I just want to say we should keep this thread on topic and not turn it into a vendor bashing thread. (I know some people are angry me included but.)<br /><br />We need to let the Reagent test results speak for themselves and let people decide the best course of action.<br /><br />Vendor bashing is not going to help this thread The Topic is Identifying this âunknown white powderâ<br /><br />Good vibes all around :)<br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				Hey peoples<br /><br />Right I just finished running all the EZ Reagent tests and to be honest am not to sure what to make of them. <br />But with that said I don&#039;t have a lot of experience with identifying different reagent colors so am just going to let you guys have a look and tell me what you think.<br /><br />[UNKNOWN WHITE POWDER]<br /><br />Reagent test results: (Mandelin,Marquis,Mecke)<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/ydOJ.jpg<br /><br />Reagent test results: (Simon&#039;s,Robadope&#039;s)<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/9ZnC.jpg<br /><br />[KNOWN GOOD DIAZEPAM TABLET] (Zepose 10 Brand diazepam crushed tablet)<br /><br />Reagent test results: (Mandelin,Marquis,Mecke)<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/lQ8B.jpg<br /><br />Reagent test results: (Simon&#039;s,Robadope&#039;s)<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/hLjc.jpg<br /><br /><br />[PREVIOUS TEST RESULTS] <br />I would have posted another V&amp;R Test result but I used my last 4 V&amp;R test ampoules during my initial testing and the V&amp;R test kits are not cheep.<br /><br />[Failed Reagent test] (MMC V&amp;R (Valium/Rohypnol) Test Kit<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/nsi.JPG<br /><br />This is what a MMC V&amp;R test should look like when testing real Diazepam. <br />I tested a tablet of zepose 10 brand Diazepam tablet.<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/nst.JPG<br /><br />Any thoughts on the EZ test Reagent results would be greatly appreciated. <br />The only other thing I can think would be to send it off to a lab for GC/MS testing but I don&#039;t have that kind of cash.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch<br /><br />P.S Be very careful when working with testing reagents. I got one of the reagents on my gloves and it started eating through gloves!. <br />So it&#039;s a good idea to wear full protection double gloves mask and face goggles recommended.

Hell I burned a hole in my glove working with one of the Reagent&#039;s lol.<br />Now with that said I do know how to read the results of a V&amp;R testing kit considering I have run dozens of them in the past I know the kit.<br />But I rarely use reagents such as Mandelin,Marquis,Mecke ,Simon&#039;s, and Robadope I have little experience with these Reagents beyond testing 2C-x&#039;s as I mostly buy benzodiazepines hence why I had the V&amp;R kit in the first place. <br />I have uploaded the results for other more experienced members to comment on and am not dismissing them.<br /><br />Also I would like to add that am not out to run anyone into the ground am not out to end your business I have no problems with any of your other listings. <br />Am just very concerned that what is being sold is not diazepam.<br />The fact is that a test kit specifically designed to detect the presence of diazepam powder failed. I ran 3 V&amp;R test&#039;s just to triple check and they all failed and I used my last test ampule to check a diazepam tablet and it passed.<br /><br />I tell you what Fred if you want to prove the quality of you goods then I would suggest buying a M.M.C V&amp;R kit or a Nik Test Kit R your choice and post us a picture of a positive result.<br /><br />I find it very disturbing that instead of pulling your powder listings temporarily and running a Diazepam test kit of your own you instead go about selling it as Pure Diazepam powder without any regard for people&#039;s personal health and safety.<br />This is just my personal opinion but I find that type of behavior very irresponsible vendors should be testing their product&#039;s before it&#039;s sold or when fault is found with it.<br /><br />Am sorry that you feel that am out to run your business into the ground but a failed test is what it is.<br />Am not going to argue or reply to anymore of your posts I don&#039;t see the point. <br />As I said in a previous post this is not a Vendor bashing thread but I felt I needed to speak my mind.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch

				Hey SR community<br /><br />After doing some thinking last night and this morning after I made my post last night I have come to a conclusion.<br />The only way for this thread to be resolved is for someone other than myself to get a diazepam specific testing kit and post there own results.<br />Because from the way I see it where just going to have endless speculation on this subject.<br /><br />Now with that said I do welcome any input from the EZ test results as I have no clue what am looking at.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />SpeedCrunch
