				Not sure if this belongs in Drug Safety or Off Topic, but here it goes:<br /><br />When I&#039;m coming down from a long night of tripping, I often like to put on a &#039;feel-good&#039; movie/show to calm me down and help me sleep, or just to entertain me if I&#039;m still tripping pretty hard, but everyone else went to sleep.&nbsp; For several years I used Toy Story, and then it became Finding Nemo, and then Wall-E(Disney movies just make me happy, especially nice CGI Pixar films).<br /><br />Anyone else have some favorite movies or tv shows to watch at the end of a tripping night or when coming out of the k-hole?

				There&#039;s a ton I could name off, but to keep it short I watched Adventureland last night and it was pretty chill. It&#039;s great for comedowns if you&#039;ve got weed, because they smoke it a lot in the film and I love to toke up when I watch movies like that. ;)

				Spirited Away is good, I agree.&nbsp; Miyazaki(the director) has made a lot of animated films and they&#039;re all good(princess mononoke, castle in the sky).&nbsp; How to train your dragon or Up would fit in your list as well most likely.&nbsp; You would have to give more examples for me to recommend more because I just stuck to the animated theme here.
