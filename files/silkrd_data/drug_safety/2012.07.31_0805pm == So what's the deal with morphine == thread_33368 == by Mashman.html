				So... I had a search on the forums and didn&#039;t find much about the stuff. I was wondering how you guys feel about morphine in comparison to oxys, dillies and opana&#039;s etc. whatever I&#039;ve found on erowid suggests good body high but little to no euphoria.

				Morphine is not a good drug to take orally. If you swallow morphine sulphate, almost 70% of it is eliminated by the liver during first pass metabolism after being absorbed from your intestines, so it is only about 30% bioavailable. Others like oxynorm have much higher bioavaiability at 90%. Obviously, if you are talking about IV administration, thats a different story.

				Hmm.. well I just took half an MS 15 (15mg Morphine Sulfate, extended release) and barely felt shit. My tolerance is there, but it&#039;s not too high. I&#039;ve only been taking 5mg percs OR 25mg tramadol every day or so for a couple months.<br /><br />When I took the morphine, I made sure to take it along with a fatty meal and some antacids to maximize absorption. Still nothing. I mean, I felt something, but the pain relief was minor and it wasn&#039;t very euphoric. Then again, I had a couple opiate-tolerant friends take a whole pill and they loved it. Perhaps it has something to do with the time release coating? You would also be correct to say that it&#039;s more of a body high than the speedy head rush you would get with oxycodone -- I guess you can call it the indica of opiates. The problem with morphine is oral bioavailability. Your body just can&#039;t absorb it well through the digestive system. If you have a tolerance and you&#039;re not going to shoot this stuff or shove it up your ass, my advice would be to save up a few pills and take them all at once along with a high fat meal and a tums.

				Well it&#039;s an opioid, anesthetic, analgesic drug that fucks you up good-and-nice and is highly addictive. Not much else to say really.

				once when I couldn&#039;t get OCs my source gave me some ms-contins. I sniffed them up. They were lame compared to OCs. As has been said, Morphine is really best for IV which rules it out for me too.

				I&#039;m selling OxyNorm capsules which contain pure oxycodone powder (no other added drugs like paracetamol). <br />It has an oral bioavailability of 90%, and almost as good when insufflated. <br />10mg of oxynorm orally is the same as about 20mg of morphine.

				Yeah Darwin your top of my bookmark list dude. Getting some coin end of the week so will be getting in touch. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ll bother with the morphine don&#039;t really sound like what I&#039;m after.
