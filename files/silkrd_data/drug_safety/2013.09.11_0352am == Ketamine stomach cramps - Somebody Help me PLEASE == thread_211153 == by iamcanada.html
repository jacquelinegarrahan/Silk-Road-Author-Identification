				So I have been on and off ketamine for a long part of my life. Recently I have been doing about 3.5g/day which I know is crazy. I take cranberry pills to combat UTI&#039;s and I eat lots of yogurt to battle the diarrehea. My urine is sometimes gooey at the end, but for the most part the pain associated with UTI&#039;s are no longer present ever since taking cranberry pills. However yesterday the adbominal pains hit like a bitch.<br /><br />I woke up in a sweat and my stomach was killing. I felt bloated, and puked up a little green liquid while continously burping and being in agonizing pain. I want to die it hurts so much. Take a few small bumps has helped the pain subside, but only to return back with a vengeance later. I need to quit. what can i do. Please help me

				The truth. It is the only way they can help if it is life threatening. They are not cops but if you are worried flush or get the stuff out of your house in case they do get involved so possession won&#039;t be your next issue. Just be sure your first concern is your life. You have one. I hate to give this advice but if you are in trouble get help. I once was a crack addict. I no longer use it, been clean of it for over 5 years and it is a miracle but I would&#039;ve died had I not asked for help.

				Unfortunately that is not an option for me. From what I understand this is not life threatening. I just need to find a way to deal with this pain because it is so severe I would rather die then continue to live through such pain.

				take Omeprazole it is the only thing that helps <br /><br />You will need to take a lot more than is suggested. My experience is that a single dose will stop the pain for about half an hour, then you need to dose again. Try to throw up, the last time I had k-pains it was so horrible, but then it got so bad that I puked from it and immediately the pain totally went away. <br /><br />So my advice:<br /><br />Force yourself to throw up, take Omeprazole, and then drink a lot of water because you are probably dehydrated.

It is probably over the counter where you live but might not be. I am not sure exactly why it causes k-pains to go away but in my experience it does. There are two mechanisms of action I can see, one is that it greatly reduces acid in the stomach, which is what it is made for. The second is that is actually inhibits the break down of ketamine into norketamine, so taking this will make it take longer for ketamine in your system to be metabolized, but it also will significantly reduce the by products of ketamine, mainly norketamine, so perhaps it is high concentration norketamine that causes the pain. All I know is that it stopped k pains for me, but I had to keep taking it because they kept coming back for several hours. But yeah, puke, take some of this, drink water.

				Stop doing ket.&nbsp; That many grams that fast/long es no bueno.&nbsp; Use something else you have in your house for the pain.&nbsp; Your choice.<br /><br />And get to a doctor when you can.&nbsp; There are clinics you walk into and they won&#039;t judge you.&nbsp; Just be honest with them in a smart way that protects yourself. <br /><br />We all know ket long term is not so gentle on the body.&nbsp; I love it and I enjoy it but it does seem to fuck with the intestinal organs and urinary system <br />&nbsp;hope the omeprazole works... I&#039;ve been a long time dxm / ket enthusiast but it does do some weird shit when you go days without a break<br /><br />In the states its called Prilosec.&nbsp; Canada must have it too...pretty common

				I have been in the same boat you have been with very painful cramps agonizing pain rolling around on your bathroom floor praying it will end.<br /><br />What I found work was the following:<br /><br />1. Stop doing K for a long time (obviously)<br /><br />2. Taking some type of laxative if you havent shit in a while helped me (I used some baby lax in pill form) I found that part of the cramping pain is due to being stuffed up having a bunch of K sitting in your system and you need to push it out. Drinking SHIT TONS of water and a few Laxatives seemed to help cut down on the cramp pain time and push shit out of your intestines causing new enzymes and what not to come in to play and neutralize the acidic contents of your body.&nbsp; A warm bath may help you deal with pain as well.<br /><br />3. I was prescribed Adderal and Valium and noticed when taking one of the other help to sub side the pain temporarily but after a few hours the pain would return if the cramps have not fully ran its course.&nbsp; Obviously use caution when taking drugs and dont go taking a handful I would take my normal dose plus a half or 1 and a half. I dont know how or why it worked for me but it did. I know taking bump of K help the pain going away but that is the cause of your problem, substiting it with something else in moderate doses though not the best idea, is a sub par temp solution for a really painful problem. <br /><br />4. You prob now have done some Kidney/liver/Bladder/Urinary Tract etc damage the research I have done (forum searches, asking doctors etc) suggest that the damage is reversible and your organs can heal over time but you will want to start eating health food that help promote liver and kidney health. Cranberry juice is a good start but it is not enough. Look online for examples of foods that help repair your organs.<br /><br />5. Taking a few small bumps is what got you here in the first place. Yes it may ease the pain now but will only make issues worse in the hours to come. If you must do more K Drink lots of water you want your body to be very hydrated so it can keep the crystal shards that are essentially lacerating your insides to stay as dissolved as possible. DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL, COFFEE, SODA, ETC AND SPIT OUT AS MUCH DRIP AS YOU CAN (IF YOU SNORT)<br /><br />6. The vomiting of green liquid is VERY ALARMING that could be a secretion&nbsp; of liquid from you gall bladder&nbsp; kidney or other major organ. If that happens again you really need to consider going to an ER and getting check out asap. Ketamine is a very sharp molecule and basically cuts your organs up, one too many cuts in the same spot and you may not have a chance at having a good out come. <br /><br />7. I&#039;m not to sure about&nbsp; Omeprazole but from a quick research it appears to be a RX anti acid medication, This can be helpful I would take OTC Anti Acids to combat this and it helped.<br /><br />8. Seriously take a&nbsp; long term break, and do some soul searching I&#039;m not one to preach about how people should live there life but I know when I was doing insane amounts of K like you, I wasnt really living my life to what it could be. Theres a whole world out there out side of that K hole and sometimes its actually pretty enjoyable. <br /><br /><br />Take care man I hope you get better soon, I know how fucking hellish that hole can be. <br /><br />

I am not sure which is more helpful, but something that it does causes k-pains to stop. It looks like it slows the break down of ketamine-&gt;norketamine by about 15% or so at a standard dose. That probably means it significantly lowers the concentration of norketamine building up in your body.

				Thanks so much for all the advice guys. I am out of k so am going to try and stop sniffing. I do have a slight pain still but it is nothing compared to what woke me up from my sleep. I was feeling bloated and constipated so I did take a laxative which may have helped. <br /><br />Thanks again everyone. Hopefully I can start cleaning myself up.

You should find that as of day 3 -4 the cramps will tone down in intensity and severeness. <br />&nbsp;The chamomile should also help with the diarrhea. <br /><br />Right. You should probably start taking a course of basic general antibiotics like amoxy to get rid of any urinary tract infections that remain. <br /><br />Looking to the future theres a huge chance you will need to have your bladder stretched out. Really this period is ideal for you to guage the retention rate of liquids you currently have. also this routine will help stretch it a bit anyway, possibly enough to get by without surgery. <br /><br />if your pissing out jelly then you´re body is in pretty bad shape my Canadian k head friend. and I would advise you to stop putting more horse tranquilizers inside you. <br /><br />I hope you get better, K cramps are worse than being stabbed in the stomach with a screw driver, trust me, ive been though both. <br /><br />ACE<br /><br />

				Aside from all the good advice already given out here. Once your in a better place and stable somewhat can I suggest a nice indica weed or hash, this could help your stomach to relax, it wont take away the pain, but it will take your mind away from the discomfort and ease the tension your feeling now. <br /><br />Ive never experienced anything what your going through so Im just guessing it could help but I do know that it helps a lot of people coping with stomach withdrawals from opiates. Your stomach has many GABA receptors and part of any type of physical withdrawal causes these receptors to react with whats going on inside your brain and at the moment your GABA intake will be dramatically low, your best bet is to buy some GABA substitutes from a health shop to help replenish the loss.<br /><br />Use the cannabis in medium doses, make a joint and take a few puffs here and there, dont go over board, just enough to take the edge off. <br /><br />

				As someone who has known many people who are where you are I strongly advise you discontinue sniffing IMMEDIATELY! <br /><br />Some great advice here as well. The green liquid is likely bile fluid. The stomach cramps are likely caused by inflammation/infection of the gal bladder. Cranberry can be excellent in helping combat the UTI but does nothing to help the stomach pains. Drink LOTS of water, and eat LOTS of vegetables. Cucumbers are a excellent for helping out your gal bladder. If you are concerned about privacy you can always go to a walk in clinic; that way you will never have to meet the doctor who you reveal your addiction too. <br /><br />You are probably at the point where sniffing is no longer even getting you high, and you are more addicted to the process/habit then you are the substance. Best of luck, and like someone here mentioned, there is a life outside of k. BTW edibles can be awesome in combating the pain, however they are obviously more of a symptom reliever then a solution.

				You guys seriously need to stop snorting ketamine. IM is the best ROA for ketamine. There is no way you can fit enough in a syringe to damage your organs to this point. I don&#039;t know how you even snort that much but shit, stop. K builds a rapid tolerance and is pointless to snort those amounts. Moderation is key as always. IME, one deep K-hole every three months would be ideal, but I know that is hard to stick to with a huge bag of powder staring you in the FACE. :x<br /><br />It is addictive. One time long ago I got a very impure batch of K and I think it was cut with table salt or some shit. I still couldn&#039;t stop doing it. Finally one day I snorted some, in the midst of my high I made the decision &#039;fuck this&#039; and I went and flushed nearly an ounce. I don&#039;t regret it.

In grade 11 I was pissing blood and finally quit for 3 years. Then I found a source for cheap amazing ketamine directly from a veternary source and have been back on it. I sniffed a half oz once in a single night, and I try so hard to quit but I just can&#039;t do it. <br /><br />I really think I need to see some sort of therapist or medical help.

				Dont bother switching to IM if your already experiencing these issues it will not stop the gall bladder spasms. I was doing anywhere between 2-5 grams a day switched to IM after similar problems and still experienced the cramps and increase/painful urination. In all honesty the only thing that made me feel better was complete abstinence from K for a while.<br /><br />Now if your doing that much K you are psychologically addicted and this may seem daunting and the only way I could achieve it was cutting myself from any local K supply, it&#039;s simply to easy to get high one more time. EnergyImport has offered some good advice and you should take it. Here in the UK there has been a large increase in K related bladder problem and it isn&#039;t fun, people may tell you it&#039;s due to a cut etc but that&#039;s all bullshit.<br /><br />Even now after over 2 years of almost total abstinence I will still get the odd discomfort in my bladder, depends on diet as well. Stay away from fatty foods and coffee as this will exasperate any problems. I am able to use K a few times a year but I must limit to 1-2 grams a session as my tolerance is still sky high and I find myself experiencing discomfort for the next few days.<br /><br />Seem like K is pretty safe until you reach the point of having a steady connect and doing it more than twice a month and more than 1g a session. Also it&#039;s fucking addictive (psychologically) to certain people.<br /><br />Try moving towards psychedelics instead of dissociatives (try the LSD/DMT/Magic Mushroom, depending on your experience) as these seemed to help me when coming off of K.

Ketamine is a very sharp molecule and basically cuts your organs up, one too many cuts in the same spot and you may not have a chance at having a good out come. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The green stuff you&#039;re barfing up is definitely bile from your gall bladder, but shards of K do not &quot;cut your organs up&quot;. They dissolve in your mucous membranes of your face/throat, and then your stomach acids, long before they reach your gall bladder (and I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re not so daft to be snorting shards of anything).&nbsp; The liver dumps its bile into the gall bladder, which is probably inflammed due to the high acidity of what you&#039;re putting into your body.&nbsp; Ketamine abuse can result in symptoms similar to having gall stones.<br /><br />Ketamine does, however, cut the fuck out of your face, if you&#039;re not crushing the crystals up as fine as humanly possible. I shudder to think what an otolaryngologist would find when he sticks a light up into your sinuses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ketamine HCl is very acidic, and bathes your internal organs in acid - your face, your teeth (go to a dentist ASAP, homie - all that K dripping down the back of your throat/no water/mouthbreathing while you sleep because your nose is too blocked up is rotting your teeth away.&nbsp; I&#039;m not kidding.&nbsp; It&#039;s akin to &#039;meth mouth&#039;.&nbsp; Go now, after you see a GP. )<br /><br />Then it makes its way into your tummy, where it decreases the pH and begins to dissolve the stomach lining, leading to ulcers.&nbsp; You may also have an H. Pylori infection in your duodenum, exacerbated by the elevated acidity in your stomach.&nbsp; H. Pylori is bad, and I&#039;m sure your immune system is hella compromised by 3.5-4g/day of K.&nbsp; It will lead to fun stuff, like projectile vomiting, the shakes, arrythmia.<br /><br />Four grams a day can also gelatinize your pee, plugging up your kidneys, acidizing your body and...need I say anymore?&nbsp; You must drink 3 liters of water a day and stop immediately until the symptoms subside.<br /><br />Today, you need to go to a good pharmacy.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t find a proton-pump inhibitor (raberprazole, dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole), try an H2-agonist like ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine and nizatidine. As mentioned previously in this thread, *if* norketamine levels in your body are contributing to your pains, Cimetidine also inhibits the CYP2D6 enzyme in your liver that breaks down ketamine, so it might help somewhat.&nbsp; Just go to the pharmacy, look at the over-the-counter antacids and see if you can find anything more complicated than Milk of Magnesia.&nbsp; But even so, anything that reduces the acidity in your stomach is going to make you feel better in the short term.&nbsp; Don&#039;t drink milk; lactic acid is not good for you in the long term.<br /><br />If you go a doctor, no-one is going to arrest you; a good doctor would never report you to the law for coming in with drug-related symptoms.&nbsp; Ketamine makes people very paranoid with that kind of chronic use, so don&#039;t worry.&nbsp; You&#039;re just freaking yourself out and killing yourself slowly by not seeing a doctor.&nbsp; And chronically damaging your tissues will eventually lead to cancer - either of your stomach or your throat, or even your face.&nbsp; That&#039;s just how it works.&nbsp; So 1) stop, 2) go see a doctor, not necessarily in that order.<br /><br />Snorting K may be the worst way to do it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done needles, however, and needles are even more addictive.&nbsp; So that&#039;s why I stay away from them.&nbsp; If you have an addictive personality, it is wise to stay away from needles.&nbsp; IM will lead to IV, and then you&#039;re basically fucked if you have no self-control.<br /><br />Getting off K is just somewhat difficult, especially when you&#039;re psychologically dependent on it. To get off of it, I have done a lot of nitrous, since it is also a dissociative.&nbsp; Depending on how much I&#039;ve been doing, the ketamine withdrawals (which are *really* mild, compared to opiates, etc.) last 1-3 weeks.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also considered taking DXM to ease the symptoms, but haven&#039;t actually tried it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, if you live in bumfuck nowhere in Canada, I would recommend moving.&nbsp; Hardcore drug addiction is often the result of living in a place that has no kind of stimulus to offer you.&nbsp; A long time ago, I went from BFE to a bustling foreign city where I couldn&#039;t speak the language, and I found that I had no longer even thought of drugs (imagine my surprise!).&nbsp; Stop spending your money on drugs and travel. You&#039;ll take yourself away from the environment where you are doing drugs, and you&#039;ll find enough to interest you that you&#039;ll discover you won&#039;t even think of them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been where you are before, on way worse, and this is what worked for me.&nbsp; Go somewhere you&#039;ve always dreamed of going.<br /><br />After you go to a doctor.<br /><br />Peace.&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S. - Don&#039;t forget to force yourself to drink a ton of water - 3L a day for now!

				Thanks so much for all the advice guys, you are amazing.<br /><br />I went to the doctor. I have an ultrasound booked for Saturday. I was given tecta (40 mg pantoprazole) I also took some Phazyme otc to help with bloating. I couldn&#039;t find it in in me to tell him about my ketamine use.<br /><br /><br />And of course I do not sniff ketamine shards - they are well powered/fluffy before sniffing and I spit out all my drips I do not swallow them. <br /><br />I am still bumping a little, I KNOW I SHOULD STOP. but I cant help it. I am down to 1g a day though, which is much better then before. Hoping this antacid can help with the pain as it is a H+, K+ and ATPase Inhibitior.

				Oh my gawd ....<br />Kittykitty that was an amazing post you made.&nbsp; Glad someone clarified &quot;cut up your insides&quot;.&nbsp; Because in a way it does.<br />Good info and advice all around.<br /><br />That&#039;s it.&nbsp; No more K for me for a while.&nbsp; scared (somewhat) straight by this thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />Canada I hope you get better.&nbsp; Is there anything you can substitute with instead of continuing K?<br /><br />Kratom comes to mind, have you ever tried it?&nbsp; Pretty gentle on the body and might help ease you out of addiction.<br /><br />&nbsp; I know it&#039;s cheesy but *Internet hug for you right here*.

				I feel more addicted to the process then the feeling. The snorting process itself is addicting, like a nasal fixation.

				&nbsp; I did the K for a little bit, I was looking for LSD the first time, ran into some people traveling home from a show, they sold me 3x $20 bags, about 0.5gm each.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got 3 of my friends high, that was the most I&#039;ve ever done.&nbsp; After that, I always would do less than 0.2g, thats it.&nbsp; Ketamine is a crappy drug once you get over the initial buzz.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think of it like almost-not-cocaine, cocaine is only really good the first bump, K even more so.&nbsp; The feeling that the first bump gave me, a puny 40mg, has never been matched, even with a 1/4g dose.&nbsp; Optimally, my favorite way to do Ketamine was to bump 0.1g and drop a hit of LSD at the exact same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;After the LSD kicks in, I would snort methylphenidate to counter-act the K, this decreases the body load of the LSD trip, and provides a good foundation for the hallucinations, I would see spacial distortions on small doses of LSD, which is rare.&nbsp; Flicked a cigarette, and saw the ash cause ripples as if a stone were thrown in a pond, then reached for the skateboard in the back of the car, arm is now 7ft long in appearance, this is a small car, too!. I honestly think stims right after K decreases the want for more, I did cocaine once after K, laughed like crazy for a good 10 minutes, then my straight-edge girlfriend broke up with me and stole my broken-lighter pill crusher/straw kit.&nbsp; One time, a friend and I bumped like 0.15g each, after eating a goat-cheese pizza with half a kilo of Chevre cheese on it.&nbsp; Needless to say, my friend vomited.&nbsp;

				I would like to strongly advice the OP to go to this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.0<br />It is by a Spanish doctor, specializing in addiction issues and &quot;harm reduction&quot;, he is not a customer of SR, he posts under his real identity (provides a link to his own webpage). He is just here because he believes in the SR model, and wants to provide a service.<br />This would be an ideal solution for the OP to get accurate medical advice, without having to approach his own doctor, and without having details of drug abuse entered on his medical records.<br />To me, his symptoms strongly suggest major problems, but the fact is, I&#039;m not a medical expert, nor are the other well-meaning posters!<br />ASK THE DOC!<br /><br />p.s. I think I&#039;m correct in saying that you could ask him by pm, if you don&#039;t want the details posted for all to see.

Lots of water. Avoid coffee and booze. And once everything is healed and no longer hurts (6 weeks or so, depending...no pun intended), and you&#039;re still pissing far too frequently, try holding it 10 minutes longer than you&#039;d like, but not so much that it hurts too bad.&nbsp; That will eventually increase your bladder capacity to something more acceptable.<br /><br />Stay off the road for a while.&nbsp; Best of luck with this transition.<br /><br /><br /><br />
