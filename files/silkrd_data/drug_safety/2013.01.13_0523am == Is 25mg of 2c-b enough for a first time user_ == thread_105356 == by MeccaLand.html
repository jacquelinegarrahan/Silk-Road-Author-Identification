				25mg should be enough for a good fun time on 2CB. If you haven&#039;t tried it before you might want to start smaller, even at the 5-10mg range it can be fun and some people love the 15-20mg spot. Not really &quot;more fun&quot; once you get past peak does, but it does become a lit more visual.<br /><br />No idea on Meth but I suspect Meth would just cancel out a bunch of the 2CB effects. Normally the stronger drug wins in those sorts of deals. Haven&#039;t heard anything about the two being unsafe with each other.

				Thanks for the info.<br /><br />What I plan on buying is a single 25mg capsule so I wouldnt know how to break that down to 10-15 mgs.. Probably just take the whole thing.

				So if I were you I&#039;d think about picking up the 40mg cap and just splitting that down a bit. Some people like to get fucked and it maybe the 15mg takes you there. Not that it&#039;s a huge downside but 2CB stays active for quite a few hours, easier to up a dose than deal with taking too much. Nothing bad has ever happened to me on 2CB I can just see the visuals getting a little overwhelming for someone who might not be used to it which is why I would ram up instead of going 25mg down the hatch.

				I did 25mg for my first time, it was nice and gentle. It&#039;s so much like the end of an acid trip and visuals of shrooms. If you&#039;re experienced with both, then go ahead and do 25mg. If not, do 5-10, then bump it up to 20-25 next time.

				Dosage may vary depending on the product&#039;s purity. <br /><br />It seems there are different purity levels on SR. 25 mg from one vendor&nbsp; many produce a very different intensity than 25 mg from another vendor&#039;s. <br /><br />Make sure you read the 2cb vendors reviews first: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28032

I try to order enough that I can have a threshold night before any real partying just to make sure there are no odd reactions, especially with chemicals like this that are potent in the 10-25mg range. Better to take it slow. Had a few times with MDMA presses in the past when the pills got me good and high but had so much speed in them I was wired for a day or two past my planned party time. Not a horrible thing but better to know before taking any heroic doses.
