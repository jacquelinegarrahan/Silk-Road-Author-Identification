				I am looking for a steroid that i can use at the gym. I would like to say i am a healthy person i don&#039;t drink or smoke and like to get to the gym as much as i can. I&#039;m looking for a steroid to help me bulk up on my muscles. Which ones are safe I&#039;ve heard of things like hearts stopping because of certain things. Anyone recommend a particular drug of choice and dosage?

				i dont use them and dont actually know much to anything about them, <br /><br />but i have read somewhere the key to using steroids safely is by correctly adhering to a schedule of dosing a few different compounds at the correct concentration for the correct length of time and in the correct order. <br /><br />might be called cycling or something. maybe you should look into that.

But close family use roids and I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re always talking about their cycle and whichever stack they&#039;re using!
