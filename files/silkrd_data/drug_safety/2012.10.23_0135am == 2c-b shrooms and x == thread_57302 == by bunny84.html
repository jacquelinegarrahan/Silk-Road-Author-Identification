				I personally haven&#039;t tried 2c-b, but from what I hear it is comparable to mushrooms (or LSD) and MDMA.<br />Mixing 2c-b and one of the two would work and you could take -<br /><br />Mushrooms - More psychedelic<br />MDMA - More Euphoria<br /><br />For whichever you desire to add to the 2c-b experience.

				Apparently mixing MDMA with 2c-b is called Honey Dipping. 2c-b being called &quot;bees&quot; you know. <br /><br />There&#039;s several different ways of going about it, but the most common and generally preferred way seems to be taking 2c-b when you start coming down from the MDMA peak. Say, about 3 hours after ingesting the MDMA. The best way of administrating 2c-b seems to be either snorting or rectally, but snorting can be pretty harsh and oral administration might be preferred. I haven&#039;t had the chance to try it myself yet. I&#039;ve placed an order recently and will try within a month or two. Remember, since the drugs have a synergistic effect in combining them, take a lower dose of each compared to if you would take them alone.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a good thread about MDMA/2c-b mixing: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41856.0

				Yes on MDMA plus shrooms or 2cb (see above), but beware of psychedelics that are also stimulating as they are already hard on your hart such as 25i-NBOMe and others.
