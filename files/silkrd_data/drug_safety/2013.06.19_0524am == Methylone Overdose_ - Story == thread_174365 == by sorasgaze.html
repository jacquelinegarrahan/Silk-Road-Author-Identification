				Wow, I realized this is seriously fucking long, I got bored and ramble on about pointless shit a lot, tl;dr at the bottom. Sorry for those who don&#039;t like reading paragraphs etc <br /><br />I had a very strange reaction to M1 a few weeks ago, came from a trusted vendor with a 99 feedback so I think it wasn&#039;t the product. I&#039;ve been searching but really can&#039;t seem to find anyone else who had the same problem and I&#039;m still wondering what happened. I was at the mall with two friends to roll. We were in my friends car in the parking lot and for some reason, I didn&#039;t bring my 0.1mg scale, I guess I was too used to dosing MDPV so I forgot I could use the scale for 100mg+ doses. I&#039;m fairly good at eyeballing dosages, and the time I had M1 before this, I took the usual dose with little effects so this time I figured I&#039;d have to take more. I poured what I thought was about 250mg in my hand and licked it off, I give my friend a dose as well because he only tried it once and it was a smaller dose so I wanted him to really feel it, I gave him a bit less than I took, the other person didn&#039;t want to try it because it&#039;s a research chemical. (Guess he didn&#039;t know every drug was at some point...)&nbsp; I looked at the bag after dosing, not too much was gone. We planned on walking around in the mall to wait for it to kick in. I smoke a Djarum on the way to the entrance of Sears. I did MDPV the night before at 20mg and ate the same night,&nbsp; I didn&#039;t eat since that night. I&#039;m not sure if I slept, MDPV has this trance-sleep effect on me to where I have no idea if I slept, I didn&#039;t have a comedown or any negative effects the following day. Back to the situation, besides orange juice and water, I had an empty stomach. We walked into Sears and my friends started walking around looking at stuff, I had no idea what they were doing. After walking around more, I began to feel really disoriented, like the feeling you get when you&#039;re dehydrated, but I don&#039;t see how I could be since I drank 3 glasses of orange juice and a bottle of water before leaving the house and it wasn&#039;t too hot outside. It&#039;s only been about 5 minutes since we dosed so I couldn&#039;t see how it could kick in so fast, even on an empty stomach. The feeling was like a mix of dehydration and the come-up, I didn&#039;t know whether to enjoy it or not. I didn&#039;t say much to anyone except &quot;Dude I feel fucking weird...&quot; and &quot;I think i feel it...&quot;, it was hard to talk in a way, half-slurring my words. We went to the upstairs floor and I had this weird feeling of energy, ran up the escalator for some reason, stuck in between enjoyable and horrible. We went back downstairs and out of Sears into the regular mall area, told my friends I had to sit down so we sat on the bench, I was trying to calm down but my body wouldn&#039;t let me, felt similar to when you&#039;re about to pass out. I told them I need to go back to the car so we walk back through Sears, I felt like I was about to faint, still drank a lot of water the whole time in case it really was dehydration. We got to the exit doors when I vomited all over the ground and my friend&#039;s back, it was mostly water, I tried to cover my mouth quick but it was too late. I still couldn&#039;t really follow what they were saying, one of my friends said it was because I smoked that cigarette before I walked in there and something about MDPV and vasoconstriction, but the MDPV was taken the night before, 12 hours before this happened and I&#039;ve even taken the Methylone + MDPV combo before three times and this never happened (always took the MDPV after the M1 kicked in, taking the MDPV first would make the M1 not work for some reason.) We got to the truck and I apologized to my friend for vomiting on him, he said he wasn&#039;t mad at me, just mad at the situation, lol...I felt like I should have been taken to the hospital. After waiting a while, the feelings went away and I was fine again, and actually had a nice roll. I haven&#039;t found any info on vomiting associated with M1, and the only overdose symptoms seem to relate to partial seizures, which don&#039;t include vomiting as a symptom. I was thinking it was from not eating since the night before or that I took a bit too much and my body couldn&#039;t handle it which may have been why I threw up. (I don&#039;t see how, eyeballing doses in the past were the perfect amount, never caused any problems and I used the same amount except maybe 30mg over.) Later, the person that I gave a dose to, also said he was a bit nauseous but it subsided. I haven&#039;t done anything since and also had him hold my MDPV so I wouldn&#039;t have the urge to do any. I&#039;m currently waiting for a 2g order and will use my scale this time.<br /><br />tl;dr - Ate usual amount of methylone, felt like fainting, couldn&#039;t talk, threw up.<br />No food 12h prior to dosing, drank lots of orange juice and water before and during this time, not sure if slept the night before (due to MDPV&#039;s wonderful zombie trance mindfuck effect.)<br /><br />Has anyone else gotten sick or anything similar from Methylone? Thanks.<br /><br /><br />

				Yeah man, I know, I&#039;ma be super careful next time. <br />I woke up feeling more tired than usual and didn&#039;t feel like doing anything but laying in bed, but overall I could think normally. I went to work then went to a friend&#039;s house and he asked me to smoke a small bowl of Zero Gravity and told me it fucks him up, I don&#039;t really like incense but took a small hit, had the typical stoned feeling then sober again. Walked around outside, went to McDonalds, chilled for a while then left. 5 hours later and now I feel braindead in a way, lack of muscle coordination/random muscle twitches, hard to think, maybe I have serotonin syndrome lol but I think if I did then I wouldn&#039;t be able to type.
