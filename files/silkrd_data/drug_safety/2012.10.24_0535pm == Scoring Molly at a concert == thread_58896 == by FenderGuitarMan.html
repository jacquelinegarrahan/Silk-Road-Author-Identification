				I am going to a concert in a day or two where the crowd is known to be heavily into molly. I&#039;ve bought shrooms at their shows but never molly or lsd, although both were available. should i bring a reagent test kit (I think I know where I can get one)? should I go with xtc pills or go for the raw molly? I&#039;m leaning towards molly with reagent test. Thoughts?

				Never without a tester on a festival or concert mate!!! And make sure you have a simon&#039;s too so you can identify cuts.

				Dude! You&#039;re on SR! Get your own, and pass it out around the concert, everyone will have their hands on their faces with their eyes rolled into the back of their head, saying how they&#039;ve never rolled so hard in their life. You&#039;ll be more popular than whoever is spinning/preforming at the concert ;). Enjoy bro!

				...Im a little older now...But i still go to &quot;Lots&quot; of concerts and shows...I try to hit every one i can possibly go to from<br /><br />Phish<br />Furthur<br />as well as all kinds of festivals rock/blues and electronic.........Ive gotten molly 3 times or so in the past few years at shows.<br />It was real ,but always very weak and cut...also got pills twice...recently...1 was a green naked lady...which was a methbomb with 0 mdma.Another was some unkown chemical,which was not mdma.....However we have always been able to find genuine &quot;lsd&quot; among a few duds here and their...<br /><br />I thought the reason alot of us choose to use the road is to avoid buying ,The mostly garbage they sell these days at concerts and festivals......I remember in my area here, 12 years ago ,you could go out to any club here.And it was absolutly &quot;Flooded&quot; with pills.And when you bought them,they were &quot;always&quot; the real thing..from some random stranger......<br /><br />Well us americans know what heppened nowadays.Your more likely than not to get something bogus/poison or misrepresented.....Ya do have a decent chance of getting real molly.but high probability its cut making it weak for higher profits.. (Only newbies and crazy people ,would chance taking pills from &quot;most&quot; strangers ,these days),<br /><br />So why not get the real, and best product right here on the road?Instead of wasting time and playing roulette..<br /><br />I&#039;ve made it my mission since joining here, to &quot;never&quot; again have to buy mdma at festies or concerts,or try finding it locally.............................mission accomplished .....

				I used to be just like you, trying to score at shows/festivals...until I found the exact site you&#039;re on now!! Now I don&#039;t have to worry about dealing with sketchballs selling god knows what, and I have plenty of amazing pure drugs to give to my friends. It&#039;s great!

				dudes thanks. I would absolutely buy it here but there wasn&#039;t a vendor that would have gotten it to me on time. It also happens my preferred vendor, UndergroundSyndicate, was totally out. I&#039;ve only done Molly a few times and believe it or not last time was 2 or 3 decades ago! I bought hash from UGS for some time and watched his/her listings and reviews and decided that was where I would get it. Then bam, they run out the week I plan to order. <br /><br />If I can&#039;t get the testing kits I&#039;ll just pass on the Molly and maybe do shrooms again. Last time I saw this band there was some LSD floating around but I don&#039;t have the time or the energy for that level of commitment! <br /><br />I should have prefaced my original message with &quot;due to poor planning, I didn&#039;t order any here in time to arrive for this show...&quot;

				Look for the people rolling already, the harder they are going - the more likely they are to share. Winning tip.

				Why would anyone need to score at a concert when you can get the world&#039;s best quality drugs for reasonable prices right here? :P

				I&#039;ve given away good molly at certain festivals before, not even selling it - so truly - some of the best things in life are free.<br />---<br />If someone went to an Aussie pink floyd concert this fall and got a&nbsp; molly cap that was really good - you gave me a little bag of weed for it if I remember right - you should message me....<br />---

				I was recently at a massive 3 day festival (USA) and there was no legit molly whatsoever. i reagent tested 40+ peoples product and used the rest of my marquis bottle and didnt find any legit molly or pills. The most common drugs tested being sold as &quot;molly&quot; were 1. methylone and #2 methamphetamine and #3 unknown chemical which didnt react to reagents (100% inactive or pipes)
