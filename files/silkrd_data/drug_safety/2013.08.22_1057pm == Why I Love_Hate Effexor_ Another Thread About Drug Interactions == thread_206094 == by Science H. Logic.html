				I&#039;m about to say a lot of honest things and ask some hard questions about drugs. Before I begin, I am NOT TELLING YOU TO MIX DRUGS. I am not responsible if you swallow your medicine cabinet and have a heart attack. Do some goddamn research and understand the risks you&#039;re taking.<br /><br />Now that that&#039;s out of the way, I have sorta been treating myself as a guinea pig albeit doing hundreds of hours of (hobby) reading on pharmacology and having a ChemE degree. I know I am taking risks and I accept it. Imagine a cross between Shulgin and a kid drinking cough medicine to get a dxm trip.<br /><br />I take 225mg effexor (aka venlafaxine hcl, I use generic), 50mg trazodone, and copious piles of medicinal cannabis every day to keep me from giving up on humanity and becoming a hermit.<br /><br />I have successfully (i.e. no unusual or intolerable side effects) taken 25i, 25b, 25c, shrooms, hydrocodone, DOB, DOM, DMT and maybe a couple more I&#039;m forgetting. Now other people may react differently so think before you hurt yourself. I&#039;m a big healthy guy and my genetic background is a mystery until I get my 23andme results.<br /><br />Not all SSRI&#039;s are the same so I am wondering what does the SR community know about effexor? What will happen if I take (pure) MDMA? LSD? Anyone else with effexor experience?<br /><br />Other comments or questions on drug interactions are welcome here as well.

				Thanks vanquish, that pretty much lines up with what I was thinking. I may be able to stop effexor and trazodone all together in a few months so I&#039;ll probably just wait till then to use MDMA again. <br /><br />I&#039;ll start with a smaller dosage (like 0.025g) if I do and work my way up to see if I have any side effects I didn&#039;t have when using mdma before effexor. Of course it could end up not affecting me at all and being a waste of money but I&#039;ll know something new I guess.<br /><br />Also NeverFE has decided to send me a free sample of adderall (maybe he pitied me because I kept losing his lotteries lol). I have never even used adderall before. I should be safe (at least as safe as most people) using adderall on effexor right? I would probably be using it at night anyway, and effexor (which I take early) has a short half-life.

				Effexor is actually an SNRI as it has Norepinephrine action in addition to the Serotonin action.<br /><br />Personally, Effexor amplified my anxiety despite supposedly being a great drug to treat it. When I stopped taking Effexor, I had brain snaps that reminded me of an acid trip- my mind would get stuck in one place then suddenly slingshot back into my head. It&#039;s a fun sensation but not very pleasant when you want to be sober, driving etc.

I have experienced these myself. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what could possible inspire someone to purposefully stop taking effexor for fun. The withdrawal effects are some of the worst of any drug (comparable to benzo withdrawals) and can include grand mal seizures and death. I certainly would not call that a fun sensation. Are you taking effexor recreationally?

				Also LSD seems to work fine and I have not died from serotonin syndrome (yet). This is just my body though so someone else might have a different reaction.

I have mentioned anxiety to my psych several times along-side the depression but he ignores the anxiety part. I source my own benzos from someone I trust. I only started using after I was prescribed effexor to mitigate the side-effects. My mood can be really irritable/anxious some days but a mg or so of clonazepam usually does the trick for me.<br /><br />I said I love/hate effexor because I love that it is (I believe) actually helping with my depression and the side-effects are mostly manageable, but I hate that I have to be dependent on a drug for my well-being, one that even prevents me from enjoying some of my preferred drugs, and I am not looking forward to the process of weaning off of it.

				I only have medium-mild anxiety and I wouldn&#039;t be able to sleep more than 2-4 hours a night after effexor before I was prescribed trazodone. It makes sense that you felt such a strong urge to stop taking effexor with high anxiety already.<br />&nbsp;<br />Trazodone is a slightly sedating antidepressant from what I have read so maybe that would worth asking your psych about. I just have a low dose (50mg) at night for sleeping because my depression leans more towards anhedonia and lack of energy than anxiety during the day.
