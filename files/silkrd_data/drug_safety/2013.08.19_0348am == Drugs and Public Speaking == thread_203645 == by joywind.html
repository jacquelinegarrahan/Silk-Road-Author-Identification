				I have to do a presentation in front of over 500 people this Friday, I have some speed (dextroamphetamine), and I was thinking of taking some to improve my performance and reduce anxiety - is this a good idea or bad idea? Has anyone here tried this?<br /><br />I know that people have used cocaine for public speaking. Cocaine drops used to sold regularly for those who had to do public speaking. Supposedly it was meant to give speakers a smooth and rich speaking voice, but its special ability as an &quot;invigorator&quot; featured prominently in most advertisements. Preachers, with their need to give animated and prolonged sermons, and especially stump preachers that traveled around, were frequent users of cocaine. Stage actors, singers, and teachers took them as well.

				10mg of, say, Adderall I suppose would help with confidence. Makes people chattier than usual, but really depends.<br />For others (those who have performance anxiety), Inderal and/or something like Klonopin would be more helpful.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend Amphetamines, as they can make you more anxious if you are prone to anxiety, especially in front of 500 people. Also, you don&#039;t want to sound like you&#039;ve taken speed, you probably want to sound relaxed and confident, and get your message across. <br /><br />I&#039;d go with 50mg modafinil with 100mg L-Theanine. <br /><br />

				amphetamine only gives anxiety during the come-down. the first few hours it relives all anxiety and makes me super-confident. but maybe people can tell that im on something.

				If you are worried about blushing and other effects of elevated heartrate during public speech, beta blockers might be a good option. In normal doses they would have very little side effects when giving a lecture, though you may want to stand behind some kind of stand to hold on to if the do cause dizziness and such.<br /><br />You could combine things like alprazolam with amphetamines to basciallly speedball your way through the ordeal, but that would take very good timing and could end very badly if mistimed or misdosed.

				How does cocaine normally affect you? I mean, I know you mention how things used to be in public speaking, but consider that in those times publicly re-dosing wasn&#039;t as much of a big deal... if we&#039;re talking about before WWII that is.<br /><br />I think the other suggestions are probably best. If you really need to handle it with something, do it with something predictable and something that will act consistently over time.

				Another combo that has worked wonders for me (I&#039;ve had public speaking anxiety) besides the modafinil + theanine combo is 0.5mg Xanax combined with 1600mg Piracetam and 500mg Choline. <br /><br />Xanax will chill you out even when facing annoying questions. The problem is that xanax messes up with your memory, so there comes the piracetam (greatly enhances verbal skills) and the choline (makes your acetylcholine flow and counters the xanax memory problem). <br /><br />Otherwise there is still the propanolol option for bodily anxiety.

				If they have ever seen you public speaking before i&#039;d say a big fat no. They&#039;re going to know you&#039;re on some sort of stimulant.<br /><br />Though if they&#039;ve never seen you public speaking they will just assume you normally have the mannerisms associated with the drug.

Give it a try. Although you may now choose to order Noopept instead of piracetam: noopept is the hot shit right now in the cognition enhancing world and it is 1000x more potent than Piracetam. I&#039;ve tried it myself and it seems promising. <br />I&#039;ve only abused MJ in my life and I coud definitely tell that piracetam was tremendously helping my memory. After a few days on it, you start remembering amazing lost memories, details and many other things. <br /><br />

				In all honesty, try dropping a few hundred mircograms to a milligram of any 25x-NBOMe compound about 3 maybe 4 hours before going up to speak.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I&nbsp; find that after the nasty comeup you feel nice and have this mellow, shallow euphoria and mood lift. You sorta feel &quot;In Tuned&quot; and &quot;in the moment.&quot;&nbsp; It actually feels quite nice. Though you may have moderate to extreme tracers and trails behind moving objects.&nbsp; <br /><br />Try throwing back about 3 shots of some fine liquor then drop a tab of any 25x-NBOMe product you desire. <br /><br /><br />YOu will kill your performance and all will be grand! And you&#039;ll have a super fun time doing it as well. <br /><br />Take this from someone who actually tried this.

It may slur your speech if taken in excess, but it will also produce things like flushing (facial redness) making you appear less confident or reliable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Beta blockers will inhibit most physical signs of anxiety, though you may want to speak from something you can actually hold on to as they will inhibit a rise in blood pressure and heartbeat too, causing increased risk of fainting.

				It sounds like you have some different experiences but any sort of amphetamine on its own would not be something I&#039;d want to do. It makes me more talkative and confident but can also scatter my thoughts, fluster me, and make me sound disorganized and rushed to the point of un-intelligibility. One time I gave a speech in front of a hundred or so coworkers and took a combo of meth and benzos (I think party clonazepam and part xanax). It worked rather well but I was to the point where things were getting blurry and blacking out parts of my memory so I&#039;d advise a lot of care in that regard. I can&#039;t even say for sure how present I seemed -- I could definitely believe I drifted off but it went pretty well but I almost fell asleep the moment I sat down.<br /><br />Be careful!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				i just went to the doctor and told them im shit scared of public speaking and i need something. i was prescribed 40mg propranolol which i take 90 minutes before my speech. you wont feel much different, you&#039;ll still be nervous but the physical symptoms wont show e.g. you wont have a racing heart, trembling lips, stuttering, sweating etc... it literally blocks the signal to your brain to stop it reacting to adrenaline... you&#039;ll just be really calm but without any drowsy side effects. normally i get sooooo nervous i can barely talk and its just awkward for the audience but the propronolol works a treat, its the only way i can get through a presentation.
