				Hi SR Community!&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;Being a new member I figured first I should introduce myself. I hail from Las Vegas and I am one of those try anything once kind of people which leads me to the point of this topic, I&#039;ve never tried REAL DMT(freebased what I thought was DMT once but that wound me up in the hospital, which is another reason why this community seems so wonderful.) So I&#039;m making this thread to ask the questions I feel are necessary and hopefully it will help other people who are as curious as myself.<br /><br />1. What are the different types of DMT and why? is one better than the other?<br />2. What are the methods of consumption? does it make a difference?<br />3. How much is enough for a single persons first time?<br />4. Where should it be done?(I.E. - Alone, with friends, etc.)<br />5. What should I expect to feel?<br />6. anything else I should know?<br /><br />I&#039;ll give a quick explanation of why I personally want to try it. I heard it was eye opening and can change the way you see the world. I am a workaholic with EXTREME insomnia, I used to rock about 12 xanax a day, it helped, but wound up messing me up in the long run, So I quit everything and detoxed for the last year, I feel its time to give dmt a try for real. I&#039;m looking for the best possible way. price is not a option.<br />Thank you everyone and I look forward to contributing to this board as much as possible.<br />~TaNk~

What are the methods of consumption? does it make a difference?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Smoking (vaporizing, really) is probably the most common method, and is the method I recommend to beginners.&nbsp; It has a somewhat short duration when smoked (&lt;20 minutes, usually), and is generally very intense and quick to come on.&nbsp; DMT can be vaporized by laying the crystal between a bed of herbs (or ash), with a globe (crack) pipe, or with other devices (research &quot;the machine&quot; if interested).&nbsp; There&#039;s also the option of smoking DMT that has been laid onto some sort of herb; this is generally called &quot;changa.&quot;<br />DMT can also be taken orally, but it is normally destroyed by monoamine oxidase, so it must be eaten with some sort of MAOI.&nbsp; This is often what ayahuasca is, though there are many varieties of ayahuasca containing many different plant alkaloids.&nbsp; Oral dosing will be significantly longer acting than vaporizing (a few hours), but less intense and a slower come up.&nbsp; You could also administer it via injection (IV or IM) if you so desired, but that&#039;s more for a clinical setting with an experienced injector/sitter (you&#039;d be gone before you could get the needle out).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20130.msg203664#msg203664">Quote from: tankak47 on April 23, 2012, 09:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.

				Just like every psychedelic, it will be absolutely 100% not how you imagine it.<br /><br />All the words like oneness, god consciousness, LOGOS.. they are all complete and utter fucking shit when it comes to the reality of the psychedelic experience.
