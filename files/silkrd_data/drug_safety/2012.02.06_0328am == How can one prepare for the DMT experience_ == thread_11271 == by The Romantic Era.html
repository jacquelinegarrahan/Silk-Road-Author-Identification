				Hello all,<br /><br />I am new to SR and recently made my first few purchases during the lovely sale this weekend. One of the items I ordered is DMT, which I have not experimented with before. Now, I have done LSD, but never extremely high doses (~300mics is probably my highest, but I have never known the real amount of LSD in the tabs I have tried.) I have tripped a good twenty times on LSD, and maybe half a dozen times on shrooms, of which my highest dose was an eighth of some very potent fungi. I recently began dabbling with MXE, and am having a wonderful time getting close to the hole and even going in once :D <br /><br />But, even though I have some experience with LSD, Shrooms, lots of Weed, some MXE and Opiates, and coke (twice), I feel I am unprepared for what DMT is going to show me or where it is going to take me. Now, hitting the M-Hole was one of the most intense experiences I have had. How would this compare to DMT (I know it is probably a bad question since it is dissoc. vs tryptamine, but I thought I&#039;d ask). Is there any specific reading or film I should utilize in my preparation? I watched DMT: The spirit molecule (the Rick Strassman one), have read a bunch of erowid reports, as well as reports by Terrence Mckenna. I have one friend who has done it, but he claims you cannot truly prepare - you just do it.<br /><br />I am sure some of you may say that if I feel unprepared I should wait, or maybe not even do it, and maybe you&#039;re right. However, I am truly intrigued with what psychedelics and dissoc.s can do and what thety can offer and teach. My depression has since lightened since experimenting with MXE, and I am hoping DMT will provide the same.<br /><br />This is a long post, sorry...<br /><br />tl;dr - What can one who has not done DMT do to prepare for the experience?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Not much you can do to prepare your first time in my opinion, at least above anything you&#039;d do for a normal psychedelic. Have a good set and setting and enjoy. It&#039;s going to rip you from this Earth and teach you a thing or too. ;)<br />

I&#039;ve seen people throw up because of the taste of DMT. <br />And you are likely to get an &quot;oh shit&quot; feeling; I&#039;d be surprised if you didn&#039;t. You will go from sober to the hardest you have ever tripped in 10 seconds and then it will keep going up. A tip I heard is to dose on the higher end if you are prone to fighting psychedelics, as at those doses DMT will simply not let you fight it. <br />

				Try to use a vaporizer-pipe or freebase pipe if you can. Don&#039;t eat right beforehand; earlier that day eat raw fruits and vegetables. Before you take it (after you load the pipe) take a few minutes to meditate and clear your mind of all conscious activity. When you inhale use your diaphragm and intercostal muscles to expand your thoracic cavity; this reduces the likelyhood of coughing (and therefore under-dosing). Try to do it outdoors if weather permits.<br /><br />And yeah, don&#039;t fight it, it&#039;ll win.

				I recently picked up a vaporizer pipe that i&#039;ll also be trying with DMT, but I&#039;ve used a bubbler many times with you method you mentioned (screens, ash, dmt, ash). I&#039;d recommend just enough water to pull the flame lightly through it. Also as Tryptamine said, slow your breathing or meditate beforehand and be sure to hold in each toke as long as possible. I find 15-20 seconds to be about right, but you can almost feel when the hit is done rushing through your body.<br /><br />As for being prepared, the entire DMT dimension is completely different from our own. As your friend said, there is no real way to prepare for that. It completely blew my mind after my first experience with DMT. I found myself staring in the mirror, hands on my head, thinking &quot;It is simply incredible that I could just experience something so rich, from hitting a pipe.&quot; Overall though, it is an incredibly positive experience so long as you are in the correct mindset going in. Daytime, nighttime, doesn&#039;t really matter as long as there are no distractions. On lower-end breakthrough doses I can still hear everything around me (talking, cars driving by, TVs) and it really takes away from the trip. Although I did get to hear about the 7 billionth baby being born while on a DMT trip, which was WONDERFUL!<br /><br />In regards to your statement about the &#039;fear and trembling,&#039; expect that initial anxiety before and while starting to hit the pipe. Once you have a breakthrough there is nothing to fear except beauty itself. As you said, do your best to submit and become an observer.

That&#039;ll usually give me a really chill headspace, some minor OEV&#039;s, but can ease you into the DMT experience.<br /><br />It seems most can get a breakthrough at 30-50mg. I tend to have a high tolerance for psychedelics and prefer 50-75mg, but still 30mg can be plenty. Main thing is the breathing, it really helps. Once you are breaking through it is a truly incredible experience ripe for learning and loving. Be sure to post a trip report! Happy blast off!

				Also. Most important piece of advice: If you don&#039;t &#039;break through&#039;, DON&#039;T try again immediately after. Wait at least a few hours. If you do try again too soon, and do take a sufficient dose, it will not be pleasant.

				So glad someone posted this question, I watched that same movie, &quot;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&quot; on netflix Saturday night after getting home and still wired on Molly. The whole thing just blew my mind, but I was left wondering if the trips being talked about were accurate. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had a lot of experience with psychedelics, but never this one. I&#039;m a fan of tripping alone as to let myself really let go and blast off so to speak. Is this something I would be okay doing alone or would I need a babysitter?<br /><br />Is there a recommended vendor in the US that others have used?

Both of which could be done on your own if you are comfortable with it.

				I&#039;m not a huge fan of DMT: The Spirit Molecule; while I appreciate that Strassman was able to actually do studies on it, I am certain that the context of the study (injected DMT solution, white fluorescent phenol-scented hospital room, constant observation) was responsible for the experiences reported by the subjects (alien abduction, being &#039;probed&#039;, et cetera). If anything I&#039;ve found the power of DMT to be far beyond anything portrayed in that book, even when he starts talking about &#039;alternate channels of reality&#039;. So take his results with a grain of salt, at least.<br /><br />No disrespect to any DMT vendors, but it&#039;s most rewarding (and cost-effective) to do the extraction yourself. You can do a 2 step STB and cheaply produce an unlimited amount of jungle spice for yourself. If you titrate it right you can still end up with an extremely pure product.

				@gharyeee Thanks for the tips, I think for the first time I will take my journey alone and stick to my lovesac for my lift of spot so if I do drop the bowl it won&#039;t break. I&#039;ll keep that in mind, but I think for my first time I might blast off alone so I can truly let myself go without worrying about the other person, I&#039;ll keep a friend in the know so if I call freaking out they know whats up lol. I will pick those 2 up and give them a read thanks!<br /><br />@Tryptamine I did notice how a few of the subjects commented that they were unsure about the setting as well, but after they took off it didn&#039;t matter. You are right though I&#039;m sure that did influence some of the trip. I&#039;m sure with a few simple google searches I could find how to do it, but how in depth is it? As I live in an apartment, so smell and all that is a factor for me.

				The most simplified, &#039;DIY&#039; method possible is to mix water, Mimosa Hostilis RootBark, NaOH or Ca(OH)2, and hexane in a wine bottle or HDPE milk jug, shake thoroughly, and pour/pipette the top layer (hexane) off once they separate. You then put the hexane in a glass container in a freezer, at which point crystals will precipitate out.

				It came today!! which is awesome because it is my first SR completion and it only took 2 days!!!! I think it is because it is close to where I reside. Sweet...<br /><br />Anywho, I think I should probably hold off because I need to order a .001g scale since I currently only have a shitty .1g one. So, in a week or two, I should be blasting off...&nbsp; However...if someone can recommend a safe way to &#039;eye-out&#039; a &#039;breakthrough&#039; dose, I guess I could blast off right now, haha...<br /><br />It&#039;s from elvis, and since I ordered during the sale last weekend, i assume its 400mg packed into a little blue baggie. i ordered 200mg, but the sale said he would double it :D<br /><br />i am guessing i should just wait, but if anyone can provide a safe &#039;eye-out&#039; method for a breakthrough, i am feeling good :)<br /><br /><br />I feel ready!<br /><br />Will report back, for sure

				Honestly when I began smoking DMT i was acting the same exact question and had a somewhat-broken 0.1g scale. However, I don&#039;t even weigh it anymore. You could also place the bag of 0.4g on your 0.1g scale and remove 0.1g to place in another bag, giving you a bit of an easier way to estimate your doses. If you use a key or similar sized item and take a small scoop out of the bag (about 1cm down the key) I&#039;d say it&#039;s around 10-15mg. 30mg is probably around the size of a US dime. <br /><br />@Tryptamine<br />I agree that Strassman&#039;s results weren&#039;t the best, but I applaud him for the effort he took to do the studies. Lots of great ideas in the movie, as well as lots of speculation, but I found the articles I linked to are a bit more accurate. Based on my experiences at least. The &quot;Wee Bit More about DMT&quot; was written somewhat in response to Strassman&#039;s book and mentions your concerns as well (hospital setting, etc.). It is a great, and different, point of view and shares some fairly in depth details of the DMT experience.
