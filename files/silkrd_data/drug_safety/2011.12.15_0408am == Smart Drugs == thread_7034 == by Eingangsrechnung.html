				Hey guys! As I have a lot of stress with a really sick father I have to care for, which costs a lot of time, I thought about taking smart drugs to keep up with university.<br /><br />What products are out there? Links?<br />How often can I use them without getting addicted?<br />How do they actually work? <br />What is your experience with smart drugs? Which ones are the best?<br /><br />Thank you for your answers!&nbsp; ;D

				The type of drug that has the best track record and the most studies on it showing increases in concentration, stamina, memory etc (you know, all that good stuff you need for university) is the amphetamine family: Adderall and Dexedrine are two pharamceuticals, and &#039;speed&#039; and meth are street versions of it.<br /><br />You may hear people talk about nootropic drugs, or weird research chemicals... but when it comes down to it you want an amphetamine.

				Thank you for your response! Kind of scares me that they are compared to meth. ;D <br />Is the addictiveness of Adderall etc. really that high?<br /><br />I did a little bit of research and it seems like Dexedrine is better than Adderall because you don&#039;t get shaky or anything. Can someone confirm that? Unfortunately there is only 1 seller of Dexedrine here on SR and he only sells the 15mg version which seems like a pretty high dosage, doesn&#039;t it? What about Modafinil which is pretty cheap?

				&nbsp;:) I have 2 sources of ritalin and adderall online. PM me for more info. These sites have rave reviews online and packs discreetly. In one forum, the packing of one of this sellers was described as &quot;ninja packing&quot;.heheh. I&#039;m asking you to PM me because<br /><br />1) Having PMs all the time makes me feel important.<br />2) One seller has directly told me not to mention about his availability of adderall online.<br /><br />The price of ritalin starts from $1 to $2.3.

				I&#039;ve taken modafinil when I&#039;ve needed a bit of a boost for about 8 years now. The longest stretch was 10 weeks in 2008 when I was finishing my MSc.<br /><br />100mg, twice a day is a good dosage. At doses of 300mg +, rather than boosting my concentration I just felt jumpy and had palpitations, a little like drinking too much coffee, concentration was massively diminished.<br />My routine was to get up at 5AM, have strong coffee and 100mg modafinil. I could then work without a break from 6AM to 2PM. Then lunch, more coffee and another modafinil, then work until 9PM. I found it good for revision, my brain was like a sponge when I was on it. It&#039;s also good for bashing out essays. <br /><br />You must get adequate sleep though, if you&#039;re sleep deprived modafinil will give no enhancement and at best will make you feel normal.<br /><br />Oh and it makes your piss smell terrible&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

I got about 2.5 hours of sleep last night (about 5 hours the night before) , popped 150mg armodafinil in the morning + coffee.<br /><br />I am sitting at work now and I feel below baseline, although I can;t imagine how I would feel without the pill.<br /><br />I am pretty sure I will get through the day with no problems, but I feel my cognitive processes are a little impaired, I had to pop some paracetamol because my body felt achey (it&#039;s normal for me if I didn&#039;t get enough sleep).<br /><br />Overall I really prefer LOW doses of dexedrine(10mg-15mg in 2 doses throughout the day).<br />Gives me more focus and energy.<br /><br />Modafinil gives me less of the positive effects, but it still has most of the negative effects (some irritation, inpatience, I don;t feel like participating in social interactions).<br /><br />Unfortunately it&#039;s impossible to find such a solid vendor as Coherence in the ADHD pharms niche :)

				While I have not used this myself, I have heard very good things about Piracetam. There are a fair number of reports on Erowid (among others) which should give you a good idea of its general effects. I would start off with a small amount as it doesn&#039;t seem to work for everyone. <br /><br />Just a heads up if you&#039;re looking for an actual smart drug and/or want to avoid the amphetamine family. It&#039;s inexpensive, so it may be worth a try.

				I think he means nootropics, things like 5-HTP and Piracetam. I&#039;ve heard piracetam is great. Also didn&#039;t shulgin say that 2c-d or 2c-h seemed like a cognitive enhancer? I&#039;d love to hear from anyone who has tried Piracetam. Especially in conjunction with MDMA, but that&#039;s a lil off topic.

				Modafinil makes me physically &quot;speedy&quot; and made my piss smell ultra rank. The rank pee is what really turned me off about this drug. <br /><br />Adderall XR&#039;s will fuck you up like meth will, except more bad side effects. XR&#039;s dick around in your body for at least 12 hours - like a friend that overstays and you&#039;re just waiting for him to fucking leave. <br /><br />Adderall IR are cool. You can break them into quarters or halves when needed. I take a quarter of a 10 mg tab pre workout. It&#039;s awesome.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ritalin IR - these are pretty cool too. <br /><br />meth - good stuff but hard to dose unless you have a milligram scale. Rule of thumb is: if you can&#039;t get a boner = you&#039;ve taken too much. I don&#039;t know the rule of thumb for the ladies. The day you begin hardcore smoking or IV&#039;ing meth is the day you will have to rethink your strategy to reduce the stress in your life. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure a lot of people would quit cigarettes if the only way they could have nicotine was in a pill or gum. Smoking a drug changes everything. <br /><br />On a final note, I sense that you are on a dark road, with darker days to come. I find that the best way to improve one&#039;s life is just &quot;simplify&quot;. Smart drugs, amphetamines, and designer drugs etc will only add another layer of &quot;complexity&quot; to your life. On the darkest, coldest night of your life, all these layers of complexity will crush you under their weight. Prepare yourself for that day, simplify by purging everything you don&#039;t need in your life at this moment. <br /><br />

				I took a lot of piracetam for a while, I recommend it.

YMMV.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to try it, you may need to take a fairly high attack dose (2400-4000mg) in the first few days.<br /><br />That said... piracetam as part of an MDMA preload definitely had some noticeable potentiation effects - but this was also in combination with a 5-htp, glutamine, DLPA, and tyrosine cocktail.
