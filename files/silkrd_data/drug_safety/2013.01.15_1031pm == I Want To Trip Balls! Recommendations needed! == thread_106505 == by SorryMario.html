				Ok, a little background. I&#039;m a heavy weed smoker and on again/off again tweaker. As far as psychedelics go, I&#039;ve done shrooms a few times and an unknown (but probably low) dose of LSD once. The only effects I get from shrooms (eating half an 8th) are some slight appearance of movement if I looked at something that had pattern (basically looks like the movement you see in optical illusions and nothing more). Acid was the same, only maybe a tiny bit more movement in the patterns and lasted a few hours more than shrooms. So both experiences were somewhat interesting, but way too subtle and ultimately a disappointment.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Other people tell me they get colors bleeding out of the walls, fractal patterns, mystical experiences, ego death... and I&#039;m feeling like I missing out!&nbsp; ??? :o<br /><br />So I plead to the psychonauts here, give me some good recommendations of substances/doses that will blow my mind. Something that can send you off on a good heavy visual trip for at least a few hours or a day, but not last more than a day (like DOB supposedly does) or be over with in a few minutes (like DMT). I&#039;d also prefer something that isn&#039;t known for making you puke.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Suggestions?

				Sounds like you need a bigger dose of LSD. I&#039;ve experienced all the effects you mentioned while just on LSD. However, the craziest, most intense visuals I&#039;ve ever had was on MDMA + LSD.

				since you haven&#039;t gotten much from lsd or mushrooms, i&#039;d recommend trying one of those again. 300 mcg lsd or 1/8 of mushrooms should provide ample effects. if you really want your mind blown, smoke dmt. just remember to be safe and respect these powerful substances! they are wonderful tools and should be treated as such. :)

				UPDATE:<br /><br />5 blotters of LSD (Tessellated&#039;s 200ug) are currently in-transit&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I&#039;m in the planning stages of the first trip. I intend to take just one blotter and see what happens. I&#039;ll be alone for this first one, but I&#039;ve got a big screen TV, stereo, and video games to keep me entertained. Open world/sandbox games will probably be a blast, unless of course the acid fries me too much to function lol! Also got a nice collection of HORROR movies - might be interesting to see how freaky Texas Chainsaw Massacre is while tripping! :O But I&#039;ll wait at least a couple of hours into it so I have a feel for how it&#039;s going before trying that!<br /><br />BTW, what is the best way to store blotter LSD? I&#039;m thinking wrapped in foil (to keep light out), but should I keep it refrigerated or anything?

				Keep the acid in the freezer if you&#039;re planning on storing it for a while. Also keep it away from light, heat, and moisture.<br /><br />I highly recommend taking two tabs after reading about your past experiences.&nbsp; I had never tripped on LSD before before ordering from him and two seems like the perfect dose (for me at least).

				If you really want your mind to be blown you should try some poppers with your trip. It will amplify the effects exponentially for a few minutes and can re-dosed multiple times. I&#039;ll send you a free bottle if you&#039;d like.

				5-meo-mipt. 12-13mgs will have you tripping hard, but not like LSD, well it is but different.<br />That amount the body load is very strong. Throw 50-80mg of mdma into the mix an hour or 2 in. <br /><br />Just be sure to have your doses ready first.<br /><br />Trying to weigh powder whilst beaming on Moxy is really, really hard. :P

				Hooby is right. Nix on the freezer. I&#039;m pretty sure I fucked up some of Fatburger&#039;s tabs that way. An old deadhead known on Shroomery (I believe) as ChinaCat recommends a quality ziplock bag shut into a heavy book. Try to keep the book in a basement or any cool, dry space where the temperature is unlikely to fluctuate.

				Well I just dropped my first blotter of Tessellated&#039;s LSD about an hour and a half ago.<br /><br />It&#039;s funny - about an hour into it I was thinking &quot;hmm, other than a somewhat odd body feel, everything still seems perfectly normal.&quot; Thought maybe I needed some stimulation so I looked at some trippy images online and thought &quot;wow, these REALLY are trippy images!&quot; as everything started moving and bending. Part of it is because the images incorporate optical illusions, but it&#039;s definitely way enhanced over what optical illusions usually look like.<br /><br />Now tree branches are all intertwining and swirling together. Heh... I&#039;m reminded of Bob Ross and his &quot;happy little trees&quot;. Yeah it&#039;s a lovely day to go outdoors I think. Colors are looking brighter, so my eyes are probably getting dilated.<br /><br />Anyway, things I look at are subtly distorting and waving more and more. This is hella cool! The words I type look like they&#039;re floating on water or something. Damn, even the keys on the keyboard are wandering. This is looking to be a mighty interesting day!<br /><br />Is there a good thread to post trip reports? linky? I might something to contribute to it sometime soon!

				(hopefully this will make sense to at least one person)<br /><br />UPDATE: the world is alive with bending and swirling distortions. Whoooooooaaaaah.... Outdoors is 1000x better than indoors! Need an open-space visual environment to experience this fully. Are the branches waving in the wind, or is the movement all in my mind? Impossible to tell.<br /><br />Rainbow fractal tracers dancing away to infinity leaving crazy swirling colors in their wake. One moment it&#039;s subtle and the next it&#039;s completely engrossing, then it&#039;s gone, it&#039;s back, it&#039;s always there but went unnoticed. Everything&#039;s too normal... everything is getting really weird... but not really... but now it&#039;s incomprehensibly weird... now it&#039;s not. It&#039;s both. It&#039;s neither It always has been. It never was. The amazing non-reality is always here/there. A blank white canvas that already holds every color that can be seen.<br /><br />Every closer look opens many rabbit-holes of dizzying complexity. The paradox of that thing that will not be named, the non-existant identity. Something that can be experienced but never known.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m starting to get why it&#039;s called &quot;mind expanding&quot; and it&#039;s only hour 3 after a single dose. An infinite number of tangents can be made. Can only imagine what higher doses must bring on!

				If you really want visuals go with a good size dose of 2C-E or 25I-NBOME but if you are looking for life changing go with 500 ug of LSD and 4 hours in take 100mg of MDMA and 70mg of MDA once the roll kicks in pack up the DMT and blast off

				Well 200ug LSD has been quite enjoyable! I could&#039;ve stared at the trees forever but it started getting dark. All of the vines and branches appeared to be in constant motion, growing and intertwining around one another like snakes. Enormous fun to look at! Miniscule rainbow threads/fractals briefly appear around blurred objects, and words on the computer screen are still subtly slipping and sliding and growing/shrinking and occasionally little bits of them seemed to melt into pixelated rainbow puddles (it&#039;s a dirty spot on my monitor, but I&#039;ll wait to clean it until after I&#039;m done tripping on it).<br /><br />It&#039;s also pretty easy to become lost in my own thoughts (which I have a natural affinity towards anyway). <br /><br />Definitely gave me better effects than the unknown dose from a while back. Now that being said, it&#039;s not quite &quot;mind-blowing&quot;, at least not at 200ug level. Colorful visuals are only momentary / sporadic.<br /><br />I have 800ug left and next time (next weekend if all goes well) it&#039;s either going to be 400ug or the whole 800ug. I&#039;m thinking maybe 800ug, but I&#039;m not looking to be reckless.... what are the effect differences between 400ug and 800ug?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106505.msg776034#msg776034">Quote from: Oh The Places Youll go on January 30, 2013, 01:41 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you really want visuals go with a good size dose of 2C-E or 25I-NBOME but if you are looking for life changing go with 500 ug of LSD and 4 hours in take 100mg of MDMA and 70mg of MDA once the roll kicks in pack up the DMT and blast off<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Both 2C-E and 25i sound really interesting - especially the visuals!

				I have never tripped harder than i have off a high dose of dxm. There is something about being dissociated and tripping that really makes you trip balls. Now, when i say trip the hardest. I mean that it was the hardest mentally. I find lsd opened my mind more than any other, followed by the 2c chemicals. The thing that had me tripping the hardest in a sense of the longest and most intense visuals i&#039;ve ever had in my life was DOC. That drug literally took my breath away when i focused on the colors. It&#039;s an amazing drug, but damn does it last long. It made me want lsd since lsd felt shorter.

				Last week I&#039;ve smoked approx. 300mg Changa.<br />Well, what can I say, I&#039;ve found my drug of choice, after trying to smoke DMT and failing due to fucking lack of smoking technique, I&#039;ve decided to stick with Changa.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen something that beautiful in my entire life, when I was coming down from my second trip I went to the bathroom and it felt like I&#039;d be in a jungle, normaly I can hear cars, but this time I heard birds, lol.<br /><br />If you fail on smoking DMT, then smoke Changa, it&#039;s foolproof.

				Well I threw caution to the wind and did the whole 800ug.<br /><br />I&#039;m sad to say it was a complete disappointment.

				Get an ice bong with some additional screens, order some Changa, prepare yourself a heroic dose and embrace the experience.<br />I&#039;ve smoked about ten times Changa and I think I&#039;ve had two breakthroughs (after I&#039;ve smoked those heroic doses [70mg+ DMT]), while landing back on planet earth, a friend of mine has been sitting in a chair, everything&#039;s seemed to be surreal.<br /><br />Afterwards I&#039;ve laughed about reality, like knowing the truth, which didn&#039;t frighten me, but it simply amazed me.<br /><br />I recommend putting on some headphones and listening to your favorite music, turning off the lights, taking one single big hit, lying in bed and closing your eyes.<br /><br />Funny thing: After smoking Changa my dreams become so vivid and I&#039;m able to remember every single detail of it, even some days after smoking it. Like today, I woke up early and fell back to sleep for about six times and every &quot;short&quot; dream was different, but very clear.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely continue smoking heroic doses, the hyperspace awaits us all.

				My most intense trip was:<br />800 ug LSD + 25 mg 2C-E + 18 mg 2C-P<br />I also took .25 mg alprazolam because I was afraid of my heart going too fast.<br /><br />This trip took me beyond any other trip of my life and allowed me to transcend into the deepest levels of sound, vision, and cognition. It has taken years to fully integrate and comprehend everything that I experienced on that trip.

				2C-P is more of a head trip with visual distortions. The visual distortions look very cartoony and actually can seem to be total hallucinations. For example, one time on 2C-P I was sitting out on a park bench looking at the clouds in the sky and noticed that they werent clouds, but rather the evolutionary progression of gnomes or trolls. It was really weird/funny/crazy and I just laughed. Other visuals I&#039;ve had were of vines growing up the walls from carpets. Mentally, it&#039;s kinda similar to cocaine, if that makes any sense. If you ever do high quality cocaine, you get this state of mind that&#039;s strangely like LSD. I may be the only one that feels this way but that&#039;s how I felt on 2C-P. I described it to some friends as psychedelic coke. Not in the ROA, but in the way it feels mentally. Definitely a bit stimulating but not in a bad way. I personally enjoyed it, but I needed higher doses in order to experience a full-blown trip. In combination with the LSD and 2C-E (2C-E is my favorite phenethylamine), the 2C-P created this really cool backdrop upon which the other two psychedelics could mingle and play out. Get enough 2C-P to play with different doses. Everyone is different.

				Thank you for the thorough description, much appreciated brother! :) I thoroughly enjoy 2C-B (my favorite phenethylamine), but 2C-E was far from my liking. I experienced a heavy body load with 2C-E that I just couldn&#039;t ignore. I&#039;ll try grabbing a couple hundred milligrams and playing around with it. It seems like it could be a fun thing to add in combination with other drugs, especially LSD. Cheers!
