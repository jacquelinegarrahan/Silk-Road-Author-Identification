				ok so me and my buddy are wanting to do some of NDA&#039;s MDMA at work tonight.. a little info..<br /><br />we work in a setting where the music is loud, and the crowd is fun.. that&#039;s all i can reveal..<br /><br />my question is.. what is a good dose to take without it interfering with our job duties and making it too obvious we are not sober, but enough for us to have a fairly good buzz going?<br /><br />PS.. please keep replies focused on answering my question, i don&#039;t want to hear about ethics or moral about rolling at work.. thanks!

				I would recommend a drug other than MDMA. You can appear sober on most levels of MDMA, but the important thing is that it will make you not want to. Sure, you can hold a normal conversation and leave much of the empathy, fast talking, and euphoria out of it, but...why would you, when you&#039;re excited and love everything?<br /><br />Perhaps low doses of amphetamine, or a bit of coke?

In high school one of my buddies that i worked with took E at work...and rolled crazy balls. Like puking/sweating/massive pupils hard. He was acting like a total fag towards our boss too. He got fired the next day. He said he felt like he was acting completely normal.<br /><br />Go with some coke.

				80mg. It will be subtle, and you will wonder why people like MDMA so much, but it will keep you from going balls to the wall.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you don&#039;t take MDMA at work. And no, don&#039;t do coke or speed either.

				You only get a handful of truly magical MDMA experiences, don&#039;t waste them! (I&#039;m not saying MDMA can&#039;t be enjoyed more than a handful of times, but the magic does wear off after a few times for a lot of people)

				I wouldn&#039;t advise you to take MDMA while in a party setting when you are unable to join in the fun. Save a drug as fun as MDMA for a time when you are able to appreciate it for what it is.
