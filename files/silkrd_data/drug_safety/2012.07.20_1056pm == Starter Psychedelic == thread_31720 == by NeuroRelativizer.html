				Psychedelics. Some of you know &#039;em and love &#039;em, some of you are curious as to just what they are, maybe eager to try one.<br /><br />But where to start?<br />~There&#039;s the old standards, LSD and psilocybin mushrooms<br />~There&#039;s the less lauded salvia<br />~There&#039;s a plethora of research chems<br />~Then there&#039;s DMT<br /><br />In my experience, between LSD and shrooms, a low does of LSD is a better stepping stone out of conventional reality. Shrooms tend to still be more &quot;trippy&quot; at lower doses, meaning for me at least that even at lower doses it starts to work on your ability to seem normal and regularly functional to sober people. LSD, on the other hand, has shown to be remarkably clear headed and functional below around 400 mcg, while still having a very apparent effect. Besides being more functional, LSD can be less disorienting to the uninitiated than shrooms are (I find shrooms to be relatively chaotic while acid has more of a smooth flow to it&#039;s energy).<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried salvia at less than a massive breakthrough dose, and that&#039;s something I would not suggest to a first timer. Ever. In fact, I&#039;m inclined to recommend that one grow salvia and develop a relationship with it before delving, as I did not and I got the shit scared outta me.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t done much with RCs, either, mostly experimented with something that was supposed to be 2c-i, though my experienced friend claimed it wasn&#039;t. Spent 3 days on it the first time I tried it, redosing 4-6 times a day. While LSD feels fulfilling, like a full course spiritual meal, the sc-i was like candy. You know those movies where the main characters have some super power, but it&#039;s bad for them to use it but feels so good they can&#039;t help it? It was like that. At one point, my five senses and my thoughts became so overstimulated that I could only perceive 5 of the 6 at once, and they constantly melted into each other such as sights into smells and touch into thought and thought into taste. Curiously, I did have enough control to simply switch that off and walk down to the mall with a giant fucking kid-in-a-candy-shop smile on my face. I wouldn&#039;t recommend that for beginners despite that, as I don&#039;t think that using, candy psychedelic feeling is the right way to start this path.<br /><br />Lastly, DMT. Haven&#039;t had my breakthrough yet, but I have had numerous low doses, and there&#039;s a reason I went ahead and took single tokes before learning how to get a proper breakthrough. I tried the first time, almost made it, and was informed that I just wasn&#039;t ready yet. For five minutes I was clear headed, relaxed, had geometric visual effects like everything clicking into place when I looked at it, and I could hear the much talked about &quot;machine elves.&quot; Heard them as tiny whirring and clicking of intricate machinery, and my subconscious interpreted and fed the translation up to me. It was a wonderful conversation, and at the end I felt as refreshed as if I had taken the perfect nap.<br /><br />Seriously, low dose DMT for the first time. It&#039;s like the greeter at the door who turns out to be the owner and CEO.
