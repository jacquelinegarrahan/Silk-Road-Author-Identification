				I had a 250mg bag from Missit, figured my day off would be a nice time to try this RC for the first time.&nbsp; Based on erowid trip reports, 150 seemed like a good solid dose for most of the day.&nbsp; To shy on the safer side I figured I&#039;d take exactly half the 250mg bag.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hour later, felt nothing.&nbsp; Tried another half of what was left (~70mg making almost 200mg).&nbsp; I am not 3.5 hours after the initial dose, I feel nothing.&nbsp; Like literally almost no different than normal, I&#039;ve even yawned a few times. <br /><br />My tolerance to amphetamines is very small... I rarely use them I&#039;m more of an opiod guy but I had a little cash sitting in SR and wanted to try something that might be like a cheaper alternative to adderall. <br /><br />What is everyone else&#039;s experience with this?&nbsp; Is it possible this batch is bad?&nbsp; Maybe the chemical just has no effect on me?&nbsp; Do people regularly dose more than 250mg?&nbsp; By the way I just parachuted the powder, nothing fancy...

				Interesting, I have a half gram on its way, should be here tomorrow.&nbsp; I will let you know my results.&nbsp; I have read nothing but good things about 4-FA and almost have to assume that it must not be 4-FA.&nbsp; How long ago did you order it and did you let Missit know?&nbsp;

				I&#039;m just reporting what I&#039;ve heard, but I have been on SILC when someone has tried Missit&#039;s Methylone and they reported no effects several hours in. So I will guess it is Missit&#039;s product and nothing that is wrong on your end.

				its best not to take any 4-FA. Just throw it away and buy one of the more common drugs, the high is better and in general they are safer

				Hmm this is a disconcerting thread to come across.<br /><br />I hope not all of his/her products are poor/fake, got a bunch of etizolam on the way, just cuz they&#039;re pills doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they&#039;re real ... and they better be !<br /><br />I will update this post when I receive them (its been a few weeks heh) if they work or not

				My 4-fa (sourced on the clearnet) gave me very bad effects at 10mg. I got a raging headache, and was EXTREMELY irritable for weeks. I&#039;d taken it at such a low dose just incase it was mislabeled, but lab testing indicated it wasn&#039;t mislabeled. I appear to just be way overly sensitive to it. =P

				I took the entire 250mg 4-FA, no effects at all.&nbsp; I have messaged her on SR about it...<br /><br />The order I made the week before was for Klonopin, which were of great quality.<br /><br />I wonder if this was a mistake, bad batch, or knowingly sent bunk product.<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep everyone posted.

It&#039;s an amazingly fun substance and one of the best out there right now. 80-120 mgs will get you going. 150 mgs+ if you&#039;re a die hard stimulant user.

				Just got this response from Missit<br /><br />&quot;<br />Purity is high, and when researched in lab rats, 40mg is the lowest active dose that was common.<br /><br />We do not condone human consumption and doing such will blacklist you from future orders.<br /><br />Novelty and Licensed Scientific Use Only.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Missit<br />&quot;<br /><br />I understand these substances aren&#039;t &quot;for human consumption&quot;, but come on this is Silk Road... you are already protected and shouldn&#039;t need disclaimers like this.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;m not getting a refund...<br /><br />Given the circumstances of research chemicals (no one can prove or really knows if everyone should be affected the same by every weird new chemical) and the fact that it was under $10, I&#039;m gonna leave me feedback at 5 because it was shipped fine I&#039;ll give the seller the benefit of the doubt, but I won&#039;t be ordering from them again.<br /><br />Even if I do have a weird immunity to 4-FA, I&#039;d suggest you order yours somewhere else...

				<br /><br />i get my 4-FA from the clearweb, there are a variety of good vendors out there but their stock comes and goes.&nbsp; search for a RC forum to get reviews.<br /><br />i generally take 50-60 mg for studying or energy, and 100-175 for recreational use.&nbsp; never had over 200 mg.&nbsp; high doses tend to make me nauseous, i think due to it&#039;s effect on serotonin.&nbsp; don&#039;t sniff it!!&nbsp; no matter how you crush it, it forms jagged shards that will hurt like nothing else ever has before..&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\<br /><br />4-FA is actually a great type of speed.&nbsp; it blows away everything except maybe meth.&nbsp; it has about half the strength of dexedrine by weight, so use that as a guide for dosing.&nbsp; <br />it slides towards the empathogenic scale, maybe a half point more then dexedrine.&nbsp; it is very relaxing and has minimal PNS effects if it&#039;s good product.&nbsp; <br />enjoying 150 mg right now, as I still wait on my order of meth on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />4-FA is a great sexual enhancer, but seems to be the reverse of other speed.&nbsp; as a female, it actually makes it impossible for me to orgasm lol&nbsp; &nbsp;;).&nbsp; but my male partner, he can easily get it up even during the peak (but it still takes him about 2 hrs of work)&nbsp; &nbsp;:)&nbsp; .&nbsp; but it makes touch and sensation incredible, like a perfect blend of mdma and meth.<br />only thing about it that sucks is the tail end is VERY long.&nbsp; on a plus, there is virtually no come-down (like no cravings, it&#039;s very very slow and gentle).&nbsp; but some PNS effects linger for about 24 hrs after last dose.&nbsp; sleep is possible, however, even 6 hrs after dosing (with copious cannabis).<br />take 5-HTP afterward!!!&nbsp; it really helps.<br /><br />*destiny*

				months ago there was a batch going around the RC market that had no effect.&nbsp; and i had never tried 4-FA so i swore something was going on.&nbsp; then i got some real 4-FA and was like &quot;WOW, now this is a drug&quot;.&nbsp; usually the good stuff is either like freshly fallen snow or tiny heavy shards.<br />sorry i went off on a tangent earlier.&nbsp; but yea if there&#039;s nothing from 250 there&#039;s something definitely up.&nbsp; and that batch is still out there maybe it&#039;s from that?<br /><br />*destiny*

				I hate to say it, but missit is not someone I would personally buy from.&nbsp; I have the following observations:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; For the longest time, missit and btcbuddy were accusing each other of being scammers.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done transactions with btcbuddy; not a scammer<br />2.&nbsp; missit lists lots of free products for sale.&nbsp; I think this is done to boost the overall feedback score after a series of bad reviews.&nbsp; From digital downloads to &quot;hugs&quot;, it&#039;s obvious that it&#039;s for inflating the score.<br />3.&nbsp; missit is on the scammer&#039;s list:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3520.0<br />4.&nbsp; missit rewards out of escrow transactions; see the vendor&#039;s page&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/21735<br />5.&nbsp; Threads like this; there are others.<br />6.&nbsp; Threats to blacklist you if you leave bad feedback or mention your poor experience on the forums.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that mileage may vary from person to person.&nbsp; I have no experience with missit, nor will I ever.<br />

				Hi guys, where did you get your 4-FA from on clearnet? I had a bad batch and have received low quality stuff (juklislab). Have to take 200 for a 1,5 hour high, weak stuff.
