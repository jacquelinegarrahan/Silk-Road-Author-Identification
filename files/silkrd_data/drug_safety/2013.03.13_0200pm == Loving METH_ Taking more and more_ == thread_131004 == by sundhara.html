				i think you can use meth pretty responsibly. Coke IV is more addictive than meth IV for sure.&nbsp; Gotta love these shows if some drug is gaining popularity they just start making shows about it with some down and out junkies who would be addicted to other drugs no matter which ones either way because they&#039;re addicts. Also meth gets boring.

It&#039;s a short high that will waste your money very quickly and you won&#039;t get much out of the drug.

Go to a head shop or Asian mini mart, and buy a bulb (&quot;rose&quot;) pipe, aka &quot;oil burner&quot; for about 5 bucks. In fact, you can find them for sale on SR.
