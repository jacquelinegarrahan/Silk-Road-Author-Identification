				Gonna experience DMT for the first time this weekend and in preparation I have been doing a fair amount of research on other forums trying to get a good idea on the best method for smoking it. The fail proof way appears to be by using a free base pipe, but I have heard other accounts of people vaporizing the substance and that&#039;s the method I am interested in. I have a Volcano digit and have the vapor pad that goes along with it, but the problem I am having is finding the right temperature to vape it at. The more posts I read the more confusing it gets as some people suggest low temps (160 degrees F) while some suggest maxing their volcano out (440+ degrees F). Are there any vets out there that can shed some light on appropriate temperatures to vaporize DMT at?

				Using a Volcano is definitely the way to go, it&#039;s clean and easy.&nbsp; I find that setting the temperature to &#039;8&#039; out of &#039;10&#039; on my analog is ideal, you can probably figure out what the comparable digital temp is.

Went through my trial and error yesterday and first tried using a bong with the spice sitting on some tobacco. I have to say that that was the worst idea ever, not only was it harsh as hell, but I also spent the next 20 minutes contemplating the idea that people actually some tobacco out of a bong. Im sure it would have been a lot nicer for me if I had the spice of some nice herb, but getting ready for drug tests has me staying away from my &quot;drug&quot; of choice. Later that night I busted out the volcano and tuned it to 380 degrees F. Worked out great, it seemed to vape everything well and filled the bag with a good four hits of vapor. I didnt have a break through like other peoples have stated in their trip reports, but I think my dosage was a little light, only .03g. I also think the temperature was a little high so I&#039;ll play with it some more and keep this post rolling with my attempts.
