				I took MDMA about 1.5 week ago but it was a very small dose. Very small to the point where I almost didn&#039;t feel anything and literally fell asleep. The reason why I did that was to see if I was allergic to it or anything. Now I know I&#039;m not I want to take a normal/strong dose. I&#039;m not being foolish for trying this weekend, no? Also, two days ago took a very small amount of 2C-B. Another tiny amount. I&#039;m just trying to be careful to make sure I&#039;m not allergic to anything. And so far I&#039;m not allergic to anything so far. My friends tell me I need 300MG of MDMA to get a good high. I&#039;m 6foot 4 inches tall and over 300lbs. Football player type. Just a big person. What would the experts say to 300MG for my size? Thanks.<br /><br />

				I would start with 200mg, you can always take more but you can never take any back after you&#039;ve already taken it. Especially as I&#039;m assuming you have no experience rolling 300mg is a large dose. Have fun, be safe, spread the love 8)<br /><br />-Z<br /><br />

				1.5 to 2 mg per kg of body weight.&nbsp; You weigh 300 lbs or 136 kg.&nbsp; So a good dose for you is in the range of 200 to 275 mg.&nbsp; Try something in that range, and then go from there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Check out Erowid for more info.&nbsp; Have fun.
