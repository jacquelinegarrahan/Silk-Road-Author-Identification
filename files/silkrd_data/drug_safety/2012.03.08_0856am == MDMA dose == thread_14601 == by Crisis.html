			<dd class="postbody">
				I have a gram of MDMA crystals coming in and I was wondering what you guys thought about doses. I&#039;ve tried 120mg from a different vendor before and while I have no doubt it was the real thing,&nbsp; I certainly didn&#039;t roll.<br /><br />Would 150-180mg be too much? I don&#039;t want to over do it but I want that MDMA bang that 120mg just didn&#039;t have and no redosing would bring on.

				Hi,<br />Most of time 120 mg of real MDMA is enough to roll. Of course it depends a lot of conditions (administration route ? empty stomach ? Did you roll less than a month ago ? medical prescriptions ?) and everybody have different sensitivity with the product. Of course you can safely try 150mg, personally my limit is near 180 / 200mg, I prefer 120mg and a 60mg boost than 180mg in a single parachute because I love smooth come up but really depends what you are looking for. You have to find your sweet point with this substance, taking more won&#039;t necessarily give you a better roll.<br />I think I never met anybody who took 150-200mg of real MDMA and didn&#039;t roll hard ! <br /><br />WL<br />

				Thanks for the advice. I&#039;m not very familiar with MDMA crystal but you&#039;d think that it would be more pure than pills. I probably had a cross-tolerance with other meds but I can&#039;t remember for sure. I&#039;m letting my system clean out for a few weeks before rolling and I might up my dose to 150mg.<br /><br />By the way, White Light, is your name from the Rudy Rucker book?

				This is a very common misconception. Just because its a powder doesn&#039;t really mean its more pure. The chemist could get a poor recovery upon synthesis and also it being a white powder makes it really easy to cut. <br /><br />Anyways a good question is also how much you ate before you dropped. If you had a big meal and then dropped molly your body is going to metabolize it slowly and probably unevenly resulting in not getting enough at one time to really roll. <br /><br />Upping the dose to 150 is fine that&#039;s not considered a dangerous amount at all. You&#039;ll be safe on that.

I normally dose on an empty stomach but it was a few months back so I can&#039;t say for certain.<br /><br />As far as purity goes, it was in crystal form, not powder, but I&#039;m sure the same idea applies. I&#039;ve only taken pills and they were very strong when they first hit; real bang zoom, so I&#039;d thought (mistakingly) that crystals must be more pure. Now I know better.<br /><br />I was also curious about how crucial&nbsp; was the source of manufacture. The batch I was talking about in my OP was sourced from the UK while this batch I have coming in is from NL via Germany.<br /><br />But thanks for clueing me in on the dose. I feel confident that I&#039;ll be able to dose between 150-180mg without flipping out and dying. And as Zubic09 pointed out, rolling face is indeed the best case scenario. In fact, that&#039;s what it&#039;s all about. Anything less is a disappointment.

				DanceSafe&#039;s reagents have had a fair amount of problems with me (ie, they sent me the wrong stuff the first time and they shorted me the second time), but I&#039;m not sure where else you can get them. I know that Amazon has some NIK drug testing kits, but they don&#039;t work in quite the same way as the DanceSafe kits.
