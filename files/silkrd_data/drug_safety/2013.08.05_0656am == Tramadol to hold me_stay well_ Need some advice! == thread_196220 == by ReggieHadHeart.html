				Before I start, I&#039;ll warn you that this is a bit long...but I&#039;d REALLY appreciate&nbsp; if someone who has some &quot;time under their belt&quot; in the dope game would weigh in on this.&nbsp; I&#039;m really torn over whether or not I should spring for the tramadol. <br /><br />So, I&#039;ve got a non-using friend coming to visit on tuesday, and he is staying until the following friday-10 days.<br />I&#039;m currently addicted to heroin, and I use a fair amount. I am going to have to hide my use from him, and it really only be feasible to shoot up twice a day tops.<br /><br />In the past, when I was also addicted but happened to be taking a break with suboxone, I was able to take tramadol and although I did not get high, it eliminated withdrawals.&nbsp; My dope tolerance/habit has gone up since then, but not a tremendous amount.<br /><br />Basically, about a year ago, I came across a 50 count bottle of 50mg tramadol.&nbsp; At the time, I was taking 2-3mg of suboxone a day. (I always take low dose sub-it keeps w.d. at bay, and if I take any more than that, I get terrible headaches.<br /><br />At first, I was taking the two together.&nbsp; I felt a slight uplift in emotion, but definitely no euphoria.<br />I then decided to stop my sub and see how the tram held me.&nbsp; The first few days, I didn&#039;t think much of not missing the sub, because I figured it was still lingering on my receptors.&nbsp; However, the 4th thru 7th day, I felt even better. I&#039;m pretty sure the sub was out of my system by then, or if there was any left, it wasn&#039;t enough to calm my w.d. <br /><br />For &quot;control&quot; purposes, I&#039;ve stopped taking my sub and all other opiates before,&nbsp; when I tried to &quot;cold turkey&quot; off 1mg of sub after having been on it for 6 months.&nbsp; By day 4 I definitely was feeling off, and the morning of the 5th day I woke up to soaking wet sheets and very tense muscles.&nbsp; I made it about 5 miserable, anxious hours that day before I broke and took a mg of sub-and all my symptoms vanished.<br /><br />So, here is my question: would/should/could the tramadol work as well (or at all) easing the much more rapidly enveloping dope withdrawals?&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on stopping dope completely, just cutting back so that whatever I get will satiate me.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />To give you an idea of my tolerance:<br />I&#039;m currently using about .8g(800mg) of mediocre black tar a day (it&#039;s all that&#039;s available to me around here) in about 3 shots-pick it up around 2pm, do .3 shot at 2:30, .2 shot at bedtime (~1am) and .3shot upon waking (~8am). I also received a g from dragon cove on friday morning and that lasted me about 60 hours total. I was able to feel pretty good of a .15 shot from him. <br /><br />I plan on picking up 5 grams before he arrives, as that&#039;s about all I can afford. That means I&#039;d have to cut back to .5g a day while he is here-and that&#039;s where the tramadol comes in.&nbsp; I would prob take 100mg 3 times a day-morning, lunch, and dinner.&nbsp; &nbsp;This leaves me 100mg to take PRN if I&#039;m feeling especially shitty.<br /><br />I&#039;m also receiving a G from GIA tomorrow, and I&#039;m going to try and make that last as long as possible before starting in on the tar.<br /><br />In case anyone is going to suggest this:&nbsp; I can&#039;t just &quot;hop back on suboxone&quot; because EVERY TIME I switch from dope to sub I feel like absolute dog shit both physically and mentally for about 2 weeks, and I really don&#039;t want to be terrible company while my friend is here. <br /><br />Oh yea-I know about the seizure threshold of t-dol. <br /><br />Do you think I should give this a shot? Why/why not. If you vote no, what would you do to stretch out your supply?

				Tramadol is free for sale in the Netherlands.<br />But to play it safe I recommand&nbsp; http://www.dokteronline.com/<br />You have to pay the dokter â‚¬12,50 and tell your symptoms and ask just for the tramadol.<br />In case of a investigation, you have the official papers, signed by a official doctor.<br />They use to sell benzo&#039;sand all, but do not anymore.<br /><br />Tramadol is free in the Netherlands. The site is from Curacau, cause Pharmacists may not sell over the internet, but Curacau has a other law.<br />The medicine come from Rotterdam. No judge can order to give the names to who the medicine are sold. Their the hole in the law.<br />There is no law where Tramadol is mentioned, even if it is a opiate.<br />In the ad is a brand I don&#039;t know, but he has &quot;&quot;Zydol&quot;&quot; too, just ask.<br /><br />The site is legit but doesn&#039;t sell the stronger stuff anymore.<br />So nothing for me there.<br /><br />I have some tramadol too. Ultram. If they were Zydol or tramadil, they were gone a long time ago.<br />I can send some for free. I get a unpleasant buzz from those tabs, Zydol are the best.<br />You need half the heroin and be twice as stoned.<br /><br />I have some tabs of Methadone too.<br />Pict with a word of your choice + date on request.<br />For 7 or 8 days I can help.<br /><br />The problem here is that we have to use snailmail and I live In the Netherlands, and your from the States I guess.<br /><br />If you are interested , let me know and send pgpkey

				I suppose the availability of tramadol is not the problem here - its available in many countries and relatively inexpensive too... perhaps you&#039;d pay $1 each for 100 mg tablets, possibly less. Plenty of vendors on SR or otherwise. <br /><br />The question seems to be whether it can be useful in hiding a heroin habit for a week and a half. <br /><br />Using suboxone seems to be essential here though, taking just tramadol will not reduce the symptoms of acute opiate withdrawal to an acceptable/presentable level over the course of a week. <br /><br />I suppose this is not a problem though, as long as it prevents you from having to shoot up. Ingesting some suboxone and tramadol can be done quite discretely in a bathroom, or even publicly explaining it is for allergies or something like that if anyone asks. Most people have no idea what the pills look like, and will not &#039;spot&#039; a tablet of suboxone or capsule or tramadol unless they have been using them themselves.&nbsp;

				Maybe I wasn&#039;t clear?<br /><br />I plan on using dope while he is here, just not as much.<br />Also, I can get the trams no problem-thanks for your offer-but I&#039;ll be fine on my own.<br /><br />I usually shoot .8-1.2g a day, and I want to go down to .5, using the tramadol to stretch out my dope. Feasible?

				Maybe I wasn&#039;t clear either when I wrote;&quot;&quot; Zydol are the best.<br />You need half the heroin and be twice as stoned.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Promethazine does the same. You will need less Heroin. Free for sale in the Netherlands also.<br /><br />Benzo&#039;s help a lttle too, but if you can do with half your normal daily portion , I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Tramadol is a opiate, and zydol wont let you down.<br /><br />Metadone is like a medicine for a horse.<br /><br />Shooting up 0.8 gram each day is a lot, so you will need about 80 mg to feel O.K. (2 times 40 mg methadone is better)<br /><br />If you continue using but less, you can do with 20 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the evening.<br /><br />As little as 5 mg can give cross-tolerances. The meth prevents the H to reach the receptor and H does the same. Meaning the meth can&#039;t do it&#039;s job because the H is in the way to reach the receptor
