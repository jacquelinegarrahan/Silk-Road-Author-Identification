				I dunno if where this thread should go but if it is in the wrong place I am sorry.<br /><br /><br />I am wondering if anyone can tell me the difference between 25C NBOMe and 25i NBOMe?

				I&#039;ve tried 25c and I&#039;d say its pretty similar to acid. Nice body high, some euphoria(although not as good as LSD in my opinion), and some minor visuals. Although I had a dose of about only ~325ug, and I&#039;ve heard the experience gets a lot more visual as the dose gets higher.<br /><br />With NBOMes you gotta watch the dose carefully though, you don&#039;t wanna OD on this stuff.

				Also, BTW, l1llykins has posted a lot on this subject.&nbsp; You will probably find her posts answer your question pretty directly:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30847.msg361047#msg361047<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=33175.msg380079#msg380079<br /><br />

				What I&#039;ve read &quot;25b is a unique sensory experience. 25c is more responsive to music. 25d is very responsive to touch. 25i makes you happy and giggly. However, reports of 25i sleepy for days.&quot;<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth. Really interested in this experience as well.

				I recommend l1llykins&#039;s descriptions. She&#039;s quite good with the words.<br /><br />For myself, I find B to be very visual and sexually sensitive. It can be a little debilitating and consistently makes me and my friends enjoy the sensation of coldness (ice).<br /><br />D is a beautiful primarily intellectual experience for me. My ability to articulate and think of concepts, in addition to the way I sense reality, becomes significantly more specific, and distinct.<br /><br />I was one of the most unique psychedelics I feel I&#039;ve done.

				25B is definitely the most visual psychedelic I&#039;ve tried to date, at least in terms of OEV&#039;s. I love the extra splashes of color it infuses into everything ... I wasn&#039;t able to concentrate on sex too much though, the mind load was pretty heavy and I kept getting distracted. I&#039;ll have to remember to play with ice next time :).

				Damn I really want to get some 25b. Tried 25i, 25c, and 25d so far. Not a big fan of C. I just feel like I am in a whirlpool I am so lost. Hoping to order some 25b, and 25g later next week

				I beleive foxy is almost ready. Was said to be ready by the end of August and recent posts in Foxys thread i think it will be here soon. Doesnt sound like the most promising chemical though.... I am more interested in 25i-nboh to be honest
