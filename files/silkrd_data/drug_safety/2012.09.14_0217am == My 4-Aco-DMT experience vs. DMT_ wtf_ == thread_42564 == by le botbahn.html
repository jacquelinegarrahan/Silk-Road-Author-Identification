				So I tried.4 Aco.DMT last night for.the first time. I&#039;ve researched the stuff quite and the consensus appears to be that it&#039;s slighty different but essentially a cleaner mushroom experience.<br /><br />So I took 20 mg last night. Worst trip ever. Not a one aspect of it had any similarities to any of my shroom trips (good or bad), ever. Just one long 3.5-4hr menevolent mind fuck and ego gang raping. Never again.<br /><br />It did, however, feel very much like some supposed DMT Changa I received from a vendor earlier this year. The only difference between&nbsp;these two experiences is that&nbsp;changa only lasted 1-1.5 hrs.<br /><br />Both experiences have really put me off to both compounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;I wonder if the changa was fake and had been infused with 4-aco-dmt?<br /><br />And if the 4-aco-dmt that I tried last night is legit (and I believe it is ),&nbsp; I can&#039;t be alone in feeling that this is in no way, shape, or form similar to psilocybin mushrooms...right?<br /><br />&nbsp;Any thoughts?

				the key is similar, not exactly the same. I find them 4-aco to be quite similar to shrooms with the auditory hallucinations and owtward growing focus, but it makes my legs shake (which shrooms don&#039;t) and it feels a bit tighter in my head. If you want exactly shrooms, then pick up some shrooms. <br /><br /><br />now to the other point, DMT lasted an hour and a half.....? are you serious? I get 20 minutes from take off to landing, and it is in absolutely NO way similar to 4-aco. 4-aco is like taking a flight on a 747, comes up pretty quick, you stay high for a while, then you come down and aren&#039;t quite sure what time it is.<br /><br />DMT is like riding a mini rocket ship. OUTER SPACE RIGHT FUCKING NOW Mr spock, then teleport back to earth once the fuel runs out.

				Shrooms can give bad trips too you know...<br /><br />I&#039;m sure tons of people have had wonderful eye opening trips on 4-aco-dmt just like 4oh-dmt (psilocin).<br /><br />Some people who seem to know what they&#039;re talking about theorize that 4-aco-dmt is turned into 4oh-dmt in the body anyways. So theoretically it should be the same thing.<br /><br />Are you experienced with shrooms? If you&#039;ve done them many times you should know that all trips are different and sometimes you have the most beautiful experience and sometimes you have the raping that you experienced.<br /><br />I personally find the two to be indistinguishable except that 4aco has no nausea.

				Did any of pompous dicks even read my post? <br /><br /><br />Yes, I&#039;ve done shrooms, many, many times. Good trips, bad trips. Good or bad, it&#039;s always a distinct experience and it&#039;s distinguishible from other tryptamines.<br /><br />Sorry if my experience doesn&#039;t jive with your experience or marketing. I haven&#039;t tried yours. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s vastly superior. <br /><br />Also I stated Changa. Not DMT freebase. Changa sure as shit lasts 60-90 min. If a slimy vendor put 4-aco in place of DMT in a changa blend, it seems reasonable that it would be shorter acting than oral 4-aco, and fit the 60-90 min timeframe as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Are you trolling?<br /><br />Changa should last 20 minutes tops. Sounds like there&#039;s something weird going on with your changa. I doubt it&#039;s 4aco though, since it&#039;s more expensive than just extracting real DMT.<br /><br />Also I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re calling us pompous dicks and asserting that we didn&#039;t read your post.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Still, the science would indicate that 4aco trip should be identical to a 4oh trip, minus whatever effect nausea has on a 4oh trip.<br />

I&#039;ve only done 4-aco a few times at some parties with my friends who like novel substances, and it&#039;s definitely compared to the shroom trips I&#039;ve had. With the notable loss of nausea, too. I also think the come-up is a lot less scary than shrooms ( shrooms have always made me feel gross and nauseous and paranoid in the first hour or so after I take them ) <br /><br />I mean, 20 to me sounds like a lot simply because when I took mine I did anywhere from 10 - 15 and that was pretty strong to me. Although I&#039;m pretty small and altogether more sensitive to psychedelics in general, so that could be it.

				I&#039;ve had 4-aco once and it was extremely similar to a shroom trip, had a great time on 20mg. Would like to eat a few grams of shrooms and take a dose of 4-aco and see how it goes. Sounds like your drugs were weird, or whoever gave them to you used an inaccurate scale and you got a bigger dose than expected? Very possible, albeit unlikely if you got it from SR..
