				I figure this is the best place to have a little discussion on this drug. I was unaware that this drug existed until about an hour ago when I saw a short youtube documentary on it. The video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToQ8PWYnu04 . For those of you who have no idea what this drug is, it&#039;s pretty much a mind control drug. It&#039;s been used in Colombia for centuries, but in this day and age it really only has criminal allure to it. When the person ingests this drug, all their willpower goes away and they can be persuaded into literally anything. Someone can slip the drug to someone else without them knowing, and then the drugged person is set on a hallucinogenic trip where they will do whatever another party asks of them. I was wondering if anyone on Silk Road has any experience with this drug. It&#039;s considered the most dangerous drug on the planet, but the thought of slipping some to a bank teller, going up to them and asking them for all of the banks money and receiving it without question or hesitation does seem kind of alluring.

				lol<br /><br />that is not really an accurate statement of anti-cholinergic effects. they induce a hallucinogenic delirium. as in you cannot distinguish between reality and fantasy. possibly you might be able to convince someone to do something but generally they are dissociative and extremely frightening. as in you see ten foot spiders but cannot understand they are not real. good luck getting anyone overdosed on an anti-cholinergic to do anything but freak out and be completely unresponsive. <br /><br />do some actual research about the class of chem besides a you tube video... i mean really??? you base your understanding of something on a freaking youtube video? they are hardly the most dangerous drugs, but can definitely cause problems just like any drug of which too much is taken. these compounds including atropine, dicyclomine, hyoscamine all have legitimate medical uses and do not induce &quot;mind-control.&quot; i know you have heard about benedryl... diphenhydramine is an anti-histamine with potent anti-cholinergic effects and too much of it can induce a anti-cholinergic overdose state very similar to scopolamine. i have hundreds of dicyclomine tablets too, theyre only good for double vision, dry mouth, overheating, and becoming very sleepy. not mind control <br /><br />have you heard about flunitrazepam??? its mind control&nbsp; too. they make you instantly sexy to any woman. <br />you can sleep with them and they wont stop you or protest or even remember. which means they like you obviously

I had literally just watched a video, done a search on SR and noticed that it wasnt available and was just wondering about experiences from SR members. Pretty interesting to hear that the anti-cholingeric effects aren&#039;t exactly what I thought they&#039;d be, and yes, I suppose I put too much faith into the eye witness testimony of the video I posted. I&#039;m not even interested in acquiring such a compound, because I feel like it would just bring the criminal out in me. I hadn&#039;t heard of flunitrazepam either, but it sounds like quite the wild benzo. <br /><br />If my statements about what scopolamine do to a person are not accurate, then why is it so popular in colombia for being a mind control agent? There are many people who have fallen &quot;victim&quot; to being dosed with scopolamine and don&#039;t remember anything they did, and still gave away their posessions only to wake up completely unaware of their actions in a park the next morning. Why is that?

				Also, microRNA, I appreciate your response, but I&#039;d appreciate it more if you didn&#039;t try to make me sound like an idiot. I was curious and have no history with anything similar to substances like scopolamine, so belittling me saying I need to do more research is a little rude considering I came on this forum to ask questions about something unknown to me. You sound like you know your stuff though, so thanks for the info, regardless.
