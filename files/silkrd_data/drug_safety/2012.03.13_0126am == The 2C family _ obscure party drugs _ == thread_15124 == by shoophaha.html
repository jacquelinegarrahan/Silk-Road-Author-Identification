				Title: <strong>The 2C family / obscure party drugs ?</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>shoophaha</strong> on <strong>March 13, 2012, 01:26 am</strong>

				Hello everyone! <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in exploring the 2C family of drugs and was wondering which one(s) you&#039;d recommend, and at what dosage. I&#039;ve done shrooms a few times and acid once, so I have some familiarity with psychedelics. Would you recommend doing any of them alone?<br /><br />I also generally smoke tons of weed and go to parties, but I don&#039;t find this very interesting. I would just do MDMA at every party but obviously that is a terrible idea because it would ruin MDMA for me very quickly. I am also too poor to do cocaine. I was wondering what sort of fun party drugs you all enjoy. Ketamine (might be too dissociative)? Opiates? I would like to stay away from heroin/crack/meth/PCP.<br /><br />Would 2C drugs be suitable for parties or are they too psychedelic? I would like to be functional, able to walk, and able to interact with drunk people. I realize I wouldn&#039;t be able to do those every weekend but it&#039;d be nice for a change of pace. <br /><br />Thank you!

				I just got some 2C-B in the mail, I&#039;ll let you know how it goes since this is my first time on 2C-B. Go to Erowid and look up all the different LSD types, I love that place. <br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/<br /><br />

				2c-i is fine for functioning on, at lower dosages, like 10mg.<br />I&#039;ve done that before. Just make sure that anyone your hanging out with is ok with you tripping and that you&#039;r on with them knowing, BECAUSE THEY WILL.

				2C-B was a classic replacement for MDMA when MDMA was illegal but 2C-B was not.<br /><br />I personally like 4-FA which is a empathogenic stimulant. I find that it&#039;s a nice compromise between amphetamine (for me, Adderall) and MDMA.<br /><br />Look into RC stims and experiment.

				Ahhh, it was a replacement for MDMA? That&#039;s just the sort of thing I want to hear.<br /><br />Are designer drugs safe though? I know 2C is okay via Pikhal research and stuff but so many of these weird chemicals have only been synthesized/used recently. I feel like it&#039;d be best to stick with stuff that is more widely used.

				I&#039;m relatively new to hard drugs (shrooms a few times last year, MDMA twice, acid once) so I&#039;d like to be more cautious before I start using lesser-known stuff. I&#039;m not TOTALLY ruling it out, but I&#039;d like to work my way up to them. For now, other people can explore them!

I suggest starting off with 2ci as it&#039;s the easiest to handle (in my opinion) and then moving on to 2cb. I also suggest buying/taking multivitamins to help reduce any negative effects on your health (very minimal if you space out your trips).

None of them are addictive. But I see your perspective and if it makes you comfortable, then approach that way. The most important thing is being comfortable with your approach, because being scared or anxious will ruin your experiences. 2C-B should definitely be your first stop, then.

				Well, I think most non-drug users&#039; definition of hard drugs is anything that isn&#039;t weed or alcohol, so that&#039;s what I&#039;m going by. I think those three that I&#039;ve done are perfectly safe and I don&#039;t mean anything negative by calling them hard drugs. I&#039;ve heard that either 2C-I or 2C-B are good first tries, so I might go with the latter since it has the history of being switched for MDMA. Multivitamins are a good call.

				I love learning about the kinds of drugs that were used to replace mdma back in the day. I mean, I love mdma, I&#039;m just so drained the next day that I don&#039;t want to do it too often. Of course it doesn&#039;t hurt that the 2c&#039;s require small doses relative to mdma and that the body load is known to be less. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be trying a low dose of 2cb this weekend, will let you know how it goes!

It just doesn&#039;t have a comedown or any sort of long term serotonin draining effect. I would suggest you go for some 2c-b.

				2c-e is a great party drug. my doses were usually 15-25mg. It gets really old, really fast, if you use it regularly though. I&#039;ve never experienced an increase in tolerance, just a boredom of the overall effects, &quot;been there, done that,&quot; type of feeling. i dont get like that with most other drugs. every 2c-e trip is pretty much the same while every lsd experience is always different. thats how i felt...

I&#039;d say it&#039;s a safe bet, but I haven&#039;t had the pleasure of trying it yet so I can&#039;t give you any personal opinions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />rat studies with 4-FA revealed seratonin depletion to be temporary.&nbsp; i use 4-FA weekly or bi-weekly and there is definately an &quot;annoyed&quot; phase a few days afterwards.&nbsp; but otherwise it&#039;s very gentle speed, right between mdma and amphetamine.&nbsp; and is an AWESOME sexual enhancement drug.<br />i think 4-FA has been common for almost a decade now and i haven&#039;t heard any trainwreck reports from anyone.&nbsp; it&#039;s self-limiting, my body won&#039;t let me take it without a huge gap pf time between sessions.<br />4-MEC is another good RC with similiarity to MDMA.&nbsp; it&#039;s short and sweet, oral dose lasts only about 2 hrs.&nbsp; the euphoria is very MDMA-like, but it lacks some of the loving the world aspects.&nbsp; snorting it is veeery bad, for the euphoria is insanely intense but lasts only about 5 minutes, which turns into a binge quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br />*destiny*<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I found the serotonin depletion of 4-FA to be about half of that of MDMA at similar doses. I took 100mg of 5-HTP the morning after and perked right back up in about 6 hours.<br /><br />Now, I would NOT recommend taking 4-FA instead of MDMA if you are going to do the MDMA -&gt; 2C-B combination. 4-FA is a lot like rolling at 100mg, but it&#039;s just not the same. I had a very lonely comedown on the 2C-B :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I just generally watch Adult Swim for a few hours because nothing makes me happier than coming back from the club and watching Adult Swin coming off 2c-b. I have never taken a drug with such a giddy comedown. You are just like TIM AND ERIC IS AWESSSSSOME. <br /><br />However, all you need is a Thresh hold dose of Etilozam or Xanax (a quarter pill/.25 mg, I actually prefer Etilozam over Xanax for comedowns since it has less euphoria) when you do want to go to sleep. You will be out in no time. After you have fully come off 2c-b you really don&#039;t feel psyically stimulated just mentally stimulated so you sleep fine after a tiny bit of Etilozam.
