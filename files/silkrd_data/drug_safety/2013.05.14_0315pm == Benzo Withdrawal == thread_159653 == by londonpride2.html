				Who&#039;s been through it then? Would be good to tell some stories given the amount of people with access to cheap benzos in large amounts. <br /><br />I started with Xanax in the evening most nights, soon became every night. Started smoking weed again which makes me paranoid so took even more Xanax (6mg a night ish). Ran out, didn&#039;t think much of it.<br /><br />Spend the next day screaming, crying and being too scared to even look out of the window. It was like the world fell apart over night. I was naive and stupid, I had no idea how bad it would be. <br /><br />So I switched to Valium and tapered over 2 months. Was really easy to do in the end, just needed to be done properly. If anyone wants any advice I am happy to help. There&#039;s also some good forums and support groups out there. DO NO ATTEMPT TO GO COLD TURKEY IT CAN KILL YOU.<br /><br />Anyone with similar stories please share if you are willing to, I dont think people realize how bad the withdrawal is.

				Horrible.&nbsp; Death is possible, even probable, depending on how much and how long you have been ingesting:<br /><br />I actually have a script for a long-acting benzo, and have sadly been on them for almost a half decade daily.&nbsp; I know how damaging they are, but they truly help my anxiety, so I live with the dependence.<br /><br />I once ran out during a winter storm.&nbsp; My heart started going through palpitations; I also became paranoid and easily angered.&nbsp; My body felt as though it aged 20-30 years; it was very hard to maintain muscle stength.&nbsp; I could not sleep at all. I&#039;d sleep for about 10 minutes before a &quot;zap&quot; or tremor would wake me up (this is a sign that a seizure may ensure from reading).&nbsp; &nbsp;I called an emergency hotline to get possibly helicopter-vacced if I could not endure the night, but the snow was coming down far too much and impeded visibility. They kept me calm.<br /><br />Two days into it, I could not sleep at all. The snow had stopped, so had a friend drive me to pick up my script. At this point, I was twitching quite considerably.&nbsp; I took the tablet as soon as I got it, and everything subsided within about 10 minutes.&nbsp; If it had been about 3-4 days longer, according to the pharmacist, I could&#039;ve had a seizure and/or brain damage.<br /><br /><br />These drugs are no joke; if you can&#039;t get a steady supply, please don&#039;t get addicted to them.

				Also, from my reading/scant biochemical knowledge:<br /><br />These drugs are so potent in withdrawl because they act, not only on GABA, but on other systems, including serotonin, dopamine, etc.&nbsp; For those that have never embattled benzo withdrawl, it is pretty much like combining withdrawls from an antidepressant (serotonin brain zaps), coke (dopamine paranoia), and alcohol (GABA) to put it in perspective.&nbsp; Unlike other withdrawls in which the individual can suffer but not die, death may occur, or at least a seizure, which you may or may not be fully functional after.

This is why I think doctors hand them out way too easily. The addiction potential is very high. Even among drug users who use them for coming down off&nbsp; MDMA / speed / meth / coke it can be very addictive because of the way they work and make all anxiety diminish and relax you. People start using them when they relax, then they can&#039;t rlax without it. All of a sudden there is a problem.

Either way, if you keep doing them at a bare mimumum for come-downs and the like, I see no problem.&nbsp; But I wouldn&#039;t habituate it at all if I didn&#039;t have a disorder that required me to do so.<br />

They should certainly be used alongside counseling of some kind.

I only take it when I really need it, due to its addiction potential. Anxiety is really an awful thing. A panic attack is hell. A lot of people just think anxiety is some stupid made up thing where people get worried for no reason. But it&#039;s not. Anyone who has anxiety knows how bad it is. I only have it quite mildly, so I can&#039;t even imagine how awful it would be to have severe anxiety.<br /><br />I agree. Focusing on breathing is very important and helps relieve anxiety. I also find exercise helps. It allows you to concentrate on using your muscles and energy and clears your head.<br />I&#039;ve never tried meditation, but you say it works? I will have to try that - Thanks for the info. My problem is that I am very busy and I enjoy being busy. I get bored easily and always seem to have to be achieving something. I&#039;ve always been like this - Ever since I was a child. I tend to overthink everything. I am always thinking of potential outcomes. I have outcomes planned in my head.<br /><br />For example, being a vendor on Silk Road, which I thoroughly enjoy. It makes me feel good because I am supplying a product to other people. A product which they choose to use and is proven to not be that harmful. But at the same time, I think about outcomes. Getting caught. I have thought over every possible outcome and I reiterate it to myself all the time. I am constantly aware that being a vendor on SR is a risk. I cover myself very well, but I still constantly think of possible ways in which I might encounter a problem.

				WD from benzos can be super fucking nasty.<br /><br />Between benzos and opiates, im not sure what has a worse WD. Obviously opiate WD, is more painful, but man, i kicked a 10mg-20mg xanax habit many years ago, and i had 2 seizures.

I just enjoy taking things like alprazolam over temazepam so i recall what happened the night before, at least vaguely compared to a total blank memory :D
