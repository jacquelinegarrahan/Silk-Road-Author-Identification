				Whatever I got sent, was garbage, they used to have good quality stuff but they just sent me some shit that smelled like parmesan cheese, flakey not the usual clumpy PV, did 250mg with barely any effects, friends agreed this stuff is either cut, or really weak, don&#039;t waste your time, I see their vendor account is gone which is good, horrible vendors, in the past, they sent me a random order out of nowhere and it got confiscated, leading to me receiving a letter from a checkpoint due to their poor stealth. If they were organized and didn&#039;t save my address to send random fucking packages I never ordered, that would have never happened. Also half of the time, the wrong item would be sent, and they can never keep up with successfully sending out a reship. I will say, I&#039;ve had great methylone like last year from these vendors, but they are so fucking unorganized it&#039;s ridiculous. A bag in between two pieces of paper is NOT stealth, and all the dumbasses leaving feedback saying &quot;good stealth&quot; don&#039;t know what vacuum seal is apparently. The price is cheap, but not worth the bullshit product and possible other problems along the way. There was a time when they had super strong MDPV, apparently this is the same kind as last, all coming from &quot;Netherland Labs&quot;, well it fucking sucks. Stop tweaking out so much and get your fucking shit together.

				250mg? Dude your asking for a heart attack. 10mg should be all you need as a starting dose. This is strong shit. Try vaporizing it if snorting or oral did not work, some varieties are synthed specifically for vaping. Though they should still work orally or nasally ...

				No, I&#039;m very experienced with PV, I know the dosage is in the 5-10mg range, their shit was just SO WEAK that I barely felt anything up to 250mg.

				MDPV is always garbage, regardless of the source.<br />There&#039;s so little clinical information on the substance, and all the anecdotal evidence shows that it&#039;s capable of doing some pretty nasty stuff too your body.<br />I&#039;d take being a meth addict over a MDPV or mephedrone addict any day.<br />Pony up the extra cash for a safer stim, or better yet, avoid stims completely. It&#039;s just not worth it.
