				hello,<br /><br />aside from the risks associated with IV drug use, how safe is injecting the Dillies P4 yellows as compared to say a roxi or some junk?&nbsp; Don&#039;t they have less ingredients than most pills and since they are so small? <br />this cat says there&#039;s no need to filter with cotton...he just crushes the pills dumps it in the dart and shake n bake warm water, no heat.&nbsp; And says that using cotton balls are a waste of Ds because you don&#039;t get the full effect... which doesn&#039;t make any sense because the hydromorph is water soluble which can pass through the cotton.&nbsp; I know this is true with the K4s they dissolve instantly but im not sure about the P4s... <br />I tried it his&nbsp; his method and dissolved and it did seem a tad bit stronger but never again because there&#039;s obviously particulate matter that&#039;s left behind from the wash so apparently those binders or fillers don&#039;t dissolve too well. <br />&nbsp;What do you guys think as far as using cotton vs no cotton? Micron filters are the best but can&#039;t get access to them. I think they dissolve really well I just wouldn&#039;t think you&#039;re losing that much w/ cotton<br /><br /><br />thanks<br /><br />

				I regularly shoot pills of all kinds and the method your friend has is not safe at all. I myself have had to have surgery on my wrist from a bad shot that got severely infected. You need to crush those yellow dillies into a powder, put your water onto them in a sterile spoon (100ml or 1cc per pill). Add some very mild heat with a lighter don&#039;t let it boil or get close just some heat to speed up the opiates mix with the water. Add a cotton and filter. Using a micron filter with pills is the best way to ensure no particles get into your blood. I have used this method countless times and I still have all my limbs and am healthy.<br /><br />Shooting pills however carries a huge risk and you shoud always consider the rsk of shooting particulate matter into your veins.<br /><br />Stay safe mate, p.s. dilaudid IV makes me hallucinate when I start to nod off.

				Injecting pills without using a filter is extremely risky. At the very minimum, use a cotton filter. You really, really should see about getting some syringe wheel (.2 microns) filters if you&#039;re planning on injecting pills. You can order them on Amazon
