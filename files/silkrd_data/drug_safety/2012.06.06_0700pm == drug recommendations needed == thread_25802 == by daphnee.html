				I figure where better to ask for drug recommendations than here, right?<br /><br />Here&#039;s the situation: I&#039;m a late 30-something executive in the corporate world. Normal life, house, dog, husband, kids. All the usual bullshit. My life is good. I am not escaping reality, but I have slight anxiety problems and trouble relaxing. Like any good ol&#039; American I&#039;m a fat lazy slob that works too hard and wants to dumb down her brain on the weekends.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t I just snag a 6-pack like everyone else, right? I&#039;ve done my share of drinking alcohol, but I just can&#039;t do it anymore. Makes me feel like shit, and aggravates my allergies and constant sinus problems. Not to mention the calories and metabolic effects. I&#039;m looking for something else.<br /><br />Requirements:<br />* Won&#039;t put me out of commission too badly for more than, say .. 8 hours. No weekend benders for me.<br />* Not interested in hallucinogens.<br />* Bonus points for pills. I&#039;m not mixing up any mayan herbal shaman concoctions in my kitchen and shit.<br />* I can&#039;t be noticeably fucked up. I have to be able to function in the real world, or at least be fucked up in ways that resemble the effects of alcohol. I gotta conform to social norms, yo.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve tried, what I liked, and what I didn&#039;t like:<br /><br />* Alcohol: the buzz I get after 2-3 beers after not drinking for a while is about perfect for me. I relax, my brain engages. Once upon a time I&#039;d sit in the bathtub plowing through a bottle of armagnac and reading fuckin karl marx and shit. I can drink like a champ -- a 12pack was nothing. Not anymore, though -- the health ramifications are too much. My liver says no more, and it&#039;s just not fun.<br />* Marijuana: enjoyed this a fair amount in my requisite stoner years like any teenager. Stopped enjoying it in my 20s. I suspect it interacts badly with the antihistamines I take. These days it just gives me a cloudy headache and makes me intolerably drowsy. and not in a good way.<br />* Kava kava: I actually quite enjoy the resulting intoxication from this stuff, but it&#039;s like drinking dirt, and it makes me nauseated as hell. Pass.<br />* Xanax: hardly does anything for me. The anxiolytic effects are obviously there as I do relax a little bit, but it&#039;s barely imperceptible. If I take any more than 1mg I just get exhausted and pass out. Pass.<br />* Zolpidem/Ambien: this is an interesting one: the buzz that I get from ambien around 15-30 mins after I take it is awesome, but of course after an hour or two I pass the hell out (as intended). The reports of the effects of ambien (night terrors, sleep-walking, etc.) scare the shit out of me, but I&#039;ve never experienced anything even close, myself. If I could find something like ambien that didn&#039;t have the massively sedating effects, I&#039;d be quite pleased. I was hoping xanax would be this missing puzzle piece, but alas, not even close.<br />* Oxycodone: makes my head swim, and then I projectile vomit. Soooo.. yeah, that&#039;s not my thing.<br />* Hydrocodone: The only time I&#039;ve had this stuff was after some serious surgery, and it made me feel so good that I threw the bottle away. I need a stress-reliever, not a life-ruiner. I don&#039;t have an addiction-prone personality but this stuff scared me.<br /><br />So, any suggestions? Should I give any of the other benzos a try? I&#039;ve thought about giving clonazepam, or even basic valium a try. But based on my experiences with xanax, I&#039;m not impressed. It&#039;s obviously a useful anxiolytic and handy for a long planeride, but otherwise not fun.

				you could try codeine, but that could make you throw up like the oxycodone. However i find its quite a nice weak buzz in a reasonably small dosage ~100mg with not that many side effects (slight itching and drowsiness)<br />It&#039;s basically a weak version of hydrocodone<br /><br />Have you tried marijuana edibles? they may have a slightly different effect on you if you&#039;re used to smoking?<br /><br />How about GBL / GHB its said to be roughly similar to alcohol and people on it don&#039;t look anything worse than slightly drunk so that might be an option?<br /><br />GBL/GHB id say is probably your best bet as long as you stay with low dosages :)

				Sounds like MXE is exactly what you are looking for.<br /><br />-15-25mg feels very similar to having a few beers, same buzz and sociable feeling and slightly dumbed down happy brain<br />-not a hallucinogen, but rather a dissociative.&nbsp; simply avoid high doses though if you want to avoid trippy effects<br />-with low doses it is possible to act fairly normal in social situations (I&#039;ve taken around family / with friends at dinner)<br />-lasts around 6 hours taken orally<br />-no hangover (unless you take like 100mg, and even then I prefer to call the hangover an afterglow)<br />-no calories or metabolism issues<br />-cheap (~$25 for a gram, which is like 30 low doses)<br />-can measure and cap in a pill, no need to smoke or whatever<br /><br />It&#039;s a great drug for anxiety.&nbsp; After taking it I have a general sense of well being for a couple days.&nbsp; Careful of overuse though, as tolerance does build if taken multiple days in a row.<br /><br />Check out this thread.&nbsp; Note however that some people have crazy experiences: ego death, erratic behavior, out of body, etc.&nbsp; This only happens at high doses.&nbsp; Start with 15 mg and wait 2-3 hours.<br />Do not redose before that.&nbsp; You will have a strong urge to because it feels good but the effects take a while to come on.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4685

				^^^What he said^^^<br /><br />Plus, although its a dissociative, it can make you rather friendly and talkative at low doses. Not to mention, unlike most of the other&nbsp; &quot;downers/depressants/relaxants&quot; you mentioned, MXE doesn&#039;t make you sleepy. In fact, you tend to be slightly/comfortably wired due to it dopaminergenic activity, even though your relaxed (kind of like a couple of beers plus a tiny bump of coke).<br /><br />And, Since it is a legal/unscheduled RC, you don&#039;t have to worry about losing your job or going jail as much.

				It&#039;s a shame you aren&#039;t into hallucinogens because I find that they were really helpful in removing most of the anxiety from my life. I will give two thumbs up to MXE, though. Cherish your first time, it&#039;s the most fun

				Yea, an M-Hole is MXE&#039;s version of a K-Hole. its basically when you take so much that you get the hallucinogenic effects. Kinda feels like RoboTripping in a small closet with the lights out.

If you broke it up into a bunch of 15mg pills (of which 1-2 is enough to give you a good buzz for a few hours) you would have to take at least 4-5 in a short time period to have any mild visual distortions and you would need to take 6 or more AT ONCE to get anywhere near an M-hole.<br />Kind of reminds me of my DXM days as a youth. I would sip on whole a bottle of VICKS 44 Dry Cough all day to keep a good drunken buzz going without any hallucinations. But I had to actually chug the stuff in a small time frame to get any visuals.<br /><br />IMHO, 15-40 mg of MXE is one of the finest social lubricants around

				There&#039;s a reason why they called valium &quot;mother&#039;s little helper&quot;, and you fit the profile for it perfectly. You&#039;ll find that it has a much different signature than Xanax, whose effects I&#039;d describe as &#039;stoning&#039; rather than &#039;calming&#039;, and unlike Xanax, valium also has mild muscle relaxant effects that can feel like an soothing embrace. I keep a supply on hand for dental appointments, long airplane flights, and simply as a salve for shitty days at work (traditional prescription for which is alcohol, but like you, alcohol and I don&#039;t get along these days physically and weed never did much for me other than make me speedy yet vacant). I also regard valium as my &quot;reward&quot; during the comedown off LSD trips, which can more resemble a harrowing 10 hour psychoanalytic deconstruction as scripted by Roman Polanski and staged by David Cronenberg than anything &#039;fun&#039;.<br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend you and your husband try MDMA together. Keep dosages moderate and use infrequent, but it does work wonders for couples.

				Actually I&#039;m not a vendor. Me and the vendor DrG0nzo just have similar names. (I was unaware of him it at the time I made my buyer&#039;s account and I have long taken a liking to using &quot;Dr. Gonzo II&quot; as a pen name ever since the great Hunter S. Thompson died)<br /><br />But I did get a sample of DrG0nzo&#039;s MXE recently and it is the shit. not to mention he gave me half a gram instead of a quarter gram.<br /><br />I have sampled a lot of MXE from the clearnet and the only one that I found to be as good as DrG0nzos is Vis Research (you can find reviews of them here: http://thealteredstates.iftopic.com/t2568-vis-research-review-thread )<br /><br />Beware of the super cheap MXE on the clearnet as it is most likely a weird PCP analog that has been floating around from an industrial scale synth in china that got fucked up and they sent it out anyways.
