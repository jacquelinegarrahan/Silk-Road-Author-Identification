				Just a quick question I wanted to ask I guess, curious after reading about different #&#039;s of Heroin and some region specific differences (I think?)<br /><br />If not, why? and is there anything you can do to it to make it snortable?<br /><br />Thank you

				Ah thank you very much, it&#039;s just I read somewhere that you couldn&#039;t snort UK #3 Heroin so I wanted to ask here to be sure. Something about just becoming a congealed mess in your nose or something? But musn&#039;t be the case&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Cheers again

				The nasal mucosas are slightly acidic, for this you can snort #3 without problems (it will just take a little more to absorb it).

				You totally can, but just be aware that you can OD this way, especially combined with benzos, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Running it on foil is the nicest way to take 3 though.<br /><br />I went through a period of snorting gear, (I was an IV user for many years, then went back to smoking) because it does give you a bit of a iv&nbsp; like rush when it hits you, like that &#039;aaaah&#039; feeling down the back of your legs.

				Thanks guys, had the best buzz I&#039;ve had from H snorting #3 yesterday. I don&#039;t mind smoking, but my solo smoking technique leaves a lot to be desired and I don&#039;t usually get enough smoke, so it just feels quite wasteful? Best done in pairs at least I heard?<br /><br />I&#039;d give karma if I could, need to get to 100 posts first&nbsp; :)

The positive is that it&#039;s almost impossible to OD with smoking and the habit is somewhat easier to control (albeit there are many many people addicted to smoking H yet believing they have the habit &quot;in perfect control&quot;).

				Yeah I mean today I&#039;ve&nbsp; been doing a bit of a mix, mostly snorting though smoking every now an then too. I quite like the combination, smoking&#039;s a bit more involved and haven&#039;t been using too much. Just little pick&#039;me&#039;up&#039;s&nbsp; :)

				Could you also sniff #4? What&#039;s the difference , if any when snorting? I understand #4 is cleaned more and is better suited to injecting, therefore it&#039;ll cost more, but is there any difference in the hit?
