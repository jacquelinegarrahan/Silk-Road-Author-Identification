				Ok, so I&#039;ll start with what I usually use.<br />I&#039;m a somewhat sparing user or 2c-i, 2c-e and the occasional 2c-p.<br />&nbsp;I also rarely drink and sometimes smoke pot.<br />I avoid caffeine and take MDMA twice a year.<br />I may start trying nBOME chems soon.<br />(I&#039;ve also had 4-fa, speed and poppers before)<br /><br />I avoid dissociatives, opioids and stimulants (other than phenethylamines)<br />However I would like to try a dissociative, a diliriant and cocaine once.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering Diphenhydramine for the dilieriant, as it&#039;s safe, easy to get and I have been known to use it as a sleep aid.<br />I want to do this so that I may better understand the difference between hallucinations (like those produced by the psychedelics I like) and true delusions.<br /><br />I also want to try a dissacociatve once, again, to compare against a psychedelic.<br />I&#039;m considering either DXM or Ketamine.<br /><br />Also want to try coke ONCE.<br /><br /><br />So, here are my questions.<br />-Can anyone tell me what to expect from the substances? I want reports, and if possible comparisons to psychedelics.<br />-Are there any substances people would suggest as an alternative to Diphenhydramine, DXM or Ketamine?<br />-Are there any other drugs that people here have tried or would suggest I try once. I&#039;m looking for things that are different in effects or provide a unique life experience?

				I&#039;Ving Ketamine will give you one of the most intense dissociative trips ever. but its not for the feint of heart or inexperienced.<br /><br />but if your looking for a life changing experience; have you tried magic mushrooms or ayhuasca?

				diphenhydramine is terrible. i took large dose benadryl once and had the scariest 36+ hours of my life. i couldn&#039;t sleep all night because of frighteningly real hallucinations in my peripheral vision. i almost screamed multiple times because i was seeing animals and ghosts stare at me as i was trying to sleep. i was quite unsure as to whether i was asleep or awake the entire time. when i went to class the next morning, my eyes were visibly bloodshot and appeared to be stretched open. my peers thought i had some kind of psychotic break. in short, the people who took this drug and had good trip reports on erowid must have REALLY low standards.<br /><br />sawyer

				My experience with coke was underwhelming to say the least.&nbsp; RC stimulants blew it out of the water potency wise and the effects weren&#039;t all that unique or special.&nbsp; It was nice, but not the big-bad wolf people make it out to be.&nbsp; <br /><br />4-HO-MET was a nice 10-hour shroomlike trip with lots of colors and energy.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for something unique &amp; life-changing, you might look into DPT, 5-MeO-DMT, MDA or ayahuasca/DMT.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can&#039;t really speak on dissociatives or deliriants since both kind of terrify me.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not looking for a life changing experience, I&#039;m looking to try things that are unique or special in their own way. I just want some experience and to understand what certain types of drugs are like. This is why I want to try a dilieriant and a dissacocitive, so that I can understand the subjective effects those types of drugs offer.

The effects of antihistamines vary hugely between people. Some are knocked out from taking a single 25 mg dose of diphenhydramide, others are not even sleepy after 100 mg. There is some tolerance there obviously, but the effects on first time users are also highly variable. Antihistamines are commonly prescribed for things like&nbsp; motion sickness too, and not all people experience any drowsiness on the recommended dose.<br /><br />Taking high doses can result in odd effects though. I use cetirizine (zyrtec) as a treatment for insect bite allergy. Long before i ever knew about any effects beyond drowsiness i experienced visual hallucinations after taking about 50 mg of it, combined with a few glasses of wine.&nbsp; As i am allergic to mosquito bites and got bitten several times at that point in time i figured taking a bit (5 times) more then recommended wouldn&#039;t be much of&nbsp; a danger. By now i know better and choose drugs of choice more wisely if i do not want to experience such effects.<br /><br />Oddly, i have never experience any hallucinations when taking diphenhydramide, even at equivalent doses to 50 mg cetirizine. The latter is marketed as &#039;non-drowsy&#039; and should have less effects on the central nervous system (blocked by the blood-brain barrier), but for me personally that doesn&#039;t seem to be the case. <br /><br />These differences in (side) effects would call for further research, though both substances are fine to use at the indicated dose for the intended purpose. If you are used to taking one tablet of benadryl to sleep, don&#039;t assume taking 10 will work 10 times better though - if you do, you may be in for a very strange experience. Obviously the leaflet says to seek medical attention in case you take more then recommended, but in this case that may prove to be sound advise for some people. <br /><br />

				As an alternative to DXM, K, and DPH, I would try MXE.&nbsp; It&#039;s cheaper than K, four times as potent, and lasts twice as (if not) long(er).&nbsp; It&#039;s really a great drug.<br />I would also recommend you try 25C-NBOMe or 25I-NBOMe.&nbsp; 25c is more comparable to mescaline, whereas 25i is more similar to acid.&nbsp; They both are really great supplements to MDMA, as well.&nbsp; The visuals with both are really beautiful, and if you take these compounds alone, it almost seems like a therapy session in your own head.&nbsp; Very beneficial spiritual tools, and also just a shitton of fun, especially with friends! :D

				I&#039;ve already got some 25c and 25i on the way, and I&#039;m fairly well researched as far as phenethylamines go.<br />I dont want to touch opiods, but I do think i&#039;ll add JWH-073 to my list.
