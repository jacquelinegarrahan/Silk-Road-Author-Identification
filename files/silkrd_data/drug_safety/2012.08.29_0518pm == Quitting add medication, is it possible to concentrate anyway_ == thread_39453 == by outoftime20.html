				First of, have you been diagnosed with ADHD?&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t and you&#039;ve been self-medicating then I think it will take some time to adjust to life without stimulants.&nbsp; If you have ADHD, then I think it depends on whether or not you&#039;ve been on ADHD meds your whole life, or for a short period of time.<br /><br />If it has been for an extremely long time, you can take the strategies you currently have,&nbsp; and try to emulate them without the pills. Likewise, if you have been on meds for a short period of time, you should have picked up methods of concentrating and getting work done.&nbsp; Setting short goals and working in short bursts of energy might help, along with self praise for completing things.&nbsp; If you have high impulsiveness use that as your motivation.&nbsp; I imagine no matter what you end up doing, if you have ADHD it&#039;s going to take you longer than average to do certain tasks.&nbsp; It&#039;s important to play to your strengths, so if you&#039;re a people person try and find an occupation which allows you to benefit from that.&nbsp; If you&#039;re good at developing ideas try and find an occupation where you&#039;re in the brainstorming/development end of things.&nbsp; If you are still in the education system I&#039;d suggest finishing your studies first before changing your meds.&nbsp; Knowing yourself well is the first step to functioning well in a non ADHD world.&nbsp; For example, if you have lots of ideas while talking to other people but can&#039;t say it because you&#039;d be interrupting and thus annoying people, find a way to either hold the thought (write it down/text it?) or tell the people who you interact with on a regular basis about your condition, but you&#039;re trying very hard to adapt and not irritate people and ask that they be patient.&nbsp; You might find people appreciate the interesting links or asides.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest you look into cognitive behavioral therapy, even as self-help.&nbsp; In my experience, it&#039;s about being aware of situations in the future, planning your reaction to them, and managing your cognition and related emotions.<br />

				Noopept at 10mg dose, you won&#039;t notice a direct effect as you would when you pop an adderall, but you&#039;ll gain permanent increases in your cognitive abilities.<br />http://www.ebay.com/itm/Noopept-Best-Nootropic-Better-than-Pramiracetam-1-Gram-Bulk-Powder-/180904673919?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a1ec2427f<br /><br />There have been hundreds of studies on the safety of it, and nothing bad has been found.<br /><br />If you get a headache after taking noopept, start at 50mg of Alpha-GPC, and if it goes away, don&#039;t add more.&nbsp; If it&#039;s still there, double to 100mg.&nbsp; Try to find the minimum amount of Alpha-GPC that you need to prevent the headache.&nbsp; You may get a headache since your brain will be increasing its production of acetylcholine, the primary molecule that neurons use to communicate, and Alpha-GPC is a form of choline that cross the brain-blood-barrier that acts as the choline donor for acetylcholine.<br />http://www.ebay.com/itm/Alpha-GPC-5-Grams-/180896095894?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a1e3f5e96<br /><br />There&#039;s more to nootropics and supplements but start from here and do some research.<br /><br />Your mindset will be the most important thing, like noir said.

				Happens all the time.&nbsp; There are some gems in what noir said.&nbsp; ADHD meds can be a real crutch for some, as they don&#039;t end up learning effective strategies for overcoming specific behavioral problems.&nbsp; It irks me when people are prescribed the meds and aren&#039;t getting the proper help from a professional in conjunction, because once the meds are gone...<br /><br />Anyhoot, there&#039;s a couple of self-help books (although be careful as some pop psychology books are just the devil) or you could get some help from a behavioral therapist that has experience with exactly what you&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; They could at least point you in the right direction.

				If you have legit ADD//ADHD then fuck no!!! At least not for me. I took adderall 7th-12th grade then stopped completely for like four years. When I went back to school I got back on adderall for two years and then tried one semester without it and almost got straight Ds. Despite having dug an enormous hole I got back on adderall right before finals and was able to pull myself up and into four Cs. I learned my lesson, people with legit add absolutely positively NEED adderall and should just accept it. Five years later&gt;&gt;&gt;M.S. Biochemistry and I have no shame about taking adderall, ever, I owe everything I am to it.
