				So I took acid for the first time. I bought 10 hofmann&#039;s blotters from freedompeople. I took half a blotter on monday, felt some mild effects, not too special. Yesterday I took 1 blotter, got myself pretty fucked up. I felt an intense body high, visually things became wobbly and weird, music seemed clearer and at times I felt I was walking on clouds. However I expected to be more fucked up visually, but maybe that was because I only took 1 hit. Towards the peak, I kinda felt my head heavy. Judging by the effects, I think it was acid, but I heard there are RCs with similar effects. The only weird things I noticed is that I became hungry during the trip, the acid hada slight bitter taste (I thought LSD was tasteless) and today I&#039;m having a pretty bad case of diarhea - I&#039;m basically shitting every 10-15 mins. My question is:<br />Could this have been some RC, poorly synthesized acid or is this just a normal reaction? <br />

				I&#039;m not familiar with that vendor. Regarding it possibly being a RC, it is in fact possible for LSD to taste slightly bitter. All the research chemicals I&#039;ve ever tried through a blotter burned and made my gums numb. If bitterness was the only problem, I wouldn&#039;t worry too much.<br /><br />As for the weak effects, two things I can think of. First they could be weak tabs (not saying the vendor you purchased from isn&#039;t legit, but you should check out the LSD Avengers thread for vendors who advertise accurate doses). Second, not every trip is going to be visual. I&#039;ve had trips where I saw next to no visuals, just slightly enhanced colors and stuff. However it put me in that certain state of mind if you know what I mean so it was in no way a waste.<br /><br />Hope I helped, peace!

				Yes it was probably LSD from the sound of it. There can be bitter taste from the ink (RC&#039;s are very bitter and can numb your mouth), some people can or want to eat when taking it, and having the shits the next day is because like other psychs it&#039;s not loved by your gut.<br />You can buy cheap reagent tests if you want to be sure.

				you still got some hits?&nbsp; if you are paranoid buy a test kit. Ehrlich test. <br /><br />i never got diarrhea from acid.<br />&nbsp;i do eat 6-7 hours in. <br />Taste could be leftover solvent.&nbsp; <br />tabs were weak! <br />&nbsp;a lot of ppl expect the visuals to be a lot more brutal. i think lsd alone is pretty laid back in the visuals. especially in low doses. <br />400 and above can get crazy tho. but that&#039;s not recommended for first timers alone. sitter is a must!<br /><br />read up on avengers forum etc.. <br /><br />

				I took another 2 hits on monday, visuals were alot more intense and I didn&#039;t get diarrhea the next day. I&#039;m guessing it was probably because my body didn&#039;t know how to fucking metabolise it. My stomach is pretty sensitive, if I eat something that I don&#039;t like even slightly it reacts like I ate fucking nukes. Also it was probably clean because my tongue didn&#039;t get numb or anything, I&#039;m feeling a lot better about it now. Also I&#039;m starting to like this shit a bit too much, I want to do 500 ug next time, should I get some valium just in case?

I only tried abortion one with Xanax just to try it out.. works but felt soooo bad.&nbsp; that lovely trip space was gone in 10 minutes. felt like i left something out there. like it was all just a dream and i woke up suddenly. all i needed was 0.25 mg to terminate a 200 mic trip. <br /><br />It actually happened 2 weeks ago. did not trip since then.... (but i will flip candy next week some lovely mdma in da house&nbsp; :D)<br /><br />500 mics... hmm... do you have a sitter? someone to be your ego for you when the reality slip out of your hands?&nbsp; and death knocks on your door? are you ready to die? <br />&nbsp;<br />seriously. at that level you can loose yourself soo much.... time travel of consciousness. back to where you came from. you will end up crying for your mother! like a child. it takes you back there. infancy. <br />and after that it really feels like death or the time before birth.. white light and all that. gods even. if you believe in them.&nbsp; fuck. <br />they believe in you. <br /><br />&nbsp;play it safe! its very hard stuff on 400+ doses! kinda stops being playful and can turn brutal.&nbsp; a Hofmann hit is 150 mic? take 3 if you want to. but as i said sitter is recommended.<br />visuals will get strange. world can turn into something like a Salvador Dali painting...&nbsp; tables hanging upside down...<br /><br />i wish you a good trip!! its wonderful stuff. but experiment carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&quot; The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded,<br />&nbsp;Solemnly they stated, He has to die, you know he has to die.<br />&nbsp;All the children learnin&#039;, from books that they were burnin&#039;,<br />&nbsp;Every leaf was turnin&#039;, to watch him die, you know he had to die&nbsp; &quot;<br /><br />
