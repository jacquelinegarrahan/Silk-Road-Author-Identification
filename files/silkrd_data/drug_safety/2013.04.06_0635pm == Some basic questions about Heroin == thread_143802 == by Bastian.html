				Title: <strong>Some basic questions about Heroin</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello all,<br /><br />I would like to know some things about Heroin. I&#039;m interested because of medical benefits.<br /><br />- what is the half-life period of Heroin , and does that depend on the way of consuming it? <br />(which lasts longer: Snort, Vape...)<br /><br />- So how often does one have to take it a day to have a&nbsp; steady dose in the blood without real withdraw?<br /><br />- Can you compare 1g Heroin (if pure) with 1000mg of morphine for example? <br />&nbsp; = &quot;if i would use 50mg of morphine a day, is 50mg of Heroin enough, too - or no way to compare?&quot; <br />(thing is, heroin is much cheaper)<br /><br />- Can you eat it also? (like taking a morphine pill)<br />- Can it be used rectal/anal? (know its a silly question but most substances have greater availability than oral)<br /><br />- How dangerous are the major impurities ? And which way of consuming has less risk with impurities?<br /><br />- How much impurities are common? 20%? 40%? <br /><br />- Is there a rule what the descriptions mean &quot;Nr. 3&quot; &quot;Nr.4 Heroin&quot; - is there a known code, and which is best? Where is the difference between brown and white?<br /><br />- If - worst case - one would have to switch to another opiate - is there a strong withdrawal if you switch to morphine f.e.?<br /><br />Thank you all

				- half life about 6 hours snorting longer/vaping shorter<br /><br />- don&#039;t go over two days and you won&#039;t feel any withdrawal<br /><br />- 1000 mg of diamorphine is 2500 mg of morphine<br /><br />- you can take it oral but you&#039;ll soon find out that 1 gram of heroin isn;t 1 gram at all because of the purity and it would be a waste<br />- yes it can be taken rectally with great bioavailability<br /><br />- you never know what it is cut with (what impurities it has). some may be good like diphenhydramine some bad . Smoking/snorting probably or rectally. If you know your shit then purify heroin you get.<br /><br />- more like how pure heroin is cmmon. Well average is 30-40 %, 60-70% is very good. Shame no one&#039;s sending to check vendors heroin purity to labs and there&#039;s so much heroin users.<br /><br />- no3 is freebase for smoking on foil if you want to shoot&nbsp; it you need to add acid. no4 is hydrochloride its soluble in water and you can snort it/ shoot it. best thing to smoke is black tar - it&#039;s better than heroin.<br /><br />- your tolerance will build up a bit higher but you will still have your opiate so you can lower its dose and go through withdrawal then up again till you;re OK.(neverr done this so I&#039;m not&nbsp; sure)<br /><br />Ok Thats it I need + karma now for my time thanks.<br /><br /><br />

				Thank you so much grdr! <br /><br />I&#039;m new here - don&#039;t know about this karma thing? How can I give you a &quot;+&quot;? <br /><br />And thank you thegalactica420 - but why does the black tar look different in the SR pictures to #3?<br />(but I would use #4 anyway - as far as I&#039;m informed right atm)<br /><br />China white is the purest I guess?<br /><br />Is there a way to work the Heroin - to purify it and have 99,9% heroin? Edit: Found some descriptions :)<br /><br />Thing is, I need it for medical needs and want to be sure that there is no &quot;poison&quot; added or similar.

				Is it hard to stick to the same amount of heroin every day - without going up with the dosage?<br />I would take it as a morphine replacement and don&#039;t plan to do the dark path of getting higher and higher everyday. <br />I would use a method without a rapid rush - no IV! - perhaps snort it - but think would try to eat it or use rectal&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />(excuse my poor english ;) )
