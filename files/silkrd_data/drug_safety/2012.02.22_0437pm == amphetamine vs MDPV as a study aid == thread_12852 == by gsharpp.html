				which one of these two would make for a better study aid based on the ability to keep me motivated, focused, and energetic. I should also be able to take it over a &quot;longer&quot; period of time.

				Can I suggest Ethlyphenidate? It&#039;s an analogue of Ritalin, pretty similar in it&#039;s effect but much cheaper and legal in most places. As for the ones you posted I wouldn&#039;t advise long time wise use of MDPV as it seems to cause psychosis of course it depends what time frame you mean, as in if you mean using weekly for a college term or a day long binge to get work done.

				Ugh, i love it when people talk so much shit about MDPV. It&#039;s the same with any other stimulant. You&#039;re going to want to re dose. You just have to keep that line in your head. &quot;I AM ONLY GONG TO USE THIS TO STUDY.&quot; Because when you loose that thought you start reposing more than you should. I have found 4FA to work really well for me for studying. It also helps when i go to class because 4fa has a very small empathetic feel to it. So that makes me more sociable. <br /><br />I recommend amp for studying just because most people can keep their self from binging. If you have had an addiction&nbsp; problem before or an addictive personality then i hope you don&#039;t pick mdpv. But, at the end of the day people will always have their drug of choice and try to put down other peoples drug of choice. As long as your not hurting yourself or others. Who gives a fuck what you are putting in your body.<br /><br />Oh one more thing 4fa burns like hell if you snort it. You got to snort it at least once. The weird thing is it don&#039;t burn when it first goes up. It slowly sets in and burns. I would compare it to the 2c chemicals in the discomfort you will experience. <br /><br />As always keep doses as small as possible in hopes not to build tolerance and be safe. :)

				I cant imagine MDPV being more expensive per dose considering you&#039;d dose around 5mg<br />5mg of street amphetamine wont get you that far.<br /><br />I personally can not concentrate AT ALL on MDPV. I like the buzz somewhat but I can&#039;t seem to accomplish ANYTHING on it. I feel more like it actually gives me ADD. <br />With amphetamine my head stays absolutely clear, however illicit amp is often cut with a lot of crap and if i ingest the paste I bought on SR i get stomach cramps. I find snorting too intense for focusing.<br /><br />For me personally however the whole study aid idea is inherently stupid: If you can&#039;t accomplish whatever you&#039;re doing without the help of drugs this is simply not a sustainable way to go. Rather the fast-lane to stim-addiction (which is not pretty in any way)<br /><br />

Let me try to clarify what I meant:<br />I am skeptical of the concept of functional drug use (besides to alleviate physical conditions, like in Hawkins case).<br />I do not like the concept that people should fit a societally agreed behavioral pattern and whoever does not fit is deemed &quot;mentally ill&quot;, diagnosed with ADD and put on a steady diet of drugs so they can function. People studying or learning something that interests them so little that they need to drop speed just to be able to focus on it is sad. If you question the meaning of learning shit so you can get a crappy job that allows you to drive a nice car (to work) every fucking day I find speed to be a unsustainable solution. <br />If however this one last exam is between you and this place in a cubicle you are dreaming of, then by all means go for it with any chemical help necessary. <br /><br />An interesting read about this topic is the book &quot;Methland&quot;. The author describes how the workers in the meat packing plants of rural Illinois started using meth just to be able to do double shifts because they could not feed their family otherwise.<br />Turns out that was not a sustainable solution.

				Taking any RC for a study aid is just plain stupid, especially stimulants. Think about Barry Kidston, a college student who synthesized MPPP and shared it with 4 of his friends. Whoops, they all developed Parkinsons. It turns out that MPTP was a major impurity from his synthesis process. At that time, nobody knew MPTP was so neurotoxic that it could cause Parkinsons within a few doses. Fact of the matter is that scientists discover that drugs are bad AFTER people start suffering the consequences. By taking MDPV, you are acting as a guinea pig. Obviously it isn&#039;t as dangerous as MPTP, but the point is that nobody knows its safety profile. The compulsive dosing is a sign of its deleterious mechanism of action. Do research into addiction potentials of stimulants and you&#039;ll learn that fiending in the absence of euphoria is caused by neurogenesis in the reward pathway - these are permanent and lifelong changes.

				Bare in mind that learning is often state dependent, so taking in consideration the fact that the environment and what you are feeling at the time you study, has an effect on where and how you feel while recalling the information you previously learned. <br />So for example if you take (drug) at the time you study, the information may not come back to you until you take (drug) again to feel the same, so your body starts remembering things. <br />I don&#039;t think taking (drug) during an exam would be the best idea, as long as you can hide it from anyone else to avoid trouble. I am in need of stimulants during studying too, although I feel uneasy because my pupils dilate almost every time, I look awfully obvious since my eyes are light. So I chose a bit more difficult and expensive way but it ensures that I wont get caught. Piracetam, Choline &amp; Selegiline at the moment. (I&#039;ve tried MDPV once and I regret taking such an amount before my lesson, I couldn&#039;t help my hands shaking, and left the class early since my mates told me I look like as if I was rolling on mdma ( due to my pupil dilation)

And scientists are damn confident in their drugs before they send it to the FDA because its a long, difficult, and costly process. Keep that in mind every time you try a research chemical. Also, I think you misinterpreted my statement on MDPV. There is nothing wrong with amphetamine... unless you are buying speed cut with god knows what. Most analysis threads I find say that SR vendors cut their stuff with caffeine. Caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptors which are important in amphetamine&#039;s mechanism of action. It merely has an additive effect that dealers capitalize on in exchange for the user&#039;s safety. You want a perfect study drug and are sure you can be responsible? Buy some Methamphetamine. Ignore the taboo on that drug. Follow my guide on safe use:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0<br /><br />Afterwards, do your own research so that you know exactly what you&#039;re doing. Remember, methamphetamine was safe enough to be FDA approved before the media shitstorm ruined its name thanks to binge users. Your only other options are to get prescription amphetamines, methlyphenidate, or modafinil. If you can&#039;t do that, your last option is a nootropic regime (piracetam, etc). All other study drugs are not worth the time.

				mppp is a opiate analog, from what i remember.... <br /><br />idk, all these bath salt shit just trips me out. im pretty sure ive gotten methylone sold to me as mdma before... ffs lol<br /><br />i agree with candorean though - meth is awesome for menial, repetitive shit. and if you get clean clean crystals - it&#039;s just as good, if not better than USP grade amph...<br /><br />the negative effects of any stimulant are... the same as the negative effects of any stimulant - dose dependent, and watch your body temperature, acid/base intake, etc....<br /><br />if you can&#039;t get quality speed, get meth. snort it or eat it - dont smoke it or shoot it, and you&#039;re good.

				OP checking in<br /><br />I|&#039;ve tried Ritalin, amphetamines from two different vendors, and mephedrone. As far as studying goes I believe Ritalin has worked the best for me. It lets me focus on my work and doesn&#039;t really give me a recreational&nbsp; type high like amph or mephedrone so I don&#039;t end up re-dosing trying to get that initial high back. I&#039;m still hesitant to try meth, I guess all the propaganda has gotten to me.<br /><br />I would like to continue using Ritalin but the prices are quite juicy on SR/

Think about Barry Kidston, a college student who synthesized MPPP and shared it with 4 of his friends. Whoops, they all developed Parkinsons. It turns out that MPTP was a major impurity from his synthesis process. At that time, nobody knew MPTP was so neurotoxic that it could cause Parkinsons within a few doses. Fact of the matter is that scientists discover that drugs are bad AFTER people start suffering the consequences. By taking MDPV, you are acting as a guinea pig. Obviously it isn&#039;t as dangerous as MPTP, but the point is that nobody knows its safety profile. The compulsive dosing is a sign of its deleterious mechanism of action. Do research into addiction potentials of stimulants and you&#039;ll learn that fiending in the absence of euphoria is caused by neurogenesis in the reward pathway - these are permanent and lifelong changes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There you have it: case closed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sherlock has cracked the case again, the empirical evidence is there.&nbsp; What more could you want?

I meant the really solid shit - anecdotal evidence. <br /><br />You know what else is fucking stupid, taking aspirin.&nbsp; Way worse then Parkinson, someone actually died. Dude, don&#039;t even get me started on acetaminophen.

				your mileage my very but MDPV is an ENTIRELY different beast than amphetamine to me<br /><br />Outside of cannabis I wouldn&#039;t consider myself addicted to any drug. I&#039;ve used a lot of different drugs but never have a hard time staying away from any of them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used MDPV&nbsp; on 4 occasions and that was enough to realize that I could quickly get carried away into a destructive (and relatively inexpensive) habit<br />I ended up throwing away the rest of what I had. <br />In closing fuck MDPV. :]<br /><br />Here is how I can best describe the difference to you<br />MDPV makes you want to redose, even while you&#039;re still high off of it. The initial dose gives you an overwhelming burst of euphoria that gradually fades into a more &#039;concentrated/speed&#039; experience<br />MDPV&#039;s euphoria rush is mildly disorienting (at higher doses I have difficulty not shaking my voice when I speak. I can&#039;t project my voice at all)<br />MDPV makes me able to concentrate... but for some reason I can only retain focus on ONE or TWO tasks simultaneously. Even then it is difficult to shift my focus.<br />When taking MDPV I develop weird physical tics as the drug wears off. If I am alone I will move in the same pattern over and over without thinking about it. Or I will breath irregularly just because it feels right to do<br /><br />Amphetamine has a less compulsive nature to it. Usually I will administer a single dose of amphetamine.<br />It is far &#039;smoother&#039; speed than MDPV -- the euphoria tends to creep up behind me in and out of the experience (if at all)<br />Amphetamine allows me to stay concentrated simultaneously on MANY tasks and easily shift my focus between them<br />Amphetamine comedown is a lot easier for me to deal with

				There is a reason why speed sells like crazy at collegs before finals. It&#039;s because it works as long as u go to the test tweaking also. Study hard, tweek harder and you&#039;ll do fine on your test. But, that&#039;s really the only time it&#039;s effective.
