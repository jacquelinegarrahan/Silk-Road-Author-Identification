				Has anyone ever noticed that roxys (maybe it happens with other opiates or other pills in general, but this is where I&#039;ve noticed it) start to disintegrate after a few days?&nbsp; I can have a few pills in a bottle that&#039;s otherwise empty, put it in my desk drawer and leave it there for a few days - and then when I come back to it, some of the pills will look like they&#039;ve eroded away - they&#039;re thinner, or chunks appear missing, or whatever.&nbsp; It&#039;s like they&#039;re just disintegrating - but yet there&#039;s no discernible extra residue in the bottom of the container.&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;re talking a container that&#039;s completely undisturbed - and I live in a dry climate, so I&#039;d like to think it&#039;s not ambient humidity.&nbsp; Are roxys inherently unstable?&nbsp; Anyone else seen this and figured out how to keep it from happening (other than just consuming all your pills quickly enough that you don&#039;t have to worry about it) ?<br /><br />For comparison, a bottle of 1mg xanax shows no such effects, even if it&#039;s jostled around, carried with me from place to place, etc.

				I don&#039;t know about roxy in particular, and they definitely shouldn&#039;t in just a few days, but yes a lot of drugs to tend to degenerate over time. The vast majority only lose a little bit of potency gradually over time and don&#039;t become dangerous to take though as some rumours suggest..

				Yeah, I know stuff can lose its potency - but to actually see a pill that looks like half of it has just physically disappeared into thin air is a bit unsettling.&nbsp; Next time I come across some, I might have to run some experiments on storage and handling.&nbsp; Maybe the binder is reacting to the oils in my skin when I handle them or something odd like that.

				From experience, pills are not going to just begin to disintegrate and literally vanish into thin air. Not even when a roxi is accidentally carried in a small pocket for a few days. If they were getting wet they would start to become powdery and crumble leaving lots of residue, but not vaporize into nothing... <br /><br /><br />The only inherent instability of roxi is how quickly it disappears... up my nose.<br /><br />Hate to have a negative outlook, but given their value and potency... Have you considered someone else may be &quot;shaving&quot; tiny bits of pill off at a time, stealing so slowly you are just now beginning to notice? <br /><br />- miR<br />

				I&#039;ve noticed it happening only with the oxy&#039;s made by Mallinckrodt (M30s), and only if they have a lot of room to bounce around in a bottle in my pocket for a few days or they&#039;re loose in a paper towel in my pocket or something like that. But I can see the powder coating the sides of the bottle.

				If you usually keep your shit in your bedroom I HIGHLY suggest that you invest in some sort of safe. Even if you keep your door locked, an addict will find a way in.

				as long as you store your meds in a cool, airtight, dry and dark place they should last indefinitely - pharms are made with such strict regulations that their 99.998% purity leaves nothing in there to facilitate breakdown and the binders are always benign - the only thing that will effect those molecules are exposure to UV, water, oxygen, and foreign (whether it be caustic or acidic) substances.
