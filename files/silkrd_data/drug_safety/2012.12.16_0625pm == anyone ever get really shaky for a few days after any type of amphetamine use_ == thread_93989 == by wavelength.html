				i bought some 4-fa a few days ago and decided it was time for me and my girlfriend to have our first experience together with a euphoric stimulant.&nbsp; because it was her first time and she has never tripped/taken an amphet, i split the tenth in half, and we both took half....<br />it was a great addition to our night. i experience such a sensation of unity with her.. it was unreal.<br />&nbsp;sex was the bomb diggity as well 8)<br /><br />BUT. like the subject states, im wanting to know if anyone has ever gotten really bad shakes from taking an amphetamine and if you know what would cause it....<br />i care deeply about this girl and i feel terrible that me introducing her to other things has already fucking caused negative health effects that may be lasting....(havent went away yet).. her first time doing anything and shes been twitchy/shaky the last few days.. :(

				I know someone who gets shaky after taking any stimulant, even MDMA. He mostly gets it in his legs (we call it the old jimmy legs), but his whole body can shake. It only lasts up to 6-12 hours after the stim wears off, not for days.

				yes 50 mgs each.. i even did the rest of the half g i had later on -_-. but no ill effects is the point. the thought of parkinsons crossed my mind... hard to even deal with that possibility at this point but i am reading more and more that some people shake after taking mdma, and this shit was very euphoric at higher doses. really surprised me haha. i definitely should ask about parkinsons though thanks for that.

				i&#039;ve never had any physical effects lasting over 24 hours after consuming a drug before other than some depression after heavy MDMA use...<br /><br />although...i do remember 4-FA giving me a bit of muscle tension for a few days after use...maybe that&#039;s what&#039;s causing the shakes?<br /><br />50mg seems like a small enough dose for someone with no amphetamine tolerance...i have a bit of tolerance to Adderall and 150mg of 4-FA did me good...

				yeah i mean i even felt the 50 mgs nicely and i pretty much binged on the rest -__-<br />and yeah i sort of thought about the fact that when youve never tripped you lack that ability to truly &quot;let go&quot; and release all tension in your body.<br />i told her to relax a couple of times while in the experience though haha. she was a tiny bit anxious. (btw i asked and no history of parkinsons that she knows of.)

				well she told me before i gave it to her that her stomach hurt so im assuming that she mightve been getting a little sick before and taking it lowered her immune system. she told me she has gotten plenty of sleep but that she felt like shit. her mom said she looked pale, so i told her to take some vitamins, drink some orange juice and stay hydrated....

				This is a bad sign.&nbsp; I&#039;d say nobody should be taking what you got, but you did and you&#039;re fine apparently.&nbsp; So by bad sign I&#039;m saying it sounds to me like she has a genetic predisposition to a parkinson&#039;s like disease.&nbsp; A very strong one, infact, if it&#039;s *days* later and this is still a symptom. Has it improved *at all*?<br /><br />I could tell you some of the stuff that&#039;s ended up happening to me because I take amphetamines, but it wouldn&#039;t apply.&nbsp; All of my symptoms are from repeated abuse.&nbsp; I have never had anything like what you&#039;re describing happen to me from a single dose.&nbsp; Does she have any numbness anywhere on her body?&nbsp; Particularly in areas where she feels shaky?<br /><br />Also, WHAT feels shaky?&nbsp; Just her hands, just her legs, her whole body, specific fingers, all fingers...?&nbsp; And what do you mean by &quot;shaky,&quot; are we talking she just feels like she&#039;s sort of trembly, or she&#039;s knocking shit about she&#039;s shaking so hard?<br /><br />Ignore any tolerance to adderall or meth by the way.&nbsp; I take grams of meth and adderall, and I have *no* tolerance to 2-FMA whatsoever.&nbsp; I mean none, as though I&#039;d never taken an amphetamine before in my life.

				well i just asked her if she had eaten and like a derp, she hasnt. -_-. <br />i shouldve educated her more about it before i gave it to her... but i was so careful that i gave her half of a tenth, i mean fuck....<br />i told her to eat asap, regardless of wether or not she thinks she might throw up. she told me the shaking increases when she gets anxious, but that she didnt have it before this experience(which scares me more that it might be some sort of unconscious nervous tick..)..<br />she also just told me that thinking about food is making her sick to her stomach, and that she has no clue what to eat(almost sounds like the drug is still affecting her o_O) i told her to eat some fruit.<br />&nbsp;this experience was 2 days ago to be exact.<br />oh and im pretty sure its just her hands that are shaky but im not sure.... she told me they have gotten a bit better but its hard to tell if she is trying to sugarcoat her situation to make me feel better about this..

				My friend... this is not good.&nbsp; I mean this is to the level of not good where I almost want to tell you to go to a doctor.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t, yet, myself... but you should, I want you to know that.<br /><br />She must eat.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; If she throws up, she throws up.&nbsp; She has to fucking eat.&nbsp; Not too much!&nbsp; But something.&nbsp; Like I said, if she throws up, she throws up.&nbsp; But she&#039;s gotta try.<br /><br />... the more I think about this, the more I think she seriously needs a doctor.&nbsp; Again, I wouldn&#039;t go myself at this point.&nbsp; But again, this is not normal.&nbsp; She should be fucking hungry as Hell two days later.&nbsp; If she just FEELS trembly... and isn&#039;t REALLY trembling... then maybe it&#039;s not so bad.&nbsp; But if she&#039;s really trembling, it&#039;s bad.&nbsp; Who the fuck knows what was in that shit.&nbsp; From China I assume.&nbsp; Could be heavy metals, lead, God only knows what else.&nbsp; If she doesn&#039;t feel any better after eating and drinking some liquids with a couple hours rest... seriously consider a doctor.&nbsp; It&#039;s to the point where you should go, but I don&#039;t know how old you are or whether you have to worry about her parents or what have you... this just doesn&#039;t happen for no reason though.&nbsp; At this point, any damage is likely done.&nbsp; I doubt they could do anything to help her, but they&#039;d know if this a common symptom of something that could kill her tonight or not.<br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you that.&nbsp; They could.

				it came from a us vendor on here, but i wont spread negative info on them as i truly had a great time with it.... i would have to assume the problem lies within her and how shes been taking care of herself. :-\ she told me she was eating an orange at the moment, i told her to finish that and eat another fruit&nbsp; ;D. i looked into parkinsons and its caused from a lack of dopamine in the brain so i imagine that if you depleted your dopamine, you would have similar symptoms maybe? i did at one point think that maybe this 4-fa might&#039;ve been cut with mdpv because of how much it lifted me when i took another tenth after the .050 i ingested with her. who knows though, i truly did have a great time, and when i got pure mdpv i hated it (but continued to do it regardless&nbsp; ::) ) either way her mom works at a hospital (not a nurse) and she told her to call off work.<br />i guess we are just going to have to wait and see how this unfolds.

				Parkinson&#039;s like diseases are definitely dopamine related, but the brain isn&#039;t that simple.&nbsp; It takes a lot more than dopamine depletion to cause parkinson&#039;s tremors.&nbsp; They don&#039;t just happen for no reason.&nbsp; I hope your girlfriend is okay, and I don&#039;t think you did anything wrong.&nbsp; But there&#039;s some reason that she has tremors, and if it&#039;s two days later, that&#039;s very, very bad.

				when i did 4-FA it was actually quite calm and zen like for me...i didn&#039;t have any desire to go run around or bounce off the walls...and i took 150mg all at once...<br /><br />i hate to say this but this is the risk all of us who choose to take non-FDA approved substances choose to accept...in essence we are all researchers experimenting with our own bodies...and there is always a chance that we represent that small percentage of the population that reacts negatively to a certain substance....<br /><br />but there is hope....the human body is quite resilient....its ability to heal itself is pretty amazing...4-FA&#039;s half life isn&#039;t over 12 hours so as long as she doesn&#039;t take any more it shouldn&#039;t cause any more damage...just give her another day or 2 and see if her condition improves...<br /><br />hell...after my first time taking ecstasy (this was before SR so i can&#039;t say it was pure MDMA) i felt like complete shit the day after but i survived and returned to being a functioning human being....

				yeah.. one of my guesses is that her terrible eating habits shes had lately are contributing to all of this, considering she is pale and is lacking energy as well, or so she tells me. sounds like symptoms of a suicide tuesday for me. same with the anxiety, i always get anxious for a few days after the experience. i can only hope that when she kind of gets over this anxiety, the shaking will stop..<br />thanks for giving a shit fellas. really.<br /><br />(and the 4-fa was very calming and nice for me as well. honestly felt like one of the more perfect stims ive done, and im considering buying more. but this definitely has me turned off to the idea of introducing my girl to anything else =/)

				Was it Etizolam?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had his 2-FMA.&nbsp; I&#039;d call it very pure... but I think he got it from China.&nbsp; Don&#039;t quote me on that though, I can&#039;t even remember why I think it.<br /><br />Gestalt is totally right, the human body and brain are incredibly, I mean like insanely resilient.&nbsp; It&#039;s just astounding what they&#039;re able to heal from.&nbsp; Seriously though, this doesn&#039;t just happen for no reason.&nbsp; She should be extremely cautious trying this again.&nbsp; Something made this happen, and who knows what it was.

				i consider ephedrine a good introductory adrenergic/dopaminergic stimulant...starting with 8mg and progressively increasing the dose each day to 16mg, then 24mg, then 32mg, then 40mg, and 48mg<br /><br />48mg seems to be the sweet spot for me...<br /><br />and SelfSovereignty i think you&#039;re confusing 2-FMA with 4-FA

				one common side effect of stimulants, amphetamines especially, is appetite suppression....<br /><br />and of course we give a shit....to me the SR community is here to correct everything wrong with society&#039;s current drug policies...we are a community and we look out for our own...street dealers for the most part only care about making money and could care less about the health of their customers...i believe that SR isn&#039;t only a place to get drugs but also a place to get information about these drugs so people can make educated decisions about what they do with their bodies....<br /><br />there is a common stereotype that drug users are selfish and don&#039;t care about anything except themselves and getting high and that drugs ruin relationships and tear people apart...you have proven this wrong because you have shown that a drug has actually brought you closer to your girlfriend and made you care even more about her...

				I&#039;m surprised no one recommended l-tryosine. I have a close friend that tends to get the shakes when using any type of upper. She isn&#039;t stopping anytime soon and she gets quite kinky while tweaking. She can keep the shakes at a manageable level if she takes a supplement of l tryosine on the comedown. (During the comedown is when she gets the shakes.) She also takes high doses of vitamin c because speed tends to linger in her system which can lead to anxiety. (I wish my high would last half as long as hers.) She was cleared a ok after her last check up which was a few weeks ago. <br /><br />So, those are some things you could try if she doesn&#039;t want to seek medical help. Which i would recommend since getting reassurance that everything is ok from a medical professional can help alienate anxiety. <br /><br />Also, when i say she becomes shaky. It&#039;s not a jerking, or muscle spasm. It&#039;s more of a tremor most people will receive after the second stage of starvation. She still gets it even if she eats. I&#039;m just stating this as a comparison. I wish i could describe it better. I hope everything is well and please post back with an update.

				be very careful with 4fa. a sneaky sonofabitch. next time when your giving drugs to nonusers give them something that is tried and tested. maybe her natural tolerance is very low. and also doing allergy tests before dosing is a good idea in cases like this. just dose very low and wait for side effects. if nothing happens slowly increase dosage.<br />

				alrighty guys so i guess i should inform you how things have been going (havent been on sr in a bit)<br /><br />her shaking is slowly dying down, but she recently told me she went to the doctor and they told her that she has some sort of health issue that causes people to become weak and makes it harder for their body to get nutrition.(she went to the doctor before the fa, but she told me this after she took it -__-) <br /><br />everytime we talk about it she says she her shaking is because of what the doc told her about not the 4-fa. im not sure why she is strong in her opinions on that.... she didnt have these problems before ingestion so its sort of obvious something is up.<br /><br />and i know an allergy test wouldve been a good idea but 50 mgs, (probably even less as it was one of the least full caps) doesnt sound like a dangerous number for something ive binged on -_-. of course substances affect everyone differently.<br />&nbsp;<br />the l-tyrosine is a good idea. im always eating huge amounts of dairy products and i think part of it is because i know dairy products contain high amounts of l-tyrosine and tryptamine, which helps restore the balance in my mind haha.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				tell her to go see a doctor now!!!<br />even if the effects are fading.<br />she could have died!! hell she could still die... <br /><br />50 mg is not serious?? shit you can have serious allergy reaction from 1mg. this is a research chemical. untested.

It might be a deficiency on using the building blocks when it comes to foods to create the proper amino acids naturally. Maybe introducing supplements into your diet may help.
