				Hey,<br /><br />Trying to cut body fat quickly so I&#039;ve ordered some clenbeutrol, anyone else tried it?<br /><br />If you have tried it do you recommend I do anything else apart from:<br /><br />30 mins cardio a day, weight training 3-4 times a week, good diet and taking 5grams of taurine a day?<br /><br />

				Clen is a nasty drug I absolutely hated it. If you can handle the shakes, anxiety, and social dysfunction then go for it. But make sure your using it correctly, and dieting correctly so you not burning up all you hard earned muscle. I honestly wouldnt use clen or T3 without steroids, because like I said, you&#039;re probably going to be using muscle as energy. Steroids will spare muscle while cutting.<br /><br />A great alternative is a simple ECA(Epherine, caffeine, asprin) stack. Kills your appetite, and gives you great up-beat energy. I have a thread going in this section thats meant for related questions. Check it out.

I&#039;ll be making sure my diet is 100% on point so I think the risk of losing muscle is very slim.<br /><br />Thanks for your input though, did you stack anything with it apart from taurine?

				Clen is fine if you do it in reasonable doses for a reasonable time frame. No longer than 4 weeks on and no higher than 60mcg.
