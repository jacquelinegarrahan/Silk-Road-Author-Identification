				Title: <strong>Set and Setting</strong><br />

				These days I learned something important for my approach in substances. Set and setting.<br /><br />I always thought about this phrase in a literally way. Where I am, with who I am, how am I feeling emotionally and all the general details the complete the background such as music, light etc. And I tried to maximize those details when I am about to take anything.<br /><br />Lately I have been trying to discover and try DMT. This magnificent molecule. After many tries and discussions here in these forums, I realized that my mind kind of blocked the effects of the DMT. Yes, indeed it is a powerful substance but only when your mind &quot;allows&quot; it, will you experience it&#039;s true effects. <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t matter which substance, how &quot;strong&quot; it is, where you are. The important thing is your mind state, what you expect and want to discover through taking your substance. <br /><br />To end this post, I will quote a phrase said by Patricio Dominguez, a shaman:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Set &amp; setting is so important, it&#039;s even more important than the substance. Set &amp; setting is everything. Now, what is the set &amp; setting when you&#039;re blindfolded? The set &amp; setting is not what you&#039;re seeing, because you&#039;re not seeing anything. The set &amp; setting is your internal self, the things that you have learned, the capacities that you have achieved, the conditions of your own psyche and psychology. These are your set &amp; setting. It&#039;s the medicine combined with the interacting with the set &amp; setting that creates an effect of safety, of trust, of comfort and of resourcefulness and makes it possible for you to take some big leaps and receive some big gifts and if that&#039;s not there, you just get terrified.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
