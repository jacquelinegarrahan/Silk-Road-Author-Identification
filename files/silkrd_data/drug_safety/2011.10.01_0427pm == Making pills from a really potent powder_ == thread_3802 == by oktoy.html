				I expect to get some phenazepam next week. For starters, phenazepam is really potent, and I want to take it in doses of .5mg - 1mg to avoid the horror stories where people accidentally take 10mg and go nuts for a week. Second, I have some friends that I&#039;d like to give it to and they are much more used to pills. Third, the idea of possibly being able to make 500, 1mg pills for only ~$50 seems pretty neat. And lastly, there is the possibility of selling them as pills instead of powder, which seems more responsible, and possibly adds value and higher margins to the product. (I&#039;m not currently a seller, but it doesn&#039;t stop my criminal mind).<br /><br />Currently I have a milligram scale, but it only works above about 5mg (and only works well around 10mg). I also have some propylene glycol that I planned to use to dilute it into a liquid. What I&#039;d really like to do, I think, is dilute this with some other kind of powder so that I can put it into capsules (or press it?). But will mixing up 500mg of phenazepam with a bunch of sugar or corn starch produce an even distribution? I&#039;m guessing no. I&#039;ve also considered diluting the stuff into the glycol, then &quot;blottering&quot; it onto some mints.<br /><br />But I have no experience with any of this, so any ideas or guides are appreciated.

				I also prefer pill form! otherwise you could put the powder in little piece of paper like rolling paper and swallow it like this?<br /><br />i think if you mix powder you have to do it really good because otherwise because of different weights you end up with something very uneven?<br />You could just fill first the &quot;active&quot; content into each pill then fill it up with something else to be sure all have same amount i guess!

Scales that measure that amount are thousands of dollars. I have a scale that measures in the milligrams, but not as low as 2mg. Plus, I would love to create a few hundred pills, and even if i could individually measure or eyeball a dose, it would be tedious.<br /><br />I might just have to measure out 10mg and then divide it up into 10 pills. But I also wouldn&#039;t mind the educational experience of learning to make a quality pill.

My suggestion is to just put it in solution with PG and if you want to distribute them, buy small dropper bottles. I&#039;ve done this very successfully.

				Diluting very potent powders in other powders is MOST DEFINITELY NOT for amateurs. That&#039;s how people die with something as potent and potentially lethal as phenazepam or fentanyl(!).That and pressing tablets is not something you can or should do without professional pharmaceutical equipment and training.<br /><br />Diluting it in liquid is the way to go but it is insoluble in water and minimally soluble in 80 proof liquors so definitely use 190 proof everclear or PG
