				I&#039;ve never used heroin and not to act like a hypocrite i&#039;ve done ox, dilauded, morphine and vicodin and all sorts of other opiods, but i puke if i try to do them the next day so i never really got into them and I didn&#039;t IV the dilauded which is supposed to rival Heroin from what some people have said. But I&#039;ve had quite a few friends/acquaintances get into IV&#039;ing&nbsp; Heroin and it always ended in a horror story. I&#039;m very open to the idea that we all have different characteristics and chemical make ups that can lead to some people being alcoholics and others being able to have a few drinks every once and awhile and be fine, I also know alot of people who do coke and even some who do meth on the weekends recreationally who hold down good jobs and keep their shit together.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve never known or heard of anyone who got into Heroin where it didn&#039;t end badly with them going into the ER or rehab or worse. I have to admit i&#039;m not plugged into the H scene so I admit alot of ignorance on this one but I thought of all the places I could go for some knowledge and experience from alot of people with a ton of it on this topic this would be the place to come to.&nbsp; So is it one of those things where if you smoke or snort it it leads to less addiction and some people can handle it when they stick to doing it that way, or is IV&#039;ing it the 90% cause of a horrible addiction.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any insight on this I&#039;ve always been curious since I&#039;ve been so scared of Herion and tried to steer all of my friends away from trying it because of the fear I always had of it. Thanks in advance for any input on this its something i&#039;ve wondered about for a long time and don&#039;t think i&#039;m asking to feel it out after watching one of my roomates go through 5 days of WD&#039;s I have no desire to try it I just wanted to know more about this and if my fears of it were based on alot of real good evidence

				I was a recreational user for several months, then quit a couple months ago. Tired of occasionally puking for several hours afterward, not to mention how my arms looked. So it&#039;s very possible.<br /><br />It depends on a bunch of factors, some of which you listed- how much you enjoy opiates, how much money/time you have to burn, how often you can get another (bunch of) dose(s), etc. I was lucky, and after IV&#039;ing for the first time, I was like, &quot;This is nice. Not as nice as other drugs I&#039;ve tried, though.&quot;<br /><br />On the flip side, I drove my friend to detox yesterday. My friend, who had spent the last week homeless, stealing to eat.

				yes it is very possible. but there is a fine line. mabey 10% of users could do it once a month or even once a week. it really sneaks up on you and your brain chemistry changes. then you start to rationalize it.

				I think its too fine a line to even try to do<br /><br />i say this because i was actually close to just trying it off here and i casually brought it up to my friends at a party and literally everyone simultaneously shouted NO..one of them told me they tried it and regret it...because how it was an instant yearn for it...then the other two reminded me about 4 highscool friends/aquaintances that all died from it...and i was like oh yeah...fuck that.<br /><br />so, nah dude. screw it. the drug literally enters your bloodstream and instantly makes your brain think it needs it.

				Stick to snorting (rather than IV-ing) and be disciplined in when you take it and it&#039;s perfectly possible to be a recreational H user.

				Loong long time Opiate user of over 30 years. Had major knee surgery as 13 yr old and now as a mid aged man I can tell you of the Highest of Hi&#039;s and Lowest of Lows.<br />Heroin, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, etc, ect..of them all the 2 with the Greatest Bite are Oxymorphone&lt;hard to get &amp; expensive&gt; Heroin, easy and cheap.<br /><br />The high is so fucking good that it&#039;s like walking past a juicy, gaping Pussy, good Beer and saying &quot;No thank you.&quot;<br />To say that you can Buy a Gram of H and not pound through it is like swearing to your Mom you&#039;ll Never Jack-off again.<br /><br />Took me years, but I think I have a fairly decent handle on my little &quot;problem&quot; but I dont fool myself.<br /><br />Not at all Preaching, but if you can Limit yourself with a lot of Restraint, it might be possible..over all, just dont kid yourself.<br /><br />oppy

				mmm heroin soo good...... its deffinately impossible to use like lets say mdma the best you can hope for is being an addict that can restrain use most of the time. The first time i ever did heroin the first thought that went threw my head was &quot;I love this shit&quot;&quot; then the second thought was &quot;damn why did i spend all that money on other drugs when i couldve been buying heroin&quot; :)

				My boyfriend used to do heroin recreationally. He did it sporadically for a couple months then did it straight for a week and quit. He never got that hooked to the opiate effect, but he got hella addicted to coke a couple months later!

				But he never IVed H so that is probably a major contributing factor to his not getting addicted!
