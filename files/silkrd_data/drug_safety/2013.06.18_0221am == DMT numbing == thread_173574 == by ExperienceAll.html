				So about an hour ago I was trying to break through with my DMT and after the first hit my mouth and a little bit of the tip of my tongue got numb as fuck. Although the hit was big enough for me to lay down and see all kinds of crazy shit for a few minutes the numbing was very uncomfortable and VERY distracting. Is this normal? If not, why did it happen?
