				This is my first time. Making &quot;The Machine&quot; seems fairly easy but what I need to know is.<br />Once it is complete how/where do you sprinkle the DMT?<br />Do you:<br />1) Sprinkle on top of the steel wool and then insert into bottle so that dmt is on top of the steel wool which is inside the bottle? If you go this route do you then heat up the neck and that will heat up the wool inside thus heating the DMT or do you place flame at the outer part of wool opposite to where the DMT is and that heats up the DMT?<br />OR<br />2) Sprinkle the DMT on top of the steel wool and then insert into bottle so that dmt is actually outside where the opening of the neck is. Then heat up the neck the same way. This version doesn&#039;t really make since since smoke will then actually not be trapped as version 1.<br /><br />Now if it is #1<br />I have read that after one toke your motor skills start giving out. If so how do you load up the dmt again to take the rest of the hits. It seems it might be to much of a task by the 2nd or 3rd hit. Or do just load on round and that would be enough to take 3 hits.<br />Thanks for the help<br />

				You don&#039;t need to remove the Brillo to charge &quot;The Machine&quot;. Put the DMT on top of it and gently heat the neck of the bottle until the DMT melts *into* the steel wool (but you can also heat the DMT from top till it melts, it will work the same; in this last way it is faster but it&#039;s somewhat easier to burn the DMT if you are a little careless. Heating the neck is slower but it usually ensure that the DMT will correctly melt inside since more surface of the Brillo will heat - this is btw less necessary if you have a copper mesh).<br /><br />I know that there are some people around that say that you have to charge &quot;The Machine&quot; from the bottom (as from the hole you drilled), and you can do it if you want, but there&#039;s really no difference. When you melt the DMT on the Brillo it will become an oil that will go inside, so it will make no difference whatsoever from charging it on top or bottom. Moreover &quot;The Machine&quot; works by toking while you apply heat, so the vapor is automatically sucked in the bottle.<br /><br />The people that insist that the &quot;correct and original&quot; way is to put the DMT on the bottom clearly didn&#039;t read well the original article where &quot;the machine&quot; appeared for the first time, because there it is clearly specified that DMT must be put on TOP of the Brillo (with this last already positioned) and the neck of the bottle gentle heated until the DMT melts inside. This is the quote taken from there:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Welcome to The Machine</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To charge The Machine, enough [DMT] for one or more good doses is directly applied to the surface of the steel wool at the mouth of the bottle. The mouth of the bottle is then gently heated just enough to cause the alkaloid to melt into the steel wool plug.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As you see, the article clearly states that the DMT is to be put on top of an already present plug, so the people in some forums saying that putting the DMT from the bottom is the correct way as specified from the creators of the method are, in fact, wrong (willingly or not). It works also that way, but it is more hassle for no difference whatsoever, because the DMT will melt inside in both cases and in both cases vapor will be sucked inside by the toke.<br /><br />As for your question about taking more than one hit etc.: the beauty of &quot;The Machine&quot; is that one toke is usually all that&#039;s necessary. That&#039;s because you need to charge it with much less DMT (15-30 mg should be enough for a normal breakthrough) and so you can easily vaporize and suck all the vapor into one single hit. The trick is to do a slow and steady toke (and if you want to be extremely sure on the first times when you are almost to go out of breath suck in as strong as you can) while you apply heat to the brillo. Anyway you will be able to do a 2nd toke without problems in case you cannot get all the vapor in one single hit.

				Why do people use The Machine? Can&#039;t you just use any old vape, or a crack pipe? I hear a crack pipe works fine, right?

				Ive smoked DMT out of everything you can think of: Pipe, Electric Vaporizer, Bong, Crack pipe, DMT Machine, etc...<br /><br />I found the DMT machine extremely easy to use and break through with, but a bong works just as well. I actually bought a meth/crack pipe specifically for DMT use and it didn&#039;t work nearly as well as I expected. There just wasn&#039;t enough room in the ball at the end of the pipe for enough vapor to form so I ended up just getting a body high instead of breaking through.<br /><br />I still think the bong is the simplest way to smoke it, unless you&#039;ve already made a DMT machine :-) Then of course use that...

				I recently tried to make a machine and ran into 2 issues, first my hole in the bottle is sort of small, maybe 6mm in diameter, will this be a serious issue?<br /><br />Secondly, and more importantly, my chorboy pad said it was pure copper, but when I took a MAP torch to it to burn off the oils the copper quickly turned a dull steel color. My roomate said that this is just because the torch was WAY to powerful and has oxidized the copper, but then again, he says a lot of things. Is this normal? Is this an issue? Should I get a new pad?

What I know is that there are some brands of rubber pads that say &quot;pure copper&quot; when in fact it is isn&#039;t, it is just steel covered with a thin layer of copper that when you apply heat on it it goes away (it is in fact what it gets burned out when torched along oils and other impurities; in short those rubber pads are frauds - copper costs a lot more than steel and they cheat). However also what your roommate says it is true; with an high temperature the copper oxidizes and so it turns in a greyish color (however it&#039;s a different color than oxidized steel, you should be able to recognize one from the other). This happens normally with pure copper pads when torched (it happens with all copper, as copper wire).<br /><br />I had an hard time to find where I live a PURE copper steel wool of the right coarse mesh. Since I cannot know if Chore Boy is, indeed, pure copper, in your case it can be both things. One thing is sure: if it is not pure copper then it&#039;s much better simple stainless steel.<br /><br />As for the hole, it is fine. If you can enlarge it a little it&#039;s better but if you have fear of breaking the bottle leave it at that, it will work without problems.

You will simply not be able to vaporize the DMT correctly since it runs everywhere and you cannot keep up while DMT begins to make effect (and it&#039;s impossible to take all in one hit with a crack pipe).<br /><br />Instead with The Machine this &quot;issue&quot; is used as an advantage. Since the oil will tend to &quot;run away&quot; this will make the oil turn into vapor - without burning - while it tries to escape from the source of heat, because of the heat transfer capability of the metal.
