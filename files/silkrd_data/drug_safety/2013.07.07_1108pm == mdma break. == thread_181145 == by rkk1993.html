				I have took mdma more than I want to recently and I want to take a break. I have 500 mgs of 2cb and a couple of capsuls of methylone around the house. I&#039;ve never tried 2cb at low doses by itself only mixed with mdma or a large dose.and never tried methylone because I just got them last week and was still doing mdma. Is a low dose of 2cb a good alternative? I got it to trip but I know at low doses it gives euphoria close to mdma. And then the methylone is it so close to mdma that I should not take it for a couple months also.<br /><br />. I just don&#039;t want to overwork my serotonin. And I kno a lot of use can cause neurotoxicity. Can someone help me out I&#039;m really interested in the 2cb so any advice on anything about it would be greatly apreciated.

Just start at 15mg or so and up the dose if you like it.

				Probably no harm in taking a break! I&#039;ve not tried 2c-b, just 2c-e. The little envelope I have has lasted a long time, since the doses are very low. I do hear you about taking too much mdma, but I&#039;m definitely looking forward to going to the post office tomorrow to see if I&#039;ll be rolling after work tomorrow night! Still hard to believe that I wait on the mailman to see if I&#039;m getting high, but I suspect I&#039;ll be in for a long run of rolling on a regular basis :/ I&#039;ll probably be posting about taking a break in a month&#039;s time.
