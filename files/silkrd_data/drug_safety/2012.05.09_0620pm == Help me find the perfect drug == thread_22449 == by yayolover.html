				I&#039;ve done X, coke and weed before.&nbsp; All with varying degrees of happiness.&nbsp; I am looking for a drug that I can take (swallow or snort) that will give me a euphoric feeling, won&#039;t make me tired or twitchy and will allow me to fuck without coke dick.&nbsp; I only want it to last an hour or so, nothing as long as X.&nbsp; Any ideas?

				Hmmm...a few Vicodins (5mg) should do the trick, or 1 Norco (7mg). Since you&#039;ll have an intolerance, they will probably make you tired initially, but once you build up a bit of tolerance, they will do the opposite (give you energy + euphoria). However, I highly disclaim the potential for physical and mental addiction.<br /><br />Your second, less expensive, dangerous and addictive-free option is a good solid 1/2 hour Thao/Zen meditation. ;) Breathe in, breathe out. Deeply. 30 minutes of that, and you&#039;ll be feeling euphoric, guaranteed (with a high degree of happiness.)

				Personally, my favorites are MDMA, marijuana and marijuana extracts, and LSD, DMT<br /><br />I dig mephedrone, 2C-B and Ketamine from time to time. <br /><br />When i go to an event and want to be in a state of pure bliss i eat about 150mg and a hit or two of LSD about an hour after eating the MDMA<br /><br />Thats just me though.<br /><br />Check out Erowid.org and read around, see what might be for you

				Heroin. It&#039;s kind of perfect. But you could try less potent opiates, too, if you don&#039;t want to take it.

And I&#039;m kind of taken aback you&#039;d recommend to a first time opiate user, to snort Oxys/Roxys. This guy doesn&#039;t want a $1k a week habit, he wants to get his kicks now and then. Jesus.

				although i am partial to insufflation as well, the oral bioavailability of oxy and hydrocodone are actually significantly higher than insufflated and plus lasts longer<br /><br />i got seriously addicted to opioids and still am thanks to oxy... no one should under estimate the danger. ive now switched to H and really theres not much difference which surprised me. unless you start shooting

				Maybe it&#039;s not exactly what you&#039;re looking for, but it&#039;s pretty damn close and you won&#039;t have to go very far out of your way to try DXM.
