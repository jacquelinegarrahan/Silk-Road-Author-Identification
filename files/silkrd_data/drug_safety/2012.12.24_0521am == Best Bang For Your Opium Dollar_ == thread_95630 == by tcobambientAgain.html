				Cruising around and looking at all the pills and trying to figure out the best high for least amount of money.&nbsp; For me it&#039;d be a Fent patch because I&#039;d just cut it into pieces and chew on them.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

				mrDutchGuy sells pure fentanyl salt (powder) for at it&#039;s lowest quantity $90 for 10mg, that&#039;s $9/mg !!!!&nbsp; Assume your dose for fentanyl is 200µg per dose.&nbsp; That&#039;s $1.90 ($9/5) for one full dose of a powerful opiate analog, I can&#039;t think of a better bang for your buck then that.<br /><br />Just, you must be unimaginably careful, we&#039;re talking µg magnitude doses here, no mg scale will help you there and you&#039;d have to have a quality volumetric flask (and know how to use it).<br /><br />Luckily he also sells a fentanyl nasal spray, which is $125 for 10mg, so a bit more, but still @ $12.50/mg or $2.50 per 200µg dose, that&#039;s incredibly cheap !!! (just remember to ask him to add a preservative, because he doesn&#039;t do it by default for some reason and in his vendor profile states that you must ask for it).&nbsp; Was my mistake, but the guy is helping me out with free preservative, a free nasal sprayer (atomizer), and free shipping ... I couldn&#039;t possibly ask for better service then that, was not expecting when I made a food out of myself saying I forgot to ask for a preservative that the guy would go to such length to help !&nbsp; Being a nasal spray, presumably he will have already diluted your fentanyl into the appropriate amount of water for the concentration of the listing&#039;s he has posted.<br /><br />Those prices btw are on his lowest quantity listings.&nbsp; I can only imagine that the prices get even more absolutely ridiculously cheaper if you were to buy in bulk or even semi bulk.<br /><br />Just remember, this is a µg scale drug, BE FUCKING CAREFUL !<br /><br />He seem&#039;s legit too, over 300 transactions in 3 months with a (100) record, top 6% of vendor&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />You the man mrDutchGuy, thank you for this eternity waiting broken mail system for my order, but i&#039;m sure once they finally decide to deliver my goods I will be pleased as punch, his feedback certainly seem&#039;s to reflect very satisfied customers.

				Dude don&#039;t go straight to fentanyl that&#039;s just fucking ridiculous.<br />Heroin either.<br /><br />Try dilaudid, oxycodone, maybe hydrocodones when you still got the chance (low tolerance).<br />You&#039;ll thank me later, seriously you don&#039;t wanna destroy your tolerance that fast!

				Oh.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used all of those in the past.&nbsp; Never heroin but the thought has crossed my mind.&nbsp; Maybe just snorting a bit.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t used any opiates in about a year but just going through some shit and I feel like getting high and not worrying about it (girl problems).&nbsp; I just want to relax and not care.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard Subutex(sp) will get you high if you&#039;re not a regular opiate user.&nbsp; I know it comes in a film where I could slice it up into like 5 pieces?&nbsp; I have no idea.&nbsp; Just thinking out loud.&nbsp; Anyone have a clue on Subutex?&nbsp; <br />Anyway, with prices as they are on pills is it a good idea to give heroin a first try.&nbsp; Just small amount to check it out or (it goes back to price again) is it better to go with pills?&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95630.msg679415#msg679415">Quote from: berry13 on December 24, 2012, 06:14 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dude don&#039;t go straight to fentanyl that&#039;s just fucking ridiculous.<br />Heroin either.<br /><br />Try dilaudid, oxycodone, maybe hydrocodones when you still got the chance (low tolerance).<br />You&#039;ll thank me later, seriously you don&#039;t wanna destroy your tolerance that fast!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				i think you should&nbsp; go with pills. Take something you are experienced with. <br /><br />be very very careful with powders, those are full of shit sometimes. at least the pills are medical quality.<br />Maybe get some morphine.<br />

				The heroin thing makes me a little nervous.&nbsp; I&#039;m probably going to snort whatever I get.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had morphine after a couple surgeries but never in pill form.&nbsp; Just debating Morphine or Roxy or ??&nbsp; Just not sure.&nbsp; Percs would be a waste of time for me.&nbsp; It takes a lot to get me high.&nbsp;

				Morphine or roxy. Here is the answer:<br /><br />Morphine if you&#039;re okay with plugging it up your bum, it&#039;s oral BA isn&#039;t too hot. <br /><br />Get it from krikrivano if you can wait for it to come. - silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/88dc901dac<br /><br />I&#039;d plug oxy as well only because it hits faster. but it isn&#039;t a waste to eat or snort as much as morphine is.<br /><br />I very much urge you to find someone local if you can. Opiate prices here are jacked. I just picked up 12 blues and 6 dilaudids 4mg&#039;s for $200 from a bangin&#039; hot girl who I found a few weeks ago which would have cost me $350 at least here.
