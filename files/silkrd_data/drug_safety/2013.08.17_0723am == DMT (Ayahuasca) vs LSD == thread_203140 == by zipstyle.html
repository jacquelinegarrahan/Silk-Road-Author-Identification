				So what are your thoughts on Ayahuasca&#039;s ability to &quot;heal&quot; and &quot;enlighten&quot; in comparison to LSD?<br />Do you think that both have similar capabilities? Can similar or the same (therapeutic/transcendent) end be achieved with both?<br /><br />I have used LSD many times throughout my life and I feel like it has definitely opened up my perspective and consciousness in numerous ways. Probably would have taken traditional psychotherapy a year or so to accomplish what I have in some of my trips. However, I have never tried ayahuasca but I have tried DMT (smoked, rectal, and insufflated). Is an ayahuasca ceremony something I should still consider seeking out, or do you think I could use LSD to achieve similar ends?

				The experience of cosmic consciousness is the same regardless of what drug you take to reach that level of consciousness.&nbsp; True, you can experience radically different things that are extraneous to cosmic consciousness depending on what drug you took, but once you reach the level of cosmic consciousness, it no longer matters what drug you took to get to that level. To say that DMT is &quot;better&quot; than LSD is an absurdity. Cosmic consciousness has nothing to do with the drug -- the drug only opens your mind to that experience. It is a catalyst, nothing more.<br /><br />Ayahuasca is definitely worth experimenting, and you may be able to reach higher levels of consciousness with it than LSD, but that depends more on you than the drug itself. Some drugs are more congenial to some minds than others. Some people work better with mushrooms, others with LSD, and others with DMT and Ayahuasca. <br /><br />They all have therapetic potential.&nbsp; But if you think you are not getting enough from LSD, definitely experiment with Ayahuasca and other psychedelic substances.

				while they both can be very therapeutic, ayahuasca is particularly powerful medicine. amazonian shamans consider it sacred and use it mostly for deep healing. it has been known to cure illnesses which have no known cure, such as cancer. never underestimate the power of mother earth! ;)

				zipstyle i&#039;m kind of the opposite as i&#039;ve mentioned on the microdosing forum. I drank ayahuasca in ceremonies for many years, and now feel that that period has closed (pretty much) and am interested in lsd and other substances. There are lots to think about here<br /><br />while it has a lot to do with you and where you are, it also has a lot to do with the shaman you&#039;re working with. many people who take psychedelics really want to get out of it, and they can get knocked down and rolling around the floor and they think that&#039;s fun. personally, i&#039;ve been there with ayahuasca and it wasn&#039;t fun, and one of the main things to remember is the vomiting.<br />Ayahuasca is a conscious plant which can be guided to help you to heal deep issues, often from past lifes, even from thousands of years ago. these nuggets of pain, or restrictions in cosmic flow, can be extremely tough to bring up. I understand LSD might do this too in its own way, but i am sure that they are very different. I have been to places where the nausea and burning is so severe, because you are being held in a place to look at some really important issues in your life. you may need to vomit and you may have your face in a bucket for a long time. i&#039;ve never seen this on lsd.<br /><br />my two cents, with a &quot;good&quot; shaman, i expect that you can have experiences that will surpass LSDs curative powers. i&#039;ve mentioned before that it is said that DMT is the &quot;light&quot; which is used as you enter the cave of Baanisteriopsis. there is an element here which i expect to be wholly different than DMT experience. <br />

I don&#039;t like to say this on the forums, because I know it will get backlash, but a lot of people think they can do a shaman&#039;s work but can&#039;t. Saying that, you can use ayahuasca, but you will probably be engaging in energies that might be ... unclear, shall we say. <br />Ayahuasca is a super ancient tradition, it&#039;s not like the LSD culture or even the magic mushroom revivals we have nowadays. It&#039;s a way of life for the cultures in south america (not talking about Sante Daime here). They work with it in the jungle and have massive politics around the whole thing, I&#039;m sure you know. With ayahuasca, you are engaging in that, with a tradition and cultures. Of course people can use it outside of that, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the same thing - it just can&#039;t be described. Not only is a trained, gentle shaman critical for a holistic journey, but the groups of people who take it together are absolutely critical - there is no question. People talk about ego death on the forums like it&#039;s a goal - this is shit. people live and work beyond the ego all the time, and the group you are with will determine your pathway through the spirit world, because you and them are the same, and the blockages that bring all your energy together will be addressed by the ayahuasca. <br />I got advice that I think is really valuable, and that&#039;s that if you&#039;re serious, go to Takawasi, a medical ayahuasca center who will show you the medicine without the politics of the peruvian cultures (necessarily).<br />Taking it alone is just a different thing, and MAKING it alone is completely different. The process of making it is immense, and tripped out teenagers boiling it up on a hotplate and drinking for the trip? shit man, that just makes me nauseaous.
