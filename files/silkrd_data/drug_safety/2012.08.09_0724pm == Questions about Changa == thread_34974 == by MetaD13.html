				I want to try DMT, but I heard that Changa is better for your first time. How is the regular DMT experience different from Changa? Is the duration and intensity different or the same?<br /><br />Also, do I need some special pipe to smoke this? Would a regular pipe and lighter(not jet) be fine?<br /><br />

				A hit of changa is going to be 1/4 or 1/8 the intensity of a good hit of crystal DMT. It&#039;s exactly the same feeling.&nbsp; Changa is with an MAOI like harmala, which will give you a long-duration warm glow and help keep you high on the DMT for longer. I think with changa there is a tradeoff, in that it is more difficult to &quot;breakthrough.&quot;<br /><br />Changa is cool to roll in a joint, or to put in any kind of pipe. Enjoy your experience! And lay off if you find you just aren&#039;t quite ready for it.

				changa is more &quot;grounded&quot; than freebase dmt, due to the maoi. more earthy, less alien. definitely recommended if you&#039;re nervous about freebase. it&#039;s usually smoked out of a dry bong... not really sure why it has to be dry though.

				Changa is also easier to smoke then freebase gives you more room for mistake. Freebase can be a hasske tl learn how to perfect and gunk up your pipe or bong

				First a little harm reduction advice.<br /><br />Changa is DMT with a MAOI, where ever your MAOI is from taking a MAOI with certain drugs and foods can cause unpleasant or even fatal reactions.&nbsp; The size and impact of food effects is hugely dependent on you as a person, but you can have headaches and nausea. The effects of a MAOI and certain drugs can be fatal. DO NOT use MAOIs (so for example an ayahuasca brew, changa) together with stimulants (like mdma/amphetamines) or SSRI medication (like prozac), this can cause serotonin syndrome and lead to convulsions or even death.<br /><br />Adding the effects of the MAOI depends greatly on the ratio in the smoked substance. The MAOI lengthens the experience and introduces a context that isn&#039;t there with DMT. You may find the experience more&nbsp; smoother and more insightful. The will definatley be more a nature and plant element You will require more product to break through even if you have a 1:1 ratio of DMT to leaf. <br /><br />A small dry or even water filled bong is good for changa, take deep breaths and hold it as for pure DMT. If you break through on 30mg of DMT with good smoking technique expect to breakthrough on double the amount of 1:1 ratio changa.

Changa is defined as MAOI + DMT. What you CAN&#039;T do is take MAOI orally (eat it) in combination with those foods you mentioned. Smoking MAOI + DMT (changa) doesn&#039;t come with this restriction. Look up &quot;MAOI diet&quot; for details.

				I did Changa for my first time a week ago. I&#039;m still getting headaches and shit from consuming anything outside of the MAOI restrictive diet. Its the most uncomfortable and frustrating thing ever. It boggles my mind that there&#039;s all this information out there claiming that you don&#039;t need to avoid any foods before or after Changa use. I know everyone&#039;s bodies are different, but my grilfriend has been going through the same situation for just as long, so is that just a coincidence? Reading other forums leads me to believe that it&#039;s just a crap shoot. Other people, every now and then complain of something similar. I think it&#039;s probably true that the risk of a true hypertensive crisis or emergency is far less with changa, but you can still get terrible headaches, confusion, nausea, (possibly some organ damage?) by the tryamine build up. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;My current consensus is, fuck MAOI&#039;s, it&#039;s not worth it. I don&#039;t like having my bodies abiility to deal with something as docile as cheese or advil for a long period of time taken away. Just my 2 cents. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m just trying to deduct what the hell might have caused that kind of reaction days afterwards. I&#039;ll start to feel better, eat something that might be high in tyramines, and the all too familiar symptoms come rushing back. My guess is that Buddhanature&#039;s changa is just fairly loaded with Rue extract, it&#039;s the only explaination and it all adds up with the literature on MAOI&#039;s out there. I think the term &quot;safe&quot; that you see so often in regards to reversable MAOI&#039;s is refering to the fact that you are less likely to suffer from a hypertensive crisis. Meaning you are less likely to rush to the hospital or much less likely to die. However, my experience shows you are extrememely likely to suffer undesirable side effects if you completely ignore your tyramine levels preceeding and following your Changa usage. It&#039;s now 10 days after my experience, and that&#039;s my conclusion. Both my girlfriend and I had roughly the same experience, so take that in consideration, or don&#039;t. There&#039;s plenty of people out there who pay no mind to the diet and smoke changa and have no problems, but it seems like you at least run that risk if you don&#039;t. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider also that what you are about to embark on is undeniably spiritual. The shaman of the amazon preach that the diet is in respect of the spirits, and they&#039;ll be more likely to be easier on you if you sacrifice for them. This changa business is something the white man conjured up in the modern world, but the chemistry is pretty similar to the tradition. Just makes sense to me. <br />
