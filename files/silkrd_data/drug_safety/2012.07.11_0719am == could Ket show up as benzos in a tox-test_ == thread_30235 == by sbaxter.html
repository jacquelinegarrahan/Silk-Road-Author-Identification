				Hi,<br /><br />this is probably a total n00b question, but still: Could Ketamine show up as benzos in a (large) tox-test?<br />I am asking because my doctor told me that there are signs of benzos in my urine and/or blood, while I was taking very little benzos, maybe a valium once a week or so,<br />but quite a lot of Ket.<br /><br />(this is just out of curiosity, the doctor is an old friend of mine, but still I wouldn&#039;t want him to know about the Ket, as I have lied to him about that and amd steadily decreasing dosage anyway)<br />

				No.&nbsp; Ketamine is a completely different class of drugs than a benzo and will not show up as one.

				Yeah as grand wizard said, it is most likely the valium. Ive tested positive from benzos seven day after being clean from very infrequent use. Its defiantly possible.
