				My friends found a rather small vial that&#039;s been in a protected from light because it fits perfectly inside a small keychain that screws apart..&nbsp; Inside is a SLIGHTLY yellow liquid with an oily consistency.&nbsp; It has a faint smell that I recognize from somewhere but that I can&#039;t pinpoint.<br /><br />The two people who found it accidently got a small amount on their fingers and within 10-15 minutes noticed a change in perception.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering what could possibly be in it.&nbsp; I&#039;m really curious and kind of want to try a drop.&nbsp; I&#039;m concerned though, that if it is acid and potent enough to cause effects that quickly through the skin it might be much more than a hit.&nbsp; Alternatively it could be something other than acid that I really don&#039;t want to ingest.&nbsp; I&#039;m relatively sure it&#039;s a drug intended to be consumed as it&#039;s on a keychain, and there&#039;s a small piece of the lid that extends down into the bottle and acts as a &#039;dropper&#039; of sorts.&nbsp; If you pull out the lid there is a drop on the end of the small skinny piece that goes down into the bottle.<br /><br />Any and all input or advice is appreciated. :D

				Of course I&#039;d start low. :)&nbsp; I know it could be poison, but I kind of doubted that someone would carry poison around with them..&nbsp; I DO appreciate your responses.&nbsp; This is, after all, the reason I made the thread.<br /><br />Anyone with practical experience in the are have some input?

				That kind of sounds like someone who doesn&#039;t have other peoples best interest in mind.&nbsp; My friends found it in one of their family member&#039;s old stuff when they were cleaning out an old house.&nbsp; An old pothead.&nbsp; <br /><br />Especially since after coming into contact with it they described visual effects my assumption was that it was a psychedelic.&nbsp; I was just surprised at how quickly they described the effects coming on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any other input?
