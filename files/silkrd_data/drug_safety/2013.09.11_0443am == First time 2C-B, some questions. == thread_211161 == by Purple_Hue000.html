				Finally getting some for the first time. I&#039;m new to 2c-B but not new to psychedelics. Generally speaking what should I expect from 12mg of 2c-B?&nbsp; Is it suitable for a music venue?&nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to hear some of your experiences with 2c-B? Also how does 25B-NBOMe compare? <br /><br />Does 2c-B mix well with either MDMA and/or LSD?

				Love 2cb. If the quality is as good as what I got 12mg orally will give you a nice empathic edge totally able to function in social settings. Music is good. If you want it to be a bit more psychedelic in-sulfate the 12mg in one nostril. It will hit harder and faster and burn for a minute or a few so have some privacy. I find snorting it is more visual. be careful NOT TO EVER eyeball a dose. I did once when my scales went wonky and it was not cool at all. I thought I had fried myself for good. Later it gracefully evened out thank god. 2cb is generally the safest 2c drug but do not underestimate it. 25mg is about my preferred oral dose but doses of 10-12 sometimes meet the occasion better.<br /><br />MDMA has great synergy. I prefer it on the tail of the roll of a light 150mg roll. The MDMA re-manifests a bit and the 2cb actually helps the moody day after providing a nice afterglow.<br /><br />It also goes well with 4ho-mipt and some say 4aco-dmt. I have blended 6mg each for a nice social mix. I prefer 4ho-Mipt to MDMA btw. See phikal for Shulgin&#039;s qualifiers.<br /><br />2cb+YOGA = A+++

				My experience is very similar to princeblack49&#039;s! I also have different doses for different settings. 18 mg for social (like going to a bar with some friends. I don&#039;t drink any alcohol, and don&#039;t like to be completely sober with friends who are drinking), 25 mg for clubbing. I also eyeballed once, and took too much (30-35 I guess). With the help of some comforting friends it turned out very well, but I would not liked that being alone or in a club. 2c-b for me was the reason to buy a precision scale<br /><br />As for synergy: it indeed combines very well with MDMA but also with Methylone.

				well the 2C-B that i&#039;m getting is pressed pills with about 12.5mg&#039;s of&nbsp; 2c-b in them.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if I should start with one or a half pill for my first time? (since I&#039;ll be at a small but intense concert)<br /><br />Also is there any discomfort during the come up?&nbsp; &nbsp;for me MDMA doesn&#039;t have a uncomfortable come up at all.<br />Does smoking cigarettes feel good on 2c-b just like it does on mdma?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing my homework on 2c-B and reading about it for over a few years now but just now I&#039;m finally getting around to actually trying some. <br /><br />Is it also a good drug to chill on with some friends and a girl?&nbsp; <br />

				Smoking zigs feels good to you on MDMA? For me the need for zigs is almost = zero when I&#039;m rolling and the &quot;feature&quot; that MDMA has that makes you breathe easier and a lot better is countered a little bit, at least for a short amount of time.<br /><br />I&#039;m (hopefully) trying 2c-b very soon. I&#039;m in mostly for the aphrodisiac effect and the body high, not so much for the possible visuals on higher doses. Are 10mg enough for these two effects?<br />I&#039;m pretty sure that I&#039;ll combine it with MDMA at the first time, fuck mono. ;)<br />

				I&#039;m gonna be on it by myself. I&#039;d like for my girl to try some but I really don&#039;t feel like explaining what &quot;2c-B&quot; is to her. Though I do know from reading that it&#039;s a pretty easy going, forgiving drug. So maybe eventually I&#039;ll get her to try it with me.&nbsp; Instead I&#039;m just gonna pop one of my 12.5mg 2c-b pills right as we get into the venue and just dance and enjoy the music and see what happens. Then on the second night I&#039;ll pop probably around 150mg of MDMA. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m just asking all this because this will be my first time with a new substance but I&#039;m no fuckin lightweight when it comes to drugs. I could handle myself and keep my cool even when my Shroom trips were getting chaotic and outta hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				In that case, depending on your body weight, I would definitely take more than 12.5 mg. One and a half pill would be around 19mg. Maybe even take two. 2c-b is quite controllable.<br />

				I know you guys can&#039;t give me and honestly response but I&#039;m just wondering if 12.5mg of 2c-B is even enough to feel the effects.&nbsp; Would 12.5mg be in the foreground or would it just feel like the substance is working in the background?&nbsp; I would like to feel the effects of 2c-B&nbsp; without having to tell myself &quot;is this it?&quot;&nbsp; Just like when you take a good amount of MDMA and you know you&#039;re rollin!! ha.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m afraid of taking one of my 2c-B pills, then it being underwhelming.

It has a versatile profile that changes by the mg.<br />If all you have is 12mg and you want to trip harder snort it. <br />or pop 12 mg and when you feel it snort another. Then you will most definitely get off

				As I said in the previous post I have tested 2C-B.<br />Had 100mg in 5 capsules straight from Bulma and her Capsule Corp. ;)<br /><br />First I want to say: It is very light on the nose! Unlike all of the reports I have read. After a few seconds you don&#039;t notice it anymore and the initial feeling is not painful at all to me. The same night I snorted MDMA and that was very heavy in the nose even though were perfect clean white freshly crushed rocks and then for about 20 minutes I had to drink like half a liter water because of the taste in my throat, very intense!<br />With MDMA I would always prefer making myself 120mg capsules, so I can drop 2, and then later 1 or 2. With 2C-B this seems to be the best method also, 20mg capsules are good. 10-12mg would not be enough for me for anything.<br /><br />I made combi-capsules with 10-15mg 2C-B and 120mg MDMA. Also I made myself a few lines with it. Because of it being so soft on the nose and because you need only like 10-50mg it is really tempting to consume it nasally. The onset is much faster of course, and it seems to stimulate the CNS more this way. But as I said oral is the best for MDMA and for 2C-B. The effect of both substances is in my opinion best experienced with oral consumption.<br /><br />I will not write about the experience because it is VERY personal, even more than LSD.<br />So much Sensuality and body feeling, so much insight and also light visual effects. Enormous. I don&#039;t know Mescalin but a common name for 2C-B is Bromo-Mescaline, early in the trip I liked the name Bee&#039;s more, I thought it was more fitting, later as the visuals came into place I thought that bromo-mescalin is a better name for it. Nexus and Venus are of course excellent names too.<br /><br />So I took about 200mg MDMA and 10mg 2C-B as the initial dose. I know I know one should take the 2C-B at t+04:00 or even later when taking MDMA. I didn&#039;t do it like this. ;)<br />I was very wild and UBER sensual. I redosed MDMA a lot in the following hours, and started to snort the 2C-B, about 5mg per hit, sometimes more. I would say after a few hours I had about 400-500mg MDMA and 40-50mg 2C-B in my system. Also I ate 3 blotters but that was much much later t+12:00 or something like that, they didn&#039;t have a strong effect, but they made the visuals of the 2C-B a little bit more prominent. Also I smoked good amounts of Super Silver Haze throughout all of this.<br /><br />The comedown was manageable, especially because I was swimming in awesome body feelings when I touched something or myself, very relaxed at the end, and I STILL had sex until I had a major orgasm that made the lights out you could say, near-death-mode and unnaturally long and intense, 5 minutes after that I felt asleep, which does not happen to me anytime, but I was pure exhausted, REALLY. I would not recommend anyone to take that much top quality MDMA without <br />a) being 110kg+<br />b) have a tolerance, at least a bit.<br />c) know your body well and being able to control it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(d) have a titan stomach (check)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(e) have a strong heart (doppelherz - check)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One experiences increased consciousness of physical health and energy, or, on the other hand, sharpened awareness of any body imbalance or discomfort.<br />[...]<br />It is a superb tool for learning and growth.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Eisner (1989)</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Perhaps the best use that has been found for 2C-B is as a synergist with MDMA. When taken together, the MDMA pushes the non-specific 2C-B reaction in a more warm and emphathetic direction. Because 2C-B is a psychedelic drug, and therefore not fully predictable, its action can take the user in many different directions. But if the set and setting are right, 2C-B can enhance the desire for sexual orgasm during an MDMA experience. The synergy of the two substances can on occasion be a true aphrodisiac.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Quote for truth, best things I have read about it.<br /><br />2C-B is perfect for relationship building and sex.
