				Mescaline is amazing! One of my most euphoric trips. <br /><br />I say just order a 12&quot; cutting of bridgesii off the clearnet. I mean shit it&#039;s legal. <br />Look up ways to prepare it and have a good time. <br /><br />I have done this three times.

I am from Australia so had to source locally but I hot the jackpot today.

If all goes well, I might even start selling some on SR. <br /><br />Is Mescaline really that similar of a trip to MDMA? <br /><br />Ive tried shrooms many times buy so busting for mescaline more than anything else.<br /><br />

Higher doses are both, feel good and psychedelic. <br />Many users compare MDMA high to mescaline high however mescaline high is much more spiritual and teaches you things... MDMA roll is almost very shallow and very narcissistic. From what I understand, most rate mescaline as a better drug than MDMA. <br /><br />I never got into MDMA partly cos Australia has shitty drugs that are either too diluted or simply dirty. The idea of a hairy biker making my MDMA is at best revolting. Hence why I much rather take mescaline for a nice roll like high. I also like tripping on low dose shrooms at festivals. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Pihkal gives the alternative.<br />More cheap the downsides.<br /><br />In the Netherlands you should be able to find a growers starting-package fot your little green stones.<br /><br />It is just to much work ,<br />if Pihkal gives you the same for far less money.<br /><br />But do you want the real green stones like you did read in Carlos the Casteneda in wishdom is power or on of his other books, you should order a starting-kit and grow your own. <br /><br />It is just to expensive to get almost tehe same feeling for saf less mkoney

				Love love love messcaline.&nbsp; The reason it&#039;s so rare is because the percentage of mescaline in cactii is very low so extraction yields are not plentiful and the extractions take a while.<br /><br />Fortunately I ordered several kilos of cactii powder a while back and extracted enough to keep me and my friends happy for life.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />The only thing I would compare to MDMA is some of the euphoria.&nbsp; It can be a very visual and intense trip although I rarely reach the mindfuck that I might on say LSD.&nbsp; Last time I took 900mg and by the end of the trip I could not remove a particular fractal pattern from anything I was seeing.&nbsp; It had invaded my entire vision and even with my eyes closed it was tough to go to sleep in this state.<br /><br />The visuals on mescaline to me make it seem like the entire world is digitized in HD.&nbsp; Everything is so pretty and beautiful.&nbsp; Much different than LSD .&nbsp; I feel like LSD makes things uglier/scarier most of the time.&nbsp; Shrooms can go either way.&nbsp; But Mescaline is always positive on visuals (unless you can&#039;t get the fractals out of your head haha).

				Growing a cactus is a great idea!<br /><br />How long to you need before your bridgesii will provide you with enough mescaline for a decent trip? Then you just remove and eat a part of the cactus and it keeps growing?<br /><br />Thanks :-)
