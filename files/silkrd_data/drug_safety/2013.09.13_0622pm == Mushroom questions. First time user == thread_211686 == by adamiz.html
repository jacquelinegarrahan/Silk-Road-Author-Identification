				Hello friends,<br /><br />Well, I been liking psychedelics and have experienced couple of times LSD and about 20-30 times DMT.<br /><br />Now time has come for mushrooms and I really have no clue about them. <br />So to start with, I bought from a friend who grew his own Psilocybin (or Psilocin, not sure).<br />He told me that 5g are really ok and a strong trip. So I was thinking to either take it all or split it with a friend of mine.<br /><br />But then I started searching the proper dose on the net and have gotten a variety of answers. <br />This is from erowid for example<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> A &quot;manageable dose&quot; of psilocybin/psilocin would be around 0.25 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) and a high dose to be 0.5 mg/kg. A low dose is probably around 0.125 mg/kg. This translates to low dose to high dose range of 10 mg-40 mg for an 80 kg adult. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So can anybody suggest a good dose? I think 2.5g is way to little but then I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Secondly which is the best way to take it? Just eat it as it is? Or make a tea out it? <br /><br />Thirdly, I need to ask this so I know. He sold me the whole mushroom. I had the thought that only the &quot;head&quot; had the &quot;good stuff&quot;. So how is it then?<br /><br />He also suggested me to take it on empty stomach. They say this also for LSD but I prefer taking a good breakfast and after 1-2 hours take the blotter so I have my desired energy. Any difference with mushrooms? <br />I am also concerned about the nausea that some people mention.<br /><br />And final question.<br />DMT works amazing with while on LSD, how is the combo with mushrooms?<br /><br />That is my questions for now. Thanks in advance for your time and answers.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />

				2.5g is a good place to start off.&nbsp; Since you already have experience with some psychedelics.&nbsp; If you weren&#039;t even 1.5-2g is enough for the average beginner.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have experience with DMT so can&#039;t compare or help you with that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly I don&#039;t know how to explain the differences very well, maybe someone else can chime in.&nbsp; Mushrooms definitely cause more body load and you feel way more like jello.&nbsp; A lot of the time you feel like you are melting in to your seat or bed. <br /><br />Eat it all, stems and caps.&nbsp; No point in only eating caps.&nbsp; Yes, caps are more concentrated but there&#039;s still quite a bit in the stems. <br /><br />Chew it as best you can and swallow it down with some orange juice.&nbsp; Really chew it well.<br /><br />You can definitely eat a light meal and wait 2 hours before consuming your mushrooms.

				we usually recommend 3 - 3.5 gram dose, but again the lighter - moderate trip also depends on many things, your state of mind, location, anxiety, etc.&nbsp; For the first time we would recommend not going for a strong trip as there is always some anxiety in trying anything for the first time even if you try to deny it to yourself.&nbsp; Work up to stronger trips progressively.&nbsp; Also if you start at a lower dose and feel you can handle a little more you can always add on 0.5 grams every 30-45 min - <br /><br />No our vendor plug:&nbsp; If you decide you like shrooms you can always check us out at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b0184f0ffd we always have primo products at very competitive prices<br /><br />VV

				3.5 g is standard for an experienced explorer. 5 grams is Terence McKenna level.<br /><br />Mushrooms are real different than LSD or DMT. Enjoy your time!

				I&#039;d recommend grinding up 2.5g and mix it with lemon juice then chug it for a good first mushroom trip.

Google lemon tek method for more info on this. You could definitely use shrooms once per month without gaining significant tolerance assuming that its the only psychedelic you&#039;re using that month.

				Hello again guys.<br /><br />So I tested the mushrooms I got the other day and split 5g with a friend of mine. Nice experience overall, lots of laughter and nice thoughts. I didn&#039;t experience any visual or depth of colors as I expected. Pretty much like a normal LSD dose. Will buy some more next week and thinking of raising the dose just a bit. Between 3.5-5.<br /><br />I have again one question for you.<br /><br />How does time effect the product? Through my search on net, I noticed that dry mushrooms are more effective than wet. The product I got was ,if I am correct 3-4 weeks old or maybe even more. They looked dehydrated anyway. <br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />

				My first times were around 3grams of dried, mostly cap. Libery caps. After I got experience I would usually take 6 grams sometimes going up to 8 grams of all cap. Those days were great, The summer of 1999 was my summer of love. colorfull, fluffy, swirly and hot.
