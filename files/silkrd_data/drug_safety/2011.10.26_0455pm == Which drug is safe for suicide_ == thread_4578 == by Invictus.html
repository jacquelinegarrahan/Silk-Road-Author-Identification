				Hi there,<br /><br />I know this is a tough question. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s even allowed here. But please read my post before you delete it. (If it&#039;s not allowed here)<br />But I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the spirit of Silk Road, hehe. <br /><br />Back to the topic:<br /><br />I have Huntington&#039;s disease. My mother died of it.<br />Not long ago first symptoms started showing up. I have maybe 15 years left or so.<br /><br />I will not kill myself in the near future. But when the time comes, I want to be prepared. <br /><br />So I&#039;m looking for a cheap, effective and durable drug or a combination of some drugs to shortcut the process. Also some LD50 info would be nice.<br /><br />Because I wanna be remembered as the person which I am right now and not some sick person.<br /><br />And because I&#039;am Invictus.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I am the master of my fate<br />I am the captain of my soul.

				Pentobarbital, an anesthetic, is one of the most common ways to put down animals.&nbsp; It can put an animal down between 30 seconds to 2 minutes.&nbsp; It has said to be painless, but I obviously have never tried it myself.&nbsp; I don&#039;t condone suicide, though I think assisted suicide in the case of those who are suffering has it&#039;s place.

				I don&#039;t condone suicide at all.&nbsp; Suffering is suffering though, and I guess if I was suffering so badly I wanted to end it, there would be little to stop me.<br /><br />If I were to do it, I&#039;d probably order up a cocktail of drugs, and have a proper superbinge.<br />I&#039;d start with all my favorite chems to make me feel good, like some LSD, pot, MDMA, 2C-B.<br />Then towards the comedown I&#039;d shoot an assload of heroin so I&#039;d go out in ecstasy.<br /><br />I figure, if I blew my brain on large doses of psyches and RCs I wouldn&#039;t care if I was alive or not, and if I was able after all that to actually hate my situation enough to carry through, the H would make it easy and gentle.

				I sympathize with your position and admire your effort to think this out ahead of time rather than get to a situation where you make a decision in haste that you could then live to regret.<br /><br />Drugs may not be the best option though.<br /><br />Pentobarbital is an incredibly bitter substance and doses that are high enough to be &quot;safely&quot; effective are likely to cause severe nausea, vomiting and discomfort. This is why the assisted suicide clinics that use pento always pre-dose with a strong antiemetic (anti-sickness drug). If I was considering the drug route then I think a massive overdose of a sedating opioid would be easier to get right.<br /><br />If you are serious about investigating this I&#039;d read some of the literature provided by organizations like Dignitas and Exit International. Aside from providing concrete instructions using reliable methods that use easily obtained materials they also have a great deal of information and experience to help a person cope with such a decision and to allow them to reach a decision that is theirs and that is right for them.<br /><br />Seriously, I hope your prognosis is pessimistic, the doctors are wrong and that you get to enjoy the next 15 years and a whole lot more besides but I know Huntingdon&#039;s is a terrible condition and I wish you all the best whatever decisions you come to.

				nitrous oxide, heroin overdose or blow your brains out with a gun... thats what i would do...probably nitrous oxide first<br /><br />nitrous oxide, i think thats the method where you sit in the car and connect the tube to the exhaust and then stick it in&nbsp; your window....you can listen to tunes too while you go....<br /><br />to tailor this method to your needs, you could get fucking wasted beforehand on A-Z of Drugs,write a suicide note about how you were pissed off with your cat for not eating a cranberry pie you made it...and then go set up the car to kill yourself softly via the toxic gas..everyone will just think you were fucked out your mind on drugs so you killed yourself that way...especially after seeing your silly suicide note.lol...plus the autopsy will confirm that you were drugged up beyond belief....take funny drugs though....like acid and shrooms...you win <br /><br />

				The great--and very troubled--short story writer, Thom Jones, wrote a story about a lady and her friend, a black ex-con, both comitting suicide while on the phone to each other...was pretty damned good story.&nbsp; I always figured I&#039;d just stock up on a bunch of skag and go out that way...overdoses are pretty painless, in my experience.&nbsp; Painful is coming to, in a hospital, with people pounding on your chest and lights in your eyes...<br /><br />Fair enough question, but I laughed: seeing suicide and &#039;safe&#039; in the same sentence, ha ha...the whole idea of suicide kind of goes against the idea of &#039;safe.&#039;&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp;But that&#039;s the great existential question, according to Camus...great guy to read, if you haven&#039;t already...myth of sysyphus and some other shit...he gets it....what any thinking man is up against, to one degree or another...most hide, in religion, in drugs, in family, in *something*...even Bukowski said that life is pretty hard to take straight.&nbsp; When he was lying in an L.A. charity ward with a neon &#039;jesus saves&#039; light flashing underneath his window....

				I&#039;ve never heard of short story writer, Thom Jones or Camus.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really know anything about Bukowski&nbsp; either.<br /><br />I do know a little about Jack Kevorkian and techniques. Drugs. All things considered, I like the gun. Quick and painless. Pain is subjective and so is quality of life. When it&#039;s your time, it&#039;s your choice. Too soon is better than too late. 1 chance. Choose wisely.<br /><br />Or, I recommend Marijuana. Think about it. EVERYONE always says &quot;Marijuana never hurt anybody.&quot; YOU could be the first. Trail blazer, innovator, history maker. The &quot;how&quot; is on you. A bag around your head while you smoke? I don&#039;t know. Suffocation would probably get the credit.&nbsp; Just try to be upside down and or naked. Or some other funny or unusual situation. GET NOTICED. Those situations get more attention.<br /><br />Destroy all evidence before hand. Get rid of all the mail and wipe your computer clean. Microwave the hard drive for a long time. DO NOT GET ANYONE IN TROUBLE! Leave a note or video. Preferably video of everything. But just a before hand account with an explanation is ok I guess. Remember to live while you are still able to. Good luck w/ whatever choice you choose.<br /><br />

				Well I ain&#039;t no expert but get this.....<br /><br />My aunt lives in Florida and the only thing she could take for her chronic back and hip pain was Co-Proxamol which is dextropropoxyphene with tylenol instead of the usual painkillers oxycodone and tylenol.<br /><br />Unfortunately they pulled it off the market cuz co-proxamol was becoming the fastest easiest most painless means of suicide in the USA!<br /><br />Google it up and you will be able to validate this.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m sorry to hear you&#039;re considering this, but I do understand. In my opinion, H overdose would be the way to go. The effects of the overdose would be a bitch, but you&#039;d be so far off in opiate-land it wouldn&#039;t matter. I hope you decide not to though.

				I wouldn&#039;t use drugs at all.&nbsp; There is a fairly good chance that you will survive and end up too messed up to make another chance.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have access to a firearm (of any kind, and yes you can fuck this up too if you don&#039;t know exactly what to do ie: brain stem) then look into something like laying down with your neck across a train track or something equally permanent.&nbsp; <br /><br />A mask and a tank full of nitrous is a good way to go, as long as you don&#039;t knock the mask off accidentally.&nbsp;

				Sorry to hear about your devastating condition! However, I would try to be as optimistic and be grateful for the time you have left. I feel you have already accepted your fate, but I would recommend you battle against your condition. <br /><br />There are drugs to reduce the symptomatic aspect currently, especially those that reduce the loss of muscular control. There are also ones that may help to slow the progression of the disease through neuroprotective mechanisms by reducing the damage induced by glutamate toxicity as well as reducing caspase activation (leads to programmed cell death, called apoptosis).<br /><br />Also, medical science is rapidly progressing toward more effective therapeutic strategies that may even be able to REVERSE the damage done by the mutated form of the Huntington protein. <br /><br />One of my favorites is gene knockdown therapy (as my name would suggest, as microRNA is a type of interfering regulatory RNA) which will target the sequence producing the mutated protein, leading to greatly reduced levels and drastically slowing the neurodegeneration. Intrabodies (or intracellular antibodies) are also a promising avenue... now all we need are effective delivery strategies.<br /><br />Probably the best known and most promising approach involves stem cell replacement therapy. Research has already shown improvements in animal models of HD by grafting stem cells that literally replace the neurons that have died. This means that your condition could improve in the future and I do not recommend doing anything hasty such as committing suicide. In ten years there is likely to be extremely effective treatment for you! Try to stay strong and I wish you the best.<br /><br />- miRNA<br />

I have been witness to deaths in my family that were long and drawn out. Illnesses that made shadows of my former loved ones in frail shells. I would like to avoid that too. I would like to also not be a burden and cause the grief that it did to my loved ones. I would rather have a party, say my proper goodbyes to everyone with a smile on my face and leave gracefully. A plain ticket to Switzerland for the long dirtnap.<br /><br />That being said, method wise I would want some way of inducing hypoxia. It has been documented to be a very pleasant way to go. No fear, no real realisation what is happening and a rather euphoric sensation.

				Invictus..I feel your Pain. I Really do. I&#039;m bi-polar and when the down side blues hit,&nbsp; life&#039;s outlook drastically change. Here&#039;s the problem with Suicide. Sometimes it doesnt work. I have chronic RA in my bones and joints. Several years ago I took 5 80mg Oxys, 5 10 mg ambiens, crushed them up and just to make sure I slugged it all down with a Pint of Jack Daniels. It was totally my intent to put myself out of misery. Out bad luck (or good luck), my body;s will to survive kicked in and w/out my Mind&#039;s permission my body started to heave and somehow crawled its way to a bathroom. A neighbor happened to hear the heaving, called 911. Next thing I know, instead of waking up Dead as planned, I awoke from a few days coma to to family &amp; friends in hospital room. Boy, talk about embarassing. My point is that this is a very personal decision on Coping with an Emotional pain that is so deep within that there seem to be no other options. Most people dont understand it. I was 100% sure my cocktail was going to work..it didnt.

				Don&#039;t give up. The human body is an incredible machine capable of just about anything. Your attitude is what will keep you alive. If they say you have 15 years now if you give up and stop fighting and just wait to die, you will only make it 7. Live your life worry about this time when it comes.&nbsp; And like mentioned earlier 5-7 years down the road there could be come incredible breakthroughs with modern medicine.&nbsp; The moment you stop fighting it is over.

				Ah, I made a mistake in my earlier post. It&#039;s no longer possible to suck the gel out of a fentanyl patch. The gel is now, somehow, woven into the patch and can&#039;t be sucked out. Some people say you can cut pieces of the patch and chew on them or stick them on your gums to absorb the fentanyl and others say it doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />Your best bet is to get some immediate release (IR) oxycodone and use that in place of fentanyl. Here is my revised recipe:<br /><br />Get the following:<br /><br />Immediate Release (IR) Oxycodone - around 80mg should do you in if you don&#039;t have a tolerance to opaites<br />Xanax - a few MG should do<br />Ambien - you just need a couple<br />Promethazine - this is usually available on SR, it should help your body absorb as much of the opiod as possible and reduce the chance of nausea and vomitous. Somebody is selling an &quot;Opiate potentiation pack&quot; which includes promethazine, Chlorpromazine, and Naproxen, which might be a better option.<br /><br /><br />Instructions:<br /><br />1. Take the xanax, ambien, and promethazine (or opiate potentiation pack).<br />2. Wait maybe 15-20 minutes (i&#039;m not 100% sure about how long to wait).<br />3. Take about 80mg of IR oxycodone (these kick in FAST)<br />4. This should do you in.<br /><br />Any additional notes or critiques are welcome.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />SB

				i didnt read the whole thread but the best way out in my opinion is probably helium poisoning, get a canister of helium and a bag over your head to contain it, youll simply drift out, no pain etc, other than that i know they use barbituates such as phenobarbital for animal euthanasia so im imagining thats quite a mild way to go if you will and i believe dextropropoxyphene mixed with alcohol is effective too, i think youd die of respiratory depression but youd likely be aslepp/out cold by that point anyway, but my personal choice is the helium angle though<br /><br />also id advise avoiding the tobacco one, it basically causes you a heart attack, not a nice way to go, similarly caffeine can kill you, its not a nice death though

				That is a very sad story and I feel very bad for you. I couldn&#039;t imagine being faced with what you are. However, the least painful way to go would probably be an overdose on a feel-good drug. Heroin, like a lot of people have said would do it.<br /><br />You have to think of your family though if/when you decide to go. DO NOT use a gun, that would be devastating for your family. They would like a body to look at in a casket. Do not hang yourself. I had a cousin who did that and for some reason they had an open casket. The way she looked haunted me for a long time. Heroin can even cause some very bad looks, like foam coming from your mouth. This can be cleaned up easily though.<br /><br />I hope that you live a good long time!

You need a good cocktail of drugs. Drug combinations are exponentially more lethal than any individual drug. I would choose a combination of barbiturates, opiates, and an anti-emetic. start with the anti-emetic. They are typically not scheduled, and easily available. Then give yourself a hefty dose of a strong painkiller, like heroin or morphine. wait for that to kick in, then give yourself the full cocktail. Mix more painkillers with a bunch of barbiturates, like phenobarbital. maybe throw in some benzodiazepines for good measure. <br /><br />one important thing to remember is that if your trying to kill yourself, stick to one genre of drugs. all downers is the easier. don&#039;t throw any coke, meth, or adderall in there or anything. shit, dont even have a cup of coffee. its possible that it will increase the required lethal dose.<br /><br />Why am I so supportive? Because I&#039;ve seen people fade slowly into death before. By the time they die, its almost a blessing, because their pain is over. Don&#039;t do it too early though, OP. Wait for the latest you possibly can.

				You guys realize if he became the first person to OD on THC our cause would be set back a good 10-20 years right? <br /><br />That said, I&#039;m really sorry to hear about your condition. Heroin sounds like a good idea to me as well, from what I hear it&#039;s a peaceful way to go

However, I would try to be as optimistic and be grateful for the time you have left. I feel you have already accepted your fate, but I would recommend you battle against your condition. <br /><br />There are drugs to reduce the symptomatic aspect currently, especially those that reduce the loss of muscular control. There are also ones that may help to slow the progression of the disease through neuroprotective mechanisms by reducing the damage induced by glutamate toxicity as well as reducing caspase activation (leads to programmed cell death, called apoptosis).<br /><br />Also, medical science is rapidly progressing toward more effective therapeutic strategies that may even be able to REVERSE the damage done by the mutated form of the Huntington protein. <br /><br />One of my favorites is gene knockdown therapy (as my name would suggest, as microRNA is a type of interfering regulatory RNA) which will target the sequence producing the mutated protein, leading to greatly reduced levels and drastically slowing the neurodegeneration. Intrabodies (or intracellular antibodies) are also a promising avenue... now all we need are effective delivery strategies.<br /><br />Probably the best known and most promising approach involves stem cell replacement therapy. Research has already shown improvements in animal models of HD by grafting stem cells that literally replace the neurons that have died. This means that your condition could improve in the future and I do not recommend doing anything hasty such as committing suicide. In ten years there is likely to be extremely effective treatment for you! Try to stay strong and I wish you the best.<br /><br />- miRNA<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This.<br /><br />Please try to stick it out for a decade or two.

				Well, in the WWII films they always give the soldier an overdose of morphine, but heroin would probably work better. I read that the spy&#039;s like carried a cyanide pill to kill themselves so they could not be interrogated.<br /><br />I would suggest first pushing life to the limits first. Seeing as how you have already come to terms with your death, you could try to like swim across the English Channel, Climb really dangerous mountain peaks, or go spelunking into an uncharged cave and make a map. Maybe try to walk all the way across America or Europe, or something else vary challenging that most people would not try because they ether don&#039;t want to risk their life or don&#039;t have time to spar because they&#039;re working on their career.<br /><br />Even simply the walking across America adventure would be quite the journey. You would have an experience that many people never do.<br /><br />Basically what my point is, Knowing that you are going to die in about 15 years dose not at all mean that you can not have a vary full life. In fact, as many doors as the situation closes, it opens just as many by freeing you from the shackles of future. You are free to take risks and push life to the extreme.

Sodium cyanide is readily avail, and almost fail safe, thats my out.<br />Whatever you do, please dont rush your decision. Make the most of everyday, meet as many people as possible, and be the kindest person you can to everyone. Ive put it off for a few years, I&#039;ll never be happy, but have made it my lifes purpose to try and make those important to me happy, Im glad Ive held off for a while when think of their smiles

				I&#039;d just like to say that i have the utmost respect and admiration for your ability to deal with your situation calmly and logically. Not many people could do that you know!<br /><br />Getting down to your question, this is something i have thought about quite a bit, and i always come to the same conclusion - a HUGE H overdose would be my personal method of choice. I&#039;d probably sweeten my self up and kill my anxieties with a handful of benzo&#039;s, then i&#039;d make sure i had a decent amount of some real high quality H, and make sure i had the means or experience to do it intraveinously. Then i&#039;d probably give myself a fairly huge hit that won&#039;t kill me, but will make me feel real good for a while before i go for the final/killer shot.<br /><br />I know this is a bit of a morbid conversation to be having, but all credit to the OP for addressing his issues full on. You have BALLS my friend, and i admire that.<br /><br />Whatever happens, i genuinely hope everything works out well for you....

				I read that the lead singer of Boston killed himself in this manner.<br /><br />You could get some charcoal and burn a few pieces inside a tent or other enclosed area.<br /><br />I understand this is the most painless. You go to sleep and don&#039;t wake up.<br /><br />I&#039;m just not exactly sure how much charcoal to tell you to burn, and whether or not being in an enclosed space with it will make your eyes burn.<br /><br />But the charcoal packages come with a warning right on it, &quot;Do not burn in an enclosed area at risk of death.&quot; or some shit.<br /><br />Be careful with that one though. If a passerby doesn&#039;t know what&#039;s going on, they could die to. You&#039;ll wanna be out of the way and maybe post warnings and shit.
