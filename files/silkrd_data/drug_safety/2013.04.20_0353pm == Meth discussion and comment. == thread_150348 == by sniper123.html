				I feel that we need a thread where we can converse and share our stories on meth. (Rambles.) I personally enjoy reading stories of people&#039;s experiences. (What they did, seen, and felt while on meth.) But, i don&#039;t enjoy seeing this in the meth product and vendor review thread.<br /><br />So I decided it would be a good idea to create a thread where everyone is welcome to share their rambles, information, and comment on meth.<br /><br />All that i ask is you use proper grammar. (Capitalization, punctuation, and paragraphing.) <br /><br />I&#039;ll also be starting a new topic from time to time and you&#039;ll be able to find it in the OP. you don&#039;t have to stick to the topic, but i feel that it&#039;ll keep the thread from going stale.<br /><br />So come on in and make your self at home. Load a bowl, snort a rail, swallow some, or shoot up and share your rambles. :) <br /><br />First topic:Do you prefer to get twacked or simply tweak? (I personally feel that tweaking means when you do enough to where you feel good, motivated, and have a nice buzz. Twacked is where you are so spun, that days are flying by, and you find yourself in auto pilot mode.) <br /><br />I personally enjoy to be twacked. I don&#039;t enjoy tweaking anymore. It feels boring and i don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m having a good time unless I&#039;m twacked. I&#039;ll admit that i am a meth addict and that has some to do with me enjoying being twacked. So what do you personally enjoy more and why? <br /><br /><br />Is priority shipping a must when ordering meth from a vendor? For me i prefer priority or up.

				Yeah, I&#039;m with you on the twacked thing.&nbsp; So now I&#039;ve got to schedule 48 hours of nothing in order to use because there is no way I can get anything productive done or function for an extended period of time in public, and I&#039;m definitely not driving a vehicle. <br /><br /><br />Thanks for starting this thread, hopefully the entertainment will follow.&nbsp;

				Anyone interested in trying Meth should read this thread<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0<br /><br />for vendor info<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9715.0<br /><br />Its a long thread because, once tweeked you tend to be verbose :)<br /><br />For me its a lovely high that should be kept for special occasions. The prevailing view is once per month for an optimum high.<br /><br />But be warned, its easy to get caught up in the cycle of needing more and more on a daily basis.<br /><br /><br /><br />
