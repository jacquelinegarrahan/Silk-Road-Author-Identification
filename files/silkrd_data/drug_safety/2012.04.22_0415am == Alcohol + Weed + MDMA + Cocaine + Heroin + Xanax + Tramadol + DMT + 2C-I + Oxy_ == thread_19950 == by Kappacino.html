				Going on a trip to London soon with a couple pals. Saved up quite a lot of money for this so we&#039;re going all out.<br /><br />Over the course of the 2-3 days we&#039;re gonna try and get through all of the aforementioned drugs, but we&#039;ve decided that unless we want to die we should do them in chemically safe pairs/groups and space our experiences out. So for example Alcohol + weed + mdma first then when that wears off Coke + 2c-I etc.. Only thing is my knowledge of chemistry is pretty shit, if someone could help me out and tell me which ones definitely can&#039;t be taken at the same time (and if whether by waiting for the drugs effects to stop, this actually eliminates adverse chemical reactions , or can bad shit still happen just by the chemicals presence in your system)

				Alot of these drugs drain the brain of certain chemicals. Taking so many different drugs in a short amount of time would render some drug less effective or put more strain on the brain. Mostly serotonin and dopamine, as well as other receptors and chemicals. <br /><br />Just saying that some drugs may be wasted, but sounds like&nbsp; fun weekend :P<br /><br />I prefer not to mix alot of drugs, but thats me. I would suggest you only do stuff you&#039;ve done before, so you know how you&#039;ll react.

				Well sometimes you don&#039;t have time to see how your body reacts. This is why you start small and just keep redosing bigger amounts through out the day so you get the synergy affect at some point haha&nbsp; :P But you will if your doing all those drugs! You should start off with DMT and then start smoking after you soak your dmt trip. Then start drinking and doing cocaine. When you feel you can do another drug take some small amounts of Heroin. Fuck the Oxy until your done with your weekend. Because oxys are nothing haha. Also eat the oxy so it lasts a long time and you get the full effect.<br /><br />Then for the next day or depending what your doing, and maybe the times you have to take a certain drug, you do 2C-I the first day and DMT during the peak. And then when your coming down from that start drinking. And once you start getting drunk start doing coke and a little Heroin, as well as smoking weed. And then depending what time it is take some xanax haha. This if at the end of the day will knock you out instantly so you can not feel the come down of any of those drugs haha. <br /><br />When you wake up doing a fat line of coke and smoke a bowl. Then keep doing coke and smoking all day as well as doing Heroin. This will make you feel dope as fuck. And then the next do do DMT again and do whatever drugs you have left later haha.<br /><br />Weeeeeeee! Fun fun fun! I&#039;m doing coke so thats why I&#039;m just talking bs LOL. But those are some safe ways to do combinations of drugs haha<br /><br />Have fun!!!

We&#039;ll probably end up following that plan.<br /><br />I just won 3 hits of acid in Anarcho47s lotto so if that gets here on time I&#039;ll throw that in to the mix too. I think this is probably safe<br /><br />Day 1: Morning - DMT. Afternoon - Coke/Alcohol/Weed. Evening - Heroin, then Xanax when its wore off<br />Day 2: Morning - 2C-I. Afternoon - Coke/Weed/Alcohol/Heroin. Evening - DMT, then LSD<br />Day 3: Morning - Alcohol/Weed/MDMA (breakfast of champions). Afternoon - more MDMA/Alcohol/Weed. Evening - Coke/Heroin for the drive home, then pop a xanax and hit the deck.<br /><br />Man I am so fucking impossibly psyched right now<br />
