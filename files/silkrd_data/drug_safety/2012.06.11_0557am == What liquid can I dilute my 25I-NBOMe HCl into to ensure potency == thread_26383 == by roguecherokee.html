				What up, Silk Road? I should be receiving about 10mg of 251-NBOMe Hydrogen-chloride within the next three days, and I plan on diluting it in a 10ml solution. The problem stems from my supplier telling me that I can only dilute the compound in an alcohol with a proof higher than 100, which is not available in my area. I had originally planned on dropping it in some distilled water, but my supplier had told me that this was a no go. Apparently Isopropyl Acohol is also out of the question. So I guess I&#039;m wondering whether or not he&#039;s telling the truth, as I&#039;ve heard of people dropping their 2C&#039;s in orange juice, and seeing as 25I is simply a derivative of 2C-I, I question why this wouldn&#039;t work. Is the chemical not soluble in most liquids, or what?

				If it&#039;s 25i-NBOMe-HCl, then it is water soluble.<br /><br />sdesu

				yes, i have heard of people having difficulty getting 25i to dissolve in water but i think below 5 mg/ml it is certainly possible<br /><br />i would suggest just using as high proof alcohol as possible.&nbsp; should be fine but may take some agitation <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know if this applies to your purchase but if you look around online you will notice that a lot of clearnet vendors have been sold (and subsequently resold) this chemical in freebase form but were told (by the chemists) that it was HCL. which has lead to some confusion on its solubility.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t dissolve with relative ease in water than you have it in it&#039;s freebase form. Just add a couple of drops of lemon juice or vinegar to turn it into its citrate/acetate forms and it should dissolve with some stirring.

				Thanks for the info. So if it turns out to be freebase, I guess railing it won&#039;t be an option either? :-\

				If you mean snorting it then you should still be able to and I actually think that that is where the confusion originated because IIRC the freebase has alot of the same bio-availability values as the salts.<br /><br />if for some reason it doesn&#039;t work nasally you could always mix it with a drop or two of lemon juice or vinegar on a glass plate at let it evaporate. that should be sufficient to create the appropriate salt.

				Awesome. Can&#039;t wait to try this shit out, I&#039;ve heard nothing but good things.

				I&#039;ve still got about 25 mg left in a liquid solution and I must say, it is the closest RC that I have found to LSD. with the exception of the tolerance issues and ROA bio-availability differences, its effect profile is almost identical IMHO.
