				From my experience and small amount of research, it doesn&#039;t last as long. People try to make all these statements about definite differences but everybody is different, plus, the batches are different so keep that in mind

				I am interested in this too.<br /><br />I have taken MDMA before, would I notice a difference if I took methylone instead?<br /><br />Also, can methylone kill you or is it pretty safe?

				methylone is a cheaper alternative to mdma, it can be considered mdma-lite having similar effects but with roughly 60% potency.

				i personally really enjoy methylone <br />it has similar feelings to mdma <br />everything feels soft<br />your emotions are similar to mdma but for me they feel more honest where its <br />easy for you to talk and express your feelings all out to somebody<br />with mdma i just get completely floored and become quite useless <br /><br />methylone is fantastic with mushrooms / 2ci / n2o <br />also its amazing to smoke synthetic cannabinoids on methylone<br /><br />i for one really like it. i never had a crash on it<br />sometimes its just hard to sleep. <br />have done doses from 160-220mg sweetspot somewhere 180mg<br />ive done 3 200mg in 3 hours interval and it was fine<br /><br />i suggest you try it if thats what youre looking for :)

				Well having some vast exper with this.. <br /><br />1st most people in the US are being sold the M1 Methylone as real MDMA in capsules and pills.&nbsp; Really ravers know the difference..<br /><br />Tests Yellow M1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;---&nbsp; cheap shiz<br />Tests Black&nbsp; MDMA &lt;--- good shiz<br /><br />New vendors needs to post a marcus test because more people wont know the difference.&nbsp; 220-250 meg is equal 150-180 of a MDMA...&nbsp; <br /><br />The come down is not as hard, but if you dose up.. Your gonna be wrecked...<br /><br />Some people love ether one or the other...&nbsp; I wouldnt sell M1 like real MDMA.. <br /><br />Its cheaper for a reason and sell it as such...<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I find it to be very similar to MDMA, some people say it lacks the magic of MDMA but I struggle to find much difference and I&#039;ve tried MDMA and Methylone plenty of times.

				I noticed you said you&#039;re giving it to the dealers. I have done the same thing and they don&#039;t know a difference, in fact what gave me the idea was them saying it was the best &quot;molly&quot; they ever had when I let them try a sample. If you know for a fact they will use a test kit then sell it as m1 if not then sell it as molly.

				I can always tell the the difference between the two, but then I have never done more than 225 mgs in one sitting. I find it much more energetic and clear headed, at moments I do feel the MDMA softness but not nearly as mashy as MDMA can get for me.

				I&#039;m just trying to give the OP some advice based on my experiences. I am in no trying to be deceptive or dishonest. Just sell as molly and they mdma price, otherwise be specific and sell at m1 price, either way everyone&#039;s happen.

				I don&#039;t sell MDMA on the road only methylone. As anyone can see by my prices they are nowhere near MDMA prices and are also the cheapest methylone prices on the road.
