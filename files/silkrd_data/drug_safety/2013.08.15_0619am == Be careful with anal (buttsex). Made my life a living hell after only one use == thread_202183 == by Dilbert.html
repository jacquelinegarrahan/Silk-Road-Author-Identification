				Difficult to be serious after seeing &#039;salable commodity&#039;<br />You could say those damn carpenters making my life a living hell, cause they consider working a &#039;salable commodity&#039;. <br />If I make a mistake, shit cut the wood over make it longer or cut a little off. Get mad rip&nbsp; the wood off. This doesn&#039;t work in medical world. They are more serious about mistakes. <br />If you think medical should be free ideally everything &#039;should&#039; be free. And the bastards charge more for the meat that&#039;s not ground up into patty, just straight meat that&#039;s not too tough and tastes good. Go on and on. <br />Had to laugh, Dilbert, they charge $48,000 for a bleeding asshole? I only would have charged $1000 maximum. What else don&#039;t you like, cops and bills and taxes?<br />Oughta be a law.

				Shit, fuck cancer. I&#039;d be pissed if they cut off my leg because they made more money cutting off than trying to save it. Leader of the free world said that doctors do that, cut off perfectly good legs. But he also said that if I liked my health plan, I could keep my health plan, period.

((You could even let it dry out for WEEKS MONTH YEARS and rehydrate it at some point, it will work.))<br /><br />I made 5L out of more than a half of a 294g bottle once in a big high cooking pot for asparagus. <br /><br />Use a 600w mixer (hand blender) and a container that fits the size of it (500ml) then put water in it, you can add food coloring and substances (beware) if you want to. I personally use bottled water (vittel) because i think the results are the best, it also has a little chloride so that will help with conservation. Our city water is very &quot;hard&quot; and calcareous, vittel is round and smooth as the final result should be anyway. You can also add 5-10% regular lube with preservation compounds in it, that will make it last longer. I would strongly advice against it, in my opinion it contaminates the j-lube with unneeded chemicals. It stays fresh for 2-3 weeks no problem in my containers. After 2 months you could surely use it still if you wanted to.<br />Or just make J-Cube&#039;s ;D It&#039;s perfect for freezing.<br /><br />Always let your j-lube sit/rest for about 24h++ as the bubbles will go out, even the really tiny one&#039;s after a time. The picky about the product will do so. ;)<br /><br />It&#039;s really the most awesome substance on the planet, once there was LOADS of crisco and it was fine. I thought crisco = BEST THING EVAR but oh i was wrong. The simplicity of j-lube makes it so good, just 2 compounds in a romantic kiss kiss. brrr!<br /><br />HURRA!
