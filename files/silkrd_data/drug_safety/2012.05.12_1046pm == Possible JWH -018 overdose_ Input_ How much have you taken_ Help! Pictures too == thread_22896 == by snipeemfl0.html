				To start, what I dosed last night<br /><br />T-0:00=Smoked ~.15g of hash<br />T-0:30=Oral ~70mg of JWH-018<br />T-1:00=Tab ~ 1mg of 25i-Nbome<br />T-7:00=Pill - 2mg of xanax to sleep<br /><br />Now, the reason why I took JWH-018 is because I THOUGHT it was MXE. I&#039;ve dosed MXE before 4 times, and never had a problem. But, this time I ordered it from buy-jwh.com. They accidentally sent me JWH-018. It looked EXACTLY like MXE, even kinda felt like it. The 25i-NBOME stopped me from going through what would have been a 100% terrible trip. <br /><br />The trip was actually fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;But now, this morning, I felt a little weird, but full of energy. I made a nice healthy breakfast, and about 30 minutes later, feeling dizzy. Projectile vomited a shitload of food. Felt a little better, but still am dizzy when I walk. <br /><br /><br />What do you think I could do? Just sleep? I&#039;ve eaten saltine crackers 20 minutes ago, there staying down... for now...<br /><br /><br />Is there any long/permanent damage I could have sustained? Or will a good diet/exercise/sleep help me get through it in a few days?<br /><br />Any one want a gram of JWH-018... So fucking done with this shit.

				Ouch dude, I was gonna say, why the fuck are you taking oral JWH o_O Smoking that shit is bad enough. <br /><br />What did taking the 25i do? Did you get uber fucked up?<br /><br />I&#039;m always a strong advocate that good diet, exercise, sleep and water will help you feel better for anything...

				Honestly, 25i helped me because the stimulation from setatonin and dopamine helped me get off the bodyload from the JWH-018<br /><br />Happy to report, after about 12 hours of sleep and a quick 20 minute workout, with some excedrine, anti-nausea medication (bellodana, prescrip from doc, fucking kills nausea!), 5-HTP, multivitamen, cold shower, and eating slow and keeping full, I feel a 100% better. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m relaxing and trying to get some marketing work done. <br /><br />Thank god this stuff was forgiving. I hope this helps other people, pay close attention to what you receive. ALWAYS HAVE BENZOS!

				I am not sure about oral dosage of JWH-018, but normal vaped dosage of pure powder is 2-5mg. I had a panic attack/lost consciousness on ~7mg. I don&#039;t believe that was JWH-018. In fact, it sounds like you did a big dose of MXE (&quot;But now, this morning, I felt a little weird, but full of energy. I made a nice healthy breakfast, and about 30 minutes later, feeling dizzy.

Still feel like shit now, I woke up at 2am and have been feeling like shit. Haven&#039;t vomited though, yet...<br /><br />I still feel my heart beat, I&#039;ve been taking supplements I usually take when weight bulking, to stop nausea and maybe some muscle cramps. The thing that really worries me is my heartbeat. Its around 80bmp resting, but I feel it alot. I feel it in my neck, arms, legs, ect. Maybe its from taking 25i and vascoconstriculation. Also have a sore throat, but maybe I&#039;m just sick lol<br /><br />I&#039;m going to go back to watching TV before I have a panic attack haha

				Wow.... This is the second post I&#039;ve read about someone getting sent the wrong chemical and having a nasty time, I&#039;m just glad that my test pilot days are long gone! Research chemicals didn&#039;t exist, nor did the net for that matter, it was just a choice of more healthy drugs like acid, (coke, heroin ha ha ha!), speed, or good strong hash. If you wanted to be a test pilot you just kept gobbling down tabs of acid combined with a line or two of&nbsp; phet- great combination for astral projection. I&#039;m sort of glad too, because I&#039;d of been right into the research c&#039;s back then!

				Anyone else have any input, information, or advise? My muscle cramps in my legs, arms, pecks, neck, and this massive headache worries me. I&#039;m going to go to the doctor wednesday if there are no noticeable improvements.

				What you got probably wasn&#039;t JWH-018. Maybe MXE, maybe another JWH substance or something third, but unlikely 018. 70mg would have been an alarmingly dissociating dose. I know of a guy with 20 years of cannabis experience and lots of other drugs who took 45mg of JWH-018 smoked. He ended up in a completely demented state, powerless to control his actions or comprehend what he&#039;s doing. His wife ended up calling emergency services and they needed 4 people to strap him down and get him immobilized. We&#039;re talking complete loss of self awareness. He did this while his children were in the house, who witnessed pretty much the whole ordeal.<br /><br />JWH-018 is a very unforgiving substance to overdose on.
