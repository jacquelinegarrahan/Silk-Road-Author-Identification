				If&nbsp; its not a private methadone clinic, most likely the intake process can take weeks or even months. I have heard private clinics are a lot easier to get into, but you pay for that... When&nbsp; a close friend was in a similar situation, the clinic counselor actually told him to score whatever he needed until he could do the intake. Crazy,huh?<br /><br />I know that there are a couple people selling methadone pills on Sr market, i think, you might want to hit them up, but for your situation, methadone or suboxone is the best bet, last the longest, but make sure you are off the subs before your intake.<br /><br />This is a tough spot, in a pinch, go get a ton of lopedermine, and when they say take 4 take 10 wait and then take more as needed. that should take the edge off, also if you can get clonodine, that will help. if you are sick and have no options, then go to the ER, they will give you lope, clonodine and trazadone and maybe some xanax.. but, then its in your records..<br /><br />Go easy on what you have until you know what and when you are going to do it....I have had methadone last me 3-4 days before WD came back.... <br /><br />&nbsp;But remember, methadone is much more difficult to come off of than pain killlers, etc. instead of weaning over a couple weeks, methadone can take months or more. same with subs... so, you may want to get on a fast acting opiate and taper yourself with some friends help (to control it and monitor you). take plenty of fluids......

				Methadone is a great high and long in duration in my view but indeed they along with suboxone make coming off Oxycontin look like having Twinkies withdraws.<br /><br />Anyone can go to a methadone clinic as far as I know. I know people that go and when those doors open there is a line a mile long of people there just to get legally high. Most of them anyways and I almost dare say all cause if someone truly wanted to get off drugs with methadone or subs they would use them a few weeks to get through the god awful suffering and then stop all together. Trading one addiction for another is no different than borrowing from one hand to pay another.<br /><br />They do not even follow guidelines. All they want is your money. some where along the lines of $120.00 US dollars a week, I know people who have gone and still go for years and fail their drug screen every time. They get a speech and a try and do better see you later response.&nbsp; The only drug they will put you out for is benzos cause mixed with methadone in certain doses and that varies per person can and will kill a person.<br /><br />Drugs can be a friend or enemy to you new users&nbsp; and it is good you have a place or found this place to get safety advice. Do not mix certain drugs and do not do any pills before researching the identity online. Do not trust a friend who knows you do 5mg tabs and&nbsp; hands you a 80mg Oxy or some fentynal&nbsp; and says&nbsp; &quot;take this I HEARD it&#039;s awesome shit&quot;&nbsp; sure it may be awesome shit to a tolerant user but to a non one it is deadly shit. <br /><br />Know what you are&nbsp; taking and how much and only trust those who have never betrayed your trust cause if they did it once for any reason they will do it again for ANY REASON if it suits them. Few people are left in this world that puts more faith in a hand shake than they do a contract and my moto is<br /><br />&quot;Contracts were written to be broken but a handshake is the law of god&quot;<br /><br />Value your word and your hand shake /reputation more than anything else to all you 17 18 yr olds cause it is the one thing in life that once you lose you&nbsp; can never get back. For even if someone gives you a 2nd chance and trust you they still in their mind&nbsp; have that suspicion and doubt of your moral identity . May sound stupid to you now&nbsp; but one day you will know what I am talking about.<br /><br />For the adults I never preach to or ask another to adhere to my thoughts or way of life but I do kindly offer advice and recommendations in the most humble of ways. I would would use the methadone clinic if you want to kick your addictions and after a few weeks kick the methadone clinic for if you do not you will just be adding one more addiction to your list.<br /><br />Unless you just go to save money and get high lol. Cause if your habit of roxy or oc is costing you 400 a week or more you can get the same buzz&nbsp; up to 120mgs a dose a day I believe for 120.00 dollars a week if I recall.<br /><br />Best of luck and stay well&nbsp;

				perhaos my experience with methadone clinics have been different than yours. I can say first hand going there with others&nbsp; that yes they do have a dr take blood and examine you and see you and you must see a counsler&nbsp; once a week but they DO NOT UPHOLD their drug policy of kicking you out if you test positive for other drugs.&nbsp; EXCEPT BENZOS&nbsp; &nbsp;this I know for a FACT!<br /><br />but what is a fact based on my experience and interactions might diffeer from yours no different than a pizza from pizza hut&nbsp; by yor store might look and taste a bit different than one from my own.<br /><br />

				methadone clinics have no policy of kicking people out of the program for testing positive for drugs other than benzos.&nbsp; what would be the point of a program to help addicts if they got kicked out the first time they slipped up.....like an addict?&nbsp; it would help no one.<br /><br />also, the idea of using methadone just for a few weeks is fucking pointless.&nbsp; you&#039;d be better off just coming off of whatever opiate you were on to begin with.&nbsp; the point of methadone is to stabilize people enough so that they can keep their lives from falling apart.&nbsp; yes, it may be another addiction, but most people can easily do things like keep a job, not steal from their friends, show up to their obligations, etc. while participating in a methadone clinic program.<br /><br />and, your only rebuttal is that you&#039;re right because they only kick people out for using benzos, which can be deadly when mixed with methadone?&nbsp; were you homeschooled by a janitor or something?
