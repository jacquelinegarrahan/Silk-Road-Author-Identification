				You should try MDPV when you fuck someone. It is awesome. It is better than the fuckwits and hipsters make it look and infinitely better with smaller doses than large ones.<br /><br />I find I can be incredibly focused and do things I find otherwise mundane.

				I would suggest 4-FA, MXE, Etizolam and MDA. In my opinion all of those offer something a bit different from what you&#039;ve experienced before.

				MUSHROOMS<br /><br />trust me,I&#039;m convinced it is impossible to have a bad trip on mushrooms<br /><br />i&#039;m also convinced I need to read more carefully<br /><br />Second try: idk you&#039;ve covered pretty much all the big non-research chemical drugs<br /><br />Klonopins are pretty chill, some like them better than xanax

				Maybe ayahuasca/pharmahuasca? Mescaline is also noteworthy. And psychedelics + N2O can be very interesting :)

				So you want a new drug? One that won&#039;t make you sick, crash your car or make you feel three feet thick?<br /><br />One that won&#039;t spill, cost too much or come in a pill?<br /><br />One that essentially does what it should, one that won&#039;t make you feel too bad, one that won&#039;t make you feel too good?<br /><br />I deserve to be flamed for this and I deserve all the negative karma anyone wants to throw at me but hey, I couldn&#039;t help myself. Huey Lewis still kicks ass.

				again, thanks a lot guys, great suggestions, I will try some(or all hehe) of the drugs you listed over the next months, it&#039;s always nice to experience new highs.<br /><br /><br />losing your &#039;virginity&#039; to a drug is so unique, descriptions on Erowid are a nice overview, but no words can ever express the feeling you get on a certain drug, not even remotely, you need to have it felt yourself to understand ;)<br /><br />&lt;3<br /><br />damn i love this community, so much more constructive than any of the drug forums on the clearnet!

				If you want to try a new benzo, I recommend Zolpidem!<br /><br />You&#039;ve taken benzo&#039;s before so I&#039;d suggest taking 20mg.<br /><br />ENJOY!!

Amazing drug combo and not hard on your body, just dont sit their doing NOS for hours as it can drain your B12 levels and make sure you are sitting or laying down. <br /><br />Stay away from opiates (heroin) or crack or meth. Lifelong addiction is not a cool thing.

				mescaline and methoxetamine are both worth trying. nitrous is great as well, especially when mixed with psychedelics (same goes for ketamine). try ayahuasca if you&#039;re serious about psychedelics and want to have a deeper connection with the earth. :)
