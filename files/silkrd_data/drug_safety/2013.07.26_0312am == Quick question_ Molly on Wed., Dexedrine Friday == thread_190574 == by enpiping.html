				I&#039;ve been trying to be a bit more careful with my drug use recently (dosages and frequently), particularly with MDMA.&nbsp; I usually only do it about once a month, especially after reading about neurotoxicity and after noticing some negative effects when using it a bit more frequently a few months ago, but that&#039;s not really what I&#039;m asking about.&nbsp; I did MDMA on Wednesday (a fair amount, but nothing too ridiculous) and was wondering if taking a 10mg Dexedrine tomorrow will have any neurotoxic-type issues? If it would, how long should I wait?&nbsp; I ask because I need to put in a pretty solid day of research-based work, and would like to use Dex to help, but I won&#039;t bother if there&#039;s a risk involved.<br />Thanks a lot.&nbsp; :)

				hi buddy,<br /><br />do you want me to be honest? who knows. One of the major concerns about all the studies done in mice/rats about mdma toxicity is the dosing regime and the biology. The studies made by that guy in the fda with the monkeys, where he misplaced methamphetamine for mdma by mistake, and he was able to published in science, was just a bad joke.<br />So about your concern, I will say, do you need that dexedrine? Are you sure you just can not go on coffee? if not, can you just take half of the dose and see how it goes? I am saying that because it seems that you are a person that is used to those 10 mg of dexedrine and will feel anything off just taking 5 mg.<br /><br />good luck with your research!<br /><br />usalchemy<br /><br />

				hey<br />Its nice to see drug people who actually care about themselves. <br />I think the problem you could encounter is &quot;more stimulation than you expect&quot; because of the lingering mdma effects. <br />this could cause anxiety, paranoia etc. maybe even send your concentration out of the window and scatter your brain a little. <br />
