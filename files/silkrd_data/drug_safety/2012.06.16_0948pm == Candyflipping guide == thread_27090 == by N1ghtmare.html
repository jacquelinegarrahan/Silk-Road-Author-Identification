				Greetings, fellow psychonauts.<br /><br />I have SKYY&#039;s MDMA and VitaCats acid and desire to candyflip.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I, being the responsible safe type that I am, would first like to ask some of the more experienced users about what should the dosages of each drug be and the time intervals between their ingestion.<br /><br />Oh, and the setting for the candyflip will be an acid rock concert.<br /><br />Yes, I have tried both LSD and MDMA separately. Quite experienced with them.

				I don&#039;t mean to be rude, but you can easily answer this yourself.&nbsp; This has been discussed many times on many different public forums.&nbsp; I am all for becoming more knowledgeable on drug use, but there crosses a certain point when you really should be searching yourself instead of search polluting the forums.&nbsp; If it&#039;s a moderately difficult question to answer (ie are there drug interactions between these two uncommon drugs) or a specific question, go ahead and ask.&nbsp; But a simple search should answer your question for you in this case.&nbsp; <br /><br />*search pollution:&nbsp; when so many people are asking trivial questions on topics that have already been answered that it is hard to find real information

				I haven&#039;t done it, but I&#039;d definitely take my normal dose of each drug. Also I&#039;m fairly sure you have to stagger the dosage so that the peak of both drugs coincides. I don&#039;t remember which you take first or how long to leave between them, but I&#039;m sure the answer could be found with a quick google search.
