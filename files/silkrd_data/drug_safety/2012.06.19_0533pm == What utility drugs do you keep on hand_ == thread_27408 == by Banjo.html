				What non-recreational drugs do you keep on hand? (Aside from first-aid type stuff, and OTC pain killers)<br /><br />I keep:<br />Viagra for when I want to have sex on MDMA or methylone<br />Valium or Xanax for going to sleep after stimulant drugs<br />A few vials of epinephrine in case of severe allergic reaction to something<br />Hydrocortisone injection that I inject along with opiates. Really helps the itch, and the occasional skin reaction I get at the injection site<br />Atropine and naloxone in case of IV opiate overdose (I&#039;m really careful, and have never come close to ODing, but it&#039;s good to have on hand)

				Viagra for the same reason you stated.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would keep antipsychotics to kill intense trips. And benzos to numb them.<br /><br />$edit$ I&#039;ve never had a bad trip, but some of my friends have.&nbsp; dumb asses!

				I never keep any utility drugs on hand. I usually just ride it out until the end. <br />Thankfully I&#039;ve never had a bad trip before, but my dog has always been there just in case&nbsp; :P.<br /><br />sdesu

				I always keep some medication at hand in case something unexpected happens. Including:<br /><br />- antihistamines (cetirizine, diphenhydramide) due to allergy to insect stings<br />- paracetamol/naproxen/tramadol in case of pain due to injury or something like that<br />- xanax/valium as a general tranq<br />- loperamide in case of shit (literal)<br /><br />Also some caffeine powder in case i do need a mild boost - a mug of triple caffeine coffee can do miracles in the morning ;)<br />

				Diphenhydramine for anxiety, nausea, sedation, allergies... it helps with body load during trips a lot, and it reduces jitters on stimulants.<br />Ondansetron for heavy nausea.<br />Xanax or another benzo for bad trips (mostly for other people nowadays).<br />Various stimulants to combat narcolepsy or to do homework (adderall, concerta, modafinil, mdpv, speed, whatever I can get my hands on).<br />MXE and weed for antidepressants, MXE for a party lubricant.<br />And I like to keep Tryptamine&#039;s supplements on hand. They&#039;re often useful.

				Hehe...I keep a bible so when my friends trips turn bad I can hand it to them and tell them to pray to god before he smites them straight to hell for their horrible sins! Then I laugh a thick guttural maniacal laugh and start foaming at that mouth while I shake my body violently around the floor like a fish gasping for air. It hasn&#039;t helped yet but I&#039;ll keep trying. :-\

				I&#039;m not 100% sure on what the thread-bumping rules are here, but this is a good thread that I thought I&#039;d add to:<br />my oh shit kit:<br />a benzo<br />ondansetron (vomiting just isn&#039;t healthy and I don&#039;t recommend it if it can be avoided for just a few EUR)<br />loperamide<br />dick stim (never again will I be without these, that missed opportunity taught me well)<br />oral rehydration salts (electrolyte imbalances are bad, and sports drinks are crappy at replenishment, your mom is right, they&#039;re all sugar)<br /><br />In my opinion, diphenhydramine doesn&#039;t work, not for me anyway.<br /><br />What I&#039;d like to add to the kit:<br />Ventolin/albuterol inhaler<br />epinephrine vials (the auto-injectors are really expensive and mine is expired)<br />nitro glycerin spray (the kind that heart patients use in case of chest pains, don&#039;t take with dick stims, go to hospital if not immediately effective)<br />cyproheptadine (in case of m overdo)<br />activated charcoal (why not, it should be cheap)<br />some type of antipsychotic for nausea, agitation and/or unwelcome hallucinations

				I read it as drugs that are a good idea to have on hand in case of adverse effects from the usual drugs that are sold on the silk road. Things that you wish you had after the fact, when waiting a week for them to come in really wasn&#039;t an option. I&#039;ve made a few notes.<br /><br />In my opinion, some of them are more difficult to acquire than they should be, especially from a harm reduction point of view, even though they&#039;re usually legal.

				My buddy doesn&#039;t have insurance and he has asthma so I got him like 20 inhalers from India from a hundred bucks so i feel pretty good karma wise. Just for doomsday purposes I want some hydroxyzine, inhalers, doxycycline, soma, seroquel, temazepam, nitrazepam, phenobarbital, adrenaline ampules, syringes, goats.. some sort of pain killer. Opium? Some speed? Zombie guns. Lots of ammunition and canned goods.

				Just Xanax, for if I ever need to kill a trip before it&#039;s run its course. I&#039;ve not yet needed it for that, though. I also use it for general anxiety, but that&#039;s only rarely.
