				Alright, I smoke weed regularly, take some xanax bars every now and again, and drink.<br /><br />Exciting, I know.<br /><br />As the title said, I&#039;m looking to expand my horizons, and try something new. :) <br /><br />What would you guys recommend for a &quot;Holy shit I&#039;m high, hehe&quot; kinda high.? Relaxed is what I&#039;m going for, but shit, LF, DY, LABC right? So, what does the SR recommend for me? I&#039;m pretty much open to anything. But if it involves needles, ahhhh, id rather not.

				I find pure MDMA to be extremely euphoric and also quite relaxing. If you want something trippy, I recommend 2c-b. If you&#039;re after the ultimate in relaxation and euphoria I&#039;d go for opiates but as you&#039;d know they can also be extremely addictive.

				Well the question almost seems taylor made for opiates because you are not after a psychedelic trip and you already have tried benzos. I would hate to see you get addicted to opiates so I&#039;m trying to think of other things for you to try. Ummm... Have you ever tried any muscle relaxers, soma perhaps? Maybe try some different benzos, like Klonopin which I find much better than xanax. Not to be a presumptuous asshole, but you seem like you&#039;re fairly young. Try you&#039;re best to avoid opiates if you can, I&#039;m sure you know the stigma that surrounds them.

				Ketamine could be shot. It doesn&#039;t last long, so if it&#039;s not your thing you don&#039;t have to ride it out for hours. You definitely know when it hits you. I know I was like daaaaaaaamnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ;)

				If you want to keep things light, try out some kratom. It&#039;s legal in most countries, cheap, and effective. It&#039;s basically a plant that works on your opiate receptors (not a true opiate though). I find it far less addictive than my experience with weed and alcohol. It relaxes you, gives energy and many people, myself included experience euphoria.

				I was actually considering selling some cheap, homemade kratom extracts and tinctures to throw up on SR to see how well they sell. I could sell it all much cheaper than typical online vendors who markup products to a ridiculously high price.<br /><br />I will soon be gauging interest on the forums here and even with a bit of interest, I will have some products and samples ready for us all&nbsp; :D

But first I believe a few that would expand your perspective on psychoactive chemicals are as follows; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First, MDMA Is a great drug and one of my favorites, a usual dose of around 150mg-200mg sends me into a very mellow euphoria. It&#039;s a great ego softener and is fun to do with friends, it really tears down pride and bonds people together. Some of my closest friends have become so do to MDMA experiences.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second, Acid is a real mind bender, it can change your whole personality and train of thought if taken excessively. Yet, It gave me a deeper understanding and appreciation of all life and really put drugs in a perspective for me, at least, as far as psychedelics are concerned. Highly advised.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Last, Shrooms are an awesome trip, it also has the ability to soften the ego, yet the trip is much more intense, Ive only ever experienced slight visual hallucinations. It is good to do with someone experienced whom you are close to, it makes the trip much less likely to go bad.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for your relaxation highs it sounds like opiates would be your key, as previously mentioned by another user they have the possibility of dependency. I would suggest taking it light and pacing yourself out. Oxycontin was a powerful, yet smooth and relaxing high. I use to smoke it, really sweet burning pharmaceutic taste. VERY ADDICTING, its called synthetic heroin for a reason. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My favorite opiate to date though is opium tar, king of the opiates. I haven&#039;t had enough experience with it though to talk with confidence on its effects.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyways, hope this has been helpful in some way and happy trails!

				A low dose of good LSD is very relaxing and enjoyable.<br /><br />A couple of vicodins (10 mg or so) along with some weed once they kick in is very pleasurable for someone with no tolerance, but word of caution opiates used frequently can lead to addiction. You won&#039;t have a withdraw from a one time vicodin, but you may like the feeling and not see the big deal and start abusing frequently then you will see the big deal after it is too late. Just a word of warning from an ex-heroin addict.<br /><br />Valium is nice, and it is a more mild benzo, and the only one I can take and feel confident I am not going to do something I will regret. Xanax, Ativan, and sometime Klonopins have strong effect on me, and I don&#039;t know why. Low dosing is the key with benzos or you may wake up in jail (which I personally did and stayed there for 60 days for something I couldn&#039;t even remember)<br /><br />I would stay away from stimulants in general if relaxing is what you want. The things that give you the &quot;Holy shit&quot; feeling are usually very addictive, but if I will list some of my favorites, but always research whatever new drug you ingest before you do so, and get all the facts so you can make your own assessment on whether you want that chemical in your body.<br /><br />Good crack is like a euphoric blast off that leaves your mouth wide open, and you sit there and think &quot;Wow&quot; it also has a quick come down and you want another hit 15-20 minutes after.<br /><br />Shrooms aren&#039;t addictive and are very safe. They give you a definite high feeling and make you laugh your ass off uncontrollably. I would say a good dose for a first timer is 2.5 grams. I at 3.5 for my first time and thoroughly enjoyed it, but this is overwhelming for some people I guess.<br /><br />Good meth provides a lot of euphoria, but not a fucked up feeling just a really good clear up feeling and like you want to tackle the world. It also releases a shitload of seratonin which isn&#039;t too healthy if done frequently, and is mentally addicting especially for some people who can&#039;t function without it. <br /><br />Cocaine is nice if it is really high quality, but doesn&#039;t provide a real fucked up feeling unless you do a bunch at once. It is good for sitting around shooting the shit with buddies, and feeling so open with them talking about old stories about back in the day over and over again the whole night. It is really euphoric and is addicing, but not (in my personal experience) as addicting as crack or meth. The better the coke the less harsh come down and less frequent redosing which diminishes the mental addictiveness in my experience.<br /><br />

				Very good information. I genuinely thank you. Meth and cocaine are two that I really want to try, just not right now. And with some friends. Xanax and weed are my favorite, and currently only, combo. <br /><br /><br />simplys &#039;to do&#039; list:<br />Cocaine [_]<br />Meth [_]<br />Marijuana [X]<br />Ketamine [_]<br />Xanax [X]<br />MDMA [_]<br />LSD/Strong psychedelic [_]<br /><br />Not necessarily in that order.

				If you try shrooms here are some of my personal suggestions being a seasoned shroomer.<br /><br />The mind set you are in is key to your trip. Make sure you take it on a day where you are happy and feel good about life. Your mental state before your trip is like a road map for your trip and a key to making the most out of it. I suggest 30 minutes before eating relaxing and focus on what you want to get out of the trip and clear your head, think about what a good time you are in for, and your personal trip goals. Meditatation or yoga help relax your mind and body.<br /><br />Setting is a very very big key factor. Choose a place you are familiar and very comfortable in that will also provide no unwanted interruptions or chances of negative outside influences barging in on your experience. I personally like my basement where I sleep and spend most of my free time and do it at night when I always feel most comfortable, but tripping in nature is awesome too, not something I would really recomend for a first timer.<br /><br />Familiarity is a key for me when I trip. Listen to music you regulary listen to or movies that spark good memories that you have watched a lot (I always like Disney movves, because it brings the childhood magic and nostalgia into the trip) <br /><br />Some people recommend tripping with someone or having a sitter, and really I personally don&#039;t advise this, because it is weird being in an altered state and having someone not sitting there watching you like you are some animal at a zoo (that is what I felt they were thinking) I personally love to be all by myself and low lights.<br /><br />If you are looking for a really spiritual type of journey then trip in complete darkness and silence. You will never believe how loud and vibrant pitch black and no noise can :) Absolutely stunning! Definitely take time to meditate and think about the trip you are going to embark on before hand if you do this, and a stronger dose you will not regret. Probably trip a few times before doing one of these to get a feel, but if you want a life changing experience this will provide it, at the very minimum a top memory of your life.<br /><br /><br />As far as dosage is concerned everyone says start smaller 2 grams 2.5 grams, and that is good advice I guess to be cautious, but I whole heartidly believe that if you take the measurements I laid out it is better to do 3 or 3.5 grams to get an awesome experience. Terrence McKenna also always recommended dosing higher and less frequently for shroomers. So instead of tripping on 2 grams every month eat 3-5 and do it every 3-4 months. You will take a lot more from each trip and each one will be more personalized.<br /><br />You should eat a light meal before you eat the shrooms, because some people get nauseous (I never do) and stomach cramps on the come up (have experienced those) I would eat a sandwich about 20 minutes before, but don&#039;t get full just enough to coat your stomach. While eating your shrooms drink plenty of liquid either juice or water and even if you don&#039;t like the taste chewing them up or grinding them slightly eases up on chance of stomach discomfort.<br /><br />If by some how you start becoming overwhelmed in your trip first remember that it is a harmless substance, and only lasts a few hours. Next Sing! Pick a song any song you like and start singing it in your head. This provides a distraction and brings familiarity to your mind and puts it at ease.<br /><br />I have ate a lot of shrooms lol
