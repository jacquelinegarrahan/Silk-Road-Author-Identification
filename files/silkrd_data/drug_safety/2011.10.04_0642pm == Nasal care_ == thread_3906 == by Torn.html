				So what&#039;s the sage advice for nasal care?<br /><br />I use a Neti Pot with a warm, mild saline wash made from filtered water before going to bed at night if I&#039;ve done anything during the day.<br /><br />

				From my experiences the Neti Pot is the best thing you can do for your nose, other than avoiding pills/powers heavy with filler. There was a time when all I could get were 5mg percs, and I&#039;d snort up to 16 a day. That is an absolutely disgusting pile of binders and acetaminophen, and use of the Neti Pot 3+ times a day with warm, salinated water kept my septum from eating itself.

				Pill, Thanks. <br /><br />I&#039;ve started using a few hours after almost all uses now. It really got me back to mostly normal in no time after I got a particularly stinging batch.<br /><br />Nose sprays eventually just make things worse and none of the putting Vaseline/mineral oil/etc up my nose ever worked even for minor non-drug related issues.<br /><br />One note about the Neti Pot: ALWAYS start with filtered water. There is a kind of amoeba that can be in tap water that if it gets into your nasal passages, can be bad (bad == you might die) . There was a report of it happening at least once so ever since, the blanket recommendation for Neti Pot is to start with filtered water only and then add the salt and then go for it. Google can tell you all about it.

				Never used a neti pot, but if you carefully snort a small palmfull of water it has a similar effect, of course be careful not to inhale it fully heh<br />Also the finer the powder the better, grind it up really good, i use either a sharp blade or mortar and pestle depending on what it is. Keep it dry too, I threw a few silica gel packs into my stash box and the powder stays powder not chunks that will chemical burn your nasal cavity. <br />Also don&#039;t blow your nose like mad if it feels stuffed up, that&#039;s part of snorting stuff, its annoying but gotta get used to it, you&#039;re just going to make any damage worse if you keep blowing and blowing. Get in a steamy shower and then give it a good blow at the end it will feel much better.

				Saline nose spray... just what I fucking needed. Neti pot is amazing, but I think the saline spray&#039;s ability to hit exactly where inhaled power also hits makes it a great addition. &quot;Ocean&quot; brand is what I got, but I&#039;d expect the generic version to be just as good. It&#039;s just saline spray, no nasal passage opening additives which are always to be avoided.

				General rule of thumb for me is to snort up a tiny bit of water on my fingertips maybe 20-30 minutes after doing a decent line, then at the end or midway through a night&#039;s session using generic Saline Solution (with identical ingredients to Ocean&#039;s) to really clean it out.&nbsp; This works amazingly and I can go to sleep with an oh-so-fresh and clean nose.&nbsp; Next day is just a bit of a runny nose here and there but its really unnoticeable throughout the day.

				Worst stuff I have put up my nose has been Mephedrone in marathons 2-3 days long.&nbsp; I almost enjoyed the burn like doing a nasal shot of tequila.&nbsp; I used this stuff called Neil Rinse that is like a Neti Pot but you dissolve saline solution into a squirt bottle.&nbsp; About a week later, all the nasties will be gone from your sinuses.

				This is why I love this forum :)&nbsp; I did not think about nasal care and just deal with the stuffy and runny nose. I will be buying some saline solution this week. Thanks all!!
