				Ok, so I am going to do some MDMA tonight before going to the club. Beforehand I will be watching the UFC fights with some friends. I&#039;m definitely not going to drink a lot, but would it be a bad idea to just drink a beer or two while watching the fights, before taking the MDMA. I&#039;m not talking about dehydration as I will definitely drink enough water, I&#039;m talking about will it affect my roll negatively?

				1 or 2 beers wont do anything but if you get drunk you wont peak on your roll and it will take away from it. Drinking is better after your roll to help bring you down

				thats wthat I&#039;m wondering about too...<br />so how exactly is the best way to do it? my idea of my night is, have some champagne in the early evening...maybe some shandy (you know, beer with lemonade), then take the MDMA and then some more shandy maybe....so alcohol in general brings you down? and somewhere else I read, don&#039;t drink too much water neither....so any tipps for having a great night but with drinking sth as well? ;)

				First time I took Ivory, probably only around 100mg. I&#039;d been drinking a lot before hand. Anyway I peaked like a mother fucker and my pupils were saucers. I blanked out for about 2-3 hours during the peak as did everyone else who got on it and was drinking alot when I was back saying wtf happened LOL. Fucking awesome though.

				Alcohol diminishes the effects of MDMA. Just better to avoid alcohol all together.

				Don&#039;t drink and roll god damnit. First of all alcohol destroys/minimizes your peak like a motherfucker. Your roll lasts for a much shorter time if you drink. Alcohol causes hangovers and for some users hangover+serotonin depletion=hell on earth (I have witnessed it myself). <br /><br />Alcohol also impacts your body&#039;s ability to absorb fluids from your small intestine, which when combined with MDMA (which causes some users to sweat like being in a Finnish sauna) is definitely not good for your body and the next day can be quite painful. For me alcohol and MDMA together have caused serious dehydration which for example caused my lips to swell and hurt as if I would have received a botox treatment. Since then I have never taken MDMA while drunk or drinking. 2-3 beers is the absolute max I can take with MDMA.

				me and my friends mix alcohol and mdma somewhat frequently. it usually ends up with people redosing over and over and over while continuing to drink. mdma definitely doesnt have its full effect when mixed with alcohol but it sure is fun. probably not very good for you though and usually leaves people feeling pretty lousy in the morning.

				Much more fun to take MDMA then later on in the night take 2C-B. Believe me that will blow your mind. <br /><br />Also MDMA then later on Ketamine is pretty amazing, but don&#039;t K-Hole.<br /><br />Taking any alcohol at all with MDMA is desperate, it&#039;s only done if you HAVE to. Personally I&#039;d rather die of dehydration than contaminate and ruin my MDMA high with any alcohol at all. (only joking, make sure you drink sensible amounts of water).

				Personally I dont think alcohol mixes well any drugs.&nbsp; The effects I have seen are just so unpredictable, seen a friend, who was roids, go crazy when he got pissed, meth,speed and alcohol is the same.&nbsp; I think mixing large quantities of alcohol with any stimulant is just asking for problems.
