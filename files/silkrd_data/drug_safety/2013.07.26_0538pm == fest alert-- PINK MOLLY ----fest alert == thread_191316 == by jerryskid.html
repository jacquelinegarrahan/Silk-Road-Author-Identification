				Just a heads up to you US festival people, be on the lookout for some dicks that are selling pink mdma, never saw pink crystals, but they say it happens, this stuff however has been manipulated with some other chemicals, it will test out but not like it should, this will linger for a few seconds go milky then purp black. The stuff has different effects, some get super speedy, some get super sick, some get floored. The worst part of it is these kids are selling tests kits at a vend booth, talking about how important it is to test, then they are selling bad stuff. There were&nbsp; a few people hospitalized in bad shape. A friend of mine got bad, sick from this stuff. Another friend said that test have been done where up to 80% other materials can be added and the sample will still test as mdxx, with only 20% present actual material. If you catch these scum buckets, before you destroy their poison, after you take their money, but before they are beaten&nbsp; and/or spun, please make sure to tell them why they are getting this treatment. The only reason they didn&#039;t meet a bad fate here is because they shut down their booth and left early saturday morning, after they spread their rc poison. They did not say they were Bunk Police but they had BP posters and kept referring to BP, they WILL get whats coming. Just wanted to warn people about the pink &quot;molly&quot;, these are not presses, it is crystal

				99.9% chance says its actually methylone.<br /><br />There have been a few cases in the past of a purple/pink hue to actual mdma.. in the UK anyway. Due to it being smuggled in wine bottles, from my understanding. <br /><br />My moneys on methylone though.

				You mean like these? http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4230e5b401&nbsp; lol most definitely not mdma.&nbsp; The pink color is caused by a leftover precursor 2-bromo-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propan-1-one) from a common route.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its supposedly not that good for you.&nbsp; You already seem aware that it is very easy to fool test kits.&nbsp; Your friend is right, and if what you are using is strong and produces a really dark color it doesn&#039;t even take 20%.&nbsp; Hopefully everyone effected by that recover safely.&nbsp;

				I would never buy pink crystals, or anything at a fest for that matter, but thanks for the warning! I&#039;ll make sure I call out any cocksuckers selling this shit and warn others about it.

				Good to let people know this... there is a widespread belief that crystals are more pure/legit than pills or powder and in many cases that is simply not the case.

				i have recieved MDMA that has an almost pinkish purple hue from the vendor Oil wrestling, and it was honestly one of the best batches of MDMA im told ive ever given out.&nbsp; i do get that from everyone i sell too, but i was told by some vets who loved it.&nbsp; i took it, and it was quite enjoyable.&nbsp; <br /><br />im with the other on this thread form methylone, but methylone would not do that to people.&nbsp; ive seen kids eat like half grams of methylone because they think its MDMA and are trying to produce the slight &quot;mdma-like&quot; feeling.&nbsp; who knows what it actually is, it could be a huge combination.<br /><br /><br />also about the marquis test being black, i feel like the only way it would still go black is if the substances found in the crystal were not readable by a reagent test.&nbsp; is this correct thinking?<br /><br /><br />my two cents

				I agree methylone will not do that to people, Unfortunately for those poor kids that pretty pink color is caused by one nasty little precursor.&nbsp; As to the color turning black darker colors will easily out show lighter ones.&nbsp; try this experiment at home if you don&#039;t believe me.&nbsp; Get a test kit(this is for the standard marquis) take a small bit of methylone which will test yellow.&nbsp; Lets say you use 20mgs of methylone now add 1 mg of iodine to it.&nbsp; That&#039;s 5% so shouldn&#039;t make a big difference right?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well tell me what color it turned?&nbsp;
