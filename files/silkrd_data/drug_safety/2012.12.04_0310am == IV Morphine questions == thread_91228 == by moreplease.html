				Title: <strong>IV Morphine questions</strong><br />

				Hello... How&#039;s it going?<br /><br />Alright so I looked at a bunch of threads&nbsp; about morphine and none of them really answered the questions I had.<br />Sorry this is so long, I have a tendency to ramble with what I think is relevant information, which probably isn&#039;t honestly.<br /><br />First being.. How long does IV Morphine last?<br />I am concerned about this. The price of morphine is excellent in comparison to any other opioid.. Except that crappy ones I don&#039;t take (like vics, and percs). I used to IV OC 80&#039;s (only half) and I could get two shots out of it first one with a rush and the second one right after to sustain my high, only problem was the high was literally GONE in 1.5 hours so I started to pop the oxy instead cause seriously, what a waste. Anyway, nobody has really addressed the length of the IV morphine high so though I&#039;d ask.<br /><br />Secondly....... Wow. Oh yeah, dosing. What would a zero tolerance dose be for IV morphine in pill form (IR) <br />I will say I have absolutely no tolerance, just to be safe (it may or may not be true, I don&#039;t know but it&#039;s easier for me to figure out my dose based on a&nbsp; zero tolerance dose) It does seem like it takes me more than things used to though which is frustrating because my dosing is all off, but I chalk that up to I have different brain chemistry now.<br />There is this opioid narcotic dosing converter (http://www.globalrph.com/narcotic.cgi) which only takes into account medical grade things, not that you are crushing up and IV&#039;ing a 30mg pill. So, I did an oral to oral conversion of morphine and oxycodone, which says 30mg oxy = 45mg of morphine. Could one assume this would be accurate for IV dosing (I used to IV about 30mg oxy) that IVing 45mg morphine would be where to start? Or would it be less? Keeping in mind usually not all the drug is drawn the first time, which is why most people who shoot pills do a rinse.<br />Honestly I can probably figure this out on my own, it just is more wasteful trying to figure it out - like when I ordered 3 4mg hydromorphone and shot them: no rush. I did 2mg, then 4mg, then i didn&#039;t have enough to do 6mg because I sniffed 2mg after my first shot... Oy vey! And I am sure I didn&#039;t get all 4mg in the first shot so that&#039;s probably why it didn&#039;t work.<br /><br />One more question.<br /><br />I have seen posts written saying morphine is crap recreationally, and I&#039;ve come across one on here that said &quot;i&#039;ve never got very high off of morphine sulfate, normally just use them for their unique rush while IVing.&quot; so it&#039;s crap for high but there is a rush?<br />Just wondering if anyone can describe the effects in more detail and what is so unique about the morphine rush? <br />I didn&#039;t think morphine had a &quot;rush&quot; from what I&#039;ve read around the web, but I&#039;ve never done it so just wondering from experienced persons their experience IVing. I did sniff morphine once when I first started using H a few years ago and I recall it had an opioid high to it, I didn&#039;t think it was that different from oxy at the time but actually I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d done oxycodone yet. I kind of went backwards on the opioid spectrum.. Never forget my first night/experience though.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, thank you to anyone who can answer any of my questions.

				maybe because morphine is pharmacutical in low doses to relieve moderate to severe pain. they only sell pharm morphine right ? The only way to get morphine powder is to make it yourself from growing poppies colecting sap making opium then turning it into morphine ( thats the hard part but once you learn it its easy). in my countrys dopespot there&#039;s this powder with very harsh vinegar smell looks like amateurs tried to make it into heroin. but the effects of the powder are those of morphine (RUSH I mean). And it will knock you on your ass. And heroin - diacetylmorphine - breaks into morphine in a few minutes. Strangely though from one heroin-morphine mix as i call it the high is more alive and from diacetylmorphine (heroin) its kinda dead empty. just my opinion
