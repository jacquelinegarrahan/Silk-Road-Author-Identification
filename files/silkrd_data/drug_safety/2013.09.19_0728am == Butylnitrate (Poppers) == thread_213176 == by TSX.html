				I would really like to see people posting their poppers experiences here.<br /><br />I&#039;m reading and reading and I have yet to find a single thread or even a post about: POPPERS!<br />Why is no one talking about them? Every exotic substance seems to get mentioned here, but not the ordinary poppers.<br /><br />So a few years ago and with only experience in cannabis and alcohol I bought a few bottles of PUSH, classic butylnitrate poppers these are. I also tried amylnitrate but that has more side effects than actual effect for me.<br />If you just consume it, it does not do much for you. Sure you will notice it, but there will be no real high as it should be. But when combined with sexual stimulation this stuff is the heaviest stuff I ever had in my system. You&#039;ll get 100% unscrupulous (I hope this word is correct (put hemmungslos in google translate if that helps), &quot;like an animal without human thoughts about moral&quot; would also describe it) a bottle of vodka would leave you more controlled. And you don&#039;t want to stop ether having sex and inhaling more and more.<br /><br />Very soon, after less than a minute of sexual stimulation and poppers it produces what I still to this day would call the ultimate sexual experience. It makes you wild and massively perverted beyond every level I imagined was possible.<br /><br />Here is why poppers are not my favorite drug, even though I&#039;m always looking for &quot;sexual drugs&quot; and this is undoubtedly THE KING:<br />If you consume way to much there will be a yellow spot in the middle of your field of view. If you then consume even more the yellow spot goes away and is replaced by a black spot that looks like a black hole that seems to suck in material, but not in a spiral, linear. After that I don&#039;t that think there will be happening any good things. I would strongly advice to stop when you see the yellow spot, poppers can actually be very dangerous. The yellow spot goes away after 10-30 minutes depending on your body.<br />It is very heavy on the body. More destructive than alcohol. Your breath ways and especially your nose will suffer greatly and your immune system gets DESTROYED in a matter of days when you consume it daily. Headaches are the most common side effect, they can happen a) while on it, secondheadache I call it because it lasts just a few seconds and b) afterwards, but then they are &quot;real&quot; headaches, caused by the poppers. With amylnitrate I always immediately get a secondheadache, with butyl I can consume any amount without a headache. Also if you orgasm without putting the stuff to the side for 2-3 minutes before the orgasm will not be enjoyable at all, it will feel way to intense (in a bad way) and you&#039;ll think you are going to die (which could really happen at this point) because your heart has touched your rips (!) with a beat or two. This was very scary and kind of painful.<br />And it floors you afterwards very hard, you&#039;re done and in need of at least 30 minutes of flat lying around and breathing because your body is super out of balance with blood pressure and all of that.<br /><br />I know this all sounds crazy, why should someone consume such a substance when it has these heavy side effects and is so dangerous? Simple, because the sexual experience from it is ALMOST worth it. And I only say that because the side effects are so drastic. I could also say that it is worth it, because I&#039;m not really sure. I consider it the ultimate sexual experience so the question is, what price are you willing to pay for that? The price is very high I can assure you.<br /><br />Since about 2 years ago I didn&#039;t use poppers and I&#039;m struggling if I want to use them again or not. I remember the feelings afterwards and the crash was always super hardcore and really only for very strong people. That always keeps me from using it again. An MDMA crash can be a little ruff when you have done way to much. (500mg+) A poppers crash is far worse from what I remember, but you are back to baseline much faster than on an MDMA crash. When you combine these two there will for sure only be one thing waiting: death.<br /><br />Please share your experiences, if possible. :)<br /><br />

				I have had the exact same &quot;yellow spot&quot; in my vision during my few experiences with poppers, which freaked me out considering I&#039;ve always had fantastic vision, and did NOT want to potentially damage it. <br />I quit poppers entirely due to this, also thanks to the fact that it for some reason didn&#039;t enhance my orgasm <br />at all, and actually made it a very mediocre experience for me.<br />I disposed of the only one I ever bought after reading a study about people with permanent visual damage due to poppers.<br /><br />I definitely would NOT consider this a safe drug by any means, and would avoid it at all costs if you haven&#039;t already tried it. The high is very much an acquired taste, and even if you do enjoy it, it has funky visual and cardiovascular effects (the racing heartbeat is quite alarming) that make it not worth it.

				As a young pup, I was advised against trying it.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was frowned upon by my elder drug users.&nbsp; When I finally tried it, I thought &quot;Meh&quot;. There are different brands of butyl nitrate, and I don&#039;t know the finer differences between them.<br /><br />10 or 15 years later I tried it again and enjoyed it more.&nbsp; Like you said, it has to be the right setting.&nbsp; I&#039;m still a little concerned about health side effects, so I don&#039;t do them directly.&nbsp; If the person I&#039;m with wants to do them, I don&#039;t mind.&nbsp; I&#039;ll enjoy a slight contact high, but I don&#039;t take a hit myself.<br /><br />IIRC, Amyl Nitrate is supposed to be a vaso-dilater, it dilates the blood vessels to the heart, and lowers blood pressure too.&nbsp; Its very dangerous to combine amyl nitrate with Viagra, you could die.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; If you have reduced blood flow to the heart, then that&#039;s a good thing.&nbsp; This is before we had modern blood pressure drugs, and angioplasty, etc etc.&nbsp; Amyl Nitrate was a prescription medicine, and butyl nitrate was a analog that you could get that did basically the same thing.&nbsp;

				Amyl was used in birth&#039;s up until the 1980s sometimes, that is really insane from my point of few, because the woman has pure stress with giving birth and then you shock her body with poppers, wow. Sure it will help, that is the same reason why the gay fisting community is using it.<br /><br />It seems no one has had these super intense experiences, two posts now, both say it&#039;s mediocre. Not what I expected.<br /><br />@junjo <br />It doesn&#039;t enhance the orgasm, it (for me) makes the orgasm very unpleasant, BUT the sex before is better by a factor of 2500 or so. That&#039;s why I said I had recommended putting the bottle aside 2-3+ minutes before an orgasm.<br /><br />Come on ASS FISTERS UNITE hahahah. No one here likes poppers, that is really a surprise. I thought I&#039;ll make a poppers thread and people will come with their years old endless long story&#039;s about this. You never know.<br />Maybe I should make a fisting thread in the off-topic forums, or maybe even in drug safety, because: FISTING IS A HELL OF A DRUUUHG. ;D
