				If you are still typing then you should be ok. Don&#039;t sit down. Try to stay away and keep breathing!!! If you fall asleep too high you could choke on your own saliva, vomit, or just stop breathing.<br /><br />stay concious for a while.

				vomiting is a natural reaction for many h users, especially for new ones.<br />sounds like you&#039;re a new one (?), but doesn&#039;t matter, stay awake and concentrate on breathing if it&#039;s getting to hard, try to get someone you know, that he/she can look after you.

				I suspect you&#039;re feeling a lot better now that you&#039;ve had a few hours.&nbsp; (As a couple people have said, if you can still type you aren&#039;t overdosing. It sounds like you had a really strong nod combined with opiate nausea, which can definitely be a scary experience if you&#039;re alone when you dose.&nbsp; In the future you may want to have a mate around (if that&#039;s possible) when you try something like H.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re really concerned don&#039;t waste time on a forum asking questions about overdoses. By the time we figured out you had too much chances are you wouldn&#039;t be able to call 911 to get help.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Anyway, let us know you&#039;re all right and in the future try to be careful with your opiate dosing. You can always take more, but you can never take less.

				Responsibility and Moderation are two very important keys to life.&nbsp; With that being said, I don&#039;t sympathize with you at all.&nbsp; Be more careful and mature about the drugs you are using next time.&nbsp; You can always take more but you can never take less, so start LOW like you should have done in the first place.

They took their own lives by being careless with a humorless drug, tough break.

People as a whole are rotten and misinformed, comfortable living in their own cesspool with no motivation to improve.<br /><br />In the words of my idol, &quot;I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don&#039;t need. We&#039;re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War&#039;s a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We&#039;ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we&#039;d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won&#039;t. And we&#039;re slowly learning that fact.

				In my experience when you actually overdose and not just overdose where you are still conscious/puking/off balance/hard breathing. You won&#039;t even know it and just nod out and be totally unresponsive besides maybe a few grunts, but definitely not conscious enough to think or know what is happening. You will then stop breathing within a few minutes and start to lose coloration turning very white with a blue tinge around your lips.&nbsp; It is a quick process, and an ambulance should be called immediatly once someone isn&#039;t responsive and is turning colors, or if you are close to a hospital or live in a big city where it takes 30 minutes to even talk to a 911 operator just drive as fast as you can to the hospital and if you see a cop stop them, so they can drive. <br /><br />I have witnessed various stages of overdoses, and when they are really serious you don&#039;t have much time. I witnessed my friend die in front of me because I tried slapping, mouth to mouth, water, and whatever else I could for 10 minutes before I called an ambulance. Believe me you don&#039;t want to feel the remorse and regret that comes after watching your friend die and knowing you could of saved him.<br /><br />If did too much and are on a slight overdose, like puking and nodding out a lot try to get cold water and drink it, don&#039;t eat in case you nod out and choke. Try to keep walking around, maybe put your head in the freezer (cold air feels good and makes you feel more safe) Have someone to talk to or ask someone to come over, so when you nod out they can get you out of it. Don&#039;t ever lay down... Ever. I also wouldn&#039;t smoke a cigarette or weed it seems to progress the high, and that is the last thing you want.

				You definitely weren&#039;t ODing, Just overdid it and sounds like what a lot of people get when they first use or happen upon gear that is a lot stronger than they&#039;re used to.<br /><br />I would however advise that if your getting bang into it or even if you just have people around who pin it I would go to your local substance missuse service and get some nalaxone training. <br /><br />Its not rocket science and they will give you a nalaxone pack with everything you need in the event that the worst does happen. Dont feel bad asking for this training as it could really pay off one day and save someone from death and save their family and loved ones from going through hell.<br /><br />All the best.

And while we&#039;re on the subject, shooting someone up with speed won&#039;t help them in the case of a heroin OD either.&nbsp; Methamphetamine and amphetamines increase your heart rate but do very little to your breathing: opiates can slow your breathing but don&#039;t do much to your heart rate.&nbsp; Shooting an ODing junkie with crystal will, at best, lead to shallow breathing and tachycardia.&nbsp; Naloxone is the only thing that can reverse an opiate overdose: home remedies are likely to cause more problems than they solve.<br /><br />As far as cheap strong gear goes, I wonder how well the H was cut?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had hot spots in bundles before: snorting one bag would barely get me feeling it while one line from another bag would have me nodding like Layne Staley.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just lost a good friend to heroin a couple weeks ago. If you&#039;re going to use, stay smart and stay safe.
