				It&#039;s been called a psychedelic amphetamine, but just how psychedelic is the experience?&nbsp; Has anyone here personally tried it?&nbsp; How close is it to an LSD experience?&nbsp; The duration is obviously way longer, but does it feel more like a traditional psychedelic or more like an amphetamine with psychedelic undertones?&nbsp; Going to be trying it for my first time; would 2 mg suffice for a beginner?&nbsp; Also, is absorption in the mouth required, or can it be swallowed immediately?

				its fairly psychedelic.&nbsp; i didn&#039;t have any super spiritual/paranormal/mystical shit happen like on LSD, but it was a fucking great trip.&nbsp; really intense visuals that i had full control over; music was completely tangible and amazing; everything was funnier, lots of laughing; sex on DOC was AMAZING.&nbsp; i thoroughly enjoyed DOC.<br />i gave it to a friend at a rave once and the whole night he kept saying how awesome the party was and how amazing the acoustics in this basement were, but that the drug did not do anything.&nbsp; it was obvious to me that he was on it, but from his perspective everything was normal and he was just having an exceptional time.&nbsp; apparently after the party he left and went to his car and realized that he was tripping balls and decided to go to the local modern art museum, lol.<br /><br />don&#039;t know about dosing tho; it came to me in water and i just took what was given to me.

It&#039;s a lot like candyflipping but it lasts 12-30 hours. Amazing visuals with incredible depth, intense body high, empathy, etc.<br />2mg is plenty for most people, don&#039;t start at a higher dose than 2mg.

				Alexander Shulgin commented on it as being a &quot;long-lasting, dyed-in-the-wool psychedelic.&quot;.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s like LSD without the expansion of consciousness, spiritual depth, etc.<br /><br />It&#039;s something you&#039;d take just for fun, basically. It&#039;s not really a spiritual psychedelic.

				Nice.&nbsp; Is it easily degradable like LSD, thus needing special storage, or not?

They&#039;ll last hundreds, thousands, or millions of years without having to take precautions to preserve them.
