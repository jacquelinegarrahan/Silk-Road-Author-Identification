				Hey guys,<br /><br />I have experience with weed, which I can&#039;t stand anymore. The headspace is just awful, and I really have no affection towards self-induced paranoia. LSD was a very helpful, though difficult experience for me. I won&#039;t touch it too soon again, maybe in the summer, somewhere in the sun... My favorite so far is MDMA. Oh god, how do I love this stuff! Thanks Mr. Shulgin ;) Btw, donate him some coins, he seems to be in a pretty fucked up medical condition, bedridden... ulcer problems...<br />paypal:<br />annandsashashulgin@comcast.net<br /><br />I do not want to get addicted to stuff, keep that in mind. Recommendations?

				i&#039;d recommend psychedelics as they can be powerful psychotherapeutic tools, but since lsd was difficult for you... maybe try ketamine? it&#039;s gentler and will not cause anxiety. ketamine goes very well with mdma. ;)

				Ketamine is really easy to build up a big tolerance to (and it always sucks when that happens), so I&#039;d say more than twice a week is too much.

				Adventurous, eh? <br /><br />Salvia is a rite of passage, try it out, haha. A 10 minute mind fuck with 2-3 minutes of pure intensity. <br /><br />Actually, you will probably hate it. Nobody actually likes salvia, it is purely for the adventerous, the mind explorers.<br /><br />I actually suggest you try some good cocaine. It will give you a fun night, and you really have to worry about getting addicted if you just try it for a night. If you are not into the psychedelics and you are sick of weed, I think yayo is your best bet. I would suggest opiates, but you DO have to worry about getting addicted to those.<br /><br />Let us know what you decide!

				I want to suggest DMT also, but not 5-MeO-DMT which often causes unpleasant experiences.<br />Make sure you put the glass pipe down or tie it to a piece of string so that if you let go it swings away rather than scalds you somewhere.<br /><br />Maybe try Pharmahausca, a less nauseating variation of DMT. (a shot, and another shot a little while later, as apposed to a whole bowl of brew)<br /><br />I wonder if MDMA can be mixed with DMT in a simmilar way to candyflipping to increase to ensure a positive response?<br />Salvia&#039;s too uncomfortable for me, with the itching and cold sweaty feeling that you can&#039;t get rid of even in a hot shower.

				MDMA &amp; DMT is a great combo. I recommend trying MDMA &amp; Mushrooms though, one of my favorite combinations ever.

				For the truly adventurous, DMT is definitely out there. Personally, it raises more questions than it answers and my curiosity is very high right now!<br /><br />There are various methods to administer, I personally like mixing it with a herb and creating changa although there is changa available from certain vendors. Changa is easily smoked in a water pipe and can lengthen the experience a little if youŕe already comfortable with it.<br /><br />But thats just me.. I love the stuff and smoke it on an almost daily basis at the moment!<br /><br />Peace,<br />Diddle

				Hey guys,<br /><br />thanks for the recommendations so far. I decided to go with K and 2C-B.<br /><br />Pizzabrain:<br />I am getting a special deal from 03welle. He asked me not to give away the g price because he usually is selling capsules. Nice guy, good communication, just ask him ;)
