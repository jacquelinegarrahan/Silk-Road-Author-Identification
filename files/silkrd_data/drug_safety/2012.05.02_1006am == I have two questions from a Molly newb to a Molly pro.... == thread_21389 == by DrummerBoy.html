				I have taken many a xtc pill in my day but I have never had pure Molly.&nbsp; I just discovered the SR and am going to order some Molly asap.&nbsp; I have two questions though for anyone who will answe:&nbsp; 1) are molly crystals same as molly powder?&nbsp; some of the adds say pure molly crystals, some say powder.&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; I keep hearing people say they take it via parachute or pill or with water or whatever.&nbsp; Why not just snort it like meth?&nbsp; Does snorting molly not work?<br /><br />Feedbak is much appreciated.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />DB

				Snorting it fucking rocks and hits you like a bus. It&#039;s at least worth trying. Still my preferred ROA

				1) Powder and crystals are theoretically the same, but crystals are usually considered to be purer, although that&#039;s not always the case.&nbsp; Buyer beware.<br /><br />2) Yes, you can snort MDMA.&nbsp; It&#039;s fun, but don&#039;t over-do it.&nbsp; Recommend you do some reading about MDMA before you go crazy with it.&nbsp; Understand how it affects your body and how to use it for best results.&nbsp; You can start here: (clearnet) http://www.thedea.org/letsroll.html

				Only difference between powder and crystals is that the powder has been HCL&#039;d to recrystallize it. The purity differs from how many times its washed. <br /><br />And yeah you can snorth MDMA but I would probably have a few vodkas before ya do it lol. It can be a stinger. <br /><br />IMO there isn&#039;t really any need to bomb it, you can just dab it under your tongue on the vein or just put it on ya tongue and swallow it with a bit of water. I think the taste is quite nice. :)

				Read up on MDMA effects and dosage on erowid,org!<br /><br />To answer your questions: MDMA is MDMA but crystals imply higher purity, although it doesn&#039;t guarantee it. Almost every drug comes up faster and has a shorter total duration when insufflated, I prefer to take MDMA orally to increase the duration. MDMA is relatively less painful than most drugs to snort, though.

				Everyone in this culture and on this forum needs to read a few scientific journals regarding snorting drugs. It is pretty much fucking pointless unless it&#039;s cocaine or in the &#039;caine family. Do what you want because I am tired of saying this to people but seriously just parachute it. Unless you really feel like you need to act out as a badass then by all means snort it if it seems more &quot;cool&quot; to you.

				not sure how people can stand the taste!!?! :o i can&#039;t! i&#039;d describe it as.. getting some hairspray, spraying it onto your finger for 5minutes and then licking your finger. Or satan pissing on your tongue. not nice. Bombing it in a small amount of papers is the best way IMO.&nbsp; :P

If you think doing drugs differently doesn&#039;t achieve differing effects you are fooling yourself. Simply because someone is sketched out about insufflation or wary to shove something up their ass or doesn&#039;t like swallowing toilet paper does not mean anything about their level of education or responsibility.<br /><br />Get off your high horse let people make their own decisions.

				I guess maybe mdma is an acquired taste or maybe it&#039;s just when I taste straight fire mdma I associate with past experiences but I personally just chew up my pills or measure out a dosage of some shards with a little card and dump it straight in my mouth and chew up the chunks..it makes me shiver in a good way most of my friends look at me like i&#039;m crazy and chase the hell out of it with whatever drink they can find.&nbsp; Personally I feel the full effects of insulffated mdma within 5 to 10 minutes but I only snort it when I&#039;m already rolling really hard.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t hurt at all when you&#039;re peaking and it just gives me goose bumps all over...within a few minutes I get all nice and warm and my teeth start chattering...I love a fat line right when I&#039;m peaking ! ;D&nbsp; Then again I also just like putting stuff up my nose but I don&#039;t snort stuff that doesn&#039;t make a difference from oral administration ie xanax.&nbsp; Without a doubt snorting mdma has a quicker onset than oral administration.&nbsp;

Insufflation CAN hit you faster but you only have the proper receptors in your mucus membranes to bond with cocaine and the like. When it comes to other drugs it is the burn and a lot of placebo effect, which I had always way under estimated until a few years ago. You also get more of a constant flow of the drug when snorting because of the drip and you will usually notice that the effects, although they come on faster, will not last as long. I never said that different ROA&#039;s are not better than others....plugging, IV, IM, subcutanious, smoking, snorting and parachuting along with others all have their purpose and are great with their respective drugs. I am just saying that snorting is seriously one of the more wasteful ways to use mdma. The only reason do it with drugs like meth and heroin is because smoking those drugs is not near as cost efficient, and some are scared of the needle.
