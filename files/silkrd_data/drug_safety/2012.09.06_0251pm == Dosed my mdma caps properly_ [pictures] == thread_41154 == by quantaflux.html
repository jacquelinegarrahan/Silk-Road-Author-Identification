				http://imgur.com/a/8zNyJ<br />http://i.imgur.com/gFSCz.jpg<br />http://i.imgur.com/fGxWK.jpg<br /><br />So I had 7g of crystal mdma arrive this morning, I crushed it up in a shot glass and got to work putting it into these size 3 caps http://imgur.com/a/8zNyJ<br /><br />When I was done I had 56 caps, does it sound like I dosed them all properly? I feel like I should have at least hit 60.<br /><br />A cap has both sides right, so what I was doing, was taking the larger (white) side, filling that up to the top, and then adding the other (blue cap) side on, I weighed each one on my 0.1g scales and it would always fluctuate between .1 and .2, it doesn&#039;t even register the caps on their own so I don&#039;t know how much weight they are adding, but I was hoping I&#039;d be able to fill a lot more caps, did I fuck up somewhere? <br /><br />Here&#039;s a picture of my efforts with some items for scale if you&#039;re bad at reading charts like I am. http://i.imgur.com/gFSCz.jpg<br /><br />And here&#039;s a pic with a cap in half: http://i.imgur.com/fGxWK.jpg this was one of the later ones so I was starting to run out, but about 40-50 of them go right up to the top of the white side and the first 30-40 were compressed maybe a bit too tight, probably made them denser, those are going to make for some surprise rolls.

				Honestly i didn&#039;t look at your pics, but the math makes your caps contain 125mg on avg.&nbsp; most people would agree that&#039;s a good dose.&nbsp; Maybe another half a cap bumper at a later point in the night(or day).&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are going to invest the money into an operation like this you REALLY NEED to invest in a mg scale (.001), at least a scale with a sensitivity of .01g.&nbsp; Honestly though, a mg scale can cost you less than $50(for an alright model.&nbsp; that&#039;s what i paid for mine and it seems to be extremely accurate) and it&#039;s WORTH EVERY PENNY!&nbsp; seriously, i couldn&#039;t live without it! :)&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;re just eyeballing it i&#039;ve found there&#039;s a much better way to make up the caps that results in a much more accurate dosage.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see if i can do a write up of it soon.&nbsp; pm me if you&#039;re interested.&nbsp; I&#039;m super busy, but if it means a lot to you i&#039;ll try to make it a priority.<br /><br />One way or another best of luck and be careful. :D&nbsp;

				This is basic maths. Assuming you filled them all around the same level. If you fill one side to the top each time, this is good, because they will all be basically the same dose. If you had bigger caps and were eyeballing a 1/4 full cap, then you&#039;d have big problems with over and under dosed caps.<br /><br />If you weighed your MDMA at 7g. That&#039;s 7000mg. You make 56 caps. 7000/5=125mg each. Perfect. Using a scale that shows 0.1g or 0.2g is basically worthless. Neither does the size of your caps matter.<br /><br />If you have poor scales, you could weigh 60 caps, and divide the result by 60. This will help. Although 0.01g scales are needed, although cheap 0.01 scales still fluctuate +/- 0.05g.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t work out 7000/56=125mg, I have to worry if you&#039;re ready to start distributing or dosing (or even taking!) drugs on your own. :-) You didn&#039;t mention your intended dose per cap, or how much your 7g actually weighed. 7000/60=116.667mg per cap, so I don&#039;t know why you wanted 60 caps, since this isn&#039;t a dose most people would choose.<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested in the method that&#039;s better than eyeballing though... Can you just post it thisworld?

				That sounds about right if you&#039;re dosing ~125mg per cap.<br /><br />My friend actually devised a system that&#039;s really clever.&nbsp; He makes differently dosed caps since our group has differing sensitivity to MDMA.&nbsp; He uses colored sugar (like sugar cookies) to &quot;label&quot; a cap&#039;s dosage.&nbsp; Fills up the cap with the intended dose of molly then fills the rest up with the colored sugar.<br /><br />E.G.:&nbsp; Green = ~60mg<br />Blue = 100mg<br />Yellow = 150mg<br />Red = 200mg <br /><br />That way you can still have low doses if you dont feel like having a mega roll one night.&nbsp; They&#039;re not 100% accurate and I&#039;ve definitely rolled harder on the same colored cap some nights because I think there might be an extra 10mg or less 10mg some times, but it&#039;s close enough that it&#039;d be hard to overdose, plus it makes it really easy to organize your pills when distributing to friends.&nbsp; It also makes it real easy to figure out what caps are good for a redose.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t really make a lot of the Yellows/Reds because only two of us actually can handle them, but even if those run out they can take 2 Blues, or a Blue/Green for the 150&#039;ish dose. <br /><br />Anyway just a suggestion for other people who cap their own supply, it&#039;s really effective and efficient :)

				It would be pretty difficult to OD on MDMA.. I&#039;ve done a gram in a night with no ill effects untill the next morning when i was zombified and my mouth was chewed into ground beef(or human... sorry, poor sense of humor).<br /><br />Well, i&#039;m in a kind of hurry again but i&#039;ll do my best to outline the procedure we used.<br /><br />Take your Molly(ground to a powder) and dump it out on a surface where it&#039;s well contained(so you don&#039;t lose any).&nbsp; The lid of a small box works well especially if you line it with gently curved foil(so as not to kink it and get MDMA stuck).<br /><br />Separate your caps and hold the larger end between thumb and forefinger. Gently scoop into the molly.&nbsp; the molly kind of clumps and fills the opening of the cap.&nbsp; turn it up and tap if necessary to settle powder.&nbsp; Repeat.&nbsp; Careful not to dump the powder out.&nbsp; It takes a little practice, but you should be able to fill the caps to about 100mg +- 5mg rather consistently.&nbsp; I usually throw every 5-10th cap on the scale just to verify.&nbsp; If i remember correctly the caps i got weighed ~68mg.<br /><br />If you have questions or need clarification pm me.&nbsp; Sorry, if i had more time i&#039;d respond in better detail.
