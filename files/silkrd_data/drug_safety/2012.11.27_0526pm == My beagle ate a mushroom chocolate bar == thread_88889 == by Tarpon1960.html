				This is kind of a funny story, but not really. It could have ended very, very badly.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I am asleep in front of the tv Sunday night around 7:30 after returning home from a long day of travel when i am awoken by a noise I had never heard in my life. I look around, and there&#039;s my 15-year old Beagle, Monty, lying in her dog bed. All of a sudden, she makes the noise again. Now, while I was up north celebrating Thanksgiving with my family, she had 7 teeth removed, so I figure it&#039;s her new &#039;bark&#039;. I get up out of my chair, and look down only to discover that she had gotten into my luggage, chewed through three layers of ziploc bags, and eaten what was left of a shroom chocolate bar I took with me on my trip.<br />I am wide awake and freaking out in seconds. And not just because I know chocolate can be toxic to dogs.<br />For her part - she&#039;s laying in the dog bed looking at me and making these unholy noises. Not noises of pain, not noises of alarm or hunger or anything I had ever heard come out of a dog&#039;s mouth. I was tempted to video her, just so i document the sound she was making, but I didn&#039;t want to be the guy who wasted time videoing his dog dying instead of trying to help her.&nbsp; <br />My first thought was to rush her to the vet, obviously. But she is so freaked out I was afraid to move her. I thought about forcing hydrogen peroxide down her throat to induce vomiting, but I didn&#039;t think was a particularly good idea either. <br />So I relied on my years of experience attending 200 or so Grateful Dead shows and did exactly what I would have done if Monty were a human. I put on a pot of coffee, gulped down about half of it, and lay on the floor next to her and rubbed her head &amp; stomach and told her how much I loved her, what a good dog she was, etc etc. All the while she&#039;s making these noises, trembling, looking like she wants to get up, but unsure if she was capable. I lay there on the floor petting, rubbing, and telling her how much I loved her for about 4 hours. I actually thought about putting on some Grateful Dead for her, a Dark Star or a Stella Blue, but realized that that was dumb even by my standards. <br />Eventually, the noises subsided, and she got out of the dog bed and tried to walk around. 30 seconds later she stumbled back into bed. Shortly thereafter, she closed her eyes and fell asleep. <br />I stayed up pretty much all night checking on her every now and then, just to make sure she wasn&#039;t going into a coma or something. <br />Eventually I must have fallen asleep, because next thing I know it&#039;s morning, I&#039;m laying on the floor next to her and she&#039;s licking my face. You can only imagine my relief. I took her on a walk, fed her, and she seemed fine.<br /><br />She&#039;s fine now, so as I said, it&#039;s kind of a funny story, but not really. Yet one can&#039;t help but wonder what must have been going on inside her head during that experience.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve read of multiple similar incidents. Sometimes the dogs loved it, sometimes they hated it. But they were never harmed.<br />Slightly related photo of my dog:<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=88a2a135af34458e1582967d910d2215.jpg

				Glad your dog was OK!&nbsp; Sounds like you make a good dog-trip sitter.<br /><br />Once years ago when i first started growing mushrooms I was about to pick a flush in the morning and I kept waking up in the night freaking out thinking that the dog had eaten all of the tub and was tripping balls.

				not too long ago my dog ate half of an eighth bag i had left on a tray on my floor. she was rediculously high for a long time. when she would try to walk she would sway left and right, tried to jump onto my bed and landed on her stomach with her back legs still hanging off. she was shaking too. i did the same thing, sit and comfort her. ive also put a blotter on her tongue for about 10 seconds. took it back off and ate it but she didnt seem too affected by that(thank god, poor judgement on my part indeed) glad to hear your dog is okay. and its dark chocolate thats bad for them so im sure the mush chocolate was fine for him/her

				Thanks all, for replying to my original post. By way of attempting to answer the question, how much did she eat, all i can say is I weigh 170 pounds, and i have been eating all manor of powerful mind-altering substances fairly frequently for close to 30 years. I generally trip pretty hard after eating just one of these chocolates. Monty weighs 25 pounds, and the most potent drug she has done in her life was the morning she took a lick out of a warm gin &amp; tonic she thought was a glass of water when she was a puppy. Sunday night she ate somewhere between a third to a half of of a bar. Assuming she ate a third of the bar - and based purely on weight alone - that would be the same as my eating 2.25 bars. And I can say is that if i ate two and a quarter of these boomer bars i probably would be almost high enough to feel and hear my DNA as it attempted to rearrange itself.

				wow, thats fuckin scary!!!&nbsp; so glad that story had a happy ending :)&nbsp; <br /><br />I probably would have been more worried about the chocolate than the shrooms, but still....that level of head fuck for such a simple animal?&nbsp; i can&#039;t even imagine what went through your dog&#039;s head.&nbsp; sounds like you did the right thing by laying with her and talking to her.<br /><br />i am very curious about those noises you said she made.&nbsp; i&#039;ve heard tales of people making strange sounds on super high doses of mushrooms.<br /><br />so happy ur lil&#039; doog is okay!!!

Like when a cat gets locked in a closet or something, and makes a continuous serious of meows that vary in both volume and intensity until somebody hears it and lets it out the door.&nbsp; The only vaguely reassuring thing about the sound was that it gave no indication that she was in pain. Had she made any noise, or gesture that indicated she was in pain I would have driven her to a 24 hour vet clinic a few miles away right away. Weirdest thing I&#039;ve ever heard.&nbsp; Like a dog speaking in tongues.

Unfortunately he wasn&#039;t quite so docile, He&#039;s a pretty aggressive dog anyway when scared. So once LSD sugar cube later when the walls were trying to eat him. 3 of us had to pin him down to try and put the muzzle on him. after that he chilled a bit and I cuddled him on the porch until I fell asleep. woke up to him headbutting the door two hours later, he does that when he wants to get out of the house. Unfortunately he was already out poor confused doglet.
