				Hey guys, just got 2 grams of lim&#039;s crystal, excited to try! I was just wondering how to get the most out of a meph secession. I&#039;ve tried meph twice, both times were great!<br /><br />The first time I snorted 100mg&#039;s and felt good. About 2 hours later, well after the effects had worn off I took another line and felt amazing! Took another line about an hour and a half later and felt good. Then whenever it can to the 4th line, the effects were diminished to the point it really wasn&#039;t worth it.<br /><br />The second time I parachuted 125mg&#039;s and about 5 minutes later snorted 100mgs. It was by far the most intense feeling I&#039;ve ever had! Unfortunately, when I did a line 1 1/2 or 2 hours later, I didn&#039;t really get much out of it.<br /><br />So how do you all get the most out of you meph in regards to dose and timing in between dose. Thanks for any advise!

				Has your tolerance gone up needing more to get the same hit.How long did you wait before the second time. With Mephedrone people have mentioned that their&nbsp; short term tolerance increases quickly. A useful link have a look http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=121034.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the response. It was a couple of months in between uses, and it&#039;s been since october since the last time I used. So i assume I don&#039;t have any tolerance built up. Basically what I&#039;m wanting to do is to achieve a nice consistent high throughout the night. When I parachuted 125mgs then snorted 100mgs 5 minutes later, the high was amazing, but when it wore off and I tried another 100 mg line it had little effect.<br /><br />For me, I&#039;m thinking an initial line, and 2 redoses would be the best option. After that I&#039;m assuming it is a lost cause to try more. My plan is to start at 100mgs for the initial dose, 125 second dose, and 150mg finial dose. I&#039;m hoping that will keep me occupied from around 10pm till 1 or 2am. I&#039;m just wondering if experienced users have a better method of dosing. Also, is it better to redose before&nbsp; or after the effects of the first line wear off?

				Where did you get your mephedrone from? I have used it for some years now and it will keep me up for a good 2 days if I want it to..if it&#039;s good that is, even some of the pre-ban stuff wasn&#039;t the best.<br /><br />I tend to drop about 150/200mg first then top up with small lines and similar dosed bombs, for at least the first 12 hours or so I never find it hard to reach the high again. After a gram or so it does become much more stimmy and less euphoric but I have managed to get the high back even after 24 hours use of over 2g (don&#039;t follow my bad example just trying to illustrate!). It can be very fiendish..&lt;drool&gt;.<br /><br />Lim&#039;s stuff is supposed to be great so I would imagine that you should be fine, lots of smaller more frequent lines may be worth a try after the initial dose. I&#039;m awaiting my delivery from Lim, can&#039;t wait!!

				Yea it&#039;s Lim&#039;s crystal. So you think it would be better to maybe take a good sized initial dose, then take about 50mg bumps every 30 or 45 minutes?

				I believe Mephedrone is about half as potent as MDMA... roughly.<br /><br />So I would recommend 200mg oral dose first (equivalent to 1 strong MDMA pill / dose). <br /><br />Then 50mg nasal bumps to extend over several hours.&nbsp;
