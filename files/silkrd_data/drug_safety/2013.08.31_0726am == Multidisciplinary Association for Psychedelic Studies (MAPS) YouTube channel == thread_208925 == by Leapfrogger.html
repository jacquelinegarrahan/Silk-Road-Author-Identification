				MAPS&#039; YouTube channel has over 140 videos:<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/mapsmdma (clearnet)<br /><br />Some are fairly dry, some are fascinating, some are highly technical, some are easily accessible to the layman. Poke around a bit and get their pitiful view counts up; these people are doing God&#039;s work.<br /><br />Scroll to the end for links to a few random videos from MAPS, and please share any videos that you found interesting.<br /><br />=== What is MAPS? ===<br /><br />The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a membership-based 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization working to develop psychedelics and marijuana into legal prescription drugs. MAPS was founded in 1986 by Rick Doblin, and is now based in Santa Cruz, California.<br /><br />MAPS helps scientists design, fund, and obtain regulatory approval for studies of the safety and effectiveness of a number of currently controlled substances. MAPS works closely with government regulatory authorities worldwide such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) to ensure that all of its sponsored research protocols conform to ethical and procedural guidelines for clinical drug research. Included in MAPSâ€™ research efforts are MDMA (Ecstasy) for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), LSD and psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety, cluster headaches, and depression associated with end-of-life issues, ibogaine for the treatment of opiate addiction, and alternative delivery systems for medical marijuana such as vaporizers and water pipes. MAPS states that their ultimate goal is to establish a network of clinics where these and other treatments can be provided together with other therapies under the guidance of licensed physicians and therapists.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies (clearnet)<br /><br />=== Some random videos (all clearnet) ===<br /><br />David Nichols Ph.

My bad. The second and third videos are indeed from the MAPS channel.

				Thanks Leapfrogger, nice to know. <br /><br />I am a MAPS member myself, and feel like everyone who has benefitted from psychedelics should donate something to MAPS. The work they are doing is likely to change our current medical paradigm.
