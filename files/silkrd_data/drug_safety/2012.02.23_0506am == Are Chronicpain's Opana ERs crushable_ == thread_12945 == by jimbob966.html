				Does anyone know if Chronicpain&#039;s Opana ER 40s are crushable? I would like to know because I snort pills. What would be the best way of crushing it and having it not gel up when snorted? I heard cooking it will get rid of that. As long as it&#039;s crushable in the first place and not like oxy OPs. Just need to know if I can crush it and snort it.

				Crush and snort &#039;til your heart&#039;s content, or you are nodding, jimbob.<br />Since you are snorting the Opana and not prepping it for IV, the ISO extraction I think you are thinking of is not necessary.<br />I myself have snorted 20mg of these at one sitting and experienced no gelling issues.&nbsp; Just an overwhelming urge to get comfortable and watch TV.

				shit if you dont have a tolerance though, PLEASE be extremely fucking careful! opana is potent and dangerous since you seem not to be familiar with it...<br />Just want you to be safe, so some advice: <br /><br />a starting dose is equal to or less than 5 mg for an inexperienced user. When I started, only a few mg would get me higher than even heroin now with my tolerance. <br /><br />Make sure you leave a decent amount of time between re-dosing, at least twenty minutes Id say because it really takes a minute to kick in and continues to build. <br /><br />DO NOT mix it with alcohol, it dramatically alters the bioavailability and can either prevent you from getting high or it cause wayyy more to be absorbed leading to overdose.<br /><br />Also, oxymorphone will cause your tolerance to skyrocket and you will feel like shit, so space your doses out <br /><br />and just remember to remove the outer coating prior to crushing<br /><br />- miR

				^^ to remove coating:<br /><br />Wet a small washcloth or towel and then gently rub the pill against wet material until all of the yellowish/orange coating is completely gone and you are left with the white pill.<br />After this take a knife of some sort and scrape only a tiny little bump at a time off of your now-white opana.<br /><br />After you have the small amount, use your preferred route of administration.<br />Make sure you&#039;re careful though!!!<br />Very strong pill.<br /><br />Cheers

				Thanks for the info guys. Although I&#039;m not new to opiates, I have a very low tolerance. I was only able to get the 10mg IR where I live and I know how potent these things are. I was just unsure of how Opana ERs are designed since ever drug manufacturer is making all ERs abuse proof. (Damn OPs)
