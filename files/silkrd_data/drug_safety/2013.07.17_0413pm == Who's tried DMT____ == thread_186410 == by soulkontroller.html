				They still haven&#039;t invented the words to describe what&nbsp; DMT trip is like , Maybe you should listen to some Terrence Mckenna videos i think he describes what is it like better than anyone else.<br />&nbsp;It&#039;s the most interesting drug ive ever experienced in my entire life , You should definitely give it a shot ! ;)<br />

				Oddly enough, DMT was my first psychedelic I ever tried. I wish I did more research before partaking in that journey. But I do not regret inhaling that awesome substance to this day. I saw gods, I saw the beginning of the universe, I saw the end of the universe, I was nature. It was the most spiritual, eye-opening journey I have ever been on, and I&#039;ve done DMT a few times since that night but that first time remains the highlight of my journeys. Just don&#039;t drop the bong ;)

				dmt is like the worm hole psychedelic. a breakthrough dose will transport you to other dimensions. as with all psychedelics, anything is possible so i cannot really describe it further. interestingly enough dmt occurs naturally in the human brain, and virtually all life on this planet.

				Dr Walter Bishop<br /><br />LSD - 8-12 hours<br />DMT - 5-15 minutes<br /><br />DMT is the best. If you have the time and the space to do it, I would recommend just doing the extraction yourself.<br />Much cheaper and you will get a lot more product.<br />DMT on SR honestly is very very expensive. for the price of 2 grams of DMT on SR you can get materials to extract<br />and possibly get 10 grams or more. <br /><br />Smoking it is tricky but once you get the hang of it. there is nothing like it. <br />Warning: DMT is not all good happy trips. I have had scary trips filled with bloody and meaty visuals.<br />My skin on my arm was completely gone and all i could see was muscle and blood.<br /><br />Otherwise its great. Best to take in complete silence and just meditate and concentrate on what you see and feel and think.<br />Its also great to let your lady friend smoke it and then you go fuck her like crazy. <br />I&#039;m telling this right now to all those who have DMT with them at the moment. <br />Bring it to the bed with your partner and take turns tripping and being fucked.<br />ENJOY<br /><br />Also, it lasts quite long if you sprinkle enough into a joint. Make sure the joint is using some cellulose paper<br />or some very slow burn paper. The slower the burn the better. I have done countless trips with friends passing a joint laced with <br />a lot of DMT. If 5 friends share the J then there should be enough DMT for 5 people. It lasts longer sometimes 30-45 minutes.<br />Effects are not as clear due to the effects of the weed but its still really fun to just sit in a circle, smoke it, trip out, get lost, listen to music.<br />

				To be honest, I enjoy the effects, but they un-nerve me a bit. I have this fear that I will get &quot;stuck&quot; in that state - my mind &amp; soul being in some dimention that isn&#039;t where a physical-world human is designed to be in, although it wasn&#039;t at all unpleasant. Like hailsatan123123 stated, there are not really the words to accurately describe the experience, although after doing it and listening to Adam Kokesh on Youtube (Adam vs. the Man) and reading a bit of Terrence McKinna on the subject, one does see some sort of written &quot;language&quot; which looked like greek letters, or eastern europe runes with a few latin characters mixed in. I haven&#039;t gotten to the point of seeing the &quot;machine elves&quot; yet. Freebasing it only lasts 10 minutes or so.<br /><br />I mentioned the fear of being stuck in an odd state of mind, I will admit to enjoying Salvia d. quite a bit, and for the few (3-5) minutes that lasts, one is most certainly &quot;stuck&quot; in that trip, and you really are (feel like) you&#039;re stuck between dimentions with that one. I have been thinking of taking a Xanax to calm myself a bit, then smoking some DMT, a higher amount in order to really experience it.

If for example you have a powerful mind and intellectual capability the &quot;stuck&quot; fear will have the flavor of the losing your high lucidity of mind forever. I&#039;ve passed through this stage myself since there was a period of time in which I actually worked hard to learn to manipulate the outside world to the most of my power and have everything in control of my will.<br /><br />To pass that fear you have to learn to remove the pretense of controlling everything as you do with that part of yourself. and learning to trust your body and let it do its work. Your body already knows perfectly how to return back and with your fear you are actually obstacolating the process. Trust your body, it knows perfectly what to do and it will never err if you leave it do it. There&#039;s no chance of error within your body and soul, since they probably have millenia of experience. When you dream you always return without making a sweat, isn&#039;t it? ;) As Rimbaud said: &quot;Our feeble reason hides the infinite from us&quot;.<br /><br />I know, it&#039;s difficult, and the more &quot;powerful&quot; in controlling you are the more difficult to do this is (for me it was a real nightmare). But rest assured that if I could do it then you can do it too. I&#039;m nothing special.

				So your thinking about trying DMT?<br /><br />Here is what you have to know:<br /><br />1. It is by far the most compelling, spiritual, overwhelming, and fastest (when smoked) acting psychedelic I have ever tried.<br /><br />2. It is not really a good beginner psychedelic because of how intense it is, but because it only lasts for maybe 10-15 min it is a very fast acting psychedelic, unlike a strong dose of say LSD or mushrooms.<br /><br />3. You will more thank likely meet: elves, gods, goddesses, jokers, aliens, and other spiritual and supernatural beings.&nbsp; I usually meet a goddess every time i go.<br /><br />4. Make sure your sitting...this drug will envelope you and all your senses, think of it like a trance or lucid dream like state.<br /><br />5. This drug, will show you the most magnificent things imaginable...and unimaginable.<br /><br />6. A good dose is around 30-50mg and a uber strong dose would be anything above that.<br /><br />If you want stories and trip reports visit the:<br /><br />Inter-Galactic Brotherhood of Deemsters<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.0<br /><br />Otherwise I&#039;d be happy to answer any questions, just PM me!<br /><br />Safe journeys,<br /><br />Edawg420

I have 100mg of uhrwerk&#039;s DMT sitting here, still yet to try it. I was thinking about taking around 20 mgs and vaporizing it from a light bulb. I guess, the dose can be bigger if you are smoking (from example a chillum or small pipe) the material so that the flame actually touches it, as some of the material will burn and will not be active?&nbsp;

				We need to build a new langauge to describe DMT.<br /><br />Once someone else has seen it you can alude to &quot;impossible shapes&quot; and such and they will have some idea of what you mean, but if the person has not seen it your description will sound corny and unrealistic.<br /><br />Consider 2 parrellel lines that interesect. Such a description is a meaningless paradox, but accurately describes what I have seen.

				yeah i always put more in a pipe due to the flame or heat burning off the dmt. <br /><br />But i guess i just enjoy the extreme adventures...so i no bull shit have done anywhere from 50mg to 100mg of DMT through my volcano.<br /><br />That my friend is fucking intense.<br /><br />In fact, one time i tripped out so fucking hard, i stopped all DMT usage for like 2-3 months...not because it was a bad trip, but just because of how FAR i went, well it kinda scared me lol.<br /><br />But, one festival later, and i am back to my enjoyable adventures =P

				As others have said, there are really no words to properly describe a DMT experience. Psychedelics in general and DMT especially are so far beyond ordinary language that the only words I could use to describe it are ones that do not exist in the dictionary and only within the confines of a tripping mind.<br /><br />DMT is like watching the universe collapse onto itself while having your ego chewed up and spat out by a giant cosmic machine of infinite mass and scope.<br /><br />DMT is like being plugged into the direct powersource of God and having all the universal truths beamed into your mind.<br /><br />DMT is like nothing else in the world<br /><br />Expect nothing, but prepare for everything. Just try it, and then you will know.

Many people simply use these substances without establishing a direction before and in doing this they cannot understand if what they hear is &quot;real&quot; or not (reality having to do with the information being in syntony with the place you are visiting) and the information being valid or not.<br /><br />I make you an example: if you go to the element of fire and you see an entity with blue garments that speak with a sweet things then you immediately know that the entity is &quot;false&quot;, but if you didn&#039;t direct your explorations before, how can you really know these things?<br /><br />For this shamans have a framework to follow on working with these substances, just for this problematic. <br /><br />In any case remember always this: no matter how good instinctively what an entity can tell you may seem, always test the information to the best of your ability (while you are there or when you return). This is very important: don&#039;t take anything for granted no matter what. Even entities don&#039;t like simpletons and naive people and they will test you front to end, so they expect the same from you. If you don&#039;t by and by they will start treating you like a puppet and rightly so, given that this is what you wanted (since you never tested what they said).

				Well, I&#039;ll guess I&#039;ll have to get to where I&#039;m seeing entities. So far it&#039;s been the mathematical formulas of the &quot;other (quantum)&quot; universe that keeps our physical one running. Experiencers do seem to see a common lexicon of some unknown language, among other things.<br /><br />Still exploring...
