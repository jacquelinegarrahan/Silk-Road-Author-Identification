				All this talk about arteries, I thought I&#039;d better post about how to tell if you are in an artery or a vein (for the benefit of the OP- sounds like the rest of you probably already know this).<br />Anyway, basically, the blood from a vein will be dark red and thick looking and the blood from an artery is light, bright, frothy red. Once you have seen them once, you will know the difference- it is very apparent. The frothy brightness of the blood is because it is full of oxygen- the arteries take blood directly from the heart, through the lungs and thence to all your extremities. It is also under a higher pressure than blood in the veins- if you cut an artery, the blood will pump out in time with your heart- I once used a rather blunt needle and must have clipped a minor artery, when I withdrew the needle, I had a fine jet of arterial blood like one of those pulsing fountains, about 6 inches in the air. At one time that would have really freaked me out- I was very squeamish about needles before I got addicted to heroin. As it was, I found it pretty cool and entertaining (in a perverted sense).<br />That is how far you can fall once you start playing with injection- thankfully I stopped injecting when 3 out of 4 attempts ended in failure and wasted H, and eventually fought and beat my addiction (after 20 years of wasted life). Many people at that stage, then start on their groin, after a few years of that, abscesses, infections set in, they end up with a permanent pit in their thigh full of pus, about 2 inches in diameter. Eventually they get septicemia, gangrene and general organ failure- many people I know, have died in this manner, or lost their leg. This actually played quite a part in my recovery- around the time my life had hit my personal rock bottom, quite a number of people I knew died in this manner, one after the other- it was a big wake up call!<br />To the OP- you may be a &quot;funky, chunky monkey&quot; now, but wait till that monkey has crawled round onto your back- you certainly won&#039;t be chunky then, you&#039;ll be a sad and emaciated monkey, and whilst some do manage to just take H now and again, most eventually fall out without even realising it at the time- addiction is something that very often isn&#039;t apparent until it&#039;s too late- it creeps up on you- you can always find an excuse to have that extra little bit and before you know it, the intervals between use get less and less. But hey, it&#039;s your life, your choice whether to try or not, but what you don&#039;t know, you can&#039;t miss!
