				No one is going to be able to give you a specific answer, cause there is so many factors to way up. I&#039;d put most overdoses down to people being down right careless.

				Especially with opiates, it depends greatly on tolerance. A dose that might barely get a heroin addict feeling good could easily kill a first time user.

				It greatly depends on the drug indeed, and whats probably more interesting is the ratio between a dose that is effective and a dose that is lethal.<br /><br />For opiates like heroin or morphine the ratio between a fatal and a recreational dose isn&#039;t all that high. A tenfold mistake on the high side is likely to kill you, or at least get you hospitalized.<br /><br />If you consider cannabis on the other hand, its virtually impossible to self-administer a fatal dose. You&#039;d probably be too stoned to hold a joint very long before the dose becomes life threatening, though you might regret that experiment for quite some time after ;)<br /><br />Alcohol is an interesting drug in that regard: While a fatal dose is not that much higher than a dose that gets you totally drunk, it is difficult to drink yourself to death in a single run - as long as you take it one unit at a time. What actually happens is you find yourself on the floor with a glass the next day, very much alive, and probably complaining of the worst headache you ever had.&nbsp;

				I think the LD50 of mushrooms (psilicybin) is 19 grams of Psilicybin, which is like 20 pounds.<br /><br />gross.<br /><br />If you are looking to KYS (thats how we cool people type &quot;kill your self&quot;) go get a half gram of 2c-t-7 and snort it all.&nbsp; I heard it was a very dumb thing to do and it sucks really bad and you will regret it.&nbsp; Make sure to get a tattoo thatsays &quot;no regrets&quot; first to remind you that it&#039;s nothing to regret.<br /><br />Make sure to have a knife or a gun, Them demons are fucking assholes.
