				I&#039;m talking about this product<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d730486404<br /><br />How does someone smoke it? Not the same way you&#039;d smoke normal hash I&#039;m guessing right?

				You can smoke it like normal hash in a joint or use a meth pipe and vaporize it. Using a meth pipe also works for weed and normal hash, it&#039;s better to vaporize it but it&#039;s better for opium not to be heated to hot like in joint because morphine and opiates are highly sensitive to heat.

				When you smoke it, please let us know what its like and whether you notice any opium-like effects.&nbsp; You can smoke opium in a vaporizer so you should be able to smoke this hash in a vaporizer.

				I&#039;ll definitely report back, thank you everyone. The bad news is I&#039;ll be away all next weekend so it will be a little bit before I can report. I&#039;m gonna order it today and as soon as I get back I&#039;ll smoke it.

				Nepalese temple balls are reputed to have opium in them, but I&#039;ve never tried them so I don&#039;t know if in fact they really do have opium in them.&nbsp; This stuff sure looks like there is opium in it.&nbsp; They originate in an exotic part of the world (Nepal) so I imagine they should have an unusual, distinctive high.&nbsp; I find domestic cannabis products a little boring frankly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always preferred hash from exotic part of the world.&nbsp; Somehow it seems that the quality of consciousness of the area where the hash is produced affects the high of the product.&nbsp; Like Hawaiian weed (now very rare but very widely available in the 70&#039;s) had a unique smell and a very euphoric high reminiscent of the islands.&nbsp; Similarly, Thai sticks had a very unique, perfume-like fragrance and a weird, intense high unlike anything available domestically.&nbsp; It is wonderful that SR makes these foreign types of hash available.&nbsp; I&#039;m also interested in Dope Man&#039;s Indian charas.&nbsp; But I&#039;m especially interested in his opium.&nbsp; I missed out last time, but supposedly he will have more available sometime soon.&nbsp; Then I&#039;ll order the whole thing:&nbsp; charas, temple balls and opium.

				You should be really careful smoking anything in countries that have both opium and cannabis growing all over the place.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had some bad opium sold to me as a joint in Laos before, and would not recommend it. Otherwise laos is great for trying drugs, just make sure you actually get what you wanted :D

				I really want to try the opium products from the guy who gets his pods directly from the Bayer fields... that is ballsy as FUCK, and likely produces an incredibly superior product.
