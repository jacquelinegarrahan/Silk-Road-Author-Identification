				ooh, you&#039;re in for a treat&nbsp; :D<br />Buy from any of the well rated vendors, DrAmsterdam is my current favourite as his MD is seriously pure but Aakoven, mitanox and a load more are good.<br />You want it to work properly but obviously don&#039;t want to get too fucked up. A really nice starter dose which I give to friends is 100mg, then at +90 min, take another 40mg. Don&#039;t redose before 90 min. Expect to come up at around the time you think &#039;I don&#039;t feel anything&#039;. <br />

				Funny I was just about to post the same thing... thinking of ringing in the new year with a bang!&nbsp; I&#039;ve had ecstasy pills before that were a good time but seemed to be a bit of a rollercoaster, many highs and lows in the 3-4 hour high.&nbsp; Is this something I can expect from MDMA?&nbsp;

				You&#039;ll definitely have rushes. Peaks with moments of absolute clarity is probably a better description than highs and lows. You find your own methods of enhancing the peaks. I personally love menthol roll up cigarettes&nbsp; :D.

				betaraybob, definitely fast from all food for at least 6 hours before ingesting the MDMA. Take a 500-1000mg Vitamin C and possibly a 500-1000mg Magnesium supplement before you dose. I like to have meditative music in the background.<br /><br />This is a good read on the therapeutic use of MDMA:<br />http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/revision.html<br /><br />Keep hydrated during the journey. You would need no more than 150-175mg of any of the quality MDMA available on SR from the reputable vendors.<br /><br />Namaste

				I just know I&#039;m gonna get flamed HARD for this... but here goes.<br /><br />Go big. Nothing compares to the first time. I&#039;ve taken doses from 100mg to 2 grams orally, and doses from 50mg to 300mg IV. Not to be a dick-shower, just giving some background and hopefully lending some validity to my point of view.<br /><br />Sit down, decide you wanna go fucking nuts, put your nuts in one hand, and a straw in the other. Now go snort at least 200mg. Preferably 300. You&#039;ll never feel the first time again! Don&#039;t waste it on a moderate dose.<br /><br />In case you&#039;re worried, it&#039;s not like LSD or mushrooms. You aren&#039;t gonna have a &quot;bad trip&quot; from MDMA. In fact you&#039;re going to love everyone, and everything. Also, this friend is gonna be your new best friend.<br /><br />Have fun. Everyone else: Flame away. This isn&#039;t even a remotely dangerous dose.

				The preceding post is a good way to end up with some definite serotonin axon damage. This isn&#039;t a pissing contest. <br /><br />Less is more with MDMA. There is a sweet spot. Let the medicine work it&#039;s magic.

				I&#039;m not really a SR vet, but I have done MDMA and E a number of times and I&#039;ve followed the major MDMA-related topics on the forums.<br /><br />People seem to recommend DRamsterdam, mitanox, Ivory, and juergen2001, on both service and the quality of their MDMA, so I don&#039;t think you can go wrong with any of those guys. I personally haven&#039;t tried any MDMA from SR yet, but I do have 1g of Ivory&#039;s on me and 2g of juergen2001&#039;s coming in (hopefully soon!).<br /><br />Dosages vary depending on MDMA quality, and I&#039;ve seen recommendations usually run between 100mg and 150mg. Since you and your friend haven&#039;t done rolled before, 100mg-120mg should be more than enough, especially with the higher quality stuff offered on SR. You can take your starting dose of ~100mg-120mg, then follow it up with a booster that&#039;s 1/2 the amount of your starting dose (~50mg-60mg) between 1-1.5 hours later, right as you peak. If you do opt for the starter+booster, just take one booster dose and avoid the temptation to keep taking more and more. A lot of people who have tried redosing past the first booster dose is a waste, and only makes them feel speedy without the euphoria and other good stuff. Don&#039;t eat right before! An empty stomach is ideal, so you should fast 4-6 hours before you drop. Also avoid alcohol (mixing uppers and downers is never a good idea). You can pop it in a gelcap, mix it in a sports drink, or snort it, but I prefer gelcaps just for simplicity and it&#039;s easier to take with you. You should also probably look into 5-HTP supplements for afterwards, as that helps in restoring your serotonin depletion and helps you bounce back faster. <br /><br />Be with some good friends, and MDMA will take care of the rest. Clubbing and dancing is so, so fun, but I&#039;ve chilled out in the company of a few close friends in more private settings, also with good results. Other than that, enjoy yourself! Stay safe!

				Nothing beats that first roll.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Mostly good advice here.&nbsp; Just remember that attitude and surroundings play a big part in your experience.&nbsp; My SO and our friends prefer a cozy couch at an after-hours club and just people watch.&nbsp; It&#039;s good fun!<br /><br />Alcohol is generally a no-no, but I usually have 1-2 before I start my roll just to relax a little.&nbsp; After that, it&#039;s a LOT of water.<br /><br />

				Thank you all for the informative replies. i hear what you&#039;re saying johnnyfried123, i like to do things hard like that too sometimes but honestly i think im gonna try 100 to start and then a 50 redose when i need it. Im really excited for it! Plan on doing it New Years at a bar. I&#039;ll let you all know how it went.<br /><br />PS: I also have a little yay and some ocs, should i stay the hell away from that while rolling? Thanks again everybody!

				If it&#039;s your first time rolling, I&#039;d say to just skip out on using anything else, and just bask in pure MDMA euphoria. :]<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s important to time your redose, as redosing too late tends to not do anything for most people. 1-1.5 hours after the initial dose is usually when your roll peaks, and taking a booster at that point is supposed to extend your peak.

				I&#039;ve heard a lot of people say &quot;less is more,&quot; but I dunno what that means exactly.&nbsp; I think less is less, more is more, but only just right is just right.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, how much is just right depends on where you&#039;ll be, who you&#039;ll be with, and what you&#039;ll be doing.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to be out in public with normal/straight people, you&#039;ll want to moderate your dosage to the point where you can walk and talk without much problem.&nbsp; I&#039;d say 100mg would be pretty well on point for a first time.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to cause a scene and all that.&nbsp; However, if you&#039;re just going to be with a few friends in private, I say GO FOR IT.&nbsp; I&#039;ll never advise anyone to snort molly, but I would definitely take a good 200mg off the top, throw on some good tunes, and pick a comfy spot to roll my face off.&nbsp; Then another 100-200 after 45 minutes or so.&nbsp; DEFINITELY resist the urge to keep dosing up after that, because you&#039;re just throwing it down the drain.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tough urge to fight, I know. : /

But you&#039;re right about the urge to take more doses. At some point, you&#039;re just throwing MDMA down the drain for very little (if any) reward. Think bell curves! Diminishing returns!

				That&#039;s why I try to always have a few benzos to throw the brakes on when it&#039;s over.&nbsp; I have a pretty tough time overcoming that urge to take more molly, especially if I&#039;m out with people who are still partying.
