				Where I&#039;m from we have 2 types of heroin, raw or scramble. I personally like raw better.. but scramble is ok when not much else is around..<br />I&#039;ve noticed on SR that heroin is either number 3 or number 4..<br />Is raw and scramble just another name for number 3 or number 4?<br />and if not which is better for smoking (off tinfoil) and which is better for snorting?<br />I know this questions been asked a bajillion times but i keep getting error message when i try searching (says that my ip addresss just did a search less than 5 seconds ago..),<br />so please dont call me an asshole and give me lots of -karma for that..<br />Well actually karma means shit on this site, so all the haters feel free to give me as much negative karma as youd like lol :)<br />Thanks for your replies!<br />PS sorry bout the long message

				Number 4 is a number 3 but refined 1 time extra, usually with chloroform (in the golden triangle)<br />A number4 from the golden triangle (Birma, Northren Thailand ,Laos) in not smoke-able on foil.<br /><br />Personally I like the alkaloids, that gives the dreamy feeling.<br />For that you will need the number 3.<br />The extra cleaning to obtain a number4 removes to much of those alkaloids.<br />In nr4 you will find less papaverine, thebaine, codeine etc , but more pure diacetylmorphine.<br /><br />Nr4 will put you asleep, but when you wake up it seems you have missed the dream.<br />A nr 3 will make you nodding your head, but you will &quot;&quot;live&quot;&quot; your dream and remember it.<br /><br />Snorting you can do both, but nr3 is better, at least I like it more.<br />To snort nr4 is more dangerous, because once in your body it can kill you quick, before you get your hands on &quot;&quot;Naltrexon&quot;&quot;<br /><br />For shooting is nr4 better, you don&#039;t need acid, just plain water.<br /><br />Like one nr3 is not the same as a other nr3, so it is with nr4 too.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know wat you have, try a tip like the seize of a match-head, and take more from there.<br /><br />Smoking on foil is my favorite way, because it can not kill you. You will pass out before you can take more from which you will die. <br /><br />A nr4 is not for smoking on foil.<br />It can be done if you add 50% other stuff like mannitol and caffeine

				black tar is smokable opiod. you can&#039;t call &quot;heroin&quot; black tar, you cant call heroin &quot;no3&quot; or &quot;no4&quot;. There is NO HEROIN in the streets. Heroin was just a brand name 100 years ago for pure diacetylmorphine - acetylized morphine. On the streets is just strong opiods who contain some diacetylmorphine and unknown other chemicals which may also include morphine codeine or other alkaloids.<br /><br />On topic if you can get black tar and you smoke - it&#039;s the best option for you because it contains diacetylmorphine (what you call heroin), also 3-monoacetylmorphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine - to sum it up it&#039;s more euphoric than regular no4 or no 3 street heroin because it has more type of opiods in it.
