				1: You need to take a SHIT LOAD of MDMA to actually die from it, the death cause is usually from the body getting too hot or the other way around, too much water.<br />From what i remember you need around 7 grams of MDMA to actually be able to die from it. Trust me 2/3 grams in one night turns grown men into psycho baby&#039;s&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />2: Don&#039;t fear the press, i have had a lot &#039;and i mean a lot&#039; of green apples in my life, since i was a youngster, from an inpress to an outpress, from light green to apple green, specks you name it.<br />Always were fun little pills, the green apples of the last couple of years were around 140mg, have been less in the golden days. Recent pressed apples however are slightly higher dosed.<br /><br />Anyway, just don&#039;t purchase some weird ass press from your local embalming liquid smoking crackhead, always a risk to buy garbage if you don&#039;t know the right people and or life in a nonsource country.<br /><br />Praise the Road! i mean the lord!<br />~ O.S.<br />

				What actually kills a person depends on whatever they used in making these tablets.<br /><br />I seriously doubt an overdose of mdma itself could be responsible, but perhaps there is something else in them that is far more dangerous - i suppose we we can only find out after analysis of that specefic tablet.

				I suppose you cannot rely on a tablet solely on its appearance at all. It is perfectly feasible to make a tablet with the proper imprint, dimensions and weight as the one actually desired.<br /><br />I suppose the the least dangerous outcome of that would be an inert pill, but as that would not yield any return customers some substance is often used. <br /><br />The oddest story i&#039;ve heard is 50 mg valium tabltes sold as xtc on dutch pop festivals. Obviously these tablets do no not work at all, and actually do the the exact opposite of what is claimed. The vendors of these tablets factored that in though, and vacated the premises well before anyone would be able to get up and complain.

				they were just &#039;apples&#039; back in 95, not green apples. and yeah they were strong and i couldn&#039;t say for sure that they were pure mdma. up to a few years before that all the pills were blinding and clean as fuck. but around that time is when all the pills started getting fucked up and nasty. snowballs, M25s, apples, they were all pretty headfuck pills back then. i stopped using them completely pretty soon after that as i was getting the nastiest pains and fucked up stuff after using them.
