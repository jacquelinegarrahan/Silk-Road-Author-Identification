				So, probably about 12 years ago I took a pill that was &quot;sold&quot; to me as ecstasy. I&#039;ve wondered if it was indeed ecstasy ever since... It was a clear gel capsule but it did not contain powder. It contained what I can only describe as black flakes of something. The pill was very lite and almost felt empty in my hand. The effects were wonderful! Everything felt great; it even felt great to breath. I&#039;ve never experienced anything like it since. I lost all inhibition and couldn&#039;t keep my hands off the girls around me even though they were &quot;just friends&quot;. Somehow they put up with it.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried E once since then (pill, not gel cap) but felt nothing. My friends didn&#039;t get much from that batch either so I think they were crap pills. Anyway, any idea what I might have taken? I don&#039;t see how it could have been MDMA because I don&#039;t think the pill weighed enough but maybe I&#039;m wrong.

				Your description is reminiscent of MDMA. Pills or &quot;rolls&quot; are notoriously poor quality and can be filled with mixtures of anything including but not limited to: MDMA, cocaine, BZP, caffeine, DXM, and viagra.

				So has anyone seen ecstasy sold in clear gel caps with black flakes in them? This was in the northeast about 12 years ago.<br /><br />Does anyone think my logic of the capsule having been too lite to be ecstasy make sense? Perhaps the weight difference between enough and not enough is indiscernible by just holding it in your hand and I&#039;m way off base.

				Ecstasy can be dyed any colour - some might dye it to identify their batch but that just means everyone with bad gear will dye it - like speed when we had pink champagne speed - soon after pink speed was everywhere as people discovered that spraying with food dye gave speed the &#039;look&#039;<br /><br />Sounds like MDMA you took&nbsp; :)

				Could have been MDMA. Could have been another MDxx. Either way, sounds fun!<br /><br />But MDMA is great and you should try it again. Get it from a good vendor here.
