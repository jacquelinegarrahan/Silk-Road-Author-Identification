				For those of you who do not know me, I am a biologist who has been vending herbal/orthomolecular supplements of my own design on the SilkRoad for over 2 years. My supplements were initially intended to prevent and reverse the neurological strain produced by the frequent use of recreational drugs and to restore the neurochemical deficits which preclude sleep and drive people to use pharmaceutical sedatives. I also answered to the best of my ability any questions that I was sent, from buyers and nonbuyers alike. Many of my customers reported that my products (or my advice) were effective at reversing long-standing neurological deficits, or enabled them to reduce or cease their dependence on psychotropic pharmaceutical drugs, or stimulated them to change their diet and/or lifestyle for the better. By all accounts they were highly effective at preventing hangovers or &#039;burn-out&#039; due to drug-provoked metabolic insufficiency. <br /><br />The theoretical basis behind my supplements is, briefly, that neurodegeneration is produced by sub-optimal diet, environmental toxins, chronic stress, and lack of fulfillment in everyday life. The ingredients in my supplements were intended to produce a neurochemical environment approaching that which would be produced by a diet high in fruit and medicinal plants. To that end, I have also made many posts here over the years about nutrition, which can be found through my profile. The following is a recreation of the general advice I gave to customers who asked about nutritional supplements. <br /><br />Vitamin C - Ascorbic acid is a derivative of glucose which participates in numerous hydroxylation reactions in all plants and animals, including the hydroxylation of collagen and dopamine. It is also an important antioxidant that can reduce oxidized vitamin E.&nbsp; Only apes, humans, and guinea pigs, who cannot synthesize vitamin C, require it from their diet. From the ascorbate intake of wild non-human primates, optimal human ascorbate intake has been estimated to exceed 20 grams per day. Cardiovascular disease is the direct result of ascorbate deficiency. Deficiency also exacerbates diabetes, cancer, and schizophrenia, all related to a perturbed redox environment.The vascular effects of ascorbate (and perhaps others) require the presence of certain flavonoids, colored substances in plants that are particularly abundant in wild fruit. Brain levels of ascorbate are an order of magnitude higher than peripheral levels, and ascorbate insufficiency is a major contributor to neurological as well as psychiatric morbidity. It is impossible to achieve sufficient ascorbate intake by eating domesticated fruit alone, and supplementation is imperative for&nbsp; 99.99+% of the population. Take several grams a day, preferably divided over several doses. Avoid calcium ascorbate.<br /><br />Alpha Lipoic Acid - ALA is a cofactor in alpha-keto-acid dehydrogenase enzymes, essential for the extraction of energy from fats and sugars, as well as a versatile antioxidant which can restore many other antioxidants through redox cycling. Like ascorbate, it accelerates recovery from ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model for strokes and more generally for intermittent energy insufficiency. ALA therapy was in the past used successfully to treat schizophrenia. ALA is decreased in diabetes, which predisposes to all the major neurodegenerative diseases. It is also destroyed by toxins.&nbsp; &#039;stabilized&#039; Na-R-ALA is the only form that should be used; non-stabilized RALA readily polymerizes irreversibly, and should not be used. 20-40mg should be sufficient for relatively healthy individuals with high antioxidant intake.<br /><br />Flavonoids - Flavonoids are diphenolic compounds which produce the colors of many fruits and plants. They are required for many of the effects of vitamin C, and are extremely potent antioxidants, some effective at picomolar concentrations, trapping &#039;missed&#039; radicals and cycling them through the more abundant antioxidants. Many flavonoids also exhibit metal chelating properties, in particular OPCs. Consumption of a wide variety of flavonoids is essential for optimal bran health; eating berries and raw juices is better than supplementation.<br /><br />Vitamin D - Cholecalciferol is produced when dehydrocholesterol is oxidized by UV light. Humans, whose skin is not covered in fur, are very effective at synthesizing vitamin D. However, we tend to remain indoors and/or cover most of our skin with clothing, and so nearly everyone is deficient to varying degrees in D3. Cholecalciferol participates in calcium metabolism, and&nbsp; deficiency increases Ca++ deposition in soft tissue and causes a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone. Low levels also produce Seasonal Affective Disorder, especially in the winter. 2000-5000 IU/day.<br /><br />Selenium - A mineral that acts as a cofactor in a number of redox-related enzymes; required for the recycling of glutathione and the activation of thyroid hormone (T4-&gt;T3). Tends to be decreased in schizophrenia. Should be obtained through diet - mushrooms and coconut. If supplementing, ~200ugj/day.<br /><br />Vitamin B1 - cofactor in ketoacid dehyrogenases; required for the catabolism of sugars. Deficient in diabetes, alzheimer&#039;s, and schizophrenia. Alcohol destroys thiamin and can produce encephalopathy. Can improve energy levels. 10-70mg/day.<br />&nbsp;<br />Vitamin B2 - participates in redox reactions and extraction of energy from carbohydrates. Deficient in eg. alzherimer&#039;s, schizophrenia. 10-40mg/day. <br /><br /><br />Vitamin B3 - the most ubiquitous vitamin, part of NADH, involved in the majority of redox (energy transfer) reactions in living cells. Depleted by excessive energy demands. When intake is low (as in meat-eaters) niacin is produced from tryptophan in a B6-dependent reaction pathway. Diabetes is closely linked to low niacin levels. Was used effectively to treat acute and chronic schizophrenia in the &#039;50s and &#039;60s, and can &#039;abort&#039; some aspects of psychedelic trips. 20mg-250mg/day; 500-1000 in diabetes or schizophrenia, or to abort a trip<br /><br />Vitamin B6 - participates in a variety of metabolic reactions, in particular of amino acids, including all transamination reactions and most decarboxylations. Lost through oxidation during periods of oxidative stress. Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, the commonly used synthetic form, can functiion as an anti-vitamin and has been found to be neurotoxic at doses as low as 50mg.&nbsp; P5P is the active form; it is around 1000x the price of PxnHCl. 15-40mg/day P5P.<br /><br />Vitamin B9/Vitamin B12 - participate in transmethylation reactions; deficiency causes homocystinemia, &#039;brain fog&#039;, anemia. B9 high in leaves; B12 is produced by intenstinal bacteria, although virtually all individuals produce sub-optimal amounts due to damaged gut fauna. <br /><br />Vitamin E - prevents unsaturated lipid peroxidation and fragmentation. Rapidly destroyed when vitamin C is deficient. Deficient in individuals with a diet high in unsaturated fat. Supplement D-tocopherols and D-tocotrienols, not DL-.<br /><br />Theanine - the major amino acid in tea. Antagonizes the excitatory effects of glutamate. Increases EEG alpha activity. Produces a state of relaxation. Increases resistance to stress; improves cognitive performance in anxious subjects. Can facilitate sleep.&nbsp; 20-100mg/day if you have trouble sleeping; better from tea than from a supplement. White tea has the least caffeine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Magnesium - dication which antagonizes many of the effects of calcium. Needed to remove calcium from soft tissues, along with vitamins D and K. In cells Mg is bound to ATP, stabilizing it. Required for the activation of thiamine. MDMA and other stimulants may increase the requirement of magnesium due to increased cellular activity and energetic demands. If supplementing, use magnesium chelate or citrate, not magnesium oxide.<br /><br />Adaptogenic herbs: Rhodiola Rosea, Bacopa Monneri, Ashwagandha, Eleuthero Senticossus, Ginkgo Biloba, Jiaogulan, Tulsi, etc - Traditionally used for hundreds or thousands of years as anti-stress,&nbsp; pro-endurance agents. All have a long history of safe use. Consult an herbalist before consuming large amounts of these. <br /><br />Nootropic mushrooms: Lion&#039;s Mane, Cordyceps Sinensis, and Reishi -&nbsp; Contain a multitude of neurotrophic factors. Long history of use as nootropics. Accelerate recovery from neurological injury. <br /><br />Algae (Chlorella and Spirulina) - &#039;natural multivitamin&#039;; exceptional sources of most vitamins and minerals; can be taken at several grams per day.<br /><br />Coconut oil - mainly short- and medium- saturated fatty acids; can immediately be used as energy, like sugars; increase energy levels regardless of glycolysis, via ketosis; may prevent and reverse alzheimerism.<br /><br />SUPPLEMENTS TO AVOID: <br />I won&#039;t go into detail here, although I&#039;ve written about some of these on the forums; if you seek, you will find.<br /><br />5-HTP<br />L-Tryptophan<br />L-DOPA<br />Fish oil/Flax oil <br />Iron<br />Calcium<br />Pyridoxine HCl (at 50mg+ dosages)<br />Huperazine A<br />Resveratrol<br /><br /><br /><br />The &#039;Road&nbsp; provided a unique opportunity to study the intersection of metabolism, herbs, drugs, health, disease, society, and consciousness, and I am honored to have had the chance to help and learn from so many of you. In particular, I am grateful for all of my return customers, whose detailed feedback was essential for the development of my supplements and the evolution of my understanding. <br /><br />I may vend again in the future; my email is Tryptamine@privatdemail.net. <br /><br />Until then, may your minds always be fed. <br /><br />Namaste,<br />-Tryptamine
