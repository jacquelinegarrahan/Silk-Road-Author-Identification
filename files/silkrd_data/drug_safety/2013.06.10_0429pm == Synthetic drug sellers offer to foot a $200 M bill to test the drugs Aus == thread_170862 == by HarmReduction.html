				Any Comments&nbsp; :) or is this already being done by SR Vendors ;D<br /><br />Synthetic drug sellers have offered to foot a $200 million bill to test the legality of their products in a bid to keep selling them to Australians.Following the death of north shore student Henry Kwan, who jumped off a third-floor balcony on Wednesday after taking a synthetic LSD tablet, the association representing sellers of so-called &#039;&#039;legal highs&#039;&#039; will launch a major offensive against proposed new laws to ban synthetic drugs.<br /><br />Eros, the national adult retail and entertainment association, will distribute hologram stickers to mark packets of drugs that have been scientifically tested, implement an industry-wide &#039;&#039;code of practice&#039;&#039; for selling synthetic drugs and mount a legal challenge to proposed legislative changes that make it harder to sell the drugs.<br /><br />A recent state government inquiry recommended outlawing almost all synthetic cannabinoids and giving the Minister for Fair Trading power to issue on-the-spot bans on products in adult shops, tobacconists and other stores.<br />Advertisement Robbie Swan, co-ordinator of Eros, said simply banning synthetic drugs would not stop their spread in Sydney and they should be regulated and taxed.<br /><br />Synthetic drugs are products containing chemicals artificially developed to mimic the effects of cannabis, cocaine and methamphetamine. They exist in a grey legal area because manufacturers tweak their recipes to circumvent illegal drug classifications.<br />One new synthetic drug emerges on the European market every week and the two drugs believed to be involved in Henry Kwan&#039;s death, 25I-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe, are among hundreds coming in to Australia.<br />&#039;&#039;The tough-on-drugs policy is rendered null and void with these new drugs,&#039;&#039; Mr Swan said.<br />&#039;&#039;You can&#039;t just keep banning them. The government needs to work with the people who are manufacturing and selling these things to make them safe. We&#039;re trying to implement a form of industry self-regulation in the absence of any sensible government regulation.&#039;&#039;<br />Mr Swan urged NSW to follow the lead of New Zealand, where the onus of proof has been reversed and retailers can sell synthetic drugs if they have proved they are safe and contain legal compounds only.<br />He said sellers were willing to foot the bill for scientific testing - about $2 million per drug - because the returns were so lucrative. The annual turnover in Australia is $700 million and there are about 100 synthetic drugs in circulation, Eros said.<br />If the drugs were regulated and taxed like alcohol, the return for the government would be $200 million a year. Under the plan, each tested drug would have a hologram sticker, carry a list of ingredients, a warning label and dosage guidelines and be sold responsibly as per a &#039;&#039;code of practice&#039;&#039;.<br />However, the inquiry decided against taking the New Zealand approach and the committee chairman and Liberal MP, Dominic Perrottet, slammed Eros&#039; self-regulation scheme as dangerous.<br />&#039;&#039;The committee totally agrees with the idea that we need to give certainty to people - but we don&#039;t give certainty by saying some formerly illicit drugs are now OK to take,&#039;&#039; he said. &#039;&#039;We need a solution now. Another boy has just died.&#039;&#039;<br />NSW Fair Trading Minister Anthony Roberts is pushing for an interim 90-day ban on selling synthetic drugs.<br />Mr Roberts is consulting police, NSW Health and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission but a spokesman said a ban was likely &#039;&#039;sooner rather than later&#039;&#039;.<br />Breaking the interim ban on selling the products over the counter would come with fines of up to $1.1 million.<br />&#039;&#039;I want to impress upon the public that every time they are considering using these products, they are risking their lives,&#039;&#039; Mr Roberts said.<br />&#039;&#039;People will need to step up and realise that they are endangering themselves if they consume these.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was willing to work with states to prevent synthetic drugs circulating. Nearly one in 10 17-year-old boys and one in 20 17-year-old girls admitted to taking hallucinogens in the federal government&#039;s survey of secondary school students last year.<br /><br />(Clear Web) http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/legal-high-shops-mull-200m-campaign-20130607-2nvi9.html#ixzz2Vpc7MUqv

				I think this is really ridiculous.<br />Yeah, let&#039;s continue to prohibit the safer drugs but regulate and tax the dangerous ones? Am I the only one who thinks this is retarded?
