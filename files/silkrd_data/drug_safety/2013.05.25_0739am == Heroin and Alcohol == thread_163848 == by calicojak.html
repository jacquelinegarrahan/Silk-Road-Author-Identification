				So lets say I&#039;ve been taking a few bumps of #4 everyday for a week and tomorrow I have a buddy coming to town and we are hitting up the pub for some drinking all day. Would it be safe for me to take a bump earlier in the day a couple of hours before we start drinking so that I don&#039;t feel shitty? We will more than likely be drinking heavily.

				Can cause respiratory arrest. Both are depressants by different mechanisms. Heroin inhibits GABA, and alcohol inhibits glumate excitation. Or it induces vomiting, which, in addition to you passed out, causes you to basically drown in your own vomit. Watch your dose, don&#039;t overdo it and you should be fine. <br /><br />Edit. Even if you don&#039;t die you risk aspiration pneumonia. Then being in hospital further exposes you to hospital acquired infections. Stay safe.

				Thanks for the thorough answer! Friday morning I will take one small bump and then Friday afternoon/evening I will have a few cocktails. This shouldn&#039;t cause any medical issues right? Ive been taking 3-5 bumps everyday for a little over a week, before that I hadn&#039;t touched h in over a month. Im a very infrequent user.

				Not sure if you&#039;ve developed tolerance so quick in a week. Like you said a small bump at noon then few cocktails in the evening should be fine. If you want to get shit faced drunk then I would recommend skipping H that day. Everything in moderation. :)

				Yes, go very light on both the dope and the booze, as a good % of heroin related deaths are attributed to combining booze and H. stay safe.

				So if I don&#039;t snort any h the day I go out drinking I can drink as much as I want? Or if I snort one bump early in the day and then have a couple cocktails later in the evening I should be fine?<br />Do I have this right?<br />Thanks

				Seems like you would be ok, you know your body better than any one else..<br /><br />If your nodding or have a noticeably low or shallow heart rate/breathing then dont have more than a drink or two.. if you feel fine, ie not nodding or even doped out and just did enough to get straight then you should be able to hammer a few drinks.

				Good harm reduction advice here.&nbsp; One thing I would add is make sure you stop the H for good after that early dose.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go back to it later when you are feeling good.&nbsp; I have noticed alcohol and H have a significant multiplication effect and you can quickly become way more intoxicated than you anticipated if you are combining them.<br /><br />The safest approach here is start your day with the small H dose, and put it away for good.&nbsp; Also, when you start drinking, go slower than normal at first and make sure you are grounded before you really pour it on.<br /><br />I have felt some significant respiratory depression and reduced cardiac rate after combining only one beer with some H #4 and it is alarming.&nbsp; Pay attention to your body as always.
