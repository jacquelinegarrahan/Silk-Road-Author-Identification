				Hi<br />as much as I love and appreciate all the positive effects of LSD on myself, there is meanwhile one thing I really hate while tripping<br /><br />It is this constant urge to urinate. And this is really annoying! Was yesterday in a big park, took my blotter, enjoyed everything but needed on the other hand to find a hidden place away from all the people where I could trip and go to urinate every 10-15 minutes. Later my urine-break became longer but still every 30 minutes I needed to pee. I also hardly drank something. I realize it is an effect connected to LSD but damn, it is annoying. <br />In this way I think I will never go to a trance party ((&nbsp; &nbsp;Just imagine myself running every 10 minutes to pee while other people dancing and tripping ))<br /><br />Once the bladder is empty, it feels that its far away from being that properly empty. So I stand and urinate, wait 15 seconds, there comes again a bit, again waiting 20 seconds, there comes again and again. <br /><br />So, do you guys also have this kind of effects while on LSD or is it just my weird body?????<br /><br />damn, I love LSD but this one effect is really annoying (((<br />

				Towards the end of my trips I sometimes have to pee a lot.&nbsp; Not that frequently though.<br />You could have a weird bladder situation that doesn&#039;t show up unless you&#039;re tripping, but it could just be that you&#039;re focusing on it too much.

				I tried not to focus on it. Sat on a bench,was enjoying a brilliant view with a lake and mountains. 10 minutes later I could not enjoy it anymore - had to pee again and really urgently, damn it )))))<br />but you know, its just not this frequent urge to urinate, its also a discomfort in the bladder, as if it would not be properly emptied<br /><br />but maybe you are right and it could be this weird bladder situation, I guess I have to ask our DoctorX from the forum<br /><br />cheers<br /><br /><br />

				For me it&#039;s the opposite, I could be on it for 10 hours, and only pee once or twice. <br /><br />My big thing is my teeth pain on the left side whenever I do it .

				You become way more sensitive to the messages your body is trying to send you when you are tripping.&nbsp; Many of us don&#039;t know that we use what it basically self-hypnosis with out ever having learned it to block out annoying messages or messages we don&#039;t understand.&nbsp; For example, a tooth ache or back pain may become noticeable for the first time tripping.&nbsp; I am 99% percent sure you need to get a prostate blend of vitamins.&nbsp;

				the only thing i ever noticed what that i would constantly feel the need to stretch out my legs on the come down. it would usually be around 4-6am since we would take during the evening or at night.<br /><br />im not sure but i think lsd could be the reason why i experience anxiety now because it opened my mind to see so differently. i think ive only tripped 10-20 times varying from 1-2hits per trip. (this was all before finding an online market place too)

				Yeah, it is not completely unusual for lsd to change people in small and sometimes large ways they are uncomfortable with.&nbsp; That is why I always recommend the 2Cs and Shulgin&#039;s magical half dozen.&nbsp; When LSD opens us and increases our awareness it can add the need to be more responsible all of the time with it.&nbsp; With increased freedom comes increased responsibility.&nbsp; You might say that doesn&#039;t make sense but I just mean that it&#039;s natures way.&nbsp; During a psychedelic experience the most important thing is to accept everything that happens that way you are less likely to be left with anxiety afterwards.&nbsp; Panic attacks actually happen before those having them know what it is they are anxious about yet.&nbsp; Luckily anxiety is pretty loud and clear.&nbsp; Maybe when you smoke up you can remember how it started and go back and accept it or maybe you can accept it now.&nbsp; I am by no means a wizard here.
