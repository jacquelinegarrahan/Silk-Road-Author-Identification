				I&#039;ve stumbled upon the following DMT listing by EnterTheMatrix(99) (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/351ee799c9) and it concerned me so I&#039;d like to know more from fellow SR users.<br /><br />The listing is titled &#039;Matrix™ DMT Freebase ½ Gram ^_^ *Amazing!*&quot; and the description is written in a very sensationalist and pitchy style. But what&#039;s most concerning is price, and picture of the product shown. <br /><br />PRICE: Half-gram of this substance is listed as $135.00 while cheapest DMT on SR is about $70 per GRAM, and purest DMT I could find is sold for ~$30 per quarter-gram by BuddhaNature - this stuff is fine, white, completely free of any additives (tried it myself).<br /><br />PICTURE: What&#039;s shown looks like DMT that was barely purified. It&#039;s chunky, it&#039;s dark-brown, it&#039;s not something I&#039;d smoke (and wouldn&#039;t recommend to first-timers). Yet listing claims &quot;This is NOT changa, it is strong and pure DMT.&quot;<br /><br />So, two scenarios are possible:<br /><br />1) It&#039;s a scam that feeds on newbies who don&#039;t know any better to push shitty product for double the price<br />2) There&#039;s something I don&#039;t know / I&#039;m terribly wrong<br /><br />Could someone tell me their opinion? I don&#039;t know anything about the seller, and I do see quote a few early finalizations in feedback.<br /><br />I&#039;m posting compete text of the listing and picture below, in case it gets taken down.<br /><br />Description:<br />█║▌│ █│║▌ ║││█║▌ │║║█║ │║║█║█║▌│ █│║▌ ║││█║▌ │║║█║ │║║█║█║▌│<br /><br />*Aussie Matrix™ Exclusive Product* *Top Quality DMT Freebase* *Limited Aussie Stock!*<br /><br />AVOID AUSSIE CUSTOMS = LOCAL DELIVERY<br /><br />$$$ SAVE CASH - BUY A GRAM (BULK PRICE): http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4e1ad7e193 $$$<br /><br /><br />*** AusPost Express POST with Tracking NOW Available ***<br /><br />Get LOCAL Delivery - Proven Reliable Aussie Track Record - Quality Product<br /><br />Dear Psychonaught&#039;s,<br /><br />YOU asked for it! So, now we proudly present to YOU... MATRIX DMT FREEBASE :)<br /><br />You will receive:<br /><br />- 500mg (Half Gram) of Matrix™ DMT Freebase<br /><br />$$$ Save Ca$h - Try our larger DMT listings! $$$<br /><br />This is NOT changa, it is strong and pure DMT.<br /><br />500mg (Half gram) of DMT freebase, 30-50mg in the pipe for the most intense psychedelic trip of your life.<br /><br />This product can be truly LIFE CHANGING...<br /><br />*** WHAT IS DMT? ***<br /><br />DMT is a powerful, visual psychedelic which produces short-acting effects when smoked. It is used orally in combination with an MAOI, as in ayahuasca brews. It is naturally produced in the human body and by many plants.<br /><br />*** EFFECTS OF MATRIX DMT ***<br /><br />Depending on the dosage and form of ingestion, the effects of DMT can range from a multitude of sensations, from light, subtle perceptual changes, to bizarre, beautiful and even &#039;impossible&#039; visions , and to literally jaw hanging awe as one is propelled into other dimensions of existence where human language and logic cannot even begin to describe or comprehend.<br /><br />There have been a few attempts to define different levels and types of experience. Psychedelic Monographs and Essays discuss different levels of a DMT experience.<br /><br />The insight and connection to third dimensions and higher powers will BLOW YOU AWAY!<br /><br />It&#039;s time to TRULY.... ENTER THE MATRIX™!<br /><br />*** THE VISUAL STAGES OF A DMT TRIP ***<br /><br />0 - 20 seconds<br />a scratchiness in the lungs<br /><br />20 - 30 seconds<br />a buzzing starts in the ears, rising in tone and volume to an incredible intensity. Its like cellophane being ripped apart (or the fabric of the universe being torn asunder). Your body will vibrate in sympathy with this sound, and you will notice a sharp blood pressure rise. You may feel like you are deeply under water. Wearing a unitard or leotard and tights helps to minimize this sensation. Your visual field will also vibrate in resonance to the sound and will finally be completely obscured by the visions.<br /><br />30 seconds - 1 minute<br />You break through into DMT hyperspace. Often at this point, users believe that their hearts or breathing have stopped. This is not true. To an outside observer, you are breathing normally and your pulse, while elevated, is strong. We believe that this subjective effect is due to your &quot;internal clock&quot; being slowed so greatly that the subjective time interval between breaths or heartbeats seems like an eternity. Synthetic DMT has been extensively tested by medical authorities here and in Europe. It is perfectly safe with no lasting physical effects at these doses. However, since smoked DMT causes an abrupt blood pressure increase, it is probably not good for people with abnormally high blood pressure.<br /><br />1 minute - 2 - 5 minutes<br />depending on dosage: DMT hyperspace. For all practical purposes, you will no longer be embodied. You will be part of tne intergalactic information network. You may experience any of the following:<br /><br />Sense of transcending time or space<br />Strange plants or plantlike forms<br />The universe of formless vibration<br />Strange machines<br />Alien music<br />Alien languages, understandable or not<br />Intelligent entities in a variety of forms<br /><br />Do not be amazed and do not try to actively direct your observations but merely pay attention. The beings can show you amazing things, but if you try to impose vour personal trip on the DMT you will find that you cannot and may become frightened.<br /><br />At the end of the &quot;flash&quot; of the visions you will have an after-vision of circular interlocking patterns in exquisite colors. It has been described as looking at a vaulted ceiling or dome. If you did not &quot;breakthrough&quot; to the levels described above, this &quot;chrysanthemum&quot; pattern, as we call it, is all you will see. It is worth the trip, too.<br /><br />You may begin to wonder how you will ever find your way back to your body. If you have taken enough DMT to fully &quot;breakthrough&quot;, by the time you can even wonder about it, you are almost back. Trust in your own wetware; your psyche and your body will be reunited. Worrying will only prolong the process.<br /><br />*** METHOD OF CONSUMPTION ***<br /><br />Extracted DMT freebase can be vaporized for very potent effects that last around 10 minutes. DMT is ideally vaporized, as opposed to smoked. Vaporization is achieved by a controlled temperature that does not burn/combust DMT material (and potential impurities), but instead just makes DMT evaporate and be inhaled.<br /><br />Vaporization is much smoother than smoking. Smoking leads to break down of DMT (and impurity) molecules into potential toxic nitrogen oxides, so not only it is harsher but also there is a significant loss of actives.<br /><br />Vaporizing can be achieved with improvised vaporizers such as The Inspirator mkII, or commercially sold vaporizing pipes such as the VaporGenie.<br />( www.vaporgenie.com/Glass.html )<br /><br />DMT must be taken correctly and in the proper setting to ensure best results, please research via erowid and make sure to purchase or make a good pipe.<br /><br />Always take the red pill ;)<br /><br />DO YOUR RESEARCH - BE SMART, STAY SAFE!<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/dmt.shtml<br /><br />Please contact us for BULK orders!<br /><br />********<br />If you would like further information about our express shipping, handling and customer service or would like to read our positive testimonials received.

				Didnt read all of that post, but if you checked where this item is shipped from and where it is shipped to, you will find the word &quot;Australia&quot;. <br /><br />This is the reason why its probably more expensive then you OS people are used too. We pay top price because our customs are so strict and our policing also quite good. Just one of the bad things about living in Australia, but fuck we have kangaroos so eat that! <br /><br />Anyways ETM is the top rated and from memory longest serving aussie vendor, he is also known for top security, top shipping and top well everything. Hence why we dont mind paying extra, no matter who the seller is in Australia, we pay top price for several reasons including<br /><br />- Risk of importing (which vendor takes)<br />- Cost of vendors account (granted all vendors need to pay this)<br />- Normally high quality of the product<br />- Not having to go to some crazies house to get drugs<br />- Not having to leave my bedroom to get drugs<br /><br />All and many more reasons are why ETM is a top rated seller and why I personally go to him for many products. <br /><br />I dont know shit about DMT but if ETM is selling its no doubt top quality just like all other products he/she/it sells.<br /><br />Summed up, <br /><br />YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;m reasonably sure ETM source their DMT locally!<br />Either way Kingpin is 100% correct. Everything about Matrix is pure SR excellence.<br /><br />My only issue with matrix is that they never coughed up that litre of LSD like they promised me!!!

				Didn&#039;t breakthrough, but got crazy high, head lolling and intense closed eye visuals...<br /><br />At one point, eyes closed, I could see a doorway with light behind it... Afterwards, when I&#039;d ripped some hongas and settled down, I realised the doorway was right there, another full blast and I might have been able to step thru and visit Zebulon Prime!!!

				The brown means that it has a high plant fat content. I recrystallize my DMT and the stuff that comes out is this gunky brown goop.<br /><br />Some say it&#039;s psychoactive, some say it just reduces the actual DMT content of the spice. Who knows. The one thing that&#039;s for sure is that the whiter the powder, the higher the DMT content.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t sell quarter grams for $45! I sell halves for 5, which means he&#039;s selling less pure spice for almost three times what I am. I guess that&#039;s what happens when you have absolutely zero competition.&nbsp; :-X

				Okay folks, thanks for clarifying that the seller is not a fraud :) I&#039;m still not excited about this product, though.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27608.msg308441#msg308441">Quote from: BuddhaNature on June 26, 2012, 03:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, I don&#039;t sell quarter grams for $45!

Your quarter gram is currently priced at 30 USD and it&#039;s the purest stuff I&#039;ve ever seen on SR.<br /><br />The funny thing about how high the cost of DMT is in Australia - I just saw a quote from Erowid&#039;s Extracts magazine about it. The quote is &quot;DMT is everywhere&quot; and it&#039;s from the article &quot;Three Weeks of Plant Geekery&quot;. It talks a bit about how DMT and Changa are deep within Australian subculture. Hence my surprise at the cost of this stuff on SR for Australians.

				Mstf1, I agree with you, the flashy marketing and the sensationalist sales pitch makes me pretty uncomfortable. For many people DMT is a sacrament and it&#039;s disturbing to see it being flogged in this way for what must be a pretty sizable profit. <br /><br />Mstf1, you are right, DMT containing acacias are abundant in Australia and there are many people practiced in extracting DMT from our native plants. Most of the people I know here who are involved in the use of changa and DMT treat it with utmost respect - most are reluctant to accept money for it. It&#039;s usually given away or traded with trusted friends and acquaintances.&nbsp; Selling it at jacked-up prices like any other street drug seems kind of disrespectful and means that it&#039;s quite likely to fall in the hands of people who won&#039;t treat it with the reverence it deserves and who will potentially have a very bad experience.

				ETM is a good bloke and nothing you can say will alter my opinion, why don&#039;t you try doing business with him? He&nbsp; turns a process that the majority of vendors dont give a fuck about , into an easy , worry free transaction.... I am happy to pay expanded prices, especially when it brings the peace of mind that dealing with ETM brings...
