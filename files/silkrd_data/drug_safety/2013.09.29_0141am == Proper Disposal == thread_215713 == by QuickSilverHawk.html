				A vendor sent me the wrong order by mistake - I imagine someone else ended up with mine. But I digress.<br /><br />I have no need for crystal meth(amphetamine). It&#039;s not a drug I personally take recreationally. Now I have some.<br />I want to toss it. Obviously I wouldn&#039;t want to be caught with it in my possession, but I&#039;d like to dispose of it &quot;safely&quot;.<br />Does it dissolve? Do I melt/dissolve it, flush it? Do I just chuck it in a public wastebasket and leave it at that?<br /><br />I feel sort of stupid for posting this thread, but I wouldn&#039;t want to cause toxic, undue environmental damage, is all.

				You could always just mail it to me. :D Really though, it&#039;s a pretty expensive drug to just toss. I&#039;d try to sell it if I were you, but I understand you probably want to get rid of it quickly.

I See you are a vendor.<br />Better yet, test it if you have the resources. There&#039;s lots of debate on here about real vs. fake meth.<br /><br />By the way, this isn&#039;t uranium on your hands. It&#039;s prescribed to children. You can flush it, guilt free, without poisining any aquifiers.

				Good point, I forgot about Desoxyn.<br />Testing it might be a good idea too, thanks. :)
