				Has anyone ever tried this? All I really need to know is a temperature, if the liquid pad will work fine for it, and if it stinks up the whole machine,&nbsp; just the bag, or the life of the liquid pad? Any help would be appreciated. Would love to blast off tonight in a slightly unconventional method.

				*Note I have never used a Volcano for DMT, this is just from things I&#039;ve read.<br /><br />It seems a recommended temp is anywhere between 320F(160C) and 375F(190C). The liquid pad should work fine. It apparently only really stinks up the filling chamber, which can be cleaned with alcohol. And finally it&#039;s best to use one of the smaller bags if you have one.

				Yes, I&#039;ve tried vaping NN-DMT in my volcano before I designed my own custom apparatus for DMT vaporization. <br /><br />The results:<br />1) (overall) I never perfected the technique with the volcano. As opposed to the 50mg typically required, 200mg was required to produce a sub-par experience. I went through 500mg in a sitting trying to get this to work and didn&#039;t have any breakthroughs (experimental or mental).&nbsp; <br />2) Temperature was varied between roughly 100 to 250F. The best results were achieved from 160-200F (with the 200mg). <br /># DMT vaporizes around 140-170 F, but these numbers DO NOT correspond to the temperature of the vape. <br /># DMT tends to start burning at a temperature that&#039;s not too far from when it&#039;s vaporizing<br />3) It badly stunk up my vape, despite my cleaning efforts, leaving a hard residue. This was NN-DMT from my own extraction after Re-X in hexane. <br /><br />I did a bit of reading on other forums and it seems no one really had any great (and verifiable) experiences to report.&nbsp;

				It worked. I was didn&#039;t breakthrough because I didn&#039;t realize that the 55 mg I loaded didn&#039;t vape completely in the first bag. You need to be in the 345-360 degree range. Definitely had an experience though, I just didn&#039;t realized I needed to repeat bags. The vape got REALLY dense on the standard 2 ft easy valve first bag (that&#039;s why I assumed that it had vaped completely), and about 30 seconds in, I got really close. However, it filled up the bag about 2 and 1/2 times more. If I could have gotten all the bags inhaled, I can tell I will get to where I need to be. I&#039;m trying again tonight and will let you know. Going to use standard 55 mg dose as I can tell the quality is good. I REALLY did not want to leave...EVER haha. So, to make a short story long, it works.<br />

Mine started very clearly burning up at the 250F&#039;s. Can you tell me more about what was going on when you were in the 345-360 range (e.g. smoke color, harshness, residue after vaporization, etc)?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was didn&#039;t breakthrough because I didn&#039;t realize that the 55 mg I loaded didn&#039;t vape completely in the first bag. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please do report back if/when you use a bigger bag if you manage to experience a BT. I also came pretty close with 200mg but with the amount used, I deemed it a pretty inefficient method.

				I&#039;ve tried vaporizing freebase DMT using &quot;Arizer Extreme-Q Vaporizer!&quot;, but I did it in half-assed manner and didn&#039;t use a bag or anything. Basically I&#039;ve placed the chamber on top of the heating element (as usual), placed a mesh inside, then filled it with some weed (since I didn&#039;t want liquid DMT dripping on the heating element), and heated the whole thing up to 160 C. I then placed about 50mg of DMT on top and waited about 5 minutes, after which I started inhaling from the tube. The smoke was very light and I couldn&#039;t really determine how much of it has evaporated since I couldn&#039;t see well.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole reason I bought this vaporizer was to be able to do DMT easily (and socially). Now I feel like I&#039;ve wasted money, but maybe I will learn the proper method and will get worth my money after all.<br /><br />However, that vape is great for smoking any kind of grass. The smoke is unbelievably smooth and even yummy - something I was very surprised at after using bong and water pipe.
