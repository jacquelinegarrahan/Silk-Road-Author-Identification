				Psychedelics produce three main types of hallucinations:<br /><br />1.) geometric patterns; <br /><br />2.) distortions of the appearance of objects in the world around you;<br /><br />3.) vivid, photo-realistic, animated images of people, scenery, and objects. Hallucinations of this type share the qualities of dreams and visual memory. This is what I mean by a &#039;dream-like&#039; hallucination. I find hallucinations of this type to be the most interesting.<br /><br />I rarely get dream-like hallucinations with LSD, unless I am tired while still tripping and on the verge of falling asleep. Rather, I tend to see three-dimensional geometric patterns with my eyes closed, and distortions of space and time. Magic mushrooms seem to work better for me.<br /><br />So, what psychedelic drugs, in your experience, tend to produce dream-like hallucinations? <br /><br />

The visuals are INSANE almost with a capital INSANE, comparable to DMT in visual factor and intensity but just a different kind of experience,&nbsp; geometric shapes and vapor trails when you move any part of your body, the world seems to be changing colors and your mind is unleashed. This is what I would recommend :)

				i must agree with dmt as well... maybe psilocybin too? after all, they are related. though i think the most dreamlike hallucinogens tend to be deliriants, which most people find unpleasant.

				To get good DREAM-LIKE hallucinations, like waking dreams, you have to combine MARIJUANA (eaten) with a strong dose of PSYCHEDELICS, especially mushrooms.<br /><br />If you do that, you will get &#039;visions&#039; and &#039;waking dreams&#039;, and not just the same old, lame old geometric shapes and colours.

				It depends on how strong/weak/persistent you want the experience to be really. <br /><br />For many people combining a few benadryl (or other classic antihistamines) with a moderate amount of alcohol will initiate a state where you are prone to falling asleep and have pronounced dreams. It&#039;s not required to use illicit substance to get pleasurable effects, they can happen quite easily when taking more than the recommended dosage of antihistamines and the &#039;unwise&#039; combination with alcohol. <br /><br />Also, its probably best to avoid taking downers like benzodiazepines if you want to achieve such effects. You&#039;ll probably want to end up in a state resembling REM sleep, and large doses of benzo&#039;s or alcohol will delay that sleep phase. <br /><br />You could consider trying to take 2 or 3 benadryl with a bottle of wine in the evening. The effects can be more interesting than you&#039;d expect from things legally available... and if they aren&#039;t, you&#039;ll have a night of proper sleep as the alternative :D

				i&#039;ve never taken a hallucinogen before, but i was wondering is there any hallucinogen that causes trips, like on the south park episode where kenny is cheezing and going to boobland or w/e, that episode always fascinated me and is that what DMT is like, but without the boobs?

				The effects are hard to predict. I&#039;ve seen people claiming that french fries were running on the wall of&nbsp; a snackbar after a single lsd blotter. You can get crazy hallucinations like that, but there is no guarantee what will actually happen. You may find yourself in a world where trains want to run you over from random directions just as well. <br /><br />Perhaps it depends on your mindset, but you could find yourself in a world where everything loves or hates you without a choice between them ;)

DMT brings me closer to that world than any other drug. It is different though, in that in Boobland things are pretty laid back, whereas my DMT trips are complete madness, like Boobland in fast forward with fireworks going off everywhere.<br /><br />I also think DMT is the drug that gives me the most dream-like hallucinations. When my gf smokes DMT she sometimes even laughs during her trip just like she does when she is asleep and mid-dream.
