				Hey guys!<br /><br />Long story short: I really want to try NBOMe, but what should I do for my first trip? 25i-NBOMe, 25b-NBOMe or 25c-NBOMe?<br /><br />What can you recommend?<br /><br />Thank you in advance! :)

				still to try 25b and 25c, but 25i i have. it is a playful, &#039;take-at-anytime&#039; drug. <br />would highly recommend doing it in a forest, were your line of sight is covered by trees. bring about some speakers with some good music, the sound is ubiquitous <br />trees will dance and swirl around. i remember before the 25i hit me, that i had seen most of the trees had a few patches of hairy moss on them. when i was tripping, every tree out there seemed to be completely covered by expanding and contracting moss of neon green color!!! the sight was just breathtaking!<br />but visuals are as far as you get. there&#039;s basically no body load, no mind fuck.<br /><br />in terms of which to take, i will forward you to a very thorough review that a fellow Roader very selflessly shared with the community :)<br />post #3: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=208150.msg1503200#msg1503200<br /><br />hope this helps<br />LL<br /><br />ps: if you can give karma, be sure to give some to the guy that made that &#039;chart&#039; :)

				I&#039;v done 25i many times, 25b once, and I suspect 25c once but I can&#039;t be sure, and also 25d.<br /><br />You can&#039;t go wrong with 25i. I&#039;ve never had anything less than a very enjoyable trip on 25i. I second the tip above on making it an outdoor trip if possible and having music to listen to. Nature and the music on 25i is a wonderful thing to experience, not even considering the mind blowing visuals and neon lightshows taking place in the air and in your head. <br /><br />I always get euphoria but my last 25i trip delivered the most intensely pleasureable state of conscious I&#039;ve experienced (1 mg tab).&nbsp;

				On 25i I like to lay down and get comfy during the come up, in-ear-headphones and let the closed eye visuals take over.<br /><br />I split a 1000ug tab in half, eat one and as I feel the drug come up I eat the other. Helps in lessening the body load effect (you wont feel the other half coming up as you&#039;ll be tripping hard already).<br /><br />Trip safe.

				+1 for all of you guys! &lt;3<br /><br />Thanks for your replies! I really think I&#039;ll go with T5&#039;s 25i 1,000µg tabs and take 1/2 for the first trip with my friends somewhere in the woods.<br /><br />And +1 for the guy in the link, london! ;) Thanks for that! Very helpful!<br /><br />Just one more question: How to store the NBOMe&#039;s best? Like LSD airtight and lighttight in the fridge?

That&#039;s what I went with on my first trip and I don&#039;t regret that. The comeup caught me off guard my first time even at 0.5 mg. It was pretty fantastic. In fact I think it&#039;s time I step it back down to 500 ug and try a low dose again one of these days.<br /><br />As far as storing it is concerned, NBOMEs are very hardy and nothing likeLSD in that regard. It&#039;s as hardy as MDMA imho. They should last as long as you want to keep then. Like all drugs, it&#039;s best to keep it in a dry place and away from constant/direct exposure to light. Put it somewhere dark in a dry, sealed baggie and I&#039;d imagine it would last many years (I&#039;d wager a lifetime or more).
