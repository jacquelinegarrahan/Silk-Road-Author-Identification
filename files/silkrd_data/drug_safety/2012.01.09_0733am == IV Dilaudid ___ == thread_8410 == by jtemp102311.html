				The only safe way to IV pills is to filter them with a micron filter to remove all the filler. You can use cotton, but it won&#039;t get everything out even if the shot looks clear. I always filter twice with cotton to get as much out as possible. Don&#039;t heat it either. It can break down the opiate and make more of the nasty stuff go into your shot. There are a couple good threads here already discussing safe IV practices. <br /><br />Honestly, it&#039;s probably safer to IV heroin than pills as long as it isn&#039;t cut with something that won&#039;t dissolve.<br /><br />Edit: boogie_nights said &quot;If you inject tablets, you should be using a SYRINGE FILTER.&nbsp; Filtering thru cotton just isn&#039;t enough.<br />If you have seen that slightly cloudy stuff in your syringe before your injection, that stuff is going right into your body and it builds up in your liver and also your LUNGS.&nbsp; Some if it&#039;s talc, povidine, SILICA, etc.&nbsp; BAD STUFF.<br /><br />I would really like to find someone, or maybe a couple of people, who would go in with me on a few hundred sterile .2 micron syringe filters. I can get them for about a $1.25 each, and they are sterile, .2 micron, 13 mm diameter, and they make the solution come out CRYSTAL-CLEAR.<br />If you are interested in going in on some, send me an email and we&#039;ll talk about it.&quot;<br />

				Crush pill to powder, put powder in shot glass add water suck up in 3 ml syringe.<br /><br />Put a rig together like this syringe with pill liquid in it then wheel filter then another 3ml syringe.<br /><br />Draw fluid into new syringe and repeat with new filter each time until clear.<br /><br />Then add needle tip and inject.

				For years it was popular to &quot;dry shake&quot; dilaudid. People would just add water and the crushed pill into the body of the syringe itself, then just shake it up and inject all of it. People thought they were getting it all because there are sometimes as many as 5 &quot;washes&quot; left in the powder when you use a spoon and filter to draw it up. The problem is that all this buffer was ending up in people&#039;s lungs and causing massive scarring and eventually death. That is in heavy users of course. Plus I myself like the washes. It gives me something to put back and have when times get tight.
