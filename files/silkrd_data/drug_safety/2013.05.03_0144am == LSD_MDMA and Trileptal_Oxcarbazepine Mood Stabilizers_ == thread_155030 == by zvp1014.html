				Title: <strong>LSD/MDMA and Trileptal/Oxcarbazepine Mood Stabilizers?</strong><br />

				Hello all!<br /><br />After multitudes of SSRI/SNRI antidepressants with little to no efficacy, my psychiatrist has decided to try a mood stabilizer with me- namely Trileptal/Oxcarbazepine.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I know little about this substance or similar class drugs. I have, however, heard horror stories regarding Lithium and LSD (namely dissociative fugues where one wanders aimlessly and forgets who or what they are) so I thought I&#039;d ask your advice regarding the subject.<br /><br />Either in your experience or medical background, are Trileptal/Oxcarbazepine dangerous with LSD? Would the drug likely amplify, diminish or change the effects of acid? <br /><br />Additionally, while I&#039;m doubtful the two drugs are related, how might Trileptal affect MDMA usage (if at all?)<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />P.Sâ€“ Please, no comments regarding &#039;I&#039;d not recommend LSD at all if you&#039;re in such a mental state you need a mood stabilizer.&#039; I&#039;ve used acid aplenty in my current state of mind- and actually feel less prone to any anxiety or anger spikes during an acid trip than I do sober. Thanks!

				Ok, here is my 2 cents.<br />I am a sociopath who also sports bipolar type 1 disorder with psychotic features. I actually have fugues now and again.&nbsp; I have spent years in treatment and forced hospitalization and years without. Currently I am off grid and non-compliant. The only psych meds I keep around these days are anti-psychotics for my emergencies and customers bad trips. My brother keeps tabs on me, and my friends know my situation. So that is my background on mental health.<br />I remember that lithium and depakote did seem to fuck with tripping and drug use all around, I imagine that any mood stabilizer would do the same.. If you have been on mood stabilizers you know what I mean. In my opinion mood stabilizers are the devil in a pill. <br />My advice is knock down the mood stabilizers, and ramp up the lsd&nbsp; ;D<br />Honestly, psychedelics are incredibly therapeutic when came at with the appropriate mindset. Maybe the stupid fucking ssri/snri shit didn&#039;t work because your problems can&#039;t be solved with a pill from your doctor and his special interests. Maybe you just need to find peace or fulfillment or enlightenment or whatever it is that your psyche is missing. Sooo, yeah, more acid&nbsp; ;)<br />

				Do not combine psycs with mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics. They are antagonizing the same receptors that LSD is working on (e,g, 5ht-2a d1, d3,)<br /><br />
