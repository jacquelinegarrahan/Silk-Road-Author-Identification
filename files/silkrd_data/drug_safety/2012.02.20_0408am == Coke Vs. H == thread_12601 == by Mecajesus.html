				I was originally saving up for a gram of H, but then i thought maybe coke, the thing is i haven&#039;t really messed with coke and am worried about disappointment.<br /><br />The most coke i&#039;ve ever done was half a 50 bag with my buddy over a year ago.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been messing with Opiates for quite sometime and now have been snorting H for about 8 months or so.<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious what Coke&#039;s high is like compared to Opiates? Is it better, does it give you the same body tingly feeling as H?<br /><br />Just curious.

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much comparison in either the body high or the mental state.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done coke in years, and I&#039;ve never done H (although I have consumed a fair number of pharmaceutical opiates) - and the only thing I remember about coke is wanting to fuck anything and everything in any and every way possible.&nbsp; Opiates make me want to eat (everything tastes better with a vicodin) or work.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Two totally different experiences - or maybe I&#039;m just a little strange.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Coke + H = :)<br /><br />or the budget speedball (adderall + oxy/perc) -- shit&#039;s just as expensive these days though.

				It depends what you intend to do.&nbsp; I think the opiates are much better but also have a lot more side effects while on it.&nbsp; Coke is entertaining once in a while, but only if it is good and you are in a club or party.&nbsp; No one wants a headaches and clogged nostrils.&nbsp; Personally, I would rather relax than ramble and have delusions of grandeur but everything has a time and place.&nbsp; Opiates make you want to work and eat?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have that experience often...

				Yeah, like I said, I&#039;m a little strange.&nbsp; But I can take a couple of percs and sit at the computer and code for hours - or go get some sushi and have it totally enhance my meal. Whatever works, I suppose.&nbsp; :)

				Holy shit, working on opiates would be a head spin. One time I ran for 2 hours straight on 15 or 20mg of hydrocodone. I never want to do anything but draw/paint/art on opiates/all drugs now haha.<br /><br />Clean coke and H is amazing tho. Both make you feel so crazy in your head, but so euphoric. I draw like a madman haha.&nbsp; Especially on speedballs. Good stuff 8)<br /><br />Can&#039;t compare drugs. All have their unique qualities that make them that drug. They all get you insanely high in the end though :).

				haha shit, buddy... opiates + computers = nausea for me! I don&#039;t mind cleaning on opiates during that initial euphoria... but at some point I just want to lay down or have to in order to curb the nausea because I insisted on staring at the computer screen knowing it would make me sick
