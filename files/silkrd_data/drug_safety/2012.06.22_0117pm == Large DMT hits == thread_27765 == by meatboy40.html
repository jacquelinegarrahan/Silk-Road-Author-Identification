				I smoke as much as is physically possible to breakthrough, which, with my homemade DMT Machine is usually 3 large hits, held in as long as possible. <br /><br />I would consider a &quot;large hit&quot; to be one that fills the lungs completely, is held in for at least 10 seconds and still has visible vapor seen during the exhale (although even if you don&#039;t see vapor it can mean the hit has been absorbed completely into your lungs which is also good for a breakthrough).<br /><br />Each time I have broken through in this manner, the first few minutes are completely terrifying because the world as I know it has been replaced with something completely foreign and chaotic. Then things start to settle and I have some quite remarkable experiences in another dimension that I feel, have changed my life for the better. Hope this has helped.<br /><br />Happy travels!<br />

				the one time i&#039;ve broken through, i took 3 hits... which, according to mckenna, is the &quot;magic number&quot; so to speak.

				Depends on how far and fast you wish to go. 25mg will get you there, 30 will catapult you there and 35-40 will smash your mind into tiny fragments and flling them there at super luminal velocity. I wouldn&#039;t go below 20mg as its just frustrating. I can&#039;t say in hits as my set up delivers the dose in one shot (fractal smoke is pretty awesome).<br />The biggest hit was when I took an MAOI inhibitor, ate about 300mg, waited about an hour or so till it started to come on and then smoked 40mg. That trip lasted for about 2 or 3 hours which was a bit too long really. Pretty amazing trip though, traveled through space among bejewled insectoid spaceships, communed with an infinately giant sentient fractal pyramid and soared through the streets of an alien city made of living, waving skyscrapers.<br /><br />
