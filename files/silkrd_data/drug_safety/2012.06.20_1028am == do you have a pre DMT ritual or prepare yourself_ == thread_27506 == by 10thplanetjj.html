				Hey guys, so did some dmt today without really thinking about it, im sick in a bad head space and just did it.. normally i&nbsp; prepare myself and i try set out positive intentions be it whatever..anyway had, what i remember a momentary horrifying experience trying to fight where i was...(everything turned to sound and vibrations &quot;buzzing&quot;) and i found it hard to let go... just wondering what you guys normally do in this situation and if you have any ritual or thoughts you like to do before a session.

				Considering it&#039;s such a powerful substance I&#039;m usually pretty anxious before I do it, and I find thinking about it and planning for too long just makes me sick with worry. I just do a little deep breathing for about a minute and jump in. I&#039;ve yet to have a bad experience

				Honestly, I&#039;ve heard the Ayahuasca experience is better for things like this rather than smoking the DMT.<br />When you smoke the DMT, you&#039;re essentially launched into a trip, and it can be a total mindfuck, and with it only lasting a short time, it can leave you very confused and anxious. With the Ayahuasca route, it&#039;s a gradual onset, longer peak/plateau, then a gentle comedown, which may make the 4+ hour journey easier to comprehend. I haven&#039;t had the opportunity yet to do either, seeing as I sold my DMT to a friend, but I think you may want to try Ayahuasca (DiMiTriSpice sells pharmayahuasca pills, which has everything inside and no bad taste like with traditional brew.) I don&#039;t know how these are, but I would say it&#039;s worth a shot if you&#039;re wanting a long enough experience to try and let go and see the bigger picture.<br /><br />sdesu

I&#039;m not a superstitious or religious person, so I don&#039;t have any traditions in terms of burning special incense to ward off spirits, or smudging the area with certain materials to welcome positive energy. It&#039;s hard for me to believe that these things have any effect beyond placebo, so when I smoked, I usually: <br /><br />1) had about an hour of exercise, followed by a shower and a meal<br />2) an hour later, I dimmed the lights (a completely different experience from them on)<br />3) prepared my custom smoking device and all materials<br />4) practiced breathing techniques and meditation for about half an hour (or until I felt I was ready)<br />5) if I was feeling anxious still, I&#039;d load and smoke 10mg. Then I&#039;d load 20mg. Then 30... etc until I hit around 50. Since I always had plenty of DMT, conserving material was not as big a deal as a comfortable experience. if I wasn&#039;t anxious, I&#039;d go for 50 from the start. <br />&nbsp;

				1) I wear comfortable clothes and make sure that the temperature of the room is comfortable with said clothes on.<br /><br />2) I like to have another person there with me who has been instructed to be as quiet as they can and take the smoking device and lighter from me after my 3rd hit.<br /><br />3) I prefer a completely dark room. Pitch black.<br /><br />4) Ambient music playing.<br /><br />5) I meditate for a few minutes to prepare myself for where I am going and what I am about to encounter.<br /><br />6) I prefer to be pretty sober. I once smoked changa while I was on Mescaline, Valium, Opiates, whiskey and Red Bull and it was <br />frustrating because it felt like I went somewhere but could not remember it. I read on dmt nexus that Red Bull can have this effect. <br />

				I&#039;ve never yet not been scared witless before I use DMT but Ive never found anything to get rid of it, just lessen it.<br />I always like to trip in bed (in big loose pjamas) with a big pillow to lie down on, <br />set up a playlist of music before hand, nothing worse than heavy metal or crazy modern music appearing halfway through<br />make sure water is near by<br />make sure I have somewhere to put the hot pipe that will not set the house on fire or fall on me and burn me<br />pitch black room is best<br />breath deep and just do it, once it gets going all the anxiety just flows away
