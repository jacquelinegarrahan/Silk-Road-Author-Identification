				I know the &quot;words of wisdom&quot; are to snort it for the first time that one uses it. However, I have been doing IV Oxycodone for the past year.<br /><br />I have .25g of his fine Afghan #4 (hopefully) heading my way. <br /><br />I know that is 250mg. <br /><br />I intend to use this with 3 friends of mine. Initially I thought about 30mg of this substance would be what I would use, which puts the .25g at around 6 doses. Does that sound right?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing some reading though on these forums, and what folks have been saying, if true, and if I&#039;ve read correctly, it looks like some powder in a spoon which has the size of a match head is the idea starting dose.<br /><br />Three of us have a large tolerance to oxy, being able to iv 150mg and not even getting that high.<br /><br />I guess my question is this, how does Tony&#039;s H (not the pebble variety) compare to oxycodone on a mg vs mg&nbsp; basis?<br /><br />And also, approximatly how many doses will a .25 bag contain?<br /><br />Thanks for any and all information.<br /><br />

				its always better to snort and then shoot up later in the day. snorting allows you to judge purity without the dangers of IV. atleast have one of your friends snort from 10-20 mg(get a good scale) to judge how much you need for injecting. remember you can always take more but you can never go back and take less. goodluck and don&#039;t let it rule your life. it happens before you notice
