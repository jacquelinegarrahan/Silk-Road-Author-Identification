				Good point! +1<br />I didn&#039;t even think about the timing, I usually takes me about an hour to come up on 2c-b when I have swallowed it and about 20 minutes on M1.<br />So I would be better off taking the 2c-b first and then dropping the M1 40 minutes after, give or take.<br /><br />How about if the 2c is snorted, Will it hit quicker?

				Snorting the 2c-B will make it hit quicker and harder. In my experience, it&#039;s one of the most painful things I&#039;ve ever put up my nose. I&#039;ve flipped with 2c-B and both, Methylone and MDMA (together and separately). It&#039;s wonderful. The M1 and MDMA make the rolling/euphoria of the 2c-B even stronger, and the 2c-B adds a clear headed trip with some awesome visuals.<br /><br />Also, like Aurelius posted, I&#039;d check out PiHKAL. It&#039;s incredibly informative and will likely help you chose the right dosage and timing.<br /><br />Happy flipping!

				I have combined 2C-E and M1. I have also taken 2C-B. I consider 2C-E to be a stronger hallucinogen than 2C-B. It was a fucking wild ride for me. I took 20mg of 2C-E, a standard dose, I have done much more before, but this was all I had left. And just as I was coming up on the 2C-E I took the 220mg of M1. It made the trip much stronger but ultimately amazing. Can be overwhelming at stages (in a good way). <br /><br />So I recommend it! But know your dosage limits and when to exactly dose.

				Fuck dude I&#039;m sitting here reading this thread and like holy shit..do you guys ever worry that your guys&#039; hearts might give out ever? I&#039;m not &#039;preaching&#039; or talking down or anything like that you know what I mean..<br /><br />Idk when I do hard drugs I really pay attention to my heart for some reason. I trip the fuck out if my heart starts racing and get water and tell myself to calm down everytime...and I don&#039;t even do stimulants or anything besides weed(weeds everyday). I used to do E and lately have been experimenting with 25i...but I really get paranoid about my heartbeat and all that...I couldn&#039;t imagine COMBINING drugs of the same class in one night...call me a pussy but I&#039;ve had too many near-death experiences...Do you guys that are epxerienced with combining drugs ever worry about heart/overall body health while doing this? Just curious....

				This sounds like a potentially cardiotoxic combo IMO since both are known to have powerful effects on your cardiovascular system. Traditional &quot;candyflipping&quot; and &quot;hippyflipping&quot; are a lot safer of a bet for a psychedelic/MDMA experience. Combining 2 phenethylamines at once, one of them being an RC, could be a recipe for heart failure, heat stroke, or other nasty complications.<br />2C-B is a perfectly interesting drug on it&#039;s own anyways, and I see no real need to mix it EVER.<br />Please, be careful OP

				For what it&#039;s worth I&#039;ve done M1, 2CB and 5 MEO-MIPT all at the same time and fared well despite being an old out of shape fat guy. The visuals were glorious and the M1 kept me pretty happy and centered on enjoying the experience. If you are sitting at home with access to an ac or a cool bath I would say it&#039;s worth a try. At a dance / festival type location I would probably just stick with the M1 and maybe a smidgen of 2CB if you are brave which will still raise your core body temperature enough to be monitored. Most people who try these combos do so under the impression they should take full doses of everything but I had a good time with a smaller than normal does of all three. <br /><br />Just remain aware of your body temperature. If you start sweating a lot find a way to cool down pretty quick. Normally the sweats are just a temporary thing as you are coming up. If they last a while I would stay cool and refrain from re-dosing. If you do become a psychonaught experimenter like myself, I actually find 2CB or acid go along pretty well with M1, I like the emotionally happy push that the M1 brings to the psychedelic experience. It never hurts to have a sitter handy the first time you try s new combo. Someone who can point out that your hands a shaking like made as you try to setup a bump or let you know you&#039;ve been staring at a lamp for the last two hours taling about how you can see the spirits of the bulb trying to communicate with you.<br /><br />Play it safe though, start small and work your way up. Don&#039;t re-dose the 2CB / Acid as the same time you do more M1 as M1 doesn&#039;t last nearly as long as the other two so you can turn a nice night into a fractal disassociation with reality if you go too high on those two.<br /><br />Form a safety perspective though you should be fine in moderation. They all seem to add a little to the trip and make a good night great if well managed doses are applied. <br />&nbsp;

I would definitely avoid any nBOME combined with a member of the 2c-(X) family.<br /><br />Junjo, I&#039;m not sure what you mean by calling Methylone an &quot;RC.&quot; It is a Schedule 1 substance in the US just like MDA, MDE, and MDMA. Methylone is bk-MDMA (meaning it is an MDMA analogue, differing by the addition of a beta-ketone group, similarly MDMA is an analogue of MDA with the additon of the N-methyl group). According to Alexander Shulgin, the author of PiHKAL &amp; TiHKAL, &quot;Methylone has almost the same potency of MDMA, but it does not produce the same effects. It has an almost antidepressant action, pleasant and positive, but not the unique magic of MDMA.&quot; From personal experience, Methylone is like an nice glass of wine or two vs a couple Jäger Bombs. You&#039;ll feel something, but it won&#039;t be nearly the same. (But, that&#039;s just me.)<br /><br />To reference the 2C-B/MDMA combo of which I am very fond,&nbsp; Shulgin writes, <br /><br />&quot;The most successful reports have followed a program in which the two drugs [2C-B &amp;MDMA] are not used at the same time, not even too closely space. It appears that the optimum time for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the MDMA. It is as if the mental and emotional discoveries can be mobilized, and something done about them. This combination has several enthusiastic advocates in the psychotherapy world, and should be the basis of careful research when these material become legal, and accepted by the medical community.&quot;<br /><br />I hope this is of some help.
