				Curiosity is getting the best of me, which as we all know is not good. What combination between LSD, DMT, THC(about 1.3g of kief), and 25i-NBOMe would have the most synergy? Could I drop acid, wait 2 hours then drop the 25i and smoke the kief while I wait for the tabs to hit me, then smoke the dmt at the peaks of the two? Or only drop acid, smoke kief, then smoke dmt and hold off on the 25i? Or switch the acid with the 25i and smoke the kief and dmt?<br /><br />Sorry if this seems confusing, but basically can I do all in one sitting or should I hold off on one or two of the drugs? I&#039;m not that well known with the effects of 25i-NBOMe, so should I even combine anything with it? <br /><br /><br />To be more specific, here are the quantities of drugs I&#039;m discussing.<br /><br />2x 100µg tabs of LSD<br />1x 1000µg tab of 25i-NBOMe<br />1.3g of AK-47 kief (also have 8g of AK-47)<br />20mg of DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine)<br /><br />I plan on smoking the DMT in an oil-burner with a triple-jet torch lighter, will this be sufficient enough to breakthrough on alone? Also now that I think about it, would I be able to smoke Salvia during a trip on those tabs?

				I feel like you&#039;re entering a very fragile line.&nbsp; With the combination of effects from the lsd+25i+DMT you might loose it at least temporarily.&nbsp; But if you are confident in your mind you should have a good time!&nbsp; But if you want the best try to time it all and smoke the DMT like you said right as you start to peak/feel the effects of LSD/25i smoke the weed about 30 minutes before you feel like the LSD effects will hit so you will have a nice mellow undertone on it all.&nbsp; It would probably be a good idea to have a xanax or valium on hand just in case your trip takes a turn for the worse.&nbsp;

				God my original post is so jumbled, but it&#039;s always insightful to see what my mind is like during sleep deprivation. Luckily, it&#039;s 6:51pm and I just woke up which means I can think a bit more clearly.<br /><br /><br />Anyways, awesome response KClear! I did order a 10mg Valium pack from Pharmville yesterday, which should definitely arrive before I delve into my psychonautical adventure. As far as my previous experience goes, I&#039;ve dabbled with Lucy (LSD) a bit. I&#039;ve never tried 25i-NBOMe, but have recently started hanging out with Dimitri (DMT) and have been making love to Mary Jane (THC) for many years now. Unrelated experiences, I&#039;ve met Molly (MDMA) and am acquainted with Cristy (Meth). Early in life to treat my pretty severe Attention Deficit Disorder, I took enough amphetamine to be labeled a tweaker and loved to drink &#039;Coke&#039; at the clubs. Other than this I&#039;ve messed around with a couple of other substances like salvia, shrooms, and spice<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve already introduced Mary Jane to Lucy before, which made it far more psychedelic in my experience. However I&#039;ve never had the balls to introduce Lucy to Dimitri. Obviously I&#039;ve never mixed 25i with anything if I&#039;ve never done it. Hopefully this makes it a bit easier to decide which combination is safe enough to attempt. To be on the cautious side, I&#039;ll probably only have an orgy with Dimitri, Lucy, and Mary Jane. I&#039;ll get more experience with 25i before attempting something stupid with it. These drugs deserve at least that much respect.

				I definitely think you should try out the nbome by itself before mixing it with a bunch of other stuff. i think its a good idea to try the dmt with lsd if you are trying to take it to that next level. id say hit a little kief before, then on the come down then hit some kief and you should climb back up a little higher hopefully. <br /><br />i am not positive on this, but i was thinking the peak for nbome took longer to achieve than acid (never done 25i so i may be mistaken) but if so you would want to take that first and then the lsd the correct time after if you are trying to merge the peaks... for when you try the two together if you should decide<br /><br />then after you have tried these two double combinations should you find them to your liking (even on the same trip, just after your peak) then you could toss in some deemsters to the mix if you are really that crazy and think it will take you somewhere worthwhile and not just insane, if you even remember it<br /><br />Be safe please,<br />- miR
