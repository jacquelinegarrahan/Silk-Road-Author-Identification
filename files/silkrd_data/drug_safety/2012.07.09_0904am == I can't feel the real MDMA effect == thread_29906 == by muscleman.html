				Hey,<br /><br />3 days ago I was on a festival with some friends and 500mg MDMA. I decided to do it on the last day of the festival because of the hangover. A friend of mine and I snorted a 120mg line (I had a scale with me). After 15min (T+ 0:15) we both could feel the &#039;speedy&#039; effect. But after about an hour (T+~ 1:15) the effect was gone but my friend was still rolling. <br />So I waited an hour more to see if my friend was coming down too but she wasn&#039;t. So I took 150mg oraly and after 30min (T+ ~2:45) my eyes suddenly jiggled like wild and I had to move my body. But that was gone after ~45min and I became tired (T+ ~4h) and my friend danced her ass off. It was her first time and mine too.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t take any medication before but I have generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. I even tested it with &#039;marquis test&#039; and it was positive for MDMA. The effects I felt were:<br /><br />*change in body temperature<br />*shiver<br />*jaw clenching<br />*mild increase in energy (had to walk fast,..)<br />*eye jiggling<br /><br />TL,DR: MDMA last only 1-2hours for me.<br /><br />So does anyone of you guys have an idea why?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I&#039;m not depressed, I weight 125lbs and I&#039;m 175cm tall, I don&#039;t take any SSRI&#039;s, SNRI&#039;s or other anti-depressives. I didn&#039;t eat much (I think I just ate a hotdog that day). I just drunk alcohol but not really much, so no hangover and no other drugs. I wasn&#039;t tired and had a lot of sleep before I took it. <br />I was the one who had the MDMA and we both took the same batch.<br /><br />

				I notice this when I have to much (200mg+). Have a nice come-up and jiggles for about 30mins, then I guess it overpowers me and I just wanna chill out and cuddle lol. Not the best if i&#039;m going out !

The only thing i can think of is that you have a fast metabolism if you didn&#039;t mis dose. Body Weight plays a factor in dose no matter what. Also, just because a drug testes for a certian drug, doesn&#039;t mean it has good purity or is bunk.

Well I weight 125lbs and I&#039;m 175cm tall and I bought the MDMA from SR (juergen2001).<br />The weird thing is my friend who has the exact same weight as me had the best time in her life and rolled for 5hours.

				There are too many factors to consider. Mainly it is about brain chemistry. My first time with MDMA ended up horribly, I ingested 150mg and felt speedy for 2 hours, but then it turned a disaster and I had felt half-dead with diarrhea, nausea, vertigo etc. for 12 hours. My GF, who ingested just around 70mg felt amazing during the whole night.

				im the same way with mdma i roll face for about an hour or two and I feel &quot;normal&quot; and I redose accordingly. I used to be able to put back 2gs of local mol up my nose and it was pretty good stuff had it tested with good marquis after trying the sr mdma from pf and drnyx i will never buy locally again haha shit made me go hard for hours and everyone ive sold to absolutely loves it. but yea its a person to person thing just dose accordingly.<br /><br />mclovin478910

				It was probably cut with something else.<br /><br />A marquis test only indicates the presence of an MDxx compound. You could have a whole slew of other chemicals in there (e.g. Meth, Speed, Caffeine, etc...) and still have a marquis test go to purple/black and fizz.

				Contributing factors could be:- <br /><br />Hangover effecting the roll. <br /><br />Malnourished / Vitamin defiency <br /><br />Abnormal high tolerance<br /><br />Other drugs still present in body <br /><br />How much food eaten / what food eaten <br /><br />Sleep etc etc etc<br /><br />the list goes on... <br /><br />I have had a strange MDMA expierence before when my eyes were rolling but i had a &#039;flat&#039; feeling in my head, no euphoria, was not fun just felt tired,&nbsp; but was definitly mdma, very wierd.

				Here&#039;s some possibilities:<br /><br />----You got amphetamines<br />----You&#039;re friends gave you the shit and did all the good shit themselves<br />----You were in a pissy/shitty mood and fought the feeling<br />----You are generally not fun to be around<br />----You didin&#039;t do enough<br />----You&#039;re depressed and should kill yourself<br /><br />....not sure, but you&#039;re definitely not a special person who is somehow above and beyond the effects.
