				Poor girl, stories like this make me mad!<br /><br />Legalise marijuana.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use synthetic substitutes!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Teenage girl is left brain-damaged and blind after smoking synthetic marijuana she bought in a gas station and suffering series of strokes<br /><br /><br /><br />A teenage girl has narrowly avoided death after smoking &#039;synthetic marijuana&#039; that she bought from a gas station and suffering a series of strokes.<br /><br />Seventeen-year-old Emily Bauer, from Cypress, Texas, has been left with brain damage, paralysis and is unable to see after taking the synthetic weed with friends last December.<br /><br />Her family is now hoping to raise awareness of the dangers of the substance, which is often labelled as &#039;potpourri&#039;, while campaigners battle for stricter laws to make it illegal across the country.<br /><br />Fake weed, which is also known as &#039;Spice&#039; or &#039;K2&#039;, is an herbal mixture doused with chemicals that trigger a high similar to smoking marijuana, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.<br /><br />It is often sold as incense or potpourri, and is advertised as a legal alternative to weed. While many states have outlawed it, manufacturers have responded by slightly changing the compound so that it can return to shelves.<br /><br />Emily smoked the drug last December with friends and within 15 minutes, she told her boyfriend she was suffering from a migraine and needed to lay down.<br /><br />She suffered a series of strokes which left her in a psychotic-like state, during which she urinated on herself, ran into walls, hallucinated and acted violently, her sister told CNN&#039;s iReport.<br /><br />The police were called to help restrain her into an ambulance, and she was taken to Northwest Cypress Hospital, where she bit guardrails and attempted to bite medical staff.<br /><br />&#039;We thought once she comes down off the drug, we&#039;d take her home and show her the dangers of this drug,&#039; her older sister, Blake, said.<br /><br />&#039;We didn&#039;t think it was as big of a deal until 24 hours later she was still violent and hurting herself. We realized you&#039;re not supposed to stay high this long.&#039;<br /><br />She was put into an induced coma as doctors carried out tests on her brain.<br /><br />Doctors soon found Emily&#039;s strokes had caused severe vasculitis, meaning contracting blood vessels had constricted the flow of blood and cut off oxygen to her brain.<br /><br />&#039;In four days&#039; time, we went from thinking everything is going to be OK and we&#039;ll put her in drug rehabilitation to now you don&#039;t know if she&#039;s going to make it,&#039; stepfather Tommy Bryant told CNN.<br /><br />Doctors soon found Emily&#039;s blood vessels were expanding again and while the family saw it as a sign of improvement, pressure on the teenager&#039;s brain grew rapidly - and dangerously.<br /><br />Surgeons had to drill a hole in her skull and insert a tube to relieve pressure. But her brain was still affected.<br /><br />&#039;We met with Neurology team who showed us Emily&#039;s brain images,&#039; her mother, Tonya Bauer, said. &#039;They told us that all white areas on images were dead. It looked to us at least 70 per cent of the images were white.&#039;<br /><br />Doctors said Emily would not be able to recognise her family and would never be able to use her arms or legs again.<br /><br />With this heart-breaking news, Emily&#039;s parents made the tough decision to take out her breathing tube and stopped all nourishment on December 16 - but she continued to fight.<br /><br />As her mother went to her room one morning, she said, &#039;Good morning, I love you&#039; and was stunned to hear a hoarse voice saying: &#039;I love you too.&#039;<br /><br />&#039;Even though she couldn&#039;t move, is blind, and could hardly be aware of what was going on around her, she laughed with us as we made jokes and listened to her soft whisper replies,&#039; Blake said.<br /><br />&#039;It is my little sister shining through, in every way she can manage, with every ounce of strength.&#039;<br /><br />Emily knows where she is and recognises her family, but every day is still shrouded in confusion.<br /><br />The family does not know how much control she will recover, but she is already moving her arms and legs, and two weeks ago she started eating solid food again.<br /><br />Emily&#039;s parents have started a nonprofit organization called Synthetic Awareness For Emily to educate teenagers and parents about the dangers of synthetic marijuana use.<br /><br />&#039;Ee want to let kids and parents know about the warnings signs: migraines and withdrawal,&#039; Bryant said. &#039;We all know the warning signs of alcohol and cocaine, but with this synthetic weed stuff, it&#039;s so new that nobody knows about this stuff. We want to let other parents know about this so they don&#039;t have to go what we&#039;ve been going through.&#039;<br /><br />Bryant said he knew Emily used real marijuana occasionally, and told her she would be grounded if he ever caught her smoking.<br /><br />&#039;Had I thought that there was any chance that she could have been hurt by this stuff, I would have been a lot more vigilant. I had no idea it was so bad,&#039; Bryant told CNN.<br /><br />&#039;I&#039;d never have thought we&#039;d be in this situation. If she had bought it off the street or from a corner, that&#039;s one thing, but she bought it from convenience store.&#039;<br /><br />For more information about the family&#039;s nonprofit organization, Synthetic Awareness For Emily (SAFE), visit their Facebook page. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2273440/Teen-left-brain-damaged-blind-smoking-synthetic-marijuana.html#ixzz2QncFUPih

				Damn.&nbsp; Glad she is getting better but wow shit got really bad for her.<br /><br />I&#039;ll admit I smoked that stuff for a couple of weeks and a lot of it as I couldn&#039;t smoke weed during that time.&nbsp; It was short lived and I was smoking a lot each time I felt the side effects pretty bad.&nbsp; Horrible increase in heart rate and severe paranoia.&nbsp; Seriously thought I was going to have a heart attack sometimes after smoking a joint of that stuff.&nbsp; I went through a binge because I was being a fiend since I had no source for anything else.&nbsp; Regret smoking all that now.

				Yeah that&#039;s real shitty.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally vaporized more than 10 ounces of different synthetic cannabinoids with minor problems.&nbsp; Drugs affect everyone differently.<br /><br />Les Bias, one of the best basketball players of all time died from hitting one line of cocaine.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Bias<br /><br />Today one in five deaths is cigarette-related.&nbsp; This accounts for more than 430,000 deaths each year.

				Did they test whatever the girl smoked?<br /><br />Could have been anything but spice, for example, amonia, strychnine, etc.
