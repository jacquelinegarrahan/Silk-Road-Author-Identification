				I just received an order of speed from BoyMaster (fast delivery, good stealth, trust in small customers, waxy product)<br />I am not looking forward on using this drug recreatively(dancing, getting high) but to see if it can help me focusing on my studies and maybe casual use for socializing / keeping awake etc..<br />I do NOT own a mg scale and id like to use it in small quantities 20/30 mg,&nbsp; what I was thinking was to use an empty cap as measurement (it is 300mg i would fill half of the half of the half 37.5mg or half of that) <br />I am also worried about meth teeth and skin problems, how common are these for non junkies? Will i have bad teeth if i don&#039;t eat shit and keep hydrated/clean?<br />So my questions are, any of you have experience using this drug (or a similar one) for what I intend to?<br />Any way of dossing the drug until I get a scale? What do you think about the cap thingy?<br />And of course health, besides forcing to eat, staying clean, not overdoing it am I missing something important?<br />Thanks everyone

				Answers: Yes. Yes. Bad idea. No. <br /><br />To elaborate:<br />Your doses will look like small piles, about the size of a match head. That should be enough to get you going and studying and whatnot. Don&#039;t do the capsule measurement thing, that&#039;s just silly. Your teeth will be fine if you drink water regularly, shower regularly, eat well, and floss. You don&#039;t need a scale to dose amphetamines really.

				Zip covered everything succinctly. Can&#039;t add much but I would say that if you are buying drugs, you can at least buy a cheap scale online or at your local head shop and drop 20 on a scale so you at least know what 30-40mg look like. As he said, no real danger of the horror stories you might have seen/heard about but if you can&#039;t eyeball lines in that general Xmg range, you really would benefit your body by knowing your dosages so you know when you are beginning to scale up and can then keep yourself in the range you want to be in.<br /><br />Oh, and if you start doing it multiple times a week, I&#039;d recommend getting at least a multivitamin to take on &quot;use&quot; days to keep your body healthy<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				i got one of these milligram spoons:<br /><br />-----CLEARNET LINK-----<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Scoops-Micro-Milligram-Milligrams-Polypropylene/dp/B00762WVYS/ref=pd_sbs_k_3/175-6247303-9026960<br /><br />-----CLEARNET LINK-----<br /><br />i&#039;ve found that about 4 scoops of dutch speed measured with that spoon put in a capsule is my magic dose for getting work done and being sociable....if you&#039;re a complete speed virgin you might wanna start with 3 scoops at first...<br /><br />don&#039;t forget to supplement your diet with plenty of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and l-dopa...also taking an antacid helps make your speed go a long way...

				Really appreciate the replies guys.<br />I ended up trying to put less than a match head in a cap (smells and tastes pretty unpleasing)<br />It was somehow difficult since it is waxy and it stick&#039;d to the tweezers.<br /><br />I definitely LOVED the experience, I was so damn motivated to do whatever I wanted, I was so motivated that i couldn&#039;t decide on what to study and ended up reading lots of different subjects and chatting with some friends talking about long subjects that i always felt lazy to explain properly, once i try more and find a way to properly measure my doses ill do a decent review.<br /><br />I have an important concern though, I don&#039;t know yet if this is the cause but i have some spasms under my testicles, Id say in the part of the prostate but not really sure, i feel no pain&nbsp; it is weird.<br />I did a little research and all i could find is prescription-amp users with prostate problems so I&#039;ll have to pay more attention to this, when will it stop and if it returns or intensifies with the consumption of more amps.<br /><br />Thanks for being such a great community.
