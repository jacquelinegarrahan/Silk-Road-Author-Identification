				the best method will be to snort, and in general a small pile the size of a paper match head is a common starting dose. make sure you give yourself time before re-dosing, a min of twenty to thirty min for it to kick in.<br /><br />also, snort multiple smaller lines softly over a min rather than one line all at once as to minimize the drip which will mostly be wasted<br /><br />#4 is not meant to smoke, because it is the salt form which has a vaporization temp too close to the combustion temp, therefore much of the H will be destroyed and smoking is extremely ineffective<br /><br />#3 is the freebase form and also cut with caffeine commonly so it vaporizes more easily and is intended for smoking but doesnt dissolve in water without acid. (still can be snorted though)

				if you have a mg scale you can just weigh it in the bag and then use the difference, but i would start with 10-15 mg to be safe if you have no tolerance just to get an idea of the potency and work up from there <br /><br />that means you need a .001 g scale though - and not a cheap one, a high quality lab scale<br /><br />if you have a .01 g scale its not accurate enough to safely use
