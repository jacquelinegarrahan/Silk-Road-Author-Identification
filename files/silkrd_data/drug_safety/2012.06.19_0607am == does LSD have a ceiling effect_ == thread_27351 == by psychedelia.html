				That is, is there a dosage than which you can&#039;t get any higher?<br /><br />I can&#039;t seem to find much good information about this. <br /><br />I&#039;ve taken ten hits at once, and I want to go even higher. But I also don&#039;t want to waste LSD.

				I arrived to a campground late afternoon. I watched a guy running around with what looked like the Culligan cooler jug that had the bottom two inches or so filled with what he claimed was L -- He had a cloth mitten with jester-like finger tips that dangled down a foot each. He was placing his palm on the end of the jug and tipping it over producing droplets off the glove that he was sprinkling on those willing. Dosing anyone and everyone for free. I was young at the time and quite frankly terrified of the son of a bitch so I passed up on the offer. <br /><br />Hours later and deep into the night you would hear these guttural yells that would bellow out of no where and last inhumanly long. Walking back to our campsite, the origin of the yelling was coming to a pinpoint. We found the source and it was that very same guy. He was sitting naked on a rug out front of a late 80&#039;s Corsica with his knees tucked into his chest and his eyes were focus upwards despite his head being forward. The glove was gone from what I could recall but there was an empty Culligan jug next to him standing up right. We sat there waiting for another one of these human fog horn blasts since from a decibel perspective it was quite impressive. Sure enough after about two minutes watching him rock back and forth muttering to himself his held tilted back slowly as he inhaled a rib cracking amount of air and just fucking rocked it -- one of those real deep from the belly booms. You could see his jaw tighten and veins emerge on his forehead and neck while he screamed for like 30 seconds straight. I had no idea how he wasn&#039;t passing the fuck out. <br /><br />I decided then and there that a good head fuck, enhanced music and some shaky trees was good enough for me anytime I dose. I hope you find your ceiling, but I&#039;ll just stick to a comfy chair.

				There is big thread over at the shroomery. www.shroomery.org, entitled &quot;The Thumbprint&quot; where a couple people on there, one chinacat72 in particular, sort of describe very high dose LSD experiences. I would imagine any question one could have about high dose LSD trips should be answered in that thread.
