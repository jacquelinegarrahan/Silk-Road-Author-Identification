				So, I&#039;ve recently discovered the relaxing joys of the opiate high, but based on the many warnings to keep it under control before it turns into a problem, I&#039;m attempting to set a schedule for myself to insure continued safe enjoyment.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d also like to avoid tolerance driving up my price per fun time.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My question is--how often can a person indulge without building up tolerance?&nbsp; &nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; &nbsp; Once a week?&nbsp; &nbsp;Twice?&nbsp; &nbsp;Less often?&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not a guy who needs to hit &#039;the nod&#039;, I just like to feel the extra relaxed sensation with a little itchiness that for me comes from a 10mg oxy percocet and a glass of wine (right, right, I know, don&#039;t mix the alcohol with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it takes some of the sickly edge off for me).&nbsp; &nbsp; I overdid it the other night by taking a 60mg morphine (my first time with morphine sulfate) in quarters--didn&#039;t realize it would take a long time to hit me because it was ER so I kept redosing, a total amateur maneuver I know.&nbsp; &nbsp; I ended up unable to sleep, up all night super high (but reeealllly comfortable) and almost puked, that was way too much.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s my guess that that kind of dose would also increase tolerance.<br /><br />Anyone care to weigh in?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				After being a daily user of opiates years ago I went a long while before I started using them again.<br />My rule, and it has worked for quite some time now is never take anything more than three days in a row.&nbsp; That has allowed me to enjoy a nice opiate buzz occasionally without having to deal with WD&#039;s and it helps with keeping cost low.<br />A 60 mg morphine blast does feel really nice to the uninitiated (i think 180mg is lethal for opiate naive) but yes the more you take the more your body can accept and just like the national debt it just keeps going up up up.&nbsp; Find a dose you like, 20-30mg oxy is my happy place, don&#039;t go any higher or often and you should be ok. <br />Also, this practice takes a lot of self discipline.<br />Hope that helps.

				I think there is a difference between &quot;safe&quot; enjoyment and not building up a tolerance. Opiate use is not something to take lightly... it really sneaks up on you and then is extremely difficult to get yourself away from. I considered myself to have a level of discipline above that of most drug (ab)users, being able to use nearly every substance I have tried, sometimes daily for months at a time, and then I would decide I had enough and walked away without looking back... everything from nicotine/stimulants/MDMA/Benzos, etc. However the opiates are a completely different story! My habit daily habit is going on two years now.<br /><br />I too started like you sound, where I very rarely used oxycodone just for special occasions... then I began to use for the anxiolytic properties while going out on the weekends only. That progressed to sometimes during the week too, after a long day of class/work. I was doing it once a day every other day or so for months without developing a physical dependence... but psychologically I had become dependent wayyyy before this point even. Before I knew it, I had a daily habit... I was still doing ridiculously low doses (like 10 mg snorted, not even IV, not even to really get high and nod, but just to be more relaxed and sociable) but had to do them daily or else I started feeling shitty. Opiate withdrawal is INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE!!! You do not understand how bad it is until you try to quit (or your flight gets canceled and you have to wait till the next day in the airport and you were fucking stupid and didnt bring an extra days supply just in case...) and I was only mildly withdrawing from basically the lowest dosages people take... I cannot image the HELL people with extreme tolerances go through when they quit. <br /><br />PLEASE just be safe and really consider the choices you are making... In my experience I would say that even doing it every weekend is way too frequent since you obviously already really enjoy the feeling... You wont build a tolerance only doing it on the weekend, but you may slide down that slope without realizing it, and there is no escape once you pass the event horizon!
