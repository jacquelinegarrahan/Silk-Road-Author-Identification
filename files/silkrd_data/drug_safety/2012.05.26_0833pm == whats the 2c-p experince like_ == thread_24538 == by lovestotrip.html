				This should hopefully help you out a bit. ;)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[8 mg, oral] &quot;The trees around me and above me were frightening, taking on the characteristics of demons and giant dinosaur- like creatures. The sounds of creatures feasting and writhing in the distance became more pronounced, and closer. I imagined them charging towards me and I felt them breathing down my neck. My back ached and my feet burned from ant bites and splinters. After standing up, I stayed in place for a while staring up at the sky being utterly silent. A wave of fear and anguish came over me wondering if I would ever be sane again.&quot; -- Exp 84690<br /><br />[6 mg, oral] &quot;The experience was not fun. It was far from pleasant. I experienced no severe emotional distress while on the drug. However, around the 9th hour, I started getting bummed out about the duration. I just wanted to sleep. I was exhausted. This drug is physically and psychologically very draining. Regardless, I see incredible therapeutic potential in this drug. Even at my low dose (6 mg), I realized how intense and unforgiving 2C-P could be.&quot; -- Exp 84868<br /><br />[8 mg, oral] &quot;2c-p is a very inspiring drug artistically, affecting both my music and visual work. It could be helpful to writers, and probably anyone who can deal with the length and intensity of the trip.&quot; -- Exp 34277<br /><br />[9 mg, oral] &quot;Visuals are insane.&quot; -- Exp 34341<br /><br />[10 mg, oral] &quot;...some initial stomach discomfort and nausea--nothing too bad. 2cp was more relaxed than 2ci, deeper than 2cb, not as clinical or freaky as 2ce. I felt some jaw and back tension that was a bit painful at times. Visuals were not overwhelming but were pleasant,&quot; -- Exp 83626<br /><br />[10 mg, oral] &quot;pretty overwhelmed. Visuals and swirling hitting hard, discomfort comes in waves and is mainly due to the intensity. I noticed stronger colourings in peripheral vision and movement in shadows, a slight trembling like on acid.&quot; -- Exp 76011<br /><br />[10 mg, oral] &quot;I chatted on and on, happily energised, on how magick and nanotechnology and the like were really pretty much the same thing despite many pagan types mistrusting science and, more humorously, how there weren&#039;t enough performance enhancing drugs in sport since people try and enhance their performance every other way.&quot; -- Exp 51687<br /><br />[14 mg, oral] &quot;My face and the top of my chest are still electrified. Still getting occasional body rushes. This drug is overstaying its welcome. For the next 4 hours I have an annoying tension in my face as though it&#039;s the last place for the drug to leave my body.&quot; -- Exp 83066<br /><br />[14 mg, oral] &quot;I have never been so overwhelmed by a drug. I attribute the intensity of the experience to the bodily sensations as much as the hallucinations. I am almost constantly hit with intense rushes of trippiness. At one point the hallucinations were pretty scary and I found myself thinking I was going to fall into a &#039;bad trip&#039;.&quot; -- Exp 83066<br /><br />[16 mg, oral] &quot;Visuals were exceptionally intense, things would appear in mid-air, and not only that, but even my hallucinations would warp. There was a space of.. I would estimate.. an hour or so, where I left my body. My conciousness and spirit went away for a while, I was able to see into, and even explore different dimensions, each with their own laws of physics, and order. I think I almost had a heart attack about 5 times. [...] As far as the near heart attacks, it is not clear whether it was an actual severe problem, or if it was simply because I could feel each individual chamber doing its work. [...] There was certainly a marked increase in heart rate, whether this was related to the effects of the drug, or anxiety from seeing existence unravel in front of me, I do not know.&quot; -- Exp 49785<br /><br />[16 mg, oral] &quot;I am getting a feeling through my body, very pleasant. Like rushes of energy. It is almost like an orgasm through the whole body.&quot; -- Exp 44553</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				seems to be a large range of reports, odd that 6mg seems to be one of the worst<br /><br />but they also seem to be somewhat unstable as far as reports, does 6mg always produce bad effects or just a bad time? anyone with experiance care to chime in?

				2c-p is a favorite of mine.&nbsp; It&#039;s a long trip obviously, so there is less pressure to perfectly sync up your peak with whatever music/activities/etc. you have planned, there is time to do it all!&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve always experienced 2c-p in waves, I&#039;ll be almost perfectly lucid for a few minutes and then the visuals come back in full force and the experience becomes very intense. <br /><br />I commonly get pretty bad nausea while on it, and I&#039;ve seen others mention it too, so be wary of that.&nbsp; Most of my doses have been 12 mg, but 10 mg sounds like a good amount to start out on.<br /><br />Try spending some time near water while your tripping.<br />

				I have a very strong stomach and it actually made me feel sick the entire time.&nbsp; It lasted a long time and it was definitely worth the money but I&#039;m not sure if I would do it again.&nbsp; If you can find it, try dragonfly.&nbsp; It lasted a little bit longer but I was filled with giggles and didn&#039;t feel sick at all.

				Me and my mates had 35mg in caps on the weekend. We took it at 9pm and it takes a whole 3 hours to take affect but then comes on quite fast for about an hour and then your peaking for a good 5 hours then a very slow come down for another 5 hours. One of us vomited because we were are drinking heavily before hand. I don&#039;t recommend alcohol with this unless its much later which I did. <br /><br />2c-p is very psychedelic and one of us who was newish to it really could not handle the length of the trip and we had to give her a Xanax.<br /><br />Otherwise I highly recommend 2c-p to people who want to trip balls and have other experiences under there belt. I would recommend 25i to anyone, there&#039;s a euphoric aspect that makes it so much more pleasant.

				Tried 12mg 2C-P recently, I have a high PEA tolerance.<br /><br />Unlike other 2C-x there was little revelation. I felt some psychedelia but unfortunately I did not experience any epiphanies which is uncharacteristic of a psychedelic trip of mine. I did however experience very pleasant visuals and a great body high. However it kept going far too long and I found myself trying to sleep but experiencing disturbing auditory hallucinations when falling asleep. The entire experience took over 12 hours, and the day after I slept 16 hours out of pure exhaustion.<br /><br />2C-P is interesting and I should probably explore it more, but it seems that it&#039;s mostly just a very long and tiring trip. And unlike the DOx it is quite lucid, at least for me, so it doesn&#039;t make for a crazy time. I don&#039;t know if I like it or not.
