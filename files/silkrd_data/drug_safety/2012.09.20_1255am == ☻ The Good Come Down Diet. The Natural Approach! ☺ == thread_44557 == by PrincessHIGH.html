				I don&#039;t think there is a similar thread like this here, so I decided to make one :)<br /><br />When I have a cocaine related come-down, I don&#039;t always reach for the weed or the valiums. Sometimes it isn&#039;t the best answer, instead at times I find the natural approach the best.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some of the things that I treat my comedown with.<br /><br />☻ Calcium Carbonate<br />☺ Vitamin B100 <br />☻ Vitamin C<br />☺ L-Tyrosine<br />☻ Melatonin<br />☺ Fatty foods - absorb toxins into the blood stream.<br /><br />Here&#039;s why...<br /><br />Calcium and melatonin ct as immunostimulators, meaning that they stimulate your immunity to restore itself under stress. L-Tyrosine will help you to uptake the lost norepiehrine and dopamine located in the synapses, that is given up when cocaine reacts and puts pressure on the ion channels. Vitamin C is your bodies natural cleanser and helps to increase lipid metabolization, stomach acidity and electrolyte balances, associated with neurotoxicity levels. Vitamin B100 is a multi complex, that aids with lipid metabolization when in taking fatty foods, and provides great assistance if your feeling emotional!<br /><br />Failing that, there is always good old fashioned sex, I always find sex very beneficial for comedowns lol!<br /><br />Would be interested to hear other natural approaches to comedowns. Or just general good diet advice if your a regular recreational drug user.<br /><br />Cheers :)

				Ugh, don&#039;t know if this fits here, but many people don&#039;t know that &quot;hang-overs&quot; come from lack of water in one&#039;s brain and so one should drink 3-5 glasses of water before going to bed after moderate(heavy) drinking :P<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				MDMA / Ecstasy:<br /><br />I don&#039;t over do it on these nowadays but after a night on doing a pill or 2 the next day, use L-Tryptophan which is supposed to be better than 5-HTP. L-Tryptophan helps the body produce serotonin naturally. I take this with a multivitamin tablet and make a smothie with a banana, nat. yoghurt, milk and blueberries for a about 3 days after. Also a healthy fish diet and a diet with L-Tryptophan based foods (search the web for them) as much as possible.<br />I find now I don&#039;t keep taking pills once I&#039;ve come down as I think you may as well just throw them away! First hit strong and followed by a lesser hit to keep it going and let yourself come down is my motto these days.<br /><br />Next MDMA night for me is Saturday, yippee!!!&nbsp; :) <br /><br />

				A good daily vitamin regimen is also a great thing to have. This is my current stack:<br /><br />750mg Aniracetam (two times a day)<br />500mg Choline<br />3000mg Fish Oil<br />1000mg Vitamin C w/ Rose Hips<br />Multivitamin<br /><br />Before a roll I preload with the following, along with my daily regimen (I up the dose of Vitamin C, though).<br /><br />400 IU Vitamin E<br />100mg Co-Q10<br />500mg ALA<br />500mg Magnesium<br />500mg Ginger<br /><br />After I&#039;m completely done rolling, I follow up with my daily regimen and 400mg of 5-HTP. In doing so you heavily aide in the recovery process and it&#039;s very noticeable. A good, healthy meal high in essential nutrients 3-4 hours prior to rolling is also a wise idea. If you treat your brain with respect, it WILL reward you.

				These are very good suggestions, but...<br /><br />Whenever I take vitamins, I get the most excruciating headache. A headache that wakes me out of my sleep at night. I&#039;ve never experienced painful headaches until I started taking multivitamins, and I don&#039;t experience them on days that I don&#039;t take vitamins. <br /><br />It happens every time I take Vitamin C, or whenever I take a multivitamin that includes Vitamin C. <br /><br />It sucks because I wanted to use vitamin C to counteract amphetamine neurotoxicity.

				A good multivitamin is one that exactly supplies what you are not getting from your diet, so its different for everyone. A generic multivitamin will supply all your needs, at the risk of ovderdosing some vitamins.<br /><br />Many multi-vitamin preparations will also contain the daily recommended amount of minerals though. Their presence may result in side effects for some people. Mostly these side effects are limited to getting the shits, but the effects are vary variable amount people taking them,<br /><br />Vitamin C is a very unlikely culprit though. That is a vitamin you can ingest at 100 times the recommended dose with no adverse effect since its excreted in urine as long as your kidneys are functioning normally. If you suffer adverse effects when taking vitamin c supplements, first explore what taking a glass or two of orange juice does to you. If it cases the same symtoms, seek medical advise. <br /><br />

Did you know oranges don&#039;t have the highest Vitamin C content?&nbsp; Oranges only have 53mg of Vitamin C per 100g, the best fruit is guva that has a whopping 228mg of Vitamin C, yellow kiwis 180mg, followed by green kiwis 98mg, believe it or not even strawberries have a higher Vitamin C 57mg than oranges! If you have a blender and a bit of time to spare, you can do much better in the Vitamin C stakes than a glass of OJ, if not, OJ is probably your best option :)

				Just a small one to add but if you live near the sea and are man enough to get in for a dip even if it&#039;s cold, a good swim in the sea is great for clearing out the nose after a night on coke. You can really blow the shite out of your nose without rubbing the nose of yourself raw with tissue etc. Obviously good clean coke won&#039;t screw things up as much but I find sea water clears my head/nose/sinuses out really well. Better and cheaper than sprays for the same too I&#039;d say!<br />Good for blood circulation and the skin too!
