				okay guize.<br />i know this post might rustle some jimmies, and make some uncomfortable, but id like to know how everyone else has been affected by their drug use.<br /><br />since my amphetamine use i have adopted a few nervous ticks into my behavior.<br /><br />one of them is gritting my teeth together/flexing my jaw constantly.<br />any amount of caffeine seems to bring this about, and it really sucks.<br />i have nightmares about my teeth falling out and its such a shitty feeling in those dreams!<br />i love my teeth, they are almost perfectly straight and i have a damn good smile.<br />would suck to fuck that up<br /><br />the other nervous tick ive taken on is picking at the sides of my fingernails, where the skin pretty much meets the nail.<br />i like rubbing that part of my finger on other fingers and i like prying up my skin so it creates a feeling like im itching myself when i do it<br />(i dont understand this shit but i literally get pleasure out of it. can someone explain it)<br /><br />and not only can someone explain it, but will you guys share any similar things like this?<br />i cant be the only one left with shit like dat.

				Yeah, sometimes when you binge on any stimulant you will get nervous ticks for an unknown period of time. I used to have knee jerks and shakes and random jerks from abusing methylone and adderall for a long period of time, but they&#039;ve calmed down now. If you want to settle them down a little bit and don&#039;t mind travelling down another drug rabbit-hole so-to-speak, you could get some valium or something. Benzos usually calm down my nervous ticks.<br /><br />The worst for me was the inability to get any good sleep because of the shakes and the jerking, but I went to the doc and they gave me ropinirole, which is for restless leg syndrome and parkinson&#039;s disease. It activates a fuckton of different receptors in the brain, so many so that I don&#039;t quite understand it... but it works. I sleep like a baby on it. And I wake up feeling great. It has a pretty low potential for abuse, too, I&#039;d say, since I&#039;ve taken a bunch of it at once and only experienced negative effects. Pretty sure it&#039;s a D1 agonist or something, but it activates the opiod receptors that are responsible for pain relief but not euphoria if I remember correctly...<br /><br />Anyway, you&#039;re not the only one that gets that... just CALM down on the stims, lol. Unless you don&#039;t care about the ticks, in which case, have at it. But the more you burn your brain-cells the worse they&#039;re gonna get. Once I started to get bad I took a good month or two where I would only do drugs of all sorts sparingly and didn&#039;t binge, and after a while I felt a lot better. Your body will repair itself if you give it time to recover.

(for me anyway)<br />naturally some people made me uncomfortable and if it was immediately after a stimulant experience, i was antisocial and nervous.<br />lol, im on amphetamines now though, which is probably fueling this regurgitation of information right now =3<br /><br />ive considered benzos but ive heard they are addictive so im not sure i want to get into it.<br />amphetamines are bad enough, with the urge to redose when your brain has used up its supply of neurochemicals is shitty!<br />and i know benzos are much much worse, apparently comparable to opiates.<br />but ropinirole sounds interesting haha, might have to look into it.

				The way I see it, ropinirole ( brand name requip ) has to be great for nervous ticks especially if they&#039;re physical ticks since both parkinson&#039;s and RLS are completely oriented around physical ticks, y&#039;know? It works for me. And it&#039;s great because depending on when you take it it has different effects - if you take it when you normally go to bed, it really helps you sleep but in and of itself it doesn&#039;t make you sleepy. ( but i&#039;ve never found a drug that really made me more tired than I already usually am, even when I&#039;ve binged on ambien ). <br /><br />I DEFINITELY understand what you mean when you talk about psychedelics. Sometimes I&#039;ll be tripping and nobody will know I&#039;m tripping and I&#039;ll listen to people talk and they just sound so fucking fake, but genuinely fake, like they don&#039;t know how much they&#039;ve been conditioned to say the things that they say. I feel bad for them. They think they live their own lives but really they just go through the motions of something designed by the society they choose to believe in.<br /><br />But enough of my own rambling :p <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a problem with abusing benzos because they really don&#039;t have any effects that I would call euphoric or pleasant - at least some don&#039;t. Klonopin was sorta nice, but from what I understand ( and I don&#039;t really know a lot about benzos so I could be completely wrong ) klonopin is more muscle relaxer than anxiety reliever. Either way, the comedown from benzos is fucking grotesque for me, like being sick as I&#039;ve ever been in my entire life, puking and wishing I was dead, and I can&#039;t do anything to fix it besides try and sleep it off. So I just avoid them.<br /><br />They are good tools if you&#039;re tripping for too long and need to come down to sleep or if you have physical ticks, though, I&#039;ve found. It&#039;s just a matter of not using them for recreation. I find that easy because they&#039;re not too recreational for me, but obviously that&#039;s not the case for everyone... I&#039;m just a stimulant oriented guy, I like my m1 and my amphetamine, and my psychedelics... the occasional opiate is alright but for the most part I&#039;m not too interested in downers, y&#039;know?

				Try buying some magnesium capsules from a health food store, they should help with your jaw clenching.

				The &quot;teeth falling out&quot; dream is a common dream for people with anxiety problems. I personally have that dream all the time, and I don&#039;t do many stimulants.

				MEMANTINE, man. Can&#039;t stress it enough. Take memantine (much better than magnesium) each day in the morning and at night and you&#039;ll notice a much smoother amp experience. Also, at night take l-tyrosine and remeron (mirtazepine). You&#039;ll wake up a slight bit groggy but once the amp and memantine kick in, you&#039;ll be ready to go. Drink lots of water through all of this and eat well. Hopefully you&#039;ll notice a difference. <br /><br />Godspeed ;)
