				I know it&#039;s supposed to burn, but I have snorted MDMA before, and I didn&#039;t find the burning to be unbearable, although it was very irritating. Would snorting DMT be any worse? Does anyone have any experience with snorting DMT?<br /><br />

				Yes, you can snort freebase DMT.<br />Me and my brother snorted 50mg to &quot;test the waters&quot; so to speak. Was one of the most intense 4 hour trips of my life. Felt like someone shot a bullet into my nose, it really did hurt that bad. Then I was overwhelmed with the typical visuals, and completely brokethrough (and blacked out for a period).<br /><br />Nay-sayers have simply never tried it, check it out on DMT-Nexus IceHouseShaman has done extensive research into the topic.

But that wouldn&#039;t destroy the DMT.<br /><br />50-75mg for a break through dose in my experience. That is about equal to smoking maybe just a tad more. Though, DMT is a funny substance. Sometimes I can breakthrough smoking 20mg of crystal in a GVG, and sometimes 50mg of the same crystal will give threshold effects. I cannot express how much more painful snorting is compared to smoking. Just on that note I wouldn&#039;t advise it to anyone.<br />
