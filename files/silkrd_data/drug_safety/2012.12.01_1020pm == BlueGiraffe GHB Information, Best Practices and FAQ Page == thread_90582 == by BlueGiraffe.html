				BlueGiraffe Vendor Page:<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Hello Silk Roaders :)<br /><br />BlueGiraffe is here to provide you with proper GHB. Once and for all.<br /><br />That is 99.5%+ assay, pure white crystalline gamma-hydroxybutyrate powder. It is the sodium salt form (Na-GHB) which is the most popular and tastes and feels the best.<br /><br />It is also stronger by weight (about 13%) compared to the potassium salt form (K-GHB). Additionally, although K-GHB should theoretically be the same pharmacologically, it seems to not have quite the same euphoria (even when dosage is adjusted to the same activity as Na-GHB).<br /><br />Our product is pharmaceutical grade, professionally lab produced dry crystal powder - the only form of GHB that should be used (for reasons of both safety and pleasure).<br /><br />Liquid GHB&#039;s are, in our opinion, always suspect and of potentially dubious quality because they can be produced by amateur chemists, and most often are. (There will of course be exceptions to this where decent quality liquid is produced, but these are very rare in our experience.)<br /><br />Potential problems with home-brew liquid GHB&#039;s include unreacted GBL (the primary precursor - not very tasty or healthy at all), dangerously high pH (from unreacted NaOH) and contaminants from low quality industrial grade reagents.<br /><br />Our GHB is produced in a professional lab from only pharmaceutical grade reagents. We have a highly refined and tested synthesis protocol, and are the preferred global supplier to connoisseurs of this wonderful substance.<br /><br />The taste of our product is excellent - mildly salty and very natural tasting, a bit like teardrops :)<br /><br />GHB is a superb drug - relaxing, pleasurable, euphoric, tactile, wonderfully sensual and deeply sexual - and is very clean on the body.<br /><br />It is completely metabolized to carbon dioxide and water and, along with DMT, is one of only two drugs that are endogenous neurochemicals - i.e. the body already makes them and the brain uses them. So the body knows exactly what to do with it, has the correct enzymes to metabolize it, and is generally very comfortable with it.<br /><br />If you want to read more about it there are two excellent books on GHB available on Amazon:<br /><br />* http://www.amazon.com/GHB-Natural-Enhancer-Ward-Dean/dp/0962741868/<br />* http://www.amazon.com/Better-Sex-Through-Chemistry-Nutrients/dp/0962741825/<br /><br />There are also three very good articles on GHB here:<br /><br />* http://www.biopsychiatry.com/ghb/authentic.html<br />* http://www.life-enhancement.com/magazine/article/76-the-truth-about-ghb-steven-fowkes-testifies-to-the-california-state-legislature-committee<br />* http://fr0gman.wordpress.com/discover-the-regenerative-effects-of-ghb-the-elixir-of-life/<br /><br />Our Silk Road Forum FAQ / Best Practices Page can be accessed here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.0<br /><br />Enhancing the MDMA experience with GHB information here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90975<br /><br />Vendor Review Thread here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110447.0<br /><br />Newbie (less than 50 posts) BlueGiraffe GHB Everything Thread here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108363.0<br /><br /><br />GHB needs to be used correctly to enjoy its magic:<br /><br />Firstly, if you take too much you will fall into a deep sleep from which you cannot be woken for a couple of hours - and you will miss all the fun!<br /><br />This state is actually proper restful sleep and is not dangerous, but you may alarm your friends if they are not familiar with GHB.<br /><br />It is best start slowly, taking 0.5g to 1g at a time and slowly building up (in the same way one would drink alcohol). We suggest spacing doses about 25 - 30 minutes apart until you are in the zone.<br /><br />GHB is best mixed in a glass of water. It is pleasant, and has a mild salty taste. [K-GHB has a slightly more bitter taste.]<br /><br />GHB dosing is body weight dependent so adjust accordingly - and ladies tend to be more sensitive to it even apart from the lower body weight, so please take this into account. (Another reason you should only use powder GHB is that with liquid GHB&#039;s you are never 100% certain of the dosage, as different manufacturers and sellers will dilute to different concentrations.)<br /><br />GHB combines very well with stimulants (particularly cocaine), and taken towards the end of an MDMA experience it is excellent! It will mellow the come-down, re-invigorate the energy of the MDMA and bring a profound sexual dimension into play that was not there before.<br /><br />It does not combine well with CNS depressants and can be dangerous in combination with them. So if you&#039;re doing GHB then stay entirely away from alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methaqualone and ketamine. Using GHB with Cannabis is fine.<br /><br />A small percentage of people do experience some nausea the first time they take it, but only if they push the dosage too far, and then never again subsequently. At normal doses nausea is never an issue. The main thing is to take it slow until you are familiar with the drug.<br /><br />It is great in a party situation as a social euphoriant, and even better in the bedroom where it truly comes into its own. In our opinion there no single drug that is as effective an aphrodisiac and pleasure enhancer as GHB. And when combined with its favourite sisters (MDMA, cocaine, Moxy and 2C-B) you have Love-Sex-Passion-Magic like never before!<br /><br />This is our first foray onto the Silk Road and we trust we will provide you with an excellent service.<br /><br />We will be finding our feet initially and we hope you will indulge us, but what we will always guarantee are excellent gear, totally discrete and professional shipping (you will be impressed) and 100% ethical business practices.<br /><br />Please ask any questions you might have :)<br />

				Basic GHB Safety Rules:<br /><br />1. Use pharmaceutical grade GHB powder only. GHB powder is always clean whereas liquid may not be. Liquid GHB&#039;s may contain unreacted GBL (which will change the dosing dynamics - and is very heavy on the liver) or unreacted NaOH (which can burn you). Also it is easy for amateur kitchen chemists to make liquid GHB, and so quality may not be up to proper lab standards. The main reason to use powder though is that the dose can be known exactly, rather than guessed, as is the case with liquid.<br /><br />2. NEVER mix GHB with any CNS depressants. This includes alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methaqualone and ketamine - as well as other sedatives, hypnotics, sleeping pills, muscle relaxants etc. Not before, not during and not after. Leave at least 48 hours (and preferably longer) on either side of GHB use before/after using these. Interactions between GHB and these drugs are THE primary cause of all problems.<br /><br />3. Be cautious using GHB on a full stomach. The GHB will be absorbed a lot slower, causing one to potentially re-dose based on not feeling it. And then all of that GHB will finally kick in sometime later leading to a higher dose than one intended to take.<br /><br />4. If someone takes too much GHB (not in combination with the above-mentioned) and passes out, then let them be. Monitor them, put them on their side so if they do vomit it does not clog their airway, and let them sleep it off. It&#039;s not a problem, it&#039;s not a coma, it will be OK. If someone is &quot;twitching&quot; this is not anything serious but simply a response in the body (called myoclonus) which happens when someone is right on the edge of falling sleep - an indication that the dose has gone just a little too high.<br /><br />5. Dosing should be done progressively (perhaps 1g - 2g every 30 - 60 minutes, erring towards the lower dose and longer interval), rather than a larger dose all at once. That way people can adjust the dose based on how they are feeling.<br /><br />6. Leave at least 48 hours between GHB sessions.<br /><br />7. Maintain overall health through good diet, exercise and moderate (not excessive) drug use.<br />

				Thanks.&nbsp; Your guide cleared a couple of things I was going to message you about, but can you use alcohol in moderation before taking a dose?&nbsp; Like a beer or two earlier in the evening?&nbsp; Is it deathly harmful or just long-term use with the combination that causes problems?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried it several times in the past and I was on a wide variety of drugs that you stated were harmful in the combination.&nbsp; I guess I should just keep the dosage low.&nbsp;

				My basic recommendation is to never have alcohol and GHB in the same body at the same time. A beer or two (as you suggest) earlier in the evening is not going to kill you - BUT it is still better not to mix them up at all. This is from a safety perspective - but also from a PLEASURE perspective :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />GHB will generally feel more euphoric without having alcohol in the system at the same time. The alcohol will tend to lean the experience of GHB more towards alcohol itself, and obscure the higher, more MDMA-like aspects of GHB. My point of view...

				You&#039;re welcome :)<br /><br />Speaking of MDMA, I will never do it without GHB on hand, and nor will anyone else I know either. The reason...?<br /><br />MDMA and GHB: Designed to work together!<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Everyone who knows and loves MDMA for the blessed sacrament that it is, knows that there is also a shadow, a sting in the tail.<br /><br />For me personally, the hardest thing is being &quot;cast out of heaven&quot; as the MDMA space starts to fragment and I remember again my un-blissful self. This is of course when we might consider re-dosing - which you can get away with once, but generally not twice (without somewhat gnarly consequences).<br /><br />Then there is the cold hard reality of non-ecstasy (and potentially post-MDMA tension and edginess) followed by being totally washed out the next day - and then the proverbial &quot;Suicide Tuesday&quot; where the effects of serotonin depletion are felt good and proper.<br /><br />Using GHB after MDMA is a way to totally change this experience :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As follows:<br /><br />Whether one is doing single dose MDMA or with a kicker at the 1-2 hour point, there will come a time when the MDMA experience first starts to fragment and you start to drop out.<br /><br />This is the time to start taking GHB, normally as a first single dose of 1.5g - 2.5g, and this should be taken the moment the first drop is noted in the MDMA. (And ideally one would have experimented with GHB on its own before hand in order to be familiar with its dosing dynamics.)<br /><br />What will happen is that the GHB will come on in 15-25 minutes (and while there is still some MDMA activity), and essentially re-energize the MDMA space completely - while also adding its own character.<br /><br />There will be a deep and relaxing rush, often an even fuller euphoric empathy than felt originally and, most delightfully, the adding of the strong erotic and humorous nature of GHB :)<br /><br />MDMA is generally very sensual, but not directly sexual. GHB will add a deeply erotic, disinhibited and sexual dimension to the space. If you are with your lover at this point there will definitely be movement into deep and released sexual play.<br /><br />Most importantly, the usual sensation of coming off MDMA will be totally not noticed in the rushy pleasure as the two drugs gracefully blend and the GHB starts to take over from the MDMA. The GHB will certainly extend the MDMA roll for a couple of hours, and as you can re-dose GHB repeatedly without ill-effects (within reason) you can extend the zone for a long time.<br /><br />In time the GHB will put you down into a deep and restful sleep, from which you will awaken some hours later feeling refreshed and way more energized than you would have been without it. There will still be some residual tiredness in the system from the MDMA, but much less, and generally the following day will be much smoother and easier - and even totally benign.<br /><br />Everyone I know who has used GHB in this way, flat refuses to take MDMA without it now, and it&#039;s the same for me. It&#039;s frankly not worth it. And the pleasurable elaboration of the potential of MDMA by the GHB makes for a much richer experience altogether. <br /><br />So there it is! It is my hope that this information will give more people the opportunity to profoundly enrich their MDMA use and also mitigate most of the unpleasant after-effects.<br /><br />Any questions, just ask...<br /><br />BG

				Blue,<br /><br />You have me super pumped to use GHB with MDMA. I have some Super Trips MDMA arriving soon and I am really looking forward to the mix when the MDMA magic starts to slip away. I have one question though. I have never mixed the 2, it has been ages since I have had GHB and I will not get to really test run the with your GHB because I have a feeling it will arrive either the night before or the same day as my wife and I are planning to take MDMA. So, now to the question.<br /><br />Should we both start with .5g and roll with it from there? I do know I am only going to make up a total of 1 gram a piece for my wife and I. This way we can stay in control. I do not want to get to silly. <br /><br />Let me know your thoughts.

If daily for a long time then sure, some tolerance will be built - but under more &quot;conventional use&quot; this is generally not the case.<br /><br />GHB vs benzos: I&#039;m not 100% sure on this. Yes GHB and benzos both affect GABA receptors, but GABA-A for benzos and&nbsp; GABA-B for GHB, and the overall mechanism of action is not identical comparing the two. I would expect the potential for some cross-tolerance, but only some. Experimentation as always is the way. I&#039;m not into benzos so would not do that experiment myself. Anyone else have any real-life input with this one?<br /><br />I would exercise some caution with Viagra as it does decrease blood pressure to a degree - and with GHB this could be enhanced - more than one wants. Not saying no - just proceed with care.<br /><br />Ditto with poppers for the same reasons.<br /><br />With methamphetamine should be fine - and probably pretty good actually :)<br /><br />GHB taken early on or prior to MDMA just seems to not work that well. I don&#039;t know why this is so - I just know it doesn&#039;t feel as good as when taken during the MDMA comedown...<br /><br />BG

I have some Super Trips MDMA arriving soon and I am really looking forward to the mix when the MDMA magic starts to slip away. I have one question though. I have never mixed the 2, it has been ages since I have had GHB and I will not get to really test run the with your GHB because I have a feeling it will arrive either the night before or the same day as my wife and I are planning to take MDMA. So, now to the question.<br /><br />Should we both start with .5g and roll with it from there? I do know I am only going to make up a total of 1 gram a piece for my wife and I. This way we can stay in control. I do not want to get to silly. <br /><br />Let me know your thoughts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When transitioning from MDMA to GHB I like to go in a little higher - about 1 - 1.5g (for 70kg body weight) as an initial dose, and then follow with 0.5g - 1g every 30-45 minutes. Adjust for body weight for your wife and then deduct 25% to account for women&#039;s greater sensitivity to GHB (not sure why this is but appears to be so).<br /><br />Silly is good ;)<br /><br />Enjoy amigo!

[And these doses are all presupposing a relatively empty stomach and no other depressant drugs being taken concurrently.]<br /><br />Essentially these guidelines are for those starting out with GHB - and merely as a basis upon which people can figure out what works for them. And starting low while building experience is always the best way.<br /><br />And for the record, &quot;passing out&quot; (read &quot;falling asleep&quot;) is not such a big deal, and can be quite pleasant in a supportive circumstance (though of course one misses out on the fun). It is not inherently dangerous - but best to stay awake ultimately...<br /><br />BG

				1. Yes. Though the capsules may take on some moisture after a couple days due to GHB&#039;s hygroscopic nature.<br />2. Depends. Enough GHB will always put you down - build it up slow until you&#039;re feeling sleepy - will always work.

And if you know your body, your drugs and your limits very well you can play there. However, on an open forum such as this where many people do not have the experience I must make the point I made. It&#039;s a responsibility I feel as a vendor. Every issue with GHB that has ever happened has been when there has been bad combining with other depressants. On its own there have been no serious issues at all.<br /><br />BG

				As promised - sorry for the delay...<br /><br /><br />GHB: ART OF DOSING TUTORIAL<br />===========================<br /><br />In order to fully enjoy the depth and subtlety of the euphoria that GHB can facilitate, careful attention needs to be give to understanding it’s dosing dynamics.<br /><br />Probably more than any other drug, how it is used (dosage size and spacing), has a radical effect on the experience.<br /><br />Those who have taken the time to understand how to dose GHB, recognize it as one of the most glorious drug-induced experiences on the planet.<br /><br />So to begin:<br /><br />Firstly, this thread is dealing with Na-GHB (the sodium salt) and all values given are for this. K-GHB (the potassium salt) is approximately 13% weaker, gram for gram, than Na-GHB, so 1g of Na-GHB is the equivalent of 1.13g K-GHB, i.e. you need a bit more K-GHB to get the same buzz.<br /><br />Secondly, I am only addressing GHB powder here. GHB liquid varies (in terms of the GHB dilution ratio) to such a degree that I would not even attempt to address its dosing dynamics here. Also the quality of commonly available liquid GHB&#039;s are generally not up to the same standard of powder GHB&#039;s, so I do not, as a general rule, recommend them.<br /><br />With that clear we can proceed :)<br /><br />Strangely, even accounting for body weight, ladies seem to require a little less GHB than gents in order to get the same effect. I have no idea why this is so, but experience seems to indicate such. How much exactly is hard to say and probably varies from person to person, put work on about 15% - 25% difference, i.e. if you weigh the same (let’s hope not!) and you (as a man) take two grams then she’s going to want 1.5g – 1.7g to be in the same zone.<br /><br />And it is good to account for body weight too. Someone weighing twice as much as someone else will generally require twice as much GHB (maybe a little less) for the same experience.<br /><br />Knowing these basics, they key to the whole thing is calibration, especially if you have more than one person and you’d all like to feel kinda the same. So if you each start with a gram, and one person gets it quicker and stronger then you know to decrease their dose slightly on the next dose.<br /><br />In general GHB is more pleasurable to build up slowly (in the same way one would use alcohol), rather than taking a large single dose and getting in there properly, as one would want to do with MDMA. <br /><br />That being said, it can also be pleasurable to take a larger single dose (2g – 2.5g depending on your weight) especially after MDMA if one wants to kick the MDMA euphoria back in properly. As always, experiment cautiously and progressively and build up experience with the drug.<br /><br />Our packages are supplied with a 2ml measuring spoon. When level and lightly shaken (i.e. the GHB not compressed in it), it measures out about 0.75g – 1.25g. I do suggest though, if you’re wanting to be scientific, to calibrate the spoon with your own scale.<br /><br />In my experience this is a good standard “per dose” benchmark and one that I personally use.<br /><br />GHB is active from about 0.5g upwards, 3g is around the maximum for a single dose (this will be pretty strong), but one could easily go though 5g - 6g in an evening of merriment and re-dosing. In terms of toxicity I have personally tested 10g in a single dose to ascertain safety, and while it knocked me out cold in about 15 minutes and I woke up vomiting, I was otherwise fine. This is mentioned for reference only and I do not recommend going anywhere near this.<br /><br />The protocol I have found to be most pleasurable is to dose small amounts progressively. I am a 160 pound male and I normally take about 1g every 30 minutes until I am in the zone and then I level off (by perhaps taking about half that to maintain). That gram is normally taken in a wine glass of&nbsp; water (preferably spring or filtered). Sometimes I’ll throw it back, sometimes I’ll savour it over a few minutes. If I’m already strongly on, then I might sip that glass slowly over 20-25 minutes just to maintain the level that I’m at.<br /><br />So here at some options to play with in terms of a dosing protocol:<br /><br />1g every 25 – 35 minutes up to 3g – 4g total.<br />1.5g every 40 - 50 minutes up to 3g – 4g total.<br />2g every 55 – 65 minutes up to 3g – 4g in total<br /><br />These would be appropriate to my body weight (and my personal taste), and are given as examples only, but could be used as a basis for your own experimentation. Personally I like to get pretty wasted when I take GHB ☺ just because it’s so nice, and that would be about 3g – 4g for me. If was in a lighter kind of social situation, or dancing, or just hanging out then I might take a little less (up to 2g max) in order to be more functional. As always I would be calibrating and adjusting the dose as I proceed.<br /><br />It’s really something that can be dosed much like how we drink alcohol. Have a little, see how you feel, and have some more later if you need some more…<br /><br />In terms of using it with other drugs the following guidelines apply:<br /><br />Never take with other depressants, as has already been stated repeatedly. However, if you choose to break the rules (I never do) then know that there will be profound synergy and potentiation, so dosages should be radically lowererd.<br /><br />GHB combines very well with all stimulants – coke, speed, meth, caffeine etc. You will be able to push the doses a bit higher and still function. Normally if you take too much GHB you will simply start passing out and falling asleep. Stimulants allow you to go closer to the edge and still maintain conscious – which can be very pleasurable. Once again take time to get to know GHB before you start pushing that edge.<br /><br />When combining with psychedelics, empathogens and entactogens (all of which cocktail beautifully) dosages are generally neutral (not higher or lower). In general GHB works better after the other drugs rather than before, for example it is excellent post MDMA, but seems to interfere (for me anyway) with the MDMA rush if taken before hand. In my experience I also tend to favour a slightly larger dose (1.5g - 2.5g) when taken after MDMA as it seems to re-invigorate the rush better this way.<br /><br />Some people enjoy GHB with Cannabis a lot, for it’s not my personal favourite, as I find the GHB euphoria to be lessened somewhat for me - and I also generally prefer my Ganja unblended with anything else.<br /><br />GHB can essentially be re-dosed for many hours (if that is your choice) without tolerance building. Dosage just needs to be a maintained at a level that does not go too high. For example 1g sipped over the course of an hour can be repeated all night for a continual mellow buzz.<br /><br />If GHB is used for inducing sleep then it is recommended to take less than what is required, as if too much is taken (3g+) it will induce deep sleep quite quickly but then there may be a tendency to awaken about 4 hours later when the GHB wears off. Better to take a lower dose (1g – 2g) to cause some relaxation which can assist you to fall asleep rather than force it. Then the tendency to awaken later will be lessened.<br /><br />As a clinical anti-depressant I suggest 0.5g – 1g in a single dose, two to three times per day. Ideally it should be just below (or just on) threshold.<br /><br />Altogether, if some time is taken getting to know GHB , and conservative experimentation is engaged, then you will come to understand its overall dynamics as a drug. And with understanding comes the ability to use it intelligently. When used in this way it is one of the most useful chemical tools on the planet –broad in scope and able to reach deep into states of openness, catharsis and ecstasy– while also being one of the most benign drugs in existence <br /><br />Enjoy! I have been taking carefully measured doses as I write this to ensure that I’m communicating accurately - currently on 3.5g and having a whale of a time! ☺<br /><br />I wish you all extreme pleasure with this wonderful substance, and Great Golden Copulations!<br /><br />BlueGiraffe<br />

Stuff like MDMA, LSD, Shrooms, etc. can actually CURE people of the issues for which they would otherwise become enslaved to these doctor recommended treatments... that in itself is the main reason I take offense to the possibility that the medical industry somehow has my best interests in mind when getting me hooked on the very substances that end up causing people to kill themselves and others instead of just fixing the problem.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never taken GHB but my research into it seems to indicate that it has the ability to serve as a great mood elevator without too many bad side effects when taken at the right dose. Personally I probably wouldn&#039;t want to take it every day for the rest of my life but I can imagine something like it easily helping people that have the winter blues (aka S.A.D.) more than a a prescription of Prozac or Zoloft since a half hour after taking it you&#039;ll often feel a little better.

And GHB is actually a very good and very safe clinical anti-depressant. And will not &quot;lead to addiction&quot; as you suggest. Chronic, long-term, daily, high-dose use would not be good for sure (same goes for any drug), but when used clinically the dose is normally low - just sub-threshold, and is generally for a finite period of time (from a few weeks to a few months) rather than &quot;forever&quot;. And that&#039;s because it&#039;s actually supporting change and doing the job it is intended to do.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying any of this this because I sell GHB. I sell GHB because I understand its profound applicability to healing psychological issues (as well as being great to party on!). You may want to read this http://www.amazon.com/GHB-The-Natural-Mood-Enhancer/dp/0962741868 and the references in it - which will support my premise.<br /><br />To say it straight too: GHB as a clinical anti-depressant is a fuck side safer then just about anything else currently used clinically for that purpose - particularly the SSRI&#039;s which have become the universal &quot;panacea&quot; now. And the primary reason for this is that all of these drugs SUPPRESS psychological processing and emotional expression, so the issues are never dealt with. GHB however, when used clinically, allows a continual low-level catharsis, so emotional processing (and subsequent healing) ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE!<br /><br />I consider my suggestions as highly responsible in this regard, and stand by my POV that GHB is a safer clinical anti-depressant than almost anything else around.<br /><br />BG<br />

Heavy abuse will definitely lead to problems in time (as would anything of course).<br /><br />I highly recommend the book I just mentioned, GHB: The Natural Mood Enhancer by Dean and Morgenthaler. It&#039;s well researched and well presented - and will help to cut through a lot of the fluff and hype floating around. The links near the top of this thread are solid too.<br /><br />I appreciate your positive feedback (blush), and certainly chat with me if you want to make a purchase. IMHO it&#039;s very important to take high quality GHB if you&#039;re going to take it at all. There&#039;s so much half-rate GHB floating around, and many people base their impressions on that - of course with less than useful results. We&#039;re very proud of our GHB and it&#039;s been many years in the refining - you can trust the quality for sure.<br /><br />Any questions, feel free to ask, and I&#039;ll do my best to respond comprehensively.<br /><br />BG<br />

Mostly I just wanted to post to keep an eye on this thread and thank BG for all the info. I&#039;m relatively new to GHB and am still trying to figure out what&#039;s good info and what&#039;s grossly inaccurate (a challenge when researching any drug in my experience). <br /><br />I may be looking to make a purchase from you in the near future (pricier than some but it sounds like the price would be worth it and you definitely sound like you know your stuff, man!). <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with the first part. Disagree with the second part. <br />GHB withdrawal is even more severe than benzo withdrawal. Both are really REALLY awful.<br /><br />To come off effexor either benzo&#039;s or ghb can be used. Probably even barbiratures. (wasn&#039;ghb one in the past?).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Correct, GHB withdrawal can be intense, and there can be marked similarities with both benzo and alcohol withdrawal - see comprehensive and comparative information here: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ghb/ghb_addiction2.pdf<br /><br />It&#039;s important to note though that one has to work pretty hard to get to a place of necessitating going through this - normally some months of near continuous high-dose GHB use - which is clearly asking for trouble.<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

But it&#039;s always context dependent.<br /><br />There is no &quot;proof&quot; of anything ever. But my research and experience both indicate this efficacy. So it is always IMHO, but I feel clear saying it based on my understanding of healing psychosis (in the broadest meaning of that word) and emotional contraction and wounding. There is a lot of research you can access which also supports this POV.<br /><br />When I refer to GHB I am always assuming that it is actually proper (and properly produced) GHB. There would be no point otherwise. And we supply it in addition, so I tend not to belabor that point any further as it&#039;s been said.<br /><br />Regarding SSRI&#039;s I think the evidence is in, and has been for many years. They are extremely problematic, and do not cause healing - but merely suppress symptoms (which is the usual functional activity of Western Medicine).<br /><br />&quot;Chronic&quot; and &quot;high-dose&quot; in this context would mean dosing multiple grams (2g - 3g) every couple of hours and doing it day after day for extended periods of time. If you want to ask me what &quot;extended&quot; means, then it could be anything from a week to a year.<br /><br />I do not consider GBL a usable drug ever, but a somewhat toxic reagent used in the manufacture of GHB. I do not feel it has a place in the discussion of benign clinical pharmacology. I know many people use it as it bio-converts to GHB, but I consider this practice unintelligent. My personal point of view - I would never ingest it.<br /><br />If you read that paper it is evident that there are many similarities between GHB, benzo and alcohol withdrawal - with some more severe than others on different vectors.<br /><br />BG<br /><br /><br /><br />

And GHB is actually a very good and very safe clinical anti-depressant. And will not &quot;lead to addiction&quot; as you suggest. Chronic, long-term, daily, high-dose use would not be good for sure (same goes for any drug), but when used clinically the dose is normally low - just sub-threshold, and is generally for a finite period of time (from a few weeks to a few months) rather than &quot;forever&quot;. And that&#039;s because it&#039;s actually supporting change and doing the job it is intended to do.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying any of this this because I sell GHB.

No disrespect, but you&#039;re working it a bit my friend, and so I&#039;m responding directly. It really is worth properly researching a subject you intend to engage in.<br /><br />2. Xyrem is GHB (not something that is &quot;about the same&quot;). It&#039;s just the trade name for the FDA-approved product (I have looked into its spec BTW and it is lower than ours). It is a liquid.<br /><br />3. GBL is a strong solvent. It can strip paint off a wall and dissolve hard glue and engine grease for fuck&#039;s sake. I would never in a million years put GBL in my body even if it was 99.99999% pure and given to me for free. While it will metabolize in the body to GHB it is clearly a toxin and will stress the liver, kidneys and pancreas while it is metabolizing. I notice from your vendor page that you are presently having a &quot;HUGE sellout of GBL/GHB&quot; so I understand you wanting to promote that point of view on this thread. I humbly suggest you start a new thread for that though, as you will get only disagreement for me here regarding this point. <br /><br />4. You say &quot;In my experience, ghb has not proven to be useful for a clinical depression.&quot;. What experience is this? I&#039;m curious, because in my research and experience with this compound (over 15 years) I have found that it is profoundly useful and safe when used clinically, and properly managed. Your comments about its addiction dynamics are simply wrong. It has to be used with care and there are always risks that need to be managed (same for any drug used in a clinical context), but&nbsp; I can see that your understanding of how it actually works clinically is not well informed. For the record you will see that I used the words &quot;healing psychosis (in the broadest meaning of that word)&quot;. Psychosis meaning essentially dysfunction at any level of the mechanisms of the mind - so a relevant choice of words.<br /><br />5. MOST IMPORTANT: I can see from many posts you have made (including this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95200 and this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101553) that you are asking newbie type questions relating to synthesizing GHB and that you also have an active working relationship with psychonaughty, and appear to be making GHB together with him. From the questions he asked me by PM and on the threads above, he is undoubtedly one of the most irresponsible amateur &quot;bath tub&quot; GHB chemists I have come across. Clearly not that into research neither. If what you are giving away as free samples and selling from your vendor page is the GHB that the two of you have been trying to cook up of late then I think you are being really irresponsible. I&#039;m sorry, I would not normally make any criticism of you publicly on this forum, but you did come onto my thread and start working it (probably about 3 or 4 niggly posts from you over the last few days). So now I&#039;m saying it.<br /><br />So blessings and good luck to you dude. I hope my comments can be received in good spirit - and that you can work out your synth properly. I mean no ill-will at all, but all of us can sometimes be served by being told where we&#039;re at. It&#039;s all about growth my friend.<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

				Imma going to do this this way, these quote images are making me feel trippy.<br /><br />@ BlueGiraffe:<br />&quot;Virmo,<br /><br />1. By your own admission you&#039;re lazy and don&#039;t do real research. Therefore you are out of your depth in this conversation and it is showing. No disrespect, but you&#039;re working it a bit my friend, and so I&#039;m responding directly. It really is worth properly researching a subject you intend to engage in.&quot;<br /><br />No comment :p<br /><br />&quot;2. Xyrem is GHB (not something that is &quot;about the same&quot;). It&#039;s just the trade name for the FDA-approved product (I have looked into its spec BTW and it is lower than ours). It is a liquid.&quot;<br />Taken from:<br />http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000593/human_med_001163.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d124<br /><br />Xyrem is an oral solution, which contains the active substance sodium oxybate (500 mg/ml).<br /><br />Wikipedia: <br />&quot;γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), also known as 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, is a naturally occurring substance found in the human central nervous system, as well as in wine, beef, small citrus fruits, and almost all animals in small amounts.[1] It is also categorized as an illegal drug in many countries.[2] It is currently regulated in Australia and New Zealand, Canada, most of Europe and in the US. GHB as the sodium salt, known as sodium oxybate (INN) or by the trade name Xyrem,[3] is used to treat cataplexy[4] and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy.&quot;<br /><br />Ok so Xyrem equals GHB. Then some other sites made me confused.<br />Xyrem is really expensive, and made by pharms.<br />Pharms want money, they create diseases, they create cures. Actually, I&#039;m not 100% sure, but I think the Pharms kind of control the world. They already control the outcome of research by giving researchers a lot of money to research a. When you search for a, you will find a. <br />There is not enough money to research b. Researchers who do b, are willing to go for truth over job. Then will lead an awful life and die.<br />Just like it has always been.<br /><br />From that Xyrem site again:<br />&quot;The most common side effects with Xyrem (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are dizziness, headache and nausea (feeling sick). Nausea is more common in women than in men. Xyrem can also cause respiratory depression (inhibition of breathing). For the full list of all side effects reported with Xyrem, see the package leaflet.<br /><br />Xyrem should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to sodium oxybate or any of the other ingredients. It must not be used in patients with major depression, in patients with ‘succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency’ (a rare metabolic disease), or in patients being treated with opioids (such as some painkillers) or barbiturates (such as some anaesthetics and medicines used to prevent seizures). Because sodium oxybate can be abused, doctors must carefully monitor patients using Xyrem.&quot;<br /><br />That is a lying bitch website!<br /><br />&quot;3. GBL is a strong solvent. It can strip paint off a wall and dissolve hard glue and engine grease for fuck&#039;s sake. I would never in a million years put GBL in my body even if it was 99.99999% pure and given to me for free. While it will metabolize in the body to GHB it is clearly a toxin and will stress the liver, kidneys and pancreas while it is metabolizing. I notice from your vendor page that you are presently having a &quot;HUGE sellout of GBL/GHB&quot; so I understand you wanting to promote that point of view on this thread. I humbly suggest you start a new thread for that though, as you will get only disagreement for me here regarding this point. &quot;<br /><br />You really do not know what gbl is or you are playing stupid or you are trying to black-talk me.<br /><br />You ingest substances covering a big Ph range.<br /><br />You can certainly dissolve gbl into something acidic and ingest it.<br />Yes your liver and kidneys will have to work harder. But how much? I have no idea.<br /><br />I would never recommend anybody ingesting gbl as it is, or putting it in some 100ml juice/whatever acidic as a shot.<br />Ghb IS better for your body than gbl.<br /><br />Your words about my sellout I do not understand. Many people never even used ghb, only gbl. I give advice and try to get people so far as to not poisoning themselves.<br />BTW, you need gbl to make ghb salts.. So what is your problem again?<br /><br />&quot;4. You say &quot;In my experience, ghb has not proven to be useful for a clinical depression.&quot;. What experience is this? I&#039;m curious, because in my research and experience with this compound (about 15 years) I have found that it is profoundly useful and safe when used clinically, and properly managed. Your comments about its addiction dynamics are simply wrong. It has to be used with care and there are always risks that need to be managed (same for any drug used in a clinical context), but&nbsp; I can see that your understanding of how it actually works clinically is not well informed. For the record you will see that I used the words &quot;healing psychosis (in the broadest meaning of that word)&quot;. Psychosis meaning essentially dysfunction at any level of the mechanisms of the mind - so a relevant choice of words.&quot;<br /><br />Yes it just hasn&#039;t, unfortunately. I wish it was. <br />We just have different experiences, you had good ones, I am glad for you for that.<br />No need to flame me here. Chill.<br /><br />Xyrem equals GHB. I apologize for being confused about what is and isn&#039;t in it now.<br /><br />The website sais it&#039;s bad for mdd treatment. But this is what I do not understand.<br />I know the whole pharmacy &quot;conspiracy&quot; story. <br />But why are they switching more and more to antidepressants and antipsychotics instead of all the old stuff that DID work? And with Xyrem they would make tons of money, more than by selling many antidepressants they do now.<br />Nobody knows the truth about that, or ever will, unfortunately.<br />I&#039;m not taking the words of that website into here to back up my supposed claim that ghb is not good for treatment of mdd.<br />Remember: all I said was, use your words carefully when doing recommendations like that.<br /><br />There are also many things people should avoid when taking ghb. You are recommending poly-drug use. This confuses me.<br /><br />&quot;5. MOST IMPORTANT:&quot;<br /><br />Please remove this. We do not ship stuff to people that might be harmful. You can only trust me on this one. I could not live with myself otherwise.<br />Any other words I must omit, because you are of threatening identities here.<br /><br />&quot;So blessings and good luck to you dude. I hope my comments can be received in good spirit - and that you can work out your synth properly. I mean no ill-will at all, but all of us can sometimes be served by being told where we&#039;re at. It&#039;s all about growth my friend.&quot;<br /><br />Same to you. We should have pm&#039;ed though. Which I will actually do now for a request.<br />Your words are received in good spirit.<br /><br />

				wanted to pitch in with my personal experience of using GHB with amyl nitirites so other people may some day find it.<br /><br /><br />i am a very experienced user of amyl nitrites- for me drug use (the sex drug use especially) requires them.. without amyl i couldnt be fucked doing drugs.. its like drugs are the song but amyl is the chorus.<br /><br />well anyway ive done lots of combos with drugs of all types with amyl.. and my recent venture into using GHB and amyl has shown me that for me, its NOT a good mix at all.<br /><br />i dont know what happens to me as im not a doctor or in a medical setting, but after i sniff the amyl when im on any drug and using ghb i just begin to feel nauseous, lightheaded and end up having to lay down for about 10 minutes.. it totally kills the amyl buzz. its just doing something that i know is not right for me.. so i cant entertain that combo again.. and ive tested this combo a good few times now<br /><br />so GHB for me, ghb will only ever used on its own from now on (unless i ditch the amyl for that session).. as an occasional sleep aid, social euphoriant alcohol replacement

We only ship twice a week. So if you order 5 minutes after we shipped, it will 3-4 days before we ship next.<br />2. We move product from another country to the UK and then ship from there - that adds another day or two.<br />3. Then it&#039;s 1st class Royal Mail from there. That takes as long as it takes and is normally pretty quick. Obviously we&#039;ve just come through the Christmas holidays which has added some delay to everyone&#039;s order.<br /><br />Currently we are looking at delivery taking between 2-3 weeks, though sometimes it is quicker - we&#039;ve had some landing in about a week recently, but work on 2 weeks as a likely minimum.<br /><br />And we can&#039;t modify that system currently.<br /><br />BG<br />

Your re-ship went out on January 18th so hopefully will be with you soon.<br /><br />As it&#039;s your first order from us I obviously want you to get it before making a larger order! But once you have got this first one then just accept the 2-3 weeks and order earlier ;)<br /><br />Been a pleasure working with you and apologies for the missing parcel. It&#039;s been a long time so it&#039;s probably gone, but that said, a client received one the other day, 6 weeks after we had shipped it!

				We do know now that 1g of GHB does NOT get us there (We have learned that with practically every substance we use except alcohol, we need to double the regular dose to get the &#039;standard&#039; effects regular users get. This sucks because it means our chem costs effectively double and/or our stash-life halves!) *&#039;We&#039; means me, not two users*<br /><br />Last night (Saturday) we tried an eyeball dose of (20ug/30ug?) Moxy along with a measured&nbsp; 2g of GHB with titrated re-doses, we did &#039;feel&#039; it, as a woozy feeling, we did not get jiggy at all on this dose, so we think that we used too soon after that first ever and one-off 2.4g GHB dose, Thursday. <br /><br />We also re-dosed GHB 1g at 45 mins,<br />and nothing much happened,<br />&nbsp;then .60g at 40mins further in,<br />and finally 1g another 30mins in,<br />&nbsp;thereafter we decided to save what was left of the GHB cos this is just wasting it, to NO EFFECT.<br /><br />Bear in mind we&#039;re also bumping a shitload of good resiny weed, about every ten to twenty minutes, this combo should have knocked out a racehorse, but we&#039;re like &#039;Ok when is this combo of aphrodisacs gonna show us some love?&#039;<br /><br />We just got moderately (THC) high last night, the rest GHB+Moxy was wasted. <br /><br />We are not long term users of anything, have been otherwise clean since last April, what the fuck is up with us?<br /><br />FOOTNOTE: We ate a small clementine/mandarin to chase the Moxy cause the taste was bitterly horrible.<br />We were once told that Orange juice can abort a Mushroom trip, wondering if citric acid may have fucked with these chems in some way?

				Update:<br /><br />We let 4 days pass (since above post) and decided to have another GHB solo session on a whim late last night.<br /><br />We re-read BG dosage post again, and reckoning by our own relative inexperience, plus the fact we know we need to dose on the high side with most chems to get effects, <br />This is how it went: (24hr clock used)<br /><br />01:25&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.6g in an inch or two lukewarm water<br />01:35&nbsp; &nbsp; Definitely feel that G-like intoxication, nice buzzy feeling, similar, but very much more pleasant than, being &#039;tipsy&#039;. <br />01:45&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly feeling very erotic.

It also allows better graduation of dosage - i.e. you have access to 3mg, 6mg, 9mg, 12mg etc. <br /><br />2C-B is also very nice at low doses. Going out to a fine dinner on 5mg is wonderful.

I&#039;m 250 lbs, so a big boy, and gave 1.5g a go mixed in water and felt a slight buzz off that in about 15-20 minutes. Assuming the stuff I got is similar to BG&#039;s, I would keep the dosing criteria pretty close to heart. Start small and top off over time. The biggest risk with this stuff seems to be deciding that you aren&#039;t feeling it and increasing the dose before the previous dose hit. It stays in the system for a good long time so those redoses add up pretty fast. <br /><br />I still haven&#039;t found a good replacement for that little blue pill, although my little test last night was no where near enough to get me &quot;Happy&quot; and my GF was already asleep. What we really need on the road is someone that sells Viagra powder like they do with Xanax. If you ever need a clearnet link for where to get some cheap pills I normally source mine at about 60 cents each for 100mg pills&nbsp; in quantities of 60 or more. Since I normally only need about 25-50mg for my business, the pills end up lasting a good long time. Come to think of it I might need to open a vendor account and start reselling the stuff since it all seems to sell for about two bucks for 100mg pill on here... might be a new way to pay for my other hobbies!

				DiamondSky,<br />When Vitamin V proprietary rights expired, the Indian chemists made a nice little copy called Kamagra. It sells on the streets of Bangkok (and probably elsewhere) for around 100bt. USD $3 +/- a sachet. it is a flavoured gel, one sachet lasts 12-24 hours. Contains same chem as what Viagra contains.<br />We have not searched for it online, but you might wanna source and try? It has helped us with meth-droop in the past, does the job! ;D<br />&nbsp;

				GHB with MDPV?<br />Any input greatly appreciated?<br /><br />MDPV mimics coke,meth, and a bit of MDMA and GHB fit&#039;s in perfectly in that sense to ease it. or potentate&nbsp; it? <br />But health wise, trip wise????<br />

				BlueGiraffe, I was able to try out LSD + MDMA + 2C-B + GHB (went ahead and added 2C-B) this past weekend and I fell in complete love with GHB (took 1g at T+8:00 and then sipped on 2g over the next two hours). The stomach issues I experienced in the past were completely absent and the intoxicating effects added beautifully to a very psychedelic comedown. It offered for some great social interaction between me and my two friends where we reminisced for hours and allowed me to drift into a wonderful ~4 hour coma at T+12:00ish. Also, had I been around a lady, I&#039;m fairly certain I would have had some absolutely profound sex. My tactile sensations were very, very erotic in nature. You&#039;ve made me a believer in GHB, my friend. Much love to you! :D

				TK1991- That excites the hell out of me! I imagine the erotic nature of the substance would shine even more, as with MDMA ^_^<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try it as soon as I get an order in- will report back with results.

				Hey all just posting to say I got a solid offer from BG and it came in and I have to say his packaging stealth is phenomenal. I haven&#039;t been this solidly impressed by a packaging since my first order with Shroomeister! That said, I haven&#039;t tried any of it yet but the product looks solid and I cannot find a reason why I&#039;d need to complain. BG has proved himself a superb communicator on the forums and as a vendor and is extremely helpful, especially in regards to educating and harm reduction and I highly recommend him.<br /><br />BlueGiraffe: you can now find yourself on my recommended vendors list. I&#039;m happy to support your venture and if you want me to add your link to my vendor list just give me the go ahead and I&#039;ll add it. <br /><br />Cheers and I&#039;ll update with an actual review when I&#039;ve had a chance to use the product<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				From Erowid:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Erowid</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">While fatalities with ketamine use as the sole cause of death are rare, they are not unheard of.1,2,3 More commonly, however, other substances are involved in addition to ketamine. Depressants such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB, or alcohol can amplify ketamine&#039;s suppressant effects on breathing and heart rate, possibly causing cardiovascular and respiratory functions to slow down to dangerous levels or discontinue altogether. In one fatality case, where the death was attributed to ketamine in combination with another dissociative anaesthetic and tranquilizer known as Telazol, the autopsy revealed cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen).4 In another case, asthma was listed as a joint cause of death along with ketamine,2 again most likely due to the respiratory suppressant effect of the substance.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I stand corrected.

				Actually Ketamine is considered a dissociative but the effects are not a stimulant but a depressant. Therefore mixing GHB with Ketamine is a BIG NO NO.

The biggest concern for me would be starting at a low dose and working up real slow. With substances like MDMA I know how a plugged dose varies from an oral dose but with GHB it could be a whole different world. Studies rate the oral bio-availability of GHB to be anywhere from 25% to 65% which means if plugging increases the bio-availability to near 100% like it does for many drugs, the safest starting point would be 25% of a normal dose. As weird as it is, since the side effects of an OD on GHB can be passing out and possibly throwing up, so you might want to elicit a sitter for this little experiment just in case you end up on your back pretty quick.<br /><br />Not trying to scare you at all. If I had some left I would try it myself. Just want to make sure you are alive and able to come back and tell us how it goes.

I&#039;m sure you COULD theoretically but really I guess I&#039;m asking..<br />Would it be uncomfortable?<br />Would it come up faster/hit harder?<br />Would it require less?<br />Just curious, as always :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey TK (and everyone)<br /><br />Apologies, I&#039;ve been off the forums for a while - had some important stuff to deal with IRL...<br /><br />This is a great first question to come back to! :)<br /><br />And fuck I don&#039;t know the answer! I&#039;m sure one could, and it would probably work well - small amount of warm water, smooth slippery syringe - sounding enticing already ;)<br /><br />TK, I think you just volunteered to be the one to do the experiment and report back! Probably it will be more active so start with a smaller dose than usual.<br /><br />We eagerly await your write-up...<br /><br />Love<br /><br />BG<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah not a lot of information on plugging GHB and I&#039;m a plugger of most everything myself. The biggest concern for me would be starting at a low dose and working up real slow. With substances like MDMA I know how a plugged dose varies from an oral dose but with GHB it could be a whole different world. Studies rate the oral bio-availability of GHB to be anywhere from 25% to 65% which means if plugging increases the bio-availability to near 100% like it does for many drugs, the safest starting point would be 25% of a normal dose. As weird as it is, since the side effects of an OD on GHB can be passing out and possibly throwing up, so you might want to elicit a sitter for this little experiment just in case you end up on your back pretty quick.<br /><br />Not trying to scare you at all. If I had some left I would try it myself. Just want to make sure you are alive and able to come back and tell us how it goes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the detailed input.<br /><br />BG<br />

				I arrived my package today, the winnings of the BG lottery!<br /><br />I&#039;ve got to say, BG, you are a genius. Stealth is so... inventive. I wanted to grab you&#039;re PGP key first thing this morning and just rant and rant and rant about how awesome the packaging is, but I&#039;m sure you know *big hug* To say as little as possible and still get my point across, stealth is excellent and I have no doubt that it would get to it&#039;s destination, and would fit in very well with ebay/amazon purchases. Perfect.<br /><br />Well I was so happy to get my package today, I thought I would be waiting a few weeks longer. But it looks like BG overshoots his delivery times to be extra safe, because this landed way before he quoted me :)<br /><br />Product was OVERWEIGHT haha I couldn&#039;t believe it! Like I said this was practically free, and BG still went to the point of giving me extra... He&#039;s too sweet. Really a very nice vendor, intelligent (answered about a billion and one questions via PM and was happy to do so) and collected (other vendor bashing his product/business. Responded quickly informatively and honestly, without losing his cool) he is definitely informed and has researched his products extensively. <br /><br />Responded within 12 hours of every question I asked, when provided with a question he could not immediately answer he was honest, and told me he would look into it. Sure enough, 12 hours later, there was my response, communication is 6/5<br /><br />As for the product... well. I have agreed to do a sort of &quot;trip report&quot; regarding a specific ROA. So I will have that all written up when the time comes, but as a control test I was planning on taking some tonight with my hubby (Male 280lbs Female 150lb) in 0.25g capsules I have made in advance to help does accurately. <br /><br />This could be copy/pasted to a review thread (by me) if one exists BG? And also wondering when the next day I should expect tolerance to be completely gone by would be? Probably about a week I was thinking but I want to report to be as accurate as possible.<br /><br />Thanks all and I can&#039;t wait to write up a report this evening

				Finally got a chance to experiment with some of BG&#039;s GHB. 0 previous experience with it, and have to say it&#039;s quite interesting but not very overwhelming.<br /><br />I started out with 3.0g right off the bat, downed it pretty quick. After a little bit, i felt really good / happy, but nothing really crazy at all. Smoked some weed and that helped a bit, but i just felt unsatisfied, like i wanted more. i felt like i needed a beer or more G/other drugs. I can really see how people can overdo it because i just had general cravings of anything lol. It seemed to wear off after about an hour and a half or so. then re-dosed another 2g, but didn&#039;t feel a whole lot.<br /><br />does that sound normal? do i need to do more? is G just simply not a strong drug? perhaps my expectations were too high...btw, i&#039;m 160lb male and experienced with lots of other drugs... MDMA, MDA, mushrooms, LSD, changa, coke, liquor, weed.<br />

				Hey all, so I&#039;m back with a review of BG&#039;s GHB: <br /><br />I thought it was great, high quality GHB. Product gives that salty, GHB taste and dissolves quick and easy--I got 800mg easily dissolved in about 2/3 a shot glass of water. I had a couple beers (not great harm reduction but I spaced it out a bit) and did the first 800 followed by another 400mg after about 20 minutes or so and got to a pretty good spot. I got to feeling really nice and warm not too long after the second dose and my hands were good and toasty (maybe a weird effect to enjoy but I love it). Further, it just had me feeling good and relaxed and I was really enjoying my friends&#039; company. I had been up quite a while by the time I took this and we were watching a movie that I wanted to finish so I didn&#039;t want to push my dose any higher and risk getting too drowsy but I feel comfortable in vouching for the cleanliness and quality of BG&#039;s product.<br /><br />Unlike other dose times when I have started to get in the 1g+ range (I&#039;ve taken 1.6g and been pretty floored of other GHB) I have experienced dizziness and nausea. Despite the other drugs I&#039;d taken that evening I did not experience either of those effects (getting up for my second dose did have me feeling a little off balance in a fun way though). <br /><br />I don&#039;t feel this is especially descriptive but I hope it paints a starting picture. It may be a few days before I have another opportunity to enjoy this lovely drug so I will likely post another experience then. <br /><br />Until then, thanks to BG for providing a superb product and keep at it! :D<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				*****NOTE: DISCLAIMER - I&#039;VE NEVER DONE GHB BEFORE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO EFFECT ME*****<br />Female 150lbs - TK<br />Male 280lbs - &quot;J&quot;<br /><br />0:00 Taken GHB in a glass of room temperature water, 0.5g for TK and 1.0g for J. I&#039;m feeling kind of dirty from running around all day so I want to jump into the shower. We both take our starting doses and I announce I&#039;m going to shower, J comes with me for &quot;my own safety.&quot;&nbsp; (LOL)<br /><br />0:30 Feeling something, not quite intoxicated. Going to watch TV for another half hour and redose accordingly. Ate a reasonble sized dinner at approx -0:30 so thinking it may take a minute to hit me. Talked to a friend on TorChat for awhile waiting for the clock.<br /><br />1:00 J takes 1.5g TK takes 1.0g<br />Not feeling much of anything from the initial dose, eagerly swalled 1.0g in capsules and J took 1.0g in capsules and 0.5g in cold water. J has prepared 1.0g in another glass of water aswell, but is waiting another half hour to take it. Feeling mildly uninhibited, feeling maybe more open than before. Weird behind the eye pressure (not unlike THC) causing my eyes to drift around the room. Slight headache aswell but that could just be me over analyzing myself. Going to continue on watching tv, probably smoke some cannabis in the next&nbsp; half hour, will decide on redosing in another half hour. Feeling maybe a bit more relaxed than normal, nothing as extreme as to leave me sensless and easily rape-able :P<br /><br />1:30 TK takes 1.0g J takes 1.0g<br />Feeling a bit of of intoxication now, clear headed and happy but not quite euphoric. Me and my partner are happily chatting and laughing about the TV show we were previously uninvested in. Less desire in typing/chatting or posting online, more inclined to think introspectively, but not as intensely or abruptly as ketamine. Happily reflecting on myself. J seems to be the same, still playing a game online. He asks me to come sit with him, so we are snuggling on our couch now.<br /><br />2:15 TK takes 1.0g J takes 2.0g By this point it is established I like to drink it and J rather take the capsules.<br />&nbsp;Not feeling over intoxicated, just sensual and relaxed. While snuggling I get excited very easily and start playing with J, he is reluctant at first but soon gets very excited aswell, much more than normal. He says this is the first real effect he&#039;s felt of the GHB so far. We have sex quickly and animalistically and we finish just in time to dose again (2:05-2:10). J says he is hungry and make naan crackers with tzadsziki. J says he has to work early tomorrow morning and will likely redose one or two more times. I am more likely to dose more throughout the night so I go more slowly.<br /><br />About 10 minutes after this dose I start to feel a bit lucid and day dreamy (2:25) and I want to smoke more cannabis but cannot seem to find the jar. (I don&#039;t believe this is due to the GHB?)<br /><br />2:45 J is feeling pretty intoxicated and report his eyes are &quot;tripping straight balls,&quot; when he tries to look at something he says his eyes wander.&nbsp; He is trying to write on a website but says he will try again tomorrow. I am having a hard time keeping focus, between looking for the jar, typing the report, dosing some juice to drink, and watching TV. Movement is more deliberate and thought out to avoid unneccesary drain, definitely the product of relaxation and intoxication.<br /><br />3:00 TK takes 1.0g and J takes 1.0g<br />Feeling good but not as intense as I thought. The next report I will try plugging instead and see how I am effected but right now I am not overly impressed. Very clean, good feelings being had by all, just not as potent as I thought. This being said I&#039;ve never tried GHB before, for all I know this could be insanely potent. Going to take a much larger dose before I sleep tonight. This being said I am already starting to get sleepy. Can already sense that my updates will be shorter and will make less sense then before (Less sense then now? Hmm interesting)<br /><br />3:30 TK takes 1.0g orally and 0.5g rectally. J takes 1.0g orally and says he will sleep soon.<br />Feeling sleepy, I feel like this would be perfect for the end of a stim high like MDMA or cocaine. Meth would also be quite enjoyable mixed with this substance. Syringes are kind of big to be able to fit so much GHB, wish I WAS high so I was a bit more excitable at this point, maybe a bit wetter :P <br /><br />5:00 J fell asleep, TK has been gradually plugging more and more GHB, about 2.0g<br />I don&#039;t think GHB is very bioavailable rectally or something, because I&#039;m not feeling much effect from this. Oh well, will try again on another day, starting with a much larger starting dose. The product seems to be good, I am just getting very sleep and need to put my hubby to bed. We had sex again and afterwords I fell asleep for at least 3 minutes in a state of deep relaxation. It would seem this substance is best paired with sex or stimulants.<br /><br />Thanks BG, I will do my best to do a write up (although I found it very difficult to write) for an exclusively plugged GHB experience<br /><br />*****NOTE: DISCLAIMER - I&#039;VE NEVER DONE GHB BEFORE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO EFFECT ME*****

I&#039;m off to erowid until I see your post :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />From our product page:<br /><br />In addition to our core GHB product, here is another little treat for you, and one which combines beautifully with GHB in fact :)<br /><br />A fine creation of the illustrious Dr. Alexander Shulgin, 5-MeO-MIPT (5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine) is one of the very rare Tryptamines that is both a Psychedelic (ala LSD, Mescaline, DMT) and an Entactogen (ala MDMA, 2C-B, MDE).<br /><br />Chemically, it is a small adjustment (replacing a methyl with an isopropyl group) on the more well-known 5-MeO-DMT, which is found in the venom of the toad Bufo Alvarius and in the resin of the Virola calophylla tree - both used as traditional Shamanic medicines in the Brazilian Amazon.<br /><br />This replacement of the methyl group with an isopropyl group makes this substance orally active at low doses without needing an MAOI, and also makes the experience less psychedelic and more heart-opening, tactile and pleasurable.<br /><br />Moxy is an excellent aphrodisiac and sexual enhancer. It is definitely psychedelic at higher doses, but comes on through the body, opening the lungs and creating a deep emotional and tactile fullness. It improves sexual function, increases desire and profoundly enhances mental eroticism, emotional openness and tactile sensitivity.<br /><br />While it is not the same as empathogens like MDMA, it can be used in a similar way and in similar circumstances. It requires more participation than traditional empathogens and does not “push” you into an opened state. Rather it allows choice on how to feel and act while providing a similar heart-strength. And it creates a more natural, intelligent and coherent euphoria, with a clear mind-space and good energy. Communication is easy.<br /><br />Moxy works best when it is participated with – through breathing, moving, stretching, dancing and fucking. Any form of light touch or massage will also invigorate and expand Moxy’s activity. Being gently stimulating, it combines well with relaxants such as alcohol (just a little), GHB and 2C-C.<br /><br />It is also a full Tryptamine with all the associated richness, opulence, class and depth of this family of compounds. Larger doses will definitely provide a deep psychedelic space and will readily open all kinds of doors. But it always maintains the heart and has exquisite balance, so deep states are easily handled and integrated.<br /><br />Body-load is minimal to non-existent. The experience ends clean without much of a tail, and there is no post-trip downer.<br /><br />As 5-MeO-MIPT is very potent it, requires very accurate, precise and properly calibrated scales to weigh it safely. This is why we have bulked it up 110:1 with L-Arginine (with a dash of beetroot powder to create a fetching pink colour!) and packed it in Size 1 vegetable cellulose capsules. The L-Arginine is also a vasodilator which works to balance out the mild vasoconstricting effects of nearly all psychedelics - and will allow blood to flow strongly to those organs it needs to flow to ;)<br /><br />Material identity confirmed by GC-MS and NMR (and of course, bio-assay by me personally). Minimum purity assay of 99.5% by HPLC.<br /><br /><br />Dosage and Duration:<br /><br />1-3 capsules, 4-6 hours.<br /><br />One capsule: Kiss you…<br />Two capsules: Love you…<br />Three capsules: Spank you…<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Any specific questions, just ask :)<br /><br />BG<br />

MDMA, MDA, mushrooms, LSD, changa, coke, liquor, weed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A GHB hardhead I see!<br /><br />There&#039;s a good (albeit somewhat conservative) dosing tutorial on page 2 of this thread. I suggest experiment more. If you&#039;re kinda in the zone, but it&#039;s a bit light for you then feel free to push the dose. Just know that if you push it too far it will drop you. But if you can maintain the zone prior to being dropped you will be having a lot of fun :)<br /><br />BTW I personally find GHB more euphoric without Cannabis. <br /><br />And if you could have channeled that craving in the direction of your lover then it would all make sense. GHB best experienced with another ;)<br /><br />BG

Product gives that salty, GHB taste and dissolves quick and easy--I got 800mg easily dissolved in about 2/3 a shot glass of water. I had a couple beers (not great harm reduction but I spaced it out a bit) and did the first 800 followed by another 400mg after about 20 minutes or so and got to a pretty good spot. I got to feeling really nice and warm not too long after the second dose and my hands were good and toasty (maybe a weird effect to enjoy but I love it). Further, it just had me feeling good and relaxed and I was really enjoying my friends&#039; company. I had been up quite a while by the time I took this and we were watching a movie that I wanted to finish so I didn&#039;t want to push my dose any higher and risk getting too drowsy but I feel comfortable in vouching for the cleanliness and quality of BG&#039;s product.<br /><br />Unlike other dose times when I have started to get in the 1g+ range (I&#039;ve taken 1.6g and been pretty floored of other GHB) I have experienced dizziness and nausea. Despite the other drugs I&#039;d taken that evening I did not experience either of those effects (getting up for my second dose did have me feeling a little off balance in a fun way though). <br /><br />I don&#039;t feel this is especially descriptive but I hope it paints a starting picture. It may be a few days before I have another opportunity to enjoy this lovely drug so I will likely post another experience then. <br /><br />Until then, thanks to BG for providing a superb product and keep at it! :D<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re welcome :)<br /><br />Much more pleasure without the alcohol in your system though - it&#039;s not just a harm reduction thing. The alcohol dulls the GHB euphoria...<br /><br />Looking forward to your further feedback - and thanks for taking the time to review.<br /><br />BG<br />

I&#039;m feeling kind of dirty from running around all day so I want to jump into the shower. We both take our starting doses and I announce I&#039;m going to shower, J comes with me for &quot;my own safety.&quot;&nbsp; (LOL)<br /><br />0:30 Feeling something, not quite intoxicated. Going to watch TV for another half hour and redose accordingly. Ate a reasonble sized dinner at approx -0:30 so thinking it may take a minute to hit me. Talked to a friend on TorChat for awhile waiting for the clock.<br /><br />1:00 J takes 1.5g TK takes 1.0g<br />Not feeling much of anything from the initial dose, eagerly swalled 1.0g in capsules and J took 1.0g in capsules and 0.5g in cold water. J has prepared 1.0g in another glass of water aswell, but is waiting another half hour to take it. Feeling mildly uninhibited, feeling maybe more open than before. Weird behind the eye pressure (not unlike THC) causing my eyes to drift around the room. Slight headache aswell but that could just be me over analyzing myself. Going to continue on watching tv, probably smoke some cannabis in the next&nbsp; half hour, will decide on redosing in another half hour. Feeling maybe a bit more relaxed than normal, nothing as extreme as to leave me sensless and easily rape-able :P<br /><br />1:30 TK takes 1.0g J takes 1.0g<br />Feeling a bit of of intoxication now, clear headed and happy but not quite euphoric. Me and my partner are happily chatting and laughing about the TV show we were previously uninvested in. Less desire in typing/chatting or posting online, more inclined to think introspectively, but not as intensely or abruptly as ketamine. Happily reflecting on myself. J seems to be the same, still playing a game online. He asks me to come sit with him, so we are snuggling on our couch now.<br /><br />2:15 TK takes 1.0g J takes 2.0g By this point it is established I like to drink it and J rather take the capsules.<br />&nbsp;Not feeling over intoxicated, just sensual and relaxed. While snuggling I get excited very easily and start playing with J, he is reluctant at first but soon gets very excited aswell, much more than normal. He says this is the first real effect he&#039;s felt of the GHB so far. We have sex quickly and animalistically and we finish just in time to dose again (2:05-2:10). J says he is hungry and make naan crackers with tzadsziki. J says he has to work early tomorrow morning and will likely redose one or two more times. I am more likely to dose more throughout the night so I go more slowly.<br /><br />About 10 minutes after this dose I start to feel a bit lucid and day dreamy (2:25) and I want to smoke more cannabis but cannot seem to find the jar. (I don&#039;t believe this is due to the GHB?)<br /><br />2:45 J is feeling pretty intoxicated and report his eyes are &quot;tripping straight balls,&quot; when he tries to look at something he says his eyes wander.&nbsp; He is trying to write on a website but says he will try again tomorrow. I am having a hard time keeping focus, between looking for the jar, typing the report, dosing some juice to drink, and watching TV. Movement is more deliberate and thought out to avoid unneccesary drain, definitely the product of relaxation and intoxication.<br /><br />3:00 TK takes 1.0g and J takes 1.0g<br />Feeling good but not as intense as I thought. The next report I will try plugging instead and see how I am effected but right now I am not overly impressed. Very clean, good feelings being had by all, just not as potent as I thought. This being said I&#039;ve never tried GHB before, for all I know this could be insanely potent. Going to take a much larger dose before I sleep tonight. This being said I am already starting to get sleepy. Can already sense that my updates will be shorter and will make less sense then before (Less sense then now? Hmm interesting)<br /><br />3:30 TK takes 1.0g orally and 0.5g rectally. J takes 1.0g orally and says he will sleep soon.<br />Feeling sleepy, I feel like this would be perfect for the end of a stim high like MDMA or cocaine. Meth would also be quite enjoyable mixed with this substance. Syringes are kind of big to be able to fit so much GHB, wish I WAS high so I was a bit more excitable at this point, maybe a bit wetter :P <br /><br />5:00 J fell asleep, TK has been gradually plugging more and more GHB, about 2.0g<br />I don&#039;t think GHB is very bioavailable rectally or something, because I&#039;m not feeling much effect from this. Oh well, will try again on another day, starting with a much larger starting dose. The product seems to be good, I am just getting very sleep and need to put my hubby to bed. We had sex again and afterwords I fell asleep for at least 3 minutes in a state of deep relaxation. It would seem this substance is best paired with sex or stimulants.<br /><br />Thanks BG, I will do my best to do a write up (although I found it very difficult to write) for an exclusively plugged GHB experience<br /><br />*****NOTE: DISCLAIMER - I&#039;VE NEVER DONE GHB BEFORE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO EFFECT ME*****<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great write-up TK!<br /><br />Play with it some more and try different dosing protocols.<br /><br />One way is larger dose upfront (2-3g and you&#039;ll know all about it), another way is smaller doses more frequently. What you were doing was good I think. If you changed your 30 minute intervals to 25 minutes for example you would have had a stronger effect.<br /><br />You&#039;re totally correct - sex and stimulants (particularly coke) are the best pairings. Also goes very well with the entactogens - 2C-B, Moxy etc<br /><br />Try it without Cannabis as well for comparison...<br /><br />And thanks for doing the plugging experiment!<br /><br />BG<br />

Is there a mg per kg table somewhere ? Any recommendations of dosage for someone who weighs 85 kg ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here is the dosage tutorial again - was originally posted in this thread earlier. As you&#039;re a bit heavier than me take a little more. Knowing how to dose GHB comes from experimentation and experience.<br /><br />BG<br /><br /><br />GHB: ART OF DOSING TUTORIAL<br />===========================<br /><br />In order to fully enjoy the depth and subtlety of the euphoria that GHB can facilitate, careful attention needs to be give to understanding it’s dosing dynamics.<br /><br />Probably more than any other drug, how it is used (dosage size and spacing), has a radical effect on the experience.<br /><br />Those who have taken the time to understand how to dose GHB, recognize it as one of the most glorious drug-induced experiences on the planet.<br /><br />So to begin:<br /><br />Firstly, this thread is dealing with Na-GHB (the sodium salt) and all values given are for this. K-GHB (the potassium salt) is approximately 13% weaker, gram for gram, than Na-GHB, so 1g of Na-GHB is the equivalent of 1.13g K-GHB, i.e. you need a bit more K-GHB to get the same buzz.<br /><br />Even accounting for body weight, ladies seem to require less GHB than gents in order to get the same effect. I have no idea why this is so, but experience seems to indicate such. How much exactly is hard to say and probably varies from person to person, put work on about 15% - 25% difference, i.e. if you weigh the same (let’s hope not!) and you (as a man) take two grams then she’s going to want 1.5g – 1.7g to be in the same zone.<br /><br />And it is good to account for body weight too. Someone weighing twice as much as someone else will generally require twice as much GHB (maybe a little less) for the same experience.<br /><br />Knowing these basics, they key to the whole thing is calibration, especially if you have more than one person and you’d all like to feel kinda the same. So if you each start with a gram, and one person gets it quicker and stronger then you know to decrease their dose slightly on the next dose.<br /><br />In general GHB is more pleasurable to build up slowly (in the same way one would use alcohol), rather than taking a large single dose and getting in there properly, as one would want to do with MDMA.<br /><br />That being said, it can also be pleasurable to take a larger single dose (2g – 2.5g depending on your weight) especially after MDMA if one wants to kick the MDMA euphoria back in properly. As always, experiment cautiously and progressively and build up experience with the drug.<br /><br />Our packages are supplied with a 2ml measuring spoon. When level and lightly shaken (i.e. the GHB not compressed in it), it measures out about 0.75g – 1.25g. I do suggest though, if you’re wanting to be scientific, to calibrate the spoon with your own scale.<br /><br />In my experience this is a good standard “per dose” benchmark and one that I personally use.<br /><br />GHB is active from about 0.5g upwards, 3g is around the maximum for a single dose (this will be pretty strong), but one could easily go though 5g - 6g in an evening of merriment and re-dosing. In terms of toxicity I have personally tested 10g in a single dose to ascertain safety, and while it knocked me out cold in about 15 minutes and I woke up vomiting, I was otherwise fine. This is mentioned for reference only and I do not recommend going anywhere near this.<br /><br />The protocol I have found to be most pleasurable is to dose small amounts progressively. I am a 160 pound male and I normally take about 1g every 30 minutes until I am in the zone and then I level off (by perhaps taking about half that to maintain). That gram is normally taken in a wine glass of water (preferably spring or filtered). Sometimes I’ll throw it back, sometimes I’ll savour it over a few minutes. If I’m already strongly on, then I might sip that glass slowly over 20-25 minutes just to maintain the level that I’m at.<br /><br />So here at some options to play with in terms of a dosing protocol:<br /><br />1g every 25 – 35 minutes up to 3g – 4g total.<br />1.5g every 40 - 50 minutes up to 3g – 4g total.<br />2g every 55 – 65 minutes up to 3g – 4g in total<br /><br />These would be appropriate to my body weight (and my personal taste), and are given as examples only, but could be used as a basis for your own experimentation. Personally I like to get pretty wasted when I take GHB ☺ just because it’s so nice, and that would be about 3g – 4g for me. If was in a lighter kind of social situation, or dancing, or just hanging out then I might take a little less (up to 2g max) in order to be more functional. As always I would be calibrating and adjusting the dose as I proceed.<br /><br />It’s really something that can be dosed much like how we drink alcohol. Have a little, see how you feel, and have some more later if you need some more…<br /><br />In terms of using it with other drugs the following guidelines apply:<br /><br />Never take with other depressants, as has already been stated repeatedly. However, if you choose to break the rules (I never do) then know that there will be profound synergy and potentiation, so dosages should be radically lowererd.<br /><br />GHB combines very well with all stimulants – coke, speed, meth, caffeine etc. You will be able to push the doses a bit higher and still function. Normally if you take too much GHB you will simply start passing out and falling asleep. Stimulants allow you to go closer to the edge and still maintain conscious – which can be very pleasurable. Once again take time to get to know GHB before you start pushing that edge.<br /><br />When combining with psychedelics, empathogens and entactogens (all of which cocktail beautifully) dosages are generally neutral (not higher or lower). In general GHB works better after the other drugs rather than before, for example it is excellent post MDMA, but seems to interfere (for me anyway) with the MDMA rush if taken before hand. In my experience I also tend to favour a slightly larger dose (1.5g - 2g) when taken after MDMA as it seems to re-invigorate the rush better this way.<br /><br />Some people enjoy GHB with Cannabis a lot, for it’s not my personal favourite, as I find the GHB euphoria to be lessened somewhat for me - and I also generally prefer my Ganja unblended with anything else.<br /><br />GHB can essentially be re-dosed for many hours (if that is your choice) without tolerance building. Dosage just needs to be a maintained at a level that does not go too high. For example 1g sipped over the course of an hour can be repeated all night for a continual mellow buzz.<br /><br />If GHB is used for inducing sleep then it is recommended to take less than what is required, as if too much is taken (3g+) it will induce deep sleep quite quickly but then there may be a tendency to awaken about 4 hours later when the GHB wears off. Better to take a lower dose (1g – 2g) to cause some relaxation which can assist you to fall asleep rather than force it. Then the tendency to awaken later will be lessened.<br /><br />As a clinical anti-depressant I suggest 0.5g – 1g in a single dose, two to three times per day. Ideally it should be just below (or just on) threshold.<br /><br />Altogether, if some time is taken getting to know GHB , and conservative experimentation is engaged, then you will come to understand its overall dynamics as a drug. And with understanding comes the ability to use it intelligently. When used in this way it is one of the most useful chemical tools on the planet –broad in scope and able to reach deep into states of openness, catharsis and ecstasy– while also being one of the most benign drugs in existence<br /><br />Enjoy! I have been taking carefully measured doses as I write this to ensure that I’m communicating accurately - currently on 3.5g and having a whale of a time! ☺<br /><br />I wish you all extreme pleasure with this wonderful substance, and Great Golden Copulations!<br /><br />BlueGiraffe<br />

				Blue Giraffe I feel bad because my trip report didn&#039;t seem to do the product much justice... I haven&#039;t tried it again yet but I gave it to a friend of mine that is familiar with GHB (only liquid he says) and he claims it was the strongest he&#039;s ever had. Embarrassingly enough I gave him some to allow him to go at his own pace and, well, he G-holed himself pretty fast. I felt obligated to draw a penis on his face. I don&#039;t feel bad about that though :)<br /><br />I also made a solution of 10ml/0.50G to help dose out faster and easier<br /><br />I know you&#039;ve probably answered this a few (dozen) times already but how much GHB is soluble in 1ml of water?

				the ghb is really lovely! my only complaint is that we didn&#039;t buy more... the experience was very mellow because we took caution with dosing. i look forward to trying a higher dose next time.

I haven&#039;t tried it again yet but I gave it to a friend of mine that is familiar with GHB (only liquid he says) and he claims it was the strongest he&#039;s ever had. Embarrassingly enough I gave him some to allow him to go at his own pace and, well, he G-holed himself pretty fast. I felt obligated to draw a penis on his face. I don&#039;t feel bad about that though :)<br /><br />I also made a solution of 10ml/0.50G to help dose out faster and easier<br /><br />I know you&#039;ve probably answered this a few (dozen) times already but how much GHB is soluble in 1ml of water? (so I can plug it easier, nobody likes dribbles down the leg)<br /><br />Thanks BG<br />TK<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey TK,<br /><br />Thought your trip report was great :)<br /><br />And glad your friend provided some corroboration... (Totally agree with the penis on the face - he had it coming!)<br /><br />Regarding supersaturating water with GHB, I think you might be able to get 1g into 1ml - but that&#039;s prob close to the limit. I&#039;ve not tried to be honest. Suggest experiment by continuing to add GHB gram by gram to a known volume of water and see how far you get.<br /><br />Still would like further feedback on how that delivery route works - very intriguing :)<br /><br />BG

				I&#039;m back all. Been a little bit but I&#039;m popping in to give another update on how BG&#039;s product has been treating me. <br /><br />I had another solid setup about a week back.

Over the course of a dinner with some friends I drank from a 2g solution that kept me feeling sociable, warm, and in a mild chill state throughout (I ate light but of course the effects of the GHB were heavily inhibited). Despite the food, I was pleased with the state I was able to keep myself at over the course of the event. <br /><br />The structure of my usage hasn&#039;t been as methodical as I like but it&#039;s been some lousy weeks and GHB is a drug I really seem to only be inclined towards if I have a certain &quot;mood&quot; to take.

				mschen is correct. GHB is active at much higher dosages (1g+) so snorting it typically isn&#039;t the easiest or wisest routes of administration. Oral ingestion is definitely the best method and friendliest method.

When I&#039;ve used GHB, I&#039;ve bought those little 8oz water bottles, filled one with 2g and chugged it within a 5-10 minute period. After an hour, I then filled a 16oz water bottle with 2g and sipped on it over a two hour period which brought me to a perfect level. Do note that everyone&#039;s mileage varies and each person is completely different in terms of sensitivity, so try to get a feel for how an initial dose effects you. If you&#039;re doing this purely for sleep, I would think 1-2g would be ideal. My method is meant for coming down off trips and rolls.

				I have question about dosing. You wrote in the art of dosage the following:<br /><br />&quot;1g every 25 – 35 minutes up to 3g – 4g total.<br />1.5g every 40 - 50 minutes up to 3g – 4g total.<br />2g every 55 – 65 minutes up to 3g – 4g in total&quot; <br /><br />Do you mean 3-4g as an overall total dose per session (evening/night), or a max per dose/re-dose. In other words, when I (re-)dose do not take more than 3-4g per dose, or do you mean, if a take a dose of 1.5g and the next dose of 1g, then the next re-dose should not be more than 0.5-1g, making a total of 3-3.5g for the night? <br /><br />Sorry, perhaps obvious for you, but I am a newby as far as GHB is concerned. <br />

				If the only reason is to let patients sleep well the night before, then why not use heavy (but safer) sedatives such as zopiclone, ambien, xanax or barbiturates?<br />I&#039;m prescribed 2mg xanax at nite and I still need to take methylphenidate to keep me up and concentrating, even though the effects of the xanax wear off by the morning..

				Of all the drugs you mentioned, it is only GHB that causes proper, natural sleep - all 5 stages (NREM 1-4 and REM) in sequence, proper REM when it&#039;s meant to happen etc etc. This is GHB&#039;s unique quality and is what gives it its core functionality in treating narcolepsy (there&#039;s more to it obviously but that&#039;s the simple explanation).<br /><br />And a reminder, only 3 days left for the BLISSEDOUTBLUEGIRAFFEPOD party.

				Advice required, my long-necked azure friend.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried the GHB three times now, never, sadly, to good effect.<br /><br />Naturally, I started off a little conservative. I think I tried about 1.5g, another 1g at T+1 hour, another .5 g a half hour after that. The second time was a bit more aggressive. The last time was 2.5g at T-0, followed by another 2.0g at T+1 and maybe 1g after that.<br /><br />The best effect so far has been a very short-lived hint of euphoria (but who knows, maybe placebo effect); otherwise drowsiness. What am I doing wrong? Am I still under-dosing, or do I need to consider GHB, like DMT, a difficult-to-master substance with precise requirements (here dose rather than temp)? Could this be cross-tolerance with something else? These three attempts were themselves spaced out across a few weeks.

Ketamine is disinhibiting, but after a certain point it doesn&#039;t matter how disinhibited you are...you&#039;re just gonna be laying there. Granted, with GHB you&#039;ll eventually just fall asleep but at the right dose (which is not hard to arrive at if you&#039;re sipping on it) you&#039;re almost as disinhibited as you would be on, say, MDMA yet very very capable of having an incredible sexytime. I am a fan of ketamine as well, but if you&#039;re going for disinhibition, I think GHB is the ticket.

				Also (just to make sure) - as long as I keep alcohol, painkillers and bensos at a safe distance and don&#039;t take very high doses, the risk of me dying should be pretty low? Low to medium dose of GHB - have people (that aren&#039;t sick) died from that?

				Also let me tell you that 5-meo-mipt (3-6mg) combined with GHB (1g about every 45 minutes) is pure bliss, I gave up using MDMA because of that nice combo, it is much more clearer enjoyable and doesn&#039;t feel dirty + there is no hangover whatsoever. I&#039;m always looking for that perfect high (high/hangover ratio) and this combination is closest I&#039;ve come. Strongly recommend.

For Moxy itself, and when combining with GHB I find it also works best (if you&#039;re looking for maximal empathogenic effect) to take it progressively, perhaps a 3mg capsule every hour or two. If you want a stronger psychedelic experience then take 2-3 caps at once.<br /><br />BG<br />

It&#039;s easier if you just dissolve it in water or a drink and take it like that. Plus, you can titrate your dose better that way by taking sips. Or you can take it like shot and drink the whole thing all at once I guess. Why would you want to just eat powder vs drinking it? <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of people putting it in capsules and taking it that way successfully as well.

				You claim that GHB can be taken daily multiple times as an antidepressant.<br /><br />You sell ghb powder way overpriced. And you do know nothing about how bad it is for you frontal lobe and basal ganglia.<br /><br />People who take ghb every day will become fucked up pretty quick.<br /><br />You claimed that the old virmo sold bad ghb and did not want to help out with a good synthesis because you don&#039;t know how to make it.<br />You also claimed that selling 99,99% gbl is bad. And you should warn your customers. You are a real businessman. Selling and telling crap about your products and sell it for a lot of money.<br /><br />I should warn your customers to not believe what you say. If you wonder why some customers do not reply or buy anymore it is because they are in a clinic and detoxing from ghb is really terrible.<br /><br />Go ahead and give me bad karma. Better to have bad karma and to be open and honest than to be a real businessman and ripping off your customers and selling crap information and not helping out other vendors and let them sell badly synthesized ghb because you are afraid of losing money because another vendor sells the same stuff for half or a quarter of the price you ask for your products...<br /><br />You claim your product is cleaner than the people producing Xyrem. These people produce all sorts of medication and it is what they do for a living everyday. They studied for it. You claim to know more than psychiatrists and people from the pharmacy who produce Xyrem and make the cleanest liquid there is only for people who have to detox from GHB which is really dangerous. People can become psychotic and die if they quit taking their everyday 2 hour GHB dose.<br /><br />Go fuck yourself.

				Nice display of vendor professionalism there, virmo. BlueGiraffe is easily one of the most knowledgeable, helpful, and all around genuine vendors here on the Road, and you come to his thread as a fellow vendor (a competing one at that, you too sell GHB...) to simply bash him, and on what basis? Your claims are largely unsubstantiated. Provide sources. Be succinct and thorough in your criticisms instead of telling him to &quot;go fuck [himself].&quot;&nbsp; You&#039;ve flat out given me and everyone else that reads that post a reason as to why we shouldn&#039;t purchase from you. No vendor should ever act in such a manner. Keep it objective and positive in both your discussions and criticisms.

				Reference: go ask any psychiatrist or look in crisis center with people having to take ghb every 2 hours in order to stay normal. Or ask people who are addicted to ghb and take it everyday. Or look at people who take ghb everyday for longer than a few weeks.<br /><br />My reference is based on reality. His reference is based on some alternative form of psychiatry that is not used as far as I know.<br />I am not saying that alternative forms of psychiatry are always bad at all. But how many people do you know that use ghb in below threshold as an antidepressant? Most people abuse it.<br /><br />I am against the current way of psychiatrists prescribing all sorts of hard drugs claiming that these are not drugs but medicine. I am also against how BG talks about how special and good his GHB is. He does not want to share information about producing the powder. He gets it from somebody else who knows how to make it. And producing some grams of ghb powder is definitely not worth so much as he is asking.<br /><br />He is a genuine and helpful businessman. Just like how genuine it is to buy a pc for 800 dollars too much while you can get a better one for less. People who sell pc&#039;s, or whatever are very helpful in selling overpriced stuff and acting like it&#039;s the best suited for them.<br /><br />You can say whatever and give bad karma. This only means you are ignorant about how businessman act. <br /><br />Do you not know Timothy Leary and what actually happened? I think of him as a cool guy, not a guru. At least he gave his product away for $1 instead of SR people claiming it&#039;s 140ug while it&#039;s actually an RC or 50ug or something like that.<br /><br />Have you not read the &quot;big fish&quot; topic? Big fish are allowed on SR. Big fish sell a lot and are &quot;helpful&quot; because they want to sell their stuff ofcourse. Small fish are not welcome on SR while they might sell the best there is. Go check gotmilk. He sells and scams, but he sells a lot. His valium is not actually 10mg and it&#039;s usually overdated. He sais he ships them in blisters and then don&#039;t. He probably gets his stuff from a pharm that gives him products that people give back to destroy because it&#039;s old or they don;t need them anymore.<br /><br />You have to ask a lot of money for your products, cut products with crap and say it&#039;s the best. We think that it&#039;s better to ask just a little more in order to get new stuff. Instead of ripping people off, asking 10-100 times what a product is worth. GB pays almost nothing for his powder and sells it for $100. Gotmilk might actually get his stuff for free. One pill of valium is not worth $1+. Shipping does not cost 0.07 BTC or whatever. If you actually pay to get genuine 5mg valiums you pay about $5 for about 50 pills.<br /><br />It&#039;s people like you who make us raise our prices. Because it looks better that way. We can tell you exactly what is in our pills and how to store it. Not helpful huh?<br /><br />We sell exactly what we describe and people like it. It&#039;s hard to get 100% true products unless you know some corrupt people who are real drug dealers and drug dealers on SR as far as we know claim to sell the best there is but when you actually test it it is far from what is described. <br /><br />The only reason to not get our GHB right now is because we are not 100% sure about if the synthesis is 100% right. You may only say that I&#039;m talking bullshit if you actually send his stuff to a professional lab instead of simply believing what he sais. It is better than Xyrem? It might be more potent but that does not mean it is more &quot;healthy&quot; for you. Abusing GHB is too easy, unless you have to pay the absurd prices GB asks. Getting GBL or GABA in bulk is really cheap. Getting lab equipment is a one time investment. Getting the right recipe requires some time and searching. 10 grams costs almost nothing to make. And shipment in stealth is not that hard if you only spend your time dealing drugs.<br /><br />Your -1 karma will make us sell Amnezia Haze for $14 or something while it costs us far less. Just because high prices make it look better. LSD for $10+ for &quot;140ug&quot; while it costs $0.50 is insane. Selling E for $10+ is also insane. One pill costs 10-25 cents. Ok dealing on SR is taking more risk if you don&#039;t know how to properly do so. Which costs more. <br /><br />You people are willing to pay 1000% or more of what a product is worth including shipment. Just because of a 50% refund if it does not arrive. Then people say: it did not arrive but we got a refund or reship. Yeah really amazing. We can do that as well if you prefer that and make the product look more genuine. And now we will because we are annoyed by the big fish thing. We can then claim to have shipped while we did not and give a refund or &quot;free&quot; reship. Or ask to FE for bulk and then not ship and still get 5/5 feedback and look genuine.<br /><br />We feel really sorry for people spending so much money on BG&#039;s oh so special and better than pharm grade powder. He does not know how to make it. He simply believes his buddy. His buddy is better than all pharms who produce nt only Xyrem but all sorts of drugs for a living. Xyrem is prescribed for free to addicts who need to detox. <br /><br />Go look at GHB addicts and talk to psychiatrists and then tell me I&#039;m wrong again. What is so special about the powder being more potent? It is also more expensive. Xyrem is not as disgusting as a lot of GHB that is sold on SR. And definitely not made in aluminium pans while claiming 5ml contains 1 gram while hiding the fact that it will kill you pretty soon if you abuse it. And trust me, those people are not on SR anymore because they are either dead, psychotic or stay away from SR drugs. <br /><br />We have not bought from GB yet but perhaps we will. Then we will send it to a lab and laugh if it contains poisonous by-products. But we laugh anyways because the prices are insane. Xyrem is expensive and not prescribed for a reason. GB claims it can be taken three times a day and actually thinks people will do so, for perhaps an antidepressant effect. Sorry, but you build up tolerance just as for valium. Valium can &quot;cure&quot; social anxiety, depression, whatever. Except if you take whatever amount everyday just below recreational dosage, you will definitely get addicted after 2 weeks and your body will ask for more and you will detox while still using it. Except unless you take 40-80mg&#039;s of REAL valium then you will simply die if you quit at once because of the rebound effect on your body. GHB is MUCH worse. Even being an alcoholic is less bad for your health and mind than GHB.<br /><br />Selling GHB just is easy to make a lot of money. Just like everything else on SR. Depending on what country you live in and the people you know. 1 vial of 5ml ghb can be $1 or 2, or 15. Or free. Just like very high quality lsd. Production costs are low.<br /><br />Real genuine and helpful people do not sell drugs and cut them and say they are the best or better than pharm grade. it&#039;s because it costs a lot of money. Otherwise we could buy overpriced stuff from vendors, take it to a lab and post the facts on this forum. A lot of vendors will sell a lot less then. Or not, because people on SR don&#039;t seem to care about their health. We will also not care so much anymore. If people are too lazy to test their products and ingest whatever poison besides drugs already mostly being poison then why should we bother?<br /><br />GB actually claiming that his powder is the best and better than pharm grade liquid without more than one real reference is silly. We could sell coke, heroin, ketamine, ghb, weed, lsd and every drug and claim it works as an antidepressant since every drug works on serotonine, dopamine etc. <br /><br />Did you study psychiatry, work in a lab? Produce meds/drugs? Or at least psychology?<br />If no, then you just do not know what you are talking about. We are honest about not having the right synthesis for GHB and therefore prefer not to sell it. We genuinly asked for help from GB and he was not willing to answer because we could become competition. We want people to get high grade non poisoned stuff with fake products. We help people with info. And you whine about references. Go upgrade your knowledge and then talk again or be ignorant and just shut up and waste your money on SR, taking risks you might not even comprehend, or do.<br /><br />We will turn into a vendor selling top notch crap for a lot of money if you prefer that. This is becoming more and more clear and this is the reason the old vendor team quit and went back on the streets. You get not only what you ask for, even better if they are nice people but then they warn you to be careful. Or you get not valiums in blisters that might be fake or the date has been cut off, they give you the boxes they are in with all the details you can get. There are also big and small fish. Big fish rip you off, but not with $98 but with 2 bucks or something.<br /><br />We are done with this crap. Try taking sub-threshold doses of GB&#039;s powder if you really have a extreme depression and are prone to addiction. Good luck detoxing because you will fail and will fuck up your brains however non poisonous GB&#039;s special powder might be for your body. It remains the same for your brain.<br /><br />I hate the pharmaceutical industry, they also rip people off but for less money. At least antidepressants take 6 months to build up tolerance while changing your personality possibly. GHB will fuck you up so bad within weeks of daily usage. Not only will your fine motorics get fucked up, you can not even sleep without taking ghb in higher and higher doses each 2 hours or perhaps even less. Antidepressants from pharmacies have unknown effects. But people can take them for years and still function with one dose a day. Might be a bit stressful for the liver but GHB is stressful for a lot more.<br /><br />Good luck trusting &quot;genuine&quot; ripping off vendors like GB. You are not even allowed to know how it;s made therefore you don&#039;t know what is in it. That&#039;s how helpful he is and the reason I do not order from him. Why would I spend way too much money on a powder form without knowing what is in it? That would just be silly. Then claiming it;s better than pharm grade liquid... Why should I believe that? He does not know how to make it himself so he trusts his buddy and nobody knows him...<br /><br />Vendors selling ghb with bad metals in them also get good feedback and are well trusted without deserving it.<br /><br />We only wished to warn you that you should not take ghb as an antidepressant. Just as valium or alcohol or whatever intoxicant/depressant. this got out of hand and for this we are sorry. But we still think GB can go fuck himself. Real life stores at least have to describe what is in their products. Still they rip people off. GB does not describe and rips off. Bad vendor in our eyes and in all the eyes of the really genuine and nice people we know. We think SR should be for good prices for top notch quality. Instead it consists more and more out of scammers asking a lot of money for products that are not as described, they use several accounts and buy some more vendor accounts to rip off more and then disappear and get a new account. Look at HollandOnline, he is DP, then he became stoeprand. HO looks genuine but their products are shit. stoeprand starts out with good quality then starts adding shit to it. DP simply completely ripped people off then reappeared.<br /><br />This is now about more than GB and now it does not belong here. But why give a shit? All we do is tell the truth. We don&#039;t want to look for references on the clearnet. Go life live and experience, test your drugs and start knowing the truth about SR. For Dutch people it&#039;s definitely not better. Perhaps that is different in other countries like the USA. We have coffeeshops here and dealers everywhere. We are not just drug dealers with money in their eyes. So risking some time in jail would fuck up our lifes instead of just spending some annoying years in prison in order to start dealing again once out, or bail us out because we became rich by ripping people off with products and/or prices.<br /><br />We live in the bad sides of the netherlands. Otherwise we could sell lsd on sr 100+ug for real for $1 or less. But you prefer to spend 10+dollars for some weak acid and not know good acid and then think a vendor is genuine. One good acid tab can contain A LOT of ugs and then it hits you in 15 minutes and all you see is fractals or fly through worlds. SR acid makes us feel a bit stoned slightly trippy and costs 100 dollars for 10 tabs of &quot;140ug&quot; aka 50ug which makes 500 which is the really high dose. Shipment would make it $7 for EU but perhaps could be less because lsd can be disguised pretty easy. Odorless, small it&#039;s shipped daily out here. So 7 dollars for shipment and 10 tabs for 10 dollars instead of one.<br /><br />We will become &quot;genuine&quot; instead of genuine as you want. Then we will get + karma instead of -.<br />SR contains real drug dealers, they rip you off. Genuine vendors are small fish and are told not to be welcome on SR.<br />So actually SR is to rip ignorant people off which to us seems the opposite of what it was meant for.<br /><br />Do you really want us to be like BG and then give us + karma? We will flip a coin then one with big fish one with small fish. Big fish means lots of coin for random quality products. Why not.. lots of people on SR seem not to care.<br /><br />Lots of words with no content. To summarize:<br />BG sells overpriced product. 100times the actual prize. He sells big quantities for this we respect him but we should warn you that daily GHB sub-threshold doses are also addictive our reference is about every psychiatrists who are also drug dealers and it all depends on the countries what is available where. Drugs are high quality in NL and really amazingly high priced on SR. Also claimed to be really good because they know people in other countries have no real experience or whatever, they have no conscience that tells them that its wrong to rip people off and poison them.<br />BG does not want to tell what was used to make the product. BG can be compared to any store selling stuff you can easily make yourself except people are too dumb and therefore pay too much. For example: pc&#039;s.<br />SR can be compared to this. Except pc&#039;s are pc&#039;s and they are advertised as being really good but then often deliver specs which are really low quality. PC&#039;s are not hard to build yourself. Just buy a screwdriver, follow directions and voila, safe lots of money. <br />Be that way, fine.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Dry GHB is actually a lot harder to make than liquid GHB, bluegiraffe&#039;s stuff isn&#039;t made a kitchen where he mixes lye and GBL, unlike the liquid stuff you get. BG&#039;s GHB is kind of expensive for 25g but it&#039;s only a little more than $2 a gram and 100g is pretty cheap, it&#039;d cost less than $5 for a good dose, which is pretty good. Xyrem is of a much higher quality than the liquid GHB you find on the streets, the liquid GHB you find on the streets was never dry in the first in the first place, it&#039;s not like they take the powder and dissolve it. In fact, BG&#039;s stuff is probably as good as Xyrem.<br /><br />And your prices are really not that low, your mirtazapine is super expensive for example. And your GHB, well there&#039;s maybe 15g in 25mL which makes it only 1.13 times cheaper, (if you add shipping price, his shipping is free) than his 25g listing, per gram, but the quality is most likely not the same, the liquid stuff that has garbage like GBL and GBL&#039;s impurities in it, because the wheel cleaner you get is not 99.99% pure. Of course if you want cheaper stuff you just buy it in liquid, but I personally don&#039;t mind paying a little more (1.13 times is really not much) for a cleaner powder GHB.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We could sell coke, heroin, ketamine, ghb, weed, lsd and every drug and claim it works as an antidepressant since every drug works on serotonine, dopamine etc. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I agree that GHB shouldn&#039;t be used for depression but some people are gonna do that anyways so that&#039;s why BG gave some advice. Low doses of GHB aren&#039;t neurotoxic though. Taking a gram a day won&#039;t cause bad addictions, and I think it&#039;s arguable that low doses of GHB have less drawbacks than drugs like effexor, and are much much more effective. People self medicate with alcohol, opiates, speed, etc. I think that GHB is at worst the lesser of two evils (I&#039;m not&nbsp; talking about daily recreational doses). And FYI, ketamine as an antidepressant is a really good option, a low dose every 7 to 10 days being required, read the studies! LSD can also work to cure depression if used in a therapy setting, it has been used in the past with good result and I think it&#039;s still used in some cases in Switzerland, MDMA and mescaline have also been used with success.<br /><br />GHB is a lot better for your health than alcohol too, they don&#039;t even compare in terms of ill effects, and a benzo addiction is worse than a GHB addiction. GHB is one of the safest drugs you can use if it&#039;s clean, it&#039;s not hard on your metabolism at all.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Even being an alcoholic is less bad for your health and mind than GHB.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, alcohol is definitely better for your liver and brain, sure, it doesn&#039;t cause things like... liver cirrhosis ::). <br /><br />Stop bashing on BG, he&#039;s one of the best and most professional vendors on SR, and his stuff isn&#039;t so expensive if bought in bulk. By the way, dutch drugs aren&#039;t so spectacular, just because weed is legal there and you have good weed doesn&#039;t mean you have the best drugs in the world... Dutch speed totally sucks for example.<br /><br />I agree with some of your posts though, I don&#039;t think that selling drugs at 100 times the price you bought it is really fair, and sure if you have a prescription for valium it won&#039;t be as expensive, about $25 for 50 pills of 10mg without insurance, but if you want to make money it&#039;s not really bad to sell it at $1 a pill, it&#039;s actually a pretty low price. It only costs you a few dollars to get high. And gotmilk isn&#039;t the most reliable vendor and his things are really not carefully packed but he delivers and I&#039;ve found he&#039;s actually an honest guy. His bad feedback probably comes from the fact that his stuff is badly packed... Sure some of his pills are maybe weak but the prices are okay in my opinion. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just because high prices make it look better. LSD for $10+ for &quot;140ug&quot; while it costs $0.50 is insane. Selling E for $10+ is also insane. One pill costs 10-25 cents.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What&#039;s really bad is people selling crap cocaine for $160 a gram or $35 for one single roxi, and well ,LSD is expensive and also often of a worse quality than advertised but there are good vendors. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> we could sell lsd on sr 100+ug for real for $1 or less.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you could sell real 100mcg tabs for even $4 a tab and they were real you&#039;d definitely have business going after people try it out, it doesn&#039;t make it look better to sell it for cheap, people willl just think it&#039;s too good to be true at first. They won&#039;t want to pay $15 for the same thing if you sell good stuff for $4 or whatever cheaper price.<br /><br />But you complain about the prices so much and you sell mirtazapine at like 7 times the price of a prescription without insurance! So if you complain so much about the prices maybe you should at least try to change the game like selling your mirtazapine at $1 a pill and your GHB at half the price. Then it&#039;d make sense criticizing other&#039;s prices (and I agree with your that some things are really overpriced). But right now, BG&#039;s stuff is not much more expensive than your stuff (see above), and he&#039;s really pleasant to deal with (I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re not but I have no experience with you) and well, your packages are basically insured with BG.<br /><br />If you can really change the game and sell things much cheaper then by all means, do it.<br />

				Its all supply and demand. the reason vendors charge 10 times the price for drugs here on SR is bec there are ppl who will pay that price. If a different vendor comes out with the same product for a much cheaper price, the other vendors will have to lower their prices to compete with them or wait until vendor runs out of product so that everyone comes running back to them. Its all supply and demand and most vendors do not have an unlimited supply of drugs

				We can not read everything you post anymore tree. Hope for your understanding and hope for people giving bad karma have the guts to say so.<br /><br />GB does not provide any info on how his powder is made so what the hell do you know about how it is made and not in a a kitchen and blablabla?<br />We said he claims it is better than Xyrem. Based on a government document he found. We can also claim that based on documents while still selling shit. And how do you know how many grams our ghb has? Cheers for you for letting us know it&#039;s less than 1.3grams for 25ml. I tried pure basf which equals 1gram of ghb and my tolerance is high. I pass out at 2-3grams so if I pass out from 15ml than surely the correct math would be that 25 contains 1.13 grams.<br /><br />I started to like you for being honest but this disappoints me.

				Ok we have read the rest...<br /><br />We once had access to 400ug tabs for 10 cents. We lost resources because our dream is actually not to be drugdealers. But otherwise we would add correct listings since selling 50ug tabs to people with no experience with it is just ripping them off. they think acid makes you feel stoned, or works after 1 hour. Strong acid works a lot faster, taste has nothing to do with it, even usually bad acid tasted bad but people thing how worse it tasted the purer it is.<br /><br />Our last deal was 1000 tabs of 140ug for 10 euros each.. that guy was a real fucked up drugdealer who abused his so called powerful pills.. yeah we can take 5 pills and feel a little euphoric.. sure...<br />We also got some mdma crystals for free.. one fingerdip was so artificially pleasant it was awesome mdma most definitely 83% pure. It felt so clean and old virmos customes loved it but they only bought one gram...But if we list that then it means nothing, people sell mdma qualities that do not even exist. And they win...<br /><br />We are honestly trying to do honest business. You are right about the mirtazapine but now your location is known, it&#039;s NL. otherwise you could not know this.<br />We are not sure if it&#039;s really $1 a tab. But we just get pissed off by big fish vs small fish so we try selling products overpriced to see how that works out. Old virmo team could not do that. Did not feel right. He got lots of bad karma for that and was told to get off SR because small fish are not welcome. So actually you need to ask at least 150% of what is costs you and then offer a 50% refund or free reship and you seem honest and genuine. So thats our new way. And our GHB is cheaper than any domestic GHB and we know some domestic GHB use aluminium pots so I think we do the best we can and we are open about it on the forums. Is that really a bad thing?<br /><br />I do agree I should not bash on GB anymore.<br />It&#039;s just not true that ghb withdrawal is worse than benzo or alcohol. Ofcourse alchohol can cause liver cirrhosis. Benzo&#039;s and as far as we know GHB also stresses the liver.<br />If you dont believe this. Get addicted to GHB. Use 2 grams every 2 hours and then try to withdraw. You will need a hospital. And benzo&#039;s.. it really depends on what kind and how much. As for ours you get what you want. Gotmilk contained less than 10mg. We could take 5 of of them for fun.. well, we can not take 10 of ours... Besides, ours are overdue in the future, not in the past. And we do not put hairs in our products and break them all up and tell you it&#039;s a lot more mg&#039;s than it is, while actually using overdue products are bad for your health. And come on.. who makes 140mg viagra... 100 is already 50 too much or 75. <br /><br />But lets make a bash on Virmo_new and other vendors thread. I just wanted to say that GB should go fuck himself for claiming he produces better GHB powder than Xyrem, that it&#039;s cleaner. Without ANY info on how it;s made. Do you know how it&#039;s made? We had almost dry GHB once using Glassware and... A KITCHEN!<br />Probably the methanol should be used. GB is lucky he lives in UK so he can get 100% pure ethanol. This country understand people will abuse it so add a little or methanol or water to kill or safe them. Or can he? Is it true there is 100% ethanol in the UK everywhere? Seems perfect for alcoholics. 100% alcohol, yay!<br />UK must be still left behind then.. Same for them and RC&#039;s...<br /><br />Once again: we know people who were severe alcoholics, benzo heads and ghb heads, and combo&#039;s. And trust me, GHB is the worst to come down off. You WILL need Xyrem and benzo&#039;s. Then quit with the benzo;s. We think 80mg of valium is too much.. twice too much actually.. and should not be prescribed for longer than 1-2 weeks. <br />So trust me, it all depends on quantities, qualities and prices. Prices because some people use up all their money on SR... Which causes the need for.. alcohol, available everywhere, hard drug of the planet... and benzo&#039;s and ghb.<br /><br />Somebody complained about references. Where do we see references? We only see claims. Who can prove Gb;s powder is better than Xyrem? Did anybody lab test it? Should we do it?<br />Who of the people who bought and abused his products and are dead or psychotic will respond here now...? None?<br />He is not simply giving info on that it can be used as an antidepressant. He claims it can be. Yes, everything can. But GHB is definitely not the best one, neither are benzo&#039;s or alcohol or opioids. Sometimes speed actually is because it lessens the need for other drugs.. But only if you have ADHD or ADD. But then youd be stupid to get it off SR. Or perhaps that changed, the prices and quality? If my brain still works then I remember seeing genuinly looking dexedrine for 3 pills for $26. Seems fair. From Canada.<br />Though I can not imagine that the kids in the USA who get ER ADDerall pay $20 a tab.. must be really rich parents then all over the USA.<br /><br /><br />

				If you pretend to be a bi girl on cyber hippy fests then you get liquid on your hands and make you lick it off. After that you will not feel a bit stoned. Actually smoking weed or drinking does not work anymore. All you see is magic everywhere.<br />We are from the wrong area so we do not have all those wonderful resources anymore. Though Belgiums outside SR are true about their products.<br /><br />We wish to share the bless of magic. For free if we could but old virmo got bashed because of it. At least he sold real BASF99,99% and not for insane prices as this jennifers girl.<br /><br />We agree we ship mostly goods that kill the magic. Though mirtazapine can give you magical dreams.. And effexor is bad, we know. Especially for girls. For guys it can has the advantage of lasting longer if you know what I mean. But coming off it CAN be bad. Others have no problems with it whatsoever. I will ponder upon GHB versus effexor. Effexor is an evil drug that can alter your personality and make you become hooked for life. But GHB is so easy to abuse and people who to hospitals and claiming something as being a psychiatrist while being a businessman is ass logical as apples to tablespoons.

				Last comment I will make on here then I;m out to leave GB alone...<br />He should not claim to be able to give info as a psychiatrist and clame his products are better than those manufactured by the pharms. We also know pharms ruin the world so we are into alternative treatments.<br /><br />Best treatment for everyone to cure depression: Drag yourself into sunlight. Order pharm grade fishoil capsules those contain no poisoned fish and high doses which you need. Eat a lot of healthy green food and exercise. If you&#039;re ultimately depressed go for a walk for even 5 minutes. Everything is better than nothing. Drugs are not the cure. They might have been since about 100 years since the pharm took over the world and now sr tries to take over pharms? But also then drugs are not the cure. I would love to hear more about the ketamine for depression thing. Problem one: where to get clean ketamine. Problem 2: how to not love it so much as to use it so much you use 10grams in 5 days?<br /><br />

I didn&#039;t say your GHB only had 1.13g of GHB in 25mL. I said your 25mL contained about 15g but that was a guess because you said 5ml was quite strong and quite strong should be 3g for most, so 3g in 5ml = 15g/25mL. It&#039;s a guess it may be more or less. What I meant is that BG&#039;s stuff is 1.13 times as expensive per gram, for example, if a gram from you costs $1, a gram of BG&#039;s GHB will cost $1.13 (the actual numbers are $2.2 for BG and approx $1.9 for you for both your smallest GHB listings). I didn&#039;t say it was only 1.13g of GHB, that&#039;d be really low, I said it was probably 15g, but I can&#039;t know for sure. I just think it&#039;s very likely 15g.<br /><br />And I&#039;m fairly sure his GHB is pretty pure because it&#039;s dry and it&#039;s really difficult to make dry GHB as you have to work in an environment without any water, even the moisture in the air is too much for GHB, that&#039;s why it&#039;s surely purer as it requires way more skill than making liquid GHB, which you can do without being a chemist, and there is an entry on rhodium on how to make dry GHB, I&#039;m pretty sure BG uses a similar technique. Vendor Modoki also sells a (apparently very good) guide on how to make dry GHB. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying your stuff is crap or that there&#039;s only 1 gram of GHB in a whole bottle but I&#039;m saying that your stuff is a little cheaper, yes, but not that cheap and it&#039;s also probably less pure, since it&#039;s in liquid form so there can be some GBL left in it, in powder you&#039;re sure there&#039;s no GBL since GBL is a liquid and you&#039;d see it.

				I said, im out of here. I leave him alone. If his prices are ok then fine. Just please do not underestimate quick tolerance and abuse for GHB even his powder. It is really worse depending on what types of benzo&#039;s alcohol etc. you are.<br />GHB addiction is handled with short term benzo;s and antipsychotics otherwise they die. Benzos are tapered off even though it is hell and alcohol can be dealt with easily with any benzo the problem is its everywhere.. and eventually it will lead to liver cirrhosis.<br />But bad GHB can kill a lot more than your liver. That is why we are so desperate to get some more decent stuff it&#039;s fucking the weekend so we cant order pro stuff and he might die and I am not allowed to take it after today but are expected to manufacture it and sell it... Pff <br /><br />I am not a tape on loop. Excuse me if GBs powder is really top notch though I should believe people asking me for references while they can give... NONE! Not even GB!<br />And he should take ghb addiction a bit more serious but perhaps not if his product is really the best powder there is and better than Xyrem.. Although who in his right mind would claim that while being a businessman knowing a scientist buddy..? Anyways apologies for the bashing, we&#039;re out. take our knowledge or dont GHB is more dangerous than benzo&#039;s seriously or not. Go ask your psychiatrist buddies or your buddies almost died from them and those in clinics ones. This pissed me off and I would like to enjoy myself now for the last day. Thank you and goodbye.

				Using a spoon isn&#039;t very accurate, I tried weighing several level spoonfuls and and was about 1.3 most of the time, if it not compressed, but it can vary between 1.2 and 1.7 because sometimes the GHB will be a little more compressed and also because it&#039;s hard to always put exactly as much powder in it every time. I think using the spoon is convenient enough and I don&#039;t usually bother with weighing it anymore, you should just know that two spoons can be more than 3 grams and it can be too much for some. I usually fill about 75% of it to make it close to one gram.<br /><br />A level 2mL spoon isn&#039;t as much as two grams though, that&#039;d be a heaping spoon.

				+1 tree, i just tried the sppon a cpl mins ago and had the same experience with that spoon! if you try for the powdry part and avoid the rocks the spoon should come out 1.6 or 1.7 but can be a lil less if the powder is more dense

				You can store it as powder in a small tuperware. I&#039;ve found that if you compress the powder and wrap it tightly in two bags, it stays dry for a very long time, some moisture gets near the opening of the bad but the GHB stays dry. You can also put it in the freezer to be sure no moisture gets in. I wouldn&#039;t store it as a liquid...

				Your FAQ answered my question. Thank you very much. I will be making a purchase shortly if the answer to my next question is positive.<br /><br />Is it at ALL like alcohol chemically? I hear it makes you seem drunk, but I&#039;m allergic to alcohol. Not deathly so, I just get INCREDIBLY sick and nauseous. I also use heroin--so I&#039;d give 48 hours before a dose--and valium, so maybe even longer than 48 hours after taking that.<br /><br />I know the feelings are alcohol-esque, hence being an intoxicant, but does it make you feel... like shit? Alcohol causes nausea, and I hear this only causes it, possibly, on the first time. <br /><br />I&#039;m just worried due to how bad my reaction to alcohol is, but I would love a drug that I can take frequently and is cheap.... this seems perfect.<br /><br />Thanks!

				quick question about ghb salt. i know that it absorbs water from the environment but how much water does it absorb? i put about 0.5g into a few capsules a while ago and forgot about it. the capsules were more or less left out exposed in the open. when i checked up on it, it looked like like the amount in the capsules shrunk and clumped together. a few of the capsules looked like they were completely filled with a fluid. these are gelcaps so i don&#039;t think the fluid is water or else the capsules would melt<br /><br />is it possible that the ghb i had in these capsules absorbed so much water that they literally turned into a liquid?

				I became curious in GHB as it is claimed to remove a post-MDMA downer effect.<br /><br />Hope that BG or some other connoisseurs here can help me to understand as to how GHB might produce it<br /><br />If MDMA depletes ones serotonin reserves and it takes a couple of days to replenish them, then how does GHB affect this process?<br /><br />My personal only experience with MDMA was pleasant, but next couple of days were such that I have never gone back ... If this is truly somehow affecting this I would be keen to try that fabled LSD + MDMA (+2CB) + GHB combo.

				Hello Everyone and Every One! :)<br /><br />Firstly, my apologies...<br /><br />I have not been on the forums at all for some months as I&#039;ve just not had the bandwidth to run the whole customer service and order process, and also maintain an active presence on the forums. And of course there is all the rest of Life apart from Silk Road that requires attention and responsibility.<br /><br />I have truly missed our conversations and I am very happy to be back! And a big thank you to all of you (you know who you are) who have maintained the integrity and professionalism of this little corner of the SR Forums. I am very grateful...<br /><br />I am happy to report that the reason I will now be able to be active on the forums again is because the lovely SilverFox (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=68424) has joined our team to manage the customer service and order processing cycle :)<br /><br />Some of you have probably already met here. She is experienced, competent and capable and truly a delight to work with (chosen out of thousands!) and I am certain you will have an excellent experience with her. She is one of us. (If you want to know a bit more about this lovely lady... http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156118.0)<br /><br />Furthermore, I am also pleased to report that the recent time away has allowed me to expend some energy on creative R&amp;D in the lab. The fruits of this labour are two-fold:<br /><br />1. We will, within days, be listing a 50/50 Na/K GHB (balanced mix of Sodium and Potassium GHB salts)! We are very pleased with our results. Potassium GHB is more hygroscopic, is a bitch to crystallize properly and has significantly lower yields than Sodium GHB, but we have perfected our process and have produced a beautiful dry white fluffy powder (of exquisite purity of course) that is a joy to handle and take. I will discuss more about the benefits and subtle distinctions of this product shortly in another post. (Na-GHB and K-GHB are not the same thing!)<br /><br />2. We are in an advanced stage of set up to be able to supply consistently large volumes of the finest, full-spectrum, balanced Mescaline complex the world has ever seen. Right from soil and water specification and quality control, through excellent and time-tested cultivars of both T. pachanoi and T. peruvianus, sacred cultivation methods, and highly conscious and attuned extraction protocols, we are putting this one together with utmost care. As above, I will be making a dedicated post and new thread about this product shortly. Suffice to say, this will be the absolute business!! (And did I mention how exquisitely Mescaline and GHB combine?? Well I will soon - they like each other very much ;))<br /><br />I will be starting to work through all the posts that require a response (though I see that many of them have been covered better than I could have!) and I wish to thank those of you that have been waiting, for your patience and indulgence...<br /><br />Love and Blessings to you all!<br /><br />Your BlueGiraffe<br />

				I was thinking of trying out GHB myself and this thread has giving me more enlightenment on it. Now if I may ask a couple questions what is the closet drug GHB mimics. <br /><br />I have tried 2c,25c-nbome,mushrooms,weed,LSD,MDMA,liquor,cocaine,xanax,and synthetic marijuana <br />which one of these would you say GHB mimics the most and also what type of effects and feeling does GHB give someone? Honestly I have to admit I&#039;m a lazy gal and didn&#039;t want to go through the books and articles. I&#039;d rather have a first hand response from you.<br /><br />I read somewhere on this thread GHB gives you a drunk ish type feeling,and the reason I&#039;m interested in is because I&#039;d like to use GHB as a social alternative for liquor, as I have been diabetic for almost a year now and I have finally stopped drinking because it is horrible for me since my diabetes. So is GHB a social drug?

				GHB is kind of like a horny, relaxing, sleepy, empathetic type of alcohol. I gives you the same dizziness and unfocused eyes than alcohol but overall it&#039;s a lot cleaner.

It&#039;s well documented in http://www.amazon.com/GHB-Natural-Enhancer-Ward-Dean/dp/0962741868/ <br /><br />GHB should be used responsibly for sure, and it can definitely be abused to bad effect, but no worse than other drugs. And at responsible use levels it is one of the safest and most benign substances you can put in the body. Only GHB and DMT are endogenous neurochemicals, and thus perfectly understood by the body.<br /><br />If you&#039;d never smoked weed and only read the bullshit government sponsored drug literature on the subject you&#039;d probably have a very different take on it than you currently have. I propose you try some (good quality) GHB, if only to dispel some of the myths you have heard...<br /><br />BG

For the record I have have taken 10 grams of Na-GHB neat, in a single dose on an empty stomach, for the specific purpose of knowing what an overdose is like. I passed out quick, woke up to vomit at some point, passed out again, slept for about another 2 hours, and woke up feeling fine after that. I&#039;m not recommending that anyone do this recreationally (wasn&#039;t that pleasant) or attempt to replicate the experiment, as 10g is a massive overdose. <br /><br />But I am recounting this to give an experiential report related to how dangerous GHB is - and as shown, not very much at all. There is even one report in the literature of someone taking 65g and surviving. As long as you do not mix it with other CNS depressants all will be well...<br /><br />BG<br />

BG&#039;s GHB is kind of expensive for 25g but it&#039;s only a little more than $2 a gram and 100g is pretty cheap, it&#039;d cost less than $5 for a good dose, which is pretty good. Xyrem is of a much higher quality than the liquid GHB you find on the streets, the liquid GHB you find on the streets was never dry in the first in the first place, it&#039;s not like they take the powder and dissolve it. In fact, BG&#039;s stuff is probably as good as Xyrem.<br /><br />And your prices are really not that low, your mirtazapine is super expensive for example. And your GHB, well there&#039;s maybe 15g in 25mL which makes it only 1.13 times cheaper, (if you add shipping price, his shipping is free) than his 25g listing, per gram, but the quality is most likely not the same, the liquid stuff that has garbage like GBL and GBL&#039;s impurities in it, because the wheel cleaner you get is not 99.99% pure. Of course if you want cheaper stuff you just buy it in liquid, but I personally don&#039;t mind paying a little more (1.13 times is really not much) for a cleaner powder GHB.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">We could sell coke, heroin, ketamine, ghb, weed, lsd and every drug and claim it works as an antidepressant since every drug works on serotonine, dopamine etc. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I agree that GHB shouldn&#039;t be used for depression but some people are gonna do that anyways so that&#039;s why BG gave some advice. Low doses of GHB aren&#039;t neurotoxic though. Taking a gram a day won&#039;t cause bad addictions, and I think it&#039;s arguable that low doses of GHB have less drawbacks than drugs like effexor, and are much much more effective. People self medicate with alcohol, opiates, speed, etc. I think that GHB is at worst the lesser of two evils (I&#039;m not&nbsp; talking about daily recreational doses). And FYI, ketamine as an antidepressant is a really good option, a low dose every 7 to 10 days being required, read the studies! LSD can also work to cure depression if used in a therapy setting, it has been used in the past with good result and I think it&#039;s still used in some cases in Switzerland, MDMA and mescaline have also been used with success.<br /><br />GHB is a lot better for your health than alcohol too, they don&#039;t even compare in terms of ill effects, and a benzo addiction is worse than a GHB addiction. GHB is one of the safest drugs you can use if it&#039;s clean, it&#039;s not hard on your metabolism at all.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Even being an alcoholic is less bad for your health and mind than GHB.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, alcohol is definitely better for your liver and brain, sure, it doesn&#039;t cause things like... liver cirrhosis ::). <br /><br />Stop bashing on BG, he&#039;s one of the best and most professional vendors on SR, and his stuff isn&#039;t so expensive if bought in bulk. By the way, dutch drugs aren&#039;t so spectacular, just because weed is legal there and you have good weed doesn&#039;t mean you have the best drugs in the world... Dutch speed totally sucks for example.<br /><br />I agree with some of your posts though, I don&#039;t think that selling drugs at 100 times the price you bought it is really fair, and sure if you have a prescription for valium it won&#039;t be as expensive, about $25 for 50 pills of 10mg without insurance, but if you want to make money it&#039;s not really bad to sell it at $1 a pill, it&#039;s actually a pretty low price. It only costs you a few dollars to get high. And gotmilk isn&#039;t the most reliable vendor and his things are really not carefully packed but he delivers and I&#039;ve found he&#039;s actually an honest guy. His bad feedback probably comes from the fact that his stuff is badly packed... Sure some of his pills are maybe weak but the prices are okay in my opinion. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Just because high prices make it look better.

They won&#039;t want to pay $15 for the same thing if you sell good stuff for $4 or whatever cheaper price.<br /><br />But you complain about the prices so much and you sell mirtazapine at like 7 times the price of a prescription without insurance! So if you complain so much about the prices maybe you should at least try to change the game like selling your mirtazapine at $1 a pill and your GHB at half the price. Then it&#039;d make sense criticizing other&#039;s prices (and I agree with your that some things are really overpriced). But right now, BG&#039;s stuff is not much more expensive than your stuff (see above), and he&#039;s really pleasant to deal with (I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re not but I have no experience with you) and well, your packages are basically insured with BG.<br /><br />If you can really change the game and sell things much cheaper then by all means, do it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 tree - thanks for stepping in and making such a solid post on this thread while I was away. It&#039;s nice to know that the space is being held ;)<br /><br />Interestingly GHB does actually have utility as a clinical anti-depressant if used carefully (brief info here: http://www.biopsychiatry.com/ghb/authentic.html). If taken daily at sub-threshold doses (I consider Rifat&#039;s a bit high), it supports a continual low-level catharsis, which allows actual release of the psychological patterning that is often at the root of depressive states. Most commonly prescribed &quot;anti-depressants&quot; tend to cause emotional &quot;numbing&quot; rather than emotional &quot;enhancement&quot; and cathartic release - so they &quot;manage&quot; the effects of depression, but never deal with it truly.<br /><br />This process needs to managed with care so that the GHB is not used simply as an escape from the depressive feelings (as many drugs, both clinical pharmaceuticals and recreational ones, are often used), but rather as a functional therapeutic. And if this is done daily then dosage must be low - at, or just below threshold. And duration should be no more than 1-3 months in these protocols. And of course ideally combined with non-drug based methods - such as therapy, yoga and intelligently modified diet.<br /><br />In that context, it really does serve...<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

Mixing in water is certainly one way to measure accurately without a scale. As a convenience we do also included a 2ml measuring spoon in the package.

Once you get a feel for GHB you could also easily do the same. All my friends who use GHB do it the same way - very simple once you&#039;ve dosed a few times and have a feel for it.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Thank you very much. I will be making a purchase shortly if the answer to my next question is positive.<br /><br />Is it at ALL like alcohol chemically? I hear it makes you seem drunk, but I&#039;m allergic to alcohol. Not deathly so, I just get INCREDIBLY sick and nauseous. I also use heroin--so I&#039;d give 48 hours before a dose--and valium, so maybe even longer than 48 hours after taking that.<br /><br />I know the feelings are alcohol-esque, hence being an intoxicant, but does it make you feel... like shit? Alcohol causes nausea, and I hear this only causes it, possibly, on the first time. <br /><br />I&#039;m just worried due to how bad my reaction to alcohol is, but I would love a drug that I can take frequently and is cheap.... this seems perfect.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Humble apologies&nbsp; - was off the forums for a while. Doing a major catch up on all questions now...<br /><br />A good question, and one that I can answer in some depth.<br /><br />Alcohol (ethane hydroxide / ethanol) is C2H6O. GHB is C4H8O3. So both simple molecules, and both essentially carbohydrates (without getting too formal on the semantics).<br /><br />How they feel is somewhat similar. How they metabolize is very different.<br /><br />GHB is more like a cross between alcohol and MDMA, than simple alcohol. Both are disinhibiting, but GHB more so. Both can make you so &quot;drunk&quot; you can&#039;t walk, but on GHB you would also know full well that you were intoxicated, and your cognitive faculties would be essentially intact. You&#039;re generally not going to consider driving while wasted on GHB, or sleeping with someone you really wouldn&#039;t otherwise want to - both things people often do while drunk on alcohol. <br /><br />GHB euphoria is definitely superior to alcohol, and it increases tactile sensitivity - whereas alcohol (except in very small amounts) tends to decrease it. GHB profoundly supports sexual function, whereas alcohol does not generally (no whiskey dick). Both support emotional openness but GHB does it more cleanly - whereas alcohol can get a little &quot;messy&quot; and emotion not truly communicated. Not wanting to beat up on alcohol, but GHB is nicer in probably every respect.<br /><br />In terms of metabolism there are vast distinctions to be made. Alcohol metabolizes primarily to acetaldehyde, an altogether unpleasant substance. It is essentially a nerve irritant which is why people often become &quot;edgy&quot; on too much alcohol, and is the cause of the HANGOVER we all know too well.<br /><br />GHB on other hand is metabolized cleanly to succinic acid (a key part of the body&#039;s citric acid cycle) and ultimately to water and carbon dioxide. It&#039;s a precursor of GABA and also stimulates the pituitary to release HGH. So whereas ethanol metabolism is an essentially unhealthy process (which is why you feel like shit the morning after heavy drinking), GHB is actually a health tonic of a kind. (I&#039;m embarrassed sometimes to punt it too hard, given that I sell it and all, but it really is positive in the body, not just neutral).<br /><br />So to answer your specific question; no, your alcohol allergy will not apply to GHB - they are quite distinct chemically. GHB can cause nausea if too much is taken (and you are right this is generally only the first time, if it happens at all).<br /><br />Yes, and please allow a minimum of 48 hours (on either side) between GHB and heroin/valium (or other CNS depressants).<br /><br />BlueGiraffe<br />

EU, USA, others?<br />Any idea how long it would take before reaching central EU?<br />Do you really believe it&#039;s important to wait 48h before and after taking products such as alchohol, mushrooms, ... ketamine?<br />Sorry if those questions have been answered before, I didn&#039;t read all of the comments on your forum pages...<br />Do you recommend &quot;eating&quot; your powder as such, or diluting it in H20? If in H2O, should that be bottled water of could it be tapwater?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />R5&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gracias - thanks for adding to the knowledge base :)<br /><br />Apologies only responding now - was off the forums for a bit.<br /><br />GHB and Ketamine both being CNS depressants (in their own way) will interact and potentiate. So you could easily end up going deeper down than you want to. Acid + K fine, acid + G fine, K + G not so fine. Personally I would not go there. But if you know your drugs and your body, for sure adventure cautiously. But I do not recommend at all.<br /><br />GHB combines very well with all psychedelics and empathogens. Generally works better towards the end than the beginning, but as always personal experimentation will reveal. Read this for further insight: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90975.0<br /><br />We mail from the UK (after first moving product there from where we are). Work on 2 weeks delivery time to be safe.<br /><br />Yes I suggest a minimum of 48 hours between GHB and all other CNS depressants. Other drugs go wild :)<br /><br />You could eat the powder but might not be that much fun. Better to dilute in water (or any fruit juice). Cleaner water always better - but any is still fine.<br /><br />BG<br />

				Is the mix powder actually worth it? I thought K-GHB was 13% weaker per weight. And you yourself said the &quot;distinction is subtle.&quot;<br /><br />Really interested in ordering this to use as a sleep-aid, use with MDMA, and to show friends that alcohol is shit. <br />

				I made a post here about the distinctions between the two: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176884.msg1327262#msg1327262<br /><br />K-GHB is 13% weaker by weight than Na-GHB so the 50/50 combo is 6.5% weaker by weight than our regular product. So if you normally take 2g of Na-GHB, you would need to take 2.13g of the 50/50 to have the same strength of effect - a very very minor difference.<br /><br />The distinction is subtle, but certainly noticeable, and for me there are definite circumstances where I prefer the 50/50 to the straight Na.<br /><br />As a sleep aid I consider the Na-GHB superior, as the K-GHB has a slightly more &quot;uplifting&quot; and stimulating effect than that Na-GHB.<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

				Hi BlueGiraffe<br /><br />You actually joined my post, but i kinda wish to ask quickly in here something as well.<br />As you know, i&#039;m still fighting against my PTSD.

I&#039;m interested about the use of MDMA treatment for PTSD and weather it really works, but I haven&#039;t managed to find a single person to ask who is up for using MDMA. So, would it be possible for you to report back to me and let me know how it goes? Will you take the MDMA with someone and then talk to them about how you feel?

				Hi gtgeorgz&nbsp; :) <br /><br />I actually have another post of mine in Newbie section where i have more deeply opened up - maybe too much, but im genuinely looking for help. There i have discussed different Ptsd treatment options. Im planning at the moment of doing one MDMA session on my own in order to get connected with myself without &quot;others in way&quot;. This is how i feel at the moment because of distrust element in my trauma and also individual nature of mine. <br />After this, if possible, i would like to do it with another person - first i deal relationship with myself and then others. Main point after all is to return the trust to myself and others.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I dont yet know how MDMA works so my plans are just raw.<br /><br />May i ask why you are interested about this? You mentioned that you had looked for people with ptsd to try mdma? <br /><br />I deeply hope this works since im indeed planning to make report of my progress - As a thanks for everyone who have helped me here and for those who also have ptsd. The reason im motivated to do this is because i have once before had ptsd(managed to heal without help, but took long) and second one like this could be too much for me. So im trying to control it best as i can and hope/think it wouldn&#039;t take full control of me. If it would, i would go down for good. That&#039;s why i&#039;m eager to find solution.<br /><br />But i would be happy to report you about this if you are interested&nbsp; :)

Thanks!<br /><br />Also, BG or any GHB experts. A few days ago I put about 0.5g of GHB in some caps, didn&#039;t get round to using them and I came back to look at them today and there is absolutely no GHB left in the caps and the caps are all crumbly.. Would the GHB really dissolve in this short amount of time?

Your approach and sensitive openness itself will be a greater force in your healing than anything else, and is, I believe, what will ultimately allow the use of these various chemical catalysts to serve you deeply.<br /><br />Did you do the MDMA yet? How was it? How are you? Please share...<br /><br />To answer your questions about GHB - yes it can serve here. Firstly, if you&#039;re working with MDMA then I recommend GHB as a transitioning agent (see thread here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90975.0) - used as the MDMA is dropping off to allow a smoother and more natural (and more integrateable) transition back to baseline.<br /><br />Furthermore you can definitely also use GHB as a daily agent to facilitate psychological processing. It will allow a gentle low-level catharsis while you are using it - and I suggest using it 2-3 times per day at LOW sub-threshold doses. For sure take some larger doses to experiment with where it can take you. But for regular daily usage the doses should be low. You can read this for some more info: http://www.biopsychiatry.com/ghb/authentic.html but I suggest slightly lower doses for ongoing therapeutic work than Rifat suggests.<br /><br />I understand your question about GHB and your dreams etc. My best answer is that GHB has a general &quot;oiling&quot;, &quot;lubricating&quot; and &quot;loosening&quot; effect on the psyche - it will allow movement, flow, processing and change - and it may be facilitate the working through of that which is &quot;stuck&quot; and showing itself to you in nightmares - and I think this will only take place in the waking state, though it may transition into your dream space. To use it like this for a time is wisdom, to use it habitually as an &#039;escape&#039; is not - I see you understand this already. And that is good...<br /><br />Ultimately I trust that the choices you are already making which are leading you into exploring the art of psychopharmacology for your own healing are the ones that you need. You sense intuitively that the path lies in this direction, so it is good that you are exploring it. No-one can know where this path will lead, but if you stay close to the intuitive compass of your heart you&#039;ll be shown the way.<br /><br />It is possible that you may be led into deeper shamanic waters - where things like Iboga, Ayahuasca and San Pedro (and even LSD) may be indicated for your journey. You will know when the time is there. For now I sense that using 2C-B in a post MDMA situation may also be useful for you.<br /><br />Blessings...<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

So im trying to control it best as i can and hope/think it wouldn&#039;t take full control of me. If it would, i would go down for good. That&#039;s why i&#039;m eager to find solution.<br /><br />But i would be happy to report you about this if you are interested&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry for the late reply, forgot to check back to this thread!<br />Okay cool man, I was just interested because I&#039;m thinking about doing a dissertation on the use of MDMA for PTSD for my studies. <br />If you make a report I would be very interested to see if you think it helps or not. Thanks!<br /><br />Also, BG or any GHB experts. A few days ago I put about 0.5g of GHB in some caps, didn&#039;t get round to using them and I came back to look at them today and there is absolutely no GHB left in the caps and the caps are all crumbly.. Would the GHB really dissolve in this short amount of time?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes that can happen. GHB is very hygroscopic and will suck water through the capsule shell.<br /><br />BG

				~<br />Thank you BG for your time,<br />I have some easy simple questions for you :)<br /><br />#1: You offer two varieties of GHB; one with a balance of Na and K for a healthier mix, but then what does the other one consist of?<br /><br />#2: Which of the two [ion-balance and &#039;standard&#039;(?)] product would you recommend for consuming as post MDMA session and as a non drug-combination session?<br /><br />#3: Would it be safe to consume with amphetamine or cocaine, if not; how long after GHB use must i wait to use either amphetamine or cocaine again?<br /><br />#4: Finaly [If not already answered previously], what makes the blend more expensive than the other?<br /><br />Thank you so much.

				Glad you enjoyed!<br /><br />GHB is hygroscopic so it&#039;s going to suck moisture out of the atmosphere no matter what.<br /><br />What you&#039;re describing is a little irritating but not serious. Basically the GHB fine residue powder on the edge of the bag where you pour now has a greater surface area exposed to air so is absorbing some moisture and creating small droplets on the plastic.<br /><br />The simplest is to just wipe that moisture away with a paper towel so at least the bag stays dry - then ensure that you shake the GHB all down to the bottom. Keeping the bag properly sealed when not in use will also solve the problem.<br /><br />Probably the best is to decant the GHB from the plastic bag into a sealed plastic or glass jar - and keep the lid on when not in use. And a silica gel dessicant which specifically absorbs water will be better than an oxygen eater, which is basically just absorbing oxygen - which is not your problem.<br /><br />BG

				This is an urgent notice to all our clients.<br /><br />There has been a massive breach of security due to the following conjunctions:<br /><br />1. I keep a document with all shipping addresses as verification for any re-ships. I know this is specifically against Silk Road’s terms, but I have always kept this totally protected (properly encrypted and completely hidden). I’ve been meaning to remove all personal information and just keep the stats, but had not gotten around to that yet.<br /><br />2. I very recently hired a new assistant to help me process orders. She is totally trustworthy and has access to all documentation. However she made a profound error of judgement a couple of days ago. She was meant to email me the shipping information for the day – PGP encrypted and from one Tormail account to another. There was an issue with her PGP and she failed to get it sorted and so, as it was late in the day and she didn&#039;t want to miss the shipment deadline, decided to send it another way that she believed was totally secure, but which was not (I do not want to give further detail on the forum as these may compromise things further). She also somehow mistakenly managed to send all the history rather than just the day&#039;s orders.<br /><br />3. Tormail was compromised shortly afterwards.<br /><br />The circumstances and the timing could not have been more horrifically aligned, and I consider the shipping information compromised.<br /><br />I take full personal responsibility for this. Whatever role my assistant played, I allowed it to happen. I am a professional and I have never been responsible for such a degree of fuck up in all my life, and I feel utterly gutted and destroyed from the betrayal of trust and care that I have just caused. I am deeply sorry to all of you.<br /><br />The data does link names and addresses to SR usernames but does not refer to any specific product. While I consider it low probability that there will be any direct follow-up, I do highly recommend that you clean house and do whatever else is required to protect yourself. I will also be sending this communication out by PM to all our clients.<br /><br />Our account itself was not compromised from the Javascript exploit and everything is functional and secure. And of course the learning from the most painful kind of lesson is already being applied. I have already shared the details of this with DPR and have offered to walk the plank - and may yet depending on how this plays out.<br /><br />Though I will never meet any of you in person, you are like a great family that I love and care for very much. And I have done the worst thing and compromised your safety. I am so sorry.<br /><br />BlueGiraffe (neck hung in shame)

				It was spread over 4 hours.. I have incredibly bad insomnia.<br />And the prescription GHB is 4.5g that you take at all at once, twice a night.<br /><br />I was also reading studies on GHB and one stated that a man involved in the study received no effect from even large amounts of GHB.

Or is there possibility that it would help making my mind clearer? I have removed many &quot;drugs&quot; out of my try list, but GHB is something im definitely going to get and see how it helps.

At high doses you could experience some serious sedation which would lead to you passing out and potentially drowning. And, well, that&#039;d be bad lol. <br />As for the coke question, I would suggest taking the GHB about 30 min - 1 hr after doing the coke, but you can take it a bit sooner if you like. I don&#039;t see any serious contraindications for this combo. If anything, you&#039;ll get extremely horny and have a very lusty sexy time hehe. ;)
