				If you do DMT, LSD or SHROOMS, will it have you making alot of noises and movements? What it is like individually?&nbsp; Is it safe to do by yourself? I&#039;m asking this because i&#039;m planning on trying some shrooms,&nbsp; dmt and LSD ( Not on the same day lol ) and wanted to stay in my room in listen to music but i live in a house with other people and i dont want to make weird noises and such and i&#039;ll be doing it by myself.... i have a high tolerance and even controlled the wild symptoms of Sativa without making a word but laughing a little....

				the last thing you want to do is feel caged in like that.&nbsp; even if you&#039;re not making noises, you&#039;ll spend the whole trip worrying about it ;)&nbsp; best bet is to take it where you can kind of feel as free as possible.

				I can generally keep quiet on LSD.<br /><br />The last time I took shrooms, I was lying on my bathroom floor thrashing about violently singing about becoming insane (Infected Mushroom ;D) while licking the cabinets and walls. I apparently slammed into the door numerous times as my dog came over and started barking; I then spent 15-20 minutes yelling to him that it was me and that I was totally okay before I remembered he didn&#039;t speak english.<br /><br />It was loads of fun! That being said, if I had roommates/lived in an apartment/was with parents, they&#039;d&#039;ve noticed. I presume I could control myself if I consciously tried to, but that&#039;d put a bummer on my trip.

				You can certainly have a good time on shrooms by yourself in your room, but phunky&#039;s right about feeling caged in being very bad. You may be able to keep quiet but only because you&#039;re curled into a ball in the corner thinking &quot;I need to keep quiet, I need to keep quiet, ...&quot;. I made the mistake of taking shrooms (cannabis too, not sure if that made it worse) when some people I don&#039;t care for were visiting other members of my household. It wasn&#039;t a good time, but nothing bad happened other than shit going on in my head.<br /><br />If you do decide to do it by yourself, try to set up your day ahead of time. For example tell everyone in your house that you have a project you&#039;ll be working on all day and to not bother your work in your room. Or your sick, or whatever else to keep your mind from worrying about it. <br /><br />

				Don&#039;t do such powerful combos in an environment where you don&#039;t feel safe or have to be quiet.

				As far as making noise, you should be fine as long as you&#039;re not taking large quantities.<br /><br />But like others said, you may not want to be &#039;caged-in&#039; while tripping.

				Have you tried any of those yet? <br /><br />Honestly if you don&#039;t have much experience with psychedelics I wouldn&#039;t recommend taking it in a setting like that. Doing it in a place where you don&#039;t want someone to find out, or you&#039;re trying to hide that you&#039;re high can really make things go bad. ESPECIALLY if they were to find out and made a big deal about it, that would definitely push me into a bad trip. <br /><br />Personally one of the best experiences I had on shrooms was me and a buddy of mine took 2 grams each and just chilled at the park for like 6 hours, although this park wasn&#039;t a very popular or large one, kind of secluded which helped. If you have somewhere you can go like this, outside without running into a bunch of strangers. This will allow you to talk and move around without fearing that someone is going to hear/find out that you&#039;re tripping. Also like everyone else mentioned already, you do not want to seclude yourself to just 1 room. You may not feel like you&#039;ll get a &quot;caged-in&quot; feeling but trust me, it will be there and you will want to move around/change scenery.<br /><br />Or if you really want to do it by yourself, do what I did a few times when I was living with the parents and rent out a cheap motel room for a night (40 bucks for a night totally worth the experience). This will make sure you are by yourself with no one else influencing your trip, that and you can easily leave and go on a walk if you wanted to.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents hope it helped.

I almost decided to just run off into the woods and live with the animals but thankfully my rational mind was intact enough to keep me from that ;p Normally I&#039;m afraid of the woods at night but on shrooms, they look so beautiful.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say the same with LSD, as when I&#039;ll wander around in the dark I&#039;ll usually start seeing some pretty creepy images (though I&#039;ll usually inform them that I&#039;m not afraid of them so don&#039;t bother haunting me).

				I tripped out on couches hard. Acting like I&#039;m asleep. With ppl around me. On lsd. I don&#039;t make sounds on it and the only reason to get out of bed is to go to pee. Have some snacks around.<br /><br />On dmt..., I don&#039;t make noises.<br /><br />On mush? That one is tricky. I talk dumb shit out loud to myself on it.

				Usually when I eat shrooms (more so when I eat higher doses) I don&#039;t say shit throughout my trip. I&#039;m just navigating in my own mind in my own trip.&nbsp; On smaller doses of shrooms I feel more social, giddy, etc.&nbsp; But as I increase the dose the less, and less social and more spiritual the experience gets. <br /><br />&nbsp;I like to eat shrooms with my friends but also at the same time tripping with other people around can get annoying and they can distract you.&nbsp; Also things can get very, very awkward but that&#039;s something you just have to look past. <br /><br />Things get awkward because everyone is in their own mind navigating their own trip.
