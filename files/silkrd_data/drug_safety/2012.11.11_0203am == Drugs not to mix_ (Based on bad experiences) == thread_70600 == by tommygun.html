				Just curious, after spending a lot of time reading forums I haven&#039;t seen many posts on what not to mix, seems like some people will mix just about anything (or space it out over time).&nbsp; Anything anyone would not recommend doing based on a bad experience (or knowing someone).&nbsp; Every Body is different but interesting to see if there&#039;s a consensus on &quot;never mix this with that&quot;

				For me, I have found that I can smoke week after taking hydrocodone but not after oxycodone, no clue why but oxycodone makes me sick as shit if I smoke after.&nbsp; <br /><br />Side note- can you mix different opiates orally like hydrocodone and oxycodone?

				From a safety standpoint,<br />The list of drugs that are dangerous to mix is innumerable. You should always do your research on whatever drugs you have, what not to mix with them, the risks associated with mixing two particular drugs, and always, ALWAYS, take it easy when mixing two drugs. <br /><br />From a &#039;feeling&#039; standpoint, that&#039;s much more subjective and up for debate.<br />Personally, I hate taking pretty much anything when I&#039;m hung over, except for obviously benzo&#039;s.<br />Hate weed and opiates, it makes me fall asleep and waste the high.<br />I guess I don&#039;t really see the point in hallucinogens and alcohol, but other than that, I can&#039;t think of much I wouldn&#039;t try mixing, assuming I like each drug individually.

				Mixing 2 (or more) drugs essentially creates an entirely new drug, whose effects may bear to relation to that of the other drugs taken individually.<br />Unless you have a lot of info about others experiences of that drug combo best advice is to not try combining drugs.

				Mixing respiratory depressing agents together can cause serious medical complications. Avoid mixing any of the following with each other:<br /><br />- Opioids<br />- Barbituates<br />- Benzos<br />- Alcohol<br />- GHB<br />- Dissociatives<br />- Gabapentin<br />- Any other respiratory depressant or GABA agonist or NMDA antagonist<br /><br />Avoid taking the following drugs while on barbs, benzos, GHB, and alcohol, because they can have nasty effects on your stomach or liver, or they can contribute to heart failure:<br /><br />- Aspirin<br />- Ibuprofen<br />- Naproxen<br />- Acetaminophen<br />- NSAIDs in general<br />- Blood thinners or other anticoagulant drugs<br />- Anti-emetic drugs such as dramamine, benadryl (diphenhydramine), and ondansetron... in case you need to purge to avoid toxicity.<br /><br />Stimulants are vasoconstrictive. Avoid taking the following while on any stimulant such as amphetamine, methylphenidate, MDMA, or cocaine:<br /><br />- Antihistamines<br />- Nicotine<br />- Caffeine<br />- Marijuana<br />- NSAIDs, although a low dose of aspirin (81mg) is fine and could help prevent a heart attack in general<br />- High doses of alcohol (more than a few drinks)<br />- Anything vasoconstrictive<br />- Anything (else) serotonergenic<br /><br />Avoid taking the following while on any serotonergenic drug, such as MDA, MDMA, Mephedrone, Methylone, or DXM:<br /><br />- 5-HTP<br />- St. John&#039;s Wort<br />- Tryptophan, to a lesser degree<br />- DXM, while on any other serotonergenic drug<br />- Any SSRI, such as Prozac, Zoloft, or Lexapro<br />- Any antipsychotic, such as Seroquel<br />- Antihistamines<br />- Any (other) stimulant<br />- Anything vasoconstrictive<br /><br />Generally, avoid mixing drugs, besides in combinations that have been well-studied and well-tested, such as psychedelics and marijuana, or LSD and MDMA. Read the Erowid experience vaults to find out what sort of combinations have worked well and which haven&#039;t - if you see any bad experiences, don&#039;t try it!

Never again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The combination of alcohol with benzos is interesting. In lower doses they can be very synergetic when you want the hypotic effect (down a valium with a glass of wine or two for a good nights sleep). <br /><br />At higher doses problems do start to arise though. One of them is anterograde amnesia, which anyone that ever combined them is probably rather familiar with, and what happened in your example. This can be fairly odd, but is as such not overly dangerous. <br /><br />At even higher doses it becomes dangerous due to respiratory depression however. It&#039;s not very common for people to simply die in their sleeping after having benzos and a few too many drinks, but it is a realistic risk. Upside is that it will probably be a rather painless death, passing out asleep one night simple not to wake up the next morning.<br /><br />Poolsclosed has listed quite an extensive list of possibly problematic interactions, many of which could be quite probematic. On the other hand, plenty of people will take some benadryl after a bug bite, and have some drinks and cigs after, and vitually all of them survive doing that without a single adverse effect. Obviously its mostly a matter of dose - if you were to dissolve a jar of benadryl in a quart of liquor and drink that, you&#039;d probably kill yourself, regardless if you have&nbsp; few cigarettes whilst downing that cocktail. <br />

I have smoked cigarettes while on stimulants before and I am alive - but it&#039;s not healthy, I&#039;ll tell you that.<br /><br />If it helps anyone, 5 grams of L-Arginine will act as a powerful vasodilator. I&#039;ve used it very successfully with stimulants to keep my limbs circulating well... althought it won&#039;t stop a heart attack or anything like that.

Keep in mind though that these are doses for OVERDOSE and so we often see the patient go unconscious (in which case airway must be maintained constantly).

Our doses are to prevent the person from dying from overexertion though (say they&#039;re straining their heart so hard it fails)... still though, the doses we give can 1. make the person&#039;s respirations drop or their airway can be occluded due to emesis or 2. the haldol will result in extrapyramidal reaction (sometimes severe) so that benadryl must be given IV in order to prevent airway issues and further brain damage.<br /><br />It also makes sense to some degree that you want to be a little less tweaked so you take a benzo before hand - if that&#039;s the case though, why not just have some adderall and caffein?? safer IMO

				HI people, my bad experience on mixing drugs was in a scary night a few years ago. Me and a group of friends take LSD, some Cocaine and a lot of alcohol. At a point of the night my brain began to fry at a level so high, my stomach began to spin and get so tight as i had never before felt. I sweated like a pig, hot and cold sweats. Really freaks me out. I started to feel really unwell and with a huge stoned fo lsd in my head. They had to take me home and not enjoyed anything that night. Horrible, never to forget. Of course we all react differently to drugs. This was my bad experience with mixing drugs. I have a lot of respect and know very well what i`m taking, not doing it we risk having a bad night and very serious consequences. In my case there were two days of extreme discomfort closed in the room waiting to find my brain again. <br />Peace from Smeegle!!!

				I disagree with what others are saying about benzo&#039;s cancelling stimulants out. I wouldn&#039;t say they are particularly synergistic, but I love the combination.<br /><br />I find that a small amount of xanax tends to take anxiety out of stimulants without messing with the effects. This is especially useful if you take stimulants to &#039;get shit done&#039;, taking a little bit of xanax eases any tension while allowing you maintain focus. As a college student I find the combination fantastically useful, especially with some of the more anxiety-causing &#039;weaker&#039; stimulants, for example an extra large cup of coffee.

				Hey, thanks for this thread. <br />Maybe my bad experience can have the simplest of explanations in which case I&#039;d like to hear you thoughts on this.<br /><br />Friday night party a few weeks ago, by midnight I had smoked 5 or 6 joints (5G of strong weed) drank at least 1 L of vodka and was feeling alright, &quot;naturally&quot; high and happy. <br />Around 3 am back at my home I prepared an opium tea with coffee filters and hot water leaving it rest for a while and filtering it back again.<br />The strange feeling didn&#039;t come right away, I had never had any tea like this before (first ever use of any opium related stuff) and I couldn&#039;t notice any difference in the high nor in my vision and general feeling. I remember being a little disappointed when I went to sleep thinking that this first dosage of opium tea was too low (2G of raw crushed opium buds as I read it recommended when it&#039;s the first ingestion).<br />I woke up at 11 am and did not feel well at all. It wasn&#039;t a usual hangover. I spent the whole day in a fetal position lying in bed and basically sleeping 15 minutes and waking up sweaty, nauseous, being either too cold or too hot in few minutes interval and sometimes my heart was racing ... <br />The day after the physical symptoms had gone but when I look back I remember the hours of &#039;kind-of-pain&#039; (they were not that strong when I read some of the posts here, definitely) and I&#039;m wondering where were my mistakes :<br />- too much booze (mixing drugs and having a bad experience appears to be pretty frequently associated in the case of alcohol in the mix) ?<br />- wrong intake method of opium ?<br />- wrong dosage ?<br /><br />What was the &quot;difference in high&quot; supposed to be do you guys think ?<br />Can I be somewhat &quot;intolerant&quot; to it ?<br />Thanks<br />

				The main reason you wouldn&#039;t want to mix benzos and stimulants is the fact that benzos are respiratory depressing agents. A little lorazepam calms your brain down when you&#039;ve taken too much meth or whatever, but more than the therapeutic dose is going to put the hurt on the efficacy of your circulatory system. Benzos also fuck with your heart rate as well, although I&#039;m not sure what exactly about them, especially when paired with stimulants, causing heart attacks - but too much of either or too much of both will kill ya dead. Better to save that benzo for when the effects of your last dose have ended.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70600.msg620631#msg620631">Quote from: onionMat on November 24, 2012, 09:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Friday night party a few weeks ago, by midnight I had smoked 5 or 6 joints (5G of strong weed) drank at least 1 L of vodka and was feeling alright, &quot;naturally&quot; high and happy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This alone would give most people a horrible hangover. However, you did mix opiates and alcohol to some degree, which was a poor idea and probably contributed to your hangover. Perhaps you were very dehydrated?

				I once combined magic mushrooms with adderall, alcohol, and hashish. <br /><br />I do not recommend this combination. I experienced extreme paranoia and deliriant type hallucinations. I could not tell if my eyes were open or closed. The alcohol made me stupidly ingest a ridiculously large quantity of mushrooms.<br /><br />However, when the peak of the trip was over and I was no longer convinced I was dead, I experienced the most beautiful visions I&#039;ve ever had on any psychedelic.
