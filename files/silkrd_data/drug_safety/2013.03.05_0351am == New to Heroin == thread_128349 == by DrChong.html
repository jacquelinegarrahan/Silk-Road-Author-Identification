				Hey guys, so I finally got around to ordering 200mg of FF&#039;s #4 heroin, and let me say first off that he has pretty good product. I can tell even as a noob that it&#039;s good.<br /><br />However, my question is about any tips or suggestions you may have. I already snorted it a few days ago, and have been doing it once a day for the past 3 days. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m worried about addiction, it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve been pretty bored and since it&#039;s been in the house, I feel no reason NOT to take it, but I also think that once it runs out, I won&#039;t have a desire to order more. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been dosing about 20-30mg up the nose each time, but I haven&#039;t been getting a whole lot of euphoria, just great sedation and painkilling and relaxation. Truth is, I&#039;ve gotten better experiences from oxycodone/hydrocodone than I have from H. I&#039;m pretty worried about overdosing, actually. It&#039;s pretty paranoid-inducing.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t warn me about addiction, I understand the risks. I don&#039;t have an addictive personality, and I believe myself to be responsible enough to avoid it.

				So I always toss this out there and people normally recoil but... you can give plugging a try and see if that hits the spot for you. It&#039;s hit or miss with H, some people say it hits as good as IV and others claim it does nothing for them. I think most of the issues are just folks not doing it right.&nbsp; Google Plugging Heroin and you can read a bit about it. In a nutshell though you just get an oral syringe (the kind with out needles that they give babies medicine in, free if you go to a Wal-Greens pharmacy counter and ask for one), drop the powder in, suck up a little bit of water (3ml or so), hop on your bed, lay on your side, lube the appropriate parts up and insert syringe push plunger.<br /><br />If it hits you&#039;ll feel it within a few minutes and for a lot of people it gives them that rush they are missing and normally only chased down via IV. If you are a &quot;regular&quot; sort of fellow, having empty bowels is clearly the way to go here or you&#039;ll just want to poop really bad and waste all the drugs. First time just hang out on your side for a few minutes, leave the syringe in, it won&#039;t make you more or less gay unless your buddy walks in while you are doing it. After a few minutes it&#039;s normally safe to remove it without risk of leaking. I plug all the time and just pop it in and take it right out but best to get to know yourself a bit first.<br /><br />Anyway, other folks will have other ideas, there&#039;s mine! <br /><br />

				From a 15 year opiate addict- I don&#039;t want to minimize it, because the risk does exist, but the probability of overdose using the insufflation method and NOT mixing with other drugs is relatively low. The overwhelming majority of opiate deaths occur during either the first time IV use of a high quality product the user isn&#039;t accustomed to from a tolerance aspect, or from opiate use in combo with other drugs such as alcohol and especially benzos like valium and xanax. Rather than sniff a whole bunch of small lines many times a day, try this- sleep it all off well. Give yourself at least 24 hours since your last dose. Then, do a big fat daddy rail! You will really take off and that buzz will have some legs on it too. As long as you don&#039;t mix it and don&#039;t use IV you are almost assuredly OK. But it&#039;s good to always use with a buddy just in case. Enjoy the titty cloud!

When you start getting mild withdrawals (you migh already feel very mild chills because it&#039;s been 3 days already) temptation to get warm again will get stronger and stronger and chills will get worse and worse when you&#039;re not on heroin. Then it gets deeper and deeper even though I&#039;ve done H for ~2 years intravenously the longest time I went on it was 2 weeks so can&#039;t tell you what happens after that but here are a lot of ex long term H users they will give better advise. But everyone knows and should know the rule if you don&#039;t want to get addicted don&#039;t do H for more than 3 days ( I would say for more than 2) also until you have supply you will have &quot;kinda passive impulses&quot;&nbsp; not looking dangerous at first&nbsp; to do it.. I would advise selling remaining dope or atleast giving to some friend to hold on to it for a week (never worked for me wen&#039;t back to a friend and harassed him until he would give back my gear lol).<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Sorry didn&#039;t read the whole post at first and haven&#039;t seen not warn against addiction but I&#039;ve been there so I know how it starts. Don&#039;t be paranoid you won&#039;t overdose. before overdosing you will start nodding hard, and even if you do more then you will pass out. it&#039;s pretty safe with snorting if the purity is consistent. So go for the nods. Also that &quot;great sedation and painkilling and relaxation&quot;. I get the same thing too. Soon you&#039;ll start feeling like you should feel that way everywhere. it&#039;s great feeling to have isn&#039;t it ? everyone should have been born with it in the first place :p . it just feels so &quot;natural&quot;. you just feel &quot;whole&quot;..

				You should probably read this:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23080.0<br /><br />His initial thoughts/actions sounded very similar to yours.<br /><br />I know you said don&#039;t warn me about addiction, but it&#039;s the way you said &quot;I don&#039;t have an addictive personality&quot; that concerned me. As that guy demonstrates, addiction isn&#039;t just a mental battle, fighting the urge to do something you simply enjoy one more time. It&#039;s a physical vice. Your body makes you feel like utter death until it gets what it&#039;s become accustomed to - having Heroin in it&#039;s system.
