				Hello fellow SR members!<br /><br />I just recently placed my first order on SR for Xanax.&nbsp; I have never tried Xanax before, but from reading the effects I think it&#039;s pretty close to exactly what I&#039;m looking for in lighter doses.&nbsp; The only problem is that I understand Xanax has quite the high potential for addiction/dependency, and is known to quickly build up a tolerance in frequent users.&nbsp; I know about this first hand w/ Benzos from having a prescription to Ambien a few years back.&nbsp; The first time taking one was incredible.&nbsp; The quick onset, the light body high and gigglyness of it that I experienced until I could no longer fight sleep was incredible.&nbsp; The very next night I had to 1.5x my dosage to achieve the same effect, and gave myself an ever increasing dosage until I ran out each month.<br /><br />My ideal drug is one that has pretty light and relaxing effects.&nbsp; My ideal drug is one that I can use to unwind from a long hard day of work, in front of the TV or computer, with light, but relaxing effects, and be slowly but surely lead into a beautiful restful sleep.&nbsp; Xanax, like I said earlier, sounds just about right for me, however I&#039;m afraid I will quickly build up a tolerance for it so I would like to know of other light easy relaxing drugs, and in particular maybe not another Benzo.&nbsp; I have tried plenty of drugs throughout my life, but find myself to have a pretty weak mind or whatever you want to call it w/ drugs like MDMA, mushrooms, and even pot.&nbsp; I can freak out easily I guess is a good way to put it, and that&#039;s why I prefer light easy drugs.&nbsp; Please make some suggestions for me guys/gals!

				i would recommend ketamine for what you&#039;re looking for. it definitely won&#039;t make you freak out and although it can be psychologically addictive (as anything can), it won&#039;t cause physical dependence like benzos will.

				Thank you, moonflower, for the suggestion.&nbsp; A minor problem though, a quick search for ketamine on SR didn&#039;t really bring up much at all in the US.&nbsp; Is there some other name is commonly goes by, or pharm that contains it or something?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep the recommendations coming folks!

				Just sayin&#039;<br /><br />There are probably a good dozen recreational benzodiazepines out there. i recommend something exotic like nitrazepam, temazepam, triazolam, midazolam, etc.
