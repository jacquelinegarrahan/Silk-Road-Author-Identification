				(Turned out to be quite long I&#039;m afraid! Sorry in advance)<br /><br />Hey guys, a lurker here!<br />First of all I have little psychedelic experience having only a few threshold doses of acid. I also apologize for my poor story telling, I find it very hard to explain what I was feeling and seeing.&nbsp; <br /><br />To set the scene I bought around 15 tabs 1mg from DudeRugs about a month ago but never got around to having any myself and instead a few of my friends dosed. My friends had a great time, but from their experiences, they didn&#039;t seem as intense as mine... even while having 2-3 tabs at once.<br /><br />Now recently (I like in the UK) I purchased just a few 550ug tabs from &#039;pureogkush&#039; to save me getting some from America and so I could test it asap. <br />I had just one yesterday and after reading up on doses and wasn&#039;t really expecting much at all from what most have said on here and from research online.<br /><br />How I was wrong..? <br />Dosed at 3:00pm<br /><br />00:30 mins +<br />Around 30 mins after taking the tab I felt the effects coming on while sitting in my friends car. A slight body rush and a nice tingly feeling were the initial feelings. I took out my phone to double check the time and already the apps on my iPhone were waving. I found it quite hard to text at this point. There I was thinking &quot;Damn, this is hitting in quickly&quot;. <br /><br />We were heading up to an airfield to thrash my friends car around for his final goodbye before it gets scrapped so I was in for a hell of a time..<br /><br />00:45 mins +<br />After about 45 minutes I had intense body rushes and felt amazing for a good twenty minutes while we were driving. I couldn&#039;t describe it but it was draining the energy out of me. I then looked around the car and everything was distorting especially the stereo. The LCD screen that displays the song names was morphing with the text enlarging then decreasing in size over and over. <br /><br />1:00hr +<br />By the time we had got to the airfield I was tripping pretty hard and this was only an hour in. Colour&#039;s were extremely bright and were slightly saturated and the tarmac (was wet) had very light shades of green, purple and blue (like when there is oil on a wet road). <br /><br />My friend got straight on it and took me for a spin around the airfield and started handbrake turning. This was incredibly fun but very intense for me with the tarmac pulsing very lightly with the colours I mentioned above. I was still able to function pretty well at this point however I was having quite a bit of trouble forming proper sentences and only just making sense to my friends.<br />After a quick spin around we switched over and I jumped in the drivers seat as we were in a safe environment and I was still thinking logically. As soon as I got out of the car I felt very heavy and as I stood up everything felt slightly lop-sided and tilted to the right. This quickly adjusted and I got into the drivers seat. I&#039;ve driven my friends car before but this time the steering wheel seemed much larger than normal and it was very alienating. Nevertheless, I thought I&#039;d give it a go. I had no trouble driving naturally around (slowly of course, I was tripping quite hard by this point with my depth perception pretty fucked). <br /><br />This is when I started getting auditory hallucinations. The window was open and as we went around the airfield and as we went through small puddles I had an incredible delay. I would here the initial splash, and then about 3 or 4 more slowly fading afterwards. It was very atmospheric and I could barely here the car and only these sounds. <br /><br />I can&#039;t remember much else of driving, but I only drove about 10 more minutes around then let my friends have a go. <br /><br />After I had driven I took in the scenery around me. It was very beautiful to me even though it was a murky day. I then sat down and looked at the clouds. The clouds morphed into words, but I couldn&#039;t quite make them out so I continued to look around. I could barely string words together at this point and found it very hard to communicate. <br />I kept wondering to myself &quot;Fuck, I&#039;ve only taken what I thought was a small dose.. how intense is this going to get?&quot; I managed to keep the bad thoughts at bay though and rode through the experience. The grass surrounding the airfield and the tree&#039;s then seemed to have eyes and almost seemed to be alive as they waved together in the wind. <br /><br />3:00hrs +<br />After about two hours at the airfield and after relaxing and letting my trip morph many objects around me I felt like I was coming down slightly. The visuals got slightly less intense and I thought I was coming down.. Within ten minutes of thinking this I came right back up and started tripping even harder. My friends faces were changing colour, their bodies had a saturated outline, I had intense trails and I found it completely impossible to even get my phone out of my pocket. For a moment it felt like my hand was stuck and when I finally got it out I was incapable of typing my passcode correctly due to the numbers moving all over the screen. <br /><br />This coming up and down continued for a good 3 more hours with similar visuals and quite a few peaks. I won&#039;t go into details though as there is quite a bit and I&#039;ve probably written too much already. I couldn&#039;t even get to sleep until 2am that night, that&#039;s 11 hours since I dosed. This morning I had a slight headache, which I find understandable as my brain had an incredible amount to process yesterday.<br /><br />Now has anyone had an experience as intense as this from such a small dose? Loads of people don&#039;t seem to get much off just even 1mg. Is it me being very prone to this substance or could the dose have been larger than stated?<br /><br /><br /><br />

I&#039;ve tried DudeRug&#039;s 1mg tabs twice and both times it was pretty much similar to your trip. Try listening to some music on your computer or somewhere with a visualizer, you will be blown away by how good it sounds.

				Only the tough make it through smokeweed420, bad trips are bad. If you can&#039;t learn to deal with them, then psyhedelics aren&#039;t your thing.<br />They&#039;re not always feel-good, though when it is bad, they&#039;re just showing you that something&#039;s wrong.<br /><br />Perhaps deep in your mind you thought it was a bad idea.

				Next time i&#039;m taking n bom on its own .... i had 1000ug blot and vaguely felt and experienced psychedelic effects like the ones i experience on lsd .... but then again, some hrs before i had swallowed 150mg crystal mdma, some dexxies and a lot of synth weed. I need to be straight and try 500 ug first, bcoz i feel it&#039;s a very subtle rc, and it prob doesn&#039;t take much to inactivate it ...

				I just tried some of the snortable from tyl3rdurden and it was great. I snorted a 600 ug sample and it was a great dose. I had some great visuals with eyes closed and open. I liked it much better then acid. The walls were very wavy with really strong euphoria. The intense trip lasted about 6 hours and music was fucking awesome. After the intense part started weakening the come down lasted for 3 hours. the eyes closed visuals were fantastic with lots of bright colors and streaks. It was so clean and felt so good and worked best when I just let go and let it take me. I was really impressed with it. His prices are great and it shipped to the states in three days. I am gonna buy some more. It took 20 minutes to kick in and the come up was strong and not panicky And the powder had no taste and no burn at all. I could not tell I had snorted anything.<br /><br />Another user, trollsquad is suppose to give his review of it tomorrow over in the product offers thread. This was my first time with 25i. But like with most psychedelics you cant get much off one if you have used one just the day before. I had tripped on acid three weeks ago. He did a great job combining&nbsp; it with the powder to get the perfect dose in my opinion. I was wanting to try it but the reviews on the blotter were not consistent&nbsp; with some people saying they felt nothing off 4 or 5 tabs even after they used a toothbrush on their gums and held it there for 30 minutes. Snoring it seems a lot less risk of it being fouled up by causing it to be inactive. It seems that a consistent way to lay it on blotter has not been accomplished according to many reviews I read. Plus it takes 1-2 hours for the come up to begin with the blotter.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you got time check it out: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b8da404fa1<br /><br />There&#039;s still a free sample listing there. If you buy 25 then they are around 2 bucks a piece and less if you buy 100

				So for someone who enjoys haluconogens a lot, do you recommend me trying the 25i? I&#039;ve tried 2C-B a cpl times in my younger years, and a few years ago I tried Lsd for the first time and have been dosing at shows and music festivals ever since. I&#039;m not going to say im a very experienced user but i can handle a good strong trip none the less. I&#039;ve been very curious about this being the lsd prices are so high and was looking for a cheaper alternative. Just looking for some recomendation on who to get from. <br />Thanks!

				Wow I have to try this, sounds pretty cool to me ;D<br /><br />Going to buy some, who&#039;d&nbsp; you suggest getting it from? <br />DudeRugs&#039;s sounds pretty nicely priced, although I read some feedback of packages not arriving.<br />Tyl3r&#039;s stuff seems pretty interesting too, but the dosage is lower and he&#039;s more expensive..<br />Dannyboone also looks nice, and he&#039;s the cheapest..<br />Limi.. nice guy but a powder with dosages this low isn&#039;t very convenient for me :P

				I bought a ten strip from kwiktrip and I was very pleased.<br />I&#039;d go with Dannyboone for the price. Tyl3r&#039;s stuff has a lower dosage because it&#039;s intranasal.<br />If you buy from Limetless you can dissolve the powder in ethanol and use volumetric measurement. Buy you have to snort it since it&#039;s not HPBCD complexed.

I had a nice time on 1 of his tabs not too long ago. <br /><br />If you ever get around to 25c, echo has stellar 1mg tabs. I listened to tyl3r&#039;s rant about how 300ug snorted is more potent than a 1.5g tab so I figured half of echo&#039;s tab would be a comfortably light trip (500ug) ... I tripped harder than I ever wanted or plan to, it was like I had overdosed on MDA and then topped it off with some MDMA (good but way too much good in one place and one night if you know what I mean).

				for me 25-i is a very weird drug, one point i have intense anxiety and a terrible taste in my mouth, then it feels like im about to explode in happiness and love, the CEV&#039;S are also amazing, evidently when one of my friends hugged me whilst on it i felt extremely warm when at the time i felt freezing

				I&#039;m waiting for my check to get here so I can deposit some BTC and make my first SR purchase!! I was going to try some of your 25i Foxy, but if you think the 25c is better than i&#039;ll probably go that route. And 25d?? Really? It seems like the more and more im on here i learn new RC&#039;s that I am dying to try. Is it possible to get a sample of the 25d still? Just wondering, I would post a review which is just common courtesy I think.
