				So I&#039;m planning on getting a gram from SR here soon and need some advice on how i should go about my first time. I have a milligram scale so measurement isn&#039;t a problem. I&#039;ve heard snorting it is the preferred method and somewhere up to 100mg has desirable effects. I&#039;m curious about what it would be like if i just capped it and ate though, would i need to take a lot more to get the same effects? i know this is generally the case.&nbsp; anyways any insight would be welcomed, thanks in advanced&nbsp; ;D

				I have never tried it but would like to do so. However I can advise that it will only have the desired effect if you inject it (IM) or snort it (recommended) based off what I have read. Probably the most important thing to consider when dosing is whether or not you have a pure stereoisomer. I have seen pure isomer of one sort for sale on here. Again, ketamine isn&#039;t my area of expertise but isomers can dramatically vary in potency so you might have to adjust your dose accordingly.

				Don&#039;t cap it! It will be a waste, it can make you nauseous, it can cause loss of muscle control in e.g. legs, and will not result in any pleasurable psychedelic effects. I know this cuz years ago I was sold some pills as E that turned out to be K.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t like needles for RCs.<br /><br />So you can snort it, or if you want to be more exotic, you can plug it i.e. stick it up your ass! As a first-timer, your nose is the better bet.<br /><br />Dosage well covered here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=135877.msg926095#msg926095<br /><br />I like to take it at home, after some stimulants, with deep sounds to propel the journey.<br /><br />It does not combine well with other downers, even alcohol.<br /><br />

				And another thing, for your nose, you want it be as fine a powder as possible.<br /><br />Often, it arrives as crystals, and these can hurt, and won&#039;t be absorbed as efficiently.<br /><br />Your best bet is to use a little pestle &amp; mortar thingy, to grind it into &quot;chalk dust&quot;<br /><br />Use a smooth marble or ceramic one, not a rough wooden or pottery one.<br /><br />You might have one already, or be able to find one in a homeware store for a few bucks. It will pay for itself in no time!

I&#039;m gonna have to grab a decent mortar and pestle now that you mentioned it, should have more uses as well. Also your dosage link helps me out, I weigh 180lb so I&#039;m gonna dose probably around half of that the first time to get a feel for it, then probably go about 190mg the next time, attempting to hit that k hole I&#039;ve heard so much about. As for stimulants in combination, what did you have in mind? like some amphetamines? caffeine? anyways thanks again.

				Snort the K. Snorting isn&#039;t as bad as you think. It just tickles your nose and a slight burn, but nothing unpleasant.<br />I&#039;ve heard IM (injecting into muscle) is also good. I don&#039;t inject, so I can&#039;t say. But snorting it works well. If you eat it, it don&#039;t feel the same and most people feel sick if they eat K.<br />You will feel a bit drunk to start with and as it hits you more, you will want to sit down or lie down. You will feel very heavy and walking / moving will be a lot of effort.<br />You will also feel dreamy and in a bit of a good mood. Shut your eyes and enjoy it. <br /><br />Also, since it&#039;s your first time it won&#039;t be as good. Most people get a bit anxious / worried / nervous about what the drug will do to them when they drug a new drug.<br />So the first time probably won&#039;t be as good as your future experiences. Also, if you mix with weed it is very nice. But be careful mixing it with alcohol or weed. Both make you drowsy / sleepy and combinations can be unpredictable. I had some alcohol, weed + some K once. The K smashed me after the alcohol and weed. I was so out of it. Luckily K doesn&#039;t last long though.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />

				You&#039;re welcome, Goldman.<br /><br />Stims are not essential, but I feel they can help lift the experience. All of the &quot;common ones&quot; seem to play nice with it.<br /><br />My favorite time to take K (holing dose) is back home after a club, having used molly or whatever earlier. You&#039;re really relaxed but still quite alert, which is the ideal launchpad IMO, esp for a first timer.<br /><br />The pestle is really useful for loads of stuff. Yes, you can use card/spoons whatever, but they tend to be messy and wasteful. In a pestle, you can turn pills into dust in seconds, should you ever need to. The only thing it&#039;s not good for is waxy shit, like coke.<br /><br />Your planned dosage sounds fine, I like to go a bit higher than the max given there, but my tires are pretty worn&nbsp; ;)

				I reckon start with 50mg. Wait 5-10 minutes and see what it feels like and how you feel. Then go for another 50mg after that - Snorted.<br />Just my opinion anyway - But you&#039;d be better off starting with small amounts. Once you&#039;ve taken it, you can&#039;t stop the effects.<br /><br />

				Do small &quot;key bumps&quot; every 10-15 minutes until you reach a desired effect<br />(key bump- put a key into the bag and pull the key out and snort the amount of powder off the end of key, its usually around 20-50 mg)

				The preferred way to do K is by IM injection. Will give you a much better trip than snorting.<br /><br />For some playful effects: 25mg - 50mg.<br />For a proper deep trip: 100g - 300mg<br /><br />You can use a U-100 microfine insulin syringe - ultra-thin short needle. Good for if you&#039;re not into needles as a general thing...<br /><br />Into the shoulder muscle is good.<br /><br />BG

				I&#039;m fairly new to Ketamine, but I would recommend getting yourself a magic bullet. Any decent head shop should carry them. It&#039;s just a trap door that fits onto the top of a vial for taking bumps. Start by insulfating small bumps (you can dump them out to see the pile size) every 5-10 minutes until you reach the desired effect. If you get a little too high, don&#039;t worry. It doesn&#039;t last very long and is pretty safe. It can also go pretty nicely with coke, although whenever I go that route the coke certainly brings down the swirlyness of the ketamine.

I&#039;ll probably just weigh the bump from the bullet to get an idea of how much im actually gonna be taking per turn of the thing. As for needles, I&#039;m gonna avoid them for the time being, never used them before, but thanks for the info nonetheless&nbsp; :) Picked up a mortar and pestle and am patiently awaiting the gear&nbsp; ;D I&#039;ll let every know how it goes
