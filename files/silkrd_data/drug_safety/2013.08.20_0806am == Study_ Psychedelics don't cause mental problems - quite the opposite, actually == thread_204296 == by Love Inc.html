				Hello!<br /><br />Just found this study published in PLoS ONE. <br /><br />Full article here [Clearnet]:<br />http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0063972<br /><br />Data was drawn from more than 130.000 randomly selected people from the US. 22.000 of them had used psychedelics. No correlation was found between mental problems and psychedelics use. In fact, it might even help staying sane. But, we knew that already didn&#039;t we ;)<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />–= ABSTRACT =–<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />The classical serotonergic psychedelics LSD, psilocybin, mescaline are not known to cause brain damage and are regarded as non-addictive. Clinical studies do not suggest that psychedelics cause long-term mental health problems. Psychedelics have been used in the Americas for thousands of years. Over 30 million people currently living in the US have used LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE<br /><br />To evaluate the association between the lifetime use of psychedelics and current mental health in the adult population.<br /><br />METHOD<br /><br />Data drawn from years 2001 to 2004 of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health consisted of 130,152 respondents, randomly selected to be representative of the adult population in the United States. Standardized screening measures for past year mental health included serious psychological distress (K6 scale), mental health treatment (inpatient, outpatient, medication, needed but did not receive), symptoms of eight psychiatric disorders (panic disorder, major depressive episode, mania, social phobia, general anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-affective psychosis), and seven specific symptoms of non-affective psychosis. We calculated weighted odds ratios by multivariate logistic regression controlling for a range of sociodemographic variables, use of illicit drugs, risk taking behavior, and exposure to traumatic events.<br /><br />RESULTS<br /><br />21,967 respondents (13.4% weighted) reported lifetime psychedelic use. There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, lifetime use of specific psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote), or past year use of LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health outcomes. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with lower rate of mental health problems.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />We did not find use of psychedelics to be an independent risk factor for mental health problems.<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________

				Unless you would say that HPPD is a mental problem, which I personally would then in that case between one and five people never come out of the visual state in their trips.<br /><br />This is a mental problem and it fucking sucks and is torture for the first month or onger depending on your mental stability and how fast you leave the depersonalization phase.

There are many additional variables that I think could have been addressed, such as the use of other drugs, history of drug abuse, and explaining more clearly what the criteria for &quot;mental health&quot; consists of. Since the concept of being &quot;mentally healthy&quot; tends to be a social construct, the definition for this term could be better explained and possibly investigated.<br /><br />Regardless, it&#039;s great to see information like this that actually demonstrates the safety and positive side of psychedelic drugs. :)<br /><br />Love,<br />zipstyle
