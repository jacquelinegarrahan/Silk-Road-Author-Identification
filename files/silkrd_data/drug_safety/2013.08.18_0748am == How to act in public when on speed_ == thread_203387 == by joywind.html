				This is a big one for SWIM. Apparently SWIM is embarrassing some of his friends/family, so he has to try to act normal when he&#039;s in public.<br /><br />1. Stop talking. No matter how smart or funny SWIY&#039;r opinion is, DON&#039;T SAY IT. Don&#039;t carry on long conversations with people you just met!! I do this all the time. :( And I love it. :) Let somebody else get a word in now and then. Pretend to listen.<br /><br />2. Don&#039;t stare. Yes, that&#039;s a really interesting pattern on that man&#039;s tie, but stop staring at it. Don&#039;t stare off into space either. Force SWIY&#039;self to look around like normal people.<br /><br />3. Don&#039;t clench/grind SWIY&#039;s teeth. Chew gum if needed, that will make SWIY look normal.<br /><br />4. If SWIY absolutely and positively cannot get out of going to a restaurant with others, then at least order something and have a few bites. Ordering only a pitcher of ice water is a big red flag.<br /><br />5. When the cashier asks how you are, she doesn&#039;t really want to know. Do not tell her. A &quot;Fine, yourself?&quot; is all that is needed.<br /><br />6. Watch the pupils. If SWIY&#039;s pupils are very noticable, try to go places that SWIY can wear sunglasses. If there is no way out of it, wear the sunglasses inside anyway and say SWIY just left the eye dr and their eyes are dilated for the next few hours. Note; this will not work during the hours when the eye doctor&#039;s office is closed. Be real about it.<br /><br />7. Be clean and neat. This goes without saying<br /><br />8. Today is not the day to try a drastic new look, no matter how awesome SWIY thinks SWIY looks with it. It&#039;s probably more over the top than SWIY thinks.<br /><br />9. If SWIY has to hide it from people in their own home, then remembering to lay down in their bed in the dark for at least a few hours at night is important. If SWIY can get away with just being in their room with the door shut, then more power to them, but if SWIY is married or living with someone and trying to hide it from them, make sure to get in the bed for a few hours at least. SWIM knows its a waste of a few good hours, but it&#039;s worth it when SWIY doesn&#039;t get found out and hasseled about it. Also, don&#039;t forget to pretend to eat. If need be, take a plate of food<br />into another room. Throw it away or feed it to the dog etc. But not eating or sleeping will make people suspicious.<br /><br />10. Don&#039;t do strange things in public, like talk to SWIYself or pick at SWIY&#039;r skin or do odd, repetative things. Do not try and straighten up the area when SWIY is not at home. It&#039;s not normal to go to Wal Mart for some paper towels and soap and then proceed to neaten the shelves on every aisle one goes down. Remember to not call attention to SWIYself.<br /><br />These are SWIM&#039;s and she would love to hear from fellow swimmers about how they keep a low profile. SWIM is sure she is overlooking something in this department.

				I don&#039;t about you, &#039;SWIM&#039;, but I, personally, like to act however I want to act. Obviously depends a lot on the drug.<br />But for me the point of drugs is the exact opposite of what you&#039;re writing. It&#039;s about acting how you want to act, doing what you want to do, and not having to give a shit about what others think.<br /><br />I think you&#039;ve got this &#039;drug-thing&#039; all wrong. Drugs are to escape the norms, to shatter depriving laws. <br />They&#039;re about sticking the middle finger to &#039;normality&#039;.<br /><br />Heck if I&#039;m gonna take a drug and crawl up in my ass and not react until it&#039;s over.<br /><br />Obviously there&#039;s exceptions, like if you&#039;re on LSD and get completely surprised by parents/friends/neighbors.<br />But then again, whenever I want to take drugs I make sure that there&#039;s absolutely no possibility of this happening :).<br /><br />I lay my own rules son, not society.

				Well, personally I prefer fishing for relaxation, I had a bad experience in the pool once, I got out rather quickly and my trunks came down in front of everybody!
