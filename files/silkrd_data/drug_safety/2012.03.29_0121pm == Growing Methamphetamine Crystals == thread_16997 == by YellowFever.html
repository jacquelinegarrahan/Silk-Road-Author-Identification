				Mods feel free to move this. I was unsure where it be best posted but figured drug safety as if this was to be done incorrectly could pose many dangers. <br /><br />So if you purchase Meth off SR then it may in chunks or as powder. Some of us like to move a portion of our purchase to friends. What I&#039;d like to know is how can you turn powder into rocks? <br /><br />My very limited understanding of Meth and chemistry tells me that you would be able to dissolve the meth into a solvent, have the crystals grow slowly by placing the solution in a fridge and then evaporating. This could all be so wrong. <br /><br />So if somebody could either give me a descriptive rundown on what to do or a link it would be very much appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks SR

If your buyers have any question about quality, let them try a little bit.<br /><br />But, I have read in Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture, by Uncle Fester, that using 91% Isoprophol alcohol (rubbing alcohol), just enough to dissolve it in like a little pan or small plate, letting it evaporate, will allow for big crystals. I have never tried it.
