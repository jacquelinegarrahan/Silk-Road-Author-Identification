				I have shot 30mg&#039;s of MDA and 75-100mg&#039;s of Heroin in one shot before.&nbsp; That was pretty crazy.&nbsp; Not for young men.

				i dont think its dangerous, being that mdma is a stimulant, and heroin is a CNS depressant. I remember i tried this combo once and it really intensifies the roll. When I did it, I felt like I was having an orgasm for 3 hours straight :)<br />I would say just be careful&nbsp; because the stimulation from the mdma might make you not be to feel the Heroin as much at first, so you might be tempted to do more. Dont. Just sit back and relax and and youll have&nbsp; agreat fuckin time!

				I don&#039;t use heroin, so not sure if this will help, but I&#039;ve been a long-time user of oxycodone (more than 5 years without a single day off). I do keep my doses at a reasonable level so that I can get the pills from my doctor. I&#039;ve found that when I&#039;m rolling, if i take an extra pain pill, which would normally have me nodding out, I feel almost no difference. It certainly doesn&#039;t knock me out or bring me down, I just keep rolling along. YMMV of course.

				Okay, i tried it myself. Friday i was out in a club rolling, without heroin, which was quite fun and Saturday evening i thought i roll home alone with good music and some mdma and heroin. Bad idea.<br />First of all mdma isn&#039;t much fun when being home alone in front of the PC. i could have thought of that ;). <br />I took a bit to much heroin, which made me nodding harder then I&#039;d liked too. I was sitting on the sofa smoking and started nodding so hard that burned many big holes in it. I also burned my skin with the cig.&nbsp; Damn.<br />I also took to much mdma, which completely fucked up my vision, body temperature rose to 37.5°C (99.5°F) and my hands were badly shaking. At one point i stared having weird hallucinations of glowing particles in the air flying towards me. lol. <br />Later i tried to play chess online which was hard cause my vision was impaired and it took me ages to move, since i was nodding always out. I was playing on my laptop and thought it has a touch screen and so i tried to move my pieces by touching the screen. Which didn&#039;t work, but happened again and again.<br /><br />Yeah, all in all a waste of mdma and h. Maybe out in a club and doing less of both would have been more fun ;)<br /><br />dupas

				I have done heroin while peaking on MDMA and it&#039;s straight up mashy fabulous, pretty much the most mindblowing euphoria you can imagine, but if you dose the h too high you&#039;ll just nod off. Also of note is that this combo can be both mentally and physically exhausting afterwards (especially if you don&#039;t have a high tolerance to either drug) to and I wouldn&#039;t recommend it as anything more than an occasional thing.
