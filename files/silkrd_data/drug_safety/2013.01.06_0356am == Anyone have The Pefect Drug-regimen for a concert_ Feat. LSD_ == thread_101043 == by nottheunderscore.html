				Does anyone have a drug regimen for going to a concert that they would highly recommend?&nbsp; I have a stock-pile of drugs at my disposal, but I&#039;m wondering if I should just do JOR&#039;s Lotus tabs that night? I could add Molly to the mix, but is there a certain order that you guys have found works best?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or a certain time-table schedule dosage schedule? <br /><br />How many Lotus&#039;s should I drop if I&#039;m looking for an amazing experience?&nbsp; I&#039;m not the type to freak out in public, and have mixed MDMA and LSD twice before, but never done LSD on its own. <br /><br />I&#039;m 170Lbs ( 77kg ) and very experienced with Psychedelics but new to LSD. <br /><br />Here are the drugs I could add: 2ce, 2ci, 2ct7, MDMA, DMT, 5-Meo DMT.&nbsp;

				An amazing one!&nbsp; I love tripping hard...tripping on the verge of too hard is my way to go.&nbsp; A few months ago I went to a concert and took 125mg of MDMA followed by a booster of 60mg 90 minutes later.&nbsp; About 30 minutes after the booster, I tried Acid for the first time taking one tab of a Fat Freddy from JANNIS it was said to be 200ug.&nbsp; (Most buyers have confirmed Jannis&#039;s Fat Freddys were around that dosage...strong ass tabs) It was quite fun I must say.&nbsp; I totally could&#039;ve had more, but I didn&#039;t want to overdo it on my first go-round.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve never done Acid on its own...but I have done many Research Chemicals like 2ci, 2ce, 2ct2, 2ct7 and have loved them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken large doses of all of them and had a good time, so I&#039;m looking for an amazing concert experience.&nbsp; I have a good mind about drugs and their effects and know that IF it were to get too intense,my apartment is just a short taxi ride away.<br /><br />These LOTUS tabs from JOR are said to be like 60ug.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if anyone has ever taken 2ci and LSD?&nbsp; And if so, how&#039;d that work out?&nbsp; I will look on Erowid now, but I trust the advice of SR people more.&nbsp; <br /><br />My plan is to smoke DMT at some point as well.&nbsp; Either earlier in the day, or after the concert at home.&nbsp; &nbsp;

If you do have 2C-P, 2C-E, or 2C-B I would recommend those over 2C-I. <br /><br />If you decide on 2C-P, I would recommend 13 mg for a good long experience and I would suggest taking it with the first dose of MDMA since it is quite long-lasting and will take a while to come up on. The synergy of 2C-P with MDMA and LSD is fucking amazing. I can give you details on those kinds of visuals if you like.<br /><br />If you decide on 2C-E, I&#039;d recommend 15-20 mg taken with the booster dose of MDMA. 2C-E on its own is like candyflipping in my opinion (not the same, obviously) and with MDMA and LSD it will surely be a mindblowingly euphoric good time.<br /><br />2C-B of course has already been said.<br /><br />I think the reasoning behind doing the LSD first and then MDMA and then the 2C-X is that you want to feel the LSD first. It will allow you to get your footing in a positive direction and enjoy this truly unique comeup without any other distracting substances. Taking MDMA next allows for a new dimension of euphoria and happiness (as well as dancing) that will have at least gone over the first peak by the time you take a booster dose of MDMA and/or the 2C-X. <br /><br />Hope that helps!

				My favourite party/rave/festival combination:<br /><br />140mg MDMA + 60mg MDA<br /><br />... enjoy the roll, when it starts to fade at t +3:00-4:00 drop 20-50mg 2c-b + ~300ug LSD (I tend to go for 40-50mg 2c-b as I like the visuals to be quite intense)<br /><br />This takes you into a wonderfully playful partying headspace, yet still leaves you clear-headed enough to have some good conversations or deal with boring shit if need be :)<br /><br />2c-i / 2c-e are quite fun in this combo too, but i prefer 2c-b<br /><br />Personally... I would not mix in DMT or 2c-t-7 for going out... DMT sends me away and would not be fun at a party, much better at home. 2c-t-7 also better at home in my opinion... when mixing with LSD at least.<br /><br />I&#039;m also not too much of a fan of the usual method of candyflipping... stacking the peaks. I find the MDMA frequently overpowers the LSD experience, speeding things up and even reducing the visuals a bit for me.<br /><br />The order I mentioned above... it feels like you&#039;re rolling for 8-10 hours and the visuals stick around for a good time. The LSD lets you spiral off into little experiences, while the 2c-b helps you stay present, so you can spiral off into a mini universe half way through a sentence &amp; come back to the sentence, carrying on as if you&#039;d never gone anywhere.<br /><br />It&#039;s a fantastic time :)
