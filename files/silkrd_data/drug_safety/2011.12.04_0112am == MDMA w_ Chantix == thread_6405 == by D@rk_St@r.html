				Recently got a gram of MDMA from what was said in the forums to be good. I gave a friend of mine half of it to help him through some tough times, and he told me today he snorted almost half of his half g and felt nothing. I&#039;m bombing roughly 125-135 mg tonight, but one thing he said was that he is taking Chantix to stop smoking and now we are wondering if that might be the cause of his lack of roll. I don&#039;t want to post a bunk review if it was caused by a bad chemical reaction.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas on this? I tried searching around the web and here but didn&#039;t find anything.

				Interesting question.&nbsp; I know Chantix has been reported to have a psychoactive component.&nbsp; Although the mechanism of action is it agonizes and blocks alpha-4-beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.&nbsp; Where serotonin release (Massive) and reuptake inhibition is where MDMA&#039;s magic happens.<br />Looking it up, it doesn&#039;t appear to have any CYP450 metabolism.....so it should not increase/lessen the effects of another drug.&nbsp; I ran it with Prozac to see if there was any drug interaction........none reported.<br /><br />Based on your report, I would be suspect of reality from someone who can choke down 500mg through their nose.&nbsp; That shit tastes like death.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure you are getting the whole story.&nbsp; At a minimum I would suspect something more common like an SSRI.

				Thank you for the response. It took almost an hour and a half for the 125mg I dropped to kick in and then the roll was next to nothing. When I contacted the seller the next day we found out they had other people as well as the seller had the same response. Which was properly handled by the seller so all is well in the end. <br /><br />As far as the 500mg up the nose, I&#039;m not surprised at all as the person has a nose of steal from previous powder abuse.
