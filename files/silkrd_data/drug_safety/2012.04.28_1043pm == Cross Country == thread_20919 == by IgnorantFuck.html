				Hey SR, I&#039;m planning a long trip across the continental US (I&#039;m moving, if that&#039;s relevant) and want to bring some drugs with me. Is there anything I should be wary of? <br /><br />More specifically, are there checkpoints where they search my car or something?<br /><br />I know I&#039;ve got to watch for cops, obviously, but I&#039;m more worried about things I&#039;d only encounter on a really long drive. Please and thanks.<br /><br />(It&#039;s also worth mentioning I didn&#039;t know where this should go. Debated between off topic and here, chose this section ultimately)

				If it is that small of an amount just put it in a baggie and small container and then your ass crack if you get pulled over. I have been saved so many times from being arrested by stashing stuff in between my ass cheeks. Some people laugh and snicker, but good for them when they are in the county jail and I am at home getting high.<br /><br />Also underneath your hood was where I would stash large quantities of weed for transporting and the cops never ever checked there, but I was just driving a hundred miles in state, so it wasn&#039;t like I was coming out of Arizona heading East where they look for people smuggling drugs in unusual places. I also would have a dog with me, so they couldn&#039;t use their canine if you have your personal pet in the car.

				No, they don&#039;t sense the dog being present would make their dogs hitting on the car invalid, because it could be just reacting to the other dog present. They could ask you to take your dog out, but you then would have a reasonable defense to get the evidence thrown out since their dogs hits on the car can be argued against which then gives them no probable cause.<br /><br />They never do make you remove your pet in all the times I have been in that situation or close friends of mine either. It seems to be a good deterrent, so I see no reason against it, and all the more for it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you have to legally remove your dog form the car especially if you have no leash or collar. Anyway, maybe you can research it and provide us with information about how valid this technique is beside my anecdotal claims.

				I wasn&#039;t saying you were wrong or I knew this to be fully try, that is was I suggested you research it.<br /><br />I can only tell you what I was told from the people I would pick up weight from, and was young when I started making trips, and followed their advice since they had been doing this for many years and it was a family operation that was pretty successful. <br /><br />I am sure if they knew you had drugs in the car and were transporting then yah you are fucked from the get go, but from my experience you are way less likely to have a cop want to search your car when a big ass dog is in the back that looks mean.<br /><br />The part about the K9 is what I was told that a defense attorney could argue that the scent or presence of another dog may cause the K9 to alert to the dog and not drugs, not because it gets confused, but because it is excited and is more interested in sniffing out the dog smell then drugs since that is its natural instinct.<br /><br />No need to get offended man. I wasn&#039;t trying to say I am right and you are wrong. I just believe in this method, and it has been reliable for in state transport of quantity drugs and not getting searched.<br /><br />Also, I have refused a search of my car so many times when I have been alone that I can&#039;t even come up with a rough number, and it doesn&#039;t give them any right or probable cause to search your vehicle which is your personal property until they either get a warrant or get a dog to say there is contraband in there.<br /><br />If there is/are states that say refusing to let a cop search your car is probable cause then that seems like it breaks a constitutional right.
