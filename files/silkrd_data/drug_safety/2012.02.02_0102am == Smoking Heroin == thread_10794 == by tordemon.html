				So I&#039;ve been having this problem lately. I did contact my seller about the heroin, and he confirmed what other forum users had said, that his heroin was good to smoke. The problem is that when I start to heat it, little mini explosions go off, scattering my product everywhere, and some of it into my mouth (I use a base pipe, and it goes out of the pipe as well). These things taste absolutely horrible, so that&#039;s kinda majorly a problem in my opinion.<br /><br />So, my hypothesis is that the reason this is happening is because I&#039;m heating it too quickly; the bottom part is melting and boiling before the top part is able to melt, hence the explosion. Next time I should take caution to try to melt it all very slowly before trying to smoke it. I&#039;d appreciate advice from somebody perhaps more experienced with the subject; some verification that this is the likely cause of the phenomenon I&#039;m experiencing, and that my proposed solution is the correct one.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had any trouble getting the effects; I can verify that the product is good, it&#039;s just a matter of technique, as today was only the second time or so that I&#039;d smoked it. I&#039;d presumed it would be similar to smoking meth/crack, but both of those are in larger chunks and melt without trouble (at least the two products that I got), and so I haven&#039;t encountered this issue before.<br /><br />TL;DR: Does heating more slowly prevent powders from making mini explosions that send the product flying?<br /><br />Thanks, you guys. =]

I feel like it&#039;s also more effective because none of it just gets away. It makes sense to me, though; I&#039;ll have to do it more slowly next time.
