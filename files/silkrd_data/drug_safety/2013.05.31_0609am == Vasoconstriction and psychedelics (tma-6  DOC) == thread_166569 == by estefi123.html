				Well I did 40mg of tma-6 yesterday and what an interesting trip but the vasoconstriction (i think it was this) really destroyed me, I did nbomes 2c-b and various stims and never noticed it but this time it was very uncomfortable. <br />What can I do to prevent this?&nbsp; <br />Besides chemicals, should I exercise and keep warm or the opposite?<br />I am planing on doing doc in a week or two, is that substanse as heavy on the body as this?<br />So far all I could gather was that chocolate and thc can help, poppers would be too short lived and cant find if viagra or aspirin would help.<br /><br />The experience in short:<br />Phyisically<br />My hands and feet were cold, i started to feel a tingle going through my arm all the way to my little finger, it wasnt too intense but still, the little finger felt a little numb, and the worst part was my lower back, after sitting for a while it started to ache, it stopped once i lied in the bed but it was a little bit painful\uncomfortable to move, made me feel as an old man.<br />Mentally<br />It was a very positive trip no anxiety no bad thoughts, only when the vasoconstriction started I thought my hands were turning blue but it didnt lasted much, oh yes when i went to take a shower i started to lose my ego as I felt that I was not just this body but the universe, it and part of it and a general line of thought similar in a way to that of George Carlin and Bill Hicks and at first it was a little bit scary but it was more weird and unexpected than scary. I may do a trip report in a couple of days.<br />It didnt lasted THAT much, after 8 hours it started to fade away pretty quick felt very sober at the 12hour mark but before that it was very constant didnt feel any kind of peak but more like waves.
