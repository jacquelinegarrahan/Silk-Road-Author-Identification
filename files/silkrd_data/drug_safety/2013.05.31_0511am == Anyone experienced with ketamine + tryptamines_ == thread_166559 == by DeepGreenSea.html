				I&#039;ve got some spare coins and want to order a tryptamine to combine with ketamine. I&#039;ve heard a few people mention DPT working well with K, thats what I&#039;m leaning towards right now. 5-MeO-DMT and 4-AcO-DMT sounds pretty fucking intense, and don&#039;t know much else about any of the 4-HO&#039;s<br /><br />Would be curious to hear other peoples experiences / suggestions.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be IMing both fwiw

				I have mixed 4-AcO-DMT and ketamine.<br /><br />Was crazy.<br />Haven&#039;t really got words for it, had this whole ego loss thing going on.<br />Lost my understanding of existence, death, life, happyness, consequences etc.<br />Not that I wouldn&#039;t do it again, but would probably do a smaller dose.

				I&#039;d go with the 5-MeO-DMT, it&#039;s intense and short acting like ketamine so I think it&#039;d mix well with ketamine I think. It also doesn&#039;t cause nausea which is another reason why it&#039;d be better (and safer) with K. Be careful with breathing disturbances though, high doses of 5-MeO-DMT disturb breathing and ketamine does too so it can be dangerous. <br />You should IM a K-hole dose of ketamine and IM the 5-MeO-DMT a couple of minutes after that, so that both peaks would happen at the same time, 5-MeO being faster and shorter acting. That way you&#039;ll be in the void and in the K-hole simultaneously! I&#039;d like to hear how it was if you do it, it must be extremely intense.

				It depends on whether it&#039;s freebase or not. You should ask the vendor if it&#039;s a salt or a freebase and turning it into a salt would be more complicated that adding citric acid to it if you want to do it properly. I&#039;m no expert on that though so you should look it up. I&#039;d think it&#039;s a salt because 5-MeO is often snorted and for something to work with snorting it has the be water soluble, generally if you can snort, then you can inject. If the vendor doesn&#039;t know, try snorting it to see if it work and if it does, there&#039;s a good chance you can safely inject.<br />Use clean equimpent and things like a wheelfilter if you can, It&#039;s much more healthy that way.
