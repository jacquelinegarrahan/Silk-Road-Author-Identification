				So, I used to use opiates quite a bit. Nothing regular, I&#039;d basically take whatever I could get my hands on. I don&#039;t think I was ever really physically addicted though I definitely felt&nbsp; drawn to opiates in general mentally.<br />However, I&#039;ve basically avoided all opiates for a long time, it&#039;s been about 6 months or so at least. I recently bought a single heroin stamp from deluxedelivery. The review threads seem to indicate the quality of his product as being quite high.<br /><br />I figured I&#039;d snort as my ROA, but basically since I haven&#039;t had opiates in forever I figure my tolerance is probably non-existant so any idea on how much I should use? I was thinking stick to like half a match head size dose, snort, wait 10-20 minutes for effects and snort another dose until I get to where I want. Too little or too much? Thoughts?

				Never snorted the stuff so it might be best to get a second opinion, but starting off slowly is always a good idea. With that ROA you should know whether or not to redose in about 10 minutes but it&#039;s never bad to go slow especially if you have a low tolerance.

				You may end up being disappointed, since you only got one bag.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve heard, stamp bags around here are consistently underweight, to the point where you&#039;re lucky to get even 60mg. You&#039;re supposed to get 100mg in a stamp bag.<br /><br />Also, with stamp bags it&#039;s very easy to take some out or take some out and then cut the rest.<br /><br />Like the other guy said, start slow. However, I imagine you&#039;ll end up having to do it all fairly quickly to get the results you want.<br /><br />If you wanna try some decent heroin but you&#039;re low on funds, I&#039;d recommend Purest. He&#039;s got a listing for a .1 sample of black tar heroin.&nbsp; The quality was okay for me (low-medium tolerance, IV&#039;ed). The price isn&#039;t that great for the quality, but it&#039;s still the cheapest listing that isn&#039;t a stamp bag.<br /><br />Right now, I&#039;m waiting on a half G of powder black tar from Einstein777. The price per .1 is much better than Purest. If the quality is at least the same, I&#039;ll be happy. Einstein said the shit was pretty strong, but we&#039;ll see in a day or two.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I&#039;ve never tried DD&#039;s stamps, so I don&#039;t know for certain. I&#039;m only repeating what I&#039;ve heard about stamp bags in general. By no means am I talking shit about anybody.<br /><br />But yeah, start small and start slow, just in case.
