				Earlier, i decided to post a story about an extremely negative experience i had with methylone, this being a harm reduction forum and all.<br />All I wanted to do was warn people to not treat it lightly, as it is very different from MDMA, and caused some serious health problems in me.<br />I assumed this behavior would be encouraged on a DRUG SAFETY forum, but instead, i get mocked relentlessly AND given negative karma for trying to save people&#039;s lives.<br />This is absolutely disgraceful that your harm reduction forum operates this way.<br />Unless something gets done about this, expect to never see me post shit here again.

				Forums are not the place for the over sensitive. The SR forums are great, but with the nature of the subject you will get more opinions and more people posting for the wrong reasons or hidden agendas than your usual forum.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t take the heat get out the kitchen man, stand your ground or walk away :)<br /><br />

				No im not saying that at all Junjo, I have read your post and commented, I think it a perfectly valid and useful piece on information.<br /><br />Im just saying that if your going to post on here expect idiots like Dilbert to comment, just ignore, fight back or walk away man, no point getting worked up about it :)<br /><br />

				Man Dilbert is clearly a troll, hes posting loads of utter rubbish. The more you bite into that the more incentive it gives said troll to continue. They wake up and make a decision to come online and try and wind people up and generally cause shit on these forums....<br /><br />Im not saying I think its right, I just accept thats what we have to live with in 2013, its common on any forum or place that becomes a social hub, by posting threads like this, your basically saying hey this troll got to me, and based on that, said troll will be back again and again.<br /><br />If you ignore said troll, eventually they will think whats the point no ones responding anyway..<br /><br />Hope that makes sense!

				MDMA made me retarded! Im serious! Im retarded now. It had horrible effects on me. Maybe DMT didnt turn my knees purple but most of this ruined my life with one time. All drugs make me depressed when im not high anymore. Weed does make me a lazy cunt and i get nothing done. I was pretty honest. This is the area for harm reduction.<br /><br />Be careful with drugs everyone! Made my life a living hell after only one use :&#039;(
