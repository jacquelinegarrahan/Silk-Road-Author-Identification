				So I got a free capsule of a mixture of 400ug 25I + 200ug 25C from the fabulous vendor Tyler Durden with my purchase. Felt compelled to give him compliments.<br /><br />Anyway I was wondering if anybody had experience with this sort of combination before I give it a try.<br />I read one report (only report I could find) on another forum of somebody having a horrible reaction of naseua and vasoconstriction, but then again he took higher of a dosage than this. (he took around 1.2mg of 25c and 600ug of 25i if i remember correctly).<br /><br />So I just want to see if anybody could give me some good tips/experience/knowledge on this combination, I will be trying this safely in my room/house as I do with every psychedelic for the first time.<br /><br />Thank you<br />-Pilot<br /><br />Edit: <br /><br />8:40Started off with snorting half to see how it feels. Makes my nose tickles and im sneezing like a mofo now.. Ah man my nose is running like a bitch..<br />Well so far this is just great, nose running and sneezing a lot. Will update later.<br /><br />8:50: I think I feel it coming up, slight visual distortions. Straight lines appear to be bent. Body feels a bit ticklish. Slight shaking in the legs, mostly the shaking is just excitement of taking the drug haha. Might snort some more in a bit depending on how i feel. Watching the Cat In The Hat on TV isn&#039;t really helping.. trippy movie..<br /><br />9:00: Didnt take more, stomach is a little upset, body feels kinda tingly, I&#039;ll stop here for now, I don&#039;t really like this combination so far, but it may be because i am not 30 minutes into it nor am i the entire dose in. I also appear to look somewhat oily and greasy around the forehead..<br /><br />9:05: Feeling nauseus, not doing any more of this stuff until another time. Also straightthings seem wavy when i stare at them, now all the sudden feeling kinda better the nausea went away now i will click save.<br /><br />9:05: when i stare at something, it becomes wavy, and things in the corner of my eye are wavy.<br /><br />9:15 So yeah like the letters are kinda dancing and moving and growing when I look at them, but my body feels wierd and when I look at something else or focus on something else I feel nauseus? I think idk<br /><br />Listening to Disconnected by Pegboard Nerds, sounds eargasmic.<br /><br />9:25 Went to get some water, this when everything went uphill. While filling up my cup at the fridge I noticed my fridge was growing/breathing. Then I noticed the magnets and pictures/papers on the fridge were growing and moving a little bit! So I looked around and the entire kitchen/family room looked as if I was looking through a fish eye. It looked amazing. So I started looking at the paintings on the walls, they looked so trippy, the colors were moving around and the picture was almost morphing around. The espresso sign on the wall&#039;s letters were slowly breathing and changing around. I must&#039;ve spent about 10 minutes walking around my family room looking at things. Then I noticed I dropped my cup of water in amazement.<br /><br /><br />Complete Edit: This is fucking amazing, I dont even want to write about it becauyse I want to enjoy it.<br /><br />Later that night: Just enjoyed some music, I was able to conversate well on facebook to this girl.<br />But I realized sitting in my room was such a buzzkill, I wish I could&#039;ve gone out and walked around outside or something. So I just unpleasantly laid down and watched TV and tried to relax until I could fall asleep. Was watching friends until like 2 in the morning. And I had pretty bad vasoconstriction in my toes/feet.<br /><br />Overall pretty decent, next time I do it itl be in a better enviroment.

				i&#039;ve never personally combined the two, but have heard hearsay online that it is more likely to cause upset stomaches and the like<br /><br />again, just hearsay. i&#039;ve also heard that it is feels very similar to LSD, but i always take those sorts of comparisons with a grain of salt

				Take some drammamine and hour before you take it and wrap yourself in a large blanket until the blood starts flowing again. I like to cuddle up on my couch with a comforter and some kind of eye candy on the tube during the come-up since I&#039;m always cold at first.

				None of this has helped me at all.<br />Will the dosage I am taking give me the risk of vasoconstriction or anything negative? And will I be fine and content taking this in the safety of my room?

				Nbome&#039;s are vasoconstrictive, you risk it every time you take one or more. <br /><br />So yes, my advice was me trying to help you. To prevent nausea, take drammamine an hour before you plan to trip. To deal with vasoconstriction, wrap yourself in a large blanket or put on extra layers of clothes.

				Okay, but with the small doses I am taking (400ug of 25i and 200ug of 25c) will I reach any severe negative affects? I normally have not ever had problems with vasoconstriction since my muscles and body is very healthy. However I&#039;ll prepare for it anyway.<br /><br />But do I risk anything else, just looking for assurance that my dosage is accurate and that I will not overdose/underdose and that I will be safe in my room :)

				No one can guarantee that you won&#039;t experience negative affects or even severe negative affects with this or any psychedelic regardless of the dose. It&#039;s the risk we take when we take new things or combinations. Some people feel horrible on some of these NBOMe&#039;s or combos, I&#039;m unfortunate to feel horrible on all NBOMe&#039;s if I don&#039;t preload. And even then I have some discomfort during the come-up. <br /><br />The dose you&#039;re planning is not unreasonable. <br /><br />As I said in my pm, the good thing about insufflation is: come-up is a lot faster which is the time period where it might be uncomfortable. Make sure you have some music or TV going when you take it. If you don&#039;t need it, you can turn it off and do whatever you have planned for your trip. If you end up feeling really horrible, tell yourself that it will be over in about 15 minutes ... lie down, and make yourself comfortable until you start to feel good. Try to focus on the music/TV, think good thoughts, and once it passes --have a great trip!

				L1ly&#039;s advice is sound (thank you for the Dramamine tip!). Come ups can be chilly, especially.with insuflation ime. <br />While I haven&#039;t personally tried that particular combo,&nbsp; I can tell you that I&#039;ve taken 25I +25D in the same evening, both at far higher doses. Twas&#039; retarded, but I did not die, nor did I have any unpleasant side effects. I did have an amazing experience.<br /><br />Not 100% relevant I know. You might have a bad time. Might be fantastic . You probably will live to share your experience over in the NBOME sticky thread and we will be grateful for your valuable contribution to space exploration.<br /><br />Personally, I feel the vasoconstriction fears may be overblown and misinterperated, and probably misunderstood by most. If you&#039;re healthy and have no history of cardiovascular issues, there isn&#039;t much to fear with reasonable doses. Just my opinion.<br /><br />

				i would be really careful if you decide to snort it, i dont know how the dosages were measured, but with a scale it would be nearly impossible to do accurately. <br /><br />start with a bit to test first if you do.&nbsp; 400 ug is a tiny amount and i cant imagine being able to weigh it out or even see (let alone snort) unless it was cut in some way... which is dangerous itself.&nbsp; your capsule may actually contain more than 200 ug of each so you could inadvertently overdose. <br /><br />if hes sending out capsules, id kinda hope he has tried the combo and his other irl customers/friends have approved. ask the vendor if you are unsure, but if its a capsule hes probably got the dosage figured out and intends you to take as is
