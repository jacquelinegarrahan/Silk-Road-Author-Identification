				YES this is a shill account im just plainly to ashamed to post this on my main account.<br /><br />Cut a long story short<br /><br />Somehow 7grams of fishscale yayo and 7 grams of white MDMA got mixed together. Now i need to urgently separate these two...<br /><br />i realise they can both be washed in dry acetone?<br /><br />can someone please HELP me in pointing me in the direction of separating these two substances<br /><br />I dont need to be patronized so if you come onto this topic to do so keep it to your self.<br /><br />i am here for help.<br /><br />If i had too choose between one of the tewo it wouldbe the YAYO as it is much more difficult for me to get...<br /><br />thanks everybody for your help

				Lol. How the fuk you do that?<br /><br />Best bet is to sell to festival kids that love to mix shit ;)<br /><br />Your looking at a lot of procedures that will most likely destroy/harm one or the other. Dry acetone wash will only give you cleaner MDMA/Coke mix.<br /><br />Give them both an acetone wash and then dump out (after very dry) and separate the crystals with edge of a card for 30-40 min by hand with good light :)<br />

				You could place the mixture into a very small holed kitchen sieve, as the coke is a lot thinner than the MDMA crystals, most of the coke will go through the sieve and the MDMA will stay in the sieve. <br />Failing that you could place the mixture into a frying pan or baking tray, and shake side to side until the heavier crystals (mdma) is floating on top of the coke. This may take some time and a lot of picking out MDMA crystals but it may be your only shot.<br />Let me know how it goes, I&#039;ll happily accept 5btc if it works :) lol.

				thats not even the worst of it, i only realise when the back of my brain was on fire i wasnt just having YAYO haha!!<br /><br />ok<br /><br />They were already both quite pure,<br /><br />If i acetone wash will the crystals be seperate coke/mdma??? will i be able to tell the difference??<br /><br />Thanks for the input!!<br /><br />i am going to trey both these methods and i will hook everybody up.

After washing the batch in dry acetone and letting it dry completely, get a bright light over it and sit there with a card and separate out the crystals. There will be an obvious difference between the compounds especially after you&#039;ve separated some into 2 piles, you will notice they are different. If the mdma was very brown then your best bet might be to just do the separation without the wash. The wash will make the differences between the two show up more. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=58942.msg544262#msg544262">Quote from: flwrchlds9 on October 25, 2012, 12:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your looking at a lot of procedures that will most likely destroy/harm one or the other.

				i searched for hours literally trying to help you and cant find one fucking solvent that will dissolve one chem but not the other in either salt or base form for both - the alkaloids are just too similar chemically even though they have very different structures<br /><br />basically your only option is going to be to utilize the difference in pKa to try and base one while leaving the majority of the other as a salt because the pKa of cocaine is about 8.6 and the pKa for mdma is around 10.2<br /><br />so basically what you are doing is making crack, which will cause the cocaine base to become insoluble in water while most of the mdma should stay in the aqueous solution, separating the two, and then reforming the coke salt<br /><br />ive never done this just to warn you, but you would dissolve the mixture in a decent amount of water (not too much cause youre gonna have to evaporate it off). then add baking soda, maybe around a teaspoon to two teaspoons, if you can monitor the pH id recommend it to make sure you dont get it much above 9... but the pH of a sodium bicarbonate solution should be about 8.2.&nbsp; then heat slightly, not too much, (microwave or stove) just so the solution will bubble, and the coke base will float to the top as an oil. use a knife to twist around in the oil and collect the coke off the top which should stick to the knife.&nbsp; then make up another aqueous solution that is slightly acidic (muriatic acid from hardware store diluted greatly), which will &quot;hopefully&quot; react with the base and reform the cocaine salt in the water because i assume you dont want crack. <br /><br />evaporate off the water from each solution (low temp as not to damage the molecules) and you &quot;should&quot; be left with the compounds mostly separated. weigh them to see if it worked, there will be some additional salt in the coke though. plus if some extra sodium bicarbonate is left over in the mdma it will just raise the stomach pH and actually increase the amount absorbed - potentiating it, so no harm there. if you raise the pH of the solution too much though you will basify the mdma as well and pull too much of it with the cocaine freebase<br /><br />make sure the acidic solution is neutralized (you only need a couple drops of the acid) by adding a little baking soda if you add too much acid - HCl is volatile so it &quot;should&quot; evaporate off too, but just dont want you to snort a crazy acidic solution or something

				How was the mixture when you tried it?<br /><br />Good luck with a separation, but I think it won&#039;t be worth the effort.

				It&#039;s a good effort but most likely will result in a mess/muck and/or destroyed/harmed product either both or one of.<br /><br />Best bet is separate out physically/visually.

You obviously dont understand the chemistry... and he already has a mess.&nbsp; The methods are extremely common for basing and purification. If I didnt have a decent idea about what I was talking about I wouldnt have recommended it. A/B extractions are extremely common and the most basic kitchen chemistry you can do essentially <br /><br />You are free to give your suggestion, but so am I. Just leave it at that and let him decide. Dont talk shit about my suggestion saying its going to harm the chems when it wont unless he cant follow basic instructions a monkey basically could perform like using straight acid<br /><br />If they are both powdered and white what you are suggesting for fourteen grams is nearly impossible and would take forever, much longer than 30 min. you suggest... Youre talking hours of tedious work unless the crystals are huge - and then im pretty sure it would have been obvious just to pick them out. I am just suggesting another realistic option because he needed help that would be much easier and take about 15 min max beside the evaporation which is hardly any effort
