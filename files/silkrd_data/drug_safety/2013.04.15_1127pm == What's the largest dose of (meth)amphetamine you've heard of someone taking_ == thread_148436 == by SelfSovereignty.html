				For some reason it&#039;s very difficult to find actual numbers really anywhere.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to know how much you&#039;ve heard of people taking, or have taken yourself, either single dose or over 24 hours.&nbsp; Whatever really.&nbsp; I just want to try and get a better idea.&nbsp; Route of administration matters a lot, since 50mg IV is obviously a lot stronger than 50mg orally.

				So am I... extremely curious, in fact.&nbsp; My fear is that someone&#039;s going to pop up and say &quot;there&#039;s this crazy mother fucker in the meth thread, his name&#039;s SS, he -- oh...&quot;&nbsp; lol

				Some guy I talked to online some months back claimed to have slammed 1g at once.<br /><br />I think his claims of slamming a half gram at once were more plausible...he could just be full of shit but he says he was addicted as fuck and had been at it for 3 years.

				I don&#039;t iv very often, but when i do i go big!. (I try to keep the needles put up since i enjoy the rush so much more than smoking.)<br /><br />The most i have personally loaded in one shot was a quarter gram. (250mgs.) It lead to an orgasm. I didn&#039;t enjoy the high very much. (After the initial rush wore off.) I was very scatter brained and couldn&#039;t talk.)<br /><br />The most I&#039;ve done when it comes to smoking is a full gram&nbsp; in one bowl over the course of an hour. (Non stop hitting.) the high was pretty intense but not as much as using the needle. It felt more of a waste since about half way through the bowl i seemed to plateau. I&#039;m assuming this is because i couldn&#039;t absorb enough quickly to increase the levels of MA in my system. (Another theory is once you have reached a certain high when it comes to smoking. You can&#039;t get higher.)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I think the most i have used in a 24 hour period is in the two gram mark. When it comes to meth i normally find myself holding back. I&#039;ve never went as hard as i would like. (In the fear of i might not be around to tell the tale.)<br /><br />I don&#039;t encourage or condone these doses as they could prove harmful to others.

Was it a Salad bowl perchance? lol<br />I don&#039;t imagine it would be easy to keep at least a good portion of the ice from boiling with a full G!<br />200mg in a single bowl would be the most I&#039;d thrown in at once...<br /><br />In terms of the most in a single intake, that would be around 1 - 1.5 points crushed up and hot railed.<br />Was scared I was going to set the smoke alarms off in my apartment when I blew out that cloud!<br />I&#039;ve never IVed and don&#039;t intend to but I doubt he intensity of the rush was that much weaker than IV-ing a point...

I don&#039;t IV, but the same damn thing happens to me these days.&nbsp; It&#039;s like I just don&#039;t... &quot;tweak&quot; the way I used to.&nbsp; Almost like I&#039;m normal, just high as fuck and scatter brained.&nbsp; Seems like no matter how much I take it doesn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; It also seems like lately -- even though I haven&#039;t really gotten a sense of euphoria for ages -- I actually get *dysphoria* the more I do.<br /><br />That&#039;s actually why I asked: I&#039;m pushing it pretty far these days, and I can&#039;t seem to find any reliable accounts online of people who keep going... I&#039;m all about informed decisions; but people don&#039;t just come out and talk about this shit.&nbsp; Gee, I wonder why -- could it be the BURNING FUCKING SHAME, ya think?&nbsp; But Hell with it.&nbsp; I want answers, anecdotal or othewise.&nbsp; So thank you for your responses; keep &#039;em coming if anybody has them :)

				The only time i can actually achieve euphoria i end up over stimulated, over heated, and pissed at the end of the day. <br /><br />One way i can achieve euphoria without those side effects is if i bump a dissociative. Personally i enjoy ketamine the most since it&#039;s short acting. There seems to be something with the dopamine going on. You should give it a try and let me know what your thoughts are.<br /><br />The other way is with H, but that normally ends with withdrawal. Since, I&#039;m one of the few who don&#039;t enjoy H withdrawal. I find the negative side effects of H to out weigh the positive side effects. <br /><br />I hope that you can find euphoria. I know how annoying it is when you find yourself chasing something you can&#039;t catch. That&#039;s why when i do get euphoria. I cherish it, breathe deeply with my eyes closed, and hum a tune. It&#039;s something magical. <br /><br />Oh, and cousin frank has the best domestic ketamine in my opinion. Tell him sniper sent ya and he&#039;ll look out for you.
