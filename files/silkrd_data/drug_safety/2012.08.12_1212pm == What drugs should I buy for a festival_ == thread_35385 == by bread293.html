				Cocaine - I&#039;ve only had shit street stuff and I wasn&#039;t very impressed about the high/value ratio. Rather get a few MDMA pills. Here on SR there is washed coke and its the best some people have ever tried! I&#039;m a little anxious (as I have been with any new drug) any words of advice here<br /><br />Drone - Much cheaper than coke, means I could share. tried before good chatty high<br /><br />MDMA -Nothing new here, sometimes you get wapped out and not good for talking to people.

				I say screw the coke. That doesn&#039;t sound fun being geeked out around a bunch of strangers trying to sneak another line and then coming down just wanting to be by yourself in the tent while your favorite band is playing. Coke is good for drinking late at night at a titty bar, but not a music festival.<br /><br />I say Shrooms, molly, and some weed.

				I think it depends on music and people at the festival. There&#039;s a difference between psytrance (where is normal to take lsd or shrooms), house/techno/dnb (dance) music (coke, mdma) and regular &quot;beer&quot; festival. But mainly it&#039;s about you and how well are you comfortable with taking drugs on such places.

				Yer I agree with gulage. Hippy shindigs need psychs whereas dance music is all about md maybe with coke for the comedown as a booster. Ketamine is good for DNB too.

				I could see the xanax turning into something bad. Being up for a while and doing a bunch of drugs you pop a xanax to go to sleep in an unfamiliar place and end up going god knows where or doing who knows what eventually falling asleep lost some place unfamiliar or on the jail cell floor. <br />

				M1 and Drone. They go together like Bread and Butter do. Such a lovely combo, both drugs are relatively cheap as well.<br /><br />That combo is my personal favourite.<br /><br />Have fun!

Plus weed, alcohol, etc.. Apvp to wake up, tagamet to potetinate, many methadone or 100mg hydro, Psychedelic mixtues each night (2cb/MDA/tma-6), (amt + opana methadone and hydro oooh such a good combo) 4-aco-dmt, mxe 5abp. Never took the lsd, didnt need it. Get to hotel, take etiz. Imeddiately hit DMT hit or two, stare in awe of the strip. Opana shot to end the night.

				DOC lasts a really long time and gives you lots of energy.<br /><br />I personally smoke weed during the day, trip on LSD at night... and if there&#039;s another day I&#039;ll do something like 25i-NBOMe (cause I can take more due to tolerance without hurting my wallet). You can also try 6-apb which lasts a good 6-8 hours. Ketamine and mxe are good too and aren&#039;t really cross-tolerant.

				Nah Coke is definitely good for festivals but it&#039;s good at very specific times. The journey there, and then with some K when you are chillaaaain down at the campsite. Obviously it&#039;s a right ballache to do Blow in the tents so that&#039;s the time to dab the Mandy. Also it&#039;s good to snort off any rave-candy&#039;s tits you might pull.&nbsp; ::)

				Personally recommend MDMA for the last night of festival, 2C-B for every day use (i dropped 2C-B four days in a row and it was just as good each time!!) - it&#039;s lightweight so you/your friends wont freak out and you&#039;ll get lots of beautiful visual stuff and also stimulation with NO come-down, Amphetamine to have when you start losing energy, Methoxetamine/Ketamine to have to chill when you&#039;re around your campsite, LOTS AND LOTS OF CANNABIS TO SMOKE EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF FESTIVAL - get some synthetic pot as well to make your shared joints go further and also so you can smoke in crowds and you wont get the annoying &quot;aww mann you&#039;re smokin a dooob can i get a drag??&quot; from the random drunk peeps. <br /><br />I wouldnt recommend heavier psychedelics like LSD/DOC/Shrooms as they are just too heavyweight to have at such a busy place, Maybe a Tab (SINGLE TAB) of acid cos it lasts ages and will keep you going, but i dont think it&#039;s good for getting to know strangers as Acid tends to make people a little self-conscious i think.<br /><br />AMT is also a good idea for festival as it&#039;s a bit heavier than 2c-b albeit less visual.<br />Fuck coke, not for festival<br /><br />Get some Zaleplon to help you sleep as well - it has a really short half life so you wont wake up feeling groggy ;)<br /><br />Ondansetron is fantastic for stopping any drug related nausea/hangover nausea, also if you&#039;re dealing with powders weigh/divvy up your shit before you go there. if it rains it will suck trying to do that shit in a dark possibly wet tent when you&#039;re almost certainly not going to be sober !!
