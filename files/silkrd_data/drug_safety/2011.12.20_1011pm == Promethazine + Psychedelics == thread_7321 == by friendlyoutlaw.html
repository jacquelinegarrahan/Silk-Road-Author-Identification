				Ok, so I happen to have about 20 promethazine pills (25mg) laying around from a shoulder surgery I had last year.<br /><br />I knew they were an anti-nausea medicine, but I didn&#039;t really know much about them. On a whim, I searched for them on SR and saw that they are being sold as an opiate potentiator. Nice coincidence, I just got a 20 pack of percocets from Pharmville.<br /><br />But then I started thinking...I always seem to have nausea when I&#039;m coming up on psychedelics. Does anybody have any idea if promethazine is effective in mitigating that? <br /><br />I still have 1.5g of goldismoney&#039;s mescaline that has been screaming for consumption, and I&#039;d love to go in prepared with something to address the nausea (and perhaps a couple of valium laying around just in case).

				That is a good questions, I would see if they have this question answered at the shroomery website.<br /><br />I have some promethazine also and I sick when I eat mushrooms. I will try eating half of one 30 minutes or so before tripping and let you know how it goes, if you don&#039;t find your answer by then already.

				promethazine on its own is very mild &amp; nice. almost like a coud. 25mgs is tiny. i&#039;d consider taking 100+<br /><br />its conidered very safe and can be taken by pregnant women. its also otc in many parts of the world.

				On a related note, I&#039;m prescribed hydroxyzine (Vistaril/Atarax) for anxiety since they took my benzos. It also potentiates opiates, and interestingly, brings LSD trips to a screeching halt. The visuals for the most part aren&#039;t as apparent and it&#039;s nice to have on hand just incase.
