				Is that a Marquis or Mecke test?<br /><br />If its Mecke it looks like 2c-B possibly.. But those are monster pills for it to be 2c-B.<br />If its a Marquis... I would flush the batch cause your guess is as good as mine. <br /><br />Were they sold to you as MDMA?

Kudos for having a test kit though :D Better safe then sorry. <br /><br />If you bought them from a SR vendor then use your feedback to let others know what you got. It helps keep the community pure.

				Thanks for the product recommendation. I currently dont own a milligram scale and not sure if i could afford one i&#039;d trust. Thats what made &quot;high quality pressies&quot; or even caps appealing...because it has been dosed out already. Any advice on scales/dosages if i do decide to go that route?(im sure there are a million posts that ask that same question but i figure while im here why not)<br /><br /><br />Thanks so much everyone. I love that this community is constantly looking out for one another...im just glad to be a part of it.

				I can highly, highly, highly recommend the selller Aidoneus for MDMA, this listing in particular: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/65d08ecb6a<br /><br />Premeasured to 140mg, no more dealing with tiny piles of nasty tasting powder. I have used three vendors for molly (the other domestic seller was UnderGroundSyndicate, also highly recommended), but Aidoneus is definitely my go-to guy now, mostly for the convenience factor. His stuff is clean, verified by plenty of rolls and chem kits.

				Unless you buy a scale that is couple grand and up you won&#039;t get 100% accuracy.<br /><br />That scale is a steal for what it does.&nbsp; In other words it is very good for the price.&nbsp; It is accurate enough and the 1-5mg that is off could maybe fixed with a rubber mat under the scale and placing the pan and product in the pan as best you can.

				&quot;high content MDMA press&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NO... BUT I don&#039;t know what kind of sample you used ether just a chip, half a pill ect.. <br /><br />If you just used a small chunk it could be as high as 50/50 <br /><br />if you used half a pill I would say more like 25mdma 75 Bk-mdma<br /><br />if you used a whole pill more like 10 % mdma <br /><br />These are just GUESSES bases on chemistry and a working knowledge of the testing regents. Only a lab could tell you 100% but no one is going to send these off too a lab for $150 test so guesses are the best we have.. From what I could see on the Marquis photo it looked Yellow and Black with a slight tint of brown.. I have found that the brown is the yellow and the black mixing, that is just MY experience...IF the colors in the photo were off and there was orange in there then you have some Methamphetamine/Amphetamine in there I would guess speed its really common in presses <br /><br />&nbsp;BK-MDMA is not that bad.. a lot of people like it better, some hate it and others cant really tell the difference, but I chalk them up to not knowing what good MDMA is..LOL.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s more laidback then MDMA not as full of energy I think the best comment I ever heard on Bk-MDMA was&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot; BK-MDMA is like MDMA for adults&quot; I ROFL at that but in a way its sort of true.. MDMA tends to make you want to go dance and &quot;DO THINGS&quot; while BK-MDMA makes you want to cuddle and be with the person you are with <br /><br />If you still want to drop it. here is what I think.. <br /><br />If it was just the yellow and black then its a home or lowkey party type pill.. <br /><br />if it was yellow, black and a bit or orange then it might be okay for a concert or a short rave<br /><br />Expect the duration to be shorter then a pure MDMA pill you are looking at 3 to 4 hours..&nbsp; The comedown on Bk-MDMA is a LOT LESS then that of MDMA as it method of consumption for the chemicals in your brain is only 10% of what MDMA is.. Still eat well take B vits and pre and post with 5HTP

				I went back thru on my laptop (it has a better screen then the system I was on before) and had a look at the photos..<br /><br />That &quot;rust&quot; color as you call it is Orange its the Methamphatamine / Amphetamine I had said I thought could be there.. <br /><br />The Black is the MDMA<br /><br />The Yellow, being the bulk, is the BK-MDMA ( AKA Methalone / M1)<br /><br />The green Honestly as someone who has pressed pills before.. its SO tiny I want to say its the coloring from the pill (its a blue pill and you have yellow from the Bk-MDMA = green)&nbsp; BUT at the very worst is might be a tiny bit of 2C-b / DOB/DOI But I doubt it.. I REALLY doubt it. If someone was going to press a mixed pill of MDMA / BK-MDMA and and one of those others that I just listed off.. they would sell it for what it is NOT just a MDMA pill.. I would find it really hard to believe that they would toss anyone of those in there and not play it up... I mean even the Tri-forces that are going around have speed in them ( little bits of orange in the test like yours) and the sellers always play that up.. <br /><br />

Why does he have a press that is 50mg MDMA a THRESHOLD dose is 80mg ...50mg will do SHIT for anyone!! <br />and the MDA is&nbsp; between 100-150mg. For some the range can go down to 75mg, while others need upwards of 170mg<br /><br />you would have to pop 2 to 3 of these new ones he has put to be effective at all!

				P.S. does being &quot;blacklisted&quot; by him have any negative effect on future transactions i have on SR? My buyer stats are phenom. with the exception of two hurricane sandy related auto finalizes. I just dont want other vendors to see me on some vendor blacklist and refuse my business&nbsp; :-\

				Okay, just checking.. I have seen funny results from old test before and wanted to make sure...<br /><br />This guy is just trying to make a buck and cares nothing for product or customers...<br /><br />You may want to start a warning thread and post in the MDMA avengers thread too<br /><br />We all need to stick together and help each other to keep this place safe as well as each other!<br /><br />-P.L.U.R......

				the first one looks like a cathinone for sure... used to see alot <br />of bunk molly that would test like that... and that was usually how it tested <br />yellow-sort of green to a brownish black. looks like u got methylone or bath salts as some would say..<br />they actually arent that bad. more of a speedy amphetamine type of roll i would say. <br />sucks that u got sold it in place of molly cause they def. are not the same.

				Just wanted to say thank you to everyone that provided support and feedback. UNCLESAMSSSTASH is no longer selling pills on SR...only to people that are willing to do business outside of SR according to his vendor page. Got a message from someone thanking me for posting my test results and it helped him find a legit, more reputable seller. <br /><br />Much love and good karma to all<br /><br />- b3tterliving.
