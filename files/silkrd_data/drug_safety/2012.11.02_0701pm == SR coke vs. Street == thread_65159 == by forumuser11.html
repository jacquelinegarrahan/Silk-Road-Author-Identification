				hello all - hope everyone is looking forward to their weekends.&nbsp; just wanted to put a question out to my fellow SR users..<br />i&#039;m wondering about SR coke vs. Street coke.&nbsp; Obviously, i&#039;m aware there is a wide variation in quality.. but having said that<br /><br />locally it costs $80 for a gram of OK coke on the street.&nbsp; this quantity would range form 0.8g to 1.0g.&nbsp; sometimes the quality is OK, sometimes, not so good.<br />on SR, coke costs $110-130.&nbsp; i can&#039;t say i&#039;ve ever done &quot;quality coke&quot;.. but there has been a time or two where i would say the effects were much better than the aforementioned OK coke<br /><br />for arguments sake, lets say that SR&#039;s coke is 100% uncut, while the street is 50% cut.&nbsp; i would have to buy twice as much street coke ($160) to compare to SR coke ($110).<br /><br />if the above were true, than SR coke makes sense.&nbsp; thoughts?

				i believe the average street purity of coke these days runs between 15 and 30%. by the time it gets to a street-level dealer, it has been stepped on 3-5 times, at least.

				The only way to get answers to this is by letting the drugs get tested in labs.<br />Not sure if they have those in all countries though.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to help out. Except coke is too expensive for me to just send to a lab.<br />

				for any one else wondering this same question for whatever reason ;). Previously had C from a vendor who is no longer active a while back, also had local 40 gs nd £80 gs. the £40 is what you expect and does the job for &#039;few times a year&#039; users...most likely due to all the cuts i imagine haha, but defiantly has some C in it, at a wild guess i would say 5-10%. The 80 gs are at least twices as good, AT LEAST. So based on the 40 g %&#039;s, say the 80 gs are around 20-35%. (don&#039;t take these %&#039;s as actually %s, i&#039;m using them for examples to simplify)<br /><br />Now....this stuff I had from the vendor compared to &#039;street&#039; or local supply was minimum 3 if not 4 times as good as the 80 gs...maybe i was lucky with that particular vendor, i cant say for sure as i have not tried any other vendors that are active now days.<br /><br />To answer your question as basic as i can......sr USED to be at least 3x&#039;s better then decent quality street stuff in my opinion and i am fairly confident i had REASONABLE quality (if possible in this country) local supply compared to 80% of the total shit that goes around.

				Just wondering: since turning coke into basecoke which dissolves the crap as far as I know, isnt this a possible technique to use to see the difference in pure coke in a product?

				I&#039;ve sampled some of my friend&#039;s street stuff (he pays ~50/g) and it sucks balls compared to the gram I got from SR which cost ~100.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s safe to say that even the &quot;average quality&quot; coke on here is better than street shit.&nbsp; Most of it anyway.&nbsp; You&#039;re obviously paying out the gills but I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth it for some good quality.

				ok so I sell here and this is not a plug but the cocaine I sell, even though pricey, is straight from the brick and tested for potency. I am a cocaine user and can easily do an entire evening on .3 or .5 of a gram. I remember when I was buying coke on the street I would be able to snort a g in 30 minutes. Now I know better and it doesn&#039;t take a lot of high quality coke to keep me going for a long time.<br /><br />I guess the answer to your question is you get what you pay for and sometimes less is more. :)<br /><br />If you do the maths the expensive stuff actually works out cheaper as it lasts longer and it&#039;s a thousand times more pleasant. <br /><br />having said that you seem to be from the other side of the pond so you should be able to get high quality gear where you are.<br /><br />ah and forget about 100% pure, first nobody will ever be able to provide that as it doesn&#039;t come pure from source, second at that level of strength it&#039;s not actually pleasant unless you control yourself and do minuscule lines (5-8mg). Even the product I sell which is not 100% but it&#039;s high in cocaine content will make you feel uncomfortable if you over did it. imagine if it was 100%.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.. or pennies ;)<br /><br />LB<br /><br />

				In my experience, the coke I have gotten off of SR is waaaaay better then what I can get locally.&nbsp; It&#039;s kinda hit or miss on here, I really think that I have just been lucky.&nbsp; The one vendor that stands out on SR so far, is lexq.&nbsp; His stuff was so good for IV.<br /><br />Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.
