				&nbsp;I wan&#039;t it to measure powders and crystals (separately). Lets say I already know summary weight and want to divide it to get right dose. SWIM suggested to use matches, but I still don&#039;t know.

				Disolve your crystals in a liquid that will disolve whatever substance it is you have. Not everything is solouble in water, you may need to use a solution of propelyn glycol or ethanol. It will just depend on the substance at hand. Research what liquid will disolve your drugs and how much liquid will be needed. Many drugs will disolve easily in water though.<br />Then you can just use an oral syring to measure your drugs suspended in solution. For example: if you wanted to measure out 100MG of drugs and you disolved 500MG of drugs in 10ML of water, you would need to measure out 2ML of solution using your oral syringe. 50MG per ML.

				If you have a known starting weight the best way to do it sans-scale is with liquid as sickboy mentioned. Another technique is to powder all of it to a very dusty texture and make equal looking piles on grid paper, but this is much less accurate. You should always use a scale though because unless you weighed it yourself you will not know for certain exactly how much starting material you have, vendors sometimes give extra and with some drugs a few mg extra is too much. With other drugs it is less important though, I never use a scale to measure ketamine because I don&#039;t care if I am off by 100 MG.

				Dude, just take the hit and buy the scales. You won&#039;t regret it. Get some decent ones, the myweigh 0.01-300g palm scale is a beast.

				say i want to divide 5 grams into single grams i just make a line 10 inches long as even as possible and then use a ruler and divide it up by every 2 inches. not perfect but close enough. if its for personal use it doesn&#039;t have to be perfect down to the milligram.

				just buy scales, seriously, depending on what drug your taking it can be very dumb to eye out a dose<br /><br />http://www.dealextreme.com/p/digital-precision-scale-20g-max-0-001g-resolution-10515&nbsp; &nbsp;- clearweb<br /><br />these mg scales (0.001g) are only a little over $20, i have these exact ones, they are awesome

				DO NOT go by volume (&#039;match head).<br /><br />Like brockeh said you should buy a scale (however, I am very sickened by the analytical balances in the drug scene, many of they are garbage, you spend $30 you get what you pay for, garbage :) ).<br /><br />Otherwise you&#039;ll have to do it volumentrically (adding powder to liquid), but that still requires you measure a known quantity, it&#039;s purpose is more so to make it possible to split up doses into quantities that your scale cant measure (eg. your scale can measure 10g easily, dissolve that into 10ml of solvent and you have APPROXIMATELY 1g/ml.&nbsp; If your scale can only accurately measure 10g you&#039;ve likely weighed out 10.34 or something).<br /><br />Honestly though don&#039;t do it volumetrically or by eye (please don&#039;t eyeball drugs, please).&nbsp; The only practical purpose for volumetric dosing is if you already have an accurate scale and you just want to split a quantity into several doses.<br /><br />Don&#039;t EYEBALL, PLEASE !!! NO MATCHES !!!!
