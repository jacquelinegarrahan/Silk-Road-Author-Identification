				I snorted around 70mg of Ice last night between 7-8 pm. <br />I then did another 10 mg at about 4am. Before the redose was feeling pretty wrecked but wouldn&#039;t describe it as horrible etc<br />I took a couple of Xanax and slept for 2.5 hours but now I&#039;ve woken up at 10 am feeling pretty awake. Not hungry at the moment. I need to work at 8am tomorrow (22hours from now). <br />Have I crashed yet? Will I be able to sleep tonight?<br />I forced myself to eat a banana before I fell asleep. <br /><br />This was the 2nd time using the drug. The first 18 months ago when I smoked it with a friend before clubbing. The high was much more intense smoking. I don&#039;t have any desire to take it for at least 6 months and I used it all anyway. <br /><br />Cheers

				Only used it a few times myself, but 150mg will keep me awake for 2-3 days<br /><br />Try tire yourself out and get to bed a little earlier depending how tired you feel late arvo? <br /><br />Otherwise get more and stay awake tonight, work tomorrow - you&#039;ll definitely crash tomorrow night for sure.

				You should be good in a bit. 70mgs isn&#039;t too much to be worried about.<br /><br />Personally, my favorite benzo is klonopin since it kicks relatively fast and has a long halflife (duration) so you can sleep after taking stimulants. I would suggest you try this instead of Xanax sometime since Xanax has such a short halflife.
