				Hi, I just had a question about the difference between speed (Amphetamine sulfate) and prescription adderall? I&#039;ve taken adderall (ir and xr) many times but never ordered any speed before. My questions go as far as difference in doses, difference in high, why the price is so different, etc.? It makes much more sense to me to just buy speed instead of addies. Can you put speed into capsules and take them like you would an adderall? any and all information would be awesome thanks guys

				Well, there is not really a lot of difference, besides these:<br />Adderall has websites which will show you exactly what is in them (fillers etc).<br />It is both d/l amphetamines (unlike dexies/dexedrine/dexamphetamine).<br /><br />Most speed on the road is so sad I could start crying now and never stop.<br />First you think you order 10grams, but then it&#039;s wet and after drying you have 5grams.<br />Then you might think you have 5 grams of amphetamine. While in fact you can have: caffein, taurine, lactose, rat poison and many other very fucked up things.<br /><br />As far as I know they do not prescribe adderall here. That would also not make very much sense to me. Why take levo-amph? It&#039;s the dex that helps for ad(h)d...<br /><br />Oh maybe it&#039;s because if you know how to extract the dex out of dexies you can make meth :p<br /><br />If you ever buy speed. Ask around, or me, which are the good vendors. And learn how to wash it to get rid of all unwanted materials...<br /><br />Good luck!
