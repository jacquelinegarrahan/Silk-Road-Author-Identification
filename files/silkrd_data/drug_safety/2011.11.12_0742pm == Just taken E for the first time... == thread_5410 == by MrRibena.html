				I just got home, I ended up doing another half at about 11pm and my friend who I told I was doing it to even got involved and had half with me - he had never done ANYTHING before, hell he hadnt even smoked a cigarette before! He is a convert and we had the most amazing night. Wow. I am totally blown away by this. Im probably older than the average experimenter (nearly 30) but I am so, so glad I have taken E. This has changed my nights out no end. Just WOW.......<br /><br />I can get used to the chewing I guess, even now at 4.20am I am grinding my teeth. Im going to go enjoy the comedown with my mate. AMAZING AMAZING EXPERIENCE!

				Glad you had fun. Just remember it is not physically addictive but you can want the feeling again. You have wait at least a month before you roll again. I go for even longer than that with a few months in between.<br /><br /><br />You are definitely right about it changing you. It changed me for the better. You should take it at a club or in that kind of environment. The music and lights are fun. As for the grinding there are ways to reduce it, look it up (magnesium). Chew some gum too. <br /><br />What seller did you buy from?

				It took me years to find an actual MDMA pill, so many duds and crap RC&#039;s in most Aussie pills but when I did it was amazing and definitely worth the wait. Molly is my favorite drug by far.<br /><br />If your stuff is clean then the come down is pretty harmless but a Klonopin or Xanax can definitely smooth it out.

				Yeah definitely, I&#039;ve never taken MDMA without 5-htp the following morning and I&#039;ve never really experienced serotonin depletion. I usually feel great the next day but I guess I owe that to the 5-htp.

				I was a little jittery this morning but thats probably because of the alcohol I drank last night. No unusual side effects really. After a night out drinking I always feel like that.<br /><br />I took a valium to relax a little and feel great now. Appetite is back to normal, had a nice fresh lemonade and will soon smoke a joint and watch The Wire all day :)<br /><br />These pills were the powerbutton/q-dance pills from schizofreen. I had ordered from DQB but like most peoples they didnt arrive. As soon as some coins hit my SR account I am getting some more in for sure.<br /><br />Still buzzing at just how good it was last night. I literally felt like I owned the place when I walked in and was working the room (it was a friends birthday party to start with) like a boss.

				Are you in the US? I&#039;m debating on whether or not trying from schizofreen. It would only be 3 bitcoins after all.
