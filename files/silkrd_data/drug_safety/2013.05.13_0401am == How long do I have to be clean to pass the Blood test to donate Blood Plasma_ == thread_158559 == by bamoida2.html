				I&#039;m considering to start donating Plasma about 4 times a month for some extra money, as have too much freetime anway <br />But a bloodiest must be done before every donation, and I&#039;d&nbsp; just like to know how many hours/days before blood it a certain substance would still be &#039;safe&#039; to consume(meaning 99%+ of drug tests should would return a negative result if a normal amount would at the this very last&nbsp; &#039;safe&#039; timing).&nbsp; Ofc I understand that that will vary depending various on physical and environmental factors, and also on how, how much of, and how often is the drug used. I&#039;m around 180cm/male/75kg and I&#039;d like to find out a good &#039;safe&#039; estimate for those drugs: Meth(snorted/iv; 30-120mg/day; 2-5 days/month), Amphetamine(snorted;50-200(pure)mg/d;(2-8d/))&nbsp; Weed(rar to medium smoker; 2-5g/month)<br /><br /><br />

				They can tell even after 6 months that you have used THC (weed or hash).<br />I am no doctor but this six months period in your blood I do know for a fact.<br />Not sure but think as follows;<br />they will accept your blood most likely even after 2 or 3 weeks after use.<br /><br />It should difference if they find THC or Heroin, because you could have used a dirty needle and to show if you are HIV positive ( the incubation time) takes a while.<br />They will refuse your blood if heroin is found, most likely.<br />But I am talking from my own common sense perspective.<br />You should wait for or write to a doctor here on the forum.<br /><br />Yes we have those profi&#039;s among us.<br /><br />I think they use a spectrograph to see if there are spikes of substances that should not be there.<br />If blood looks like blood and has no alien ingredients, they want to pay for it&nbsp;
