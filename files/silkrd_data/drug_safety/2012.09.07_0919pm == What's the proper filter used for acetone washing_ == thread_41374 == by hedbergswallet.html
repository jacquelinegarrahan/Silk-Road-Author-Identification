				Whenever I read the instructions for giving MDMA an acetone wash it is strongly suggested to use a “medium flow filter paper,” such as used in chemical tests, not, say, coffee filters.&nbsp; But specifically how many microns is the medium flow filter paper supposed to be? I see lab grade sizes from 2 microns up to 15 microns. Which is best for this purpose? It’s confusing because I get results for coffee filters anywhere from 10 to 20 microns and 10 to 11 is usually the default medium flow filter found online, so... am I aiming for 4 to 6 microns?<br /><br />Any experienced advice given would be greatly appreciated.

				Coffey filters and even paper towels have always worked quite adequate for all the various meth washed Ive done. So long as the acetone was cold and dry. Oh and if you per-moisten the filter with whatever solvent your using, less of your material wil get absorbed into the paper.<br />If you&#039;re&nbsp; really anal ( which a high grade chemster should ) and have the $ sure get fucking sh-rkskin,- angelhair -reverse -osmosis-whatever filters. But sometime u just gots to improvise.

				It doesn&#039;t matter very much which type of filter you use. Something like a coffee filter will do fine at stopping large particles from getting though.<br /><br />Filters are sometimes used to separate solutes depending on size, and in that case the properties do matter. If the goal is to filter out particles that do no dissolve at all, most filters will work fine. For convenience sake i&#039;d suggest using a coffee filter, but there is no reason to assume a well folded piece of kitchen roll would perform worse.

				filters arent even necessary...&nbsp; you can just let the insoluble chem settle to the bottom of a shot glass with the acetone in it, then draw the acetone off the top (leaving a small amount in the bottom as to not pull off the chem). refill with fresh acetone, repeat a few times... then the last time just dump the small remaining amount of acetone out onto a glass surface to evaporate which will leave the cleaner chem (dmt, mescaline, coke, mdma, etc)<br /><br />just make sure you dry the acetone with epsom salt that was baked at 450 for an hour, dump a bunch in the acetone then let settle and pull the clean acetone off the top to use<br /><br />
