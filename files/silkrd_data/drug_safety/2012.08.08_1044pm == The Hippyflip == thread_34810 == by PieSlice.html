				In two weekends I am going on a camping trip with a few friends and I plan on the good ole&#039; hippyflip. I personally plan on taking 140mg of Ivory&#039;s MDMA, and at T-0:30 taking 3g of Rocker&#039;s mushrooms, and finally at T-1:00 an 80mg booster of MDMA. Having done this before (not with as high quality of gear), I was set into outer space so I can only imagine where I&#039;ll be then. This is definitely my favorite combination out of everything, but I was curious as to how everyone else doses/times their MDMA and mushrooms? I have heard of people taking the mushrooms BEFORE the MDMA, but I always enjoyed how MDMA smooths the come-up and alleviates the anxiety associated with mushrooms.

				I personally cannot ingest ANYTHING when I&#039;m rolling so I would do the shrooms first. Also since the shrooms last longer it just seems to make more sense to take the shrooms then at T+ 40 drop 120 mg of MDMA.<br /><br /><br />I also don&#039;t think redosing mdma at an hour really does anything since you&#039;re body can only utilize so many of its receptors at one time. Redosing MDMA makes more sense to me at the 2+3 hour mark when the mdma is being metabolized and removed.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in seeing what others think though.

				IMO you should always take the psychedelic before the ecstasy.&nbsp; i would say eat the mushrooms and then pop the molly as soon as you start to feel the shrooms.&nbsp; this will synergize into a really nice trip because any uneasiness you might feel with the shrooms is very soon alleviated by bliss.&nbsp; plus, you&#039;ll peak on both at about the same time this way and really be able to blast off.<br /><br />you want the experience to be mushroom dominant, ecstasy minor.&nbsp; the other way around is kind of silly unless you&#039;re one of those people who takes psychedelics just to see pretty colors

				Yeah I def would take the mdma about 1-1.5 hours into the psilocybin. You might get a little bit of the uncomfies from the shrooms but the mdma would cure that right up. I like to feel the psychedelic first, then the euphoria, and then a mixture of the 2 for the rest of the night.

				I&#039;ve hippy flipped once and the instructions myself and my friends got were to take the E only after the shrooms had started to kick in. From then on it worked as the name implies.

				I just did this combo a few days ago. Since I worked hard the last few years, I quit my job June 1st and have been on a great drug binge ever since (although I gotta start looking for new job soon or I won&#039;t have money for more drugs!). My conclusions on hippyflipping are as follows:<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter what you take first, it just matters how much of each you take. There is a sweet spot balance wherein both drugs form a synergistic high. If you don&#039;t find this sweet spot, one or the other usually takes over. I like to drink a few grams of so of some mush tea first, and then dose 100 mg MDMA while the shrooms peak starts about an hour or two after dosing. Then, a couple hours later I take another 50-80 mg of MDMA depending on how i&#039;m feeling. My usual concern is that I love the first half of a shroom trip and the unbridled thoughts I gain from it. However, the downward comedown sometimes creeps me out a bit, and that is when I want the MDMA to take the reigns of the trip. Of course you can always just drink a six pack on the comedown instead. <br /><br />Anyway, have a great trip man!
