				Plugging is my favorite ROA. Snorting is fine, it hits faster but has a much shorter duration.... plus it tastes like sniffing salt so there&#039;s that.<br /><br />Plugging has a higher bio-availability, gets into the system nice and fast, by-passes stomach contents so it works even if you just had a big meal, lasts about as long as oral, you use less to get the same high and it helps mitigate issues with people that sometimes get nauseous off eating MDMA. <br /><br />Downside of course is you now have to put the drugs in your ass...<br /><br />You get used to it pretty quick though and the high comes on so fast you&#039;ll probably be happy before you even take the plunger out a few minutes later.<br /><br />If you always take it on an empty stomach and have a endless supply, the high isn&#039;t really any different than eating the stuff. If you&#039;re on a budget or want to take it after a big meal though hard to beat a little booty bump to get the drugs in you fast.

				Well, first off i wouldn&#039;t swallow the crystal raw, capsulate that shit! I generally don&#039;t sniff or plug mdma, although I&#039;ve heard good things about plugging.. Maybe I&#039;ll try it next time. If I want extra kick, or if I&#039;m going out to a rave or someplace where I&#039;ll need energy then I&#039;ll often supplement my roll with some intra-nasal M1.. but snorting mdma seems unnecessary imo

				I always just weigh the crystals out, put them into capsules and swallow them. I don&#039;t find that snorting gives me as good of an experience.

				hmm... it seems the general consensus is snort = no-no. <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in the plugging makes what you&#039;ve got go a bit further, not really a concern for me though. <br /><br />As far as swallowing the shards, they&#039;re really not that sharp. Doesn&#039;t feel uncomfortable or anything. <br /><br />I have to say though, it tastes absolutely wrank. Like, super-bitter seaweed. lol<br />So yeah, empty gel caps are the way forward methinks. <br /><br />Thanks for all the input so far guys, very interesting.

I dissolve it first so my stomach doesn&#039;t have to go through any trouble breaking it down before it gets in me. No proof one way or another but I normally take a Tums a few minutes before an oral dose since I heard way back when that it helps with the absorption by cutting down stomach acids that otherwise degrade the MDMA. Doesn&#039;t cost anything to take a Tum&#039;s really so I figure why not?

				A few of my friends have snorted MDMA on occasion and I&#039;ve been told how much it burns so I&#039;ve always stayed away from it. I always wrap it in a rizla and bomb it!
