				Ive been taking adderall and/or some high grade AMP recently, on and off with short breaks (1 or 2 days off) for about the last 2 months at a pretty low dose 10-40mg per day.. I took a 2 day break and thought I would be fine with that like I normally am and just pretty sleepy...<br /><br />Well what started about 24 hours after my last dose was a mild headache but most noticeably lots of stress or like pressure feeling in my Jaw and particularly my face and forehead. Almost feels like muscle spasms or tension in my forehead and Jaw muscles that was starting to drive me nuts! So I took my normal adderall rx and it goes away... Next day same thing happened but now its worse and only subsides when I take a slightly higher dose of AMP...<br /><br />I really want to take my normal breaks but its a REALLY uncomfortable feeling of tightening. Ive heard of Amphetamine causing teeth grinding and tighten muscles, headaches etc... but Ive always heard that was a side effect for some and only while on AMP. This to me seems to be a kind of withdrawal symptom though, cause it gets worse the less AMP I take. <br /><br />Has anyone experienced anything similar? Im trying to figure if its the AMP or maybe something else Im taking alongside it...

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s withdrawal.&nbsp; That&#039;s certainly never happened to me, at least; keep in mind amphetamine is actually a bit of a pain killer itself -- it may be covering things up.&nbsp; And everybody&#039;s different, you never know.&nbsp; I mean it&#039;s possible that you have withdrawal symptoms nobody else has ever had.&nbsp; Granted, it&#039;s ridiculously unlikely, but anything&#039;s possible.

				Thanks, I realize that with the Amp ive also been taking about 1mg nightly of Xanex before bed for last 2 months and realized that on the days I dont take any Amp I have no need for the xanex to sleep... Starting to think it could be muscle tension from not taking the xanex...

				Be careful. I found that amphetamine comedowns are really hard on some people.<br /><br />One night I took 60mg adderall XR, crushing the beads, mixing it with hot water, and heating it up, and drinking the solution.<br /><br />For the first 2 hours I felt an ecstasy like euphoria, but with more energy.<br /><br />For the next 3 hours I felt insanely tweaky, and kept running around the house checking simple details over and over again.<br /><br />The last 3 hours things went wayyy downhill. I felt that jaw feeling that you had, then it turned to me getting numb and almost passing out. I felt that weird feeling you got in your jaw and your forehead all over my body and it was almost traumatic, I could of had easily blacked out.<br /><br /><br />Be careful, with a little more amp you could easily go through what I went through.<br />

				Yeah, originally I got a little quality AMP to substitute my adderall dose. But just cant seem to find the correct dose where I feel normal or like im on adderall... I wake up with a headache from not taking much the night before, so I dose tiny 10mg and dose nothing, so I redose... nothing... and redose and then finally take 5mg after many hours and start to think my stuff is bunk and all a sudden its the sweats and uncomfortable &quot;too many cups o coffee feeling&quot;. I cant seem to find the middle ground like I do with adderall. Im measuring with an accurate MG scale and allowing at least an hour between doses so who the hell knows... not looking for a party dose, just need a little extra energy to make it through a full day&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Is there anyone using AMP (no Meth) fairly regularly? If so whats a proper dosing schedule and amount to keep levels low and even through 12 hour day? I cant even find a clear answer on Amp sulphate&#039;s half life... some say 6 hours others say 24 hours wtf&nbsp; ???

				I&#039;m using amp salts, vyvance, and addys (alting between each regularly) around 4-5 days a week. I&#039;m taking a beta-blocker, an anti-depressant, and xanax daily also--I don&#039;t know that that matters, but I just thought it might be relevant as far as symptoms are concerned.
