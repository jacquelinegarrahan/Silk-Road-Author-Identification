				Title: <strong>2c-b use</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				So being experienced with psychedelics and a variety of stimulants I wanted to try something new and got myself some 2c-b.<br /><br />I understand it&#039;s best off the back of some MDMA - taken about 90 minutes after the MDMA peak.<br /><br />I was thinking about trying out 20mg orally. Is this a good place to start?<br /><br />What dose snorted up the nose would give the same effects as 20mg taken orally?<br /><br />What are the general effects if you re-dose on 2c-b?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What can I expect from taking 2c-b on its own?

				I would say for the first time 20mg would be a good starting point so you can get the feel for it then next time I would increase it to 25-30mg plus it depends on the quality of the 2C-B that you got. Some people say that snorting it double&#039;s the effect I personally think it makes it stronger but the pain of snorting it is not worth it by any means save your nose and take it orally you will thank me for this trust me, and re-dosing isn&#039;t bad you will obtain the same effects just prolonged. 2C-B on it&#039;s own is wonderful I love it and take it along quite often (2-4 times a month) just take a little bit of a higher dose :) have fun!

				Thanks! On its own 2c-b takes about 90 minutes to fully kick in right?<br /><br />Say i took 20mg and was having a good time and wanted to re-dose, what effect does the time-frame of the initial dose have on subsequent doses? Is there anything important/significant that I should know? Should I reduce the amount that I re-dose with? <br />

				I just took MDMA &amp; 2C-B together for the first time last night. A batch came through from Ivory and hell it was amazing. The MDMA blew my mind off, I took it about 10:30pm and came down around 2:30am then I took 50mg of 2C-B (yes I know that&#039;s a huge dose but I seem to enjoy to taking a lot). <br /><br />It takes an hour to kick in but wahey I was buzzing off my face, the visuals and insights were amazing and I was more chatty than on the MDMA, but still completely mentally in control unlike LSD or mushrooms. I then took another 50mg for some stupid reason about 4:30 and had a whole another trip which was really cool. It seems to level out like you can&#039;t overdose and is a very balanced trip (no up down up down like MDMA, just up all the time). <br /><br />My partner who wasn&#039;t taking anything and said she had some great conversations with me, and I seem to remember everything. It also had the effect of me being able to go to work at 7:30am the next day after only 3 hours sleep and feeling fine, no MDMA comedown, which a few people have reported 2C-B seems to do. <br /><br />One thing I will advise is that with the trippy visuals whilst I could walk around, go to the toilet and make drinks etc etc I couldn&#039;t even find the button to turn off my TV even though I was looking straight at it (small objects are hard to focus on), whilst objects far away such as tree&#039;s seem really sharp and clear. So I wouldn&#039;t advise driving etc after it. Even with the huge dose I had no full blown hallucinations like some people report. I loved it though, had no negative thoughts at all and felt great. It would be a great anti-depressant in small doses twice a week.<br /><br />One tip I found is that my partner cut me up half a fresh orange in the early hours of the morning which I ate, and I came back down to earth in 10 mins, high to sober, enough to drive etc so if you need to come down quick and nicely, that&#039;s the way to do it. No idea why it works, as I was drinking orange juice all night which did nothing, but the fresh orange was like BOOM back to earth.

If you re-dosed it would take another hour and a half to kick in and by that time your other dose will be starting to be gone that&#039;s why I usually snort it when I just need a little bit more altho it does burn it&#039;s not as bad as snorting a whole 20mg dose, and if you took let&#039;s say 20mg and felt like you needed more I would snort 5mg extra at the 2hour mark and you should feel that within 5min repeat as desired keep the snorting to a minimum tho.

It&#039;s like LSD yet still being in control.

				There are definite physical and mental effects to a decent (say 18-32mg) dose of 2c-b. Honestly, 2c-b is one of the least visually awesome compounds, in my opinion. I think the magic of 2c-b lies in its physical effects (euphoria, amazing body buzz) and mental effects (a remarkably profound, yet still lucid head space ESPECIALLY piggybacking on MDx compounds). Its visually interesting, but in my opinion once you pass 30 mg the visuals get gross, splotchy, and runny. But again that&#039;s just my opinion. If I wanted a visually interesting 2c-x, I&#039;d definitely choose two or three others before B. But I find 2c-b the most mentally useful (and fun ;)) of the family!

				it&#039;s a great combo. i&#039;d suggest taking the 2cb 3-4 hours after the MDMA, as it seems to bring back some of the MDMA feelings, and i would stick with oral dosing for both. this combo is synergistic, so your normal dose of 2cb will feel stronger than normal. 20mg should be good though. you can get some really amazing OEV visuals with this combo, really great fun. i think the visuals are amplified when a serotonin releaser is introduced, since i had pretty amazing visuals when taking 2cb on the comedown of methylone as well. they have a few threads on bluelight about the mdma/2cb combo, i&#039;d read them as well, since there&#039;s a lot more info.
