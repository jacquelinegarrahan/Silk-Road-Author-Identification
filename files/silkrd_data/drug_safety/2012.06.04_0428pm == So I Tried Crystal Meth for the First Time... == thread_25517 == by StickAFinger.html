				Did my research (on top quality vendors) and bought .5 grams of some ridiculous shards of glass. FE and got a nice bump up in amount (thx!)<br /><br />Done adderal alot through college and I have done coke plenty, too much in fact. being in the finance industry it becomes a staple in ritual (bags in peoples desk draws, like, in every fucking draw, 10am-2pm staircase bumps, chopstick lines after work) anyways one could say I have a high tolerance, ive had plenty of times where people yelp &quot;holy fuck i cant believe you just ripped that&quot; or &quot;OH...MY..GOD r u serious1?!?!&quot; and even &quot;Bro! for the love of god stop fucking my mom!&quot;<br /><br />sorry... anyways<br /><br />So i crushed the fucking shit out of this meth, razor&#039;ed it up, measured off my scale and ripped it.<br /><br />Burn was sensational, like, so acute, but enjoyable since it barely lasted. I waited about 10-15minutes and didnt really feel anything...so i ripped another 50mg maybe? i dont know, all i know is i did that two more times and i was FUCKED. The rush to the side of my head was pretty cool, <br /><br />But i was not, not functional fucked, but super functional fucked, and this shit lasted WAY TO FUCKING LONG. i started this at 10am, to try and offset insomnia and tweaking shit and i was riding waves of energy till 6pm<br /><br />i could go on on the pleasurable part, but fuck that...i just wanted to try it though and jesus christ, the after effects fucking blows, granted I did a bunch, but i wanted to go big and I feel it was a great amount to get absolutely ripped on. I also had sex with this fuck buddy of mine and she noticed a positive difference, i was horny as fuck and SHOT LOADS that night, which was a bonus. On coke my dick is more useless than a broken condom.<br /><br />but then i didnt sleep for 2 days, maybe an hour at best total, I kept up with my nutrition and water and key supplements but this shit was a monster and made a solid dent in my state of norm. like the second day had a insane drop in mood for a good 2 hours, was gonna take a xanax but I had to golf and thought that would fuck with my game. (if my buddies only knew I ripped meth the day before like a creep....looking back i shouldve done it the day of golfed, damn)<br /><br />Turns ourtI ripped a solid 250mg -375mg in the span of an hour or two, but honestly, i had tolerance.&nbsp; Had alot left and I was going to do it again.. and i said fuck that noise. sold it to an old highschool football hero that is a trainwreck. He can make better use of it.<br /><br />not knocking on the drug. i love testing shit, if anything dabbing like a pencap amount would be amazing for a demanding work&nbsp; day, this shit runs circles around coke. But this takes a toll on the body, Having done a decent amount, and going through the motions, I can&#039;t fathom people doing this on the reg. To those who do, i wish you the best, and hope you play safe. but this shit is straight up cray-cray <br /><br />no but seriously, meth is a hilariously crazy fucking drug, and had to try it because of that. Having done it I can say if you are not a strong willed person, a spineless pussy if you will, well so long, this drug will take you by your little balls. Do i recommend people to try it? not really, but if your like me and like testing a drug, yeah sure, but i can see (i guess, not really) how some people become Gollum from lord of the rings on this shit, which is stupid. <br /><br />tits.&nbsp;

I mean I have never tried it personally and I wouldn&#039;t but it is one of the more dangerous drugs.<br /><br />Regarding Ketamine, I love it and I think everyone should try it once. It&#039;s a very varied drug because it&#039;s effects shift with the amount you do and what you combine it with. I like it on its own or combining it with Bing, MDMA or Mepherone or sometimes all of them at the same time. :)

When they do it it just makes me think &quot;And you are bragging about that? Not sleeping for x-amount of days because you are on Meth makes you the biggest tool in the world&quot;. Personally I have gone for 4 days straight on Mephedrone and Coke before but I had just split up from my ex and I was just looking to escape. Wasn&#039;t proud of it though, certainly don&#039;t brag about it. Felt like I wanted to die by the end of it.

				yeah, im not even sure if im going to tell anyone about this! Hopefully months from now or something it can come up organically in a conversation hahaha<br />seriously dude, i mean, i fucking did a shit load of crystal meth man! hahah what a crazy sentence to come out of my mouth!<br /><br />so fucking crazy. but yeah, i guess the &quot;addiction&quot; part is off set at how fucking miserable the come down and shit is. I have come to the conclusion that this drug is mathematically pointless in ever way possible, except to the seller of course. I am so happy I hit the purchase on a .5gram and not done my typical over the top move and go with 2.5 or something, who knows how much i would have done or whatever. <br /><br />Ill just stick to my basics (with a good diet and physical activity ofcourse):<br />the occasional pain killer, though i have an unreal tolerance of it, and that is not from habitual use at all<br />Xanax<br />Whiskey <br />Weed <br />Coke (though it has sucked for years in Eastern US)<br />Pussy <br />Macaroni &amp; Cheese (sometimes with&nbsp; hot sauce)<br />Molly <br />Mushrooms<br />Tits<br />Opium Tea (literally just got a new bag today actually from the awesome Austrian Vendor AlterEgo, amazing shipping!)<br />Porn<br />Pokemon Cards&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />jk about the porn<br />&nbsp;8)

				hahaha, i really enjoyed reading the original post.&nbsp; everything you say is dead on.<br /><br />i was an adderall addict for a couple years before getting into meth...i had fun with it, but you can only do it a few times before it completely pwns the shit out of you in every way.<br /><br />it won&#039;t hurt to do it once, true, but if you find yourself dreaming about it or thinking about the next time you&#039;ll do it when you should be working or socializing.....thats a pretty good sign that you should never do meth again.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you got to have sex on meth, though; one of the best fuck drugs.&nbsp; too bad you didn&#039;t get the chance to get in a fight with someone...thats like the next best thing to sex on meth.&nbsp; not that i usually condone violence, but some people deserve to get their asses kicked and if you&#039;re tweakin balls off some glass, you might was well be the guy who does it since you&#039;re already dancing with the devil.

				I had a... period... once, where I experimented with meth. Two and a half months of 3-4 days up smoking and driving around and drawing (sometimes only 2 days) and 1 day to rest in between (sometimes 2). I served as a delivery boy, and everyone I delivered to shared out of appreciation. Never paid a dime for, never would, never will. When I stopped, it was suddenly and for good. Slept a little extra the following few weeks.<br /><br />It made me focused. Confident. Drew some cool shit. Enjoyed experimenting with sleep deprivation. Had hallucinations from it just once, after coming down from 4 or 5 days up (longest I went).<br /><br />I never noticed any issue with my ability to function so long as I took a few puffs every 3-8 hours. Everyone around me (all surprisingly good at hiding their habit) remarked that they couldn&#039;t tell when I&#039;d been up 3 days. But of course, I used to stay up for 2-3 days on willpower when I was a kid, so meth just made it easy.<br /><br />Anyway, so far the impression I&#039;m giving seems to be too positive, so I leave you with a quote. It&#039;s the reason when I spent every day reaffirming my independence of the drug.<br />&quot;I know I should stop buying meth. I could be a lot more comfortable if I did. But I&#039;m not going to, because I like it. So be careful.&quot; - A friend who had been smoking meth over 12 years.<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t take it if you have an addictive personality.

				thanks for your input neuro. Sounds like you really had a solid dive into the meth experience,<br /><br />I didnt really dive into the pleasurable aspects and chose so because the following overpowering negative:<br />Severe comedown (if you dont re-up..something that chose to not do)<br />and the biggest reason of all that has, in and of itself, a plethora of additional problems<br />sleep deprivation<br /><br />I am now just starting to even out from the harsh comedown from my massive amount of snorting (from what i read, i think i did 3x-5x&nbsp; the normal amount....BAD ASSSS)&nbsp; <br /><br />I think where I was, at that moment, with the amount i still had left, I was at the cusp of where addicts begin. And I saw that tipping point and realized, its just not fun. There is no real social factor, glamor, or anything i found viable in my life. I did say it ran circles around coke..but in retrospect, the comedown and metabolic breakdown of cocaine runs circles around meth.<br /><br />All in all, its cool that I tried it, but FUCK bro, this shit is junk. <br />.

Just waiting for my dopamine levels to come back to normal so I can do something else id rather enjoy...thank you for the crazy ass killer combo story though, cheers

				LOL Very nice read. Meth isnt for everyone, As for me. i prefer to smoke it. I actually kinda like the taste, but i hate the feeling of burning, so i dont snort the stuff.<br /><br />And as for you golfing on meth, HAH! ITS LOADS OF FUN, and its such a game changer to.<br /><br />A family member owns a golf course in the NW of the US, an once me an a buddy hit up the driving range, all torqued out of our minds on meth. We hit balls for at least 8 hours, once we came down, and re-evaluated what we did haha, being an outside part watching us, i would have thought something was up immediately. We were just all over the fucking place hahaha

				well AncientX....<br /><br />you are the first person I +1 ( Lost my Karma card today! ...that sounds gay but you get the point)<br /><br /><br />HILARIOUS that you guys golfed for 8 hours ripped on meth. hahahahha<br /><br />I pretty much leveled out yesterday from all the damage...ive asked and read around and pretty much as i said before..i ripped a shit ton of meth...like, its hitting me now how unnecessarily large of an amount i did. And its making me think well..fuck it...buy another small back and take a bump or two and thats it.....ugh .....uh oh...that doesnt sound good! hahahha jk jk<br /><br />not really gonna do it. I just ordered some coke to make up for my meth-avaganza (just coined that term! DONT STEAL IT WITHOUT GIVING ME RESPECT)<br /><br />I hope its goood, havent done it in a while actually. (any suggestions for other coke dudes?..not a big deal if no one answers, dont do it much..have too much tolerance)<br /><br />having a meth buddy or two must be utter insanity. Again, so much responsibility has to be put on this. to me, the sleep deprivation is what ruins it all...alot

				XD hahaha, ya whats funny is, i ordered some coke, the same time as this bag of meth. I know your not suppose to mix them, but my tongue is on a frenzy attacking my teeth while im all ripped. And i&#039;ve been doing very tiny little specs of Cocaine, about the size of&nbsp; cake sprinkle, and numbing my tongue&nbsp; lol. Its an intense feeling to say the least.<br /><br />But yea man, most sports like golf, Paintballing, and a few others are pretty intense on meth.<br /><br />Speaking of which....im kind of coming down a little, i think its time to make a hasty retreat to my meth dungeon ( aka my room ) and spark up that oil burner once more XD <br />And as for doing meth again bro, Doing it once or twice, wont get you hard up addicted, just use good judgement, and always do small doses with drugs you don&#039;t have alot of experience in. With meth, a little goes a VERY long way<br />

				It just depends on how much you take... If you&#039;ve never done it, or are just a newbie to it, i&#039;d reccomend just smoking a tiny tiny shard and see how you feel, chances are you&#039;ll be high for a few hours, and then comedown for a few hours, sleep, and then you&#039;d be okay by monday.

				<br />i put the sleep deprivation under the category of comedown. its harsh man. idk. <br /><br />got a gram of coke from a vendor, tried it over the weekend, ripped 2 fat lines, was torqued but nothing crazy, comedown was competley controllable, as i kept myself busy with shit through out the day/night<br /><br />now having both fresh in my mind...(literally and figuratively) meth, is in its own class of TORQUED. <br /><br />actually after doing coke again, im kinda bored of it, and so...i guess both are retired. i have no fucking idea what drug i like anymore hahaha

				My first time with Meth was memorable. <br /><br />At my first rave, circa 1995, I was just starting to come down from some pretty great REAL first time MDMA, when some dude asked me if I wanted to buy some &quot;JiB&quot;. At the time, I was a strung out / naive 15 year old desperate to get high again, and I proceeded to consume approximately 4 points of meth orally. After the rave, we walked out into the sunrise, and everyone I was with (except me) who had come down from the MDMA was tired and wanted to go to sleep. I was literally cleaning trash from the streets of downtown Toronto, asking why we &quot;can&#039;t stay longer and party&quot;. After admitting to everyone that I had taken a large amount of crystal meth on a whim, they kind of angrily understood (meth wasn&#039;t such a social stigma in &#039;95) and&nbsp; we set off driving to our destination in a friends car. On route to our destination, I mistook the sky for hudson bay (extremely far from Toronto). Upon arrival, I listened to several remixes of Alpha Team&#039;s Speed Racer remix on repeat for hours, while chain smoking in the basement of some random dude&#039;s (who had punched numerous holes in his room door with a baseball bat) parent&#039;s house. <br /><br />Fun times for all
