				So, I&#039;ll preface this with a little background on meâ€“ I&#039;m incredibly socially anxious and have been prescribed benzos for it. However, Ativan did absolutely nothing for me, and Xanax only makes me sleepy about 2 hours in, but doesn&#039;t qualm my anxiety.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m not attention deficit but caffeine soothes me- likely due to an addiction. I used to spend about as much on caffeine as a pack-a-day smoker does on cigs. At a doctors advice I stopped taking any caffeine for three weeks, though now I&#039;ve started drinking it every once in a while.<br /><br />Anyways, after drinking a nice, large iced morning coffee, I decided to take 1mg of Xanax for my anxiety; even though I never felt it did much. Within roughly an hour, the combination hit me. I suddenly felt relaxed to the utmost degree, but not sedated; I could keep my focus perfectly, and had no anxiety while communicating with people. It felt very euphoric and peaceful (not to the extent of, say, MDMA, but in a subtle, relaxing way), especially when I got a chance to lie down. Muscle aches and pains went away entirely.<br /><br />Four hours later, I decided to take a second 1mg dose, this time ingesting an 8 oz Red Bull and 16 oz Monster. Laid down on the bed and began to feel absolutely fantastic; the caffeine kept me from falling asleep yet the Xanax kept me in a state of bliss.<br /><br />I&#039;d highly recommend it!

				I would not recommend this to everyone, but there certainly is merit to the combination. <br /><br />As I understand you have been a heavy caffeine user for a long time. Many people are used to a decent dose of caffeine though, even if its just 3 mugs of regular coffee in the morning, it is definitely a stimulant you depend on. Personally i drink about 3 mugs in the morning normally, and i get nasty headaches and such when i don&#039;t do so (traveling, no time for coffee, run for the airplane - you get the picture). <br /><br />Studies have shown that caffeine can actually increase feelings of anxiety, though it would be hard to tell if that is a factor if you are already used to taking caffeine in large amounts as a part of daily life. <br /><br />From personal experience i&#039;d certainly say that a small (0.5-1mg) dose of xanax can still be effective if you also drink a few mugs of coffee. The idea of downing a xanax with coffee seems very paradoxical to me too, but i&#039;ve found little downside in doing so. When you flip things around you could say that the coffee mitigates the hypnotic effect of the xanax, while leaving most of its anxiolytic function intact. <br /><br />I have never tried large dosages though, and despite i have pure caffeine and alprazolam powder available, i don&#039;t think it would be a very safe idea to take very large dosages of them combined. <br />

				Your feeling good because your speedballing.&nbsp; Any downer and an upper mixed is speedballing.&nbsp; You feeling not too sedated while awake but very relaxed(of course with coke and heroin or other potent drugs you feel extremely euphoric as well) is exactly what speed balling is about.

				That sounds a bit excessive since its not that hard to purchase both xanax and ritalin, even from the same vendor in one go :D<br /><br />I suppose coffee and xaxax could be considered to be a mild form of speedballing indeed. But by those criteria an irish coffee after dinner would be too ;)

				I&#039;m the kind of person who&#039;s too pretentious to take the menial bullshit of desk job work, though I&#039;m pushing through it until hopefully I can get to a financially stable place where I can work on my other passions (namely music) without fear of bankruptcy.<br /><br />Anyways, I decided to down a Monster Rehab Tea + Lemonade 23 ounce (244 mg caffeine) with 2 mg of Xanax. Normally 2mg would knock me straight out but the caffeine kept me moving- and when I started feeling a bit tired ~45minutes in I added a Mocha Lite frappucino (80mg caffeine) and was back to my blissful state.<br /><br />It feels absolutely fantastic. As a socially anxious individual those feelings all but evaporated, I found it far easier to talk with my superiors for assignments; I wasn&#039;t drowsy at all, and able to extremely focus on the work I had to get done. Anxiety is a big inhibitor for me (when I&#039;m doing stupid low-level filing shit I feel it&#039;s pointless, and my anxiety tells me that it&#039;s not worth the effort) but with this Caffeine + Xanax combination it was easy to push through the menial work without any problems. I felt very relaxed yet attentative enough to keep focused on my work.

				If you are into caffeine that much i would suggest getting it in powder form - its not very expensive at all. <br /><br />I found the nicest way of taking it is actually adding it to filter coffee. Just drop the desired amount in with the coffee as brew it as you&nbsp; normally would. Caffeine dissolves quite well in hot water, so it will end up in the brew. Obviously you could also just weigh it out and stir it into a hot cup of java. <br /><br />You will taste little to nothing off the added caffeine in coffee since its already bitter and has some caffeine to begin with. I find this preferable over taking things like energy drinks that usually contain a shitload of sugar and odd additives. <br /><br />Considering that i could be an interesting idea to put xanax into your coffee brew, though i find the taste of xanax to be more foul than that of caffeine. Both are bitter to the taste, but xanax bitter taste tends to linger longer somehow

				<br />Funny, I just did this before a wedding after-party tonight. Woke up from a nap and going to something I didn&#039;t want to go to. I was pissy. I took .5 Xanax and 200mg caffeine. Was great-I didn&#039;t want to leave the party but had to go do something else at a certain time.
