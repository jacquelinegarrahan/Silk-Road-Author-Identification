				i dont want to get into my whole back story on this but im looking to mix:<br /><br />- 1g joint of sativa dominant hybrid medical weed<br />- .5mg of xanax<br />- 100mg viagra<br /><br />first off... is it safe? has anyone done it that is reading this? would you recommend changing any doses? and is there an order to which each drug should be taken? <br /><br />i&#039;m probably going to try it regardless... sounds like an awesome mix to me!<br /><br />+1 for good information ; )

				Pot is practically no threat, xanax is practically no threat, and viagra will raise your blood pressure among other things.<br />No, I see no problem with this mixture, at all.<br /><br />It is good to be cautious. If you were thinking of mixing heroin, xanax, meth, alcohol, musrooms, and viagra, I might caution you though. ;)

				This mixture although safe enough does not appeal to me. Sounds like it would just end up with either a rock on that you don&#039;t notice or a night whiled away masturbating like a spazticated monkey for hours on end. Unless that&#039;s what your after of course, each to their own and all that lol. But yeah it should be fine.

				It doesn&#039;t seem overly dangerous at all.. but i wonder why you would take the xanax before having sex. Having some pot and viagra i get, but wouldn&#039;t it be preferable to take a downer after you are done having your bedroom fun? <br /><br />Not that 0.5 mg of xanax would pose a problem performing, but somehow it seems nicer to have a drink. cig and benzo after the act.

				I wouldn&#039;t if I were you, all 3 of those can lower your blood pressure. Contrary to what others said, viagra is a vasodialator that will lower your BP and is well known to cause headaches and nasal congestion. 100mg is a lot of V to start of with too.

Clearly you have built a tolerance to, at least, the hypnotic effects of xanax, and it will not affect you severely.<br /><br />That said, i&#039;d still consider taking the xanax as late as possible, if possible after performing any task that requires your full attention - no matter if that is driving or messing around under the sheets. The only reason to take it before would be social anxiety experienced with this partner. <br />

				WTF?<br /><br />Never read the original post, just saw weed, xanax and viagra and was going to say - not a great idea really.<br /><br />Also -&nbsp; let the women arouse you - let is happen naturally - because if you get a 3 hr boner and don&#039;t really like here, you&#039;ll end up intimate and sometimes, that artifical hard on might mislead a women, she may think you like her. <br /><br />I&#039;d stick with the weed. If she is a stoner, great, but if not, eat two grams of hash before the date - if she is going to be your women she needs to see you the way you really are&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I would never dismiss a non toking lady - in fact, drugs is a side-show, getting laid is the main event.<br /><br />Main worry is usually premature ejaculation.<br /><br />Take a tramadol - you&#039;ll be arriving a lot later, trust me!<br /><br />And if she smokes - build up a rocket and take her to the moon.<br /><br />Grab your chance - nicely! Don&#039;t read poems, just swoop for a kiss at the right moment. If she objects, be cool, roll another joint, assure he she can get a taxi when she is ready. Put some music on. Swoop again! Gently, but let her know you fancy her, even if she objects. Its not your fault you want to get it on with her. <br /><br />Not your fault you got a natural boner.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />But, as ever, its down to the women. No means no - unfortunate but thats life for the average bro.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)
