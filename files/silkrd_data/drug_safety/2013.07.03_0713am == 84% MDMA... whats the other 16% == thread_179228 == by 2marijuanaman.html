				It&#039;s because if you wanted *only* the MDMA molecule, you&#039;d be dealing with an oil &amp; not a very friendly one. MDMA is liquid as a freebase &amp; has a pH of a little over 10 (base = alkaline), so it&#039;s somewhere between baking soda &amp; ammonia on the scale of things fun to ingest.&nbsp; Because it&#039;s more user-friendly as a solid, it&#039;s generally converted into its hydrochloride salt form - which if you do the molar calculations gives you 84% MDMA and 16% HCl.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t like the 84%&nbsp; description, though. Even though 16% of the molecule is a salt, and not MDMA, it&#039;s still &quot;pure&quot; - the HCl is part of the drug &amp; not a cut. If you want to think of it another way, imagine crack and cocaine. Cocaine in a powder form is a salt, typically cocaine HCl; its freebase (&quot;pure&quot;) form, without the salt, is crack.&nbsp; Calling crystalline MDMA 84% pure makes as much sense as complaining that your 100% pure cocaine HCl wasn&#039;t really &quot;pure&quot; because it hadn&#039;t been converted into its freebase. .&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;It would be more accurate if those selling 84% MDMA just called it 100% (or 99.5% or whatever they&#039;re able to get) pure MDMA HCl, but now there&#039;s this *thing* users have about 84% being the &quot;maximum purity&quot; of MDMA in its crystalline form, so people keep using it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe that was more than you wanted to know? The tl;dr is that crystalline MDMA is actually MDMA HCl, and 16% of the mass of the MDMA HCl molecule is HCl. <br />

				Thanks all, but the pleasure (satisfaction?) is mine -&nbsp; the 84% thing drives me nuts &amp; the more people know what it means the better the chances it&#039;ll stop being used. <br /><br />Better to know you&#039;re getting 99.5% MDMA HCl than 84% MDMA anyway - in theory 84% MDMA could mean someone handing you a vial of caustic oil cut with some other liquid. (I kinda love the idea of people being dicks about it, too - &quot;You say it&#039;s 84% pure? Okay. I&#039;ll take it. But that other 16% had better be a hydrochloride salt...&quot;)&nbsp; <br /><br />And cat - I&#039;m not a dude, but happy to take the compliment anyway. :)

I completely agree, and I actually myself used the same reference to cocaine. It&#039;s a foolish standard, but it has become the market norm. I believe it is just a gimmick for distributors to show their customers that they are &quot;honest&quot; about the purity of their product. Another funny thing I&#039;ve seen is that a large percentage (~30%) of the X in the Netherlands is cut with 16% sodium sulfate (the cutting agent of choice, apparently). Perhaps this has something to do with it (a way for distributors to get away with slightly more weight sold), but I am not sure. Either way, I agree with you. MDMA needs to be a normal drug and go back to the 0-100% standard.

				I, too, have always wondered. But since no one posted any higher purities, I assumed it was something like a salt made up the rest. Thanks for the info.

				If you need 16% HCl to have a salt-kind of MDMA, <br />how come people have written that you can &quot;clean&quot; your MDMA and get more than 84% but still have something that you can ingest (snort, parachute, ...). <br /><br />Is that just BS, or can you actually go over 84%MDMA and under 16% HCl? <br />Also, are those % in mol, in volume or in weight? <br /><br />Thanks for the good and instructive answers

				P2P - That makes sense. I think it looks more shady, tho, as it confuses the question of legitimate purity. (Like Jack said, it&#039;s totally possible to clean up even quality MDMA - anhydrous acetone washes aren&#039;t too difficult to pull off. Altho Jack you&#039;re not necessary getting 100% MDMA HCl at that point - acetone won&#039;t wash out any amphetamines nor many research chems. :) )<br /><br />RaFaeL5 - The molar mass of MDMA is 193.3 g/mol, and the molar mass of HCl is 36.5 g/mol. So any MDMA HCl molecule will have a molar mass of 229.8 g/mol, 84% of which will be MDMA - it&#039;s just another way of saying you have 100% pure MDMA HCl. The chemical properties of MDMA mean that &quot;cleaning&quot; the HCl from your MDMA salt would mean you&#039;d end up with freebase oil. <br /><br /><br /><br />One thing I didn&#039;t write earlier is that there are other MDMA salts, each w a different MDMA-to-acid ratio. MDMA bromide salts aren&#039;t uncommon. MDMA phosphate salts are another option, tho I&#039;m not sure what the ratio would be. (Phosphate anions can exist in more than one ionization form, so you they could create more than one MDMA salt form.)<br /><br />Honestly I can&#039;t think of many reasons why someone outside a lab would care at all about the molecular ratios that make up a given drug compound. If you know what the salt is, knowing the ratio is just a matter of doing the math, and it makes way more sense to say &quot;100% pure MDMA dihydrogen phosphate&quot; than &quot;67% pure MDMA&quot; (the molar mass of dihydrogen phosphate is ~95 g/mol, so an MDMA dihydrogen phosphate molecule is 67% MDMA and 33% dihydrogen phosphate). Just because a dihydrogen phosphate molecule has a greater molar mass than a hydrogen chloride molecule doesn&#039;t mean make MDMA HCl is more pure - one is just pure MDMA H2P04 and the other pure MDMA HCl. All is does is confuse the difference between the molecular structure of a substance and whether or not that substance is mechanically (not chemically) mixed up with other cuts. <br /><br />Or wait. Maybe there is one way the 84% description is useful. Anyone who tells you they have 84% pure MDMA? You can be 100% certain they did not make it themselves. ;)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
