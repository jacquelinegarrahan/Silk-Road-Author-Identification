				Hey all!<br /><br />There&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;d take LSD, Shrooms or similar at a party (hell, I&#039;d be very unlikely to take them in any public scenario).<br /><br />I&#039;m curious, what are the best party psychedelics? Drugs that give you similar visual sensations to true psychedelics, yet don&#039;t fuck with your head too much. Drugs that make you feel the music more, etc.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of (which I haven&#039;t tried) is 2C-B. Is this true? What else is there?

				AMT seems like it could be a good social psychedelic at medium doses, it&#039;s sometimes pressed in pills and sold as ecstasy, like 2C-B.

Even at low doses I was way too out of it to party, at moderate doses I had no idea what was going on, and at higher doses I didn&#039;t recognize anything around me. It sounds like a great way to wander off into dark alleyways after hitting the club.

				Most of the 2C&#039;s&nbsp; such as: 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-E I find are great party enhancers. <br /><br />MDMA and MDA are another two good psychedelic party drugs. I haven&#039;t taken them together though and don&#039;t plan on it. <br /><br />I also find some of the 25x-NBOMe series good for partying as well.&nbsp; Mostly 25i and 25b are great for partying and feeling the music more.&nbsp; <br /><br />Actually low doses of LSD I find are great for party enhancers. <br /><br />LSD to me is an experience that tailors itself to the user. Therefore I feel once I&#039;m past my peak I can do anything I desire on it and and I&#039;ll feel awesome!

				@Everyone regarding X/MDMA.. yes I&#039;ve tried it many times and yes I&#039;ve loved it ;p I&#039;ve just never really considered it a psychedelic; it just raises my mood to a great place. I&#039;d love for something with more in the visual department.

				2CB is actually quite popular as a party drug in my town, so I&#039;d go with that one.<br />Unless, of course, you consider MDMA a psychedelic, but I don&#039;t want to get into that debate lol

				In no particular order:<br /><br />- LSD...though I needed to have many trips under my belt before I could handle LSD in any social situation. Now it&#039;s my favourite party drug. Definitely don&#039;t recommend it to people who are not experienced with psychedelics.<br />- MDMA<br />- MDMA + LSD<br />- Ketamine

				what&#039;s the level of &quot;mindfuck&quot; on a drug like mescaline? I&#039;m interested because I&#039;ve only had experience with LSD and tryptamines, and while both are enjoyable, i feel like they &quot;force&quot; thoughts on you, rather than let just giving you the tools for self exploration on your own. I would absolutely love a psychedelic that just gives you a crystal clear and peaceful mindstate, where you are in control of the experience. I really hate how LSD and Shrooms tend to mess with my head and give me some bizarre delusions, and I was hoping that Mescaline would be a more &quot;controllable&quot; psychedelic

				Damn, this sounds exactly like my ideal psychedelic. MDMA was the closest I ever got to a drug I could use for relatively accurate self reflection, but all the unwanted stimulant effects ruined it for me.<br />Mescaline sounds like my perfect drug lol.

				Gammagoblin has about the best prices for mesc on the road.&nbsp; When he freshly stocks it he usually only charges $80/g.&nbsp; It sucks that it&#039;s so expensive, but it is the cadillac of psychedelics.<br /><br />Low dose 60-100 of LSD does the trick for me in social situations wthout &quot;forcing weird thoughts&quot; from my head.&nbsp; At that dose, with my tolerance, it&#039;s just like talking to people while enjoying the rush.<br /><br />Learning some good meditation techniques can help a LOT with the mind games you play on yourself while tripping.&nbsp; All those weird thoughts are not coming from the LSD, it&#039;s potentiating them, but those thoughts are your mind.&nbsp; These thoughts, conscious and subconscious, bubble to the surface after LSD removes the filters we use to keep our world straight and easy.<br /><br />Folks here that take higher doses are usually pretty chill, and have strong enough minds to handle it.&nbsp; You do see the occasional dumbass that takes heroic doses of any random drug just to be &quot;that guy.&quot;&nbsp; I call it the Steve-O drug experience.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t prepared and educated yourself you can end up pretty messed by going too hard core too early.&nbsp; Never go full retard.

				I&#039;m with you, I like going out among people while on psychedelics.&nbsp; But its hard to find something that&#039;s just right.&nbsp; <br /><br />LSD is a great social drug, if everybody else is on acid, too.&nbsp; Otherwise nobody will talk to you.&nbsp; Well, the etards will talk to you, but it&#039;ll be like talking to someone from the slow-motion planet.&nbsp; Which is funny and all. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had good luck with low doses of acid along with something to warm it up a little, like MDMA or opiates.&nbsp; For example, half tab of acid and 5mg of oxycodone. <br /><br />I think what we are looking for is MDA or an MDMA/2CB combo.&nbsp; Both are on my list to try. <br /><br />

				I would recommend checking out the nbomes. I have tried 25i and 25b and personally I would lean towards 25i for a party because I feel very social, euphoric, and energetic and music is bliss on it. The nbomes are essentially analogues of the 2c series (e.g. 2c-i was converted to 25i-nBome). They are newish but quite affordable, and still legal in some countries.<br /><br />Also I would think you could combine ghb with psychedelics to make the experience more social but experiment carefully.

				Regarding the nbome&#039;s, how&#039;s the body load?&nbsp; 2ci was stimulating and all, but it tended to make people feel gross and that took a lot of the fun away.&nbsp; By &quot;gross&quot; I meant irritable, dysphoric and nauseated.&nbsp; It does have really fantastic visuals which occur at a low enough dose that you can still talk to people, but after the newness of that wears off, you&#039;re left with a drug that is, quite frankly, rather unpleasant.

				Just wanted to pop in and say that I&#039;ve read/heard some good things about 5-meo-mipt being a nice party drug :)<br />Ballzinator would be able to give some further info on that, I&#039;m sure.<br /><br />Much love!
