				Yup, its that time. I always promised my mom when i was younger that i wouldnt get into anything besides weed, but i know im responsible enough. Weed just hasnt been cutting it lately, and im not very fond of the effects anymore. I am currently trying to lose weight, and weed makes me hungry and lazy (even when its a sativa). My tolerance is also sky high as ive been doing a ton of dabs lately. Ive been trying to dab myself into somewhat of a spiritual experience, but thats not working. So I decided to research psychedelics. I only have a few problems. My grandmother&nbsp; and uncle (who killed himself) suffered from schizophrenia, and is the only one in the family as far as I know, so i probably carry the gene. However, I have been evaluated for it and no signs. Ive smoked A TON of weed, and never once have I felt schitzo. So my question for you SRers is: Should I venture into the world of psychedelics? or is it too risky? And if i should, what drugs would you recommend starting with? I am also currently on a small dose of an SSRI, 10 mg a day. But I plan on getting off that soon and starting acupuncture.

				OK I&#039;ll try to address some of this, with a disclaimer that i fucking love psychedelics and they caused what some people call a ruined life for me, though I disagree and fuck them. <br />Psychedelics are in no way a replacement for weed. Weed is your everyday/weekend whatever relaxer. Personally I would say psychedelics are at most once a week probably less long term. Maybe a lot more short term. I think you know that but how you phrased your question it had to be said. Some people don&#039;t handle psychedelics well, so tripping with experienced people that you are very close with is my strong recommendation. As far as what to start with, people have wonderful first trips on most all of them. I think shrooms have the capacity to take you much deeper into your own mind than most, and tend to be fairly unpredictable. The most important factors going into a trip are where you are in your head, where you are located(somewhere familiar? somewhere new with strangers? uh oh!), and who you are with. Now, I have had some pretty sobering thoughts about myself while tripping that are far from happy but I think it is worth it, and I can&#039;t say I have ever had a trip I would call bad out of hundreds, though lot&#039;s of scary moments.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you&#039;re talking stimulants as in meth, I can&#039;t talk from experience as I have only dabbled but it seems like you are thinking of going pretty hard right off the bat. All I have to say is if your goal is just to lose weight and not to be high as shit all the time that isn&#039;t a healthy way to go about it. <br /><br />Now maybe I&#039;m way off base here but I think before you ever touch meth/other you should practice being sober. I&#039;m definitely high all the time as well but being sober for a period of time is just another chance to look at your life from another perspective very similar to drugs I think... Also to drop weed for a week or something is a fucking cakewalk and if you aren&#039;t at a point you can do that maybe you should think twice.<br /><br />I&#039;m really sorry if I come off as condescending, I&#039;m just telling you what I would tell myself!<br /><br />Also-- new post while I was typing, a half bag? Are you kidding me? Half of whatever bag he is handed? Anyway if you go the mushroom route it depends how much on a lot of factors, I&#039;d let others test them first to tell you a good dose, if that isn&#039;t possible I&#039;d just do a 1/16 first time.<br /><br />Edit- to not be rude. I have a dirty mouth.

				Whatever you decide to try, make sure you get it from a reputable source and start at low doses.<br /><br />Also, re the SSRI thing, if you were to try, say, MDMA (kinda my specialty) then yeah, you&#039;d want to be 100% off that stuff. Some traditional psychadelics you&#039;ll be fine with though.<br /><br />Oh, also, if you&#039;re on the SSRI for depression, try taking high-dose 5-HTP when you&#039;re off it, again it&#039;s something not to mix with a lot of other drugs if you take it same-day, but if you&#039;re anything like me it&#039;ll help you immeasurably.

				The advice in here is...troubling.<br /><br />Your family has a history of mental disorders.&nbsp; Psychedelics bring out mental disorders.&nbsp; If it is a borderline case and your brain was health before, psychedelic use will make this FAR FAR worse.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do it man; a psychedelic high is not worth being half crazy the rest of your life.<br /><br />Also; why are you on an SSRI?&nbsp; You should probably get off that ASAP, even if you aren&#039;t taking a psychedelic afterwards.

				Acupuncture...?&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; &nbsp;Why does it seem like it&#039;s always the psychedelic crowd that talks about these things?&nbsp; Yes, yes, go ahead and click discourage... it is a weird trend I&#039;ve noticed though.

				SSRi -s fuck&nbsp; your serotonin system up. stop using them. (Don&#039;t if its for severe depression and suicidal thoughts.) you will not be able to get high properly for months because of that shit. <br /><br />psychedelics are a no. if you think there is a chance it could bring out the hidden mental illness&nbsp; then its not worth the risk. <br />even if you don&#039;t get after effects the thought that you could go schizo for the rest of your life will ruin the trip! and you could end up doing damage to yourself or the people around you. <br /><br />stick to weed! smoke it&nbsp; only once ever week to keep&nbsp; tolerance in check. smoke as much as you can. smoke it till the point when you go &quot;oh my god i have done too much&quot;&nbsp; knock yourself out with weed. This way you can get strong spiritual experiences!<br /><br />stims? well MDMA will not work because of ssri. but Amphetamines should be fine. <br />do not snort or shoot or smoke. eat them. buy pharma grade dex amphetamine. its good shit. nice feeling and very good&nbsp; synergy with weed!<br />be careful with stimulant psychosis. don&#039;t stay up for days. don&#039;t forget to eat and drink. and don&#039;t push yourself too hard! keep addictions and craving in check. don&#039;t redose too much&nbsp; and if you feel you are developing dependence you should stop usage right away. <br /><br />hope i helped!<br />Peace

If you have a family history of mental disorder, already have problems with anxiety AND smoke weed on a regular basis, even though you don&#039;t like the effects, taking psychedelics is NOT recommendable (anxiety + psychedelics is very, very uncomfortable).<br /><br /><br />Stimulants are even worse, especially in combination with weed (anxiety, cause by weed + brain-overdrive and no sleep, cause by speed f.ex, is the perfect recipe for a paranoid psychotic episode).<br /><br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m not your mum, I can&#039;t tell you what to do, but if you chose to do it, BE CAREFUL!

				Well it is hard to imagine what I would do if I was faced with a dilemma such as yours, so I won&#039;t tell you whether to take it or not, but I will tell you this:<br /><br />Have a good long read through erowid experience reports. There are many people who have &#039;never been quite the same&#039; after just a single psychedelic experience.<br /><br />Please consult with your family and/or doctor about history of mental illness. The risks are real, and very serious.<br /><br />It took me several months to get over the depersonalisation from a single shattering psychedelic experience... and even afterwards, while tripping, I would be afraid of myself...<br /><br />The experience had the theme of murder, and I thought that by experiencing the feelings associated with murder, I would be desensitized to the act-- and end up killing someone. Many of my trips following this experience would leave me feeling like we had just murdered several sentinent lives, or that I myself was being hunted by an insane murder-- someone rooted deeper in insanity than myself.<br /><br />Eventually, I integrated the experience with my daily life... but during that time, I wasn&#039;t even able to smoke weed to calm my farm because it would cause sensual and mental flashbacks. Ironically, I am even more sensitive to violence than before but for a few months I felt like I had attained PTSD and that I could never return to the same level of sanity that I previously had.<br /><br />It is interesting though... because there are people who willingly injest extremely high dosages of psychedelics to give themselves what is medically characterized as a mental illness. Though if there is one lesson I&#039;ve learnt by pondering my sanity is that everyone is insane - NUTS... to varying degrees :)<br /><br />The risk is not just yours to take (think of your mother, for example) but the rewards are likewise there for everyone you come in contact with.

				Stimulants, just DONT . I took me 3 years of partying many, not every, weekends to get a psychotic episode. <br />I did alot of speed, smoked weed daily and would often take XTC. (once popped 25 120mg pills straight for 2 days)<br />After i &quot;recovered&quot; my cravings to get fucked returned, despite a healthy ammount fear.<br />I tried speed first, went ok, had a little paranoia after being awake 48 hours, but thats normal anyway. After i slept i felt fine, felt no change in my thinking. Still it will trigger paranoia and maybe it could trigger it bad with your genes<br />Cant do MDMA anymore, i&#039;m on effexor and solian, but i found an even better replacement. <br />I tried 2CB recently and its all good, lovely colours, breathing world, music sounds like an orgasm. Slept like a baby when i came down.<br />Actually felt energised and euphoric the day after. I got the giggles for a while but no runaway thoughts or deep realisations. Just fun gigles and visuals no mindfuck<br />This was at a 20mg dose, since then ive learned 25mg is the max before it also induces a mindtrip, so watch your dosage. 30mg had my tripping bad<br />Then there&#039;s weed, weed the devil, it wont bring back the voices, but it will make me extremely paranoid and anxious first two joints, after this it will get better. But when talking about mentally damaging weed feels by far the worst for me.<br />Its also a well known fact it induces scizophrenia . If your really worried about that, stop toking man. Sooner or later you&#039;ll be fucked
