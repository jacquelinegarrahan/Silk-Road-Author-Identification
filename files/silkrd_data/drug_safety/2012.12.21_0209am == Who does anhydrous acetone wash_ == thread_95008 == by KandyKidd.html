				I&#039;m curious as to just how many SR&#039;s MDMA users, actually do anhydrous acetone wash? I&#039;d like to know ur reasons for doing so. I&#039;d prolly try it eventually, when I&#039;ve more time in my hands, but would like to know what ya think.

				I wash every single batch I receive to remove any impurities that may have been leftover during synthesis. There is an excellent guide by paxpax that you can find here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45508<br /><br />Here is a vigorous wash of mine from a while back:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1006.msg484795#msg484795">Quote from: AnimusVox on September 25, 2012, 07:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So I&#039;m sure most of you have come across the infamous brown MDMA that Rainbow Vomit and Gelman offered a while back. You can find pictures of it here:<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=9d0ce66ccb996a225e7f13ae6974ff4a.jpg<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=50d944a1f44b855a5144c17e8fc33973.jpg<br /><br />I fortunately had the opportunity to grab a bit of it before they both disappeared, and decided to run a small experiment to see just how pure this MDMA was and threw 3g through a rigorous acetone wash. This took me a few weeks to complete (a wash here and there, as my schedule allowed and drying permitted), but I finally settled on finishing at the 6th wash. What I revealed was just as expected -- this MDMA is very pure. Of the 3g (3,004mg to be exact) I ran through the wash, I yielded a very pleasant 2,371mg of washed MDMA and the crystals that have come through are absolutely beautiful. Here is a picture:<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=14d495a436f63f7c0ecb7a98c3c3cd3d.jpg<br /><br />I have ran a few acetone washes before but this was the most surprising in the fact that the starting product was very tan, brown almost, and it yielded the most final product. I have ran very white/off-white crystal before only to be disappointed when 2g disappeared before my eyes into 700mg. This also reinforces the fact that color does not indicate purity! So while I&#039;m a little late to the party, if you happen to come across this fine product in your ventures, be sure to pick it up. This MDMA is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />This has been a public service announcement detailing how you should be sure to wash your MDMA! You&#039;ll be happy you did, kiddos. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yup, A wash is the way to go. pure MDMA is white any thing else is crap that you don&#039;t want, crush and grind your bulk MDMA , you can dry Epsom salts in the oven @ 400F for an hour or so on tin foil, then put in a sealed mason jar for later, do it out side on a dry day and wear a dust mask, powder from it will tear up your sinuses, been there done that. :o Dry glass ware in the oven at 150F and seal it, put about half an inch of dry Epsom salts in a QT mason jar and fill it 7/8 full with acetone seal it and shake it several times a day for several days, let it settle, you now have dry acetone. Place your ground up MDMA in the oven on a plate @ 150F and work it around to dry it, place it in a dry half pint mason jar and seal it, ANY moisture in this process will also be a loss of product! Do it on a dry day! Use a turkey baster with a plastic pipeit over the tip with the end of the bulb cut off, the type that you can purchase at a hobby store for fine glue jobs, with out disturbing the Epsom salts remove dry acetone with the turkey baster and place it in the jar with the MDMA, repeat several times till 1/2 pint jar is about 1/2- 2/3 full seal and shake, after settling hold jar 30deg. on side and tap on it to collect all product to one side of the bottom of the jar, place on flat surface and remove dirty acetone with turkey baster suck it dry on the clean side of the bottom, repeat process several times till the acetone wash is clear, dump wet MDMA out on dinner plate and spread out to dry. by doing it in this manner I have minimal exposure to moisture in the air and no loss in the filtering process.&nbsp; Expect 15-20%loss of product.&nbsp; 8)
