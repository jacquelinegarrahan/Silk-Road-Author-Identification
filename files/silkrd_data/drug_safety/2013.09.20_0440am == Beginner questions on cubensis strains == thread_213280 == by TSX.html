				Are these very different in effect? I suppose there are hundreds or thousands of substances in a mushroom, all contain psylocybin but the trip is affected by the combination of all these substances like it is with cannabis, am I right? This is just wild speculation.<br /><br />What strain would you recommend for a first time experience?<br />I would instinctively buy amazonian PES cubensis, I don&#039;t know why, it feels right. ;)<br />But I thought why not ask people with more knowledge.

				The quantitative ratio of the different substances should be roughly the same between species. It&#039;s the potency that varies.

				That means some contain more psylocybin per gram, but you could not differ the strains from the effect alone because it is the same?

				http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_info4.shtml<br />Turns out I was wrong :)<br />The quantitative ratios are not the same, so there could theoretically be slight differences in effects between strains.

				there seems to be slight differences between cubensis strains, but nothing comparable to the differences between cannabis strains. any strain of cube would be fine, though i would not recommend penis envy for your first time. :P

Penis Envy itself is very potent and I&#039;ve made the drastic mistake of giving 2 grams, what I would normally consider a standard dose, to beginners. Let&#039;s just say they ended up butt naked attacking a security guard. I had to personally call his mother to bail him out of jail.

				Thank you all for your helpful answers.<br />I guess &quot;penis envy&quot; is just the amazonian strain, called penis envy because of the look? Couldn&#039;t find anything about this &quot;slang&quot; name. ;)<br /><br />I wanted to take 2g also, but I&#039;ll start with 1g now.<br /><br />Mushroom strains != cannabis strains was the most important thing for me to know.

				Penis Envy is a Cubensis, not an Amazonian.

				All Cubensis are Cubensis and you won&#039;t find much different between their relative alkaloid ratios. Some cubensis may be more potent per gram, but the relative alkaloid content will be the same.<br /><br />Now, between different species of the genus Psilocybes IS where you will find differences in relative alkaloid content the way that you would among cannabis species. P. Cubensis (which includes most &quot;strains&quot; like PE, B+, amazonian, hawaiian, etc.) is only one of these species. <br />Other species lile P. cyanceans, P. semilanceata (liberty caps), P. mexicana, P. azureans, etc., will have different ratios of active alkaloids the way that cannabis does and vary in potency per gram.<br /><br />The active alkaloids responsible for the differences are of course psilocybin, psilocyn, and baeocystin.<br /><br />You can find some of these other species available on SR from time to time.<br />
