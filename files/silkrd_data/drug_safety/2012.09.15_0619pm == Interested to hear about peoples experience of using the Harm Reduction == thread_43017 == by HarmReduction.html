				As a biochemist i try to give people helpful hints on things like combinations of drugs that should be avoided and such. I have no idea to what degree people read those, take them seriously or act upon them. I just hope at least someone reads along and makes a choice for the better when available.<br /><br />I think just having a section that deals with adverse effects is already helpful though. Many drug related forums focus solely on the positive side of use, while we have a section here that is open to discuss downsides and dangers of virtually all substances. Since the SR community consists of recreational users, i think it gives a nicely balanced mix of feedback. Most other information on the web focuses on solely on the negative aspects, or consists of information promoting some substance.<br /><br />To me, SR seems like a fine community that offers a good mix of user experience, caution and encouragement,&nbsp; without overly focusing on one of these aspects

				Hi Ben thanks for the feed back do you think that because SR is off the open web that the information given is more precise and reliable and Novartis would appreciate your thoughts on this

				Yeah, everyone should read Ben&#039;s posts...<br /><br />The forum is pretty good, not as robust as something like drugs-forum.com which is full of actual experts (people in the medical field) pseudo-experts and regular users with an interest in being informed and safe.&nbsp; SR has a healthy mixture of that, its just smaller.

				I think the harm reduction here is great info for people who would otherwise just take &quot;their buddy&quot; or some guy off the street&#039;s advice.<br /><br />It seems to me that if people are going to take drugs, sometimes they prefer to look only at the good based on one or two sites or recommendations. It seems fairly easy to just do a regular internet search for a particular drug and find credible sources for info. Of course, there are some sites (like the government anti-drug sites) that only list broad problems that come from certain drugs and leave out WHICH combinations or dosages that are particularly likely to cause such effects).<br /><br />For example, the anti-drug information for testosterone and steroids in general tell you that you&#039;re going to kill yourself. But if you look at the manufacturer&#039;s page, web MD, epocrates, erowid, you find much more useful info such as a percentage liklihood of CVA etc that is 1% and water weight 15% or something like that. Same with benzo dosages or anything you can get from a pharmacy.... they&#039;ll tell you common, serious, rare, etc side effects.<br /><br />Everyone metabolizes drugs slightly different and may have preexisting conditions that can change how your body reacts (or fails) in response to certain drug dosages or combinations.... It just seems to me that if someone is smart enough to get on this site, then they should be smart enough to do a clearnet search and find credible sources beyond random forums.... like the sources mentioned in the above posts.

				This is why threads like this are important and I believe even as a worker in the field first hand experience and knowledge is often of more value . What I like about SR is that is seems to attract a different cohort of user compared to other sites and therefore the information seems to be more relevant especially around the research chemicals which are constantly evolving

				Threads with real world user experiences are valuable i think. <br /><br />Many other sources of information are coloured by their origin. The DEA would probably say that smoking one milligram of cannabis once will turn you into a zombie, while a pot growers forum may state that smoking an ounce a day is a healthy idea. <br /><br />SR forums are populated by vendors and buyers though, so there is more chance of coming to a real common sense advise fueled from both standpoints.

				As a biochemist i feel fine making such judgements on my own. The benefit or SR and its feedback system is that i know that i will get whatever substance i order. Many sellers here know what they are pushing, which is lot better then street dealers that hardly know if they are selling amphetamine or mdma as &#039;party pills&#039;... and that excludes whatever other substance is in their pills that defies identification even using proper lab equipment.

				&nbsp; I find that Bluelight is more about fads and how to optimally use certain substances, mainly benzos and opiates, although I guess that is what you get if you are looking for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Heroin seems to be the main focus of harm reduction, but there is no real safe way to tell someone how to do Heroin.&nbsp; I wish they would have like a buisness card-size drug size-o-meter where you could compare with some kind of picture or diagram how big 10mg, 20mg, 30mg, etc. is, so that it would be easier to eye stuff out.&nbsp; I know that in the US harm reduction is usually nonprofit NGOs catering to IDUs, without much social interaction, where in Canada they have a more hands-on approach, where they talk to people about what they&#039;re doing, whats going around on the street, etc.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I like about SR, I get feedback about all kinds of things from E pills to H to Coke or Psychs, so even if I do buy it on the street, most likely I&#039;ve seen something similar on here.&nbsp; I would like to see more of that in the US, the problem is that LE has driven all the junkies so far underground that I don&#039;t even think most would be willing to talk about it while they are using.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cops in some of the neighborhoods where drugs are sold in the open are really hostile they will kick your arse and throw you in a ditch, then threaten you with a 10yr charge.(in the US) Mass, Conn., NJ, NY are all really hostile when it comes to police, they drive everyone underground because people are scared shitless of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I blame street cops, not Detectives or Narc Squads for the majority of street deaths, they blame users for a problem that started in another country in a poppy field.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is why we need harm reduction so much for Heroin and Crack users who are homeless or score on the street, because LE is so bent on persecuting druggies.&nbsp; Distribution of Narcan(Naloxone) is a good idea, wouldve saved a few of my friends, its cheap, too.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen it being actively distributed outside of a few urban centers.&nbsp; When it comes to psychs, harm reduction is mostly about reducing the harm the user can do to themselves while high.&nbsp; For instance, I had a friend eat 10gm of dried cubensis mushrooms, I told him to stay home, what does he do? gets in a car and gets in trouble for interupting some strangers dinner, raving like a lunatic.&nbsp; People need safe places to do stuff like that, and good advice.&nbsp; THe places are lacking in the real world, unless you have your own spot, but advice on here is free and friendly! GGG!

				Its interesting that you have noticed this about Bluelight thats my impression as well , certainly here on SR I have seen alot more people talk about optimal dosing of other drugs , I have seen an increase of people talking about injecting I dont know if this new. I have a few mates who work in the US they share the same views alot of them run under ground needle exchanges and some if they are lucky carry Naloxone, I am finding that where as HR was always used around methadone and needle exchange finally people are getting the message that its on other drugs as well
