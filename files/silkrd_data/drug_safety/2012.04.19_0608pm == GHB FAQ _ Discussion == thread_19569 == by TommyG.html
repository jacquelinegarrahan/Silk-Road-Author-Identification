			<dd class="postbody">
				There is clearly a strong on growing interest in GHB here on SR.&nbsp; I have been sharing a draft of this FAQ with some customers and I am posting it here to improve access to it.&nbsp; My goal is to provide some basic information to the new user, and a forum for further discussion. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />WHAT IS GHB?<br />HOW DOES IT FEEL?<br />HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?<br />HOW MUCH SHOULD I TAKE?<br />WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN?<br /><br />WHAT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I TAKE?<br />HOW DOES FOOD IMPACT IT?<br />CAN I TAKE IT WITH ALCHOHOL? <br />WHAT IF SOMEONE OVERDOSES (FALLS ASLEEP) ON GHB?<br /><br />REALLY, HOW MUCH SHOULD I TAKE?&nbsp; <br />BASELINE CONCENTRATIONS FROM SOURCES<br /><br />IS GHB THE SAME AS XYREM? CAN I USE IT AS A REPLACEMENT?<br /><br />WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION?<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />GHB (Gamma Hydroxybuteric Acid) is a wonderful chemical with a few downsides.&nbsp; It effects are usually highly enjoyable.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, because of its narrow dosage curve and varying concentrations, overdoses&nbsp; are very common.&nbsp; While generally harmless, overdoses can be scary and no fun.&nbsp; This FAQ is provided to offer basic information to the new user.&nbsp; Some of the content is pulled directly or indirectly from EROWID and other reliable sources.&nbsp; It will not cover all aspects of the chemical, and I encourage people to do their own additional research.&nbsp; It will be updated over time.<br /><br />WHAT IS GHB?<br />GHB is naturally present in the human body.&nbsp; When present in high amounts, it temporarily inhibits the release of dopamine in the brain, causing euphoric effects.&nbsp; GHB also stimulates pituitary growth hormone (GH) release, hence its popularity in the body building community.&nbsp; GHB is used clinically to treat narcolepsy, is used as an aid to childbirth (in France), and to treat alcoholism.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT FEEL?<br />Most recreational users find that GHB induces a pleasant state of relaxation and tranquility. Frequent effects are placidity, sensuality, mild euphoria, and a tendency to verbalize. Anxieties and inhibitions tend to dissolve into a feeling of emotional warmth, wellbeing, and pleasant drowsiness. Higher levels feature greater giddiness, silliness, and interference with mobility and verbal coherence, and maybe even dizziness. Even higher doses usually induce sleep.&nbsp; There is minimal “come down” or after-effects.<br /><br />HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?<br />Onset : 10 - 20 minutes<br />Duration : ~1 hour, up to 3 hours<br />Normal After Effects : 2 - 4 hours<br /><br />HOW MUCH SHOULD I TAKE?:<br />A “typical” dose for a pleasant and fun evening is 2 - 3g.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, dosage varies greatly from person to person, and concentrations of liquid GHB can vary significantly.&nbsp; &nbsp;SMALL INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT INGESTED LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION OF THE EFFECT.&nbsp; I recommend starting with 2g or less and working from there by adding (or decreasing) ¼ - ½ gram.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is worth the time to figure out personally how much is a light buzz, how much is a strong buzz, and how much is too much for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oral GHB Dosages:<br />Light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.5 - 1.5 g&nbsp; (some relaxation)<br />Common&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 - 2.5 g&nbsp; (relaxation, mild euphoria)<br />Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - 4.0 g (heavy relaxation, strong euphoria, potential dizziness)<br />Can Induce Heavy Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5 – 5+ g<br /><br />Liquid GHB can come in widely varying concentrations – from almost 2 grams per ml to ½ g per ml or less.&nbsp; It is important to talk to your vendor about the strength of your GHB.&nbsp; Ideally, you should know *your * dosage in grams of GHB and the specific strength of your product.&nbsp; &nbsp;Regardless of the source, I recommend making a dilution of 1g / tsp.&nbsp; and managing your dosage from there.&nbsp; Detailed information on Concentrations and Dilutions is provided in a following post.<br /><br />WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN?<br />Nothing – This is common if a person takes too little or has a lot of food in their stomach<br />Nausea – Nausea is a common side effect.&nbsp; Some (a small %) people get nauseous every time they take GHB.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some get nauseous occasionally.&nbsp; Most people have no problem with it.<br />Sleep – The most common side effect of taking too much.&nbsp; See the safety information below.<br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				WHAT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I TAKE?<br />1) Color your GHB so that it is not mistaken for anything else.&nbsp; Some people recommend blue.<br />2) Keep your GHB in a container which can not be mistaken for a drinking container.<br />3) Keep the concentration relatively low.&nbsp; I recommend 1g&nbsp; per teaspoon.<br />4) Measure carefully.&nbsp; Pre-measure your doses if necessary.<br />5) Don&#039;t mix with alcohol<br />6) Use the buddy system.&nbsp; Be sure your friends are aware of what you are taking. <br />7) Discuss with your friends what do to when an overdose occurs.<br />(More good info here: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ghb/ghb_info6.shtml)<br /><br />WHAT IF SOMEONE OVERDOSES (FALLS ASLEEP) ON GHB?<br />G overdoses are common and are almost always harmless.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, they can be very scary.&nbsp; When someone takes too much and falls asleep from G they can be almost impossible to rouse.&nbsp; In addition, their breathing and pulse may become very shallow.&nbsp; If you are with someone who overdoses and falls asleep do NOT freak out.&nbsp; Check their breathing, turn them on their side (a precautionary measure in case they vomit), then sit with them until they wake up in 1-2 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, they’re your friend, and you would want them to do the same for you. <br /><br />If the person has taken other drugs, particularly alcohol or other depressants, keep a *very close* eye on them.&nbsp; Do not NOT freak out, but trust your gut, and get help immediately if you think they’re really in trouble.<br /><br />CAN I TAKE IT WITH ALCHOHOL? <br />NO NO NO!.&nbsp; &nbsp;OK, it’s a free(ish) world.&nbsp; You can do whatever you want - but G + alcohol is a very bad idea.&nbsp; Taking GHB with alcohol causes dramatically cumulative effects and increases the likelihood of nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; It will put you too sleep (no fun!) and could cause vomiting (no fun!) and potential aspirating on your vomit or other serious medical issues.) (No fun! No fun! No fun!)&nbsp; In full disclosure, I know of a couple very experienced users that greatly enjoy a glass of wine or a beer while on G.&nbsp; However, this practice will put 9/10 people to sleep or worse (no fun!)&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s your trip, but I advise against it.<br /><br />HOW DOES FOOD IMPACT IT?<br />The amount of food in your stomach can *significantly* impact GHB’s effects.&nbsp; If you take GHB right after a meal it often has no effect at all. <br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				REALLY, HOW MUCH SHOULD I TAKE?&nbsp; <br /><br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check with your source on the concentration and recommended dosage.<br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make your own dilution of 1g /teaspoon.<br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measure and dose from there.&nbsp; If you are new, start with 2g or less and adjust by ¼ or ½ g as necessary. <br /><br />GHB typically comes in a liquid and concentrations can vary quite a bit.&nbsp; Plus, they often come in high concentrations that are hard to measure.&nbsp; &nbsp; Regardless of your source, I strongly recommend diluting your G to a concentration of 1 GRAM / TEASPOON, and using this for dosing.<br /><br />(1 Teaspoon = 5ml)<br /><br />Basic&nbsp; Oral GHB Dosages:<br />Light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.5 - 1.5 g&nbsp; (minimal effect, some relaxation)<br />Common&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 - 2.5 g&nbsp; (relaxation, mild euphoria)<br />Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - 4.0 g (heavy relaxation, strong euphoria, potential loss of muscle control &amp; dizziness,)<br />Can Induce Heavy Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5 – 5+ g<br /><br />Once you make your 1g/teaspoon dilution, you can easily dose appropriately:<br />1g GHB&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; 5ml&nbsp; = 1 teaspoon<br />2g GHB&nbsp; &nbsp;= 10ml = 2 teaspoons<br />3g GHB&nbsp; &nbsp;= 15ml = 3 teaspoons<br /><br />I recommend the 1g / teaspoon concentration for a number of reasons.&nbsp; Everyone has a teaspoon around so it’s easy to do.&nbsp; You can accurately adjust the dosage from person to person or for yourself based on your mood.&nbsp; Finally, if this becomes your standard, it is very easy to do proper dosing even if you get G from multiple sources in various concentrations.&nbsp; All your friends will know how it works.<br /><br />BASELINE CONCENTRATIONS FROM SOURCES:<br />Xyrem:&nbsp; &nbsp;.5 grams / ml<br />TommyG Liquid Concentrate:&nbsp; 1g / ml.<br />TommyG Powder:&nbsp; A gram is a gram.<br /><br />Vendors:&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me know the concentration of your GHB in grams / ml and I will add it here.&nbsp; You can reply to this post or PM me and I will make the update.<br />

				Can you speak more about redosing throughout the night? My average dose is 3g, would it be good to redose 1g every hour to keep the buzz going? I&#039;ve never taken more than one dose in a night because I know the feeling of taking too much and I don&#039;t want to risk that in public.

				If your average dose is 3g, you should be safe bumping it with 2.5 grams every hour or so.&nbsp; The trick is to wait the full hour or more - wear a watch or set the timer on your phone if necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not know if a 1g would have much of an effect, but it certainly should not cause any problems.

				I must be really light weight or something. I started trying .5 and it was like I took a xanax or kpin. 1g seemed like a couple beers and weed. Trying 2g was almost too much for me, then I passed out pretty quick. 1.7g is now my starting dose, it&#039;s like right before the insta-pass out for me but I can still stay awake enough.<br /><br />It&#039;s weird because from what I&#039;ve seen 5g is more that limit and 2g is a regular dose. I&#039;d really advise figuring out your dosing, start small and work your way up. <br /><br /><br />Also G is the best at boosting your high. 0.25g is enough for weed to practically double it&#039;s potency. Basically 30cents and you can make the shittiest schwag into the finest chronic. Then again, maybe most people would have to take .5g since I&#039;m lightweight.<br /><br /><br />

				Fbu - Good on you for starting small and working up.&nbsp; That&#039;s is one of the things about G - people&#039;s doses can vary quite a bit, and does not necessarily correlate to size or other tolerances.&nbsp; I know a huge guy that can pound beer and take sheets of acid - yet 2 grams of G puts him away.&nbsp; I also know a small woman that regularly takes 3 grams to get get a buzz.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				A new question. I&#039;ve made a 1g/tsp solution in water. Does it keep at room temp, or must I keep it in the fridge? Will the GHB precipitate if the solution is chilled sufficiently? (And what&#039;s the freezing point of the solution, if you know that?)

				Opi - I have never heard of significant withdrawal from GHB.&nbsp; Lack of withdrawal is one of the hallmarks of G.&nbsp; Even people that have had party weekends, taking it 24/7 for two days report minimal after-effect.&nbsp; Everyone is different, so maybe your body reacted uniquely.&nbsp; More than likely though, it was something else - perhaps an interaction with other pharms/chems?&nbsp; Or maybe even you happened to catch a bug or something that felt like withdrawl?<br /><br />I would be interested to hear from anyone else with a similar experience.

				&nbsp;I ran through 50gs of Tommy&#039;s G in 3 days. Come the second day I was doing 5-6gs per dose. Went cold turkey this monday because school started again and I have absolutely 0 withdrawal symptoms. And I haven&#039;t done any other drugs other than nicotine.<br /><br />I fucking love TommyG man. Three 50g orders all went through flawlessly. Received in 2 days each time with extremely satisfying packaging. This is such an amazing drug and has many great aspects for me since I&#039;m on felony drug probation(don&#039;t test for G unless there&#039;s a strong suspicion) and since I&#039;m not very fond of drinking. Have had nothing but good experiences with the G man Tommy. Only issue i&#039;ve ever had is ODing and passing out when I had someone picking me up to go to the club the other week lol He was apparently banging the shit out of my door angrily while I was snoozin&#039; on the couch lolol. <br /><br />I love that sensation that G gives me when I&#039;m waking up from like a 6g dose lol Feels like I&#039;m gravitating almost. I took 10mg of melatonin before my last G dose too and I had some ridiculously cool dreams. I can&#039;t remember anything about them but I do remember that it was awesome because I woke up with the fattest, cheesiest smile on my face and it stuck for 30 mins.

				It seems opi is a bit sensitive to GHB. I just did 2g two nights ago and 2.5g last night and I&#039;ve no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. It&#039;s quite mild.<br /><br />I am still trying to find my dose. I found 2.5g to be fun, about equivalent to 4-5 shots for me. But I want stronger!

But a teaspoon is about 5ml, so if you had the same concentration then you were taking a fairly hefty dose for most, let alone for the intolerant. And you said yours was strong, yeah? Probably even stronger than 1g/tsp.<br /><br />But that&#039;s all conjecture. It sounds like DRI action was particularly off-putting to you. I know that if I take GHB about 3 hours before bedtime it&#039;s actually HARDER to sleep rather than 2 hours before, in which it&#039;s easier to sleep. Weird!

				Meh.. I had a mixed experience with tommys ghb, I hadnt eaten at all the day I got the package, so I was expecting it to work well. Took 2g, felt mildly tipsy ish, another 2g 45 mins later (i know i know wait an hour), felt the same for another hour.. so after that I took 5g and just felt tipsy again, so after about 20 mins i took the rest (total of 15g) and finally I felt really really good, euphoria and all, unfortunately I had to do a ton to feel like that.

				So I still don&#039;t understand how water &quot;ruins&quot; GHB. If we&#039;re diluting it in water anyway, why would it matter that it&#039;s hygroscopic? That might make it harder to handle but it doesn&#039;t mean the actual molecule is degrading. Am I missing something? The conventional wisdom is that it &quot;goes bad&quot; when not diluted.

				I would just like to add my own warning:<br /><br />A few years ago when GBL was legal to order in the UK, myself and my brother used to do quite a bit. We soon learned how to convert it to NaGHB by using sodium hydroxide. We would mix 50g of the solid NaGHB in 500ml water bottles, so 10-20ml was a dose.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first we thought it was a wonder drug, like a kind of euphoric sedation that made you horny as hell! However, we soon began to redose(taking the next dose as soon as the last one finishes) and before long we were dosing G every 2-3 hours 24 hrs a day and night, taking a large dose to sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the first batch (125ml of GBL so whatever that converts to) ran out we got a nasty surprise. We had only been dosing for a week but the withdrawal symptoms were intense and frightening: Very high blood pressure and heart rate; manic and obsessive thinking, sweating, shaking and auditory hallucinations.,delusions. My brother was shakiong so badly he was vibrating...he looked blurred. It was bizzarre. Fortunately it only lasted about 24 hrs on this occaision.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next time we ordered some we vowed to be more careful, and make sure we took regular breaks. Alas, we all know what happens to such intentions! This time we found the dependency developed even quicker....(like&nbsp; many addictive drugs, it seems your body &#039;learns&#039; to become dependant, and it happens quicker each time).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please understand I am not describing some &#039;psychological&#039; comedown. I have been an opiate addict for many years(currently treated with subutex) and I have gone through heroin withdrawal many times. This was perhaps not as bad but in many ways more frightening as we didn&#039;t know what to expect. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GHB acts on the GABA receptors the same as benzodiazapenes and so the dependency is similar to a short acting benzo like Xanax. GHB is also a strange and not well, understood drug, but what is well understood is it is physically addictive!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I am surprised from reading this thread that many of you seem unaware of this. I thought this debate had been played out years ago. At the time of our experimentation there was a lot of people on the Bluelight web forum debating whether or not it was addictive, but as time went on and more and more people had bad experiences the consensus was reached that yes, it is physically addictive.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not trying to spoil anyones fun, in moderation it is a very pleasant and safe drug, but its important to be aware of the risks. Some people seem to be able to guzzle the stuff without ever feeling any unpleasantness when they stop. I&#039;m not sure why this is.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in the unpleasant state of G withdrawal, valium or opiates can help somewhat, but strangely, we found the best medicine to be Diphenhydramine (Nytol, Benadryl)! We never could work out how but this otherwise useless drug really reduces the withdrawal symptoms.

				Yep I was trying to remember what those two drugs were called. I never tried them myself but had heard they were effective for severe G withdrawals.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; However these are powerful and potentially addictive drugs in their own right. If you overdo them there is a real danger you are just transferring your dePendence to another drug. As you say a dose or two could be very helpful.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you have been dependant on G for a few months I would suggest you need medical help to manage withdrawal. If just a week or two you&#039;re best just going to bed and shaking and sweating with some nytol.... It won&#039;t last too long.<br />As far as replacing with a benzo addiction, that&#039;s pretty much what I meant. Just a couple of Valium to ease you off, in the same way you might replace a short acting benzo with a long acting one to help come off.

				clarification:<br />baclofen is helpful for withdrawal-associated delirium (from ghb or phenibut) which is sufficiently severe that inpatient hospitalization is required. this is useful to know if you or anyone you care about ends up in that situation.<br /><br />baclofen is not benign and, on the balance, it isn&#039;t something I&#039;d probably recommend cross-tapering at home. if there&#039;s enough GHB/phenibut involved that it&#039;s a true-blue delirium, then it&#039;s worth going in. there are a lot of things that can be managed at home but this can get pretty weird when it goes bad.<br /><br />Edited out otherwise as this board will be withering off and I won&#039;t be around to answer any questions relating to my own post. Sorry.
