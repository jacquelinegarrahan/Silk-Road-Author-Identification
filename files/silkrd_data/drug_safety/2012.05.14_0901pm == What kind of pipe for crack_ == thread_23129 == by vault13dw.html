				I&#039;ve never smoked crack before in my life, but it&#039;s one of those drugs that I definitely want to tick off the list. I&#039;m not at all a cocaine man, i gave it many chances and never really liked the effect. Crack I&#039;m hoping is a little bit more fun. I&#039;m not in any danger of getting hooked on it, I&#039;m not a stimulant man at all, just want to try it.<br /><br />Anyhoo, what kind of pipe should I get? I&#039;m talking anything they might sell at a decent head shop. I was looking at spiral glass pipes, are those any good?<br /><br />Cheers

				You&#039;re supposed to smoke crack out of a glass tube. Just a plain old tube.

				Not an Oil pipe like meth is smoked out of...you dont wanna use that. Straight tubes are used for a couple reasons.The&nbsp; cocaine upon oiling is going to run past your screen. So It can be collected again and again as you miss your mark on each hit. Clear pyrex straight stems are best. Ever see those glass tubes in gas stations with little plastic flowers in them? Thats a crack pipe. Though, its not pyrex and the dripping cocaine that runs down the pipe can actually burn into the glass. Most head shops dont carry great pieces to smoke cocaine out of. Iv found the best piece available in smoke shops is asking for a 9mm oldschool waterpipe downstem (Female piece not male). Every smoke shop in the world has them. They flare out at one end unlike the normal crack stems but show a crackhead your pyrex downstem and I bet he&#039;d ask you to trade him. Ok, now about the brillo. This part is dangerous. The brillo if not used probably can burn up and cause microscopic pieces of metal to enter your lungs. You&#039;ll know when your Flem is darker and weird looking. This can be avoided easy with proper technique. Take your chor-boy brillo and roll a ball of it that will just fit&nbsp; down the stem. Its gotta be a tight fit, you should have to work it in the stem with some muscle. The more air tight the less the brillo will burn and the less likly you will have a brillo burning problem. Air causes the raise in temperature and helps burn the brillo, plus the cocaine wants to shoot past the brillo very easily as an oil.<br /><br />Once you have your brillo rolled into a ball , leave one little strain to hold on to (like a cherry) and proceed to light the ball on fire, burning off all the copper coloring. Once your brillo is no longer s shinny copper colored yet not so burned that its hardening up and turning&nbsp; white...you got the perfect screen for awhile and go ahead and start muscling it down the stem. Brillos must be changed REGULARLY. I change mine every 5-10 hits.. I am just starting to experiment with the brass screens you can buy at smoke shops. They dont ball up as easy and its hard to get them into a straight tube without a ton of air leakage but I have a feeling theyr healthier to use. The brillo sits right at the tip of the stem with about 1cm room to put the product. When you pull on the stem you should feel NO air coming through. Its gotta be tight.<br /><br />Place the cocaine on the brillo and just touch it with some flame, as to start the meltng. This keeps the cocaine from falling off as you go to take your hit, as will as keeps the cocaine right on the spot where you put in. Have you ever heard the herion term &quot;chasing the dragon&quot;? smoking cocaine is similar. Start with your head tilted back slightly, place your lips on the stem and start to pull. The first couple seconds you should be doing two things. First...chug hit it, like an old man hitting his pipe...This causes the lighter flame to fly up and down, effectively starting the smoking of all the oil on top of the brillo. After a couple chugges on it, just bring your head down slightly and while pulling very gently slightly twist the pipe in your fingers as to get the flame moving around the brillo. You dont need to pull hard and pulling faster and slower faster and slower will just fuck the hit up. You want to pull at a slow and EVEN pace. <br /><br />Man I probably just made all that sounds a lot more confusing than it is, hehe sorry. And your right, I dont like snorting cocaine it just isnt fun. Smoking it is where its at.. I just became a vendor on SR. Id be happy to make up some ready to go freebase cocaine pipes if you guys want?

				I would use a steel pipe with steel wool packed inside.Heat the bowl of the pipe and add your 20 piece and then hit the bowl had with a flame and suck away this will give a full burn and also leave your pipe fairly clean

				Never did crack before, but have had crackhead friends and they used to use a tire pressure gauge, unscrew it and you have a metal tube, then stuck a piece of brillo pad in it.

				I never smoked crack, but my old boss used to smoke it everyday. He used a corncob pipe. He would take some cigarette ash and tap it into the pipe then put the crack on top and smoke it like that. I guess it would work with any pipe, even a weed bowl. The ash keeps the shit from melting into the pipe and being wasted.
