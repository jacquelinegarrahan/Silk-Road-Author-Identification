				Seriously just saw this, it blows my mind how ignorant some people are. This has been forwarded by thousands upon thousands of people including doctors and figures within our judicial system.<br /><br /><br />Molly has been a common drug lately &amp; everyone is trying it. Pop 1 and your sweating? Let me explain why your sweating: Molly is a drug made up of cocaine, crack, ecstasy, meth &amp; bath salt. It slows your heart rate 10x the normal limit &amp; reeks havoc on your immune system with just one pill. Take two &amp; it damages your brain without you even being able realize it. It becomes an addiction &amp; soon a cry for help. By the fifth one you take, it starts killing your organs &amp; preventing them from functioning as normal. It increases your chance of stroke &amp; heart attack and can cause your lungs to stop functioning all together! It is a very powerful &amp; VERY DANGEROUS drug! More harmful than crack itself. Many rappers are promoting it to involve young people in the manufacturing, selling, and usage of the drug. Spread the word to save lives of young people across the country! Show them the truth so they can make an informed &amp; smart decision if theyâ€™re ever offered it.

Most people couldn&#039;t since most people have muscles to supply with oxygen^^<br /><br />But well..Thanks for the laugh, still smiling ;D<br />&gt;inb4 Man he is a troll<br />&gt;ahaha trolled you so hard<br />&gt;you thought it was serious, welcome to the internet

				Yeah I&#039;m pretty sure Molly turned me into a human being with a heart and a soul. Before I took the stuff I never knew or somehow forgot how beautiful the world and the people in it really could be. I was numb or dead until I swallowed the little pill and everything started to make sense again.<br /><br />I really wish it was cheap enough to put into a city water supply for a day. Millions of people all tripping balls and loving each other would just be glorious...

				Its kind of a bummer to see a thread like this. I mean, who gives a fuck? You didn&#039;t know that there are drug ignorant people spreading misinformation? I don&#039;t really feel like this is something worthwhile to be talking about here on SR. There are LOTS of REALLY stupid people out there and we don&#039;t need to waste our time talking about them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to come off as a dick to Diamondsky, but I think that shit deserves less attention. I would have logged on to the Drug Reddit and said the same thing, but they eat that shit up there.

Every now and then one of them catches my eye and I pop in to say whatever I want to say. People talk shit about drugs all the time, a good portion of the posts in the drug safety section are from people that were lied to about some drug or another and trying to figure out what the real deal is. Personally I think just having a place like these forums to talk honestly about the stuff we all take is great. I hate all the SWIM bullshit or my cat took such and such nonsense that the clearnet sites all seem to use. If it means we have to sort through some randomness I&#039;m all for it.
