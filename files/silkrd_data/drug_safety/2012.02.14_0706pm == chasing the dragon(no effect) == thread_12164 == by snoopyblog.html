				hello, 2 week ago i decided to try heroin for the first time and ordered 100 mg of heroin from a vendor whose <br />gear is supposely top notch, i chased it on foil doing matchead size hits and running it all along a 17 cm foil with a straw.<br />the taste was great but it had absolutly no effect on me, i wonder why maybe i was doing something wrong?<br />i have 500mg coming from another vendor and i will try again to smoke or snort it if you guy have any idea why i felt nothing please tell me.<br /><br />cheers.<br />

				I tried smoking the dragon once and not much of an effect, maybe like eating a little hash, but the other guy who was much more experienced was totally wasted.&nbsp; Smoking off foils is an art, I am trying to master meth, but after a dozen attempts am still struggling, drop it, run out of breath half way, cough and blow it away.&nbsp; Should stick to a pipe much more efficient.
