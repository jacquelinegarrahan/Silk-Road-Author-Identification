				I have taken 20mg of MXE a couple times with decent results. I read one report of a person starting out with 40 mg and dancing all day at rave, redosing several times. I started out with 20mg, was feeling pretty good after an hour, and redosed another 20mg at about that time. <br /><br />It quickly escalated into a very messed up trip. I was so confused. I couldn&#039;t tell whether all of the people in my life have been acting as friends or enemies. The room began to slowly rotate (not like the spins when you get when drunk, but just slowly and noticeably rotating). It seemed like the drug had control over my body, and I sank down into a meditation like posture and sat totally still for a long time. I was getting amazing effects then, even if my mind felt scrambled. I felt like I was in a maze of logic and energy that I kept getting more deeply entangled in.<br /><br />I ask if K makes you feel as stupid because soon, I got up to pee and could barely walk. I don&#039;t know how people can party on this stuff. But I was so frightened that I would accidentally cut off my dick or something when I took a piss. Just by accident. And then when I was done, I wasn&#039;t completely sure if I had done something to it, and decided if found out I had lost my dick or something I would just kill myself real quick.<br /><br />Then I ate an olive and spit out the pit, but wasn&#039;t sure a minute later if I had actually spit out the flesh part and swallowed the seed, so I started gagging and trying to throw up. Long story short, it really made me feel like I had gone insane for a bit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to give the substance bad publicity, as I am sure it has some value in self exploration and definitely for it&#039;s anti-depressant effects. But it would be nice to get the profound effects without feeling so stupid.<br /><br />

				I personally see greater value in ketamine as an anti-depressant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Being fucked up ketamine by itself doesn&#039;t seem too pleasurable.&nbsp; It can actually cause nausea and anxiety.<br /><br />Some people find K-hole as a spiritual experience though.&nbsp; Also, ketamine can be fun when mixed with other drugs.<br /><br />But, I wouldn&#039;t consider ketamine as a party drug.

				I find he K-hole a much more spiritual experience than MXE.&nbsp; I have a stash of quality MXE and have takin extremely large doses, 250mgs+ of MXE, and found that K is much more convenient in terms of time span, as well as, the MXE hole, especially with higher doses, is EXTREMELY long lived, I was in a m-hole for 5-6 hours and needed my girlfriend to help me go to the bathroom to piss, and I found the M-hole to be far more bizarrely overhelming than the k-hole.&nbsp; I mean, I&#039;ve literally, without any tolerance, taking a gram of K into my nose without issue, back in a few hours, MXE on the other hand set me into a hole that was 5-6 times deeper and 2-4 times longer lived than K alone, and completely different in presentation.&nbsp; MXE is nothing at all like Ketamine, a complete fucking lie in terms of marketing, you&#039;d be better off looking at the immediate analogs of ketamine, like flouro- or ethyl-ketamine rather than MXE.&nbsp; MXE is much more like PCP than ketamine, though I&#039;d add that it is like a far less extreme version of PCP, it is basically the franzia boxed wine of the PCP family, safe and forgiving, where as Ketamine is the safest and most satisfying of the entire cyclohexanone family in general, being completely non-toxic without adding other depressants (i.e.valium, benzos, weed, alcohol, etc.).
