				http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2405677/Ketamine-relieve-symptoms-depression-60-patients--little-24-hours.html<br /><br />Ketamine could relieve the symptoms of depression in as little as 24 hours, new research suggests.<br />The drug, which is also used in anaesthesia, can relieve symptoms in more than 60 per cent of people with depression within 24 hours.<br />In contrast, most prescription anti-depressants take four to six weeks to prove effective.<br />The findings come after the biggest ever study to examine ketamine’s effect on depression.<br />Some 73 people with the condition were involved in the U.S. study, with two thirds given ketamine, and one third midazolam – a short-acting anaesthetic medication.<br />The researchers found that 64 per cent of those given ketamine improved within 24 hours.<br />In contrast, only 28 per cent of those given midazolam improved.<br />The research was carried out at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Centre, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York,<br />Lead researcher, Dr Sanjay Mathew, said: ‘Through this study, we’ve now confirmed in an optimised trial design that ketamine does have robust and rapid antidepressant effects.’<br />Ketamine was given to the patients intravenously and in very low doses.<br />Dr Mathew explained: ‘All previous studies of ketamine have compared it to saline, an inert placebo without physical or psychological reactions. <br />‘The problem with this is that ketamine has usual side effects, such as feelings of floating, feelings of altered sense of time, maybe some blurred vision or some other physical or psychological symptoms.<br /><br />‘Patients know that they received something active and the raters would know that as well, so the validity of the study may be in doubt with saline studies.<br />‘This is the first trial to compare ketamine to another drug that also has psychoactive properties.’<br />Dr Mathew and his colleagues followed the patients for seven days and found that many of the patients who received ketamine continued to benefit from the treatment after seven days, although there was a decrease in benefits by day seven.<br /><br /><br />They then studied the subgroup of patients who did well at day seven to see how long they remained depression-free and found that a small group of patients were able to remain depression-free for an additional four weeks.<br />Dr Mathew says that there is still much more that needs to be understood before ketamine can be used clinically. <br />For example, the best dose to use would have to be established and side effects, such as elevated blood pressure, would have to be taken into account.<br />The researchers believe that ketamine reduces depression by influencing the glutamate system – glutamate are neurotransmitters which speed up the transmission of information from one nerve cell to the next.<br /><br />

				Very long story so I might not add anything.<br /><br /><br />Learned about K in past 3 months:<br />Person on SR asked about how to use it for depression... Did not understand it.. But I&#039;d be in the K hole all the time which cures depression but not my money.<br />Sometimes it gives insights.<br /><br />K is way too expensive. $30 for 1g... People with high tolerance like me can use that 5 times. So in 5 hours its all gone.<br />Luckily I hate coke.<br /><br />MXE is better. But fucks up properly using bodily functions all day so should be used in the evening.<br /><br />K is used in Belgium(Gent) in hospitals on people on IV, to cure depression in 2 weeks.<br /><br />Do you also love it when you tell people some drug can be used as a cure/medicine and that pharms are drugs/bad? And that you are told you&#039;re wrong/psychotic/get antipsychotics? And then that a few months/years those same people tell you your story like you did not know it and then you tell them drugs are bad and then they think you&#039;re stupid and that that is fucking insickfuckingcredible?

				ps:<br /><br />MAPS.ORG<br /><br />support them. They are the only ones not being sold out by the pharm and do actual useful research...<br /><br />And: FUCK PHARMS! Steal from them, burn them, kill them! Oh how to cure cancer? POISON! use weed dammit.<br />So yeah if you kill people who work for the pharm you&#039;re not killing other people. Yes they might live in a horrible pharm way otherwise, but they should. Or they should support real cures and stay sane.<br /><br />
