				I&#039;v read up on the dos and dont of sh rooms just have a few questions - everywhere i read it says dont take alone - dont take with people not taking them. Heres my question none of my friends care to try shrooms with me and i&#039;v never tryed them in my life and i&#039;m 26! so there&#039;s a park a short walk from my house i was thinking about doing it there should i bring my dog with me he responds to voice commands but i dont know how the effect is on the sh rooms they say for 24 hours i cant have any things that need to be done or stress or anything. I&#039;m not sure if this is possible due to being married with kid and 4 animals lol so should i just take them walk over to the park and let it ride or should i plan more?

				I would wait until you can be alone at home for at least 4 hours, unless your wife knows you&#039;ll be doing them, your pupils will be dilated and that is pretty hard to hide when talking face to face with anyone. Stay at home until your trip is at peak, which is just over an hour after you take them. Then you will be able to judge if you feel up to going outside. As long as you are not taking an epic high dose you will still be sane and perfectly capable of being in nature at the park. Mushrooms usually make people think quite clearly and deeply, they are good to take to sort out personal life issues. I suggest also setting aside time to just lay in bed and look at the closed eye visuals of fractuals and colors :)

				It depends on the strain and the amount that you&#039;re doing. Are these cubensis? If so, since this is your first time, I suggest taking 2.5 grams. It will start to kick in after about a half hour, and a couple of hours later you&#039;ll be rolling right along into your trip. It&#039;s not really a big deal to do them alone, but I would definitely stay aside until you know what you&#039;re dealing with here. Since you&#039;ve never done them before, you need to know how your mind is reacting before you can be comfortable going outside anywhere. You don&#039;t need to be wandering around the park not sure how to get back home because you let yourself lose control. Also be aware that you may have stomach pains at some points during the night, so being near a bathroom isn&#039;t a bad idea. But once you&#039;re really tripping and you&#039;re aware of yourself, I would absolutely suggest that you at least step outside. I always like to lay on my front lawn at 3am and just stare at the magnificence of the universe. <br /><br />Have a great trip! Welcome to the club.

				I used to totally mock tales of &quot;bad trips&quot; as urban legends.&nbsp; No one really tries to jump off of a roof because they think they can fly... I remained fairly cynical and just assumed that it was made up to scare kids.&nbsp; <br /><br />My three best friends, let&#039;s call them Sam, Don, and Jack, were all at Jack&#039;s new apartment celebrating the start of summer.&nbsp; All three were in their late 20s, had done shrooms a few times before.&nbsp; Sam had even done some from the batch they took a few days earlier and had a great time.&nbsp; They mix about 1/8th of an ounce up into some tea.&nbsp; All goes well for about the first 30 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sam starts acting very strangely and a normally calm and gentle person is suddenly a raging aggressive ball of energy.&nbsp; Jack and Don try to get him to chill out a little.&nbsp; Sam begins screaming to them that &quot;THIS IS ALL A MOVIE!&quot;, walks up to the double paned window in the apartment and with both fists double-punches through the glass, twists his out-stretched arms and then proceeds to pull back and the glass rips the skin back and cuts particularly deeply down his inner forearm. Sam is running around like a mad man, still screaming about everything being a movie and the spotless new apartment is suddenly covered in blood, which is gushing rather profusely from Sam.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don and Jack call 911.&nbsp; They get Sam out of the apartment, still covered in blood and raving like a lunatic.&nbsp; Now he&#039;s on the front lawn, emitting an unearthly howl while picking bits of flesh off of his arm which still has pieces of glass stuck in it and is dripping blood.&nbsp; The police and paramedics arrive.&nbsp; they approach cautiously and ask him what drugs he has taken.&nbsp; He begins to scream the name of every drug he can think of as the police try to get him to calm down.&nbsp; By this point, they have their guns drawn and Sam is staring at them as they taze him.&nbsp; Nothing happens, Sam continues to laugh like a man possessed.&nbsp; They taze him again.&nbsp; He goes down.<br /><br />He comes to in the ambulance and fights the paramedics all the way to the hospital.&nbsp; Don and Jack get arrested.&nbsp; Sam is under arrest too, but he is strapped to a hospital bed and unconscious for the next 72 hours. If Don and Jack waited 5 more minutes to call 911, Sam would have died from massive blood loss. <br /><br />Don and Jack were first time offenders and eventually had their records expunged.&nbsp; Sam was a stand-out teacher in a decaying urban public school, shortly after his name appeared in the police blotter a few towns over, outraged parents were posting to the local newspaper&#039;s web article such insightful comments as: &quot;Does this mean all the grades he has given for the last 2 years are invalid since he was tripping?&quot;&nbsp; While disappointed students posted comments remembering him as one of the few teachers who they really liked and respected.&nbsp; Needless to say, he was forced to resign.&nbsp; <br /><br />So...&nbsp; I hate to totally be a Debbie Downer, but the plain truth about tripping is this:&nbsp; you are ingesting a poison, your body is going to freak out trying to deal with it.&nbsp; Now we all stick to cannabis for our mind expanding adventures.&nbsp; <br /><br />So my advice, don&#039;t do shrooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />My second piece of advice, if you do shrooms, make sure you are somewhere safe, preferably not out in public where you can get arrested, and by all means have someone with you who has NOT taken shrooms.

				Well edgar, I don&#039;t know who your friend is, but what you just described is probably one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard. Absolutely no one should be reacting to an eighth shrooms in that way, not anyone who&#039;s an adult anyways. I know so many people that do shrooms, and I never heard of a single experience like the one you&#039;re describing. People should ignore your advice. I think that taking shrooms is one of the most enlightening experiences you can have. It really makes you think about yourself and the universe. You should not be freaking out like that while on shrooms, not even remotely. I&#039;m inclined to think that this story is completely made up, and you are just trying to dissuade people from taking shrooms for some reason or another. Especially since this is your second post ever, so you have no trust in the community whatsoever. And if you&#039;re not making it up, your supposed friend certainly shouldn&#039;t be doing any kinds of substances because he has a severe mental problem if shrooms cause him to cut himself and fight the police.

				I will toss in my 2cents as I&#039;ve enjoyed mushies several times in the past and may do so again in the near future&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; Some people may tell you 2.5g or 1.8g or 2.x on the dot&nbsp; I honestly feel like anything within the range of 1.5-2.5g of cubensis just to &quot;get your feet wet&quot; is a good starting point.&nbsp; (I am not attacking or trying to disagree with anyone just imparting my personal opinion.)&nbsp; As far as being around others, I&#039;ve found my moments on shrooms to be a bit more introspective and self-exploratory.&nbsp; There have also been a couple of times when I felt a little discomfort that I can only describe as a feeling of anxiousness.&nbsp; Having a bit of green on hand definitely seems to ease this anxious feeling and makes the trip all the more enjoyable to boot.&nbsp; Should these feelings arise, remember all that you&#039;re feeling is nothing more than temporary and to remain calm.&nbsp; I myself have not experienced any stomach discomfort as others have but then again, everyone is different.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve done your research, you&#039;re probably ready.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp;

				first and foremost, read this to better understand the psychedelic state: http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/psychedelic_experience/psychedelic_experience.shtml<br /><br />it will help you a lot. also, you may not want to go wandering around while tripping. a good dose of shrooms is pretty incapacitating (i usually spend most of the trip in bed, deep inside/outside myself). having weed around will definitely help. just remember: no resistance. NEVER try to control a trip, or it will get bad. don&#039;t fight with your subconscious, simply observe it. meditation always helps.

				Some basic advice:<br /><br />-Don&#039;t take more than 1.5g since it&#039;s your first time, even if it&#039;s your third time just don&#039;t do it.<br />-Get pepto bismol pills or ginger root extract pills for the nausea you&#039;ll most likely get.<br />-Don&#039;t think about anything that will worry you just tell yourself that you&#039;re going to trip and just do that, have fun with it!<br />-Try to be active, I feel that if you lay down or sit down during your peak it&#039;s very easy to slip into a bad trip so try to walk around and enjoy the scenery.

				My experience: I am not trying to influence you in anyway, just going to share with you my one and only experience. I know that a majority of people have a very positive experience. However if you are one of the few such as myself that have a bad experience, it can be very bad. To this day, the night I took shrooms was by far the worst experience of my life. However.... I will admit that I did several things wrong.<br />&nbsp;<br />First off, when I took it, I had no idea what amount to take. My friend told me to take an 1/8th so I did. Looking back that was way too much for my first time. Secondly, it was only my friend and I that took it. The other people, approximately 10 others, were drinking and playing beer pong. These were both mistakes.<br /><br />After I ate them, it took about 30 minutes to start to feel the effects. I was sitting down watching tv with a couple of my friends and all the sudden I couldn&#039;t focus at all. When my friends ask me a question it took what felt like forever to answer. I felt like everyone in the room knew i had taken them even though only 3 or 4 of them actually did. After 5 to 10 minutes and the feeling intensifying I went to my room and closed and locked my door behind me. At this point I felt much better with nobody around me. I laid down on my bed and remember I laughed a lot. One thing I do remember is that it had to be like every 2 minutes I thought to myself &quot;I need to lock the door&quot; only to realize that it was already locked. <br /><br />After about 30 minutes in my room everyone else left to go out except my other friend who had also done it. However I still wanted to stay in my room and be alone. I was still feeling good at this point but remember thinking to myself &quot;This is different, but nothing about it is all that great.&quot; One of the highlights of my night was that my Stuie (from family guy) poster above my TV turned into a little Stuie/Hitler character. That didn&#039;t freak me out either I just thought it was interesting. What may have started to freak me out was when I planned on texting a different friend that knew I was going to take shrooms, and tell him how I felt. I became a little puzzled when I couldn&#039;t really describe it. Over the next hour or so I just laid in bed with my mind going a mile per minute thinking of stuff that I&#039;m sure made no sense, but at the time did. I remember thinking I should write this down, but I didn&#039;t want to get out of bed.<br /><br />At this point I felt tired and really just wanted to come down from it. I remember my friend telling me that it would last around 6-8 hours so I decided to try to figure out how much longer I had. I looked at the clock and it was 12:20. What really freaked me out was when I looked at the clock a couple minutes later and it said 12:15. This really confused me and I decided to go and see my other friend that was on shrooms and still in the apartment. This freaked me out the most when I found him in my other roommates room standing and looking at the tv, smiling, and the TV wasn&#039;t even on. He looked at me when I walked in and said something like what up dude, with a creepy smile on his face. I immediately went back to my room and closed the door. At this point I was totally freaked out and just wanted it to be over. I had no idea what was going on or if any of it was even real.<br /><br />I decided that I just wanted to talk to somebody that could reassure me that everything was alright. So I called one of my friends. When he answered I realized that I had no idea what to say and just hung up on him. I called him one more time and think I managed to say hey before hanging up on him again. luckily he figured I wasn&#039;t having a good trip and called my roommate who had gone out and told him to come home. He texted me and told me he was on his was home and I felt relieved. It felt like it took him an hour to come home. Finally when he did I had started to come down a little and he helped reassure me as well. At that point I think it was around 2:30 and it took me until almost 6 before I could fall asleep. I still felt uneasy during that time period, but atleast had a grip on reality.<br /><br />After that night I told myself that i would never do shrooms again. That was about a year ago. At this point I would consider doing it again under very different circumstances, and a very small dosage. To summarize, there is a very good chance that you will have a positive experience. But beware, if it doesnt work out that way it could be a very bad experience. So definitely take a small dosage your first time to make sure that shrooms are for you. I know, FRAT warning

				Great advice from everyone here- ain&#039;t NOTHING like the first time your mind opens up to an entirely different world. One thing that was overly important for me was making a CD which functioned as a proper soundtrack. I tried to make the songs play along with the time it took for the shrooms to start kicking in, I took 1.5 grams with a few friends and smoked a nice fat blunt. The one song that put everything into perspective for me was Outkast&#039;s- Spottieottiedopalicious- I put it mid cd. This particular song is just overly funky, but it has this live trumpet loop that is just straight up bliss. When that song came on I sat back on the couch, and when the trumpet part kicked in I started seeing pictures of my life flash up on the wall in picture frames starting from when I was a young kid up to that point. I was completely blown away by this, seeing a mental photo book scrolling on the wall for like 9 minutes (which seemed longer than that) of some of the greatest times, places and people. Very emotional to say the least. <br /><br />This turned me on the world of psychedelics an was a great introduction IMO. Best of luck friend and I hope you have something equally as beautiful happen to you. I&#039;ll never forget that night.&nbsp;

I know that a majority of people have a very positive experience. However if you are one of the few such as myself that have a bad experience, it can be very bad. To this day, the night I took shrooms was by far the worst experience of my life. However.... I will admit that I did several things wrong.<br />&nbsp;<br />First off, when I took it, I had no idea what amount to take. My friend told me to take an 1/8th so I did. Looking back that was way too much for my first time. Secondly, it was only my friend and I that took it. The other people, approximately 10 others, were drinking and playing beer pong. These were both mistakes.<br /><br />After I ate them, it took about 30 minutes to start to feel the effects. I was sitting down watching tv with a couple of my friends and all the sudden I couldn&#039;t focus at all. When my friends ask me a question it took what felt like forever to answer. I felt like everyone in the room knew i had taken them even though only 3 or 4 of them actually did. After 5 to 10 minutes and the feeling intensifying I went to my room and closed and locked my door behind me. At this point I felt much better with nobody around me. I laid down on my bed and remember I laughed a lot. One thing I do remember is that it had to be like every 2 minutes I thought to myself &quot;I need to lock the door&quot; only to realize that it was already locked. <br /><br />After about 30 minutes in my room everyone else left to go out except my other friend who had also done it. However I still wanted to stay in my room and be alone. I was still feeling good at this point but remember thinking to myself &quot;This is different, but nothing about it is all that great.&quot; One of the highlights of my night was that my Stuie (from family guy) poster above my TV turned into a little Stuie/Hitler character. That didn&#039;t freak me out either I just thought it was interesting. What may have started to freak me out was when I planned on texting a different friend that knew I was going to take shrooms, and tell him how I felt. I became a little puzzled when I couldn&#039;t really describe it. Over the next hour or so I just laid in bed with my mind going a mile per minute thinking of stuff that I&#039;m sure made no sense, but at the time did. I remember thinking I should write this down, but I didn&#039;t want to get out of bed.<br /><br />At this point I felt tired and really just wanted to come down from it. I remember my friend telling me that it would last around 6-8 hours so I decided to try to figure out how much longer I had. I looked at the clock and it was 12:20. What really freaked me out was when I looked at the clock a couple minutes later and it said 12:15. This really confused me and I decided to go and see my other friend that was on shrooms and still in the apartment. This freaked me out the most when I found him in my other roommates room standing and looking at the tv, smiling, and the TV wasn&#039;t even on. He looked at me when I walked in and said something like what up dude, with a creepy smile on his face. I immediately went back to my room and closed the door. At this point I was totally freaked out and just wanted it to be over. I had no idea what was going on or if any of it was even real.<br /><br />I decided that I just wanted to talk to somebody that could reassure me that everything was alright. So I called one of my friends. When he answered I realized that I had no idea what to say and just hung up on him. I called him one more time and think I managed to say hey before hanging up on him again. luckily he figured I wasn&#039;t having a good trip and called my roommate who had gone out and told him to come home. He texted me and told me he was on his was home and I felt relieved. It felt like it took him an hour to come home. Finally when he did I had started to come down a little and he helped reassure me as well. At that point I think it was around 2:30 and it took me until almost 6 before I could fall asleep. I still felt uneasy during that time period, but atleast had a grip on reality.<br /><br />After that night I told myself that i would never do shrooms again. That was about a year ago. At this point I would consider doing it again under very different circumstances, and a very small dosage. To summarize, there is a very good chance that you will have a positive experience. But beware, if it doesnt work out that way it could be a very bad experience. So definitely take a small dosage your first time to make sure that shrooms are for you. I know, FRAT warning<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Equally good advice as well. I&#039;m sure you can have a good trip alone, however I&#039;ve always made sure that there were at least 2-3 people with me when I&#039;ve done them mainly for good vibe purposes. I&#039;ll almost always start out watching some sort of comedy show, stand up or animated to get some laughter going and set the mood right. Just like with any drug though, your mental state will play a role in how well your trip goes. I had a friend that was going through some things in his family and financial life and he decided to hide in the closet for 6 hours changing clothes every 30 minutes for some odd ass reason, lol. <br /><br />Good vibes OP. Just think and be around people with good vibes and all will go well.,

				I don&#039;t think people say to not trip alone because you&#039;ll have a bad trip, but I would recommend to trip with someone else or a group because it will be more fun your first few times.<br /><br />My first few shroom trips I would pretty much switch between 2 modes, non-stop laughter and paranoia, especially towards the couple that hadn&#039;t taken them. Tripping alone was nice but not nearly the same experience.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t until I had worked out how my body reacted to shrooms that I could truly enjoy to trip alone, because I was aware of my paranoia it was easily manageable.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say I would recommend to do it outdoors your first time either, bright sunlight and fluorescent lights are bothersome to me when I trip. Cloudy day or in the woods I&#039;m fine, one trip at a park on a sunny day however and I spent the majority of it with one generously shady tree, refusing to walk around with everyone else.<br /><br />If you do trip away from home or some other controlled environment, make sure you have a way to get back safely - ie, don&#039;t drive to a park 20 minutes away, trip and know your stuck there unable to drive for 4+ hours.<br /><br />Float trips are pretty cool to trip on as well, and I absolutely hate float trips otherwise.
