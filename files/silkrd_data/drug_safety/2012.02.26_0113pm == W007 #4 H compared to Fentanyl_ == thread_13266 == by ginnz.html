				Hi guys,<br /><br />I got a couple questions for ya, and value any input! Ok, I use Fentanyl duarte sic regularly , as I&#039;m prescribed it for chronic upper back pain, and knee problems. I get 15-100 mcg/hr every month. I use 1 to 1-1/4 patch a DAY... Not one every 2 as prescribed. I also changed my route AF administration, as I cut them into strips, and put them under my tounge, till they&#039;re done..... My issue is, I run out a couple weeks early every month, and CANNOT deal with the withdrawals, so I ordered up some of W007&#039;s we Asian #4&nbsp; to help me along.<br /><br />My questions are, how does it compare to Fent.? And as I&#039;m NOT an iv&#039;er, I&#039;m planning to do small bumps to keep me going. I don&#039;t imagine it can be smoked, as it&#039;s #4?<br /><br />And, in your opinions, how long do you think a gram should last me? If I don&#039;t go crazy, and use it just to keep me normal? <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried H in the past, but where I&#039;m from, it&#039;s almost immpossible to acquire, and is TOTAL shit, so I am very happy I found W007!!!!!! If my first transaction works out good, I&#039;m planning on getting three, or maybe five gms at a time, less &quot;mailing&quot; then!!<br /><br />Thanks for any replies guys!<br /><br />Ginnzberg

				Ginnz,<br />My best advice to you is to buy the East Coast USA #4 that comes by the bag (each bag is like a dose). It&#039;s my favorite kind and I find it way more euphoric and long lasting compared to fentanyl. I feel like fentanyl is just a numbing agent, it is a very empty high and lacks true euphoria, but t does take away pain, therefore, numbing agent made sense to me, lol.<br />I hope someone else knows what I mean by that?<br /><br />I am used to getting in NYC, but I see that theclose29 is offering double sealed bags (1 bag = 1 dose) which I am looking to purchase soon. It can be sniffed and IV&#039;ed. Rumors are you can smoke it, but it is a waste and less effective. I sniff, and it lasts several hours and is very potent...I will let you know how it goes, but so far this is my favorite type that I&#039;ve encountered in my experiences.
