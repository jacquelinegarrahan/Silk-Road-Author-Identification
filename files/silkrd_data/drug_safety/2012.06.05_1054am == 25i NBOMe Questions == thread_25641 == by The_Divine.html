If they&#039;re HPBCD, I&#039;d suggest to start with half. And yes, they can be really small.<br />The side doesn&#039;t matter because the chemical is equally spread in the blotter.<br />I always swallow saliva when taking it. If your take it under your tongue you can&#039;t swallow for 30 minutes to ensure full absorption because the drug dissolves in the saliva and is inactive if swallowed.<br />But if you put it between the upper lip and gum, the tab doesn&#039;t come in contact with saliva, so there&#039;s no reason why you shouldn&#039;t swallow it. In fact, if you don&#039;t swallow the saliva, eventually it&#039;ll soak up the tab, and then you must keep it in your mouth for 30 minutes (like sublingual absorption).<br />My tips:<br />1) Before applying the tab, suck all the saliva in your mouth and swallow it<br />2) Lick your upper lip a bit (it has to be a bit damp, not wet!) so the blotter sticks nicely<br />3) Put the blotter as up as possible to minimize contact with saliva in the mouth<br />A bit will dissolve anyway in some saliva (not sure where it comes from though lol) and it will numb your mouth, but it&#039;s a really small quantity and you can swallow it without impacting the potency.

				I have these same tabs and yes, they&#039;re supposed to be that small. If you haven&#039;t done it before you should probably start with a 1/4 of a tab (500 ug) or maybe a 1/4 and an 1/8th (750ug). I did 750 yesterday and it was great but tolerances differ. The best rule of thumb is to start low. Also, give it time. I believe it was about 2 hours until I actually started to see stuff but I started to feel the effects after about an hour.

				Just came back from a trip, i ended up taking the full 2mgs, half and then another half.<br />Wasn&#039;t overwhelming, floor seemed to be breathing and things stretching and shit, felt pretty fucking weird though, even now 9 hours in the icons on my screen are still moving.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me that if i would have done a full blotter instead of half&#039;s it would give me a stronger effect, is this true?&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m gonna try it again in 2 days, and then I&#039;ll take a break for a couple of month&#039;s or so, wonderful stuff.

				2 days isn&#039;t enough to reset tolerance. The tolerance to 25I is a bit higher that that for LSD. I have found that this plot is accurate for 25I: www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/479297-The-Big-amp-Dandy-LSD-amp-Shroom-Tolerance-FAQ-and-Discussion-Thread<br /><br />If you want zero tolerance, you have to wait two weeks. One week is enough to feel it pretty good. I&#039;ve done it after 4 days and the tolerance was noticeable, I wouldn&#039;t advise doing it so soon.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to do it after 2 days, you should take 2 and 1/4 tabs to feel the same effect.

				My friends who had never tripped before took two 550ug tabs, and I took three.&nbsp; It was a great night, but they started to get scared when the &quot;sparkling&quot; wore off and we were inside the house, and everything looked so weird to them.&nbsp; Then we had this terrifying group moment when the looping started and one of them pointed it out.&nbsp; But overall, this chemical usually isn&#039;t scary and a ton of fun.&nbsp; It did get slightly scary, however, when I started to be able to see through one of the person&#039;s heads.&nbsp; We were also worried that I was experiencing vasoconstriction in my right arm.&nbsp; They said it looked really blue, but we weren&#039;t sure if that was just the visuals.&nbsp; Is this a sign of vasoconstriction?&nbsp; We tried to ignore it and continue on with our trip, but it did make me pretty damn nervous.

I dont want to be overwhelmed by the vast amount of people (and I don&#039;t have much experience with psychedelics) So im taking 500mcg first and if im okay after 2 hours, probably will take another 500mcg. <br /><br />Which leads me to my question, if anyone knows-- Will redosing (say after 2 hours) intensify the trip or just make it last longer? Or both? I am mainly wanting the auditory enhancement for the music with mood lift/euphoria with some cool visuals--nothing too crazy. I&#039;d like it to last for 10 hours or so. Any help is appreciated. Im 5&#039;11 160lbs

				My experience has been that re-dosing will extend the trip, but does not seem to intensify it... in fact the extended period of the trip will be a bit diminished. This was taking a 1mg tab, and then about 4 hours later taking another 1mg tab.

				At festivals candyflipping is a good option<br /><br />I am 6&#039;1 80kg and I found that 2 normal strength ecstacy pills : 1 tab of normal strength acid was a good ratio<br /><br />always combine ecstacy with acid as opposed to things liek mushrooms and mescaline<br /><br />do not add ketamine into the mix unless you want to go to mars and then forget how you got there<br /><br />the danger with candyflipping is its unpredictable when you add other drugs into the mix even weed and booze, so to be safe, I would try and make sure you stay away from other substances until the effects of both drugs have worn off<br /><br />have fun!

				I&#039;d be careful with MDMA + 25I though. It causes problems with vasoconstriction and blood pressure. You&#039;d be probably fine at home but doing it at a party is likely to result in a bad night.

				Thanks for the responses. I am planning on doing MDMA and 25i but not at the same nights. I&#039;d love to candyflip, but I don&#039;t currently have any acid and I&#039;ve been wanting to try 25i for a while. I&#039;ll probably just start with 500 or 750mcg to play it safe. Rather be a tad underwhelmed than overwhelmed and freaking out.

				I found that 2 550mic tabs of Kwiktrips got me quite fucked up for about 4 hours, then the effects went away to almost nothing very quickly<br /><br />tip: dont try and hike up a mountain on 25i, that made for a very uncomfortable (but beautiful) trip. The whole time we just wanted some where nice to lay down but it was all rocky and steep, durp =D
