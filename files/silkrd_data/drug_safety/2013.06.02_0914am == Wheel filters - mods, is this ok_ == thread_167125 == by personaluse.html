				Hi all,<br /><br />Given that I no longer IV any more - I have a bunch of wheel filters (all 3 micron measures that will filter all the shit (bunk, even bacteria) out of your gear. I also have a guide on how to use them with different types of drugs/scripts.<br /><br />I was thinking about making them available (to people within Australia) in the interests of drug safety for just a touch over the cost of postage (just to cover the packing material and my petrol etc). I don&#039;t plan on opening a vendor&#039;s account - I&#039;m not even really &#039;selling&#039; them (I won&#039;t make a profit), and it&#039;s just something that would help keep people safe on SR.<br /><br />In light of this - mods, how do you feel about this plan? I don&#039;t want to break the rules, I just want to make sure people who now have access to different drugs via SR can take them in relative safety.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Mr P<br /><br />

				Your thread will probably get locked in a couple minutes because mods are being pretty hard on out of SR deals right now.. It&#039;s a good idea to sell them for the sake of harm reduction though (are they the 0.22 or 0.45 btw?) but you won&#039;t be able to sell without an account and a mod will tell you this in minutes from now.<br />You could find a vendor that you get along with well and if he has an anonymous drop address, you could just send it to him, and he&#039;d pay you a couple $ I guess. You could always try to PM a vendor but I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll work either and it&#039;s probably against the rules either, although it&#039;s technically not an out of escrow deal since you&#039;re not a vendor.<br /><br />UPDATE : Well that&#039;s odd.. Usually, each time someone posts something like that, it gets locked. Maybe it&#039;s because you didn&#039;t post in product offers.

				As long as you &quot;sell&quot; them through a vendor account here, that should be fine.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need to pay the $500 for the vendor account, but you can get that bond refunded after awhile.&nbsp; You can still sell your items for mostly-free, but you&#039;ll definitely need a vendor account first.
