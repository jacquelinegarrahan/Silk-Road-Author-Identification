I&#039;m not going to give you a lecture and tell you why you shouldn&#039;t do what your doing, it&#039;s pretty damn obvious... but it feels as though you are very lonely and you are seeking nothing more than a little attention.

				I have thought about killing myself as well.&nbsp; The only thing that really keeps me alive, is the fact that there are gonna be alot of people that are gonna be fucked up afterwards.&nbsp; Not to mention the financial strain those individuals will have to endure during the weeks, months, years after the deal goes down.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s a fucked up situation to be in.&nbsp; Loved ones will be crushed if you take your own life, but you feel that there is nothing left in your life that is worth living for.&nbsp; Trust me, dog..&nbsp; I live with that shit everyday.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most days, my mood swings a dozen times just during the 8 hours I am at work.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t wish that upon most people.<br /><br /><br />I guess what I am trying to say is, you aren&#039;t alone.&nbsp;

				wow just wow... stupid western emo girls. just snort/shoot raw fentanyl powder like 10 mg and you&#039;ll be gone for good you attention seeking whore. if you really want to kill yourself buy a van learn how to make ANFO and pack it with 0.5-2 tons of ANFO go into crowded place and blow yourself up. that would atleast make some point that your life sucked and someone should have done soemthing about it. now no one will care actually will be laughing at just another dead junky.. just pathetic..<br /><br />Oh btw so whats that some alcohol and 45mg of clonazepam. You are probably passed out right now and will wake up a couple days later I bet 2000$ that you&#039;ll survive.

				First of all a big fat heart-felt FUCK YOU to the all the people bashing kitkat. You have absolutely no idea what you&#039;re talking about or what kitkat is going through. So shut the fuck up.<br /><br />kitkat, you sound a lot like me and (this is all speculation, so sorry if I&#039;m wrong) from what I understand, by trying to kill yourself you&#039;re not trying to get a message across to someone. You&#039;re trying it not because you don&#039;t want to live anymore per se but because you&#039;d rather be dead than endure the pain you&#039;re currently experiencing.<br /><br />I know how that feels. I&#039;m sick of crying myself to sleep every night. I&#039;m sick of being lonely. I&#039;m sick of being full of hate. I&#039;m sick of being controlled by fear. I need a shoulder to cry on but I seem to be scaring everyone away who gets to know me too well. I&#039;m sick of having no significant impact on anyone&#039;s life.<br />And I&#039;m running out of reasons not to end it all.<br /><br />And even though I have only roughly 20 years of life experience, I can almost guarantee you that this pain is going to go away and after that you can look back at what happened and feel really good and strong about what you endured and withstood :)<br />Why am I writing all this? I don&#039;t know. Feels liberating in a funny way and this was kinda the right thread to write this.<br />What I originally wanted to say:<br />kitkat, I&#039;m wholeheartedly hoping that you&#039;re alive and physically okay. If you need any kind of advice or just a good ol&#039; shoulder to cry on and someone to listen to you, you can always PM me or email me at ballzinator@tormail.org.

				Also, are you sad because you worry about other people&#039;s happiness (&quot;Weltschmerz&quot;)? Or because you think nobody worries about yours (a subconscious egoic process)? Or maybe a combination of &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; pain?<br />If it&#039;s the latter (egoic pain), I highly recommend checking out the teachings of Eckhart Tolle on YouTube and maybe buy his book. Follow the link in my signature to the depression thread and check out the links there :)<br />If it&#039;s the former, you might just be giving too much of a fuck.<br />Not giving a fuck is awesome. Try it some time, do something crazy and out of the blue. People might giggle at you, but who gives a fuck? If people judge me for doing something wacko, I don&#039;t want anything to do with them anyway. It&#039;s like an idiot filter - if you do something nuts, cool people will respect you and idiots won&#039;t. The cool people will think you&#039;re awesome and the idiots will go home, watch three hours of reality TV and cry themselves to sleep because they&#039;re jealous of people like you who don&#039;t give a shit.

				I dont know kitkat, and I am somewhat new to SR, but I lost someone very close to me to suicide. I saw all the signs and warnings before it happened. I was too caught up in my own life to realize my friend was reaching out to me. One morning I had about 10 missed calls from my friends number and I knew what happened. I wish I would have just helped my buddy find help with his issues. Mental health is something everyone should take seriously. I hope that if kitkat is ok, she talks to a professional about her issues and considers getting on some kind of medication. I myself was also in a really dark place in my life and all it took to get me out of the rut was a prescription for a sublingual tablet taken before bedtime. The meds took about 4 days before I noticed a difference... but after 4 weeks my mind was clearer, I had a much brighter outlook, and I was for the first time in years grounded and happy to be alive. Please seek help if you are having suicidal or homicidal thoughts, or even if you just get angry easily. Its so much easier to live a happy life!

				I&#039;ve got no vested interest here and have no real understanding of kitkats situation and nor do I want too but I was quite shocked at some of the unhelpful comments posted in this thread. Everyone is entitled to an opinion but seriously whatever you may think about her just pause for a moment and consider what you are posting, sometimes if you can&#039;t say anything nice it&#039;s better to say nothing at all.<br /><br />She needs professional help and whatever her reasons for posting in here she is clearly reaching out for something be that support, advise, attention or whatever, she certainly doesn&#039;t need yet more pain and misery.<br /><br />At consider that before posting.<br /><br /><br /><br />

She wrote &quot;a 1/5 of Vodka&quot; though still correct, the proper way to write it would be a 5th of Vodka. Other liquors are sold in 5ths as well. <br />It&#039;s about 6 ounces shy of a quart. The size called &#039;a fifth&quot; means &#039;A fifth of a gallon&quot;, and goes back to the good old days before the metric system.&nbsp; So a little lesson for you there son.&nbsp; <br /><br />And to all the rest of you. who say &quot;WOW, JUST, WOW&quot;.&nbsp; And the haters, especially Meatgrinder (such a tough macho name), suggesting what sounds like gang rape, as a solution. You&#039;re all just inexperienced little potheads that don&#039;t know how to handle emotional situations,&nbsp; so you try to say something degrading or what you &#039;think&#039; is clever or badass. <br /><br />I&#039;ll impart a little wisdom to you all. It&#039;s an old saying, that is still used, and for good reason. <br /><br />If you haven&#039;t got something good to say, don&#039;t say anything. <br /><br />You impressed nobody, with your ignorance. The biggest disservice you did, was to yourselves, because in that one ignorant, not well thought out post, you revealed to the rest of us, what immature little <br /><br />brats we have in our midst. <br /><br />What drew you to this thread? Nothing better to do? <br /><br />I was drawn to it out of sympathy. Whether she was serious, or just wanted/needed attention. She sure didn&#039;t need your immature thoughtless negative comments. <br /><br />I was in that depressed state at one time. So I can sympathize with her. The last thing she needs is Alcohol and Benzos.&nbsp; I&#039;ve known plenty of people, who get a&nbsp; hold of their Valium Rx, or Dalmane, or whatever, and they take 2-3X&#039;s the prescribed amount. They almost all go into that &quot;I should just kill myself&quot; zone.&nbsp; They are depressants.You will get depressed if you take them. <br /><br />I&#039;d love to see how she does on Adderall. - I used to only want the Valium, and Xanax, from my doctor, and refused to take any more SSRI&#039;s&nbsp; (the biggest scam perpetrated on the public by Big Pharma)<br /><br />Finally my shrink tested me for Adult ADHD, and asked me to try Adderall. - I was like &quot;Speed? I&#039;m hyper enough as it is!&quot;&nbsp; After much discussion, and him pleading with me to just &quot;try&quot; it. I went home with some free samples. - Well that was the end of my depression. Two years ago I was ready to go sit on the train tracks. I had it all planned out, and didn&#039;t tell a soul. <br /><br />Now, at 50 something, I have more of a will to live than I ever remember having. I went through a pile of bills going back 2 years, and cleaned and painted my apartment. Just a complete turn around. <br />The weight loss was a nice side effect too. My high blood pressure is gone, and my cholesterol is normal. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s the answer for KitKat, but it&#039;s certainly worth a try!&nbsp; It&#039;s being used more and more &quot;off label&quot; for depression that is resistant to traditional &quot;zombie&quot; drugs, like Prozac and Zoloft. <br /><br />I hope she pulls out of it all, and if you&#039;re reading this KitKat, the next time you&#039;re feeling down. Please don&#039;t hesitate to come on and talk about it. If the little babies can&#039;t handle how uncomfortable real human emotions make them, hopefully they&#039;ll have the common sense to skip over the thread. <br /><br />Hang in there KitKat! and grow up you little newbie children. You obviously have a lot to learn about life, and really should look into your own psyche, to see if you can figure out why a sad girl, spilling her guts, makes you so uncomfortable. I think you people are the truly fucked up people.<br /><br />Though, I also believe there is hope, even for people like you. Perhaps a tragic event in your life will do it. Perhaps, you&#039;ll just mature, as you make your way in this world. <br /><br />I wish you all good luck. I know I was a little hard on a few of you, but you had it coming. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				Sad to see all this lack of compassion, as if some people were so disconnected from othe human beings that they could only have it with mdma or other drugs. For those who&#039;ve never experienced suicidal thoughts, I can assure you it&#039;s one of the most dreadful feelings in the world.

I have never been part of a forum of any kind and know very little of how things work on them, but for what ever the reason you caught my attention. i had seen your post back a few weeks ago and knew something was very bad for you and I waited and looked for your posts and nothing. i had hoped you were just taking sometime to clear your thoughts and I would soon see your posts. Well I did not want to see this. There is nothing I can say to change your thoughts and feelings towards life, but sometimes just knowing you have a positive effect on people you don&#039;t know and the most important on your family can make you realize that ending your pain causes all those around you to endure a much greater one. I fight through life to survive for my kids, and hope that some day I will not be fighting life but enjoying it. I know there is no promise from anyone that can&#039;t be broken, but you can promise to fight through life and deal with the pain to keep from causing those that love you will not have to burden the pain of losing you to yourself. Be well and I will be looking for your witty posts sometime down the road.

				Very well said, BlueGiraffe. Like you, I&#039;m not an opponent of the idea of suicide in general. For example when someone is very sick without reasonable chance of cure and the pain from the sickness just makes their life unbearable. That&#039;s a case where a suicide is totally fine in my book. Maybe I&#039;d even go as far as assisting such a person with their suicide.<br /><br />But kitkat&#039;s case is clearly not of that nature so kitkat, don&#039;t kill yourself! From what I&#039;ve seen of you on the forums, you&#039;re a wonderful person and your death would be a loss to not only this community, but to the whole of humanity. One good person like you killing themselves shifts the ratio of good and bad people on this planet toward the bad people. And I&#039;d hate that to happen.<br />So please, for the sake of yourself, your family and friends, the SR community and mankind in its entirety, try getting back on your feet and don&#039;t kill yourself. As soon as you recognize your own awesomeness you will develop a healthy &quot;fuck you&quot; attitude toward anything trying to bring you down. So hang in there okay? :)

And that is that death is not the end of anything. Anyone who has tripped deeply and paid attention, or who has been engaged in serious spiritual practice, knows this to be true.<br /><br />And you will also see that I never suggested that she &quot;will suffer eternally&quot; - those are your words. I said that she will still need to deal with herself (whether before or after death) and take responsibility for the causes of her suffering. If she can have a have a tacit insight into understanding that death does not actually &quot;work&quot; as a solution to emotional/psychic/existential pain, then maybe she won&#039;t be so quick to choose that option.<br /><br />Ultimately all our pain is self-caused, and we are the ones who have the power to become free of that. Death seems like a way out but it isn&#039;t. If knowing this, someone still consciously choose to exit this world, then major respect and blessing to them.<br /><br />My gut tells me though that KitKat is looking for another solution that does not involve death. That&#039;s why she&#039;s on this forum telling us about it and is why she&#039;s still alive.

				I think it&#039;s fair enough to bring up the possibility that death isn&#039;t just lights out, but wrong to say that you know it.&nbsp; Ultimately though I think bluegiraffe&#039;s intentions are to help kitkat deal with her problems in a way that isn&#039;t killing herself which is well meaning.<br /><br />I also apologise for speaking in third person KK.&nbsp; Hope you&#039;re improving and overcome this (you will), same goes to anyone reading this who&#039;s feeling shit or suicidal.

Psychedelics DO open your perception, it&#039;s just how you interpret the things they open you to that will determine your sanity. I can think of one person in particular who I know, who was never quite stable anyhow, but when he started taking psychedelics, he viewed them as proof for god. Long story short, you can&#039;t figure out anything on psychedelics that you couldn&#039;t sober, they are only the fast-track to realization. <br /><br />Back on topic, feel better kk. I told someone who was going through severe depression awhile back, &quot;if you can&#039;t be happy sober, then you shouldn&#039;t take drugs because it only leads to greater disparity in happiness between sober &amp; high.&quot; I don&#039;t know if this applies directly to you -- but anything I can do to help.

				I think what I have learned from all of this is that a members status is not based at all off of the content of their words. I am guessing it is based off of number of posts, because some of these SR members and above have said some very rude and unexpected things.<br />I have know idea what KitKat is going through, and I am no real church goer but I once heard a pastor say &quot;If you are going through hell, keep going eventually you will make it out&quot; I also truly believe that you cant lose forever. In my psychology class my teacher was teaching us about downward comparisons. Once you have been in an extremely situation all of your life when something bad happens you can see &quot;at least im not there anymore&quot; for instance ranger school in the Army is the toughest thing any human will ever willing go through, and when my instructor was in Afghanistan he would say damn at least I am not in Ranger school.<br />So Kit Kat I am happy you made it out of this, keep going and once your better you will look back on this and be happy.<br />I don&#039;t know how much different drugs you do but maybe some of this can have an effect. DO whats best for yourself whether that means not doing drugs, or finding one that helps to heal you.

				Ok, I logged on to read the last few messages I have and delete my account...but I can&#039;t pretend not to be upset and hurt by a lot of the negative comments saying I am making shit up or attention seeking, using my gender....for what, a little attention/?&nbsp; Because I am a lonely person, and making fun of me for that?&nbsp; WTF is wrong with people.&nbsp; Obviously a sick person does what I do.&nbsp; So why kick me when I am down?!?.&nbsp; So to the people who seem to be total assholes about this....Why don&#039;t you listen up to what the deal is.<br /><br /><br />I have a personality disorder, been confirmed and reconfirmed for 11 years by many psychologists and psychiatrists called Borderline Personality Disorder....it makes it near impossible when I am untreated for me to control my impulses, and I do 100% mean what I say when I say it, but don&#039;t realize that it is attention seeking or that I am trying to push people away or whatever.&nbsp; So when I say I took an overdose, then I actually did.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really have a whole lot of control when I get in that frantic state of mind, and I do make posts or phone calls to people that are attention seeking, but not intentionally, if that makes sense?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an active control or awareness of these behaviors. It&#039;s not like &quot;Oh I am lonely, let me act like a whiny bitch&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br /><br /><br />If I have a friend who says they are going to call me at 8 or if my sister says she is going to meet me for lunch and cancels, I get deeply hurt, I have an inability to see a grey area, and I internalize and make everything personal.&nbsp; So whatever....you may call it attention seeking and sneer at me....but it is pretty much my illness...and it&#039;s actually called para suicidal behavior, which often ends in many cases with completed suicide.&nbsp; So fuck off if you can&#039;t be a little kind to someone who has never felt a moment of personal peace in 30 years.<br /><br />http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION=symptoms<br /><br />Impulsive and risky behavior, such as risky driving, unsafe sex, gambling sprees or illegal drug use<br />Awareness of destructive behavior, including self-injury, but sometimes feeling unable to change it<br />Wide mood swings<br />Short but intense episodes of anxiety or depression<br />Inappropriate anger and antagonistic behavior, sometimes escalating into physical fights<br />Difficulty controlling emotions or impulses<br />Suicidal behavior<br />Feeling misunderstood, neglected, alone, empty or hopeless<br />Fear of being alone<br />Feelings of self-hate and self-loathing<br />When you have borderline personality disorder, you often have an insecure sense of who you are. Your self-image, self-identity or sense of self often rapidly changes. You may view yourself as evil or bad, and sometimes you may feel as if you don&#039;t exist at all. An unstable self-image often leads to frequent changes in jobs, friendships, goals and values.<br /><br />Your relationships are usually in turmoil. You may idealize someone one moment and then abruptly and dramatically shift to fury and hate over perceived slights or even minor misunderstandings. This is because people with borderline personality disorder often have difficulty accepting gray areas — things seem to be either black or white.
