				i get unjustifiably pissed off sometimes. it&#039;s not a result of any other drug abuse, just life. smoking a j somewhere quiet sorts me right out but when i&#039;m all out i tend to take diazepam/valium because it&#039;s all i have. any ideas for more effective and less addictive pharma alternatives to have on standby? it&#039;s not usually a really regular occurrence maybe every couple of weeks i feel like ripping my skin off, screaming and crying all at the same time. it&#039;s pretty intense. i wanna be sedated. saying that 20mg and some good tunes has chilled me out now but any other suggestions very welcome.

				<br />&nbsp;are you bipolar? do you have any sort of mental illness in your family? <br />Could this be withdrawal?<br />maybe you should tell your doctor about this! he`ll sort you out proper. That`s his job. <br />&nbsp;

				no i&#039;m not bipolar but i can see why you&#039;d think that from what i said. personally suffer depression mainly and anxiety to a lesser extent. my brothers the same but way more anxious than depressed. my parents have said there&#039;s no family history but my dad is an alcoholic in denial, lies constantly and lacks awareness so i think it&#039;s quite possible.<br />i need to register with a doctor first... kinda apprehensive about going to them about mental health stuff though, last time my gf made an appt and marched me down cause i was suicidal and they gave me citalopram. it made it 100x worse and a nice tremor to go with. vowed to stay away from anti depressants from then :-\

				Edibles are a damn good idea. Definitely stay away from antidepressants, Ive only seen them exasperate aggression. For the rage that you describe I find that having a good physical vent is really beneficial. Try to figure out what it is in your life that pisses you off... could it be reactive to your anxiety? Like a fight/flight response? Or is it based on a deeper dissatisfaction with your life?<br />Even with depression negative emotions have a root issue. If you have dealt with all of your possible issues and you still feel an empty sadness or anger, then its medication time. Just remember to be 100% honest with yourself and you&#039;ll work it all out eventually. <br />In the meantime.. pot.

				Nearly the exact same story here, Ron. Almost as if I had posted it.. lol. It is something that is in my family history, through a few generations. I am currently trying different medications for this and citalopram is checked off the list.. Good luck and as mentioned, it never hurts to have herbal relaxation.&nbsp; 8)

				i&#039;m so skint i can barely afford the weed i smoke, don&#039;t know how i&#039;d ever have enough to make edibles. i really want to though. i wish people in the uk sold trim cheap for this... i should stop being a twat and use my vape then use vaped bud.<br />i think it&#039;s down to the lack of control and dissatisfaction over every single aspect of my life. the anger will always have an obvious trigger though, usually inescapable loud noise as pathetic as that may sound. when i was in my teens i&#039;d get claustrophobic at the same time and just go out for a long cycle which did help a lot. it&#039;s been getting more frequent recently which could be because i started smoking tobacco again after quitting for a year. definitely need to stop again soon, i&#039;m sweet after day 4 nicotine withdrawal..<br />looked into kratom on erowid, it sounds horrible! why do people use it?! if it is linked to opiates they really don&#039;t agree with me.<br />was looking for something different to cannabis, i lack self control when i got that lovely stuff around and smoke it all. naughty. i&#039;d use it for everything if i could but it&#039;s quite expensive in the uk.

				What you describe can be a difficult problem, but it could also come from a simple deficiency in magnesium and/or B6 vitamins. Not enough of those in what we routinely eat or drink. You could try taking magnesium and B6 supplements for a month and see if it improves anything. It can&#039;t hurt and doesn&#039;t interact with your drugs. It can be found OTC everywhere. At least, I hope no country has went as far as to schedule or outlaw Magnesium and vitamins...

				It could also be a symptom of being pissed off in general, sometimes for good reason.<br /><br />Taking sedatives can give you some short term relieve, which is fine for short periods of time.<br /><br />On the long run i think it will be more complex though - you need to figure out what makes you so angry and how to escape from that. Of course that is far more easily said than done, but it may be worth some more thought. <br /><br />

				I was having a problem with depression and &quot;rage&quot;, and yes they were there before my introduction to drugs.<br /><br />Then I started exercise, and meditation.&nbsp; It&#039;s only an hour ~3 days a week, but makes a night and day difference on how I feel the rest of the week.&nbsp; I am far less likely to have a spike in attitude.<br /><br />Dedicate some time to &quot;rage out&quot; at a gym or something.&nbsp; If you burn it out of you there is less fuel for that later.<br /><br />If meditation isn&#039;t your thing, find something to just be quiet with for like 10-15 min.&nbsp; I feel kinda silly about this but I have been enjoying a lot of ASMR videos on youtube.&nbsp; If I find the right one it really puts me out of my head, and give my brain a good reset. <br /><br />Edit: I forgot gyms cost money.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there.&nbsp; I made &quot;kettle bells&quot; out of gravel and grocery bags.&nbsp; There are a crazy amount of kettle bell work outs on youtube as well.<br /><br />I am pretty bad with having weed around as well.&nbsp; It got easier to make smarter choices if I told myself I must do &quot;x&quot; and then I can smoke.&nbsp; (like go work out and then blaze)

				I also use benzos for stress relief, but as im sure youre aware overuse of them makes thing alot worse - I&#039;ve been there and can tell you its not good. In short theres no chemical solutions to spiritual problems, something I&#039;ve learnt over the years. Do you exercise? I find if I&#039;m pissed off that a proper workout relieves stress very effectively. Going out and running for a half hour clears the mind.

				there&#039;s this stuff called kanna, or Sceltium tortuosum, that is a really mellow mood enhancer/sedative. they&#039;ve been using it for centuries in (south?) africa and it is widely available and as far as I know, legal almost everywhere. you can get extracts from&nbsp; clearnet sites for cheap. you can put it on weed too, as well as directly under your tongue or in your mouth. it is said to be very complimentary with reefer..&nbsp; and i also heard it is a very nice addition to mescaline. you might look into making a mescaline brew every once in a while with san pedro, which is also widely available. either way, i know it&#039;s not an earth shattering solution, but it is natural, spiritual, and helpful. it has certainly helped me out on a shitty day. and kratom, like people said, is like an opiate. which means you feel similar after effects. if you do enough kratom (in my experience) to really feel high, you don&#039;t always feel so good the next day, which is obviously something you would want to avoid. i would honestly look into getting some kanna extract from a reputable vendor though, that would be cost effective to at least try
