				Last week I order 4 of them from jackrabbit31 (HIGHLY RECOMMEND). My Experience with MDMA started about 2 months ago. I bought one and took it. All I got to say is AMAZING. Or I got 4 more the next week. Took one Thursday Evening&gt;Effect was great and lasting. Took one Friday Evening&gt;Effect was just as good as Thursday. Took the third one Saturday afternoon and didn&#039;t feel anything like i felt the other days. My eyes were dilated and&nbsp; felt &quot;something&quot; but nothing as mentioned before. Took the last one same day (Saturday) at about 3ish, eyes became dilated but still nothing. Just that &quot;I felt something&quot; feeling. Any recommendations on how I&#039;m handling this. Thanks guys!

				ok here is your answer : NEVER take mdma more than once a month. Its gonna kill your brain on the long term man. I am in no way saying that pure mdma is lethal for you but theres has been studies of people taking mdma 5 days in a row , and on the 5th day they almost felt to effect. This is the reason why u almost felt nothing on the 3rd day. I HIGHLY invite you to visit www.bluelight.ru for more harm prevention. But yeah .... the best option would be to always wait 1 to 3 month because the longer you wait the better it is. Its all about the serotonins in your brain. See it as a bucket full of water. Everytime you take MDMA , there is water(serotonins) drainning out of your bucket of water(your brain). You need to give it time to get back to 100% before taking some mdma to be sure that there is no damage to your brain ! Maybe its sound wierd to say this on this forum , but there is nothing more important then your brain my friend :)

				Sorry, but I told you pretty much the same thing as wub did on another thread you have because someone mentioned that you took mdma four times in one week. Be safe, know your substances, &amp; know your body!
