				Hello everyone. I might end up buying some MDMA someday for fun (rare personal use). I was pretty sold on Skyy&#039;s pills, as I&#039;ve heard good things about packaging, even if it is from the Netherlands. Now I see it&#039;s better (value wise) to get crystals or powders. Is it as easy to take them? I do NOT have a scales, which is mainly the reason for pills - I can just take them. But suppose I get a scales.. Is it effective/easy to crush it up and parachute? As easy and satisfying as a pill? <br /><br />

				I used to not weigh my doses. What I did was dip my finger in the baggy, put it in my mouth and wash it away with some drink. I&#039;d do this throughout the party, which would get the desired results. I&#039;ve learned since than: I understand this method is not so good for your teeth and also I&#039;ve got scales by now ;). Now I&#039;d recommend parachuting or getting capsules to take it. Also easier at parties.<br /><br />As for dosing without scales: In that case just guess based on the total amount by splitting it in a couple of equal piles (6 for ~165mg, if you have a gram). Maybe even split those piles again to make redose-capsules. If your gonna use drugs more than twice or so, I&#039;d really recommend getting good .01g scales. I&#039;ve got one pretty good and cheap from dealextreme.com.<br /><br />For how satisfying MDMA crystals are: I find them a little more mellow than pills, but generally I don&#039;t really notice a big difference. It really depends on what kind of pills you&#039;ve used before (what they had in them, next to MDMA) and the quality of the crystals you&#039;re going to use (they are also probably cut with other stuff).

				Thanks. For some reason splitting it into even piles never occurred to me.. I guess I&#039;m over thinking it. <br /><br />You say you got scales from dealextreme? Is that accurate do you know? ( I wouldn&#039;t have thought it is, but maybe!)

				I had my concerns as well, but they&#039;re definitely accurate. Tested it by weighing money (which has known weights, check out wikipedia) and by comparing it to the scales of a friend. Also get a weight to calibrate the thing (which will also tell you if it&#039;s accurate or not). I got this one, btw: http://www.dealextreme.com/p/precision-digital-pocket-scale-100g-max-0-01g-resolution-15002<br /><br />Something else to keep in mind: you don&#039;t have to be extremely accurate with MDMA. Difference between 180mg and 200mg is not very noticeable. Some other drugs (like 2C-*) require very small dosages and fuck you up if you overdo them, so they really require that you weigh them properly. MDMA just makes you happier if you take too much (OD&#039;ing impossible).

				That&#039;s excellent - thanks. I&#039;d just be weighing weed and MDMA for the time being, so that should be perfect.<br /><br />I understand that it wouldn&#039;t necessarily harm me. I&#039;d be more concerned with weighing products when you get them and the scales says you got half of what you ordered (or double). But you&#039;re right; I can just calibrate it/test it with known weights. Thanks man :D

				C&#039;mon, man, don&#039;t say ODing is impossible. It most certainly is. It&#039;s less likely than certain other chemicals, though.

Fuck you can OD on table salt or lol.<br /><br />As for the weighing and pile separation. As you get more experienced with MDMA you will find that you can play with your roll rather accurately once you get the hang of how your body responds. 120mg now with a 50mg booster 90 minutes later is an entirely different experience than 170mg at once. So definitely a nice precision scale.<br /><br />As for someone mentioning &quot;finger dipping&quot; above, how the hell would you cope with this nasty fucking rotten chemical taste in your mouth all night?<br /><br />When I get crystals, I have to put them&nbsp; in pill shells or something because the taste of dissolved MDMA alone is so nasty it starts fucking with my roll. Seriously, it&#039;s on of the most disgusting tasting drugs there is...

				You could dissolve the MDMA in water, then measure out the doses in a syringe.&nbsp; I think you would have to use distilled water, though.

If you crush em, they taste much worse. Also, very sugary drinks help to wash it away (I used to take a little bit of the drink in my mouth, put my dipped finger in and kinda dissolve it).<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13104.msg126761#msg126761">Quote from: Locrian on February 26, 2012, 02:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think you would have to use distilled water, though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Distilled water is really only something you want if you don&#039;t want the minerals and other stuff that&#039;s in regular water. Normally you use it where you don&#039;t want want a build of those minerals (like a steam iron) or where you don&#039;t want those minerals to interact with whatever chemical you&#039;re adding (which is why distilled water is used in many experiments).<br /><br />So I believe that you can just use regular drinking water. Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.
