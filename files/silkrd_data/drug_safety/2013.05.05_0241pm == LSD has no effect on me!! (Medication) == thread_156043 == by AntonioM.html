				Hey guys,<br /><br />I got a rather curious problem...<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered Gandalfs,Hoffmans and acid raspberries from known vendors and I&#039;ve eaten enough of it to fly to the moon with ABSOLUTELY ZERO EFFECT!!!!!&nbsp; I wrote to one vendor to ask him wether there was something wrong wqith his blotter but due to the amount and variety I&#039;ve taken I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that it must be the warfarin I&#039;m on.... <br />it&#039;s not an SSRI but an Anticoagulant since I had a blood clot in the lung last year.I get no effecty at all from acid and I&#039;m certain it isn&#039;t bunk since it&#039;s from various vendors and different prints. Has anyone heard about warfarin and acid being a problem? Does warfarin neutralize LSD?? <br /><br />I&#039;m stumped tbh....&nbsp; :o

I have no experience of LSD &amp; warfarin, but...<br /><br />Had you ever taken LSD before the blood clot?<br /><br />When you say absolutely zero effect do you really mean that? No discernible effects at all?<br /><br />How much of each type of LSD have you taken?<br /><br />Did you take it straight away, or store it? (Incorrect storage can ruin LSD)

				Hey,<br />thanks for the answer... I&#039;ve taken acid loads of time before the clot,mainly in the 90&#039;s .Indeed I have felt absolutely nothing after eating 2 Gandalf&#039;s,2 Hoffmann&#039;s and 5 LSD raspberrys!&nbsp; :P&nbsp; ZIP!!! I just can&#039;t get my head around it.I basically ate them within hours of arrival,there shouldn&#039;t have been any storage problems at all. I&#039;ve asked DoctorX in the drug safety forum and he says there is no interaction between acid and warfarin!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Short of dropping 5 trips at a time to see if that helps,I&#039;m really clueless here....&nbsp; &nbsp;the cid came from JOR,Haizenberg and Mahakala,all good,reliable vendors!&nbsp; could all their product be bunk?? What&#039;s going on here,I&#039;m really not sure what to think.......&nbsp; ???

Try again one more time. maybe you need some of JORs TOC liquid LSD in a vial!!&nbsp; I would PM JOR and see what they say, they are experienced and friendly enough.<br /><br />Maybe someone can help, sorry I can&#039;t.<br /><br /><br />Talking of the 90s, I remember taking 2/3 of a Bart Simpson in the 90&#039;s and losing nigh on 12 hours. I cannot fathom how you would have no effect from 2-5 tabs.

				Hmmm that is interesting.<br /><br />I know benzodiazepines deters and diminishes the effects of LSD but never read of the Warfarin connection.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken LSD four times in my life and I haven&#039;t experienced any noteworthy effects either. Gutted as I won&#039;t have the opportunity to try again!

				Many different drugs interact with the metabolism of warfarin (making you bleed more easily) but warfarin doesn&#039;t generally lead to other drugs not working properly so this is interesting.<br /><br />If this was a one off lung clot you&#039;ll probably just be on warfarin but if not or you had hypertension or anything else then the doctors might have put you on some other things which might also be interacting. Are you on any other medication?<br /><br />To be honest though I can&#039;t see how this would be happening since as long as the LSD gets into your blood it should work.

				Don&#039;t feel bad about not successfully tripping with the amount of acid you&#039;ve been taking, maybe a higher dose would work? I trip very easy off of LSD and shrooms but the only thing about shrooms is it leaves me with the worse fucking headache ever if I have more than 1 gram, completely turns me off from using them. <br /><br />Believe me it bums me out because shrooms are so easy to obtain without SR yet I can&#039;t enjoy them, yet acid is so kind to my body yet I can&#039;t make it myself and have no connects in real life. <br /><br />Fortunately SR exists though so like other people have suggested I would try some different psychedelics (shrooms, mescaline or dmt) and see what that does for you, you may absolutely fall in love with one of them and forget all about the fact that LSD has been letting you down.
