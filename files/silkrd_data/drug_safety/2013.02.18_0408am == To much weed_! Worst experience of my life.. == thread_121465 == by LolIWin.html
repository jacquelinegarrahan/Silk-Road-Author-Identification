				Alright guys so here&#039;s the deal. This happened about a month ago but it was when I didn&#039;t have enough posts to start a topic. I just remembered it and I thought I&#039;d share. Has this happened to anyone else before? This is a text from me to my friend but it pretty much sums up the night..<br /><br />So last night I probably had the worst experience of my life. Like it was terrible. I was at That Zach kids house in gb and he had this big bong. I&#039;ve never really ripped a big bong before and took this huge hit right off he bat. Like terribly bad. I was coughin for like 5 minutes bad. I took like 2 other hits then we had to leave. I got picked to drive and I was already pretty high but we got in the car and I couldn&#039;t get my gps to work and we were sitting there for like 10 minutes and finally my friend did and I pulled out and I couldn&#039;t even see at this point. I was like freaking out and I think it started there I was like questioning life and what I was doing with it that I really shouldn&#039;t be driving and it started to freak me out and I was asking Justin and Zach if they were as high as me and I was seriously tripping. Like I couldn&#039;t see and all of a sudden my dad calls and I talked to him for a whole and don&#039;t even remember what I said. I was so worried he knew something was up that I like started panicking in my head kinda and I started wondering if this really was life. Like its weird to talk about now but it felt like I wasn&#039;t in my body, that I like unlocked this whole nother part of me that I&#039;ve never been to before and it was bad. I didn&#039;t like it. I thought that the rest of my life was gonna be like this and I was wondering if my life had been like this before and I just hadn&#039;t realized it before. I was thinking like that the entire time we were driving. I couldn&#039;t think about anything else. I would try to think about like school but I COULD NOT do it. I couldn&#039;t. Like my mind wouldn&#039;t realize that I had even been to school before. This was all in my head though cause I was trying to act chill for the dudes around me. But I like kept thinking like that and I have no idea how I drove. We finally got to the place and I was still tripping out. We went inside and it was a little apartment but I didn&#039;t know any of the people there and it just didnt seem real. I didn&#039;t think any of them were there. I thought I was like hallucinating and I hated it. Bad. I laid down on the couch and closed my eyes and nothing seemed real. Then it got really bad..like I started thinking that while I was driving I got in a car crash and my mind couldn&#039;t comprehend it so I was really hallucinating and I was actually in a ambulance and they were trying to revive me but they couldn&#039;t and I was like on the brink of death and I was going to wake up and be all bloody and my parents would be so ashamed and the whole time on the couch that&#039;s all I was thinking about. It was terrible. The worst feeling ever. I seriously believed that&#039;s what happened and I found myself like crushing my tounge around in my mouth and I didn&#039;t even know. I thought the pain was in the ambulance and I was just barely feeling it. It was so weird. So undescribable. Finally after like an hour of laying there the peak went away and I felt a little better and walked around and eventually it all went away but that&#039;s what was going on in my head. It was the worst thing that&#039;s ever happened to me.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s long but I wanted to tell it all. Tell me what you think..thanks.

				Pot has a reputation for being relatively harmless, but it&#039;s important to remember that it&#039;s certainly possible to have a bad trip. Hopefully you won&#039;t push your limits so far in the future.

				I think you were in the wrong frame of mind and you got a big hit and your mind lead you astray.&nbsp; Did you get anything meaningful out of the experience?&nbsp; Did you get any insights?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this is any indication that you are doomed to bad experiences on weed.&nbsp; Do some short-term testing to find out!

I smoked with some friends last night and I was fine. And no, no insight at all, just a horrible experience. It kind of seems fake when I try to remember it. Like it was all a dream.

				Yeah so the moral of the story is unless you grew the bud and packed the bowl yourself you really have no idea what you smoked. You should Google some pictures of Angle Dust or Opium Laced Weed. Since your reaction was so far off baseline for almost every pot smoker out there, including yourself, I&#039;m just gonna guess there was some other variable at play there.

				This does sound laced, but I&#039;ve had &quot;way too high&quot; experiences from clean weed too. It&#039;s possible you&#039;ll react negatively to weed for a while: Some people don&#039;t react well to it, and some develop a negative reaction (Like,, were fine smoking for a year or several, but it suddenly starts affecting them badly)<br /><br />Good luck man, sorry it went so badly.

				I wouldn&#039;t be too quick to jump to conclusions as far as the laced weed, I have never once came across or hardly even heard of weed that&#039;s been laced. People pay more for that shit because it costs more to lace weed with a psychoactive drug like pcp, opium, coke..<br /><br />Sounds like you just let your paranoia get the best of you. The mind is a very powerful thing, you can convince yourself of anything.

				True it is possible, but don&#039;t you think that the effects of opium are not really consistent with his report? Sounds a lot closer to PCP to m, even though I&#039;ve never had personal experience with it. <br /><br />However, if it was laced with anything, then it definitely does have the possibility of causing this panic attack or whatever you want to call it. Smoking laced weed without knowing it is basically like having your brain raped, you did not mean to ingest any drug besides pot so the effects can be extremely negative; just like how rape is compared to having consensual sex, except on a completely different level of course

				May I suggest never trying potent shrooms... Sounds like your mind might overload easily. In the future I might try working up to things at your own pace, wouldn&#039;t want a bad trip to ruin the fun of a particular drug for good. Happened to a friend of mine who smoked weed mixed with salvia for her first time without realize salvia was involved. Now every time she smells weed she gets paranoid and starts having flashbacks. Take it easy, relax, enjoy it and make your friends drive if you have to!

It seems like he&#039;s satisfied that he just got a weird high off it which is probably all it was. I just wanted to toss out there that anyone can put anything in a bowl for you to smoke and sometimes it isn&#039;t what you think it might be.

I actually believe I&#039;m trying shrooms next weekend. I&#039;ll see how it goes. If it is a bad experience I&#039;ll probably stay away from psychedelics and stuff that will change my state of mind easily.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that I just basically trapped myself into a paranoia and kept thinking more and more negative causing the situation to get worse and worse. If I wasn&#039;t driving the vehicle I probably would have been in a better condition...just worried myself into a state of panic.<br /><br />Weird thing is I&#039;ve driven when I&#039;ve smoked wayyy more than that?<br /><br />The closest thing I&#039;ve come to this before was smoking weed like 4-5 hours after taking MDMA with this girl and we both had some crazy hallucinations. I think our minds just visualized them, not even from the substances. We just talked ourselves into having them. Idk..it was also a weird night. lol.
