				Take the whole bar if you want to get pretty fucked up.&nbsp; However, it being your first time, maybe try only half (1mg), then after an hour the other half if you feel the need to.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t take more then that your first time.&nbsp; You might not be able to remember anything the next day.&nbsp; Of course everyone is different, but I find this to be true with a lot of Xanax users.<br /><br />Also, no need to snort it.&nbsp; Taking it orally works just fine.

				Take a half mg.&nbsp; Anymore and you will just sleep (or zombie) thru it.&nbsp; I guess it depends on the effect you are looking for.&nbsp; If you are just looking to relax, and chill, .5 w/ no tolerance will get you there.&nbsp; I use them semi regularly (like a few times per week, after stressful days), and .5 gets me where I need to be.&nbsp; Anymore, I blow a grand at the casino, or wake up on my couch.&nbsp;

				Naturally you&#039;re bound to get a mixed bag of recommendations on this question.<br /><br />The time of day really affected the results I got from Xanax.&nbsp; The first time I tried it, I took half a bar (1Mg) at lunch time, and had a good head-high,&nbsp; A friend picked me up at the airport and dropped the half totem-pole in my hands and told me to eat it; I did.<br /><br />We then went for lunch and eventually back to her house.&nbsp; After getting to her pad, I unpacked my stuff, and met her back in the living room.&nbsp; I asked her &#039;When are we going to eat lunch, I&#039;m starving!?&quot;<br /><br />She laughed and told me &#039;you&#039;re prob. feeling pretty good, huh?&quot;&nbsp; I replied &#039;yeah&#039;. and she told me that we had lunch after picking me up from the airport!<br /><br />I could take 2Mg in the morning and early afternoon without a problem but if I took 2Mg after normal work hours I would pass out in an hour or two at most.<br /><br />What worked for me was a lunch time pill on an empty stomach.&nbsp; I&#039;d feel the effects within 20 minutes or so, and full strength at an hour into it.<br /><br />As a note, if I had any beer/alcohol I&#039;d have absolutely NO memory from the time I ingested.&nbsp; If I had more than 2 beers, I&#039;d pass out after 2-1/2 hours or so, so be careful what you do after you start.

				This is how i look at it. How much is going to be enough to get me comfortable while using as little as substance as possible. If a first time user, i would recommend taking .5 mg. Break the bar in half, then break that half in half. Why take more to build tolerance quicker and risk the chance of addiction. Also, blacking out isn&#039;t fun. Which i know of a lot of people who do too often with xanax because they want the initial buzz again which leads to them taking more. Before they know it, they have blacked out and most likely leads to them taking even more. <br /><br />Xanax will always have a special place in my heart, but it is highly addictive and hard to quit. Just keep that in mind. <br /><br />So, take the smallest dose possible to reach desired effects. Otherwise that one night of fun, has potential to turn&nbsp; into a binge. (Which you don&#039;t have to worry about if you only got one bar.)<br /><br />

				Snorting benzos never worked and never will because they&#039;re not water soluble. <br />You might get some effect since there&#039;s some dripping down your throat.

				Xanax is a waste if you snort it. You get more out of it by just eating them. Snorting fillers is bad for the nose. But, you have to snort at least one xanax in your life. But, i&#039;m also the type of person that has snorted most drugs at least once. But, i have found snorting xanax is wasteful.

				I have a bar that I&#039;m taking tonight. I&#039;m used to taking 1-2mg of Klonopin per day... so I&#039;m wondering if I should just go ahead and take the whole bar at once, or divide in half. Wasn&#039;t planning on taking any Klonopin today.<br /><br />Suggestions?

				I guess it completely depends on what you want to achieve.<br /><br />If you take xanax to reduce anxiety or to get to sleep, half the bar will probably be plenty, and if you plan to go out in public when taking it to reduce anxiety i&#039;d even suggest taking only a quarter on the first attempt. <br /><br />If the goal is to zone out a bit you can take the whole thing easily, as long as you are at home or confident that you&#039;ll end up in a safe place if you were to pass out a bit. 2 mg of alprazolam will not knock you to the ground propofol-style in any case, but there is a decent risk of amnesia, especially when combined with alcohol.

				I ended up taking half the bar, then the other half about 45 minutes later. Had a few beers as well. Just made me relaxed. I guess my Dr.&#039;s had me on Klonopin so long that I have a really high tolerance. It was still a laid back night though, so no complaints!&nbsp; :)

				Cross tolerance for virtually all benzo&#039;s is pretty strong indeed. <br /><br />I&#039;d still suggest caution when combining benzo&#039;s with alcohol though. The risk isnt increadibly great, but it could cause respiratory depression and end badly. Just having a relaxed night out would be the typical outcome if you already developed tolerance, but there are no guarantees with these things.
