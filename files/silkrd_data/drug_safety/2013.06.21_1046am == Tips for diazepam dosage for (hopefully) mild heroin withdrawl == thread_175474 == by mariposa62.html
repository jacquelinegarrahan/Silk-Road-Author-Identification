				Been on about a 8 day binge at low to moderate doses after a 25-year layoff.&nbsp; Was using hatter26&#039;s cold shoot gear.&nbsp; I had a 500ml vial so now you know what I&#039;m calling low to moderate doses (after 25 years).&nbsp; I happen to have in my possession a stash of (quite a few) 5mg diazepam which I&#039;ve always heard were good for WD.&nbsp; Anyone got any experience with what doses to take, timing, any other tips?&nbsp; It has been a magical few days, but all good things must end.&nbsp; At least for a month or so......

				Valium mostly removes shaking and things related to muscle tension and spasms. You can take loperamide to control your withdrawals better and take the valium to sleep. Take maybe 10mg a night for 5 days, and as much loperamide as you need.. An 8 day binge shouldn&#039;t give you too much withdrawals.

				Thanks, exactly the sort of info I was looking for.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think it would be too bad, but I was wondering if I was kidding myself.&nbsp; I will report back in a couple of weeks.

				And thanks to all for not flaming a&nbsp; newbie!&nbsp; I kinda feel like it might have been a dumb question in the first place, but if you can&#039;t come here to learn a thing or two, then why bother?&nbsp; Right?

				Well your question wasn&#039;t dumb and hasn&#039;t been answered 100 times before on these forums so nobody would flame you for asking that! I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;re only gonna get some cravings though and no real physical withdrawals.. The valium would help with the cravings but only take it if really needed, when you can avoid taking drugs for no reason it&#039;s better to do so! <br /><br />You can take Loperamide (OTC) with a lot of tonic water to control physical withdrawal and psychological ones as well. The tonic water (quinine) makes the lope active in your brain, it can kind of get you high if you take enough but it&#039;s not very pleasant, mostly tiredness. You&#039;d need a lot of both though. <br /><br />Tell me how it went!

				You&#039;re gonna be TOTALLY fine. I doubt you will WD. If you feel uncomfortable, just pop 10mg.<br /><br />No worries, man. You&#039;re golden. Glad you had a good week!

				Thanks, guys!&nbsp; I had no idea about the loperamide, although it does make a certain sense.&nbsp; Give you a report soon.

				Thanks man, I appreciate the thought.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t enter into it lightly or without a great deal of deliberation.&nbsp; Most people would probably say that the smartest thing to do would be to just stay away and they would probably be right.&nbsp; But I came to the conclusion that those were some experiences that I really missed and that I would like to bring back in a very controlled manner.&nbsp; There was a lot of good and a lot of bad to my life with heroin when I was in my 20&#039;s.&nbsp; I may be fooling myself, but I would like to believe that with life experience and maturity I can approach this in a way that will maximize the positive and minimize the neg.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see how it goes.&nbsp; I am placing a premium on safety, both healthwise and from LE.&nbsp; It seems to be off to a good start!

				I&#039;m in my 20s and use heroin periodically. No dependence. Just gotta be smart. Just wish I had some now lmao.<br /><br />How was that heroin? I was thinking of picking up a vial in a couple months when I have more bitcoins.

				I thought it was good.&nbsp; I wish I had thought it through a little more, I would have bought 250 ml instead of 500 ml.&nbsp; Only because I didn&#039;t really consider the factor of how stable this would be in solution, how it&#039;s potency will hold up with the passage of time, etc.&nbsp; And I can&#039;t seem to get a definitive answer on the subject, so I&#039;m doing the only reasonable thing.&nbsp; Consuming it all!&nbsp; But it seems potent, I&#039;m getting a nice blast from it and it seems to have legs.&nbsp; Keep in mind, though, I&#039;ve been away from it for a long time.&nbsp; I will also say that this cold shoot in the vial is sooooo very convenient.&nbsp; No mixing, cooking, etc.&nbsp; I have no problem giving it a hearty recommendation.

				It&#039;ll be perfectly stable in the vial, do not worry.<br /><br />Thanks, I&#039;ll be checking this guy out. How much do you shoot at once? (I&#039;m a light user, comparable to your use now, likely).

				Hatter26&#039;s vials seem pretty good, he even offers kits with sterile water and needles included. Is the value good? Hatter26&#039;s other products are pretty expensive per dose. I&#039;d also like to know how much you need for a nice high.

				Yeah, it&#039;s convenient for some, but I have a good 5000 needles, so I&#039;m set, hahaha...<br /><br />Still, it IS convenient having the prefiltered vials.

				Yeah his stuff is pretty convenient, especially since he uses multiple wheel filters to really get all the crap out. I&#039;m pretty sure you couldn&#039;t do clean BTH shots with just one wheel filter! The thing I&#039;m interested in though is whether or not the value is good. If not I guess I&#039;ll just go with something else.<br /><br />5000 needles though? You must be a nurse or work at a needle exchange or something seeing how you can get naloxone too :P
