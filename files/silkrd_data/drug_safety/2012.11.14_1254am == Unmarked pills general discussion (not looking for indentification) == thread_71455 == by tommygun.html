				Have you ordered from a vendor before and gotten unmarked pills?&nbsp; What did you do?&nbsp; Yes I know, only buy from trusted vendors etc.&nbsp; Just wondering experiences.&nbsp; I have now ordered Xanex twice from SR.&nbsp; The first time was the blue unmarked Ksolol (spell).&nbsp; I really didn&#039;t expect unmarked (the listing didn&#039;t say), but f&#039; it- based on ratings/ reviews I popped one and it had that familiar Xanex taste.&nbsp; Overall they are good IMO.&nbsp; Then more recently I ordered some &quot;bars&quot; and WTF was I surprised when I got unmarked bars.&nbsp; But sure enough they are the real deal as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I personally don&#039;t like not being to identity something before taking it, but in the end it worked out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also curious wth are these unmarked pills being made?&nbsp; Mass produced in underground labs, made in non-usa countries?&nbsp; Or stolen before printing?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also has anyone gotten straight up bunk pills? <br /><br />

				Legitimate unmarked tablets are sold around the world. Some perfectly good generic paracetamol and ibuprofen comes in the form of unmarked tablets, and is sold by major drugstores and supermarkets. The strip the tablets are in, however, is marked properly with content, expiry date and such. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these tablets, but also, there is no way of identifying them reliably once removed from their strips.<br /><br />Something similar exists with alprazolam and diazepam generics sold on the indian market: The strips are labeled, but the tablets inside them are not, apart from perhaps a (double) breaking line. I&#039;ve seen this in Zepose and Tranax branded benzo&#039;s, though other brands like Trika do stamp a brand label into the actual tablet. <br /><br />The only realistic way to tell them from fakes (without lab gear) is to have seen the genuine product, and even then it is very hard to spot something for a fake as the resemblance is often very good. On the upside, fakes often contain the active substance you wanted at the proper dose. Bad fakes that contain no active substance at all are usually produced to resemble a top brand name product like &#039;roche valiun&#039; rather than &#039;diazepam 10&#039;. <br /><br />

				Yeah good point, I just figured it would be easier for someone to press a fake unlabeled pill over one with markings.
