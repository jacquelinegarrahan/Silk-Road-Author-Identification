				Title: <strong>etizolam for anxiety?</strong><br />

				I was considering giving etizolam a try for anxiety, but I can&#039;t seem to find any much legit information over the web; mainly contradictory stuff. So I have some questions before I make my purchase.<br /><br />First off, I will be using it for anxiolytic effects.<br />1. What is the recommended dose for someone who needs 1mg of Xanax? <br />2. What is the onset, peak, and duration?<br />3. In terms of anxiolytic effectiveness how does it compare to Xanax?<br />4. How fast does tolerance develop?<br /><br />Also, in terms of effects, how does it compare to Xanax? By this I mean does it make your more or less drowsiness; more or less fogginess? Or anything else worth mentioning.<br /><br />I am just trying to be safe with my drug usage.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Probably 1.5-2mg etizolam would work for you if you need 1mg xanax<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak to the onset/peak/duration as I&#039;m usually taking it if i&#039;m incredibly hung over and need to go to work without freaking out or taking it with other stimulating substances.&nbsp; I only take 1mg so it doesn&#039;t have a highly pronounced effect.&nbsp; Does seem to take effect within minutes.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t seem to be as sleepy as xanax, or as likely that a person would take loads of it repeatedly to chase the high...though I guess that depends on the user.&nbsp; Maybe I just haven&#039;t taken &#039;enough&#039;, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be much of a &#039;high&#039; - just a smoothing and neutralizing of the uncomfortable prickly anxiety state.&nbsp; No noticeable fogginess next day when i&#039;ve only taken etizolam.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tolerance - don&#039;t know, at the most I&#039;ve taken maybe 3-5 mg in a day and it&#039;s never caused me to nod off like xanax.&nbsp; I have been taking it daily for a few weeks but in the past I used it 2-3 times a wk and didn&#039;t get that panicky &quot;feel like I&#039;m gonna have a seizure if I don&#039;t get some benzos in me&quot; effect like I have when taking 2-3mg xanax for several wks in a row.<br /><br />I like it, its a good one to have around.

				Dr. White is a ripoff.&nbsp; $2+/mg?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; just no.<br />Chem4coin is reasonable, about a buck a mg. I&#039;ve been contemplating an order w/ them...been around for a while and their reviews are great.<br />I&#039;ve ordered pills and a liquid from 1 small and one big benzo vendor that have both since disappeared but they both did a nice job.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m assuming you want to domestic because I do&nbsp; :o <br />&nbsp;You can get it a lot cheaper in powder and blotter form but try it out as a regular ol&#039; pill first and see if it suits you. <br />I understand what you mean about relief.&nbsp; anxiety/Panic attacks are so fucking horrible.&nbsp; To some extent you can learn how to feel them coming on and say &quot;nope, I&#039;m not going to die.&nbsp; I know this feeling and it&#039;s not gonna kill me&quot;.<br />But other times it&#039;s overwhelming and you just need chemical assistance.&nbsp; I think I do it to myself by overthinking and overanalyzing and eventually it explodes sometimes without realizing what&#039;s happening.&nbsp; I only have 5 or so &#039;baby panic attacks&#039; a yr. now and it&#039;s always after I smoke weed combined with some other psychedelic or dissociative.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />This is after spending a year in my early 20s dealing with them a few times a week...took a while to learn about anxiety and get better.

				As for dose equation for anxiety, 1 mg alprazolam should roughly be as effective as 1.5 mg or etizolaam or at least around that figure.<br /><br />The legal status of etizolam is a bit of a tricky one. Technically it is not a benzodiazpine, and in most countries it is not a controlled substance in any way. It is, however, a prescription medication in most countries and not available over the counter without a script from a doctor. Prices on SR do not seem that high to me (under $1/tablet). <br /><br />Personally i&#039;ve found this drug interesting for treating anxiety: things like xanax suppress the anxiety response very well, but if they fail to do so they are more or less useless. Etizolam, for me, doesnt really block the anxiety, but it reduces the physical response (increased heart rate and respiration) to some degree.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it is a substance worth exploring if you are suffering from anxiety problems - if it doesn&#039;t work as well as you want it to there is always the option of true benzos.<br />
