				The colour of MDMA does not reflect on its quality, since it is a result of the manufacturing process. MDMA can be synthesised from MDP2P, which leaves the final product slightly brown, for example.

				It still reflects the purity though. The final MDMA product is less pure if there are unreacted precursor materials in there.

				I&#039;ve gotten more used to brown MDMA but I still prefer it be properly washed.<br /><br />Because of M1 (methylone) many people apparently balk at MDMA that isn&#039;t brown because they think it might be M1.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let anyone tell you MDMA is brown though.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter how it was made....MDMA isn&#039;t brown.&nbsp; The brown is impurities.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take a lot of impurities to make it pretty brown though.

				color doesnt necessarily reflect purity some of the purest ive ever had on the road came from luckylucianos/deadmau5 gear. its brown sand and has been tested for purity at one of the best.. white color is not the purest its just as easy to cut with anything as brown is.. just fyi

				Lucky&#039;s stuff is now lighter in color after he asked it to be washed an additional time.&nbsp; There is very good stuff that&#039;s brown but I personally would prefer it at least be light brown.&nbsp; True that white doesn&#039;t mean it is pure, but when it is brown you can be sure it isn&#039;t pure.&nbsp; Maybe good enough though.

				JoR&#039;s 84% brown MDMA is amazing to say the least.&nbsp; Definitely not bad because of its color.&nbsp; Like others have said, it&#039;s synth&#039;d different ways which create different colored products.&nbsp; Color has nothing to do with purity.

				Color does have something to do with purity.&nbsp; If it isn&#039;t white then you know it isn&#039;t pure.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean that it is pure if it is white though.<br /><br />An MDMA molecule isn&#039;t brown or gray or black or blue or green.&nbsp; Different synthesis methods do result in different byproducts which make it less pure.&nbsp; Much of the MDMA on the road is made with saffrole which is brown and there&#039;s often at least a little saffrole left behind which to me isn&#039;t a big deal and for sellers it may help prove the product is legit.&nbsp; But to say &quot;it is going to not be brown because of the synthesis&quot; is wrong.&nbsp; Any MDMA will be crystalline white if it is properly washed.

				MDMA can be made with a substance or subatances other than saffrole.<br /><br />In fact, its harmful to the environment to use saffrole which is basically made by hacking down some tree in a rainforest, leading to the deterioration of the terrain. The tree are not tapped - they are chopped and the roots boiled to create the saffrole.<br /><br />I guess the other gear used to make MDMA is just hard to get hold of, or more expensive than the saffrole which is made illegally.<br /><br />Either way, I&#039;ve never had bad MDMA off SR. If anything, Ivory and his/her usual brownish MDMA is one of my favs. <br /><br />I think you can acetone wash mdma, which may explain some MDMA which looks very pale in colour.<br /><br />Reminds me to make sure I pack some MDMA this wkend.&nbsp; ;D

				I ordered from Instagrams and was delivered a nice very clear batch of crystals.<br /><br />All of the MDMA I&#039;ve ordered from SR has tested great - but I havent sampled instagrams yet to know if the colorless crystals feel any better than the brown/gray ones I&#039;ve received from others.<br /><br />As stated in this thread the color doesnt really indicate all that much.

				The crystals from Instragrams looks so good that it appears to more closely resemble methylone which is often washed better than MDMA.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be curious to hear reports.&nbsp; Based on looks it could be extremely awesome if it is real.

				Check out Full Escrow UK&#039;s MDMA. It&#039;s light brown en mass in their pictures but my 1/4 g sample was snow white. It also happens to be the finest mdma iI&#039;ve had the privilege to try. <br /><br />In fact, alot of the brown mdma is only dark en mass. Even before LL&#039;s for the extra wash (back when it was shit brown/purple) it would become 50 shades lighter when crushed. To a cream color!<br /><br />I doubt many people realize this at first glance when they see these giant dark rocks... but those dark are rocks made of crystals compressed together and they are scattering light every which way non- uniformly. Along with very minor trace impurities. Alot of these rocks turn white/cream when broken up and crushed.

				Dude, even JoR&#039;s &quot;Source G&quot;, at 86% is fucking tan/light brown when it isn&#039;t crushed. <br /><br />The remaining 14% is just salts.<br /><br />If there is any of the tiniest &quot;impurity&quot; in the crystals that would cause it to go from super crystalline white, to a light tan or light brown, it would be so much of a minute impurity that it would literally hold no harmful impact on your physical health, or the quality of the roll.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />

				Around these parts, brown/tan mdma is not as appealing since it is often likened to be a mix of mdma and mda. Which isn&#039;t all bad imo, but also isn&#039;t as popular when people are looking for mdma. Even though brown/tan mdma (from the road) is typically just as good and about as pure as white mdma, when a bag of tan mdma is seen, I&#039;ve heard it claimed to be too sassy (sassafras) which is slang for a mix with mda, I guess. Whatever the reasoning behind it or whatever they mean, white mdma is more sought after around my town.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure why the nickname &quot;sass&quot; was applied to MDA and not MDMA.&nbsp; The synthesis of the two is the same except for the last steps.&nbsp; Both can be made from sassafras and both can be made from other things like PMK.<br /><br />Taken literally, it is often true that brown MDMA is sassy in that it often contains sassafras but to conclude that sassafras means it has MDA in it is just wrong.<br /><br />One advantage of brown MDMA is that it probably isn&#039;t methylone.<br /><br />The vast majority of people out there love the vast majority of MDMA from SR once they&#039;ve tried it, be it white, brown or grey or even greenish.<br /><br />I guess something must have happened in your particular town to make people feel differently entreterra.&nbsp; Personally I can&#039;t imagine people not loving at least a little MDA added to their MDMA but to each their own.

It&#039;s light brown en mass in their pictures but my 1/4 g sample was snow white. It also happens to be the finest mdma iI&#039;ve had the privilege to try. <br /><br />In fact, alot of the brown mdma is only dark en mass. Even before LL&#039;s for the extra wash (back when it was shit brown/purple) it would become 50 shades lighter when crushed. To a cream color!<br /><br />I doubt many people realize this at first glance when they see these giant dark rocks... but those dark are rocks made of crystals compressed together and they are scattering light every which way non- uniformly. Along with very minor trace impurities. Alot of these rocks turn white/cream when broken up and crushed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think this also plays roll (ha!) in the coloring.&nbsp; Back when I used to get big fat rocks from Old Amsterdam they&#039;d be a darker brown but when crushed to a fine dust they would appear lighter.&nbsp; I think less of the light is absorbed when it&#039;s a dust and is therefore reflected back (to your eye) making it slightly lighter.
