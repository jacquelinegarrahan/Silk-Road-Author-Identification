				I usually like to space my use of psychadelics/phenethylamines out with at least a week in between each trip, ideally I would wait 2 weeks.<br /><br />In a few weeks, however, I will be attending a two-day music festival and am considering taking 2C-B the first day and then MDMA the second. I was just wondering if there would be any cross-tolerance/diminished effects between the two days and also if it could possibly be harmful to use phenethylamines in such a way. A few months back I attended another two-day festival and had taken 300 mcg of LSD the first day and 150mg of MDMA the second. The acid trip was very intense and rolling the second day was a memorable experience as well, however I did notice the roll was really short compared to what I was used to and the effects seemed to be a bit diminished.<br /><br />The original plan was to just drink alcohol, smoke some bud and just chill the first day before poppin&#039; some molly and sweating it out the second. Any input is appreciated guys.
