				Okay, guys.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never experienced DMT.&nbsp; So I&#039;m looking for some info.&nbsp; I already know who the good domestic vendors are, so that I&#039;m not worried about.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering...&nbsp; What&#039;s the best way to smoke it?&nbsp; Sounds like 50 mg is the usual dosage?&nbsp; I want to fully blast off here, and I wanna make sure I&#039;m prepared.&nbsp; So before I order, I wanna know what&#039;s the best way to smoke it so I can make sure the materials are available i.e. vaporizer or special bowl? I want the full effect.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m still awaiting my order but I&#039;ve read that it does irreversible damage to whatever pipe you are using - taste wise. Based on that knowledge I wouldn&#039;t use a high quality bong or glass piece.<br /><br />When my order arrives I plan on sprinkling my dosage on a small amount of bud to negate the alleged horrible, plasticy taste of pure D in a glass dry pipe that will forever be used specifically for DMT.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

				you wont experience a true DMT breakthrough by smoking it in a joint.&nbsp; look for trojan on the road, he has various fantastic links.<br /><br />buy a single serving bottle of Hennessy. some wire pan scrubbers &amp; a blowtorch lighter and your on the DMT trip for good.<br /><br />vaporizing DMT doesn&#039;t leave a nasty taste (only combusting it) and besides, its not even that bad of a taste, plasticky mothballs lol<br /><br /><br />

				I bought a pipe for the first time a few weeks ago.

				Smoking actually comes on faster than IV. Smoked DMT goes directly to oxygenated blood which goes straight to the brain. IV goes to deoxygenated blood which has to travel back to the heart then to the lungs before being oxygenated and going to the brain. It takes about 3 seconds to pull out the needle and cap it, while it takes about 15 seconds to blast off. I never had a problem with it. I have taken DMT 10 times - all IV, all self administered. I have never smoked it. 100% success rate - every time I was able to cap the needle.<br />

				It was acceptably pure. The freebase was white and it fully dissolved to a clear solution, no pain, no redness, swelling or anything like that on injection. <br /><br />I must add that another advantage of IV over smokedDMT is that you know exactly howmuch you&#039;re putting in your body. It&#039;s a lot easier and a guarenteed blast off every time, unlike smoking.

I&#039;m also not OK with IM injections if it&#039;s potentially going to lead to an uncomfortable conversation with my doctor. haha.<br /><br />I was very interested in how it&#039;s accomplished. I&#039;m amazed that one would want to use vinegar for that though. I&#039;m sure there is a reason. I would certainly try it if I could be certain of the purity of the substance (ie, lab synthesized DMT, not crude chemical extractions in some pyrex dishes you borrowed from&nbsp; your mom overnight. :) )

The reaction with acetic acid creates DMT acetate, which is water soluable. Distilled vinegar contains very little other than acetic acid and water (99.9% purity). Acetic acid is quite safe. It is excreted quickly by the kidneys. It is the primary end metabolite of drinking alcohol. 0.5ml of distilled vinegar in the veins would be the same as a sip of alcohol metabolised - nothing.

				i would only take a shot of DMT but only if there was a nurse present to give the injection.&nbsp; unless you&#039;re a trained professional or lifelong diabetic, giving yourself injections is very risky.&nbsp; there&#039;s a whole shit load of things that could go wrong in that situation.

The last thing anyone needs is some news story about how some kid shot up DMT. Giving themselves an infection which gets ignored because they are worried that it was the drug and not the dirty needle.<br /><br />Who knows where the OP lives, what their medical skill is, they might be living next door to a crack den and pick up a spare off the floor. So perhaps maybe they should just stick to a safer method first before graduating to the elite.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 Dont stick needles in your body if you dont know what your doing. Nexus (clearnet) has great shit on building the &quot;machine&quot; literally cost you like &lt;$10 to make aslong as you have a drill. Pretty simple to make too.

				I don&#039;t cough from the DMT I&#039;ve had. I don&#039;t even feel any chest disturbance except for the one time I accidently lit the damned steel wool mesh.<br /><br />I am not saying anyone shouldn&#039;t do IV drugs. I&#039;m just scared of them. My partner would freak the fuck out if I start smoking something from a meth pipe and graduate to IV injection. haha.<br /><br />I do not have the training to do IV either, and nurses often have trouble getting a needle into my veins to draw blood or put me on a bag of fluid. I&#039;m not interested because of the stigma, side effects, and the purity of the substance is always in question in a black market.

I read about Krystal Cole&#039;s boyfriend / LSD king who hooked up an IV bag of DMT on one of those adjustable rollers that they use in hospitals to allow you to adjust the speed of the drip. They would turn them up and down to make the trip get stronger/weaker and sort of &quot;ride the wave of DMT&quot;. Fucking insane. If I had some lab quality synthetic product and a nurse to rig me up, I would totally do that shit and sit around like a psycho in a prison hospital ward all night.

I want the full effect. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m a little late to the party. Best ways to smoke it are either using a Vapor Genie, or just a standard meth pipe. With a meth pipe the smoke will be very harsh and taste nasty. Be prepared for that. A vapor genie makes the smoke a lot smoother, but it still stinks. <br /><br />A lot of people choose to sandwich the DMT in between thin layers of weed, or put the DMT on top of ash. DO NOT burn the DMT, you need to vaporize it. The DMT needs to melt from the heat applied to it and you&#039;ll get a good effect. Vapor Genies cost about $60-100 dollars depending on what you get, I got the Sherlock. It&#039;s a clear vaporizer, so I can see the smoke when it begins.<br /><br />50mg is a shit ton of DMT. If it&#039;s your first time, put only 30mg in the bowl. You need to take at least two deep ass hits within 30 seconds. DMT will hit you that fast, within 1 minute easy. Also, DMT is so intense that you will want someone with you to grab the vaporizer/bowl that you are using so it doesn&#039;t break or melt (it will be hot) any carpet or chair that you&#039;re sitting in.<br /><br />One more tip. After your &quot;friend&quot; takes the bowl away, they should leave the room. DMT is a solitary drug, and having people around you talking/moving takes you away from the trip. You need to be alone in a dimly lit room for full effects. The less stuff around to distract you the better. <br /><br />You can PM me if you want more details or have more questions.

I mean, extracting your own DMT is really not that hard, and it&#039;s far cheaper than buying it on SR. I think ~5-10 times cheaper depending on yeild.<br /><br />I am going to try to mix some MAOI with my DMT to make some pharma to eat. I&#039;ve read the cardio effects of smoked DMT are because the body sees DMT in the blood and starts pumping adrenaline. I think that pharmahuasca might remove the cardio effect, and maybe even make smoking DMT boosters lack the cardio effects.

				DMT for the Masses is probably the best place to start if you&#039;re a beginner, especially if you have no experience with any kind of syntheses or extractions of any kind. It&#039;s still easily doable and with practice you can get a decent amount.
