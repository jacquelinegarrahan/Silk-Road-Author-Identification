				See 2nd post for an easy readable pdf version of this howto!<br /><br />BASIC PREREQUISITES<br />&nbsp;<br />· You know how to operate your capsuling device<br />· You are able to do basic math<br />· You have all the required equipment and materials<br />· You are able to adapt this process according to your specific capsuling device<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />EQUIPMENT<br />&nbsp;<br />· Graduated cylinder, 20mL, made of PE (important!)<br />· Pestle and mortar<br />· Your capsuling device<br />· Bendable plastic card (Credit cards are too sturdy)<br />· Basic paper<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />MATERIALS<br /><br />· Empty capsules; do not get the cheapest ones! We will use size “1”<br />· Mannitol<br />· Highly disperse silicium dioxide<br />· The substance you intend to include in the capsules<br />&nbsp;<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />I will be using this type of capsuling device:<br />See attachment &quot;Unbenannt.JPG&quot;<br />I will neither elaborate on how to operate it, not assist you with yours. There are manuals for that!<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />PROCEDURE OVERVIEW<br /><br />· Figure out how much filler medium you need and prepare an excess of 50% or so. We will be filling 30 capsules, size “1”. Size “1” holds 0.5mL, do the math J<br />· Prepare the filler medium<br />· Mix filler medium with active ingredient<br />· Filling the capsules<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />LET&#039;S GO!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />Make sure your working area is clean and not too humid. Assemble your capsuling device and fill it with empty caps and remove the tops.<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />PREPARING THE INERT FILLING MATERIAL<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />The filler consists of 99.5 parts of mannitol and 0.5 parts of highly disperse silicium dioxide.<br />30 caps x 0.5mL = 15mL being the total volume.&nbsp; <br />Just mix 19,9g of mannitol with 0,1g of highly disperse silicium dioxide. You do this by adding them in small portions at a time to the mortar, diligently mixing them with your pestle to ensure a homogenous mixture.<br />&nbsp;<br />Scrape out mortar and also scrape the mortar with the plastic card, collecting the filling mixture on a sheet of paper.<br />Now add a spoonful of the inert mixture into the mortar and thoroughly grind it with your pestell. This will close the porous surface of the mortar. When done, wipe the inside and the pestell with a paper towel, some small residues of inerts are negligible.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------- <br />!!!Calculate dosage per capsule and weight the proper amount!!!<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; <br />MIXING THE ACTIVE INGRIDIENTS WITH THE INERT FILLING MATERIAL<br /><br />This is the most delicate step! Carefully mix the active substance with a small amount of inert and proceed by adding small amounts of inert filling mixture while you grind. You want a homogenous mixture!<br />Keep adding inert filling material until about 80% of the desired volume is reached, which is 12mL in our case.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />Schematics on how to properly mix active ingredients with the filler:<br />See attachment &quot;mixing.JPG&quot;<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />Empty the contents from the mortar onto a sheet of paper, be sure to scrape down the pestle as well as the mortar with your plastic card.<br />&nbsp;<br />Now take your graduated cylinder and gently gush your mixture into the cylinder.<br />You must not compact the mixture in any way. Never tap the cylinder!<br />&nbsp;<br />You will notice, that there are about 11.5-13mL in your cylinder, depending on how thoroughly you ground the mixture. Fill the cylinder up to exactly 15mL with inert filling material.<br />&nbsp;<br />Transfer the 15mL from your graduated cylinder back into the mortar and mix again, yet thoroughly, but without applying much pressure. If you were stupid enough to use a graduated cylinder made of glass you will notice that a lot of your mixture will stick to the inner walls, told you so! :P <br />&nbsp;<br />Scrape your now ready to use mixture onto a sheet of paper like you did before.<br />&nbsp;<br />Carefully dump parts of your mixture onto the capsuling device and spread it around with a plastic card. Never compress the mixture! Do not tap the device!<br />Repeat until all capsules are filled. You should not be left with any of your mixture. However, If there is like 1mL or so left, you may now gently tap the capsuling device a little in order to make space for the leftover 1mL.<br />If you did not have enough mixture to fill all capsules you will have to start over by collecting your existing mix and adding inerts to it until the needed volume is reached.<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------- <br />Feel free to ask any questions, I will do my best to answer them.<br /><br />&nbsp;
