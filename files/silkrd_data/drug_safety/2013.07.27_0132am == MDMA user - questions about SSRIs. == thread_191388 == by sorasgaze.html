				So I roll on MDMA every few months and use methylone more often since it&#039;s cheaper. My psychiatrist asked if I wanted to try any medication for my horrible anxiety and I figured I&#039;d take a shot at getting benzos so I agreed and she set up an appointment with the doctor. He prescribed me 50mg and 100mg Zoloft and said to increase my dose as necessary. I got the pills two days ago but was going to be doing bk-MDMA the same day I got them so I haven&#039;t started taking them yet. I&#039;ve heard you&#039;re supposed to stop taking the SSRIs a few days before rolling, but they have withdrawals so isn&#039;t that not such a good idea? Apparently the best way to stop taking these meds is to taper off them slowly. So how would that work? I lower the dose then stop taking them ahead of time before I roll then a few days later begin taking them again? I&#039;d just rather not get head-fucked with serotonin syndrome and want to get the most out of my rolls. I&#039;d really appreciate any feedback, especially from any of those who roll and currently take an SSRI. Thanks.

				It takes more than a few days of Zoloft abstinence before it is safe to take mdma or bk-mdma again. Depending on how long you have been on an SSRI it could take up to a month. I wouldn&#039;t take them, tell your doc they where making you very depressed (a common side affect) and give benzos another go.

				Thank you. I wanted benzos in the first place, they actually asked me if I was interested in a specific medication but I didn&#039;t want to come off as some guy looking to get high by saying I wanted some type of benzo. Yeah, I&#039;m not feeling too confident in taking these pills because I heard they can really fuck with your emotions in different ways and I do different drugs quite often, I&#039;d rather not have to schedule out something so I can make my drug habits work with these meds. Probably just won&#039;t take em. Thanks again.

				Mate if you are going to&nbsp; still&nbsp; continue using MDMA etc stay clear of SSRI&#039;s your obviously aware of seretonin syndrome.
