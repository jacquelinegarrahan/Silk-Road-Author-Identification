				Hi<br />Relative SR noob here ordered some weed from a couple of sellers and went very but wanted to know about the the MDMA strength here compared to what I might get in the U.K as I&#039;ve tried it a couple of times but I&#039;m assuming it gets cut to shit like cocaine/heroin? Especially since the MDMA on here seems to be quite chemically pure with a lot listings saying 80-84% just wondering how much is too much really?<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />PP<br />

				There&#039;s never too much really :)<br /><br />It&#039;s all in how you dose. I know street MDMA in Germany and the UK, and frankly, walking up to some guy in the club asking for a few pops usually gives you low-dosed shit mixed with all kinds of crap.<br /><br />The stuff floating around here is very nice, particularly from the 4 or 5 established vendors.<br /><br />So yeah, whenever I want to roll I prefer a small order here than getting it from by hookup in the club.<br /><br />And since MDMA isn&#039;t a drug that is prone to putting you at OD&#039;risk, there&#039;s nothing like &quot;too strong&quot;.... just sayin...

				Street MDMA in the UK is actually pretty pure, most of it comes from NL through the same sorts of channels that SR vendors acquire it.<br />The only thing I&#039;ve seen MDMA cut with in the UK is sucrose and it&#039;s not just mixed in, it&#039;s been co-crystallised. In my experience though it tends to be near enough as pure as the stuff on Silk Road. <br />Occasionally cheap shit like 4-MEC is passed off as MD but it&#039;s not that common. You&#039;d never see it cut with coke, the effects are totally different and coke is way more expensive.&nbsp;

				Everyone seems to think that SR is the only way you&#039;re going to get pure drugs. <br /><br />Not true. UK MDMA is generally pretty good, usually £15 worth is enough for a whole night, 6-7 hours, and £15 worth can be anything from 300mg - 500mg. <br /><br />£10 is enough but won&#039;t last as long - 250mg. Most people would agree that 250mg isn&#039;t enough for 7 hours, and that&#039;s usually how long people want to go for at raves.

Anyway thanks for the replys. I just assumed it was cut to shit when an acquaintance said she bought 7g for £50 it threw me a little bit given the prices I&#039;d previously&nbsp; heard e.g £40 a gram.

At 7 quid a gram it&#039;s probably 4-MEC or something like it, a lot of younger kids round where I live buy it from head shops &amp; think it has the same effects as MD.

				From what I have heard and experienced MDMA crystals are pretty good all over Europe unless you buy from a real scammer. Pills can contain all sorts of stuff though, obviously.

				Never found mdma that wasn&#039;t cut to shit and I doubt I&#039;ve ever had it at all here in non-coastal US. Then, after the discovery of silkroad, I&#039;ll just get enough from me and all my friends and their friends. I don&#039;t want to see anyone being ripped off for money or putting unknown shit in their body.<br /><br />SR MDMA for me.

				I buy a lot of MDMA over here in England and the quality is usually pretty nice if you buy crystals, usually £40 a g, then you can spend £20 and get .5 or whatever.

				You need to watch too for street mdma which is very often just methylone or mostly methylone at least since its cheaper. Here on SR many people reagent test the products then post on the forums their results which can indicate if methylone is the primary ingredient or not.
