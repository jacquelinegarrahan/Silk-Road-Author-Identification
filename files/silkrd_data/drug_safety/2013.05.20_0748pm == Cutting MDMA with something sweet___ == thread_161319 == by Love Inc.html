				Hello!<br /><br />Recently I got some MDMA from someone (not here from SR), and I am pretty sure it&#039;s cut with something. The effects were definitely MDMA, but not as strong as expected (by me, two of my friends and two other dudes as well). Passed Marquis (EZ test), but the reaction was not &quot;fizzy&quot;, the marquis went black, and had some purple color to it when examined against a bright light. <br /><br />The product was pretty much pulverized, but there were small crystals here and there. Upon closer inspection, there were two kinds of crystals: opaque, greyish ones and clear ones. The grey opaque ones taste bitter as hell, and burn the nose when snorted (snorting only for testing purposes) as should be the case.<br /><br />The clear ones, however, are very easy on the nose and taste sweet. Sweet? Is there any possibility on earth the chemistry behind MDMA could produce something that tastes sweet? I don&#039;t think so...<br />So the question remains, what is it? Could it just be a sugar of some sort? Do people really do that? I guess that would be better than cutting it with some active stuff though...<br /><br />Another question is, how do I figure out how much of the good stuff my baggies hold? Both crystals look exactly the same when ground to powder, so I have no idea of the purity of my gear. Is an acetone wash the only method to clean my gear?<br /><br />On a side note, does the acetone wash remove everything else than MDMA from the powder? If there is something else active in there, say amp, the wash would not remove that would it?<br /><br />Ideas?

				Marquis should go a black-purple. However the presence of a chemical that&#039;ll test MDMA positive in a Marquis will generally override the colors of any adulterants; it&#039;s not a lab-grade result.<br /><br />If it was sweet, it could literally be sugar or a sweetener. But there&#039;s really no way of knowing what you got without lab testing, especially since you said it felt like MDMA. Was their decreased euphoria, or extra speediness?

				Thank you for your answer.<br /><br />The feeling (for me) was like MDMA, only milder. I had no trouble what so ever sleeping afterwards. The first guy I gave it to was suspecting there was speed in it, but I don&#039;t think so. He was also suspecting the gear to be MDEA, due to its &quot;milder than MDMA&quot; -effects, but nah, why would anybody even make MDEA due to it being pricier and more difficult to make? <br /><br />So, I believe it to be MDMA. But how much of it do I have? The acetone wash seems to be my only option if I don&#039;t want to lab test it?
