				Hey Guys,<br /><br />I wondering if anyone has experience of mixing ketamine and lamotrigine as I&#039;m considering trying it. Here&#039;s the background - I&#039;ve previously taken k (although not for a long time). Since then I&#039;ve been on lamotrigine for type two bipolar. I&#039;ve been stable for quite a while and am considering trying ket again. I know there are always risks from a mental health standpoint, especially when suffering from bipolar, and I&#039;m aware of them so not really looking for advice there. I&#039;ve checked interaction databases and there&#039;s nothing but the standard temporary drowsiness stuff but I&#039;ve read that lamotrigine can limit or completely cancel out the pleasurable effects of ketamine. So what I&#039;m after is experience reports and perhaps suggestions of increased dosage if there is a limiting effect. Any help would be gratefully received.<br /><br />Sep<br />x

				not much info.<br />&nbsp;you could get a very nasty rash.<br /><br />I would avoid this or any combo. Lamotrigine&nbsp; sounds like a nasty chemical. <br /><br />sorry i couldn&#039;t help more.

				Do you have any source for thinking it could cause skin reactions valakki? There&#039;s a black box warning on lamotringe for a few terrifying instant death oh my god my skin fell off rashes but the manufacturer claims that nearly all cases appear in the first 2 to 8 weeks or after suddenly stopping treatment. I&#039;ve been on it for over a year with very successful results and practically no side effects. I&#039;m a cautious person by nature but I&#039;m really missing recreational drugs and lamotrigine seems to have a lot nasty interactions so finding something fun that I can actually take is proving difficult. Even weed is off the table, I came across a scary report of someone taking a couple of tokes then waking a day later with no memory of whatever they were doing.

				I&#039;m giving this one bump to get it back on the front page, then I&#039;ll let it die a natural death.
