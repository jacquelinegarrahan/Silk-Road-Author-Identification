				Hello everyone my name is Zebra420Kitty.<br /><br />The reason im posting this thread is because I am facinated with combining drugs. I have done only a few drug combinations, but they have been my best experience with drugs. <br /><br />I hope this thread is in the right place!<br /><br />To start it off I&#039;ll post of favorite combo and my second favorite combo and why.<br /><br />1. 1/8th of Mushrooms on the second or third hour of taking the amazing MDMA. There is a delight synergy to taking mdma with shrooms. I feel like they by them selves although quite different have some similar feelings. And when these are combined it is almost impossible to have a bad trip. I am not in opposition to bad trips, i feel that they are honestly the best trips because of how much you learn. But, on the note of a good trip this is quite possibly the most fun trip where your mind can think about any idea and still cope with where your mind takes you. The visuals are quite amazing and the colors become extremely vibrant, more so then with just mushrooms alone.<br /><br />2. 4-aco-dmt freebase + Beer. on this combination i find it very easy to meditate. The ability of meditation allows me to go very deep into the 4-aco-dmt space. So deep that i had visuals extremely similar to nn-dmt. I sat outside for a few hours with my eyes closed not moving in complete bliss. Im not sure if this is the just the 4-aco-dmt, or the addition of beer. but i find it extremely easy to control your mind and what you are seeing. I find it easy to manipulate thing with my mind when eyes are open and even more essentially when they are closed.<br /><br />Im Looking forward to reading all of your favorite combinations, and why.<br /><br />Cheers

				one of my favorite combinations is when i am coming down off a psychedelic and take a benzo after the real tripping has stopped but i still have the stimulated feeling... very relaxing, peaceful, even euphoric and allows me to contemplate the trip then sleep easily<br /><br />also like mixing cocaine and benzos, its the only way i will take coke - i dont even like it generally <br /><br />a decent combo is opiates/opioids and anti-histamines like promethazine (infamous purple syrup when i started using opis or tussionex). <br /><br />lsd or mescaline and oxycodone or heroin combo is very enjoyable - still trip hard, just kinda mellows it out and makes it more relaxing - nearly speedball-ish plus tripping :) beginning of the san pedro extract trip was an amazing dream like state ...until the nausea, then i purged and got the first intensely psychedelic euphoria rush<br /><br />of course the classic candy flip, although i have only done it with a psychedelic amphetamine (was sold as lsd back in my teens) and mdma <br /><br />dxm + weed<br /><br />i used to mix absolutely everything with weed but recently stopped smoking mostly so i dont even know what its like to do most drugs without that combination lol <br /><br />acid and nitrous... intensely amazing thirty seconds, then of course nitrous and bud, nitrous and k, nitrous and anything&nbsp; lol<br /><br />oxycodone and benzos<br /><br />hydrocodone/oxycodone and heroin<br /><br />heroin and more heroin&nbsp; :)

				Everyone should also post any drug combos they are currently on.<br /><br />Vyvanse + Kratom + Weed<br /><br />Just went for a 3 miles run in between posts. This is why I would reccomend this type of drug combo, perhaps minus the opioid if you have a highly addictive personality.

				The talk of Nitrous has reminded me of one of my other favorite combinations.<br /><br />30mg snorted 2c-e + a 100 pack of whip-its. Every whip it you do brings you into a mosaic world and makes the whole world collapse essentiallly in front of your eyes. Legit shit.<br /><br />And on the note of combining drugs im with you microRNA, Adding cannabis isnt even a combo in my eyes. Being that said, i smoke alot so its almost like a life combo. Real life + Weed. haha

				MDMA + 2C-B + 25C-NBOME<br /><br />The funny thing is the 2C-B ingestion was inadvertent, but needless to say it was the best day of my life, probably also because I was at a music festival.&nbsp; But holy fuck this combo is golden.&nbsp; Probably not too healthy for the heart or brain, though.

				One combination i can not wait to try later in life would be the Jedi Flip (MDMA+LSD+SHROOMS). Ive heard some crazy things about this combination and i an quite curious. I have yet to do LSD but will be doing it here in 3 weeks and will probably dose about 250-300ug. I want to do lsd a few times before i decide to make the plunge into a Jedi Flip. I&#039;ve read that it isnt for the weak minded or the inexperienced with LSD. So im gonna approach with caution.

				MDMA with pretty much anything. My favorites with MDMA are MXE, Ketamine, Shrooms, LSD, and most recently Changa (DMT).<br />The Changa I smoked was mixed with an MAOI so it wasn&#039;t a smart thing to do, but I only took a couple hits when coming down from a roll and was shot right back up with crazy trails. Ketamine/MXE is pretty interesting with MDMA too, feels like I&#039;m walking in a swamp knee-high and occasionally get the &quot;whoa how did I get here&quot; dream-like state. My favorite would be shrooms though, extreme euphoria/visuals with a come-down around the same time, it doesn&#039;t tire me like acid does.

				There are so many cominbations its hard to pick a good one.<br /><br />Personally i like alcohol and ephedrine for a good party. Ephedrine compensates for most of the sedative effects of alcohol, making it a very good start for a night out that you want to last until late hours.<br /><br />The morning after calls for an extra spicy cup of coffee - adding in 200 mg of pure caffeine into the mix thst makes two mugs normally. This is a great hangover recipe as long as you are not overly sensitive to stimulants.

I have yet to do acid, but i feel like i would take the Mushrooms like 2.5 hours before then the MDMA 1.5 hours before and then at 0, i would take the acid. And then i would take some more mdma about 10 min after the lsd. But im really not entirely sure how i want to do it. The time that i hippyflipped i took the mushrooms about 6 hours after my first dose of mdma. I took .13 for my first dose at 10:50. then .11 at 11:45. Then another dose at about 4:30 with the 1/8 of the dankest shrooms i have ever seen. covered in blue and purple. Truly blew my mind in a good way&nbsp; ;). So im also unsure about the dose that i would do. I feel like i would want to do .15+redoses of mdma. then 2.5 g of mushrooms just to stay safe(as if this would keep me safe) haha. but im not entirely sure how much lsd. since i have yet to try lsd. But i believe coming new years eve i will jedi fip after a few trials with lsd alone. I try to be a responsible psy user. Do it for the enlightenment. Psychadellics has done nothing but good for my life. but that is a nother story for later.<br /><br />sorry for rant!<br /><br />Zebra420Kitty

				Anyone have experience with LSD or shrooms mixed with any of the NBOMes?<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried 25c and 25i solo, and recently got some 25b though I haven&#039;t tried it besides a small corner as an allergy test yet - for some reason I&#039;m a bit nervous about 25b...<br /><br />Anyways, the NBOMes are generally considered more visual, so I was thinking about LSD (or shrooms) with a hit of one of them to try to get a more visual trip that also has the &quot;traditional&quot; psychedelic mind trip.<br /><br />I searched and found a thread on bluelight but didn&#039;t really gleam much from it.

				i have quite a few combinations i enjoy :) let me also add that i was living in a medical marijuana state and growing, so i was smoking weed pretty much all day without really getting high, just feeling normal and such. <br />1.weed/mdma/k/NO2 -&nbsp; is a fun one. take mdma and go out, then go to an after party or home and do a bit of k and a few whip its. . . puts you on a nice level.<br />2.weed/mdma/lsd/k, i&#039;ve only tried that combo once, but it was pretty wild. i was at a festival and did the k on the &quot;dance floor&quot;. it was quite the combo, with some insane visuals and just all around feeling of awesomeness.<br />3. weed/mdma/dmt - this one was quite nice and peaceful. i went out to a show and took some mdma and brought a small amount of dmt with me to smoke at the show. i didn&#039;t fully blast off but it was extreamly relaxing and felt awesome. when i got home later, i smoked some more weed and dmt and fully blasted off. . . when i returned, my body/soul was completely at peace and it was fucking awesome :)

He said he enjoyed it. Personally i have never done coke and dont really want to. i like downers / psy&#039;s most. Had a bad experience that hurt my view towards stims. I once believed i was getting some good mdma. This was before i was educated and i saw that it was chunky like so i decided that it had to be good. Turns out i ate a shit ton of exremely dank meth. I do not know how much i actually ate but i was up for around, 48-56 hours. Personally the worst drug experience i have ever gone through. Makes me cringe thinking about it. But yea, i dont like meth. sometime i even get depressed from taking my add medicine since i relate them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i like mdma and i also like coke a lot, both together it&#039;s just a nasty combo in my opinion. for example mdma with 2cb or lsd is a great combo for me, the synergy of this substances are just beautiful and intense, seems like they pushing each other.. when i do mdma and coke, theres no real synergy between those two and that combo can also get pretty nasty if you take too much (from own experience). there are still a lot of people combine mdma and coke at high doses, maybe someone else can tell you any beneficial of this combo.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Yeah the Coke was towards the end of the second night, didnt really have too much effect on me as i was already so high and had been from about 11am until 5:30am the following day :) I very rarely take coke i am a lot more into mandy and pills. I wouldn&#039;t recommend the coke mandy combo purely because i don&#039;t have much experience it was right at the end of a festival and to be quite honest i was so high from the pills i felt like i was floating along in my own happy little world for about 19 hours (y).<br /><br />The worst drug experiences i have had have been with 25i-nbome which i find to be nasty stuff. Especially when mixing it with large amounts of MDMA or pills as well as drinking alcohol it seems to put me into a seizure so i have since stopped taking it as i believe its not worth the hassle. These seizures i was blacked out violently shaking for around an hour each time 3 times so yeah not good, then again was quite possibly an OD.

				what i did was starting with 2 hits of LSD (300µg in total), adding 30mg 2C-B around 1 to 1.5 hours later, added 20-30mg 2-CB later in the night (maybe 4-5 hours in, I&#039;m not sure, after i came down again it felt like an entire week had passed, even tho it was probably half a day, so my timing here might be messed up) ;P&nbsp; &nbsp;added a few lines of Ketamine before going outside (maybe 50-80mg lines,&nbsp; every time i felt like it)<br /><br />this was the best trip of my life, by far, so many amazing things happened, but it&#039;s really hard to express with words, I haven&#039;t really felt any anxiety (except worrying a bit about getting home safely, because I was tripping so hard, and the friend I had with me to watch out for me tripped really hard on 150µg LSD, it was his first time ;P)<br /><br />planning on doing it again soon, when i got the cash for some LSD ;)
