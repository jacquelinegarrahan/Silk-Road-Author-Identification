Anti-inflammatory, Anti-allergenic, Relaxation, Light Stimulation, and Meditation/State of Trance.<br /><br />It&#039;s wide range of effects, ranging from symptomatic relief of opiate withdrawals, stomach aches, head aches, bloating, fatigue, stress, etc.<br />Vary vastly between the potency and maturity of the leaf.<br />Plus the amount taken.&nbsp; Less = Energetic - More = Sedating<br />With a combination of strains you can mix and match to accommodate almost anything you need achieved.<br /><br />Most White Vein strains tend to be energetic and slightly euphoric.<br />Green Veins are right in the middle, great legs, solid body, and a mixture of stress relief, and pain relief.<br />Red Veins are the top, they tend to be highly euphoric, relaxants, strong pain relief, and great for insomnia and meditation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Negatives - Physical Addiction, Constipation, Nausea @ High Doses, Vomiting @ High Doses, Dizziness and Light Headedness (Which also are more likely to occur at higher dosages).<br /><br />Kratom is truly a god send and any true connoisseur should keep copious amounts of it in his stash box.<br />The potential for this plant is endless, just like marijuana.<br />Which combine with beautiful synergy.<br />I have never experienced any kind of trouble taking kratom with almost any other drug.&nbsp; <br />Minus alcohol, but that&#039;s pretty much poison. Kratom and Alcohol = puke fest.<br />It&#039;s extremely friendly, helpful, and always there for you when you need it.<br /><br />Though at times, it can&#039;t solve every problem in the world.<br />For people with severe pain, kratom more than likely won&#039;t quite dampen it.<br />In combination with some high potency cannabis this would be a much safer and natural alternative to heavy opiates.<br />Opiate tolerant people will only find that kratom dampens their withdrawal symptoms and returns them to some sense of normalcy.<br /><br />It&#039;s undoubtedly one of my favorite drugs.<br />Ranking my favorites in order.<br /><br />1) LSD<br />2) Kratom<br />3) MDA/MDMA<br />4) Cannabis<br />5) MXE<br /><br />Worst drugs in order.<br /><br />1) Alcohol (Especially in combination with Cocaine and Benzodiazepines)<br />2) 25I-NBOMe<br />3) Mephedrone<br />4) Nicotine<br />5) Methamphetamine<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably add some honorable mentions as this list is obviously subjective.<br />That&#039;s pretty much it for now, hope it was informative and feel free to shoot any questions you might have.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful,<br />Vanquish<br />

(Avoid Carbonated Beverages)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This method takes practice, and an iron stomach.&nbsp; It can also be extremely messy and lead to sneezing, vomiting, and choking if you&#039;re not careful.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be honest, for extracts this is probably the preferred method.&nbsp; Or for someone that isn&#039;t taking large dosages.<br /><br /><br />Shake and Chug - Essentially a reverse toss and wash.&nbsp; Take the powder and throw it into your beverage of choice. (Avoid Carbonated Beverages)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then you shake or stir it, and quickly gulp it down.&nbsp; Orange Juice, Grapefruit Juice, or any other type of fruit juice is always a solid choice for this method.<br /><br /><br />Kratom Tea - This method involves quite a bit of effort, and it&#039;s a tad bit messy - but you can make some very potent tea.&nbsp; Kratom itself is incredibly bitter, especially batches high in mitragyna.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Usually this method involves bringing water to a very light boil and then dropping either crushed leaves or powder and letting it simmer for 15 minutes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Doing this you can usually do the process twice, still extracting the alkaloids.&nbsp; The third is much less and often completely unnecessary.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here is a tried and true method, that I have used for many many years.&nbsp; *clearnet warning* http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16165<br /><br /><br />Capsules - By and large the easiest, fastest, and most effective way of taking kratom.&nbsp; I personally use size 00 capsules.&nbsp; Place the powder on a flat surface, or a bowl with slight edges.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Split the capsule, and proceed to fill.&nbsp; You can usually cap each one in about 5-15 seconds depending on fullness and hand strength.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Closing Thoughts - I have done every method over the years, many times and by and large capsules are the only way to go.&nbsp; Quick, convenient, and no choking or puking risk.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toss and wash is great for extracts, which in my honest opinion are not worth the money over plain leaf.&nbsp; But some people especially those with high opiate tolerance and fat wallets, partake in.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kratom Tea is definitely worth trying, but mainly only if you have extremely high potency crushed leaf.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 99% of the time a really microfine powdered grind is by and large the best option for purchasing kratom.&nbsp; Leading to quicker absorption, and being easier to quickly capsule.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Depending on which vendor you use, they all use slightly different grinds.&nbsp; Some are gritty, some are fine talc, and last but not least course.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Batches of kratom vary greatly in potency.&nbsp; Headshop kratom is nearly inactive, while fresh leaf from Indonesia/Borneo will knock you on your ass.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The best batches I&#039;ve ever had were definitely strongly narcotic in nature, and almost to the potency of Oxycodone.&nbsp; These are incredibly rare, and high in alkaloids.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kratom like that doesn&#039;t come around that often.&nbsp; But usually if you have solid vendors the quality is always consistent and in many ways I prefer kratom to hydrocodone in almost every way possible.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vanquish<br />

				Last year I ventured into kratom. I went on all the forums and read up; ended up buying a sample pack and another 20 grams from a vendor who seemed great.<br /><br />My first experience was with RVT. I was hoping for something opiate-like and sedating which is how this strain is mainly described. I ingested 5 grams (low standard dose) using the TnW method, and felt it coming on about 30 minutes later. It was a slow creep, a bit of warming from the back of my neck to my eyes and up to my brain. I took this as a great sign. I enjoyed this feeling for roughly 40 minutes before I started to get nausea and headed to the bathroom. I did not need to relieve myself, and started to become a bit lightheaded and flushed. I then went into my bed and curled up under the sheets and watch some movie while being a bit itchy and feeling overheated and uncomfortable. <br /><br />At this point I knew RVT was not for me. <br /><br />I tried to get into the strains considered more stimulating and euhporant and smoother and tried another 6 different strains. None of these strains had any affect in doses up to 7 grams, sadly. I finally got my hands on some stuff called &quot;White Lightning&quot; which was suppose to be the cream of the crop when it comes to energetic kratom; yet I was sadly disappointed that I could get no effects.<br /><br />Now before going into kratom I knew I was extremely naturally tolerant to opiates. Yet the only kratom that seemed to affect me was the opiate-like strain. <br /><br />I have not tried kratom since and have given up on it sadly.

				I enjoyed Kratom but I have to say it made me kind of irritable after I&#039;d come down and a little the next day, sort of like after opiates or alcohols.&nbsp; Not everyone is the same.&nbsp; But I found this to be the case, fwiw.

Anti-inflammatory, Anti-allergenic, Relaxation, Light Stimulation, and Meditation/State of Trance.<br /><br />It&#039;s wide range of effects, ranging from symptomatic relief of opiate withdrawals, stomach aches, head aches, bloating, fatigue, stress, etc.<br />Vary vastly between the potency and maturity of the leaf.<br />Plus the amount taken.&nbsp; Less = Energetic - More = Sedating<br />With a combination of strains you can mix and match to accommodate almost anything you need achieved.<br /><br />Most White Vein strains tend to be energetic and slightly euphoric.<br />Green Veins are right in the middle, great legs, solid body, and a mixture of stress relief, and pain relief.<br />Red Veins are the top, they tend to be highly euphoric, relaxants, strong pain relief, and great for insomnia and meditation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Negatives - Physical Addiction, Constipation, Nausea @ High Doses, Vomiting @ High Doses, Dizziness and Light Headedness (Which also are more likely to occur at higher dosages).<br /><br />Kratom is truly a god send and any true connoisseur should keep copious amounts of it in his stash box.<br />The potential for this plant is endless, just like marijuana.<br />Which combine with beautiful synergy.<br />I have never experienced any kind of trouble taking kratom with almost any other drug.&nbsp; <br />Minus alcohol, but that&#039;s pretty much poison. Kratom and Alcohol = puke fest.<br />It&#039;s extremely friendly, helpful, and always there for you when you need it.<br /><br />Though at times, it can&#039;t solve every problem in the world.<br />For people with severe pain, kratom more than likely won&#039;t quite dampen it.<br />In combination with some high potency cannabis this would be a much safer and natural alternative to heavy opiates.<br />Opiate tolerant people will only find that kratom dampens their withdrawal symptoms and returns them to some sense of normalcy.<br /><br />It&#039;s undoubtedly one of my favorite drugs.<br />Ranking my favorites in order.<br /><br />1) LSD<br />2) Kratom<br />3) MDA/MDMA<br />4) Cannabis<br />5) MXE<br /><br />Worst drugs in order.<br /><br />1) Alcohol (Especially in combination with Cocaine and Benzodiazepines)<br />2) 25I-NBOMe<br />3) Mephedrone<br />4) Nicotine<br />5) Methamphetamine<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably add some honorable mentions as this list is obviously subjective.<br />That&#039;s pretty much it for now, hope it was informative and feel free to shoot any questions you might have.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful,<br />Vanquish<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If i could give you a +1 I would!<br /><br />We looked through this post and we don&#039;t think we could have done a better job ourselves, nothing seems inaccurate to us!&nbsp; We are planning on starting a vendor account to bring our personal blends and extracts to SR, along with other things one may need when combating withdraws.<br /><br />The members of our team also have extensive experience with kratom going back a decade.&nbsp; We are also here to answer questions if need be.<br /><br />thanks for posting this!&nbsp; <br /><br />sincerely,<br />KratomUSA <br />
