				Hello folks,<br /><br />I never thought days like these would have ever arrived, but sadly I am living an horrible reality right now.<br /><br />I want to point out that it wasn&#039;t my first time using mdma, and I haven&#039;t touched any drugs for a couple of months before last friday night, and I was feeling great.<br /><br />So here&#039;s the story. Friday night my mates and I went to dance and I wanted to try out this new MDMA that one of my long time mates had, I swallowed a 0.3 (if not more) all at once and after an hour I believe we shared a 0.4 in four .. So I would assume I had a total of half gram or close to that in 2 hours, and the MDMA itself was way too strong and good..<br /><br />Went back home the morning after, slept just fine, woke up in the late afternoon very frustrated, thought it was normal, had a meal and went to work. I started feeling overheating while at work but I was more than alright.<br /><br />The day after is where everything begun.. My head started spinning so bad, I couldn&#039;t watch the TV, not even the computer, couldn&#039;t watch lights, and I threw up everytime I put something in my stomach.<br /><br />Today, two days later I must to say things seems to be a bit better, although I am having huge concentrating troubles, I can&#039;t watch the sun light through the window, I can&#039;t focus on an object for more than a bunch of seconds otherwise I feel disturbed, if I watch TV after few minutes I feel I have to throw up, and what makes me very concerned is that I feel my brain burning up in different locations (spots) at different times, and I am always feeling disoriented, like lost or something like that.<br /><br />I have no idea of what is going on here, but I am really scared and I am literally in tears right now. I have never experienced anything like that before but if this is how it has to be forever I swear god it&#039;s better to die straight up.<br /><br />Only thing that gives me a little bit of tranquility is to sleep.<br /><br />You guys think is this something that will stay permanently? Can I do anything to feel better? Should I see a doctor at this point?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what else to say... I am literally down..<br /><br />Thanks <br /><br />

				500mg in two hours is WAY too much, stating the obvious now I know, a standard dose should be around 120mg for an average person.<br /><br />MDMA can be neurotoxic but I suspect all you have done is depleted your serotonin levels to a point you feel like shit and are now feeling depressed. From what you describe your body is also now having a reaction to the chemicals you put into it, you overdid it.<br /><br />There are natural ways you can help replenish your serotonin and some supplements can help, I suggest you give your body a good rest, eat some fresh fruit and drink plenty of fluids (water) to give your body a cleanse and leave the mollie alone for a few months minimum.<br /><br />I have overdone it myself a few times and felt horrendous for days and like you had problems with being sick, it has in my experience though passed.<br /><br />If you are in real trouble though see a doctor.

				definitely over did it, i learned that myself after my first music festival. Had headaches, brain zips, dizzyness for over a week. Worst feelings ever and like you said the only thing that felt better was sleeping. Nothing you can really do now, just eat normal, sleep alot, stay hydrated. One thing that helped me a little was headache relieve medicine, the over the counter stuff.

				I read a smilar thread on here recently , where someone has used some Molly and had some alcohol her friend ended up going to Hospital due to having vertigo symptoms , my suggestion is drink plenty of fluids see how it goes in the next 24 hrs if you have a good relationship with your GP go and see them , now this needs to be done under MEDICAL supervision but they MIGHT prescribe some low dose benzo to increase your serotonin level but this has to be done under MEDICAL supervision. Hope you get better mate&nbsp;

				I once did the mistake aswell and dropped a 0,5g bomb. Yet I&#039;m still alive. After that night I decided to quit MDMA for good, I&#039;d suggest you to take at least a longer break.<br />Good luck dude and don&#039;t worry too much, it makes you feel more worse than it is.

				Is it possible your MDMA was cut with 4-MMC?<br /><br />I ask because a good friend of mine did over 2g of 4mmc in a 10 hour period and suffered for 8 days after use. A lot of his story is very very similar to yours.<br /><br />They were in capsules of about 250mg each and he thinks he took 10 but remembered for sure taking 7. This was mixed with alcohol throughout the night. He said it was the best E he has ever had but it was tested to be 4-mmc afterward.<br /><br />He called me complaining he was unable to see, everything was blurry and fuzzy and he would lose focus visually as well as exhaust his mind trying to figure anything out. I assured him it would pass and gave him 3 .25mg Xanax for his worries. He did not eat anything from Friday until Monday night when his wife and I talked him into eating and he would just puke and was getting really weak. This pattern continued through the week, and Thursday was the day he could eat and drink and keep it down. He then started to regain his brain-power and his vision was clearing up. I gave him Xanax for sleep and it seemed to really help EVERYTHING but only after he ate, the other days it just made him less worried that he was going to be stuck like that forever. The days he ate and took the Xanax, he would have a positive outlook on the situation and be much more rational. &quot;I know this won&#039;t last forever, I&#039;m just stupid and fucked up and overdid it. Maybe I should be dead but I know I&#039;m getting better&quot; type of thoughts instead of &quot;I&#039;m going to be stuck like this and never be able to do shit normally again&quot;. (I&#039;ve never seen a person so helpless behind their own eyes.)<br /><br />On Friday he noticed (with food+xanax sleep) things were leveling out VERY good for him and he was even back to drinking alcohol but found it caused anxiety and stopped. Saturday is when he knew he&#039;d be ok. By Monday he was back to normal for the most part. But, he does tell me when he drinks a certain beer and does a small bump of coke, he starts to get that same feeling back of being &quot;lost&quot; and it freaks him out. <br /><br />I do hope you the best but give it some time. Your brain is trying to re-work and replenish, give it food and rest and remember people have done much worse and come out fine. Keep that in mind, no matter how hard it is.<br /><br />I would say see a dr if you aren&#039;t good within 10-12 days. But, my advice is unimportant to all things. Good luck.

				4-MMC ?? Is it Mephedrone or whatever is called???<br /><br />He didn&#039;t mention it was cut with anything like that, all he told me that it was very strong and that I should have gone easy with it.<br /><br />However though I had a weird feeling about this last night. I was trying to get some sleep while I started seeing like white balloons floating all over my eyes, and I have heard of some people having experienced this kind of thing after a dose of mephedrone.&nbsp; So kinda weird.<br /><br />Guys I don&#039;t know what the hell this was, all I can say is that this guy here is like a brother to me and he wouldn&#039;t ever gave something that would fuck me up, even though he did.<br /><br />And I am not only the one who got sick from this stuff, my ex gf had a couple of collapses after having a 0.25 of this stuff that night, she wasn&#039;t responding at all for like 15 minutes, but then thank god she started cooperating and she ended up having a great night, though right now she&#039;s in the same situation as me, maybe a bit better.<br /><br /><br />Thankfully I am feeling a bit better, had lunch without the puke feeling, I can be at the computer for about an hour now, just have to close my eyes sometimes when I am about to feel my head starting to spin or getting heavy, I can watch a little bit of TV and most importantly I can stand up and talk with people without the feeling of being lost.<br /><br />I want to hope the brain is working it out just like u guys have said, and I want to thank you all for your solidarity and for ur good words that are giving me some hopes again.<br /><br />If I will get through this I am done with MDMA for good now.<br /><br />

				You all just took too much, too much of anything won&#039;t feel good. Fortunately it won&#039;t do you any long term (physical) harm and you&#039;ll be back to normal soon enough. Eat, rest, etc.<br />If it puts you off completely that&#039;s not a bad thing, but at a minimum perhaps you&#039;ll be more careful about doses in future. You can just google that shit, no excuse really dude.

				Ohh i feel you ,&nbsp; i have been there so many times after taking&nbsp; does of&nbsp; 2 / 3 /4 /5 pills or large doses of MDMA (years ago, i do not use that now cause)<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry you will feel better in a matter of days,&nbsp; just be smart enough to:<br />1. take braked between MDMA sessions <br />2. keep normal doses that will not kiil your serotonin.<br />3. know when is the time that using MDMA causing such a down that&nbsp; the &quot;high&quot; doesn&#039;t pay anymore - and than say goodbye to MDMA :)

				yeah i mean.... from what i know you will have some damage for a while(not trying to scare, just being realistic based on personal experience).... damage that wont ever go away if you dont stop using substances(serotonin receptors rebuild themselves over the course of about a year of sobriety, from what ive read) i have a friend that took 7 tenths in a night and he truly wasnt ever the same(any time he would speak his statements would hold NO relevance to the conversations at hand, as well as simply having a terrible memory and his thought processing just not really functioning).... ive never done a half g of actual mdma, ive only ever done 2.5-3 tenths at once.. but even then man, i have massive holes in my memory. damage that wasnt there from the dmt and psilocybin i had ingested multiple times before trying molly... get sommadat 5-htp, and take a good long break from stims if you can, it gets better and better over time.<br /><br /><br />dont assume that brain damage makes you less intellectual, or that it takes away from who you are as a person. you are still you!<br />&nbsp;just give yourself some time recover, do that favor for the one human vessel youve been given =)

				diesel, unless you have done your research dont try to put down valid information. mdma mows over dentritic spines in the brain, and those spines help regulate the release of neurochemicals. yeah sure you feel &quot;okay&quot; but that doesnt mean there isnt some underlying damage done to you. i put in quotations earlier &quot;noticable or not&quot; because its been proven that mdma causes some damage. sweet jesus this is the problem with drug users.. they want to rave about how wonderful the shit they take is and as soon as something negative is stated about it they get offended. you should attempt to remove your personal bias from this situation and do some research yourself friend. there have been people that have died from taking the amount you took, and you really dont think you did anything damaging to yourself? your not fucking superman, understand your mortality. (sorry if im being a bit aggressive but i do my research extensively... i know what im talking about.)

				Hey man, not to discredit any one here that has gave their thoughts, but i dont believe you simply &#039;over did it&#039;. 500mg really isnt that much imo. I have only done straight MDMA once before, and I snorted .3 and ate the other .2, I felt next to nothing. I have used lots of E pills in my day, like, A LOT, and every time i ate like 6 or 7 pills the night before, i felt like absolute shit the entire next day. Ive read that its really just because the chems greatly lower your immune system. Im sure you will be fine, just take some vitamin C tablets, hot soup and bed for the day. Good luck friend.

				I have been like this since Saturday though, however I&#039;m feeling much better today,<br />I still have a little bit of brain burning, though much much lower than it was two days ago,<br />and I can&#039;t wait for it to go away and start my normal activities again.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure this is going to leave some permanent damage to the brain, but better live with it and not feeling it<br />than live with it and feeling it.

				Just harden the fuck up, if you take drugs that make you feel good more than likely you will feel shit later on always make sure you have speed or ice to help get you through your day to day activities after havin fun and maybe stop taking drugs you obviously don&#039;t know what your doing or how to respect them

				those seem to be reasonable studies but they dont talk about dosage really. i dont think that a tenth or two is going to do anything noticeably bad to someone whatsoever but idk, could be wrong.&nbsp; i found another study thats on mda but it includes that mda is a metabolite of mdma so i imagine its still valid information<br /><br />http://www.bioportfolio.com/resources/pmarticle/137264/Effect-Of-3-4-methylenedioxyamphetamine-On-Dendritic-Spine-Dynamics-In-Rat-Neocortical.html<br /><br />i know its on rats but still. mammalian brains.

				MDMA is neurotoxic. This is known. And yes you did push it a bit. BUT, all will be well and whatever minor &quot;damage&quot; may have happened will heal. My suggestion is to rest from drugs entirely for at least 3 months, eat very well, stay fully hydrated and sleep well. Cut down on even minor stimulants such as tea and coffee during this time, and get onto 5-HTP now and stay on it for a couple of weeks in order to assist with serotonin depletion. And RELAX about it - you&#039;ll be cool. Lessons learned ;)

				It will pass, the dizzyness is caused by temporary messed up depth perception.

				300mg is a very very high dose - especially if you&#039;re lighter than 100kg (220 pounds) or MORE SO if you are a woman! You likely depleted all your serotonin all in one go - and the redose made things worse. It&#039;ll take a week at least for your brain to get itself sorted out (you should be feeling better now than before of course). Please get some 5-HTP supplements and a good multivitamin to get yourself back in shape. Additionally, you should consider investing in antioxidant bottles (various types), it can only help.<br /><br />For immediate relief, don&#039;t forget the magical medicinal properties of marijuana! Don&#039;t do too much! Just take a puff or two, or a hit from a bong (smoother is better). Better yet, get a vape! Less smoke = better high. Just puff twice, wait a few minutes, puff more if you are still feeling shitty. You want a low level buzz that will help your brain relax. MJ will simulate serotonin in this instance to make you feel less shitty.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
