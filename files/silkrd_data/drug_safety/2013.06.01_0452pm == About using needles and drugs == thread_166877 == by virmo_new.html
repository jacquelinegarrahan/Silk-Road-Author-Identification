				We know some people that do not get the effect they are searching from drugs anymore.<br />We would like to give advice to those people about IV&#039;ing.<br /><br />What can be Iv&#039;ed? How to do so, for example can ketamine be IV&#039;ed? If so how to purify it so it can be done?<br />We only know this from movies with heroin but this seems like an endless addiction leading to morphine in the end.<br /><br />

				Well a safe way is use sterile needle and not share or reuse them (this step is vital), use sterile water, a sterile spoon or container where you mix the water and the substance (you can also disinfect a clean spoon with isopropyl alcohol, should be sterile enough), disinfect the area you&#039;re going to inject, and use a 0.22 micrometer wheelfilter/syringe filter. This type of filter will remove all impurities and will even filter out bacteria, so it&#039;s pretty cool. When using a 0.22um filter, you don&#039;t necessarily need to use sterile water in the first place because bacteria get filtered out of the solution, but it&#039;s still better. It&#039;s also important not to heat the solution like you see in movies. Heating can disinfect but it doesn&#039;t disinfect so well and it makes harmful particles temporarily soluble, after they enter your veins, the temperature drops and those particles become solid again and can clog your veins, most notoriously in your lungs, which can kill you because even though you&#039;re breathing, the oxygen can&#039;t reach your blood if the vessels are clogged.<br /><br />If you use the setup described above though, even missing a vein won&#039;t do much harm because it won&#039;t get infected. Sometimes, especially for things with a lot of fillers like pills, it&#039;s better to filter it one time with a cotton and then use the wheelfilter or else you can clog it. The 0.45 um wheelfilters are good too but they don&#039;t filter bacteria out, just particles. Using a cigarette filter or just cotton isn&#039;t a good idea, sterile cotton is somewhat better.<br /><br />EDIT : to answer your other question, anything that is water soluble can be IV&#039;d, so Ketamine, Cocaine, Amphetamine, Heroin, Morphine, oxycodone (hydrocodone and codeine can be injected but will most likely kill you because they release too much histamine), fentanyl, pretty much all opiates except those similar to codeine, some benzos like Midazolam and Loprazolam, DMT, other psychedelic salts, LSD, barbiturates, a lot of pharms in general, even GHB can be injected and is used like that in anesthesia, I can&#039;t think of anything else but pretty much anything can be injected, a member on here reported about injecting 2C-B. <br />IV is mostly used for opiates though, ketamine should be IM&#039;d or taken subcutaneously because some people go to the K-hole before pulling the needle out which isn&#039;t so good.

				I wonder why have have so much bad karma. You are being helpful. Although it&#039;s hard to understand sometimes but that;s because we are not 100% english.<br /><br />Where are you from?<br />We have needles But I accidentally pinched my finger with it. So it&#039;s not to be shared anymore. I dont have aids or something but it&#039;s just not recommended.<br />How to sterilize it again and how/where to get sterile water?<br />Sterile water is distilled water, no?<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have that much bad karma... +27 vs -12 is a pretty good ratio I think. The important thing is the ratio, not the actual amount, for example, Pine has maybe like -200 even though she&#039;s the most helpful member here, but she has a lot more good karma and real good ratio. You also get bad karma for calling out scammers or things like that that won&#039;t please somebody. For example yesterday, before saying that a user will probably get scammed because a vendor asked him to FE for a pretty big order, I had -10, after saying that, I had -12. I didn&#039;t called that vendor a scammer, I just said people have complained of scams from that vendor and that FE is usually how people scam, and I got -2, from the vendor and a supporter of his probably.<br /><br />You pinched your finger with a needle? ::) why?<br />To sterilize it, throw it away and take a new needle, that&#039;s what you do when a needle has been used. You can put it in bleach for 10 minutes but bleach isn&#039;t very good for your veins. If you have an autoclave you can safely reuse needles, as autoclaves are used in the medical profession to sterilize medical apparatus, but it&#039;s expensive so unless you really want to reuse needles, just use a new one that costs like $0,10. It must touch nothing but air and your vein, and the substance you inject, but don&#039;t make the needle touch things even like a table or the floor. If the syringe falls but the needle didn&#039;t touch anything then it&#039;s okay though. And don&#039;t leave the needle exposed too long too, only remove the cap when you&#039;re going to inject, or else dust gets on it and you can get parasites and whatever crap&#039;s in dust in your veins.<br /><br />Sterile water can be bought at the pharmacy but they&#039;ll know you want to inject something if you ask for that. You can buy that, along with needles and 0,22um filters on amazon.de, it&#039;s the German amazon that has the biggest choice in needles, and also has wheelfilters. The US amazon has more different wheelfilters but the ones on amazon.de is already perfect so no need to get it from overseas. Distilled water isn&#039;t always sterile, freshly distilled water is but nothing stays sterile for long. To buy anonymously, buy an amazon gift card with cash and pay with that to get your stuff, it&#039;s not really necessary since it&#039;s not illegal but it&#039;s better if you can get it shipped to an anonymous drop location.

				As Tree said, once you have used a needle, throw it away and get a new one.&nbsp; While it is possible to re-use a disposable needle if you can disinfect it, actually disinfecting it is difficult. Also, using a needle just one time dulls the point.&nbsp; You would be amazed what the point of a used needle looks like after one use, compared to a brand new one.&nbsp; The used needle will still penetrate your skin, but it will do so with much less ease.&nbsp; You really don&#039;t want to get an abscess, I&#039;ve had a couple and they are absolutely no fun and they really hurt.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first time I had an abscess I left it alone, thinking it would go away.&nbsp; In three days my arm was swollen from the elbow to my wrist and there were red lines going up and down my forearm.&nbsp; I ended up having to get intravenous antibiotics for 10 days.&nbsp; That was after the doctor at the emergency room cut it open and damn near killed me squeezing my arm to get as much of the infection out as possible before packing it and starting the IV.&nbsp; I had a 1 inch hole in my arm for a good two to three weeks until it healed.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also, Tree mentioned that anything water soluble can be injected and he lists a number of different types of pills.&nbsp; There is one caveat however.&nbsp; First, most pills have filler as he mentioned, you absolutely do not want to get any of that into your veins, so filter, filter, filter.&nbsp; Secondly a large number of pills these days use anti-abuse formulas.&nbsp; The new OxyContin&#039;s like the Oxy 80&#039;s gel up the minute they touch water and you shouldn&#039;t even try to filter that as you are bound to get some of the filler in the needle.&nbsp; If you do go the Oxy&nbsp; route, make sure you either get pills that are anti-abuse free or you look up a way to defeat the anti-abuse mechanism in the pills (which isn&#039;t easy).<br /><br />You mention heroin and it leading to morphine and addiction.&nbsp; Please be aware that heroin and morphine are opiates, heroin is just a stronger form.&nbsp; Both are addicting.&nbsp; Also included in that class are all the Oxy types such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone and various other opiate variants.&nbsp; They are ALL the same, just differing strengths. They are ALL just as addictive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck :)

				True about the OxyContin like the OP, it&#039;s also the case with most morhine pills, morphine and oxy pills over 30mg are always ER so if want to inject them you should process them (24hours in completely dry acetone gets the opiates out, even with the OP, then just pour the acetone on a pan or something similar, it&#039;ll evaporate super quickly and you&#039;re left with some easy to inject powder, not 100% oxy or morphine, but better that a roxi or a IR morphine.<br /><br />You should always have antibiotics in handy in case you get cotton fever or another infection. You don&#039;t really want to go to the ER and have something like that on your medical record. Not to mention you can get into legal trouble in some areas. A good oral antibiotic like doxycycline will usually do the trick, but if you use wheelfilters you don&#039;t have to worry about anything like that, even if you do a bad shot. Your abscess must&#039;ve sucked though..<br /><br />I think what virmo wanted to say about heroin was that it quickly metabolizes into morphine, which is true. It just gives you a better rush because first, the inactive heroin gets in your brain, and then becomes morphine, which makes you have more morphine at once than if you just take morphine, but I&#039;m not sure. It&#039;s more potent though because it crosses the blood-brain barrier more easily which is why you need 1.5 times less pure heroin than you&#039;d need morphine. But heroin and morphine give you the same high, just a different rush, from what I&#039;ve heard. I&#039;ve never had heroin so I can&#039;t tell. <br /><br />And virmo, what do you want to inject? Ketamine? If so, I recommend just doing it subcutaneously, inject it very slowly in the fat of your stomach. It works pretty much as well as IM but it doesn&#039;t hurt nearly as much. You shouldn&#039;t try IV ketamine on your own in case you&#039;re one of those that k-hole before pulling out the needle.. Because then you could bleed if the needle falls, or the needle could just damage your vein by staying in so long and moving around.

The only injectable DMT I&#039;ve found was fumarate. Physicians or similar surely have hydrochloride or even totally synthetic DMT, but I never seen it available around, maybe also because smoking is the most usual way of using DMT so other methods are not as much popular as to warrant someone the trouble to import them in the illegal market. Moreover most of the people that sell DMT extract it by themselves and it&#039;s naturally much easier to use a freebase extract method; the use of DMT is not so high to warrant chimical labs to produce the substance illegally as it happens, for example, with Ketamine.<br /><br />As a comparison 4-ACO-DMT is easy to find also here in the SR as fumarate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166877.msg1188738#msg1188738">Quote from: tree on June 01, 2013, 10:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166877.msg1188105#msg1188105">Quote from: BlackIris on June 01, 2013, 08:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">IV DMT almost turns smoking it into slowdown time (at last in the beginning phase).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What do you mean by that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That it hits you at even more potency than smoking. The &quot;roller-coaster&quot; part of the trip is even more intense than with smoking. I&#039;ve tried IV DMT only twice and when I returned to smoking the &quot;hit&quot; part of the trip seemed in comparison like taking MAOI with smoked DMT; this is the best metaphor I can find if you have used MAOI with DMT and you know the difference in the way the &quot;hit&quot; part acts in that case.
