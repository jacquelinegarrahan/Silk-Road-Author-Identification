				Title: <strong>Recommendations?</strong><br />

				Hey all.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in exploring recreational drugs, but I&#039;m concerned about possible interactions.&nbsp; Currently prescribed 37.5mg of Effexor daily and 100mg of Wellbutrin daily.&nbsp; I am more than willing to drop the Effexor if that&#039;s a huge contraindication for any possible drug, as I have been able to get off of it easily and without withdrawal before in the past.&nbsp; The Wellbutrin is new, so I don&#039;t know how my body would react to a sudden shortage of it.<br /><br />With that said, I think it&#039;s apparent that my main goal here is to self-medicate depression.&nbsp; After many years of trying therapy and prescription antidepressants of different kinds and dosages, I&#039;m tired of it all.&nbsp; The system is just a bummer.<br /><br />The depression manifests itself in extreme lethargy, low mood, and a poor outlook on life.&nbsp; I also have mild social anxiety, if that&#039;s worth noting.<br /><br />Of course I don&#039;t expect any drug to be a miracle fix-it solution.&nbsp; I&#039;m just looking for some recommendations to expand my horizons - particularly the expansion part, as I work full-time in a creative field, and I&#039;m kind of curious how drugs would effect that.<br /><br />Note:&nbsp; I already have some weed on the way.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; I placed this in this forum mainly because of the drug interaction concern.&nbsp; I apologize if it&#039;s the wrong place!

				If you are worried about interactions are you aware the two medications you mentioned actually could be considered risky to take together given a few interactions? First, venlafaxine slightly reduces the seizure threshold and other drugs that do as well, such as buproprion, should be avoided. Second, buproprion is an inhibitor of the CYP2D6 hepatic enzyme which is responsible for the metabolism of venlafaxine and raises the plasma concentrations to dangerous levels in some individuals. <br /><br />Obviously with the drugs you are on you must absolutely avoid any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase (mao-i) so no ayahausca or anything... <br /><br />unfortunately if you have mental issues self medicating can be the absolute worse reason&nbsp; to use drugs. if you are interested in the experience or even for expansion of your reality or spiritual enlightenment, even for therapeutic introspection, some drugs can be wonderful tools. just be careful, cause like in my cause a little opiate use for anxiety, mild depression and gastro issues lead to an H addiction given the pharm prices. taking the drugs to feel better is when it gets really dangerous and you really get addicted, and it happens slowly. <br /><br />for the horizon stretching I would definitely recommend a psychedelic like lsd which is great for introspection and shaking your reality apart so you can really assess your situation from a novel perspective and piece things back together. problem is a risk (never really heard of it happening) of serotonin syndrome exists with serotonergic drugs and venlafaxine. generallly snris just block tripping rather than resulting in SS though. if you are willing to stop use for two weeks, then I think your desensitization should pretty much be gone and receptor levels normalized. the buproprion is most directly effective as a noradrenergic and dopaminergic system modulator and therefore should have little effect on a psychedelic experience. it could possibly detract slightly from a mdma or coke experience for example.
