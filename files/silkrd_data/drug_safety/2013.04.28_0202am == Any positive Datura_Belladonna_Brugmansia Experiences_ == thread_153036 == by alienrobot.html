				Despite all the negative feedback I hear and read, I do want to try one of these in my lifetime.&nbsp; I believe that being in a safe and controlled environment around people that I love and trust (and who know what the experience is like), would lessen the possibility of something horrible happening, but there&#039;s always that possibility of going too far....&nbsp; Has anyone had a positive experience using a deliriant plant?&nbsp;

				Just check the erowid experience reports. Most of them are no good... and you can easily go blind by smoking too much or too potent a strain.<br /><br />If you want to get fucked up or see new things, stick to the hundreds of nontoxic psychedelics and dissociatives that are already available.

				Oh, I know where to look for reports, and have had many experiences with a wide variety of psychedelics over the past 15 years.&nbsp; I should just steer clear of these, but I&#039;m curious about the effect of hallucinogenic plants on the brain.&nbsp; I&#039;m more interested in the brain&#039;s reactions than being fucked up.&nbsp; Just curious if anyone here has an experience to share.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Do it if you rreally want to. you know the risks...<br /><br />get a sitter! and try some of the lighter plants. dont go straight for datura!&nbsp; research this subject more. if you dont know all the plants containing atropine and scopolamine alcaloids..... <br />find the one that has a rich history of &quot;safe&quot; use...&nbsp; <br />

				i&#039;ve heard that you can&#039;t take this stuff lightly.&nbsp; like, you gotta go find a plant that speaks to you and raise some plants from its seeds and then choose one to use.&nbsp; and then you&#039;re stepping onto a path of real heavy magic that you can never really turn back on.&nbsp; i guess its all about the art of spirit walking and just accepting your present surroundings as they appear and forget worrying what is &quot;real&quot; or not.&nbsp; but your perception of reality gets kinda tweaked for the rest of your life and you always have to wonder if you&#039;re hallucinating or not.&nbsp; but i guess its like that anyway.<br /><br />well i&#039;ve never tried it and don&#039;t have any plans, but good luck if you do.&nbsp; and let me know because i find this stuff very fascinating as well.

				There is a lot of that in N.Carolina. Everybody in my platoon took it (actually about 15 people) nobody really liked it. I couldn&#039;t open my combination lock for 3 days, everything close was blurry. I looked in the mirror and scared myself, I had these eyes that were read and kind of BURNING looking back at me. One of the guys didn&#039;t come down for 3 days. He was walking into wall lockers all night and talking to himself. They put him in the hospital for 3 days and he was told he could have died. Stuff I tried were these pods about 2 inches in diameter and grew on the ground. Split them and ate the seeds. Ate 2 pods. Takes a good couple of hours. <br />I went to visit my friend in the hospital and he was talking about kids walking in to talk with him from a window. He was on the third floor, though. Main (or one of the ingredients) is atropine. <br />I&#039;d never do it again. We were in our late teens (nobody over 20 years old) nobody I knew ever tried it again. <br />Deleriant is a good name for it. <br />Try that Salvia stuff-sounds like it won&#039;t hurt you. That datura just took too long and had too many side effects.

				The only positive reports I know of are of those who combined a small amount of datura with opium and cannabis.
