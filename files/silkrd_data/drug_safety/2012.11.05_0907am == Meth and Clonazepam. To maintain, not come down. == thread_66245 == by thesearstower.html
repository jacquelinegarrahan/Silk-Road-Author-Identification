				Does anyone have any experience with a meth/clonazepam combo? I&#039;m going out in public in a few hours, and even though I haven&#039;t taken that much (~90mg of Hammertime&#039;s gear, over 24 hours), I&#039;d prefer not to look like the twacked-out idiot that I am.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m just looking to take the edge off a bit. I don&#039;t want to pass out or fall asleep. Will 1mg put me down? Or will it bounce off of me like bullets off of superman?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I rarely take benzos. I&#039;ve also got a bunch of Baclofen, if anyone thinks that might help.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				This is my preferred combo and at times life saver in terms of dealing with comedowns, especially during times when life demanded full functionality. It&#039;ll take me from paranoid/anxious hermit to my normal self in minutes. <br /><br />Considering that you rarely take benzos, I recommend staring with 0.25-0.5 mg. Allow it time to kick in, up to an hour. For me the effects begin very soon, especially on an empty stomach (&lt;20 min). If that doesn&#039;t cut it, increase by the same amount (0.25-0.5 mg). <br />A full milligram may put you out depending on your sensitivity. 2 mg probably will probably put you out if your well into your crash and haven&#039;t touched meth for several hours our more. <br /><br />Personally, I find benzos are a must when I indulge. Both to take the edge off comedowns (often virtually eliminating them), and to balance out some the body load that comes with some of the less desirable batches.<br /><br />Too much benzo, however, will hinder the desirable effects (though clonazapam is much more forgiving in this regard and one of the many reasons I prefer it over alprazolam).<br /><br />Clonazepam, when used in therapeutic dose/moderation is safe to use for this purpose. <br /><br />It&#039;s a wonderful drug and it&#039;s a shame that it&#039;s so scarce/costly on SR relative to alprazolam (which also does the job, but I prefer the later).

				Good combo indeed, but do not take too much klon. I had a VERY strange experience once, started taking klons during the fourth day of a meth binge, took maybe 10mg or so over the course of some hours (8? 12? not sure). Ended up having a completely incredible psychedelic experience with intense euphoria, the night sky lit up in a rainbow of morphing fractals, it was actually really awesome. However this was followed by something of a catatonic state lasting 30+ minutes that no one could bring me out of, ambulance was almost called but I came back to not even realizing it had happened and wondering where my lovely visuals went. Was never able to duplicate the experience so I have no idea what happened, but caution is advised&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I would agree to no more than .5mg for starters.

				I doubt its a good combination really. A stimulant and a hypnotic at the same time seems like asking for trouble since they will counteract eachother on the main mechanism of action. <br /><br />You may experience the side effects of one of them, or both, and that can be a nice experience, or a very bad one. <br /><br />A psychedelic experience should not be triggered by either substance on its own, but it can happen since the main effects cancel each other out, leaving you whatever remains. This can be a nice trip, but also a very bad one, with no sure way to tell how it turns out. <br /><br />Personally i&#039;d rather take something that is supposed to cause a trip like LSD, with the option if ending a bad one using benzo&#039;s or such. Benzo&#039;s are far less likely to stop a problem induced by stimulants since they are counteractive.

				Thanks for the replies. Looking back, I&#039;d say botbahn was right on the money. I ended up taking .5mg, and it was just right. My body relaxed, my mind relaxed, and I was able to go about my business just fine. I had enough meth in my system to still be awake and alert, but the clonazepam took the rough edge off.<br /><br />Also, I have experience with both meth and clonazepam seperately, so I wasn&#039;t just randomly combining drugs. I already basically knew what I was getting into.<br />
