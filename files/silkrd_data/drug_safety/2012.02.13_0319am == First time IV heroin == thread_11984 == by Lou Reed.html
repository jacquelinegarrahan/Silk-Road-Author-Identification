				Just wondering if someone can point me in the right direction for IV&#039;ing H for the first time. I think I have it down, but want to make sure before I make the plunge. ;D I&#039;ve been a nasal user of H for years, but have never shot it. Now that I can get some pretty pure dope, I wouldn&#039;t mind giving it a try. I will be getting the dope from either Tony76, or wumg00.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t have a mg scale, so I think like two match heads might be a place to start? How much water do you put in the spoon? My guess would be like 1 1/2 syringes full? Heat lightly til dissolved, and draw up through a piece of cotton? My plan is to inject in one of the veins in the top of my foot to avoid a noticeable mark. Is this o.k.? Any help will be greatly appreciated!!<br /><br />Peace!

				I insufflate so no needles for me, but I would say that you dont want to use so much water. Maybe if it was tar and you had to boil, but for the #4 powder it should dissolve quick with just a touch of heat. Shouldnt really be boiling much of the fluid off, and I wouldnt expect to lose that much filtering. Someone might need to correct me though.&nbsp; Dont over heat it is one of the main things I have heard or youll deacetylate it. <br /><br />Also, a recommendation of dose will be difficult, but I may say even start with one match head just to be on the safe side. If you want a recommendation from a more experienced user though you probably need to give some indication of your nasal dose. I think I have read starting IV would be about 1/3 to 1/2 the insufflated dose. <br /><br />You didnt mention sterilizing anything, so dont forget that as well as using a new, clean rig. Good job filtering, just be careful with the cotton fibers cause they can make you really sick. Edit: someone in another thread said its bacteria from unsterilized cotton, not the actual fibers. still doesnt sound like fun.<br /><br />Be safe! Good luck<br />- miR

				Not using an mg scale is irresponsible. &quot;Match head size&quot; is not a standard unit of measurement.&nbsp;

				I have been shooting dope for 15 years. I have never OD&#039;d and I do not have either hepatitis or AIDS. I consider those things to be an accomplishment in a world where accomplishments are hard to come by. I will give you my advice. The first piece I would give is- do you know anyone who is an IV user? If you could track down somebody that has done this a long time, that would be my first choice to get good info and to have someone fix you up the first time and show you exactly how it&#039;s done. If that is impossible, then here&#039;s the rest of my advice. Are you using your standard 1cc insulin syringe? If so, then even a big shot of tony&#039;s dope (I just tried his for the first time this weekend) can be sufficiently dissolved in 4-5 units of water. So a 1 cc syringe would be filled up 40 - 50% full. Then just drop the water on the dope and heat it until it goes from cloudy to clear. There should be no need for a hard boil. Just get it close. Remember, always use the least amount of water possible. This is to reduce the amount of time it takes to do the shot, so you don&#039;t lose the vein mid-push. The second reason to use the smallest amount possible is the rush! The less water used per amount of dope increases the concentration of the solution as it hits your brain. Higher concentration means a better rush! I would also be less concerned about an OD based on the fact that you have been a nasal user and have a tolerance to H. I would just take maybe 3/4 of the amount you usually sniff and just do it. It won&#039;t kill you. There is a lot of fear of OD but this happens mainly in those really old junkies who are trying hard to do a big shot and get the rush, or to the newbie who has no tolerance at all. Next, the LAST place I would shoot would be my foot. There&#039;s a couple reasons for that. As a person who has done this, IT FUCKING HURTS!!! Although it may not seem like it, the best place to shoot is in the crook of your arm. The veins are the biggest, closest to the surface, and there are fewer nerves. If you use clean points and change spots frequently, you don&#039;t need to worry about big bruises. Clean fresh points do wonders for keeping your arms looking presentable. The next reason is the rush! When you shoot in your foot your shot is greatly diluted by the bloodstream in the 5 or 6 feet it takes to get up to your brain. The rush will ALWAYS be better going into your arm, and it will hurt WAY less. If there&#039;s anything else I can tell you, feel free to PM me. Shoot safe, shoot clean!!!

				And one more thing- I can&#039;t attest to wmg&#039;s dope, but Tony is the shit! His shipping was super fast. I ordered over the weekend and I had my envelope in hand the next Sat. That&#039;s 6 business days to the US. I&#039;m hearing about him hitting that mark with most people. Good luck!

				6 year IV user here. First off be careful try a very small sampling for your first shot then figure out what a reasonable dose would be for you. <br /><br />I&#039;d start with a shot less than .1 g. Make sure you figure out what type of dope it is, IE will you need an acid for it to absorb in water or not.<br /><br />Make sure you prepare the dope with sanitary utensils, I suggest buying a box of alcohol swabs to clean shit as much as possible.<br /><br />Finally if the shot is burning at all when you are pushing down you are missing the vein, pull out and re situate the needle. <br /><br />I also suggest taking an anti histamine prior so you don&#039;t have a rugged histamine reaction and break out in hives. Safety and Cleanliness is the name of the game.<br /><br />If you live in an area where you can buy needles without a prescription USE A NEW NEEDLE EVERYSHOT and unless you&#039;re sick and super desperate don&#039;t do cotton shots.<br /><br />Steps:<br /><br />Gather shit (swabs, needle, spoon, tourniquet, cotton, dope, water) + (lighter and acidic solution if needed for tar or non saltbase)<br /><br />Swab your spoon<br /><br />Put tiny amount of dope into the spoon and put in around 10units of water into the spoon<br />Mix the dope until it dissolves<br />roll a tiny piece of cotton and drop into the spoon<br />place tip of the needle into the cotton and draw back the shot<br />shake needle and tap it to get excess air to the top and push air out (tiny bubbles are not a big deal but get rid of the big ones)<br /><br />tie off with tourniquet and find a suitable vein<br />90 degree angle the needle in and pull back on the plunger if you see blood push down slowly.<br /><br />enjoy<br /><br />I have never used acid to absorb or tar heroin so maybe someone else can help you if you cop those.<br /><br />good luck, god speed, and be careful out there buddy shit tends to get crazy once you make the jump to the needle.<br /><br />/jd<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I think I&#039;m gonna hold out a little longer before I give this a try. JD&#039;s comment about things getting crazy kinda made me think a little.

				Ok, I am a recreational IV&#039;er. I am also a university educated medical professional. Over 40 I&#039;m probably older than most here, and have been sticking these sharp things into myself on and off for over 20 years without any major problems or ever needing hospitals/psych help/rehab/etc. I&#039;m not saying that it has ALL been smooth sailing, but do things right and you can reduce your risks significantly. These days I also stick sharp things into people for a living, and to be frank I find it easier to get a 27g 1/2&quot; into myself than a 16 or 18g into a patient. <br /><br />If you decide to go ahead, gather as much info as you can, then try and decide what is true and what is garbage - there&#039;s info everywhere about safer injecting, differences between heroin grades (acids to dissolve), safety etc etc. Knowledge is Power. Harm Minimization techniques ARE worth the trouble. <br /><br />I agree with JoyDivision for the most part, particularly his advice about hygiene - things can never be too clean when bypassing every natural defence you have, and delivering a substance of questionable sterility directly to your bloodstream.&nbsp; I&#039;m not certain what he means by 90 degrees though.....?<br /><br />Should you be worrying about &#039;aiming&#039; i&#039;d suggest starting at somewhere around 30 degrees to the vein. when i did my training for IV cannulation, we we taught to insert @ 30-45 degrees, obtain flashback (register?) then lower to 15-30 degrees before advancing the cannula (from memory, was a while ago!!!) After doing it a few times you&#039;ll stop worrying about the angles and just get an eye or feel for it. Most of the time it&#039;s not difficult. <br /><br /><br />Couple of extra tips, take &#039;em or leave &#039;em...<br /><br />If you can, hold the heel or edge of your hand against the skin while you inject and just slightly tension the skin. The point of your needle can push the skin a few mm before it breaks through, especially with tough skin or an overly gentle technique and this can be enough to move you off target. Some gentle tension helps steady things, and can also reduce veins rolling to some extent. <br /><br />Dosage-wise I&#039;d say start with no more than half your normal IN amount. It WILL hit harder and faster IV, no doubt about it. It&#039;s always easier to add more later than take some back post administration. <br /><br />Bevel up can reduce the amount the needle skids along the outside of a vein before cutting through and entering the lumen (hollow bit that contains blood)<br /><br />Use enough pressure to be smooth, you don&#039;t want to push through and out the other side, but being too gentle can increase both pain and the chances of the vein rolling, or being pushed aside by the needle. <br /><br />Sometimes you may feel additional resistance through the needle as you touch the vein, giving an almost &#039;pop&#039; feeling as you break through. There are people who &#039;look&#039; for this during an injection attempt, and seem to have similar hit/miss ratios to myself, but my personal preference is to try for one smooth movement directly into where you want to be. <br /><br />You&#039;ve snorted before, so aren&#039;t new to H but if you do go ahead, be aware that IV use can often have stronger addictive potential than other methods in some people. There are &#039;recreational&#039; IV users out there, and I&#039;m lucky enough to be one of them, but the vast majority either end up addicted, or having to abstain totally...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you want to get over your fear of needles, do what I did. Shoot some H! The fear will just melt away. Now going to the Dr for blood work is no problem, aside from the nurse being unable to find a vein! JK I&#039;m not that bad yet.
