				I think I injected into an artery on the mid underside of my forearm.&nbsp; I put needle in pulled back and blood shot in pretty fast, it was brighter than usual too not as bright as I thought artery blood would be though.&nbsp; So I started pushing in because it didnt hurt that much, then I got halfway and the plunger became hard to press, so I immediately pulled out.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Now there is minor swelling at injection site and my arm feels kinda numb.&nbsp; There is no discoloration in my hand but the injection site is red and slightly swollen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing hurts but that could be just the heroins effects.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dont think it is a missed vein or skin pop.&nbsp; Its either an artery hit or a nerve hit.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What do I do??&nbsp; Im really freaked out <br />

				It sounds like you hit an artery. Next time be sure its a vein. just clean the area and wait til it gets better. dont inject for some time.<br /><br />Most likely it was some bleeding under the skin. Be careful next time.

				Bumps happen, as long as there is no redness or hotness to the skin (signs of infection) just relax and keep an eye on it.&nbsp; If the bump gets bigger you might need some attention, most of the time it goes away without issue.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found slight massage of a &quot;bump&quot; over time helps reduce it.&nbsp; Read up on safe injection practices just to reassure yourself next time.

				Do not worry, but do not inject heroin again ... you must thoroughly clean the wound and wait for it ... if you took sgondìfia artery you should make your head hurt and burn the whole limb where you have injected the &#039;heroin ... be careful next time!<br /><br />aorry for my bad english..i&#039;m italian...

				You guys are getting off track.<br /><br />Can I inject into my other arm?<br /><br />Also, at the moment, there is no noticable symptoms in my arm where i hit the artery, besides some minor pain and tenderness at injection site.&nbsp; Think im in the clear?

				Could you?&nbsp; Yes I guess, I think the point of the other posters is that your technique is questionable and the liklihood of repeating this or truly hitting an artery are high.
