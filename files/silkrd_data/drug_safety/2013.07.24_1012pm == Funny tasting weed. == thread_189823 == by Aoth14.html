				&nbsp;Never in my life until this year have I tasted weed that tastes like this. its bitter, un-natural tasting. I got some off here that was like that, my bro gets weed from a totally different part of the country, and has been getting the same bitterweed. I dont know if his dude buys off SR but i do know these plants were grown 1500 miles apart. Whats the deal? crappy weed being sprayed with something? The euphoria isnt the same and it makes my breathing worse,not better. I&#039;ve got tons of conspiracy theories in place already.<br /><br />anyone else notice some bitter ass sensemilla going around the country?

				Dunno if it&#039;s what you&#039;re talking about but the dealers around here cover up their shitty shwag weed with Juicy drops. Drives me nuts, weed smells like garbage, wrecks the taste.<br /><br />The UK has an awful market for weed compared to North America though.

				I&#039;ve never gotten any laced or weighed down weed before, except a bag of oregano as a youngster. Maybe a scope would be a good idea.<br /><br />I&#039;m almost positive some distributors are [at least partially] processing bud they specifically grow for keefe, then spraying the nugs to reintroduce potency.&nbsp; Selling processed weed and making a killing off the concentrates. defintely an american typed scam.<br /><br />I dunno. I&#039;m going to start calling vendors out on issues like this.The no-love mutated narco-hulk gmo weed of colorado was bad enough before it started tasting like lemon rinds. Now I&#039;m seeing this shit out of norcal too..<br /><br />or maybe the government is genetically altering men of a certain composition to the point that weed isnt enjoyable anymore? yeaahh, thats it!

				If you are in USA it is probably poorly flushed weed.<br /><br />When the grower adds fertilizer, it is important that they flush the plant before harvest. Otherwise the chemicals remain in the bud and give a bad taste and or bad effects.<br /><br />It is possible the dealer sprays, but that is uncommon in USA.
