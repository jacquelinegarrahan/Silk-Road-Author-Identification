				I&#039;ve ended up with quite the MDMA collection since joining SR (thanks Ivory, tony76, and imprint!).<br /><br />My friend and I each took around 150mg of Ivory&#039;s crystals last Saturday night.&nbsp; He&#039;s rolled a bunch of times before but not in the last couple years.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken MDMA before but never really knew what I was doing and have come close to rolling but don&#039;t think I&#039;ve quite gotten there.<br /><br />My friend is smaller than me and he was rolling pretty hard.&nbsp; I came as close as I ever have, but don&#039;t think I quite made it.<br /><br />Really want to try again, but want to make sure I&#039;m giving my brain time to recover.&nbsp; What do people recommend for time between doses?<br /><br />Thanks a lot.

				2 weeks is the usual minimum that is suggested but I personally would recommend closer to 3-4 weeks

If you don&#039;t regularly experiment with other drugs and take the right vitamins, then two weeks should be fine. If you don&#039;t then three or four weeks should be plenty! Have fun with that collection, because it sounds like it&#039;ll last you a very long time.&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah at least 2 weeks OP but it&#039;s best to leave it for 3-4. If you don&#039;t and keep banging Mandy more regularly than this you will lose the magic. I did that and had to leave Mand for a few years but it&#039;s better now however it still isn&#039;t quite what it was.

				Agree with everyone here, 2 weeks is fine. I have however seen others recommend 4 to even 6 weeks at the most. I&#039;m no doctor but that seems overcautious.

				I tell people that it is how well you know your own body. Some people can do two weeks because everyday they work out, take vitamins and makes sure their body is in top health. Most people I find don&#039;t do that do I tell them three weeks. <br /><br />A good trick that I use to see how good my roll is going to be is to masturbate. It sounds childish but I&#039;ve notice that my peak from sexual activities does not seem as high when I roll, but if I take three to six weeks off of it then I get more out of it. You also have to keep in mind that I only smoke weed every couple of weeks so no other drugs are in my body.
