				Hello, since I was 8 years old I felt that I should have been born female. I already tried prescription antidepressants, I have tried many and none helped with these feelings. Are there any drugs on SR that can make them go away, or make me not care about them? I am looking for something that can be taken every day/multiple times a day (to be &quot;high&quot; on the drug all the time) without issues with tolerance or dependence.<br />Thanks in advance.

				The answer you seek is in psychedelics.The ones i whole heartily recommend are ayahuasca,and mescaline via san pedro or peruvian torch.<br />Ayahusca can be bought on the clearnet same as the cactus.Those two great psychedelic teachers will take care of you,and teach you all about yourself.<br />They are great helpers,also can be great spirit friends :).

				I already tried weed, it was boring. I will definitely try cactus, I remember saw it on amazon.<br />Also, is there any drug that would produce the same outcome as:<br />10x 100mg secobarbital<br />That is available on either SR or clearnet?

				Are you on SSRI&#039;s or too much benzos/other drugs? Take a break from the other shit and try again. Mushrooms could help too.<br /><br />If not then I&#039;m out of ideas, sorry. You could look into meditation/kundalini yoga.<br /><br />A single use of MDMA really helped me accept myself for who I am despite my flaws. Maybe that&#039;ll help you. Just don&#039;t do it too often or you&#039;ll end up depressed.

				I was taking the following drugs:<br />cyproterone acetate<br />estradiol valerate<br />propranolol<br />diazepam<br />citalopram<br />Don&#039;t know if any of these interfere with acid.<br /><br />I will definitely try MDMA though. I hope the comedown will not be too bad.

				*hugs* As somebody who has been/is going through the same exact thing, you really should confront these things head on. Drugs are great but not an alternative to therapy and finding out who you really are. However, if you ever need to leave your headspace for a little bit I suggest pot or acid, something nice and mellowing. But don&#039;t give up, you can be happy! <br /><br />And be careful with MDMA. It&#039;s fun, but there&#039;s a reason suicide Tuesdays are a thing.

				I took a long break from recreational use of drugs, I have always been a fan of psychedelics &amp; uppers. I realized how unhappy I was about a year and a 1/2 ago and felt like everything was boreing and just felt out of place. Decided to take some mushrooms had a fantastic trip and really put things into perspective for me. I think psychedelics are something that can really allow you to find yourself.<br /><br />If you want something for daily use get some xanax, honestly it isn&#039;t that hard to get it prescribed to you if you don&#039;t mind a few dr&#039;s visits.

				Why are people suggesting powerful psychedelics?<br /><br />The whole point of safely tripping is being in a secure mental state whilst doing it. Otherwise negative feelings will manifest. This can be healing to some extent but at the same time it&#039;s not for everyone.<br /><br />If you do decide to go down the psychedelic route, I would suggest going to Peru and do the proper ayahuasca in which you are guided through your past and emotions etc.<br /><br />The only drug which will make you not care is H or other strong opiates. I&#039;d seriously advise against them though, espescially if your depressed and having identity issues etc. you&#039;re at great risk of becoming heavily addicted. Also no drug will be a substitute for therapy. They only deal with the problem in the short term, they are not a cure. <br /><br />I hope it all works out.

				Sorry to be a buzzkill but no drug will be a cure for this; this is something you need to come to terms with in your own time. <br /><br />Perhaps taking MDMA will help you address any insecurities but only if you were to take it with the soul intention of coming to grips with it. It will soften any anxieties and help you open up to anything that you&#039;re uncomfortable about dealing with, in a very honest way. <br />Otherwise CBT is a better option for you, gender reassignment as a last line treatment.<br /><br />Psychedelics with MDMA could possibly help; but conversely they could make things far worse. If you&#039;re expecting an epiphany you should keep in mind these dont often happen. Drugs dont insert thoughts into your mind, they just bias your mind to thinking differently.<br />These drugs may be a tool, but of course what use is owning a tool if you cannot use it?<br /><br /><br />Why do you feel fake? What is &quot;real&quot; in this context? What&#039;s even wrong with feeling like a woman? These questions are going to do more for your mental health than a drug will if they are addressed.<br />&nbsp;<br />Im not going to deny MDMA with/without a light psychedelic like 2C-B may make you address these questions easier by putting you in a more comfortable state of mind, from personal experience i have found drugs in this manner take too much credit for the beautiful sober changes we really make ourselves under their conflated influence.

				save your money and move to san francisco.&nbsp; there&#039;s a whole sub culture of people there who will love you for who you are.&nbsp; if your family thinks you&#039;re wrong for having these feelings then they don&#039;t deserve to have you in their lives.<br /><br />being high all day on any drug will not solve this problem for you.&nbsp; ecstasy &amp; psychedelics could help you come to terms with it, but really it is up to YOU to reverse your cycle of depression.<br /><br />i can&#039;t imagine how difficult this must be for you, but be strong and confident.&nbsp; you are just as you should be.<br /><br />good luck!
