				So title say&#039;s it.<br /><br />Most people seem content on here with a &#039;0.001g&#039; $100 jeweler&#039;s scale and if that&#039;s how they wish to weigh their mg magnitude compounds I have no interest in stopping them.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a REAL (aka scientific) analytical balance though and scientific quantitative balances are at the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM $500, but I would never pay that, for that cheap it would likely be an unreliable balance.<br /><br />Basic (yet accurate) balances run about $800 without all the bells and whistles.<br /><br />Does anyone have any input on preferred brands and model&#039;s of quality (but priced appropriately) scientific analytical balances?

				If you are looking beyond the $1000-ish &quot;consumer&quot; quality there is not that much difference anymore.<br /><br />At the high end of the market manufacturers will provide datrasheets on what accuracy to expect at certain weights, and those specs are always met or exceeded.<br /><br />&nbsp;I used to work with Perkin-Elmer gear in the lab, using equipment that can measure accurately down to the microgram (not milligram!). Such balances do cost tens of thousands of dollars each though. I&#039;m not sure what level of gear you are considering, but if you need anything that measures in steps of 0.1 milligram or smaller to be very expensive.

				not a direct answer to your question, but as a matter of technique that I&#039;ve found useful.<br /><br />I don&#039;t tare the balance.&nbsp; I think this adds alot of rounding error.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of those cheapie jeweler balances.&nbsp; The max weight capacity is 10g.&nbsp; I use vessels that are between 5g and 10g.&nbsp; I find that contact lens cases are perfect.&nbsp; They usually weigh about 7g and have two sides to store different things.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a very inconspicuous object.<br /><br />I measure the weight of the container with your product.&nbsp; Weigh an empty container that you will place your dose into.&nbsp; Remove your dose from the main stash.&nbsp; Place in empty vessel.&nbsp; Reweigh both containers. Subtract the weight of the main vessel from the post dose removal main vessel.&nbsp; Subtract the weight of the vessel with dose from the weight of the empty vessel.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re careful, those numbers will be within 1 or 2 mg of each other.&nbsp; I usually do all weight measurements twice or thrice.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been surprised that the numbers were the same many times.<br /><br />If the measurements are not close, I start over.&nbsp; Anything can alter the weight measurement so I make sure they are in the same configuration when I measure (same direction and placement).&nbsp; The air conditioning is not blowing.&nbsp; And I place some shielding around three sides of the scale to prevent breezes.<br />&nbsp; <br />For doses around 20 to 30mg, I have some confidence that it will be within a couple mg of what you want.&nbsp; Now, these little scales are not very accurate, but they might be precise.&nbsp; Meaning the measurements I get are repeatable.&nbsp; The scale came with a 5g and 10g calibration weight.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve used this technique to measure molly doses around 100mg and bumps around 50mg.&nbsp; <br /><br />Try it, tell me what you all think.<br /><br />thanks, G

				that being said, Sartorius and Mettler make excellent analytical scales.&nbsp; You can get a used one for around $600 on ebay.&nbsp; But then, if you go that route, you should have a special table for the scale.&nbsp; Usually very heavy and stable to compliment the accuracy of the scale.&nbsp; And then you should have a special room to put it so it will not be moved, temperature controlled, sound proof, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seems like a little overkill to measure out exactly 50mg.&nbsp; Unless you&#039;re doing a research study.&nbsp; And then other factors are really critical, time of day, meals ingested, mental state, setting, etc, etc.<br /><br />I ran into that problem with the jeweler&#039;s scale of starting off at 0mg, using a light-weight weighing vessel or paper, and trying to weigh 50mg.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be off +/- 50mg.&nbsp; It&#039;ll say 0mg or 100 mg.&nbsp; But if you start heavy and DON&#039;T tare, measure the contact lens case weighing about 7g.&nbsp; Then you add 50mg.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be close.&nbsp; It might say 7.052g.&nbsp; And then when you weigh your stash, it&#039;ll start at 7.191 and go to 7.140g after you remove 50mg.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this several times now and they&#039;ve always been within 2mgs +/- of each other.&nbsp; The differences of the two vessel weighings that is.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s totally accurate.&nbsp; <br /><br />If it isn&#039;t a big deal to you if it&#039;s 52mg instead of 50mg, I think the jeweler&#039;s scale is fine.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve got money to burn, get the analytical scale.&nbsp; I&#039;m a nerd so I&#039;d love to get the scale, but it&#039;s probably not practical for me.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />G

We&#039;d put the weigh boat on the scale, TARE THAT, add compound close balance shield and weigh.&nbsp; For particularly sensitively necessary weight&#039;s we&#039;d work through the premise of subtraction (which I .... think is what you are trying to explain).&nbsp; You open the shield, remove a tiny bit and put it .. somewhere lol and calculate the difference btwn the original measurement (higher #) and the difference in the newly displayed weight (lower #), is the amount removed and the amount contained in the ... somewhere you put it.<br /><br />The most annoying thing&#039;s about analytical chemistry is that you&#039;ll sometimes spend quite some time opening the shield again, adding some of the removed compound, calculate the new mass of the compound you put in ... something (take the difference in mass when you added to the balance and that&#039;s how much more you&#039;ve taken from the ... something container).&nbsp; There&#039;s times you have to leave and go do something else for 10 minutes cuz your fucking frustrated (which doesn&#039;t mix well with high ACCURACY measurement), only to come back and get the proper mass on the first try lol.<br /><br />I have less interest in PRECISION, it only show&#039;s that the balance is consistently weighing the same mass of the container.&nbsp; It&#039;s more about ACCURACY because you want the right mass of compound, but you can&#039;t be accurate if your balance isn&#039;t precise either.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice/input goldfibre1

The 10% error may sound horrible for research purposes, but could be good enough to measure amounts of substances that needn&#039;t be -that- accurate.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not looking for a scale that&#039;s really really cheap, the title of my thread even says that lol.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking at this point for a high end jeweler&#039;s scale (vs. an analytical balance).&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for the BEST jeweler&#039;s scale that is out there.<br /><br />Thank you for explaining to me how to calibrate a balance lol (wtf?)

				I&#039;m not sure what the difference between an jewelers scale and an analytical balance should be. <br /><br />If you know the weight range you will need to be measuring and the accuracy you require, you can select a model from any major supplier that exceeds those requirements. Many vendors of lab equipment have these available, and it really doesn&#039;t matter that much if you get perkin-elmer, fisher, ohaus, mettlab or other A brand product. <br /><br />Perhaps the idea of veryfing a balance using a coin sounds stupid, but it actually has merit. If i want to see if a balance is not defective, i throw on a 1 euro coin, and expect a result that is in the order of 7.5 grams. Obviously a circulated coin is not a reference weight accurate to 7500 milligrams at all, but if the balance shows a result under 7.4 or over 7.6 grams for that coin, it is a good reason to no trust it any longer.

				the smallest chem i&#039;ll be dosing is 2cb in the 30mg range at it&#039;s lowest. Also 30mg doses for DMT at its lowest. I can be + or - 5mg on the accuracy without problems. I&#039;d like to keep the maximum the scale can be off to 5mg in either direction if possible. Can any jewelers scale be accurate within 5mg over or under?

				Any decent milligram-resolution scale will be able to measure 30 mg with less then 5 mg error. Even very cheap scales will easily be that accurate as long as they are not defective.<br /><br />I tested the very cheap 1 mg resolution, 20 gram capacity scale as sold on dealextreme against other scales with reference weights. It actually is remarkably accurate for its price. Measurements over the entire range have never been off by more then 1 percent, and most of then are within 0.2% except on the very low end of the range. <br /><br />The downside of these cheap scales is that you need to keep an eye on them constantly, verifying with a reference weight every single time you use them. A proper analytical balance will not need such scrutiny since it has a built in system that diagnoses large (say, &gt;1%) errors every time you power it up. Considering the dx one costs $30 or so, where the proper balances costs several thousands, i would not advise against using the cheap ones as long as you frequently re-assert their accuracy. <br /><br />Once these things go off they tend to go way off though, indicating double or even tenfold the weight actually on them, so you&#039;re probably notice fairly quickly.
