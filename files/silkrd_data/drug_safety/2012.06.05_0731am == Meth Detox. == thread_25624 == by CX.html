				So I got myself a gram and have been getting into it every second weekend, rarely more frequent. Probably doing about 100mg over the course of Friday-Saturday.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been really enjoying my time spent with it. I usually go out to parties or the pub with friends although I keep my drinking to a minimum I come home late in the AM and produce music, write and draw, usually repeating again on Saturday.<br /><br />This will be my first and last purchase of this chemical. In part due to exorbitant prices in AU $600-$1000 a gram... and self preservation. <br /><br />Now that my supply is coming to an end I&#039;ve been doing research into detoxing from Methamphetamine.<br /><br /><br />This is what I have found.<br /><br />- ( On a side not I also take multi-vitamins daily, regardless. Usually go jogging in the evening when the air is cool and sun is setting. I also force myself to eat lots of fruits and vegetables,&nbsp; &nbsp; although I actually enjoy my greens more so than when I&#039;m sober and enjoy stuffing my face&nbsp; ???. I take .5mg xanax periodically when I feel the comedown or tweak setting in. I also try to sleep it off as best I can and not put myself in stressful or anxiety inducing situations and have never had a comedown even remotely close to some of those horror stories you read about )<br /><br />Anyway - I will be beginning this regime daily, starting tomorrow.<br /><br />&quot;The Hubbard Sauna Detoxification Regimen&quot;<br /><br />Hubbard Detoxification Protocol<br /><br />The precise sauna-based protocol designed by Mr. Hubbard has been documented for mobilizing fat-stored toxins and enhancing their elimination while restoring the body’s metabolic balance. This regimen, which had previously been shown to be safe, is known to improve memory, cognitive function, immune parameters, and general physical condition. Other benefits previously attributed to saunas include stress reduction, improved circulation, lowered blood pressure, and muscle relaxation.<br /><br />The detoxification protocol is standardized and includes the following:<br /><br />Daily regimen of physical exercise, immediately followed by forced sweating in a sauna at 140-180 degrees F for 2.5 hours with short breaks for hydration to offset the loss of body fluids and cooling.<br /><br />Nutritional supplements centered on on increasing doses of crystalline niacin (nicotinic acid) to promote lipid mobilization and stimulate circulation.<br /><br />Administration of additional vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and essential oils, including vitamins A, D , C, E, B complex, B;, multi-minerals including calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, and iodine; sodium and potassium; and a blend of polyunsaturated oils, including soy, walnut, peanut, and safflower.<br /><br />More information can be found VIA Google.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a good article to get your started for any interested.<br /><br />( http://suite101.com/article/hubbard-sauna-detoxification-regimen-a161318 )<br /><br /><br />Live a long, healthy,&nbsp; prosperous life my friends.<br /><br />Peace and love. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

You aren&#039;t serious about that &quot;Hubbard De-tox Program&quot; are you?? Really??&nbsp; <br /><br />As you may already know...it&#039;s never a good idea to mix Meth and the subject of mind control cults and conspiracy theories. This is a big wind up with speed freaks mate. I really hope he isn&#039;t a source of inspiration for you.... I have a PhD in philosophy/religious studies and have studied cults and mind control programs extensively. I mean you no disrespect whatsoever but there is no easy way to sugar coat a nasty ass truth.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Unfortunately, L. Ron didn&#039;t heed his own advice. When he died&nbsp; he was seen in a stinky,disheveled,neglected condition with long yellowed finger and toe nails (just like the reclusive millionaire Howard Hughes). He also had injection marks on his ass. A post autopsy revealed the anti anxiety Vistoril in his system. He was a chain smoker who actually encouraged Church members to smoke cigarettes b/c they would &quot;prepare our physical bodies for the upcoming nuclear war&quot;. He actually believed that shit.&nbsp; &nbsp; :o<br /><br />In several interviews he did in the 1980&#039;s his own son,Ron Hubbard Jr. (now Ron De Wolf) described his dad as a total drug fiend.When asked what drugs he took he said &quot;Cocaine,Peyote,amphetamines,barbituates. It would be shorter to list what he didn&#039;t take.&quot; As a child he said his father would mix Pheno-Barbital with his bubblegum. He described his and his father&#039;s personal involvement with large drug syndicates in South America. (see: Ron Hubbard Jr. Penthouse interview 1983. Rick Ross.com)<br /><br />Detoxing from drugs is common sense: saunas,exercise,nutrition,rest,avoiding triggers, etc.. you don&#039;t need an E-Meter for any of this stuff. No need&nbsp; to sign a billion year contract.<br /><br />If you are going to detox make sure you get all that Scientology out of your system as well:&nbsp; that shit will eat all independent thought. No sense in replacing one toxin (Meth) with another (Scientology). Ditch &#039;Dianetics&#039; and read Nietzsche&#039;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;,William Burroughs, or Phillip K. Dick.<br /><br />&nbsp; Anyways, anyone curious should check out the Youtube video &#039;L.Ron Hubbard and drugs&#039; while they still can<br />(translation: before the CO$ takes it down). Also check out the &#039;Operation Clam Bake&#039; web-site exposing CO$.<br /><br />Again: I mean you no disrespect and sincerely wish you all the best in getting off of Meth. I am a little concerned for you.... but if Scientology works for you then good on you. As a Meth addict I know a kicking it is a real bitch. Good luck man.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />
