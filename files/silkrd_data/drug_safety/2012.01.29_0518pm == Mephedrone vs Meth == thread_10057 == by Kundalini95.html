				Before the Mephedrone ban I had tons of the stuff.Just loved it.What I liked most was the horniness.<br />Since I tried Mephedrone I also wanted to trie Meth since it is rumored to be THE sex drug however it just now(since I found SR) that I can get my hands some.<br /><br />So could somebody (if possibly someone who has tried both)tell me are there any differences in horniness and in relation to lowering sexual inhibitions?<br /><br />Some say that meth is just like amph but much stronger,however the one time I had normal Amph I didn&#039;t like it all in comparision to meph,no horniness at all and no color intensification.<br /><br />K

				Never done meth, but supposedly you can&#039;t get an erection when you&#039;re on it. Maybe look into &quot;foxy&quot;, though I can&#039;t remember the chemical name for it. Foxymeow sells it

				There also many people who don&#039;t get it up one mephedrone.I often did high doses on it but I never had a problem getting it up,I even had drastic libido increase!<br /><br />From what I have read it is the same with meth some get it up and some just don&#039;t.<br /><br />Foxy is surely good if you are mainly looking for touch intesification,it lacks in horniness.Would surely be a good supplemeent that give horniness.

				Not talking from experience, but I don&#039;t think you will get the same eroticism from meth like you did from meph. I say this by of comparing MDMA to meth, the meth was not as inductive to eroticism as MDMA even. <br /><br />Look into some Moxy [5-Meo-Mipt]. Its a Tryptamine which is often compared to MDMA, and at least 1 report on Erowid put it as: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">by far the best fuck drug I’ve ever experienced&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here&#039;s another Moxy:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Since the term roll has come to mean so many things other than MDMA, I like think of this substance as a tryptamine roll. But after I’d managed to cure my burning sex drive, the drug took a completely different direction</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Notice the recurring theme of fucking and sex-drive.

				Apparently 5-meo mipt and mephedrone seems like an incredible combo for sex.I may trie this.<br /><br />As far as I know and comfirmed partially by my experiences is that serotonin releaser rather give you the erotic push while dopamin releasers give you honiness(Correct me if I am wrong). Mephedrone releases Serotonin and Dopamine at a good amount,meth only releases Dopamin.<br /><br /><br />

				There is a fair amount of misinformation in this thread, which I can understand as 99.9% of mainstream information on the drug is 100% false. <br /><br />Methamphetamine releases dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin(though not as much), and also indirectly prevents their reuptake. Your are correct about serotonin, in that it is responsible for the empathogenic effects characteristic of drugs that are potent serotonin releasers such as MDMA.<br /><br />&nbsp;As an avid fan of methamphetamine (but not what you&#039;d call a &#039;tweaker&#039; by any means) with friends who are also avid fans, I can tell you that I have never met anyone that has been unable to get an erection while on meth. In fact this is the first time I&#039;ve heard that, however I did know a couple people who couldn&#039;t get it up when trying adderall (recreational) for the first time. I&#039;d guess its all on the mood of the user during the high, if you get all anxious and feel unpleasant than of course its not going up.<br /><br /><br />To the OP: Yes in a way meth is very similar to amph. In fact dextro-amphetamine is actually mg/mg more potent than methamphetamine.<br /><br />&nbsp;In my personal experience comparing the two, oral meth is more focused, less twitchy and has less side effects during comedown, though dex-amp gives more physical energy, and meth gives more mental energy (motivation/go get em attitude). I spent a good amount of time trying to find my perfect work stim and figured it&#039;d be dex-amp, but I found that without that extra motivation, I&#039;d end up not physically using the extra energy and would then not feel like working (hard to get into it), whereas on meth I&#039;d just dive right in and go at it without even thinking twice, while having a blast doing it! So that and with the longer duration, meth (ingested orally) is my stim of choice for work. On occasion I will throw in a small dose of d-amp for an extra hard night (I work night shift)<br /><br />As far as the ultimate sex drug thing, its not what your thinking. I think that term came from the fact that you can go a lot longer and many times in a relatively short time, it is not empathogenic, its about desire, intensity, duration, stamina, motivation all while euphoric as fuck.<br /><br />It does get me horny easily when sniffed/swallowed, and to me it makes sex loads better, but you can&#039;t go by someone with a habit if you are trying it the first time. It depends on dose but if you do a lot you may find your not even interested in having sex. One thing for sure is when/if you nut you&#039;ll get a whole body tingling sensation that is focused in your head and is very awesome!<br /><br />If your using it for the first time with the intention of increasing sexual performance than I must stress that you either swallow or snort your meth, do not attempt to smoke or inject it in this situation. Smoking and IV use hits you all at once, there is no slow warm &quot; I think I feel fucking awesome&quot; come up period, its just there hitting you square in the face, and if you manage to do it properly then one good hit can easily overcome someone that is amphetamine-naive.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve spent way too much time on this, though it probably looks like something I threw together in a couple minutes, not the case this time.<br /><br />Feel free to ask any questions if you have them, I&#039;ll try to help as best I can.<br /><br />Be safe and have fun! Hope its everything your expecting and more :^)

				From how you describe sex on meth that sounds exactly like mephedrone :) but mephedrone has this increase in sensual pleasure that you also get from mdma&nbsp; which makes it so special.<br /><br />Honestly I would love if somebody who has tried meth and mephedrone could chime in on this thread.<br /><br /><br />

				Just did some quick research on mephedrone. Looks like methamphetamine has a much higher affinity for the dopamine transporter (releases more dopamine) than mephedrone, however mephedrone releases much more serotonin that meth, though mephedrone still favors dopamine to serotonin release. But anyway that extra kick of serotonin is what causes the increased sensuality you where describing. Increases in serotonin releasing potential also seem to mean an increase in neurotoxicity, which may mean (i&#039;m not positive on this) that meth is less neurotoxic and therefore a safer choice between the two.<br /><br />With much less serotonin being released, I&#039;d say meth will not give you that same sensuality as the mildly empathogenic mephedrone.<br /><br /><br />But the science doesn&#039;t always match the feeling, so as you said, you&#039;d benefit more from someone that has experience with both.

				This is super late but...<br /><br />Having tried both, mephedrone is definitely WAY more sensual than meth. However, meth still has a very strong potential for inducing crazy freaky sex ;)<br /><br />Mephedrone has much less issues regarding erections than meth also in my experience.

				Mephedrone makes me more horny but neither make me want to have sex and can make cuming tricky. At high doses it can make finding my own cock hard (think of it as a VERY cold day).

				sex on meth is indeed absofuckinglutely incredible.&nbsp; <br /><br />the down side is, you&#039;ll probably get hooked on meth.<br /><br />the impotence doesn&#039;t show up until around 4-6 months of heavy use.<br /><br />its a pretty good time, but not worth the mental and physical costs.&nbsp; i&#039;d say let sleeping dogs lie
