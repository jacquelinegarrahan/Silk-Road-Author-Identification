				Morning all,<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to gain a bit more insight into taking 2c-B and LSD while currently on a course of Lithium Carbonate for Bipolar Disorder.<br /><br />During July this year I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and have recently started taking Lithium Carbonate, although I&#039;ve been somewhat aware of having this Disorder since early 2009. My drug use began in the late 90s, smoking various hash and mainly soap bar, in my early teens. I then got involved with the free party culture at 18, although previous had used cocaine and mdma, I started to experiment more and used ketamine, LSD, 2c-B/C/E/T-7, crack, nitrous etc.<br /><br />Now has come a time in my life where I feel like going to a free party in some abandoned warehouse, and spending the week thereafter at a squat exploring my mind.<br /><br />I want to keep up with my lithium treatment as it would be a great benefit for me to gain a stable mood and improve my life.<br /><br />Will I encounter any serious problems when taking LSD, 2C-B, Ketamine, Cocaine and perhaps some DMT?<br /><br />I&#039;m far from a noob with regard to exploring ones mind with the use of chemicals, but very much a noob to taking prescription drugs on a regular basis, namely Lithium Carbonate.<br /><br />Currently I&#039;m on 500mg daily.<br /><br />Many thanks in advance :)

				From my research I believe Lithium to be classed as a mood stabilizer and not like an SSRI in any way, I&#039;ve yet to find really any negative reports but would like first hand experience if possible :)

				How&#039;s the lithium working for you?<br /><br />As you likely know there are several popular bipolar meds.&nbsp; Lithium, Depakote and lamotrigine come to mind.&nbsp; Focus on finding the one that works best for you if you haven&#039;t already.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to lecture you on not taking drugs.&nbsp; Just be careful.&nbsp; Have a benzo available to abort a bad trip.&nbsp; Don&#039;t stay awake for too many hours.&nbsp; Good luck!
