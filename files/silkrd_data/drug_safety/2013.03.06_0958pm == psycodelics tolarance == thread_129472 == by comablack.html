				er.<br /><br />most frequent i would recommend is once every two weeks.<br /><br />It may take longer for your tolerance to return to baseline though.<br /><br />better to take MORE in one sitting rather than less in several sittings

				its written with a he and not a o :&nbsp; psychedelics . <br />maybe the hits are bunk? are you on any medication? one week should be enough. its enough for me. but of course more is recommended.<br />What is missing? is it&nbsp; weaker or you lost the psychedelic feeling altogether?&nbsp; What about the mindfuck or the stimulation?<br />4 mg of DOx sounds&nbsp; a lot.&nbsp; Did you stay up for a long time after that? How long did it last? Same batch as before? <br />Do you take benzos? <br /><br />Some people have a natural high tolerance to psychedelics.&nbsp; Did you have this before or this is something you have developed? <br />Maybe you should stop using for longer periods. Take a year break?<br /><br />

				Like Valakki asked, are you taking any prescription medication(s)? This can interfere with the effects of some/most psychedelics. Also, since you&#039;re taking them very frequently, you&#039;ve likely built up a tolerance, causing a shorter duration and diminished effects. It would be best to abstain from taking anything (other than prescription medications) for at least a month or more. <br /><br />best of luck,<br />sdesu
