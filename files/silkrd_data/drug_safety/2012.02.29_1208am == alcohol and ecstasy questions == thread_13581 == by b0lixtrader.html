				I&#039;m gonna be celebrating my friends birthday in a few weeks so I picked up some rolls. Now I&#039;m a total light weight when it comes to alcohol...2-3cans of beer will get me tipsy.<br /><br />Will drinking couple of beers kill my roll? Should i drink when I&#039;m crashing instead? Or will a few beers enhance my roll?<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks

				I&#039;m a alcohol lightweight too and i find when beer starts taking its toll a pill will liven me up and take over from the alcohol, but can make feel very nauseous, especially when drinking carbonated beer/lager and bouncing up and down in a rave.<br /><br />I personally think alcohol takes a little bit of the shine off ecstasy, but thats just me.

				alcohol will also dehydrate you, which is something you generally want to avoid while on ecstasy

				don&#039;t mix alcohol with any psychoactive drug. Period.<br />The exception maybe being coke. But still. Avoid alcohol. It&#039;s a lousy non-selective brain depressant.<br />(easy for me to say, i NEVER consume alcohol. Some years ago I had a discussion about smoking weed with my parents, their advice was that I should &quot;learn to drink&quot; alcohol lol)

				alcohol is going to deaden the trip! A complete waste in my opinion, you probably won&#039;t even want to eat or drink while you&#039;re rolling.<br />Wait an hour after you have 1 drink before taking E, or start to drink once you have come down off the x<br /><br />X doesn&#039;t last terribly long, so depending on when/how much you take you should have plenty of time to drink<br />Which I would suggest avoiding anyway, because the X is going to dehydrate you (make sure everyone is drinking water)

				Alcohol is a terrible drug in general.<br /><br />It&#039;s worse when mixed with MDMA.<br /><br />MDMA is a beautiful substance... Don&#039;t ruin it with alcohol. :)

				Sounds like a plan. Just keep in mind, for many people the day after a roll can feel a wee bit &quot;depressed&quot; or &quot;downed&quot;. Alcohol in itself is a depressant with a tendency to make you feel really bum after an initial very brief excited state. When I started out I used to drink heavily while coming down trying to get to sleep. Totally stupid. You just get way more depressed than you normally would...

				I&#039;ve never really had a problem with alcohol and MDMA. Albeit my tolerance to alcohol is HUUUGE. I can drink over a fifth of 80 proof to myself in a couple hours.&nbsp; Just make sure you stay hydrated and responsible about knowing how you&#039;re feeling and you should be okay with a beer or two.<br /><br />Fuck my college alcohol tolerance...

				Thanks djaze. I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t get affected due to your tolerance. I think I will have a couple of beers after I come down.

				i have mixed alcohol, mdma, speed, coke, 5+ pills and weed in nights out and been fine (the day after wasnt great obviously) and this was in a boiler room club. its all about making sure you can chill out and drink water or soft drinks a bit amongst it and splashing some water on your face to cool down.

				MDMA is a lovely drug and an all together beautiful experience. If I&#039;m taking a white speaker, etc. I want to make sure I am enjoying it to the max while staying properly hydrated and personally I think mixing alcohol with MDMA ruins it. That being said I have indeed done it- hell I took one about 3 months ago and went out to a bar with a few friends and drank good cold Newcastle on tap which tasted that much better. <br /><br />But taking it as is with a partner, some good music or a good show on television and staying plenty hydrated is enough for me. Connecting makes the trip that much better.

				Just be careful taking Ecstasy and Alcohol---Alcohol dehydrates you (that&#039;s why if you drink a couple of 32oz glasses of water before bed time, you&#039;ll not get a hangover). <br /><br />MDMA does the same----so if you&#039;re gonna mix the two---make sure to drink PLENTY of water.....be careful my man....we need you on the boards....;-)
