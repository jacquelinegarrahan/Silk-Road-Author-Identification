				Hello everyone; I&#039;m new to the forums and new to psychoactive drugs in general.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of trying LSD for the first time and as such I have some questions and concerns. My biggest concern regards safety and self control. Since LSD trips are so profound and long lasting, I&#039;m worried about how I&#039;ll be affected by its influence. Are the hallucinations it inspires so powerful that I won&#039;t be able to tell what I&#039;m actually doing? Could I potentially harm myself by doing something foolish? Will people be able to tell that I&#039;m tripping specifically on LSD as opposed to, say, pot, based solely on my outward behavior?<br /><br />One way to mitigate a lot of these problems would be to find a sitter to supervise me, but I don&#039;t really know anyone well enough who would want to do that for me. It seems like a lot to ask of someone when I&#039;ve read that LSD trips can last upwards of 12 hours. Are there parts of the forums here where people arrange for that sort of thing?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any advice,<br /><br />S.

				ques 1/2: yes, if your that spun you could hurt yourself<br />ques 3: no unless you act like a crazy person<br />lsd doesnt last 12 hours, usually around 7-8 in my experiences, the visuals wear off around 6-7 hour mark <br />ques4: if you dont know anyone open minded/experienced, consider going to burning man next year, boom festival in portugal or to south america and visit a shaman <br /><br />if your unsure, do more reading and research, the worst thing you could do is be unprepared. depending on your source, 1/2 hit could be a lot or you might need 1-2 hits to get you off. do some more reading and research, it can be a very rewarding and profound experience.<br /><br />take care...

				If you decide not to get a sitter, keep your dose low.&nbsp; i.e 1/2 -1&nbsp; an average strength blotter.<br /><br />If you are mentally stable and have no family history of mental illness I doubt you will have problems whatsoever.<br /><br />My first trip was quite a bad one,&nbsp; but I still had 50+ more over the years...<br /><br />If you are really concerned, get some diazepam (valium)&nbsp; and have a small dose if you are feeling overwhelmed.<br /><br />The fact that you are even thinking about HR shows that you are on the right path.

				From my research LSD, when compared to shrooms, is that LSD is more visual than shrooms, though both cause hallucinations, with shrooms being more physical and a more intense overall trip (physically and mentally). However, the afterglow of LSD last 3 days, meaning some people had a weird feeling inside their heads for 3 days or so after ingesting LSD. So be prepared.<br /><br />My advice is, always start from small dose. If it&#039;s your first time, consider taking half a blot, then 1-3 hours later if you feel it&#039;s not sufficient, consume the remaining half blot. ;-)

				don&#039;t worry , dose big, be around friends, and just let it overcome you. worrying about the &quot;bad effects&quot; is what causes &quot;bad effects&quot;. LSD is a beautiful drug! But tripping is less about the drug and more about the setting. be in a place where you feel comfortable, and everything will be great. Ignore those who say to dose small! you only get ONE first time, so make it count. Anything worth doing is worth doing big! Have fun, and welcome to club LSD!

Ideally it would be someone with experience that&#039;s not going to freak out a lot if you freak out a little. Set and setting are very important as well for first timers. Find someplace cozy that you can retreat to, with a bathroom close by if needed. My first LSD trip was intense, some 35 years ago, and the pile of big pillows and blankets and a comfy chair my friend had prepared earlier was like a little piece of heaven. The only problem was the walk to the bathroom - you had to pass the &#039;evil&#039; room. During the rest of the time it was a sewing room, but we all scrunched up against the wall opposite the door to it when heading for the toilet. That room was fucking malevolent, is what it was.

				take a small amount, with friends if you can, and be VERY patient.<br /><br />the absolute, most important thing to keep in mind is to not keep anything in mind. You should not have anything of major concern in your head when you eat it - be completely relaxed and ready for anything. Have no expectations and you will enjoy it.<br /><br />Concerning &quot;hallucinations&quot; - you will not see anything that isn&#039;t there (unless you take a whole lot); however, things may seem &quot;distorted&quot; and you&#039;ll notice patterns around you that you normally would not. Again, have the mindset to enjoy it no matter what and have no worries!<br /><br />The best advice I can give is to completely clear your head, and set aside 24 hrs - 12 to trip and 12 to sleep/recover. Put your wallet/keys/cell phone away, spend time outdoors, and make sure you have good music to listen to. In the possibility that your mind is not clear and you begin to not enjoy yourself, there are 2 and only 2 remedies: music and/or xanax

				Lots of great advice here. I wanted to add a few things:<br /><br />- Take early in the day. From experience, I&#039;ve dropped at 5PM for a show and stayed up for 12 hours. YMMV of course, but I&#039;ve found the best time for me to drop is in the morning, timed to come up around noon.<br /><br />- Your attitude going into the trip is important regarding how the trip will affect you. If you&#039;re a nervous wreck because you&#039;re afraid of having a bad trip, the trip probably won&#039;t be all that great. That being said, bad trips are very rare. Go into with confidence. Don&#039;t think about bad trips; hell, don&#039;t even think about the acid at all. Do something while you&#039;re waiting to come up, rather than sitting around wondering when it will take (aka my first experience with the drug).<br /><br />- RE: sitter. Find the right person. The best sitter, imo, is someone experienced with psychedelics who will trip with you. Obviously the sitter should take care not to take an irregular amount, because if the sitter has a bad trip then it&#039;s worse than no sitter. Sober people can get bored quickly when you&#039;re staring at the grass for hours on end, so if the sitter is sober you might want to find another person to keep him company. I don&#039;t know. I&#039;d say a good percentage of people do not need a sitter the entire duration of the trip: if you&#039;ve come up for an hour and are fine, chances are the trip is not going to turn unless something especially dramatic happens.<br /><br />- With all this talk about drama, it&#039;s good to note that you probably don&#039;t want anything illegal on you if you&#039;re going to be wandering around outside. If you cause a scene (but don&#039;t worry about these things) you don&#039;t want matters to be made worse. I&#039;m not really sure if acid sobriety can be measured, but it can definitely put a damper on your fun if your remaining tabs are confiscated (and worse).<br /><br />- Play it safe for your first time. Go to the park, walk around places you know, hang around with friends... Leave Burning Man for some seasoned hitters (or be prepared to have your mind blown seven ways to sunday)<br /><br />- A final addendum: meeting up with strangers on a drug dealing forum to take acid with seems like a rather bad idea, I think. Have a great trip!

				I took 4 hits off good liquid my first time. I was 15, a sophomore in high school, and I ate them on the bus coming back from school, knowing my folks would be gone until late. As I felt it coming on, I tried to suppress laughter, such laughter that it felt like I would burst. Finally I got off the bus and made it into my house, where I exploded in hysterics. I tried calling my buddy to try and explain, but was laughing too hard. Then he started screaming with laughter because I was. Eventually I choked out that I was on acid, and he got all excited and bought some within an hour (I was the guinea pig amongst all our friends back then).<br /><br />So the moral of the story is, I&#039;ve taken LSD maybe 50 times, a good number of them alone, incl my very first time as mentioned above. Nothing bad came of it. Likewise, the term &quot;bad trip&quot; doesn&#039;t even make sense to me. I&#039;ve had bad trips on mushrooms, but can&#039;t even imagine it being possible on LSD. Sure, everyone is different but go into it with the mindset that you&#039;re about to have the most fun you&#039;ve ever had in your life. Bad trips aren&#039;t possible, and if you believe that it will manifest that way.<br /><br />I also dislike being around other people not tripping. I don&#039;t mind it, it won&#039;t freak me out, but I&#039;d rather be alone than with a bunch of people who are straight, and can;t comprehend the majesty I am experiencing. Which brings me to the trip itself. I don&#039;t think of them like hallucinations. You might see some things that aren&#039;t there, but I always knew I was on a drug, and though there were some funny lapses of memory (like me holding a glass pipe, and for the life of me, not knowing what it was despite using it daily), I never got into dangerous situations. I have driven on it, but its surprisingly easy (DON&quot;T TRY IT. While I thought it was fun, it was admittedly very stupid and I could have killed myself or others). As long as you have a somewhat good head about you, you should be able to handle LSD just fine. <br /><br />Enjoy it, its fun as fuck. One of the best drug experiences there is.

				hey snarp, i would start with a low dose. you can always take more lsd, but you can&#039;t take less lsd. if you don&#039;t take enough all that will happen is you just feel really interested in life and your surroundings for a couple hours, where as if you take too much you could end up experiencing every negative emotion in your body every second for 8+ hrs. Also, i don&#039;t agree with the people who say you should be around a large group of friends. Being around a large group of not tripping people can be frightening when on lsd. i would pick one or two people that are really relaxed and chill people that never make situations tense and never cause any drama. it might be more fun to have them trip with you, but if this is not possible just have them come over and have some drinks and watch the tele and chat. also i would stay in a safe, secure place like your home or another location where there wont be a whole lot of people coming and going. Definitely don&#039;t leave your house as i&#039;ve had the worst trips of my life when i&#039;ve left a secure place and gone somewhere where there were a bunch of sketchy people coming and going and that really made the trip a bad experience. good luck
