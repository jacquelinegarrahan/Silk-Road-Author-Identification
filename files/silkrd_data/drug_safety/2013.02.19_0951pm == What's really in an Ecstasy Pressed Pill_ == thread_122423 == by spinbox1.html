				I think most experienced users know there&#039;s a difference in the way a pressed pill feels vs molly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been curious exactly what causes this.<br /><br />I definitely notice that pills seem speedier and I always grind more on a pill vs molly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried pills on the road like the green questionmarks from SuperTrips, the white monkeys from Emonkey, purple partyflocks, nintendos and more.&nbsp; With all of them I notice the speedier effects.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure these are clean pills.&nbsp; I used to think all pills were cut.&nbsp; But some of these pills are coming from the Netherlands and have been tested at labs, so I trust they are clean MDMA only.<br /><br />I&#039;ve capped up the exact same dose in molly form and it&#039;s always smoother for me.&nbsp; So what causes the difference in effects?&nbsp; Is it the binding agents? Or maybe the vendors are lying about what&#039;s really in a pill.&nbsp; I hope that&#039;s not the case though.

				Most of the difference in just in your head. <br /><br />A pressed pill with MDMA as the active ingredient is the same as any Molly roll for me. Pills can be cut with anything of course so what you might get is up to who you got it from I guess but there is nothing inherent to a pressed pill that will make it a different experience than simply taking the powdered Molly directly. I guess you could have an obscure allergy to benign binders but other than that pressed or powder MDMA is MDMA. <br /><br />Specifically the Nintendos you mentioned are tested to be just MDMA if you got the same press that they tested. My Nintendos that I&#039;ve taken feel as clean as powder and look just like the ones tested and I actually prefer them to powder just because I don&#039;t have to measure anything out.

				If the dosage is the same the only difference would be absorption rate between the 2 options. Molly gets absorbed faster, by how much I don&#039;t know. Personally, I&#039;ve made hand pressed pills from my own molly with a cheapo pill presser. The effects were pretty similar. A pressed pill is just a binding agent, color, and the crushed molly. When I did it 75% was inactive crap to make the pill shape/color.

				I know it&#039;s not in my head.&nbsp; There really is a different feeling to a pill and my friends all agree with me on that.<br /><br />I think you&#039;re right that the absorbtion rate could play part of this.&nbsp; After your stomach acid eats through the capsule then you get all the molly at once.&nbsp; It takes more time to digest a hard-pressed pill.&nbsp; Maybe the body processes this a little differently.<br /><br />Lately, I&#039;ve been doing MDMA from Ivory and LuckyLuciano.&nbsp; Their stuff is so pure, so that could be part of it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if the quality in the presses is as good.<br /><br />I should press some of my own pills and see if there&#039;s a difference.<br />

				I actually don&#039;t recommend it. The hand presses are annoying to use and you don&#039;t want it used against you in case you get searched. I threw mine away, my spice scale which is chemically devoid of illicit residue is easier to justify than a pill press.

				I agree with spinbox! I found pure molly alot smother then pills with much much less grinding.<br /><br />Then again I have a close friend so says the exact opposite so I guess it just down to personal preference.

				Mix some caffeine and speed with your mdma to get the speedy love feeling you&#039;re used too.

				I first thought you meant pills you get on the street(US). Those are just some random party drug(or lack of drug) pressed in a pill.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get speed or piperazine more often than not.<br /><br />I DO know what you&#039;re talking about though.&nbsp; ST&#039;s white speakers are SUPER DOPE.&nbsp; They seem significantly speedier to me than his MDMA which I&#039;ve had aswell. Even his red ?&#039;s aren&#039;t the same as his white ones in effect, dosage aside.&nbsp; It could honestly just be different batches.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty attuned to my body and I can feel VERY slight differences in effects, so...

				I also think pills feel different because they have to break down so it gradually builds up, therefore it lets you enjoy the phases, then when you hit the peak its pure bliss, euphoria, and total relaxation.&nbsp; &nbsp;With Molly I don&#039;t get that the same feeling, I start tingling at around the 30 minutes mark and 10 minutes later it hits me like a freight train.&nbsp; This makes me feel uncomfortable and I get more of a speedy high and its less enjoyable.&nbsp; &nbsp;All the MDMA are from all the top quality vendors with the same results.&nbsp; So I bought a known quality dutch press Mortal Kombat and that was a much more enjoyable experience for me.&nbsp; Anyone come up with a way to slow the absorption rate of mdma crystals?

				ANYTHING could be in a pill. Usually the shiny/sparkly little pieces you see in them are the MDMA and the rest is guess work unless you test them. I picked up 250 of Supertrips&#039; green question marks and ended up having one of them tested those had&nbsp; ~200 mg&#039;s MDMA and&nbsp; ~200 mg&#039;s Speed. The speed and MDMA mixture is a common one but anything could be mixed with the MDMA in a roll.

				Not to mention 200mg + 200mg would be a crazy massive pill and cutting it like that would make it so much more expensive to make than any pill on the market. Ahh, when you know how blatantly ignorant someone is.&nbsp; ;D

				Pressed pills often contain speed, caffeine, or meth because pure MDMA can often times leave you floored. MDMA being popular at raves, it&#039;d make more sense to add a stimulant so that users may dance all night and enjoy the rave scene as well. <br /><br />The pure molly you are buying here will most likely not contain active adulterants or add-ins.

				Hello all. I have order mdma from most all this top venders. Super trips to schitofreen to UGS. I MUST Say however each affect was different per vender. My most enjoyable experience was this..it was crystal&nbsp; mdma and it gave me visuals such as green leaves on a tree or a persons pink shirt. All looked like florescent light bulbs real bright and pretty.&nbsp; All sounds from ﻿the wind to ﻿the tree leaves shaking. Was crystal clear and intensified..no empathy though. Can anyone tell me which mdma pills out there have given them ﻿the affects I just mentioned.thank you
