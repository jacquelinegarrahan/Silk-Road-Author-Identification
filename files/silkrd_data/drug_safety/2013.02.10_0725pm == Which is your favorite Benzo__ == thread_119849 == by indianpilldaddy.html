				Well just to get this thread going with a useless post<br />I tried 2mg of clonazepam last night and had 5-6 drinks and i gotta say i was a little bored with it. All it really did is make me want to sit down more often and little sloppier when i walk. maybe i was a bit numb to social situations idk. but it could just be a simple solution of dosage as i have never used benzos b4<br />anyway free thread bump

				Diazepam.<br /><br />About 60mg or 70 mg to stay active and 100mg to 120 mg with a good weed-joint to become high.<br /><br />If possible from India,because of the price ceiling regulation law for generics.

				Well, diazepam if I want something more physical, alprazolam if I want to relax mentally. 30 mg diazepam is plenty for me, and I and a friend long ago decided together that 2.5 mg alprazolam is the perfect max. amount - 3.0 is just over the line &amp; we&#039;d always wind up sleeping after a couple of hours.

				mate I will tell you what you did wrong there, you should never mix alcohol and benzos. That is what most people do wrong! Not only is it not safe but it also fades away the benzo effect.

				Diazepam is great!! its actually even better if it bought from India. Here in India we sell roughly 40% diazepam out of all the meds we sell. So yeah they are always in a lot of demand. Even the British are falling in love with the indian valium. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119849.msg813487#msg813487">Quote from: wasta on February 11, 2013, 01:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Diazepam.<br /><br />About 60mg or 70 mg to stay active and 100mg to 120 mg with a good weed-joint to become high.<br /><br />If possible from India,because of the price ceiling regulation law for generics.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				well this thing is kind of hilarious and you are right about your facts in a lot of ways but there are some things here that I would like add. First of all these prices are for when we go over and by the meds with a genuine prescription which obviously I don&#039;t have. Even if I did I could never buy them in such quantities to sell them to my customers.<br />The pharmacy shops here in India&nbsp; by the way of monopoly of oligopoly(mutual agreements in business) never sell the cheapest brand, which is shalina laboratories in this case. Just so because it is the cheapest brand and they would profit less if they sell it the cheapest amount. That&#039;s common sense. They most widely and trustworthy brands available&nbsp; in India is Cipla whose brand name for diazepam is Zepose. Its 25/- Rs a blister pack retail price. 10 tablets in it.<br />But here is the thing here, us sellers never get it at 25 Rs a blister pack. We get it at maybe double or even more. Thats 50 Rs a blister pack. Then we have our bribes which I can&#039;t say are how much!! and other overhead costs. <br />We don&#039;t earn as much as you guys think we do mate. Its pretty risky here too, well its 10 years in prison we get caught plus a hefty fine - over 2,00,000 Rs. I think we deserve that much for taking such a risk. <br />And all online pharmacies are not scams. Most are I agree. But not all. You just need to know where to look, like SR. :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119849.msg815284#msg815284">Quote from: wasta on February 11, 2013, 04:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lucky you !<br /><br />If 30 tabs are sold for 6,50 Rs, that makes 300 tabs for 65,- Rs and that will be for 3000 tabs for 650,-Rs<br />To convert 650Rs in euro&#039;s will be how much?<br /><br />Name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price<br />1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizapam (10 mg) (30 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shalina Laboratories Ltd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 6.50<br />94%<br />2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizep (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intas Laboratories Pvt Ltd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 3.70<br />90%<br />3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diaz (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orchid Chemicals &amp; Pharmaceuticals Ltd. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 9.90<br />73%<br />4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzepam (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psyco Remedies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 10.00<br />73%<br />5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dipax (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reliance Formulation Pvt Ltd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 11.80<br />68%<br />6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizy Tab (10 mg) (500 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jpee Drugs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 625.00<br />66%<br />7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elpose (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elite Pharma Pvt Ltd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 15.00<br />59%<br />8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diazeco (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consern Pharma Pvt Ltd. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 20.00<br />46%<br />9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silprex (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taj Pharmaceuticals Ltd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 21.15<br />43%<br />10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxol (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maneesh Pharmaceuticals Ltd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 22.00<br />41%<br />11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placidox (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinnacle (Lupin Laboratories Ltd.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 22.00<br />41%<br />12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VGR Bio Laboratories &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 24.00<br />35%<br />13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zepose (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cipla Limited &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 25.00<br />32%<br />14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diaclam (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East West Pharma &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 36.75<br />1.00%<br />15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valium (10 mg) (10 Tablet) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbott Healthcare Pvt Ltd (AHPL) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rs 37.00<br /><br />http://icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2007/may/0506.pdf<br /><br />Fixed prices for generics (ceiling prices)<br />Factory price added by 15% for wholesale and 35% for retail<br /><br />Fig.Medicine prices in private sector for innovator brand (IB) most sold generic (MSG) and lowest price generic (LPG) at six survey<br />sites in India.<br /><br />(So in order to be able to sell at the free market, the company&#039;s have to sell cheap generics)<br /><br />http://www.drugsupdate.com/brand/showavailablebrands/799<br /><br />http://www.healthkartplus.com/details/drugs/38870/valium-10-mg;jsessionid=me+sYHvOal1v8j5zOkKzqnOM<br /><br />So how many tabs of diazepam of the brand Shalina can I or you buy for&nbsp; â‚¬10,- ?<br /><br />If 30 tabs are sold for 6,50 Rs, that makes 300 tabs for 65,- Rs and that will be for 3000 tabs for 650,-Rs<br />To convert 650Rs in euro&#039;s will be how much?<br /><br />To be added with the 15% margin for wholesale and the 35% margin for retail.

				I have extensive experience with klonopin. When i first started using it, it was great. But now it barely does anything.

The only actual benzo I&#039;ve (knowingly) done is xanax. I took two 1mg pills on separate occasions and preferred etizolam. There is a cross-tolerance I&#039;m pretty sure, and I&#039;d been using some etizolam occasionally around the times I took the xanax. It had only been occassional use though (thus tolerance was still low) and it still seemed like 1mg of etizolam was better than 1mg xanax even though comparable doses of the two are supposedly a 2:1 etizolam:xanax ratio.<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit funny since I expected the opposite after mostly reading on forums people saying etizolam wasn&#039;t as good (before trying xanax, but after trying etizolam). I&#039;d still like to give xanax another shot though. I&#039;ve been taking the etizolam fairly regularly (typically 2-5/day) for the past week and a half or so and am going to (try) to stop now. I think I could manage to not have any noticeable withdrawal symptoms if I went cold turkey, but I might take 1mg/day for the next few days to ease my way down. Anyway, once I&#039;ve allowed my tolerance to go down maybe I&#039;ll try xanax again. Since xanax is usually the most preferred benzo I&#039;m not all that curious about trying others like klonopin or valium. I&#039;d consider taking them if the situation was right and I was offered but I won&#039;t be going out of my way to get a hold of them. And having said all of that, they&#039;re all probably pretty similar in the end if the dosage is right.

				I like aprazolam as a medication against anxiety problems. It&#039;s quick, effective, and that part of its effect isn&#039;t all that susceptible to tolerance either. <br /><br />To get a good nights sleep oxazepam seems to ft the bill very nicely. By the milligram its not very potent at all, but with 50 mg tablets on the market it will probably only take 2 or 3 to knock you out cold.<br /><br />I don&#039;t use benzo&#039;s as recreational drugs though - i fail to see the appeal. Surely they can stop you from worrying, but that usually results in sleep too.

				Drugs like nimetazepam can be very useful for those that want to take them for the intended purpose: falling asleep rapidly after taking them.<br /><br />Flunitrazepam and nimetazepam do have a resputation as being &#039;date rape&#039; drugs because they basically work very well, also if administered to someone else without their knowledge. I suppose that would put them in the &#039;rag soaked in chloroform&#039; category where things like abduction, rape and such are concerned. I suppose all means of knocking out a person quickly would be in that same category though, including hitting someone in the head with a 2x4. Noone is considering a ban on those, however.<br /><br />Sedating a person against their will should by all means be illegal in the western world, but it seems the focus is too much on some specific means of doing so. There is nothing morally wrong with someone taking a substance to knock themselves out quickly, this is all voluntary behavior.<br /><br />Perhaps it would be morally wrong to remove any and all relatively safe means of doing so, leaving people with unhealthy alternatives like solvent abuse. I can assure you the kids on the streets of pnom penh are not huffing glue because its the best method of getting high... it is simply the only resort left to them.
