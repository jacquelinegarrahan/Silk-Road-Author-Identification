				I&#039;ve only found one dude---he&#039;s out west and his prices are impossible to believe $140/Oz for AK-47...besides..I can&#039;t order an OZ---as it&#039;s a felony in my state...so, he&#039;ll have to pinch some out of it (told him HA! bet you&#039;ve never heard someone ASK YOU to pinch from an order). <br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s for Medicinal use...sucks if I lived in CO/CA--I could get it..bust since I live in the South East can&#039;t get it. <br /><br />What&#039;s even&nbsp; more f&#039;d---is that the news says the Mexican Cartel has infiltrated the S.E. and I can&#039;t find SQUAT---I&#039;ve gone through 4-5 friends...NOTHING--not a single thing...even offered a bounty....NOTHING.....

				I don&#039;t mean to be sarcastic here but since your on the silklroad forums, why don&#039;t you look at the Silkroad site?&nbsp; There are many reputable weed dealers.&nbsp; The vendors all have ratings with 100 being the highest.&nbsp; You can find a listing that you like and then pop over here to the forums and see what others are saying about the vendor. If he (or she) has a lot of positive reviews you can order and use the escrow system. <br /><br />

Seems like the only stuff I&#039;ve found are discussions about drugs and effects..haven&#039;t seen anyone post what you can get. Is there a specific forum I should look for...I&#039;ve only been a member of the site about 2+ hours so need help finding it...THANK YOU

				Ok&nbsp; I am assuming that right now you are only accessing the forums.<br />The main site address is<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home<br /><br />Make a user account.&nbsp; after you log on there are menus on the left side for cannabis.&nbsp; It list everything for sale<br /><br />Welcome to SR.&nbsp; If you need any help, the users here are fantastic.<br /><br />

				i disagree. I think christy nugs is the best weed vendor for the price. But she has no buds right now available.<br />Second on the list may be LTTM or Norcal.
