				So I have tried several different batches of coke, and all seem to be pretty good.&nbsp; Came across one recently though that burned the hell out of my nose, not at first, but after a while I had clear drip from my nose and had this horrible pain throughout my nasal cavity.&nbsp; It was so bad that my eyes were tearing so bad and the pain was nearly unbearable.&nbsp; This lasted for about 15 minutes and then all of a sudden stopped.&nbsp; Euphoria etc seemed fine though.&nbsp; Anyone have a clue as to what the fuck is causing this? When going back to the other stuff after this painful shit there is no painful stinging at all.&nbsp; I assume that it&#039;s whatever the coke is cut with, but have no idea what it would be.&nbsp; This was stuff I got from Tetravort a few weeks ago, but I thought his stuff was supposed to be great.

				This makes sense if it&#039;s the same batch I got from Tet (the HWT). It burned the shit out of my nose and made me very jittery. It&#039;s not a bad product but just not what I necessarily want from my coke. Still, Tet is an awesome vendor and I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to order again.

				With any sort of anonymous or pseudonymous statement or purported test, one can never tell whether it is real or gamesmanship by another vendor.&nbsp; I have never felt anything like a burning sensation from HWT (a batch that I quite like, btw), but since two buyers that I know describe mild or not-so-mild burning I have to take this seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it possible that there is amphetamine in the product?&nbsp; I have not tested it so I can&#039;t say no.&nbsp; I have never tried crystal meth, but I have tried some amphetamines and I don&#039;t get the sense that there is an amphetamine component to HWT.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get jittery and when I have tried amphetamines the tweaked sensation lasted a very long time.&nbsp; I used to do what I now consider to be bad coke and that stuff made it very hard to get to sleep.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that stuff had some sort of speed.<br /><br />So how do I go about taking this seriously?&nbsp; I have, up to this point, thought that testing would be too expensive or too unreliable, but I sure would like to be able to make definitive statements about what I know/believe is in the product, for the health and positive experience of everyone who uses it, for integrity as a vendor, but not so much for marketing purposes (as was discussed a few days ago in the coke vendors thread).&nbsp; So I will do some research and try to come up with a manageable battery of tests that I can throw at each new batch.&nbsp; If I am able to put together a set of tests that makes sense to implement, I will release these results on my profile page.&nbsp; Of course you, the buyer, should not believe published tests done by a vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Buyers should still (collaboratively or separately) do testing when they are able.<br /><br /><br />

				TV - I mentioned this in the main vendor thread. You can triple acetone wash + water wash and this will get rid of 99% of any cuts. It will also show you (roughly) what&#039;s in it ... acetone washing will remove most of the &quot;caines&quot;, mannitol etc - and then when you do the water wash, it makes what&#039;s left eminently separable (acetone wont remove pseudo/amphetamine but you&#039;ll be able to separate it really easily after a water wash) <br /><br />If you start with 10g, 3 x wash with anhydrous acetone -&gt; 9g -&gt; water wash/filter -&gt; 7g you know that you&#039;ve got rid of at least 3g of cut, 2g of which is probably active icky cut. <br /><br />What&#039;s left will be as close to pure cocaine as you&#039;ve ever had. As close to 80s coke as you&#039;ll ever find nowadays ;)&nbsp; (shot of an A/B extraction) <br /><br />Message me if you need any help with this mate.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ok there are two methods I&#039;ve heard of to actually test cocaine easily - one is bringing a small sample up to its melting point. If it is impure, it will flash way before 187C .. <br /><br />There&#039;s also the bleach test. <br /><br />Fill a shooter class, dump in 2CC of bleach <br /><br />-cocaine is only &quot;caine&quot; that will not turn orange in bleach<br />-amphetamines turn red<br />-coke forms a slow milky trail that slowly falls like snow<br />-inactive fillers will clumps white at top or bottom&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t have to use much.

				I thought it would be fair to talk about Tet&#039;s SVN batch here, at least briefly. <br /><br />It&#039;s definitely not HWT. It is way smoother and wasn&#039;t speedy for me at all. At first it was almost too mellow, but I definitely grew to appreciate it after the first few samplings and consider one of the best batches I&#039;ve ever had, even in retrospect.
