				Once upon a time, I stumbled upon the following magic combination of drugs. It stands as the most awesome, astonishing, and profound experience of my life. See end of post for trip description.<br /><br /><br />INGREDIENTS.<br /><br />* THC: 1-2 grams - sufficient for the cocktail, but more is needed for the PREP phase (see below)<br /><br />* LSD: about 3 tabs<br /><br />* N2O: nitrous oxide in the form of whip cream chargers:<br />http://www.amazon.com/iSi-N2O-Cream-Chargers-24-Pack/dp/B00007JXR4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338833667&amp;sr=8-1<br /><br />* Whip cream dispenser: <br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_18?url=search-alias%3Dgarden&amp;field-keywords=whipped+cream+dispenser&amp;sprefix=whipped+cream+disp%2Cgarden%2C202<br /><br />* DXM: enough for a level 2 plateau for the cocktail, but more is needed for the PREP phase (see below).<br />I used Coricidin Cough &amp; Cold HBP. Note that some people dislike Coricidin, and for good reason; the antihistamine it also contains can alter the quality of a DXM trip, and after several Coricidin sessions, even *looking* at a box of Coricidin may make you nauseous. That said, this is what I used in my cocktail to obtain the results described at the end of this post. DXM dosage and usage FAQ: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/<br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_ex_n_0?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acoricidin&amp;keywords=coricidin&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338833814<br /><br />* 10-16 hours of free time.<br /><br /><br />PREPARATION.<br /><br />These are the steps I took to prepare for a smooth experience.<br /><br />PREP 1: Smoke weed regularly (at least a few times a week) for a couple of weeks in advance of the main trip.<br /><br />PREP 2: Take DXM (level 2 plateau) a week prior to the main trip.&nbsp; I think it was important that I had a basic comfort level and familiarity with the 2nd-plateau DXM experience before the main trip; DXM can be a completely baffling drug experience for the uninitiated. Doing DXM recently before the main trip was also important. DXM FAQ: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/<br /><br /><br />COCKTAIL RECIPE.<br /><br />Here are the steps I take for this cocktail.<br /><br />STEP 1. Take enough DXM for a level 2 plateau experience.<br />STEP 2. Wait for the DXM to peak, and have a nice level 2 plateau trip.<br />STEP 3. IMPORTANT: waited until I was coming down from the DXM. When reality starts to seem somewhat normal again, it&#039;s time to proceed. This was several hours after step 1.<br />STEP 4. Take 2-3 hits of LSD.<br />STEP 5. Wait until the LSD is going good and strong; around 60 minutes.<br />STEP 6. Smoke some weed (a few hits from a pipe). The goal is to get the combined effects of THC, LSD, and the DXM aftereffects -- NOT to get blazed all to hell and back.<br />STEP 7. Wait 10-15 minutes for everything to kick in and gel together into a smooth unified experience.<br />STEP 8. IT IS TIME. Load up the nitrous oxide charger, crack it, and inhale a lungful. Hold it a few seconds ... and exhale.<br />STEP 9. Have the most mind-blowingly awesome 1-minute experience of my life.<br />STEP 10. Repeat from step 8 as desired. Each subsequent experience is likely to be more mind-blowing than the last, until the other drug effects start to peter out.<br /><br /><br />WHAT HAPPENED.<br /><br />The easiest way to describe the overall character of these experiences for me is that it is like a 60 second commercial that the mind creates, but instead of just visually seeing something, it involves all the senses and thoughts. The experience only lasted 60 seconds each time, but had the quality of telling a story that took exactly as long as the experience is to play out to its logical completion.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had several incredible trips using this drug combo and approach, but I&#039;ll only describe the most amazing one here.<br /><br />After exhaling the nitrous...<br /><br />First 15 seconds: I hear the sounds of cars driving by. I realize that I am not actually hearing cars driving by right NOW, but that my mind is actually replaying &quot;samples&quot; of the cars I have heard drive by in the last 10-15 minutes. Moreover, my mind has arranged the samples I am hearing in ascending order of pitch; first I hear a low pitch rumbling semi driving by, then the next-higher-pitch one, etc. one after the other in unbroken succession.<br /><br />Next 5 seconds: My eyes are closed. It occurs to me that I am connected to my drug-taking partner sitting next to me; this is accompanied by a visualization of the two of us as glowing purple lights, with a glowing purple beam connecting us. I can not just see, but *feel* this connection within me.<br /><br />Next 5 seconds: It occurs to me that as my partner and I are connected, so am I connected to other people that I know. My visualized field of vision expands to include additional people as glowing purple lights, each connected to each, and to me. I feel all these connections.<br /><br />Next 5 seconds: It occurs to me that thousands and millions of people are all connected to me and to each other in this way. My field of vision continually expands to include countless glowing purple lights. I now feel that I am physically moving through my visualization space. As my awareness of the purple lights expands, I find myself moving up and away from my original location, in order to see the full expanse of the interconnected purple lights. <br /><br />Next 5 seconds: I am now seeing that the lights are forming along a spherical shell in space, connected along the shell&#039;s edges. It is gradually becoming more and more of a complete shell as more consciousnesses are added in my awareness.<br /><br />Next second: The shell of lights is complete: the lights at the point farthest from me have come around each side of the shell and met one another to complete the shell. I realize that every consciousness in existence is connected with every other, and to me. I feel and am aware of the inherent interconnectedness of all beings.<br /><br />Next 5 seconds: The shell gradually transforms and morphs before me. Now instead of a shell, I behold a softly radiating white egg, located in front of and above me. It appears that the egg has no concrete edges; it is made up of light which is most concentrated towards its center.<br /><br />Next 2 seconds: As I behold the glowing egg it occurs to me that I am observing the hope represented by the existence of all humanity; the egg symbolizes all of humanity, and what goodness may in time be hatched from humanity&#039;s work in the world. A sense of utter joy permeates my mind.<br /><br />Next 2 seconds: Gazing on the egg, I hear a voice echo in my mind: &quot;Is everyone inside? Is everyone .... *inside*?&quot; (I later discovered what I was hearing was the voice of Jim Morrison of The Doors; the audio of this quote can be found online) I realize the voice is referring to what happens upon death; that when we finally die, perhaps when we arrive at the proverbial pearly gates, the proverbial gatekeeper might ask, &quot;Is everyone inside?&quot; ... but with a wink. The wink and &#039;joke&#039; being that both after death and before, everyone is already always &quot;inside&quot; -- inside the egg that represents all of connected humanity -- but that most people don&#039;t normally believe they are connected in this way before death, and that upon death, it will be so obvious to us, that it will be comical to us that we didn&#039;t realize it while we were still alive.<br /><br />Next 3 seconds: I hear in my mind the sound of a woman&#039;s sigh, &quot;ahhhhhhh...&quot; The sigh is an expression of total relief, and peace. The vision fades.<br /><br />Next 15 seconds: I hear the car &quot;samples&quot; that I heard in the first 30 seconds of the experience, but this time, they have been arranged in *descending* order of pitch. The samples are played in the opposite order as originally, in succession.<br /><br />Next 60 seconds: I am so astounded and baffled by this awesome and profound experience that I cannot form words sufficient to express to my drug partner what just happened. It takes about 15 minutes before I can really start making any sort of understandable explanation.<br /><br />Truly an amazing experience, and well worth the effort.

One time I was looking at my girlfriend when I took the nitrous and as I was watching, she basically turned into an Alex Grey painting -- something more or less like these pics:<br />http://www.motley-focus.com/praying.jpg<br />http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__ih5cV3YM2c/SNnBd6MDF1I/AAAAAAAAAhc/9_h3Gta9lbM/s400/alex+gray+036.jpg<br />http://files.darktaleradionation.webnode.com/200000456-5c9c65d964/alex-grey.jpg<br /><br />Even just the sounds part is something quite different from what I call the &quot;nitrous helicopters&quot; ... my experience was that rather than altering the current sound hitting my ears, I was actually hearing sounds that my brain had remembered/recorded from the recent past, but organized in a different way from originally.

I think I must have been thinking of a 3rd plateau trip when talking about that.<br /><br />It was a long time ago, but I think the dosage I used in the cocktail was only 2nd plateau. But yeah it would probably be good for anyone wanting to try this cocktail to have a couple 3rd plateau trips ... the first time I had a 3rd plateau trip, I remember thinking, &quot;I do not understand what I am experiencing&quot; ;) It took me a few trips to be able to make &quot;sense&quot; out of the 3rd plateau experience ... if you can even call it &quot;sensical&quot; ... <br /><br />I&#039;ve had conversations on 3rd plateau trips that made complete sense during the trip, but afterwards it seemed like the things we were saying were completely random and nonsensical. It&#039;s a completely weird state of mind, to be sure.

				In case someone&#039;s curious, I found an approximate audio clip of the Jim Morrison quote I mentioned in my original post:<br />http://www.hark.com/clips/llcgcgrvkc-out-here-we-is-stoned<br /><br />It&#039;s not exactly as I heard it; my mind perhaps had altered it a bit. Jim&#039;s intonation in the first few seconds of this clip closely reflect the half-jesting way I heard it during the aforementioned trip experience though.
