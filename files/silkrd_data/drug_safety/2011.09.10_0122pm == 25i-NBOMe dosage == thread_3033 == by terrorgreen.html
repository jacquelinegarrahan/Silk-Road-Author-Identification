				Sorry to hijack your thread terrorgreen. Can any share their experience with 25c-NBOMe. there is currently 25c-NBOMe 500ug Blotters on SR. I was checking out erowid and the dose says 400ug+ is strong so would be interested to see what people think of these if they have done them?<br /><br />peace<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve tried ENBOOM&#039;s blotters twice; both times I took a total of 2.5mg. First time I took 2 hits (500 mics each) and waited ~2.5 hours and I didn&#039;t notice much of anything, so I took the rest I had (3 more tabs @ 500mics each). That was a really good trip. A good amount of visuals, and a little introspective.<br /><br />Second time I took the whole 2.5mg at once. Very good trip. just like the first but everything was more intense. I had a fair bit of stomach-in-the-throat throughout the entire trip.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also vaped/smoked ~10mg of 25i. Holy jumping fucking shit balls. The world around me melted and disappeared 30 seconds after I inhaled. At&nbsp; this dose and with this route of administration, I was even getting&nbsp; MAJOR auditory hallucinations. All of my organs felt like they were desperately trying to jump out of my mouth. Puked once, wasn&#039;t too bad.

				I&#039;ve had one experience with 25i. Took one hit (ENBOOM&#039;s product) of 750ug buccally. Quite intense body load for the first couple of hours. Very mild visuals and headspace. Music sounded like shit :(<br /><br />I imagine this could potentially be fun at higher doses, though. Good luck!<br /><br />Edit: oh, and don&#039;t forget to keep the stuff in your mouth till the paper deteriorates (typically 30-60 minutes). I&#039;ve witnessed, and heard from others, that this does make a difference.

				I&#039;ve taken 1.5mg and 1.875mg. Both trips were incredibly visual. It bothered my throat and stomach a bit, and also irritated a problem I had with my hands, but otherwise it was a fantastic trip. Those were some ridiculous adventures.
