				OK, I know this may appear a dumb ass question - and that&#039;s why I have a new user ID for this one - so please don&#039;t just shoot me down. So, just how addictive is H? I would love to try it out, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m guilty of lapping up all the negative rap it has. As far as I&#039;m concerned, one line and I&#039;ll be hooked for life and destroy my entire family and probably a few others. I know it can be addictive and it can be hell to get off. But I&#039;m no youngster (far from it!), and I seem to have incredible restraint for most drugs including coke, speed and benzos which I am very careful with. I&#039;ve been dabbling in recreational drug use for a good 30 years now, and amazingly enough, I lead a good lifestyle etc. My mantra has always been &#039;moderation&#039;, and it&#039;s worked for me, and got me this far.<br /><br />So, are there any casual users of H out there? Can it be recreational?<br /><br />Serious answers on a postcard please...<br /><br />Thanks.

				It really depends on you yourself and comes down to how much you been using opiates recently.&nbsp; For me personally there&#039;s always that leap from when recreational use is escalated to habitual use.&nbsp; Like with h or other opiates I&#039;ll be able to use it recreationally for a while, but there&#039;s always a point to when you know you&#039;re using too much.&nbsp; I would recommend sticking with percs or roxys if you haven&#039;t been doing too many opiates recently.&nbsp; The reason h is so useful is because its a hell of a lot cheaper than a lot of the other prescription meds on the site.&nbsp; So you get a lot more &quot;bang for your buck&quot; sort to speak.&nbsp; If you know you&#039;ll only use it once to just try it out then I&#039;d say you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re the type of person that always wants more then I would not recommend it.&nbsp; Like I said, it really depends on you personally.&nbsp; Anyways be safe and use your head.

				Oh man. Firstly, H is quite a subtle buzz compared to many drugs. You wont feel WD at all if you use for less than 3 days. The &#039;buzz&#039; basically cures any problems you can &#039;feel&#039;, ie. psychological or physical (not financial, lol). Hence, the more fucked up you are in the head &amp; body the more you generally gain. Whilst it might take a while to get physically addicted, psychological addiction can be very quick. <br /><br />Just because you&#039;re not in WD doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t often think &#039;I&#039;d feel a fuck of a lot better if I had some H&#039; regularly. It took me ages to realize I was physically addicted - I just thought I was a bit ill and therefore the reasons to score again were more justified. The WD&#039;s only really become apparent when you can&#039;t sleep because of them.<br /><br />I could go on. All I will say is you shouldn&#039;t underestimate the pain you feel and how addictive temporary relief from said pain can be. WD&#039;s are terrible but they last 3-5 days and won&#039;t kill you, most go through them many times yet still return to H.&nbsp; Whilst this is all pretty negative stuff, when I first got into H I was a heavy crack addict with many issues. Since then I have abstained from the stone, got a degree, a means of supporting myself and haven&#039;t been arrested since then. There a worse problems than H addiction and even the terrible WD&#039;s. <br /><br />Apologies for the length, feel free to ask questions/pm me.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the response guys. I expected to be blasted out of this forum higher than the recent BC spike :) And thanks Mr_P, I may well pm you for further reading :)<br /><br />I can say no. Well, I have been able to so far in life. And that&#039;s why I am tempted. I *believe* I can be an occasional user. But hell, I have no idea do I?<br /><br />All I do know is that the only opiates I&#039;ve tried is dihydro-codeine, and for the last 5 years I&#039;ve had codeine on script for pain. I tend to take just 120mg each day, and I just love the warmth I get from it. So it gets me thinking....So many of my other recreational drugs of choice (coke, MDMA and Speed) no longer hit the spot. I&#039;m tired (and too old) to be getting the edgy stimulant feelings these days. More and more I like some good weed, some fine wine and the codeine feel. I just know I will like it. I just pray I can resist diving in too deep.

				Hey letmeout, how would you be using the h if you do indeed get it - snorting, IV, smoking?&nbsp; Also let me know what you end up deciding.&nbsp;

				Just to echo what a lot of the other posters here have said, your experience with H and how addicting psychologically/physically it is to you is going to depend on you as an individual. Snorting one line won&#039;t get you immediately physically addicted - far from it. You&#039;d have to snort on a daily basis for 4+ days to feel withdrawal symptoms, and even then they probably wouldn&#039;t be too bad. <br /><br />Moreso what you have to worry about is that if you do start chipping, you&#039;re going to start craving it. If you can control yourself and remain a chipper (which, despite what some will tell you, can be done if you have the will power) then great, more power to you. However, at least from my personal experience, you need to stay away from IVing. I&#039;ve been an occasional recreational user for a few years now and while sometimes I do have a tolerance from snorting (and which is a reminder to me that I need to tone it down), I know that if I IV even one time, that will be my turning point and will put me in a hole I can&#039;t crawl out of. I&#039;ve been successful up until this point at resisting the urge to shoot up, and because of it I&#039;ve remained in control of my life.<br /><br />I personally believe that heroin doesn&#039;t have to be a negative force in someone&#039;s life. If you can control yourself, if you can take responsibility for when and how much you do, and if you remain constantly vigilant, then using heroin can be a beautiful experience that can enrich your life. Whether it becomes the bane of your existence is up to you, so please always be mindful. Good luck :)

				Knowing some friends who have gone down that road... it&#039;s gonna happen eventually, no matter how strongly willed you think you are. The feeling is just too good. Heroin changes you, into a moster that just wants more Heroin and will do whatever it takes to get more.<br /><br />And once you are physically addicted, that monster grows exponentially. You lose weight because food money goes toward it, you start injecting if you haven&#039;t already, and if it gets bad enough you just want to hang it up.<br /><br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, opiates are a beautiful thing. But because of how quickly H crosses the BBB, it is especially nice because of the rush it provides. It&#039;s like morphines bigger brother who worked out and grew two acetyl groups that help it punch into your brain quicker =D<br /><br />And if you can control it, and *Truely* moderate it, then doing it every once in&nbsp; a while there is no harm in. Just watch yourself. The MOMENT you start fiending, put it down. PM me if you need advice, quite a few people I know have been down that road. Not one of them could out will the beautiful daemon.<br /><br />Stay safe.

				34, never a truer word. I&#039;m no regular user. Far from it. Neither would I ever want to be. H, like all the good things in life, should be a treat. Maybe that sounds childish. A celebration then. It&#039;s a unique thing with its unique pleasures and pains. Of all drugs, there is so much bullshit malicious propaganda about H that people thing anyone who ever even tried heroin is barely one step up from a child killer. It&#039;s just like booze, food, religion, guns, sex, anything. Use it as an enjoyment to celebrate a facet of life and not as a crutch to support a fragile psyche or a band aid to cover a mental wound. If you take anything regularly as a refuge from (mental) torment, it will fuck you up.<br />I&#039;m high now on C63&#039;s new gear. I&#039;ve had a couple of smokes after a very long day&#039;s work. I&#039;ve tomorrow off so why not?. I probably won&#039;t have any more for a fair while. It&#039;s people who are addictive. Drugs are addicting. But usually only if you&#039;re in that psychological space of an addictive personality. Well,that&#039;s what I believe anyway :)

				It depends on the quality and route of administration, but more importantly it depends on the user. Someone who has an addictive personality and has little self control should stay away from drugs like heroin, but it definitely can be used safely and casually.
