				&nbsp;Yes I know. I did LSD once with people I was comfortable with but I had the worst trip ever. It was really scary. That&#039;s why I am just scared. If I can just get passed this then I will take them with my friends that I trust.

				Once you are able to convince yourself even ONE time that you will never let drugs eat your psyche.. you will never have a bad trip again. <br /><br />It takes practice.. although there isn&#039;t much hope over 14g of teachers or 10 hits of lucy.. you&#039;re on your own @ that point ;)<br /><br />

				With mushrooms I never ever had a bad trip, while on lsd I&#039;m often struggling even in low doses to control negative feelings.<br />It&#039;s really up to personal mind structures..<br /><br />My advice is taking a smaller dose in the beginning.. And then after an hour / an hour an a half take the rest if you feel the need.

				Jump right in, they&#039;re awesome. Eat 2g, you&#039;re pretty unlikely to have a bad trip on that kind of dose. <br />Sometimes they can get a bit scary as you head up towards 3g and beyond, but the dark bits are unlikely to last longer than an hour (though it might feel like longer). Do it with properly experienced trippers, people who have had balls to the wall bad trips are likely to know all the tricks to help you have a smooth and happy trip. As robotzombies said tryptamines are spiritual, they call up very deep, atavistic parts of your mind.<br /><br />Top tip- this may sound a bit stupid but try not to &#039;think&#039; too much until you&#039;re past the midway point of the trip. Dwelling on what the fuck&#039;s happening to your mind can make you internalise the trip and start to panic as you stumble through normally mundane phenomena like time, reality and perception&nbsp; :D<br />If things start to get weird, engage with the external. Dance, eat some cakes, watch something light, play with some engaging toy (wire mandalas are cool, as is that ferromagnetic fluid). Roll some spliffs before you come up, it get&#039;s exponentially harder with time.

				Mushrooms are great - but dont ride a motorbike straight after.<br /><br />I was on an island in Thailand that is now a major tourist resort, but at that stage was just cow-paddocks, straw huts, and a few bars on the beach.<br /><br />One of them advertised majic mushies for breakfast.&nbsp; We thought yeah, clever advertising, drugs are highly illegal in Thailand (generally have to ask), not on signs.&nbsp; So we had a big serve.<br /><br />On the bikes and 3 out of 4 were off within 5 minutes, nothing serious, didn&#039;t hit anything just a fright.&nbsp; Anyway has hallugenics mushrooms are generally quite mild in my experience and wont make monsters appear from under rocks, although there probably is stronger ones, not really into hallugenics, I am a speed, meth boy (old man)
