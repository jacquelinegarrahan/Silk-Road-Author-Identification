				How pure is the meth on here?<br />My friend used to get desoxyn (prescription methamphetamine) for me from his doc, but he is unable to anymore :(<br />If i bought meth on here, is it possible to get pure shards or are they always cut? Ideally I would like buy .25 grams and split them up into 10 or 20 mg capsules and swallow them

				Until some thorough meth vendor review make their way here, you could kill time by checking http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/318209-Purifying-Meth , especially 2nd and 8th post.

Maybe not AS perfectly pure as pharmaceutical methamphetamine, but it can definitely be used effectively at therapeutic doses.

				You cannot compare street drugs to pharmaceuticals friend. Sure, there is some great meth out there(I don&#039;t partake, but still) however you cannot compare it to what a pharm company can produce. They&#039;re making it with zero legal concerns, unlimited resources, using some of the best chemists in the world. If you can&#039;t access pharms go for the street drug, but don&#039;t compare the two. I imagine if some opiate users had the opportunity to IV real Bayer Heroin they would say that it is not even the same drug as the dope that is out there now.

				so does that mean any street drug is automatically cut including mdma and ketamine?

				I would say that that means that because clandestine chemists don&#039;t have the same resources, equipment, and expertise as pharmaceutical chemists, even if you get uncut product there will inherently be some impurities in your street drug. Some drugs are cut more often than others (read: cocaine, heroin). Some drugs are harder to cut, like methamphetamine (although it is still just as much a possibility) due to it coming in crystal form usually. MDMA is another example. If you get it on SR from a reputable vendor, chances are you&#039;re gonna be getting 80-85% pure MDMA HCl. The percentages will fluctuate when dealing with street drugs just because purity standards are either lower than pharmaceutical companies or are non-existent. I mean, if the street chemist makes the drug and people can take the supposed active dose and get high, then they&#039;re gonna sell it as-is.<br /><br />TL;DR - Not all street drugs are cut. Street drugs are usually less pure than pharmaceuticals because they don&#039;t have the same quality control.
