				hey, this thread is for a friend of mine who abused MDMA for a week straight (used 2 grams of 90%~ pure crystals)<br /><br />he had no negative affects until 2 days after his last dosage when he starting feeling a strange tingling in his heart and head whenever he would stand up and sometimes while just walking around<br /><br />he obviously completely depleted his serotonin because after day 5 his pupils would not dilate and he wouldn&#039;t feel anything.. I am worried for him and wondering if he should maybe visit the hospital, what do you guys think?<br /><br />he has been having these tingling feelings in his heart and head for a couple days now<br /><br />thanks for any help

				by the way, this might be completely unrelated but..<br /><br />we were out smoking some hash oil on a cigarette (bottle tokes is what we call them) and my friend isn&#039;t a smoker so sometimes he gets sick from the tobacco.. he said the tingling in his heart and chest came immediately after becoming sick the other night when we were doing bottle tokes.. so maybe it was a combo of the MDMA binge and the cigarette smoke?<br /><br />he gets sick very often from tobacco but has never had this tingling sensation before, so that&#039;s why I am thinking its the MDMA or something

				I&#039;ve also noticed that weird tingling in the heart.<br />I&#039;m not quite sure what it&#039;s from or if it&#039;s the same thing your friend is experiencing but I have thought before that it might be related to my mdma use.<br />Granted, I&#039;ve never gone through a gram in a week, but there have been times when I probably should spaced out my rolls a little better. <br />I hope your friend feels better soon. It is probably best he lays of the MDMA for a min.

				:/ <br />while two grams in a week is a lot, I have heard of people doing close to a gram in one night. And you can always bet that there are those who have done more. <br /><br />There is an awesome MDMA harm reduction thread here at the forums (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0)<br /><br />I would start taking some 5-HTP to help with the replenishment of his Serotonin. Eat some salmon,greens,turkey and high anti-oxidant foods such as blueberries and chocolate.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Get out and do some exercise; walk, jog etc etc. <br /><br />Take a break from MDMA for a minimum of 2-3 months, but if your buddy is really fried I would take maybe a 6 month break before even attempting to take MDMA again. Until he feels like his mind had returned to a baseline state of normality for a month or two. He needs to let his brain heal...

				In general a hospital visit is not necessary in these cases. I did the same a while back and had some strange headache etc.. and depression ofcourse. But it will all sort itself out. However I strongly recommend your friend to quit MDMA because even on such a short time your&nbsp; brain will be fried.<br />I once ingested 8 pills of +-200 mg in one evening.(that&#039;s 1.6 grams !)&nbsp; If I recall correctly it were only the first 2 maybe 3 pillls which I enjoyed; the next 14 days I consumed another 32 pills of the same quality with only a four day break somewhere in between those 14 days to try let my serotonine restore. This was utter crap ofcourse; from the 40 pills I took over the 2 week period, there maybe 3-4 enjoyable experiences; the rest was wasted money and brain.

				The first time I ever had pure MDMA crystals was last summer. I bought a gram from a guy who had used SR to order MDMA from Supertrips. I either took one gram in one night, or one gram over the course of two night, i don&#039;t remember. Anyway, the day after my mini binge, I had some strange side effects as well. I would just be laying down watching t.v or something, and all of a sudden I would get this weird sensation all over my body for a few seconds. It&#039;s hard to describe, but it felt like I was rolling face while going downhill on a roller coaster. This would happen to me sporadically for a few days. It wasn&#039;t a painful sensation, just uncomfortable, especially when it would happen to me in a public place. Long story short, I&#039;ve been more responsible with my MDMA usage as of late. I usually do it once a month, but never more than once in a week. I don&#039;t take as much anymore either. .15 of the bomb shit will make for a nice night

				These sensations you guys are describing sound like the &quot;brain zaps&quot; experienced by SSRI users going through withdrawal.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome#Neurological<br /><br />There&#039;s also a thread about it somewhere.

				I had no idea you could inject MDMA&nbsp; :o Does that make the effects a lot stronger? I personally would never inject anything into my body unless it was medicine. It would have to make you roll like 20 times harder for me to even consider doing that. No offense to those that do inject though. Just my own personal opinion

				I think taking it easy and taking 5-HTP is probably the best course of action. And also laying off the MDMA for several months.<br /><br />I also had weird bodily sensations for a couple days after I binged on MDMA, but I also didn&#039;t take it as far as your friend did (I did like .5g in like 5 days).
