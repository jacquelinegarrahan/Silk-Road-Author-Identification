				Hello,<br /><br />I had some questions about DMT safety.&nbsp; I have bought and acquired some and I am quite keen on trying it.&nbsp; Do I need a trip sitter for my first time?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard rumors that it&#039;s possible to fall over or drop the pipe and burn yourself and that it basically puts you unconscious for the short duration of the trip.&nbsp; Any other safety precautions I should take?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve done other psychedelics, so I am experienced in that realm, just never been able to find DMT until now.&nbsp;

				Hi Mike...hope that&#039;s not your real name?!<br /><br />DMT is a big topic, have you checked out Erowid and www.dmt-nexus.com ?<br /><br />Speaking from experience:<br /><br />It can be tricky to smoke &quot;right&quot;, it burns easily, and tastes really bad anyway. What worked best for me was a litre/quart plastic bottle, with a bong-hole near the base. Gauze on top, with DMT in. Fill bottle with water, then drain, whilst holding the flame near (but not ON) the stuff. You should end up with a bottle of white smoke, shake a bit to cool (using the dregs of the water) and then WHOOMF in one go, ideally. Easier said than done.<br /><br />It can come on almost immediately, which is why I gave up trying to torch it in a normal pipe, far too much co-ordination required.<br /><br />When I first got it &quot;exactly right&quot; I came round still rooted to the kitchen sink, about 20 mins later (despite being only a few yards from my carefully set up tripping room). Don&#039;t remember much other than falling through a crystal skyscraper, all lit up, white on black...<br /><br />Most other times, using less or being more inefficient, I made it as far as the primary colored elf-space, which is probably my preferred &quot;level&quot;.<br /><br />A sitter is not a bad idea, but in any event just make sure the pipe/flame cannot fall anywhere dangerous (hence the sink).<br /><br />The only big no-no is alcohol, tried it once after a couple of vodkas at a friends, never again. Blacked out, laying down, and woke up coughing, covered in &quot;cottage cheese&quot; vomit. Still freaked out by what could have happened...<br /><br />On the Nexus site you&#039;ll see a lot about respecting the &quot;spice&quot; and the elves, and there is definitely something in that. Besides the trickiness of consuming it properly, it can be capricious too; no two times alike!<br /><br />Best of luck.

				I think it would be best to be in a reclined or at least seated position for the experience. I sitter willing to chill with you and be quiet for ten or fifteen minutes is definitely recommended
