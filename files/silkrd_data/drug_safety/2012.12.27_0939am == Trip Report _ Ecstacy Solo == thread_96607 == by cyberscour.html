				Before I start this report I&#039;d like to say, this is the first drug I&#039;ve ever done. I have been sober my whole life, no beer, no smoking, etc. this ecstasy tablet was the first drug or intoxicant I have ever done, ever. This may just be, the weirdest most disturbing trip report you will read, and to all you kids that want to take ecstasy, do not underestimate it!!!<br /><br />Dosage : 75mg (bumped 75mg more later)<br /><br /><br /><br />0:00 Took half a pill of ecstacy, a 75mg dose. I&#039;m sitting in my bed, playing nintendo 64 home alone. Generally in a calm mindset.<br /><br />0:30 Seemingly no effect so far, stomach hurting a little, considering taking other half if nothing happens soon. <br /><br />0:45 I paused the game I was playing and went to my bathroom downstairs. I had a little bit of a head rush while going to the bathroom, thought nothing about it until I went to wash my hands. I turned the faucet on and it felt like my mind was ahead of time, like I knew I turned the faucet before I turned it. I felt nauseous and I think the drugs kicking in. Went back to my room and continued playing my game.<br /><br />1:00 Definitely coming up now. I stopped playing the game because I felt like my head was going to blow up and I could not sit still anymore. I started frantically pacing across my room and searching for a way to make this less intense on the internet, I even made a post on the forum asking how to stop the trip!<br /><br />1:15 I stopped panicking and accepted the fact that I&#039;m not coming down for a little while. I kept trying to sleep in my bed to calm me down, but when I closed my eyes I saw crazy rainbow spirals spinning around in my eyes that just made me more energized, and I kept pacing around the house. Turned my nintendo64 off because it couldn&#039;t keep my focus for more than 3 seconds. I also started talking, so I could listen to how fast I was speaking, and I couldn&#039;t understand a word I was saying.<br /><br />1:30 Extreme euphoria all of a sudden. Everything felt all right, I sat down at my desk and turned on some electronic music. The music made my face tingle so much, every song sounded so beautiful. I got up and ran around my room for a little while.<br /><br />2:00 Everything feels so furry, things start getting really weird and I liked it a lot and thought I was a sex god. I didn&#039;t feel like I was in love with people or closer to anything, but I became obsessed with rubbing my body all over surfaces. I took off all my clothes and started rolling on the floor, laughing a lot, and rubbing my hands all over my face.<br /><br />2:20 Got this amazing idea, I jumped into bed and started hugging and kissing all my blankets and pillows. I was shoving the sheets in my mouth just to feel them inside of me....<br /><br />3:00 Things felt like they were going downhill, so I bumped another 75mg of my ecstacy. <br /><br />3:30 Went downstairs and made some hot chocolate and mac and cheese. BIG MISTAKE. It looked so good, but I just didn&#039;t feel like eating it after I made it. I dipped my hands in the mac and cheese and hot chocolate and rubbed it all over my face because it felt really really good. Then I spilled it on the floor and started rolling around in it to feel it&#039;s arousing warmth I started talking to myself and narrating every one of my actions. I burned my face and I think I&#039;m going insane.<br /><br />4:00 There&#039;s mac and cheese and hot chocolate all over me. I decided to go take a shower. I turned the cold water on and just started rubbing myself against the walls of the shower and pouring all sorts of shampoo all over me.<br /><br />4:30 I got out of the shower and jumped into my bed and literally made love to my sheets and pillows. It felt like it was the most romantic moment of my life.<br /><br />5:00 I still feel extreme euphoria and I still want to molest every object in sight, but I started to feel less energized, so I sat down at my computer and started to express my intense love to people on omegle, they called me weird and insane and they told me that I needed to calm down, but I honestly took those as compliments and they only made me feel happier.<br /><br />6:00 The ecstasys wearing off, don&#039;t really feel energized, or really happy like I was. I don&#039;t really feel anything. I had this &quot;what the fuck was I doing&quot; feeling after I went downstairs and saw the mess I made on the kitchen floor. I had a mild headache that I couldn&#039;t tell where it came from.<br /><br />7:00 I&#039;m calm now, no effects at all, I feel empty and peaceful inside. Overall it was a good time, and it went by really quick. Would I do it again? Yes, but probably not alone after what my trip report said...<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend taking ecstasy alone, especially on your first time. I did such weird things that I would of had never done sober, ecstasy really just released a whole new side of me that wants to touch and get into EVERYTHING. Oh and on last notes, I have insomnia, is that normal to have after an ecstasy trip?<br />

				Sounds like a great pill mate. First time can be pretty full on.<br /><br />At least you had a good one for your first time, next time go out and hit a dance floor with some friends or just go solo and feel the music. ;)

				Well that does sound an awful lot more like ecstasy than I thought it would based on being scared of the come up. I once went through a giant half bottle of lotion once on MDA just rubbing that shit all over me for hours. All in all it&#039;s best to do with someone else just because there is this really cool thing that happens where you piratically become psychic. It goes something like this:<br /><br />&quot;I love pillows.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh my god... I love pillows too!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They are just fucking great aren&#039;t they?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That is exactly what I was thinking, they are just fucking great... It&#039;s like you can read my mind.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, welcome to the wonderful world of X. Glad to see you didn&#039;t go insane on the dossing or do it somewhere stupid stressful where you would have had to keep pulling yourself out of the fun. The biggest reason to do it with someone that has done it before the first time is just to avoid that fear. I tell anyone I do it with:<br /><br />1. You&#039;re going to fucking love it.<br />2. You&#039;re going to fucking love everything while you are on it.<br />3. Nothing bad is going to happen but sometimes people sweat a lot when they take it and some people throw up coming up or coming down and that&#039;s just fine.<br />4. You&#039;re going to want to take more, make sure you don&#039;t have too much handy.<br />5. You&#039;ll feel a little crappy or down after you take it and that&#039;s just fine. You just got the most wonderful euphoria for a few hours and the price is a little emptiness while your body recharges.<br /><br />A few things to note if you do end up doing it with a pretty girl / boy around is that everything is sensual (i.e. the bed sheets :-) but very little is sexual. To put it bluntly, things don&#039;t always work in the plumbing department when you are tripping balls. If I know I really want to have some sex I&#039;ll take some Viagra but normally even then your brain thinks you are already cumming on the drug so actually getting to physical orgasm can be a challenge. Since this was your first time I thought I would put it out there before you tried and failed, don&#039;t worry though, all the touching is just dandy even if there&#039;s no intercourse.<br /><br />Hope you get to do it again and have some more fun. Dosing MDMA can be a pain sometimes so if possible go with the same pill you took tonight if you can until you know more about the drug. Taking too much will normally just make you more e-tarded (i.e. after rubbing mac and cheese all over yourself you might ponder how much jello would add to the fun). Personally I love looking over to my GF, seeing her eyes rolling in the back of her head, hearing her moan softly at the lightest touch and knowing we look like basket cases for an hour or two but everyone has their own opinion of fun.<br /><br />Long Live the Road!<br />

				I think the problem was that I took too much. I started getting really really weird after taking the other 75mg...
