				hello fellow Silkroadians.&nbsp; i know a guy who is in possession of some bulk coke . The price works out to about 6$ a gram.&nbsp; This does&nbsp; not seem plausible to me whatsoever . <br />I did some with him all night and it definitely got us a high and numbed every crevice within my sinuses and throat . this price seems too good to be true, anyone know of any instances of a research chems being cut with with one of the&nbsp; cane families? its jjust too hard to believe one can buy bulk coke for pennies on the dollar. any experienced inquiries would be much appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;ps. grams of coke here go&nbsp; for about 80-100 here

				It somewhat depends on the bulk he bought, the link to the cartel the guy he bought it from was (was he in a cartel?) given that there should be a doubling up at each stage of the dealing heres how I figure this could happen<br />Created-&gt; smuggled -&gt; cartel distributor -&gt; cuts about 50% with lidocaine/tetrocaine and puts some form of stimulant in there for the upping (say caffeine) that cartel distributor sells off his bulk in Kilos / Lbs your friend buys otherwise 20$ coke for 6$/lb because of the cut. <br /><br />street prices in east coast USA are about 50$/gr for 70+% so its feasible that 20$ could be the ultra bulk pure price to dealers, and as low as 6$/g for a cut product. I would still advise getting reagent tests though, always be careful of great deals in the drug world.

				Typical reagent kits do not test concentration though, just presence. A powder mixture containing 1% cocaine and 99% inactive crap would still result in a positive reagent test result, but worthless. <br /><br />As for the bulk price of cocaine: It entirely depends on where it is located. A kilogram some the exact same stuff can have a value of $1000 in the country of production, or of $80.000 once it reaches a major us city and is sold by the gram. <br /><br />Without analysis its hard to tell what you have there, but there is no reason why a kilogram of cocaine could not be available for $6000. It would just be silly to sell it at such a low price within the US.
