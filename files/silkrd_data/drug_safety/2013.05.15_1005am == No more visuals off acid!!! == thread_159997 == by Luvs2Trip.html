				I used to do acid quite a lot and i can remember the first few times where amazing, very colorful and full of visuals!

				Yea, you need to dose harder, and less frequently.<br /><br />LSD will always, always , always have visuals. Just clean out real good between doses, and dose like&nbsp; a man, so to speak.<br /><br /><br />Whats your average or high dose mark?

				well back in the day i started of with just one tab and then would take more throughout the night and eventually moved on to taking 2 tabs on my initial dose. As that was acid of the street i don&#039;t really now exactly how much will have been on each tab! <br /><br />This time i started of with one again thinking my tolerance would be back to how it was and it was 200ug, when that didn&#039;t work i did 2 x 200ug but this just made the mind fuck last longer. Its been about a month now since and I&#039;m think I&#039;ve left it enough time between to get some more but I&#039;m thinking 3 x 200ug or maybe even 4?

				i recommend not bothering with the double dosing, just go all in from the start. all you&#039;ll do by taking more later is make the trip last longer, not intensify it. personally i take up to 6 in one go for a proper trip.

				I find that through experience, you can either take the time to enjoy visuals, or ignore them completely.<br />Even on higher doses I tend to be able to read and function mostly normally if I have to, and don&#039;t get much visually unless I concentrate on what I&#039;m looking at.&nbsp; Last weekend I even had a 2 hour nap about 6 hours into my trip, woke up and kept tripping.<br />&nbsp; <br />I also find that visuals are definitely less pronounced if you keep tripping in the same location.&nbsp; My last trip on JORs liquid I decided to step outside for a walk, and the trip went sideways for a bit. (I dosed a couple drops, then swished the built-in dropper in my mouth so I could leave my dropper in the bottle.&nbsp; THEN I had a drink of water, kicked myself in the ass for ingesting chlorine and had another drop or two).<br /><br />If I hadn&#039;t gone outside I think it would have been my &quot;usual trip.&quot;

This in turns means that you need a lot more of the drug and that the trip will be casual in its outcome.<br /><br />Learn to use LSD (or whatever else) in conjunction with a trance practice/ritual practice; in this way you direct the trip where you want to and the visuals will be even much greater than even a 100x normal dose would give.

Learn from how shamans use them if you want to have the real experiences you can have from them. It is not difficult to learn a simple trance method or to use the drug ritualistically and you will really experience things you never imagined possible if you put a little of effort in it.

Im going to try this the next time im tripping. I did find that the last time i was tripping you have to &quot;embrace &quot; the drug and get into your trip if you know what i mean so to speak in order to really get the most out of it. People that just expect the acid to do all the work usually are new to the whole thing, I made that mistake the first two times because of all the hype around acid. But when i wanted to experience a more in depth visual trip i found i had to focus on certain things etc. <br /><br />really good advice though mate. Thank you

I think that once a month is enough. More frequently and your brain isn&#039;t going to be able to come down properly between trips and you will be in a constant state of very mild tripping.<br /><br />Have you tried different types of SR acid? Have you looked at the LSD Avengers thread and looked for an LSD type that you think suits you? Do you trip outside? This is imperative in my opinion.&nbsp; Do you take any other medication?<br /><br />There are lots of variables and you have to be more specific with your info for others to help.<br /><br /><br />In my experience good acid will always give visuals, although combine it with other drugs, the wrong state of mind etc etc and you won&#039;t be getting what you desire.<br /><br />

I didn&#039;t trip outside that last 2 times no and i don&#039;t take any other medication. <br /><br />Thanks you all for your advice and i will be sure to take what you have said into consideration! I think i may also try a different setting as the last 2 times have been with the same people in the same place!

This will bypass the conscious filter and let you experience again what you experienced before.<br /><br />One of the greatest obstacles to the unconscious is your conscious mind. It is like in optical illusions: your eyes see something but your conscious mind cannot accept the reality of what the eyes see and you end up seeing all another thing altogether.<br /><br />There&#039;s a fine line between directing a trip and blocking it altogether with your conscious mind. Many people that approach hallucinogenics ritualistically will pass by the stage you are in (also if for different motives) until they learn how to balance in that line without passing through one or the other part. In your case you just need a little &quot;boost&quot; from yourself to let the visuals happens again along stopping bothering yourself consciously about this not happening.<br /><br />P.S.: Also be aware of what Pakchoi23 has told you. It is more difficult to have visuals in a background that you know too well (for example your room with full light) and certain substances can block the effect altogether. So be sure you are not taking any medications that can influence the action of LSD and choose a place that you don&#039;t know too well or it is not in full light (so that you can see/not see; this in turns block again your conscious mind to try to rationalize everything and stopping the effect).

				I think people are ignoring the role of biochemical individuality.&nbsp; Your problem is probably rooted within you rather than in external things such as setting and time lapse without tripping.&nbsp; My strongest visuals occurred during my first acid trip (3 tabs), with things wiggling around on ceilings like amoeba and digital matrix-like numbers surfacing on walls.&nbsp; After that, my trips have been pretty much centered on the psychological aspect, with objects often seeming magnified.&nbsp; This applies to even large dosages like 6 tabs.&nbsp; I needed 15 tabs (1.5 MG) to get everything to start waving around like an ocean.&nbsp; Considering you&#039;ve had a long break without tripping, I can safely presume that the problem is internal, like mine.&nbsp; The only thing you can do is step up your dosage until you get where you want to be in terms of visuals.

				Some options:<br /><br />1) Vape some DMT (no LSD needed)<br />2) Try 2C-B (without LSD your first time but you could combine them on a future trip)<br />3) Try another LSD vendor.&nbsp; Maybe get drops from JoR<br />4) Smoke weed when the LSD is in your system.&nbsp; This brings out the visuals for many<br />5) Take a bump of Ketamine when the LSD is in your system<br />6) Meditate or do mental stuff to induce visuals.

				I&#039;m in a similar place with LSD now and interested on working on it this year,<br />i&#039;ve learned &quot;how the shamans do it&quot; (excuse the egotism) and have learned that visuals are often a distraction and unnecessary for the development of consciousness, and I feel that LSD in its clean state opens the conscious to the subconscious. In this way, looking for &quot;visuals&quot; is a strange goal from LSD and may be more appropriate with other chemicals which target those areas specifically.<br /><br />Conversely, I have always been stuck in the head trip ever since my second acid trip, and I&#039;m interested in going back to that state where my first trip was, funny, light, cool, interesting. For that reason I am planning to work with the headtrips until I break through them. My goal is not visuals, but still maintaining the meditative, healing approach to see the headtrips clearly, and to help any pain and anxiety in me.<br /><br />The best reminder I ever got was that the substance is the key which opens the mind. It is you and your soul and your mind that is experiencing itself, and has very little to do with the key - that just helps you in.

				Smoke + Music . My choice is electronic because the bass just makes visuals on its own. Try starting with your eyes closed because closed eye visuals are easier to achieve (at least in my experience) then open your eyes and see whats up. Try looking at something trippy or abstract art. <br /><br />Also, play with the lighting of a room.<br /><br />Now for the advice that everyone is going to freak out about. IF you want, try 25i nbome. Don&#039;t get me wrong, acid is the numero uno but with 25i I almost exclusively have visuals and some of the most insane visuals at that. Don&#039;t hate, just a suggestion.

This in turns means that you need a lot more of the drug and that the trip will be casual in its outcome.<br /><br />Learn to use LSD (or whatever else) in conjunction with a trance practice/ritual practice; in this way you direct the trip where you want to and the visuals will be even much greater than even a 100x normal dose would give. When I talk with people that use hallucinogenics (even DMT) they never experienced something like transmutation (for example turning into a wolf, crow or whatever) or similar things just because they expect the drug to do it all by itself.<br /><br />These substances are means, not the end. Learn from how shamans use them if you want to have the real experiences you can have from them. It is not difficult to learn a simple trance method or to use the drug ritualistically and you will really experience things you never imagined possible if you put a little of effort in it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />These two posts answer your questions in full and provide the solutions. Listen to them.

				Smoking weed always brings out visuals for me on psychedelics. Usually not the wavy visuals but instead the rainbow color patterns. However, I try to avoid smoking weed until the comedown because I don&#039;t like how it clouds my mental state and it tends to make the experience more confusing and less clear.<br /><br />I would say I experience less intense wavy-distortion visuals now that I have done psychedelics many times, however this doesn&#039;t degrade the overall experience for me. As long as a dose gets me thinking and feeling a little silly and I can have some hearty laughs with friends than I am a happy tripper!
