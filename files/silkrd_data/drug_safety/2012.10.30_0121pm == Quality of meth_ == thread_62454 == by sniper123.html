				What are some ways you can determine the quality of meth? Such as crackling patterns, residue left in pipe. I&#039;ve looked all over, and i&#039;m getting a lot of mixed answers. <br /><br />Does anyone know how to tell if MSM is used as a cut? What other things are normally used as a cut? What does MSM do to the lungs when inhaled. (I&#039;m not asking for a medical answer, something simple as the side effects normally felt.)

				It&#039;s pretty damn hard to tell without gauging based on how it makes you feel (even then it&#039;s not so reliable, as I&#039;m sure you know).&nbsp; How long your product stays clear/white, and how little residue is left when the puddle&#039;s all gone is a decent indicator -- but it&#039;s possible the stuff was as pure as snow and not actually cut, just had something left over from the cook is all.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not always a good indicator.<br /><br />Needle-like patterns when it recrystallizes are from one cut or another, or so I&#039;ve gotten the impression.&nbsp; Little pinwheels or spiderwebs seem to be associated with purer stuff -- some of the best I&#039;ve seen recrystallized into almost nothing more than a trail of pinwheels laid right next to eachother.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen at least one person say they think this is misinformation and that the pattern is a result of the amount &amp; duration of heat, and nothing more.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how that can be when the patterns I see from one sack are generally the same, but switching to another product (a moment later I mean) produces a different pattern.&nbsp; Unless I subconsciously heat different bags differently or something...<br /><br />Supposedly you can get a good idea by examining the shards -- apparently a lot of cuts produce slightly different formations, but I&#039;ve never been able to tell, honestly.&nbsp; Things like a raised ridge on a shard are supposed to indicate a sizable cut or something, but again, I&#039;ve never really been able to see much of a pattern in the shards themselves.&nbsp; It does seem reasonable though.<br /><br />The more bitter it tastes, the purer it likely is.&nbsp; That&#039;s a pretty reliable one, but I can never seem to decide if one batch is more bitter than the last one I had -- I can just never remember the exact taste to judge by.<br /><br />You can be more accurate about it and do something like take 50mg, crush it to a powder, do an acetone wash and then once it&#039;s dry as a bone weigh the result.&nbsp; Allow for a small amount of loss because of stray H2O in the acetone, and the rest of the weight that vanished was pure cut.&nbsp; Note that what you&#039;re left with isn&#039;t necessarily pure meth, though, either.&nbsp; You can be sure what you took out was cut though (plus that small amount of meth loss).<br /><br />Part of my problem, personally, is that sometimes the same exact sack will feel differently for me at different times or on different days.&nbsp; I rather doubt the purity varies based on the phase of the moon, though, so taking into account that a given day&#039;s physiology has a lot to do with how good meth seems to be, it&#039;s really difficult to isolate specific traits that indicate purity, ya know.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read MSM causes a cloudy layer to build up on whatever the smoke touches, but... that kind of seems to happen at least a little with all meth I&#039;ve bothered paying attention to.&nbsp; Can&#039;t comment on it, myself.<br /><br />There&#039;s also something or other about dropping a shard in bleach and seeing if it fizzes or some such thing... I never really felt like dropping my meth into bleach or just didn&#039;t have any around, so I&#039;ve never tried that one.&nbsp; Anyway, that&#039;s about all I can think of.&nbsp; Corrections and contrary opinions are welcome, as always.

Karma+1. I greatly appreciate it. I&#039;ve read that MSM is very bitter in taste, so a taste test might be in conclusive. Again, thank you for taking the time to provide that information.
