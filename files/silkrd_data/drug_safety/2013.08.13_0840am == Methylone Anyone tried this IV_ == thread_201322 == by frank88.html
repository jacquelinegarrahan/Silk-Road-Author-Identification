				I used to live with my someone who had a stripper GF who would bang mephedrone and she got some nasty ass sores and would have like 14-20hour shooting sessions banging like 3grams and would be mega zapped out I hazard to guess methylone would be a wee bit milder but would still really twack you out and be crazy &quot;more-ish&quot; like most drugs

All three were charged with one count each of conspiracy to traffic meth. Zechariah faces additional charges, with one count of the manufacture of meth and one count of maintaining a dwelling place for keeping and selling the drug.<br /><br />A search warrant for the case said the Raleigh Police Department became interested in the residence after six suspicious parcels were seized between July 21 and July 23 from a Ship on Site located at 1030-107 Rogers Lane. Inspectors traced the packages to 5500 Creek Crossing Drive in Midlothian, Va., an address registered to Zechariah. The intercepted parcels contained trafficking amounts of meth addressed to various parties throughout the country.<br /><br />Police next obtained a forwarding address, coming up with the Raleigh house. The report said surveillance found Zechariah coming and going from the house, as well as a car with Virginia plates. The car and house are registered to Zina Rambo.<br /><br />Police inspectors and a K-9 unit searched the house Tuesday afternoon after obtaining a search warrant. The record said officers at the scene encountered hazardous chemicals, at which point a drug expert wearing a respirator and protective gloves completed the search. Several as yet unidentified liquids, crystals, powders and plants were seized in the raid. Several Ziploc baggies were found with materials testing positive in the field for meth.<br /><br />All three Rambos appeared at the Wake County Courthouse Wednesday morning. Zechariah&#039;s bond is set at $3 million while the other two men have bond set at $1 million. Their charges concern the alleged trafficking of 400 or more grams of meth, a crime which contains the state&#039;s harshest penalties for trafficking the narcotic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/07/29/603095/warrants-turn-up-more-details.html<br /><br /><br />I also know of some other cases where mephedrone tested positive as methamphetamine by police and US customs.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t sure if I remembered a case of methylone testing positive or not.&nbsp; I know for a fact that methamphetamine tests positive as MDMA on a field test.

Very lackluster, not worth it... then again thats what i think about M1 via any route.&nbsp; Very short lived.

All three were charged with one count each of conspiracy to traffic meth. Zechariah faces additional charges, with one count of the manufacture of meth and one count of maintaining a dwelling place for keeping and selling the drug.<br /><br />A search warrant for the case said the Raleigh Police Department became interested in the residence after six suspicious parcels were seized between July 21 and July 23 from a Ship on Site located at 1030-107 Rogers Lane. Inspectors traced the packages to 5500 Creek Crossing Drive in Midlothian, Va., an address registered to Zechariah. The intercepted parcels contained trafficking amounts of meth addressed to various parties throughout the country.<br /><br />Police next obtained a forwarding address, coming up with the Raleigh house. The report said surveillance found Zechariah coming and going from the house, as well as a car with Virginia plates. The car and house are registered to Zina Rambo.<br /><br />Police inspectors and a K-9 unit searched the house Tuesday afternoon after obtaining a search warrant. The record said officers at the scene encountered hazardous chemicals, at which point a drug expert wearing a respirator and protective gloves completed the search. Several as yet unidentified liquids, crystals, powders and plants were seized in the raid. Several Ziploc baggies were found with materials testing positive in the field for meth.<br /><br />All three Rambos appeared at the Wake County Courthouse Wednesday morning. Zechariah&#039;s bond is set at $3 million while the other two men have bond set at $1 million. Their charges concern the alleged trafficking of 400 or more grams of meth, a crime which contains the state&#039;s harshest penalties for trafficking the narcotic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/07/29/603095/warrants-turn-up-more-details.html<br /><br /><br />I also know of some other cases where mephedrone tested positive as methamphetamine by police and US customs.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t sure if I remembered a case of methylone testing positive or not.&nbsp; I know for a fact that methamphetamine tests positive as MDMA on a field test.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting information, thank you for providing it.<br /><br />I like to go back and see what happened in these cases.&nbsp; I search both the North Carolina and Federal incerceration records and can&#039;t find any of these people locked up in either place.&nbsp; I wish could find out more on what happened.
