				Hello , I know 80% of the coke here is -80%. And street coke is even more shitty.<br />I really dont care if it is cut nicely but I hate it when noobs cut it with speed or caffeine. <br />Is it possible to &#039;wash&#039; you&#039;re cocaine and cut it by yourself later on ? Are you wasting coke then?<br />I do coke like 5-10 times in a year not much. But when I do I want to know whats inside. <br />

				Yes, it is possible to make 100% pure Cocaine HCl if you wanted to. However, simple &quot;washes&quot; don&#039;t magically leave you with pure coke.<br />From my lab experience (I&#039;m a chemistry major) from street coke would be as follows, the route to obtaining pure coke would be as follows:<br /><br />-Test your cocaine in HPLC alongside the whole laundry list of common cuts (caffeine, speed, levamisole, and other inactive compounds as well) to see what you have in your cocaine. You are essentially treating it as an unknown mixture at this point.<br />-Once some of the substances are known, you would have to obtain the proper solvents and perform the proper separation processes one by one to remove each known contaminant.<br />-Once you have your &quot;pure&quot; coke, it still may be impure with contaminants not tested for previously, so a GCMS test along with NMR would need to be performed to find if your coke is actually pure and that you didn&#039;t miss any potential contaminants.<br />-Use the data you obtain to identify, the contaminants, perform the proper separation, test and repeat until you have 100% pure cocaine.<br /><br />This obviously, is extremely time consuming, and the equipment all costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br />In summary, unless you have many hours and have access to analytical chemistry equipment, you can&#039;t obtain pure coke from street coke without hours of effort and chemistry experience.<br /><br />If you really want pure cocaine, buy bulk coca leaves, and perform your own cocaine extraction yourself.<br />The chemistry behind this is a lot more simple, and you will end up with pure cocaine given that you don&#039;t screw up the procedure.<br /><br />In summary, if you want pure coke, make it yourself from scratch.<br />If you buy street coke, you can never be 100% certain what contaminants are in there, so you can&#039;t confirm what you&#039;re sniffing without extensive lab tests.

				okay thanks for the tips!<br />Maybe I need to cut off just the added caffein . I really hate caffeine it makes me nervous as shit.

I really hate caffeine it makes me nervous as shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Keep in mind that caffeine and cocaine are fairly similar in their mp/bp, and are both freely soluble in common solvents (someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong)<br />You would once again, need high quality lab equipment, and perform some type of chromatography in a lab setting to separate the two.<br />In all honesty, caffeine isn&#039;t too concerning of a cut as long as you stick to decent quality coke.<br /><br />Say you have 70% pure coke, and the other 30% is caffeine (other cuts are typically present though, this is a worst case scenario)<br />i.e. for every 100 mg coke you sniff, you ingest 70mg cocaine HCl and 30mg caffeine.<br />For a lighter user like me, this is quite insignificant. I usually stick to 40-50 mg lines, so each line only contains 12-15mg caffeine. <br />This is about as much caffeine as a regular to small size chocolate bar.<br />Over the course of the night, I end up burning through 250mg total coke, which ends up being less caffeine than a bottle of mountain dew.<br /><br />In summary, don&#039;t worry too much about the caffeine. You aren&#039;t getting an appreciable dose unless you take insane amounts (&gt;1g).<br />Stay safe bro.

This may require moving it from alkaloid salt to freebase and back, but that is not an overly complicated process. <br /><br />The problem begins when people start to add cutting agents on purpose that you actually need to get rid off. <br /><br />Something like a cocaine/caffeine mixture could be separated by preparative hplc, but it would be very difficult to separate the two using ordinary equipment like separating funnels and assorted solvents. Worst case scenario you&#039;d have to re-crystallize the cocaine, which is generally a very lossy process to begin with, and is not viable once it has been cut down to less than 50% purity or so (depening on the cutting agent).
