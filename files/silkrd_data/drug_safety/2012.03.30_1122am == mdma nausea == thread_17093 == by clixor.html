				So, i&#039;m quite experienced user (not frequent though) and what i never figured out what actually causes the nausea when consuming m. Too high dose? Also when barfing, won&#039;t you barf out any undigested parts as this usually happens pretty fast after consuming?

				I have a weak stomach so you can imagine the amount of nausea I get from different substances, it sucks. I found the two best things for nausea are pepto bismol caps and ginger root caps.

				I have only used MDMA a few times. But here is my opinion.<br /><br />I think a high dose is the usual cause of nausea but you have to consider other factors such as whether you have eaten well that day. An empty stomach is not the best place to send drugs. For MDA I think you ought to eat very well that day and after a nice dinner around 5.00pm or so its ideal to take your MDA about 8.00pm depending on the nights schedule.<br /><br />Also - consuming alcohol and smoking cannabis can cause nausea on small does of MDMA.<br /><br />I took maybe 70mg a few weeks back. Planned to go out but ended up drinking a few beers and smoking a very strong hash. I felt nausea and hit the sack. Actually almost crawled to bed.<br /><br />The dose for MDMA varies from person to person. <br /><br />I would say MDMA is a very powerful drug and anyone using ought to weigh out the amount they need bearing in mind that any redose ought to be 30% of the original dose. <br /><br />We have some great MDMA here in crystal form which is the best really as you can take an accurate dose. With pills we can see variations of MDMA content from pill to pill. One good seller has 180mg to 220mg of MDMA for example. Half or even quarter of that pill is good for a first timer.<br /><br />I think some take way too much MDMA. My top dose has been 80mg and that was great. Could have used more but looked at my pupils 2 hour later and thought &#039;I am good here&#039;. <br /><br />Some reports in the MDMA quality thread indicate nausea and the chaps who do actually vomit have taken a bit too much.<br /><br />In my book vomiting is not part of any ritual for my night out.<br /><br />Less is more with many drugs. <br /><br />And always leave a month or so between nights out or in on MDMA. Bear in mind serotonin in the brain is all we actually have. When depleted we have to wait till it produces more. <br /><br />Millions have a fantastic time on this drug. The ones who do not are either being ripped off with something that is not MDMA.<br /><br />As with any drug I think you ought to try a very small amount before going for the real dose. People may have low tolerance for MDMA as with any drug. <br /><br />Always keep a careful eye on friends who might be using. Make sure they drink enough and make sure they are safe with respects to members of the opposite sex.
