				I just got a g from Kara recently too, it&#039;s very good stuff. This is actually my first experience with K as well.<br /><br />I was apprehensive about it too so I started small, and it was kind of like being drunk with less nausea, it was alright but it didn&#039;t seem to be for me. I tried a slightly larger amount two days later with the same results.<br /><br />This morning after coming down from a particularly scary mushroom trip I figured since I survived that I am ready for anything, so I did two huge fucking lines.<br /><br />My trip basically came back to me, only I couldn&#039;t move at all. I somehow convinced myself 100% that I was a vampire. I spent the next hour or so twitching around retracting and drawing my fangs that I completely believed I had and saying &quot;vampire....vampire&quot;<br /><br />Weirdest fucking morning of my life, but a whole lot of fun. My advice is to start small just to quell your fears about it, and then go big. It&#039;s not a scary drug at all, and if you are worried about snorting it, don&#039;t be. It doesn&#039;t burn one bit and if you cut it up nicely it won&#039;t even leave you with a stuffy nose

				Yeah these last 17 hours or so have been pretty fucked up. During my mushroom trip I had my first experience with the &quot;demons&quot; that people are always talking about, who basically laughed at me whilst I lost my damn mind. After that whole ordeal I find out that I&#039;m a vampire. Go figure

				imo there are 2 important things about K: <br /><br />- don&#039;t be afraid, if you hit the hole, and at the beginning it is quite easy, roll along, it doesn&#039;t take long anyway<br /><br />- tolerance build up is extremely fast, don&#039;t judge your next few K experiences by the first<br /><br /><br />Please report back how it was for you, K seems to have widely different effects on different people

				Start small. A high enough dose will definitely put you in another universe. Pretend that you have never smoked weed or drank alcohol before. Now, with this in mind, imagine taking ten large bong rips of top shelf weed and following that up with ten shots of whiskey. This is what a heavy K trip, or K hole, feels like.<br /><br />My first experience with K involved a small ~10 mg bump and a quite interesting, yet slightly dysphoric experience which resembled being slightly buzzed and slightly stoned at the same time. It was quite enjoyable. A few days later I became cocky and took a fat ~100 mg line. This was a very bad idea to say the least. Within fifteen minutes of taking that line, I had the worst nausea of my life, my whole room was spinning like a gyroscope, and every time I closed my eyes I had a new dream. It was an interesting experience that I never wish to repeat.<br /><br />Here are some tips for you:<br /><br />- Crush the crystals up into a fine powder using a blunt metal object such as a scale weight or the rounded handle of a butter knife. Your schnoz will thank you.<br />- Start with a small bump. Do not dive into lines unless you love gyroscopes.<br />- Be aware that nausea is a very common side effect. For this reason, I would avoid eating at least two hours prior to ingestion.<br />- If you get sucked into a K hole like I did, keep telling yourself that it will be over soon. This should not happen if you take my second tip and start small.<br /><br />Have fun!

				The thing is it depends what your looking for reallY. If u want the diss associative effect jst take a 50mg line and redose as and when. If your after psychedelic madness just head straight for the hole. I started with small bumps and found it difficult to hole by the end of my use due to tolerance.

				For me, everything I experience isn&#039;t real. To explain; last time I took Ketamine, I had a pretty heavy doses (two BIG lines) and I experienced temperatures that don&#039;t exist. Like, in real life, we have cold, normal, warm, hot, etc. but during the trip, there were different kinds of temperatures that don&#039;t exist in the real world. If the temperatures we had in real life were colours, with cold being blue and red being hot, the temperatures I experienced were yellow and green.<br /><br />Hard to explain. It&#039;s kind of something you just need to experience yourself to understand. Just make sure you do it safely and you&#039;ll have a great time&nbsp; :)

				My favorite drug :)<br /><br />People can react differently to it I&#039;d say start off small don&#039;t dive in at the deep end or it could just put you off it. <br /><br />Hope you enjoy your experience!

Was really fun to feel myself rise up in the air with my eyes closed to the point where I feel like I&#039;m millimeters from my bedroom ceiling&nbsp; and actually open my eyes to double check I&#039;m not really floating haha. After using MXE though the next day I&#039;d feel dreadful.. felt really mongy and felt incapable of interaction with other people.. this is one of the main reasons why I haven&#039;t used it recently. But I would use it again for them CEV&#039;s :)<br /><br />I&#039;d say ketamine is a very relaxing and spiritual drug.. I&#039;m confident you&#039;ll have a much better time on ketamine than methoxetamine, just start off with a small dose then keep bumping with other small doses.. as jumping in with a massive fuck off line will just put you off it.. My first experience with ketamine was with 2 friends and they were quite mashed off it and I wasn&#039;t really feeling much so I thought fuck this and made up a considerably big line and hoofed it.. 5 or 10 minutes later bang I was ruined.. the couch was floating up an down and the room felt like it wasn&#039;t real.. I didn&#039;t enjoy this and decided not to take ketamine for quite a while but I did in the end and I enjoyed it because I used it responsibly.. like slybootz said &quot;respect the drug and it will respect you&quot; this is very true I&#039;ve found!<br />&nbsp;

				It&#039;s an adventure, exploring the world from the comfort and safety of your brain.<br />Squiggles and giggles.<br />I saw a volcano erupt from above the world and thought about it&#039;s usefulness, volcanic ashes remineralizing the soils, destruction and renewal. <br />&nbsp;I toured the world&#039;s suffering and arrived home with no room left in my heart for my own afflictions, just an overwhelming sense of peace and love.<br />&nbsp;Imagine your head laying on the surface of reality, dissociative push you backwards through the layers, and eventually below the layer where nothing is familiar. <br />You&#039;re a baby again. <br />Sense free thinking. <br />No sense, no feeling, an eternal being floating through space time.<br />Imagine a tree growing, devoid of background, whiteness nothingness<br />&nbsp;and the tree just continues, it&#039;s branches reaching up up up into space &amp;time. <br />Then<br />coming down...<br />I connected with loved ones in dreams, feeling their thoughts. Being in their minds, thinking out solutions they&#039;ve been unaware of.<br />It&#039;s all done through flashbacks<br />Reading their body language as memories rewind<br />...strange and beautiful.

Certain types of liquid ketamine once cooked will produce powder or crystal depending on the brand etc. I&#039;m only able to get crystal ketamine from SR and the crystal I get here is much more potent than the powder, saying this.. the powder is still very good :)
