				I hear that in a sense xanax can slow down the part of your brain called The GABA,<br /><br />CLEARNET&gt; http://www.erowid.org/pharms/benzodiazepine/benzodiazepine_info1.pdf<br /><br />Meanwhile the newest nootropic Noopept supposedly helps your GABA in some way. <br /><br />&quot;So if Noopept has an inhibitory effect on the CA1 pyramidal cells that could mean, that Noopept releases GABA in some parts of the hippocampus, since the CA1 cells use GABA for inhibition and Glutamate for exhibition. From my humble humble pharmacological knowledge that would explain the anxiolytic effect of Noopept&quot; <br /><br />CLEARNET&gt; http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/53815-noopept-effects-on-brain/<br /><br />My dad iS having horrible withdraws after getting in my xanx powder TOO HEAVILY&nbsp; :&#039;( I&#039;m pretty sure I can help him by giving him Noopept, am I wrong?<br />Thanks any community input would be appreciated. YOUR HELPING MY DAD&nbsp; :D

				I don&#039;t think noopept would help for benzo withdrawals, I&#039;d rather go with something like pehnibut or gapapentin/pregabalin.

				I&#039;ve had personal results with taking xanax and then recovering with noopept, and then feeling better later on in the day or the next day after taking noopept. It&#039;s as though it undoes alot of the damage by being so neuroprotective in the part of the brain that alprazolam (xanax) affects. <br /><br />Just a theory still.<br /><br />I&#039;d love more input from the community as their is still limited information about noopept, especially noopepts help with xanax withdraw/comedown<br /><br />THANKS

				You may be right about noopept protecting you from neurological damage but I don&#039;t know if it would be enough if you&#039;re having strong benzo withdrawals.. I don&#039;t really know though.
