				I just posted this link in another topic and thought more people should know, where i live bong shops sell 0.01 resolution scales for $50+ and 0.001 (mg) for $130+ and this may have made people not buy scales but these ones are so cheap, i have these exact ones and they work excellently. <br /><br />Any drug user should have their own scales, from knowing if your getting shorted on Gs of weed to the fact that &#039;eyeing&#039; out doses of certain drugs is borderline retarded<br /><br />http://www.dealextreme.com/p/digital-precision-scale-20g-max-0-001g-resolution-10515&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - clearweb

				Are you sure these are accurate scales?<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that accurate 0.001s would be available for just $20. They&#039;re usually AT LEAST 5x that

				with all due respect - the real dumb thing to do here would be using such a cheap scale with the intention to actually determine such small amounts accurately. <br /><br />plenty of substances which have undeniable activity in the one digit milligram range often share the property of having very nasty results if just 0.5-2mg more than intended or is taken. such cheap .001 scales, depending on the circumstances they are used in, are up to 10mg off the actual weight. with substances like AM-2201 or phenazepam this can end with a full-on seizure like state or a week of not remembering what happened. with DOx or NBOMe-compounds it can cause strong discomfort and effects that last well over 20 hours. with 2-dpmp it can make a difference between having a somewhat enhanced concentration for 12 hours and being unable to get any sleep for 72 or more hours. to name just a few. the list goes on. <br /><br />scales with reliable results in the .001 range _must_ come with the following features or will be a possible major health hazard;<br /><br />1.an AC power supply. batteries deliver inaccurate results in that range. unless youre a little macgyver and know how to solder a power plug to the battery slot, prepare to have to use expensive brand name batteries and change them after each single use to get the actual weight, and not something thats +-5mg off.<br /><br />2. a built-in water level and/or height-adjustable feet. the slightest tilt may deliver inaccurate results.<br /><br />3. a cover to prohibit any air flow altering the results even further. this is usually the only thing cheapo china scales come with.<br /><br />there is simply no such product in a price range under 100 dollars.&nbsp; if dont want to spend 100 dollars or more on a scale, use liquid measurement where its possible/necessary - most strong phenethylamines are very soluble in isopropanol and will not lose potency. vendors offering other substances with potencies requiring such accurate determination of dosage usually also carry a&nbsp; solvent suitable for creating a proper solution. the stronger synthetic indole cannabinoids are best avoided at all by people without enough confidence to eyeball (which is actually safer in that area than relying in a cheap milligram scale) and cannabis tolerance to begin with.<br /><br />if you want a scale and only spend 20-30 dollars on it, rather get a .01-model and only use if for substances without steep dose-respone-curves and start getting active in +10mg amounts. <br /><br />please do not make the mistake of buying such cheap rubbish and relying on it for figuring out the right dosage for anything that is active in amounts well under 10mg. you will put yourself and possibly others at great danger.<br /><br />ps: all information concluded in this post on the accuracy&nbsp; milligram scales was determined by comparing results between no-name battery powered models in the 20-60usd price range and an &quot;American Weigh MiniPRO50&quot; on various compounds.&nbsp;

				with all due respect i have these exact ones, knowing that it is cheap and from china i tested it against&nbsp; friends, brought locally for $180, 100% perfectly the same on weights like 3 or 7 mg and also on 10.003 grams (calibration weight). and anyway even if they were to be a little inaccurate its still a lot better then using a 0.01 scale and a fuckload better then eyeing for things active in 10-50 mg range that you really wanna get right.. dmt and heroin come to mind<br /><br />edit: after rereading your post, id agree these are obviously not good enough for weighing out pure LSD or fentanyl for diluting or the like but for even your more adventurous drug user they are perfectly sufficient

				Also one thing to consider, how long can it last?<br /><br />Cheap products; the spring or sensor might be worn down faster than the higher priced I presume, though both can be accurate at first.
