				I&#039;ve noticed that when I take lsd, I need to pee FAR more often than I ordinarily would.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a little bit about how this can be fairly common, but not found much info on how to combat it. Aside from the obvious answer of drinking less. <br />Even if I&#039;ve not drunk a lot of liquid on the day I trip, I still need to pee like every 15 minutes. <br /><br />It&#039;s really starting to put me off LSD altogether.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

				I suffer from the same thing. I pee frequently and a LOT when tripping. I don&#039;t mind it too much though, because it feels so fucking good to let it all out. Sorry I don&#039;t have any advice, but know you are not alone.

				I&#039;ve stopped taking shrooms for the same reason.&nbsp; I usually have to pee every 10-15 minutes.&nbsp; We&#039;re talking &quot;I have to pee right the fuck now&quot; 30seconds+ piss.&nbsp; Really hard to fall into a trip that way.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any problems with LSD.&nbsp; &nbsp;Try switching it up?&nbsp; You might find shrooms are easier on you, as I found LSD to be on me.

				Perhaps the body is trying to remove toxins that it detects are present as a result of talking the chemical.<br /><br />I also find that I have to pee somewhat often, but generally during a trip I don&#039;t register that my discomfort is that I have to pee. I will feel uncomfortable at times and don&#039;t know why and then suddenly realize it&#039;s because I have to pee.

				Perhaps you are drinking more water than usual. When I take LSD, I find the sensation of drinking water extremely satisfying and thus end up drinking way more than usual.<br />

				Happens to me as well (and i thought i was the only one) but the toxin theory sounds plausible except for the obvious fact that LSD is not toxic.<br /><br />It has hardly turned me away from LSD though, I think the only thing that could make me stop using that would be a really unpleasant trip.<br /><br />-JOS

				I pretty much have the opposite when tripping, I need to pee but I hold it for hours, not even noticing how much time is passing

				Same here op, this made me stop taking LSD at parties (except nature parties because taking a wee is easier there) and only do it inside my own house. Id love to hear a solution because tripping at a concert is fun!

				MDMA makes it impossible for me to pee, also heard it&#039;s a good combo with LSD&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />----Off Topic----<br />Also FartBomber, you&#039;re on my to-buy list amongst other items. Never tried LSD yet, just resold some in the past. Which of your blotters do you recommend for first timer and how many?

				LSD has mild diuretic properties. For comparison, alcohol has strong diuretic effects. I don&#039;t have any suggestions on mitigating this, sorry!

The print of the blotter doesnt matter, you can always cut a tab in several pieces to get the correct dose but if you want things to be easy take either a Gandalf or Fat Freddie. PM me on SR if you want more info!

I hate shitting to begin with(such a waste of time!), I would hate all the places my mind would go if I was ever taking a dump on a trip. <br /><br />I&#039;ve always felt my pees to be longer on psychedelics, so I started timing them. It turns out that, most of the time, the added length is an illusion of the trip. It&#039;s pretty interesting. You can rest assured that, most of the time, you are not wasting precious LSD by having a few pees. <br /><br />A substance doesn&#039;t have to be toxic in order to be a diuretic. It could be as simple as inhibiting the release of vasopressin (a hormone that functions to retain water and increase blood pressure; inhibited even by drinking water).
