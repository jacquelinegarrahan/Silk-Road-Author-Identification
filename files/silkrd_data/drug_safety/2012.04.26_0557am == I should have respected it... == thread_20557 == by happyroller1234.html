				It&#039;s irresponsible use like this that causes drugs to be illegal in the first place, seriously what were you thinking?<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m sure you know what you did is stupid so I&#039;m not going to scold you any further. There&#039;s not much known about 25i-NBOMe as it&#039;s relatively new, but I would guess you&#039;re just burnt out from drug use. Take a break from everything, and yes I mean a break from bud too, and hopefully you&#039;ll return to normal within a month. Another bit of advice I would share is space out your drug use. I wait at least two weeks in between my trips and always feel fine, but I mix things up so often that I never feel too burnt out on any single drug at all. Try just taking shrooms one weekend, then roll on the next, followed by LSD on the weekend after and so on and so forth.<br /><br />The best suggestion I can think of is to get proper sleep and take some daily vitamins because your body needs to recover after extended drug use like that. Your brain must be exhausted and might not be back to 100% yet, so these weird side effects and visual distortions are probably thanks to depleted serotonin in the brain or something along those lines. It&#039;s possible that the effects could be permanent, the only way to know for sure is if you follow through on my advice and stay away from everything. Let&#039;s say you feel back to your old self after a week or two, well it&#039;s probably okay to continue experimenting at that point. Either way, permanent or not, I hope you feel better soon because drug hangovers can be a bitch. ;)

				You need to take 30 days to detox, cut off the drugs COMPLETELY, seriously. I had a drug induced psychosis once and I had to be hospitalized because I thought I was becoming a schizo and I googled the crap out of my symptoms to the point where I had to drive myself to the ER while having the worst anxiety attack. After that I cut off psychedelics but decided weed wouldn&#039;t harm me, wrong. I took a hit of my bong and was shot back into my bad trip as if I took a bunch of tabs, it was horrible! Anyway, what I did was cut off all drugs for 30 days and did nothing but exercise and eat healthy (lots of fruits and veggies). I also started taking a lot of vitamins to detox my body, I&#039;m now back to normal and better than ever&nbsp; ;). Although ironically I quit smoking weed but still love my psychs. In the end I realized that drugs are awesome when you space them out, if you become a weekend warrior than you&#039;re just ruining the whole point in doing drugs.

				Well, what a adventure.You probably got some HPPD from the 25i (very common), combined with MDMA&#039;s famous &quot;blue tuesday&quot; effect. Here&#039;s what you want to do:<br /><br />a) NO DRUGS for a month. That includes weed. Feel free to get your daily fix of caffeine, though.<br />b) Eat chocolate. It has L-Tryptophan, which will help to balance your serotonin levels.<br />c) Exercise a lot and drink a lot of water, to help flush out your body.<br />d) Prefer light foods over heavy foods. Fucked up serotonin also affects your intestines, so give them a vacation with some easier-to-digest meals for at least the first two weeks.<br /><br />After a month or so, you should be back to baseline.

				a specific 5ht2a agonist is going to be much less stressful, even over repeated use than that whopping dose of methylenedioxymethamphetamine... which is actually neurotoxic and will cause long term changes in neurochemistry compared to psychedelics which may lead to desensitization but not depletion and oxidative damage. <br /><br />you felt fine after dose after dose of nbome... then you take 500 mg of mdma (or at least 250) and the next day you feel like shit, but obviously it couldnt be from the mdma but has to be from the drug you have previously felt fine after taking.<br /><br />i bet you were smoking with the nbome, and since those neural circuits were active together they have a higher probability of being excited when you smoke and similar to hppd activation results in strengthening of the synapse and increased activity... so it just takes some time not tripping for these cortical paths to cool down in a way

				Thank you everyone for the advice.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done something this stupid before...&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; I already work out quite often, but I will try to be at the gym even more, eat better, and I will definitely get some 5-HTP and chocolate.&nbsp; Also, I have eggs and orange juice for pretty much every breakfast.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; But, damn, I just got a sample of MDMA that I&#039;m supposed to test out.&nbsp; I hope the guy will be understanding that I may need to put it off a month or so.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to cut out the weed and all other psychoactives for a bit and I&#039;ll post my results.&nbsp; And I&#039;m definitely going to stay away from 25i for a long time, if not forever.

I ran into similar problems with 2c-i a while back, and when I kept smoking the effects stayed around for almost 3 months. I had to give up everything completely for 2 months in order for it all to go away. I would say really the most important things are to get a good, balanced diet and to make sure you don&#039;t take any more drugs because they will compound the HPPD. It&#039;s very unlikely that you&#039;ve caused permanent damage; your brain just needs a break.

				Hey happy, like others have said you&#039;re gonna be fine as long as you let your serotonin levels get back to normal. Definitely don&#039;t eat that molly for a month after some serious anti oxidant and 5htp therapy.&nbsp; Doing that much in that little time isn&#039;t smart but i&#039;ve done similar things.&nbsp; Be especially cautious with new RC&#039;s....several years back I ended up with a whole bunch of 2ci and 2ce and loved em both so much I was doing them a couple times a week.&nbsp; Then festival season came around and those ended up usually being 3 or 4 nights of heavy psychedelic use.&nbsp; After a while I noticed I saw tracers a lot even days after I had dosed and in general my paranoia had escalated to new highs..it was very unpleasant to say the least..like Delta 11 said even when i smoked some herb it was like i&#039;d have flash backs and felt hyper vigilant and extreme paranoia.&nbsp; A little time off to let the brain re-heal and get back to homeostasis is the best thing you can do right now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the damage is permanent just take this as a warning and...respect ja molecules.<br /><br />peace

I honestly think you&#039;ll be alright though, I&#039;ve had plenty scares myself where I was convinced I had screwed myself up permanently off all sorts of drugs, individually and combined.

				Ya 25-i is a nice trip but be very careful with it. Its a new compound and we dont know very much about it at all. I did 25-i i think 3-4 days in a row and then when I woke up one morning both my thighs where completely numb...like I mean comletely. And since then my right thigh goes completely numb randomly usually when im standing in one spot longer....i dunno if its the 25-i causing that but it happened right after my use and this never happend before. I also read somewhere that 25-i causes vasoconstriction so it could be because of that but the symptoms have lasted far longer than id thin it takes for blood vessels to relax. Its not really a big deal(I hope) and im not 100% sure its the 25-i but just be careful

				^To the brother above<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend doing some squats and shit and running, I would at least. Get some blood flowing to that area man. Makes sense since the vasocon-whateverthefuck it&#039;s called; hinting that the blood vessel have narrowed dramatically. Clearly it&#039;s caused by the 25i since it was only triggered after consecutive trips. So get some blood pumpin! Thats my broke ass .02 on the matter :D

				I had something similar happen. Bought a shit ton of different 2c&#039;s and since none of my friends had heard of them everytime I wanted to sell to someone new I felt obligated to dose with them. This last time I did 2ce that weird body high you get in your chest just never went away and my brain just didn&#039;t seem like it was functioning the same. I started drinking more water, took a break from psychadelics (besides dmt), and started taking a 5htp vitamin thats got l-tyrosine and some others in it and it has helped drastically. Just take a break from everything but weed and you will come back. Sounds like you have a mild case of HPPD and I had a friend who actually got diagnosed with it after taking acid his first time and never really coming down proper. Took him about a year to feel totally normal again but I think he was just uncomfortable having his mind opened that much if that makes since

				Some of you guys are getting really irresponsible, especially when working with research chemicals. OD sometimes causes brain bleeding, so who knows what the long term effects are when the short term effects include coma and death.<br /><br />&quot;25i-NBOme is active in the microgram range so with that being said the children that are using this substance by smoking or snorting it is highly dangerous since its highly improbable that they had access to proper tools to scale out the drug. It&#039;s not so much the case of &quot;It&#039;s extremely dangerous&quot; compound it&#039;s more so negligent kids thinking if something is legal its safe no matter what. 1mg of 25i equates to 250 ug LSD trip IMO and these kids did lines of it meaning they must of taken appox. 50mg at the least which if the line is linear it would equate to 12500 ug of LSD which is well above the LD50 of LSD. All in all you can overdose on anything and children shouldn&#039;t be using these substances not because they are the anti-christ but because they don&#039;t know how to properly dose or conduct research with these newly developed chemicals. &quot;<br /><br />http://www.nbc12.com/story/16964534/kids-overdosing-on-new-drug<br /><br />My suggestion would be to take some neurotrophic vitamins a la what Tryptamine is offering, at the very worst they can&#039;t be bad for you, and at the very best they might just work at helping your body recover. Stay off the unknown research chemicals man, at least until more research is conducted into their physiological effects. your livelihood&#039;s not worth the risk, in my opinion

I went to a friend&#039;s lakehouse and had a horrible trip inadvertently off just two hits, apparently triple dipped and 300mcg each or whatever they said to market it, but i went comatose for a bit (ie 10-20 min), vomited at some point, started spewing out random numbers and letters. I lost my mind and myself on it..it was like I was stuck in a logic thought loop that cognitively I could not get out, and until recently I really don&#039;t feel back at my peak. It sucks, but I had to wrap my head around how imprinted that experience was on my psyche. It wasn&#039;t until a year later I went back to the lakehouse and did shrooms that I fell back into that thought loop and my friends got me out of it. thank god, I rarely tripped since that first time at the lakehouse until then, and I just started becoming a new me again. idk, c&#039;est la vie

				from what I have head, probably bullshit. The only person to od on lsd was some guy who mixed up a bag or got sold a bag someone mixed up that was supposed to be good shard meth and it was actually lsd crystal. This was back in the 70&#039;s supposedly but he supposedly shot up like 10,000 hits worth of acid or something crazy and died. Not saying it&#039;s a fact, it&#039;s just a myth I have heard multiple times in multiple states.

				It&#039;s been 12 days since I&#039;ve taken NBOMe and 11 since I&#039;ve taken anything psychedelic, or anything besides pot, for that matter.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been taking 5-HTP, working out, trying to eat better, and getting good sleep, but the visuals are still slightly there.&nbsp; I can sometimes see trails of objects in motion, and am convinced I have been seeing floaters.&nbsp; The weird eye thing that happens when I look in the mirror still happens sometimes, too.&nbsp; These things aren&#039;t that bad when I&#039;m not smoking, although I still believe there is a discernible difference in my vision since abusing psychs even while sober.&nbsp; I may need to really lay off the weed to see if it helps.&nbsp; It would suck if smoking weed were ruined for me.&nbsp; :-\

				Just relax...it may be hard to do but you have to stop constantly stressing about it man...give it some time..its been 11 days dude that isn&#039;t very long at all.&nbsp; When I was noticing tracers and other slight visual distortions it went on for at least 2 or 3 months.&nbsp; That was a few years ago and I can&#039;t remember the last time it happened.&nbsp; I think stressing about this is only making it worse and possibly making the visual distortions manifest themselves purely from your strong belief that they&#039;re real.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you have to stop smoking although if getting high is causing you stress while you&#039;re stoned then maybe you should lay off for a bit.&nbsp; I&#039;d also suggest, if you&#039;re not already taking one, a multivitamin or maybe even ordering something from tryptamine.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t something that&#039;s going to be permanent but it&#039;s also not going to disappear in under two weeks.&nbsp; Give it a month or two before you start worring.<br />You&#039;re going to be ok<br />Good luck.<br />Peace
