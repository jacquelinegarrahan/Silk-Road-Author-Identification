				I&#039;ve taken M1 many times before, I&#039;m very familiar with it. From what I&#039;ve read here on the forums, most folks seem to go with up to 300mg a dose, I keep it much lower; around 75-110mg. Usually the M1 I get a hold of is in crystal form, but recently I&#039;ve purchased it in powder form. I&#039;m very careful about every new purchase I make, even if it&#039;s from the same vendor, and I use a scale. Anyway, this powdered form made my heart rate go up way more than I&#039;ve ever experienced on M1 or MDMA, and I could feel my circulation tighten up as well.&nbsp; All of this was under 150mg, I started with 75mg and about an hour later I took another 75mg.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that it&#039;s adulterated with something else or just a bad product, I&#039;ve never experienced that unpleasant increase in my heart rate or the tightening of my circulation system before, and I tossed the stuff out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have any of you experienced this too?

				Could have just been a panic attack. When you start questioning if what you took is what you thought you can become obsessed and freak out. Of course it is possible that it was some other stimulant.

				No, it definitely wasn&#039;t a panic attack. My heart was racing up to 110bpm which is well beyond normal for my height and weight and the most I was doing was sitting and listening to music. I&#039;ve heard of MDMA being cut with stimulants, and if that&#039;s why the M1 (bk-MDMA) I had was cut with something nasty that&#039;s not methylone and if that&#039;s why it was sold powdered and not crystal. I&#039;m thinking I should stick to crystal M1 from here on out.

				I should note that this has happened more than once with the same powdered batch from the same supplier, and not a one-time thing that I&#039;m concerned about.

				are you on any medication or did you take anything or eat anything unusual that day? combining serotonergic substances with an MAOI can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure....

				maybe it was MDPV which is a stimulant and gives off a yellow result with marquis reagent just like methylone does...
