				I&#039;ve done shrooms before, 2C-B and MDMA. Dunno if that helps any, but I was wondering how much I should take my first time. Two tabs mayhaps?

				I would say 700mcg is a good start, maybe 1000mcg if your bigger. <br /><br />If you use too much NBOME you will not get good visuals for a long time, 1-2 months. <br /><br />You can always do it again, just start low, people have been known to OD easily on this stuff

				I recommend starting at 500ug. (One of kwiktrip&#039;s tabs.) Also, i noticed no one else has mentioned the potential for vasoconstriction. If you get where you can&#039;t breathe. Taking a anti histamine has proven to help for me. Benydryl is the most common. You shouldn&#039;t have to take over the recommended dose but on high trips i have had to take two benydryls.

				8 hits? No offense OP but are you stupid? I sell this shit and when I do it I rarely do more than 1mg. It&#039;s powerful shit. <br /><br />Clearly whoever sold you the tabs sold you bum hits or just very weak ones but come on...8 hits and then 2C-B? Smacks of a death wish to me. Completely stupid.

				So if you took 8 500 ug tabs. That puts you at 4mg. (That&#039;s hoping for the best and they are not 1mg tabs.) The highest i have ever seen someone take personally was 1.5mg. Those were spread out through the course 12 hours. But, if you took them all after each other like that and then some 2cb? I recommend that you seek medical attention immediately. The media would love something like this, but not as much as they would love a death. I hope that you are ok and do seek some form of help. I have done nbome multiple times and found it to be too vasoconstricting for the effects. So i could only imagine a high dose like that would do. I wish you the best and will be praying for you. I&#039;m hoping this is just a troll.

				What the fuck? All these dose discrepancies are really started to turn me off on the whole NBOMe series. DudeRugs vendor page says he has taken 8mg intranasally which is equal to 13-15mg buccally and had the best trip of his life. I thought 1mg bucally was pretty weak, and 2mg was just ok. 4mg was the best trip I have had so far, and was planning on going higher next time. Yet people here say 1.5mg is the most they&#039;ve ever seen anyone take, and others say 4mg had them blacking out and in terrible condition?<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty concerned now. I was planning on buying a sheet of this stuff... Do I just have weak tabs? If I buy from another vendor will I end up in the hospital from taking the same dosage? <br /><br />4-5mg lethal dose?? Looks like I&#039;ll be sticking to LSD from now on....

				I have had 0 issues with vasoconstriction in 4 trips so far, nor have those I&#039;ve shared with, in the case of 25i. <br /><br />Can someone provide a source for the issue of vasoconstriction? A legit source, not anecdotal evidence from a trip report. I&#039;ve see this claim thrown around frequently but nobody ever posts evidence.<br /><br />My experience with 25i has been nothing short of glowing, though somewhat unpredictable in terms of dosage. For example:<br />A friend and myself dosed at 1.6 mg and for me this was the most visually intense trip I&#039;ve ever experienced. It was the perfect experience imo. <br /><br />2 days later, we tripped again at 3.6 mg. He tripped harder than before, while I barely tripped. <br /><br />This could be due to the nature of the compound or inconsistencies in&nbsp; blotter laying. I believe it has&nbsp; more to do with the later, which may be trickier than LSD based on the low solubility of NBOMEs/large volume of liquid required.

Before this experience, I had done 25I-NBOMe (complexed blotter) 2 times, at 500ug and 750ug. Both times I did it at day and I really enjoyed it. I wanted to take it to the next level, so I ordered some 550ug complexed blotters for me and a friend of mine who tripped with me.<br /><br />We planned to sleep at his house and take the blotters around 1AM, tripping at night. He had never done 25I-NBOMe. We decided that he would take 2 blotters (1100ug) and I would take 3 (1650ug). I wanted to have a mind blowing experience. There were 4 other friends with us.<br />I arrived at his house and after a while he said he didn’t want the other people to know we were doing 25I. I don’t know why he was like that. So we had to trip in the same room the others were sleeping in. I didn’t really like the idea, but I agreed since I was in his house and I wanted to trip. Big mistake.<br /><br />We smoked some weed around midnight and we put the blotters between the upper lip and gum. We turned off the lights to enjoy the weed effects. I was feeling good and relaxed. Usually it would take 2 hours for the 25I to come up fully, but after half an hour I was already fucked. It was hard to change the music on my MP3 player and I couldn’t understand what other people were saying. The ceiling was covered with beautiful patterns and fractals. At T+1:00 we turned on the lights to get ready to sleep. What I saw shocked me. Everything was breathing, morphing, the walls were moving. There were fractals all over the carpet and it was rippling. My vision looked like a tunnel. My friends’ faces were melting. It felt like a psychedelic brick to the stomach. I took my earphones off because the music (progressive house/trance/psytrance mixes) was making the experience overwhelming. I wasn’t able to shut down the MP3 player tough. I just couldn’t understand how it worked. I started to feel anxious and I stepped outside to get some air. It calmed me down a bit. I went back into the room and laid down. We turned off the lights so the other people could sleep.<br /><br />This is when it went crazy. I can’t give a precise timeline, I was traveling in time. My friends were talking before sleeping, but I pretended to sleep because I didn’t want them to ask me something. I was just too fucked up. I went to another world. At first it was cool. I was tripping really hard. But around T+2:00 things got a bit too intense. I was having OBEs which lasted some minutes, then I would fall back in my body and I was sure that I “woke up” in another position (in the morning I discovered I didn’t move at all). My friend were still talking and my closed-eye world started mixing with the real world. It got scary. I couldn’t distinguish between the two. I was sure I was in a sort of psychedelic coma and that I couldn’t wake up until the 25I came down. I thought I was hitting my friends every time I woke up. Their voices were distorted and echoed, and I was convinced that my friend called his parents because they couldn’t stop me, and that they called an ambulance. My friend started playing with a flashlight and I was sure he was a doctor checking me.<br /><br />I tried to sleep, and I fell in a sort of lucid sleep. I started hearing voices. I thought the voices were people talking in the ambulance. Then I realized that it was nearly impossible that my friends called an ambulance and I calmed down a bit. The voices sounded like a children jingle. I don’t remember them exactly, but I was sure I had already heard them in other dreams. I felt like time was looping. Every time someone said a certain word, I thought I traveled back in time to when they first said it. And it was looping faster, and faster, and faster. Every loop changed my perception of reality. I was convinced that I was leaving this world and that it was ending. Then I realized that I would begin a new life and this calmed me. Time looped even faster, then it stopped. I was trapped into another world and the jingle changed. I saw entities made of rock. I was sure my existence on this planet had ended, and I was waiting my rebirth. Those entities gave me a bad feeling, I wasn’t feeling comfortable with them. Sometimes I would open my eyes hoping to see something familiar, but I couldn’t understand why there where other people sleeping in the room, or who they were, or why I was there. The only light was the moonlight, which was enough thanks to my dilated pupils. I couldn’t move, probably due to sleep paralysis (though in fact I wasn’t sleeping). So I closed my eyes trying to sleep. I saw the same immobile entities, hearing the same jingle, for what felt like hours. My perception of time was extremely messed up, so I think those visions lasted about an hour. Then, finally, I fell asleep.<br /><br />I woke up around T+6:00. I was coming down. I could understand how the MP3 player that was lying next to me worked and I turned it off (it had been playing all night!). I got up about an hour later, when the others woke up too. Visuals were still intense: moving and breathing surfaces, patterns ,dots and fractals everywhere. I had intense tracers too, and I felt like I was walking in oil. I liked it, and the mind trip was gone. About an hour later I was sort of back to baseline. I was tired because I didn’t sleep, but otherwise I felt ok. I went home and had a good sleep. The next day I felt depressed and apathetic, but this lasted only that day.<br /><br />This trip wasn’t that bad, I mean that it could have gone much worse. What have I learnt? Set and setting are really important. If you don’t feel comfortable, don’t do it. But this trip made me realize how fake is our everyday reality. Why should things be as we see them?

				Some folks have extraordinary abilty to metabolize PEAs. There is a specific name for this type of metabolism, but it slips my mind at the moment ( read the forums&nbsp; ). One needs to figure whether they are in this box or not before consuming 4mg of HPCD complexed Solaris (for instance).&nbsp; Be patient and start with the reccomended EROWID starting point of 1000 ug&nbsp; ( 1mg ) and if that doesn&#039;t get you over the hump wait four days and try 2mg, and so on until you find your &#039;sweet spot&#039;.&nbsp; I have been reading about/experimenting with this RC for about 60 days now, and I can honestly say it is a strong strong molecule.&nbsp; Here is some information for reference: When I drop LSD, I always do silver crystal liquid if I can find it and never do less than 250ug or more than 600 ug.&nbsp; Those seem to be pretty elevated doses to people these days, but since I started using psychedelics in 1985, I&#039;ve never had any bad physical side effects whatsoever.&nbsp; I usually eat between 4g - 6g of shrooms depending on type ( 2g of tampenesis, or 3g of azurescens ), so use that as a baseline. Obviously, I do not &#039;over-metabolize PEAs becasue a 2mg dose&nbsp; (2000ug) of DR&#039;s HPBCD complexed tabs ROCKED my noggin&#039; hard, and I don&#039;t consider myself a greenhorn psychedelic warrior.&nbsp; I did experience dehydration and vassoconstriction/hypertendion at 2000ug which I have never had on any other psychedelic before.&nbsp; I would like to go up to 3mg, but for me the high does not warrant the unnecessary side effects.&nbsp; Very cool, powerful, forgiving molecule so it is easy to research, just don&#039;t get over zealous and try to prove what a badass you are. This is the kind of thing that will get you a visit to the ER, media down on our ass and a public debacle WE DON&#039;T NEED OR WANT.&nbsp; Use your head for something other than space folks. Be sensible. Be careful. Be smart. Simple simple rules... Come on.<br />

				i am awaiting my purchase of 25i&#039;s and reading trip reports. From what i can see everyone seems to relate it to the amount of lsd they took.

I thought 1mg bucally was pretty weak, and 2mg was just ok. 4mg was the best trip I have had so far, and was planning on going higher next time. Yet people here say 1.5mg is the most they&#039;ve ever seen anyone take, and others say 4mg had them blacking out and in terrible condition?<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty concerned now. I was planning on buying a sheet of this stuff... Do I just have weak tabs? If I buy from another vendor will I end up in the hospital from taking the same dosage? <br /><br />4-5mg lethal dose?? Looks like I&#039;ll be sticking to LSD from now on....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The buccal doses you are referring to are for non-complexed 25I-NBOMe. HPBCD complexed tabs taken buccally have a 95% bioavailability! This means it&#039;s as potent as vaporizing or snorting it.<br />I took 1.65mg (3 of kwiktrip&#039;s tabs) a week ago. That was INTENSE. It nearly ended in a bad trip because there were too much people and my other tripping friend didn&#039;t want others to know we were tripping (WTF MAN!). I usually get nearly back to baseline in 8 hours. After 8 hours, everything was still breathing and morphing. So yeah, be careful when dosing 1000ug+.<br />(If someone is interested I can post a trip report)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />go ahead, sounds like an interesting time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here it is (I had already wrote it):<br /><br />First of all, some background. Before this experience, I had done 25I-NBOMe (complexed blotter) 2 times, at 500ug and 750ug. Both times I did it at day and I really enjoyed it. I wanted to take it to the next level, so I ordered some 550ug complexed blotters for me and a friend of mine who tripped with me.<br /><br />We planned to sleep at his house and take the blotters around 1AM, tripping at night. He had never done 25I-NBOMe. We decided that he would take 2 blotters (1100ug) and I would take 3 (1650ug). I wanted to have a mind blowing experience. There were 4 other friends with us.<br />I arrived at his house and after a while he said he didn’t want the other people to know we were doing 25I. I don’t know why he was like that. So we had to trip in the same room the others were sleeping in. I didn’t really like the idea, but I agreed since I was in his house and I wanted to trip. Big mistake.<br /><br />We smoked some weed around midnight and we put the blotters between the upper lip and gum. We turned off the lights to enjoy the weed effects. I was feeling good and relaxed. Usually it would take 2 hours for the 25I to come up fully, but after half an hour I was already fucked. It was hard to change the music on my MP3 player and I couldn’t understand what other people were saying. The ceiling was covered with beautiful patterns and fractals. At T+1:00 we turned on the lights to get ready to sleep. What I saw shocked me. Everything was breathing, morphing, the walls were moving. There were fractals all over the carpet and it was rippling. My vision looked like a tunnel. My friends’ faces were melting. It felt like a psychedelic brick to the stomach. I took my earphones off because the music (progressive house/trance/psytrance mixes) was making the experience overwhelming. I wasn’t able to shut down the MP3 player tough. I just couldn’t understand how it worked. I started to feel anxious and I stepped outside to get some air. It calmed me down a bit. I went back into the room and laid down. We turned off the lights so the other people could sleep.<br /><br />This is when it went crazy. I can’t give a precise timeline, I was traveling in time. My friends were talking before sleeping, but I pretended to sleep because I didn’t want them to ask me something. I was just too fucked up. I went to another world. At first it was cool. I was tripping really hard. But around T+2:00 things got a bit too intense. I was having OBEs which lasted some minutes, then I would fall back in my body and I was sure that I “woke up” in another position (in the morning I discovered I didn’t move at all). My friend were still talking and my closed-eye world started mixing with the real world. It got scary. I couldn’t distinguish between the two. I was sure I was in a sort of psychedelic coma and that I couldn’t wake up until the 25I came down. I thought I was hitting my friends every time I woke up. Their voices were distorted and echoed, and I was convinced that my friend called his parents because they couldn’t stop me, and that they called an ambulance. My friend started playing with a flashlight and I was sure he was a doctor checking me.<br /><br />I tried to sleep, and I fell in a sort of lucid sleep. I started hearing voices. I thought the voices were people talking in the ambulance. Then I realized that it was nearly impossible that my friends called an ambulance and I calmed down a bit. The voices sounded like a children jingle. I don’t remember them exactly, but I was sure I had already heard them in other dreams. I felt like time was looping. Every time someone said a certain word, I thought I traveled back in time to when they first said it. And it was looping faster, and faster, and faster. Every loop changed my perception of reality. I was convinced that I was leaving this world and that it was ending. Then I realized that I would begin a new life and this calmed me. Time looped even faster, then it stopped. I was trapped into another world and the jingle changed. I saw entities made of rock. I was sure my existence on this planet had ended, and I was waiting my rebirth. Those entities gave me a bad feeling, I wasn’t feeling comfortable with them. Sometimes I would open my eyes hoping to see something familiar, but I couldn’t understand why there where other people sleeping in the room, or who they were, or why I was there. The only light was the moonlight, which was enough thanks to my dilated pupils. I couldn’t move, probably due to sleep paralysis (though in fact I wasn’t sleeping). So I closed my eyes trying to sleep. I saw the same immobile entities, hearing the same jingle, for what felt like hours. My perception of time was extremely messed up, so I think those visions lasted about an hour. Then, finally, I fell asleep.<br /><br />I woke up around T+6:00. I was coming down. I could understand how the MP3 player that was lying next to me worked and I turned it off (it had been playing all night!). I got up about an hour later, when the others woke up too. Visuals were still intense: moving and breathing surfaces, patterns ,dots and fractals everywhere. I had intense tracers too, and I felt like I was walking in oil. I liked it, and the mind trip was gone. About an hour later I was sort of back to baseline. I was tired because I didn’t sleep, but otherwise I felt ok. I went home and had a good sleep. The next day I felt depressed and apathetic, but this lasted only that day.<br /><br />This trip wasn’t that bad, I mean that it could have gone much worse. What have I learnt? Set and setting are really important. If you don’t feel comfortable, don’t do it. But this trip made me realize how fake is our everyday reality. Why should things be as we see them?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve read this on erowid before :)

				Hey guys, thought this would be a good thread for my query.<br />&nbsp; <br />So today I received around 30+ tabs from Duderugs.&nbsp; I&#039;m excited to try this substance, but I am determined to wait until the right circumstances.&nbsp; I am experienced with MDMA, 2cb and cannabis. I&#039;ve tripped on acid before, twice, however I believe they were threshold doses, didn&#039;t really get much in the way of visuals etc. For me 2cb has been far more visual and fun than the &quot;acid&quot; I have dosed.&nbsp; That said, I am quite confident I will be able to handle myself if a trip starts going in the wrong direction (though as you can see, I haven&#039;t had extensive experience with the deeper psychs). I have been doing 2cb a little too much lately (about 6 times in the last 2 months), the first few were great, the last few have really been lacking on the visuals; so i&#039;m assuming, tolerance? <br />With this in mind, if I was to try the 25i in the next month (abstaining from other phenethylamine use of course), will tolerance from 2cb come into play?<br /><br />&nbsp;I wan&#039;t my first time to be a STRONG psychedelic experience, but NOT TOO STRONG. &quot;STRONG&quot; is subjective of course, I guess I want some mega cool visuals, and cool effects to some experimental beat-driven music....without feeling body load so much, or anxiety.<br /><br />To cut to the chase, as a noob, I was thinking about dosing 2 Duderugs tabs straight up. What do you guys think?

				Thanks for the advice Sniper. I was going to follow Duderugs guidelines and put two tabs on my upper gum for 45 mins. I have heard of dosing up the nose though, on some other drug forums. Would you say it&#039;s undoubtedly stronger? Also, how far up the nose are we talking? Like further than you&#039;d go if you were to &quot;give it a cleanout&quot; with you finger? lol&nbsp; If you have to go further than that into the narrower section of the nose, how would you make sure you can actually extract the tab when you&#039;re done?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want ego death or anything, but I don&#039;t want to have to use any willpower to make visuals happen etc.

Not that far up your nose, just stick it on the inside and it should stick. I also don&#039;t get as bad of nausea if i put it in my nose. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll experience ego death from 25I. Out of body in higher doses though. The only drug i have ever experienced ego death off of was LSD. Which i cured by snorting some meth after i came down off the LSD. Not the smartest idea... But, it worked lol.

				I think it&#039;s settled then! I shall do two tabs, taken buccally to aim for a strong but not overpowering experience (the thought of OOB experience scares me a bit, I could probably manage it but would like to avoid such things at this stage).&nbsp; Then i&#039;ll try the intranasal dosing in the future!<br />thanks for the advice!

				Sort of topic and I apologize, but I how do you guys store your 25i? do the same general rules involving lsd tab storage apply to 25i tabs, or is there extra steps to take to ensure the tabs remain potent.

				I found the first time I tried one, I had placed it under my tounge. But I was too chippy on mephadrone that I ended up swallowing it before I had absorbed the goodness.<br /><br />Second time after some research I placed it between my gum and upper lip by the join, until the blotter broke up. 20min later major euforical waves constantly for the next 6 hours! With each wave I did notice a rapid rise in body temp and lots of sweat. I was consuming some beer to smooth out the peaks and I did notice some minor chest discomfort.<br /><br />Third time, when combined with methylone, body temp rolled up and down quite alot. I was out at the time, so I bought some paracetamol (Tylanol), and 2 tablets of this regulated my temp and made the experience all round enjoyable.<br /><br />To sum up, I think that if you find your body temp getting high, its important for harm reduction to at least try 2 tablets of paracetamol (tylanol in the us) to bring it down, as most ED in hospitals will do this straight away anyway.

				Tolerance acceleration is very speedy with this lil&#039; guy. If you have taken 2mg or more during the past 7 days, it is probably a good standard to space out your next dose with at least 4-6days between every 2mg&nbsp; of Solaris you have consumed over a period of time. I&#039;ve noticed that as I have utilized this scale in my approach to researching this compound, as I stack on further dosage amount the effectiveness of the &#039;breaks&#039; diminish unless more time is added to the break period. This chemical is some fairly heavy body load as well, so extended recreational use is not advised coming from my seat. From my experience it seems to be more of a social empathogen with visuals and the psychedelic amperage somewhat akin to MDMA with the sensual amplification. Dehydration, anxiety on comeup and vasoconstriction are some of the physical side effects. Neat molecule overall, I would say this could be a seasonal experience possibly. Once a quarter on the solstice/equinox dates to cleanse the heart. Not sdo much of a deep mind probe psychedelic as it is &#039;heart enriching&#039;. Sorry, those are the best word I can select for the feeling. I&#039;ve only researched it 8 times now. Maybe I can find a better description later.
