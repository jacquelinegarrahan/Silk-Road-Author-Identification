				Has anyone here had any trouble with stomach cramps and bladder pains after continual daily usage of MXE?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using MXE to help deal with emotional problems and overall it&#039;s been going extremely well. My usage isn&#039;t insane or anything. I&#039;ve gone through about 2 grams in the space of 24 days. Apparently MXE is about 4 times stronger the Ketamine, so that would mean the equivalent of 8 grams in 24 days (about 0.33 grams of K a day). So yeah, not too bad (if those estimations actually check out).<br /><br />I just started to notice some minor discomfort over the past several days. Yesterday I took a day off and the discomfort seems to have subsided, yet there is still some there. I&#039;ve been drinking a little bicarbonate of soda and water - yesterday and today too to help with the PH levels.<br /><br />My diet at the moment is reasonably healthy. I don&#039;t drink or smoke, and haven&#039;t been doing any other drug than MXE. I am considering about doing some more today, but I&#039;m worried that the pains will just start up again. The wisest thing for me to do I&#039;m sure would be for me to take a few days off, but currently I am somewhat emotionally and psychologically dependent on the drug. MXE makes me super productive and there&#039;s an awful lot of shit I need to deal with at the moment (got sucked into a cult, was in a depression for a long time, got into a real mess financially). So yeah, am in a bit of a difficult situation regarding that. I may just take the MXE today, see how I feel, and if the pains come back/get worse, then I&#039;ll know I need to take a longer break.

				Drug-related stomach pains tend to get worse. I had a lot of tremors with 2C-T-4 (10 hours of constant tremors!) and I can&#039;t take a 2C orally without throwing up now. I won&#039;t be trying for a few months anyway. MXE has potential to do bladder damage, similar to Ketamine, so it could be that? Anyway, I snort 2Cs now and I get nasal burn instead of violent vomiting. A fine trade, I think. Perhaps this would work for you? Maybe only snort for a few days? I have snorted MXE before and it&#039;s not painful and the drip is almost sweet. Just remember the dosing is a bit different. I think my situation may be different though, different reasons for discomfort. You can also try weaning yourself off for a few days. One off, one on... two off, one on... etc. Then it would at least slow down and you could eventually stop for a while or maybe permanently.<br /><br />Good luck!

That&#039;s good advice there about cutting down the usage to one day on, one day off, then two days off, one day on.<br /><br />Have tried a 2C once at a music festival (can&#039;t quite remember which one it was. Maybe 2C-B?). Anyway, I plan on ordering a single dose of 2C-B later on today. Have just been doing MXE recently, and would like to throw a new chem into the mix.<br /><br />Indeed as well, the drip isn&#039;t bad at all with the stuff I have. I don&#039;t snort huge amounts and usually enjoy a mint as well to prevent any potential nastiness from the drip.<br /><br />Thanks again :-)

				Be very careful, K cramps are horrific but do subside after you stop taking it. The bladder problems however can be permanent, you get scarring and interstitial cystitis. With continued use of K, these can result in the bladder having to be removed or particularly nasty surgery in which the bladder is temporarily removed and stretched to restore some of the lost elasticity from the scarring.<br /><br />The guy who invented MXE claimed that it was more &#039;bladder friendly&#039;. This is bollocks. There is still little consensus on the cause of ketamine induced bladder damage- it could just be a general side effect of arylcyclohexylamine use and MXE could well be as dangerous. As it&#039;s a fairly new drug, there&#039;s still plenty of time to see what damage it could cause.<br /><br />You can prevent nausea on K and MXE by not swallowing the drip, it is possible that the cramps are caused by ingesting the drug in this manner. <br /><br />If I were you, I&#039;d seriously consider having at least a 2 week break and cut out daily use. The antidepressant effects of ketamine have been demonstrated after a single large dose, there&#039;s no evidence to suggest that taking it every day is more effective and could result in dependance and physical damage...

				I think the key is not overdoing it.&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re snorting it or taking it orally and if that makes a difference.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken probably 2 grams over the past 2 months (close enough) and I haven&#039;t had any issues, except positive ones.&nbsp; If you&#039;re taking it orally, switch to snorting it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not bad at all.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ah, nevermind.&nbsp; I see in your second post that you are inhaling it.&nbsp; My advice would be to slow down a bit.&nbsp; I love it and could take it everyday but I think it&#039;s wise to space out your days.&nbsp; I do it like every 2 or 3 days.&nbsp; Although I&#039;m completely out right now and waiting on 2 grams to arrive from overseas.&nbsp; Please Allah, make it happen fast!

				I did my first gram of MXE in about ten days.&nbsp; It was just too good to stay away from.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; But I never had bladder pains or stomach cramps.&nbsp; The worst side effects I experienced occurred the day after use.&nbsp; I&#039;d experience mania, insomnia, appetite loss (I lost seven pounds during my &quot;binge&quot;), slight cognitive impairment, and even if I slept for a shit ton of hours, I&#039;d still feel really exhausted.&nbsp; A one day break usually reversed all of this for me.

				Thanks for the posts guys. I ended up having some MXE today. As expected it made me super productive and have got an awful lot done today (can&#039;t believe how much stuff I&#039;ve done recently lol).<br /><br />The bladder issues did start right up again however. I have a history of urination problems (even when I was a kid) and am very sensitive to things that might affect my bladder. Anyway, I got this thing where I felt like I needed to pee but I couldn&#039;t pee (have been there before, and not just with mxe and k). It kinda freaked me out a bit, but I decided it was best just to drink a shitload of water (also had some bicarbonate of soda with it too) and that seemed to fix it all up right good and proper.<br /><br />But yeah, seems the best option is for me to cut down my usage gradually (spacing it out etc) and see where it goes from there. I&#039;ve not had any horrific pains or anything like that. It&#039;s all been quite bearable to be honest, and I feel quite on top of things. So yeah, not worried, but thanks for all the support! Really loving this community already :-)

				I don&#039;t know anything about what cause bladder pain with K and MXE, but maybe you could try traditional cures for bladder pain and unhealth? Lots of water is good. Cranberries (you can get pills from any pharmacy) are good for preventing UTIs; maybe that would help. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s documentation on the cause of it and perhaps a cure or at least treatment if you look around.
