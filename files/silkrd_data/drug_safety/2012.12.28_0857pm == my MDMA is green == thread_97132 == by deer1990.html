				I don&#039;t know what it was but it wasn&#039;t for me and it was probably the oiliest, most off colored and contaminated batch of MDMA I&#039;ve ever seen. Complete and utter shit that had to be dosed out at 200mg for a dose.

				No I haven&#039;t tried it yet. What color should show up on a test.&nbsp; And what other drugs would show up as green&nbsp; with a test. ? I&#039;m going to try soon so I know for sure.

				Hello there! I am new to the silk road forums and fairly new on the silk road......but, i am no noob when it comes to mdma and mdxx like substances.....i&#039;ve been using xtc for 12 years and i alwayz reagent test my gear! alwayz!! no matter where it comes from, the road, or the ghetto pipe pill dope dealer......all you really need for a quick test is a Marquis.....if it dont go black, give that shit back!!!! if the green shit tests right then yeah i would munch it, but if ur reagent tests turns green that would be a 2c-x type substance and i would want to munch on that even more....hope that helps

				Mecke&#039;s reagent has replaced Marquis as the standard test. I have a few different reagents for different purposes.

				In my opinion Marquis is&nbsp; the better all round reagent as it reacts differently to more substances. However, Mecke is a good complimentary reagent as it can reinforce a Marquis result i.e. for many psychoactive compounds, it produces a different color. I like the fact that Marquis will react to amphetamines as a secondary amine as orange along with the black from the mdma reaction.....Mecke doesnt react to meth.....

				I got it all figured out now. The guy said he put half a green xtc tablet to sample but I guess it got crushed which makes sense.
