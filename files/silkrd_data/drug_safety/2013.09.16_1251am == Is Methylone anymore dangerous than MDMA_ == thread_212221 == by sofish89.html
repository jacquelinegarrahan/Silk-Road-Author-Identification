				I keep reading stories in the news about methylone deaths and how methylone is much more dangerous than MDMA. Is this all just media hype ?

				In a way it can be. My take on it is a lot of people who take &quot;Molly&quot; don&#039;t exactly know what is it. What differentiates MDMA from Methylone is the potency. Remember Methylone is a by product of MDMA that is a lot less potent. So people will roll for 1-2 hours, come down and re-dose thinking its a shit batch of MDMA. They&#039;ll do this repeatedly, until they have insane levels in there body. Plus most people don&#039;t test there product. They assume oh crystals, sweet it must be what I think it is. Which is just irresponsibility. So yeah they can both be dangerous, I just think many people abuse one more than the other. That and well impurity cuts, and dealers selling shit. Mixing in meth, PMA, and a bunch of other fucked up shit.<br /><br />Now remember what even you hear on the news, take a grain of salt. You will never have the facts fully laid out before you. Why? Because lazy journalist, propaganda, and well those stories don&#039;t sell. Why target PMA (a fairly unknown substance), when you can target MDMA as a whole, which everyone has heard of.

				If its pure Methylone that has been properly synthesized (There&#039;s a lot of garbage out there with precursors and shit still in it) then it does significantly less damage then MDMA. Keep in mind that each has different damaging properties though. I remember reading a while ago that people who take Methylone frequently have problems with frequent urination, bladder problems and other nice stuff like that.<br /><br />Keep in mind these are the guys taking it a few times a week for months on end. There&#039;s a ton of people who take this stuff once weekly and have no lasting or negative effects at all.

				There&#039;s alot of methylone produced by Chinese labs so should have reasonably high purity, certainly that applies to the stuff I&#039;ve been getting. Have been doing plenty last few months. Can get quite morish for me though with frequent re-dosing. I find it&#039;s quite hard to urinate after a long session and other than lots of sleep deprivation haven&#039;t experienced any other issues. Must say though have never been a big MDMA user so can&#039;t really compare. Having said this, have decided to take a break for a while as was building up high tolerance and going through heaps.

				More physically harmful, dose for dose..i dont think so. Much higher potential for abuse, id say yes.

I think that the new shit BK floating around almost certainly has a built in &quot;designer rational&quot; beyond the original intent of just MDMC in terms of abusive potential and nuero pharmacology. It&#039;s pretty clear that they are using different precursors now, though I don&#039;t know for certain if that necc. has anything to do with the damage / addiction etc...but M1 does seem to have changed. Or maybe I am just like every other e tard that wants the good shit from the old days b4 they got fried :)

				Methylone is much more dangerous in many ways ----&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />but really ---&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lets look at recent deaths --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they are from M1 and maybe a drop of mdma n yes prolly some other rc&#039;s -- <br /><br />yet we never saw this in the last 30 years !&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so safe mdma was --&nbsp; &nbsp;it seemed amazing at times ! <br /><br />but now suddenly bad / sometimes unknown and of course Methylone is added and for the many reasons above -- death is happening <br /><br />plz take that drug off the table ---&nbsp; &nbsp;yes it is more dangerous -- <br /><br />best 2 u <br /><br />b careful plz<br /><br />

				it could be more dangerous but your point isn&#039;t really valid. m1 makes up about 80%+ of the molly market = more deaths.

				methylone --- 80 percent of molly/mdma ???? <br /><br /><br /><br />im not sure what that means -- <br /><br />if you are implying 80 % of mdma is cut with methylone ( i sure hope not --- and actually its not -- just bad dealers mixin 4 profit )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and thats in recent times instead of the pure mdma ----&nbsp; the mix has obviously caused more deaths ? --&nbsp; <br /><br />but again im not sure about what the 80 % means <br /><br />n yes my stats are not on point -- they are from 30 years experience around the world ... (why the usa seems to grab these substances is another story ....) <br /><br />peace n respect

				Simply put; we don&#039;t know.<br /><br />There have not been enough long term studies on methylone or MDMA even to prove that one is inherently more dangerous than the other. All we have is anecdotal reports, which you have to take with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I have done both substances, and while I&#039;ve had some fairly awful comedowns from MDMA, I had one of my worst experiences with any drug ever. I&#039;m not gonna bother posting it again after getting karma bombed last time and trolled by a likely methylone vendor, but let me just say it was not pleasant. Also, I will probably do MDMA sometime again in the future, but never plan on touching methylone EVER again.<br /><br />Once again, this is purely anecdotal and you should not base your decisions on my personal experience. Both should be treated as highly dangerous substances and with extreme caution, since neither (especially methylone) have the clinical studies to conclusively back up their long term (and even short term) safety.<br /><br />
