				What strain of cannabis would you say is most ideal for a person who can suffer from paranoia and panic attacks?<br />I smoked it for a few years without any problems. One day I smoked something that was the equivalent of four acid tabs. I had a panic attack and a twelve hour trip. Haven&#039;t touched it since. Hallucinations are a big no no for me now (unless you can also think of a way I can experience those while ensuring I don&#039;t have a bad trip)<br />Any advice?<br />

				I have BAD panic attacks that are linked to flashbacks about my childhood, which was very bad. I&#039;ve always been fond of how cannabis can help prevent them or stop them while I&#039;m having one. I&#039;ve always had the best experience with sativa strains, they give me a great body high and the mental side of the high really distracts me, although this could intensify an attack for someone else.<br /><br />However, my best experience comes from hash. A soft, crumbly hash makes me relax and completely stops panic attacks for about a week. When I take tolerance breaks and before I smoked, I had one to two panic attacks a day and they were usually quite severe, with hyperventilating, excessive sweating, etc. But hash completely stops them.<br /><br />Best of luck to you man, sorry to hear you have panic attacks too&nbsp; :(

				I&#039;m on a mission to sample every drug on this site (after research to make sure it won&#039;t fuck me up). I&#039;m not touching Salvia. I think that was in whatever I smoked on that terrible night.

				I&#039;ve actually used salvia and it&#039;s helped me quite a bit as well, but I didn&#039;t want to suggest it because it might not go so well for others. You could consider maybe a low extract or chewing on leaves instead to get a lower dose and a more gradual, easy trip. But if you&#039;re uncomfortable with it, I&#039;d avoid it.

It wasn&#039;t that. Only thing iv heard of weed being laced with is pcp but I don&#039;t think it lasts 12 hours.

				So more likely, I had a schizophrenic episode? I had certainly never experienced it before smoking whatever it was my friends used to pass round.

				Dunno about the OP (who mentioned hallucinations), but the 2nd poster seems to have classic panic attack symptoms. <br /><br />Most people who freak out after smoking weed are having panic attacks, not psychotic episodes. Unless you weren&#039;t you and/or didn&#039;t know what was real anymore, odds are you were suffering from the former. I would talk to someone about the high anxiety that likely caused your panic. That shit is not good for you, especially later on in life when you have to worry about your heart, blood pressure, and strokes. Get it taken care of while you still can, but try not to get hooked on benzos or anything like that. Psychedelics will be hit or miss, as in you may have a life changing revelation or a crushing bad trip that quadruples your anxiety.<br /><br />If anyone has similar problems, try smoking smaller amounts and in good settings. If you can find indica strains like Master Kush, blazing will be far easier on you than if you were smoking a sativa. There&#039;s a good chance your panic attack will return because you are now conditioned to associate weed with the feeling of panic and bad thoughts. Expect this, but also know that it is just anxiety, and you don&#039;t have to think bad thoughts. It&#039;s all in your head.

I&#039;ve&nbsp; had hallucinations, paranoia and panic attacks from cannabis several times. In fact I always get hallucinations from cannabis, which isn&#039;t a very common effect for most people, but it can and does happen without it being adulterated with other drugs. I doubt it was salvia or PCP because neither of these drugs should last 12 hours. It was probably just too much cannabis.

				I only had two puffs. It was all very strange.<br />Thinking about it, I have only ever smoked after a night out (ie drunk). Was it the instant shift from &#039;normal&#039; to extremely high that triggered something?<br />12 hours later I believed I was sat in a room on a chair with nothing else in the universe, a Japanese flag behind being me with my soul floating above my head reversing on itself. I was trying to make it stop at the point where the soul would leave me sane.<br />Slightly odd, I&#039;m sure you will agree. I also tried to jump out of a moving car as I believed that act would cause a chain of events to change. Everything that was happening was part of an inevitable, pre determined plan. It was similar to 12 hours of deja vous.&nbsp; <br />That was after the panic attack.<br />Two puffs. <br />I often dream this way, only this time I was living the dream.<br />Psychosis?<br />No taking the piss....this is research.
