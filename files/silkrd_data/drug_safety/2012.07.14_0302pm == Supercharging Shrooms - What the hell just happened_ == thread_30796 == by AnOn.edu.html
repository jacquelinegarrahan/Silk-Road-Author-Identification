				Ok, maybe that wasn&#039;t the best idea.&nbsp; At least I&#039;m not in jail or the hospital.<br /><br />I&#039;m a fairly experienced user of the old school psychedelics.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done easily 150 to 200 hits of acid in my life and I&#039;m certainly no stranger to shrooms but it&#039;s been a few years since I&#039;ve done any phychedelics and I&#039;ve never done them with nootropics. <br /><br />So I took the day off work, was going to do a little shroom trip at a nature preserve about a 30 minute drive from my house.&nbsp; None of my friends or family are aware of my SR pursuits so this was a trip I was doing alone, which is how I have usually done my spiritual/psychedelic adventures before.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done 10 hits of acid at one sitting (granted I was in my 20&#039;s), 7 grams of shrooms at another sitting and in both cases had no problems.<br /><br />I had my day all planned out, I put together a backpack with everything I&#039;d need in case the trip went bad, I was just going to stay at this park for 4 hours and then when I was cool to drive I&#039;d come home or go to a movie.<br /><br />I&#039;m mentally in a good place and was really looking forward to a great nature trip.&nbsp; Just to make sure I stayed in a good mental place I took two THC caps and a little bit of low dose opiate pain pills (I don&#039;t have any opiate tolerance).&nbsp; <br /><br />Along with the THC and pills I took:<br />3.5 grams piracetam<br />1.5 grams CDC Choline<br />300 mg&#039;s Ginko biloba<br />1 gram Sulbutiamine<br />500 mg ALCAR<br />potassium supplement for heart rate<br />NAC and Milk Thistle for liver function<br /><br />I then put 5 grams of ground shrooms in key lime juice for 20 minutes and when I was about 10 minutes away from the park I poured tea into the shroom/key lime mix and downed it all.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was expecting to have about an hour before it hit, boy was I wrong.&nbsp; I was barely able to make it into the park and sit on a bench before it hit me with the power of a thousand suns.&nbsp; <br /><br />I must say that I have never had the visuals and auditory effects that I had on this trip.&nbsp; All my senses fully detached and I hit a psychedelic level I&#039;ve never even remotely come close to before.&nbsp; What I learned on this trip will stick with me for a long time and I can&#039;t really go into it because I&#039;m still figuring it out.<br /><br />The bad thing is that this trip was like a fevered dream but when I came to, 5 hours later, I was sitting in the parking lot of a store 10 miles from the park, two gallons of water drunk, three more THC pills gone, and I really needed to pee. <br /><br />The moral of this post is 2 fold:<br />1. If you want a batshit insane trip then megadose on nootropics<br />2. If you do this then hide your keys and stay within walking distance of your home.<br /><br />I&#039;m still trying to figure out what the fuck happened.

				This trip sounds like it would be awesome with a trip-sitter and at most, half the dose of everything you had lol.<br /><br />Congratulations, for not ending up dead or behind bars though. :)

				Thanks Sundhara!<br /><br />It was still an amazing trip, insane, but amazing. I&#039;m just a little freaked out about what could have happened. You&#039;re right though, whether at these doses or half the doses, with a sitter and at a place where driving isn&#039;t required it would have been a lot more fun.<br /><br />What really surprised me was how fantastic I felt the next day.

				&nbsp;+1 for not ending up in custody LOL<br /><br />I have read similar reports to this from lime juice extractions of shrooms. One theory to why it hits so strong is tolerance. Example: if you have a belly full of raw mushrooms it takes a long time to digest them, giving your body a chance to build tolerance, whereas, the extracted psilocybin in the lime juice needs no time at all to digest so it hits all at once with no chance for tolerance build up. Sounds fun! :)

This one&#039;s sold by BuddhaNature, and I&#039;ve recently got my hands on some of these, but haven&#039;t had the guts to try them yet :) I tried some Galindoi before but my body just puked them out with no effect. Any suggestions or precautions you could think of for these pills?<br /><br />Product page&#039;s here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/45cd12b70c<br /><br />Btw, I trust BuddhaNature wholeheartedly as he&#039;s a great fella and his product is the best :)

				I think your setting probably intensified your trip the most out of anything.
