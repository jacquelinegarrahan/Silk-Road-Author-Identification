				Hey everyone, the only psychedelic I&#039;ve ever taken was shrooms. I had a very bad experience, it was very overwhelming. However, I blame this on myself as a took too much for my first time, and I was also in a bad setting. Enough time has passed that I am curious to trying again. So my question is what are the differences between 2C-B/C/E/I, and which would you recommend for somebody who wants to get into psychedelics, but at a very slow pace. Thanks for any help!&nbsp;

				2c-b and 2c-e seem to be the most indicated 2cs for inexperienced trippers. You should start with a light dose, and DO NOT redose the first few times. If you aren&#039;t used to how a particular drug interacts with your body, you can&#039;t be sure if you&#039;re still coming up and redosing might lead to a higher dose than you&#039;re ready for.<br /><br />I recommend you visit www.erowid.org to read up on the drugs you want to compare. The site has info on doses, effects and precautions to take, as well as a huge database of trip reports. It&#039;s a wealth of information that will surely help you to make your decision.<br /><br />Always remember that each body interacts differently with drugs. No two people have the same trip. Be cautious, and you&#039;ll be fine.

				the hint about erowid is very valuable, check it out!<br />i tried 2cb at my first psychedelic experience (me 65kgs= 15mgs), was a bit underdosed but the second try a few days later with 18mgs was very smooth with light but impressive visuals.<br />just make sure that your set is comfortable and the setting is positive with dim light and maybe some chilling music!<br />have a buddy looking for your sometimes and eat/drink well before to fill your electrolytes.<br />have fun! :)

				Most claim 2C-C followed by 2C-I are the most innocuous of the 2C-X family.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;d start with 2C-E, as I&#039;ve heard the body load can be rather terrible.
