				I have done this before and not gotten sick.. but I have a sensitive stomach. Wondering if I should take on an empty stomach then eat dinner, or eat dinner and then take it.. I don&#039;t want to throw up essentially because its an oral cap... and I can&#039;t snort this sht is really painful. I have about 10-15 mg dose btw

				You should let your stomach be empty when you take it, just make sure you eat something low GI and high protein so it&#039;ll stick with you.<br /><br />I am pretty sure that the reason why you throw up is the serotonin HT3 receptor agonizing, so I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a lot you can do along the lines of the conventional. There is an anti-emetic called Ondansetron (try online pharms) which antagonizes these receptors and works particularly well for 2C-E trips according to SWIM.<br /><br />Also, once your body absorbs the drug, throwing up won&#039;t eject any of the substance. Don&#039;t worry about the oral ROA, in fact the only drug I can think of that exits your body when you throw up is alcohol. (Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.)

As for the food, I&#039;d personally suggest you just kinda skip it. I wouldn&#039;t eat anything for, say, 4 hours ahead of time, and then catch up on food on the come-down.
