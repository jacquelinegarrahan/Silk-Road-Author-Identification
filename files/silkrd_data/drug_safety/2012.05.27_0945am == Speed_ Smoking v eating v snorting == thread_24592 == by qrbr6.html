				Smoking: ewwww<br />Eating: Slow onset but lasts long. I&#039;m not sure why but my body always feels like crap after I ate some. <br />Snorting: Fast onset, lasts a bit shorter. I&#039;d say for starters this is the way to go. Start off with like 50mg, make 2 lines, snort 1 first and see what happens.. take the other 15minutes later if you like what&#039;s going on&nbsp; 8)

				Smoking is the way to go. It&#039;s just like people saying they wouldn&#039;t ever inject heroin, but eventually start injecting it because snorting/smoking isn&#039;t nearly as intense and then they say to themselves &quot;Wow I&#039;m an idiot for not doing this sooner.&quot;.

				Yeah I&#039;ve heard smoking is the way to go, never done it before however. Looking to try it soon. I&#039;ve got some speed paste, I suppose I&#039;ll have to let it dry out to smoke right? What is a good dosage to smoke?

Some meth is speedy and others are more in your head and if you don&#039;t know what to expect you could easily find yourself too high. I&#039;ve been doing meth for quite a long time and still do 20mg bumps every 3-4 hours over the course of a couple of days. Even then i find myself sometimes skipping a dose because of how the high accumulates due to how long it stays in the body.<br /><br />If you want to a freebase&nbsp; like feeling then smoke away and chase the pipe every 20-40 minutes and watch your supply dwindle before your eyes or enjoy some nice lines every few hours and enjoy a nice ass high. I sometimes mix it up and swallow a dose as well which is also quite good.<br /><br />

				Speed paste or Amphetamine cannot be vaporized, your best off snorting it and topping up as needed. Do not try to smoke it.<br /><br />If your vaping your speed and it&#039;s not turning to chard shit it&#039;s meth.<br /><br />Meth is fun to vaporize!

Try speed first. Meth is a very hard and also dangerous drug!
