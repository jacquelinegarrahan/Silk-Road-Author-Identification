				What is your weight? If you are close to 100lbs, I would start with a very small bump, about 0.1 grams or 100 milligrams. If you are closer to 200lbs, I would suggest 0.15 grams or 150 milligrams. REMEMBER to ALWAYS START SMALL!!! It is VERY easy to overdo it, and the results could be very dangerous! If you do your first tiny bump and do not feel anything after 20 minutes, try another 50 - 100 milligram bump. Just be very careful and have fun sweetie.

				also remember that you only need to redose every four hours or so. for most new users and those that wait to fully recover after a run will only go through a quarter gram over the weekend partying non-stop, as long as you stick to sensible amounts you have nothing to worry about. it&#039;s a fucking blast. i&#039;ve been doing it on and off a couple times a month for many years now and i&#039;ve never had a problem. <br /><br />come down isn&#039;t bad, just try to eat and drink something if you plan on staying up a couple days. i suggest you cut yourself off after two nights because things can become &quot;interesting&quot; and a new user may not be able to deal. personally i like the first couple days but things start to get really interesting after day 4.

				SNORT IT!!!<br />I smoke it because I crave it the way people crave cigarettes. I have never been addicted to nicotine, but I really believe the experience of trying to quit is probably the same as meth.<br /><br />I feel like smoking it causes you to use up more of it faster, but I can&#039;t say for sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;When you smoke it, you feel the rush and the euphoria, but the euphoria goes away after about 1 hour and the energy stays with you for hours on end. It really sucks ass, because you&#039;re constantly chasing the euphoria but you&#039;re overdoing the energy all to hell. When you snort it, you feel the euphoria and the energy for almost the same amount of time, the euphoria lasts much longer. Snort it, don&#039;t even bother smoking it, it&#039;s fucking retarded.

				I really enjoy the ritual of smoking, putting a little in the pipe heating and twirling, breathing in, holding and letting go.&nbsp; &nbsp;Snorting is just unpleasant, the euphoria might be better, but the act of smoking is a big part of the experience for me.<br /><br />Till I smoked ice, I couldn&#039;t smoke anything at all, had only smoked 1/2 a cigarette in my life, then vommited, being a quitter, I never persevered like some people.&nbsp; I could never smoke dope, would just cough and splutter, and people would look at me in disgust, all the waste, I used to eat hash rather than smoking.<br /><br />But ice, I really enjoy the smoking, besides the first puff which is really obnoxious, the rest is a joy.
