				DMT I would say, but I&#039;m fairly new to the RC&#039;s, I know DMT was a holy shit experience compared to any shroom, lsd or recently nbome trips I&#039;ve had.

				DMT pretty easily. It is unlike any other psychedelic though, and should not be treated or seen as simply a hallucinogen. It generally tends to be an incredibly humbling, religious or Spiritual experience, and a breakthrough will stay with you for the rest of your life. Treat the spice with the respect it deserves, and it will give you more than you can imagine.

				DMT, of course.&nbsp; But if doesn&#039;t suit your occasion, maybe 2C-P?&nbsp; It&#039;s supposed to be really fucking intense.&nbsp; So is Datura, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend that!<br />As for the aural hallucinations, DiPT is primarily auditory.

				DMT. Don&#039;t give it to him before trying it yourself, and don&#039;t try it before meditating for 10+ minutes and clearing your mind. Also you absolutely need a vaporizer to use it, anyone who tells you otherwise doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;d been missing.

				When you want &quot;hardcore,&quot; you must look to the dissociatives and the deliriants...<br /><br />DMT and Salvia are both potent psychedelics and potent dissociatives. They both have easy potential for ineffable trips.<br />Likewise, &quot;hole&quot;-ing on a dissociative can be pretty intense.<br />And then let&#039;s not forget deliriant trips which aren&#039;t very &quot;psychedelic&quot; but they are the only trips where one experiences the cliche &quot;seeing things that aren&#039;t there&quot; effect that you see in the movies.<br /><br />I found 25i to be mild until I smoked on it, so don&#039;t worry about what your friend thinks, because it&#039;s not that bizarre for that to happen.

				ugh, DMT is so fucking nasty to smoke though. I tried it and I could never &quot;break through&quot; because the taste is soooo bad.<br /><br />Does the 5MEODMT taste any better?

I&#039;ve really fucked myself up with sleep deprivation before, but DMT has slowly been healing me from the damage I&#039;ve done to myself from doing that. Many friends lives have been changed for the better thanks to experimenting with LSD and DMT so definitely look into it. ;)

				I really didn&#039;t think i burtn the dmt when I smoked it in a meth pipe.&nbsp; I hardly got any smoke off of it because I didn&#039;t want to flame it very hard.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ended up leaving the pipe with a half gram in it for months until a friend found it and started smoking on it. she had a good time.&nbsp; I ended up throwing it away because I didn&#039;t want anyone to see it and think it was meth and call me a tweaker.&nbsp; (I had some shitty friends at the time)<br /><br />When I smoked it on weed, it tasted just the same.&nbsp; horrible.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to order some 5-meo-dmt as soon as bit coins go down a few cents as I am 3 cents short on my account.&nbsp; lol

				More support for DMT or 2c-p, both are great chemicals with solid visuals.&nbsp; DMT while peaking on a phenylethylamine or another tryptamine has always been an awesome and very visual experience for me.

There&#039;s a ceiling, you won&#039;t trip any harder than the ceiling, and the excess LSD will have no effect at all. You could eat a 1 gram crystal and be fine 18 or so hours later.
