				I&#039;ve only done MDMA once and that&#039;s the only drug I&#039;ve done (except alcohol), was wondering what people&#039;s opinions would be on this being a good idea or not?<br /><br />Also, dosage? I have 2 capsules of 2c-b said to be 16-18mg which I bought form generalm3sS. I was guessing just one of those would be okay.

				2c-b is pretty mellow and isn&#039;t really too much of a hard trip. You can just sit around and watch movies and shit. However, there is quite a bit of residual stimulation so don&#039;t take it late at night.

				I&#039;d agree with foxy here. Try to take one during the day as opposed to later at night unless you have no other time or the next day off. In regards to the substance, a normal dose of 2c-b should be a nice welcoming to the psychedelic world, without too much of the body load or hard visuals and mindfucks that can be associated with other psychs. Just make sure your mindset and setting are fine and you should have a good 4-8 hours.

				i&#039;ve taken 2C-B only once, after a night of rolling.&nbsp; it was by far the easiest, simplest, most colorful psychedelic i have ever done.&nbsp; there is definately stimulation there...&nbsp; alot like MDMA but a bit more speedy.&nbsp; but the duration is short and sweet and the mental state is pushed towards the positive, with a familiar MDMA-like euphoria accenting the experience.<br />music is your friend with 2C-B!!!!&nbsp; it will make the experience.&nbsp; :)<br />i took around 15-20 mg.&nbsp; <br />i plan on introducing my partner to the world of psychedelics with either 2C-B, 2C-I, or ketamine.&nbsp; psychedelics for control freaks.<br /><br />*destiny*

				I agree with the others, 2c-b should be a good introduction to psychedelia.&nbsp; Be somewhere comfortable and safe, put on chill music or movies or whatever you love, and have a great trip.

				21mg of 2cb was pretty underwhelming for me, but I&#039;m rather experienced with the psychs. I recently introduced a friend to psychs with it. It&#039;s very easy to deal with, and it&#039;s also luckily very short-lasting. I was sober in less then 4 hours. I don&#039;t think it entirely captures the psychedelic experience, but it&#039;s a good way to ease into it.

If they don&#039;t have any idea of what a psychedelic experience is it will be hard for them.<br /><br />2c-b is definitely one of the absolute best for introducing people to psychedelics. It has a bit of the psychedelic experience without too much overwhelming introspection. You do need something to do since it isn&#039;t a very introverted drug. You need to be either hanging out with a good friend (and by that I mean watching movies and fucking) or going out to a club.

				I disagree.&nbsp; I think LSD is fine for a first timer.&nbsp; If the dose is moderate enough and you have someone experienced around to guide you should you get lost then you will be fine.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t get lost and end up having a wonderful trip<br /><br />We need to remember the fact that prior to the RC scene it was, at least for me, just acid, shrooms, and maybe a little E if I was very lucky. Oh, and lots o weed.<br /><br />I believe that if someone wants to really ease into the psychedelic exp then 2c-c would be the way to go.

				I am of the opinion that there is no correct &quot;first time&quot; drug. You take psychedelics to learn something. There aren&#039;t really &quot;tiers&quot; of psychedelics, just different effects. You might want to consider what you want out of a trip, then take a drug that will help you get that.<br /><br />For me, 2C-B is a drug that is only to be done with a lover. I do not find it to be enjoyable as a party drug when I am not hooking up. It is wonderful, filled with intense physical pleasure, but the urge to make love was so overwhelming that when I failed to pick up a girl, I went home feeling INCREDIBLY lonely. 2C-B made me get more in touch with my body and more aware of my hedonism, which I now wish to shed. It also made personal conversation (not small talk) more enthralling. It wasn&#039;t trippy, but it was profound. It would have been amazing to do with a girlfriend, because of the potential for intense lovemaking and emotional connection, a potential greater than that of MDMA (at least for me). However, at a party, it simply made me look like a coked out weirdo making O faces.<br /><br />On the other hand, 2C-E made me appreciate nature more, and value western construction less, as well as realize that scary situations are just as much of a life experience as anything else, and that there&#039;s no reason to be afraid - this was my first trip, besides a mistake made with salvia, and it prepared me for every trip since. 2C-E was &quot;trippier&quot; but it was still relatively tame. It was more introspective than visual, but it was still a relatively euphoric trip. Compared to 2C-B which might be good for bonding, 2C-E is better for pondering.<br /><br />Those are just two examples of things you can get out of a trip. I really can&#039;t say that there&#039;s a wrong &quot;first time&quot; drug, except for maybe salvia divinorum which is a very atypical psychedelic and dissociative that doesn&#039;t provide the euphoria most psychedelics do, and can be entirely terrifying. Salvia prevented me from trying other psychedelics for a long time, which stunted the quality of my life.

				I think this drug just doesn&#039;t like me. <br /><br />At 5mg, music annoyed me and I was too distracted to watch a movie. The most entertaining thing to me was a map, looked like a swirly kaleidoscope and I stared at it for a few hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />CEV&#039;s were a little more interesting and I think at some point I fell asleep and had a very vivid dream. But they ended up scaring me for whatever reason (don&#039;t remember what was so scary at the time).

Are you 100% it was 2c-b? 2c-b is always something that kicks in within 30 minutes and lasts a good 3 hours before you are sober.

				Oh wow, if 2c-b doesn&#039;t work out for you, try 2c-i. I found it to be more like mdma and in a lot of ways better. I had this amazing body high that actually enhanced sex (mdma gives you this skin high but it gets distracting and your erotic regions feel muted in comparison). Rolls felt like I was having a full body orgasm with every movement. <br /><br />I found a few other people where the common affects of 2c-i and 2c-b were reversed. I found 2c-b to be really visual and had no body high at all. But it&#039;s more common to experience it the other way around (guess I&#039;m just really special).

				I consider 2C-B as a good first psychedelic, as it doesn&#039;t go too deep but gives some kind of a good preview of how it feels to be on a psychedelic. Another reason is, that after the comedown it&#039;s almost like you haven&#039;t taken anything, even if it was a bad trip or overdose (compared to how fucked up one would be after a bad acid trip).

				As someone who just tried 2c-b for the first time two days ago, I gotta say, it&#039;s not a good introductory psychedelic because it&#039;s just not terribly psychedelic. Don&#039;t buy it if what you&#039;re looking for is visuals and interesting changes in thought. and consciousness.

				Hi there<br /><br />While reading all the previous post I did see some major differences in experience with 2cb. Which is however very common. Some people may find it a very mellow and controllable psychedelic, while others see it as a very potent and strong one. My opinion is that is CAN be very potent and overwhelming. It largely depends on the doses AND you setting in which you take it. I find that when I take a psychedelic (whether it is 2cb or lsd or shrooms) the setting has a very large influence on my trip. When I take a psychedelic in a very calming, quit and relaxing environment I get a very deep, psychic and overwhelming &quot;loosing myself&quot;-feeling. The times I used 2cb it had always shown me some deep thoughts and feelings of myself. It once even demolished my whole being into nothing more than some electrons in a very complex but very wonderful universe. Music was intense and made specially for my feelings at the moment. It was part of the complex cosmos of which I was a small floating electron. (this was with a doses of 20mg!)<br /><br />Be aware that 2cb can definitely be a overwhelming power. But also keep remembering that you can influence the trip a lot. Make the setting as comfortable as possible for the first time. Do it at home with people you know well and love. Also prepare some relax music with lots of layers in it. (shpongle or Shulman for example) And put on some nice lamps (not to bright as 2cb gets very trippy in terms of visuals on higher doses 15mg - 25mg))<br /><br />a good starter doses is around 12mg (you will notice some small visuals and you will feel a slight body load and euphoric feeling but the whole trip is still very controllable). A very strong doses lies around 15mg to 25mg. A strong doses means strong visuals (open AND closed eyed) and it can get very overwhelming for a beginning psychedelic user as you can easily loose control of your thoughts.<br />As you can see that a mild doses and a strong doses lie very close to each other. So you have to weight the 2cb very carefully! Use a sensitive scale to measure it!<br /><br />I hope my advise is somewhat useful. I would say 2cb is as &quot;good&quot; as any other psychedelic to begin with if you be aware that it can be overwhelming. And its good to start with the starter doses of around 12mg for the first time. Its better to &quot;explore&quot; a new drug step by step that to rush in with a high doses. You have plenty of time to do it a second time with a higher doses a few weeks/months later. And don&#039;t believe people who say some particular drug is always mellow and controllable as this can&#039;t be true for every one. Everyone reacts different on drugs and therefor know that every trip can get overwhelming. If you keep this in mind and it should happen to you than you are less likely to feel surprised and overwhelmed by the feeling as you already knew this could happen.<br /><br /><br />Above all I wish you a very good trip! Enjoy as it can be very interesting and empowering!<br /><br />x<br />Peter<br /><br />

				If you&#039;re looking for clear headed visuals, I reckon 2C-C is the perfect introductory psychedelic. Wish I&#039;d discovered it sooner, 40-50mg is a good starter dose. No headfucks and absolutely no negative effects. I love it&nbsp; ;D

				I wouldn&#039;t really recommend 2C-B for one&#039;s first psychedelic. I get slight bodily discomfort and mild nausea at normal doses. At higher doses I suffer from strong nausea, acid reflux, coughing and profound sweating. Also the difference between a dose which barely gives you any psychedelic effects and a dose which is totally overpowering is tiny. I also get a slight MDMA-like comedown from 2C-B and it seems to mess up my sleep rhythm even though I take it pretty early in the day. <br /><br />All that said 2C-B is probably my 2nd favorite drug at the moment; it&#039;s just not perfect in my opinion.<br /><br />What I would recommend is LSD and for pretty obvious reasons.

				For those of you who experience a lot of nausea, try pre-loading with one of those over-the-counter motion sickness tabs 2 hours prior ... it helps A LOT. <br /><br />I prefer 2c-i though I seem to experience it the way everyone else experiences 2c-b (orgasmic body highs, little to no visuals, happy euphoria, etc.).

				Of course price isn&#039;t the only reason. 2C-I already does everything for me that 2C-C does for you and then some; it exceeds MDMA in the touch department. We were just experimenting because hubby wasn&#039;t getting any tactile enhancement on the 2C-I. When we tried 2C-C, I had 20mg and he had 80mg (he&#039;s about your weight). But his experience was even weaker than mine. <br /><br />It&#039;s no big deal; I don&#039;t doubt that it does everything you say it does for you. It just didn&#039;t for either of us.
