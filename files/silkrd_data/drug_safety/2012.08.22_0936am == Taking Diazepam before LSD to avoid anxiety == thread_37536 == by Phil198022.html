				I had my second LSD trip yesterday and it was again very enjoyable. Before I took the LSD I took a Diazepam tablet to take any anxiety I might feel while tripping. Does that reduce the effects of the trip in a major way, or is it an alternative to let&#039;s say drinking some beer before as an anxiolytic, since I don&#039;t want to drink any alcohol? Basically I want to avoid a panic attack while tripping under all costs, but don&#039;t want to reduce the effects of the LSD in a major way.

				as someone who obviously suffers from panic attacks/paranoia should you really be taking psychedelics ?<br />i did find a mention on erowid which said,&nbsp; &quot;However, while some people do keep Valium around to neutralize the effects of LSD in case things get uncomfortable&quot;<br />so im guessing it may kill the trip in a major way..

				I don&#039;t suffer from panic attacks/paranoia in general, but in the case of stimulants like amphetamine I have found that if you do suffer a panic attack while under the influence, euphoric stimulation can quickly turn into a nightmare of panic and fear, which a low dose of Diazepam can prevent. Of course if Diazepam generally destroys the LSD experience, I would at best only take a minimal amount of Diazepam before anyway or not take any before.<br /><br />Clearly in the case of LSD there is also a relatively thin line between euphoria and enjoyment and fear, so Diazepam might be able to calm me down before and just let me sit back and enjoy the ride, basically like drinking one or two beers before, which I don&#039;t want to do however, since I&#039;m trying to quit drinking alcohol in general. Compare it to a roller coast ride: Most people get a kick out of that or they wouldn&#039;t go on rollercoasts, if you suffer from panic during the ride it can turn into a nightmare however, especially if it continues for hours.<br /><br />In the case of MDMA I have found that taking a benzo before really KILLS the experience, and you can just as well not take MDMA if you&#039;ve taken a benzo before, because it&#039;s a waste of time and MDMA, but in the case of LSD I don&#039;t know if it just reduces anxiety or also basically kills the LSD experience.<br /><br /><br />As a second question: Does it make sense to take a second blotter a couple of hours after the first one, or does tolerance develop so quickly that you are just wasting your blotters? Again as a comparison, you can&#039;t just keep taking MDMA several times in a row, because there is no euphoria anymore, but only side effects. Don&#039;t know how that is in the case of LSD.

				i ones took 30mg oxazepam with 25mg 2c-b+1 tab acid suppossed to be an 150-200mcg. the oxazepam&nbsp; took the &quot;thinking or the usual psychedelic thinking away don´t know who i should it describe and you don´t have anxiety &quot; <br />the euphoria and the feelings was about the same... the optic was the only one wich was less but it was also an different setting and daylight so idk if that lowered the optic too<br /><br />30mg oxazepam= 10-15mg diazepam to compare<br /><br /><br />but why don´t you use mdma for that case? it will remove your anxiety and give you more euphoria and better optic -

				I always keep my bottle of Xanax on hand when tripping. You never know when shit can get weird.<br /><br />ALWAYS have an exit strategy, as a sufferer of panic attacks my self.<br /><br />2mg can end a trip.<br /><br />.5 usually suffices.

				Taking a large dose of benzo&#039;s before LSD is like taking a tylenol before hitting yourself in the thumb with a hammer: it might be a good idea in general, but ruin the latter experience to some degree. I&#039;d agree on keeping a sufficient dose of rapid acting benzo around if things go awry, something like 2 mg xanax may knock you straight out of your trip if you are not used to benzo&#039;s. <br /><br />Generally it just isn&#039;t a good idea to take any hallucinogen if you suffer from, even mild, panic or anxiety disorder. Hallucinating may certainly push you over the edge of what is and what is not under your control, and become a very unpleasant experience. While this is not physically harmful directly, I would suggest doing it a couple of times with a trusted friend around to talk you down and even administer sedatives if required. <br /><br />

On second thought, I should have just made her deal with it, she probably could have learned more from the experience. But I didn&#039;t feel like baby sitting as I was tripping my self.<br /><br />I agree and disagree that people with anxiety shouldn&#039;t take psychedelics... I think it is important to work up slowly, and get comfortable with them first for sure. Don&#039;t jump in with both feet. But IMO psychedelics can help people to get over there anxiety and problems. They are great for this.<br /><br />People with schizophrenia and such should not tho.

				I think Valium and acid is a really nice combo.&nbsp; I get pretty severe muscle tension while tripping, and the Valium really helps with that, without effecting the trip.

				i would recommend not taking the diazepam beforehand, but keep it around just in case things start to get too weird :P<br /><br />simply knowing that you have an &quot;escape route&quot; in a benzo can be a calming enough effect by itself

				If it is social interaction that makes you anxious you can try taking Proponalol(sp?) its the beta blockers that stage performers, musicians and public speakers take to alleviate rapid heart rate, sweaty palms and nervousness.

				Beta blockers basically block the mechanism that increases your heart rate when you perform physical labour. This may also alleviate things like palpitations, flushing etc when posed with a challenge like public speaking, but they are by no means recreational drugs or substances to be taken without medical supervision. Take some and try to run for a bit or climb a flight of stairs to witness the adverse effects (you&#039;ll be out of breath in no time, having the condition of an 80 year old).&nbsp; <br /><br />As for making someone deal with a bad trip by not administering sedatives: I can see how that can seem like sending a message &#039;i told you so&#039;, but its generally unwise. A bad trip can cause someone to suffer long lasting negative effects, unlike an alcohol hangover that will make someone feel bad for a day or so and be fine after that. You may regret drinking those last shots of tequila in the morning, but noone deserves to still regret doing so months or years later.
