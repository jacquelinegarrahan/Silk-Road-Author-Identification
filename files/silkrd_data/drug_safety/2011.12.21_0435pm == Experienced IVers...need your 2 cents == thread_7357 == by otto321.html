				Does this look infected to you? I&#039;ve Been IVin some H for the last couple weeks or so, and now developed a pretty nasty track mark. I clean it regularly, maybe twice a day or so with isopropyl and soap and water with a dedicated tooth brush for removing extra scab material and crap. Pretty gross. Note the &quot;hot-dog in the microwave&quot; like splitting on the skin. :P<br /><br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/P1060872.JPG<br /><br />

				Start using an antibiotic ointment like Polysporin onto the wound. It looks like it&#039;s just on the surface so if there is an infection you don&#039;t seem to be in that bad of shape. <br /><br />The redness could be caused by using rubbing alcohol and scrubbing the area, both of which I recommend you stop doing. Using isopropyl alcohol to clean a wound initially is okay, but not repeatedly. I&#039;d also stop brushing it and let it develop scar tissue.<br /><br />The signs you should be looking out for are localized redness, heat, swelling and pain. A couple of those symptoms might be caused by your treatment regime so if these symptoms continue to exist or get worse then you should see a doctor.<br /><br />Edit: It should go without saying that you should stop using that area to IV until it heals. Make sure to use a fresh needle each time, sterilize everything, and rotate veins.

				Go to a doctor. Personally, I don&#039;t think it is anything to be SUPER concerned about, but you definitely aren&#039;t going to help yourself by not going.<br /><br />Think &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;.

				clearly you are just shooting into the same exact spot on your arm over and over making it swiss cheese. your arms should not look like that after shooting drugs for a prolonged period. you should have bruising and pinprick scabs all along your arm. you need to quit using that arm all together for now, and you need to find other veins in your forearm and when you do start closer to the hand and work your way towards the elbow leaving a decent gap between each inection. if you have a hard time finding them here are 3 tips, 1. drink lots of water 2. pump your arm and fist before tying off 3. dont tie the tourniquete too tight, you want to restrict bloodflow not shut it off completly. <br /><br /><br />for gods sake do some research into safe injection practices before its to late.

				Personally I think it&#039;s just from the brush scrubbing. I think it&#039;s what is tearing up the skin tissue...hmmm medium bristle too, yep ???<br /><br />Also, no bruising cause I hit the vein every time. I know I like to brag :D

				Don&#039;t forget to eat fresh fruit, fresh veg and lean meat every day. Your body cannot heal without the correct nutrients. Perhaps consider a multi vitamin to supplement also. Try to avoid fast food. put dettol or tea tree oil on the effected area after each shower/bath to stop infections forming under the scab. Also without saying, use a different vein or consider a different route of administration. The very best option is to leave the city/state/territory/county you are in so you no longer associate with people who use your preferred drug.
