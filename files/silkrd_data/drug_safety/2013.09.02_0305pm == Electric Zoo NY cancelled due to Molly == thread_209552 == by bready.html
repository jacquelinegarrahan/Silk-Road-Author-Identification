				Have you heard this BS?&nbsp; &nbsp;They cancelled the music festival because two people died and immediately the news blames it on Molly.&nbsp; As most of us know Pure MDMA does not kill you with correct dosing, you can end up dehydrated but your not gonna die even if you ingest half a gram at once.&nbsp; Its pretty obvious kids are selling research chems as molly to make more money and kids at these festivals are dying from&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Just another reason SR is the best place on earth, you know exactly what your buying before you get it!

				&nbsp;&quot;you know exactly what your buying before you get it!&quot;<br />If you mean you know that you have exactly no power to know what the vendor sent you on silk road or in walmart if you dont analyze it yourself I agree.<br /><br />If you taught all vendors send exactly the substance they advertise you are wrong and this have been proven many times. Look in topics where coke, mdma etc is lab tested you find out many vendors are caught red handed advertising one product but selling another. <br /><br />Stores in my part of the world recently took a product advertised as &quot;honey&quot; off the shelves because it was a sugar mix with honey flavour, not actual honey and the news are filled with similar stories. Don&#039;t be naive.<br />

				Yeah i was mad when i found out. But on the contrary there have been numerous accounts of vendors on SR selling Methylone as MDMA and alot of them got away with it for a long time and some are still getting away with it. Its a shame. thats why you should always have reagent tests handy.

				Um, get some drug test kits, (marquis, mecke, mandellin, simons, ehrlich, Liebermann), do your research on vendors, and you have a damn good chance of finding what you want on here. Also order sample amounts first so if you do get burned its small.<br /><br />&lt;3

				I understand what you mean.<br />When you can keep it from reaching the people at the event, then it should be fine. It&#039;s (just) a moral thing for the staff then.<br /><br />But when it happens in front of the people it&#039;s hard to go on. That was my point. You can not compare TV to a festival of course.

				This is NYC. You have to understand this. Stopping an event in NY after 9/11 takes a call to the right office. That is about it. Figure in the recent events in Boston, and the August scare on embassies, as well as the recent issues escalating, the &quot;agencies&quot; and city planners are already on edge. Two kids dying, whether it was from a spontaneous event like a sudden aneurism, or from a seratonin storm after actually taking too much MDMA (which, is possible, you can reach seratonin toxicity, don&#039;t say you can&#039;t.), doesn&#039;t matter. They died. End of the story.<br /><br />The country has a history with this. The hells angels have basically been marked in history for a moment that ended the summer of love and catapulted them from what was just a gang of post-war veterans enjoying their bikes, to meth dealing murderers. Practically every huge band has a marred record - some bands even broke up over the fact. It&#039;s a terrible thing, and at the risk of sounding insensitive it ruins the fun. Not only would it be disrespectful, it&#039;d be depressing. You&#039;d have a fleet of cops at every possible point, undercover everywhere, if you took out your inhaler you&#039;d get popped - all for asthma.<br /><br />This is tragic, but its also why I tend to stay clear of the major events in places like NY. I might like some of the talent, but at the same time, I find local talent that is just as freaking awesome... and I can go to see them at a trustworthy venue, a private house, or something else. Every so often a big name comes for a good night outside of a festival, and I get my enjoyment then... but otherwise, epic events in America are most unsafe for our culture right now.

				I would say that it is hard to blame 2 deaths on a bad batch from a vendor. Especially for an event of such scale, others have had to ingested the same molly.<br /><br />Because the deaths were so low as compared to those who attended.

It seems that many have the misconception that getting medical attention will get them in trouble or cost them money. But that is not how it works. THe medical staff only care about your safety and as long as you are treated early enough to not need to go to the hospital, the service is fully paid for by the event and you will be released to continue raging once you get better. So the key lies in somehow educating all the ravers that seeking medical help is not your last and final option but a safe choice that should be your first option.

It is extremely easy to get rid of pills at festivals... And nobody would bring a reagent test to a festival.<br />Hundreds of people could be killed. A terrorist attack of sorts. I am half expecting this to happen sometime in the future and it is not a nice thought, but it could easily be done.<br /><br />Legalise drugs! Then deaths will stop happening. It will be safest for everybody.<br />When we buy drugs at a chemist, we know exactly what we are getting. Not the same story for pills. Could be anything.<br />Always test your drugs!

				The same thing came to mind when I heard this. &quot;There is NO WAY those kids were on X.&quot; I&#039;m assuming they took other shit with it or it was sold to them as X and the dealer mixed up capsules or did the shit on purpose. Either way it&#039;s a tragedy and is just another mark on responsible users everywhere. I must say though that dancesafe.org, The Lycaeum, and Erowid, did a lot to start the push for more safer drug use and I think society as a whole has come a long way at staying safe. Sucks they died though. I wonder if there will be a toxicology report?

I was there as well and it was very fishy on saturday when they went around the stages telling people to stay hydrated. I knew something was up. last year it was ALL AGES, only 100 seeked medical condition. this year being 18+ and 300 people. Ill probably go next year but its going to be a BITCH to sneak in my joints.
