				It was my first time taking any NBOMe; I took one of Kwiktrip&#039;s 550ug tab. History: I take ghb on occasion, mdma 3x, mda 1x, 2c-i 2x and I am a small female @100 lbs. <br /><br />I should also mention that my last MDMA roll was the night before. <br /><br />First impression: 25i is a long trip. Normally when I see trip reports saying that their trips last 6-8 hours, I fall into the lower range if not less. But this time I wasn&#039;t even slowing down by the 6-hour mark. I tripped myself to sleep (with the help of some ghb, haha) ... I highly recommend the combination by the way. I could tell that I would have been way too hyped and probably anxious during the come-up if I didn&#039;t take the ghb too (just a small anti-anxiety dose @1g ... these are AJAPAI&#039;s liquid ghb). <br /><br />8:30pm - Placed tab between gums and upper lip for 30 minutes before swallowing it with orange juice. There was some bitterness towards the end but it wasn&#039;t too strong. <br /><br />9:00pm - I started to feel minor buzzing and tinglings, a feeling that &quot;something&quot; was different and changing. When asked how, I said I didn&#039;t know and was probably just coming up. I take a small dose of ghb (by AJAPAI) to keep me calm and lessen the body load. It helped. <br /><br />9:30 - 10:00pm - The come-up started to speed up. I felt very energized and wanted to do something physically active. I turned on some music once the ghb started to kick in. I start to mellow out a bit and enjoy the ride. <br /><br />10:30pm - @12:30pm - I watched a movie (Percy Jackson) while pausing to stare into the walls and ceilings on occasion for very melty and shrinky-dink type visuals. <br /><br />12:30pm - 2:30am - I decided to enjoy the music a bit more while allowing it to morph my visuals around ... Setting really plays a big part in how you react to this one. Just from walking from my living-room to my bedroom, I could feel a shift in mood and visuals. I wanted to go out to see more but I was laughing pretty loud and didn&#039;t want to disturb my neighbors. It wasn&#039;t so much a drunk kind of happy-giggle, more so the genuine deep laughs you get that result in tears. I found it cathartic and didn&#039;t fight it. I thought this time period was great and was pleased with the overall experience by now. At some point I eat thinking I was due to come down &quot;any minute now.&quot;<br /><br />2:30am - It was the 6 hour mark and I was still going strong. I turned off the music and lights to be more aware of any signs of a comedown but the visuals started getting stronger and I felt like my mind was buzzing with a million thoughts rushing through and past me. I kept getting very vivid and bright CEV&#039;s flashing into my mind as I drifted off to sleep. I take some ghb to help me sleep (and glad I did) ... The last time I saw my clock it was passed 3am. <br /><br />I close my eyes talking about what I&#039;m seeing in the hopes I remember them in the morning. The most memorable was this lotus flower in the middle of a body of water with a huge moon overhead. I could see the water rippling as I ran my fingers along the water. At one point I started to rush past this scene and felt like I was flying over the world. I also remember electricity-like lines and spots like a really old 80&#039;s movie trying to be &quot;cool&quot; or imagine what visual affects would look like in our time. <br /><br />7:30am - Woke up. At first I wasn&#039;t sure if I was sober; I was thinking clearly and visuals were gone but I felt oddly alert and energized (kind of expected a hangover after having been up so late) ... so I checked and found my pupils and coordination to be back to baseline. My thought process seems to be flowing very generously and had to fight the urge to go out for a run because I knew I put my body through a lot this weekend and really had to take it easy. It seemed as though the part of my brain that the 25i opened up was still firing off extra synapses. If I were an artist I would be spending the day playing music, painting, etc. I can see artists being attracted to this one. <br /><br />12:30pm - I receive some company and I am far more sociable than normal. I am chatting the time away and having a good time doing it. It&#039;s odd how open and carefree I saw myself. I&#039;m normally more reserved. <br /><br />9:00pm - My mind is calmer than this morning. I still feel sharper than usual, more focused and driven. I was able to get errands done though did make it a point to take a nap and not do anything too physically challenging. <br /><br />In comparison to 2c-i ... 25i was more mind altering; it turned my head into a few bee hives of information and reception rather than one bee buzzing around a world of information. 2c-i is more bodily and enhances my sense of touch and taste making physical contact a very enjoyable experience. 25i is also social but it&#039;s more wanting to share the experience with someone else rather than wanting to explore another person. I suppose I could have tried to direct my thoughts more but by the end I was just too dispersed. I don&#039;t know if the afteraffects have to do with the MDMA the previous day or the back-to-back combo but I&#039;ll be trying the 25i at least once more over the next month to find out. <br /><br />My husband ended up liking this more than me, he says 2c-i is more mind altering for him and couldn&#039;t stop his thoughts from shifting around. With the 25i, he was more interested in doing things rather than thinking about things.

				Ooh, I just remembered some of my CEV&#039;s, at least the ones I got while hubby was touching me. They were like tesla rod lights that branched off into fractals and kept branching off. I would close my eyes and see light coming out of his fingertips and the light was piercing through me, relaxing all my muscles. <br /><br />Anyway, hope I remember more. I definitely need to take a half tab next time so I can stay a bit more focused and remember more details of the trip itself. I can remember what I did for the most part but so many thoughts going through my head, I can hardly remember a fraction of what I saw.

So probably if you waited another hour you&#039;d start coming down ;)

				Yeah I gotta try this earlier in the day. It felt like it was just getting better towards the end. Or maybe I was finally relaxed enough to enjoy and explore it more.&nbsp;
