				To all of you who have taken products from the 2C-family<br />and to all of you who think about taking products from the 2C-family:<br />I&#039;d love to get as much information as possible about all the different 2C-products on this page, except 2C-B (because there&#039;s already a great page full of info about that here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.0). <br /><br />So this page is for 2C-E, 2C-I, 2C-whatever... (it&#039;s a long list, excuse me for keeping it short&nbsp; ;D ). <br /><br />I&#039;m especially intersted in: dosages (and effects @ different dosages), combinations with other products, dangers or possible health issues after consumption, special experiences you&#039;ve had and so on... <br /><br />I hope lots of people have lots of info about those 2C-...

				Most of the 2cx series are what could be called part psychedelics. They are all about visuals and body highs, no real change in you thought patterns. LSD without the soul is a good analogy for the series as a whole.&nbsp; That said many people my self and sasha shulgin included have found 2ce to be an outlier in this series. I would consider it in the same league as lsd, mushrooms, mescaline and dmt. It truly is a consciousness expanding chemical and not just something that gets you high with some pretty visuals. Its also much harder to dose, 2mg supposedly doubles the intensity and i think that holds true. 2cb for me was like psychedelic ambien, very dreamy with pastel colors and not much else. 2ci was very visual but with a intense body load that i found overly uncomfortable. 2c-t-7 is said to be one of the most profoundly visual chemicals but it also has had several deaths attributed to its MOAI property&#039;s, i have no experience with the 2c-t series.

				if you want euphoria then drink a liter of 5% beer before 2c-b then when the after effects come when everything seems brighter have another liter.. I did that not so long ago and I had very good euphoria was just laying on bed and drinking beer during those after-effects. and I know what euphoria is since I have experience with IV cocaine, IV d-meth (crystal), IV heroin, IV heroin/cocaine.

				Hmmm... I&#039;ve never really considered opiates for this. Kratom does help a little now that I think about it. I&#039;ve been wanting to try Spanish opium, I think I&#039;ll give it a go. Thanks for the idea!

				Hey guys we&#039;re a new vendor of 2C-E in the UK. Don&#039;t mean to shill for myself but I&#039;ve done a few of the 2C&#039;s although mostly 2C-B and 2C-E. <br /><br />As far as I know the main risk that 2C-E previously carried was that there were a few places selling Bromo dragonfly as 2C-E, BromoDF is a lot strong if I remember rightly. <br /><br />Dose wise the erowid.org charts are pretty much bang on. Snorted doses of 2C-E are MUCH smaller than oral doses and hurt for about 10-15 minutes. The advantage of snorting is that the trip is shorter at about 6hrs and come up is much quicker. This is pretty much universal for most drugs but you really notice the difference with 2C-E (most of this applies for other 2Cs as well) <br /><br />For dosing I recommend volumetric dosing as the powder is quite fluffy and has a habit of sticking to items you use so for example 100mg into 100ml so you can dose by the ml (orally or snorted). <br /><br />I personally think whoever originally said 2C-E is the LSD of the 2C-xs is correct.

				for those who are interested in 2c&#039;s <br />i would highly recommend 2c-i<br />try about 20-22mg<br />it will be quite strong at that dose, for medium maybe go around 16-18mg<br />anything lower for me is quite boring<br />its very fun, full of visuals CEV and OEV<br />very very colorful, music/sex/etc great<br />amazing to combine with mdma. for me it is one of the best or probably the best i have tried<br />i enjoyed 23mg 2ci + 140 mg mdma better than 1.5tabs lsd + 140mg mdma<br />i will candy flip another time with more lsd and im sure it will be better but 2ci is fantastic<br />have done doses from 16mg-70mg<br />i do not recommend going over 30mg. if you find 20-22mg weak and you want it stronger go for 25-30mg <br />dont think doubling it to 40-44mg will double the effects, it will more likely quadruple it. <br />its strong and intense but fun also at those high doses<br /><br />2ct7 is another i have tried. only go orally and never snort<br />18-22mg is fantastic. i saw visions of mountains snakes etc. energy was flowing all over my body<br />body high similar to mescaline / mushrooms <br />high visuals and tracers<br />only tried it a few times because of the duration (12hours)

				also have tried 2cb at 20-23mg doses and i found it kinda boring and not as great as i expected but i probably just need to take more<br /><br />also for those who are interested in 2c&#039;s ONLY BUY IF YOU HAVE A 0.000g SCALE<br />these milligram dosages are not to be messed with. <br />also handling the powder must be handled with care. any accidental sniffing or whatever and you can be tripping hard<br />snorting these is also a very bad idea and is not worth it<br />effects are not better and side effects are worse<br /><br />

				2C-E is my favorite.&nbsp; I like it mixed with 2C-T-2.&nbsp; 2C-T-7 gives me nausea.&nbsp; 2C-I is weak.&nbsp; I like 30 to 60mg of 2C-E snorted.&nbsp; I never puke on it but everyone else I know does.&nbsp; I like to trip hard.<br /><br />I have taken over 150mg of 2C-E.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t colors and designs anymore.&nbsp; I thought everything I saw seeing was real.&nbsp; It was bad.<br /><br />I really like to mix them.&nbsp; It brings out fireworks of color, designs and patterns EVERYWHERE you look! :D&nbsp; More so than on just one 2C substance by itself.

				I&#039;ve tested 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-E, and found that the combination of 18mg 2C-I + 25mg 2C-B is an incredibly amazing visual experience without too bad of a body load.&nbsp; Both drugs by themselves aren&#039;t too strong, but when I mix 2Cs it seems to create a full-rounded trip, instead of feeling like there&#039;s something missing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried 2C-E and found it to be too speedy and long lasting for my taste, but I did enjoy the heavy visuals it gave me.&nbsp; 2C-B doesn&#039;t give me a lot of visuals even at high doses, but 2C-I and 2C-E have both made my ceiling flow like an ocean.&nbsp; 40mg 2C-B is my personal favorite dose of the 2Cs because of it&#039;s highly sexual tactile properties and body high.&nbsp; My experience with 2Cs (and Mescaline) have always been extremely easy for me to deal with as they don&#039;t really affect my ego too much.&nbsp; They usually give me a speedy, psychedelic haze, and I always seem to compare 2C-B and 2C-I to drinking psychedelic coffee.&nbsp; Of course these affect everyone differently.&nbsp; Hoping to try 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 very soon!!
