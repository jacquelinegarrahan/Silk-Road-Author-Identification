				A while back i did some ket but for some unknown reason &#039;dabbed&#039; it rather then snorting it :-\ i also had red-bull, and beer. All this done on a empty stomach. The following morning i woke up with horrible stomach cramps, to the point where i couldn&#039;t stand straight. My immediate thoughts were that it was the red bull and beer that i had consumed on a empty stomach. These cramps subsided 1-2 days after (thank fuck). I saw today that &#039;K-Cramps&#039; are common for long time users, yet this was my first time taking it?&nbsp; I was just wondering do you lot think it was the K or the redvull/beer that gave me these cramps? its just&nbsp; Ive got a gram of ket for this weekend, and if it is the ket that caused it im steering well clear. <br />Thankyou&nbsp; :D

				Slim chance on the K cramps, in your case anyway.. Cause ive been using K for over a decade now, not always so heavily, bu enough, and I will occasionally get some slight pains in my lower abdominal region, but only while im still high, as my trip subsides, so does the cramp.<br /><br />&nbsp;More likely in your case that you had serious gas pains from all the carbonation on an empty stomach. Back when i was a kid i got gas pains so terribly unbearable, that i would have to go the hospital for some prescription gas relief pill. Much love dude.

				Most dissociatives, especially K have been known to cause problems with people&#039;s kidneys. Have a friend place his hand on your lower back just under the rib cage and hit it with the other hand and see if you feel any pain. This could be a sign of kidney tenderness.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t feel pain at all this doesn&#039;t mean you have no kidney issues and I&#039;m just guessing that the problem could be your kidneys to begin with.<br /><br />hope you feel better&nbsp; ;)
