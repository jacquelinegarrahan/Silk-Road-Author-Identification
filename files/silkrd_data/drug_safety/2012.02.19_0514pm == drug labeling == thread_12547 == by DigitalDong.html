				why dont vendors label their products? even if they would use a code unique to them or something?&nbsp; <br />I order lots of different products from different vendors. and when mail slips up and slows things down this can be a real issue. <br />funny story.... was waiting on a package containing coke from a EU vendor country unknown. I get this package form the NL so i assumed it was that one.. i opened package pulled out white substance.. looked a lil different than most coke i have ever seen. but what the hell.. ( alot of the stuff going around now is washed so i figured it mite be due to that..) i put out a memedium-average size rail out and toot it.. it burned a little at first and i was like WTF .. the burn continued to get worse until 10 or 15 mins later.. the only thing that went thru my mind is .. wtf is this .. omg i didnt receieve a package of 2cb last month.. almost 60 days in transit!&nbsp; then i remember all the times i read about the infamous burn of 2cb! i thought oh shit i just did way tooo much 2cb and i did.. i was not prepared for this shit.. i was still trying to finish up work.. holy shit.. the visiuals off of that much 2cb im going to guess it was 50 mg of 2cb.. it was about 1/2 of what should have been 100 mg of 2cb.. i have done acid plenty&nbsp; times never really saw shot that wasnt there .. until this night.. i walked outside and it was like a starwars movie those green and red lasers were every where.. i was going into hyperspace like one of the pilots.. visuals were just as strong with eyes closed or open it didnt matter.. .. ... i did panic a few times.. and too me was a waste of a trip seeing as i was not able to go outdoors and enjoy nature having to do ( or pretend to try to do) remedial tasks.....<br />PLEASE VENDORS LETS MARK OUT PRODUCTS!&nbsp; is this something to silly to ask?<br /><br />maybe i should learn a lesson for trying to do blow and work :P.. i have a new found respect for 2cb.. i had no idea how similar it was to lsd .. the visuals were more colorful in my opinion and it was like ronald mcdonald was in the main theme of the trip in the corner of my eye... making the visuals flow and ebb .. anyways&nbsp; <br />

				That sounds horrifying. But I think the main concern for the vendor would be giving away their identity. It&#039;s the whole POINT that no one can trace a package back to the vendor. I can&#039;t really think of a way to label what something was that an overly paranoid person could not pick apart.<br /><br />It&#039;s not really the vendor&#039;s fault you don&#039;t know what&#039;s coming.. But I did something very similar one time, I was waiting excitedly for an order from meth from a new vendor and one day I got a card in the mail. It was a Thank You card with a bag filled with white powder taped to the inside of it. I rushed home and loaded my pipe, melted it and it turned to thick sticky brown oil. I was so pissed off because I thought I had been ripped off by the meth guy, but then about an hour later I remembered I was also waiting on a free sample of MXE. Needless to say I felt like a total dolt, but I was glad to have not been ripped off lol... :)

				Another issue is that if your buying an illegal RC such as 2c-b I certainly won&#039;t label it as such. That is because if the package gets open they will most likely just reagent test it and if it comes back negative as being Coke, MDMA, etc or comes back positive at being a 2c they will probably just trash it or clear it just assuming its an uncontrolled RC.
