				I was at a party on the weekend and I was shown something that I had never seen before. It was a giant rock of MDMA. I&#039;ve seen crystals a couple mm in size but this thing was about 2-3 cm in diameter and it was completely solid! It was somewhat shaped because people had been cutting away at it with razors, but also had bits breaking off.<br /><br />In colour it was definitely translucent with a brown hue, the very center of it looked completely brown but when bits had been scraped off it looks more like the Molly I&#039;d seen before.<br /><br />I have never seen MDMA like this and I&#039;m inclined to think that it wasn&#039;t. However, it turns out I had been given some the week before as a trade, only it had been stuff scraped off the mother rock. It looked relatively normal at the time and it seemed just right at a 100 mg dosage (I&#039;m a small guy)<br /><br />Any explanation on A) was this MDMA and B) what it&#039;s story is?

				it&#039;s definitely MDMA, it has to do with the crystallization process. dopeboy sells similar, though more white in appearance and typically he crushes it before shipping.
