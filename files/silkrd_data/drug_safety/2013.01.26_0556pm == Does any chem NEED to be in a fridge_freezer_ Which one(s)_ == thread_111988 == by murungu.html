				I know of the top of my head that LSD keeps very well in the freezer. seal it up and put it in the back.

				<br /><br />the blotter acid: if you plan to hold it for long. also no light , moisture or air. <br />same goes for the mush. But thats a lot less fragile. Just keep it away from moisture heat and light... no need to freeze it. <br /><br />NBOMe - chemicals should stay potent on bedroom temperatures. i dont really know about degradation from heat, air or light...<br /><br />5- meo-mipt i think this one is durable too. same rules as the NBOMe-s.&nbsp; <br /><br />GHB _: no idea. should be fine. <br /><br />weed- hash: keep it dry... <br /><br />you should only store stuff in the freezer if you want to hold it for a long time

				for almost every (pure) chemical these are 3 good rules for preservation:<br />- keep it away from (sun)light<br />- keep it dry<br />- keep it at a constant temperature<br /><br />to my opinion, keeping in a fridge has those 3 advantages...<br />and you always know where to look for it&nbsp; ;D<br />(this last one can come handy when you want to party, but also if you need to get rid of everything very quickly!)

				Nice thread, when you say long and short how long is it? something more precise, could someone store lsd air sealed dry without light but in a closet for say 3 months? As it starts going bad it just loses strength ?<br />Are nBomes and other analogs easier to store / less sensitive?

				I&#039;ve kept LSD for almost 10 years. <br />Sealed in a dry wooden box between some black tourmaline (= gems). <br />To my opinion: it only got better (just too bad that it&#039;s all gone now&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; )<br /><br />But I think I&#039;ve found somewhere that LSD is a very stable molecule (thus easy to store/keep/...)

If you keep it away from light, oxygen, moisture, and heat though it will keep for a very long time. (which is why your dry wooden box acid was still great).
