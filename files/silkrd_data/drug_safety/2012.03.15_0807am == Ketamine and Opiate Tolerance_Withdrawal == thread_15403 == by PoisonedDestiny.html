				i&#039;ve read alot of intriguing reports about MXE and ketamine affecting opiate tolerance.&nbsp; i suppose the NMDA action has something to do with it, possibly by propagating endogenous opioid receptors in the user?&nbsp; <br />i&#039;ve also heard it can help kill physical addiction to opiates.&nbsp; i&#039;ve read different things, but some suggest very low doses (10 to 15 mg) a couple times a day after complete termination of opiate use will prevent withdrawal.&nbsp; and instead of delaying it (like opiate replacements) it literally overwrites it.&nbsp; <br />anyone had experience using it for either purpose?&nbsp; <br /><br />*destiny*

				Ketamine is the best drug for opiate withdrawal. Just go cold turkey on whatever opiate and take small doses of Ketamine to counteract the withdrawal. Continue for about a week and then quit the Ketamine and your cured.

				IIRC ketamine is converted in your stomach into a more opiate-like version, and so oral administration is very effective for withdrawal treatment. I think it&#039;s called like norketamine or something like that. That might only be DXM, though...

				thanks everyone.&nbsp; oral route does seem like best for this use.&nbsp; i understand it increases duration which seems as though it would enhance the opiate withdrawal suppression.<br /><br />i wonder why this isn&#039;t medically accepted?&nbsp; seems far more painless then using replacement or maintenance therapy<br />i remember being put under for a tooth extraction.&nbsp; they used fentanyl and a benzo (along with N2O and propolene) to put me under.&nbsp; then i got two shots of K when i started to wake up twice during.&nbsp; <br />when i finally came to i was in a K hole and still exploding with fentanyl euphoria.&nbsp; hehe it was amazing.<br /><br />*destiny*

				DO NOT TAKE KETAMINE ORALLY!<br /><br />It metabolises into norketamine which is highly alkaline. This will cause intense pain in your stomach for days, you will be lucky if you can walk with such pain. It is better to just insuffulate and re-dose as required.
