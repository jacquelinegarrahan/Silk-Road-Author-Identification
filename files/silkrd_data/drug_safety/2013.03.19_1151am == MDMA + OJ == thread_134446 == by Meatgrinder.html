				Hello,<br /><br />Been reading a few clear net sites about mixing MDMA and orange juice - to help the absorption and more intense effects, so many people sitting on different sides of the fence. Searched these forums, didn&#039;t find any matches :/ <br /><br />So, SR users, what is your opinion on the above topic?<br /><br />OJ good or OJ bad?

				I&#039;ve drunk OJ with my Molly plenty of times but I&#039;ve never really found anything to be different. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen people report that it&#039;s ruined the MD, and I&#039;ve seen people say it enhanced it. MY experience says it does nothing to me personally.<br /><br />Only one way for you to know what it does for you; try it.&nbsp; :)

				MDMA is absorbed best in an alkaline environment (why plugging can be more effective than swallowing). I would say that OJ would inhibit the absorption of MDMA due to its acidity. Even preloading Vitamin C can interfere (why I like ascorbyl palmitate form).

				I have never noticed it to help the high... I have seen people get high on the placebo effect though. <br />The high from MDMA is very responsive to your frame of mind and environmental cues overall.. But vitamin c.. not really.<br /><br />I had a customer once who came to me with sooo much VIt C in him that his urine was crystallizing.

				No placebo effect here guys, whether or not some ones notices or not. The vitamin C inn the OJ or candy or emergen-c tablets, they all make you blow up immediately. For those who dont think so, try a roll, dont smoke pot or ingest any vitamin C, once you definitively begin to roll, take a nice swig of some OJ or my fav pineapple juice. Then tell me its placebo effect.<br /><br />&nbsp;Same applies for mushy&#039;s.. The vitamin C immediately turns the psilosybin, to psyclobin.

				Well unfortunately whether or not you guys agree, is besides the point. Yes everyone body chemistry is far different, and yes I have friends that feel nothing from taking vitamin C with their MDMA, but 8/10 people that I see rolling, ingesting some form of vitamin C, candy or OJ or grapefruit juice or w.e,&nbsp; all begin to peak all over again immediately. THe eyes flutter, the teeth chatter, dry heaves, the whole 9. <br /><br />&nbsp;Im by no means suggesting that i know the science of this effect, im simply stating what 15+years of MDMA has showed me. <br /><br />&nbsp;What about the mushrooms, and the OJ rapidly converting the psilocybin to psilobin?<br /><br />EDIT: copied and pasted from bluelight: <br /><br />it&#039;s not the vit C in the OJ or Grapefruit juice that&#039;s good for the roll..Your stomach should be slightly acidic, and grapefruit juice inhibits a set of liver enzymes that MDMA uses to be metabolized (less enzymes = less MDMA metabolized = more MDMA in the blood)<br /><br />EDIT; it seems your right about the antioxidants decreasing absorption of the MDMA. Still i stand by my statement that OJ boosts your roll after the peak effects subside. The enigma that is the body. LOL

				Well, lets agree to disagree then.. If you want oj, then drink oj... at least it isn&#039;t bad for you. I could indeed be wrong.<br /><br />And to all you new users out there.. don&#039;t skimp on your mdma because you bought a bottle of vitamin c then blow up your dealers phone at an ungodly hour because you want another pill at the end of your night.

				And I believe we might be talking about two different things. OJ when you swallow your MDMA, vs. OJ after you&#039;re rolling (therefore have already absorbed it). I was speaking to OJ when you take it, which will inhibit the absorption due to its acidity. MDMA is better absorbed in a higher pH environment (plugging). This is not a perceived effect, but a property of the pharmacodynamics of the substance. <br /><br />Grapefruit juice is a different matter. It contains narinijin which inhibits your liver&#039;s ability to break the drugs down. Don&#039;t ever do this. It may harm your liver and you. <br /><br />I agree with Sirius. There doesn&#039;t seem to be anything proven to make your roll more magic (there&#039;s anecdotal evidence about piracetam). There are things to inhibit it. There are things to make it safer.

				Yeah I&#039;ve never noticed a higher high as a result of taking it with OJ or taking OJ during the roll. I used to have a girlfriend who swore by it but I could never tell a difference. If you want to get the most out of the drug plug it. Short of IV there really is no better way to get it inside your body but I&#039;m not quite willing to learn how to IV just for a bigger rush and a shorter high. <br /><br />I&#039;m trying piracetam to see if it has any effect but I&#039;m a skeptic. I&#039;m pretty darn sure if you want better rolls you are better off just spacing them out a bit and going into them with the right attitude. You can drink all the OJ or take all the piracetam you want but if you roll every week or take some MDMA with a person you hate you&#039;re gonna have less fun than you otherwise could.
