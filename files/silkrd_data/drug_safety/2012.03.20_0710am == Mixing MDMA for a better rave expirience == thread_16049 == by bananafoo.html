				I&#039;ve got a bit of MDMA and while I love the feeling it gives me I find it a touch lethargic for a rave/concert. I&#039;m aware of people mixing MDMA with speed, caffeine, MDA, etc for pills so I&#039;m wondering what the best ratios/mixers are?

				I get the same with MD and I stopped raving on it and started using mephedrone. Used to end up sitting down rather than dancing with MD but with mephedrone I can&#039;t stop. <br />Little bumps of speed might help, I&#039;ve never tried it though.<br />Would end up with a killer comedown though

				For raving I always go 1:1 MDMA:speed. Sure the comedown is a bitch but what do you expect when you&#039;ve been gurning your face off, dancing and sweating for 6-8 hours :D<br /><br />Go hard or go home.

				40:60 MDA:MDMA.<br /><br />MDA has a solid stimulant edge which will keep you dancing for hours and has a satisfyingly long duration, if you redose then just take MDMA. Redosing MDA seems to give a hard come down.

				Best bet for a long event is the time tested combination of taking a moderate dose (15-20mg) of 2c-b soon after your peak of MDMA (about 3-4 hours in). <br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to take piracetam.

				I enjoy 100:10 MDMA:2ci. The MDMA usually wears off at the two hour mark which is when the 2ci kicks into gear and at such a low dose it pretty much turns into MDMA except with more awesome visuals.

				On one night and one day rave, I&#039;ll go with one or two LSD blotters with 4-5 lines of Speed ( depends on the mood ) and switch to Molly in the morning with some coke&nbsp; ( a little cause it stops Molly effect -&gt; 85(MD):15(C) ) and when back home ( 7 or 8 pm ) a little Valium or Lexomil for a really goood sleep =)<br />The best part is when the LSD is leaving and Molly is coming ... With the good music on the morning &amp; the sun, totally love it !

If you can get your hands on some MDA, MDMA+MDA = epic night. <br /><br />I understand why people are recommending speed/meth to make an amazing roll. This is true, you will have an amazing night, but as an experienced user, I cannot recommend a combination like this. The potential harm severely outweighs the experience. The comedown, the effect on the brain, etc... not worth it at all IMO. <br /><br />

				Yeah, I also wouldn&#039;t suggest MDMA and Meth. Maybe the weaker which is just speed. like 80:20 MDMA:Speed. <br />But yes, mdma and lsd or mdma and k are a good mix. Although if you intend on doing some serious dancing, don&#039;t do too much k because you won&#039;t be doing too much dancing. But just enough to feel like your feet don&#039;t hurt after dancing for the last 2-3 hrs.

				Forget MDMA, I find that 15mg of 2c-i and 10mg of 2c-e is like a candy flip. It&#039;s visual as fuck and fairly energetic. <br />Just watch out, I personally have trip out hard enough (with this mix) that I didn&#039;t remember things and came to with a chipped front tooth.

				I think you&#039;re talking about M1. I&#039;ve only tried 2C-I and I wasn&#039;t that impressed with it. I took a low dose and I&#039;m kind of happy that I did. I&#039;m interested in 25i-nbome(sp?) And mxe and 4aco-dipt. I forgot which one it was that I was reading about and it sounded interesting. But I&#039;m also into things that are more like mdma and mda.
