				I&#039;m sure there have been threads about this but I couldn&#039;t find any answers that satisfied me.&nbsp; My buddy got some 4mg Dilly&#039;s and a couple clean needles.&nbsp; I have never shot anything and he has only shot tar. We have no wheel filters and I&#039;d say just assume we both have no IV experience. What do we need to know?&nbsp; Tips?&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t even know how to find a vein although like I said he spent a summer shooting tar so maybe he is a pro at that.

				Well crush the pill, put sterile in a disinfected spoon or other container, stir with the plunger of the syringe (don&#039;t touch the plunger before doing that), and add no heat!! Don&#039;t cook it. You should then use a wheel filter because injecting without one isn&#039;t very good. Filter though cotton twice if you really can&#039;t get a wheel filter, preferably sterile cotton but no cigarette filters or anything like that. I&#039;d say order some wheel filters, they&#039;re not very expensive. <br /><br />To find a vein, make a fist while making a tourniquet. You should also disinfect the area around the vein you&#039;re gonna use. The key is using sterile things and filtering insoluble shit out. Also, 4mg is a nice dose, if you&#039;re not tolerant use between 2 and 4mg.

				Yes I realize that we oughta use a filter and if it was up to me I&#039;d wait but unfortunately it is not up to me and he has his heart set on tonight.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never really understood how to use cotton as a filter.&nbsp; I know that it is not ideal but it is really our only option.&nbsp; So 4mg would be a good dose for me?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done any serious opiates in around 3 months.&nbsp; I did have a pretty good habit for awhile then but I have never IV&#039;d.

You&#039;ve probably already done it but to use cotton as a filter just drop a tight little cotton ball in your spoon and draw your liquid through the cotton. If your friend has shot tar before he&#039;d know anyway... I hope you didn&#039;t cotton fever :P Or something worse like an embolism.. If you shot a clear solution though it&#039;s kind of fine, but only kind of.

				I guess the only thing I can add, that hasn&#039;t been said already is that Dilaudid has some seriously dwarf fucking legs.&nbsp; Also, if these pills are generic, then the 4&#039;s will have ALOT of filler.&nbsp; Shit, even the 8&#039;s have alot of filler IMHO.
