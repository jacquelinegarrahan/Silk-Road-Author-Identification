				if so what&#039;s it like? my friends are happy to do weed or salvia (NEVER AGAIN) with me but won&#039;t try LSD because it&#039;s class A, so I&#039;m doing it alone tomorrow, but oh well it&#039;s them missing out haha ;) but yeah they said they&#039;d do 4-AcO-DMT as I told them technically it isn&#039;t even illegal.<br /><br />I was interested in these http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/8bd7ffc28a but i&#039;m not familiar with the term smarties, is that just pills?<br /><br />cheers guys,<br />yovvit.

				Have you ever done shrooms? For me, 4-AcO-DMT is a lot like shrooms, but more mellow and less nauseating - though more nauseating than LSD, which hardly ever gives me any stomach discomfort.. It&#039;s very different from LSD. I get many more CEVs and visual distortions (mostly pulsations and colored tracers) on 4-AcO-DMT, and it also makes me kind of giddy. LSD puts me in a more serene and introspective mood, and the few visual distortions I get are of a different kind. 4-AcO-DMT causes a little bit of gas, lasts less than half the amount of time as LSD and the trip is easier to &quot;Put on hold&quot; in case some pressing matter requires your sober-ish attention.<br /><br />All in all, I think it&#039;s a very fun psychedelic, whereas LSD is more of a serious business trip.

				I was afraid of shrooms for that reason - the nausea. When I did LSA the nausea was unbearable and I held down vomiting but as a result I couldn&#039;t sleep for 2 nights because I felt so sick haha.<br /><br />but thank you, that was a very interesting reply, I definitely reckon I&#039;ll be trying it soon.

				Horizons is spot on in their description.&nbsp; Very much like &#039;shrooms but without the dark edges (for me anyway) and you are able to sort of snap out of it if need be.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is one of my favorite psychedelics and am looking forward to another assay.<br /><br />BTW, smarties are a type of candy here in the US.

				thanks for the help, I&#039;ll definitely be buying soon. <br />What, so you literally eat them like candy? Also, how risky do you reckon it would be to order 4 &#039;smarties&#039; from the USA to the UK? I&#039;ve only ever ordered domestically from SR before so forgive my noobiness.<br /><br />thanks again,<br />yovvit

				4-aco-dmt is a lot like shrooms but infinitely cleaner feeling. I don&#039;t like shrooms. 4-aco-dmt is nice.

				I didn&#039;t like it. Maybe because I&#039;d never taken shrooms before and I dove in with 25mg of 4-aco-dmt. It made me nauseous but I couldn&#039;t puke. It certainly was very intense and very visual (surprisingly quick, too. visuals started around 10-15 minutes after ingesting). The come-up was fun, but I did not enjoy the trip.

				Aliahad, do you think I&#039;d feel the same nausea starting with 20mg?<br /><br />and MailMaxDev, after a bit of research (with the exception of course the risk of schizophrenia if it runs in your family as with all psychedelics etc etc) I&#039;ve heard something about a high blood pressure/heart attack like feeling? But allegedly that was at a very high does (150mg), so it doesn&#039;t seem as if there&#039;s much to worry about.

				All psychedelics carry the risk of acting as triggers for latent mental issues, including schizophrenia and epilepsy. This isn&#039;t exclusive to 4-AcO-DMT. As for specific risks of the drug, I know of none that aren&#039;t shared with mushrooms and mescaline - and I did a lot of research before doing it for the first time. Personally, I can say that I&#039;ve taken up to 80mg of 4-AcO-DMT (40mg first, and another 40 after about an hour) and the only unusual side-effects were a constant feeling during the trip like I needed to move my bowels accompanied by a complete inability to do so, and insomnia for three nights after the trip. I don&#039;t usually get insomnia from psychedelics, but they do make me sleep less for a few nights after tripping (five and a half hours a night instead of my usual seven, but I feel perfectly rested when I wake up), so this insomnia is probably just a more intense version of that due to the high dose.<br /><br />yovvit, if you&#039;re very worried about nausea it might help a bit to trip on an empty stomach and take one or two dramamine pills about 45-30 minutes before taking the 4-AcO-DMT. It&#039;ll help to calm your stomach. Also, if it&#039;s already been at least an hour since you dosed, you don&#039;t need to hold back on vomiting, since the substance has already left your stomach by then. Throwing up will get rid of the nausea, and sometimes it actually enhances the trip with a feeling that you&#039;re throwing out everything bad from inside you (this sensation is so common on psychedelics that many Latin-American shamans refer to ayahuasca as &quot;la purga&quot;, which means &quot;the purging&quot;).

				thank you for the advice, I&#039;m ordering them in 10mg smarties so they&#039;ll be difficult to split but i&#039;ll just try 1 and a half each with my other friends.<br />thanks again.

				yesterday i took very high dosage (about 1/4 of 2g stock). after 10min. it started to really hit and i skyrocketed out of this galaxy and out of my body, my sense of touch was totally fucked and my head was shrinking in size of golf ball. my blood pressure got so high that i was thinking about calling 112 emergency number but after few minutes it started to normalize so it was back to enjoying my trip. it ended after 5-6 hours. it was short but very intense trip.<br /><br />ps. don´t listen blackmetal while tripping not a good idea&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br /><br />
