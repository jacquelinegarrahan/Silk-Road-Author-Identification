				Since starting the use of Meph I have noticed these dry, red pathes appear on my face the day after. In very specific areas: on the sides of my mouth and one above my nose in my forehead. I have been snorting it, dont know if oral dosage would make a difference. They appear to be very dry, havent had this kind of effect with any other drug, including coke,speed,mdma. <br /><br />These patches arent itchy, it just looks a bit weird. Lotion seems to help a bit. Couldnt find much info on this, is this something to be concerned about?

Not blaming you of course, otherwise its good stuff. Compared to Coke its easier to put down, but its quite a temptation to use it the&nbsp; next day and the next...&nbsp;

				Last time I had Lims UC it&#039;s was an incredibly hot day here.<br />Pushing 39C.<br />Having driven around most of the day I was quite dehydrated.<br />That evening after a couple of lines, 300mg tops I experienced extreme heat exhaustion.<br />Blurred vision, dizziness, forehead was sweating profusely and strangely I was twitching quite violently which I read could have been due to excess dopamine.&nbsp; <br />That&#039;s when my partner noticed the red rash on my belly.<br />It looked alot like ringworm.<br />24 or so hours later and after getting my fluids up the heat exhaustion subsided but the rash remained.<br />Over the next three days the red rings on my belly began to dry out and become scabby eventually pealing right off.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve been using meph pretty much every weekend for the last 3 years and this is the first time anything like this has happened.<br />Since this incident any amount of meph, 20mg, 100mg doesn&#039;t matter, my forehead gets extremely hot and sweaty within 10 minutes of snorting and the heat exhaustion symptoms seam to return along with the red ring rash.<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m as much to blame as the meph, binging for so long and all.<br />I just thought I&#039;d share my experience.<br /><br />Someone suggested that maybe its fucked my thyroid, so I&#039;m off for some tests shortly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stay safe motherfuckers.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s a hell of a drug.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)&nbsp; ;D<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Your problem could be unrelated to Meph or just only minimally related to it.&nbsp; Check out images on Google of Seborrheic Dermatitis....does that look like what you have?&nbsp; Drugs, Antibiotics, etc can kill good bacteria in the body which causes a variety of problems...mostly digestive and skin disorders.&nbsp; &nbsp;I recommend trying a good Probiotic, such as Dr Ohhira&#039;s Professional Probiotic, and see if that doesn&#039;t fix the problem.&nbsp;

				when I did some research on Mephedrone I did speak with a number of people who said that their skin would peel off , this was definitely Mephedrone related, people described it as similar to athletes foot <br /><br />&#039;I was twitching quite violently which I read could have been due to excess dopamine. &#039; - this was related to too much dopamine and quite possibly dehydration <br /><br />There is a similar reports on <br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/447467-MDMA-New-Experience-Rashes-on-skin-Allergies<br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/519882-Mephedrone-JWH-250-binge-and-skin-lesions<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=120989<br /><br />Hope this helps please keep us posted
