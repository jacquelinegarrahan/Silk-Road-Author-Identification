				Hello fellow trippers,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking mushrooms for a while now, and everything works just fine, even at 2g&#039;s I tend to get very strong open eyed visuals and very trippy mindset which leads to never ending confusion, I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s what others get possibly at higher doses if taken regularly. <br />To the point : I&#039;ve always tripped with my mate who has almost exact same effects after shrooms as me, our bodies seem to work very similarly. Recently my other mates wanted to try mushrooms, we had a big mushroom link up at my mates house, where about 7 people took them. I have ordered mushrooms on SR, P. Cyans. Grinded them up and threw into a pile, so that everyone gets fairly equal parts of shrooms. Weighted out 4 grams per person, and each one of us took 2 grams at first. <br />Me and my mate felt the mushrooms after 15 minutes, we knew the batch was legit and strong. Everybody else seemed not to feel anything which was very surprising. They decided to take another 2 grams after about half an hour. 1 of them didn&#039;t feel completely anything after 2 grams so he decided not to waste another 2, to save some for us later. What was surprising is that me and my mate went on for the whole night on only 2 grams, feeling quite trippy and strong visuals while two others felt only a little bit, as in fairly weak visuals which lasted very short time, and not much of the confused trippy state over all. The last two felt almost nothing.<br />So in the end:<br />Me and my mate - 2 grams each, strong visuals, strong confusion trippy state and very good vibes as usual<br />2 others - 4 grams each, very weak and short visuals, short lasting over all<br />2 others - 4 grams each, barely any visuals, didn&#039;t know if they are tripping or not<br />1 other - 2 grams, felt nothing at all, and gave away the shrooms<br />I am writing this here since I couldn&#039;t find any answers online, this is very weird to me. Our mates are quite tall, but their mass is very similar to ours. Certainly 4 grams of cyans would make them trip no matter what, any ideas? What could be stopping them from tripping? It seems very strange, sorry for making this whole long essay when I could have wrote it a lot shorter, I tend to get carried away. <br />Cheers,<br />Aids

				This has happened to me on several occasions and honestly I&#039;m not sure the reason either. I sometimes feel like it&#039;s a persons mentality but you&#039;re saying 4 people so I doubt that&#039;s it. For example, every time I trip with a friend of mine he has the &quot;nothing ever works on me&quot; mentality and I feel like that type of mentality will suppress any effects. It could also be other factors, one night me and a couple of friends did MDMA and the next day we did shrooms but barely felt anything (took 3.5g each) and it was because the MDMA depleted our serotonin so it made the shrooms a lot weaker.

				There&#039;s only one solution. Mail me whatever you have left and I&#039;ll test them out for confirmation.

				Some folks are &quot;hard-heads&quot;.. and some have &quot;intermittent hard-headedness&quot;. And sometimes the mushrooms just have their own idea about whether they will work for someone.<br /><br />It&#039;s part of the fungal dice game.<br /><br />Generally if I sold someone some mushies and they didn&#039;t trip, then come back and complain I refund them completely and never fuck with them again.. cause either they are hard-headed or the mushies have spoken.<br /><br />Sounds mystical but it&#039;s solid in my book.

				Is it possible the shrooms were just losing their potency? This is organic material we&#039;re talking about, could just be an old batch of shrooms nad you happen to have some that didn&#039;t go bad all the way.<br /><br />Also did they eat alot before hand? Shrooms need to be done on an empty stomache so your body can metabolize all the psilcybin at once.

				Thank you for the replies, <br />I always eat on an empty stomach along with my mate, we always trip out no matter what. I instructed my other mates to do the same as it was their first time, whether they stuck to it or not its really their problem, but I made sure they didn&#039;t eat at least 4 hours prior to consuming them.<br /><br />As of the loss of potency, it wouldn&#039;t be the case because me and my mate felt the full effects, the mushrooms themselves were a good batch, I&#039;ve never had weak shrooms before, I am always happy with anything people sell me. A week later, we still had 6 grams left, as three of us took only 2 grams the week before. We took them and again, we tripped very well, everything was almost as strong as the week before, and these were the same shrooms. So shrooms aren&#039;t really to blame, I would never complain about them because they were pretty strong.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;ve ordered another ounce, this time penis envy so I will try get them to eat 4-5 grams, which seems ridiculous but otherwise I can&#039;t really find an explanation for this other than their bodies having some sort of natural tolerance. We will give them another go at eating them, otherwise I will stick to just tripping with my mate who always has the same effects as me. I don&#039;t enjoy mushrooms in such a big group anyway, it gets really chaotic. <br /><br />When we took the left over shrooms we stumbled upon a program called Wild China on Sky, if you have very good calm music playlist without lyrics, mute the tv and just enjoy this stuff, absolutely amazing how the music synchronized with the landscape pictures.

				Just out of curiosity, how much is the average dosage for those viewing this thread? I usually get the mental effects at around 2 grams dried, but I&#039;ve never had noticeable visuals at anything under 5 grams dried.

I haven&#039;t tried anything lower than 2g but this already gives me a very nice trip with hallucinations and everything, I would say a medium. When I took 4.6g for my first time, at the peak of the trip I... forgot how to sit on a chair. Not to mention that I didn&#039;t understand the concept of FIFA on xbox, and not only I had no idea what to do with the pad, but the TV was so wobbly that I couldn&#039;t follow the ball. It was a very intense one!

				Um, i used to only eat shrooms on food.&nbsp; For instance, grill up a fatty burger, saute some onions and for the last minute toss the mushrooms in there to soften up, then put cheese on the burger, then the onion/mushroom mix, then more cheese, bacon, then a bunch of pickles, then a bunch of lettuce on a onion bun....<br /><br />MOTHERFUCKER!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />I am hungry as fuck now.&nbsp; I am never telling that story again, unless I&#039;m eating that shit,<br /><br />not fucking cool, not fucking cool at all

				I normally eat 4-7g depending on where I am. I&#039;m trying Rockers stuff today, but man I tried USAShroomz chocolate bar sample last week and that was 2.5g and got me all sorts of fucked up, as fucked up as I normally would be from 5g. If Rockers is equally as strong then I guess I&#039;ve been getting some pretty weak ass shrooms my whole life.
