				So it is my understanding that in general white MDMA is &quot;cleaner&quot; than tan MDMA.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that white is more potent but simply lacking the impurities that tan MDMA still has.&nbsp; Do those out there agree that is the case or is it a myth?

				Typically this is the case. Whiter MDMA crystal (it&#039;ll always retain a very slight tan tinge in my experience, though) indicates the chemist went through multiple acetone washes on the final product. I&#039;ve had tan MDMA that is more potent than white, and vice-versa, so as you have stated color is not an indicator of potency. Every chemist is different, and in the end it all boils down to the particular synthesis method they used and how much care was taken during the process.

				Both. The chemist begins by distilling natural oils to obtain pure safrole. If the chemist starts with sassafras oil, the potency will be in the upwards of 90% safrole. From there, he then utilizes Wacker oxidation to obtain MDP2P. Another distillation will yield pure MDP2P, from where the chemist will conduct another reaction to yield MDMA oil which is then crystallized. If care and chemist finesse was in play, the product will have high potency. It really comes down to how talented the chemist is. Chemistry is a true art form.

				When you say impurity, I think of the kind of molly that makes you feel kinda sick in a dirty way during your roll and like crap the next day. But I&#039;ve had very dark and smelly mdma that felt cleaner than white/clear stuff I&#039;ve had in the past. <br /><br />I&#039;m not arguing about the presence of impurities in darker crystals ... I&#039;m actually hoping someone might be able to elaborate on this phenomenon. I always reagent test and the reactions show no adulteration so we&#039;re not talking about a possible cut. <br /><br />Thoughts?

				Again, it&#039;s how much care the chemist took during the process. Color is zero indication of purity or potency. Ideally all product should be washed thoroughly, but even if washed on the final step, the chemist may have skipped cleaning intermediate chemicals throughout the synthesis and is only washing on the final step to offer a product that only appears pure.

				Interesting, well it sounds like there is general agreement that the closer to white the more care at least was taken in the process. Again, this does not reflect anything about it potency.&nbsp; I mean you can take something that isn&#039;t MDMA and roll hard, but you wouldn&#039;t be putting&nbsp; something in your body that you wanted to.&nbsp; I feel like a chemist who cares about his product enough to go the extra steps to clean it properly is the type of chemist I would want to get my product from.&nbsp; Are there any chemists out there that can comment on the actual difference in the process and the resulting product?

				The process typically differs only by the source of safrole oil (typically sassafras oil or synthesized from methylenedioxy compounds) and the care taken to distill and purify the intermediate chems. MDMA synthesis is extremely straightforward. It&#039;s obtaining the resources and ensuring you&#039;re very precise with your steps that is the hard part.

				pure powdered crystal mdma is white... but molly can be cut with a white substance too <br /><br />i actually suggest washing the mdma yourself to ensure the highest quality especially if its still tan or smells like licorice, which could be residual safrole which is carcinogenic. <br /><br />just dry some acetone by adding epsom salt that was baked for an hour at 450 to remove the water the acetone absorbs. the salt will settle, you can just leave in freezer and pour the clean acetone off the top. <br /><br />first weigh, then add mdma and swirl around in cold acetone using a shot glass. let settle and pour acetone off without dumping the mdma at the bottom. repeat a few times, then dump the acetone/mdma at the bottom on a glass dish or mirror to evaporate and scrape up. weigh again to see weight of the impurities you removed.

				FWIW, Gelman&#039;s MDMA is very dark (but becomes lt. brown when crushed).<br /><br />That stuff is pure magic and produced the cleanest roll I&#039;ve ever experienced. No downsides to speak of.<br /><br />Honestly, I wouldn&#039;t stress about finding the &quot;purest&quot; white. Any impurities are miniscule unless you eat absurd amounts daily. And at that point.the mdma itself would&nbsp; ause you more harm than any impurity ever would.<br /><br />Plus you might miss out on some very special dark stuff ;)

				It doesn&#039;t always mean it has a smoother cleaner trip.&nbsp; I had brown/caramel colored MDMA from juergen a long time ago and it was sooo clean that it made me sleepy and pass out.<br /><br />First time I experienced that and was amazed.

				I just had some MDMA from AH that was oily, smelly and dark brown&nbsp; chunks and tan sand and i must say it was very good right up there with some white MDMA from SKY&nbsp; i had&nbsp; So color has nothing to do with potency ,but&nbsp; &nbsp;impurities might be a different story.

				in a perfect world, all MDMA would be clear and odorless<br /><br />however, that&#039;s not where we live. tan crystals indicates some level of impurity, however it could be a very minute amount of impurity that causes the coloration. conversely, simply having white mdma does not intrinsically indicate a superior product; there are plenty of white crystalline powders you could use to cut it with. truthfully, testing is the best way to judge purity

				That brings up another question.&nbsp; Why the importance on crystals over powder?&nbsp; Is that because if its crystals it has to be MDMA and if its powder it could be mixed with any number of powdered things?&nbsp;

Some folks are under the impression that it&#039;s harder to cut/fake crystals. Not true. There are bulk suppliers in China that offer crystal methylone for example. Alot of that.and a little MDMA will still test positive for MDMA. <br /><br />Same with &quot;moonrocks&quot; (mdma melted in oven). The makers could cut it with with all the piss.and bk-1 they.please, bake it, and whoala: &quot;moonrocks&quot; cut with xyz.<br /><br />The best most of us can do is.keep up.with the current feedback andthe forum, reagent test, and proceed to be the ultimate judge with those results in mind.<br /><br />For the record, I ground some.of Gelman&#039;s dark chocolicious (best on the Road!) moonrocks down to a fine power for the purpose of making a booster.for later in the night. <br /><br />I shit you not, that black moonrock was an off-white creamy powder by the time I was finished. I dont&#039;t know.what.that means in terms ofthe white vs. tan debate, but I feel it&#039;s an interesting observation!
