				(First thing to say is that weed is not an option, get panic attacks and paranoia about breathing)<br /><br />Gave up alcohol this year which basically meant giving up coke, because I can never sleep unless I knock myself out with alcohol after a coke session, and in addition with coke on it&#039;s own I tend to get slight anxiety pangs.<br /><br />Having never had access to benzos, haven&#039;t been in a position to use them for sleep afterwards instead of coke.<br /><br />So although I know neither is really &quot;safe&quot;, would benzos be a better option than alcohol when trying to sleep after coke? <br /><br />I&#039;m not talking about having just a couple of beers to sleep by the way, I&#039;m talking at least a bottle of whiskey/vodka/rum etc. which means I&#039;m usually not safe to drive at all the next day. Benzos would mean that coke would be a possibility again as I haven&#039;t done it this year because I&#039;m totally done with alcohol and never want to touch the stuff again, so if someone could offer any advice as to whether benzos are a) safer than alcohol after coke and b) actually help you sleep after coke.<br /><br />And perhaps c) taking small amounts with coke helps with anxiety on coke.<br /><br />Look forward to your responses, many thanks.<br /><br />Asym

				It really depends on how you tolerate benzos. <br /><br />Props to you for quitting alcohol, my life has been much better since I stopped the drink.

				Yes and Yes,<br /><br />I take a 10mg Valium once I begin a coke session<br /><br />it does decrease any anxiety during the session<br /><br />it also helps ALOT with the come down, I personally like to use 10mg Valium<br /><br />It depends on how much and how long your coke session is, but<br /><br />60 mg Valium is usaully enough to get me comfortable and have a nice nights rest.<br /><br />Some people use Xanax for this, I personally do not prefer Xanax, I know it is a stronger Benzo, but<br /><br />I sometimes can&#039;t remember the day or blocks of hours from the day before if I take xanax.<br /><br /><br />Just my 2 cents

				You should try my ChillPill, it&#039;s designed for that purpose and is made of natural ingredients, with no risk of addiction or adverse effects. Also, every review I&#039;ve received has been positive.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f4fee76ba1<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4dc5679867<br /><br />Alcohol is a very destructive drug, and benzos are about the closest things to &#039;stupid drugs&#039; (as opposed to &#039;smart drugs&#039;) that one can find, neither are good to take regularly (if at all).

				A while back I had a similar question (for MDMA come down). A couple of people in these forums advised to take Xanax. I&#039;ve now taken Xanax for both MDMA and coke come down and it definitely helps (I take .5mg when I&#039;m ready to call it a night). It makes the come down just fine and helps me sleep pretty quick. Make sure you don&#039;t take any benzo too often and don&#039;t start taking a stimulant after you&#039;ve taken a benzo.

				I&#039;d never take benzos regularly. Have read far too much bad shit about them. <br /><br />But I don&#039;t have the money to take coke more than once every couple of months, so would only be taking them then.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice posted so far. Still not 100% sure I&#039;m going to do any coke any time soon though.
