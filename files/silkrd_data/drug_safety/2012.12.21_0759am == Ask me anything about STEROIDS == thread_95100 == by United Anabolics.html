If your 40 years old and have low testosterone (Doctor would need to run a blood check this), the 200mg of Test per week will put you at the high range of &quot;normal&quot; testosterone levels of someone in there 20&#039;s. 200mg of Test is considered a TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) dose.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in your 20&#039;s, or have normal test levels, then 200mg would be a total waste. Beginners are always recommended a standard 10 weeks of Test @500mg per week. <br /><br />It also recommended you take Aromasin(Exemestane) @12.5mg Every other day in conjunction with test, and adjusted accordingly. Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor which prevents Test from aromatising, or converting to estrogen, which is the primary contributor to bloating, gyno, and various other sides. <br /><br />You can get this at Ergopep.com<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95100.msg674456#msg674456">Quote from: yzxcv12693 on December 21, 2012, 10:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What would you suggest to take to build up some muscles without getting impotent and stuff?

Impotency comes from tens of years of steroid ABUSE. Regular guys like us will always recover. Some longer than others depending on how old you are. If you&#039;re younger, you will bounce back much quicker than someone in there 50s. <br /><br />This is why you always go through PCT(Post cycle therapy) post cycle to jump start your natural testosterone levels as quickyl as possible to preserve that precious muscle you developed on cycle. The period post cycle is the most important because its the time you need to fight for your hard earned gains, which will be during the receovery period when your natural test levels are fully suppressed. <br /><br />An example of a PCT medicine, is Clomid(clomiphene) which is ordinarily comprised fo 4 weeks, starting at 40mg first week, and tapering down to 20mg by the end of week4. Clomid stimulates your LH which is the feedback signal in your testicles which signals your testes to beginning producing testosterone. LH is at its lowest during cycle because you introducing exogenous hormones into your body, therefor you body wont see a need to produce naturally, hence low LH(Lutinizing hormone).<br /><br />Clomid can be found at ergopep.com<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95100.msg674397#msg674397">Quote from: CrazyBart on December 21, 2012, 09:13 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How much could you sell me a 12 week cycle for, running 600mg of test a week alongside 400 mg of EQ.

Run EQ 1 week shorter than your test to give Eq&#039;s undeconate ester time to clear your system the same time as your test, assuming your using test-enanthate. All you pct meds can be found at ergopep.com<br /><br />1-12wk Test-E @ 600mg<br />1-11wk Eq@ 550mg<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95100.msg675773#msg675773">Quote from: darthvaderstar on December 22, 2012, 01:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How difficult is it to maintain steroids being healthy?

Im assuming your asking can you be bother healthy and a steroid user? Yes, if you done abuse steroids, you can easily maintain your health while doing so.<br /><br />First work on your diet. The when you feel you hit your natural growth potential, and want to be bigger, then consider juice. <br />

However this is not proportional to the amount of strength you will gain. Different hormones yeild different strength gains, Tren being the most intense. <br /><br />Pulling ligaments/tendons are always a big conern when being enhanced. Steroids such as deca are though to &quot;lubricate&quot; your joints and strengtheninig tendons at the same time. DHT derivatives such as winny, masteron ect are though to &quot;dry&quot; your joins due to the displacement of water. Which is why masteron and winny are considered pre-contest drugs. They &quot;dry&quot; you out giving you a leaner apperence.<br /><br />Anyways, Just know your body, Know if you overlifting so you dont injure yourself.

Cycle right, and safely and you will have zero side effects.<br /><br />25 years old is the general rule of thumb of the appropriote age to start steroids because you&#039;re 100% sure your endocrine system is developed. However, steroids are not always the key. DIET DIET DIET. You can get to where you need naturally. Its if you want to get to those insane bodyfat percentages like 6,5, or even 4% bodyfat without sacrificing all your muscle in the process. OR if you want to gain muscle past your genetic limit.

If you abuse GH (10i.u.+ a day, with insulin, with 8k calories a day of food) the most common is discended gut, excessive bone growth. <br /><br />Its hard to say theirs a standard cycle. GH should not be cycled, Its either your one it for a few years at a time, or not on at all. GH starts to have noticable effects around month 5 or 6 depending on your diet. The most common dosage is 3-4i.u. of good GH every day, for atleast 6+ months.

If that dynamic trio doesnt getting you shredded as fauk...<br /><br />When people think tren, they think side effects. What they dont know is that these sides are significantly decreased by keeping test low and tren high, not the other way around. This goes against the grain when everyone says testosterone must be kept high than other compounds&nbsp; introduced into your cycle. I forget the actual science behind this so dont quote me on it, but it has something to do with test and tren competing for androgen receptor attachment. If your keeping Test higher than tren, more test is allowed to bind to those AR&#039;s, leaving more tren floating around in your blood stream to induce those harsh negative side effects. <br /><br />1-12wk Prop @25mg/day<br />1-10wk Tren-Ace @ 50mg/day<br />1-12wk Mast-prop @50-75mg/day<br /><br />Pin ED(Everyday) to to keep those hormone levels stable. You dont want to fuck around with hormone flux especially with tren, so be safe with pining ED. Keep caber or prami on hand incase you get any progesterone/prolactin sides from the tren. Dont use nolva with tren, as im sure you know. Stick to Clomid for your PCT med. <br /><br />You will have a great time with this cycle. Make sure your diet is dialed in 100% and you&#039;ll be the sexiest, most shredded mother fucker in you city.<br /><br />

When you halt test injections, you have a tremendous hormone embalance with estrogen dominating the enviroment, hence the severe acne. During PCT I will always recomend an AI such as aromasin to prevent that estrogen rebound which is repsonsible for the shitty post cycle side effects. <br /><br />In regards to GH, 3-4iu is idea for ATLEAST 6 months imo. I will be offering GH next month

It&#039;s going to take a huge caloric intake to gain weight. Dont say you cant gain weight, the excuse it overused and frankly is BS. Its simple, if you increase your calories, you will gain weight, its thermodynamics. I suggest writing down the food you eat day to day, totaling up the calories and macronutrients to see what youre getting, you might be surprised. I would focus on diet first before looking into steroids. <br /><br />And if you stop cycle you will no lose gains, thats why we used post cycle medications such as clomid, to jump start you natural test levels to normal as quickly as possible<br /><br />

HCG is essentially exogenous LH peptide, and will hardly stimulate enough natural test to keep your body from shutting down. And what happens when you stop HCG for your at the end of your PCT? You LH will be in the shitter because the LH that was in your body was synthetic. You need to stop HCG usage during your last Hormone shot. <br /><br />Plus Tren is 5x more powerful (500/500 andro/anabolic) than any other hormone, is will over ride the HCG feedback signal imo. I dont know why anyone would do this? If theyre already injecting tren, why not load up from test as well?<br /><br />My suggestion is to keep test low (TRT dose) and enough tren that you can handle. <br /><br />Dont use Nolvex with Deca or Tren. Trenbolones active metabolite (17beta-trenbolone) has a binding affinity to the progesterone receptor that is actually greater than progesterone itself. Nolvadex increased the sensitiveity and biding affinity to these Progesterone receptors, causing increased progesterone and prolactin side effects. Use Clomid instead.

				Well I was saying not to take hCG during the last week of the 6 week cycle. That is, stop hCG in week 5. Then start Nolvadex in week 7, 3 days after the last Tren shot in week 6. I wasn&#039;t saying taking Nolvadex during the cycle. Only after the cycle, perhaps for a 3 weeks long PCT.<br /><br />I think that 500iu hCG 2x a week will give me enough LH replacement to keep some test flowing in my system. I&#039;ve never heard of anything about Tren overriding or interfering with hC. hCG doesn&#039;t work on the HPTA. It directly stimulates the cells in your testis. I&#039;m no expert, but although Tren will interfere with your regular HPTA feedback loop, it can&#039;t interfere with exogenous gonadotropins stimulating the testes directly.<br /><br />Tren is the focus of this cycle. Not test. I just need a little bit of test in my system and I think hCG will do the job... slightly lower than natural test levels is fine with me (but my natural levels are so low to begin with lol so it doesn&#039;t matter). Humans need some test in them so complete shutdown is not good.<br /><br />Again, Tren is the focus of this cycle because I always get dramatic body re-composition with Tren. Tons of weight loss. Harden my muscles, nice lean gains even while dieting. Just 6 weeks is enough. I&#039;m going to do 6 weeks on, 12 weeks off, so a few short cycles a year. Whereas with 500mg/week Test I swell up like a fat guy, get super bloated, and then shrivel back down when the cycle is over. It&#039;s so much more obvious to people I&#039;m on steroids with a Test-heavy cycle.

				this is probably the most novice question that you could be asked...what are your thoughts on an oral only cycle? or even yet if a person was to take only 10mg of dianabol per day for a certain amount of time what would the out come be?and would the side effects really be as bad as you would think? sorry if this is a stupid question to you,I&#039;m just curious. 8)

				I heard someone say once: &quot;If you want to hang with the big boys, you&#039;ll have to inject&quot;. Oral-only cycles are frowned upon in the steroid community. I think that with a dianabol only cycle, you&#039;ll swell up very quickly, and then when you stop, you&#039;ll shrivel backdown. Minimal maintainable gains long term, even with some kind of PCT after you stop taking the dbol. All the side effects/trouble over barely any maintainable long term gains.

				I am personally of the opinion that a small dose of Testosterone (injected) is necessary to get the most out of any cycle.&nbsp; When you take steroid hormone, your natural levels of testosterone will decrease a bit.&nbsp; However, I have had many friends use 40-60mgs/day of Anavar (Oxandrolone) ONLY and have excellent, lean gains.&nbsp; Legit Oxandrolone will not cause bloat, only quality gains.&nbsp; &nbsp;IF you are already working out on a regular basis, dieting and doing everything right....I recommend Anavar as an ORAL ONLY cycle.&nbsp; I think a cycle of 6-8 weeks is sufficient at a does of 40-60mgs/day (spread evenly throughout the day).&nbsp; &nbsp;I recommend starting at 40mgs/day for the 1st couple of weeks and see how it goes.&nbsp; If you are making consistent, quality gains...no reason to go up in dose.&nbsp; The key is to use the smallest effective dose as you don&#039;t want to REQUIRE heavy doses to give you the gains you desire.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, do not run this cycle past 8 weeks before taking AT LEAST a full 30 days off (preferably 45 or 60 days off).&nbsp; &nbsp;You need to give your body a chance to recover it&#039;s natural, normal levels of testosterone so do not be tempted to continue a run for many months on end....

				Hey guys, I&#039;ve used steroids in the past. Test prop, to be specific and loved it. I do have a question regarding harm reduction in creating my own BA water.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually planning on using this technique to make some ketamine vials from crystal, the same way I would if I was converting Test powder into a sterile vial and wanted to get your opinions on procedure an if this is sound. I tried posting this in the ketamine and harm reduction section but I think the folks with the ability to answer with something constructive are far and few between.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to get some opinions.<br /><br />&quot;My goal is to convert crystal ketamine into a sterile vial ready to inject that will hold it&#039;s shelf life and where I don&#039;t have to worry about bacteria.<br /><br />&nbsp;I have done a lot of research and have experience using steroids, and known people that have made their own home brew. Based on what I&#039;ve learned I came up with a procedure that I felt would work and wanted to reach out to the community and see if anyone with professional experience could comment on my procedure.<br /><br />Supplies<br />-Wattman wheel filters 0.22ug<br />-Benzyl Alcohol<br />-Distilled Water<br />- pressure cooker<br />-gloves/mask/hairnet<br />- still air box<br />- Sterile Vials 10ml<br /><br />Procedure:<br />- First make bacteriostatic water, by pressure cooking distilled water at 15psi for 25 minutes. Allowing to cool, and place in the still air box<br />- Once cooled add in Bezyl Alcohol at 0.9% by volume in still air box wearing gloves and mask<br />- Draw out bacteriostatic water into sterile 10cc syringe, and mix in to jar with product already in. Mix and let disolve<br />- Take a new sterile syringe and attach wheel filter, draw up ketamine+bacteriostatic water through Wattman wheel filter<br />- Alcohol swab the sterile vial, inject sterile solution into the vial<br /><br />My ideas on this, was the distilled water is sterilized by the pressure cooker; acting as an autoclave. Benzyl Alcohol added at 0.9% by volume to ward off bacteria from growing in the water/vial. Ran solution through Wattman to get out any particles and some bacteria.<br /><br />Now, I know for a fact I can use the wheel filter safely for single shots. So the wheel filter is very effective even against getting out bacteria. My goal is to have a vial I can come back to a week 2 weeks or a month down the road and have a safe to inject solution.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know is if there is any adverse reactions to mixing benzyl alcohol with ketamine, I don&#039;t have any chemistry knowledge but I assume the practices of making injectable solutions is somewhat standardized. If they use it with steroids and other injectables, why not K; is my thought process on this. From what I&#039;ve read about Benzyl Alcohol it will just prevent bacteria from growing, and it&#039;s added for shelf life.<br />Also, could I add the BA before autoclaving or should I add it after? I didn&#039;t know how the heat/pressure would effect BA so I decided to do it after.<br /><br />Not trying to take the focus off of the roids, I just need some more knowledgeable people to comment on my sterile procedures.&nbsp; anyone with knowledge they can add to what I&#039;ve come up with would be greatly appreciated.&quot;<br /><br />Sorry for the long post, thank you so much people!
