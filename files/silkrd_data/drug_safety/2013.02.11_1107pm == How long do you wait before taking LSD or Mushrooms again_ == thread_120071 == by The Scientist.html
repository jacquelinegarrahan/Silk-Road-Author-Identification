				I take LSD once a week. If I take it more often than once a week, I don&#039;t trip as hard as I would like to.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to trip twice a week instead of just once a week.<br /><br />I heard that you don&#039;t have to wait as long with magic mushrooms. While LSD is best taken once a week, shrooms can be taken every 2-3 days. Is that true?<br /><br />How often should I take mushrooms?<br /><br />

				LSD once a week? Damn thats rough on your brain man! I usually wait at least a month, usually more, in between acid trips. Although when I do take it I like to take pretty high doses.

				unfortunately it is not feasible to trip twice a week, even with mushrooms. tolerance lasts about the same length as lsd. if you want to trip multiple times a week, i recommend a short-acting psychedelic such as dmt, changa, 5-meo-dmt, salvia, etc. as you can&#039;t really develop tolerance to them.

				For me to back to baseline takes around two weeks. That goes for both shrooms and lsd. If I trip with a week in between it just becomes not quite as strong an experience - its not tjhat I cannot trip after a weeks break, but it just won&#039;t quite blow my mind, even on high doses.

				I find that with both LSD and mushrooms, if you wait three full days after you trip, the tolerance is basically non-existant

				Erowid: <br /><br />LSD is not physically addicting, and is quite unlikely to lead to psychological addiction in most people. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, a few people have reported becoming mentally habituated to LSD. There is a short period of tolerance after use. Using LSD two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 3 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.<br />

				If you look up &#039;BlueLight LSD tolerance&#039; they have a graph of tolerance taken from the average of their users.<br /><br />On the topic of heavy using, I read Jim Morrison lived off LSD and beans, I think he turned out okay...

				I would say it is too much once a week instead you want to be completly out of this society. Even lsd is quite safe for a &quot;safe-brain&quot;, taking it too often i find it to be hard to recover from baseline if you have a lot of work and things to do in society. It is life changing for the good i&#039;m ok with that but you need time to really understand what you have live.<br /><br />And, I find it hard to make long clear sociably-understandable sentences when i&#039;m recovering from lsd trip for some days after.

				general rule of thumb as people will tell you is 2 weeks min before trips.&nbsp; i definitely feel tolerance even at the 2 week mark. if you want to trip, you&#039;ll need to take more but i like to space things out to keep my trips fun and my costs down

				If you really wanna trip very often, <br />you might wanna think about your kidneys or liver...<br />mushrooms do kill you kidneys - badly...

				The info I gave you here was not from a websource or whatever, <br />just my own personal experience (and damn I did lot of shrooms)...<br />at a certain point I started pissing some &quot;red stuff&quot; and when I stopped the shrooms for a few months it quickly got better...<br />so how/why/what - I don&#039;t know, <br />but that&#039;s just my personal experience. <br /><br />Regarding LSD and kidneys: I don&#039;t think the one affect the other&nbsp; :)
