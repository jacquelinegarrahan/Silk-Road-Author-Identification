				**Alprazolam powder Pro-Tip:**<br /><br />Le Botbahn&#039;s Easy All-Purpose OTC Alprazolam Solvent <br /><br />This is a very easy and useful Alprazolam solvent which I recently concocted and it just keeps surprising me with it&#039;s versatility. I hope some of you out there abandon the toothpick method for this.<br /><br />You need not be precise in making the solvent, there&#039;s likely room for improvement, certain aspects could be overkill, but hey, it&#039;s easy, worked on my first and future attempts, and so far it&#039;s demonstrated it&#039;s more than suitable for any type of oral ingestion I&#039;ve thrown at it. Liquid gelcapsules, dry gel capsules, blotters, smarties, and probably anything else you care to put it on.<br /><br />***Why should I use this formulation?*****<br /><br />Because it&#039;s as easy as poking your pile with a toothpick, only more accurate and 1000x more practical. <br />Some of these properties might be well established but some came as a real surprise for me:<br /><br />1. You can put your liquid measured dose inside a gelatin capsule, seal it, and the liquid alprazolam solution will remain there indefinitely (capsules made a few weeks ago at 2.0 mg/ml have remained perfectly intact and unaffected by the solution inside them. Since most solvents taste like shit, this is a convenient solution to that, and dosing doesn&#039;t get more convenient than a capsule right?<br /><br />Furthermore, and probably better: you have the option of instead of capping the pill immediately, the dose can be left to evaporate (the liquid is Isopropanol, it evaporates rapidly, especially with gentle breeze). Your left with a tiny smudge of dry PEG-Alprazolam matrix in the capsule and it isn&#039;t going anywhere. This has the added convenience of ease of transport. No worries of crushing or liquid explosions in your pocket. Also overall weight of capsule is dramatically reduced, approaching it&#039;s original weight. Lighter and tougher. <br /><br />2. The PEG-Alprazolam matrix left behind after evaporation and drying, ime, has proven to be surprisingly hardy. This, in conjunction with the solvents high carrying capacity, has made heavily concentrated alprazolam solutions to adhere extremely well to surfaces. My favorite use so far has been 1-drop dose solutions ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 mg placed dropped on sweet tarts candy (which allow for easy color coding for dose and their concavity contains the drop(s) well. They&#039;re completely dry within an hour or two, sped up by gentle warming.<br /><br />I&#039;m finding that I can one of these 1 drop sweet tarts in my pocket as is, just like I would a normal pill, with no degradation or loss to the adhesive matrix. You can also avoid the horrible xanny taste by swallowing them quickly. But chewing them isn&#039;t all that bad.<br /><br />***How to make it: Grandma&#039;s poop medicine and alcohol*****<br /><br />Required Materials: 91% Isopropanol (IPA) and miraLAX (=PEG 3350, OTC in US, used as laxative)<br />&nbsp; -Ethanol probably substitutes better or equal. Lower % IPA/EthOH likey work too but may limit high&nbsp; (alprazolam concentrations if desired). Tip- miraLAX is $6-10 I believe for 17 grams. Far more than I need. Borrow from grandma instead.<br /><br />1.Add roughly 1 tsp (2.5 g) of miraLAX (PEG 3350, an OTC laxative $6-10, or borrow from grandma)<br /><br />2.to 50 mL 91% Isoproanol (IPA). If lazy, substitute 50 mL&nbsp; with shot glass filled at 85% IPA. Both work fine. Gently stir/shake. The PEG will go in there eventually few minutues. <br /><br />Done. <br /><br /><br />Choose your desired Alprazolam concentration and proceed accordingly:<br /><br />Later, after adding Alprazolam to the above solution, keep in mind that higher concentrations take a bit longer to go into solution and will likel require exposure to warm water bath to fully go into solution. Heavy concentrated solutions may also precipitate your previosly disolved powder when given time and cooler temperatures. Simply warm again later or plan to use immediately.<br /><br />Please let me know if you need clarification and feel free to PM me if you are hung up.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Update &amp; extra bits:<br />2/13/13<br /><br />I get alot of PM&#039;s asking the same question about the purpose of PEG/miralax. Allow me to clarify it&#039;s purposes here.<br />It has two purposes.<br />1. It dramatically increases the solubility of alrazolam in alcohol solution.<br />2. When utilized in the application to edibles, such as smarties, sweettarts, (and blotter to some degree)...once the alcohol evaporates you are left with a PEG matrix on top of the candy. It sort of meshes with the candy side and essentially becomes an extension of the candy itself, while holding your precious alrazolam safely and secrely with the hard matrix. <br />-The major advantage to this PEG matrix portability. Once dry, that shit isn&#039;t going anywhere. Carry it your daily dose in your pocket. Or fanny pack if you&#039;re a weirdo. Or gym bag. You get the point. <br />When dissolved onto a sufface without peg, the aprazolam falls off quite easily and isn&#039;t at all suitable for transport.<br /><br />I prefer 91% IPA simply because it&#039;s cheap, OTC, and (in my case) free of adulterants. If you can obtain higher % alcohol, by all means go for it. It will probably work better. It will probably cost more too. 91% IPA for me works just fine and I&#039;ve had no reason to seek higher % alcohol.<br /><br />Word of caution, some nations add nasty adulterants to their OTC alcohols. Some toxic. Australia is very evil about this IIRC. USA is surprisingly not so evil. Just be sure to give the label a thoroug reading. Get the cleanest stuff you can and never jeopordize your health if unsure. <br /><br /><br />Update 2:<br /><br />Google &quot;exipient&quot;<br />Scroll down. You&#039;ll see the section about flavors as exipients. Very useful info there. Alprazolam is very bitter. The slightest bit of mint or peppermint to your solution and your mouth will thank you to no end.<br /><br /><br />As always, please PM me if you hit a snag. Better than a tree. I&#039;m always happy to help and I&#039;ve enjoyed connecting with alot of you this way.&nbsp; :)

				Awesome guide, easy to read/understand. This is especially important for psychedelics active at extremely small doses.

				Been keeping my eyes open for some PEG with no success for a while now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Done enough I can eye-ball it now (NO ONE ELSE EVER EYEBALL ALPRAZOLAM, IT WORKS AT VERY LOW DOSES !!!!<br />Only cuz i&#039;m a benzoid and know less is more, but be nice to make up some caps, fucking 3000 size 000 caps just lying here doing nothing (and yes I know 000 is the largest, and yes it&#039;s the size I explicitly seeked out when I bough em).<br /><br />Just be easier to throw back a pre-made capsule, or 10 :)<br /><br />Muslix, much hate for the alprazolam crowd or something?&nbsp; &lt;--- Muslix appears to have deleted his post, o wells
