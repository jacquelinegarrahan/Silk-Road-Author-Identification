				With all the powdered benzos floating around the road there has to be way more horror stories out there of people taking way too much and then black out and do retarded shit.<br /><br />I know if I have a lot of pills ill take one and take a few and then forget i took them till i have none left.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some pretty crazy fucked up stories but i&#039;m just high and paranoid and one of them has pending charges so I don&#039;t want to incriminate myself too soon. Maybe this thread should be moved to drug safey, im not quite sure.<br /><br />But please everyone share your stories of your herocic dose of alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, diazepam or even phenazepam in the name of harm reduction!!!!!!<br /><br />-Chairman

				I posted this in the newbie forum, but it definitely belongs here. Ecstasydude is right. It&#039;s fun as hell, but no amount of fun is worth the price you pay when you honestly feel your actions have no consequences. It&#039;s hard to describe, but scary as fuck the next day.<br />Once I took 10mg of clonazepam and drank my ass off. I went out partying and remember very little of the night. My first memory after popping my tenth bean was rooting around my friends&#039; apartment early in the morning looking for alcohol. They were all passed out, so I took a little bit of liquor from multiple bottles until my water bottle was full. At the time this seem like a brilliant. I packed a bowl and walked outside as the sun came up. At some point I dropped the pipe and it shattered. When I got back to my dorm I couldn&#039;t figure out how to open my door. Someone found me passed out outside around noon the following morning. And I was arrested while half conscious. My first real memory after waking up again was in a holding cell watching the History channel with a self-identified wife-beater. <br />Two years later I decided I was more mature, better able to handle the benzo/alcohol combination, and I was wrong. Mixed 6mg of xanex with a bottle of vodka and went out. I ended up at my friend&#039;s parent&#039;s house and continued to drink. At one point I left the house to take a shit in his yard because I thought it would be funny. According to witnesses I actually went into the bathroom to get toilet paper. For some reason nobody stopped me. By the end of the night I had swallowed my buddy&#039;s house key. Didn&#039;t even remember it until I got a text the next day asking me if I&#039;d shat it out yet. There&#039;s nothing quite like having these kinds of things told to you after the fact. It&#039;s similar to blacking out, but in my case more extreme. Definitely not something I would recommend/will ever try again.

				The only benzo i have had serious negative effects with was temazepam. Quite ago i used it as a hypnotic, but in combination with alcohol it produces terrible memory loss even at doses as low as 20 mg. I never went as far as eating a key (i suppose), but complete anterograde amnesia seems to be quite common. <br /><br />Temazepam seems to be especially dangerous in that regard though, i&#039;ve never experienced anything like it with other benzo&#039;s like alprazolam, diazepam or oxazepam.

				My usage of benzodiazepenes has always been very moderate and infrequent, and almost entirely for functional reasons rather than recreation. Perhaps half a dozen times I&#039;ve strayed from this and taken one or two milligrams of xanax on a Friday evening to assist with the post-work wind down, but never when I&#039;ve intended to drink or take other drugs.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve successfully used benzos to take the edge off a too-harsh trip that I tried and failed to come to terms with, and while I can see the attraction they hold for some people I prefer to keep them for functional purposes: They&#039;re just not very entertaining, but they are useful when one needs them.<br /><br />A friend of mine is quite different in this regard, and purports to be able to enjoy the specific characteristics of a wide range of benzos. His usage these days is infrequent enough that he doesn&#039;t develop a tolerance, but he&#039;s generally tolerant to the class of drugs and doses that would have me incapable of recalling the events of the night don&#039;t seem to affect him in the same way. This has unfortunately led to a rather lassez faire approach to his benzo use, which had some impressively negative results a bit over a week ago.<br /><br />I occasionally (two or three times a year) enjoy opiates. Some years ago I grew a small poppy plantation and produced raw opium and developed an appreciation for some of the other opiates as a result, whereas prior I actively disliked them. But self produced opium opened my sense of appreciation for some of the other opiates. I&#039;m reasonably sensitive to opiates, and consider a 15 mg dose or heroin hydrochloride to be quite satisfactory. My friend has a much higher threshold and considers 50 mg to be a sizeable but manageable dose. To his discredit and my alarm he recently had consumed 6 mg of xanax several hours prior to us convening for an evening of opiate use, and he neglected to inform me of this.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Imagine my surprise when perhaps ten minutes after administering 50 mg of #4 heroin he fell back on the bed upon which he sat and gave out a peculiar croaking noise, and proceeded to turn blue, and then a corpse-like grey. In a handful of seconds I established that he had a good, solid heartbeat but that he wasn&#039;t breathing. Happily through the gentle fog of opiate the reasonably extensive first aid training I&#039;ve had came to mind and I put him the correct position and perform expired air resuscitation (EAR a.k.a. mouth-to-mouth) until his colour returned to normal. I&#039;ll confess to a degree of panic at this point, as his reaction was very uncharacteristic, but after two or three minutes of pumping regular breaths into him he regained consciousness and began to object. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Afterwards he admitted he thought I was just being a jerk after a hard week at work, but for the next hour I made him sit up straight, and prodded and poked him to ensure he remained breathing. Apparently the autonomous breathing reflex had completely died in him, so I had to keep him manually breathing (under near continual protest from he) until he&#039;d metabolised enough of the opiate to start making sense, and to finally get it through his addled skull that he&#039;d stopped breathing and that I&#039;d had to resuscitate him.<br /><br />&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t until a couple of hours later he told me he&#039;d taken quite a bit of xanax a few hours prior. I&#039;d have slapped or punched him if I thought it&#039;d have helped, but I settled for once again drilling him on the interaction between benzos and opiates. I told him I&#039;d recount the story to him when he was compos mentis again, and I&#039;ve done so, but it was about two hours before I was confident that he was fine and I was able to relax. I stayed the night to ensure he was OK, and in the morning he was appropriately sheepish, apologetic, and grateful, but it&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve had to revive somebody who could otherwise have died due to benzo interactions.<br /><br />Not really a &quot;I ruined my life with benzos&quot; story for me, but it pretty well fucked up my evening, and but for suitable first aid intervention would have killed my stupid friend.

				so only these benzos exist for you ? lol . here&#039;s my story. 60 mg ~ medazepam so about (equals 60mg diazepam) and maybe 2-3 7.5mg midazolam pills I basically remember shit while on high doses on benzos but I went to a store and started stealing shit i don&#039;t need just going and putting everything in a bag . I was kinda nodding like from opiates dropping stuff on the floor then came out of the store security guard caught me well and I got 6 months probation first offense. Since then I don&#039;t do large doses of benzos . If I&#039;m high on benzos or I mix benzos with opiates I tend to shoplift I don&#039;t know why but i find other people have this side efffect too. Just calmly stealing shit they don&#039;t need.

				Taking 6 mg of xanax and doing -anything- a few hours later is evidence of serious tolerance. If you fed the average inexperienced, random, person 6 mg of xanax, he&#039;d probably be out for a fair amount of time, but awaken unharmed the day after. <br /><br />The combination with alcohol is dangerous, surely, but it&#039;s also fairly common. Many people will take moderate doses of alcohol and benzo&#039;s at roughly the same time - probably int he form of having a few drinks and then taking a xanax just before sleep. Usually this doesn&#039;t end badly, but its hard to find some limit where the combination turns really dangerous.

				I was worried that I&#039;d open this thread and see a bunch of war stories that aren&#039;t portrayed in a more cautionary light. While a couple are definitely playing with that boundary between &quot;I got super fucked up and got this cool story out of it&quot; and &quot;I made a mistake and you should not make the same mistake&quot; some of these look like they could prove informative. I&#039;d just like to ask that people posting their experiences keep in mind that we are in the drug safety forum and to try to avoid portraying a bad binge story in a positive light (&quot;positive light&quot; isn&#039;t a very accurate description but hopefully you all know what I mean). <br /><br />And I feel the need to ask this only because I did my own unwise combos because some of the stories I had been told sounded...cool. Fun. Anyways, I may post one or two of my results from that at some point but also, maybe we can add some success stories of helpful/moderate/controlled use? I think if we have any moderate benzo users who feel their doses are controlled and beneficial (and, most importantly, not taken too regularly) could help give others an idea of good practices to keep in mind.<br /><br />I use intermittently and I think I&#039;ve handled it pretty well. The key for me is to not compromise overly much like I do with other drugs. If you can use 1mg of alprazolam to calm down or help you comedown or deal with a social event that you didn&#039;t think you could handle without it go for it -- but not regularly. I was doing a similar regimen for certain events to help me loosen up, or using stimulants to loosen up and using the benzos to comedown so I could sleep. Well 1mg became 2 became a tad more and, although I didn&#039;t set a hard numerical line beforehand, when I needed to take closer to 3-4mg to get the same effect as previously that&#039;s when I said that was too far. <br /><br />If you can be honest with yourself benzos don&#039;t have to fuck up your life but I think you really have to stop it before it snowballs because it just gets harder. Also, keep in mind half-lives of your benzos as some benzos will take weeks to flush completely out of your system and that will mess with your tolerance. If you think you will be taking them on a somewhat regular basis I&#039;d advise for shorter half-life benzos, like alprazolam.

				I used to live somewhere with extremely lax prescription laws (IE, they didn&#039;t exist). I once wanted to intentionally induce anterograde amnesia, so I got several ampoules of diazepam (10mg each), put in a cannula, and slowly started injecting 50mg. I was out before I could finish pushing down the plunger. I woke up later on my couch, with blood all over my arm and the desk where I was sitting. To this day, I&#039;ve no idea what happened. I was awake enough to move to the couch (it was on the other side of the room) but I didn&#039;t remember doing it. It was fun in it&#039;s own right, and definitely informative, but it was a terrible idea, especially since I was alone at the time. I had some lingering short-term memory issues for about a month afterward.

				DAMN, just so happened to stop by the drug safety forum and saw my name and was like wait... ahhhh i posted this! Anyways, since this threads still going and we were on the topic of mixing alcohol, the worst benzo od/blackout i&#039;ve ever had i had no intention of having any alcohol that night yet woke up a day later with a full (20oz) glass of straight vodka on my bedside table. I slowly open my eyes, smell it, then just yell WHAT THE FUCK! over and over.... <br /><br />I mean that&#039;s not one of the things that really fucked my life over, but it was definitely scary and an eye opener.&nbsp; When I am on any amount of benzo I am determined to funnel as much drugs into my body as possible so thats why I cant take them but its not like a current addiction. This thread is kind of for people who fuck up and binge on like 5+ bars and have done something totally retarded that has fucked them over.

Quite a few years ago I consumed 4.5mg of xanax over the course of about three hours. It was during a period of regular experimental drug use that didn&#039;t include repetition of any particular compound inside of a month long window. At the time I kept journal of my experiences, but 4.5 mg of xanax left with with absolutely no notes, and only the memory of twice getting up off a couch to get a drink of water. I have some vague memories of being in the kitchen and being mildly frustrated because I couldn&#039;t recall why I was there, but to the bets of my knowledge aside from those two drinks I spent the entire evening on the couch, ignoring the television that was turned on in the corner of the room.<br /><br />Past that phase of my life I cannot imagine taking 6 mg of xanax, and when I do use it on occasion now it&#039;s only at the milligram or submilligram level. The person who experienced the breathing issues was at one time prescribed a good 16 mg per day. Many other benzodiazepenes have been prescribed to this person at one time or another, often in staggeringly large amounts which had the GPs calling for repeated confirmation of authority and supporting literature as they&#039;d never encountered a person with such a high requirement to get the desired therapeutic effect. Prescriptions were tapered over a couple of years and eventually discontinued.<br /><br />&nbsp; These days they have no prescription and no need for it, and as best I can tell I&#039;m their only source. They do not use regularly (perhaps once a month at a couple of milligrams) but slightly less than a decade after heavy prescription usage they retain the ability to take quantities that would fell most people. Where I&#039;d generally argue that someone who&#039;d taken 6 mg of alprazolam earlier int he day would stand out like a sore thumb this person exhibited no visible signs of intoxication when I met with them.<br /><br />If somebody told me the same story and I hadn&#039;t the benefit of this person&#039;s acquaintance I&#039;d call bullshit. I&#039;d be inclined to anyway, and if you find what I&#039;ve related improbable to the extent that you cannot accept its veracity I&#039;ll entirely understand.

DONT EVER THINK YOU&#039;RE OKAY TO DRIVE ON BENZO&#039;s NO MATTER WHAT YOUR TOLERANCE IS. <br /><br />I have totaled 2 cars once on bars and once on Valium and by some miracle never gotten a DUI or anything other than a driving too fast for conditions ticket and a lot of questioning. <br /><br />I don&#039;t exactly know what the laws are but the officer is always like &quot;I know that you&#039;re really fucked up on something but I can&#039;t give you a DUI if you haven&#039;t been drinking anything&quot; which I don&#039;t understand AT ALL... like I could have killed myself or others...<br /><br />NEVER GET BEHIND THAT WHEEL!

				Thats probably fair warning. Even if you have some tolerance, driving with over 0.5 mg or aplrazolam or 10 mg diazepam seems to be pretty dangerous. <br /><br />It&#039;s not likely to make you pull idiotic risky stunts as alchol does, but it there is a fair chance of just forgetting you&#039;re actually keeping a car on the road, as odd as that may sound. <br /><br />The worst part of it is that you don&#039;t really realize what&#039;s going on. With alcohol you feel dizzy at higher doses may notice you are swerving across lanes and such. With benzo&#039;s its a different story: you&#039;ll probably not notice something is wrong at all, until the moment you realize you have no recollection of driving the last 20 miles at all. <br /><br />This mostly happens on empty roads where you encounter no traffic, no curves, or nothing else that requires your attention, allowing you to doze off as long as you keep the steering wheel straight.

				well I am a benzo seller and I know that like every drug benzos can also be abused and abused badly and without the proper knowledge you can really f**k it up.<br />So I would suggest everybody to get as much knowledge as you can about what you are consuming . By the way never mix benzos and opiates as this can be lethal.Always remember Heath Ledgers case mate.

				If you are selling these, perhaps it would be a good idea to also supply a copy of the usage and safety leaflet with them. Since packaging usually involves quite a&nbsp; lot of wrapping paper, there should not be much argument against that :)

				well I do send the usage and safety links when I message my clients. Sending them in the packing also seems to be a good idea though.

				Once upon a time, I had a 2.0 mg a day prescription for Xanax. I supplemented my prescription with street bought bars, and had the occasional spill, so to speak. Usually this wasn&#039;t a problem because I only used therapeutic amounts during the normal working and living day, but would add another half or full bar or whatever at night time or if i had a day off and didn&#039;t plan on leaving the house. Well, this one weekend, I had run dangerously low on Xanax after eating it regularly for about 6 months. I had a very physically strenuous job that required I be on call 24 hours a day for the entire weekend. I was called in to work at 3 am one morning when I only had 3 more bars left. FUUUUUCK. So I woke up, grabbed some caffeine and popped my therapeutic dose of 0.5mg. By the time I left the job site, though, I was fresh out of Xanax, worked to the bone, dehydrated and indescribably sleep deprived. So on my way home, I decide to stop in to the supermarket for some food and water while I wait for someone to call me with some emergency alprazolam. I bought my shit, walk outside and the next thing I remember, I&#039;m on the steps and some firemen are checking my pupils, asking me questions, and bandaging my elbows and knees. I had apparently just dropped like a fish in the middle of the parking lot after buying my food and water and had a seizure which scuffed up my elbows and knees real nice.<br /><br />I know. I know. My story isn&#039;t one about taking heroic doses of benzo and fucking up my world, but one of addiction and abuse that could have ended up in a much worse place if I had managed to get to my car and had the withdrawal seizure while driving home that day at the supermarket. Alprazolam withdrawals are no joke. Neither is your life. Respect both.
