				...I don&#039;t know how to get drugs safely in my home country, so I&#039;m engaged in a bout of jet-setting drug tourism.<br /><br />Yesterday foolishly I rolled (250mg) because the substance was daring me to and I just said &quot;fuck it&quot;.<br /><br />And this was foolish because: next week I have a friend coming from my home country who&#039;s never done drugs and whom I&#039;ve convinced to roll with me.<br /><br />I&#039;ve NEVER done drugs with another human, and MDMA has always made me want to be around someone so damn bad, so this is like a childhood Christmas morning for me. I thoroughly regret doing it alone yesterday in terms of surely diminishing the upcoming experience.<br /><br />Furthermore, I have yet ANOTHER friend whom I&#039;ve invited from my home country to roll with me 8 days after that who&#039;s never done any drugs before. Again, it being such a rare chance for both of us, I can&#039;t bring myself to not do it.<br /><br />So if I have my heart set on this against my own better judgement, I want to really try to reduce harm as much as possible, while also potential the effects as much as possible.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering following a pre-load diet with lots of sunshine and exercise and some daily 5htp for the days leading up to the rolls to make a smaller dose do more for me (and if I understand correctly, help reduce oxidized dopamine from being released when the serotonin runs out). This still won&#039;t prevent receptor damage, but if it allows me to get by with 100 or 150mg that should be a start.<br /><br />Also, although I can&#039;t flat out take another drug (they would be pretty suspicious if I said, you eat this powder and I&#039;m gonna eat this other thing here), I thought about maybe adding a bit of shrooms, LSD, or 2CE (and there&#039;s still time to buy whatever else off SR) to enhance the experience with a lower dose (and put the shit on the roof locked behind a Resident Evil style puzzle lock after dropping so I can&#039;t get tempted to redose). Changing one of the rolls to MDA, which apparently works on different receptor sites, was my first choice, but the vendor sold out before my coins showed up.<br /><br />Any other advice on harm reduction or getting as empathetic and lovey an experience as possible under these circumstances?<br /><br />I&#039;ve only used MDMA a few times in my life (Feb.&nbsp; 2012,&nbsp; Aug. 18, 2013,&nbsp; and yesterday). As you can see, I&#039;m gonna have 4 rolls bunched way too close together, but once I return home it should be at least a full year before I have access again, so hopefully I can slip by without fucking up my brain or the magic permanently.

Not only do they alleviate neurotoxicity, but you will find your roll to be much more smooth and grant you with a beautiful afterglow instead of a hangover. Here are a few essential supplements that are key to a proper regimen. If you are unable to purchase these supplements or take them as advised, I will recommend that green tea, orange juice, or Emergen-C packets as they will lightly aide in providing antioxidants. However, these two should NOT be considered an all inclusive replacement. They come recommended on a &quot;better than nothing&quot; basis and pressure should be placed on picking up the appropriate supplements.<br /><br />* Na-R-ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid): This is a powerful antioxidant that eliminates free roaming reactive oxygen and nitrogen particles, in turn reducing neurotoxicity. Dose 100mg of Na-R-ALA 30 minutes prior to rolling and 2 hours into the roll. Ensure that you purchase the Na-R-ALA isomer form of ALA. While Racemic ALA is okay, Na-R-ALA is much more efficient.<br /><br />* Magnesium glycinate: Magnesium is a phenomenal substance that will alleviate the bruxism (jaw clenching) and fasciculations (muscle twitches) commonly experienced when taking MDA. Dose 400mg elemental magnesium glycinate 6 hours prior to rolling, again 30 minutes prior, and finally 2 hours into the roll. Be sure you purchase either magnesium glycinate (preferred) or magnesium citrate. The most common form, magnesium oxide, is not readily absorbed, so completely avoid it.<br /><br />* Vitamin C: The most common antioxidant out there and has been shown to mitigate MDA induced hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Dose 1,000mg of vitamin C 30 minutes prior to rolling.<br /><br />* Vitamin E: A powerful antioxidant that will seek out free radicals. Dose 400 IU 30 minutes prior to rolling.<br /><br />* Green Tea Extract (EGCG): EGCG is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. It will help with the urinary retention arising from MDA induced vasopressin release. Dose 400mg 30 minutes prior, and 2 hours into the roll.<br /><br />* 5-HTP: 5-HTP is the direct precursor to serotonin. Supplementing 100mg of 5-HTP with 400mg of EGCG (EGCG will help 5-HTP cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently) at bedtime for 5-7 days after rolling will aid your body in restoring serotonin to their proper levels. Warning: 5-HTP can cause cardiac fibrosis when used in high doses over extended periods of time, so avoid taking 5-HTP in high doses for more than 5-7 days.<br /><br />* Melatonin: Melatonin is created from serotonin, and since your serotonin levels will be low, taking a melatonin supplement will help you fall asleep. Melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant. Take 5-10mg of melatonin prior to falling asleep after rolling.<br /><br />In the end, the best advice that can be offered is to simply be smart. Know your limits, follow common sense, and remember exactly why you&#039;re taking MDA. Cherish and value the experience; don&#039;t tarnish it by abusing it and harming your mind and body.<br /><br />Vanquish

				I hesitated before typing this, since my main goal in participating in the forums is to provide some harm reduction to others if possible.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about it. I&#039;ve rolled up to 4 days in a row, every weekend at the least for months, and ten years later I&#039;m a parent, a business type and a respected member of my community (volunteering and public service stuff). <br /><br />In my uninformed opinion, you risk doing more harm to yourself worrying than anything. Stress is a killer.

				I know people who took E for weeks on end let alone 3 days in a week or 4.<br /><br />Occasionally partying on that scale is fine. Think about people in bands, some must have been on E for entire tours! <br /><br />Also, thanks for mentioning your plans as it helps when you talk about your drug use in an honest manner to people like us who just accept someone rolling 4 times in a week as just another thing we all done in the day!<br /><br />And as said by above, todays rollers, are tomorrows people who help run things, who do something productive, pay taxes so I can claim for my car being a write off due to some pothole.<br /><br />BUT - do not roll all the time - you&#039;ll end up doing a dance to the local psychiatric unit if you rolled for 100 days on the run.<br /><br />MDMA has a tolerance issue, you will always use more IF you roll a lot. 90mg does me fine, even 80mg.<br /><br />150mg made me see treble my friend.<br /><br />Red.

				Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing of the face, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep.<br />For a vitamin c overdose. But I think it&#039;s very unlikely that this happens. I would not take 1g of it at once though, it doesn&#039;t seem to make much sense. Maybe some depot capsules with such a high amount would make sense because it is released slowly and the body has the time to metabolize it instead of being flooded with it an in need of flushing it out quickly.<br /><br />I only take 120mg a few hours before together with 300mg magnesium and I&#039;m doing heroic amounts of MDMA most of the time. 120mg is already 150% of what is recommended for a day. Maybe next time I&#039;ll consider 500mg but that would really be the maximum.

				Not the best idea, but not too bad.<br />I can&#039;t believe you have taken MDMA by yourself and never with other people.<br />The whole point of it IMO is to talk with people and you feel like you have an amazing connection with everyone.<br />You will find it so much better with other people... And also with music.

				I take 1000 mg of C every day.&nbsp; One of the most famous Chemist/Physicists/Activists ever, Linus Pauling, advocated using up to 3 grams a day and did so himself (IV).&nbsp; He, and many others, were convinced that high dose vitamin &#039;C&#039; not only warded off the common cold but also pushed for it&#039;s use as an adjunctive therapy for cancer patients.&nbsp; It&#039;s water soluble so you&#039;re okay taking that dose and I even take mine on an empty stomach every morning with no ill effects ever.&nbsp; Have fun.

Not only do they alleviate neurotoxicity, but you will find your roll to be much more smooth and grant you with a beautiful afterglow instead of a hangover. Here are a few essential supplements that are key to a proper regimen. If you are unable to purchase these supplements or take them as advised, I will recommend that green tea, orange juice, or Emergen-C packets as they will lightly aide in providing antioxidants. However, these two should NOT be considered an all inclusive replacement. They come recommended on a &quot;better than nothing&quot; basis and pressure should be placed on picking up the appropriate supplements.<br /><br />* Na-R-ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid): This is a powerful antioxidant that eliminates free roaming reactive oxygen and nitrogen particles, in turn reducing neurotoxicity. Dose 100mg of Na-R-ALA 30 minutes prior to rolling and 2 hours into the roll. Ensure that you purchase the Na-R-ALA isomer form of ALA. While Racemic ALA is okay, Na-R-ALA is much more efficient.<br /><br />* Magnesium glycinate: Magnesium is a phenomenal substance that will alleviate the bruxism (jaw clenching) and fasciculations (muscle twitches) commonly experienced when taking MDA. Dose 400mg elemental magnesium glycinate 6 hours prior to rolling, again 30 minutes prior, and finally 2 hours into the roll. Be sure you purchase either magnesium glycinate (preferred) or magnesium citrate. The most common form, magnesium oxide, is not readily absorbed, so completely avoid it.<br /><br />* Vitamin C: The most common antioxidant out there and has been shown to mitigate MDA induced hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Dose 1,000mg of vitamin C 30 minutes prior to rolling.<br /><br />* Vitamin E: A powerful antioxidant that will seek out free radicals. Dose 400 IU 30 minutes prior to rolling.<br /><br />* Green Tea Extract (EGCG): EGCG is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. It will help with the urinary retention arising from MDA induced vasopressin release. Dose 400mg 30 minutes prior, and 2 hours into the roll.<br /><br />* 5-HTP: 5-HTP is the direct precursor to serotonin. Supplementing 100mg of 5-HTP with 400mg of EGCG (EGCG will help 5-HTP cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently) at bedtime for 5-7 days after rolling will aid your body in restoring serotonin to their proper levels. Warning: 5-HTP can cause cardiac fibrosis when used in high doses over extended periods of time, so avoid taking 5-HTP in high doses for more than 5-7 days.<br /><br />* Melatonin: Melatonin is created from serotonin, and since your serotonin levels will be low, taking a melatonin supplement will help you fall asleep. Melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant. Take 5-10mg of melatonin prior to falling asleep after rolling.<br /><br />In the end, the best advice that can be offered is to simply be smart. Know your limits, follow common sense, and remember exactly why you&#039;re taking MDA. Cherish and value the experience; don&#039;t tarnish it by abusing it and harming your mind and body.<br /><br />Vanquish<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Quick question vanquish. I usually just stick to my &quot;High Antioxidant&quot; (Heavy Vitamin C and E dosage) multivitamins from Trader Joe&#039;s immediately before my roll as you said, and 5-htp before bed the nights following it. How necessary would you deem all the other things you listed? 5-htp already sketches me out a bit since it&#039;s pretty damn powerful for a supplement, so I don&#039;t want to be stacking that among many other things.

				I would prefer eating cashew-nuts anytime over 5-HTP. In my country 5-HTP is not available as a product since the 90s because it is suppose to be dangerous and because it was replaced by SSRI&#039;s.<br /><br />EDIT: btw the 1g ascorbic acid had no bad side effects. ;)

				I have only been rolling for a few months, and for the past 4-5 weeks it has been once/twice a week.<br /><br />In my experience so far, frequency isn&#039;t that bad. What&#039;s BAD is when you&#039;re coming down from your roll and you start justifying to yourself all the different reasons why you should keep redosing. One time after originally dropping 250 mg, and redosing twice off of 100-150mg, I convinced myself yet again to redose. after already going through about .5g, I redosed by chewing up an entire .3 nug. The .3 did literally nothing in terms of bringing back any sort of euphoria or roll. Just chattered my fucking jaw off and had some strange looking holes in the back of my mouth the next day from clenching so hard after that point. Legit felt cognitively impaired for a few days after that. Couldn&#039;t do any kind of basic math in my head.<br /><br />TL;DR: Frequency wont get you, but large redoses will.

				2C-B is not useable as a MDMA replacement at all. Very verrry different effects. But if you want to try it for the body effect mostly than try 10-15mg, for more visual components use 20-40mg or more.

				I remember xtc as a fairly common party drug in the 90s and noone seemed to care about any long term effects back then. Doses used to be a lot smaller compared to today though, those tablets were probably under 100 mg each and it required at least two of them to get a decent effect.<br /><br />Noone cared about any health effect either, apart from dehydration from dancing too much and drinking too little. I suppose that risk is as big as it ever was, but you should be more cafeful with tablets these days as they often contain as much as 200+ mg mdma, and you migh be better off starting with half a tab.

				Thanks for all the advice.<br /><br />For a time I was considering asking the first person to do acid with me instead, but I think it would be irresponsible of me to introduce someone completely inexperienced to LSD.

If nothing else, the rolls are sure to be intense for both of the virgins, and the happiness of being responsible for their experience will give me a sufficient boost in warm and happy feelings during the roll even if the actual drug is underwhelming (0.5g ÷ 4 means we&#039;ll each only have 125mg doses unless I divert some of theirs to me :) )<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=212484.msg1548814#msg1548814">Quote from: Dingo Ate My Drugs on September 19, 2013, 12:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not the best idea, but not too bad.<br />I can&#039;t believe you have taken MDMA by yourself and never with other people.<br />The whole point of it IMO is to talk with people and you feel like you have an amazing connection with everyone.<br />You will find it so much better with other people...

				Yes literal heat will help intensify your buzz in between the &#039;rushes&#039; which can fade over the duration of the experience.&nbsp; MDMA is a sex enhancement drug!&nbsp; A lot depends upon the surroundings in which you take the E.&nbsp; I usually do it in a club which is very different to taking it at home while relaxing with friends.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I think you&#039;re worrying far too much about all the safety implications - important though they are - you&#039;re overthinking things.&nbsp; If you&#039;re dancing your tits off all night to house music then it&#039;s important to keep hydrated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just don&#039;t overdo things.&nbsp; 125 mg is, IMO, the optimum amount especially for a noob.&nbsp; If it&#039;s good MDMA you shouldn&#039;t feel the need to redose. The comedown won&#039;t be such a bitch either.&nbsp; Furthermore, like many drugs or alcohol, the more MDMA you consume the more mangled you get, and this increases the likelihood of you completely forgetting the whole experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Forget the weed if you dislike it, it&#039;s just my personal preference.&nbsp; It restores the &#039;rush&#039; or &#039;roll&#039; when it fades.&nbsp; <br /><br />The whole experience should be fun, preloading with all these vitamins seems like overkill to me. I doubt they&#039;ll do you any harm but in my experience of MDMA (26 years), it&#039;s unnecessary.&nbsp; Get plenty of rest the following day, eat well and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;

That place was awesome! - 3 floors of the best music, rammed with some of the nicest people I have ever met (all on MDMA!). They held nights every weekend throughout the early 90&#039;s, with an all-nighter every fortnight.<br /><br />That was a long time ago, and back then no one did any pre or post loading, that&#039;s not to say that loading isn&#039;t a good idea, just that no one seemed to care about any of the potential after-effects or long-term-effects at that time. I would like to point out that everyone was quite lean! Dancing all night and only consuing water i guess!<br />I had some pretty nasty comedowns after a few years, especially when I started having to up my dose due to tolerance. As soon as Sterns was closed I started to lose interest in MDMA, I think because I had classified the drug as a &quot;shared-experience&quot;. <br /><br />Up until this year I hadn&#039;t taken a pill or any MDMA for almost 20 years! I&#039;d done a bit of coke and a little hash, but nothing else.<br />3 months ago I was at a bar and a friend gave me one of those Green Androids. I put it in my pocket and totally forgot about it until a few days later.<br />I looked the pill up online where I found a lot of people saying some of these were 200mg+, this scared me a little. I remembered that most of the pills I used to take were rumored to be around 150mg, so I cut the Droid in half and dropped it - 45 minutes later I was rolling all over the place, it was like my first pill all over again, but in some ways better. Mainly because the rushes of euphoria were also accompanied by memories, back from the nights/days of fun I used to have. It was a terrific experience and the shocking thing is it happened whilst I was on my own, and just like my first pill, I will never forget it.<br /><br />@anothergirl<br />With regard to your friends, I think an important thing to remember is that there is no other feeling like MDMA. If they&#039;ve never felt it before then the chances are a small amount is sill going to give them an amazing experience. I used to abuse this drug 20 years ago and that half a droid gave me one hell of a fun ride, and it could only have been around 100mg worth of MDMA.<br />With regard to the temptation of re-dosing, it can be difficult to control, perhaps dropping a benzo might help. Fall asleep before the lil&#039; devil on your shoulder has had a chance to tempt you into throwing more down.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Considering that, back in the 90s people were taking mdma like it was candy and providing for some means of stopping the roll like benzo&#039;s was very rare.<br /><br />Back then the occasional death did occur, but those where attributed to dehydration mostly. This is also when the combination of xtc and bottled water started. <br /><br />The doses in pills back then and those for sale now are very far apart. Back in the 90s a tablet containing 100 mg of mdma or so would be considered good/potent. Once it got people to move few would re-dose either, and many would combine them with moderate alcohol consumption. <br /><br />Current xtc tablets contain double the amount of mdma compared to those of the the 90s - so take half a tablet to have some fun, or the whole thing if you want to be seriously affected putting your life at some risk.

				If they are this close minded then they didn&#039;t deserve the MDMA anyway.<br />How are pills safer then crystals? It&#039;s much easier to cover other substances in pills then in rocks.<br />Did they think it was cocaine or what? Again don&#039;t give them MDMA in the future, pills or crystals. What are they thinking these pills are made of?<br /><br />Very sorry for you, but maybe it&#039;s better this way because these people don&#039;t seem very smart. You deserve developed and intelligent friends.<br /><br />&lt;hugs anothergirl&gt;

				I guess everyone has their limits to what they will or will not do. Personally i do not really see any difference between ingesting a power, tablet or capsule, but perhaps some people have a different perspective on this (mainly that tablets come from pharma factories and powders generally do not). <br /><br />On the other hand i would personally never inject something that came off the streets or was acquired through SR without very good assurances.

It sounds like your friend&#039;s response was all to do with their perception, perhaps skewed by media attention on hard drugs? I&#039;m not trying to suggest that the media should be completely ignored, only that publicity with regard to &#039;hard&#039; drugs tends to show powder or crystal etc.....<br />As stated by others, there could be anything in a pill, whereas your crystal was probably as close to pure as they could have hoped for. <br />I&#039;m starting to think that people assume these pills are being manufactured at plants akin to those owned by Roche or GlaxoSmithkline!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				It would have been one thing if I had just popped it on them, but we discussed this back home in advance, so it&#039;s extra retarded of them. Of course when trying to ask them to justify or explain their changes of heart it all just amounted to the same nonsense misconceptions we had discussed in advance anyway. Oh well. Suffice it to say I forbade them from drinking alcohol or caffeine in my room or in my sight while here and we&#039;re not on good terms unfortunately.<br /><br />Maybe they were just more interested in taking advantage of a free place to stay and someone to show them around the city. <br /><br />I still have 250mg, not to mention all the salvia and other stuff I never finished. Maybe I should just give it to some random stoners sitting on the street or something.

				If you want to be safe then just be safe? You know your limits..don&#039;t push them..<br />Your friends that have no tolerance, start them off small. If they want a lil more then go for it, don;t let them fully indulge though bc who knows how they could react. <br /><br />
