				hey guys, I&#039;ve wanted to trip on shrooms for a few years now. I&#039;ve done a lot of research and I had never been able to find any quality mushrooms in the small town I live in. Untilllllllll.....I found the holy grail, The SR. <br /><br />So I&#039;m ordering 1/2 oz of Penis Envy mushrooms once SR goes back up. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to have my first trip on potent penis envys. (Start off hardcore right?) I&#039;m not sure where my first trip will take place possibly by myself in my room, but I&#039;m also planning on taking some at college on campus with some buddies one day. We&#039;re just going to sit in the smokers circle and chill. Or maybe end up doing some exploration. <br /><br />SO what are you guys&#039; insights, recommendations? Thanks!

				That&#039;s a perfect profound psycho therapeutic dose for your first time.&nbsp; I must warn you though that the experience will be VERY profound, and you WILL be a changed person after, not only this but the trip will be &#039;difficult&#039;.&nbsp; But try to ride with the flow knowing that you&#039;ll be a better person in the end.&nbsp; Shrooms IMO was always more &#039;in your face&#039; and very much more introspective than LSD.&nbsp; Enjoy, and be safe!&nbsp; Remember, don&#039;t be scared, it will all turn out better.&nbsp; Now meth on the other hand.....

				I&#039;m ready for a profound lifechanging trip that&#039;s what I&#039;m looking forward to and its what I&#039;m interested in shrooms for. The question is how much of a dose should I take? I&#039;m pretty small bodywise 125 lbs with no psychedelic experience but with plenty of cannabis/few other drugs experience. <br /><br />I heard people take less of a dose of penis envys compared to cubes because of potency.

				I hear the recommended dosage is 2-3 grams, but I&#039;m not sure about Penis Envy. My suggestion is to eat 3 grams, wait an hour or two, and see how you feel -- especially if you&#039;re new to psychedelics. If you want more, eat another gram. After that, you should be good. I like to toke when I do shrooms as well; they have great synergy.

				It sounds great. I love shrooms. I&#039;d recommend doing no more than an eighth. That will be more than enough to rocket you into the stratosphere. I know mushrooms seem relatively benign, but you can still get in over your head. I know from experience. But it&#039;s an extremely fun high, both with&nbsp; friends and alone. College is the perfect time to test the waters.<br /><br />I&#039;d start off indoors or at least away from the public eye until the peak has passed and you have started to plateaue.&nbsp; I&#039;d say about an hour and a half from the onset of effects which would be about 45mins. after ingestion. You&#039;ll know when the time&#039;s right to start exploring. In fact, one of my favorite things about shrooms is the feeling you get when you change place and setting. It&#039;s a wonderful sensation.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only purchased from Rocker here on SR so I can only vouch for him/her. But I&#039;m sure other vendors can be trusted, just don&#039;t be fooled by claims that one strain is stronger than others, even penis envy. It&#039;s more about the growing conditions and skill of the grower. Rocker&#039;s product is grown from isolates so it&#039;s potent.<br /><br />Good luck and have fun,<br />Crisis

				I hate to disagree with Holly but do NOT ingest 1/2 oz. on your first time (or any other time as far as I&#039;m concerned but certainly not until you&#039;re experienced).<br /><br />It will fuck you up bad.<br /><br />Anything less than 2g, you run the risk of not experiencing the full effects but that&#039;s alright. There&#039;s always the second trip to look forward to.<br /><br />Think about having fun, not about having a religious experience.

				Defined &#039;fucked up&#039;.&nbsp; Are you talking about severe psychological distraught / impairment? Shrooms is very safe, granted the dosage would be completely earth shattering, I don&#039;t believe it is unsafe given safe set/setting/sitter preparation.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lemon tekked a half ounce and had the most difficult yet most rewarding experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ahhhh, <br /><br />The very first time, I definitely remember mine. Everybody here has the bases covered as far as dosage wise goes- I went 2.5 grams my first time and it was a perfect dosage- I also mixed in a blunt of good weed as well.&nbsp; Remember, if you start feeling your muscles tense up, have to shit, throwup or get some stomach craps that is completely normal. Embrace it, this is when you know they are starting to come on. Also, if you are going to shroom make sure that if anyone is accompanying you that they are shrooming as well. The first time I did it 2 people walked in at my peak and totally freaked me the fuck out. <br /><br />Have fun and enjoy the experience. You are about to have your psychological word broken wide open. And in a good way.

Perhaps. You have no idea the psychological makeup of Technik or anyone else here. Tech said nothing about having a sitter or having someone with experience guiding them. Tech is still misguided (no offense Tech) into believing that some strains of cubes are more potent than others which indicates some research but not enough. Any drug, including psychedelics, that allows for critical thinking and deep insight has the potential to break you. It&#039;s all about the baggage you bring.<br /><br />As far as physical impairment, absolutely. 1/2 oz. would probably led Tech to nausea and most likely vomiting. That&#039;s before passing out. I&#039;m not certain if that&#039;s true but I can take a pretty good guess. No matter what, it will be a very unpleasant ride. And just because you survive the trip, doesn&#039;t make it profound.<br /><br />You make no indication of your experience with mushrooms before your 1/2 oz. journey. I think advising someone to choke down 14g, especially a first timer, is reckless and foolhardy. Even experienced users at the Shroomery admit that 7-10g is beyond heroic and I believe that most would agree with me that 14g is way too much and probably a waste of good mushroom.<br /><br />Technik, if you&#039;re concerned about having a profound or near religious experience, I&#039;d suggest trying DMT or mescaline. You&#039;ll get what you&#039;re aiming for without the risk of overdose which is what 1/2 oz. of shrooms surely is.<br /><br />I have nothing but respect for you Holly but this is a drug safety forum and we need to make that a priority especially when we don&#039;t know all the factors involved.

				Thanks for the input everyone. I was never planning on taking the whole 1/2 oz at once. (I&#039;m not that crazy.)

Especially since I haven&#039;t delved into psychedelics yet (At least for another week or two). <br /><br />As far as research goes, I&#039;ve seen a few people on the shroomery suggesting that penis envy&#039;s contain a little bit more psilo content than other mushrooms but they could be wrong. But I have heard trip reports stating that PE&#039;s were unlike other strains they have tried.<br /><br />I will definitely be back here updating on how my first trip goes.

I hope I didn&#039;t come across as insulting or condescending. That was never my intent. From your writing, you seem bright and you&#039;re savvy enough to find your way here to the SR and smart enough to ask questions. I don&#039;t believe you to be uneducated, just inexperienced with mushrooms and there&#039;s nothing wrong with that. I was just concerned because you never stated the amount you were going to dose.<br /><br />You did enough research to know that penis envy is considered more potent than other cubes but a lot of people regurgitate that info without any real research to back it up. Even Roger Rabbit, an old-timer over at the Shroomery, propagates the myth. And it could very well be true but I believe that even if the psilocybin and psilocin levels are higher, it&#039;s so minute, it might as well be trace and the effects negligible. Any perceived differences is probably placebo. It&#039;s only once you start experimenting with Copelandias and Semilanceatas does the effects and differences become noticable.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you checked out the Shroomery. It&#039;s a wealth of information and even if the maturity level isn&#039;t what it is here, there&#039;s a lot to be learned there.<br /><br />And I hope that my debate with Holly didn&#039;t appear to be heated. It&#039;s just with drugs, you can never be too careful. Holly is a well regarded member here on the forums with a lot of information to share and that&#039;s why I was a little dumbfounded at his/hers suggestion of dosing a 1/2 oz.in one sitting.<br /><br />Holly has the experience, I&nbsp; presume, and the chops to do that amount at one time. You and I, do not. And if Holly really did 14g at one time, and I have no doubt that he or she did, that&#039;s one of the largest, if not the largest, amounts I&#039;ve ever heard of anyone doing and I love to hear more about the experience. It must have been insane.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad there&#039;s people like Holly who are willing to go that distant even if i&#039;m not. It&#039;s only because of people like that are we able to push the bounderies of what humans are capable of.<br /><br />Be safe and have fun,<br />Crisis

				Set and setting are very important. Be at a place you feel comfortable for your experience, and just ride it out. Shrooms are pretty mild when speaking about psychedelics in general, but don&#039;t underestimate them. My first time I had some very potent Golden Teachers, and I took maybe 1.7 and was just waaaaaaaay out there. Be in a good mindstate and attitude, as well as very introspective, and you&#039;ll have a great time with mushies.

				my advice: take 1/16 your first time. work your way up. if they are potent, this should be enough for a strong trip. if 1/16 is a strong trip, 1/8 will be a heroic dose. don&#039;t just jump right into a heroic dose, that will be too much if you&#039;re not expecting it.

				thanks for all the replies everyone. I just placed my order of PE&#039;s and am excited as can be.<br /><br />shredder your use of multiple negatives confused me but there was no chance I was going to take that much at once. I&#039;m not even sure I could stomach all that lol.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to go with the suggest 1/16th or maybe 2 for the first time. And we&#039;ll see where things go from there. I&#039;m hoping to have a profound and life changing trip. I&#039;m hoping to be able to do some meditation and think about myself. Hopefully I&#039;ll gain some insight on how to stop thinking about my crazy ex girlfriend. Who still pops up in my mind even though I moved away from where she is. I lost my v to her at 17 was with her for a year and couldn&#039;t leave her when she cheated a few times and treated me like shit. I know I was stupid but hey I was young and she was fun in the sack. Unfortunately, it obviously left a mental scar and she pops up in my head throughout the day and thinking about it just puts me in a bad mood. <br /><br />And since then I&#039;ve been with other girls but idk why she still pops up in my head so much. While I was with her I swear I was losing my mind because of what she put me through. I&#039;m hoping I can find some peace and answers with some self reflection on these bad boys.<br /><br />/pathetic life story<br /><br />That being said. I have 9.08 btc left that I&#039;m trying to figure out what to purchase. <br /><br />EDIT: I ended up buying 3g of hash from swch. I guess my lsd and 2c adventures will wait for another time. I&#039;m very excited to try this hash as the only hash I&#039;ve tried was self made &quot;hand pressed&quot; hash and some low quality hash made from washing my grinder in iso. And in my area nobody smokes hash that I know.<br /><br />Thanks everyone. Will be back in say 2 weeks for a nice little trip report (from memory)<br />

It&#039;s only once you start experimenting with Copelandias and Semilanceatas does the effects and differences become noticable.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Crisis is right on point here.&nbsp; Penis envy is often claimed to be more potent, but I&#039;ve honestly never been able to tell the difference, and I&#039;ve eaten PE and many other strains multiple times, at various dosages.<br /><br />Speaking of dosage: I have mad respect for Holly, who definitely knows her shit regarding psychedelics.&nbsp; Despite this, I will also recommend against eating 14g of cubensis (I know you already said you wouldn&#039;t!), but for a different reason: it&#039;d be a waste under these circumstances.&nbsp; Your body has no psilocybin/psilocin tolerance, so ANY sort of heroic dose (&gt;5g) would be indistinguishably intense.&nbsp; As an inexperienced user, you would undoubtedly lose your ego at both 5g or 14g (as would I), and beyond that it&#039;s difficult to judge if it&#039;s &quot;more&quot; intense.&nbsp; Therefore, if you honestly wanted that intense of a trip, just go ahead and eat 5-6g, save the rest for later.<br />However, since it seems your interest lies in something more beginner-friendly (will this be your first trip on any substance?), I&#039;d recommend 2-3.5g.&nbsp; I think you&#039;ll find an 1/8 more than sufficient, especially since you only weigh 125 lbs.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14145.msg138466#msg138466">Quote from: zerostate976 on March 05, 2012, 05:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">dont know if this has been mentioned but keep a few packets of sugar with you. if the trip isnt going well and is really freaking you out eating the sugar will take you out of it</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i highly doubt this is true, if the trip goes south just remind yourself it will go away and that its just a drug you wanted to do :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Zerostate is right, you&#039;ll probably find you have a lot of mental control over your trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s very empowering when, if you happen to start feeling freaked out, you remember that you don&#039;t have to let this be negative and it suddenly...isn&#039;t anymore.&nbsp; Good, calming music can also do wonders under this situation.&nbsp; If you&#039;re uncomfortable and you don&#039;t know why, try changing the music.&nbsp; You might be surprised.<br /><br />Oh, and yeah, I&#039;ve heard the &quot;sugar ends the trip&quot; thing before.&nbsp; It&#039;s not chemically true, but because of the above paragraph, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it calmed someone down who believed in it, due to placebo effect.&nbsp; Sorry it won&#039;t work on you now, technik! ;)&nbsp; Dancing the Macarena WILL bring you out of the trip though, so no worries.<br /><br />Hope you have a great time, come back and tell us how things go!

It&#039;s just that mushrooms taste kind of gross. It might make them go down easier. They&#039;re not truffles for sure.

				I had my first trip yesterday. I ate 2 gs then an extra .5 once I started feeling the effects. I had an intense euphoric blast and was loving the world. There were times I was laughing uncontrollably facedown in my bed. I saw the ground morph and ripple. I also heard the words &quot;the answers you&#039;ve been looking for have always been in front of you. I kept repeating those words to myself. I was on the highway in the passenger seat listening to dubstep marveling at how my depth perception would change and morph and everything looked so beautiful. <br /><br />The comedown was a little rough for me. Words didn&#039;t make any sense and I was pacing for a bit. My mind was thinking in dubstep. I guess it was because I was listening to dubstep while I started feeling the effects.&nbsp; It lasted ~5 hours. Once I came down I decided to eat another 2.5 and I barely felt any effect at all. I wish I wouldn&#039;t have wasted the extra 2.5. I feel like I found peace and clarity and will be able to live my life more efficiently. I was able to let go of some emotional baggage yesterday. It was a very powerful deep life-changing experience. I did it by myself and in front of unsuspecting family. I was able to control myself but had to walk away once I started getting the giggles. Speaking to family members was a little bit difficult as words weren&#039;t making much sense to me at the time. <br /><br />As for the visuals, I had visuals but they weren&#039;t as intense as I was expecting although I could tell these were very potent because of the high and euphoria I experienced. We&#039;ll see how it goes today when I eat that eighth. I was laying down in my bed looking at my comforter morph and become liquidlike. I was looking at this piece of cheesecake growing and getting smaller and I finally decided to eat it. It was orgasmic. I thought eating food when I had the munchies was good but wow. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m planning on taking an eighth today hopefully I&#039;ll feel the same effects as I did yesterday. Overall my first purchase was a great success and I was able to stay in escrow. <br /><br />

It builds up notoriously fast and takes awhile to dissipate. I agree with Appa, one week minimum between dosing but from experience, I&#039;ve found two weeks to be optimal for maximum effects but go ahead and try, I&#039;m curious to see how it works for you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found that as far as visuals go, you need to dose fairly high to have any but that&#039;s just for me. The first time I tried mushrooms, I split an eighth with two other friends. All I saw was a slight shimmering on shiny objects such as cd cases. My friend, on the other hand, was seeing light trails. The effects vary from person to person.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the experience.

				Well guys, I woke up in the hospital last night at 12 am. <br /><br />Let me explain what happened from my memory and from what I was told. Ok I get to my friends house, smoke a bowl, then I eat a little less than 4.7 gs. Then we go outside to the side of his house and smoke another bowl. We go inside and his room mate kicks me and my buddies friend out. So my friends buddy goes home and its just me and my friend.<br /><br />We go longboarding to the park. We&#039;re skating around and this is my last clear memory. I&#039;m speaking gibberish at this point and can&#039;t remember if I saw any visuals. We went to go sit down on a bench. And that&#039;s the last thing I remember. My friend told me I had been speaking gibberish and then once we sat down I became quiet. From what I was told I ran away from my friend without my longboard or cellphone. He thought I was just playing around but I disappeared. My friend spent two hours looking for me.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I&#039;m not exactly sure what I was doing as I can&#039;t remember. I thought I was dreaming. I remember being around a bunch of portable trailers and thinking everyone could hear my thoughts. I remember seeing a bunch of people staring at me and then I remember this guy in doctors gloves telling me to sit down. It didn&#039;t make any sense to me. Then the next thing I remember a female police officer trying to tell me she&#039;s just trying to get me home. <br /><br />Nothing made any sense to me and I thought I was still dreaming. I starting grabbing her and touching her because I thought she was pretty and I even apparently grabbed her gun holster. I kept asking her why she did this to me. Who knows what I was talking about. I seriously thought I was dreaming. I saw a male police officer who looked exactly like an old soccer coach from far away so this made me think I was dreaming again. The police officers thought I was severely autistic as I was not answering questions and acting erratically.<br /><br />They police officers apparently found my friends address written down on a piece of paper. I was taken to my friends house. His mom was horrified probably because I was acting very strange. I was taken to a hospital in handcuffs. I remember punching a male nurse. I still thought I was dreaming and nothing made any sense. I completely lost all self control. There was this beautiful young nurse I was kissing all over her hands and asking her to dance with me ... lol<br /><br />My mom ended up begging the cops not to charge me with anything and I got away with a warning and an overnight stay in the hospital. My mom told me I climbed a fence into a school and was jumping in front of cars and climbing ontop of shit. So the people called the police.<br /><br />It sucks that I had an amazing life changing revealing trip the day before and then the next I have the worst complete loss of self control. I&#039;m probably not going to mess with mushrooms again for some time. The thing that sucks is that if I would have taken an eighth like my friends did I would have maintained self control. Or I could have taken the same dose and been fine inside of his house chillen.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read horror stories about people on acid losing it on erowid. I never thought I would end up in a similar situation.<br />

Reflect on what happened to you last night, and reflect on what happened to you during your good experience. Maybe you weren&#039;t in the right mind-state or environment to use mushrooms. Reflection within oneself is something many people forget that psychedelics are about. They simply take them to trip, when their use and properties are far more profound. Don&#039;t take the mushies and go outside next time. Take them in an area where you feel comfortable and secure, and have someone experienced with you in terms of psychedelics to attempt to keep you safe and calm. It could have ended up much worse for you, but I have a feeling you were being watched over. I hope you have a far more positive experience next time.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the replies everyone. Yes I realize that the setting was very important. I was comfortable the day before at my own house and had an awesome time. But I guess I just took too much. The thing is, I would have been fine if we didn&#039;t get kicked out of my friends house. <br /><br />And my friend that I was with does have experience with psychedelics both natural and synthetic. But when he saw me run away he just thought I was playing around. Next thing he knows I&#039;m gone without a phone. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to reflect on my past two experiences but they differ so greatly. I can&#039;t really reflect too much on my bad trip because I don&#039;t remember much from skating in the park around 4 pm to waking up in the hospital at 12 am.&nbsp; What sucks is how I told a lot of my friends I had an amazing life changing controlled trip and then telling them that I lost my mind for around 7 hours. <br /><br />Thanks for the offer holly, things are a bit heated for me at the moment though. I&#039;d be interested in trying lsd but inside my house at night listening to music. So I won&#039;t have another scare lol.&nbsp; I think my mom will be checking my mail illegally for a bit. Or not... But my friend told my mother that I bought the shrooms off the internet. I told my mom he was just trying to save his own ass lol. <br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m glad it didn&#039;t end up worse for you! Haven&#039;t checked up on this thread in a while. As I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve learned set and setting is extremely important, but knowing your dose is even more important! When ~5g mushrooms I&#039;ll definitely be on an entirely different plane and if not then the OEVs, CEVs, and introspection are too much for me if I&#039;m not sitting quietly. A public place is far from where you should be. I&#039;m glad you are OK and wish you better luck in the future.

				You&#039;re very lucky the police were that generous. Shit like this gives psychadelics a bad name. I know you said you&#039;ll stay away from shrooms for a while but for fuck&#039;s sake to all psych noobs, stay in your house until you are experienced enough to venture out. Then only venture out to a safe place with a sober sitter. <br /><br />
