				are you in america? the health system in america being what it is i hear so much about clear cut hospital trips being passed over.<br /><br />is it bright red blood like from a cut? or is it congealed (hard to tell with shit mixed in obviously..) bright red gushing blood means you nicked something in youre arse, a sharp piece of food that didnt get digested ect. congealed blood means you have internal bleeding somewhere more serious. both should really be checked out by a doctor, the latter more so, but if there is a lot of blood then its a concern, plus arse cuts have a tendency to get infected.

				Rise, I would definitely go get this checked out- especially since you described it as a &quot;blood bath&quot; the past few bowel movements you have had. Medically, the brighter the blood is the closer it is to the anus. If it is darker then it is higher up inside your GI track. Typically if it is bright red then it is hemorrhoid related however it could be anything from diverticulitis to an anal fissure depending on what color the blood actually is. Either way something is going on internally and you never want to fuck around when it comes to that. See a doctor bro, protect yourself. <br /><br />I too use opiates and counteract my bowel movements with plenty of water, fruit and fiber in order to keep things healthy. Keeping your GI tract healthy when using opiates is key. I&#039;d also take a few days break if I were you, possibly even a week or several if you can. Your body is definitely telling you something- you need to listen.&nbsp;

				generally I think this is one of those seek professional medical attention as soon as possible situations. i hope you are alright.<br /><br />and as for oxy slowing everything down, it definitely will to some extent as the opiates are one of the best at reducing gut motility. I wouldnt think that one dose would have major effects since it will only be reduced about eight to twelve hours. <br /><br />

				If you&#039;re constipated then your forcing the anus (external sphincter) while trying to shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s bad, even worse if you&#039;re sitting in a toilet.&nbsp; &nbsp;That fucks up the whole area.<br /><br />Our body wasn&#039;t designed to shit while seated, but to squat.<br /><br />Add spicy food and a poor diet with little or no fibers to the mix and situation only gets worse.<br /><br />Also, toilet paper irritates the anus (if you apply too much force to wipe), use baby wipes and/or simply wash with water after #2.<br /><br /><br />My family has a history of hemorrhoids.&nbsp; Three things in sequence fuck me up:&nbsp; &nbsp;if I eat too much spicy food, drink too much alchool and sit continuosly for many hours in front of a computer, then I&#039;ll be menstruating through my ass the following day after #2.<br />

				Sounds like the opiates are hardening your poo, causing it to cut up your asshole (anal fissures) or rupture preexisting hemorrhoids. Bright red blood is usually a good indicator of this. Don&#039;t panic, but make sure you get it checked out by a doctor ASAP.

				Are you *shitting blood* or are you *wiping blood* ? Big difference. What another poster said about bright vs. dark red is accurate - Brighter red = closer to exit. <br /><br />Remember that really any amount of blood in the stool looks like a friggin&#039; bloodbath if you&#039;ve never seen it before. If you keep that in mind and you decide you aren&#039;t exaggerating, that you really are having a BLOODBATH, go to a hospital like now. <br /><br />BUT . . . The constipation caused by opiates (or just plain old poor diet) can cause the bright red blood. <br /><br />Another question to ask yourself - is there pain? Is it outside? Inside? If it&#039;s pain in your butt, and you are wiping blood, and it&#039;s bright red, that&#039;s classic hemorrhoid symptoms. If it&#039;s pain in your &quot;guts&quot; and you are shitting blood and it&#039;s dark red, that&#039;s a sign of internal injury and can be a medical emergency.&nbsp;

				First of all, you can have internal bleeding so you should probably visit the dr.&nbsp; If you choose not to:<br />Okay, so diet can be really important when you&#039;re doing opiates because they can cause constipation.&nbsp; So, what I would say is start by getting a good amount of fiber into your system.

				But seriously, I&#039;ve had multiple surgeries and my last shoulder surgery about a year ago (pre and post surgery) I was on percs for over a year and I&#039;d shit blood on occassion because it&#039;s really difficult to take a shit at times when on opiates.&nbsp; Especially, A LOT of opiates.&nbsp; You just need to get some stool softeners and don&#039;t strain.&nbsp; Don&#039;t force your shit out (sorry, that sounds horrible).&nbsp; You&#039;re probably fine but you need to just relax.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m really high right now but I hope this helps.&nbsp; Stool softener is your friend.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				To echo what some of the others have said:<br /><br />&nbsp;- More fibre in your diet (just change your breakfast to fruit and branflakes, eat more nice fresh bread from a bakery)<br /><br />Also, it is normal when you are in a job which requires a lot of sitting down, being stationary most of the day etc, in combination with significant amounts of stress to have this effect.

				Even if it is hemhroids, it depends on how deep in they are.&nbsp; You can injure your rectum all the way up large intestine (which is very rare)<br /><br />Basic hemhroids are nothing, but they do become more dangeous the deeper you are and may they&#039;ve provided an area of soft tissue very susceptible to infection.&nbsp; Not to mention that a doctor will be able to determine how far up and where the bleed is and be able to tell you then and now.&nbsp; If your fine go home, or if &#039;we need to run more tests&#039; (which SUCKS, but catching a disease especially if early enough make a huge difference in treating it then thats still better then dying :D<br /><br />I would again suggest a doctor, but had this been just a week ago I wouldh&#039;t have made anything of it pawning it off as a fluke bad diet flue.&nbsp; Now that it&#039; been an &#039;alarming&#039; time judging by your explanation though, I really think you should see a doc.

				<br /><br />I took a few Oxy&#039;s earlier this week as well and they did not effect me constipation wise very badly at all. I took about 20-25 mg&#039;s each time and woke up the next morning without any foggy symptoms, urinary or gi issues at all. Gave me quite a bit of gas which is to be expected, however I was able to use the bathroom fine and there were no signs of blood (actual or dried) when I had a bowel movement. Remember, I cannot stress hydration enough. Once I come down and get ready for bed I&#039;ll take two fiber pills and if I feel too bloated a stool softener to be on the safe side- of course this also depends on how many mg&#039;s of hydrocodone or oxy&#039;s that I take. <br /><br />If this is your first time taking Oxy you should be fine.<br />[/quote]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why Did you mention gas bein a given after doing oxy

				Sounds like it might just be roids. Opiate use can definitely result in that kind of thing, as I know from personal experience. They should heal up after a while.

I usually get a buildup of gas when I take them, nothing major but I do have the farts the next morning- I doubt this is exclusive to me as it&#039;s usually a pretty common symptom.

				SEE A DOCTOR, THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS!!!<br /><br />Two years ago I had the same problem, only it was blood on my bowel movements.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t a lot, just a streak or two.&nbsp; I was checked for hemorrhoids and they found nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I insisted on getting a colonscopy and after several visits to the doctor they finally consented.&nbsp; I had a precancerous polyp removed and haven&#039;t had a problem since.<br /><br />If it is hemorrhoids, then a simple digital rectal exam should do the trick.&nbsp;
