				I have always stayed away from molly and ecstasy because I have heard and read many negative things about it&#039;s possible long term effects. I know many people insist that it has no negative effects in the long term but I believe some studies have provided evidence to the contrary. Do you guys and gals believe MDMA is safe? and what do you use to back up that belief?<br />(I don&#039;t claim to know anything and am really just interested in what everyone else thinks.)<br />Peace.

Isn&#039;t that amazing?<br /><br />If you take it every day obviously you&#039;re going to deplete the serotonin in your brain and feel a bit low and maybe get a cold, but once every couple of weeks to a month and you&#039;re good to go.

				3 weeks between rolling minimum, most say a month or more.<br /><br />and also obviosly keep the dose under 250mg or so, maybe even 200mg if your on the lighter side or sensitive to stims<br /><br />i only do about 150mg, usually dose with 50 more a couple hours later

				i have taken MDMA four times in my life, in the space of about a year. I have only had positive impacts from it, primary ones being, a fucking good time everytime i take it obviously haha. But i always seem to get an after glow after the experience that lasts weeks on end where i feel good and &#039;nice&#039;, its also given me a more positive outlook and &#039;appreciation&#039; of life. Nothing drastic and not to noticeable but its defiantly given me something :) its hard to describe if i&#039;m honest! its a wonderful, magical drug if respected&nbsp; :P

				It&#039;s a hell of a lot safer than drinking alcohol, which is very hard on your body, especially your liver (and sometimes your relationships, too).&nbsp; But you wouldn&#039;t worry about having a few drinks every so often, would you?&nbsp; MDMA is something everyone should try.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not like heroin or meth -- you&#039;re not going to develop an addiction or anything crazy like that.

				in response to gambino I just want to say that I actually don&#039;t drink alcohol. thanks for all the other feedback, it sounds like overall mdma can be a valuable drugs but is not without risks when used incorrectly, nowhere near the safety of weed (but then again, what is?). I&#039;ve also heard of people taking 5-url supplements to compendlsate for seratonin deficiency. has anyone seen studies that prove the effectiveness of this?

				ingesting 1g trip of molly is probably the craziest shit i ever heard.<br /><br /><br />im happy you made it out alive and relatively unscathed.<br /><br />i suggest you hang your molly jersey up, that drug retired!<br /><br />i once trusted my friend to measure out a dose for me, thinking it would be the typical 120-160mg-sh realm<br /><br />days later it turned out he gave us 250mg, strangely enough, i was ok, (only rolled about 8 times in my life)<br /><br />i did have for the first time the eye wiggle, but i&nbsp; was alright. i wouldnt do that amount again, id stick to the typical range.<br /><br />it was pure molly too, im so fucking happy i didnt find out immediately after ingestion, as i would have freaked the fuck out

It doesn&#039;t kill any brain cells at all infact.<br /><br />The rumor about holes started because some dip-shit FDA scientists did a CAT scan on peoples brains before and immediately after taking MDMA, and tuned the CAT scanner to look for serotonin, which of course is depleted after an MDMA binge so it looked on the pictures like there were grey holes in the brain, but really these were just areas of the graph with low serotonin, which gets replenished within a few days if you eat well and sleep well.<br /><br />Using their &#039;Science&#039; you can make holes in your brain by having sex and see the dopamine depleted before and after sex, or eat lots of chocolate and see hormones do other things, it&#039;s all bullshit.<br /><br />The biggest risk with MDMA is drowning, people drink wayyyyy too much water because they think they are thirsty when they aren&#039;t. I&#039;ve seen people down 4 liters of water like it&#039;s manna from heaven, so it&#039;s good to be aware of that. Just pace your drinking, a good idea is to get a 500ml bottle and just stick to that all night. Also have some chewing gum because you tend to grind your teeth a little and don&#039;t realise.

				you dont have to worry about over dosing on it. the ld50 on it is really high. you would have to eat like 5g of mdma and not puke it up which would be very hard. i have taken 1.5g in a night (not proud of it) and had no negative symptoms. the worst that would happen is that you would have an overly intense experience

				If you are severely malnourished (like a lab monkey) and take a very large dose, you may risk brain damage.<br />As long as your brain&#039;s metabolism is sufficient to accomodate the increased activity induced by MDMA, and you avoid taking an excessive amount, it will not be neurotoxic. <br /><br />Don&#039;t drink excessive water, don&#039;t overheat, and you should be fine.

				A lot of people suggest 5-HTP for the comedown but that shit isn&#039;t good for your heart. Sure, some of it crosses your blood-brain barrier and gets converted into serotonin. Most of it, though, gets converted into serotonin by your liver which is very bad for your heart. If you want to increase your levels of serotonin (which in turn decreases any, albeit small, risk of neurotoxicity), take an l-Tryptophan supplement after rolling. l-Tryptophan is also a primary precursor to serotonin but it is only converted into serotonin after it has safely crossed the blood-brain barrier, not in the liver. <br /><br />Honestly, go roll your tits off.

Although we do not know yet whether these effects are reversible or not, we cannot exclude that ecstasy even in low doses is neurotoxic to the brain.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;No discovered long term effects of serotonin depletion and affecting regulation.<br /><br />Which is funny because I read another study a week ago showing that serotonin production wasn&#039;t normal up to 3 years after use. (Can&#039;t find the article sorry -_-)<br /><br />The more studies done the better but people need to take into account that a true scientific experiment has only 1 variable with all else being controls. Otherwise it becomes conjecture and pseudoscience. (I know a lot of studies that are getting funded have a goal that isn&#039;t possible to achieve only 1 variable and they are doing the best they can in the scientific community) I&#039;m just sick of poorly devised studies, poorly interpreted results, and an overall lack of scientific approach people give to new information.<br /><br />Knowledge is God people.<br /><br />With that, I&#039;m off to go roll my ass off ^_^

Sunlight literally creates serotonin in your brain. Sunbathing the next day after taking MDMA is perfection, trust me.<br /><br />Also for various reasons I can&#039;t be bothered to explain, just taking vitamins alone is pointless, you need the &quot;carriers&quot; to make that vitamin useful, which are usually found alongside the vitamin in the fruit or vegetable or meat it came from. For example you can eat 3 tonnes of Vitamin C, but if you don&#039;t have the corresponding carrier found in Oranges etc, then it won&#039;t be able to enter your white blood cells, be manipulated by your DNA and become useful for fighting bacteria.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m afraid I disagree with you.<br /><br />First of all, serotonin is not a &#039;happy chemical&#039;, or anything of the sort. In fact it is a molecule produced during stress, which further propagates the stress reaction through your body. It strongly suppresses oxidative metabolism and favors glycolysis, like cortisol and estrogen. Its physiological effects in animals include tropor and learned helplessness. In humans, high amounts (as in users of SSRI) can lead to suicide, due to constant inescapable stress. It also promotes neurotoxicity. <br />Most of what people think about serotonin is disinformation; Serotonin was discovered several years after LSD, (which at the time was thought of by those scientists who didn&#039;t take it as &#039;psychotomimetic&#039;) and when it was found that LSD was an extremely potent serotonin antagonist the logic was that increasing serotonin activity would have the opposite effect of LSD (and would make &#039;insane&#039; people &#039;sane&#039;). In reality, the beneficial effects of drugs like LSD and MDMA are caused in part by their antagonism of serotonin, and many people know that taking 5-HTP beforehand substantially dampens the effects of these, which is consistent with serotonin being an (the?) anti-psychedelic agent. <br /><br />Also, I agree that supplements may be ineffective and often harmful, due largely to self-serving disinformation propagated by the supplement industry (under the guise of &quot;these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA...&quot;) that compels people to eat things no human should be eating, like fish and flax oil, or aspartic acid. That said, there&#039;s no question that nutritional supplementation can prevent adverse effects from drug use; the 300+ 5/5 feedback on my products, about half of which is for the anti-neurotoxicity pill, suggests otherwise. <br /><br />And vitamin C doesn&#039;t need a cofactor to be used; Linus Pauling successfully used intravenous synthetic vitamin C to cure cancer, so clearly it&#039;s physiologically active.

The main risk in recreational use is simply overdoing it, dancing and jumping around for hours, which eventually can lead to dehydration, hyperthretmia and such. <br /><br />These side effects are serious and potentially fatal, so you need to have friend looking out for your well-being when taking them at parties. The direct effects of mdma are not likely to cause injury at all, but the effects caused by altered behavior very well can.

				From everything I&#039;ve read it seems like MDMA is relatively safe assuming the following criteria is met:<br /><br />-It&#039;s used in moderation. In other words, give it the proper respect it deserves. Personally, I&#039;d say no more than five times a year but I&#039;m sure some will vehemently disagree with me here.<br />-You have no underlying/untreated health conditions. (e.g. heart disease, high blood pressure, etc.)<br />-You keep yourself aware of how much liquid you&#039;ve consumed. In other words, be sure to stay hydrated but also keep track of how much liquid you&#039;re consuming -- too much water can lead to hyponatremia which can be fatal. I wouldn&#039;t worry about this too much though -- it&#039;s very rare and it&#039;s more important that you keep hydrated.<br />-You&#039;re certain the chemical you&#039;re consuming is in fact MDMA.<br />-You&#039;re aware of all the drug interactions with it.<br /><br />If you abide by the rules above you can pretty much be certain you&#039;ll be &quot;safer&quot; than most while consuming it. However, it should be noted that we still don&#039;t fully understand the long-term effects of MDMA so there definitely is a slight risk to consuming it. With that being said, I&#039;d be willing to bet MDMA is still far safer than driving your car to work everyday.

				Does anyone know if you take 5HTP supplement for a few days BEFORE you roll, but then STOP taking all 5htp after 24hrs before you roll, does it increase the effects of mdma? <br />what about pre-loading on L-Tyrosine? I heard it increases the available dopamine within the brain that mdma can use, increasing the stimulant, body buzz effect of mdma?

				I&#039;ve done it twice and never had any kind of hangover. I still wouldn&#039;t class it as &quot;healthy&quot; though. <br /><br />I once gave a dude some MDMA and he was loving it so much that he said he could see why it&#039;s illegal. I didn&#039;t say this but I remember thinking the exact opposite my first time, &quot;why is would something this good be illegal? everyone should try this!&quot;

				There is plenty of information out there, but the general consensus is that mdma (not ecstasy- which could be any number of things) is safe when taken in a controlled environment, with proper supervision. <br />There was one of our health officers out in BC who had an article in one of the papers recently: <br />http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/pure-ecstasy-can-be-safe-if-consumed-responsibly-bc-health-officer/article4258230/<br /><br />Now, they mean by a professional in a healthcare setting. But that&#039;s typically not how we do. <br /><br />There are risks, but they are well manageable for sensible people who are well informed with good intentions. <br /><br />Of all the things I&#039;ve ever done (not just drugs; actions, anything!) there is NOTHING that&#039;s been as beneficial to me. My life dramatically improved. But this may not happen to everyone. Please, just practice safe harm reduction if you go for it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and re. David McNutt: MDMA ranked 17 out of 20 drugs when compared in terms of their harms, below No.1-rated alcohol, and other drugs including heroin, cocaine, tobacco, pot and steroids, according to a U.K. analysis published in The Lancet in 2010. <br />From the same article.<br /><br />

				The pdf linked I read a cute 7 pages. It gave no data for me to critique. They state in the paper that MDMA has a lower physical harm score because it is relatively new and they must use lab tested studies for their data. I did not agree to the mean physical harm they gave cannabis because it does not correlate to the many studies contrary to their high numbers. Honestly, it isn&#039;t that far below alcohol. <br />I have a patient who suffers from severe chrons who works with his GI doctor treating his condition through only cannabis means. He was on chemo pills for years and the transition to cannabis has been documented in his case and many I&#039;ve worked with to be more beneficial to his health than the other pharmacy drugs. <br />The point; the high rating that bumped cannabis a bit higher than MDMA must be using limited or incorrect studies&nbsp; (If not I would love to review them) and their admittance to the limited data they had on the harm of ecstasy which newer journals have published studies that lead to more questions on the impact on serotonin levels in the brain and the possible receptor deficiencies.<br />No drug is harmless because in the nature of a drug it is affecting our CNS. They can be used in a beneficial way that overshadows the limited harm caused from responsible application, and for that reason I am pro drug. For escapism, self harm, or harm to others, I do not agree with its use.

				You seem to mistake my philosophical ideal for a narrow minded and&nbsp; judgmental view which isn&#039;t accurate. That is what your reaction portrayed however. <br />Also we obviously don&#039;t view escapism the same. Escapism is to distraction from reality, that doesn&#039;t mean doing something that alters reality to better yourself is escapism. Scoff at your own ideology because your downward view of mine is glaring ignorance.

				preload and postload with 5-HTP, magnesium and vit C and you&#039;ll be ok. Also, don&#039;t take any more frequently than 5 - 6 weeks to allow your serotonin levels to re-establish themselves.
