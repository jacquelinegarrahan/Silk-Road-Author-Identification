				So. I&#039;ve been thinking about cooking..obviously all the safety measures would be in place here, but any tips? Am I going to kill myself doing this?

				If you are new to this then shake&amp;bake is def bad idea. Start small with iodine and RP reagents. Learn about AB extractions, ph, polar and non polar solvents and other glasware.<br />You have some pretty good forums where is all process from pse extraction to reduction to meth explained very good.<br />Iodine and RP pure lab grade can be bought online, tip - on ebay are seller who sell iodine, rp can not be sold there but you can ask&nbsp; ;)<br />I am doing little 1g or 2g batches for personal use and its very potent shit and its fun.<br />Be careful. ;)

				Well, I have never done it, but I know people who have and they&#039;re dumb fuck hillbillies. That does not mean it is an easy thing to do, but I think as long as you have some sense, it can be accomplished without hurting yourself.<br /><br />However, the process is delicate, 1 mistake does not normally mean you can start over and try again. 1 mistake usually means horrific chemical burns &amp; hospitalization or death.<br /><br /><br />Shake &amp; Bake is fine, if you can do it I&#039;d love to see a (hopefully cheaper?) listing for some cheaper-quality meth, but please please don&#039;t hurt yourself!

				I&#039;ve never looked at the shake &#039;n&#039; bake method and the closest I&#039;ve ever gotten is a wake &#039;n&#039; bake. I also took those classes years ago and wouldn&#039;t want to steer you in the wrong direction re: synthesis.

Lithium amide is what reduces pseudoephedrine into methamphetamine.

				I&#039;ve shook a few bottles in my day.<br /><br />FIRST, Honestly not worth the money/risk/anything when you can get something for cheaper than your startup costs that might actually weigh fatter and be 95% pure ICE from here in 48 hrs. I promise if you ordered from Heisenburg, then ran to lowes, walmart, home depot, back to lowes, auto parts store, back to walmart, then fuck with the smurfs for the boxes or just buy your own. Then actually found a spot and cooked (IT CORRECTLY, I have seen it fucked up), then gas it. You&#039;d be drying out your chicken feed, while you were getting high off his ice. Then you wouldnt even get high off your stuff. ITS NIGHT AND DAY lol.<br /><br />Anyways, but say you did it for intrinsic value, keep the fiends away. Get somebody that you KNOW has shaken some bottles before and have him on hand.<br /><br />The trickiest thing is stripping the batteries. I could never get them with pliers unscathed, do yourself a favor and buy a copper tube cutter 10$ at lowes. AMAZING. Its a little blue vice grip with a blade on it. Get a guy there to show you how to use it. Buy extra batteries incase you accidently set one hot. They dont work well if you dont get them pristine. <br /><br />This is a janky ass COOK. About as RAG TAG as it gets boy. I think everybody should cook some once in thier life. I can get much more in detail, but I gotta eat pizza.

In fact I remember using those tube cutters when I helped my uncle install the water softener. <br /><br />@PriscillaMarie90 yes you are right on the money. That&#039;s what I need, some liquid ammonia! I don&#039;t even know what ammonia smells like. Probably smells like poop. idk. <br /><br />@mseller so.. let&#039;s go behind this alley and talk in whispers. You know, have a beer...&nbsp; talk about relationships, *cough* making ice *cough* and mortgage rates etc. <br /><br /><br /><br />back on track - couldn&#039;t you just purify the shake n bake jank until it turns into ice? Like a steam distill or someshit? I mean if astronauts can turn their own pee into drinking water in space, I&#039;m sure there are ways to make shake n bake ultra pure right? <br /><br />And yes,&nbsp; I am an astronaut. <br /><br />

				Purifying the result of a one bottle meth product seems silly to me. Might as well take the time to get as high a yield as possible in the first place.

				These are some notes from the guys I talked to, like I said, GARBAGE. Buy ice. Period.<br /><br /><br />If you want the king daddy of advice? Don&#039;t fucking ever cook it, not worth it, very dangerous, the risk of prison time almost makes me puke thinking about it, and the quality is the Schwagg w/ no seeds that the asshole at the party is selling as &quot;Mids&quot; or god forbid &quot;Baby DRO&quot; HAHA ya someones heard that one before. The guys I breifly met where never relaxed, checked the blinds on the minute and were always pressin that GO button. They could eat a family dinner and sleep after smoking a cpl 2 gs on foil, that would have me jogging around the neighborhood or something stupid like a 80 page reply on a message board. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have the attachment that others do, if you cant control yourself, dont cook. And if you must, dont shit where you eat. Sketchiest people ever, wierd, like the kind that will cut your ass for 15$. They cycle around, getting popped as they spend&nbsp; days collecting boxes, just to collect more boxes, ratting on each other and going in and out in and out. Luckily, this guy was just an older cat, that I met through a mutual friend, so I got a rare glimpse of a strange world w/o getting my shoes dirty. One of the few, honest men that was on that GOFAST. Almost an oxymoron. <br /><br /><br />
