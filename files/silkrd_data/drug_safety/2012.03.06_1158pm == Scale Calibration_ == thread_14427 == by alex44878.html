				Hi all,<br /><br />Just for personal use I&#039;ve purchased a scale (aws-100) with 1mg increments.<br /><br />http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81WWVu3CovL._AA1500_.jpg<br /><br />I have no idea if it&#039;s properly calibrated. Is there an easy way to check? Or common object that is consistent in weight I could verify against?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Alex

				That&#039;s not a 1mg scale, it&#039;s a 10mg scale which means you&#039;ll only be able to accurately weigh things in 100mg increments. If the scale didn&#039;t come with a reference weight you can use a coin or something.

				The scale should have instructions on how to calibrate it.&nbsp; It usually needs a certain amount of weight.&nbsp; If it didn&#039;t come with one, you&#039;ll have to buy one.

				If you&#039;re looking for a mg scale on the cheap, I use one of these:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331078796&amp;sr=8-1<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty nice so far. Probably more accurately weighs within 1~2mg of what you&#039;re shooting for, but for most substances that&#039;s perfectly fine. Comes with 2 calibration weights as well!<br /><br />S

				If I dont have calibration weights I use nickels, they are 5g each, I have a Gemini Pro I absolutely love, comes with proper calibration weights and a couple different weigh boats:<br />http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-GPR-20-Gemini-PRO-Milligram/dp/B003STEJD4/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331079342&amp;sr=1-2<br /><br />My second AWS scale, I&#039;ve had my first one since like 2006, it was a .1g increment scale, the screen is a little messed up, its been through hell a few times and borrowed to several different local dealers for months of frequent non stop use but its still truckin, I calibrate it once every year or 2 when I get bored but its never really lost calibration on its own, AWS is quality in my book so you made a good purchase, if I remember right both scales came uncalibrated (or at least not accurately) so you will need to use a few nickels, usually it will ask for 10g and 20g for calibration but the book you get will explain what you need to do

				Thanks everyone! That might not be the exact photo of the one I got, mine measures mg. But it&#039;s the same manufacturer. Cost about $30 bucks (should have purchased from Amazon, I got it locally).<br /><br />I&#039;ll try the nickel technique to double check.<br /><br />Thanks!

If you get the one that costs around $55, it is accurate starting at about 7mg to the same accuracy (I have both). Not sure if you&#039;re weighing stuff that small, but I always prefer higher accuracy. =]

				I just got my scale today.&nbsp; It measures in Hundredth of a Gram and is 100 gram Max Capacity.&nbsp; It was supposed to come with a 100 Gram weight to calibrate it but it didn&#039;t so I&#039;m going to have to go to the bank and get 20 Nickles to accurately calibrate this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Got it from Amazon.&nbsp; AWS-100 Digital Scale.&nbsp;

				Scale question.<br /><br />I think my scale is off.&nbsp; I just calibrated it and weighed a few pills.&nbsp; 2 that are 2mg pills and both come up as less than 2mg.&nbsp; Then I weighed a 20mg pill and that comes up less as well.&nbsp; The scaled I bought had great buyer ratings but maybe I got a bad scale that can&#039;t keep calibrated?&nbsp; Or, I&#039;m not doing something right but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case?
