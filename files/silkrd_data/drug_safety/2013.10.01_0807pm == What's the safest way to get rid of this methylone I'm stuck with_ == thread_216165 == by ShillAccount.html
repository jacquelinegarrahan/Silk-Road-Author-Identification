				Besides throwing it out. Should I be selling 150mg caps of methylone to unsuspecting strangers in a club or should I make caps that are mixed both with pure MDMA + methylone? What are the dangers of giving someone methylone who has already ingested MDMA? I refuse to put people in danger but if I need to get rid of this shit as my funds are low at the moment.

				Just do the right thing and tell the people you are selling it to.&nbsp; Methylone (bk-MDMA) is safer than MDMA and less neurotoxic than MDMA.&nbsp; Mixing them is fine but tell the people you sell it to.&nbsp; Some people even like bk-MDMA more than MDMA.&nbsp; Dosage of bk-MDMA is about double the amount of pure MDMA that you would normally take and the roll isn&#039;t as long as on MDMA.&nbsp; People like to redose bk-MDMA.
