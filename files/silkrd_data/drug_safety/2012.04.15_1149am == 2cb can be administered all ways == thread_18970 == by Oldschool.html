				Just for those interested the walls are breathing and the music is a kaleidoscope....<br /><br />2cb can be used effectively.<br />1)rub on gums -effects are nearly as fast as snorting, with a second come on 45 minutes later from what you swallow<br />2)up the bum - no personal experience but i am told the best way.<br />3)vaporize - off tin foil, try a tiny to the naked eye bit first, use a candle to keep the heat down.<br />4)eat - the best come up like ecstasy<br />5)snort - the pain... but shit look at that!<br />6)inject - i watched a trooped ignore my advice and then have an 8 hour trip of 25mg&#039;s<br /><br />And don&#039;t be ashamed that you found that orchid painting erotic like porn :)&nbsp; &nbsp;-Peace!!!!

				I can tell you first hand, bumping is by far the best way. The effects are way better. Everyone should try it. 15MGs is an amazing trip, Sex on 2C-B is electric.

				I&#039;ve tried oral (slow), snorting (hurt like hell for 20 minutes but fast), and the booty bump (fastest and smaller doses are better so your stash lasts longer). I haven&#039;t tried the gums, I&#039;ll try that next.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />&nbsp;

				It dissolves in water. It may take some stirring but it will disolve. 12 to 15MGs is a good dose for bumping. It feels really awesome, negative side effects are non-existant, and when you come down you are right back at baseline without any residual effects.<br />I have never had a bad time bumping 2C-B. In my opinion, this is the only way to do it.

				&nbsp;:-\<br />I am Sorry to say that my first experience yesterday with 2C-B up the pooper was quite disappointing. <br />i could not reagent test it but the seller seemed to have a good reputation. i dont want to imagine being ripped off but waiting the whole evening something to change made me think towards that...<br /><br />Beforehand I prepared a cosy setup, had a minerals drink and a bite. I weighted 14mg with my scales, solved in 1ml water, used a syringe (62kgs me) and my bottom swallowed it eagerly, though I just felt a bit leaky for a while. after an hour or so i got some goosebumps but it was not the come up as i first though, probably just the excitement about the first experience. <br />incidentially i had at least some good sex at +2h (feeling sober) but after +4 hours i could not tell if i had any influence from that chemical, perhaps a short diarrhea and a slightly raised heartbeat, and went to bed after watching TV a bit, could sleep as always, and getting up was as usual... <br /><br />Now my questions to you professionals, wowzers and sickboy et al: <br />can anybody tell me how a slight underdosage feels like? should i take 20mg next time, or even 25 to compensate my possible high tolerance to alc and weed, if there is there any cross tolerance? Better taken orally on my next try?<br />Is it possible that one really feels nothing on such a dose? How could I test it if I have no marquis reagent?<br />I feel like a virgin somehow... ;)

				Did you take a big dump before you administered up the bum? cos if you don&#039;t the liquid gets absorbed by your dung and leeches out very slowly, and not providing any rush.

				Hey tittytwister, I&#039;ve PM&#039;d you regarding the other part of your question but regarding the effects:<br /><br />Was this your first 2C-B experience? Why did you decide to take it rectally? Next time I&#039;d recommend 18mg orally.<br />Underdosage does feel exactly as you described, I know how disappointing it is. Mis-fires on psychedelics tend to make me feel slightly goosebumpy &amp; I get chills &amp; feel like I&#039;ve had a strong cup of coffee. Then they disappear and that&#039;s the end of the &#039;trip&#039;.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I have found 2C-B to be a finicky drug. Sometimes 16mg will barely shift me off baseline, whereas other times I&#039;ll get a full high powered trip. Sometimes I start tripping fully within 35 minutes but once it took 2 hours to come up. My trips &amp; setting are pretty controlled (late evening trip, light meal 5 hours before, usually with the same people in similar setting, maximum of 3-4 beers over the course of the evening) but I still find 2C-B to be very variable. <br /><br />Good luck with your next experiment, please let us know if it was more successful&nbsp; :D<br /><br />***edit- The vendor who you bought your 2C-B from supplies the hydrobromide salt which is about 14% less potent than the hydrochloride. I certainly wouldn&#039;t recommend jumping from 14mg to 20/25. The dose-response curve for 2C-B is very non-linear. Try 18mg orally, then increase it incrementally by 2mg each time. <br />

				People often find they build acute tolerance to psychedelics, it&#039;s not surprising that you&#039;re not feeling much if you&#039;re redosing within 24 hours.<br /><br />I gave a few dozen 10mg 2C-B blotters to some friends a fortnight ago. One of them took 15mg and had a low level trip. The next day it took him nearly 50mg to have only a slightly more intense experience :o&nbsp; <br /><br />I know this will sound frustrating but I&#039;d advise you to wait a week before your next experiment, I promise it will be worth it&nbsp; :D
