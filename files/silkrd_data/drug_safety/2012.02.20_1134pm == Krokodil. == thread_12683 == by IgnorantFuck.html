				ill be opening up a vendor account next week and selling some amazing homebake krok, guaranteed to rot your arm of in a week!&nbsp; but seriously why on earth would anyone ever want to use such a toxic drug when we have real opiates available.&nbsp; im pretty sure they only use it out of sheer desperation, either poverty or lack of real opiates.&nbsp; &nbsp;those russians are just some hardcore mofos!

No wonder it is so bad.<br /><br />But seriously, synthetic opiates are just bad news bears. Synthetic Opiates is literally what caused the analog law to be created.&nbsp;

Heck they have been selling ethylqualone and methylmethqualone&nbsp; (though not in too large amounts). Maybe China has a law against morphine analogs or something or considers Desomorphine to be illegal.

				I think people are doing red phosphorus/iodine reduction on (probably poorly) extracted OTC codeine tablets. The side effects (rotting flesh) look like phosphorus poisoning but there is going to be a load of other unwanted shit in there too.
