				Title: <strong>25i - lackluster trip?</strong><br />

				I&#039;m relatively new to 25i nbome, my only previous experience before this past weekend was 1 1mg tab which I thought was a little bunk since it wasn&#039;t even as intense of a trip as 3.5g of shrooms.<br /><br />My first question is I&#039;m planning on taking DMT this weekend, will me having taken 25i last weekend dull its effectiveness at all?<br /><br />My next question is about my trip this past weekend. So this past weekend I took some of kwiktrips 25i tabs, I took 3 (550ug each) expecting to see actual hallucinations rather than distorted visuals that I&#039;ve seen with shrooms and lsd. An hour into my trip I took a 4th tab.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read so many trip reports about people seeing amazing visuals on this 25i nbome but my trip was pretty much like a heavy lsd trip. I also ready it was like lsd without the mindfuck, but I had major mindfuck with it, more than I ever had with lsd.<br /><br />Just to test it&#039;s effectiveness I was looking at the same picture, same music, same setting as I did shrooms 2 weeks prior. Where the picture with shrooms I would sort of delve into the pictures, it would split into fractals and those into more etc. With 25i there was none of that, it was more wavyness, the clouds spiraling in circles and colors fading in and out. I tried different settings, going upstairs, outside, etc but I couldn&#039;t produce any hallucinations. I tried smoking a couple bowls, damn near broke my bong twice, and it intensified the mindfuck for a short time but didn&#039;t intensify the visuals at all.<br /><br />Seemed to me it was identical to lsd, even down to the chills I get with lsd, but the visuals were macro whereas shrooms are micro, but none of them have ever produced a full fledged hallucination for me, by which I mean instead of distorting the visuals of something that exists I see something or someone that completely does not exist.<br /><br />I have more of kwiktrips tabs, I&#039;m sort of hesitant to try more than 4 tabs though.

				500mg of 25i feels like an equivalent of 2.5g of shrooms and 100ug of LSD to me. I haven&#039;t seen actual hallucinations (like an elf sitting in the corner of my room) with any drug yet to be honest. The closest I&#039;ve gotten is MXE where my closed eye-visuals felt realistic enough to be real.&nbsp; I usually get extremely satisfying distortions on 25i though. On one my first few trips, I was laying down in my dark bedroom and my door was open so this small sliver of light was creeping into my room. About two hours into the trip, I realized that the light was literally shifting into this amazing orange to purple hue. I have a cabinet with a glass door and it reflected the same light onto my ceiling and nearby walls. My room was lighting up and dancing between colors wildly. It looked like the aurora borealis because the light soon started shifting brightness too. I wouldn&#039;t call it an actual hallucination but I was damn impressed and spent 4-5 hours just staring at this and shocked. Usually on LSD and shrooms, I&#039;ll just get a pattern overlay of &quot;waves&quot;, but nothing that had perfect bleeding of objects and light. Ha, if I read about my experience, I would have thought it was exaggerated. I guess you have to have seen it for yourself to really believe it.

				Sounds about the same for me. Shrooms feels like when I focus on something my eyes slowly unfocus, making the object break into fractals, so it&#039;s like I&#039;m delving INTO the object. On LSD and 25i I have more of macro visuals, involving more color and movement. I get the &#039;melting&#039; visual on all of them, on shrooms it&#039;s usually short lived and infrequent, on 25i I had things melting more often but not for long, and on lsd the melting lasted much longer, or at least felt like it did.<br /><br />I&#039;m not disappointed by 25i at all, in fact I believe it&#039;s my new favorite considering for the visuals versus the price. I was just more disappointed since I went into it expecting to see full fledged hallucinations of something that clearly was not even there, like so many people claim to have seen, but for me it&#039;s all been distortion of reality - other than DMT, which creates an altogether different reality.

I&#039;d say 25i is quite comparable for me and on this trip I took 4 25i tabs, 550ug each, and had visuals as intense as any lsd trip.<br /><br />I&#039;m beginning to think those who actually see a full fledged hallucination of something that isn&#039;t there are full of shit. Sort of like ghosts, a thousand people can tell me about it all day long but until I actually see it I don&#039;t believe it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not talking about split second hallucinations, I get those, but people talk about seeing things walking through their room, things talking to them, shit like that. I only see reality twist, distort and such, and the occasional split second hallucinations - nothing substantial.
