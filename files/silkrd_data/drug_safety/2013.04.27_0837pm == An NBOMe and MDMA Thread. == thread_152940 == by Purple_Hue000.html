				I have a few questions I&#039;m looking to clear up about NBOMe&#039;s and MDMA. Is there any kind of cross tolerance with the two?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d like to test out a blotter hit (1mg) of my 25b before taking some at a concert next month, but I wouldn&#039;t want the NBOMe to ruin my roll either. <br /><br />Also do the two go well together? I&#039;m thinking of RC candyflipping with 25B and MDMA. <br />I&#039;d just like to hear your concerns and what not on NBOMe&#039;s and MDMA.

				Wow, that&#039;s strange. I came here with the intention of asking about this combination and I find your thread at the top. <br /><br />I&#039;m also planning on doing the same. although at much larger doses. I&#039;m planning&nbsp; to ingest about 7mg of NBOMe followed up with 200mg of MDMA with a possible 100/200mg booster halfway in; and I will end the night with a small line of heroin. I wanted to know if this is dangerous in anway (I read that NBOMe can cause some vasoconstrictionat at high doses) <br /><br />Any information would be much appreciated in the spirit of harm reduction!<br /><br />

It also suggests low light/sound levels would help too. You might want to look into blood thinners as well to attack the problem from the other angle but don&#039;t take me for scientific on that.

				I took 1mg of complexed 25i buccally. And that was pretty good. Comparable to a hit or 2 of cid. But I wouldn&#039;t want to do much more as the pins and needles/tight muscles were a tad annoying.<br /><br />I would say make sure you have a good amount of magnesium (and potassium) in you no matter what. This will help with the vasoconstriction a bit - but also note that the general consensus is doubling a dose of nbome won&#039;t double the effects but can potentially produces effects far greater than &#039;double&#039;. I also smoke weed throughout the trip as this seems to help the visuals and help with the come-up.<br /><br />Some people claim a cross-tolerance effect with MDMA. Whereby nbomes dull the MD effect. I noticed this somewhat but I&#039;m not sure if this was just a little psychological tolerance to MDMA itself. But after 10 days clean I did not think there was any tolerance to the nbome or MDMA.

				Since we vend both MDMA and nBOME heres our input.<br /><br />From personal experience, can i not advise taking more than 4mg. My hardest hit was 3mg combined with 200mg MDMA which turned into a pretty hardcore trip with a duration of 15hours.<br /><br /><br />MDMA and nBOME work great together. IF you take both, will you get a pretty nice trip, as long as you dont overdose. Like already written over us, people had significant drawbacks from even 500ug nBOME.... It always depends on your personal tolerance of course, but i would start with 1500ug-2000ug maximum and 140mg MDMA.<br /><br />This will be the best start to see how it goes. If it doesnt turn out good, increase the intake, but dont go with 7mg&nbsp; :o AND MDMA.&nbsp; Shit i would even take 7mg alone lol<br /><br /><br />But like said, both works together like a charm

				Not as many people have tried the 25B as 25C and 25I, much less with MDMA.<br /><br />Some people absolutely hate NBOMes.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t already tried 25B then I would recommend against using it at a concert because that would suck if it ruined your experience.&nbsp; Just my opinion based on my severe dislike of 25C.

				Redosing nBOME is possible. The effects become stronger, but you are not really aware of it since you are already tripping. It also extends the time you are tripping.<br /><br />And yes i feel a body load everytime. Thats why i use it really selective right now. My body is shaking, breathing becomes harder or at least do i feel a bit claustrophobic. But beside the muscle clenching and teeth clenching am i good. No throwing up or so.<br /><br />
