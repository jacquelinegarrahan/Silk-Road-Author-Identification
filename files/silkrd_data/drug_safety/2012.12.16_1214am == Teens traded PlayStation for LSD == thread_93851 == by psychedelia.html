				&nbsp;Two Washington County teenagers who traded a video gaming console for six “hits” of LSD on Wednesday required treatment in local hospitals after taking the drugs.<br /><br />State police at Washington released few details about the 14-year-old Fallowfield boys in an incident report that said the pair had a bad trip and were treated in Mon Valley Hospital in Carroll, and one had to be transferred to Children‘s Hospital of Pittsburgh for further treatment and observation.<br /><br />Trooper David Hamer said the teenagers traded a PlayStation gaming system for the LSD, which they consumed later in the day. A hit of the drug usually sells for $5 to $15 on the street.<br /><br />Dr. Michael Lynch, medical director of the Pittsburgh Poison Center, said ingestion of LSD, a hallucinogen commonly called “acid,” is normally not as dangerous as heroin or prescription pain medications such as Oxycontin. He noted that LSD is not poisonous.<br /><br />Unlike heroin and other opiates and pain medications, there is no effect on the lungs or heart. Deaths occur with heroin and Oxycontin when a user “physically stops breathing,” he said.<br /><br />LSD users feel an immense sense of euphoria or schizophrenia (lol?), according to Lynch and Westmoreland County veteran Detective Tony Marcocci.<br /><br />Small pieces of absorbent paper are placed in the mouth, under the tongue or against a cheek, and the LSD is absorbed through the skin.<br /><br />A high usually lasts four to eight hours, Lynch said.<br /><br />A person using LSD could experience an “outside body experience,” alteration of their senses and how they perceive the world around them, Lynch and Marcocci said.<br /><br />“It‘s both visual and more sensitive to the touch. People touch a lot of things … furry types of things, and everything supposedly feels interesting,” Lynch said.<br /><br />“They also describe a sort of reversal of senses where they‘re seeing music or hearing colors. But again, different people describe the high differently,” he added.<br /><br />Marcocci said that with higher doses everything around the user could appear to melt, move or change.<br /><br />“Your thoughts become bizarre and often confused. Most of our young users who seek treatment often end up in the psych ward for being schizo,” he said.<br /><br />Read more: http://triblive.com/news/westmoreland/3130446-74/lsd-lynch-traded#ixzz2FAXVB1LG

				Shit, the dealer made off like a bandit. Six hits of acid for a playstation? Fuck yeah. The kids probably just had a bad trip because they realized they no longer had a ps3.
