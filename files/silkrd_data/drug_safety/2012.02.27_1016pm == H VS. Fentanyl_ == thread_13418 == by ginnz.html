				Hey guys, a couple questions.... In your opinion(s) how does good H compare to fentanyl?&nbsp; Lets say i have a decent tolerance to Fentanyl (can use a 100 mcg patch subliminally to get a decent buzz). How much good H (approximately) would it take to get a decent buzz going? Im NOT into I.V, although i&#039;ve done it years ago! I&#039;m looking more into snorting it, and possibly smoking some of it.<br /><br />also, lets say, im trying to slowly wean down of the Fentanyl, and IF i dont use any for 14-16 hours, im starting to feel a little shitty, would a small bump of the H take that shitty feeling away? Im kinda wondering how long i can stretch a gram of H, just using it to keep the dope sick feeling away (from not using any Fent. at all).<br /><br />any input is appreciated!<br /><br />ginnz

				Id say that good H is always better than Fent for a few reasons. Usually you get fent in a paperish patch or if you&#039;re lucky you can still find the gel patches. The gel ones you can smoke which is pretty good but if you got a regular patch, you have to suck on it to get faster onset than the usual stick on and wait routine. <br /><br />With H on the other hand, you can IV, smoke, snort and the come up is QUICK. I love that rush. Fent is stronger but it seems to work less on the &quot;feel good&quot; opiate receptors and more on the &quot;kill pain&quot; receptors. H is more euphoria imho. <br /><br />As for cross tolerance, fent is notorious for raising peoples tolarances super fast. You can look up what the conversions are for fent to H and then pretty much assume ~70% cross tolerance. The gram would make you feel better once you&#039;re in withdrawal but as for how long it ill last, that all depends on quality and Route of Administration. For example, smoking lasts quicker than snorting if I recall correctly. <br /><br />Good Luck and Enjoy<br /><br />
