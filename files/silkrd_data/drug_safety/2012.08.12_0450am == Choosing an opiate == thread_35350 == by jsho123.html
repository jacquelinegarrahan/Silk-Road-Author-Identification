				I want to have some fun with opiates. That said I&#039;m not sure what to go with. What gives the most bang for the buck? Heroin? Oxycontin? I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s not vicodin because that shit is really expensive. <br /><br />I&#039;m torn between heroin and crushable morphine. Although, I&#039;m not sure at all how they compare in terms of price and effect.<br /><br />Any advice would be amazing.<br />Thanks.

				H will give you the most bang for your buck, but you seriously want to treat it with respect, and not just from a DARE perspective. I mean if you take too much in one go you&#039;re going to collapse, puke, and maybe choke on your own vomit. If you are opiate naive (which it sounds like) the first time using H is almost always going to make you spew. Do not take it alone to begin with. This ain&#039;t like smoking a joint and getting fuzzy for a few hours. Use minute amounts. You can always take more until you get where you want to be, but too much will mess you up and waste your drugs. So tiny little piles many times is the way to do it. <br /><br />Also, the reason why H is cheap is because what your buying isn&#039;t produced medicinally. Vicodin and Oxy and all those things are hellaexpensive because they had to be stolen or bought off people with scripts, or counterfitted, whereas H just has to be made by some random dude in central asia with a big tub, a spoon and a bottle of acetic anhydride. <br /><br />Personally I&#039;d say that if your looking for fun, then H is not the place to start. Its where you end up when the other things aren&#039;t doing what you want anymore. Morphine will get you really very high, as will Hydrocodone, and with a lot less risk. Remember, every opiate just turns into morphine in your body, you are always getting high off morphine, it just depends how much of it is turned into morphine. Using H has new and alarming dangers compared to just about anything else that there is to use. <br /><br />Treat it with respect. It&#039;s inhumanly addictive, and tolerance builds like lightning. Be very careful.

				Just curious, and to get an idea of how expensive (or affordable) good quality H is:<br /><br />What kind of doses a regular heroin user takes - either by snorting, chasing or injecting - depending on how opiate-tolerate he is of course? How long a 1g will last if the user is, say, chipping weekly and is not a full-blown addict?

You will loose some at first, but soon will get the &quot;&quot;hang&quot;&quot; from it and will be able to smoke without loosing any smoke. But that can take a while before you will be skilled enough.<br />Even if some goes besides the straw, the majority of the dose will be inhaled.<br /><br />It is better not to place such questions in someone else his/her topic.<br />Just make a fresh topic yourself.<br /><br />Wasta

I&#039;d rather pay more and get a controlled and quality high. I&#039;ve had a small amount of experience with it, but I wasn&#039;t measuring the dosages. I&#039;m not too worried about od&#039;ing, I&#039;ll just take it really slow. Next time I&#039;ll go with crushable oxy. I&#039;ve done a couple lines of it and it was amazing. I&#039;m guessing H has a lot of impurities and toxic bullshit as well. When it comes to smoking it, could I use a crack pipe type of apparatus? Vaporize it. Or should I go the tin foil/straw route?<br /><br />Thanks.

				H is certainly the most bang for your buck. I&#039;ve had some great times with various dosages of vicodin, but in my personal opinion Oxys are the most enjoyable. The only way i can describe it is pure bliss. It truly feels like an intense orgasm that lasts for hours.<br /><br />Im sure you&#039;re quite aware of the many consequences that come with using opiates. Im not going to preach to you, but be aware of what you are potentially getting yourself into.<br /><br /><br />Be safe<br /><br />Shifty

				im new to H, but i have been taking oxys and various other semi synths over the last fe years because of pain. I use No.4 from Frank matthews or Afghan Apocoracy. I sniff no more than 0.05 at a time, waiting 30 mins between bumps. Generally .1 to .15 is enough for me to be rather nice.<br />For you being new to it aswell, i would suggest smoking No.3 off foil. For the reasons stated above, its alot safer than sniffing or banging it up your arse lolo. <br />Start with a 0.1, put it on the foil. Hold the foil at a slight downward angle and heat from underneath with a lighter until its starts to run, sucking in the fumes with a straw or something similar. Do not burn it, just try to heat it enough for it to run and give off a slight vapour. <br />After you have smoked the 0.1, wait a minimum of 30 mins before smoking anymore. I hope this helps.<br /><br />Stay safe<br /><br />Skunky.

				bollox, sorry, its a typo, its ment to say start with 0.05. smoking no more than 0.1 - 0.15 in total. It must be weighed and you must wait 30 mins after smoking your 0.05 before smoking anymore. I really am sorry for the typo (i been at it this morning tut tut lol)<br />Only reason i said to smoke rather than sniff is because that is what i was told to do by a vetran H user i know. I suppose he suggested it because No.3 is cheaper than No.4, so if your gonna dabble with something, the cheaper option is better just in case you dont like it.<br /><br />At the end of the day whats most important is that its treated with respect, enjoy your self and stay safe.<br /><br />take care, <br />Skunky.
