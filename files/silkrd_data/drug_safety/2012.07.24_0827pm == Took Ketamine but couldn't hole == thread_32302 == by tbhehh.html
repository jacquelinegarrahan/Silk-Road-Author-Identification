				I had about 500mg of Ivorys K last night, seperated into 6 lines and snorted over the space of 2 hours. I had a really strange yet quite pleasing experience but did not enter the K hole, as I wanted too.<br /><br />Could anyone explain what I did wrong?

				Did you use MXE in the last 2 weeks? <br /><br />I noticed a huge cross tolerance between the 2, I need at least 2 weeks between a MXE session and a K session to really feel it again..

				First time with K and haven&#039;t used MXE before. I&#039;m a pretty average weight. The only thing I can think of is that I was very tired but not sure if that would have stopped me from entering the hole..

				Sometimes it is all about relaxation and setting. It&#039;s very easy to snap oneself out of a hole because it feels weird or a change in music or someone saying something. Fat lines and sticking on a good documentary can help sometimes (just to take your mind off the drug)

				But K lasts very short, so if you spread it out over couple hours you won&#039;t hole possibly. Try a large dose at once, then you will hole.
