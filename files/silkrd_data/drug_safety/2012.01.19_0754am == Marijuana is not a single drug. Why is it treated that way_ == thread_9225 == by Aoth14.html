				One thing I&#039;ve noticed and found odd about such a popular plant, is that up until recently, all cannabis was treated as the same exact drug. We know of course it is not,but one thing I have had trouble keeping up with is a partially well defined list of characteristics of certain plants. <br /><br />Of course Sativas and Indicas are commonly separated, but the effects are generalized,and I can&#039;t tell them apart off the plant,until ingested. Now, thanks to Weed Wars, differences are attributed solely to estimated THC and CBD counts, and an importance has been placed on goofy seed names rather than physical properties of the finished consumable product. Scientists have proven that those attributions are overall inaccurate, and only effective as a generalization that only exists to promote the medical value of cannabis.&nbsp; Anyone who thinks these generalizations are accurate simply doesnt realize what happens to cannabinoids as they are ingested by differing methods, as they convert into different cannabinoids, some of which already exist in the plant, and some of which already exist in the body,and many that do no exist in either. Obviously the effects are different between smoking, vaporizing, and ingesting in an oil.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to come up with a database of info, everything from appearance, smell and formation characteristics that can indicate the effects of different strain groups, and also a list of side effects from different types of strains. I&#039;m looking to know what causes certain aromas, formation characteristics,etc, in an attempt to help users predict the affects of a bud they have in their hands,without having to trust the dealer, compare pictures, and rely on childish online reviews of the strain they think they have.<br /><br />Does anybody have any sound evidence as to what makes certain strains smell like they do?&nbsp; (Isnt it odd that all the &#039;forbidden smells&#039; as a child that actually smell good are some of the different smells of weed? (petrol fuel, skunks, burning plastic, angelic excrements,etc lol)<br /><br />What about looks and other physical properties? I know the stickiest weed I&#039;ve had was far from the best. I&#039;ve always had good luck with frosty looking weed but the best I&#039;ve had was always zero frost.But I&#039;ve had 70% Sativas, and 70% Indicas that shared similar characteristics. What is the frostiness? White trichomes? What is the stickyness? Resin?&nbsp; What about buds that sparkle inside? Some buds have a spongey texture inside, and solid colored, others are leafy and multi colored. What group of cannabinoids are indicated by the prescence of these different features? <br /><br />Can anyone list side effects for Indicas, and Sativas, other than that Sativas are uplifting and giggley, and Indicas are sedative and pain killing?<br /><br />Sorry for such a strange topic, I know most people just wanna &#039;get high&#039; but I&#039;m particular in my needs and wants.It always sucked wondering if a local strain was going to keep me in bed or not. If I couldve distinguish effects by physical properties/smell, I couldve rejected Indica dominant strains due to the multiple negative side effects I personally find in heavy Indica intake. Maybe not an issue for most, but you rarely get a strain name where I am, and what better subject to learn about than something we all love?<br /><br />

				Check out leafly.com, it contains a bit more details about the types of high and what you will feel for loads of different strains.<br /><br />It is an interesting topic, and probably a not very well understood one at all. I&#039;ll be very interested to hear a bit more about other factors that effect the high.

				i can&#039;t really add too much personally but this link:&nbsp; (it&#039;s clear web so be careful)<br />http://www.420magazine.com/forums/cannabis-facts-information/81279-understanding-your-high-effects-marijuana-consciousness.html<br /><br />i don&#039;t really know how scientifically backed this essay is but it is by far the most extensive and in depth i have ever read about the subtle effects of cannabis.&nbsp; it truly breaks the high down in a way that makes you go &quot;aha!&nbsp; so that&#039;s what that was&quot; and &quot;i know exactly what that&#039;s like!&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />i personally think there is a very dynamic interaction between thc and cnb, with a whole spectrum of differing effects.&nbsp; in addition, since smoking bubble hash, i&#039;ve noticed that even tricome size changes the high (the larger micron stuff has a totally different high from the smaller, and this is the same strain (mostly sativa).<br />so there is something going on in each tricome.&nbsp; maybe it&#039;s a totality of effects?<br /><br />that is why cannabis is so beautiful.&nbsp; it&#039;s so many things in one.&nbsp; if it could truly be studied and catalogued for medicine i&#039;m sure hundreds of medicines could be produced from various strains.&nbsp; <br /><br />*destiny*

In a few instances they can be used for pain and nausea but in my experience medical users have told me whilst it does the job for SOME peole the racy side effect is really not needed...some rare strains even have psychoactive properties..but other then that sativas should be used for &quot;daytime smokes&quot; for med users.<br /><br />The buds from a sativa plant are normally fluggy and thin with excellent taste and sweet or fruity smells, they don&#039;t tend to pack on as much weight in growing as indicas do so they tend to be harder to buy on the street or their more expensive (just look at the prices for amnesia haze nowadays!)<br /><br />Indica strains are sedatives as you say and in my experience their more versatile in treating the symptoms of medical conditions, useful for all sorts of problems e.g anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia (what I use it for), muscle spasms and tremors. Although everyone always gets a hard on for THC, indicas have a more balanced level of cannabinoids than sativas, which results in that sedated stone. Indicas are strictly evening smokes ;)<br /><br />The buds from an indica plant are normally rotund, thick and nice and dense in my own personal experience they normally have a nice skunky stench not so much on the fruity side and are normally dark green, tend to cough more with indicas (not any more after years of smoking) but they definitely produce thicker smoke.

				i think it&#039;s because the gov&#039;t has an easier time placing a ban on a single drug as opposed to multiple drugs.
