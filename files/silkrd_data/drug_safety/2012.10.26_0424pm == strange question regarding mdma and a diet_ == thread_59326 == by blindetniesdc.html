				ok so i keep having breakouts, due to too much yeast.<br />so ive started a new diet to kill the yeast off + give me more good bacteria.<br />diet consists of no sugar, dairy, gluten, bread, pasta, rice, alcohol&nbsp; etc + i take probiotics<br /><br />question is do you think if i took some mdma it would affect this diet? like will it lower my immune system causing diet to not work as good possibly?

				I can&#039;t really envision a direct relationship. <br /><br />As j-wowz pointed out there may be other factors at play though. Dancing all night on (a mix of alcohol and) mdma is a sure way to increase blood flow to your face, resulting in blushing and resulting in more contrast of pimples and such against healthy skin. <br /><br />As for problems with yeast or fungal infections there is a lot of BS out there. Altering your diet will usually not solve such problems. go to a proper GP to get diagnosis and effective treatment. Sometimes, however, there is little treatment available from skin conditions in adolescents, and you&#039;ll have to let time take its course. No herbs or diets will change that, unfortunately.

				thanks im just going to wait then.<br /><br />problem isnt exactly &quot;acne&quot; although thats what it looks like. its foliculitus. and its most likely from being on antibiotics and acne medicines when i was a teenager, killed most of my good bacteria leaving mostly bad bacteria. and dermtogist said that sugar etc feeds the yeast and diet will help kill the yeast.<br /><br />im currently using ketoconazole but thats not exactly a cure, maybe if she would prescribe me ketoconazole pills but she wont since its so bad on the liver.

				First of all, i&#039;ll consider you are generally in good health. In such a case ingesting sugar or starch will not lead to a big rise in blood glucose levels at all, since that will trigger release of insulin capturing the sugar from your blood for conversion into glycogen or fat before serum levels spike serously. Shortly, eating sugar will not make you sweat sugar. <br /><br />Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal medication (topical or oral), and will only affect problems caused by fungi, not ones cause by bacteria, or those caused due to excess secreteing of skin fats associated with adolescence. While ketoconazole is very effective in fighting fungal infections, it it not effective against anything else, and the only certain way to diagnose a fungal infection in skin would be taking a biopsy from an affected area. <br /><br />The problem with these skin conditions is that the results may look very much alike, but the fundamental causes can be completely different, and call for completely different treatments as a result. <br /><br />Something like isotretion (roaccutane) can be effective, but also has a pretty severe side effect profile. If you are in the dark about whats going on i would suggest seeing a dermatolgist. They can often diagnose problems by just looking at them, or take a tiny biopsy that would not even leave a visible scar to investigate the problem further.
