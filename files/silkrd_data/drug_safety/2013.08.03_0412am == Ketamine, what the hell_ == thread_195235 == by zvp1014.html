				So like, I don&#039;t even *like* the effects of high dose ketamine yet I keep taking high doses and I don&#039;t even know why.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had this k for like 3 or 4 days and I&#039;ve been sniffing it nonstop. I&#039;ve probably given myself serious urinary/liver tract damage. At lower doses it feels like a molly/xanax/acid hybrid which is nice but then I pour 100mg onto the scale accidentally and say fuck it and snort it all and I feel really wonky.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure I hate this drug yet high me doesn&#039;t want to admit it in fear of paranoia, and sober me doesn&#039;t remember how much I hate it. But then as it fades I start feeling like a spaceship and I love it again, snort some more, and get so high that I hate it again.<br /><br />Does anybody else feel my vibe? I&#039;m way too inebriated to properly communicate what I&#039;m trying to say.

				Yup, I&#039;m with you 150% on this one. I was actually a bit nervous when I first tried K, and I don&#039;t think I ever went into the &quot;K-hole&quot; although I may have got close, but I learned after a couple of times to enjoy it. The first time I tried it was a bummer for other reasons, but the feeling I get when I snort a few bumps (not large lines like coke) is a bit like being moderately drunk, and I get very philisophical (yeah I can&#039;t spell worth a damn). It ain&#039;t a drug to hate, and you could probably toot it daily for 2 or 3 weeks, and as long as you laid off it for a few weeks, side effects like incontinence &amp; other nice crap don&#039;t develope or resolve themselves. <br /><br />It&#039;s also my drug of choice for talking (typing) in these forums - like I said I get philisophical on it. Go relatively easy on it - most dissociatives are not really fun, and it takes &quot;practice&quot;. I&#039;m waiting on an order as we type..

				IMO with K you have to decide: or you use it as a recreational drug or you use it as you would a strong psychedelic.<br /><br />If you go with the recreational route then stick to low doses (naturally taking care of tolerance that increase quite fast). If you go for the psychedelic one instead go for a k-hole. The space in-between the two is usually uncomfortable in both cases because it&#039;s not one nor the other and it gives no benefits for what you want to do. If you want a recreational feeling then a too high dose will just make you feel sort of drunk and not able to do what you want to do and if you want a mystical or psychedelic experience everything lower than a k-hole is a waste and&nbsp; will not give what you search.

				I love Ketamine me.<br /><br />If you&#039;re hating it but unable to avoid temptation send your stock my way and I&#039;ll be a good enough friend to keep it from you.

				100mg is a bad dose imo, you want to either k hole or do nothing is my opinion. Some people like low dose ketamine but for me it just feels uncomfortable. Unless you only weigh 100 pounds 100mg is a low dose. Try taking 1mg per lb that you weigh and see how you like it. I like it a lot more at that dose than something like 100mg, which isn&#039;t enough to k hole and just makes me feel kind of woozy.

Either about double the dose (to 1mg per lb you weigh) or cut it in half.

				Well I finally snorted it all, and probably won&#039;t purchase more, at least not for a while.<br /><br />It seems just insanely dose sensitive and the problem is I felt like the dosing I needed changed every few hours, so I either over or underdosed constantly.<br /><br />The first time I drank a 75 mg solution with some OJ, felt no effects for an hour so I decided to snort 50 mg; after 5 minutes I felt nothing so I snorted 50mg more andHOLYSHITWHATSGOINGONICAN&#039;TFEELMYHANDSWHATAMIDOINGWHEREAMIWHOAMII&#039;MASPACESHIPIAMEARTHIAMTHEUNIVERSE.<br /><br />The afterglow from higher doses is nice, but it only lasts a short while and then I&#039;m inclined to redose again- and usually redose high enough to the point that I&#039;m once again thrust into an entirely different, sterile, clinical space universe.
