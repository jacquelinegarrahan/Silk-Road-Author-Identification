				So i kinda blacked out on Xanax this weekend...or generic Xanax for that matter... i had 25mg and i am pretty sure i ate all 25mg over the course of 2 days... I&#039;m DEFINITELY still feeling it...kinda like drunk but completely coherent...i would consider myself nodding out but there isn&#039;t that amazing opiate feeling...just wondering if this is the usual...i read up that Xanax doesn&#039;t really have many bad side effects, although i don&#039;t think too many people eat 25 pills.

				Alprazolam/Xanax is relatively inert in the liver. It forms no dangerous metabolites, and is generally a very benign medication in terms of it&#039;s load on the liver. It is however, dependent on liver function to get cleared from the body. So if you have a damaged liver - say from alcoholism, your system can get overloaded with the drug.

				<br />I&#039;ve been through similar negative experience recently( Though i was about to take only 1mg but it appeared that <br />somehow i did 10mg in 8 hours and mixed with alcohol, it was only a couple of drinks but the mix is truly evil.<br /><br />I&#039;d better not to tell the rest. No fun or therapy just destruction and massive loss of memory.

				yeah i definitely acted a fool... had no idea how much a&nbsp; bit of alcohol would send me off the end...but even though it was like almost 24hr+ since i ate a xanax i was still feeling ....pretty good to be honest....like nodding out and just enjoying the extreme calmness hahaha... i was just wondering if there are any serious withdrawl symptoms....like u know you become miserable on meth and cocaine...you feel uber sick on heroin....anything terrible happen from stopping long term xanax use?&nbsp; I try and only do non physically addictive drugs... IE....marijuana, LSD, DMT, Salvia, and other entheogens.&nbsp; But when i dabbled with these little blue devils i had tons of fun literally zombieing out for hours ....it was ridiculous... perfect for couple days of vacation.
