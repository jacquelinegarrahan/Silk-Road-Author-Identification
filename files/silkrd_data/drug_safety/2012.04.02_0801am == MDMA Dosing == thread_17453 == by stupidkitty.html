				Ok. <br /><br />So i have plenty of experience taking pills. I recently bought MDMA and made caps out of it. I put around 110mg in my caps.<br /><br />Took one Friday night , got super fucked up. Dumped another one - same amount in it and I didnt feel it hit me. I didnt seem to bump up the high.<br /><br />Saturday night, another cap, didnt hit me at all. <br /><br />Im not sure what the go is, as when ive taken pills previously and ive felt it significantly hit me everytime i drop. <br /><br />Should i be mixing it with something else?<br /><br />thanks for your help guys

				You gotta bear in mind that taking Es is not the same as doing powder/crystal MDMA. By and large pills are designed to be a mix of MDMA and mostly caffeine or or something that gives you a kick. Pure MDMA isn&#039;t always the same because it doesn&#039;t have that other crap in.<br /><br />Best thing to do is just hit a beasty 160-180mg hit of MDMA straight away because then you get it all in one go. :)

				Whenever you re-dose on MDMA, there is a certain point in time where any additional dosing probably won&#039;t do anything but make the comedown a bit more unpleasant. Your body develops a very acute tolerance to MDMA while it is still at peak levels in your body and as such, taking more really won&#039;t add much. The reason why it didn&#039;t affect you Saturday is simple, the acute tolerance has made your brain its bitch and your brain&#039;s serotonin reserves are a bit depleted. If you want an effect for multiple days in a row, you need to dose much higher on each subsequent day, but that&#039;s generally a poor idea. Wait at least 1.5 to 2 weeks minimum before rolling again, a month to be sure, and 2 months to primed and ready for another magical day. Hope this helped ya out and stay safe.
