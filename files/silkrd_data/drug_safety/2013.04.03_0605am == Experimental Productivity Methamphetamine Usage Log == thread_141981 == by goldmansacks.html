				I plan to use this thread to chronicle my meth usage for purposes of productivity and learning. Right now I&#039;m taking low doses (&lt;15mg) to get a feel for the threshold effects, as well as a Pre-treatment to sensitize myself to future use. After reading a number of threads and lots of other amazing information I think I have it worked out. I already consume a large vitamin regimen and eat healthy so i have that covered with little modification, doing this to prevent tolerance build up and neurotoxicity between doses. I work out several days a week, so I&#039;m going to be experimenting with meths effects on muscular strength and mass gains as well and if I can actively avoid catabolic muscle loss through proper diet. This should be interesting and hopefully my experiences will help out the community. <br /><br />Before I start I&#039;d like to give a shout out to Zipstyle, you are an asset to the community and your approach to sharing knowledge on these topics was indispensable to me, thank you.

				03/31/13<br />Mood: woke up feeling fine, fully rested, just slept way too late, recouping from a party the previous day.<br />3:30pm: Ingested 15mg and started cleaning (yes, before coming up lol). Got a great deal or organization done and when it hit I just continued till I was satisfied.<br />5:00pm: Feeling quite good and very stimulated, making sure to remember to concentrate my efforts and not just aimlessly buzz about. After cleaning some more stuff and working on some small tasks I decided to walk to the store. I went with a friend who was with me at the time, I was very talkative, but held back as to not seem like I was just motor mouth tweaking.<br />6:00pm: barely at anything this whole time expect a protein shake, not feeling hungry at all despite grabbing some good food to make. VERY thirsty this whole time, drinking and urinating an obscene amount.<br />7:00pm: Still feeling pleasantly buzzed when I got home, cleaned some more (surprise lol), then forced myself to eat some food.<br />8:00pm: Hung out for a bit then started to feel more base lined, no more rushing, but still very awake. Spent some time reading and researching some things. Ate some food.<br />1:00am: tried to sleep, finding it impossible, then continued to read.<br />9:00am: finally the effects are tapering off and I can sleep, is it common to be so restless on such a small dose?<br /><br />Notes: I enjoyed this day and the effects of such a small dose were altogether pleasant. I’m going to trim back my dose a bit though and not take it as late in the day, I have a feeling that I’m sensitive to it, for now lol. There’s also the fact that the half-life of meth is up to 12 hours, meaning even at 3am, there was still half of it in my blood. At this dose level it would take somewhere up to 40 hours to pass it all. Not going to dose tomorrow to adjust sleeping patterns a bit.

				4/02/13<br />Mood: Didn’t sleep well, woke up at 11am slightly groggy, but generally feel ok.<br />12:00pm: Ingested 12mg after eating a large breakfast and taking my daily vitamins, rode the bus to class.<br />1:00pm: starting getting a light stimulation that lasted till well after class, didn’t necessarily feel super concentrated, but well enough to get into some math and do fine. I chugged a protein drink during the break, despite not feeling terribly hungry.<br />3:30pm: rode bus home, was reading for a half an hour and got to my stop before realizing it. Got home and worked on somethings , did some research and ate, felt fairly efficient at this time, though not rushy or very stimulated. Eating was not really an issue and I was getting pretty hungry at this point.<br />8:00pm: after eating a meal I ingested my mid-day vitamins, at this time I started to feel pretty tired, this could be contributed to not sleeping very well. Also it was probably the amphetamines tapering off. Laid down and got some semi restful half sleep for about 30min and now feel closer to baseline.<br />11:00pm: Writing out this post, and here we are. feeling quite awake after my un nap<br /><br />Notes: I’m going to continue with a 12mg dose till Sunday, as per the sensitization schedule I’ve set for myself. I plan to lift tomorrow in the morning (leg day) before ingesting any amphetamines; we’ll see how a workout pre-meth will affect me. I’m curious if a low dose such as what I’m taking will be enough to cause a catabolic state and if it can be negated by proper calorie and protein intake.<br />

				clearnet link:<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2679<br /><br /><br /><br />Above link might be useful to you, it&#039;s a pretty extensive discussion about the pharmacokinetics of amphetamine tolerance.&nbsp; If you are planning to use meth for the purposes of long term increased efficiency, then tolerance is an issue you will need to address at some point.

				Remeber that the dosage equivalency between adderall and methamphetamine is not 1:1.&nbsp; from what I understand, a 3:1 conversion ratio is usually used(10mg dl-methamphetamine = 30mg adderall at 25% l-amphetamine and 75% d-amphetamine.&nbsp; I&#039;m not certain of those numbers but I can&#039;t find the equivalency chart I had before so I can&#039;t verify.

I wouldn&#039;t compare adderall to methamphetamine at all...dexedrine is a much closer comparison, though it still has similar dose conversions. 10 mg dexedrine is ~5mg meth I&#039;d say. Tolerance builds quickly, so you want the days you take off meth use to be higher in quantity than the days you do use meth. Keep tabs on the days you do use, it&#039;s easy to lose track.<br /><br />All the best!

				I did meth for six months not hardley ever ate a meal but a lot of candy and water I never slept and always ended up bored and just thinking to myself now I have a problem communicating with people because I&#039;d rather just think and keep everything to myself the hardest part was regaining my base weight and getting good eating habits back it has its benefits but be careful not to get sucked in to its highly addictive personality its so hard to stop

				after thought you might be able to do it in college and get away with it without anyone knowing but in order to get a good career your better off doing coke or something that doesn&#039;t have as much control over you people can see things about you that you cannot like when your eyes start appearing to be sucked in your skull from lack of sleep and like your cheeks being sucked in from lack of food its what I call skeleton head its a side effect

				I had someone explain hardcore drug usage to me in a way that I will never forget. &quot;Every time you use, it is like stepping on a train track. That train may not be coming through at that point in time, but the more times you step on that track the higher the chance is your ass is going to get railroaded with addiction.&quot; It has proven true for me with a few things. How is this &quot;experiment&quot; coming? Still able to keep it together, sleep, and eat?

				uh oh no follow up I&#039;m guessing the drug is winning this battle now sorry man its good shit but its uncontrollable and if you use regularly then you start thinking you need it&nbsp; to do one task then you need it for the next task then you need it for class then you need it for homework then you&nbsp; just need it all the time

				Ah, give him some time. He may be standing at the window making sure no one is spying on him. That shit just GRABS you. As soon as I read &quot;experiment&quot; and &quot;meth&quot; together, I heard trouble. I hope all is OK man. If you get back to this, as much as it may fucking kill you inside, flush the rest of your stash and be done. UNLESS, you are actually progressing in a positive manner. I think I would rather be experimenting with snake venom.
