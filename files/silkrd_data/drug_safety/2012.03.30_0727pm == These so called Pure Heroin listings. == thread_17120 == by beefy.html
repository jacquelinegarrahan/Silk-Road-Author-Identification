				Ok, I haven&#039;t yet bought any of the H on SR. But i&#039;d say i&#039;m a pretty experienced opiate/H user among other substances. I&#039;m on Methadone everyday now(70mg). That doesn&#039;t make me nod or anything, but it&#039;s enough to just be ok. no real euphoria or anything. For me to get a nice nod, I need about 230-280mg of methadone. When i used to do H (#4, Northeast US tan/white dope), i&#039;d do shots of 2, sometimes i&#039;d need 6 or more bags to nod. But what i really miss is just snorting it, totally different feeling IMO. More euphoric, you actually feel a warmth in your chest and the nod is a bit different, much nicer. I&#039;d really like to find some H that i can just do lines and nod. Just out of the top of your head, how far would say 1/4 or 1/2 go based on what i&#039;ve described. not IV, just snorting. I&#039;d like to hear what people who are H users have to tell me about the raw stuff on SR. thanks.

				There really is a lot of great gear available on SR. I personally favor snorting as well - I like the ritual of cutting up lines and the drip in your throat. For seriously top of the line, uncut gear I would recommend Tony76 (either his regular gear or his more expensive pebbles) and OPI, who only sells really potent pebbles. Psilocin is another great vendor - stuff is definitely cut a bit more but it&#039;s well-priced and gives a great nod. There are other vendors as well, but I personally have had good experiences with these three and they&#039;ve built strong reputations for themselves on the Road. Be wary of new vendors without a proven track record, especially if they ask you to finalize early because you&#039;re new. Finalizing early is fine with an established vendor, but be careful of someone newer who ask for or even requires it.<br /><br />Hope that helps - SR really is a great resource for those of us who value the quality of our gear and the convenience and relative safety of being able to buy online.

				Yea OPI&#039;s pebbles are very strong. So is Tony&#039;s but Opi&#039;s is just a bit stronger/better rush.<br /><br />And psilocin&#039;s #3 is amazing when smoked! :D<br /><br />Tar&nbsp; is very potent too.<br /><br />THe heroin section is doing very well right now :D I&#039;ve been here for 3 months and in the beginning there was 2 amazing heroin vendors(wumg and Nucleo),but both are gone. They had VERY STRONG H. Nuc had The STRONGEST CHINA WHITE EVER. SO BOMB :)<br /><br />Wumg Had VERY PURE AFGAN H and then at the end PURE ASAIN #4. People said on par with Nuc&#039;s china. I&#039;m still waiting on his letter so we shall see :)

				Cool, I&#039;m interested in Tony&#039;s and OPI&#039;s now. They both sound to be good and reliable. I wonder what happened to those 2 old dealers that PBucket mentioned. Hope nothing bad happened. But anyways, I should be getting in touch with one of these new guys here in the next few weeks or so and then i&#039;ll be able to write a review.

				Beefy, Tony&#039;s regular #4 will be plenty strong for you, and a great price, it is a privilege to do dope that good<br />

				A small match head sized bump of tony&#039;s was equal to 4-5 stamp bags of &#039;average&#039; quality dope... but that was IV

If tony&#039;s is that good, i won&#039;t ever need to look elsewhere. and i heard his stuff changes too from time to time. But i used to always just IV 1 bag from new batches. with SR dope, i&#039;ll be doing bumps at first to be really cautious. and i truly miss snorting, so i&#039;ll probably stick to that for a little while.
