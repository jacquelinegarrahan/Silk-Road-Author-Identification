				I&#039;m not going to take more, but this always happens to me with vicodin. I&#039;ve only taken about 4-5 last weekend, and before that havent taken them for about 4-6 months. Any reason why I wouldn&#039;t be feeling them? Even chewed them up. <br /><br /><br /><br />Also, would I have to worry about APAP and liver damage, don&#039;t intend to continue this dosage at all, or even take opiates for a while again. Took 4 at first, then took 2 a few hours later, then the final 2 6 hours after initial dosing. <br /><br />Any advise/incite would be amazing.

				Yeah, advice would be, it seems like you have a high, perhaps very high, natural tolerance but also the way you dosed was stupid. Orally dosing percs n vics, you gotta decide on a dose and take it, and if it wasnt enough take more next dose but wait till it starts wearing off (at least 3 hrs if not 4-6). Re-dosing vicodin after an hour or two is a waste.&nbsp; But even that inital 20 mg dose should be plenty, I duno if you really hadnt done it in 4-6 months, have you seriously abused opiates in the past? If not that you just have a stupid high natural tolerance apparently.

				I&#039;d say your reaction is pretty typical.&nbsp; Only a small portion of users experience a &quot;high&quot; from opiates.&nbsp; &nbsp;Euphoria is just one of many side effects that MAY occur with drugs like Vicodin/Percocet, along with nausea, dizziness, drowsiness and constipation.&nbsp; I was trying to explain the opiate high to my sister and dad and they just looked at me like I was crazy.&nbsp; All they get is horrid nausea and won&#039;t even take opiates if they&#039;re in pain for this reason.&nbsp; No euphoria, no high.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, you should&#039;ve felt SOMETHING off that high of a dose, even if it&#039;s just dizziness and sedation.&nbsp; 4,000 grams is the upper limit of acetaminophen you can have safely each day, though it may be less if you drink a lot or have liver disease.&nbsp;

				if you are going to take 8 vicodin&#039;s worth of acetaminophen/paracetamol (4000 mgs) at least take the effort of performing a CWE or something on the pills first. don&#039;t kill yourself.<br /><br />signed,<br />the internet<br /><br />i get high from hydrocodone. barely i guess. i&#039;m pretty functional and it gives me energy. it doesn&#039;t overpower the pain like say heroin or morphine does but it makes you not notice it from the energeticish buzz. but i insuffate hydrocodone so. that&#039;s p just me.

				What&#039;s probably going on is they&#039;re not fresh, back when I used to get a shit load of vics at a time after awhile they would seem to get less potent.

				I don&#039;t get high off them either. I forgot my dosage but I did my research well and no euphoria at all. I got somewhat buzzed and my coordination sucked, along with tiny pupils. However I didn&#039;t get &quot;high&quot; either. They were fresh out of the pharmacy too and I didn&#039;t have any tolerance.<br /><br />Since then I&#039;ve tried it a few other times and actually experienced negative symptoms. I felt poisoned for a few days afterwards one time.

				&quot;Felt poisoned&quot;? Dude, what? Shit is the one of the healthiest &#039;real&#039; drugs to take, assuming you don&#039;t become physically dependent. Thats why its prescribed so much, because its not poison, hah.<br /><br />But I understand certain people just have adverse reactions to certain substances, thats just how it is. I know people who&#039;s body react badly to alcohol, and im not talking about drinking too much I&#039;m sayin a couple drinks. Just how it is. (and ethyl alcohol is much closer to poison than hydrocodone)

				Well I forgot to say... The time I felt poisoned I took 3 (I forgot the actual mg) and I didn&#039;t do a cold water extraction, so it could&#039;ve been that. I felt like pure shit for a few days though, it definitely wasn&#039;t something else. This other time I took 2 because I had just gotten back from a rave and I was really sore. That made me feel nauseous too, but at least I slept for 16 hours. I&#039;m kinda glad they don&#039;t work on me.

Everyone I have ever met has eaten them by the tens several times a day. We have all made it just fine and it&#039;s been 10 years for us since we done this. I know it&#039;s not a healthy thing to do now but back then no one had a fucking clue and everyone did it. I&#039;m speaking from experience of what I&#039;ve seen personally you are speaking from some fear mongering doctors.

That was something else, perhaps all that tylenol but probably just something else. You ever been in the hospital with an injury? They juice you up so good, aint no hangover from it. The nausea though, yeah that will happen. I guess it isn&#039;t the worst thing that your body doesn&#039;t care for them because they are tricky. That is unless you have 3 surgeries like me which case the fact that they are incredible medicine is basically a lifesaver.&nbsp; If you do take opioids again, always eat at least a small substantive meal right before you dose. Only time I get nauseous is when i don&#039;t do that and am on completely empty stomach. It says that in the RX pamphlet by the way.

Thats the company thats selling the product writing that on there. I think its fucked up that they even package so much NSAID in all those percs n vics, and I won&#039;t dispute your story, I would just say you are very lucky its not like a debatable topic it is solidified fact. Just like abusing alcohol is bad for your liver, doesn&#039;t mean every lifelong alcoholic dies of liver failure, but quite a few do.
