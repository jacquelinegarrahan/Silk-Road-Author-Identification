I read your nbome story and it sounds like something that happened to a friend IRL as well, shit like that really hits home. RCs are damn scary things, and what is even more terrifying is the fact that I treated these powerful substances with pure nonchalance just weeks ago. Although my experience was a mere &quot;slap on the wrist&quot; compared to some RC nightmares, it was enough to pull me off the RC ride completely. Wish you the best in your recovery as well.

				i used to acquire it on clearnet years ago and was using it as an mdma substitute.&nbsp; didn&#039;t take long for me to allow myself to slip into near daily use and compulsive redosing every 45 minutes.&nbsp; This went on for about a year and was an extremely unpleasant time in my life.&nbsp; All the connections dried up thankfully and I have zero interest in ever putting another rc in my body again.&nbsp; I just got to an age and point in my life where it felt incredibly stupid and poisonous.&nbsp; All the skin on my lips used to peel off regularly while I was using it and I still have an embarassing flaking red skin condition on my face that developed during that time in my life and has not cleared in the 4 years I&#039;ve been methylone-free.<br />you&#039;re probably right, the stuff may be ok for some people but not for all.

				Hi, welcome to the world of harm reduction!&nbsp; It&#039;s not a warm and friendly place all the time. <br /><br />If you think your information is relevant, then, well, fuck the negative karma. You&#039;re not in this to be pretty and popular. <br /><br />For your windmill-tilting journeys, I offer the following observation: As a rule, people do think they&#039;re invincible.

				Methylone isn&#039;t MDMA, you hit the nail on the head with that statement really.<br /><br />I have tried Methylone, and many other &quot;legals&quot;, I have come to the conclusion your better off with tried and tested than these new chemicals that in reality, we have no clue about in regards to toxicity and long term effects.<br /><br />STICK TO MDMA, why buy something thats &quot;like&quot; MDMA, but well, is a totally different chemical which although&nbsp; may work on the same brain receptors, is very different in chemical make up from MDMA, and in a few years could turn out to be extremely toxic.<br /><br />Nice one for the harm reduction advice, anyone using &quot;research chemicals&quot; on a regular basis walks a risky path!

				I gave you some positive karma, because I know it sucks to go through shit and be mocked.<br />Don&#039;t sweat the karma at all though, trolls like Dilbert come and go.<br /><br />Some people have bad reactions to some substances, so you could be sensitive to methylone, which shouldn&#039;t take away from the general message that everyone should be careful when trying a new substance.&nbsp; Take it slow and see how it effects you.<br /><br />I never bother with &quot;substitutes&quot; for other drugs.&nbsp; Why bother reinventing the wheel, when the wheel is far superior.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see the point of synthetic cannibinoids either,&nbsp; MDMA and MDA are good enough to cover that whole range of feeling quite well, and weed does a good job doing what it does.<br /><br />But yeah.&nbsp; Ignore the trolls, when you blow up at them it just makes them giggle and do it more.

				Agreed with Jack. M1 for most is a much calmer roll with less intense side effects. It sounds like your body responded negatively to it. You have the right to share that info, but I&#039;ve heard more negative things about mdma than I have m1. My clients love m1 way more than they love mdma. No cracky comedown. I&#039;m sorry you had this reaction friend. I hope you are okay and sending good vibes!!!<br /><br />Ryno

				Damn, I&#039;m sorry I missed whatever the troll was saying.&nbsp; sounds mildly entertaining!<br /><br />Just wanted to add that as time went by and sources dried up I settled on ordering from a big site at the time that shipped from China.&nbsp; It had some strange characteristics indicative of poor quality but being psychologically addicted I still did it.&nbsp; Think that&#039;s what put me off the stuff.&nbsp; Nothing like a good poisoning to cement a decision in your mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then a UK seller burned me and sent me a big bag of &#039;Naphyrone&#039; (wtf is that shit?) instead of M1.&nbsp; Took all the packaging and RCs I had sitting around from over the years and put them in a bonfire.&nbsp; It felt great.<br /><br />clean M1 might be just fine but I just stick to the classics now.&nbsp; LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, cannabis, I have fallen in love with them again now thanks to SR<br /><br />On a side note I have read with interest John McAfees adventures in MDPV-land.&nbsp; Now that shit sounds hardcore.

				I can&#039;t believe I have to actually point this out...<br /><br />Whatever your experience was, unless you had the chemical you ingested LAB TESTED, you have no authority to say X causes Y.&nbsp; You don&#039;t know how pure X was, or if you even had X to begin with.&nbsp; All you know is someone on the internet sold you something and told you it was X.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying Methylone can&#039;t cause what happened to you, I&#039;m saying that you CANNOT SAY Methylone caused it to happen to you, because you simply do not have proof that it was even Methylone, nor do you have any proof that it didn&#039;t have impurities with their own side effects.

				Hey hey, I agree with you.&nbsp; I definitely should have at least marquis tested it but was dumb at the time.&nbsp; The first 40 grams or so I went through felt consistent to others accounts of m1 to me.&nbsp; The last 10g was something else or synthed poorly.
