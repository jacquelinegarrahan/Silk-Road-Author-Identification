				Just wondering if anyone has experience with this.&nbsp; I used to really enjoy doing shrooms and E every now and then (not together), but I had a couple of bad experiences (seizure on the shrooms, really bad stomach pains on E) that kind of freaked me out, so I always seem to get a bit of anxiety whenever I&#039;m coming up. I find if I get drunk ahead of time, usually there&#039;s no problems.&nbsp; Anyone have any other tips.&nbsp; Would taking a bit of valium help?

				I&#039;m in this same boat pretty much, I&#039;m trying salvia tomorrow and next weekend&nbsp; DMT. I&#039;m just sticking to short duration psycs for now. I&#039;m trying to ease myself into the experience on powerful psycs with long durations.

				smoking weed during a trip always eases anxiety if i have any, but the most important thing to do is accept how you&#039;re feeling. a lot of the time that&#039;s enough to bring the good vibes back. it&#039;s when you try to control and resist the trip that things start going badly.

Embrace every little thing psychedelics have to offer and they will embrace you in return. Whenever a somewhat negative sensation hits you, you should let it pass through you instead of trying to get rid of it or fight it if this makes sense. It is my opinion that these are not negative vibes from the drugs, but from you yourself and the psyches are expelling them from you. It is very therapeutic. Sometimes when/if they do hit me and I let the drugs do their thing I feel like I have been reborn and at absolute peace with the world and more importantly -- myself. Classic psychedelics force a certain type of self-reflection and introspection that has been used for countless years, however some people find this uncomfortable. Me, I find it levels me out.

				For me I can&#039;t really comment on anxiety for shrooms.<br />But that anxiety on E/MDMA is completely normal. I (and friends) almost always get extremely anxious, to the point of a panic attack due to feeling so overwhelmed for about 2/3minutes on the come up after a high dose of MDMA. Then I start to think about things to make me happy and BAM that euphoria hits me like a ton of bricks. I&#039;ve learnt to embrace this feeling now though, as when it hits me I know that the beautiful magic feeling that mdma produces is about to hit me. <br />For stomach pain on mdma, try taking some tums about an hour before you roll..

				I think for me, it all really stems from the time I had the seizure on shrooms (this was nearly 10 years ago).&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t taken an ungodly amount (about 5 grams) and wasn&#039;t mixing, so I&#039;m really not sure what caused it.&nbsp; However, now whenever I get a weird physical sensation on psychedelics, I start to worry that it&#039;s going to cause another anxiety attack or worse.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also had another instance on shrooms where I decided to take them on a really hot summer day, and I couldn&#039;t get my body to cool down.&nbsp; Was staring at my buddy&#039;s hardwood floor and saw all these twisted faces flying up at me.&nbsp; I knew I was tripping balls, and that didn&#039;t bother me, but the heat and constant sweating really freaked me out.&nbsp; I&#039;m also paranoid about swallowing my tongue or rubbing my eyes out when I&#039;m high.&nbsp; I guess what I&#039;m wondering is if anyone has tips for reassuring yourself that nothing is physically wrong or going to go physically wrong when you&#039;re in the midst of a trip.<br /><br />Like I said, it seems like if I get super drunk before indulging, none of these fears show up.

				i personally think that psychedelics in general amplify every emotion we experience. that being said dont feel bad, everyone feels anxiety and yes psychedelics make it worse. i would say that the best cure for anxiety during a trip is to be alone. when people are around a natural obligation to be &quot;there&quot; exists, but when you are by yourself you can focus on what it is trying to teach you without dealing with outside input that may confuse you/cause you to overthink. although the fact that you had a seizure on psilocybin/psilocin, that sort of alarms me. fungus is extremely safe. all i can assume is that you are succeptable to them. if that was the case for me, im not so sure i would trip. or if anything just blast off, 15 minutes isnt as big of a risk to take as 5-6 hours.<br />

				I think you bring up a good point about the crowd you&#039;re with being a factor.&nbsp; I am one of those intensely introspective trippers, so I tend to be very quiet and that freaks some people out, who then ask me what&#039;s wrong, which in turn freaks me out.
