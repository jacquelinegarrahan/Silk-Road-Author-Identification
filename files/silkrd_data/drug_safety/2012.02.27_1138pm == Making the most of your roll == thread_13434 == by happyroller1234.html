				I&#039;m going to be rolling for the first time in over two months this weekend, and I&#039;m wondering what are some of the best methods (or drugs to combine with MDMA) to potentiate and/or extend your roll.&nbsp; In the past, I&#039;ve gone a bit overboard trying to maintain the magic during the roll and make it last longer.&nbsp; And this results in me taking anywhere from 200-500mg of MDMA in a night.&nbsp; I know these amounts exceed the recommended dosage, so I&#039;m looking for an alternative to continuous redosing (snorting).<br /><br />My ideas:<br />empty stomach (but this is hard for me, kind of go crazy if I haven&#039;t eaten in a couple hours)<br />MXE<br />Ketamine<br />Piracetam<br />Adderall (but I&#039;m guessing more neurotoxicity?)<br /><br />So what do you guys use to extend/potentiate your roll?

				Piracetam doesn&#039;t really work for me.<br /><br />Oddly enough... Dark chocolate does.<br /><br />I typically eat around ~2oz of dark chocolate daily for a week leading up to my roll. <br /><br />Apparently it&#039;s a bit of a natural MAOI, but not as dangerous as an actual MAOI. <br /><br />Give it a shot. Just make sure your chocolate is ~70% cocoa.

				Honestly, a tried and true method for all amphetamines is an antacid, such as tums. Not the drug you were expecting ey?<br /><br />The oral bioavailability of amphetamine molecules is increased in alkaline conditions. Therefore, taking an antacid will raise the pH of the stomach causing more of the drug to be absorb into the bloodstream. <br /><br />In this way you will actually potentiate the effects of the same dose of mdma requiring you to use less<br /><br />Many of the other potentiators of mdma such as maoi are extremely dangerous and often lethal so can not be used. I dont know if I would recommend adderall either due to the potential toxicity issues of both, combining them would be more stressful as you mentioned plus I found mdma to be stimulating enough for me at least<br /><br />Be safe please, <br />- miRNA

				Preload and postload!<br /><br />You&#039;re gonna want some vitamins to help give your body more serotonin to roll on and help you recover faster after your roll. It&#039;s your body, don&#039;t waste it. Harm reduction can be fun!<br /><br />Taken from taimapedia&#039;s MDMA article: http://taimapedia.org/index.php?title=Mdma#preloading<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Basic List of Supplements<br /><br />5-HTP – precursor to serotonin<br /><br />Vitamin B6 – required to create serotonin &amp; other neurotransmitters, also helps absorb magnesium<br /><br />Magnesium – helps prevent jaw clenching, also minimizes muscle cramping<br /><br />L-Tryptophan – precursor to 5-HTP, not as effective but still useful<br /><br />L-Glutamine – used to produce neurotransmitters and for energy in the nervous system<br /><br />L-Tyrosine – precursor to dopamine, epinephrine, and nor-epinephrine<br /><br />L-Dopa – precursor to dopamine (better than L-Tyrosine)<br /><br />GABA - Promotes Relaxation, Eases sleep. It Inhibits over-stimulation caused by excessive neurotransmitter release. Doesn&#039;t pass the blood-brain barrier so it&#039;s primarily a body effect.<br /><br />Alpha Lipoic Acid – a water soluble and fat soluble antioxidant<br /><br />Vitamin C – a water soluble antioxidant<br /><br />Vitamin E - a fat soluble antioxidant<br /><br />Green Tea Extract – another commonly available antioxidant<br /><br />Melatonin - a hormone that regulates sleep cycles and promotes REM sleep. it is sold as a vitamin supplement at most stores and is helpful in easing back into sleep. Also acts as an antioxidant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Personally I take 5-HTP regularly as a mood booster, and increase the dose during my preloading/postloading time. I also take a complex multivitamin with some of the amino acids mentioned. I have a hard time finding L-Dopa, but L-Tyrosine isn&#039;t too hard to find and it&#039;s arguably very important. I also take a pill called Z-BEC (which is zinc and vitamins B, E, C) before and after rolling for the antioxidant effects. I also chew gum that has vitamin B6 in it, since it helps with the jawing and it has B6 :) And finally, the melatonin really is a good idea for going to sleep after any substance.<br /><br />Don&#039;t take my habits as absolute science... I&#039;ve just been doing what works for me, and sometimes I hear that you&#039;re not supposed to take 5-htp the day of your roll, or not at all during preloading, yada yada. I take it for my mood and it seems to be more effective than not taking it at all, so there we go.<br /><br />Oh yeah and the tums thing is legit too :) have fun!

				The two things that would really do it AFAIK are:<br />1. pre-loading<br />2. MAOI<br /><br />Somebody earlier said that chocolate as a natural MAOI is safe. That is 100% not the case. It just has a much smaller amount of MAOI in comparison to other substances. While pre-loading with vitamins and such can be done rather easily and safely, you have to be careful with the MAOI. You&#039;d need to study the effects of serotonin syndrome very carefully, and start at a very very small dose of MAOI and work your way up to a level that works well for you. Finding the right amount of MAOI could potentially take a year, presuming you don&#039;t roll too often. But, serotonin syndrome has the potential both for death and permanent brain damage, so if you start getting the signs you should go to the hospital IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />Actually, with the chocolate, I wasn&#039;t aware that it had such good MAOI properties. I thought most of the effects were just the caffeine, theobromine, and phenethylamine in the product. But MAOIs are usually just bad ideas. =/
