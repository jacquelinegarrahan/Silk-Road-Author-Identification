				Im not a fan of RC&#039;s, the problem for me is no-one really knows the long term effects of these chems, im not sure if there has beeen any studies. <br />I think it would be a good idea to post your experiences here good or bad here so people can get an idea of what there getting into before taking unknown substances...<br /><br /><br />

				I took around 25mg of 2c-I, and the worst effect that I had was that I pooped out the entire contents of my bowels. I had diarrhea maybe three times over the course of the trip. I also had a really bad migraine after the experience. I don&#039;t know if this was because of the chemical itself, or the fact that I didn&#039;t eat or drink for several hours. I came down first, so I tried to get my still loopy friends to drink some Gatorade or eat food. They could barely eat or care about eating which really worried me. Luckily, everyone turned out to be fine in the end.<br /><br />It was fun at some parts, but the excessive diarrhea that I experienced really turned me off from taking it. That and nobody ate or drank anything for a loooong time, I can&#039;t remember how long. My friends who took it with me didn&#039;t experience the same terrible side effects as me, oddly. They even wanted to try it again.

				diarrhea - probably you ate too much or the wrong food before tripping. headaches after 2cx&#039;s are pretty common, large doses will make them worse.

				my lady and i took 2 mg of 25i and the trip ended with her in the hospital with an extremely elevated heart rate. bad times all around. she could have easily died. i didn&#039;t experience any real negative effects, besides the fact that it felt like my visual cortex was frying... and it just doesn&#039;t feel good for my brain at all. why be a human guinea pig when all the best psychedelics already exist and have been used safely for ages? there have been a lot of adverse effects to 25i, including seizures and death. not worth the risk, in my opinion. always tread lightly when trying new chemicals.

				Drunkenly snorting 2cb was never fun, esp considering i eyeballed my dose and passed out because of the nasal pain.<br />not good.<br /><br />also taking 25c on a whim and spending 8 hours locked in a dark place mentally sifting through my garbage, on my own in the middle of the night.<br /><br />how you are on the day, the dose, the company your in (or lack of) and the setting are all important with psychedelics.

				All very good points lol. I myself have never had a particularly bad exp with 25i /25c , thats all ive tried as far as RCs. the headaches ive gotten , along with some explosive mudd butt, but i also believed it was drom dehydration and having had too full of a stomach to be tripping. over all id really like to see these RCs end up being more safe than not, because i certainly like dropping them, infact im getting some tabs from HardHustle along with a load of&nbsp; L as soon as the road is back in order&nbsp; ;D

				After trying mxe and 25=xxxx i will never try and RC. they are dangerous and can easily kill you. RC&#039;s should be banned! give me all the negative karma you want. this is my opinion

				A couple of months ago I was hanging with my friends at a Psytrance nature party in our little Israel and we bought some Hofmann blotters which supposedly were LSD. The blotters had really really strong bitter metallic taste, like your tongue gets burned and numbed, that&#039;s how we felt, so we were little suspicious. We started feeling the effects after 15 minutes. the trip itself was quite similar to acid but I noticed it was somehow different. I&#039;m pretty sure it was substance from the NBOME group... It was quite strong and very very &quot;dirty&quot; compared to clean acid trip. The body high was strong, a lot of bad thoughts came across our heads and it was easy getting into bad loops... Although the trip was harsh, we listened to great music at the party and personally, I enjoyed more from the party and less from the trip, but one friend of mine had pretty bad trip that day. He just couldn&#039;t stop saying that he knows for sure that what we took wasn&#039;t acid. Guess he was right... He had lots of bad thoughts and bad loops. After that day, he got little bit unbalanced psychologically, he has been taken SSRI but said it didn&#039;t help him, and until now he still has sort of post trauma from his first bad trip. Couple of weeks later, we heard that people got really f**ked up from eating lots of these supposedly LSD Hofmann blotters. The problem is that people sell these kinds of RC on blotters as LSD, chemicals which haven&#039;t been tested enough to prove safety for human consumption, side effects, long term use ect. ect. and some substances probably haven&#039;t been tested at all on humans... So people don&#039;t know what the hell they&#039;re taking. It&#039;s really dangerous. My friend was saying that the trip kind of pulled him backwards after all the good &quot;acid therapies&quot; we had, which pushed him forward...&nbsp; today he doesn&#039;t touch any drugs anymore, not even weed...&nbsp; :(<br /><br /><br />Why should we touch these kind of shit when we have the best acid here?

				Took an unknown 2c-? at a music festival while on excessive amounts of possibly unclean MDMA (350+mg). Felt like there was a golf ball in my heart and the visuals were horrible, zero depth perception and everything looked like a painting/scrapbook. Wouldn&#039;t recommend based entirely on this experience although I have met drug purists who claim 2c-B is a godsend.

They are brutal! I&#039;ve heard terrible things. ;(<br /><br />And please for the love of God do not double your dose till you&#039;re where you want to be, youll have been where you wanted to be 30 minutes ago and now youre puking all over your buddies pad wondering if you&#039;re alive. These can be extremely harsh on your body even in miniscule amounts.<br /><br />Amazon.com ; milligram scale for $22 shipped; cross reference with erowid, and go with a parachute in rice paper for safest ingestion, but since no one here is going to have that handy enjoy a nice 1/4 sheet of toilet paper. Yuck.<br /><br />The other end of that spectrum is not so funny.<br /><br />Stay safe guys, most importantly, arm yourselves with knowledge, if they don&#039;t have extensive documentation of an RC you&#039;re about to order, rethink your relationship with your vendor. Going out of your zone with a narcotic substance is not always the best idea, and you&#039;re sure not the first or last to take it way to far so start low! Worst case scenario you have to weigh up another bump :P <br /><br />The other end of that spectrum is not so funny. I&#039;ve seen people hospitalized thanks to RCs, 2Cs being one of them.<br />

				Not entirely a bad experience,&nbsp; by my standards anyway, but I had a weird time the first time I smoked JWH-18. I rolled the blend into a joint and me and my old lady passed it back and forth for a few puffs. Then, out of the blue, I was so high I could barely see straight. Too high to get up, I almost couldn&#039;t speak. I had to snatch the joint away from my wife, because I couldn&#039;t get words to come out in a way that made any fucking sense. I entertained the possibility that I was going to die, but what put me into panic mode was the thought that I had poisoned her.<br /><br />She wasn&#039;t even high. It had almost no effect on her. The situation was reversed with JWH-200. It got her high as hell in one hit and gave her a minor panic attack. I barely felt it.<br /><br />I guess the lesson is that some RC&#039;s are really unpredictable.

				Be careful with MXE, if you got really strong uncut stuff don&#039;t take too many lines because then it&#039;s really a heavy trip.&nbsp; I however do love the drug and have used it multiple times, it&#039;s so hard to explain how it makes you feel... but its AMAZING.

Too high to get up, I almost couldn&#039;t speak. I had to snatch the joint away from my wife, because I couldn&#039;t get words to come out in a way that made any fucking sense.

				I&#039;ve done quite a few research chemicals, and I can honestly say I&#039;ve never had a bad experience.&nbsp; None of them have ever made me vomit, or have diarrhea.&nbsp; On the majority of RC trips I have taken, I have seen much beauty and learned things about myself and the world.&nbsp; I always research doses carefully, read trip reports, and try to take it easy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done 2C-B, 2C-I, 25C-NBOMe, 25I-NBOMe, MXE, and 6-APB.&nbsp; The only things that were slight bad on any of these trips were that the first time I did 2C-B, I snorted like 30mg+, got the worst nasal burn of my life, and the effects were weak, because I think kwik had a weak batch; and the first time I did 2C-I, I didn&#039;t enjoy it at all, mostly probably because I had taken 25I less than week prior to dosing, and I just felt 2C-I had a worse body load.<br /><br />But I like the idea of this thread.&nbsp; People should definitely do their research on RCs.<br />Be competent before you consume.

				I am not particularly fond of RC&#039;s, yet I have had a few experiences with them. I agree with the consensuses that they cause headaches. I have done 25C around 5 times and if treated with respect it can yield much beauty. However, I have bad experiences because one time I thought my best friend was coming on to me and I flipped the fuck out, and another time I went to some commercial rave (dayglow, never again) and was around conformist fucks. 25C is much better than 25I which I have experimented with once. 25I lasts too long and is too intense. Aside from those I have also indulged in 2CB (I don&#039;t consider an RC) and it has become a staple in my psychedelic diet. All in all, I think RC&#039;s aren&#039;t really that great and psychedelics that have existed longer than those are the safest option.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Admittedly, he doesn&#039;t mention if the 2mg was split, or per head, but even 1mg is a massive dose. <br /><br />:(<br /><br />

I was high as hell and filled the 6 gram cup by mistake. Some customers that had high tolerance were complaining so I was going to start filling their tabs with ~450mg but wanted to make sure that if they ate two that the side effects etc would not be too much. My normal dose was 500mg + 250mh +1hr. I think I was also chasing the dragon myself a bit.<br /><br />I think I drank about 3-5 grams by mistake before I realized it and stopped drinking.<br /><br />Scary scary scary. life slipping away massive clenching everywhere panic attacks heart stopping / skipping parylisis serotonin syndrome hypothermia etc.<br /><br />dont do it.<br /><br />Luckily for me that was my wakeup call. I ate two (meph?) rolls a few months later and rolled for like 30m-1hr and felt cheated.<br /><br />tried m1 about a month later (high dose) and got awful side effects on the comedown and havent used it since.<br /><br />It doesnt do that to normal people that dose correctly over time obv.<br /><br />I think the OD long term affected my tolerance and receptors.<br /><br />I also have very strong ADD symptoms now to this day. I did before, but now it&#039;s badish.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My god man! I&#039;ve binged on ( good ) methylone for a week, and my doses were at the highest 200 - 300 mgs every few hours when I felt like I needed it to keep the rush going. <br /><br />That being said, I did feel like I od&#039;d on it once, but a much much more mild OD than you had - I just was really paranoid and my eyes were shaky and my heart was racing but not too bad, had to lie down and had CRAZY closed eye hallucinations ( giant worms made of blades flying through my disembodied soul which was wandering around my old dorm room ). The closed eye shit made me feel like I was dying, even though I realized I wasn&#039;t. At a point, I was floating above my body while I had my eyes closed, and staring at myself. It was an uplifting experience, however scary it was. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had really good experiences with RC&#039;s, though. I enjoy them immensely. I also sell them locally. One thing I absolutely do not believe in is the misrepresentation of drugs - whenever I sell RC&#039;s, I make a point to tell new customers about the potential risks they&#039;re taking and to not overdo it. I genuinely care about people&#039;s health - I don&#039;t want them to get hurt at all. I&#039;m saddened that many people have had bad times with RC&#039;s! The only ones I really enjoy are 2c&#039;s, NBOMe&#039;s, and M1. Those, to me, seem to be the &#039;cleanest&#039; feeling of all the RC&#039;s.

Most IRL drug purchasers honestly just wanna get high and DGAF. The whole harm reduction thing is more of an online thing.<br /><br />CEVs on M1 can be OUT OF THIS WORLD :)<br /><br />Heart racing on comedown pretty standard and it&#039;s why I stopped. I just know that this shit can not be good for your body.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, it&#039;s similar where I&#039;m from too. The thing about it is, most kids can&#039;t even tell the difference. Which leads me to believe that most of the mol in my area is either REAL shitty or just m1. That being said, with the way I&#039;ve done it, I do feel that it feels so much cleaner than piperazines or other shit they try to sell as molly. I know a guy who actually got MDPV pawned off on him as molly, which I think is really really stupid. Although I have a distaste for MDPV, I find it a pretty garbage stimulant, too prone to redose and too apt to cause paranoia, but it can really fuck up people. Which makes me feel really bad when I see college kids getting fucked with them and not knowing what&#039;s happening. <br /><br />My m1 experiences have been great, though. I&#039;ve binged for long periods of time ( and by binge, I don&#039;t mean I&#039;ve been staying up 24/7, but binging from the morning till I find the will to stop. I&#039;ve stayed up for probably 48 hours max, and that was when I started seeing shadow people and having intense CEVs. But I don&#039;t regret the experience. For a while after that binge, though, I do feel I had some nervous twitchiness that only recently went away ( the mild od happened 4 or 5 months ago ) but the CEVs were the absolute closest thing I&#039;ve had to astral-projection. After I got past the initial fear, I felt really good about the entire thing and mainly just worried about the intense heart-racing. I don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s particularly neurotoxic though; I&#039;ve never had any headaches or anything after completing a binge, only pure afterglow and happiness that lasts for at least a week.<br /><br />As a person who&#039;s suffered from major depression in the past, M1 truly helps with that ; it&#039;s just serotonergic enough to give that uplifting euphoria and awareness of situations, and the high dopaminergic qualities of it make it a worthwhile stim as well; I&#039;ve had no trouble focusing on it and feel like low doses of it help my ADD, too. I think that with proper research it could become a wonderful clinical drug, if the FDA would allow it. I don&#039;t think any empathogen is going to get sanctioned research done, though. :[

I&#039;m familiar with the fact that they were some of the chems Shulgin discovered but I lump them in with most other RC&#039;s since they were part of the bath salt explosion in the late-90&#039;s/early 2000&#039;s. They&#039;re still not researched to the extent that LSD and other such chemicals have been researched, though. And if you ask most people who aren&#039;t in the drug scene about them they&#039;re going to look at you funny unless they read somewhere about them in the news.

And ketamine has been around forever and a day, with tons of research done on it. <br /><br />That being said, MDMA has had a lot of research done on it, and even though it&#039;s definitely faded in the past few decades, it still has research done on it and the general consensus is that limited use of it is far, far less toxic than they originally believed. And all methylone is is MDMA with a double-bonded oxygen on it. Now, I don&#039;t know too much about psychopharmacology, so for all I know that double-bonded oxygen could very well completely muck up the entire molecule, but I like to think that it has a similar safety profile to MDMA.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed is that with extended use the original magic of the chemical has faded. I used to roll on methylone, just sink back and melt. That was for the first few times I did it. Now, I still get chatty and feel really nice, but I never get to that rolly melty state I used to get to. I haven&#039;t had good methylone in a while, though. Some of the best methylone I&#039;ve had has come from Nevita, which makes me really happy that he&#039;s selling it again, but from what I understand it&#039;s only in 100 gram shipments, which is hard for me to pull off unless someone throws in with me because I just don&#039;t have the money, not having a job and having bills to pay and all. <br /><br />As far as comedowns go, though, I don&#039;t usually have bad ones with any drug I&#039;ve tried so I could just be lucky. The only comedowns I&#039;ve had that were uncomfortable to me were the ones I had when I&#039;ve abused benzos, and the fucking retarded comedown from when I used to robotrip. Most comedowns I have usually just give me a headache, but I get migraines all the time so having a mild headache is just a normal day for me. Comedown from stims though does give me a headache that makes me feel like I&#039;ve definitely fried some neurons, though, haha. I just feel like my brain&#039;s boiling over. But since I go to college and live with my folks when I&#039;m not in college I don&#039;t have a lot of opportunity to abuse in the winter and the summer so I take this time to center myself and rebuild the damage I do during the semester. <br /><br />Sorry for the tangent. I tend to go off on them quite a lot. As far as you knowing people that abuse the fuck out of it, I feel the same way - the first time I tried it I was getting it locally from a dude who pretty much did it all day every day. I&#039;ve done similar things when I&#039;ve had upwards of 40 or 50 grams to fuck with, and the only thing I notice is that the serotonin gets depleted WAY before the dopamine does. At the end of the third day of abuse it just feels like you&#039;re doing some straight-stim, with none of the open-chattiness that comes with serotonergic activity.

You don&#039;t really go out of your way to be empathetic and such with simply dopaminergic activity. The serotonin is what gives you that empathy that makes opening up in conversation easier; that was what I was talking about. So I guess it&#039;s a mix of the two, really.

				2 years ago I sold spice AKA k2, fake weed, synthetic weed. At this time there was much less regulation and almost no states had any laws. In general the spice was safe but because solvents are used to apply the chemicals its possible that some of the solvent will remain on the spice if its not aired out properly. Good spice will get you a short high that is good, but not as good as weird nor is it exactly like weed. <br /><br />Recently spice has got alot worse because there are more people applying the chemicals using industrial grade solvents and then not airing it out properly. I would recommend that everyone avoid spice. Its just not safe. I am not saying you will die but after dealing with it for so long I have come to the conclusion that its unhealthy and that no one should do it!

Your CB receptors aren&#039;t meant to activate the way synth-cannabinoids activate them. Full agonists of the CB receptors tap into paranoia, anxiety, hot flashes... along with a fuckton of other side effects. I mean, like I have said before, I don&#039;t knock anybody for doing drugs but to be honest spice and shit is just bad for you, y&#039;know? Not to mention I&#039;ve seen a bunch of my friends get addicted as fuck to &#039;em. Like waking up 4, 5 times in the middle of the night to smoke more spice &#039;cause the withdrawal made it impossible to go to sleep. Feels bad.

Some of the best methylone I&#039;ve had has come from Nevita, which makes me really happy that he&#039;s selling it again, but from what I understand it&#039;s only in 100 gram shipments, which is hard for me to pull off unless someone throws in with me because I just don&#039;t have the money, not having a job and having bills to pay and all. <br /><br />As far as comedowns go, though, I don&#039;t usually have bad ones with any drug I&#039;ve tried so I could just be lucky. The only comedowns I&#039;ve had that were uncomfortable to me were the ones I had when I&#039;ve abused benzos, and the fucking retarded comedown from when I used to robotrip. Most comedowns I have usually just give me a headache, but I get migraines all the time so having a mild headache is just a normal day for me. Comedown from stims though does give me a headache that makes me feel like I&#039;ve definitely fried some neurons, though, haha. I just feel like my brain&#039;s boiling over. But since I go to college and live with my folks when I&#039;m not in college I don&#039;t have a lot of opportunity to abuse in the winter and the summer so I take this time to center myself and rebuild the damage I do during the semester. <br /><br />Sorry for the tangent. I tend to go off on them quite a lot. As far as you knowing people that abuse the fuck out of it, I feel the same way - the first time I tried it I was getting it locally from a dude who pretty much did it all day every day. I&#039;ve done similar things when I&#039;ve had upwards of 40 or 50 grams to fuck with, and the only thing I notice is that the serotonin gets depleted WAY before the dopamine does. At the end of the third day of abuse it just feels like you&#039;re doing some straight-stim, with none of the open-chattiness that comes with serotonergic activity.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />im not sure if serotonergic activity causes chattiness it might be a dopa type thing as well --- think coke. I have noticed that I am a little more chatty at safe non abusive adderal doses too and I think amphetamines are straight dopaminergic but I&#039;m just guessing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, amphetamines also bind to SERT (serotonin transporter), although their affinity for DAT (dopamine transporter) and NET (norepinephrine transporter) is way higher.

				Shulgin is a brilliant chemiist but he never meant for ecstacy to become a mainstream party drug taken in high doses. Many people claimed E was safe as when it first came on the scene. 25 UK a pill! <br /><br />Trouble is, as we now know, taking too much E (which is one of the most well known research chemicals) CAN do damage. I know people who would take 20 pills because their tolerance was so high they were able to cope with such high doses. But, I think we all know every high needs a low. If you take a lot of cocaine, you will feel great that night but will have a down the nexy day. With E, the down takes 24 hr to kick in as your seretonin levels are still a bit high the nexy day.<br /><br />I have taken E very few times. I guessed that the people taking 20 pills were a warning to me. I love to party and would have been popping 20 pills if I had started down that route. A lot of people who done too much E suffer depression, others, who have taken 1000 or more doses of 180mg or so, are fine! <br /><br />So, now we know E has its downside, we now have thousands of RCs being manufactured, even bespoke concoctions which I suspect are used for Euro Coke. The truth is, anyone using the RCs is a test subject. Nobody can sat what will happen long tern until we are ten years or twenty in the future.<br /><br />Also, RCs are made solely for profit. The original RCs were just genuine people curious about alterered perceptions. They tested unknown drugs on themselves. Their friends tested, until a circle of people had used and no side effects reported.<br /><br />Myconcern is that RCs are cheap. You can buy some which are VERY potent at small doses, so all it takes is a mix up, someone finds your bag of white powder at a party and snorts 1000 times the reccomended dose of some RC.<br /><br />Long term we do not know what these drugs will do.<br /><br />I think we have enough drugs to suit every occasion already, drugs which have been proven to be &#039;harmless&#039; as long as you play by the rules and are healthy enough to use them.<br /><br />That said, its possible some RC might be a very effective med for depression, perhapsd kicking in 30 mins later not 30 days! Anti Ds are VERY powerful and have very real side effects which would make most people depressed!<br /><br />So, its your life, your choice, my view is that I got a list of ten tried and tested drugs, I&#039;ll stick to those, but might use some RC if it is used for ten years by millions and is proven to be cool!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

It&#039;s just people with gleams in their eye trying to make money that ruin them for the mainstream.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />great post and i wholeheartedly agree with the first paragraph.

				Since when is the desire to make money a bad thing? Too much blame for the perils of RCs is attributed to those who manufacture and sell them. Each of us can choose which drugs we do or do not consume. We can choose to inform and educate ourselves or not.&nbsp; We can choose to inform and educate our kids or not.&nbsp; But we should make our choices and live, or die, with the consequences and stop looking for someone else to blame or a government agency to solve all our problems.&nbsp; Information, education and personal responsibility are the way to harm reduction, not prohibition.&nbsp; Erowid has done more to reduce the harm of drugs than any government agency has.&nbsp; You can bet on that.

				Every drug started out as an RC.<br />Most antidepressants, antipsychotics, and even ritalin are not studies well enough to say anything conclusive.<br /><br />I usually think, ok if it&#039;s exactly like substance bla, with one ion or whatever different, then the outcome will be the same but a little different and therefore the side effects.<br /><br />There are some rc&#039;s that are not so ok I guess, like 5-it or what was it called?<br /><br />Friend of mine used 2ct-7 (was legal here for a while) and was shitting, puking and pissing at the same time in the shower. Still was one of the better trips for him :p<br /><br />I never had any problems with 2cb. Also didn&#039;t take it that many times. Once bought from a vendor here who said 20mg&#039;s a capsule while it was more like 16-17.
