				What do you think is the best method of consuming LSD blotters?<br />Are there differences at all?<br />I guess swallowing while the blotter is in your mouth is not so good? Because it get&#039;s dissolved in your spittle(word unknown) and then transported into your stomach where is it inactive.<br />I always move it around at lot any play with it with my tongue, not a good thing to do? Should it stay at the same place for the 30 mins or however long you want to have it in your mouth or doesn&#039;t it matter when it gets moved around a lot?<br /><br />Is there a &quot;special place&quot; where you put it? (Apart from your heart of course &lt;3 ;D)

				LSD is not inactive when swalllowed. It absorbs more quickly when kept under the tongue but will work fine too if swallowed. As a matter of fact this is one way to test whether you have gotten an RC or real LSD as most RCs are not active when swallowed but LSD is.<br /><br />Wherein the mouth you keep it and whetherr to move it or keep it still I am not sure. I expect it will make little difference just as it in my experience make little difference whether I eat them right away or keep them under the tongue for a while except as said it kicks in a bit quicker when kept under the tongue.<br /><br />Probably DoctorX can tell you where in the mouth you will get the easiest transfer into the bloodstream but as said in my experience just swallowing them works just a well just a bit slower.

				Well, that is another misinformation cleared up for me, thanks. :)<br />So it was good that I swallowed it at the first time after 30 mins sublingual.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try buccal this time I think, and then swallow it again after half an hour.<br />It should work even if you put in in your nose I guess, or even anal. Or directly into the blood stream by cutting. (... no, just no) The bloody blotter.
