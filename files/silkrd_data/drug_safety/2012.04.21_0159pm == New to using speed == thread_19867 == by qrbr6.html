				I intend on doing research on speed before I use it as I have done with all other drugs in the past to be informed but SR can&#039;t be a bad place to start. Just a few quick questions;<br /><br />1. Which method do you use to take it and why?<br />2. How much should I take for my first time? <br />3. Any good vendors that ship internationally? I&#039;m looking at Aakoven.<br />4. Which method of administration is most common?<br /><br />

				Hi mate, the ROA depends on what form you get it in. I get the paste form and take it orally. As for the dosage it depends on the purity of the speed you get. I&#039;d say start of with 250mg (quarter of a gram) and see how it goes. If you feel like its not enough do another 250mg... I tend to avoid taking anything over a gram of good quality speed in a day... But that&#039;s just me.

				Thanks for the reply. Yeah I was thinking of getting paste.&nbsp; The only problem with orally (in my opinion) is that not all of it is absorbed. I read somewhere new users should use 50mg but I assume that is powder form. How long would 250mg last? I like it to last 4 hours and not have to redose when I do anything. <br /><br /><br />What about powder though?

				I wouldn&#039;t do 250mg the first time. If it&#039;s good that&#039;s a lot of speed. I was speeding my ass off of 60mg of Adderall. Start small because you can always take more if it doesn&#039;t do what you want it to do. I usually snort it. It works orally, but the effects take longer to come on and the high isn&#039;t as intense. It does last a&nbsp; little longer though. It&#039;s best IV&#039;d, like most drugs, but is far more dangerous and addictive taken that way like most drugs.<br /><br />

				I would say dont worry about overdoing it, but be prepared to feel terrible afterwards, especially if you&#039;re new to speed. The crack out hangover gets better if you do it frequently.
