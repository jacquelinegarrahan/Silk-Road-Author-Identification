				I bought some mephedrone from edgarnumbers a month or so ago. Finally got around to taking it about 5 days ago. Holy shit am I filled with regret. Took it with a couple of friends, maybe 100-120mg&#039;s, we all liked it at first. Mild high, somewhat like amphetamines maybe.&nbsp; Now it feels like my brain might not ever really work the same again, like it&#039;s being clamped, it feels really wrong. My friends are still struggling as well and they took the same amount as I did. Definitely not worth the high, or any high really.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this experience with mephedrone? I&#039;m particularly curious if anyone out there has had experience with this batch. I&#039;ve tried most of the recreational drugs out there and this one is pure neurotoxic poison as far as I&#039;m concerned. Never thought a small amount of any drug could have this effect.&nbsp; :-[

				Yes. Although it is fun in some ways it seems very toxic. Neuro and Cardio.&nbsp; It is also super fiendish,&nbsp; most people can&#039;t resist re-dosing, which only adds to the negative effects after a short extra burst of euphoria.<br /><br />It is evil shit,&nbsp; and IME it took months to get completely back to normal after using 5 - 10 times over 6 months. I was concerned that I had done permanent damage psychologically and to my heart. I don&#039;t feel that way now though.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend it, especially if you have access to MDMA.<br /><br />No offense to edgarnumbers, never tried his stuff.

				4-MMC was hugely popular in the UK up until April last year when it was finally banned.<br /><br />You could buy it in headshops, sex shops, the internet always labelled as &#039;plant food&#039; to exploit a grey area in the law.<br /><br />I did a couple of grams over a month or so. I liked it to be honest.

				I have done mephedrone a bunch of times and always enjoyed it. I don&#039;t like it nearly as much as real MDMA or methylone though. Mephedrone does leave me feeling more poisoned than other entactogens but if done in moderation it can be fun. You should try methylone - the crash is worse but the euphoria is way better, and it (as far as we know) is not nearly as toxic. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if sourcing is allowed or not, but there are a bunch of great and much cheaper places to get these online from &quot;plant food&quot; distributors. If a mod reads this I would appreciate it if they would let me know if sourcing for RCs is allowed here.<br /><br />Forcing yourself to eat and drink before bed after a night of mephedrone seems to help the next day quite a bit. Fruit (especially bananas), oatmeal, ramen noodles, gatorade are all good. The saltiness of ramen noodles can actually be enjoyable, although food in general is unappealing after rolling.

				I did some 4-MMC over the weekend.<br /><br />It actually treated me pretty well. The key, I think, is never to re-dose. <br /><br />I only needed a single line of 200-250mg, which took me happily through 3 hours. My heart rate remained only slightly elevated throughout.<br /><br />The euphoria / energy / confidence effect was, to be honest, first rate. Very much like MDMA-lite, less of an overwhelming experience. Much less of an urge to hug people, but still very sociable.<br /><br />Alcohol helped the comedown, which - this time - was not very severe. I was able to sleep (in some capacity) about 1 1/2 hours after the effects had worn off.<br /><br />One weird thing - on the day after, when trying to sleep, I was hearing voices in my head - you could almost class it as auditory hallucinations. However, I didn&#039;t get into a very bad state, and drifted off to sleep. The next day, completely back to normal.<br /><br />This chemical has huge potential for abuse and manifests itself in different ways for different people. I personally find it worthwhile, but think 2 uses per month should be the absolute limit. Be careful.

				I have a feeling the Mephedrone isn&#039;t as pure as it could be, pure 4-MMC should treat you better, it&#039;s fiendish still but side effects should be minimal. Maybe the product needs to me tested, how idk.

				I got 4-MMC from edgarnumbers and another source not on SR and never had a real bad come down or bad fiending compared to Meth/Coke/H but it is hard to compare when I would be doing some hardcore binges while only using a gram of 4-MMC over a few days. <br /><br />The only thing about edgarnumbers 4-MMC that i noticed is that my back hurt a bit it was kinda felt like my kidneys actually hurt not sure which but I noticed only slight muscle pain with the other 4-MMC supplier which would be the case with any stimulant.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />I was never really zapped like I have felt after doing E sometimes.<br /><br />

				Ahh, ok. Good to hear all of your responses. It&#039;s been over three weeks now and while I can say I have recovered, I feel scarred in a way. Traumatized maybe. It&#039;s definitely the most wrong feeling I&#039;ve ever had from any substance. And the fact that my actual heart rate, which is usually extremely low to the point of bradychardia, for almost two weeks after felt like it was pounding out of my chest even when at rest, it&#039;s just scary. Blows my mind that it was so popular in the UK, that was my reasoning in trying it. I had read that it was the 4th most popularly used drug in the UK, next to coke, mdma, and something else.&nbsp; That scene must have been rocked by this stuff. <br /><br />I have tried Methylone, also from edgarnumbers, and I thought it was great. Felt a little loopy the next day, but a couple days later it would like it never happened. In any case, done with research chemicals. I don&#039;t like being a lab rat.

				Ive easily done over 100g of mephedrone in my time.<br /><br />The pre-ban China powder had little to no negative effects at all... If it did it was very temporary and wore off within a couple days. Nothing worst than any other stimulant though.<br />The new crystal stuff that is coming out of India is pretty toxic and impure. I don&#039;t think its the mephedrone itself that is causing these effects in people but the impurities. I don&#039;t think it is washed well and still contains many chemicals used for production. I noticed weird neurological things that lasted days to a week after use. These too wore off though. The main concern is the vasoconstriction while you are on it. If it gets too bad it can cause necrosis. Pretty scary shit.<br /><br />Enelysion over at OVDB has a grip of the pre-ban China stuff. If you want to do it still, I would suggest getting it from him.<br /><br />The high is just fucking amazing though... NOTHING feels that good. Blows MDMA out of the water for me.

				I was talking solely about 4-MMC. I first sourced it 4 years ago from Israel and then China.<br /><br />The negative effects some felt are well documented on various forums.&nbsp; No comedown the first couple of times for some users, but for many the comedowns got worse and worse to the point where it wasn&#039;t worth it.&nbsp; That is another reason to suspect toxicity.<br /><br />The real and perceived legality in some countries and the massive shortage of quality MDMA were the main reasons it took off so quickly IMO.<br /><br />

				no doubt they were very big factors, in fact during those years it seemed real mdma may have never been coming back, so people quickly latched onto 4-mmc, personally though i loved it as its own drug and as for comedowns ive pretty much never had any off it, and ive done a lot including one 4 day long 6+ gram session, i wont lie i felt a bit off for a few days after that one but nothing too bad at all, just a little lethargic, that said i dont seem to get much of a comedown off anything really, booze will ruin my day after but other than that even half a g of top shelf molly in a night and i can still spring out of bed fresh as a daisy next morn, maybe im just some sort of genetic freak! <br /><br />another reason it got big was the availability and price you could have the purest crystals at your door next day for under £10 a gram and at the potency i was getting that is some serious value for money. and im not saying it wasnt without its side effects, i read many a horror story about it, people with purple knees from the vastroconstriction etc, but i was bashing the stuff since before it was common knowledge right up until the ban when the good stuff disappeared and neither me or any of my friends had any problems<br /><br />and i just have to add, all through my youth id seen people on tv and the like be blown away after taking a line of coke, but when i finally did it my reaction was &quot;is that it? thats what all the fuss is about?&quot; with 4-mmc it was more like what i expected from the coke &quot;holy fuck! fuck me! thats amazing!&quot;
