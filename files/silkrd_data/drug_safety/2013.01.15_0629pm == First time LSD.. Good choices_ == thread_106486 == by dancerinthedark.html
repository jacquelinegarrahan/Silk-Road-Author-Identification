				I always emphasize the importance of research before trying a new drug. https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd.shtml is your friend. Read a lot, especially trip reports.<br /><br />I was quite cocky my first time, even though I had done my research. I figured having tons of mushroom trips under my belt had prepared me. I took ~500Âµg. This trip was unlike anything I had ever experienced. The intense energy that built up within me was quite frightening. I also experienced the dreaded thought loops.<br /><br />I would say start small at maybe a half a hit, get a feel for the drug and try more later on. This is the safest route.<br /><br />As for vendors, check out this thread from the lsd Avengers. It was extremely helpful for my first purchase. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />Happy Trails!

				I took acid for the first time a month ago.&nbsp; A friend got it for me and I am pretty sure I took ~200ug.&nbsp; I have taken shrooms about 5 times so I had experienced a trip before.<br /><br />I am glad I took both hits.&nbsp; The visuals were very intense and I tripped alone in my apartment.&nbsp; I did black out for a while, or I just lost track of time because I checked the clock and 4 hours had disappeared. <br /><br />I would suggest getting a music playlist together before you trip.&nbsp; I found it difficult to try to pick songs once I was already tripping.&nbsp; I ended up listening to the same album over and over.<br /><br />Visually things were crazy but I had the mindset from the beginning that what I was seeing wasn&#039;t real and it was supposed to happen.&nbsp; I had a great time I hope you do to.

Hope i never pass out. i might drown! 4 hours disappearing is crazy. never happened to me on psychedelics. Time usually slows down like hell for me. I look at the clock lets say its 13:40. and i go mess around&nbsp; yknow. look at it again what i think is an hour later and its like 13:45!&nbsp; an hour passes in 5 minutes...<br /><br />for the op: <br />i suggest you get a few hits, take one to try it out then a week or two later you can double your dose.<br />Take it early if you want to sleep at night. Since you have tripped on mushrooms i will not give you the set and setting/ go with the flow kinda lecture. <br />Buy from star vendors.

				I took shrooms a bunch before I took my first LSD trip, and I would say the shroom trips only partly prepared me for LSD.&nbsp; For me, I describe shroom trips as fun and crazy, but LSD trips are deep and intense.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am torn as to the advice to give you.&nbsp; My rational part is saying only take 1 hit (I consider 1 hit a standard baseline dose, no matter the actual ug dosage--some prints require 3 hits, other require half a hit).&nbsp; This will potentially disappoint you, but will most likely not result in an experience that is too intense to be enjoyed.&nbsp; My gut, though, is saying you should take 3 hits.&nbsp; This will definitely show you what LSD is all about, and there is a very real chance that it will be so intense that it&#039;s overwhelming.&nbsp; Assuming you are a mentally-healthy individual, there is no documented medical risk to massively overdosing on LSD.&nbsp; The only risk is of having a negative trip, which can be mitigated by preparing set and setting.&nbsp; The choice is really up to you--do you feel that you are well enough prepared to enjoy an overwhelmingly intense experience that you have never gone through before?&nbsp; <br /><br />I personally took (what I now know was) a fairly large dose, 250ug.&nbsp; (We at least confirmed that each hit contained 250ug of the source crystals, but not the quality of the crystal--I&#039;ve never seen crystals since then and I really don&#039;t know how one would verify the quality of the crystals...anyway...)&nbsp; I was blown away but in a good way.&nbsp; Set and setting were optimal and I had a great, albeit overwhelming, time and fell in love with LSD.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had many trips since...I&#039;ve lost count ;-)<br /><br />As for sourcing, blerbadoo said it--check out the LSD Avengers thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s the name of the group that took it upon themselves to centrally verify LSD sources and batches on SR.&nbsp; In the early days here, LSD was in relatively short supply, a ridiculous amount of vendors were cropping up and advertising &quot;STRONG 300+ug LSD&quot; which was in fact blotters laid with other RCs.&nbsp; Other vendors would selectively scam or switch from selling legit LSD to RCs on the same prints.&nbsp; So the LSD market on here was extremely ugly and difficult to work with, and too many new members were falling victim.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now though, thanks to the LSD Avengers and other helpful forum members, there is enough collective feedback that it&#039;s not hard at all for a new member on the forums to find a reliable LSD source.&nbsp; There are a good number of established reliable vendors now, so scammers are much less common, and much easier to differentiate from the reliable vendors.&nbsp; Also, new vendors are usually blacklisted immediately and made to (well asked to, unofficially) supply samples to the LSD avengers so that they can non-blacklist the new vendor, and give the vendor an opportunity to gain a customer base.<br /><br />so in general, when you are looking for a vendor, look for one that has been around for a good amount of time (&gt;1 year preferably), has good feedback, and preferably a vendor that has a following on the forum.&nbsp; I personally buy from 3Jane, as she is well established, friendly and respectful, and generally honest about her product.&nbsp; But check out the avengers thread to stay current<br /><br />Enjoy!!&nbsp; I think you&#039;ll have a great time if you&#039;re in the right place!

				Assuming you&#039;re in a good set and setting :<br /><br />100ug is a good starting dosage<br /><br />If you&#039;re comfortable at this dosage, i&#039;d wait a week, and then try 150-200ug. <br /><br />200 to 400ug is the perfect dosage for most experienced LSD users. <br /><br />A sitter is always advisable of course. <br /><br />I recommend the vendors 3jane and vitacat. :)<br />
