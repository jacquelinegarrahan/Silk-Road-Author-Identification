				Hi there I am looking for some advice on what kind of Steroids I should buy to help get me back into shape. Obviously I know working out and being on a diet are the best things for you yes yes. I have a good personal friend who used Steroids back in the day but no longer does and he cannot get them anymore but he still looks great. Myself I am 6&#039;4 and maybe 320. Definitely have a gut and probably high body fat %. I recently got a house with more room than what I had and I am going to buy a personal gym to start working out routinely. I want to lose weight and also gain muscle I just don&#039;t know what steroids are what and what do what and which ones i should combine. Any help is much appreciated ;D

				If you don&#039;t get any feedback here, you might be able to find some advice from someone at -- forum.bodybuilding.com.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think there&#039;s quite a few of &#039;em that are silent SR customers.. I&#039;d be interested to see what they&#039;re following as well if you end up finding good advice.&nbsp;

				I know people hate hearing a response like this, especially at a place like this.<br /><br />To be frankly honest, until you max out your natural potential or at least plateau, you really aren&#039;t ready for Anabolics.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done multiple cycles and had to work 2-3x harder while on cycle. Your best bet at the moment is diet first, train hard, and cardio. <br /><br />However, I assume you&#039;ll heed my advice as much as I heeded the same advice when I received it.<br /><br />If you want to be safe and gain some good mass. A good beginner cycle is Testosterone Enanthate 400mg/week, 2 injections a week (Mon/Thurs) 200/mg per shot. (15 weeks max)<br /><br />Always have PCT and ancillaries on hand. PCT usually begins 2 weeks after your last injection. Clomid (50mg a day) and Nolvadex (20mg a day) for 4 weeks. <br /><br />As for ancillaries it is wise to keep a decent anti-estrongen on hand like Aromasin or Arimidex if you have any gyno flare up.
