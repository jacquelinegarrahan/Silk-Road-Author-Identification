				Lately I have been creating vials of H by disolving the powder or tar into Bacteriostatic Water and then using a 25mm diameter, 0.2um Whatman Micron Filter to filter out everything. This is much more clean than just sucking up the liquified H from a cotton ball as the Micron Filters are the best way to get the cleanest shot you can get (you might lose a little bit of H in the process (as I tend to heat up the bateriostatic water so the tar disolves faster, but after rereading the guide for this apparently heating is a bad idea). I found a good guide on drugs-forum.com (hence in the quote the use of &quot;swim&quot; and&quot;swiy&quot;) about the process if anyone is interested, I&#039;m not sure if we are allowed to post links to outside sites so I will just copy the guy&#039;s guide if anyone is interested (I will post it at the end).<br /><br />Anyways the main reason I made this topic is that each time I make a vial there is always a little bit left over that I can&#039;t get with the syringe because it&#039;s too low (even when the vial is upside down like it should be). so I was wondering if there was anyway I could open it so I can get the rest of the liquid out? Any experience or ideas? I don&#039;t really need to reuse the vial (as that would proably not be too safe, so I&#039;m not too worried about breaking it, but I just don&#039;t want to lose that little bit because it adds up after you make 3 or 4 vials of 1-2+ grams each. <br /><br />Anyways thats the end of my questions and explanation of why I need to know. <br /><br />If anyone else is interested in pre-making their H or pills ready for shooting and put in in an IV follow this guide, as it worked great for me (I&#039;ve done it 4 times). It takes a little practice, but I am getting better at it each time I do it. Keep in mind I DID NOT write this, I am just passing along some info that others might want to try if they want to be as safe as possible.<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Micron Filtering Guide to create vials of heroin (or water soluble pills) to IV:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well after looking around a little on this forum, I seems that there is little information about syringe micron filters. With the permission of Captain Heroin, I present to you the Syringe micron filter FAQ. The original FAQ contains pictures but I could not post pictures until I get 50 posts.<br /><br />Micron Filtering FAQ<br />by Captain Heroin<br /><br />What is micron filtering?<br /><br />The micron filter is utilized to ensure sterility and safety of intravenous drug use. For many pharmaceutical tablets which are desirable for injection depending on the individual (Ritalin, OxyContin, Roxicodone, Dilaudid, Morphine Sulfate, Suboxone, Subutex, Dormicum, etc), the use of a micron filter is necessary to remove unwanted inactive ingredients. Some inactive ingredients like talc (for example, which is present in Ritalin and OxyContin, among many other pills) are best kept out of IV solutions, due to the fact that it ends up in swim&#039;s lung eventually.<br /><br />Over time, if swiy continues to inject pills, it is better to micron filter, so as to avoid the build up of tablets&#039; inactive ingredients into swiy&#039;s body.<br /><br />Why micron filter?<br /><br />There are several case studies of such individuals, who received medical attention due to injecting binders/filler. one example involves a successful lung transplant due to talcosis of the lung. The patient acquired talcosis of the lung because they injected enough talc within Ritalin tablets.<br /><br />What will swiy need?<br /><br />1) Whatman Sterile 0.2 Âµm PVDF Micron Filter. There are many others that will work and that are cheaper but whatman are highly regarded.<br /><br />2) Luer Lock Needle Tip<br />Any gauge will do<br /><br />3) Luer Lock Syringe<br />(Size varies on how much solution swiy is preparing at once)<br /><br />4) Bacteriostatic Water; 0.9% benzyl alcohol<br />(Solutions that are going to be used within a day or so don&#039;t necessarily need a preservative, but for the most part, any solution that swiy is planning on using for a week or two should have a preservative such as benzyl alcohol).<br /><br />WARNING : Do NOT inject bacteriostatic water by itself. Intravenous injection of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection without a solute may result in hemolysis. You can read up on hemolysis.<br /><br /><br />5) Rubbing alcohol pads.<br />(To sterilize the surface of pre-sealed vials)<br /><br />6) Vial for storing swiy&#039;s newly created solution. For this tutorial, swiy&#039;s going to use a pre-sealed vial, such as the one that the bacteriostatic water is being stored in (pictured below; so you can see the rubber stopper). Swiy can also use a media bottle for this purpose though using a vial is a lot more convenient. If swiy do not want to use a bacteriostatic water bottle, or cannot (one doesn&#039;t need to use all 30mL to open one up), then swiy will also need an extra pre-sealed glass vial (clear or amber).<br /><br />7) Pills/Drugs. Obviously, last but not least, swiy will need your own pills/drugs to micron filter. Bacteriostatic water is not safe to inject by itself. Feel free to choose any pills/drugs swiy like to micron filter.<br /><br />How does swiy Micron Filter? - The Procedure<br /><br />1) Remove luer lock syringe from packaging. Pull the plunger back. Insert pills. Replace the plunger.<br /><br />2) Sterilize the stopper of the bacteriostatic water. Attach needle tip to the syringe, insert needle into bacteriostatic water vial. Draw back desired volume of bacteriostatic water. Remove the needle from the vial.<br /><br />3) Replace the needle tip with a micron filter. Shake the syringe until the pills have dissolved. *<br /><br />4) Slip on a new luer lock needle tip to the end of the micron filter. Sterilize the stopper of the vial swiy wishes to store your solution in.<br /><br />5) Push the needle through the stopper of the vial and push down the plunger, slowly but surely. Be careful not to exert too much pressure.<br /><br />6) When complete, carefully remove the needle from the vial. Store the needle and syringe safely for exchange, and discard the used micron filter.<br /><br />* Depending on what pills swiy are using, swiy might want to pre-crush/split/filter them before this step.Swim must note, unless swiy is micron filtering Subutex or Suboxone, it is strongly recommended you pre-crush your pills. This method with backloading un-crushed pills will take some time for other, much smaller, harder to dissolve in water whole pills. It may take up to 15-20 minutes, or even longer. Some pills are designed this way, so to save swiy the frustration, just crush them up if you&#039;re not absolutely sure shaking them in water will help them dissolve in a few minutes. Swiy can also wait to replace the needle with the micron filter until after the pills have dissolved, but swim would be careful shaking about a large gauge needle in the air. Or, swiy can re-cap the needle with the plastic guard so as to protect the sterility of everything. These are all great ideas.<br /><br />** If swiy is using a media bottle, swiy doesn&#039;t need to waste another needle tip - just secure the micron filter over the mouth of the media bottle.<br /><br />Now that swiy has read all of this, it&#039;s likely swiy will want to repeat what swim&#039;s done here. So it naturally begs the question,<br /><br /><br />Q) Does swim need bacteriostatic water?<br />A) If swiy plans on creating a solution for more than one shot, then yes. If swiy is just preparing a single shot with a micron filter, there&#039;s no need for it. Sterile water (bacteriostatic water is sterile as well, it just has 0.9% benzyl alcohol to maintain sterility over time, as a preservative) by itself is just fine for a single shot. Keep in mind swim has used tap water for IVing for over a whole year and swim has also used a lot of the 5mL tubes of &quot;sterile water&quot; they hand out at the needle exchange swim goes to. They expired in October of 2005. The liquid would be stored for up to two days outside of its original container before swim injected it. So overall, it&#039;s hard to say whether one &quot;needs&quot; bacteriostatic water. But why risk it, and end up having an infection because bacteria grew in swiy&#039;s non-bacteriostatic solution?<br /><br />Q) What do you mean 0.2? What&#039;s PVDF? What does 25mm mean?<br />A) Whatman is the manufacturer of the micron filters swim uses. People use others, different brands of micron filters, but the positive reviews swim has read about Whatman brand micron filters led swim to acquiring these. 0.2 Âµm refers to the pore size of the filter. It&#039;s one of the smallest sizes of micron filters that are out there (the smallest I&#039;ve seen is 0.1 Âµm). 0.2 Âµm micron filters are necessary to remove harmful inactive ingredients in pills, like talc (for example) or microcrystalline cellulose. PVDF is a type of filter media, which is good for oil based and water based solutions. Nylon filters are ideal for oil based solutions only, and PES filters are ideal for water based solutions only. Swim determined that PVDF filters are ideal for intravenous drug use. You can read more about filter types. 25mm refers to the size of the filter (how much surface area the solution has to pass through). Ideally, the larger the surface area, the quicker filtration. However, Whatman brand filters have pre-filters built into them, so that 25mm is large enough for most purposes. Other filters which are larger may not be as high quality or filter the solution as effectively due to a lack of a built in pre-filter.<br /><br />Q) How many times can swim use a single micron filter?<br />A) Once, ideally. They are guaranteed sterile, but once swiy has used them, they are no longer sterile. As time goes on, bacteria can build up inside micron filters. So, swiy should create a bulk quantity of solution with a single micron filter. This is the safest way to utilize micron filters. The liquid inside of the filter can be building bacteria as time goes on, and swiy wouldn&#039;t know this. There&#039;s liquid that&#039;s already passed through the filter. So yes, a micron filter would filter out bacteria, but swiy can&#039;t ensure there isn&#039;t bacteria that&#039;s growing on the other side of the filter. This is the problem with letting a micron filter sit around for another use - this is an inherently bad idea. Only use your microns once. Prepare more solution if swiy is going through them quicker than swiy expected.<br /><br />Q) What can get through a micron filter? What does a micron filter out?<br />A) You&#039;ll need to do your research. What we know is that talc, microcrystalline cellulose, fungal spores, most bacteria, and many inactive ingredients in pills are filtered out with a micron filter. Viruses are too small to be filtered out with a micron filter, unfortunately. This means swiy cannot use micron filters to remove viruses from an IV solution (let&#039;s say someone made a huge dope shot, only need 1/2 of it. If swiy knows they have Hepatitis or HIV, swiy cannot use a micron filter to make that other half of the dope shot safe for swiy to use, unless swiy is going to risk exposing him/herself to the virus). I wanted to make this perfectly clear for anyone who might inquire about this in the future.<br /><br />Q) Is micron filtering the only precaution that swiy needs to take?<br /><br />A) No, many pills today have all kinds of ingredients like waxes and others to prevent abuse. Swiy should do their research on a pill they wish to inject. For most pills and street drugs, it is recomended to not heat the solution because this allows waxes and other inert ingredients to pass through a micron filter.<br /><br />Q) Can swim make a heroin solution?<br /><br />A) Yes and no. A solution can be made but heroin in solution degrades to 06-MAM. Concrete numbers about how long this takes don&#039;t exist to my knowledge, but it is recommended not to keep heroin in solution for longer than a day or two with out significant degradation.<br /><br />Q) Where can swim purchase this equipment?<br /><br />A) More than likely swiy won&#039;t have access to this equipment but swiy shouldn&#039;t have to much trouble finding these things online with the help google.<br /><br /><br />This concludes Captain Heroin&#039;s Micron Filter FAQ. I will continue to add to this if there is other information I feel should be added. Feel free add anything to this that you feel may be help. If people are going to take risks they should do all they can to minimize them.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The metal (aluminum, I think) seal at the top isn&#039;t thick.&nbsp; You can use scissors or a screwdriver or whatever to tear through it and get it off.<br /><br />You could also inject some more bacteriostatic water and just get a diluted solution of whatever is left in the vial.<br /><br />All of this said, if you practice you should be able to get 99% of the liquid out of that vial by holding the syringe so that the needle is just barely in the vial.<br /><br />whatever you do, good luck.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you&#039;re filtering like you should.&nbsp; That cotton ball nonsense is crap.

				Thanks I eventually got it. That aluminum isn&#039;t thick at all!&nbsp; Anyways, Micron filters is better than cotton balls almost any day. The only time I don&#039;t use a MF is when I only have less than .5 grams of tar, if I have more than that, bring it on. If anyone isn&#039;t using MFs and using the cotton ball method should realy give this a try. Not only is it cleaner, but you don&#039;t have to get your dose ready in the morning when you are sick, just fill up your syringe!
