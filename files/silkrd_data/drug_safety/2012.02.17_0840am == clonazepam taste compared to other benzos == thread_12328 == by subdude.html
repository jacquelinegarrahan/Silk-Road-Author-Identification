				I believe this belongs here. Does anyone care to comment on the taste of clonazepam vs valium vs estazolam...etc? In my opinion just for starters clonazepam has a sweet to slightly mintysweet taste.&nbsp; <br /><br />For pill identification help.

				It&#039;s a sweat, chalky kind of taste. IIRC, they are supposed to be active sublingually, so perhaps they are all manufactured with this in mind, hence the sweet taste? I think the company that makes actual brand name Klonopin also makes candy or something, but I don&#039;t know how that affects the generic stuff which also happens to have a sweatish taste.<br /><br />I also put them under my tongue first like the post above suggests, then swallow the rest when it gets annoying.

I also put the regular pills under my tounge because I think they kick in a little faster.
