				Title: <strong>Laying Blotters?</strong><br />

				Ok, so I should be getting some 25c nBOME powder soon. However I do not have a scale that is accurate to the miligram (mine only goers to .01 grams) which works for 2c-x chems like im used to.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing, I&#039;ve been looking around and heard many things, so I figured I would just ask here to get some straight answers.<br /><br />First, were to get the blotters, I&#039;ve heard #14 watercolor paper (though that seems off), been told to avoid clay coated papers or anything that is treated with chlorine or contains lignine. I was told ink blotters would do, but I&#039;m still doubtful. The issue is that this stuff is only active buccally, so I cant just inject 1mg of it into a gummy bear or something of that nature, it has to be absorbant, but able to allow the chemical to transfer to the gums.<br /><br />I considered just buying some &quot;blotter art&quot; from shakedowngallery, but I&#039;ve been told that modern blotters sold as art are treated either with chemicals that may hurt RCs/LSD or are coated.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been told this is on purpose and by others that it&#039;s done purely because the sellers don&#039;t care.<br /><br />When it comes to dosing I plan on doing them individually as needed, a mixture of 50/50 ethyl alcohol and distilled water mixed with the 25c NBOME directly onto the blotter via pipette. Would this be a way to go (obviously I&#039;ll figure out how much one blotter holds max and go under that (maybe half) before hand as not to flood them)<br /><br />In short, were can I get the right blotters (preferably not online) and what is the best way to lay them (BTW, if it helps I&#039;ll only have enough to lay around 50 blotters (for now))?<br />How did they get acid blotters in the old days?

				You can buy blotter art online, do a google search or look on ebay, it is already perforated. Do a test and find how much liquid each sheet of paper can hold, then knowing that mix in a solution of your 25c with however how much a sheet can hold, put the sheet in a flat dish and pour in the solution. Pretty sure there is a more detailed explanation on the shroomery.

				I&#039;ve been told that a lot of blotters sold as art are treated and may not work as actual blotters.

				key-z is good, and shakedown produces fine blotter paper too.<br /><br />That said, you CAN just go to your local store and get a cheap watercolor book. It will work exactly the same way and is absolutely fine. <br /><br />Best way to lay blotter is to get a casserole or brownie pan, and lay your blotter paper in it. Pour the smallest possible volume of liquid into it (so it evaporates quickly), and wait for it to dry. Done! The hardest part is in doing the math to know how much you want your dosing to be.<br /><br />Remember you need to add HPBCD to your nbome to increase solubility through the gumline.

As long as it&#039;s not freebase.<br /><br />Also no offense meant but I feel your logic is flawed. <br /><br />You want to do a trial run and see how much exactly your blotter sheet will absorb. You then want to record this number, mix in your active dose you want on each blotter, multiplied by 100 (assuming 100 sheet), or f(x) with x being the number of hits, so the function would look like f(x) = 9E-3(x) ug<br /><br />Once you do this, lay a sheet in a brownie pan or something similar. Ideally it should be the same dimensions as the paper, if it is bigger, you will need more solution. If the paper is fully saturated in liquid, with remains liquid left, submerge it, let it soak for a few seconds to a minute (again take note on the trial how long it takes to fully absorb).<br /><br />Since your liquid is at a certain ratio, the dosing will remain constant. Pull the sheet out promptly. You don&#039;t want to let the residual evaporate in the pan with the other liquid, as this could cause the dosing to go haywire as the other liquid dried (the excess) near / along side / on top of it. Save the excess, and move the blotter to another pan to dry. You could hang it, but this often put some more weight on the bottom doses.<br /><br />That&#039;s pretty much it.<br /><br />Make sure your math is accurate, I did this quickly for example. DOUBLE and TRIPLE check your calculations.<br /><br />Peace and love

				Make a nasal spray.&nbsp; It gives a much smoother high than blotter. There are instructions posted in this forum - do a search.
