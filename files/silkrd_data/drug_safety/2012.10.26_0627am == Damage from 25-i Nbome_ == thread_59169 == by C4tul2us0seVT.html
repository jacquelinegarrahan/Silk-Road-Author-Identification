				Hello Roaders!<br /><br />I have been looking for a psychedelic to try but recently I&#039;ve been having a hard time with that. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had Salvia and loved it, but want a pill instead of having to smoke it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had mescaline and loved it, but same problem as the Salvia.<br /><br />I bought some blotters of 25-i Nbome and took one for the first time last week. It was awful. I felt nauseous and paranoid the whole time and went in and out of extreme hot/cold flashes. I also felt itchy and had watery eyes as well (like an allergic reaction) and had to take Benadryl to fall asleep since my heart rate was also way too fast.<br /><br />I tried again with only half a blotter 8 days later and it was WAY worse. I had no visuals at all, projectile vomited and still had all the bad symptoms but with no trip whatsoever and included with the nausea I felt like I was having a nosebleed but instead of my nose it was inside my skull but there was nowhere for the blood to drain. Maybe aneurysm/hemorrhaging? <br /><br />Either way it was a bad experience for my mind and body even though I was in a good setting and pleasant state of mind both times. Should I be worried? Would another chemical compound be safer or same damage, different experience? Should I mix it with MDMA or a prescription like Adderall? I really want to find something that will mellow/numb me out (like a prescription? as weed makes me paranoid for weeks) with some cool hallucinations and the euphoria feeling would be a super bonus.<br /><br />Thank you all!

Don&#039;t mix it with things!<br /><br />Try some 4-AcO-DMT or 4-AcO-DET, or shrooms, 4-HO-DIPT, or maybe even 2C-B. Those are all much easier on the body and heart.

				25i is a research chemical that can react in many different ways. I tried 2mg, and it was just horrible for me... I mean, I loved the effects, but the body load, locked jaw, and chest pains were just so severe. I don&#039;t like it.

If you don&#039;t know a drug you don&#039;t start with higher doses the first time you use them, it&#039;s basic harm reduction knowledge.

				If I were you I would avoid the nbomes from now on. It sounds like you didn&#039;t react well to them and since they&#039;re only research chemicals, not much is known about them. Sounds like LSD is right up your alley. Although make sure you&#039;re buying it from a trusted vendor since some jackasses try to pass off nbome as acid since they can both come on blotter paper.<br /><br />I also stay away from nbomes myself. I&#039;ve had my own bad experience on it and have heard too many horror stories. Plus they give me this strange sort of &quot;toxic&quot; feeling when I used to take them.<br />

				Is there any data coming in on whether there is a LD50 for the NBOMes?<br /><br />Erowid lists 25-50mg of 2C-B, 20-30mg of 2C-I, and 1.5mg of 25I (aka 2C-I-NBOMe) as &quot;strong&quot; (as in there&#039;s nothing above that) *oral* doses.&nbsp; Also has a warning up that 25I is now possibly being passed off as 2C-I.&nbsp; Seems like mixing these guys up could be pretty dangerous.<br /><br />We&#039;re actually really curious as to the sudden surge in RC interest.&nbsp; Is it that people are actually bored with acid, mushrooms, and/or cactus and dmt?&nbsp; Are they not available in their area (although it seems like ordering mescaline-containing cacti would always be an option)?&nbsp; Simple curiosity?

				My question is, are you sure it was 25i-NBOMe? Did you get it from a trusted source?<br /><br />There is also the possibility that someone made a mistake at some point, and the potency was far too strong, or that it was the wrong chemical entirely.<br /><br />You should try to order say 10 more tabs of 25i from a very reputable dealer, and try say half of one to start off with, if you still have a bad reaction, I would say you might have some allergy or hypersensitivity, and you should steer away from such chemicals.

				some people react poorly to nbome - imo you should avoid it from now on and just go for lsd from a reputable vendor which has a proven safety record and most people tolerate very well<br /><br />its not likely to pass off something else as nbome - given that nbome is not generally in that high of demand nor does it go for a very high price, one is much more likely to attempt to buy lsd and get nbome for example. this is why reagent test is very smart<br /><br />also i dont understand why you said you tried mescaline but it had the same problem as salvia which you didnt want to have to smoke ?<br />it is extremely rare to smoke mescaline which is almost always taken orally - in fairly high doses compared to most psychedelics, so it seems it was not likely to be mescaline if you smoked it ??? <br /><br />

				I seriously do not recommend 25i-nbome I have had 3 seizures from this drug and many experiences (im a bit of a nutter) i&nbsp; would say out of 7 experiences 2 have been good and two have ended with me on the floor having a fit for around an hour at a time. I Overdosed from 25i on saturday from 2 tabs and i can honestly say its the worst experience of my life. I was paranoid, scared, sick, chest pains, didnt know what was happening, i had a seizure which lasted over 35 minutes. Honestly i have tried the 25i-nbome and 25c-nbome chemicals a few times and do have some experience with them. Hope my message can help you out :) if you have any questions feel free to message me and i will get back to you as soon as possible :). <br /><br />If you do decide to take Nbome enjoy :) i know it can be an amazing trip however in small doses, i find the larger the dose the more uncomfortable and worrying it gets. <br /><br />CJ

				I took 25i nbome once and found it average at best, yes the visuals were insane but the nausea was&nbsp; bad.. After taking this as my first ever RC in many years of using recreational drugs ive decided not to bother with RC&#039;s and stick to the old favourites...&nbsp; &nbsp; I took 2 x 550ug blotters on my gum and it burns like hell.

				Thank you so much everybody. I got the blotters of 25i nbomes from HardHustle and he&#039;s got great ratings. I want to try mushrooms, LSD and some straight mescaline but everything I see on the road is sold in bulk and I don&#039;t know anyone to give my extras to, and I&#039;m not made of money either. If anyone could give me ideas on what to take for a psychedelic, euphoric, mellow experience let me know! Prescription ideas are welcome as well (and if you&#039;re a vendor and want to help me with a custom order I would be most appreciative since I really don&#039;t want to buy in bulk).

				I&#039;m a big fan of 2-CB!<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty widely available on the road in personal use quantities (100mg/250mg) and is relatively inexpensive. Doses range from 10-20mg, but the experience ramps up considerably once you pass 20mg, so I would recommend pre-dosed caps or pills to be on the safe side.<br /><br />I like the visuals, and it has pretty amazing synergy with both mdma and cannabis. It is a bit vanilla in that you won&#039;t necessarily work through mental / body issues in the same way as one might with acid or mushrooms. Its more of a pure recreation / fun type thing. <br /><br />This is personal preference though, I&#039;ve got what I needed from LSD, and mushrooms are still really fun.<br />As I&#039;m sure you know, a trip to Erowid to read up on all of this is pretty much mandatory.<br /><br />Good luck with your experiments, and stay safe!<br />&nbsp;

				Yeah I do agree everyone should take it easy on the NBOMes. Honestly I love the stuff. I&#039;ve been using NBOMe&#039;s for over a year now and I just love it.
