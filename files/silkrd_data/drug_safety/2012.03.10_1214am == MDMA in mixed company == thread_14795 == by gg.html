				I&#039;m not a very experienced roller, to start. The first time that I took MDMA I rolled pretty hard. While it was a great eye opening experience, I&#039;m not sure that I want to repeat it at the same intensity. I&#039;m going to take MDMA in mixed company with some close friends and acquaintances. What dose would be decent to take to be able to enjoy the party, yet not make a fool of myself?<br /><br />I read a few erowid experience stories, and it seems that the unintended emotional bonding of ecstasy starts at 90-100 mg. I was planning on taking 80-85 mg. <br /><br /><br />Here are some examples of what I mean:<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=8022 <br />Weight: 150lbs Dose: 85 mg<br />&quot;There was only a very minor increase in pulse and no measurable increase in body temp. I felt unusually sociable and had an urge to communicate and express myself, but again, the effect wasn&#039;t overpowering--just a modest modification of normal behavior. &quot;<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=9114<br />Dose: 85 mg<br />&quot;But...and this is the real meat of it...from this trip I think I finally have a good grasp of the drug&#039;s psychological effects. At first I thought of it as removing your fears, but that&#039;s not quite it: The sense of self preservation is still perfectly intact. Now, I would rather confidently describe the effect as a disabling of ego-defense mechanisms. On MDMA I was very open about the things that I really wanted to talk about but was afraid to share, while still having no trouble holding my tounge about other personal information (which fits government research that determined MDMA wasn&#039;t useful as a &#039;truth serum&#039;.)&quot;<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=2019<br />Dose: 95 mg<br />&quot;I found this experience to be very positive and enlightening. I found the empathogenic vector to be very pronounced, almost overwhelmingly so. I would be wary of being that opened up in inappropriate circumstances. Upon waking the next day, I was a little &#039;wrung out&#039;, but not to the degree I had been warned I might be.&quot;<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=18348<br />Dose: 100 mg<br />&quot;But when the effects started to wear off, things got tense between us. I began to realize I had told things that I wouldn&#039;t tell to anybody (except for my very best friend) to a stranger, and I think she also thought the same. We stopped talking, and just stared to each other. I was depressed because of the drug comedown and because I had sworn eternal love to a person that I didn&#039;t love, the intense love feeling between was nothing but an illusion created by the drug. I got up and said that it was better to go to the camping park again, and she agreed. Fortunately, on our way, she started to talk about what happened, and we both agreed that we felt nothing but a physical attraction by each other, and that we should forget that night.&quot;<br /><br /><br />However, this disproves my theory:<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=2043<br />82 mg<br />&quot;I called up my girlfriend, and I said that i would be coming over in a few minutes, she said for me to come in an hour because she had to take a shower because she was out tanning. So as that hour past, I was on top of the world just watching t.v. feeling a sense of connection with a girl every channel I turned it to. An hour past and I dropped off my friend at his house then I drove to my girlfriend&#039;s house. As soon as I arrived she was out on her porch and I ran to her and gave her the biggest hug and such a passionate kiss because I felt motivated from all the girls I fell in love with on t.v.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Any thoughts? Should I not take MDMA with people that I&#039;m semi familiar with, or take a lower dose than usual?

				When was the last time you rolled? 100mg in my opinion is what you need to roll as a rule of thumb and have quality MDMA. But the caution will be if they know you well they will know you look different and something isn&#039;t normal. So rolling and trying to hide it around them will be difficult. Especially when you start asking yourself do they know. It could be a very unpleasant roll. So just do it around those who won&#039;t mind if you are rolling and you don&#039;t mind if they know. It will make things better for everyone. Also if you get the eye wiggles around family and they don&#039;t know whats up and think your ill could you imagine the ambulance would show up pretty quick I would think.

				^^ this<br /><br />80-90 mg always falls short. <br /><br />At a family gathering last year, my brother and I shared .25 g. Completely normal interaction with grandparents, relatives etc, situation fully under control though people probably thought we were in unusually high spirits. Luckily it was a summer evening and sunglasses didn&#039;t seem too out of place&nbsp; 8)

The situation is that everyone there will be cool with drug use, and a few of us are planning to roll. I just am nervous, I usually feel this way when I haven&#039;t used a particular drug in a while and I&#039;m worried about doing something stupid.
