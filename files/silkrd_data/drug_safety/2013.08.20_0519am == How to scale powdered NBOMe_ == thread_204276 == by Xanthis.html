				A standard does of most NBOMes is 1,000Âµg, or 1mg. The most sensitive scale that can be found for less than $100 only measures down to .001 grams, or 1mg. That means if everything&#039;s properly calculated and accurate, the best I can hope for is pouring powder until it registers its minimum of 1-2mg, but when there&#039;s a chemical this active at such small doses, the difference in 1mg is significant. I could accidentally give someone nearly double doses, and that&#039;s if the scale&#039;s working properly and there&#039;s no margin of error.<br /><br />My question is, how&#039;re you supposed to deal with this, when partitioning the powder into capsules properly? Any actual microgram scale costs around ~$25,000, as it qualifies for lab equipment, and I can&#039;t think of any other practical solutions.

				Volumetric techniques based on putting the material in an amount of solvent that you can measure with higher confidence. It can also help to &quot;preload&quot; the scale with some kind of weight equivalent to about half of the scale&#039;s capacity, and to perform your measurements repeatedly. For filling capsules, you could still use volumetric but it wouldn&#039;t be that convenient, since you would have to dry out each dose individually. Microgram scales are expensive but I&#039;m not sure they&#039;re $25k expensive; you could probably find something decent for under $10k.

I have no experience with complexed but if you have HCL dissolve it in extremely carefully measured water or everclear.
