				It was weird, it seemed as if i were a toddler again or some part of having been one was unlocked, but i had alot of gas (luckily i tripped alone lol) and it as well as my body had the most peculiar odor, very thick and muted, like a toddler might smell. It took a blotter with a heart on it sublingually sometime in 2006 and two hours later the effects came on and lasted throughout the night. There werent any visuals to it, and i felt awake and full of energy but very balanced like i neither needed to do anything nor sleep (so i watched movies and wrote). I am fairly sure this wasnt lsd, but what was it?

				Sorry, i forgot to reply last month.. ha.<br /><br />Yeah, it definitely wasn&#039;t acid.&nbsp; I we were coming up in minutes and i was frying so hard i was seeing sparkles of shining light everywhere across my field of vision.&nbsp; I&#039;m still confused as to what it could have been.&nbsp; if anyone has any insight it&#039;d be much appreciated.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been puzzling over what it could have been for the last year. and seriously leery of any local acid since!

				Wow, i don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to look into that.&nbsp; No one else in the group of ~5 people that consumed it with me(none of which were well versed in psch&#039;s) experienced similar after effects.<br /><br />The cubes were wrapped in foil when we got them and it was apparent the compound was laid on the cubes in liquid form.. I don&#039;t know if that fits the profile.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do some more research.&nbsp; Thanks for the lead.

				it sure sounds like it could be a DOxx compound or something similar, bromo-d just seems so rare, DOC or DOB seems so much more likely<br /><br />i&#039;ve experienced some mild gastrointestinal complaints from DOC, not gas more like stomach growling and discomfort, but the duration and effects seems spot on. not sure about the body odor thing.<br /><br />of course this is all hypothetical conjecture, there&#039;s really no way to be sure... i&#039;d suggest reading up on psychedelics most commonly sold as L if you are really curious<br />

				It seems like I remember reading somewhere in one of the Pikhal or Tikhal books that Alexander and Ann consumed one of their psychedelics that he had synthesized and they were outside in a hot tub and were sweating profusely and that it had a very distinct odor that they were afraid that others could smell...not sure where this was in the book or which one it was even in...I had completely forgotten about it until I read this thread.

				The blotter you took was a DOx of some kind, probably DOB or DOC<br /><br />I&#039;ve had DOB twice the come up time and duration are consistent with what I&#039;ve experienced, as are the symptoms. I never noticed any body odor though <br />Although all your sense do get enhanced so I suppose due to the sweating DOB normally causes a lack of deodorant could cause you to notice that.<br />As for stomach gas I&#039;ve had that mildly before but I chalked it up to food loading while waiting for the onset, its possible yours could have been worsened by taking the blotter on an empty stomach, then not eating.<br />(I like to take it on an empty stomach so I wait for it to sink in then eat a bunch knowing I won&#039;t eat for the rest of the day)
