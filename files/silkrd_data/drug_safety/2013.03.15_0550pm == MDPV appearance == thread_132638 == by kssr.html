				What exactly does MDPV look like? Is it powdered or crystal like.<br /><br />Some scumbag locally claims he has average coke, upon inspection the coke looks very granulated, very small crystal like appearance. Doesn&#039;t resemble coke. My mate bought it, I had a little sniff, only thing that resembled coke was a stimulant feeling. Didn&#039;t taste like coke, look like coke, smell like coke and after 1 line I felt awful. But others seem to love it and buy gram after gram. Personally I wouldn&#039;t touch it (except that one line out of curiousity), as I&#039;ve sampled some proper coke off here (lloydbros,etc)<br /><br />Which dosage of MDPV is dangerous or is it likely it&#039;s not this? Was thinking maybe MDPV/lidocaine mix or is too much mdpv harmful?<br /><br />Might get some reagents.

				mmmm.. no it&#039;s probably not mdpv. Mdpv is powdery and active in small doses, a lot like 2c powders. In fact I have gotten them mixed up in the past to stressful result. On top of that I dont see using pv in coke because pv loses potency in a solution. On top of that mdpv has a longer come up then blow by a few powers.<br />Also mdpv isn&#039;t a very effective cut because contrary to popular idiom, it doesn&#039;t feel like cocaine at all.. and it lasts and lasts leaving you gacked for hours. Also, mdpv if taken as a cut by some cokehead unknowingly over the course of the night would herald in some really ugly effects that mdpv is known for if any redosing occurs. On that note, after a week or so of taking a coke mdpv medly, the user would almost certainly start presenting the paranoia and stim psychosis that irresponsible pv use inevitably ushers in. <br />It is honestly hard to say what is in the shit unless your dealer comes clean with you (hahaha).. or you test it. Where generally on the planet are you (hopefully not GB)? That also can give some insight as the global coke market has so much variance from region to region.<br /><br />Sorry if I sound disjointed, haven&#039;t had my coffee yet...

				Thanks for the reply.<br /><br />Very informative, as I know absolutely nothing about MDPV hence the questions! I have various sources selling from average to very good quality coke locally but this scumbag seems to get a lot of business, and I&#039;m 100% sure it&#039;s not coke. Yes I&#039;m in UK.<br /><br />I doubt he&#039;d say what it is, as he&#039;s getting from a different source he probably just thinks it&#039;s coke. But I don&#039;t have the heart to tell him it&#039;s not, but I&#039;d be willing to out him to his customers though. I think reagent tests could be the answer, which I&#039;m unsure? Doubt I&#039;d use coke purity or cuts test, as I&#039;m certain it&#039;s not coke in the first place to be cut with coke cuts (tongue twister there)<br /><br />Any other obvious stimulants it could be? I refuse for Â£30 per gram it even has 5% coke. I let him try LB&#039;s coke and he didn&#039;t like it because there wasn&#039;t a speedy feeling, newsflash.. most cokes quite mellow if decent purity.

				It honestly could be anything.. especially on that side of the pond. Dimethocaine, other random RCs, almost anything. It&#039;s scary that they aren&#039;t just using inert agents... How numbing is it? How is the high onset and duration, and does it seem hard on your heart? Honestly, it seems like testing is the only way to be sure. On the other hand what is the point? Rumor has it nothing over there is over 20% anyway... <br />I just wouldn&#039;t recommend anybody in GB having a coke habit.. because it&#039;s likely not a real coke habit. God knows when you&#039;re going to just up and have a fucking heart attack. I wonder if anyone more familiar with that local scene would be able to pipe in with some first hand info.

				it could be anything like sirius said!!<br /><br />could be mdpv. some ppl could just cut it to shit and sell it as coke. like they could cut it like 100 mg active per gram the rest is lidocaine and lactose and what not and the poor asswipes on the street wont notice it....<br />lots of suckers take drugs. lots of suckers sell drugs. dump that fucking contact.<br /><br />too much MDPV is really fucking harmful. You are better off with coke. thats a lot more safer. MDPV users often end up on psychiatric wards. Psychosis with it is&nbsp; very easily obtainable.&nbsp; <br /><br />my advice is : dump that shit and buy real stuff here!

				It could be either or mate.<br /><br />Maybe I should order both off of SR, 1 gram each. Then buy some of his &quot;coke&quot; to compare!

				MDPV will turn to liquid at about 200 c. in a way I&#039;ve never seen coke do.&nbsp; So maybe you use some sort of melting test, to figure it out.&nbsp; Why someone would waste good mdpv by mixing it into a poor overpriced stim like coke is beyond me.
