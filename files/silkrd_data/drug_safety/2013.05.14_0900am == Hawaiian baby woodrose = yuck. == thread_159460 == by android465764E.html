				So, against my better judgement I tried HBWR seeds last night.<br /><br />Fuck that shit. Never again. <br /><br /><br /><br />Dear LSD-25,&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m sorry. Please forgive me. I have stupid friends.<br /><br />Sincerely, me.<br /><br /><br /><br />Seriously, horrible stuff. Felt nauseated all night. Bleargh. <br /><br />

				my first trip was on hbwr seeds, and it was spectacular. to each his own i guess! nausea on psychedelics is kind of like a rite of passage. you feel so much better after purging.

				same here!! first trip was the seeds. it was amazing but I did not remove the fungus coating and it fucked up my stomach so much i couldn&#039;t hold down water for a day.&nbsp; everything made me vomit. purged every time i tried to drink. <br /><br />after that i learned to use it. tripped maybe 7-8 times with it. but that first one was the hardest.

				Yeah I didn&#039;t enjoy it at all. I just bought some because I was scared by the law at that time. Made me fairly nauseous and wasn&#039;t even a great trip. I read on some forums that it was pretty much like LSD. HAHA! Very funny. Someone who&#039;s never tried either said that I&#039;ll bet.

				HBWR seeds contain an emetic. That&#039;s a chemical that makes you to feel nauseated and vomit. It&#039;s a defense mechanism to keep you from eating the seeds (technically, so is the LSA). Supposedly the emetic is all in the shell, so if you can scrape the shell off, you&#039;ll greatly reduce the chances of nausea/vomiting, but good luck with that.<br /><br />The one time I did HBWR, I puke so hard that blood vessels burst around my eyes. The trip was decent. Not as good as a dozen other psychedelics I&#039;ve done, but not nearly as bad as some hallucinogens. The emetic is the deal breaker for me. Never did those seeds again.

				Haha oh man, yeah these things are awful. Took some with an ex once, we were both lying in bed and could barely do anything other than that!<br /><br />I didn&#039;t puke, but distinctly remember AWFUL cramps in my calves (vasoconstriction maybe?). Whenever I walked around it hurt, and we just had to lie down and wait it out. There was a general feeling of just crappiness while tripping.<br /><br />Morning glory seeds are OK. I&#039;ve done them a few times and had enjoyable experiences. You definitely get a little nausea but it&#039;s not so bad. <br /><br />I would recommend against the HWBR in general. Give morning glory seeds a try if you are that interested or desperate.
