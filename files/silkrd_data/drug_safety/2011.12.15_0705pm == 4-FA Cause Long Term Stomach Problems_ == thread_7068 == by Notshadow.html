				I&#039;ve noticed that since dosing 4-fa orally, I&#039;ve had stomach pain ever since. Like the shit ate holes in my stomach or something..It could be the binge of RC&#039;s I&#039;ve done, or a combo thereof, but I have this feeling that it is the 4-FA..Anyone else have experience with this? It effin hurts, I am used to stomach pain since &quot;Accutane&quot; fucked my systems up, but man I had to suck on a few Fentanyl patches to calm it down it was bad!<br /><br />-NS

				If you are having pain that is so severe that fentanyl was needed to relieve the intensity, you should see a doctor. Pain is very clear warning that something else is seriously wrong. <br /><br />I am no doctor, but I do know that a very important network controlling the activity of the gut called the enteric nervous system. Most people do not realize how extensive these neural pathways really are (approaching a second &quot;brain&quot;) or that they provide a vital function for the body. Ninety percent of the bodies serotonin and fifty percent dopamine is utilized within the ENS. Serotonin plays a huge role in the regulation of the ENS (unfortunately I know less about dopamine&#039;s role), for example by reducing the activity of neurons that signal pain from the abdomen to the CNS. 4-FA is a potent serotonin releasing agent, as are most of the other RCs, and compounds such as 4-chloroamphetamine have been demonstrated to potentially cause damage to neurons, although the risk for 4-FA is reduced. The actual massive release of serotonin itself has been shown to not be inherently neurotoxic, so may be induced through mutations caused by reactive oxygen radicals somehow produced through metabolism as is likely the case with MDMA. Unless your usage was just ridiculously excessive you probably should not be too concerned about the risk of long-term consequences due to neurotoxicity however. I would actually be more likely to initially hypothesize that you are suffering from a depletion of vesicular serotonin which has disinhibited these &quot;pain&quot; signals, hopefully temporarily. Potentially you may take supplemental serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and dopamine precursor tyrosine which will help promote the synthesis of these neurotransmitters. If I remember correctly, synthesis, vesicular loading, and axonal transport will take at least a few days before supplementation reaches the storage pools.<br /><br />I am curious what you meant by stomach... if the pain is fairly high in your abdomen (when laying down, above the lowest point of your ribs), you may actually have stomach ulcers due to Helicobacter Pylori, a bacterium, which was aggravated by consumption of these chemicals. It would be wise to seek a medical professional but drugs like cimetidine and omeprazole may provide relief.<br /><br />Good luck, I hope you find relief soon!

				what type of pain are we talking about?&nbsp; <br /><br />I had stomach ulcers a few years ago, i think from drug use , lots of stress, and probably a poor diet of lotsa junk food etc, and it gave me horrible stomach pains.&nbsp; I had to see a doctor for that to get a special acid reducing drug, and then radically change my diet.&nbsp; After about 6 months it was pretty much gone, and now years later i feel fine. <br /><br />please bro if your pain persists go to the hospital or emergency clinic.&nbsp; these things may not sound like much but you never know whats going on with your insides =p

				The pain has decreased since it started. Today I haven&#039;t had very much pain at all..last night I did have a little. I can hear my stomach making all kinds of noise, and a slight feeling..Doctor may be an option but it is clearing up. I am assuming I took too many RC&#039;s at once. I.E. Methylone/4-FA and could have potentially fucked up my natural balance..<br /><br />Roughly - <br /><br />200mg 4fa<br />250mg methylone<br />50mg ethylone<br />all in one night..On top of 1 drug choice a day for 3 days before that..After I reduced consumption it got better. I really honestly think I overloaded my system, or aggravated my stomach ulcers I am assuming I have from consuming Accutane (look it up, it messes alot of things up, I also have permanent back pain) but I cannot be sure. <br /><br />The pain is lower abdomen, if you were looking at a person it would be the left &quot;corner&quot; where it seems it is stemming from,&nbsp; but an overall dull pain comes in waves as well. I could very well be sick, the next couple days will determine..<br /><br />-NS

				Also, when I push/roll my stomach, the pain goes away and I can almost &quot;push&quot; air in my stomach. Very odd..

				i do 4-FA about once a week (for last few months).&nbsp; no more then 200 mg a session.&nbsp; there is definately a tummy component to it.&nbsp; i get nauseous when it kicks in and occassionally throw up while peaking (never happens on other stims).&nbsp; it&#039;s possible the seratonin release makes it ickier.&nbsp; but severe stomach cramping with opiate management?&nbsp; wow.&nbsp; maybe an impurity in ur batch or unique body chemistry?&nbsp; <br /><br />i can definately see it tho.&nbsp; i get really sick before taking it and often almost puke up the pills.&nbsp; i have to concentrate hard and not think about it as i take on.&nbsp; so there could be something going on in my stomach.&nbsp; going to be more careful for now on.<br /><br />*destiny*
