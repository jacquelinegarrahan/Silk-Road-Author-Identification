				SO my drug of choice is pills derived from Opium: Vicodin, Percocet, Oxy&#039;s, you name it.<br /><br />Now I know that once I do say 10 oxys over 10 days, the last few days don&#039;t feel as good as the first 6-7, so I take a break for several weeks, then do it again (I usually split a 30mg in two, take half, take other half 2-3 hours later and have a very fun evening that way).<br /><br />Recently though I&#039;ve had some back issues and I&#039;ve been on Vicodin for several days, and before that I&#039;ve done a round of Roxies. Now I notice that effects of those pills are very diminished and I don&#039;t want to keep wasting good pills on lame buzz.<br /><br />In the past there was a time when 1 Vicodin ES would get me buzzed out of my mind for 3 hours. Now it takes a 30mg roxy to get the same effect. Since I have this under control, I have no problems laying off the opium for a while, but I want to know how long before I&#039;m back to square one and get the same buzz from 1 Vicodin or half a roxy as I used to get 6 months ago when I first got into this :)<br /><br />Basically how long before my brain returns to normal levels?<br /><br />Thanks guys!

Withdrawal isn&#039;t fun. At all. <br /><br />The plasma elimination half life is around 3-4 hours .. if you are using any SR/XR varieties&nbsp; (eg MS Contin SR 10/30/60 etc) keep in mind you&#039;re in for a longer ride ......<br /><br />If you want to get the &quot;best buzz&quot; on these substances, try to give your body a break of at least 3 odd months- even longer works better. <br /><br />Grey<br /><br />

				My first hand experience indicate that it takes about 6 months to get near to the level of a opiate-naive... and that&#039;s suck :)<br /><br />I know that ketamine and other NMDA&nbsp; antagonist help to get low the build of the tolerance.

				O guy hit it right to the day. :)&nbsp; It seems to take about six months to pull completely out of tolerance and become an opiate virgin again.&nbsp; I used nothing for about that time period and went to the doc and got a script for TN # Codeine and popped a couple right at the pharmacy cuz my shoulder hurt like hell.&nbsp; About 30 minutes later I thought &quot;my what a nice drive home!!!!&quot;&nbsp;

				I had a drug testing, usually they never detect oxycodone with a generic &quot;Opiate&quot; test and Methadone test.<br /><br />I was shitty when the opiates test get positive! With those generic and maybe w/ MMT it can result in a positive test.<br /><br />It&#039;s ridiculous, when I need it positve for begin MMT was always negative.. so if you get tested for OC for occasional user 2-3days will be ok a generic Opiate urine test, IDK if interact with metadone but it&#039;s my only explanation for the positivity.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
