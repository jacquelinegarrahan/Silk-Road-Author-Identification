				Have done a search and read a few threads but nothing that really spoke about what the l/t effects of this drug are. <br /><br />Most threads derail into how awesome this shit is. <br /><br />If we don&#039;t know l/t effects then maybe we can readjust l/t from 10-20 years to 5-10. <br /><br />Has anyone grown a leg out of their head or had a child with no eyes? <br /><br />What the fuck is this shit gonna do to us users down the track?

				I did about 3.5+ grams of Mephedrone everyday for just over 6 months, often around the 7gram mark and occasionally I did even more. Once or twice I even snorted 1gram lines.<br /><br />Psychologically I was a mess. I suffered from extreme paranoia and constantly talked to my girlfriend about how I thought my business partners were secretly planning to fuck me over or snitch on me. I stopped trusting anyone and became really closed in and &#039;tweaky&#039;.<br /><br />My elbows and knees were almost permanently blue, and getting my penis hard took some serious effort. I was constantly sniffing and blowing my nose, and had no sense of smell whatsoever from all the snorting. My eyes always had bags under them and my skin went a very pale pallor of white.<br /><br />Every time I started going to sleep, I would hear faint electric sounds and often would get a really intense &#039;zap&#039; sound that would shoot through my head and jolt me awake. This was generally followed by sleep paralysis, where I would spend 20-30 seconds desperately trying to move my limbs before all of a sudden I&#039;d sit up with my heart beating a million miles an hour panicking. This happened literally every-time I went to sleep... Zapping sounds followed by being paralyzed.<br /><br />After about 6 months of this some serious drama happened and several of my business partners I was getting the Mephedrone with went to prison. I had a bit of a psychotic break and spent a couple of days in a mental health ward, where a really nice doctor sat me down and told me if I didn&#039;t want to kill myself or go permanently crazy I needed to take some serious steps to get off whatever I was on.<br /><br />I took a completely break from all drugs after this for 18 months, didn&#039;t even have a drink or smoke a joint, and all the sleep related problems and zapping sounds dissipated within about 6 months. My limbs stopped being blue after a few weeks and the bags under my eyes disappeared and my skin looked healthy again.<br /><br />Mentally 3.5 years on I still suffer from anxiety (which I never did before taking Mephedrone) however I don&#039;t suffer from paranoia and the anxiety is nothing like when I was caning Meph. I&#039;m generally much happier now too and my mood swings are nowhere near as severe. When I got angry on Mephedrone I&#039;d throw phones, punch holes in walls, scream, threaten and occasionally fight, now I&#039;m very chilled and even when I&#039;m extremely pissed off about something i&#039;ll just take a breather and go for a drive to think things over and calm down.<br /><br />My nose is still very fucked and my sense of smell is probably about 50% that of a normal person. Every morning I wake up and have to blow my nose alot and it just generally doesn&#039;t function very well like it used to. I also suffer from recurring vertigo which I believe was caused by doing the Mephedrone.<br /><br />Cardiac function though I&#039;m in very good condition at the moment, I work out 5 days a week, do a lot of running and my heart has been tested and functions much better than the average, with a low resting heart rate and high VO2Max.<br /><br />I just hope there&#039;s no other long term effects that pop up!

				Can&#039;t say for sure. From personal experience, I&#039;ve developed Bipolar Disorder and a slight hand tremorS from the stuff after about a year of use, and that&#039;s from using pure Mephedrone, not the bath salt crap you see on tv. I also have very bad social anxiety from this stuff and act mean IRL to compensate. Only jobs I can really work are security or truck-driving jobs, where I&#039;m left alone or telling people to fuck off. Not fun.

				Oh I read sleep paralysis, and became instantly interested. Although I don&#039;t play with this drug, I experience sleep paralysis once in a great while ONLY when awakening. I would almost feel as if I could not breathe. This is a scary thing. My neurologist said It was because I am a heavy REM sleeper, It is only because my mind awakens before my senses do. if that makes sense. Off-Topic but interesting.

				The long term side effects are pretty unknown at this point as its still considered a research chemical. I would imagine that amphetamine psychosis could be a very real possibility, as well as all the possible problems one could run into with any stimulant.<br /><br />Vasoconstriction could lead to some long term problems, heart and circulation issues and such.<br /><br />Anxiety and psychological problems are always an issue with stimulants as well.

				Back when China was still producing, was in with a group who were securing large quantities on a regular basis. Was a regular user for about a year, though probably averaged&nbsp; a gram per day as I maintained a job for most of the time. Interestingly, many of the people I associated with at this time swear off it now and think it fucked them up. I still enjoy when I can get it but don&#039;t think I could do daily again for prolonged periods.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, long term effects of using for me included increased aggression, almost complete loss of smell, a complete disregard for many aspects of my life, for example, I ended up losing my job, not that I cared cos by then all I wanted to do was binge every night and sleep all day and nearly lost my woman and kids as they all thought I was crazy. Took a few months of abstinence to sort that. Of course many of these symptoms would be associated with addiction in general. <br /><br />Otherwise, can&#039;t report any other major physical symptoms. My reading suggested long term damage to cardio-vascular system and impotence. Nose improved once I&#039;d stopped for a while though smell isn&#039;t what it was. Probably the longer lasting effect for me was drug substitution. After missing the daily rush I found myself compensating with alcohol and weed. Spent a couple of years getting pissed every day chasing that state. Finally been dealing with this for last 6 mths or so.<br /><br />Having said all of this, I&#039;d do it again as for a period there it was completely magical and did change my life, for the better, in many ways!

				Forgot to mention, for effects on long term use see &quot;Qat&quot; which is used in Yemen and Somalia. As I understand it is the natural form of cathinone in the form of a shrub which is chewed.

				you&#039;ll end up in a nuthouse before the long term effects set in. so no idea. probably heart disease, brain damage, kidney failure. etc. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176326.msg1268214#msg1268214">Quote from: Mrdobalina on June 24, 2013, 05:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176326.msg1268134#msg1268134">Quote from: DMtryptamine285 on June 24, 2013, 04:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The long term side effects are pretty unknown at this point as its still considered a research chemical.
