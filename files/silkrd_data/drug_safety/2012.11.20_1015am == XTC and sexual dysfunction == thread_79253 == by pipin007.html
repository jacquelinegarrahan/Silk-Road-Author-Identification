				Hi guys!<br />Short explanation: me and my bf love doing xtc!<br />Only problem is- he just can´t get it up! Probaply not a new topic- I read lots about it on the web!<br />Some say to try and mix it with viagra- sextacy and so on.... but for me it sounds rather dangerous...<br />Maybe some of you have any ideas or expiriences? Some ideas how to resolve that problem?<br />Its not that I need it so much or that I put pressure on him- but he just sooo much wants to- and can´t... :&#039;(

				Yeah, sure. Blowjob is the answer to your question. If you still have problems then try a different approach while doing it. Personally I&#039;m extremely horny on XTC I don&#039;t know what the problem is in his case.

				When on xtc i have the problem that i feel really horny and we can fuck for ages but i can never cum ... I think foreplay will help because touching whilst pilling is great and also we always watch porn when on xtc but we never watch porn any other time (well she doesn&#039;t lol ::) )

				Happens to my man, every, time. Cialis or tadalifil is a godsend. I think it&#039;s actually really cute, can&#039;t get it up while he&#039;s peaking unless he takes it (tadalifil last for days) but after the peak he can fuck just fine on his own. It&#039;s suuuper common and referred to as &quot;E wee&quot; I believe. There are &quot;herbal magic blue pills&quot; on ebay that are actually sidenafil, 7 bucks for 4 cheaper than anything on SR.<br />and to &quot;thecrackhead&quot; nothing wrong at all, it&#039;s harder to perform for a beautiful woman than it is to wank by yourself..&nbsp; ;)

				Sexual dysfunction is a very common problem for men on MDMA and other phenethylamines (group of chemicals that includes MDMA et. al., amphetamines, and mescaline). Remember, us guys are built a little differently for sex than females, and the purely physical aspects of it are different. X can constrict the blood flow to the penis even if he&#039;s horny, so don&#039;t assume it&#039;s you.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t use it anymore, but beans used to KILL sexual activities for me, and I&#039;m a monster in the sack (just kidding).

				I&#039;ve heard erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra can help, but they I&#039;ve taken Viagra and Cyalis and neither of them did much for me. I failed to mention that serotonergic drugs in general can cause other problems besides the blood flow to the penis thing. They do something (this is the same problem as most antidepressants) where they indirectly increase prolactin which can trigger sex hormones to act weird and this can cause sexual dysfunction. This can happen with most serotonin agonist drugs, but it is more common in long term use of many common antidepressants. In my experience, this is difficult to treat, but certain other things can help, but unfortunately they are often not safe to mix with these drugs&nbsp; (Yohimbe and Syrian Rue come to mind) and can even cause hypertensive crisis.<br /><br />Just remember there is more to sex guys than sticking your willy in her holes. Giving her oral,talking dirty, and finding if she has any eraganeous zones (some women can literally come from licking their breasts the right way, amongst other things). Be a gentleman and ask what she likes, because she might be too embarrassed to come out and say it. Unlike us where it&#039;s usually just our dicks, women are complicated and it&#039;s not always about the clit.

				If he&#039;s afraid of the side effects of boner-meds or they simply don&#039;t work for him, you can always try MDMA alternatives like 2C-B or 5-MeO-MiPT (&quot;Moxy&quot;). Unlike with MDMA, I&#039;ve never had any sexual impairment with 2C&#039;s and Moxy.

				personally I&#039;ve never seen the point of aiming for an orgasm somewhere in the middle of a two hour orgasm. It isn&#039;t 1+1=2, it is 1+1=1.1 (if achieving it is hard work, it isn&#039;t worth it).

				Sometimes it just doesn&#039;t work. <br />Only success I have had on mdma was with GHB. <br />Wouldn&#039;t suggest it though because GHB is pretty fussy and dangerous if you haven&#039;t used it before.
