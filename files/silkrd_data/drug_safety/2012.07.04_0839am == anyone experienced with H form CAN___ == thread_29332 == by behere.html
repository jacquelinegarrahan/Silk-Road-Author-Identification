				Hello SR-members,<br /><br />I´m not a newbie here - follow it since some months - but I´m not the great writer.<br /><br />I ordered #4 H from CANADA, no TAR, it is powder Heroin. I come from EU and here is almost #3 H to buy and mostly the ppl are on methadon and take #3. You must take a good 0.5g on one shot (IV), cause the H here is very low.<br /><br />Now my question:<br /><br />When I first make a shot with #4H, what dose will be a good beginner dose? I think 0.1 or so?<br /><br />I take methadon for 15 years, 16mg/day and every 3-5 days I do a shot with #3 (but I feel quite not much - a little warm rush and sometimes a bit noddy)<br /><br />Anybody experienced with CAN #4H? For HarmReduction.

				the H you have is probably about as pure as it gets. only being on 16mg of methadone a day i would recommend starting with any more than 75mg.

				OK, thank you&nbsp; for replying. I still begin very low better&nbsp; and if I feel not what I want, I can go more higher with dosis.<br /><br />Here I take 0.5g per shot and now I can get high with 10% of it?! I can´t belive, but I´ll listen to your words when I try it out.<br /><br />Only dissolve in water? No need to take ascorbin (vitamin c) and cook? Is right? <br /><br />#3 is only to dissolve with vinegar or asco.

				yeah dude that just means the product you get there is less than 20% pure.. #4 dissolves straight away into water no acids needed.

				Always start lower, man. Any time you&#039;re using a new product, you can&#039;t be sure about the purity. Much better to risk not getting high enough the first time than to risk overdosing.

				you should be pleased with how little you need to use if you ordered from one of the good vendors. #3 and #4 are very different though so dont underestimate the potency of the gear just because of your experience with the #3<br /><br />dont try to smoke the #4 just fyi. let us know how it goes.

				I got it!!!<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />I tried 40-50mg and.......my eyes are quite great and nothing - no rush, no nod, nothing!<br /><br />I´m really disappointed. Next time I shoot 100mg, but when then also nothing happens, not a little warm feeling, then I don´t need to pay 10times more than normal.<br /><br />That is not what I expected!!!<br /><br />Deliveringtime is more than great - 5 working days to western EU. Weight was on spot! Chunky offwhite stuff. Dissolves in cold water. In syringe a little-little bit light brown. All looks great! The taste is pungent (bitter), but not so strong as #3.<br /><br />I´ll contact the vendor, when nothing comes after 2nd shot. Perhaps methadon lowers the effect, but not against ZERO!<br />

				You can&#039;t properly judge heroin if you are on methadone or suboxone. It just blocks too much of the H effect out, plus it sky rockets your tolerance.<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d wait atleast 24 hrs after your last methadone dose before even thinking about trying the H again.

When this is also not going into my brain - I give it up and stay on metha the rest of my life. <br /><br />It´s not the vendors faut, so I gave him 5/5.

				BULLshit!<br /><br />I don´t took my methadon and wait 1,5 days. My last 0.2 are gone with my last shot. <br />I got a little warm feeling, had my le full of rash, near I shot it IV. I don´t know what I got there, but if this is #4 - forget it! I can´t believe that REAL HEROIN makes you not feeling FUCKING STONED. If you have some methadon or not. When I shoot my H from here I get stoned very good. Why not from better stuff??? BLA-BLA-BLA!!! I feel scammed, wouldn´t you either??<br /><br />Yesterday I take 2 times and.......nothing. A little effect after some hours, I felt a bit sleepy. My wife laughed laudly as I came from shooting and I had soooooo GREAT eyes like I took some coke. And no nodding or other effect. I feel more with lower quality?? FUCK! I take H since 20 years, what will you tell me here?<br /><br />That was NO good and high %-ed H! Perhaps a BENZO or sth like this. <br /><br />I had same effect with C63AMG! &quot;STRONG STUFF&quot;......FUCK!! Only chemicals or other bullshit. I know H very good, cause it´s my life. And he is also a scammer. Always? I don´t know. Some good packages and some scumfuck, who knows?<br /><br />That is why I don´t love to order here. Much great to read, but if you get it, it is NOTHING. And the buyers are too scary to write the truth, in fear they get no more stuff. If I get SHIT, I´ll write it down. What have I from a good hide stuff, with fast post, if this is nearly NOTHING. If I/you get POISON - we are DEAD!!!<br /><br />UNBELIEVEBLE!!!<br /><br />Therefore is the feedback. But the vendors write, &quot;if you do not give me 5/5.........&quot; and they all get it.&nbsp; &nbsp; P A H !!!!!!!&nbsp; That´s blackmail and misleading guide for other buyers. Change your behaviour buyers!! PLEASE!

				100mg of opi&#039;s stuff puts me out for the count nodding for hours, same with NoGenrx. i haven&#039;t tried tommorowmans but everyone says its good. if you do .5 of #3 in every shot and your tolerance is that high than you obviously need a larger than average dose. might even take 150mg at 1 time. who knows. all i know is that the #3 i tried from that AA guys was absolutely terrible. i wouldn&#039;t even call it heroin. it was the worst thing ever. it took me .5 to even feel ANYTHING. who knows. maybe its preference and what your used to. im on suboxone and in my experience nothing can get through it. i have to quit 3 days to feel anything. i wasted 200mg of opi&#039;s product in 1 day right after doing suboxone not to feel anything. i was so pissed. so i would say to wait a minimum of 3 days after using methadone and suboxone to try any other opiate. but on a plus side im 3 months clean from opiates (on suboxone) and am loving life! best of luck to all and sorry for the rant lol

And i hate the fuck about having to score regularly and scrape money together just to feel well. like you say, i would never wish it on anyone, nor would i encourage them to sample this way of life. It&#039;s a one way street that is almost impossible (but not quite) to turn around in!!<br /><br />This is the price we must pay for our enjoyment of the H unfortunately! If only somebody would synthesize a non-addictive strong opioid, then i would be a VERY HAPPY dawg!!!<br /><br />I do however take steps to try and maintain a level of control over my habit. I take frequent breaks from taking H to try and keep my tolly down and my WD&#039;s at a minimum.<br /><br />I NEVER want to go back to the days of NEEDING to score just to live a normal life! That is when the drug has got too big a grip on you, and you need to go through some VERY rough times to get over it!<br /><br />But yes, i still love it!!!<br /><br />(Sorry for the thread derailment btw guys and OP. Feel free to reprimand me harshly! lol)<br />

				Had the same experience, I always get the kick on the 5-15 % shit at home if I just take a high enough dose. Ordered some from here that everyone says is good, never got the kick but was feeling the effect but diden&#039;t feel as good as it always had done before on my 7 years on H, if I took higher doses I just got sea sick, never got the kick. I was thinking that all me years on suboxone has ruined the heroin effect for me for good, but it has always worked before even on the crappiest H there is. Ordered a new batch, hope it will work this time. I Just hope its the H and not my brain. But what I took was brown H and not from Canada, so maybe its not the H? I will know tomorrow when I try another batch.<br /><br />Sry for bad English.
