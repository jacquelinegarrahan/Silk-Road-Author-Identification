				tripI went on long 4 day trip,using lsd,2cb,shrooms,mda,.. dosage over four days,who knows?? Alot though.. tripped hard kept it goung with 2cb,and every few hours iv of mda and mdma.. its been few days since this trip,which really was quite a life lesson for myself and learned more than i ever imagined.. still glowing days adter but my emotions are whack.. crying all time over most minute stuff. idk if this is me unleashing years of frustration and deep rooted hidden feeling and emotions due to the expansion of my mind and connection with people i have lost in last year.. im losing my friends like flies due to heroin and prescription drugs.. sorry for rambling.. just thinking maybe someone experienced same or close after effects of life changing trip

				This isn&#039;t you releasing repressed feelings as you call it, this is you experiencing major disruption in the neurons that effect your mood. Take 5-htp for a few days and you will feel better quick. If you don&#039;t take it, you&#039;ll still feel fine eventually but it may take a week. I&#039;d also stay away from these drugs for a while.<br /><br />Good luck

				Hehe.... yeah, gonna take a few days to rewire that brain for all the fun you had. I&#039;ve done some good benders with MDA / MDMA and even a few weeks out I&#039;ll cry at a touching commercial :-&gt;<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you are already on it but vitamins, real food, little sunshine, no drugs for a while and you should be right as rain eventually. Rides like that can be fun but I&#039;d space em out by the decade if you could, pretty sure my head spaghetti has to do a whole lot of work just to recover from a normal night of fun let alone a fair bit of excess.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Confused much lol.<br />I overdid MDMA severely a few times and worse then the depression and crying were the brainzaps! Anyone else here have these yet?<br />These happened at random, sometimes when i took a drag on my sigarette often at the exact moment i fell alseep.<br />I would feel this very strong electrical pulse zap through my brain from the neck to the top of my head. <br />My body would also jerk pretty violently when it happened, kinda like when your limbs can jerk when your tired but stronger.<br />The zap itself felt as strong as touching 220V live wires or even worse. It scared the crap out of me the first time this happened.<br />Of course its never a good idea to stay awake for 3 days straight all the while popping 100mg+ pills every 2 hours orso, riding on the adrenaline cause you stop rolling anyway after the first 8 hours.<br />Best advice i ever ignored was to use MDMA in moderation -&gt; once every 6 weeks tops (rather 8 to 10) and dont keep popping pills. A 120mg starter dose and maybe 2 boosters should be enough for a regular person to roll hard for the entire night.<br />If you need more your overdoing it and need a longer brake to recover anyway.<br /><br />grts,<br /><br />sam<br /><br /><br />

				&quot;idk if this is me unleashing years of frustration and deep rooted hidden feeling and emotions due to the expansion of my mind and connection with people i have lost in last year.. &quot;<br /><br />YYEEESSSSS!!!!<br />This is without a doubt the absolute most essential time for you to go head first into the deep rooted hidden emotions you&#039;ve been dealing with. <br />Think about what you just went through. You have just administered some of the most powerful and life changing introspective drugs that exist today. It sounds to me that a lot of what happened during those four days was doors opening to angles of perception on your life that you had previously never investigated (or even imagined possible).<br /><br />If you&#039;ve lost friends you&#039;re bound to reflect on that during any psychic journey. Even more so if they were close and the death was attributable to self inflicted harm (drugs). <br /><br />I&#039;d venture a guess that right now you&#039;re more open to change and introspection than you&#039;ve been in a long while. As your mind recovers from the experience, use the discomfort to your advantage. Cry at the most minute stuff. Let it happen and see what happens. You will regain your footing in no time over the unbounded emotions but the most important take away is that you fully utilize your new perceptions on life to direct tomorrow&#039;s decisions in the most positive way you can.<br /><br />-ad

				MDMA can bring out depression easily. I took a pill a little more than a month ago on December 27th, and for the whole month of January I felt unhappy, tired, lethargic, and particularly hopeless; my grades dropped sharply in school and I felt so bad. My mind was overloaded really badly that one night from that one 150mg pill, and I am just recovering from that month long hangover. Depending on your body you are going to have a long month.

Honestly I rarely ever get an E hangover unless I go overboard on redosing like the OP did. I&#039;m pretty sure that the effects you were describing were more personal than medical. Most people, after a single dose of 150mg MDMA will actually end up with a bit of a glow for a few days followed by a bit of a down for a few days but nothing like a month long hang over unless something else fundamentally changed in your life besides a single pill. Not saying it didn&#039;t happen, since I obviously wasn&#039;t there, but it would be unusual for a single dose to have any more than a passing effect on most people.<br /><br />If you ever do do it again, stick with low doses (obviously) and just make sure you get lots of rest the next day. If it still sits wrong after the normal turn around than I guess you are one of the lucky few that it&#039;s just no fun for. If the next trip recovery goes better you might have just gotten the flu from a pretty girl you were kissing that first time, stranger things have happened.<br /><br />I look at E as a cash advance on happiness. It&#039;ll feel great but it will have to be paid back with interest.

				As several others have explained in this thread, there is another thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0 that has helpful info to explain about what mdma/mda does to your body.<br /><br />The feeling of depression is an extremely common after effect.
