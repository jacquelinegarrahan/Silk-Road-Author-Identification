				Hello friends,<br /><br />Looking to have a small amount of powder lab tested for a complete breakdown of what&#039;s in it.<br />Have no idea how to go about this or even where to start.<br /><br />Without having a connect to someone in a lab, is it even possible that there are mail in labs out there that test illegal substances? <br />Willing to pay obviously, just need a nudge in the right direction.<br /><br />Any information is helpful.<br /><br />Thanks

The amount of speed, or whatever the fuck it is in it is scary.<br /><br />Truly fucked up to call this shit coke. Had me in a stimulant psychosis for 2-3 days, fuckin scary experience.<br /><br />Just seein if anyone else has had similar experience with this guy, or if i&#039;m just a pussy and can&#039;t handle my shit.<br /><br />

If you check the results coming from ecstasydata themselves, it looks like they just use a reagent-battery (I could be totally wrong though). They definitely don&#039;t use a HPLC like streetwork does, so you won&#039;t get any statements about how much mg is in it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Powdered ecstasy and other drugs require the full $120 lab fee or they will be discarded by the lab.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Whatever they do, that&#039;s pretty expensive.
