				So you&#039;ve had quite a bit to drink. You know that if you lay down to sleep right now, you&#039;ll be all up in spinland. <br /><br />So what do you do to avoid this scenario? Do you drink water? Do you eat?<br /><br />If you&#039;ve done the above, do you take a bump of meth? coke? or do you just take a benzo and pass out without worrying?<br /><br /><br />Just wondering if there&#039;s a magic cure I haven&#039;t heard of.

				lay flat on your back. stick one leg out of the bed and plant it on the floor. leave one eye slightly open. doing this will give you balance. if you&#039;ve been drinking enough you&#039;ll just fuck out and wake up in the morning. works for me!

				this is quite interesting,would love to see if someone has a fool proof answer.the only way i can stop the spinning room effect is by not lying down till iv sobered up.and to you who say fuck it and pass out,if only it was that easy for me,when im that drunk with the spin i pass out and i usually wake up half an hour later,throw up then properly pass out again.anyone experienced this?

				I always try and stay up long enough to sober up a little bit, drink water, and take an advil. Otherwise I will have the spins, have a shitty 6 hour sleep (no matter what time I pass out) and wake up feeling like absolute garbage, pounding headache and all.

				Just lie down, and let it happen, then fall asleep.<br /><br />By the time alcohol intoxication reaches the point where you cannot stand straight anymore, i suppose its best to give into it, and figure out what to do the morning after. Drinking some water if you can may be a good idea though - it will not help to clear the alcohol from your system, but will make you feel a bit less spent the morning after. <br /><br />

				haha, omg ive used amphetamines as a cure for the &quot;spins&quot; many times! most often BK-MDMA in my case... puts me in a state to where i can maintain inebriation and not feel sick, but when the speed wears off you&#039;re stuck feeling ick again... at that point if its too unbearable i just drink water and dont go to sleep till i can get a grasp... the water wont sober u up, but WILL make u feel better when u wake up in the morning at least

				Surprised no one has mentioned weed in all this, alcohol + weed definately does this. Sometimes I get it without alcohol, like if I&#039;m comin down off stimulants and been hangin for cone for a long time and i overdo it a lil bit with the weed ill spin. I drink plenty of water and keep opening my eyes because its always so bad when i shut my eyes. Eventually it starts to subside and I will fall asleep.

				zofran works great, especially IV, and it isn&#039;t even a controlled substance. ......But if your body is rejecting a &quot;poison&quot; should you just let it do so as shitty as it is. If I&#039;m fuckin desperate from the drink spins then a 1000cc IV with 8-32mg of zofran it is, but still. I&#039;d rather just go for the normal saline and Maybe one zofran,

				I don&#039;t get them anymore and only slight hangovers. Just the water trick for me. It&#039;s hard to do sometimes but I&#039;ll drink 3-4 very large glasses before passing out. Force yourself it&#039;s worth it.

				Like a previous poster said, you have to lay flat on your back and put 1 leg flat on the floor. Also, for dehydration which is caused from drinking, try drinking a glass of Pedialtye before you go to sleep. It works wonders. Yes, it is made for kids, but does work!

I&#039;d go for the IV though...... you just have to be able to do it when you&#039;re shitty drunk which could end up a little bloody. but when it work&#039;s it&#039;s great to get 1000mL of normal saline before bed (just remember to disconnect the IV before passing out).

				This is why I try not to smoke weed if I&#039;ve been binge drinking (5 drinks+).&nbsp; It always makes me get the spins.&nbsp; But, if I slip, I usually just drink a lot of water, eat a light snack, or maybe take a benzo.

				Hooking an IV when you are so drunk the room spins seems like a very silly idea really :)<br /><br />Perhaps dealing with the spins is just part of it - it is what happens when you drink far too much, even without taking any other drugs. Just letting it happen until you pass out seems like a fairly good option, but it may be a good idea to keep a bucket or such close to you bed in case you want to vomit ;)

Do IV when sober the next day if you know how and have enough practice.

As stated before, if you have anything left in your stomach... the spins won&#039;t begin to &#039;go away&#039; until your liver doesn&#039;t have to process anymore &#039;poison&#039;. Not only that, but generally speaking, passing out super drunk with a belly full of liquor is a pretty bad idea in and of itself. Can kill you Jimi Hendrix style, so drunk you fall into a deep-sleep mini coma, then puke, then choke on your own puke... no bueno!<br /><br />Keeping a bucket nearby anyway is always a good idea. It&#039;s always recommended that you lay on your side if you&#039;re not trying to puke before bed. Otherwise, lay on your back(if you&#039;ve puked) as to not put pressure on your liver.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this,this and this all over,probably the best advice there is when it comes to this +1 to you<br /><br />jimi hendrix style happened to me the other week passed out with the spinning room woke up 30 mins later choking on sick,im just lucky enough that i woke up...fuck it was scary while it was happening couldnt breath an was beating my chest,thankfully i got it out and im here to tell the tale..i have to laugh at it now but def something not to forget .

				As far as the choking hazard goes: Try not to fall asleep laying on your back. If you happen to pass out and throw up, that is the worst position to be in since there is no way for the vomit to go except for back down into your lungs. If you pass out laying on your side, chances are most of the vomit would leak from your mouth allowing some passage to breathe. <br /><br />It&#039;s not that common for people to choke on vomit when using only alcohol though. The breathing reflex is quite strong, and will often force someone to shift position to facilitate breathing even if otherwise unable to stand upright and such. In combination with other substances this is another story entirely though, and accidents can and happen<br />
