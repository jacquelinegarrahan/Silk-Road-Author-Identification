				I have a quantity of cocaine that I would say is merely average. I am looking to turn this average cocaine into the highest quality possible using the least amount of effort. perhaps you know of a magic spell or incantation that can accomplish this? anyhow, if not, I understand. maybe you can help me find a more conventional means of purifying this product. <br /><br />let&#039;s explore this topic, together.

				You could easily perform an acetone wash on the coke. There are guides all over the net. It will remove most inactive cuts.

				I have been studying this a lot recently.&nbsp; I am doing a review on all the major coke vendors and need to get an objective measurement of&nbsp; purity.<br /><br />There are lots of options online, but this one is by far the most precise:<br /><br />(dont copy this exactly - look it up elsewhere, my instructions are just pseudocode):<br /><br />1) Cook the coke in to freebase (which basically means put it in a simmering spoon with baking soda).&nbsp; this turns&nbsp; cocaine HCL to cocaine (base)<br /><br />2) chop it up super fine and dissolve in water.&nbsp; The (free)base cocaine will not dissolve but amphetamines and ephedrine will<br /><br />3) filter that out, keeping the solid (which is freebase cocaine)<br /><br />4) after drying, stick it in some 99.9% acetone (do not use 98.5% acetone, you will lose a lot of coke if you do).<br /><br />5) add some muratic acid (aka hydrochloric acid) and wait for the coke to recrystalize<br /><br />6) At this point you should have cocaine crystals<br /><br /><br />This pretty much filters out everything except for levamisole.&nbsp; I&#039;m still working on figuring that one out (see my other post asking for a chemist).<br />

				BTW I know I already said this, but I am going to repeat myself:&nbsp; Dont just try those six steps without further research.&nbsp; There are a ton of small details you need to know to get it right.&nbsp; Search around and you&#039;ll find a thorough description of the process.<br /><br />

				The only incantation I have ever found to be successful is if you put on a red cape,&nbsp; stand over your coke, and say ALA Peanut Butter Sandwiches! :D<br />But seriously, there a million tutorials out there which are all very similar and easy to perform.&nbsp; Unfortunately you will not be able to get any Levamisole out with an acetone wash.&nbsp; Someone here a while back posted a tutorial on removing levamisole that they claimed to have success with.<br /><br />Good luck
