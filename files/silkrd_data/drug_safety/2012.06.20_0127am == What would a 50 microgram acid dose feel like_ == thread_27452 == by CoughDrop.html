				If I were to half a 100 ~ microgram blotter of acid between myself and one other person, would I notice any affects? It will be both of our first times, and we are both rather anxious and do not want to have an overly intense first experience. I am rather experienced with every other category of drugs besides hallucinogens. I am actually sitting on half a gram of DMT that I am afraid of in a strange sort of way due to my lack of psychedelic experience.<br /><br />My most sincere apologies for the dumb question, when I am nearly certain the answer is going to be just go for the full 100 microgram trip.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />CoughDrop

				You will probably feel a minor body euphoria. Possibly some slight visuals. You will almost definitely feel something but it is doubtful that only 50ug will give you an appreciation for the wonderful chemical that is LSD. I took 200ug my first time and I was very glad that I did. I would recommend 100ug minimum for a first timer.<br /><br />Happy tripping.

				Just remember what ever the reported ug of the trip is, in reality you are probably taking a 1/2 or 1/4 that amount.&nbsp;

				Oh.&nbsp; And while we&#039;re on the subject, that half gram of DMT...&nbsp; You can take baby steps with that too, if you want.&nbsp; Everyone talks about the crazy intense timeless machine-elf visions you can get from DMT, but that&#039;s when you&#039;re hitting a strong enough dose to break through. 50 to 60 milligrams does it for me.<br /><br />If you&#039;re only doing a _little_ of it, say 10 to 20 milligrams, you don&#039;t get that.&nbsp; What I tend to get is a moderately strong but brief wave of dizziness, a somewhat sharper sense of &#039;dimensionality&#039; in whatever space I&#039;m in, and a bit of color distortion...&nbsp; And then it&#039;s gone.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of like walking into a patch of land where the gravity is slightly different and then walking back out again.&nbsp; Weird but not unpleasant.&nbsp; I might also feel just a little bit lightheaded for 10 to 15 minutes, like a pot high but without the euphoria.<br /><br />The catch of course is that DMT has a very sharp slope.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t a lot of mass difference between 20 milligrams and 50, but the difference in effect can be dramatic.&nbsp; Messing around in the midrange could take you in either direction.&nbsp; I also think that if you don&#039;t _eventually_ want the intense full breakthrough experience, there isn&#039;t that much point in bothering with DMT.&nbsp; If you just want to feel slightly weird, weed tastes a lot better and lasts longer.&nbsp; <br /><br />But you can still start with small doses and work your way up to it.&nbsp; And just like I said with acid, there&#039;s nothing wrong with starting conservative.

I have about half a gram of some high grade weed left that I may smoke with it if I am up to it.

My friend also brought up the idea of just watching me take the acid, and possibly taking a little bit of molly, as she is a bit more nervous than I am. (If it weren&#039;t for my lack of available funds I would just buy 2, but I only have $17 in bitcoins.) If I were to take 100 mics of LSD, how many hours into the trip would it be safe for me to take MDMA without it dulling the LSD experience or getting too intense. Or would it be in my best interest to just stick to the acid? (If I took any MDMA, I would likely only take 100mg or less, as in the past that was a nice dosage to have me rolling nicely, yet controlled.)<br /><br />LSD is a different breed of drug than I am accustomed to, and I am hoping to approach it with respect and caution.

The DMT. I actually smoked what I would estimate to be under 20 mg of it in an oil burner pipe, as an allergy test more or less (Good news, I didn&#039;t have some freak reaction!). I figured I would rather not be that one guy who had an allergic reaction out of everyone who has ever tried it. I certainly did not breakthrough (Wasn&#039;t planning on it!) but I did instantly feel a sort of warmness wash over my body, feeling it heavily in my cheeks. It also seemed as if some things were more liquid, and my arms had a very distinct heaviness to them. I certainly have high hopes of breaking through completely on DMT, I just wanted to have a more gentle psychedelic experience (LSD) before being blasted to a foreign planet (DMT). Also, a bit off topic. Is DMT supposed to smell and taste like cat piss? This stuff seriously is disgusting tasting, but the vapor was not nearly as bad as I had expected it to be on my lungs. No coughing or the sort, just slight irritation and burning.<br /><br />When I am ready to fully experience DMT is it safe to just &quot;eyeball&quot; it, and what would be the best practice to do so? I do not own a milligram scale, and do not have the money to purchase an accurate one. I understand that it is poor practice to spend the money purchase the drugs without having the money for the proper safety equipment, but I have heard it is impossible to OD on and that it is okay to just keep smoking until you drop the pipe. (A bit reckless for my taste, but if it is safe I suppose it shall do.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27452.msg299351#msg299351">Quote from: fsgr on June 20, 2012, 04:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just remember what ever the reported ug of the trip is, in reality you are probably taking a 1/2 or 1/4 that amount. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I understand using that as a guideline for street acid, but does this rule of thumb still apply to SR acid?

Good point. It may be worth pointing out that the friend in question happens to be my girlfriend, so she will be sticking around. :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m happy to say I&#039;ve never experienced a cat pissing in my mouth, so I can&#039;t tell you if that&#039;s accurate.&nbsp; I CAN tell you that DMT really does taste awful.&nbsp; Burning rubber seems pretty close to me.&nbsp; I have trouble holding it in myself because of that taste.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You have never lived until you have experienced a cat pissing in your mouth.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just posted in another thread about my Gemini-20 that I bought on Amazon.com -- it&#039;s not the best scale money can buy, but it&#039;s definitely the best milligram scale that $20 can buy.&nbsp; It&#039;s worked just fine for me for DMT purposes.&nbsp; Eyeballing it would be &quot;safe&quot; only if you&#039;re willing to be somewhat adventurous with the effects; especially if you&#039;ve never taken _any_ measurements, so that you don&#039;t really know what 20 mg or 50 mg etc. look like.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For $20 I may have to invest in one.

				Wow. The seller I was about to purchase the tab of acid from delisted the item like 5 minutes ago. I would order from one of the other sellers but I have $16.74 in bitcoins and wanted it by next weekend.<br /><br />What a bummer.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-[<br /><br />EDIT: I contacted the seller, and he broke up a larger strip for my single blotter order. And he replied within minutes! Impressive customer service and now my plans are back on track. :)

				i did what you did, started off with less than a full blotter and looking back i would have probably been fine just taking the whole thing. just read trip reports for the dosage you decide and familiarize your self with the effects so it doesn&#039;t completely surprise you

				I&#039;d be surprised if you felt anything at all, I think that&#039;s right at the threshold level, someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong. Again, my views might jaded from heavy acid trips lmao

				100ug if it is accurate and good acid, you should be in love, having euphoria on anything you are watching, big laughs, maybe very little melting. I think it is a bit short for open eyes visuals.<br /><br />Let it drives you and don&#039;t be afraid, there is absolutly no reason to.<br /><br />100 ug is way more controlable than 200. You should not be feared by your thoughts.<br /><br />Try to take it a beautiful weather day, in nature. It is more easy the day than the night, but the night is better for visuals for sure. Nature gives you amazing feeling of energy. You are one with the nature. Pure love.<br />

I also feel that it enhances my creativity.<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; as someone who has had several bad trips which lead to panic attacks, I think one should always start with small dosages with psychedelics. Start with one hit or maybe even half a tab if you are apprehensive about it.

				50 microgram will do nothing to me .. i have to take at least 300 or more to have a decent trip but i have builded a tolerance with the time. If you have never done lsd before try some 150 microgram, this is pretty safe for a first timer.
