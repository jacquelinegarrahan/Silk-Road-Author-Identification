				I have my first order of AMT on the way, so everything I&#039;ll say will come from hours upon hours of reading trip reports and BlueLight forums on AMT:) I&#039;m really hyped about this drug.<br />◄ AMT is known to cause nausea on the come up. It seems to be random - same person sometimes gets nauseous, sometimes not. Taking AMT on empty belly seems to help to avoid that. In any case, be prepared.<br />◄ AMT takes 2-3 hours to start working (oral dosing). Be patient and don&#039;t re-dose too soon.<br />◄ Trip lasts for a VERY LONG TIME. Be prepared for 8-12 hours.<br />◄ Some people experience intense head pain on the comedown. Most people experience no comedown and lovely afterglow for the next days.<br />◄ Taking it orally has different effects than vaping (smoking). Vaping hits faster, acts shorter and feels much more &#039;speedier&#039;. Most people don&#039;t like vaping it. Different people react differently to this drug, be careful not to take too much. Doing an &#039;allergy test&#039; is always a good idea. 5mg. orally is so called AMT antidepressant dose. It should give you noticeable mood boost for the day, but you should be able to go with your daily routine. For your first time you should take it orally (or rectally, more on that later).<br />◄ AMT in freebase form is ~20% (don&#039;t quote me on that) more potent. Adjust your dosage. You can vaporize freebase, but not the salts. If you don&#039;t know what form or AMT you have, put some AMT in the warm water. If it just floats it&#039;s freebase. Salts are water soluble. <br />◄ If you are experienced with drugs and reacted as supposed to &#039;allergy dose&#039;, start with 30mg orally (assuming you have freebase). If you feel utterly underwhelmed few hours later, do another 20mg. (re-dosing isn&#039;t something people like to do on this drug, because it makes trip very long).<br />◄ AMT feels &#039;something like mdma or candyflip (mdma+lsd)&#039;. Some people don&#039;t get any visuals even at large doses.<br />◄ Dosage for vaporizing is much smaller! (wikipedia this shit)<br />◄ Rectal dosage is the same as oral, but people prefer it because this eliminates nausea on the come-up, body load and head-ache on the come-down. It&#039;s better to convert freebase to salt for this (you will just need some vinegar, it&#039;s easy, google), but freebase works fine too.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I forgot something.. :)

				AMT is pretty cool. I have tried low oral doses a couple of times (10 mg, it provides a nice moodlift all day), smoking it (10mg, didnt like it, the physical euphoria wasnt there and it was &quot;empty&quot; and speedy) and orally in doses of 40 to 50mg.<br /><br />I found it orally in high doses of it very nice. The best way to describe is that it has different stages.The first T+0 to T+2 hours are speedy anxious feeling. Right before this ends and the next period starts i get a little bit of nausea and vomit sometimes. Its not that bad and once its really kicks in at about T+2 it is awesome. Feels very nice and deep and physically very pleasant and has a slight psychedelic head space. Similar to mdma but a deeper less rushed feeling and makes you feel good about the friends you have and isnt really super loved up like mdma. This good feeling fades a bit at around t+5 and it becomes more of a psychedelic and it has a mushroom/lsd feel. It does have that DMT feel because it is a tryptamine but its not that strong like DMT. It is like lsd visuals somewhat but no fear of a bad trip as the euphoria is still going at this point. This psychedelic stage last until t+10 to T+12 when i start coming down. Then the trail off lasts a while. I really cant attempt sleep until T+14 to t+16. Generally the next day i do not feel bad, just a bit fatigued from the day before. One of the best parts is that once i get a nice night of sleep, i feel excellent the next couple of days. Like as minor things do not bother me, everything is good. Its like an anti-depressant.<br /><br />Overall it is nice but it lasts a long time and not that its bad, but it seems to lack something to me. Its a wide open space that amt gives and you can do whatever. I think combining some other psychedelic with it would be awesome. I also find that when the psychedelic stage kicks in i get very relaxed and no energy and just want to lounge around.<br /><br />Hope this helps a bit.
