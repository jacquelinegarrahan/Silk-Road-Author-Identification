			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve been browsing Silkroad for awhile, but never posted before. I figured this was as good a time as any.<br /><br />I&#039;ve come into possession of what I was told was opium, from a friend of mine. This is a new substance for me, and I am not quite sure exactly how to do it. I&#039;ve read different methods online and tried a few thus far, but, I haven&#039;t noticed much of an effect yet. The methods of ingestion tried thus far are smoking it by itself out of a lightbulb, which generated the most smoke, using a cannabis pipe and smoking it by itself, also in a cannabis pipe with a bowl. Additionally, he said putting some on your gums like a dip worked.<br />The taste, though, is awful. It doesn&#039;t even taste particularly &#039;chemically&#039;, just... Damn terrible. So, at this point, I&#039;m curious if what I have is really opium, or if my friend was sold something different, and myself in turn.<br />The opium I have is green, mostly, perhaps a slight tint of brown. It is powdery, but does form small chunks, which easily break apart. It does smell fairly earthen. I have tried to find a picture online similar to what I have, but have thus far been unable to.<br />So, question being, does this sound like it might still be opium? Something like it? I know it would be impossible to get a definite answer, but even a guess would give me a better idea.<br /><br />Thanks for your time, sorry for the longish post!

				I don&#039;t think so, that sounds more like hash to me. I was under the impression opium was more of a latex-like substance, but that being said I haven&#039;t actually seen opium myself.

				I think too is hash o something else, but definatly not Opium, Opium is all but green, and is yes alatex like substance but just when is scored from the plant, actually it stays latexy for just a little time, as soon as it come out of the plant it start to oxidate and become a sticky gluey substance more and more brown, when is collected and put together it can be brown-reddish at start and becomes more and more dark with the time until it ages in a glassy black rock when all the humidity goes away ( it can take quite a long time..) and the smell is all but chemical! it tastes and smells like...well like poppyjuice!! very natural indeed!! wish i had kilos of it, i remember the good old days when we joung punks where travel all the way to Andalusia,south of Spain, where the poppy crops for the pharma company are, and sneak into the fields to collect our opium, and what a Opium, 18-20 % morphine and all the lovely alcaloids that make you dream and scratch like hell...what a days i still can remeber the smell of O you end up having all over you from going up and down the field trough the lanced pods... too bad at the time i didnt have all the infos you find on line nowadays... i would have try a morphine extraction for sure eheheh!!<br />Peace and Love to the Poppy

				I also agree that it sounds more like hash than opium, and somewhat poor quality hash at that.&nbsp; Opium really shouldn&#039;t be green, and hash &quot;mostly&quot; shouldn&#039;t.&nbsp; Often, though, hash is indeed green because plenty of leaf particles get in during the process, which lowers the potency considerably.&nbsp; Hash made from Mexican brick schwag tends to be quite green, perhaps almost olive-colored, forming in chunks that crumble to powder with little effort.&nbsp; It&#039;s not very strong, which may explain why you had no effects when smoking it.&nbsp; If it were good hash, you should have at least gotten a bit high...

				Um he said it smelt terrible<br /><br />Unless he is a complete noob to all drugs, he&#039;d know what hash smelt like<br /><br />And what hash do you know thats green anyway? the smell is great, no hash smells like shit and is green and powder like<br /><br /><br />I dont think you have opium, but I also dont think its hash

				I have indeed smoked hash before. Undoubtedly not the best quality, but I could recognize the taste. I don&#039;t believe it was hash. I am going to get the opportunity to use a vaporizer tomorrow, perhaps that&#039;ll produce better results? Again, I realize without a picture of the substance you can&#039;t get me a definite answer, but is there anything else it might be? When I tried smoking it I believe I felt something... Of course, being so excited to try it, it might just have been a placebo effect.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t believe it is black tar heroin. From the pictures I&#039;ve seen and descriptions I&#039;ve read, black tar is a fairly solid substance.
