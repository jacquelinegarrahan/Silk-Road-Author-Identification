				Hi guys Im wondering if someone can help me figure out what the best dose is to get some really pretty effects from H ?<br /><br />My history with opiates are using liquid morphine after surgery between 15 ml and 35 ml every 4 hours or something, and sipping opium pod tea on a few occasions (The shit grows all over the place around here), but I&#039;m not sure what the crossover is on this stuff.<br /><br />I have no experience with heroin outside of a time 10 or so years ago. I was smoking crack and partying with a couple of chicks. We all went&nbsp; back to my place and I was higher than a kite. One of the girls loaded a pipe with heroin without saying that it was heroin, smoked some and passed it around. Being pretty naive about drugs and people, I smoked a few big tokes, and she stopped me from going further which was probably a good very good thing. It became evident to me very quickly that it was a downer and I had smoked to much. My breathing got really low and I started to panic and felt really antsy, and i felt needed to walk around and keep breathing. I went out into a subzero snowstorm with my cordless phone walking around trying to stay breathing, afraid I was going to die. I don&#039;t know how close I truly was to death, but whatever was going on was enough to scare the shit out of me.<br /><br />I have C63amg&#039;s brown stuff and i did some tiny bumps, width of tooth floss, after a few lines of coke. Both are exceptional products.<br /><br />Whats the best dose for me and method of delivery? I have been insufflating both, but think of smoking the H. I have some caps for back door delivery, and DMSO, which I&#039;ve thought of using as a substitute for Needles. If any of you have any experiences with it that you can share I woulld be very interested in hearing them.<br /><br /><br />Cheers!<br />jhdrgdzw<br /><br />

				Hey friend, are you aware some Opium is up on the marketplace?<br /><br />I also believe I saw a KIT, like first time heroin kit, some H seller had it, so check out the drug equipment stuff too.<br /><br />Also check out Erowid, for doses and experiences

				@ MicroRNA Thanks for the kitten man. Those are wise words. Lets not exagerate though, if the Doc put me on morphine for a month and a half and then had me quite cold turkey, substituting in hydromorphone (gross!) for a couple weeks, a little heroin isnt going to hurt. I don&#039;t intend to use regularily, I just want to try what I have here properly to get high a few times or as a come down from coke or speed, too much coffee etc, with the help of people that have been down that winding road&nbsp; :)<br /><br />@ Rassu - Thanks bro, but I have no interest in harvesting opium for resale... way to much work ! ! I checked erowid before posting here, but they say very little about snorting H and nothing about DMSO, nor do they get into any detail about the actual methods..<br /><br />@MecaJesus ...stomach Vial?<br /><br />I tried smoking it on slice of a beer can but i cant seem to get the &#039;chase&#039; thing to work.. hits seem too mild.. snorting seems to work the best so far. Might try the DMSO.....<br /><br />

				if your smoking it use infoil. but burn the tinfoil first and get as much combustable chemicals out of it as possible. also, i find if you light a candle and then hover the foil over the flame till it starts to release vapour is easiest. have a conical foil tube to suck up all the vapor.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had c63amg&#039;s stuff, i found it really nice. I have it a go with no opiate tolerance at the time. i started tiny, got some baseline effects and went from there. i found around 3 ish centimeters was nice. then chased a bit on foil after about 10-15 minutes to gauge the effect of the line. <br /><br />And yeah, be careful man. don&#039;t even let it get close to once every week. ever.<br /><br />just start really low and work your way up till your happy. I prefer sniffing, but then i just like sniffing&nbsp; ;D dont go near the needle!

				Yea i was just kinda being harsh, sorry. but i mean I felt like shit, and you asked for experiences, so hopefully it was understandable. i was too sick to post a legit response... maybe thats what i got a negative karma for though? didnt mean to not be helpful. you should just please consider the risks and use them appropriately. my goal was just to give you a cautious approach cause i love you and dont want you to fall head over heals for that nasty sneaky woman opiophilia (or man if you are a gal??? :P )<br /><br />and my vomit wasnt stomach bile, it was like root beer, reeses, snickers, and some fritos which was the most horrible wretched thing ever unfortunately. thankfully afterwords I felt better and showered. cause I took a few lines of H since I had to go take my three hour long examination, but luckily I felt fine the entire time for it. should have spent less time on the forum and more time studying though!<br /><br />you never really mentioned your tolerance so it is impossible to suggest doses which is already very difficult. If you are looking to get really high though, then smoking is definitely the way to go. The delivery to your bloodstream is excellent as is the bioavailability, both of which are only beaten by IV and will produce strong effects and even a rush generally. It will take much less smoking then insufflating given the quick delivery to the brain so higher CNS concentration. dont really know your tolerance but since C&#039;s dope is supposed to be high quality, just start with match heads. take hits and work your way up to where you are good. <br /><br />i dont see the point in trying to plug if thats what you were suggesting, and it seems overly messy and difficult esp when you have 3 which was made for smoking... if you do plug though I dont think capsules are a good idea if thats what you said? I think generally you make an aqueous solution and use a syringe (no needle, maybe a tube?) to squirt it up there or something... please just be careful and use a tiny starting dose as well cause it also has very high bio-av. wouldnt use the needle if you were considering that... i would think smoking would produce a sufficient experience but you need to use the tinfoil and not just burn all the dope in one place... let it melt and tilt, then run it along with the flame and catch the smoke. <br /><br />what were you thinking with the dmso? that certainly sounds interesting but I have never heard of anyone using it with H. where would you administer the solution? probably would start small if you use this method assuming most of the drug will be absorbed. <br /><br />good luck, be safe please<br />- miR

				I mentioned the morphine/morphone which was the last time in the last 2 years untill I started on this .3 g I got on Monday. My first dose was&nbsp; approx &lt; .005 g&nbsp; with a line of coke, and that added a definite pleasant calming effect to the coke. I did quite a bit yesterday, and less today ( so far ), but I&#039;m already noticing a tolerance. There&#039;s&nbsp; 0.13 g left,, How am i doing so far? :) <br />Are telling me that you didn&#039;t eat any of those foods that you vomited up ?<br /><br />So yeah, just been snorting it. Couldn&#039;t figure out the smoking, and after i thought about it and I don&#039;t really want to smoke anything. No needles. Tried the DMSO with &lt; .002 and I definitely felt something, however, and Always Trying, I agree with you on this, I think snorting is a much more enjoyable experience for some reason.<br /><br />Does anyone know how many consecutive days of using it takes to get addicted? And thanks so much&nbsp; for your concern microRNA&nbsp; I do understand and respect the danger of opiates, but personally I cant see myself doing this very often. <br /><br />jhdrgdzw!<br />

				Its definitely not like you use it for three days in a row and you are addicted... you may feel just a little bit off and some mild stomach discomfort at the most I would say. spreading .3 g out over a few days isnt anything too extreme but maybe long enough to build up a tiny bit of dependence which could be indicated by the tolerance meaning downregulation of the receptors. generally I think people say no more than ever 2 or 3 days with at least around a week in between to really avoid dependence. <br /><br />To all opiate users who are in the initial experimentation stages of use or even beyond, the psychological dependence is much more sneaky. you really dont even realize you have a problem until it is too late, and this is what most people dont seem to realize. It started as just occasionally, once in a blue moon with just some percs from friends or cough syrup with a chest cold. Then just some OC every once in a while. Then more frequently but only on the weekends still, and at this point still didnt notice where things were headed. By the time I was doing them during the week sometimes, there were no negative effects and the frequency increased even more, until now I would feel ill without them so it became everyday and after that point nothing horrible happened. But eventually the tolerance builds to a point you cant afford but you no longer have the motivation to stop using... and thats when things really start to go downhill. Initially though you just dont see the momentum building, so please be aware you need to always be cautious as I have over emphasized Im certain. But please, make sure you set a firm set of rules for your usage and never use more frequently than what you established for yourself. If you ever rationalize bypassing these rules, its clear you are losing control of the usage and at that you need to be aware and stop before things get any worse please. <br /><br />oh and I totally ate all of those things as late-night snacks, I just hadnt slept very long and the fritos was the most disgusting thing ever!!! horrible! <br />- miR

				Some really good advice. <br /><br />Sorry to hear about your very unfortunate experiences! That truly saddens me and I hope things get better for you. I hope you do have things to be grateful for, maybe awesome access from SR even just anything, so that you can enjoy life in some way. Sucks you say life is not even worth living, I would say stick in there and I am sure you will make the best of your situation with some time.<br /><br />that is so fucked up with the law, just wish responsible users wouldnt be turned into scumbag criminals just because they use a drug... so disappointing. i dream of moving to a place with diamorphine maintaince where they have a society which treats it as a disease not a crime. <br /><br />I am currently in over my head and just hope the OP and others can avoid the same hardships.
