				Some of us were camping up north (like fly-in north, not drive-up north).&nbsp; We had rented a cottage and brought along some recreational party favors for the few nights we would be there.&nbsp; <br />Most of us were pretty accomplished phychonauts, there was an assortment of shrooms, and coke and booze mostly.<br />As the shrooms wore off, and the night was winding down, we started doing a few pin rails just to keep the energy up enough to catch the sunrise.&nbsp; We bought the coke here, I won&#039;t name the vendor, but it was primo, and stronger than most of the street-stomped stuff we are used to.&nbsp; After 4 or 5 lines, we headed outside to catch the sun.&nbsp; The most inexperienced of us who was still shrooming a little decided &quot;he didn&#039;t feel anything off the coke&quot;.&nbsp; So he stuck his straw in what was probably .75g left in the baggie and did a bag rail, inhaling almost a full .25 (at best guess) on top of the lines he did with us.&nbsp; <br />He threw up immediately and came out to tell us what he had done and that his heart was beating too fast and he was having a hard time catching his breath. It likely wasn&#039;t a lethal dose, but he was obviously shocky.<br />We got on the sat-phone right away to call the plane back to come get us (4 hours), but in the mean time, we made him throw up again, and ran a nettie pot through his sinus canals to clear out any un-absorbed chunks. <br />He was pretty pale and hyperventilating, probably from shock as much as anything, so I took 2.5mg of 3dames k-pins I had for helping me sleep the rest of the day away, and crushed them and had him parachute it with a light beer to potentiate the sedative affect.&nbsp; Within 20 minutes he was calm and relaxed, his pulse was no longer thready and he was asking if what happened was normal.<br />We were all pretty freaked out, but I guarantee you having those benzos around helped level this guy out of his shock at least (the shock can kills as often as the overdose).<br />Pro-tip.&nbsp; If you are going to do coke, and there is a chance you&#039;ll do too much.. have a healthy supply of genuine benzos along in case things go sideways.<br />Thanks 3dames!

Freaking out will cause some of the same somatic effects, and so they compound, making things more dangerous. <br /><br />I also have an assortment of benzos laying around for emergencies like that, but I always seem to run through them somehow. Weeks of time just get washed away from my memory. They&#039;re really some of my least favorite drugs for that reason, but then again that&#039;s also what they&#039;re really good for in the first place. =P
