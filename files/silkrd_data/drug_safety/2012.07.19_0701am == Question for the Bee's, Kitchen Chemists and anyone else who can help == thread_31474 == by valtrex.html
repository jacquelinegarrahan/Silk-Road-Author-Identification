				Lets say I was suspicious of the cut (acetone soluble) included in my MDMA. Lets say I put in a gram of suspect mdma in a careful and gradual amount of acetone, till soluble impurities dissolve in acetone. I then filter out the the crystals through coffee filter when I pour dissolved acetone/impurities into another container. After these crystals are dried, can I recrystallize them by a solvent like hot IPA, then slowly let it cool down till crystals start to grow and the cold alcohol should should be poured out or repeat cooling to salvage more crystals. Basically what I&#039;m saying is that can I do acetone wash, then do recrystallization in IPA?. Does this sound like a reasonable strategy to purify mdma? Does it sound like it is inefficient?

				Basically everything sounds good until the recrystalize part. I THINK to have to do a brand new synthization of the MDMA to make a solid crystilazition of the substance. I think when the MDMA is first synthesized, the molecules bond to each other creating the one solid crystal. Heating them will just make the particles more energetic but probably not necessarily bond together to create a uniform crystal

				purifying mdma is a good idea all around, but especially if your mdma smells like licorice which is indicative of saffrole... a common contaminant after the synthesis that is highly carcinogenic (banned by FDA, like from root beer, for the danger) you should use a non polar wash<br /><br />you can use acetone as you mention, just test the purity using an evaporation test on&nbsp; a mirrored surface to look for a lack of residue. next it is very important because acetone is hygroscopic to remove the water or else a significant portion of the mdma will be lost given its aqueous solubility.&nbsp; <br /><br />to wash the mdma:&nbsp; (use caution as acetone will dissolve some plastics)<br />you need to buy magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and bake in an oven at about 420 for around an hour till the appearance changes to a more powdered sugar/ baking powder look to dry the hydrate to an anhydrous form which will absorb water...&nbsp; <br /><br />take a portion of the acetone and dump a good bit of the anhydrous salt and shake well, then let sit overnight to allow the MgSO4 to settle to the bottom. Then you can just add you mdma to say a shot glass, carefully pour or use a pipet to carefully transfer the some dry acetone (no salt...) into the shot glass. <br /><br />Break up and mix/stir around the mdma and then let it settle for a few hours. dump off the acetone leaving the settled material and save the acetone in another container, then repeat by adding more dry acetone to the mdma until it become as white as possible and the acetone removed remains clear. <br /><br />take the mdma after washing and just dump onto a mirror and allow to dry, then scrape your crystals.&nbsp; (take all the saved removed acetone and let that sit for a good while, at least overnight to make sure no mdma remained in solution as well)
