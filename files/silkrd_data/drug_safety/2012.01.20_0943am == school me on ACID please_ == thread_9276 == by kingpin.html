				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to learn about acid. I have only done it twice now, first time was 2 tabs, and second was 7 tabs over a 16 hour period,<br />first time was spirtual and meaningful, second time was more fun and visuals were great, but I prefer my first time. Is it like other <br />drugs where your first time was the best and then you cant reach the same level? I hope not, I remember thinking after my first time<br />this is something I would like to do maybe a few times a year forever. I also have recently tried 2ce, and was great also.<br /><br />Anyways I was hoping people could answer some questions and school me so im wiser.<br /><br />1) What is &quot;Wow&quot; acid?<br />2) Is there anyways to make it spirtual and meaningful again?<br />3) What RC&#039;s are there that can be passed off as acid on tabs/blots?<br />4) Is LSD synethetic drug?<br />5) What chemicals are used to make LSD , is it hard?<br />6) Is there anyway to tell once you have take that you are definetly on acid as ossposed to a RC?<br />7) Is there anywhere to check the quality and reports for acid like there is for pills (pillreports.com) ?<br /><br />Please share your knowledge with a fellow novice psycho-naught! <br /><br />Thanks <br />Kingpin !!

				1) WoW = White on White<br />2) Maybe if you try mescaline?<br />3) DOx mostly afaik. They seem to be a little bigger than real acid blotters.<br />4) Yes.<br />5) Lots of and it is really hard.<br />6) Well, since I&#039;ve never had any RC I cant say for sure. I heard the taste is different and it takes longer before you feel anything.<br />7) Check out the LSD reviews in the rumor mill :)<br />

				1) White on White.<br />2) You could try taking it alone? Also take it in a meaningful place and try to think a substantial amount instead of wonking around and just looking at shit.<br />3) DOx drugs. 25i-NBOMe?<br />4) Yes.<br />5) Definitely hard to make, you start with Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds or morning glory seeds, extract LSA and then turn that into LSD (I&#039;m not a chemist, I don&#039;t know exactly how it works).<br />6) Acid will have a very distinct feel to it in comparison to RC&#039;s.&nbsp; I always get a strange feeling in my neck and throat when I try to swallow on acid.&nbsp; Also, acid will rarely make you nauseous compared to RC&#039;s where it happens almost every time unless you take some diphenhydramine(Benadryl) along side them. <br />7) Best chance you have of knowing the quality of any acid you get is to either take some into a test center yourself or buy from a very reputable seller on the silk road who has had his/her acid tested for ug amount.<br /><br />Cheers<br />djaze
