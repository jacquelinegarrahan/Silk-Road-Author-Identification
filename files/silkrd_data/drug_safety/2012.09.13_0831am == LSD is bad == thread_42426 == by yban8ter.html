				I took in LSD of 1 blotter for the first time. It was a pleasure very what happened next.<br />However, the experience was greatly disappointed. The change that happened to my body was very really terrible.<br />A whole body was covered with lassitude, and the head abnormally ran hot.<br />Not the&nbsp; hallucination, Not a trip.<br />The LSD be an false? or&nbsp; I took a wrong quantity of the dosage?

				You got fake lsd, or extremely weak tabs. 1 tab should be enough for a beginner if it&#039;s quality.

				No. LSD is good. LSD is very good. I believe it saved my life. I was a complete Heroin addict before I started using LSD. Now I never even think about. <br />The funny thing is... it was Silk Road that got me the LSD. SR actually helped me get OFF of drugs. Except for Acid (but that&#039;s a good thing).

				LSD isn&#039;t &quot;bad,&quot; it&#039;s just weird. Everything in moderation. LSD can and will make you a crazy person if you use it too much.

				LSD IS GREAT. If you prepare well you&#039;re in for the experience of your life, even if it&#039;s not a large dose.&nbsp; I agree with Buddha as far as moderation goes but no drug will &quot;make&quot; you anything. Give Lucy the respect she deserves and she will show you many many wonderful things.

If it was 150ug and your first time maybe you just had to much. Everyone has different levels that they have a good time on and many people don&#039;t enjoy psychedelics at all.<br /><br />I have had flyagarcis mushrroms before and the trip is really nothing like an LSD trip, much more delirant and fever kind of experience. I doubt the active compound in flyagarics would fit on 1 blotter. There are a number of rc&#039;s that will such as dox&#039;s and nmbomes but if other people are reporting it as good LSD you probably just had a bad trip.<br /><br />Just be careful if you haven&#039;t had much experience start with 1/4 even and work your way up to a level that you enjoy and rember just because other people enjoy dosen&#039;t mean you have to. Everyone has different affinitys for different drugs. For me even a tiny amount of weed will make me nauseaus and trip balls so I just don&#039;t do it&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
