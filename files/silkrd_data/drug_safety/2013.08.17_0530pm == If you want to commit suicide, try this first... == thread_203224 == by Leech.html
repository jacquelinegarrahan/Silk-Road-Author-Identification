				If you wish to find a suitable drug to kill yourself, why not try a strong/double dose of shrooms, psilocybe mushrooms as an alternative, first?<br /><br />You should be able to know how it feels to be out of your body (if you are lucky), and how death feels like. Bro had an out of body experience before from it, learned to value life, and your perception towards life, too, might be changed... after tasting death.<br /><br />Well, just a suggestion.

				LSD can perhaps be attributed to why I&#039;m still alive today. I was suicidally depressed for a few years, but no longer am.<br /><br />I&#039;m skeptical on the trying of shrooms; I don&#039;t really trust my judgement while on them and would be afraid that if I had been suicidal when I tried them, I&#039;d&#039;ve attempted suicide.

				Personally if I ate enough Mushi to match the Lucy, I&#039;d have a terrible stomach ache the whole come up haha. The mental clarity with Mushi might end up working against you too. The whole point of the experience is to allow you to stop thinking the same way.

				Well, its a bit of an odd situation.&nbsp; If you are about to commit suicide you may as well try anything you can think of before you do, as long as it doesn&#039;t incapacitate you to the point of being unable to commit suicide if you decide to go through with it. <br /><br />You could consider hallucinogens for sure, but also substances like morfine or heroin. Perhaps the sensation that it is possible to feel -that- good may prevent you from committing suicide right then and there. On the other hand, becoming a junky and living for several years like that may be a fate worse than instant death - everyone gets this choice.

				Try DMT, hit it until you cant hold the pipe. Changa or freebase, no mixing it with weed.<br />It&#039;s like committing suicide and living, AND you may learn something out of it. not to mention it dosent make your family members or friends cry and if you need to you can do it again.

				Suicide the mind, not the body.<br /><br />Once you suicide the mind, you will be reborn, and may no longer have the desire to suicide the body.<br /><br />Take LSD or mushrooms. Ego death is like a controlled suicide attempt that can&#039;t actually hurt you.

				Yes, I agree with the above poster who suggested heroin, or morphine. I think that a decent dose would cheer anyone up (seriously) For several years, I was pretty fixated on speedballs (heroin and cocaine) but sometimes it&#039;s dangerous to shoot up coke (scared myself seriously probably about 10-15 times-course those &#039;scares&#039; didn&#039;t last and after another hour I was ready to &#039;rock&#039; again). <br />I&#039;m an old guy now, but I was depressed in my early &#039;20&#039;s, and a good drinking problem didn&#039;t help either. I&#039;ve thought for several years now that my earlier depression was probably from thinking how much work I&#039;d need to do to get a degree-I hated studying. My &#039;solution&#039; to that was getting into the &#039;trades&#039;. No studying, (although unions have a great apprenticeship program for the trades) Of course there&#039;s a lot of &#039;drudge&#039; work until you become skilled at something (and drudge work even after!) but carpentry isn&#039;t really work for me, I like it still. Of course it&#039;s nice getting paid from it too-and spending the money. <br />Anytime I&#039;m depressed now, I try to stay away from anything, because often it makes it worse. But I still think a decent shot of opiates would (temporarily) &#039;cure&#039; any depression. <br />But of course you&#039;ll eventually get a &#039;habit&#039; which turns into a hell of it&#039;s own. But I guess you could get into methadone, I think MMT (methadone maintenence treatment) is around $300-$400 a month. But I got tired of that too, and it&#039;s difficult to get &#039;off&#039; of unless you taper down over a long period. <br />I think it was Abraham Lincoln who said that people usually are about as happy as they decide that they want to be (that was a paraphrase)<br />They&#039;ve done studies of people who&#039;ve won the lottery, and their happiness before and after. Eventually their ecstasy after winning lowers down as they get used to the money and their &#039;happiness&#039; stabilizes. <br />For some &#039;intellectual&#039; healthy thinking, I remember reading &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; (Ernest Becker 1975) and learned a lot. Learned that for instance everybody wants to be a hero (probably a factor for why they don&#039;t have a shortage of suicide bomber &#039;volunteers&#039; in Islamic countries) and I read a lot of other info in there that I thought was kind of relevant to me (I just tried to find it on my bookshelf, I don&#039;t seem to be able right now-but what I call a bookshelf most other people would call a mess of papers, books and miscellaneous shit.)<br />Traditionally Man (I mean the female hominid too, of course) has found solace in philosophers like Plato (I had a book named &quot;Plato, not prozac&quot; which I never read but which is laying around here somewhere). There&#039;s also a saying that happiness consists of &#039;something to do, someone to love, and something to look forward to&#039;. <br />I think that young people often have problems with depression. I kinda figured out why I was depressed (but it took me 30 years) and you of course can take anti-depressants (which I still do-I take Wellbutrin) and/or the talking &#039;cure&#039; (I was able to get a mental health therapist through the county health system for 1-1/2 years) but I suppose that society has lessened that option because of the cost of talking to somebody with a lot of education (most mental health therapists at least have a Masters or Ph.D if they are not a MD). If you have money, I would think successful suicide rates are lower (although just guessing) if you can get real professional help. <br />If you don&#039;t have any siblings or close friends, that can be a factor in depression all by itself. <br />My worst days were often after a night of heavy drinking and having a bad hangover. That and some bad &#039;situational&#039; circumstances (I wasn&#039;t working, money was &#039;tight&#039;, and I had few friends) led to a few times where I did think &#039;To be or not to be&#039; (Hamlet considering suicide in a Shakespearean play)<br />And I&#039;ve had extended periods of &#039;sobriety&#039; (which helped in my earlier years)&nbsp; but I&#039;ve heard a person say, &#039;better you get high to get out of your depression than to commit suicide, you can always get another sobriety date (a date when you stop taking alcohol/drugs) so I know THAT doesn&#039;t work for everybody too. <br />Ketamine had a big influence on me, although I only got high once (REALLY high, though) I had an experience where I was squished up with every other living thing, until I was part of this HUGE living thing that existed, but wasn&#039;t comprised of any particular identity, and it wasn&#039;t &#039;stuck&#039; in time. It was just this HUGE intelligent mass and I realized then that I was a part of the universe. and I had a certain amount of time on this earth, and that after I died, I&#039;d be squeezed back into this &#039;consciousness&#039; and that my life really was a very small event in the grand scheme of things (that may be the reason that psychiatrists are called &#039;shrinks&#039;-shrinks of the Ego) . As Don Juan learned in the various Carlos Castaneda books (fiction but fascinating-Castaneda&#039;s books titles are The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan, A Separate Reality, Tales of Power and more) Don Juan tells the guy to use death as a guide to living. In other words, use the fact that life is temporary in order to guide your wanderings and your philosophy while you&#039;re alive, these are the main things. <br />I&#039;ve been in a lot of uncomfortable circumstances (mostly my fault, but some not-it doesn&#039;t make a difference in the end) but your attitude towards your surroundings can be a lever towards enlightenment, JMHO.<br />

				As for me, I had really strong suicide thoughts only twice in my life. And both were bad trips :) Once on LSD+MDMA and second was changa.<br /><br />I would be VERY cautious when giving a drug to suicidal person. I guess it would be better to avoid psychedelics and stick to MDMA-like stuff.

				I suppose it differs by situation really. If someone is intent on committing suicide there is little you can do to prevent that. As i live on the 15th floor the option of jumping over the railing is universally available, but other run in front of trains, or make their way onto tall buildings to jump anyway. About a year ago someone actually jumped off the building in live in (from the 16 th floor). This person was not a resident but just followed someone in or rang a doorbell with a good excuse.<br /><br />Many people that are committed to ending their life do so in a foolproof way: jump from great height, step in front of a train, run into heavy traffic and such. Very few actually resort to using drugs on serious attempts, mostly because that often fails. Surely you could down 100 mg of valium with a bottle of wine, but that is not likely to kill you at all - its just a call for attention (or cause of a nasty hangover). <br /><br />For those that are truly committed to ending their own life i would probably state that trying any drug may be a good idea. Mostly the worst possible side effect of drugs is death, and if that does occur, you aren&#039;t off any worse ;)<br />

				im not sure recommending psychedelics when someone is suicidal is such a great idea, considering how important set and setting and mindset are to a trip. i did mushies once when depressed and it wasnt good at all.<br />mdma might help initally but afterwards you are screwed. <br />much better would be trying to work trough their issues with therapy, meditation, exercise and good food, and when ready taking some psychedelics to further explore why they are feeling the way they are. <br />

Perhaps the sensation that it is possible to feel -that- good may prevent you from committing suicide right then and there. On the other hand, becoming a junky and living for several years like that may be a fate worse than instant death - everyone gets this choice.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br /><br />I insufflated heroin over a period of time during a day as part of a suicide plan.&nbsp; At a certain point the heroin helped me question what I was doing, and change my mind about it.&nbsp; I think it was the emotional calmness I had from it.<br /><br />That was my only time doing heroin, and I don&#039;t plan on ever doing it again &#039;cause I find it fucking scary.<br /><br /><br />-PB
