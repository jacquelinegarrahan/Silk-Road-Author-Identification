				Like all drugs I assume. Dependent on dosage.<br /><br />Oral - Longer onset, intense come up, longer plateau, longer comedown/lasting --- Also take stomach content into account. Great to roll face and dance your pants off.<br />Nasal - Quicker onset, less intense come up, weaker plateau , faster comedown/lasting --- Unlikely to absolutely roll face, or at least I haven&#039;t. I prefer it when wanting to socialize lots.<br />Rectal - Not sure? Probably similar to more intense than oral. Might feel good with a BJ? :P

				If want to get super duper long rolls, try taking two teaspoons of sodium bicarbonate dissolved in water (baking soda).<br />It will make you feel the &quot;MDMA effects&quot; for up to seven hours. Not kidding, baking soda is the real shit with MDMA and amphetamines.

I&#039;ve seen stranger things, I used to live next to a girl that would come and trip with me a lot and if we took a few tabs of lsd she would put one in her mouth and one in her pussy. She said it burned a bit but I&#039;d usually kiss it and make it feel better.

Wet farts are not an issue. I use 2ml of water, and lie down on my stomach until I come up. The water is all absorbed by then. Absorbing water is your rectum&#039;s job, so it takes up 2ml pretty fast.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why people think it&#039;s so horrible. It doesn&#039;t hurt, it doesn&#039;t upset your stomach, and you feel stronger effects from the same amount of drug. You don&#039;t have to shove your finger up there... just use an oral syringe and throw it out when you&#039;re done with it.<br /><br />I&#039;m a heterosexual male, and I find the feeling of MDMA taken rectally to be slightly erotic.<br /><br />I&#039;d really advice against doing it IM for the following reasons:<br />1.) It would likely hurt like fucking hell. Medicines that are *meant* to be used IM hurt, and MDMA tends to burn a lot when used nasally, so I could only imagine what it would feel like in your muscle tissue.<br />2.) People don&#039;t realize, but IM is generally less safe than IV. If you have even a little contaminate in the substance you&#039;re injecting, it will get stuck in your deep muscle tissue. This can lead to very serious infections that require major surgery or amputation to fix. If you&#039;re to the point where you&#039;re willing to stick a needle in yourself, just IV. (speaking in general about drugs, not specifically MDMA here). With IV, you run less risk of deep infection, and you only have to stick the needle in a couple milimeters, as opposed to an inch or more.

				Do people seriously think that squirting a bit of water up your arse will turn you gay? Maybe I&#039;m just more open minded than most, but plugging is honestly no harder than eating the drugs. There&#039;s no mess, it&#039;s quick and it doesn&#039;t hurt. If you&#039;re comfortable with your sexuality then the &quot;gay&quot; thing that some people are so preoccupied with doesn&#039;t even cross your mind. <br /><br />

				For real, anyone that&#039;s so afraid of plugging is either insecure about their sexuality or just immature. Having your prostate examined is so much worse but it&#039;s not like it makes you gay. :P Also for those of you worried about what your mates might think about you, just don&#039;t fucking tell them. ??? Besides you&#039;re taking drugs, it&#039;s not their business to know in the first place so who cares?

				I have long history of sticking things in my ass... drugs as well. In my experience, the bioavailabilty of MDMA or MDA is high enough orally. There seems to be no real advantage to rectal, other than a quicker come up and peak. The effects of rectal do not outlast oral and, in my opinion, doesn&#039;t neccessarily feel any stronger.

If so, I guess you would need to lie there for a while, if not, you would be good to go.<br /><br />Since I am doing drugs and am pretty open minded I may have to try it next. A friend stuck a pill up his butt and said that the peak was more intense, dont know about the comedown though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol my bumhole is innocent and untouched, im pretty open-minded too(not in a gay sense, fuck that) so i might try the oral syringe way, just gotta do it without my mates finding out haha<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Start with a smaller dose than you normally use. My friend decided to plug his first time. He ended up projectile vomiting on the come up. He had a fantastic roll though. That might of just been him though, because another of my friends tried plugging and got some naseua but nothing compared to my first friend. They used the same dose too. Personally i&#039;ll stick to snorting my molly. that&#039;s the best way to take it imo. There is just something about how it feels going up my nose that flip&#039;s the &quot;roll&quot; switch in my brain.

Do you guys all just let that shit rip anytime it happens no matter where yer at. The movies with yer girl? Dinner with yer family. Just try to hold it in for like 30 seconds.

				I would be up for taking less MD to get the same high, if only it wasn&#039;t so hard to explain if you got caught plugging it in the toilet at a club or rave&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />For me its got to be oral. I hate sniffing substances that are considered best to sniff, like coke, so the burning from MD is just awful.

				Oral- probably the easiest and safest method of ingesting mdma. Dosage is usually around 100 mg and placed in a capsule which is taken like a pill. My personal favorite method is simply crushing the crystals (dosage pre weighed) out on the counter and simply mixing the powder into a glass of water or soft drink. The high is the most euphoric of the three and probably what is referred to when people talk about taking &#039;ecstasy&#039;.<br /><br />Nasal- Another commonly used method of ingesting mdma. Dosage is probably slightly less than oral however approximately 100 mg snorted throughout the course of the night is common place. The actual chemicals will burn the inside of your nose so be careful as the pain and tearing can be intense. The roll is also much more intense however less euphoric imo and slightly shorter in duration. <br /><br />Rectal- Haven&#039;t tried this method however it is popular and according to most very effective. Dosage is usually a pill or if dealing with mdma crystals then I was say maybe 80mgs in a capsule as the come up and subsequent plateau can be very intense.
