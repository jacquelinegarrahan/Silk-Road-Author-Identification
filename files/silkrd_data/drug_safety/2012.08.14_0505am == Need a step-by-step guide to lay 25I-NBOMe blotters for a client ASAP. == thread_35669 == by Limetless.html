				Hey Lim - I know I&#039;ve told you how to make a solution at a certain concentration before.&nbsp; So I hope you remember how to do that.<br /><br />Otherwise, what you need to do is figure out how much a blotter holds (in liquid).&nbsp; Get a few sheets, put one into a dish that fits it, and drop water into it to see how much is required until the sheet is fully saturated.&nbsp; For me I think it was something like 3ml.<br /><br />Now, prepare a solution with your desired concentration.&nbsp; If you want 100mg on the sheet...you want 33.3mg / ml (at least, in my example).&nbsp; Drop the solution on, let it dry.&nbsp; Done!<br /><br />I personally went a step further and added food coloring to my solution to make sure that it dried evenly.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want the edges being super intense or anything...

I have made tabs before but it was years ago and I&#039;m not a pro or anything at it and this guy wants to do it right. I sold him 15g of the stuff so it&#039;s not like it&#039;s a small amount.
