				So my friend and I are planning on doing a &quot;God&quot; trip. Saturday we both have off work and we want to have the trip of a lifetime because I am moving out very soon.<br /><br />We have at our disposal:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 oz shrooms<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50 hits LSD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;200mg Ketamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1g DMT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2g MDMA<br /><br />Obviously we will not use every single gram of that, but that&#039;s what we are working on. I am afraid that the body will not be able to handle everything. But our idea is to dose on LSD, then shrooms, then molly. Then while we are peaking ~2 hrs later, ascend into hyperspace on DMT, then dose on K after the come down to go into the hole (low tolerances for K). And maybe throw some nitrous in there somewhere. <br /><br />Neither of us have done a combo this audacious. But we both have LOTS of experience with the individual drugs and even some combos (Hippy flip, Candy flip, Jedi mind flip)<br /><br />So... fun night or terrifying night?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				That&#039;s a lot of substances that can have unforeseen interactions. Benzos are HIGHLY recommmended if you intend to mix the substances mentioned.<br /><br />If you are new to any of these substances, DO NOT mix them, as you may experience an allergic reaction, learn that you are deficient in an enzyme required to metabolise one of the said substances. Be careful with cocktails, and never attempt shaking or stirring one up without extensive knowledge and experience. The fact that you&#039;re posting this tells me that you should second think your plans.<br /><br />I have a&nbsp; lot of experience with cocktails, but more on the narcotics side of things, not psychedelics/dissociatives (although MDMA and K created pseudo hallucinations that made the night sky look 10x nicer than the northern lights could ever appear).<br /><br />IMO LSD is liable to be destroyed if you mix it with mushrooms, so appreciate the LSD on its own (I love lsd, but don&#039;t like shrooms unless I&#039;m drunk; very unstable for me, whereas acid is very stable after you passs the come-up).<br /><br />I would take the mdma and lsd together, as they make a great combo, but leave the K out... that can really fuck your mind up with the synergy of M and LSD. The DMT should be fine as well. It&#039;s short lived and there are plenty of reports of the combo.&nbsp;

				Good to know, if I need some benzos I&#039;ll go to you&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know LSD and shrooms kind of diminish each others effects. I went to see my favorite band play live on 2g shrooms, 200ug LSD, and 140mg Molly and it was the best thing I have experienced.

				Seems like you guys are going to a have a really good time! So please update us on an exclusive trip report ^^<br /><br />LSD + Shrooms + DMT can work really well for you, Anyway i think you should start with some acid and shroomies and see what goes. as far as the K i think you should leave it out of the equation for this time, As what goes with MDMA i&#039;m not really sure but maybe you should prep it just in case you feel like too ;D, After you toke on DMT things can get real serious !!(Lets say the effect won&#039;t be the usual 10-15 min) <br /><br />And get some weed ! cheers man goodluck&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				I was at a festival with my bud and he dosed on shrooms and acid and then we went on a walk. And the opportunity arose for us to partake in the spiritual journey that is DMT. I let him go first and watched his face. Laid back and had the biggest smile I&#039;ve ever seen on someone. After ~30 mins he opens his eyes and says &quot;You don&#039;t know how happy I am right now.&quot; Looked like he had a blast!! I wouldn&#039;t mind trying that&nbsp; ;D

				The Ketamine is the one to leave out IMO, anyone whose experienced it&#039;s synergistic effects wold probably agree or strongly disagree because they happened to fucking love the combo. But hey, you can always do small bumps and take it slow.

				DMT on acid has always made me paranoid and I&#039;ve tried it 4 times&nbsp; :(<br />Meanwhile Ket on acid and/or MDMA is really fun, I like that the body effect is similar to the DMT, but it provides no where near the <br />intensity in visuals that DMT does (DMT on acid makes my visuals solid, like I can&#039;t tell whats real and whats the trip - That said I&#039;ve only ever done it with MAOIs as well)<br />IMO<br />Drop 4-5 tabs each, redosing 2 tabs every 2-3 hours, roll at the end of the 2nd day, reupping only once at T+2H<br />Use K bumps as you see fit, and try some small doses of DMT before attempting to break through <br />(HAVE BENZOS READY THIS SHIT GETS INTENSE)<br />If you feel the need add some shroomies in on the first day about the 1st or 2nd redose of acid. IMO the 2nd so you have a chance to experience the K and DMT first. And save a little bit of K for when you are rolling, that combo is a tried and trusted combo.
