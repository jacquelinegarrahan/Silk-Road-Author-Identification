				ok simple question i think, whats are the main differences in effect between ketamine and mxe? i have done ket a few times now and keep coming across mxe in the menu, so i ordered a gram of it to see what the difference is. i also need to know do i snort it the same as ket? i have had ket of 3 vendors and only ever found a hole once with freds ket, hes out of stock so thought id give this a bash instead.

				even though mxe is an analog of ketamine, i don&#039;t think there is much of a comparison.&nbsp; you&#039;ll hear all the kiddies around here talking about &quot;m-holing&quot; but its really not worth it dude.&nbsp; it feels like shit, imo, lasts a long time and makes you feel wicked hung over the next day.&nbsp; ketamine is magic; if you&#039;ve done enough of it, i shouldn&#039;t have to explain this to you.&nbsp; crazy shit happens on ketamine.&nbsp; MXE just makes you space out.&nbsp; i think its more accurately compared to DXM.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;ve never snorted mxe.&nbsp; my wife did once and said it was disgusting.&nbsp; i usually just drop 7 to 15mg under my tongue for a nice buzz.&nbsp; 25-40mg if i plan on laying down in the dark listening to music.&nbsp; anything above that starts to feel uncomfortable to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />also, MXE doesn&#039;t cut off your motor skills like ketamine, so if you&#039;re totally whacked out on a lot of MXE, you could potentially start walking around and doing stupid shit.<br /><br />use ketamine for when you want a transformative experience.&nbsp; use MXE when you want a spacey buzz.

				yeah thats very interesting im not sure if i want to do it now, i love the crazy shit that happens on ket, the way it makes sounds seem different, like the last time i took it there was road works going on outside my house and it sounded mental, but i have tried ket of 4 vendors now fartbomber, nbome, fred and project 4 and i only managed to hole on freds stuff, hes out of stock so thought id try mxe instead, i was told it courses deeper more powerful holes but i find the after effects of ket last long enough, the one time i did hole was magical i was not even aware that my body was there, it made me think about my contentiousness and where my thoughts come from in a deep weird sort of way, i loved it but after that i have tried 3 other vendors and couldn&#039;t even get close to a hole, i will order of fred again when i see his listings back up and maybe give this mxe a miss.

				I finally tried MXE the other night along with small dose of methylone.&nbsp; About 50 mg MXE snorted, 100 mg methylone oral, plus beer.&nbsp; Reminded me of good ole robotripping without the pissing out your asshole experience.&nbsp; Motor functions not as impaired either.&nbsp; I should mention I like DXM but the next day hangover is too much anymore.&nbsp; I felt pretty good the day after on the MXE.&nbsp; I would love to try ketamine but a bit too pricey for me, I&#039;d try PCP given the chance too.&nbsp; Once in Philly I bought a dipped cigarette outside a small music venue/bar from a local &quot;businesswoman&quot;, smelled&nbsp; a bit like kerosene maybe and the filter had busted off.&nbsp; I kinda woosed out hitting it hard, the idea of being fucking spun in ghetto Philly (the type of neighborhood where chinese food is slid through a slot in bullet proof glass and you &quot;tip&quot; neighborhood folk to &quot;watch&quot; your car.&nbsp; Not sure if it had much effect as I was pretty fucking drunk.

				i&#039;ve been experimenting with MXE for the last few months off and on. i don&#039;t remember if i&#039;ve done ketamine, i don&#039;t think i have, so i dont really have a reference of comparison to it. i prefer to do MXE alone while listening to music or watching a movie. i also take 1mg xanax with it occasionally. always have zyprexa on hand if you&#039;ve never done it before (incase you take too much). A little MXE goes a long way.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that insufflating it hits you faster, but it takes a little bit more. Oral administration requires a little less. i usually wet my finger, dab it in the mxe, and then wash it down with a beverage.&nbsp; careful not to do too much, you can always do more if you don&#039;t feel anything, but you can&#039;t do less if you&#039;ve took too much. <br /><br />a few days ago i was able to stay awake for over 40 hours by taking small amounts of MXE every few hours or so, and felt no signs of fatigue or drowsiness - mentally alert.&nbsp; &nbsp;What i like about it, is that it helped me stay awake, but you dont get that comedown or antsy, tweaky, restlessness that amphetamines give you. I enjoy staying up all night on it and watching the sunrise.&nbsp; MXE sunrise are the best. You feel like the day is starting for you and that its going to be a good day.<br /><br />a couple months ago i took a little too much and i was at a party around people i did not know, and everyone was like &quot;whoa, whats wrong with that guy&quot;.&nbsp; and i didn&#039;t have any (or didnt think about taking) xanax or zyprexa to help calm me down, but i felt a really overbearing sense of anxiety and worry about everything. so i won&#039;t be doing that at social events again.<br /><br />overall, i feel that it does give me a more optimistic outlook on life and can help if you&#039;re feeling depressed. i also feel that it<br />makes me more mindful of the path i need to go down in life, whereas before i was more unsure and felt i had no identity and did not know myself.&nbsp;

				Their very different, Ketamine is a lovely great drug but MXE is horrible in my opinion, i cant understand how people like it, ive tried it a few times and all it did was make me totally zone out and become totally unpersonal and unemotional, it felt as if i was just a piece of meat with no brain or thoughts stuck in time going nowhere, its downright horrible imo, but different strokes for different folks eh! <br />

				Soooo, here&#039;s my story. I have several years of K experience under my belt. I&#039;m an OG K user. Hell, I used to drive home with a sleeve of Liqs (Fort Doge or Ttokkyo brand) on the front seat of my car bc it wasn&#039;t even illegal yet (late 90&#039;s). I did it every which way but sideways (IM, IV, Bumps,&nbsp; lines, etc). Never bought it unless it was in the 10ml or 30ml bottle<br /><br />Fast forward to the SR. All I heard about was MXE being &quot;similar to k&quot;...and of course K is no longer legal or easy to come by anymore. So I was soooo psyched when I saw it offered here. I got 2G&#039;s from a reputable vendor here and was extremely excited for my first bump of mxe. <br /><br />Well was I in for a surprise...holy good god! It was nothing...and I mean nothing like the beautiful K Hole I once knew. Bump 4 bump mxe was not nearly as clean, nor quick to come and go like the high from K. With MXE...I constantly felt like I was messed up...but couldn&#039;t really figure out the high (i know my psychedelics as well). And an even bigger problem...was that the stuff lasts foreverrrrrrrr. OMG...after you do your thing, whether it be roll and bump...hang at the house, go to the club...the side effects just last and last.<br /><br />My opinion...and my opinion only...is that MXE in no way felt like K to me. It definitely isn&#039;t child&#039;s play...the shit is strong...but I will not be doing it again. MXE and K are not similar.

				I got a good amount of MXE awhile back before i tried K, in my opinion they are different high&#039;s. MXE is quite pleasant in small dose&#039;s (the only kind of dose i ever did with it I&#039;m not a big dissociative fan). In small dose&#039;s i found it act similar to an anti-deppresant and just make&#039;s you feel happy. i wouldn&#039;t say it has exactly a stimulant effect, you don&#039;t feel very stimulated while on it,&nbsp; it can just make it difficult to fall asleep if you take it at night. Overall i wouldn&#039;t say its a shit drug, but i could see how you would get to that conclusion if you took to much or went on a long binge.<br />

Once I took about 150-200 mg (eyeballing - I find it hard to control myself when I&#039;m on it). I do not remember half of the trip. I had redness in the chest and face. I aspired to people on the street and was delirious. My friend was scared for my life at that time. It seems was like PCP, according to the videos on YouTube.<br />But despite this... my favorite drug. <br />It is a pity that so few sellers MXE here at SR.<br />I tried ketamine, but I do not understand it. I would describe K in one word - &quot;gray&quot;.<br />MXE is much more fun.

Pfff...I quietly said to myself as I cooked it up and proceeded to do a monster rail of K like it was Coke. Within minutes I was in a mini K-hole confused as fuck. Annnnnd I didn&#039;t touch K again for a month or so. Then I properly dosed and realized MDMA and K worked synergistically and it was love ever after.<br /><br />MXE...I&#039;m not sure how much I dosed my first time, but it was your typical &quot;bump&quot; on back of hand between thumb and index knuckle. I think I did .20mg my first time...but that was at the end of a roll from a very good hit of E...and it literally just killed the end and drug out the tweak part. <br /><br />Tried again with my buddy (3 bumps over 2 hours this time) and that is when I called it a wrap. We sat on my couch almost at trip state...but completely were non-functional. That led to no balance and one projectile vomit at about 8 hours in. I weighed the bag the next day and I didn&#039;t even break past 1.5mg.<br /><br />Power to you mxe vets...maybe if I did the lovely Kitty, I wouldn&#039;t like it anymore??? Our bodies and brains to change.
