				There has been papers on depression and ketamine and drugs are being developed to try and act like ketamine to be fast acting antidepressants. I personally wouldn&#039;t use it to treat depression though. I generally have a nice trip. Find the K hole if I do enough but it doesn&#039;t do much to my mood.<br /><br />Also self medicating isn&#039;t generally a good idea.<br /><br />I assume you&#039;re on antidepressants? Tried CBT?

				Thanks for that link Zip, I&#039;m about to read that right now.<br /><br />@OP, I don&#039;t know the source of your depression but I decided to give ketamine a go recently in hope of reigning in depression and severe mood swings brought on from discontinuing regular stimulant use.<br />Here&#039;s another interesting article where it was used to treat a type of bipolar disorder in children with great success.<br />http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/03/25/174928768/how-an-unlikely-drug-helps-some-children-consumed-by-fear<br /><br />There&#039;s a link to the original publication at the end of that article. I followed the dosing range and schedule in that publication (up to 125 mg every 3 days) with very satisfying results.

				low dosages. low dosages were used in the studies that found an antidepressive effect for ketamine.<br /><br />As for using LSD to treat depression... yes LSD can be helpful in therapeutic settings to treat depression by giving a person a new perspective on life, but since LSD therapy is illegal...and people would be most likely tripping alone... i would recommend against it... having personally had bad trips... that made my depression worse......

Also begin on an empty stomach as people new to K often get queasy otherwise.<br /><br />We&#039;d also point out we&#039;ve seen a lot of people use ketamine and not really seen it effectively been used for depression, but then you could also argue we&#039;re usually around recreation users than those who are using it medically.

				Speaking from experience, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this as a long term plan.<br /><br />Ketamine does have good antidepressant properties - this is absolutely true. It also has some very strong other properties though, like - being completely off your face. Its a difficult one for every day use if you want to be a functioning human being. You can maintain yourself on low doses but you&#039;ll have to re-dose often. <br /><br />Also, long term daily use will probably eventually cause you to have bladder and stomach problems (again, speaking from experience). This is different for everyone, some users take years to develop these symptoms, others months. If you&#039;re just interested in experimenting with it, then go for it - but start small, very small. Like 10mg. Also, don&#039;t judge it on the first few days - as with most dissociatives there&#039;s a kind of &quot;break through&quot; period. Its usually about a week for me, before I really get to grips with it. Im not sure of the science behind this, but its almost like your body needs to learn how to process the stuff, and adapts accordingly. After about a week you&#039;d be better equipped to make a judgement of whether it was working for you or not. <br /><br />Now, with all this said - I don&#039;t actually think K is the way forward. I few years ago I would have agreed. But since MXE appeared, I think this would probably be a better bet for you (if you can get your hands on good quality MXE). It has a longer half life (so you only need to re-dose every 2-4 hours), and doesnt have the same trippy effects as K does at low doses. Your speech will also be less slurred. Its just generally more stealthy. And the best part - it also has a MUCH more notable anti-depressant effect. <br /><br />I can literally quantify this.... if i&#039;m doing MXE for a few days, and I do some K, the K will actually bring me down. I&#039;ve been daily using MXE pretty much since it became available (with a 5 month break after the ban), and ive observed no negative effects on my health other than dehydration. So yeah, much better if your serious about self medicating. <br /><br />One thing I will say though - is that BOTH of these substances are addictive. Not physically, but mentally. They&#039;re also very morish. So it requires a strong will to manage your dosage without going over the top. Your tolerance will increase either way, but you should try to keep your consumption down as much as possible. I take a week or two break every couple of months - just to know I can. <br /><br />Finally, for some extra info on MXE&#039;s antidepressant value, you might be interested in this article: CLEARNET: http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/interview-with-ketamine-chemist-704-v18n2 <br /><br /><br />Good luck 8)

Ketamine&#039;s antidepressant effect isn&#039;t due to you being high but because it reverses neurological damage, so you get more neuronal connexions, which alleviate depression. At least that&#039;s what the study I read said. They didn&#039;t say why the effect only lasted up to 10 days though, but the effect is definitely not because of you being high. And it wasn&#039;t k-holing once a week either a dose enough to cause some noticeable intoxication like 50mg insufflated I&#039;d say, or 25mg IV.

				10 mg orally is extremely small, I&#039;d suggest more like 40-50mg orally if you wanna go that route. If you snort it you could take little doses like 20mg and it&#039;d work I think.

				Preliminary results from a 10mg line:<br />my depression has subsided greatly, for the first time in months I opened my blinds, looked at the world with a positive outlook and gave off a genuine smile. As a meditator, I know myself and my depression very well, even the smallest changes in my attitude or brain activity would be noticed. So I can say the disease has **definitely** been &#039;treated&#039; by the ketamine. If only this was permanent!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				Funny, just logged in to the road to document my experience with K. Forgive me to repost, but this really belongs here too:<br /><br />Roughly four months passed now, I still have 1/2g left and kept book about my use. I always snort it.<br /><br />Some statistics:<br /><br />total amount of times used: 12<br />total amount of material used: 580mg<br /><br />average time-span between uses: 9 days<br />average amount of material used: 50mg<br />&nbsp;<br />numbers in parenthesis show the next value, if you remove longest and shortest time span, highest and lowest amount of material<br />shortest time span between uses: 3 days (7)<br />longest time span between uses: 16 (15)<br /><br />highest amount used 90mg (80)<br />lowest amount used 10mg (10)<br /><br />I read about the mind-blowing effect of ketamine on depression. My impression is, that I use K subconsciously to treat my depression. The cravings have gone so far, I stopped thinking about K. But from time to time I get the very obvious feeling I want to use K now. The last two or three experiences I was really tired when I used K and fell asleep about 30 minutes into the trip. My overall life-satisfaction has increased drastically. I lost a lot, if not all, social anxiety, I got a job in April with a really good perspective and I grew up a lot. I want a relationship now instead of just fucking around... All in all, I have a life now! I found new interests, started to work on long-term goals, job-wise as leisure-time wise. And I fulfill them. I learned to control my affection and I can delay things like playing computer games if I have more important things to do. To be honest, this text just developed because I was too bored playing my MMORPG ;)<br /><br />I play with the idea of ordering another g just to have some material at hand to treat any surprise-symptoms. I think I have no problem with K, but will monitor my usage closely.&nbsp; <br /><br />K might sound like a wonder drug now, but I changed a lot of my habits, worked hard on myself and had a tough time. You can follow my development in my other posts, about a year ago I was just a shadow of myself today. Allthouhg, used wisely, I think K can help you a lot to get back on track. It can wreck you though, without question, too.

				I could not say whether it helped with depression; as I understood it it was in a controlled medical environment. For me, I felt isolated, as though I were compartmentalized in a tousand clear ice-cube trays. It will be apparent as to it&#039;s use as an emergency anastetic (like in a battlefield). After 2-4 times, I got used to it, maybe even getting in a (small) K-hole. I did not find it unpleasant as all. Very dissasociative, but also very &quot;quiet&quot;, unlike Salvia, which is all motion and tentacles. I did not experience any major hallucinations. I am planning on ordering some more.<br /><br />As far as dosage: take a pile of K about the size of the visible part of a pencil erasure, and do 1/4 in each nostril. Nothing will happen for about 1.5 min, then it hits. It lasts about 1 hour, plus or minus 10. You don&#039;t have to worry that you&#039;ll quit breathing as Ketamine does not depress cardiopulminary punction (hence as emergency anastetic - where the medics don&#039;t know the victim&#039;s fluid level (have they lost too much blood, etc. All in all, I learned to enjoy it aster about 2 times; do wait a few days in between sessions.

				I&#039;ve been snorting ~50mg every 2 weeks with good results. That&#039;s just what works for me though, I&#039;m no doctor.

This is interesting to me, that the effects of the experience could linger on long after the drug has left your being. <br /><br />Theres two ways i&#039;ve known people to use K for depression. This, and the low dose and often way. <br /><br />Admittedly, this would be way better for your body. Has anybody here tried this? I&#039;d love to hear a first hand story of its success or otherwise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well all the studies I&#039;ve read were about a dose every 7 to 10 days. Ketamine&#039;s antidepressant effect isn&#039;t due to you being high but because it reverses neurological damage, so you get more neuronal connexions, which alleviate depression. At least that&#039;s what the study I read said. They didn&#039;t say why the effect only lasted up to 10 days though, but the effect is definitely not because of you being high. And it wasn&#039;t k-holing once a week either a dose enough to cause some noticeable intoxication like 50mg insufflated I&#039;d say, or 25mg IV.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think when I read about this it was a really long time ago. Like many years ago. I remembered it being a proposal though, rather than a tried and tested method. Its cool to hear its working for people - I&#039;m still totally baffled by the science of it though. I&#039;d heard of people trying it on forums and the like, but nothing concrete to say it worked. <br /><br />I once read a story about someone who had suffered from lifelong depression (no idea what country it referred to) - and as a last resort they gave the lady a controlled K trip. I think it was a significant dose of IM ketamine - in a bid to &quot;reset&quot; her thinking. Apparently it worked. May or may not have been total bullshit though - it wasn&#039;t an academic report, just a story that was published. Wish I could find it now though.

				Depression is a fickle creature. Sometimes one type of drug works for an individual, but it has no effect on depression in another person. After being diagnosed most patients cycle 2-3 SSRIs before finding one or a combination that works for them. <br /><br />Good to see it worked for OP though.
