				Hi all,<br /><br />There is some aspect of being high on LSD which I&#039;ve yet to understand how it&#039;s possible to happen, and it&#039;s meaning, and if anyone knows anything further on the subject it would be greatly appreciated if they could share:<br /><br />Certain music / videos on Youtube appear to be enhanced, or appear to gain the significance intended by their authors only through the intoxication of LSD. <br /><br />I&#039;ll give you 2 examples:<br /><br />1) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpKXnrmwNT8<br /><br />The background artwork to this song seems to come alive in something magnificent / holographic, better than what the best 3D TV can do. And I wonder, why is it possible for me to perceive the magnificence behind these still images only while on LSD, and what is the meaning of them? And I&#039;m not talking about some pseudo effect that doesn&#039;t exist - there are actually pictures here (for example a figure clearly coming out of the screen through one of those stills).<br /><br />2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNcSksHu258&amp;feature=related<br /><br />This is a binaural beat that is supposed to help in meditation - and perhaps astral projection. When I checked a few of these while on LSD again the pictures gained life and started moving in 3D, and in this particular one I remember there is a figure in the center that seemed to be alive and contacting me in some way. And the different binaural beats in combination with the still pictures seemed to transfer me to different universes altogether.<br /><br />Please let me know of your thoughts, thanks!

				I&#039;m pretty confident different people see the same things in for e.g. the indigo video clip above, such as for example there is a very obvious meditating figure coming out of the picture in fully fledged 3D, i.e. that was the artists intention when he created the graphic, yet it is impossible to see unless you are high on Lucy! So my theory is that Lucy in some way strengthens the brain to encode things that look fuzzy or random for a non Lucy intoxicated brain.

If the artist put something in the graphic that is intended to be seen by all, of course everyone will see it. But not everyone sees the same shit when they&#039;re on LSD. My friend and I will dose the same, and we&#039;ll both see different visuals, or see different patterns in the shadows. Drugs effect everyone differently.

				In a similar way, I&#039;ve had numerous experiences where friends say they see something and I then see the exact same thing instantly, works vice versa as well.

				Hahah guys just watch the indigo children video clip at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpKXnrmwNT8 and you&#039;ll know what i&#039;m talking about.<br /><br />For example at 5:10 there is a very clear meditating figure coming out of the picture in full 3D when you are high on LSD, but when I look at it now it&#039;s just some fuzzy lines. <br /><br />So for now I stick to my theory that LSD kind of opens up our brains to see things more &quot;clearly&quot; and not just fuzzy, random things like other drugs.

				ever notice more of a song while tripping? Like with NIN, there&#039;s some cool ass stuff going on below the higher volume parts of the music. The really cool part is you can still notice these things years after having not tripped.

				Ok, so I think the intention here isn&#039;t unidentified effects, but reproducible effects, which I find interesting myself. I think there might be several phenomenons that can be reproduced while on acid (i.e. a big percentage of people have them, and have them on a big percentage of their trips).<br /><br />Mine are:<br />1) I can see a trail of mouse pointers on the screen. It&#039;s just like the computer effect where the mouse pointer leaves a trail, but without the computer making the effect :)<br />2) I had this once or twice, but I saw more people having this - when looking at text, it seems to swirl around as if the letters were beads on a string and the string was being moved from both of its edges.<br />3) I&#039;ve also seen enhanced videos. If I can reproduce the effects I will post them.<br /><br />I will try the things the original poster posted, but I&#039;m interested if anyone has had other reproducible effects?
