				Hello my darlings. :)<br /><br />I have taken ecstacy pills before, (orange, 007/gun) and the experience was amazing. I am almost certain there was some kind of psychedelic drug pressed with the pills I took before, though, because it was a very intense visual experience as well as physical.<br /><br />But on Saturday night, I took 100mg of tan MDMA, and I was entirely underwhelmed. I mean, I felt really nice, I felt increased empathy, I felt a steady rush of energy, but the feeling wasn&#039;t &quot;ecstasy&quot;, you know? And what confuses me is the entire time, I kept thinking &quot;This feeling is exactly like being on pain pills.&quot;, and it was. I don&#039;t know about everyone else, but when I&#039;m on pain medication, I feel empathetic &amp; have a rush of energy, but it&#039;s not like an amphetamine rush, it&#039;s as if I am eager to just get anything done, if you know what I mean. This didn&#039;t start to happen until recently(3 months or so) but now, when I take pain pills, I also experience a sort of pressure/aching in the back of my head and in my neck, coupled with nausea. I experienced those effects on MDMA as well, which I thought was strange. When I took MDMA, I expected to feel umm, i dunno.. ECSTASY? I expected to become aroused, and I expected everything I touched to feel like a baby&#039;s butt, but I didn&#039;t experience anything even remotely similar to that.<br /><br />Is it normal for that to happen, or was the MDMA I had just crappy? I didn&#039;t think MDMA was supposed to be anything like pain medication? Or could it just be that every person reacts differently to MDMA, and that was my body&#039;s response?<br /><br />Any &amp; all advice is appreciated. If anyone has any idea why I might experience headache, neck pain &amp; nausea when I take pain medication, information regarding that would be appreciated, too. <br />Thank you all.<br /><br /><br />&lt;3

				i cant tell you the why of your problems but there is actually a known system of painkilling by amphetamine, so there is a similar effect there and i have noticed it personally, as for nausea im not sure about opiate painkillers but its not uncommon with mdma or other serotonergic drugs as the 3rd 5ht receptor is in the gut and controls vomiting amongst other things. the headache and neck pain i cant really account for unless theres some sort of muscle tension associated with them but i cant say its anything ive heard of<br /><br />out of interest what pain med are you taking, is it tramadol? the serotonergic and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitive properties of it may play a part in you feeling similar effects, tramadol is a strange drug and one im not terribly keen to try myself, an opioid with some of the properties of an anti depressant drug just seems like a combo im not interested in <br /><br />also pure mdma is usually quite a different feeling compared to pills, i find it somewhat sedating myself, so youre average pill adds in a bit of a booster to take that off, be it speed or some other stimulant

				Thank you, profspudhead, all of that information is new to me. I have never taken tramadol, I experience the effects I described when I take Hydrocodone, and the neck pain/headache &amp; nausea are always FAR more intense when I take Tylenol 3 (acetaminophen &amp; codeine). I used to enjoy taking Hydrocodone and Codeine (not at the same time), but now I almost never take them because of the adverse effects. If I eat a REALLY REALLY big meal, SOMETIMES i can get the desired affects from painkillers without nausea, ect. but not very often does that even work. :/<br /><br />Anyway, back to MDMA.. Maybe I&#039;m just not someone who enjoys MDMA, I guess. I didn&#039;t /dislike/ the effects I experienced on MDMA, but they weren&#039;t what I was expecting or hoping for. Thanks again for the info. :)

				maybe thats it, im the same with coke, heard all the hype, and when i finally tried it my first words were &quot;is that it&quot; not the &quot;Whoa!&quot; i was expecting yet the people around me were telling me how amazing it was while i just sat there feeling like id had a trip to the dentist and a few pro plus, people told me online that i MUST have gotten weak coke, but i have tried it on several other occasions where some of my regular coke using friends were very impressed with the quality so i can only put it down to the fact that coke just doesnt have the effect on me that it does on others, its not out of the realms of possibility i suppose, there are people who have faulty cy p450 enzymes in their liver hence codeine is useless to them as the body never converts it into morphine as it would normally so i suppose its totally possible that there is a physical reason for it, however the chances of studies of a controlled mdma trial as a recreational drug are not likely to happen in this day and age so chances are we will never know. and as you say maybe its just not for you, everyone has preferences, people tell me how awesome onions are but no matter how many times they tell me i still puke when i eat even a tiny bit of one and have no concept of how these people view it as an essential in near every meal

				Before you jump to any conclusions, I&#039;d suggest you try again with an increased dosage.<br /><br />While Erowid lists the threshold dose for MDMA as 30mg, in my experience the threshold dose for &quot;rolling&quot; (and not just &quot;feeling something&quot;) is more like 80-90mg, depending on the person.<br /><br />Since the vast majority of &quot;molly&quot; is cut (oftentimes with inert substances, just to increase weight), 100mg of molly might only contain between 60-90mg of actual MDMA. <br /><br />So my advice would be try 150-175mg.

				100mg is a low dose, I am 6foot 175lbs and I do 150mg with a 100mg booster. The girls we go with take 125mg with 100mg booster. Also it is a pretty different roll than ecstasy, I was suprised the first time I got some off here. A lot of the e in the states has amps in it or caffeine so its a much different roll. Maybe next time get some powdered caffeine and add a little. Also push your dosage up to 150mg.

				Thanks for the advice, everyone. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely going to up my dose next time to see where that takes me. I&#039;ve also been reading about MDA, I&#039;m thinking of trying some of that! It seems like the community is almost 50/50 as far as who does like it and who doesn&#039;t. It sounds like fun to me! :P

				Extremely pure MDMA should be white crystals. The best molly I have ever had was clear and at 120 mg the euphoria was so intense it was nearly uncomfortable. A very distinct property about MDMA is the uncontrollable &quot;push&quot; to a positive mindset. Any discoloration, especially yellowing/browning indicates the chemist skipped the last purification. You should just try to increase the dosage as recommended. You should be concerned about MDMA in general, and make sure that you wait a number of weeks between dosing. The chemical is extremely stressful on the neurons and has been proven to be neurotoxic with heavy use, causing a decrease of serotonergic fiber density.<br /><br />Profspudhed, what did you mean controlled studies of MDMA as a recreational drug exactly? There have been many controlled studies simply on the effects of MDMA, from the subjective effects (discrimination from d-amp), to gender differences, to pharmacological profiles, to electrical activity. And these are excluding all the studies done on neurotoxicity and for use in psychotherapy, which are still currently underway especially for PTSD.<br />A highly recommended page: http://www.maps.org/research/

				Yeah, I have read several controlled tests run on groups of people, but most the reports I read were testing the effects of different doses, which of course has been proven to be non-linear.<br /><br />But I didn&#039;t know the brown molly wasn&#039;t pure, thank you for that information. For some reason I thought the brown molly was better than white, I don&#039;t know what made me think that.<br /><br />I use Methamphetamine heavily, and I understand prolonged use destroys dopamine receptors. Might that cause me not to feel the euphoria MDMA is supposed to have? If so, will I ever be able to feel the desired effects from MDMA, or has the depletion of dopamine by methamphetamine ruined MDMA for me?

				Its not just the dopamine circuit that is damaged by meth. Much of the &quot;pleasure&quot; is actually is due to serotonin. Since methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methamphetamine both reverse the action of the transporter and literally dump all the neruon&#039;s serotonin into the synapse, cross tolerance is very likely. Dopamine does hold a huge role in the pleasurable aspects of drugs as well, but the dopamine circuits are actually much more involved in motivation. This is why ALL drugs that increase the release of dopamine are addictive. You are literally just signaling the brain to seek that &quot;reward.&quot; <br /><br />If you are still able get high on meth than your dopamine and serotonin stores and receptor levels should be intact enough for mdma to have a discernible effect if an adequate dose is used. Since they are so pharmacologically similar though, it will be interesting to see how subjectively different the positive push will feel. Also, sometimes the discoloration is caused by cutting the substance, possibly with other drugs that may actually enhance the experience in a desirable manner. If your product is crystalline at least, the purity is likely still decent, usually around 90%, and your cross-tolerance may be more to blame than an impure product. Good luck and BE SAFE

				I would also recommend trying someone else&#039;s MDMA. I have had MDMA that was extremely underwhelming at 170 mg and I&#039;ve had M that was almost way overwhelming at 200. These were spaced out by a week, taking the underwhelming first and the overwhelming second, which should have been the opposite as the body should have built up at least a minute tolerance.<br /><br />Where I am we can get tan stuff on the streets (ish) for 40 CAD a gram, so I wasn&#039;t sure about spending the extra dough to get the stuff I see on SR, but the shit I got from Pillowtalk was amazing. Unfortunately it looks like I might have been his last legit customer as he seems to have potentially ripped some people off, but the stuff I got from him was unreal in comparison to what I&#039;ve had in the past, and I would imagine many of the other venders here have similar quality goods.<br /><br />If you report back about not liking MDMA after upping your dosage and trying some better junk, then I guess you are probably better off with either an MDMA/speed mix that you are probably getting in your E&#039;s or just go straight to speed as it&#039;s probably what you are enjoying already.

No tramadol, or any MAOI substance.)<br /><br />Have some left and it looks like I take it for my own, more for me lol.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: bc of Monoamine oxidase inhibitor has the short MAOI and nothing else...
