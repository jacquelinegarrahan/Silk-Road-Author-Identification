				So I have a problem (other than just using drugs) where I have an obsession with trying all kinds of different drugs. I have found several which i REALLY enjoyed, but no matter what I never stick to one. I always have a thought in the back of my head of searching for other new things no matter how wild, and strange they are. Because of this I have been ordering a few research chemicals and other drugs that I have no access to in real life. Are other people like this? Just always wanting to constantly try new drugs?<br /><br />Alright so onto my real question. A few drugs offered on the site such as 2c-t-x are only sold by one or two sellers. I was wondering have any of you long time users of SR seen drugs that you wish you would of tried but did not have the chance to? Think they will ever come back? What are some of the ones that you want to try before you think they&#039;ll be gone for good?<br /><br />Just trying to strike some discussion. Lets here it!<br />

I spent years learning the theory of as many drugs as I could before trying them, and once I&#039;d embarked on the practical investigation found that there was a desire to sample as many different psychotropics as safely possible. For a while I was considered by intermediate and close friends to be a fairly hefty drug user - though never an addict or junkie - though my frequency of use of any given compound was quite low. The focus was on psychedelics for a few years, and I harboured a low opinion of what I considered &quot;body drugs&quot; ( a term I&#039;d heard from R.U. Sirius and found apt) such as amphetamine and heroin, and the people who &quot;settled&quot; for them. <br />&nbsp; Those were formative and educational years for me, and in some ways I credit my exposure to mescaline and LSD with the satisfaction and success I&#039;ve since been able to derive from life, because they let me become aware that there are so many possible points of view and ways of feeling about a given issue or occurrence, and that if you don&#039;t like what your life has become, or more to the point don&#039;t like the way you&#039;re perceiving your life and the resulting emotional response that leads to, it&#039;s possible and acceptable to change your perception.<br />&nbsp; During that handful of years I researched, located, and tried lots of different drugs. In hindsight I can see that I wasn&#039;t so much fascinated with drugs but fascinated with the nature and mechanisms of human subjective perception. Because of this, and perhaps an early tendency towards psychedelics instead of less complicated and more immediately rewarding chemicals I didn&#039;t get hung up on any particular chemical, and kept moving along to the next thing. And then to nothing at all, for a while.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36142.msg413145#msg413145">Quote from: skibler on August 16, 2012, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I always have a thought in the back of my head of searching for other new things no matter how wild, and strange they are.

Just always wanting to constantly try new drugs?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; There are other people like this. I&#039;ve met dozens over the years, and I don&#039;t get out much which means there are lots more of them out there. For all I know there are still large communities of them out there. The internet has made it easier to find people of a like mind because it isn&#039;t restricted by geographical borders, so you don&#039;t need to physically meet a person to encounter them<br />You might find value in reading some of the classic literature. Peter Stafford&#039;s Psychedelics Encyclopedia is useful in its breadth, despite some of the information therein having been disproven or improved upon since it was written.&nbsp; Alexander and Ann Shulgin&#039;s PiHKAL and TiKHAL are also worthwhile.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m viewing your post through the filter of my own experience, and to me it sounds like you&#039;re curious about novelty, about the brain, about reality, and that some of this curiosity is satisfied by exploring the various mind states that psychotropic chemicals offer. Personally I think that&#039;s fine, as long as you&#039;re educated about and aware of the pitfalls inherent in such exploration. Addiction, drug-catalysed mental illness, and actual physiological damage from incautious use can all occur, and people are better placed to avoid them if they understand them in some detail.<br />&nbsp; It surprised the hell out of me when I eventually got around to it, but travelling to foreign places without a fixed itinerary or goals feels like it provides a lot of the same desired outcomes as experimenting with a variety of drugs. Later on and with the benefit of a lot of drug experience under my belt I found that other parts of what&#039;s generally considered normal life also hold such magic.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36142.msg413145#msg413145">Quote from: skibler on August 16, 2012, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Alright so onto my real question.

What are some of the ones that you want to try before you think they&#039;ll be gone for good?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>These days if I can safely get hold of a compound I&#039;m likely to want to try at some stage, if not now, I get it, and secure it in a safe place from which it can be retrieved should the desire arise. I know people who&#039;ve tried to do this an ended up consuming vast quantities instead of stockpiling them, so it apparently takes a certain kind of personality to do it, but it&#039;s been a good practice for me.<br /><br />As for chemicals becoming available again, with the excellent lack of regimentation in the developing world where organic chemistry is conducted without the same restrictions on precursors as is found in, say, the USA, chances of a compound becoming available again is pretty high, if it&#039;s made known there&#039;s a demand for it. Silk Road is a very cool development in this regard, and the Product Requests forum&#039;s probably not a bad place to start.<br /><br />Is there anything you wish you&#039;d grabbed when you could, but no longer can?

				Mercury, first thank you for such a lengthy reply. I really enjoyed reading it! I love seeing the different effects one small change in a chemical can change. I have lengthy periods of sobriety (usually forced, and necessary), but have also had periods were I use every day for weeks to months with a variety of chemicals.<br /><br />To Shifty: I agree. The only time my use has become irresponsible has been 2 or 3 times with tramadol. Not a strong opiate, and that pushed the doses way to far to the point of seizures and other bad things. This is usually when I am in a depressed state of mind.<br /><br />I have only met one other person on a drug forum that had my same sort of case who just tried new drugs constantly. Glad I am not the only one!<br /><br />Before I started using SR there were several drugs (mainly opiates and benzos) that I had a chance to get but did not have the money to, and have not seen them in my local scene since. SR re opened that opportunity for me.<br /><br />As for while on SR so far I have been sort of focusing on 2Cx chemicals, and 25x chemicals. The one that sparked this idea in my head was 25B. With one vendor going out of business for awhile and another that I have&nbsp; not had good workings with so far, I wondered if it would ever pop back up. Another is 2C-N. There is very very little information on it and I ordered from Etizolam. This was a domestic order and so far after 8 days nothing. Sorta scary. I believe this is another that might not pop up. Who knows. Any other people?

				Yer I got the same kind of thing. I have my own underlying personal rules like never smoke hard food, never iv (im&#039;s ok though.) but my affair with psychs is very limited now. Iv sorta gone off them now, I dunno whether this is from burnout or whatever but once I killed my ego I found that was the pinnacle of my life with psychs. I still trip every now and again but very occasionally like once or twice a year. Stimulants (except for cola) are boring now too. Was hooked on benzos so they&#039;re out of the question. I think phases happen with drugs, you want certain feelings for certain times in your life and choose your drugs accordingly.

				Yeah I know alot of trippers who once they experience Ego death&nbsp; they feel they are ready to stop tripping. I was a little different. My second trip ever (5 grams of shrooms at 14) caused Ego death. I was scared to death but I learned alot.

Except for an occasional dalliance I stay well away from self administered drugs if I&#039;m tending towards a grey state of mind; The sensation of being fucked up on drugs as well as fucked up on neurochemistry is a bit too balls to the wall for my comfort, and I&#039;ve learned that using chemicals to externally alter my state of mind doesn&#039;t actually help deal with the root cause of depression. I can understand people who don&#039;t feel or behave the same way, but depression is enough of a grind by itself without me applying lashings of repayment for overzealous use of chemicals.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36142.msg414042#msg414042">Quote from: skibler on August 17, 2012, 05:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have only met one other person on a drug forum that had my same sort of case who just tried new drugs constantly.

				Thanks so much for the heads up man. Defiantly keep an eye out for him on that if I dont buy 50 hits of it from Dannyboone. I decided to take a break from opiates and stimulants after this week, so i guess I will just be tripping for awhile. Drug tests are such a stress. Its now been almost 10 days i think since my 2c-n was sent... pretty sure I wont see that but I will keep my hopes up.

				Well.... to my surprise 2c-n got in the mail yesterday. I seriously did not think it would have arrived. Probably just go in my stash as I just got a job so no time for tripping on weekdays unless i do right after work.
