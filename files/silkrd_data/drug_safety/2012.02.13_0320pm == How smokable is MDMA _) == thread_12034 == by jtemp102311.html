				Not at all, it will decompose into black tar before it reaches it&#039;s vaporisation temperature and will fuck your lungs. The freebase vaporises at about 150°C but is a pretty noxious amine and I&#039;m not even sure if it would absorb into your bloodstream. <br />Just eat the stuff!

				I could have told you that! Are you a weirdo like me that has to try to smoke everything out of a meth pipe? So far, I&#039;ve tried to smoke MXE, MDMA and Mephedrone from my glass pipe and all have failed miserably. So if anyone was interested, don&#039;t try to smoke MXE or Mephedrone either. :)

				Actually hate to disagree but I have smoked MXE (half a 120 mg capcsule) from meth pipe (small happy puff type) and the kick was amazing.&nbsp; Like snorting a good line of speed and drinking a bottle of whisky. For 2-3 minutes body went numb like when you have pathedine (medicinal opiate), effect very short lived but well worth it.&nbsp; Followed up with a little meth (maybe half a point) and my usual six pack of beer and had a grand old night.<br /><br />But this is from a vendor who keeps sending me wrong things so maybe methodone or MDMA.&nbsp; But give it a go.
