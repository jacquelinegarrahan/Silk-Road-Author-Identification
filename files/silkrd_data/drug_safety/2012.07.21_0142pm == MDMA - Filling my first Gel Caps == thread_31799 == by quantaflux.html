				Picked up some of these gel caps on ebay http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/270999421559 (size 3)<br /><br />And I have 1 gram of MDMA (drNyx) crystals, crushed into a fine a &#039;powder&#039; as I could, and then I filled each one about halfway full (using the large &#039;side&#039; of the capsule), and made a total of 14 caps, from that 1 gram. Will this be enough of a dose in each one? I&#039;m not experience in taking it but I don&#039;t want a crappy hit either. <br /><br />I bought some scales but they&#039;re not sensetive enough to even detect the empty capsules on it so I can&#039;t work out how much is in each one exactly, some have a tiny bit more than others.<br /><br />Based on the info from the gel caps eBay page on the capacity: http://i.imgur.com/5b6DY.jpg (size 3)<br /><br />How do you think i&#039;ve done? Thoughts, ideas?<br /><br />Thanks guys.

				Hey Quantaflux, that&#039;s how I take MDMA too. <br /><br />Like yourself, relatively inexperienced, only used it a couple of times before, but I like to do it properly ;) <br /><br /><br />If you&#039;ve evenly divvied up the gram between 14 capsules, you&#039;ll have ~70mg in each one. <br />From my experience, and Erowid - https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_dose.shtml<br />~100mg is a good hit when taken in 2 or 3 parts during a long evening. <br /><br />So, my advice would be, take some of those 70mg caps and half them again. <br />Take 1 70mg capsule at the start of your night, and top up again later (at least an hour) with the ~35mg capsule. <br /><br />Does that sound reasonable?

I&#039;m a little annoyed it&#039;s only going to be about ~70mg in each, I was going for at least 100mg, I guess i&#039;ll take 4 of them and dump those into some of the other &#039;lower end&#039; ones at some point. I can always take two at a time if the first time isn&#039;t as good as I imagined.

				All of my close friends and I did MDMA for our first time thursday and we did .2 around 8 and then another .2 at 11 of supertrips molly and we all agreed that it was one of the best nights of our lives...<br />I was very happy with that dosage, It was intense but controllable...&nbsp;

				you should invest in at-least a .oo scale. most of these round up and can be 10 milligrams off, but it&#039;s much better then trying to eye it out. A good dose is .150 milligrams and to re-dose at half of that. Don&#039;t re-dose past that, because you are just increasing neurotoxicity, while diminishing the peak you are trying to reach. Also, make sure you use gloves while handling the gelcaps. your gelcaps will melt from the moisture of your fingers.

				I would suggest you take 2 to start then have 1 as a booster if they are only 70mg.
