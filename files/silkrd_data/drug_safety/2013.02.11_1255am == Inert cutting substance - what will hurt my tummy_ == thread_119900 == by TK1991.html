				Hello, I know this subject has been done to death and I will likely get flamed for posting it again, but:<br /><br />What (found in the common home) substances can be used to cut powder with?<br /><br />I ask because I recently bought powder alprazolam (which scares me half to death) and I want to cut it 10:1 so that instead of trying to weigh out 0.001 I can weight out 10mg instead and make some capsules.<br /><br />I know 10mg is next to nothing but I&#039;m wondering if I use flour or baking soda/powder could there be any negative effects i.e sore stomach. Also wondering if any substance is more prone to clumping, it is important to have to contents mixed evenly :)<br /><br />Thanks and much love

				You do realise flour is used in food.

				Hitting up powder with powder might give you an uneven distribution of the active chemical. i mean some hits would be stronger some weaker. <br />Using liquids would be a lot better.&nbsp; Maybe you could use alcohol? (research this! im not sure about solubility)

I wanted to find a powder that would mix evenly, I&#039;ve read that the best cutting agents are mannitol and lactose but again, then I have to go buy a bunch of extra shit. I was just more curious if anyone had any experience with this (obviously there are some, there is a shit ton of powder xanax sold on SR) and household products. I was thinking corn starch because it&#039;s so fine

				Stop being lazy and measure it volumetrically through dissolving.&nbsp; If you are going to mess with pure powder, you need to learn how to do it safely.&nbsp; It really isn&#039;t very much work after you have learned how to do it.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t be bothered, perhaps you should just buy pills?<br />

				You&#039;re logic seems to be pretty flawed, as you&#039;re missing a step at the end.. What do you propose I do with this alcohol/xanax combination, drink it?<br /><br />Has nothing to do with laziness.. I personally don&#039;t have 10 sheets of blotter to lay with benzos just sitting around the house. I do on the other hand have hundreds of capsules... <br />
