				Put it in a syringe and stick it in a vein.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like needles then do research on &quot;hydromorphone bioavailability&quot; and &quot;opiate potentiation&quot;. I think plugging has the second highest bioavailability. There are plenty of resources about what kind of pills and substances will increase a high.

				Two good sites above with lots of information. <br /><br />Shooting pills isn&#039;t wise because of the fillers unless you filter the solution really well first. <br /><br />Snorting generally works better than eating and isn&#039;t as invasive as plugging or IV. Crush it up as fine as you can and split it into several small lines so you absorb it properly and it doesn&#039;t mostly go down your throat or clog your nose.

				Google browning and see if that works for you. I tried it but didn&#039;t notice much difference than eating them but when I tried it I was already pretty strung out on high doses due to an injury.

				It&#039;s true: dilaudids have always been a high-powered IV drug...a lot like heroin, tho heroin users deny it...but in the NAOMI studies up canada for heroin-maintenance, they found that those who got dilaudids couldn&#039;t tell the difference...of course, that&#039;s IV dilaudud.<br /><br />Up until a few years ago, Knoll made the dialudids and you could crush them up and thro them in a syringe...but I guess knoll dropped out, and the dilaudids now are a lot like crushing up percocets: a pain.&nbsp; Still, can give you a good rush if you aren&#039;t too strung out.

				Actually I&#039;m pretty sure the new formula allows you to load it up in a syringe and bang it, but I could be wrong..Other then that, the insuffulation route is like 30% or 40%? Oral was lower then that..They burn like hell though when you snort them, and its really not even that great unless you bang it..get yourself some Oxy, that&#039;tll give you a nice buzz 8) 8)<br /><br />-NS
