				I am going to undergo surgery in one week. Is it safe to take MDMA prior to 48 hours before?

				No. You are going to undergo an invasive surgery, and prior to that you would be taking a substance that exhausts your body both mentally and physically. While the odds for further complications are extremely rare, why take that chance? Save the MDMA for an occasion where you are fully recuperated and healthy.

				I&#039;m with AV on this one. The real issue is that we don&#039;t have enough real science to say when the physiological effects of MDMA are on the body hours / days / weeks after the fact and if someone is cutting you open it&#039;s a bad time to find out if the drug is actually going to make a difference on how the surgery goes. A few weeks out I would probably say all right, give it a go, two days before just makes me a little worried.<br /><br />Clearly it&#039;s up to you though. Never heard of a complication but if there were complications they might not be easily tracked back to prior MDMA use.

				My friend is an anesthetist and he basically said the same thing as the 2 posters above me:<br />They are required to ask if one is under the influence, cause that might cause serious problems, but he would abstain from anything else than alcohol and weed for at least 1 week before a serious procedure.<br />Its not that its known to cause issues, but interactions between drugs and anesthetics is simply not researched and a&nbsp; far to great risk of not waking up.<br />So my advice is, skip this weekend and have a better roll next time, due to lesser tolerance.

				I&#039;d forgo it this time; also, make sure to take Vitamin C and Flavonoids before your surgery; very few surgeons today take the initiative to do so themselves, but it substantially improves recovery time/quality. Also, Copper will reduce scar formation.

				Thanks for all of your input-- you are all so wise! <br /><br />&nbsp;I realized it was a bad idea, as well after reviewing my pre-op paperwork.&nbsp; Was just so tempted to have a nice fun roll off some bad ass mdma with friends that weekend! I have been only vaporizing weed and hash oil before and after surgery and am fine and bored recovering.&nbsp; Definitely waiting patiently to get into the drugs! (responsibly of course)

				Good to hear that all went well. <br /><br />I suppose a bit of cannabis use will do no harm, but around surgery be very careful with drugs in general.<br /><br />For people that stumble upon this thread in the future: be frank with your anesthetist and other treating physicians about your drug use. Anything you discuss with them will be safe under doctor-patient confidentiality, and could be of importance. If you have, for example, a high tolerance for opiates, barbiturates or benzodiazepines, it is best you let them know about that, since it can influence decisions that must be made while you are knocked out. <br /><br />Once you are under it is very difficult to guess why medications do not work, and they have to work on assumptions that could be incorrect.
