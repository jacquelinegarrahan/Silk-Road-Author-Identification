				Ok so im getting in to psychedelics a lot more in the past few week and I decided to make the jump and try out 50mg of DMT.<br />So I pretty fucked all ready, high on 2C-B and went to arm &#039;the machine&#039; I had built early that day.<br /><br />So I stuffed the neck with steel wool and dropped the DMT in for the hole in the bottom on the pipe and began heating the neck for a little while.<br />Went to smoke the pipe and it seemed to be working. Smoke was coming out and there was a very unique taste off it.<br />Smoked as much as I could and I felt a little, Just some light visuals nothing amazing.<br /><br />What was a doing wrong?

I remember when I began attempting to smoke it, I used glass test tubes; while I did get some plasticy tasting vapor in my mouth, nothing happened- it seems to have gotten stuck along the sides of the tube.<br /><br />I tried this a few times, then tried again using the sandwich method and a hookah; this time, I certainly got the smoke in- and it hurt like hell. I coughed it out immediately, then felt very weird, alien- it was quite scary. I still didn&#039;t get high enough for an intense trip or much more than spindling visuals.<br /><br />I repeated this a few times but could never hold in the smoke long enough. In the end, I decided it wasn&#039;t worth the effort and gave the remaining powder to a friend with experience in smoking DMT.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve been told, you need to be sure you properly vaporize the drug, and keep it in your body for as long as you can. It&#039;ll hurt like hell and is very difficult to do.

				There is another thread about this same topic, and it is growing quite long. It had a good deal of info on using vape machines, and the steel-wool-and-bottle method which I have yet to figure out. It may be that you are already on a psychedelic already (2C-B), and like LSD, your brain justs hits a saturation point. Much like trying to trip on LSD 2 days in a row - it seems that the 5-HT receptors in one&#039;s brain (what LSD reacts with) need a break. There are many others who would be more knowledgeable on the last bit, but Albert Hoffman mentions this aspect of LSD in his book &quot;LSD: My Problem Child&quot;. Seems one can&#039;t OD on acid nor experience blackouts for similar reasons; again, I am not an expert on this. <br /><br />I am waiting a few days to do some DMT for the above reasons (it seems to need a &quot;rest period&quot; as well), so to answer your question, you may be doing nothing wrong.<br /><br />Happy Trips, yokes101!!!<br /><br />Oh yeah, thanks for the info zvp1014 on the DMT sandwich method - the freebase pipe worked well for me, but it does condence on the sides some.

				Look at this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.0<br /><br />A lot of useful information on how to use The Machine properly. Also go in the Deemster thread (you find the link in my sig,) for other advices on how to use The Machine or a thread in general to talk with other people that use DMT.

				Here is the thing about DMT. 50% of the time it will have no effect or very little effect. 50% of the time you will massively overdose on it and feel like you just smoked ten tons of crack. I have not been able to find the mystical in between place for DMT, and I know a lot of other people who have similar things to say about it.

N-N-DMT effect is such that the effect changes completely after a certain threshold (the so-called breakthrough) to the point that the experience before seems almost completely another substance.<br /><br />For sub-breakthrough doses, depending on the individual, the effects can range from high-doses shrooms/acid to nice visuals and nothing much more. The thing changes completely at breakthrough doses when the experience can be even too intense for many people (and along this you can also not remember anything of what happened or just in lapses). To approach DMT well you should use mediation before (so as to recollect most of the experience after) and go for a breakthrough dose and being prepared for it.<br /><br />If instead you like more the sub-breakthrough states then it is much better Changa or DMT-N-Oxide that gives you the ability to do so without problems. With DMT-N-Oxide it&#039;s very difficult to reach a breakthrough, while for Changa even if it happens the experience is anyway smoother, meaning that the shift in gear (so to speak) is much less noticeable.<br /><br />What you say indeed happens to many people that approach DMT for the first time and are not so accustomed to the control of their own subconscious mind (as with precedent working with meditation or magic). For these people it is probably much better to start off with Changa and then, after, pass to DMT-N-Oxide and lastly to N-N-DMT (if interested then on researching on a breakthrough to full speed).

				DMT, being an endogenous metabolite, is very quickly metabolized by enzymes like monoamine oxidase upon ingestion. This is why it lacks oral activity. For enough of it to reach your brain intact, you need to saturate the enzymes that would break it down on the way there; that is to say, you need to take it all in one (or at most two) hits. There is no other way. <br />Smoking (or using a lightbulb) limits the amount you can comfortably take, and is less efficient than a vaporizer.
