				Hey guys I was thinking about trying out some ketamine. I am a virgin to this so I been doing a little research. I watched this video:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QGl9Pwl2RI&amp;feature=related<br /><br />It&#039;s just a basic national geographic documentary. Can anybody tell me if this video is very accurate about Ketamine? As far as the effects go how would one compare it to cocaine? What other dug would it be closely compared to? What&#039;s the best way and the safest way to ingest it?<br /><br />Thanks guys and I&#039;m just researching this right now. After I get a few responses I will delete this thread

				That documentary is off the line IMO. Ketamine is just....I dont know...a weird drug. No euphoria or any sense of well-being, just vertigo and confusion, difficulty speaking etc. It is something very unpleasant for me in higher doses and makes me really depressed for 2 days. MXE is a lot different though. Much more fun, ketamine is a serious drug. I dont get how is this a party drug for so many people. I&#039;d vomit my soul if I were to use it in a rave or so.

				yeah, it was boring for me, but i will say it warded any time of uneasiness and mild depression i had....and for a while too.<br /><br />but meh, i can see it as a drug i have a little stash of and rip a bump or two and chill solo. nothing really euphoric or enjoyable in my opinion.<br /><br />i got it from reich too, who has quality product and easily the best shipping technique, ever

				Ketamine&#039;s good for relaxing but I could imagine clubbing on it. You just kinda care less and feel more open. It&#039;s hard to describe to be honest. I&#039;ve never k-holed but I&#039;ve taken ~50mg for each experience.
