				The only type of hash which is renowned for containing opium are Nepalese Temple Balls, and even then sometimes without it. No idea how you&#039;d actually test it though. :-\

				Using a commercially available quicktest would be the easiest way to got about it indeed. These tests are bascially the same things customs and such use to detect opiates. The result is a simple color change if you add a sample containing heroin or cocaine. <br /><br />The concept of putting opiates or other very addictive substances into weed is not that new though. Drug dealers have been doing so for decades to get people to become addicted to their product specifically. In some asian countries (like laos|) heroin production sideproducts are actually a component in ready-made joints.

				Hmmm interesting. I hear that Laos (and Cambodia) is one of the worlds&#039; drug hotspots. Many Asian countries sign up to War on Drugs legislation, but continue to permit usage of drugs which are traditional to their country. What heroin side-products do they put in joints?

				That is a bit of a half truth really: In Laos drugs (including cannabis) are strictly forbidden. There is one place, Vang Vieng, where drug legislation is rarely enforced, and its quite a touristic hotspot. Drugs readily available include magic mushrooms, but also cannabis, and in some cases opium products. <br />&nbsp;<br />A downside of this place is that drugs are frequently mixed up. You can, for example, buy ready-made joints when bobbing down the river, but these do not always contain cannabis. Sometimes they contain low grade opium instead, or a mix of both. I&#039;ve been to vang vieng myself several years ago and ran into that problem: What i thought to be a cannabis joint actually contained some low grade opiate or possibly waste product. At first it was very nice although it did taste odd compared to cannabis. A few hours later i was feeling quite ill, which luckily passed after laying down for a few hours with no further ill effect.<br /><br />I am unsure what was in that premade joint precisely, but i&#039;m quite sure there was more than just cannabis in it. It certainly was not a hallucinogen like the mushrooms sold around vang vieng, and not a pure opiate like morphine or heroin either. It might have been some other opiate that is a waste product from morphine/heroin production, though i&#039;ll probably never know, nor wish to experiment with it any further.

				I was told about Laos by a Chinese friend who reckoned you could get any drug you wanted there. May be an exaggeration though.<br />I did read an article recently about Cambodia, saying that Cannabis is effectively legal, and can be bought in special &#039;pizza parlours&#039; or just by asking rickshaw drivers. Sounds a bit like a South-East Asian version of The Netherlands. Would love to go, even if Cambodia has a very grim modern history.

				Vang vieng really is a small holiday/party town, and joints and magic-mushroom containing pizza&#039;s are sold openly there, the latter advertised with signs and all. Most people that visit are foreign backpackers, i don&#039;t think its popular among the Lao people really.<br /><br />If you want to visit, you can take a flight to vientiane, and a 4 hours bus ride from there. Alternatively, you can enter laos from thailand and travel south like many backpackers do, stopping in vang vieng before leaving the country through vientiane (either by bus to thailand or airplane anywhere). Vang vieng itself has no operational airport, so you must travel in by bus from either direction. <br /><br />As for &#039;being able to get anything in Laos&#039;, i would say that the same goes for the netherlands. You will, however, not commonly be approached by drug dealers in vientiane. Whilst highly illegal, you can purchase most drugs if you ask around, but this is similar in every major european city. <br /><br />Cambodia also has a bit of a reputation for drugs, particularly opium, as it grows in both Laos and Cambodia and is sometimes sold to tourists. It may not be hard to find any if you ask around, but it is by no means legal. Sentences on possession can be very severe in these countries, including decades in prisons unfit to house cattle. It may be possible to bribe your way out of the problem, but that will not come cheap. Bribing a cop to let you go could be $10 to $500, but bribing yourself out of the justice system once properly arrested can cost you tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and will not be successful in all cases. Do no take this lightly, if you get busted for drug possession in these parts, you are royally fucked!

				One of my towns in South East Asia, Trishaw / rickshaw drivers sell the drugs, at an expensive price, shit weed too, to foreigners. And the beach boys (jet ski, water sports locals) sell expensive shit, Lucky I had my own connections there, not related to those wankers..<br /><br />And Ben, Thank a mill for the info, will take precautions if I ever intend on going there, getting caught in thailand with drugs as a foreigner can be just as bad... :\

				Yeah I was a bit baffled by the reference to rodents!&nbsp; :D<br />From what I read about Cambodia, it really isn&#039;t much of a risk to buy cannabis there, it&#039;s tolerated by the cops, again, like The Netherlands, as long as you don&#039;t flaunt it. The places selling it do it quite openly, with the full knowledge of LE. Read up on it yourself if you intend to indulge in drugs tourism. It&#039;s not like Thailand, where they really do crack down on drug users, including foreigners. They even had summary executions of alleged small-time drug dealers, without trial, a few years ago. Even Kratom is illegal there!

				It is fairly hard to explain the differences between the policies in Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. <br /><br />By the letter of the law, all these countries impose very severe sentences for narcotics trafficking, including life imprisonment and even death (in Thailand). The way the law is enforced varies very widely between the countries, and also between what part of any of these countries you are in. <br /><br />You must realize that corruption is the chief factor in all of these countries when it comes to enforcement however. Being formally convicted of drug trafficking means either death in prison or execution in all of them. The line between possession and trafficking is not clear either, but keep in mind that having more than one single person dose on you could be considered trafficking if the legal systems wants it to be. <br /><br />Lets consider you are not actually trafficking drugs at all, but just buy some for personal use: the best thing would be to get a dose you can immediately ingest/smoke/etc after buying it. Having the drug in your system may be an offense, but it is not regarded that severe a crime. <br /><br />In Laos and Cambodia possession of a small amount (a few doses for personal use) can be bribed around relatively easily in most cases, and in places like Vang Vieng it is tolerated by police, that probably get some hush money from the bars and magic pizza places as it is.<br /><br />Thailand is another story however: having any amount that could be considered as re-sellable is considered a very serious offense. The best way i&#039;ve heard it described is that drug trafficking is a more serious crime than murder, since it is a &#039;crime against society&#039; and not &#039;a crime against an individual&#039;. <br /><br />Especially for europeans this is something to seriously consider as we are not used to years or decades in prison for carrying a dozen or so dosages. I suppose in the US the war on drugs and the concept of going to jail for possession is more common. <br /><br />Thai prisons are not like those in the western world either - inmates are shacked, and kept in by a wall and armed guards, but nothing is provided for them. Some food is provided, but that is of dismal quality and probably will cause illness in people not used to thai germs. If you would get convicted to 10 years of jailtime in thailand, chances really are that you will not live those 10 years to tell the story.

				There was a vendor on here based in India, CharasBros, they sold opium mixed hash alongside their regular charas. I bought a few g&#039;s but didn&#039;t really notice much difference to normal charas.

				You may still find such things in thailand. Not in bangkok, not in any major city, and certainly not on the tourist islands. But if you were to travel a bit into the countryside, i&#039;m sure you can still find them and people that use them regularly. <br /><br />One thing about asian countries and some drugs used that is understanding how they work: Many of them have vast rural areas that are not really policed, and if they are, policemen often are from the people that live in these lands and grew up with the traditions, including those including drugs that are illegal to use by national law. <br /><br />So yes, you can find people smoking opium in rural laos, wild cannabis tainted with opium in thailand, chewing on betelnuts in rural malaysia or indonesia, and a very long list of other substances used throughout the continent. <br /><br />This does NOT mean, however, that you should be doing/buying drugs on the streets in Bangkok or Jakarta, as national law IS enforced there and you can get into very serious trouble for even smoking a joint.

				Yeah, although Thailand and Indonesia have significant drug cultures of their own, I wouldn&#039;t ever go to either of those countries for drug tourism. Their prison systems are packed with misguided Westerners, who&#039;ve fallen foul of ultra-tough drug laws. Cambodia and Laos seem a bit more relaxed about their drug cultures. I think that in South-East Asia, every country has a different approach to dealing with psychoactives, for religious or cultural reasons, as is the case pretty much worldwide. Uruguay could very easily become a magnet for drug tourists if it presses through the full legalization of cannabis, same with Washington and Colorado in the states.

				It&#039;s not like that they have prisons full of westerners arrested for drug related offenses. For example, in bangkok, the actual number for foreigners imprisoned for drug related crimes is a few dozen. The downside is that the sentences down there are usually life in prison, or decades long sentences that would equate to death in prison long before the end of them. Foreigners are rarely executed, but some have died in the prisons from the bad circumstances there. <br /><br />As far as legal cannabis and tourism is concerned: we have had this situation in the netherlands for ages - not that cannabis is fully legal, but posession under 5 grams or use is not prosecuted). This does bring some people to amsterdam (especially on cheap flights from the UK and such), but most tourists come here to look at paintings, windmills and such. I&#039;m not really sure what Uruguay has to offer for tourists, but it might be a very relaxed country as is :)

				I suppose they are - light up and watch a football match?<br /><br />If they actually push through on legalization it may become a bit of a backpackers hangout. Such low-end tourism can actually be very good for the people in a country though, as they often prefer to say in locally ran hostels instead of international chain hotels, contributing some cashflow to the population.&nbsp;

				It will be an interesting and crucial development in the failed experiment with prohibition if Uruguay actually passes a legalization law. All credit to their politicians for adopting an open-minded stance on drugs (marijuana in particular). I&#039;ll be first on the plane to Montevideo!! ;)

				I have no idea what montevideo is like as a city really. It would become an &#039;amsterdam of the americas&#039; of sorts if they legalize cannabis in uruguay. As life there is much cheaper compared to the netherlands i suppose it could actually make an attractive destination of drug tourists, given its closer proximity to the southern us states. <br /><br />If they were to legalize both production, sale and use for anyone that would be a world first though, and perhaps set an example for the rest of the world after it proves to cause few or no problems. <br /><br />

				Somehow the sale of cannabis from pharmacies or similar outlets has always seemed a bit odd to me. Its a bit like having to go to a pharmacy to buy a beer.<br /><br />I like the way it is sold here in holland: from coffeeshops that specifically sell cannabis, and usually present a place to consume it as well, though the latter has gotten somewhat problematic due to the smoking ban for restaurants, bars etc. <br /><br />One interesting aspect about the coffeeshops is that they are not allowed to sell alcohol - so there is no single place where you can legally buy both alcohol and cannabis at the same time. Some bars do allow consumption of cannabis your brought in yourself though, which is a bit of a legal gray area. <br />

				Hmm interesting. The pharmacy thing does sound slightly odd, but we&#039;ll have to see how things pan out.<br />BTW, what&#039;s the situation in The Netherlands ATM, regarding the new laws requiring people to have a Dutch passport to be able to enter coffeeshops? Are foreigners being turned away? I heard that the mayor of Amsterdam made a statement saying these regulations will not be adhered to in Amsterdam itself. What&#039;s the situation on the ground?&nbsp; ???

				The situation at the moment is that some cities nearing the borders with belgium have introduced such a system, as to avoid people driving in from the south to purchase cannabis. This caused a situation where cannabis was sold on the streets by clandestine dealers that sold pretty aggressively to anyone with a belgian or french number plate on their car. Some cities have abolished the restriction&nbsp; since, and leave the job to the belgian police where it probably belongs in the first place.<br /><br />As for amsterdam, at the moment there is no restriction on selling cannabis to foreigners. You can still fly over, go to a coffeeshop and have the pot you desire without any paperwork. <br /><br />The main issue with selling cannabis to foreigners has been with land traffficking, particularly to the south. Obviously there is also a stream of cannabis heading eastward into germany, but that poses less of a problem since quite a number of german provinces (bundeslander) also have a polity not to pursue possession of amounts for personal use.
