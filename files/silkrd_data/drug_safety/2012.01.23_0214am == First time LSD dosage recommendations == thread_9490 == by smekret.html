				Hi there<br /><br />I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction regarding how much LSD I should acquire/take for the first time.<br />I&#039;ve never tripped on anything before, and have only been stoned a few times - so I&#039;d have no clue what to expect...<br /><br />Could anyone make some suggestions?<br /><br />thanks ;)

				smekret... it depends on how many mics on each tab... and on your set and setting. Have a sitter there with you in a safe comfortable place... phones unplugged, etc... and with some awesome music to be listened to.<br /><br />No more than 2 to begin with. LSD is sacred medicine. <br /><br />Pleasant journeys to you. Sending you lots of peace and love on your trip.

				...seriously, just one....as i have found taking half may not produce enough of the desired effect and taking the other half (say) hours later may not be as strong as if you&#039;d take it whole.<br /><br />

				Take 1 at 100-150ug, then IF you think you need it after a couple hours take a bit more. Give it time to work though, you don&#039;t want to think its not doing much, drop another 100ug, then 5 minutes later realise the first lot is starting to hit hard. :P<br /><br />Also... Do some research. Get on errowid, search google, search here. Make sure you know what to expect, how to set your surroundings up, how to react IF things go bad, be as well informed as you can.

				Def. 2! If you just take 1, and most hits here have &lt;100ug, you&#039;ll tip your feet in the water but you wont swim. With 2 hits you&#039;ll have a nice swim with Lucy and that&#039;s what it&#039;s about.

				I just want to weigh in a little here.&nbsp; I have had alot of experience in this, and I want to remind you you will only have 1 first trip.&nbsp; Not that its a huge thing, but it kinda is.&nbsp; IT&#039;s wierd, its more than anyone could ever explain, but at the same time it&#039;s almost not as big of a deal as you are led to believe.&nbsp; I would not take any less than 2, you can&#039;t go wrong.&nbsp; And if you are worried about some &quot;crises&quot; just have about 4mg of xanax of something similiar on hand and you can just pop that and loosen up.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t this huge freak out risk that everybody seems to try to act like.&nbsp; I have been to countless festivals and raves with up to 25,000 people and very few people are in the safe tripper tent losing it and when they are its generally from polydrug use, consuming an unknown bs pill(like pcp/ephedra being pushed as rolls), and of course the few with underlying disorders that the tripping brings to the surface(which is actually a good thing because you can identify it and deal with it).&nbsp; Even if you have a largely negative trip(I highly doubt it) you will more than likely be a better person afterwards, espcially if you use it correctly.<br />On that note LSD is not a cure all fix all style mind drug that people act like it is.&nbsp; It very well can be, but with the effort you make when you are sober with the information from yourself from the trip.&nbsp; I equate it like a microscope.&nbsp; Scientists don&#039;t just look through a microscope day in and day out, they look, gather info then assess it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now mushrooms... thats a different story altogether.&nbsp; Seriously though, do yourself a favor and go for the 2, you will be happy you did later.<br /><br />edit:&nbsp; I also believe that the more you take the less likely you are to freak out.&nbsp; If you dose 10 hits you won&#039;t know what an experience is enough to have a bad one.&nbsp; Now this might not be always the rule, but I have found it to be true.&nbsp; Terrence McKenna also shared this belief.&nbsp; Here is a relevant quote by him, if you are not familiar I would listen to some of his lectures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;psychedelic drugs can often bring about psychosis in people who have not taken them&quot;<br />Terence Mckenna

				You also know yourself best, and know what kind of person you are vis-a-vis general mindset, etc.&nbsp; I was nervous to take LSD because I am a moody bastard, and of course that nervousness is also not a great mindset to have.&nbsp; I only took one hit (windowpane) and absolutely loved it.&nbsp; But I was with my girlfriend at the time, etc. <br /><br />If you have a propensity for depression or are genuinely nervous about it, I would say definitely don&#039;t take more than one hit.&nbsp; Personally, I don&#039;t remember the first time I tripped; I remember the best times I tripped.<br /><br />Side note: I could never smoke weed without having some huge internal emotional turmoil bullshit, but this was not at all true with LCD.&nbsp; Just tons of fun, lots of energy, and genuine excitement to exist in the moment.&nbsp; The greatest drug IMO, bar none.
