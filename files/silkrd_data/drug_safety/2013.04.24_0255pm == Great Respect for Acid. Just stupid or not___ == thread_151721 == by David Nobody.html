				No, not a high possibility, and you have some influence over this. Lots of people have offered suggestions in these forums and elsewhere, but to repeat some basics: ensure a safe, predictable environment. Have a sober sitter if it comforts you (someone you know and trust). Go easy on the dose your first time. Be feeling positive - a bit of apprehension is normal but if you&#039;ve just had an awful day don&#039;t cap it off with your first trip - save it for another time. Also, know that a bad trip is just a bad trip. If it happened and it probably won&#039;t, it will not break you. Write yourself post-it notes and stick them up in your environment. &quot;Relax. This is temporary. You are ok.&quot; etc. Have some good music handy. Enjoy.<br /><br />I have had negative trips but I&#039;ve never had a &quot;bad&quot; trip on LSD (what you would call a horror trip). I have had them on shrooms, a few times, and yeah, they can be bad. Existential horror is a lot worse than nightmare imagery, which really only scratches the surface. But again, control your dose, choose your environment, self-assess, and remember that you&#039;ll come out the other side just fine.

				Set and setting, my friend.&nbsp; I used to think LSD was something mystical back in the days when I first started consuming it, but now I think I&#039;m slowly coming to the realization that it&#039;s simply a chemical working on your brain, which in turn shakes up your mind/psyche.&nbsp; That&#039;s not to say that I don&#039;t have the utmost respect for this substance, I really do.&nbsp; Heck, I&#039;ve learned more about myself through its trips than in most of my life experiences.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really know what you mean by horror trip, though.&nbsp; Are you talking about bad trips that turn into real life train wrecks?&nbsp; Bad trips are very possible, just as good trips are.&nbsp; This is all dependent on the environment you find yourself in while tripping, and the mindset and intention you possess prior to tripping.&nbsp; Even having the right set and setting won&#039;t ensure you have a good trip, but it&#039;ll increase the chance of it being one.&nbsp; If you have any type of psychological baggage, expect it to rise to the surface.&nbsp; Everything will rise to the surface on this -- you&#039;ll truly be exploring your psyche.&nbsp; If you have some things unresolved in your mind, expect that to come up.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be scared, though, these issues have the potential of being resolved on this.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t a recreational drug, although experienced users may treat it as such.&nbsp; As for bad trips that turn into train wrecks, those are possible, but again, it depends on external and internal factors.&nbsp; Trip in a setting you deem comfortable, and run everything through with a sitter prior to the trip.&nbsp; If at some point you feel like being alone during the trip, have a designated spot where you can go in privacy.&nbsp; It should be noted that one&#039;s cumulative psyche has a role in the formation of a trip.&nbsp; For example, I&#039;ve had issues with depression and some suicidal thinking in the past prior to tripping, and in some of my trips those negative thoughts resurfaced.&nbsp; I never did anything rash (cried a lot, though), but that&#039;s me.&nbsp; People have different personalities and psyches and react differently.&nbsp; All in all, be careful, plan things out, and try not to think too much beforehand, even though all of the information that&#039;s been handed to you will probably give you a lot to think about.

				Thanks for the replies... it helped a lot<br /><br />What place would you guys prefer to stay while tripping. Of course a place you&#039;re comfortable with I guess. But should it be a quiet place (eg. at home) or maybe a bar or club you really like and you&#039;ve been a lot to???

				I had a horror trip with LSD. It can&#039;t really be described. It&#039;s a sense of total self-annihilation. You are entrapped within an awareness that is infinitely greater than yourself. You cease to exist as an individual There&#039;s only Big Mind.&nbsp; Anyone who tells you that LSD isn&#039;t &quot;mystical&quot; has not experienced Big Mind. Acquaintance with Big Mind can be Heaven or Hell, depending on your reaction to it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Deception is also at work here. Some people who have glimpsed Big Mind don&#039;t want other people to know about it. They think it&#039;s for your own good. They think it might damage you psychologically. And they may be right.&nbsp; They&#039;ll tell you &quot;LSD is just a chemical&quot;, &quot;LSD isn&#039;t spiritual&quot;, etc. The truth is we are nothing but an image inside of the Mind of something infinitely greater than us.&nbsp; &nbsp;We don&#039;t exist. We are held captive inside of a larger mind who exerts total control over us.... We have about as much reality as the characters inside of a novel or computer game. LSD can show you this. That&#039;s why it was put on this earth. That&#039;s why it&#039;s a synthetic chemical, too. Except for a few saints and sages, the mass of humanity wasn&#039;t meant to know it at an earlier stage in the history of our civilisation.<br /><br />The risk of LSD is existential and spiritual, not psychological or physical. That&#039;s why people are so afraid of it, and will try to discourage you from experimenting with it. Even other psychedelic users will try to discourage you, because they know what LSD can do, all other psychedelics only touch the surface of Big Mind, or lead you astray down the false path of hallucination and feeling-based spirituality.

				Since you are anxious about it, I recommend that you start on a low dose, 100ug and work your way up by 50-100ug (depending on how comfortable you feel after). Create a calm atmosphere with a few soundtracks (compile all your feel-good songs), activities, eye candy, etc. Prepare food and drink beforehand and have them readily available. Also try to have someone with you who has done acid before --not entirely necessary at 100ug but couldn&#039;t hurt to have company on the off chance you need something explained. <br /><br />I think being outdoors is ideal but not always practical. Try to spend some of it outdoors if only for some fresh air and a quick walk. And definitely step outside if you start to feel anxious.

No greasy pizza or a bucket of fries, unless you want to feel bloated and nauseous the whole trip. I prefer to take Lucy on an empty stomach, but I do find that having small snacks around (unsalted peanuts, cranberries, bread and whatnot) is a good idea. Oranges/clementines/tangerines and what-have-you are especially fun to peel and eat on LSD.

				Acidhead, please stop imposing your subjectivity on others as the one and only truth.&nbsp; Just because you&#039;ve experienced a mystical experience on LSD does not mean the substance itself is mystical.&nbsp; What you are attributing to this substance should rather be attributed to yourself.&nbsp; What you are talking about is not original or secretive, and sounds awfully similar to the relationship between Atman and Brahman in Hinduism (Atman is a drop of water, and Brahman is the infinite ocean, as an analogy), amongst other ideas in Hindu philosophy.&nbsp; LSD is nothing but a catalyst, and it&#039;s semi-synthetic, not completely synthetic as you&#039;ve stated.&nbsp; There has been speculation that ergoline alkaloids have been used in antiquity during religious ceremonies, e.g., the Eleusinian Mysteries, so I don&#039;t understand your claim that we weren&#039;t meant to discover &quot;mystical substances&quot; such as LSD.&nbsp; Also, the Natives of North America have had mystical experiences on peyote for centuries, so how is your reasoning applied in that case?&nbsp; They were meant to have mystical experiences, but Europeans weren&#039;t?

And I don&#039;t think there is anything subjective about the experience itself, as it transcends the subject-object dichotomy; there is no experiencing &#039;subject&#039;, and thus it cannot be called a subjective experience. But there&#039;s also no &#039;object&#039; of consciousness, so it can&#039;t be called objective either. It is simply beyond human understanding.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151721.msg1055422#msg1055422">Quote from: seuss on April 26, 2013, 06:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What you are talking about is not original or secretive, ...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> I did not give the impression that it is an original idea. On the contrary, the LSD experience of transcendent unity with Big Mind is the archetypal spiritual experience. It is the essential nuclear characteristic of all mysticism, in all religions and all cultures. All other spiritual experiences are lesser than this, or derivative from it. It is the original source of all doctrines concerning the existence of &#039;God&#039;. It is the Brahman in Hinduism, the One of Neoplatonic philosophy, the Christ-consciousness that Jesus experienced (the &#039;second coming&#039; is the awakening of Christ in one&#039;s own Self), the &#039;inner light&#039; of Quakerism, &#039;Satori&#039; in Zen Buddhism,&nbsp; etc. The&nbsp; difference with LSD is that it is not the result of religious practice and discipline. It happens suddenly. Hence, one may not be prepared to for it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and it&#039;s semi-synthetic, not completely synthetic as you&#039;ve stated.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My point is that that the &#039;unity&#039; cannot have been known to the masses until the advent of LSD, which can only be produced on a mass scale at a relatively advanced stage of human civilisation.&nbsp; Except for a few saints and sages, the mass of humanity could not have had such an experience at any earlier stage in the history of Western civilisation.&nbsp; I take it as axiomatic that all things are controlled and directed by Big Mind for a specific purpose. From this I infer that LSD was introduced into history during the 20th century for a reason (Big Mind controls Albert Hoffman, as it does all things). My guess is that it was intended for the transition of Western civilisation consciousness into a higher plane of awareness.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There has been speculation that ergoline alkaloids have been used in antiquity during religious ceremonies, e.g., the Eleusinian Mysteries,</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>And this was a very secretive and initiatory sect.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Also, the Natives of North America have had mystical experiences on peyote for centuries, so how is your reasoning applied in that case?&nbsp; They were meant to have mystical experiences, but Europeans weren&#039;t?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I was talking specifically about our civilisation.&nbsp; OUR civilisation (as a whole) wasn&#039;t meant to know these things until the 20th century, which explains the relative paucity of psilocybin mushrooms in Europe, the mysticism suppression of mystical sects within Christianity, etc. It&#039;s only with the advent of acid&nbsp; that mystical satori type experiences can be as it were given to the masses. This is not without meaning or significance.

Go for a walk, kiss someone, change your music..<br /><br />If its your first time, while its never been my thing, get a trip sitter who has done it before and can help guide or talk you out of a dark place if you wander there (mentally speaking) <br /><br />Try LSD on it own, feel it out once you know it.. Try it with some MDMA.. Take the LSD first and after a few hours take the MDMA Wonderful mix!

				I think there is some really good advice here. Especially the relax comment.<br /><br />It&#039;s an amazing substance and you are approaching the idea correctly. It&#039;s good to be cautious. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think that it goes well with big parties and too much commotion like raves for your first time because all of your senses are amplified and you want to avoid being anxious and overpowered by too much. I mean...a blade of grass can become the most interesting thing in the whole world but a lot of people you don&#039;t know can make you uncomfortable. As many have said, set and setting are important but a lot of people don&#039;t grasp what it means. One response was RELAX and that&#039;s the best thing you can do IMO.<br /><br />Try to have at least one friend with you that you trust unconditionally who will be tripping too and if you guys are in a safe place you&#039;ll be fine. This may sound too cautious but it might be a good idea to have someone there with you who knows what it&#039;s like and can be like your guide. They should be the type of person you feel at ease around in every situation. Someone who is experienced and kind. You need a person that is experienced AND sober though. Have fun. Oh. And just a warning: If you enjoy your time and continue to do it here and there make sure that you stay physically and mentally healthy and take long breaks between the times you trip. If you don&#039;t you could very possibly turn into a huge toad. j/k Have fun. Be safe. Don&#039;t mix it with anything other than marijuana the first time and always avoid mixing it with speed.<br /><br /><br />One last thing. <br /><br />SCIENCE. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let anyone ruin your &quot;personal&quot; experience with their deluded thoughts of reality *cough* *cough*

They need to know all the risks involved. And the greatest danger of LSD is that you might wake up from this dream and discover that you&#039;re God. Even if it&#039;s delusion -- which I don&#039;t believe for a moment -- that is the great danger of taking LSD, at least in higher dosages. I used to be an atheist, so I know how absurd this sounds to people who have never experienced what I am talking about. It all sounds ridiculous until you have experienced Big Mind. Then everything becomes clear. And the reason it sounds absurd is because it can&#039;t be described in language. When you try to say what it is, you end up saying something else. Like when I say &#039;big mind&#039;, etc., -- that&#039;s just a metaphor that doesn&#039;t capture a single aspect of what I am trying to say. :( :( :(<br /><br />As regards the supposed disagreements concerning the content of the LSD experience: As other people have pointed out, the common dosage of LSD since its prohibition (1968) has been roughly 30-50ug. Most people who have any opinion on LSD base their opinion on their experience with these lower dosages which are only sufficient to evoke some of the aesthetic pleasures of LSD - not enough to transcend the ego and dissolve into Big Mind. According to Grof and Timothy Leary, this &#039;unity&#039; type mystical experience is reported by 80-90 percent of patients in LSD psychotherapy sessions with dosages ranging from 200ug to 600ug. So it&#039;s a pretty common experience among whose who have taken enough acid. There is also widespread agreement concerning the nature of mystical experience in general (see Stace&#039;s &quot;Mysticism and Philosophy&quot; and Frithjof&nbsp; Schuon&#039;s &quot;The Transcendental Unity of Religions&quot;). Because mystical experience is universal across cultures, verifiable to anyone willing to take the necessary steps to become a witness to it, as well as orderly and lawful,&nbsp; it is very likely to be true. At least, these are the criteria by which we judge the phenomena of our senses to be real (orderliness and verifiability) -- if you want to verify that Jupiter has a moon, you become a witness to it by looking through the telescope. If it&#039;s orderly and lawful, it isn&#039;t an illusion. Of course, some people would rather not look through the telescope.<br /><br />I consider free will to be a question of identity. If you identify yourself with the Absolute Intelligence, then you are free, because it alone is in control. If you identify only with your finite ego, you only have the illusion of freedom.

				Acidhead, those patients may have had unity type mystical experiences, but we do not know the exact content of those experiences; they&#039;re simply lumped into one category, and those results are from a particular group of people with psychological issues.&nbsp; We can have a poll right now in order to see how many people have actually experienced what you&#039;re talking about on dosages ranging from 200-600 ug, and that would draw from a wide variety of people.

Personally i think acidhead is taking a powerful psychedelic experience and trying to explain the unexplainable through a new found belief in a higher power, something i have been hoping will die off as humans evolve but people want explanations of why the sun comes up and why they can visit a plane of reality they cant normally interact with. Who knows she could be right but the majority of people who experience ego death do not take away a new found belief in god from it, i think its her coping mechanism.

				You people don&#039;t even realize it, but the fact that your thoughts feel strange to you - like something or someone is controlling you - is likely a full-blown psychosis!<br /><br />I&#039;ve had the same experience on &#039;Shrooms (Norwegian Psilocybe Semilanceata) and LSD, though mostly when mixed with Cannabis or Hashish.

				*sighs*<br /><br />All this spiritual bullshit delegitimizes the value of taking LSD. It&#039;s usefulness is found in it being a great creative tool; it is helpful for thinking of new ideas. This creativity can be used to find insight into your life (by looking at yourself from a different perspective), or perhaps inspire you in an art field.<br /><br />In terms of long lasting changes of perception while not on the drug- all I&#039;ve found is that I pay more attention to detail; perhaps I&#039;ll notice something in a photo I hadn&#039;t previously, or become more acutely aware of my senses.<br /><br />The only other benefit past these is that with the proper set and setting it&#039;s simply fun. People need to enjoy life more.<br /><br />It is not spiritual. Spirits do not exist.<br />It does not allow you to transcend this world. This is a physical impossibility.<br /><br />A common misconception about LSD is that it induces delirium (e.g; seeing things that aren&#039;t there) whereas it simply warps the environment you&#039;re currently in. It does seem to have one delirious effect, however– it convinces dumbasses that there are spirits/gods/deities and other fictitious bullshit.

				Why do people feel the need to come and hate on people for having positive experiences they dont agree with? It makes me wonder if these people have ever taken a psychedelics or even read anything about them that wasn&#039;t propaganda. <br /><br />Can powerful psychedelics change your perspective and therefore reality yes absolutely. Can they connect you with a higher power, who knows. <br /><br />Reality is a hallucination, entirely based on the observers prospective. When that perspective gets shifted reality changes at a fundamental level. It has been proven that observation can change natural phenomena, conscious observation is capable of many amazing things.<br /><br />There is more to this world than we know, dont discount others experiences just because they dont line up with your own. KEEP AND OPEN MIND.

Hallucination just means that your perceiving something that isnt whats really there. Think about how everyone sees the world differently from everyone else, their own perception is changing what they perceive as reality. The core of the point im making is no one can see whats &quot;real&quot; unbiasedly, no one person knows what real is. We just need to keep our minds open and not write people off because they dont view the world in a similar manner.&nbsp;

				Dude you are eventually gonna try it. Just make sure you are in an excellent mood for it. You have to be in the mood for LSD. I would advise strongly against dropping it in a place where there is a lot of people you don&#039;t know.

				Your questions are the same I had. <br /><br />A very good book for you to read now, before going on with your doubts and questions, would be: &quot;the psychedelic explorer guide&quot; from James Fadiman!<br />Read that book, take your time to assimilate the knowledge that&#039;s in it and then have your first experience without any doubt or fear. <br /><br />LSD is the most beautifull that ever happened to me, <br />but the intensity can be much to handle at some times if you&#039;re not expecting it. <br />This book will tell you how to use it, in what context and it will also explain you what can go wrong, how to avoid it and what impact it can have on your further life.<br /><br />You&#039;ll love it. <br />If you respect it, it&#039;ll respect you.

It&#039;s usefulness is found in it being a great creative tool; it is helpful for thinking of new ideas. This creativity can be used to find insight into your life (by looking at yourself from a different perspective), or perhaps inspire you in an art field.<br /><br />In terms of long lasting changes of perception while not on the drug- all I&#039;ve found is that I pay more attention to detail; perhaps I&#039;ll notice something in a photo I hadn&#039;t previously, or become more acutely aware of my senses.<br /><br />The only other benefit past these is that with the proper set and setting it&#039;s simply fun. People need to enjoy life more.<br /><br />It is not spiritual. Spirits do not exist.<br />It does not allow you to transcend this world. This is a physical impossibility.<br /><br />A common misconception about LSD is that it induces delirium (e.g; seeing things that aren&#039;t there) whereas it simply warps the environment you&#039;re currently in. It does seem to have one delirious effect, however– it convinces dumbasses that there are spirits/gods/deities and other fictitious bullshit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I can certainly relate to and understand what you are saying.<br /><br />I would, however, challenge you to smoke a breakthrough dose of DMT. You may not feel the same about spirits/spirituality afterwards.<br /><br />EDIT: just saw your post about DMT; I hope you continue with it and have a fantastic journey. A breakthrough will, at the least, STRONGLY challenge any preconceived or even well thought out notions you have about reality.
