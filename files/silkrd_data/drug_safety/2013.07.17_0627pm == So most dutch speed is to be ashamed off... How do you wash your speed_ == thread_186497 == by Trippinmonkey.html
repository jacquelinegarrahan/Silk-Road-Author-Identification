				60-70% pure amphetamines???<br />After drying have lost 40%???<br /><br />Yeah we could add caffeine, taurine, lactose and whatever. But I do not want to do that.<br /><br />Since too many people in NL bought aceton and mag sulf to clean speed and you cant buy it anymore, how do you clean your speed?<br /><br />One site sais ampf is really solulable in water, others dont.<br />We once put 33dexies in a coffee filter and added hot water.. the binders were in the filter, the water was clear and did not evaoporate :(<br /><br />

				Interesting question...<br /><br />If you gained experience in the dutch vendors then you will see that naming it HQ and cutting it with crap is wanted a lot.<br /><br />It does not even matter if it smells like a bitch and is cut with caffeine/lactose/taurine/ perhaps even rat poison...<br /><br />Probably the dutchies cant handle real speed. Which might be why we will use capsules with a restricted amount of mg&#039;s. Just for their safety...<br /><br />Did you ever notice that dutch people buy pink basecoke while in fact it&#039;s everything else besides basecoke?<br /><br />Strange dutchies.. They have all the drugs for cheap and do n9t even know what real drugs are...

				Speed paste = moisture<br /><br />Drying = losing water weight<br /><br />Nothing to do with quality, simple thinking my friend. ;)

				Yeah duh..<br />If I would sell weed and make it very wet then it&#039;d weight a lot more as well...<br /><br />In my opinion vendors should very clearly state the CORRECT amounts of how much product they will have left after drying. Some say 60-70% and then people in the feedback say that they lost a lot after drying...<br /><br /><br />But that is not the point.<br />I want to know where to get stuff in the NL to wash amphetamines. If I want caffeine I&#039;ll drink coffee, if I want taurine I&#039;ll drink an energy drink, etc. etc. And if I want pure amphetamines I want pure amphetamines.<br />Oh and I definitely do not want rat poison because it makes the speed smell like shit so people actually think it&#039;s good speed :S

				Rat poison is bullshit, those are fairytales.<br /><br />Just use acetone to wash, it&#039;s available in every country.<br /><br />Regards, O.S.

				Take a glass and add the speed, if it&#039;s dry, crush it to powder.<br /><br />After it has been crushed add enough acetone.<br /><br />Stir the solution for a few minutes.<br /><br />Take another glass (glass 2) and put a filter in it (coffee filter, thick napkin, thin towel) pour glass one and it&#039;s contents in glass 2<br /><br />The clean amphetamine remains in the filter, let it dry and enjoy!<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; 8)
