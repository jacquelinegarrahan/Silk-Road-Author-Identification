				so. yeah, I&#039;m in the smack dab middle of the path of this shitstorm. I&#039;m waiting for the power to go out. I&#039;m tempted to take substances such as shrooms or cid for having fun while waiting the storm out. I&#039;m more feeling like shrooms at the moment, however I don&#039;t want to trip my balls out. How low can I go with dose to have fun but without tripping too hard? <br /><br />I have the chocolate bars (I forget the vendor&#039;s name...), maybe a square (one block made up of 4 squares)?

				You should design a new drug which perfectly fits for a cases like that. And name it after the hurricane.

				yep exactly. I want something that makes me giggle and/or have a shit eating grin on my face. and see fractals a bit but yet so relaxing to the point where I&#039;m not bugging out to move around a lot. <br /><br />too bad I haven&#039;t tried MDMA so I don&#039;t know if that would apply to this situation. one square of shrooms it is. to see how it feels.

				Sounds like you want to candyflip (LSD + MDMA).<br />MDA might also fit the bill, but it&#039;s still not quite psychedelic enough to see fractals I don&#039;t think.

				might be too late now, but to me it just seems like a potentially bad idea to use a psychedelic when you could be in a harmful situation<br /><br />setting is extremely important for psychedelics, now i dont know how much you took and how hard you will be tripping but i hope its not too much. in the case of a hurricane where you could be in danger from things like flooding, trees falling, power lines etc - it is generally necessary to have your cognitive faculties intact, not the best time to be tripping really. imo this is how people have bad trips or get in situations they risk endangering themselves <br /><br />this is drug safety and i am a better safe than sorry kinda person <br /><br />i hope you have a good time, just please be safe and dont try to go outside or something

				sorry, I know that this is over a week late but better late than never. <br /><br />Took one square and wasn&#039;t sorry for it. It completely put me in perspective, I&#039;m in MD, not in NJ or NY states so it didn&#039;t hit us as hard as it could have. We had power the whole time which was surprising because we were used to power outages for random reasons. the shroom trip itself lasted only a couple of hours so it was easy to handle and be okay/sober-like around my family members. <br /><br />I never went outside, stayed inside the whole time, attempted to play xbox games (Batman) the first one. <br /><br />I DO want to candy-flip someday (LSD-MDMA) but the timing is never right so I wait. <br /><br />I don&#039;t regret doing the shrooms because it kept me in perspective and calm (like, what&#039;s the worst could happen? I&#039;m okay/alive)
