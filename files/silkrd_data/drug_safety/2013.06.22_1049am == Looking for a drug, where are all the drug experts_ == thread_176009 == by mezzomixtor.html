				Hey<br /><br />Some time ago i saw a documentation about drugs, and there was this new drug, i think its called D.E.D or something like that, it was definitely something with the letter &quot;D&quot; inside, and i think it was spelled like just 3 letters. <br /><br />You have to smoke the drug, and then you will be high around 15 minutes, with mostly visuals (similar to LSD i guess). <br /><br />Unfortunately, thats all i can remember. Anyone an idea which drug i could mean? and if yes, could you maybe inform me about risks/is it worth taking/ availability on the road/etc..?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				Yeah DMT was what you where looking for and that documentary is the spirit molecule. Is it worth taking, well that depends on if you like psychedelics. Its incredibly short acting 10-25 minutes if smoked, although it can be combined with an MAOI and taken orally increasing its duration to 4-6 or so hours.<br /><br />Its incredibly intense, perhaps the most intense psychedelic out there, and its effects are very spiritual in nature. Its much more intense than LSD and requires quite a bit of mental resolve. It can totally change the way you view life and the very constructs of reality.<br /><br />

Another way to do the same (even better, but IMO it&#039;s for more experienced people) is mixing MXE with smoked DMT.

				Ah lol. Yeah that makes a lot more sense.<br /><br />I had some experiences with ketamine and DMT. I try not to combine RCs with other substances besides cannabis.

				Never tripped on DMT, but the experience reports are the most entertaining I&#039;ve ever read. They make absolutely no sense to me. They seem like they were written by aliens.

				That&#039;s because It is absolutely impossible to put a DMT experience into words and come across as anything less than insane to someone who has no experience with psychedelics

				I wasn&#039;t trying to be condescending lol. I didnt say you had no experience with psychedelics either. I was just making a general statement regarding how difficult it is to put psychedelic experiences into words, seeing as by its very nature transcends the limitations of human language.

				fair enough. I was emphasizing the fact that DMT reports are very distinctive, and quite different from experience reports of other psychedelics. <br /><br />When I&#039;m not doing drugs, I spend a lot of time on erowid.<br /><br />Sorry I called you a shameless drug snob. It was said with love.
