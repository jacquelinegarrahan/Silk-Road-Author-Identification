				It depends on what your daily maintenance dose is.&nbsp; Mine is down to the 30-40mg range.<br /><br />I can get a nice buzz going from the following (usually taken before I actually take my daily dose, or 6-12 hours after):<br /><br />6-8 Percs or 30-40mg of any Oxycodone pill that isn&#039;t time released.<br />50-250mg of Heroin (I usually start with 50 then do another 100-200 once I am sure of the strength of the H)<br /><br />My current H buys have been from OPI, Genrx, W007 and Fanny Hill.&nbsp; Opi&#039;s was the best, followed by Genrx and w007 then Fanny Hill.<br /><br />After 20 years I would think your daily dose would be in the 5-10mg range but if its higher, say in the 100mg range, you are going to need a much higher amount of H than what I would need.&nbsp; But follow the same pattern.&nbsp; Do a small hit, say 50-75mg of H, wait at least 60 minutes the first time, then try a larger dose if you didn&#039;t get anything from the first one.&nbsp; But you need to be careful you don&#039;t take so much that you stop breathing, because the Meth is going to be counter acting the H, so take is slow the first time you get back into it.<br /><br />

				Iv&#039;e been on the program almost 20 years and stuck at 90mg per day.. Now if I can just find something real with strength perhaps it will happen... I would love Fentanyl but finding the real deal &amp; not some rip off may be hard, It even gets worse, I may have to snort since I have no veins available anymore. The methadone helped me gain weight. So if anyone has any real ideas please respond. I tried chasing the dragon &amp; just stunk up my place really bad for 2 days.. Not even a buzz with that one...<br />
