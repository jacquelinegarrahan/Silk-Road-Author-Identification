				With all the reports of coke being cut with Levamisole I realize it is smart to pickup some the Levamisole test kits that are available now, but I&#039;m curious what you do if you find out your gear is cut with this stuff. Do you say &quot;fuck it&quot; and lay some lines out anyway, is it instantly down the toilet, or do you take measures to clean the coke up yourself? Im writing this because I am curious of those take to their own tactics and &quot;clean the coke.&quot; I have very limited experience with cocaine, but if you do would you mind taking some time and writing up a quick guide to clean coke of Levamisole?&nbsp; ;D

				I honestly think that reputable sellers should be buying these kits as well and showing the results, sure this may not be beneficial to some sellers but that&#039;s what were aiming for here aren&#039;t we, some sort of honesty within the community? I&#039;m sure 90% wouldn&#039;t do it but in those cases just buy a sample and test it, post the results on the forums. I think a thread like this should be stickied with all the different test results, would put a LOT of people at easy (me)

				yeah same here. I actually gotten some coke from a vendor that was cut with that Levamisole bullshit. I just gave it a nice acetone wash and It was good to go.

				I don&#039;t think levamisole reacts like most other amphetmines i.e it doesn&#039;t react to a bleach test and I&#039;m not sure if it is soluble in acetone. I think that&#039;s why most farms use it, because it mimics cocaine in such a way that it&#039;s very difficult to tell if it&#039;s pure unless you use a test specific to levamisole

				It has been a while since I looked into the details, but I believe acetone does not remove levamisole, you have to use chloroform.<br /><br />If I remember correctly cocaine is not soluble in acetone and neither is levamisole. There are other common cuts and fillers that are soluble in acetone though, so you can wash your coke with acetone and then let the coke dry.<br /><br />To get rid of levamisole you&#039;ll need to use chloroform. Dissolve the coke in the chloroform, levamisole is not soluble in chloroform and will not dissolve. Then you filter out the things that haven&#039;t dissolved and then evaporate off the chloroform and then you&#039;ve got clean coke.<br /><br />For the price of coke it had damn well better not have any nasty shit in it to start with. To pay today&#039;s prices and then have to spend hours doing home chemistry is ridiculous. Just use a contaminant detection test and if the coke is bad never buy from that scumbag again.

				According to the DEA 90% of the US cocaine supply is cut with levamisole. It&#039;s shiny, doesn&#039;t dissolve in bleach, and has stimulant effects.
