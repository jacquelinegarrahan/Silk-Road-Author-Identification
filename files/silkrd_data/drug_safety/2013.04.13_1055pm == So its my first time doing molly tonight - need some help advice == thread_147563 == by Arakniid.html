				I have 2 100 mg pills that Im using and I was gonna snort the first one just to get the feel of it and see what Molly is like, Its my first time doing a drug like this Ive done shrooms and LSD numerous times but not molly. SO after the first pill Im probs gonna be going to my friends house where hes having a rager tonight and Im thinking probs an hour after I use the first pill Ill just swallow the second one and then see where the night takes me.<br /><br />Any Suggestions or advice would be extremely appreciated Im a little nervous since this is my first time but Im also extremely pumped :)

				Wait longer than an hour before taking the first. You&#039;ll still be coming up after an hour. I remember the night I took my first with a girl I was going with at the time. I was 16 in a club and took a second shortly after my first as I wasn&#039;t feeling it. Best experience ever taking your first pill. I would even save it for the rave so your coming up with friends and the music. You&#039;ll remember this night for the rest of your life. Your first pill is special!

				Definitely just eat the 1st one.<br /><br />After 20-30min you will start to feel a glow.&nbsp; You will just know something is different in a good way.&nbsp; An hour in you should start feeling good but when it kicks in for sure it may be a bit overwhelming, key word &quot;may&quot;, because your heart rate goes up a bit and you feel that surge of energy and euphoria out of nowhere.&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course if you are totally calm and cool about it and just let it flow, you are in for one of the best experiences of your life. Redose 1 1/2-2 hours after your first dose.<br /><br />Hope you have fun man.

				I&#039;m glad you had a good time, MDMA is one helluva drug. I want you to enjoy your MDMA experiences so I&#039;m going to share some advice.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t snort pills. They are in pill form in order for you to swallow them. <br />The binders used to keep pills together are not good for your nostrils - I&#039;m not saying that MDMA is good for your nostrils, but please do not put your smelling holes through even more stress than needs be if you&#039;re not going to benefit from the effect.<br /><br />Insufflating MDMA can be a different experience than oral use, it hits a lot harder and the effects last considerably less. Not to mention it REALLY hurts.<br /><br />Bluelight &amp; Erowid (Clearnet) are both great sources of information for harm reduction, as well as this forum.

				glad you had a blast. imo always eat mdma, you get stronger effects that last longer (takes longer to come up but better). and please stay hydrated with water. Love &amp; Light
