				First off a quote from the EZ test website...<br /><br />&quot;Phenacetin was introduced in 1887, and was used principally as an pain killer. It was one of the first synthetic fever reducers to go on the market.<br /><br />The painkiller was initially banned from general use in 1968 after it was linked to bladder and kidney cancer&quot;<br /><br />So - phenacetine sucks big time! It actually breaks down into paracetamol. As the EZ test website says&nbsp; &quot;This is pretty harmless by itself, but when you combine paracetamol with a lot of alcohol -which is pretty common for coke users- it puts an extra strain on the liver.&quot;<br /><br />And, some people really cannot use parecetamol as they have an allergic reaction to it!<br /><br />So - I recenltly bought a gram of what you would think is one of the leading UK cocaine vendors - I EZ tested it, I found phenacetine present, the vendor advised me to sell the contaminated gram for 60 quid and he would refund 40 quid!<br /><br />Some mates if you would fuck them over like that! No way would I give ANYONE bad cocaine, and whats even more puzzling is how the vendor has 5/5. <br /><br />I&#039;m not the only one who this this particular coke was total shit. Sure, it had cocaine in there. So does most street coke! The idea of snorting phenacetin or ephidrine (which may also have been present) makes me flush coke down the toilet. <br /><br />So yes, almost 110 UK pounds flushed, the &#039;49%&#039; refund ended up like 28 pounds or something. Moral of the tale? Always go to resolution - even if you get a &#039;refund&#039; on your stats - most vendors accept that we all get fucked over so most or many will have some hit on the refund stats. I would have had 2% or something - barely hit me - but I chose to come to a gentlemans agreement and keep resolution out of it.<br /><br />Worse thing is the review page is people basically telling stories worse than mine! <br /><br />So, if any UK coke vendors are reading, one in particular who I won&#039;t name - don&#039;t EVER send that posion to me ever again. A buddy IS allergic to parecetamol, big time, so thank fuck I EZ tested.<br /><br />Most expensive toilet cleaner I EVER used!!!<br /><br />I&#039;d not care if cocaine vanished forever. Life would go on. I did stop using for a good ten years and often take a break which is easy because most UK coke is really shit. The internet helped, 15 yr back we could pick off the bricks, get it mailed and even local dealers had uncontaminated brick slabs. <br /><br />Coke today is a minefield of dodgy dealers, dodgy fake bricks and wierd RCs and other active cuts which, although they can trigger cancer or fuck up a recovering cancer patient, some dealers here think its cool to inform me to sell it someone (I&#039;d presume) a bit less clever than me, to in effect &#039;rip them off&#039; which I would be doing. <br /><br />That is a vendor whose sole interest is money. I like money also but I&#039;m not going to injure someone or risk their health or mine making money.<br /><br />Offering 40% to a SR customer with 100 buys, over 10 vendors, over 5 grand and under 10, you would think they would have refunded 100% especially with a hi res photo of the EZ test. But no. 40% and advice to sell the gram on to some other poor individual.<br /><br />No good trader would do that.<br /><br />I think ALL cocaine vendors ought to EZ test each new batch, and put the photo up. Costs nothing to do that and would make us all happy because most here have not got a clue what is in their coke they just bought for 100 UK pounds plus.<br /><br />To the good UK coke vendors - you know who you are - and I&#039;m EZ testing your ass!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Sorry, but coke is THE most expensive drug (in normal life) and as an occasional user, I demand nothing but 80% + and no bloody active cuts!!!<br /><br />I am sure, many will agree.&nbsp; ::) (spend 100 quid on a drug and we want THE badabing, the full Monty, whole nine yards)<br /><br />I&#039;ll do a link to the EZ test of the dodgy coke which is now in some rats belly. I bet the rat never got high either!<br /><br />Still, that rat is better than the human one who sold me knowingly some poisonous rubbish - dismissed the hi - res photo as nothing of concern and wanted me to pass on the poison to someone else!<br /><br />Flushed it. Flushed 70 quid away. No way can I clean out ephidrine or phenacetine, and likely other cuts also.<br /><br />Red.

				That really sucks ! I know one other EU vendor recently that had batch problems, but he didn&#039;t know ! he ended up either refunding 100 % or re-shipping to those that it affected. Your vendor should do the same.
