				Hi there,<br /><br />This is my first and probably only post here. I am only putting this up here in hope&#039;s of someone listening to me.<br /><br />Anyways, I think this website should practice more harm reduction. I understand it isn&#039;t exactly easy to find, but if I am here then that means there will be many more people to come.. I found this place because of the news. It honestly didn&#039;t take me long.<br /><br />What worries me is if there are marijuana drug users coming on here and trying out heroin. I don&#039;t think this is very good because if someone comes on here and says &quot;Oh hey they&#039;ve got it all, let&#039;s try them!&quot; it&#039;s very possible that someone will become an addict and potentially ruin their lives.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying to stop selling it, but please make it more difficult to find so that only the people who already are getting it, get it. I think we can agree we don&#039;t need to burden our society any more than it already is with these dangerous substances.<br /><br />In my opinion it should be the following that should be more hidden: cocaine, heroin, crack, and methamphetamines. Obviously that may not be all of them.<br /><br />To vendors: I understand that these products not being as up-front may reduce some of your sales. However I think you should reconsider what business you are in, anyways. Regardless, these substances do ruin lives and that is something you need to strongly consider when running a business like this. If you don&#039;t then what kind of human being are you?<br /><br />Anyway, just putting that out there &#039;cause that&#039;s how I feel.<br /><br />Thanks for listening.

				I disagree. Chances are if you are smart enough to get on here, set up gpg, acquire bitcoins, etc you are smart enough to know what you are doing when it comes to drugs. SR is not here to police what people buy and keep them safe, but to provide an excellent and needed service. <br />If you are ordering heroin on SR, you more than likely know the risks involved and know how to properly handle it. If not, the vendors themselves are almost always more than happy to assist you in any questions.

				I figured someone was going to say that, but the truth is you are speculating and only hoping that doesn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />If it even happens once, don&#039;t you think one ruined life is enough?<br /><br />My point is the vendors, unless they are good humans, will not have a vested interest in keeping you not addicted to these drugs. The point is to get people hooked so they keep buying more. It&#039;s a dirty dirty business and it needs to be put out of easy view. Sure there could be vendors who aren&#039;t like that, but people can get hooked anyways because of the nature of the drug.<br /><br />Trust me, there will be more and more people figuring out how to get on to this website. If I can do it, anybody can. I&#039;m only saying this for future reference. Plus it may keep some heat off of SR&#039;s back when it comes to authorities.

				Once again, we aren&#039;t here to police anyone. We can help answer questions, give dosage advice, harm reduction advice, etc. At the end of the day a substances isn&#039;t to blame, its user is. If I buy a gram of MDMA and roll every day for ten days straight and end up a mess for a few months, who&#039;s to blame? The community who made sure the product I received was top of the line quality, gave me advice on how to dose, and keep safe? No, that was MY choice. And at the same time at least I know what I got was MDMA. If I had tried that with street pills I could have ended up with BZP, PMA, etc that would have done a lot worse than that. Same thing with heroin. <br /><br />You can lead a horse to water, but you can&#039;t make him drink.

				v01d,<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />You know actually I just re-thought my whole argument. I apologize. You are completely right. This site is already practicing harm reduction just by being here. I didn&#039;t think about the benefits it has with having multiple vendors and basically a real market.<br /><br />Plus I really need to think about why I think those drugs should be placed out of &quot;harms way&quot;. People are informed enough to be able to make decisions that won&#039;t end up ruining their lives.<br /><br />So in conclusion, well, this topic can be erased.

				I gotta be honest on this one, uberuddy71. I get pot locally through a friend in California, because of the ease of accessibility. I use maybe an ounce over two to three months, and I may go a while without. I use it primarily to calm my nerves because I hate using pharmaceuticals on a regular use. I&#039;m past the college years and before this year I&#039;ve never done anything aside very sparse amounts of cannabis. I do not drink alchohol on a normal basis and I don&#039;t even like taking aspirin or caffeine.<br /><br />I came to SR to try lysergic acid diethylamide for the first time. I plan on doing it a few times. I came here to get some psilocybin, do that a few times. When I feel I&#039;m prepared, I will most likely fly down south to try authentic Ayahuasca for a week. After that, I probably plan on some salvia locally, ordering Mescaline once from this site, maybe some 5-MeO-DMT, order some high-Thujone Absinthe from Europe, and then maybe some of the 2C family.<br /><br />After I finish making one or two attempts at each one of them, I plan on stopping. I may stop sooner. I might try Shrooms a few more times in the future.<br /><br />But I have no plans for recreational use, or habitual practice, or addiction. I have no interest in getting high, or doing the more easily purchased &quot;harder&quot; drugs. Some people on SR are just like me. They just want to try some hallucinogenics. I have no opinion on people using anything else, each person is their own string of decisions.<br /><br />I came here to get a few trips off of psychedelics and then move on with my life. Some people are content with a specific goal.<br /><br />The only thing cannabis and SR are a gateway for is the munchies. Wait, no. Though, when I saw someone selling a grenade launcher, part of me was kind of curious...so SR is a gateway from cannabis to grenade launchers.

				I hear you uberuddy...you seem like you care, and in my book you are all good, but v01d is 100% on the money as you worked out ;)<br /><br />There is heaps of harm reduction info on SR and it makes me proud to see.<br /><br />There is even usage info on vendors pages these days. What more can you ask for!!<br /><br />Dont be wanting your post deleted because there is more carers out there that possibly feel the same.<br /><br />cheers<br />NC

After that it is personal responsibility for what goes wrong(as long as product is pure and from trusted vendors).

				Since SR hasn&#039;t been monopolized by large groups with a conflict of interest, since the sales volume just isn&#039;t high enough, it provides a stable model of a free market where competition leads quality improvement and safety.&nbsp; As long as it is a community thing, and not the world&#039;s drug market, only good things can come of it.&nbsp; Unfortunately the fact that we must do all of this in secret with anonymous currency means scams will always be present.&nbsp; Legalization and regulation are key, as Holland has proven, but there is too much money in the anti-drug business for that to happen.

				If you are unwise enough to shoot a drug into your veins before you do an iota of research as to the drug&#039;s effects, you deserve whatever is coming to you. There&#039;s no reason for SR to hide &quot;harder&quot; drugs simply because people are stupid.<br /><br />Provide a link to erowid at the bottom of SR? Ok, sure.<br />Automatically hide certain products, hurting some vendors, because some drugs are more dangerous than others? Eff no.

				I would like to think the average drug user on this site is smarter than the average drug user on the street(except some of us do both), setting it up, working out encryption, bitcoins.&nbsp; Because it is mailed to us we are not the desperados from the street, who need a hit now.<br /><br />Then there is the more dificult politics, when to finalise early, identifying likely scams, how to use forums without unjustly critisizing (something many people dont understand - they seem bitter and twisted and attack all new vendors).&nbsp; Then there is tactics for building reputation.<br /><br />So I think by time anyone has made their first purchase the impulse to buy 10g of H and pump it into your veins, they have hopefully woken to themselves and get what they are comfortable with.<br /><br />The greatest harm reduction is removing us from the many small time criminals and thugs who pose as real life vendors (I know this is a generalisation, but we have all dealt with them), who cut the product with everything.<br /><br />And where else can you smoke ice and rant on a forum and some people will understand and some will even agree with you.&nbsp; Or better still you can learn from others.<br /><br />I dont really agree with guns or knifes to be on sale, but if they dont stop me from buying drugs, and dont shot me, It is not too much of a problem.
