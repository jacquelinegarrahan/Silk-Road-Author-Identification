				had access to prescription desoxyn for a while. now it&#039;s gone. made me feel normal (best way to describe it) on as little as 15mg on as-needed days.<br /><br />someone&#039;s selling on here, but it&#039;s about $95 for ten 5mg pills. that&#039;s like $28 for 15mg on days i need. looks like 1/2g of crystal goes for around $75, which comes to $2.25 per 15mg, an absolutely insane difference.<br /><br />so my question is, can i just buy crystal, grind it up in my magic bullet blender, weigh out 15mg, and put it in a capsule? i&#039;m not interested in any other roa.<br /><br />can i expect the effects to be the same? i know there&#039;s a lot of talk about crystal being &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;clean&quot;. so if it isn&#039;t 100% pure, how will that affect me? will i simply have to take a bit more, or do the things which make it impure have a psych/physical effect of their own?<br /><br />thanks for any info, much appreciated!<br />

				Theoretically, yes.<br /><br />In actuality, YMMV. The quality control and chirality (D,L) vary quite a bit from those flying under the radar. Hopefully the Silk Road can begin to address this need for information.

				You will probably be alright with methamphetamine from a pseudo cook as that will be the d-enantiomer that you want. I would look for the best reviewed product you can find and then realistically expect something like ~60-85% purity. You may need to go up in your dose but it&#039;s still much more economical. Illegal, risky, and variable - but much more economical.

				thanks for the replies. ok so i understand i may have to raise the amount because it isn&#039;t as pure.<br /><br />but my lingering question is, what exactly are these impurities? are they pharmacologically active? if so, what effects might i expect from the impurities themselves?<br />

I imagine there are authorities with more experience but I think the answer would again be &quot;it depends&quot;. <br />I&#039;m not familiar with desoxyn but since meth was compared I assume it is somewhere in the realm of ritalin and adderall (I&#039;m busy with other work currently so I&#039;m slacking in my googling). The meth I have is in shards which means it should be relatively untainted(or cut). <br /><br />Outside of cutting, the simple process of making meth is a fine set of chemical reactions. A lower purity then would simply mean that the drug was not synthesized perfectly--meaning some of the previous chemicals that were supposed to bond and make the meth compound did not bind (be it from poor condition or lack of certain chemical and so on). <br /><br />In short: There should be no real side-effects from the impurity. This is assuming you get uncut shards (which I suggest strongly). The impurities will pass through your body to no effect since it&#039;s not the full compound. The compounds that lead up to the meth compound, while certainly not safe (these are drugs--even the pharm grades aren&#039;t safe) should provide no noticeable side-effects.<br /><br /><br />tldr; The impurities are &quot;safe&quot;/nonactive. The level of the purity should be considered for the dosages placed in your caps (assume pharm = 90 - 95% /mg vs 70-85 in the meth shards)<br /><br />Cheers
