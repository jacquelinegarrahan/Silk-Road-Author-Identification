				Some information that I would love to have is how to cook powder cocaine into smokable rock form. I would love to see a tutorial on this subject. I&#039;ve only seen it done before but have never been able to replicate the results from just watching someone else do it. Can someone help me out here? Going to be needing this information in the near future. ;)

				captain I wish i could tell you from firsthand experience. <br /><br />i just saw this guy doing it in front of me with an 8ball, never really payed too much attention since, 3 years ago i had absolutely no interest in crack whatsoever. <br /><br />still dont, and i hope i never do. i would rather smoke meth, its cheaper and lasts longer. <br /><br /><br />its all chemistry, i think you are right about the google search. wikipedia might even tell you how to make it. hell if you know a little bit of chemistry, they practically tell you how to make mdma. wikipedia is the shit<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				stole this but have at it , this has always seemed the best sounding way to me.<br /><br /><br />MATERIALS:<br />1.) Lighter<br />2.) Glass Beaker<br />3.) Distilled Water<br />4.) Baking Soda<br />5.) Rubbing Alcohol<br /><br /><br />PREPARATION:<br />1.) Mix four-parts of coke to one-part of baking soda <br />in glass beaker. (Yes, that IS a 4:1 ratio) I&#039;ve done it <br />by eye &amp; found it&#039;s good not to exceed a 3:1 ratio.<br /><br />2.) Begin adding a few drops of distilled water to the <br />mix, adding only enough to turn the powder into a <br />muddy sludge-like consistency. WARNING: Do NOT <br />add too much water or your coke will not harden up <br />in the cooling process.<br /><br />3.) Drench the cotton ball with rubbing alcohol in a <br />thick metal or ceramic dish. Add only enough to <br />completely saturate the ball.<br /><br />THE COOKING PROCESS, <br />PART 1:<br />1.) Use the lighter to ignite the alcohol in the cotton <br />ball.<br />2.) While the cotton ball is burning, heat the <br />coke-sludge by swirling the beaker above the tip of <br />the flame.<br />3.) Continue swirling until the substance comes to a <br />boil, then remove it from the flame to cool.<br />When your substance has cooled it should form a <br />clump of solid &quot;rock-bubbles.&quot;<br /><br />PART 2:<br />4.) Add more distilled water to the beaker, enough to <br />stand about 1/4 inch above the hardened bubbles.<br />5.) Re-heat the substance in the beaker. When <br />thoroughly heated you will see a yellow mass <br />floating in the center of the water as you continue to <br />swirl the beaker.<br />You don&#039;t need to boil it, just heat it up until the <br />hardened bubbles melt into a yellow coke-mass.<br /><br />THE COOLING PROCESS:<br />1.) Once melted, remove the substance from the <br />flame.<br />2.) Continue swirling the beaker, (trying to keep the <br />yellow coke-blob in the center as you swirl) until the <br />water in the beaker has completely cooled.<br />3.) You should now have a solid yellow rock tinkling <br />around in your glass beaker. Remove the rock and <br />cut to desired proportions.<br />

				Similar, but a little bit different to lvlbrained&#039;s post.<br /><br />I had a friend who used a Pyrex test tube (Granted this was not anywhere near lab style, more like country boy getting it done).&nbsp; First use of the test tube required heating a baking soda misture with water inside to remove any residual stuff (I tried my first time on a new tube and the goods stuck to the sides).<br /><br />He would dump regular tap water (I would not use/suggest distilled if I still did it) into the tube, possibly 1/8 full (1&quot; of water approx) add G of powder into the solution, then a pinch of soda.&nbsp; He then heated the tube with a propane torch you often see plumbers used, rotating the tube, and not allowing one spot to get hot while rotating and swirling the tube.&nbsp; You could gradually see the cludy mixture start to torn into to one piece in the center of the tube solution.<br /><br />He then took the tube, and dunked ut into a glass of ice water and again rotated for about 10-15 seconds.&nbsp; There was the most SOLID rock I ever tried (I did spoon cooking before this).&nbsp; The rock was dumped onto a coffee filter and given a few minutes to let the water dry off the rock.<br /><br />That was it and it worked like a charm.

				So tell me if I&#039;m utterly underinformed about crack, but I was under the impression that crack and freebase cocaine are the same thing. If they are, then I didn&#039;t see why the process for making the freebase form of cocaine was any different than the process for any other drug.<br /><br />Please enlighten me.

The drug in crack is indeed freebase cocaine but crack usually refers to freebase cocaine mixed with baking soda, cut, and who knows what while freebase refers to freebase of a much higher purity.&nbsp; If one performs the conversion in a container simply by heating baking soda, coke&nbsp; water&nbsp; and then heating until the water is gone then all the cuts plus unreacted baking soda remain in the product. Even if one skims the freebase cocaine off the top of the baking soda water some baking soda still comes with it. While I have seen some old pros produce some top notch shit using baking soda I find ammonia to make far more sense in every way. The product is cleaner, the process simpler, quicker and doesn&#039;t require any experience or technique much at all. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
