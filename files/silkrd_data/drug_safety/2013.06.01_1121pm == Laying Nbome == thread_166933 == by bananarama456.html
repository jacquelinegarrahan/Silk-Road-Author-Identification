				So in the past I have done this and for some reason they keep ending up uneven. My first few attempts were perfect but then they kept getting more and more uneven; like you can actually see a lot of the crystal on the edges of the sheets. I have personally dosed the hits(only 1/4 of a hit at a time) that seemed heavy with the chemical and they didn&#039;t seem to be too overly powerful at all, but I still wonder about how concentrated the hits were or even if they were uneven at all. Is there an easier way to making sure the sheet lays evenly?

				What solvent are you using?&nbsp; Have you tried 90%&nbsp; to absolute (100%) alcohol? On a warm- hot surface with light ventilation to aid with rapids drying (NO open flame though)?<br />That helps tremendously ime.<br /><br />What&#039;s your concentration? Maybe its too dilute? nbomes are pretty soluble and you can achieve a pretty high concentration<br /><br />

				To get a sheet of anythng perfectly even you would literally have to get some sort of machine made for laying blotter (which I doubt exists) or you would have to manually go through all 1000 or however many blotters with a medicine dropper. This is not practical for most, so obtain a small beaker in which you place ~20-25ml of solvent (less would likely be fine), and then spread the solvent as evenly as possible on the blotter. There will always be human error, of course, but here is another thing you can do: when laying the blotter, position the blotter so the white side is facing up. Now you have a way to determine what parts have specifically been covered and what parts have not. The parts that have will be darker. The parts that have not will be the same white color. Again, try to spread the liquid as evenly as possible, and adjust the volume of solvent to the size of your particular blotter so that you have &quot;just enough.&quot; Perform the laying process in a pyrex caserole dish or tin or something similar. I hope this helped you, young entrepeneur ;)<br /><br />Use either ethanol (everclear 95%) or IPA (70%) as a solvent. Do not use denatured alcohol or methanol; these are poisonous to human beings.
