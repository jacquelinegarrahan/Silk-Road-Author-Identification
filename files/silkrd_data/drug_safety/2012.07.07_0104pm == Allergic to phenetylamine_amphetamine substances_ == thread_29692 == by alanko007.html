				(I COPIED THIS FROM DF, TOO LAZY TO REWRITE IT, IGNORE THE &quot;SWIMS&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br />SWIM had the chance to try some speed (amphetamine sulfate). He got it from a fairly reliable vendor, according to the lab tests it was around 50% pure and SWIM heard some good feedback on it. The compound was wet at first, but it dried really quickly. It had a mild chemical smell and burned a little in the nose. The first day SWIM tried it, he snorted just a very small amount, could be around 5-10mg and felt very little effects. Mild stimulation, mild anxiety and that was it. So the next day, SWIM went to a party and decided to take the speed with him.<br /><br />At approx. 6pm, SWIM snorted a small amount (10mg or so). Surprisingly, he felt a bit of an energy rush. He had been continuously redosing during the night, though just very small amounts which kept him awake. No euphoria was present, he was just sociable. He had also consumed a few beers.<br /><br />At 4AM, he ingested 0,5mg xanax and went to sleep. When he woke up at around 8-9AM, he felt really weird and freaked out. His mouth was terribly dry, he had a bad case of vertigo, some nausea was present and he generally felt terrible. He tried to get back to sleep, without success. He started to imagine (unvoluntarily) deeply disturbing images, which were followed by serious OEVs, confusion and a loss of stability. SWIM also noticed some numbness in his fingers. SWIM really freaked out at this moment, he was a bit paranoid and kept thinking what was happening. He couldn&#039;t even talk to someone because of how confused he was. Additionally, his heart started racing violently and he felt very hot. The only thing that kept SWIM sane was the fact that other friends who used the same speed that night felt no significant negative effects from it. SWIM calmed down in the next 2-3 hours, though he vomitted violently (2 times). The hallucinations subsided and SWIM actually felt quite good. Calm, the colors were really vivid and everything seemed nice. A state similar to a string dose of LSA.&nbsp; SWIM had some diarrhea during the afternoon, but he felt fine.<br /><br />I doubt it was a hangover since SWIM drank only a little (for him) and SWIM was 90% sober when he went to sleep. What he finds strange is that the discomfort started approx. 7 hours after the last dose of the amphetamine and had been gradually getting worse. And what about the strong OEVs? And the massive confusion? Rapid heartbeat? Doesn&#039;t sound like a hangover to him.<br /><br />Also, he recently tried MDMA (100% tested MDMA, no other substance) for the first time and experienced similar effects (minus the vomiting and the visuals), but it started 4 hours after ingestion. He was sweating profusely, extremely tired, couldn&#039;t walk, had a bad diarrhea and felt nauseous.<br /><br />All in all, it seems like he has been experiencing some sort of phenetylamine/amphetamine allergic reactions.<br /><br />Any ideas? Thanks and stay safe :)

				Well actually, I had been feeling a little sick a few days prior to the experience. Nothing serious though. Regarding medication, I only have a mild kratom habit. Nothing else. I can&#039;t remember if I had taken kratom that day or the day before the experience (seems like I should reconsider the term &quot;mild&quot; :D)

				Possible, but I still don&#039;t understand the strong hallucinations and the actually pleasant &quot;afterglow&quot; when all the negative symptoms subsided.
