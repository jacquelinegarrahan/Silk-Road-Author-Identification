				I&#039;ve had a similar desire and think that if you or I were to experiment, perhaps it&#039;d be best to start with oral ingestion. I know theusualsuspect and mrouid have pills which are supposed to contain meth and some users have said that they even eat crystals. At least this way you can ease your way into it and be as careful as one can be while first sampling meth.

				You still can get meth mouth johnny...meth mouth isnt from the meth itself, its from the cottonmouth you get when you get high.<br />Uhh tbh me personally, i wouldnt bother with meth sold on SR because of how god damn overpriced it is. Look up the PURE price for a gram in the DEA 2011 threat assessment, its lower than the SR prices, and i dont give a fuck what any of the vendors say, they dont have pure dope unless they cooked it themselves and washed it out real good. Even then, its not worth what they&#039;re asking for it.<br />If you&#039;r egonna do it, smoke it.<br />As someone whos just starting to use methamphetamine (VERY experienced dexedrine user, i can kill more than 300mg in a night if i want to...), I wanted to smoke straight from the get go, and didn&#039;t feel the true power of meth till i hit dat pipe....snorting is alright but god damn, when you smoke....<br />But dont bother with the SR meth tbh, WAY fucking overpriced. I can get grams for about half that actually a little bit less (and the northeast there is no meth PERIOD), and i live on the east coast in the northeast, given they&#039;re cut grams, but so is any meth thats gonna get sold on SR....its hard drugs, cocaine heroin meth etc its ALL cut to some extent, every time it changes hands its cut a little more.<br />pure methamphetamine just isnt gonna happen on here...its hella fun though, but in my very limited experience with it (bought half gram sacks twice so far, got teh 2nd half g this week, all gone in 2-3 days.....) you will want more when its all gone, pretty bad. But god damn, smoking till your vision gets so blurred that you cant even see the tweak in the pipe=WINNING.

				just be carefull and set a limit for yourself. the best thing about sr is it lets you try what would usually be very habit forming drugs and killing off what makes them habit forming which is a quick and constant supply. with SR you have a constant supply but it takes 1-2 weeks to get it(from getting btc to shipment) so by the time you get it your no longer jonesing for more. buy a half a gram and try not to do it more then once a month is my advice. also make sure you eat during your binge. force yourself if you have to but u will feel like death if you stay up with a heightened metabolism and nothing to burn.

				Yes, set a limit and keep your will power strong. When you start to say &quot;Oh, one more night without sleep won&#039;t hurt&quot; or &quot;After this gram I won&#039;t buy another&quot; , you should cut and run. The Faces of Meth are total bullshit. If those people really go from being normal to skeletons in 3 months, they&#039;re fucking dumbasses anyway for hitting themselves in the face with a hammer so many times cause &quot;meth is so kool&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using meth for 1 year &amp; 2 months, smoking meth for close to 7 months right now, I brush my teeth 2 times a day &amp; I drink water everyday (I won&#039;t lie, I have a coke occasionally), my teeth are still in my head as of yet. I went to the dentist a few months ago &amp; had 2 cavities that I had taken care of, no big deal. Teeth clenching &amp; grinding are what get me though, sometimes I do it without realizing and my mouth/jaw will get sore, but I try to just chew some gum or something..<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a problem with picking at my face, I don&#039;t know why some people do. Alot of people say you use meth and think there are bugs under your skin and try to pick them out, but that&#039;s total horse shit. Meth makes you completely alert and focused, it doesn&#039;t turn you into a psychopath. When you abuse it for a long time, you will become basically emotionally numb for the most part, but as long as your careful you won&#039;t have to worry about abusing it.<br /><br />Another thing, I try not to talk to my family members(or anyone that I don&#039;t want to know that I&#039;m high) very often when I&#039;m feeling happy/talkative. You&#039;ll ramble on about nothing for 30 minutes, stumble over your words and look like a total weirdo, so try to resist that phone call to your mother to let her know you love her or tell her what funny thing your cat just did. If the person knows what you are like normally, they will probably know something is up.<br />Strangers don&#039;t know you though, so shooting a brief with the cashier at Walgreens or whatever is usually alright, hahah. :)<br /><br />Also, marsvolta12&#039;s advice is very good &amp; accurate:<br />&quot;with SR you have a constant supply but it takes 1-2 weeks to get it(from getting btc to shipment) so by the time you get it your no longer jonesing for more. buy a half a gram and try not to do it more then once a month is my advice. also make sure you eat during your binge. force yourself if you have to but u will feel like death if you stay up with a heightened metabolism and nothing to burn.&quot;<br /><br />Meth will make you feel great, I would never ever tell a person not to try it, but be very careful.<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />Here&#039;s a thread I started about smoking crystal meth:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6014.0<br /><br />Not sure if you&#039;re interested in using it that way, but it&#039;s got a video to demonstrate how to do it &amp; some people have said it was helpful. :)

				Meth can be extremely dangerous if you have an addictive personality. If you do, don&#039;t try it. If you have good self control, it can still be seen as a casual great high. I have really enjoyed it over the last 5 years, but never more than 4 or 5 times a year. I have a very affluent career and plenty of assets. I also know that the harder drugs can get a grip on you if you are not careful. So, be careful. See it as an activity you want to experience every once in a while and stick to your plan. You will not be disappointed.

				once you do meth most people only quit when they have caused irreversible brain damage. after prolonged abusive use you will no longer get &quot;high&quot; from meth. you will barely feel a thing. this is normally after you have lost everything you ever thought you cared about. for other people the drug doesn&#039;t work very well with their brain chemistry. treat this drug with the respect she deserves.

				I like oral ingestion alot actually, mainly for work cause it gets me going hard but different from smoking, similar to sniffing but more drawn out. To me it feels like dex-amp on steroids and lasts well past my regular hours which gives me the opportunity to make overtime.<br /><br />I smoke mainly during the weekend/weekdays. But honestly, although i&#039;ve had my share of fun with methamphetamine, its never got to me like I hear from so many others. Luckily (if u wanna call it that) I had a daily amphetamine habit long before ever trying meth, so to me its another version of amph, but one that lasts much longer and works much better, plus its actually cheaper for me so long as I control myself. <br /><br />Plus with my tolerance to the effects I can sleep within an hour of when it first starts to fade, and with oral and nasal use I can eat no problem while high.<br /><br />Not saying this is a particularly good thing by any means but it works for me and thats all I care about.<br /><br />FYI magnesium taurate/citrate will do wonders for your tolerance, google it.

				He says in the listing his meth isn&#039;t 100% pure, you mean high purity meth (in the title) right?<br />just fucking around...<br />anyway, mind you i havent fucked around with the shards too much yet, IMO methamphetamine is the ultimate high in terms of non &quot;mind expanding&quot; drugs&quot;...i&#039;ve never used cocaine, or heroin (done oxycodone and other pharms, not my thing at all, dont like...)..but smoking methamphetamine is one of the best feelings i&#039;ve ever felt.<br />Meth IMO is just kinda &quot;meh&quot; snorted, i mean dont get me wrong, its real good, but it&#039;s not that much stronger/better high-wise than just a good proper dose of dexedrine (done lots of dexedrine in my days...)<br />Never did oral admin, and i haven&#039;t banged shards (yet), but IMO if you&#039;re gonna do meth, smoke or shoot...<br />smoking you gotta do it right or you wont get high though, and smoking is very moreish, but god DAMN...the rush....<br />i&#039;ve only used a gram of good methamphetamine in total since i first got access like 3 months ago (but if i had money, and more access,&nbsp; i would&#039;ve used a hell of a lot more), so i&#039;m rather inexperienced...but i&#039;ve bene using pharms for 3 years now (and to the point of doing 3-400mg of dexedrine in a night if i want to), and unless you&#039;re smoking (or shooting, obviously), meth isn&#039;t IMO that much better than the RX shit, the meth high snorted i&#039;d have a hard time differentiating that from a good high dose of dexedrine, highwise..<br />

				I think the best harm reduction is actually the boring one - moderation<br /><br />I am kind of a binge user will take a large amount - foils, smoking (No IV scared of needles) and be up and partying or whatever for 24 to 48 hours, then I want have any until I have completely recovered.<br /><br />-&nbsp; have eaten and slept properly for a week (unless I go for a few cold beers)<br />- I get a few pimples from one night so once they have cleared up it is a good indication I have recovered and can destroy myself again<br /><br />- I dont find it addictive, I probably use 2-3 times a month and I do have some addiction problems - gambling mainly.&nbsp; But I do enjoy it.
