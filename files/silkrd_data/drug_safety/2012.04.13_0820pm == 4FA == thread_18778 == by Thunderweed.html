				Title: <strong>4FA</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Just tried some of this but the info I found on the clearnet is obscure because it&#039;s kind of a rare drug.<br /><br />Few questions about 4FA(study drug similar to amphetamines):<br />1. How long does the high last usually?<br />2. What&#039;s the recommended intake for oral doses?<br />3. What damage can 4FA cause if not taken regularly?

				Orally it can last ~4-6 hours, but this will vary between person to person. Insuffulated it lasts a couple of hours.<br /><br />Oral dosage depends on the person. A lot of people are saying around 160mg -200mg<br /><br />None.<br /><br />Also worth noting that it is a very good drug imo. It sits somewhere between MDMA and Amphetamine although is less potent by weight.

				DO NOT SNORT! (I know you asked for orally, but please take my word. You do not wanna snort this shit.) <br /><br />1.There are two parts of 4fa high. The first is the part where you get the empathy and euphoria. It comes in waves. That part last anywhere between an hour to 2 hours. Then you slowly transcend into the second part of the high. The closest thing i can compare it to is straight amphetamine. It&#039;s a straight speed high. You&#039;re up and alert. That high normally lasts for about 2 to 4 hours. Then your left with stimulation for about 3 to 6 hours. If you want to obtain sleep before the physical stimulation has passed you&#039;ll have to use something to help you sleep. <br /><br />2.It depends what you want out of the drug. If you want something that is going to help you study or work on a project, something where you don&#039;t want to be distracted. Start small somewhere in the 50mg range. If you want a full blown speed high and a slight roll feeling. Then i would say anywhere between 90mg to 115 mg. Like i said work your way up. Start small. I took 100mg my first time and i was highly over stimulated and i was wanting to do some school work. All i ended up doing was working out for about an hour and a half. This chemical is really dose sensitive. Really takes a while to find that sweet spot.&nbsp; If you want to use a bump i would recommend taking the bump an hour and a half or 2 hours after your initial dose. That way your bump will hit u when it&#039;s turning into a straight speed high and the rolling effect will come back slightly. <br /><br />3.Really miju7? SMH. Since it is a research chemical. We don&#039;t have much sound evidence to go off. There are many theories that is it highly neurotoxic. So if this is turns out to be true. I guess there long term effects would be the same as amph. with higher neurotoxic. Hard on the heart and possible irreversible brain damage.&nbsp; Or it could turn out to be complexly safe because of it&#039;s molecular structure. <br /><br />4fa can provide an amazing high. Loads of euphoria. If you are going to partake in this chemical then i highly suggest you maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and smoke weed while using it. (Since there is a theory thc might help in preventing neurotoxicity.)<br /><br />Oh one last thing. If you are going to redose (Bump) take into consideration that you will be stimulated 6 hours after that bump. I&#039;m not saying you&#039;ll be high for that long, but you&#039;ll still be up. Which might lead to you going on a binge because you didn&#039;t get sleep and have things you have to do the next day. That&#039;s why i recommend you take the redose after the initial dose anywhere between an hour to 2 hours. <br /><br />I know there is a lot of people that can&#039;t understand why people would consume 4fa. But, no one can understand until they have experienced the euphoria of some good 4fa.

				Thanks sniper, and yeah definitely don&#039;t snort this shit, it hurts like a bitch lol.<br /><br />Something weird though, first time I used it the high lasted for over 12 hours. Dosage was uncertain though, since my friend just dropped some in a bottle of milk and forgot how much there was inside. That&#039;s never happening again!

				You can snort it fine. It just stings for a few secs after that is all. Snorting has the difference of being shorter lasting.<br /><br />He asked if there would be any neurotoxic effects if not taken regularly. There is not going to be much if any, studies showed that even in rats it was hardly neurotoxic. Humans can recover their brain better.
