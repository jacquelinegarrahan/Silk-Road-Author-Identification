				I&#039;m about to have 100mg of 2C-B Hbr, and plan on splitting it between me and four other friends (so 5 people). 2C-B hbr is apparently the slightly softer form of 2C-B, and makes it both slightly easier to snort and slightly less potent. My friends and I want to get rid of the awkward 2 hour come-up period, so we&#039;ve agreed to snort it. We&#039;ve all tried psychedelics before, and are good at keeping healthy mindsets. <br /><br />This being said, since the stuff is slightly weaker than the other form of 2C-B, would five 20mg lines of the stuff be doable? I really don&#039;t want to waste any, because this will be the last time I use it. I&#039;ve heard stories of people snorting as much as 30 and having a blast, and snorting 10 and losing their shit. So I just wanted to know if my plan sounds doable or not. I&#039;d love to hear from people who&#039;ve tried this.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I have snorted this drug before and would suggest snorting 10 mg, waiting, and then going for the second 10 mg after 30 minutes. This way, if you&#039;re going to lose your shit off 10 mg you&#039;ll know it right away and after 30 minutes you&#039;ll have an idea of how intense it will be getting. Adding 10 mg on top of that will probably double the effects that you are already experiencing so be prepared for that. Be safe, the 2C-X series are very dose-sensitive!

				I mostly agree with zipstyle, but the additional 10mg will more than double the effects. more like multiply them than add.&nbsp; I&#039;d consume an additional 5mg after 20-30 minutes and go from there.

				The dosing requirements are pretty similar. You&#039;ll probably need about 10% more of the HBR vs. HCL for the same high but at this dosing curve it&#039;s easy enough to treat them the same. For how much to take that can be a bit tough, I&#039;d probably start with railing 10mg, waiting about 30 minutes and then rail a 5mg bump and then another 5mg if needed a while after that. The come up on 2CB tends to be a bit rough through the nose at lager doses so staging the intake will give your body some time to get up to the high without loosing your lunch. You&#039;ll probably want a little pot on hand as it goes well with the 2CB enhancing the visuals and provides a higher mindset than the otherwise clearheaded space that 2CB has on it&#039;s own.
