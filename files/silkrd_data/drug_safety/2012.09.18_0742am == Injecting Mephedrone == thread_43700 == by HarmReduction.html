				ya that&#039;s the only way I do meph, when I do it. it is extremely corrosive on the veins, you can feel a sharp burn going up your arms. The high is amazing though, although towards the end of a binge you are getting no effects and the paranoia starts to kick in. the type of paranoia where your hearing sirens from throughout the city and thinking they are all about to bust through your door, flashing TV sets through your neighbors windows are flashlights of the cops who are about to raid your pad, you will look out the window so long you will actually want to see a cop car just so you feel like you&#039;ve accomplished something.<br /><br />usually the day after an I.V. meph binge isn&#039;t so bad, but if you continue it it gets substantially worse every day until you will just stop doing it. The drug will stop working eventually, and no matter what insane doses you are injecting you get little to no effect but buzzing and paranoia.<br /><br />This is definitely an ROA that requires proper injection techniques, although generally more pure then street drugs you can run into some trouble if you&#039;re not careful. The thing is no body really knows the effects of this one, so use with extreme caution.<br /><br />as for physical side effects for the 2 or so days after a heavy I.V. meph binge (4 grams or so) I experienced some pretty severe vasoconstriction in my arms. tinglyness and numbness really scared me because I didn&#039;t know if they would go away or not. they have since gone away (5 days since last use) but they still freaked me out a bit.)<br /><br />I reccomend waiting until most of the effects and the craving has worn off between shots, it will make your supply last longer, the effects will stay strong, and you won&#039;t feel as cracked out. thats about all I can say off the top of my head but if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to I.V. coke this one is the best I&#039;ve found.

				the only reason why I do it (and I do it ver rarely, maybe once every 6 months) is because injecting is the only way I enjoy doing drugs. It&#039;s the only way I can justify taking a drug, but after the last binge it&#039;&#039;s going to be real hard justifying doing it again. the bad outweighs the good exponentially. if you&#039;re an I.V. drug/stimulant user though I can totally see how it would be tempting.

				I think this is one of those times where I&#039;m gunna have to refuse to accept this happens. It&#039;s like black pudding, I know it exists but I don&#039;t want it to so I&#039;m just gunna act like it doesn&#039;t and carry on with life from the point before this was discussed.

				I was told that this is a big no no as a route of administration for mephedrone and it is a very big problem where I am.. even though I don&#039;t personally know of anyone doing it and would never even contemplate doing it myself.<br /><br />I was told that heroin users will get sores on their skin after injecting over a period of time but I think it was due to the toxicity of mephedrone people can get sores on the skin after just one attempt of injecting it.<br /><br />I stay away from injecting anything really, got a big phobia of needles.
