				I don&#039;t have easy access too mimosa hostilis rootbark, but Phalaris arundinacea grows all over the place.<br /><br />However Phalaris arundinacea contains more alkaloids than just NN-DMT, most worryingly it has Gramine in it. <br />Could this cause any adverse physical&nbsp; affect or somehow make my DMT experience less enjoyable ? <br /><br />Never done dmt before btw.

				no. but be careful if you extract. phaalris contains gramine. thats toxic. I did a lot of research on this subject a few years ago. I think gramine is non toxic smoked and its ok because it gets destroyed by heat.&nbsp; but you should not attempt to eat it. that could land you in pure hell hospital trip.

				The problem with Phalaris, apart gramine, is that ALL (and I mean all) the reports I&#039;ve read about DMT extracts from the plant seems much more like a 5-Meo-DMT experience than a pure N-N-DMT one. In my opinion phalaris contains a lot of other alkaloids that make the trip substantially different from an usual DMT trip.<br /><br />Naturally this can also be something you may like or purposely want to research upon, but if you want to use Phalaris to obtain an extract of pure N-N-DMT because you like that particular experience then I would stay away from Phalaris (or be extremely cautious and meticulous on the extract part). Yes, it is everywhere, but there&#039;s a reason why it is not used so much nowadays even while being so easy to find; it was used much more for a short time, when the book &quot;Psychedelic Shamanism&quot; came out and the author pointed out that Phalaris was a very cheap way to obtain DMT (for smoking, so gramine was not so much of an issue there), but by and by it got in disuse just because people started to acknowledge the fact that what you obtain is not the usual DMT trip in its pure form (but it&#039;s also true that many of these people didn&#039;t surely research on a properly extract, so if you do it you can actually have different results). <br /><br />If you have problems importing Mimosa where you live you can try Acacia species instead, but if you really have nothing better then go with Phalaris; just try to make the cleanest extract you can, especially on the defat part and on the washing. I would also do a mandative re-crystallization with Phalaris, so as to try to remove as much impurities as you can.

I think I will try anyway and see how it goes, in worst case I´ll just order extracted DMT from SR.

				There are some vendors on SR that have a very pure product, something that you will be challenged on making by yourself on the kitchen with common tools.<br />Extracting DMT by your own it&#039;s surely less costly overall, but sincerely in the end it really all depends on how much you plan on using. If you just want to try it and/or make a normal personal use thorough I don&#039;t know it it&#039;s really that much convenient to extract DMT on your own vs. buying it already extracted (especially if you acquire a contact with a vendor that makes a special price for you). But naturally if you use 2-3 grams a month - as an example - the thing changes.

				Yah, I had read that Phalaris grass not only contains 5-MeO-DMT but also gramine which is a poison. The gramine levels in it are supposed to be very small but its still there. Extracting is a fair amount of work too, and you have to make sure you get the right Naphtha (assuming that&#039;s what you&#039;re using) because most brands leave a nasty oil residue on the end product if you don&#039;t freeze-precipitate.<br /><br />If I were you I would just order some off SR, most of these guys know what they&#039;re doing and can make a very pure product anyways.
