				Hi<br />Would love to hear your stories and experiences on the combination of the two, preferably in pure form. ive read 70 mg mdma 30 mg mda and also 100 mg mdma 30mg mda...<br /><br />anyone do 50/50? or more mda than mdma? or is it better to have the mda by itself? <br /><br />does the mdma balance or make the mda trip easier? ive only had the combination in pressed pills so im not sure what the proportions were... it was fun though ! esp when i closed my eyes i saw objects appear and writing being written (must have been low dose)&nbsp; :D

				I have a titanic sized natural tolerance to MDMA and MDA, so I did 125 MDMA and 45 MDA, Rolled my balls off, and it wasn&#039;t too overpowering of either, just the right mix, I&#039;d suggest doing a 70/30 split, and then do bumps of 25 mg of MDMA and 10 mg of MDA until you get the comfort zone, the MDA does sneak up on you though, so I&#039;d watch it.

				This is easily the best combo around in my opinion, they just work so well together. 70% mdma/30% mda is great if you prefer the feelings of mdma however I&#039;ve tried 50/50 and loved it, but I love the trippiness of MDA which sometimes freaks people out when they are used to mdma by itself. I have&nbsp; done a combo roll from stuff sourced from SR (cosmicwizard and dqb a couple months ago, gonna try dopeboy&#039;s goods tomorrow night) and gotta say its easily been one of the best highs Ive ever had. <br /><br />Music is indescribably good with this combo, you may find yourself less motivated to move around than pure mdma but you should still be able to dance. Sex is even better haha. I find its hard to not say what you are thinking to the point you might tell someone some pretty personal stuff and regret it.. But thats also part of the fun right? MDA you get some worse nystugmus and bruxia (eye wiggles and jaw tension) so prepare for that too.&nbsp;
