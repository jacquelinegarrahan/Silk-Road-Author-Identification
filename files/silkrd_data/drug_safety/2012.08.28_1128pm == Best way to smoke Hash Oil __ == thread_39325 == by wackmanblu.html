				Just got some oil and I&#039;m wondering about the best way to &quot;do&quot; it. Was thinking about heating up the glass vial it came in and melting some onto a J . I dunno, sorry if this is a naive thread I&#039;m just looking for the most economical way to experiment. Anyone have any good ideas?

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There are very few ways to smoke oil.&nbsp; Most economical is defiantly &#039;spots&#039; or hot knives or whatever.&nbsp; It can also be mixed with weed, or tea from a tea bag, smoked in a cone or a joint.&nbsp; The other way is off tin foil, WHICH IS EXTREMELY HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH. <br />&nbsp;<br />First of all don&#039;t heat the vial.&nbsp; Use a ball point sewing pin to get it out.&nbsp; You&#039;ll only need a tiny bit if its good stuff. <br />&nbsp;<br />If you are unfamiliar with spotting, best bet is to watch some video.&nbsp; If you want to try it.&nbsp; Get a butter knife, find a way of heating it.&nbsp; The best bet is a gas stove top or burner, an electric ring stovetops will also work if done right, hand held butane burners with a blue flame can work too. (ceramics and flat electric stovetops have been used but it takes a degree of skill).&nbsp; Get a small piece of cardboard (we use the cardboard flap of zigzag rolling papers in New Zealand), and roll in into a thin tube, about the size of a nice joint.&nbsp; Roll a joint paper around it so it keeps in shape, this is called a &#039;hooter&#039;.&nbsp; Heat the knife up, rub the oil pin on the hot part of the knife while holding the cool part, suck through the hooter to inhale the smoke.&nbsp; Sit down before you fall over&nbsp; &nbsp;;D.&nbsp; This method is very economical, but takes a bit of practice. <br />&nbsp;<br />A joint/cone with oil is pretty self explanatory,&nbsp; use the pin to mix the weed and oil first, this can be very messy.&nbsp; But this method is simple and a good place to start, but it doesn&#039;t compare to the economy and strong hit you get from spots.<br /><br />WARNING:&nbsp; Heating aluminum with may release fumes that are harmful to health, this method is highly unrecomended, however I include it for educational purposes<br />There are also people who smoke it on foil, like chasing the dragon with heroin.&nbsp; You get peice of tin foil (which is really aluminum foil most of the time).&nbsp; Then you wave your lighter under the foil with the intend of burning of anything harmful so that you dont inhail it.&nbsp; You will see all the fumes that come off.&nbsp; Then you rub a few dots of oil on the foil.&nbsp; You heat the oil from underneath with the lighter while inhailing with a hooter (as explained in spotting section).<br /><br /><br /><br />Feel free to ask any questions and I will try to answer them :).

				Hey KiwiBuds, <br /><br />Thanks for the straight-up advice. I ordered this stuff as a bit of a novelty and haven&#039;t tried it before. Since posting this thread I&#039;ve looked online at other methods and, as you suggested, spotting seems to be the most recommended, although for me it seems a bit &#039;utility heavy&#039; if that makes sense.<br /><br />The oil itself seems kind of solid, as in not runny at all, the consistency is kind of like warm roof tar; is that normal? I&#039;m thinking that I may just try spreading some with the end of a pin on one of my joints. Hope it doesn&#039;t blaze out of control. If I go with this method how much should I use? I&#039;ll wait for the weekend before I fire it up and post what happens here. <br /><br />BTW, I&#039;m in Canada, don&#039;t ya just love the times we live in. Whodathunk 30 years ago that someone in N.Zealand could advise a dude in North America how to blow hash oil in real time.

				Hahaha yea, years ago this would have been some sci-fi shit&nbsp; :D.<br /><br />Oil can be colored anything from green to gold to red to black or even a clear color.&nbsp; It should roughly be the consistancy of honey, but the consistacy changes with temperature.&nbsp; If its cold where you are, then its very likely to be quite thick.&nbsp; You can tell alot about the oil by looking at its consistancy and color.&nbsp; Really runny oil can often be a sign a high level of solvent still being in your product, how ever, if you lived somewhere hot, this might be considered normal.&nbsp; If it has a bit of a gritty texture, this could indicate contaminants such as dust or small peices of plant matter, usually from incorrect filtering during production, but can also be caused by an inexpirianced producer burning his product.&nbsp; Different solvents can also change the consistancy.&nbsp; <br /><br />The&nbsp; color is a good indicator of strength.&nbsp; If your oil has a green color, then it is of low quality and full of chlorophyll.&nbsp; If it is red, then it has been left in the sun during its production, this is often sold as higher quality oil, but its is nothing special, the sunlight may even have decomposed some of the THC.&nbsp; Most quality oils are colored from a near clear color (very rare), which is super potent, to gold color, which is still highly potent, this is the adverage example of primo oil.&nbsp; Most common is a very dark gold to black color.&nbsp; This is commericial oil.&nbsp; It is no where is potent is proper gold oil, but make no mistake, it is still strong shit. Be careful :).<br /><br />Another way to smoke it in a joint, which is probably easier than mixing it with the bud, is to rub it all over the inside of the paper, it will roll a bit easier.<br /><br />Good luck bud, let us know it goes.<br /><br /><br />Edit: as to how much, oil isnt a very exact science, for 1 person, maybe 3 small pin points (use the metal end for the record :D) if you&#039;re spotting, or 1 pin scoop if you&#039;re mixing it with a joint

				If you can&#039;t get a Ti pad/nail any time soon, try the hot knife method as someone already mentioned. Just heat a stainless steel knife or spoon until it&#039;s red hot, let it cool for till it&#039;s barely red, then dab the oil on it while inhaling with a glass bong stem turned upside down (keep it close while inhaling).<br /><br />For use with bud, get some oil on your pin then heat up the middle with a lighter while you hold it over the weed. When it gets hot, the oil will drip off the pin and onto your packed bowl. Put a tiny bit of weed on top as well to shield the bho from direct contact with the lighter flame.<br /><br />You can also smoke just the oil by dripping it onto some ashes in your bowl. Make sure you hover the flame an inch above the oil rather than trying to light it. All these techniques take practice, so don&#039;t be surprised if your first few times are a bit awkward.<br /><br />Does anyone know how safe it is to dab on stainless steel? The hardcore oil heads avoid pieces with stainless steel parts, like springs and hinges. Is it really that bad? I mean, food preparation materials are made with SS and they cook our food at hundreds of degrees, especially in BBQ grills. Even though a torch is hotter than a grill, you still let the steel cool before you dab, at least I do. You aren&#039;t supposed to do it while the surface is still red hot.

				OK for all you inexperienced users <br />Ok wackmanblu thanks for buying my oil and as people saying the colours are different grades that is way of <br /><br />the best way is get a plastic pop bottle and melt a thumb size hole in the 1 side now take a strong pin ( as my oil is as thick as roof tar right wackmanblu)<br />now light a cigarette and wipe the end of the pin with oil on the hot heater of the cigarette make sure you have a nice size dab and wipe the whole dab&nbsp; and then insert into the hole in the bottle watch the end of the cigarette you will see the smoke rise when the smoke starts to slow down on the end of the lit cigarette remove the cigarette and open the cap and inhale deep (This is the time when your eyes will roll and you will cough 1 lung out your mouth and the other out your ass. (sit back and feel the stone)<br /><br />I still say I have the cleanest oil on SR by FAR<br /><br />BB6778<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hey BigBill, <br />Yes this is indeed your stuff. I&#039;m gonna try it tonight, see what its all about and report back. I&#039;ll probably just paint the outside of a doobie to start with.

				Hey, Kiwibuds;<br /><br />So some I&#039;ve been smokin this stuff for a few days now over labor day weekend. Got to say, adds a whole new dimension to my normal weed high. Funny thing though, on the outside of my dubbie where I put the oil, when I spark it up, there&#039;s almost no scent (other than the weed of course), that the oil is even there. Is this normal? Also, while it also looks almost black, when I spread it out on my joint it takes a green color. The consistency is like warm roof tar, but when I put some on a pin and heat the middle of the pin (away from the scrapings) it melts right onto the joint.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not doubting BigBills&#039;s stuff, just trying to understand what makes a great oil.

				Hey wackmanblu,<br />It is very normal for oil to have little or no scent, while it is a common myth that cannabis with a stronger odour has a stronger effect, the odour is created by different chemicals in the cannabis than the ones that get you stoned.&nbsp; Oil contains alot of the cannibinoids that get you stoned, which no containing the odourous checmicals.<br /><br />Unfortunately the green color is probibly an indicator of chlorophyll as an impurity.&nbsp; Stronger oil will usually spread more of a gold color.&nbsp; However, this sounds like quite a rare and exotic oil and sounds like its worth a try.&nbsp; I assume the tarry consistancy is because of the rum used to make it, in New Zealand it only goes tarry when its been kept in the fridge or freezer, ours is usually made with Iso-Propyl Alcohol, and has a very smooth texture.<br /><br />The behavour of the oil with the heat is normal, oil will go very gooey and melt when it gets hot, often running out of its container. Oil can be extremely messy.&nbsp; It will hold together better when its been kept in the fridge or freezer.

				The reason for the chlorophyll is because of the solvent used to extract.&nbsp; <br /><br />OP- you really wanna read this thread.&nbsp; This will give you some insight on the extraction methods and the quality of what you&#039;re smoking / vaping.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;ve only touched the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27831.msg427466<br /><br />If you have a bong already you can get a male/male joint, nail and dome for pretty cheap, under $40 at your local head shop.&nbsp; This setup will make any oil you have last 2-3x longer than just dropping it on a joint and the high will be 2-3x more intense.
