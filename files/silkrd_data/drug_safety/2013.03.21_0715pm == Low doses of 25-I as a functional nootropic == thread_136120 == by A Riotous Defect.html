				I&#039;ve been using 25i for the past week or so every day in low doses ( 250 mics a day ) as research into its effects, to see if it shows nootropic effects in low doses as many other psychedelics do. So far I&#039;ve found that using 25i has led to me being much more productive with these sub-psychedelic doses, as well as much more apt to not give up on long and tedious tasks like cleaning or playing music or drawing; I also appear to have more an understanding of mathematics which has always been a subject I have struggled in. The only detriment I find to this regiment is the negative bodyload associated with the drug, however after some experimentation I found that administering an opiate along with the 25i leads to an extremely functional state with almost none of the bodyload.<br /><br />What usually works best for me is 50 - 100 mg of orally administerred morphine along with a half-tab of 25i, as my tolerance to the 25i has increased as time has gone on.<br /><br />Has anyone else attempted to find a nootropic dose of 25i? What have your experiences been like if you have?

				wow, I&#039;ve never considered such an attempt due to the relatively long and steep tolerance properties of 25i (1-2 weeks between trips, sensitivity for bad trips)<br /><br />Sounds interesting though, and definitely something I&#039;d be willing to at least experiment with.

But that being said, I&#039;ve never really had a &#039;bad&#039; trip so to speak, just frightening ones, but the frightening aspect of psychedelics is largely what draws me to them. Not many things in my drab day-to-day life really have the potential to scare me, but the innards of my own mind do so quite often so I gravitate towards them in a way. <br /><br />There is a huge tolerance buildup, though, I&#039;ve found... I started out taking a quarter tab about a week ago, and now half a tab barely has any effects on me at all. The nootropic effects are still there, though, at least at a small level. I think I&#039;ll continue for another week or two and see how that goes. So far I haven&#039;t noticed any side-effects, but if I start feeling strange I&#039;ll probably cut this little &#039;experiment&#039; out.
