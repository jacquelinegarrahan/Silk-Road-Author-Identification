				ello! Wanted to try heroin for a while to experience the high, done quite a bit of research and I&#039;ve ordered 0.1g of #3 Heroin, I&#039;ve never used heroin before but have used cocaine, mdma, lsd amongst others. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be smoking it using the typical foil + tube, and I&#039;ve read quite a few guides on how best to do that properly.<br /><br />What I&#039;d like to know is firstly how much I should dose. From what I gather the heroin I will be getting is average UK street gear - I have quite a small build and expect to have a fairly low tolerance. I wanna experience the full high but obviously passing out unconscious isn&#039;t what I&#039;m looking for. I&#039;ve read a million times you shouldn&#039;t try heroin as a first time user alone for obvious reasons - unfortunately i don&#039;t know any users or anyone I would feel comfortable with so I will be on my own - so not smoking so much that I pass out is summin I wanna get right.<br /><br />Secondly, I am a big pothead and wanna know if it&#039;s ok to blaze whilst I&#039;m high on heroin - or if I&#039;ll even want to - and if there are any adverse effects.<br /><br />Thirdly, I wanna know how to create the best atmosphere to chase the dragon in - for example music? lighting? visual stimulation? etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for constructive advice on how to make the most of this experience safely and enjoyably - don&#039;t just reply with the aim of persuading me not to go ahead.<br /><br />Thanks!

				advice on heroin? DONT DO IT.<br /><br />IF are going to chase dragon, make sure youre sitting down and have a comfortable pillow on either side of the sofa your sitting on because normally it takes about 20 seconds after inhaling before you pass out and wake up 20 mins later wondering what happened.<br />Why dont you just smoke some weed dude, more worth and less damage.&nbsp; Activate your brain dont damage it!<br /><br />&lt;3 and wishes

				if u smoking it yes ,no point putting little bits on it runs better and lasts longer,<br />put the whole lot on and just run a few lines say 3 ish and have a joint then i doubt it will of done out and just do a few more ,.1 isnt much when smoking uk street stuff ,<br /><br />if u never run it before maybe do it in 2 halves incase u burn it all up and waste it <br /><br />people always say use a tiny flame but i prefer big flame&nbsp; u just carnt let it burn ,so move it about <br />pour h on foil ,heat from above so it melts the top of powder ,then from bottom so all melted so when u tilt u dont tip on floor .if u use say 3/4&nbsp; inch flame put it underneath and heat up the back of the beatle and tilt and the beatle will run down the foil and u inhale fumes ,if u burn it u will no it will leave burnt black bits on foil,if u carnt get it moving u can use biger flame or put nearer foil but move it about so not in one spot so dosnt burn<br />always use rolled up foil as tooter so u can smoke residue of when finished <br />,

				Yeah Jam, Lefthand knows his stuff.<br /><br />You wont pass out after 20secs - total bollocks. Don&#039;t worry about overdose if smoking, its practically impossible. Do be very careful with repeated use though - LH put it great - NOT on a Wednesday lol. If you&#039;re used to stims and trips you will probably find it a pretty underwhelming experience tbh. Especially UK street gear. Take it easy bro<br />

				A lot of people when they first take gear are like &quot;meh....don&#039;t know what all the fuss is about&quot; and find it fairly boring.....but yet end up ordering some more. The effects aren&#039;t always spectacular, just extremely comfortable.<br />I imagine you&#039;ll get pretty high. Left hand spinner gives good advice, but I think he&#039;s forgetting what it&#039;s like to have zero tolerance. Even weak UK gear will get an opiate naive user pretty fucked.
