				my friend wants to know what would happen if one were to take one 1mg or 2 mg pill of xanax while on a 150 ug trip. ive never needed xanax but my friend says he wants to have one just in case, i told him if he feels he needs a xanax just in case he shouldnt trip but he replied by saying &quot;if not now then when&quot; so i thought good point. fuck it its only 150 ug. so, does anyone know the answer to my question? any info is appreciated thank you

				If your friend is worrying this much about having a bad trip he is going to have a bad trip. Xanax can end a trip better than any other drug but if you&#039;re in the right set and setting with some nice people what could go wrong?

				His trip will come to a hault.<br />I&#039;ve been there many times where to visuals and oob effects were just too much and had to eat k-pins.<br /><br />Also i&#039;ve been tripping way hard many times wanted to eat some benzos and come down but decided not to, and have ended the &quot;bad trip&quot; on a fantastic note. (the trip got better)<br /><br />Remember nothing is as important as set and setting!
