				Hey-ah!<br /><br />I&#039;m Ali and I&#039;m addicted to the needle.&nbsp; Drug of choice with the prick is Methylone...&nbsp; Go figure lol.<br /><br />Recently I fucked my arm up pretty badly, leading to cellulitis.&nbsp; I am fat, but not waddle fat, just enough to make my veins a little shy.&nbsp; If this were bluelight or some other harm reduction forum, I&#039;d say save the &quot;don&#039;t shoot up&quot; advice, but you guys know better than that ;)<br /><br />Thing is-<br />Fresh Needles (check)<br />Clean water (check)<br />Alcohol swabs (check)<br />Belt for tying off (check, probably should get a tourniquet, though)<br />Filters (checkerooni)<br /><br />Now I need some advice on finding them.&nbsp; The one on my wrist that is supposed to be an easy hit is reclusive.&nbsp; Never gotten it once.&nbsp; I tried hot water and lifting, but maybe it&#039;s just technique that screws me up (the guy who taught me had a little bit of a problem finding a vein to hit, but always found one without any misses)<br /><br />Thanks, guys.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure the technique is the biggest blockade, so I just need some pro-help at this point.<br /><br />~Ali

				&nbsp;25g, 1in is a hell of a size esp for arm IV mate no wonder you got an infection . I would try and keep with detachable as if you do miss at least all you have to do is change the needle. Larger gauge needles are designed for other places&nbsp; on the body and not for arms look at as you say a 29G needle but if I am correct I think this is a fixed head rather than detachable. <br /><br />Have a look at http://www.exchangesupplies.org/shoplist_needles_and_syringes.php they do ship and are excellent to deal with&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep in touch if you need any more info

				Thanks!&nbsp; Do you know if they have any international restrictions for shipping?&nbsp; The road is dry of anything smaller than 25 and detachable, so I thought I wouldn&#039;t really get that opportunity.<br /><br />Also, any tips for finding a vein with a smaller gauge?

				you want a 29-31 gauge long needle. i find 31 gauge to leave less track marks. try swinging your arms in a circle and pumping your fists to get ur veins out. do some pull/push ups. def need to be in a warm place. cold makes it impossible and youll miss everytime. i like to use my shirt sleeve as a make shift tie to kinda wrap around my arm. always point needle to your heart, never away. remember to rotate spots and try to start at the far end of the vein and work ur way closer to ur heart so ur not irritating ur past injection sites. when i first started iving i needed a friend to do it for me forever.. once u get the hang of it its easy. i had to do it myself once in the hospital cause a nurse couldnt find a vein on me.. the spot inside ur elbo is usually the easiest. otherwise wrists are super easy.. i first used veins about 3 inches up from my elbow. avoid feet if u can.

				im addicted to the ritual just as much as i am the dope.. although i dont use every day anymore its probably only a matter of time as thats been the pattern the last 7 years lol. i used to shoot up in the bathroom with the shower running to mask what i was doing. run the watter hot, itll help u find a vein easier. then jump in the shower after and come out. only problem with that is if u have a big kit full of paraphernalia u gotta carry in

				Hi guys!<br /><br />I will say try the anal route first with the methylone, but after that I have no more suggestions to you, just be safe.<br />that&#039;s a very interesting topic, are we (we as humanity) hook with the ritual, or is just the dope. I will say, as always, there is not a clear limit. In my personal opinion I loved to smoke and snore my cocaine, but never tried other routes that I know are faster. And they are faster, much faster. I love k, but never got into a k hole for sure because I never shoot it. So, is the ritual (I hate needles) or is the faster rush. the pins and the needles in heroin I guess.<br />hope this does not hurt<br /><br />usalchemy<br /><br />
