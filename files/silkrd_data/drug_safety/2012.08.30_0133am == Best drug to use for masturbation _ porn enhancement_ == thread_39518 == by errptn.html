				I know this seems like a weird topic for some of you, because you all probably have hot girlfriends and don&#039;t watch porn ever... ;P&nbsp; I have a gf, and she lets me one night a week indulge in my pron addiction so I try to make the best of it.<br /><br />I wanted to know what drugs I should try next to really make the porn on the screen &quot;seem more real&quot;, you know, pop out of the screen, look alive, fantastic, more exciting.&nbsp; These are the drugs i&#039;ve tried so far:<br /><br />Regular Tobacco cigs: since I have no tolerance, the tobacco &quot;high&quot; gets me pretty horny, but it&#039;s not enough.<br />Alcohol: pretty good, nothing special<br />Weed: again, pretty good, a bit better than alcohol, best when I combine the two.&nbsp; The weed I have is fairly weak and I believe i&#039;m building a tolerance so this isn&#039;t so good anymore.<br />Methylone/M1: makes me feel good but can&#039;t keep it up<br />MDMA: same exactly as Methylone, and doesn&#039;t last long<br />GHB: makes me feel intoxicated, porn looks pretty good but not for long, this one for me lasts the shortest duration<br />MDPV: has no effect on me whatsoever at 10mg, and i&#039;m afraid to dose higher.<br />Meth: Lasts all night, and most of the next day, porn keeps my interest for many hours, however same issue as MDMA and Methylone, can&#039;t keep it up, but it&#039;s my favorite so far, but I can&#039;t ignore that this is also the most dangerous one.<br /><br />Anything else I&#039;m missing?&nbsp; Or possibly any recommended combos? Please keep the why you doing this comments to yourself if possible.&nbsp; We all have our vice&#039;s :)<br />

				2C-B! <br />&quot;Some users report aphrodisiac effects at lower doses (5â€“10 mg).&quot;<br /><br />I recommend using more like 20-25mg then go at it! It gave me one of the most intense orgasms ever I&#039;m dead serious lol&nbsp; you will thank me later trust me!<br /><br />p.s. Im sure other member&#039;s will agree if they have tried it ;).

				Adderall or Ritalin. Feels nice and speedy, and definitely increases libido. Combined with weed, it can make anything that you&#039;re watching (like porn) more captivating. If the dose is too high though, you&#039;re going to get the same vasoconstriction as with MDMA/Methylone/Meth.

				For 2C-B this is who I would recommend you buy from since you&#039;ve never tried it before and probably want a small amount.<br /><br />1) 5x Premium 2C-B Tablet&#039;s (This vendor is very reliable and his quality is always good even though he&#039;s new to selling these trust me they will be good I promise. Plus if you do not have a scale these will be super helpful.)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/81b2a2d99b<br /><br /><br />2) 2C-B 100mg 99% Pure (He&#039;s a new vendor but the review&#039;s look great I would highly suggest you try this vendor if you have a milligram scale.)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/49610d0756<br /><br /><br />3) 2C-B 25mg Capsule (Vendor is well known and if your looking for just 1 dose this is the guy to get it from, the review&#039;s on the quality look&#039;s good and so does the shipping time)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/35aba5fa52<br /><br /><br />I hope this help&#039;s you out buddy if you have any questions just ask ;).

				While waiting for my ride, I was tripping and thought, &quot;Hey, what does porn look like while tripping?&quot;&nbsp; So on 4g of shrooms I watched porn.&nbsp; It had depth, as if I was watching through an actual window.&nbsp; Fun times.

				Acid can be fun, but seems to delay orgasm a fair bit for me and only good at fairly mild doses because otherwise its simply too hard to concentrate! I also found the visuals from shutting my eyes while going solo were more arousing than watching actual porn so if that part is important to you, then it may not be for you.<br /><br />MDMA was a funny one for me, amazing for one go but same limp problem after first orgasm (btw, smoke weed while tripping to help get it up, see below). And interestingly while I normally don&#039;t really go for masturbation or lesbian porn, I found I couldn&#039;t watch any with a dude while on mdma, but girl or girl/girl was great.<br /><br />I also suggest getting a good quality sativa dom weed. My two favourites are kandy kush and white widow. Absolutely amazing when you get high enough, make sure its high quality and sativa dom either way.

				Cocaine - just have everything ready... do a line... then fap away immediately. If you can coincide it with your peak from the coke the orgasm is... well... orgasmic! :D<br /><br />Problem is you might only have one go at it. Unless you cut the coke with some speed.

				I&#039;ve had the thought, &quot;What is wanking like while tripping?&quot; before. Tried it with LSD and I have to say it wasn&#039;t bad. Climax was more intense than usual and the visuals picked up at that point (it was like jizzing rainbows, seriously...)<br /><br />Weed is good as well, but that (for me) is less a &quot;I want to get high and wank off&quot; thought process, and more a &quot;I want to get high, and now that I&#039;m high I think I&#039;ll have a wank.&quot; Not something I plan out or anything is what I&#039;m saying :P

				Good:<br /><br />MDMA - Limpdick throughout and only possible to ejaculate if you masturbate faster than the speed of light. Best to do this with a sexual partner though in my opinion, you will appreciate it much more.<br /><br />2CB - Like others have said, take a low dose. I think this is the safest option (almost guaranteed to be able to getitup and have a good time) after weed. Sounds like what you need going by your posts, will definitely make your pornography seem more lively and vivid.<br /><br />DPH - Came so hard I thought my heart was going to fail. Everything faded to black. I thought that was the end for me, I think I only survived because I quickly realized how horribly embarrassing it would be for me if I was found dead/taken to hospital in that compromising state.<br />Was too tired to clean up after so I fell asleep drenched in my own seminal fluid. Good times in the end, probably the most intense experience. <br />It was only much later I found out DPH is a great orgasm potentiator, so absolutely no placebo involved. It really works. I wonder if it&#039;s the same for ladies?<br /><br />Weed - Can&#039;t go wrong, one of the best.<br /><br />Shrooms - Feels good man, but hard to climax.<br /><br /><br />Not so good:<br /><br />Opiates - Can last forever but can&#039;t feel anything. No point really, much rather nod.<br /><br />&quot;Speed&quot; - Limpdick all the way. Absolutely no way of getting around it without ED meds. Stay away.<br /><br />Benzos - I can&#039;t remember?<br /><br />Alcohol - Meh.<br /><br />Ketamine - Get the fuck outta here.

				The best orgasm I have ever had was after a 100mg line of Coke and 100mg of Mephedrone at the same time.<br /><br />The best technique for this one is to start with the wanking sober, and just before you feel you&#039;re about to climax, STOP and do the lines at the same time (prepare for the most intense rush you will ever experience) carry on playing for 10minutes keeping your boner whilst the meph and coke hit you, then let yourself climax.<br />My whole body was shaking so bad i almost fell of my bed. It was fucking incredible. <br />Then after you&#039;ve orgasmed, it still feels like its carrying on because of how intense the rush is from this combo. :) <br /><br />Ive also heard that foxy is the best drug for sex, I&#039;m yet to try it though!

				Adderall and Weed son. I&#039;m prescribed Vyvanse, but same difference. I am kinda confused at why you would watch porn and masturbate by yourself if you have a GF. Maybe watch some together to get horny, I can see that, but yeah, the answer is pop some amphetamine, smoke some weed, and then play with your lady for an hour or two.

				The tactile feeling from YAYO is great and the orgasm unbelieveable if you can keep it up. MDA is good too better then MDMA but again you got to keep it up. Methylone had my heart racing to much so that paranoia made me soft.

				Alcohol: Makes me horny as fuck but I can&#039;t finish when I&#039;ve been drinking.<br /><br />Nootropics: I always get really horny after taking a lot of noopept, but that could just be because its mornings. Orgasms feel better, but I&#039;m not 100% sure of the difference<br /><br />Shrooms: I really liked looking at lesbian sequences and artistic shots of naked women, but I had a very low tolerance for guys. Couldn&#039;t get it up but had a really nice mindgasm I guess.<br /><br />DOB: parts of the trip are fucking great for this. Especially when you are upped and have visual enhancement. Came super hard, but at the same time there&#039;s the whole 14 hour trip part of it...<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try 25c-nbome next I think that one might be pretty good.

Especially if you are in a serious relationship and you are a.) having a fight or b.) she is on her P.<br /><br />I just had back to back shoulder surgeries so I have been physically unable to bang, but I do remember how it is, porn has its place even when its not the only option. Weed is where its at, maybe a lil amphetamine to get you in the mood but not necessary at all. Like ^he said anything else, while perhaps making you&nbsp; feel good in general, will detract from orgasmic experience. Weed might make a guy cum too soon, but fuck it take a short break and get back after it. THC is a great drug.

				ok holy fuck. <br />I just tried it with 25c-Nbome<br />hardest orgasm I&#039;ve had in a year (even more so then after a week of abstaining) - it felt like I was shooting lighting bolts - and I still felt like I was orgasming 2 minutes later.&nbsp; ;D I&#039;m sitting in the afterglow right now and it feels great. <br />(note: I took it ~5 1/2 hours ago so I&#039;m at the tail end now, I kinda doubt I would have wanted to at the start of the dose)<br />It took a significant amount of work to get to the point of release though.<br />also dicks were a big nono Solos and lesbians only with this.

				I always found MDMA to be amazing for sex both alone and with a partner.&nbsp; Takes longer to get up and longer to finish( but not so long it becomes annoying; I find other stimulants kind of make you horny but it&#039;s a soulless experience and gives you a sore dick). The tactile and empathetic side of ecstasy make it amazing. I fucked a girl once when full of ecstasy. I later found she had told all her freinds I was the best shag shed ever had. I didn&#039;t really reap the dividends from that you&#039;d expect as she also told them I was a dickhead and a junkie. Its not like I took her purse in the morning; talk about ungrateful. (A little tip: if a girl asks why you have tinfoil down the side of your bed, try and think of a better excuse than &quot; er... Dunno, wrapping stuff up and shit&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My current partner (and mother of my two kids) assures me I have nothing to boast about in that department, so it was definitely the MDMA.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Opiates help prolong performance but tbh whether alone or with a freind being unable to come is very annoying. I have had to fake it in the past. The girl&nbsp; probably could tell but what&#039;s she going to say: &quot; no you didn&#039;t&quot;?

				So from this thread we can deduce that orgasms feel good. And that drugs feel good. And that orgasms on drugs feel even better. From all the suggestions it seems like just about any drug will do if you do it right. :D

				After a good smoke of some wicked crystal meth, I have the most intense orgasms, even to the point where I literally will come twice in the one orgasm.&nbsp; :) 8) :)&nbsp; &nbsp;For me there is nothing like it. Coke and MDMA are also good, but a more euphoric mellow orgasm than the crystal.&nbsp; :)

				Ive done coke and viagra (100mg) at the same time viagra does nothing for me except make my face flush with blood and make me look sunburnt its also hell uncomfortable. This is all <br />I got from it with coke as well. Maybe its cheap viagra? I have never had ED problems though.<br /><br />I would have to say i have busted a sneaky masty every now and then on substance including&nbsp; - weed, meth , lsd , mdma. I would have to say that weed would be my favorite, but I dont like smoking it as it tears apart my throat.
