				Hi there, this is my first post, i hope to find the answers to my questions here, and to be helpful in any way if i can. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m &quot;new&quot; to the world of drugs, because i never tried nothing, but i&#039;m quite informed and interested about psychedelic drugs, because i study sciences at uni (chemistry, mathematics, etc..), and I&#039;m passionate about experiences of &quot;other worlds&quot;, altered perceptions, the matrix, and spiritualism in the &quot;scientific&quot; meaning of the world.. I mean, i don&#039;t believe in spirits, but i believe that our mind is MORE powerful than everyone think, and that all the spiritual travels from shamans could be a kind of mind-travel to another real world, or to a place of our world that it&#039;s inaccessible because of our 5 senses that limit our perception of the world around us. In fact, we only judge &quot;real&quot; the things that we feel with our 5 senses, but what if we had another sense in the past, that allowed us to &quot;see&quot; or &quot;detect&quot; other aspects of our reality? It&#039;s like a person that can&#039;t smell nothing from the day he is born, or someone blind. They just don&#039;t know, and live their lives without big issues.. Maybe we are all living in the same way.... maybe some &quot;drugs&quot; are the key for another sense, maybe the 6th sense... who knows... <br /><br />Anyway, i woke up today with a couple of questions so here i am.. :)<br /><br />1) What if, in the middle of a breakthrough of DMT or LSD, when i could see other people distorted or liquified, i watch myself into a mirror? Someone of you ever tried to watch into a mirror under any psychedelic drug?<br />I think that it could turn in a bad trip quite rapidly... Or maybe we could see us as someone else, or the &quot;real&quot; ourself... i&#039;m just curious.. :)<br /><br />2) What if a blind person from the day of his born takes DMT? If he&#039;ll see these &quot;aliens&quot; or spirits or figures that almost everyone seems to see during a strong breakthrough, couldn&#039;t it be a PROOF of the existence of these<br />beings???<br /><br />:)

				I don&#039;t know about other people&#039;s experiences with looking in mirrors, but when I take powerful psychedelics I often see things that my brain normally filters out, blemishes, or lip twitches, or blinking, etc. its not especially pleasant but its not a bad experience either. Although I guess its possible for you to see that... if you really want to and convince your mind its what it should expect. I kinda doubt looking in a mirror will give you a bad trip, I think you need to have a lot of other stuff going on in the trip before something like that would make it negative.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think that proves anything Eşref Armağan was born without eyes and is now a painter, some of his work can be found here: http://www.armagan.com/paintings.asp you have to realize that there is more to the dimension of sight then seeing, as for these beings existing I&#039;m not so sure of that, I have very high natural DMT levels, so much so to the point where I sometimes will &quot;trip&quot; while awake and communicate with my subconscious or some higher being I suppose. Its actually saved my life twice, when the voices and images come and tell me actions to take. Although I also get extremely potent lucid dreams with similar experiences (I can literally tutor myself by dreaming)

				1. Well, I looked into a mirror at 350 micrograms of lsd and all I saw was my face morphing :P What I read between the lines of your question is the fear of a bad trip. Tripping on LSD usually is a quite exhausting experience. Get enough sleep before you drop, I prefer dropping in the morning so I can sleep 12 hours later... My first trip was after a hard day of work at 9pm, and boy, did I want it to stop and let me sleep... Get a friend to watch you. There is no time you need a hug that badly then when you dropped LSD. Trust me. Otherwise you will find yourself roaming the streets for some stranger to hug...<br />Too main routes a LSD experience can take, and I experienced them myself, are getting reborn and/or dying. Getting reborn lets you experience the whole process from fertilization to birth. The fetus swimming in a warm, friendly environment. Cosy. Birth is nasty. It is a fight between life and death, usually combined with very strong, sometimes horrible feelings. Imagine a little baby, safe for 9 months, suddenly being squeezed through a narrow channel... And that is where your sitter comes in handy. Newborn babies definitly need some attention from their mother or other people. It really sucks being alone at this point. Trust me. See the points above...<br />Dying was really interesting. What happens is that your ego dissolves, and that is practically the same thing as dying. Go with the flow and die, accept your death and everything will be fine. Again, dying with a sitter nearby to hold your hand makes the thing a lot more enjoyable.<br /><br />2. no idea about that :P<br /><br />good luck on your travels<br /><br />P.S.: I definitly recommend you reading something about your inner child before tripping. Google it, most of our mental and every day problems root in troubles in our childhood. LSD is a powerful tool to explore these wounds and help to cure them.

You&#039;ll find yourself ugly, but just don&#039;t let this feeling into your heart, find something to do. Also it&#039;s not nice to look at your beloved one (girlfriend). But I personally like to be with my girlfriend during the trip, otherwise I miss her too much.

				About the LSD question, that doesn&#039;t make much sense<br /><br />i looked once or twice to a mirror, and my face transformed into a donkey, i got the ears and the teeth like a donkey. Didn&#039;t bothered me, i laughed so hard lol.<br /><br />It&#039;s only a matter of not letting yourself fall into a spiral of negativity. As someone told, if you can&#039;t stand much your uglyness (some people have issues with the fact of not being nice looking, me myself i&#039;m completely fine with my appearance, even though i&#039;m not good looking :P ) avoid that, if you have some kind of phobia just avoid triggering it. Common sense.<br /><br />Nope, you will not get the sensation of &quot;hey, is another person in the mirror&quot; with a low dosage (one tab = 150ug). Your ego will remain intact.<br /><br />Choose one day to try acid when you&#039;re in a very good mood, without anything bothering your mind. <br />

				looking in the mirror?<br />Thats some myth I never understood. Looked often in the mirror while tripping L (otherwise you cant see yourself, what makes i.e washing/shaving a bit hard ,-)) never saw demons or lost my control. <br />I know what you mean though but the only interesting thing through a mirror are the eyes of yourself. And believe me it is much much much much .. much more interesting to look in someone other than your, eyes. Oh I love eyes!<br /><br />Happy testing!
