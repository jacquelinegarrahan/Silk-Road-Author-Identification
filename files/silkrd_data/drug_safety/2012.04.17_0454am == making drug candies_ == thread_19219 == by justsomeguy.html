			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;d like to make 2c-b candies (probably using smarties or something similarly absorbent, like I&#039;ve read about around here) for long-term storage and security of my personal stash.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning to just make a vodka solution of 100mg/mL, then use a metric dropper (20 drops/mL) to put one drop on each candy.&nbsp; My main concern is that the liquid either won&#039;t absorb properly, leaving a layer of 2c-b on the outside that is easily rubbed off, or absorbs really well but turns the candy to mush.<br /><br />I&#039;d also be like to do the same with higher-dosage chemicals like MDMA, but I can&#039;t imagine how to get enough on each candy to be worth it.&nbsp; Maybe if I could get the solution up to around 10mg/drop, I could do multiple drops (allowing it to dry in between each), to get up to around 30mg/candy.&nbsp; Then I could just eat a few to adjust my dosage.<br /><br />Can someone with experience provide some enlightenment?&nbsp; Thanks!

				2C-B will dissolve at 100mg/mL with 70% ipa/water, so you could make 10mg candies using love hearts (US smarties or similar) without worrying about the candy dissolving.<br /><br />If you want to go bigger, then one of these would probably be of use to you&nbsp; :D<br /><br />http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/519006574/DY_DPJ_1_5_machine_for.html

				Thanks, wowzers, that&#039;s some good info.&nbsp; I guess IPA would be a better choice, since it&#039;s so cheap.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at those pill presses, and I would LOVE one.&nbsp; I wish they were affordable, or there was some sort of low-tech thing I could build, since I&#039;m only doing this for personal use.<br /><br />I PM&#039;d foxymeow, who I know sometimes sells 2c-b smarties and asked him his thoughts.&nbsp; He responded with the following:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=6611">Quote from: foxymeow on April 17, 2012, 03:12 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It doesn&#039;t work with higher dose stuff. Also most other RCs and especially real drugs are not soluble enough to make smarties with. <br /><br />I suggest grain alcohol. It wouldn&#039;t turn the candy mush and there will probably be a thin layer of 2c-b on top of the smarty but it will be absorbed into the smarty. You really don&#039;t need to use that much especially if you are using grain alchohol. Just microwave it for 7 second to help it dissolve quickly. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not sure why it wouldn&#039;t work for larger dose stuff, as long as you wait for each drop to dry before applying the next one.&nbsp; Maybe there&#039;s simply not enough room in the candy for much more than 10mg of anything?&nbsp; Ideas are welcome!<br /><br />As far as grain alcohol goes, I could have sworn I read around here that using a high-proof alcohol was unwise, since some can evaporate before you finish dosing out the candies, which would clearly fuck up the doses.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably just use IPA as wowzers suggested, unless someone can think of a reason not to do that.
