				I posted this in the newb forum, but I&#039;ll post it here because it&#039;s more apropos.<br /><br />NIK KITS:<br />(clearnet link!):<br /><br />http://tritechforensics.com/store/product/nikr-test-poucheskit-refill-pouches/]<br /><br />They have some for LSD/Pot/PCP/Meth/E/Benzos/Ketamine, pretty much all you can think of.<br /><br />These kits are great and possible the strongest way to tell what you are getting with your organic compounds.&nbsp; I would never trust anyone to give me pure anything on a black market, purely because it&#039;s too easy to have substitutes that are cheaper or more readily available.&nbsp; Now there are great people selling and manufacturing these compounds, but to ensure your safety, employing one of these $16 dollar kits can save you a lot of heartache, even literally.<br /><br /><br />Note: I don&#039;t recommend buying these from the site above as they are probably tied in with LE; it is purely for listing and reading at your convenience.<br /><br /><br />Some tips:<br />-- Use kits to test a random pill or so, depending on your level of suspicion. <br />-- Use in conjunction with other tests to test for other known adulterants.&nbsp; I am not too drug savvy as I pretty much stick to gang, but ensuring that your meth has no PCP additive in it for example, may be worthwhile<br />--Try to keep these kits away from the place of purchase.&nbsp; Having these basically says, &quot;I was WAITING for this shipment&quot;.<br />--These are basically aqueous acids.&nbsp; It is possible to store them in an innocuous looking container, but it must withstand the pH (do research)<br />--These will most likely NOT tell you anything aside from drug category, so if you are getting a benzo, you will not know which one it is<br />--Don&#039;t order these if you are a big time vendor/seller. They are too much of a red flag. Have a friend or even a trusted buyer get them for some reduced price goods and/or peace of mind.<br />--These aren&#039;t 100%.&nbsp; Even in LE, they must send the goods off for GCMS (big time/almost no error) testing.&nbsp; Since you can&#039;t get a hold of those, this is prob the best alternative.<br /><br />Stay safe<br />
