				I would normally use the search bar before posting this, but can anyone give me an idea if 4-aco useage today will effect tolerance to LSD on Friday? I have a VERY important trip to experience on Friday, but a limited supply of sweet Lucy, and if there is cross tolerance, I hope I can adjust to make it as awesome as it deserves to me. The date is set in stone, and I can not not be a part of it.

				you mean today and tomorrow? <br /><br />psychedelics are going to have cross-tolerance issues because they all are affecting the 5HT-2A receptor which produces the characteristic trippy effect...&nbsp; in the most simple terms. also 1A and 2C, plus with lsd its much more complex with some activity at a few other serotonergic receptors as well as effects on dopaminergic, and adrenergic signaling - which is only effected by 4-aco in very high doses if its like psilocin<br /><br />it takes a decent break, im not sure exactly but more than a few days to reduce the tolerance. if you want the lsd trip to be the best it can, then id definitely say not to trip right before on 4-aco...

				I think you&#039;re gonna have to increase the dose buddy.&nbsp; How many tabs were you planning on taking?&nbsp; I would say double it to be safe.&nbsp; The best way to do that, IMO, would be to take half the entire dose...and then as soon as you really start coming up (but no more than 1 1/2 hours after dosing) take the rest.<br /><br />Graduating doses is a great way to trip.&nbsp; I used to start with a half tab, then take a full tab about 30 mins in, then take two 30 later...and depending on where I was trying to get, another 2.....or even 4 if the time is right, but that is a seriously heavy trip.<br /><br />Do you mind if I inquire as to what your unmissable experience is?&nbsp; Don&#039;t need to give details but, camping trip, festival, spiritual journey with a loved one?

				a goodbye party for a friend. I knew it was coming, so I should have planned for it and NOT went balls out on 4-aco for the 4th, but what are you gonna do? I&#039;ll figure it out.

				all of the good. none of the bad (some stomach discomforting at the max of time warp( shorter but faster hits fast and drifts down/ other waythen shroomsing does. can be weekday light trip or haliday wekend balls out. four eyed monsters on the TV means it is good. before i am liking just like i like lucy if fact, not the deepth but the colors and hearing distortion. I&nbsp; very much love to watch the trains on 4-aco better than trains on LSD. the trains seem to be a brute force on acid, but on aco, they are singing a song as they float along. I was late on my dose of the party. coming on hard now, and the emotion is overcoming me again. for a moment if you please forget what you believe and maybe you will see that we are all the same.

				So, how do you dose 4-aco...do you snort it or take it orally?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only recently learned about 4-aco and I&#039;m super interested.&nbsp; I see someone selling 4-aco pills on the shroom listing, I want to try.<br /><br />How much LSD are you going to take for the party?

				They are both of the Tryptamine class so it is possible that there would be a cross tolerance but I doubt if there was it would be of any significance.

				it definitely did affect my tolerance, so the stops were pulled out last night. I ended up taking my last 2 tabs of alex grey print &#039;cid, followed about 30 min later with 20mg of 4-aco-det. the 4-aco was just getting in gear when I started posting last night. about an hour in I iced the cake with a medium sized rail of methylone (that didn&#039;t really bring me too much higher) It was a wonderful party, and I felt the connections I was needing. it is hard to say goodbye, and the sadness is still here this morning. Time to take an intermission from psychedelics for a bit.
