				I just put an order for some K, I know the dosage I should take for my bodyweight, but I am not sure whether I should take racemic or S-isomer.<br /><br />I am interested in using the ketamine to treat depression. I have looked for medical articles online,&nbsp; but that exact bit of info seems to be behind pay walls. Anyone know?

				I don&#039;t have a whole lot of substance to add but I will say that Karl Jansen&#039;s book Ketamine:Dreams and Reality has some good info on the differences between the different isomers and racemic.

				The literature I&#039;ve seen says that the antidepressant effects come from the S-isomer, which is also less harsh on your body and passed more easily.<br /><br />Don&#039;t self-medicate though. I&#039;d say experiment with it and see how well it works, but also make sure you&#039;re seeing a doctor if you feel depressed. NMDA antagonists really do work, but almost everyone needs a professional helping them.

				I was using ketamine injections at least three times weekly with the intentions of warding off depression and stabilizing the mood.&nbsp; It worked for me, and i&#039;m still experiencing the afterglow from my last injection a week ago.&nbsp; I do significantly feel that my emotions are more stable than usual as my mind is usually a mess.&nbsp; Disassociate from the ego ;)
