				Pros, <br /><br />Was gifted 8 5MG hydrocodones which is fine and dandy, but how I can extract the hydrocodone? I know there is a cold water method but I&#039;ve never used before. Typically takes 3-4 norco&#039;s to get me straight so these 8 will do but I don&#039;t all the fucking APAP in them. <br /><br />Can any of you cat&#039;s help a man out please. <br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Easy, peasy.<br /><br />Hydro is soluble in cold water.&nbsp; APAP is almost insoluble.<br /><br />Crush the pills.&nbsp; Add enough cold water (think ice water, just above freezing) to wet the pill mass, make a sort of runny slurry.&nbsp; Filter off the pill mass, keep the filtered water.&nbsp; The amount of water doesn&#039;t&nbsp; matter, but it should be enough to make a runny slurry.&nbsp; You&#039;re going to drink the water, so you might not want to use pints, get it?<br /><br />Drink and enjoy.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; This is an extremely simple process.&nbsp; Don&#039;t muck it up by making it more complicated than it needs to be...&nbsp; You need not have good &quot;lab technique&quot; to make it work, so don&#039;t even worry about following some of the more elaborate write-ups out there.&nbsp; The idea is to isolate MOST of the hyrdo from MOST of the APAP, not 100%.&nbsp; The difference in solubility in cold water between the two compounds is enough to achieve your goal.

				lol. well fuck me running. so basically it&#039;s as easy as me crusing all 8 of them, dropping them in a glass of cold water, running them through say a coffee filter or so, drinking the water then feeling the RUSHHHHHHHH come on? <br /><br />I&#039;m such a fucking novice.

				Man many thanks man!!!! Hey, do I need to put a bunch of water in the glass or just a little bit.

				Depends on how much liquid you want to drink...<br /><br />Solubility is something like 60mg/ml @ about 25 degrees C. (going from memory here, don&#039;t quote me) which mean that all 40mgs of your hydrocodone bitartrate will dissolve quite easily into only 1 tiny ml of water, but keep in mind that you need enough water to be able to filter the pill mass.&nbsp; Use enough water to accomplish this, but not so much you&#039;ll have trouble drinking it.&nbsp; Half a cup is more than enough water.
