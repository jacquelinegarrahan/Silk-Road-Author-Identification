				IUPAC: 2-(methylamino)-1-(4-methylphenyl)butan-1-one<br />Other names include: 4-methylbuphedrone, mebuphedrone, BZ-6378, and NEB<br /><br />I recently got a little over a gram of this stuff and it seems that their is an absolute dirth of information about it.<br />Almost everything that I can find seems to be speculative. And of that speculation, Opinions seem to be split.<br />Some say that it will be like a stronger/better version of meph. Others believe that it is simply more cardio-toxic.<br />(I think one speculator even dubbed it &quot;Bullshitidrone&quot;<br /><br />Some of the speculative doses were guessed to be around 30-50mg but the vendor said that they found 350mg to be a good dose.<br /><br />I have titrated up to about 75mg and it just feels like plain CNS stimulation so far. Kind of like I chugged a large expresso.<br /><br />So does anyone else have any knowledge or experience with this chem? I have seen it pop up on a few bulk RC lists here but I don&#039;t think anyone has really brought it up before.

				Ok. after having done some more experimenting with this chemical I have come to some conclusions<br /><br />1) the immediate effects are incredibly short lived. we&#039;re talking 2 hours tops<br />2) it seems to provide more body effects than mental effects and I don&#039;t think it crosses the BBB very well. although there could be some mild dopamine activity going on. just enough to make it moreish<br />3) the predominant effects feel like nor-epinephrine based stimulation<br />4) I kind of feel like this the ephedrine of cathinones. (I.E. 4-MeMABP is to Mephedrone what Ephedrine is to Meth)<br />&nbsp;<br />So I am wondering if it would be possible to perform an oxidation or a reduction (or some other trivial chemical reaction) on this chemical to yield something more useful.<br /><br />Any Thoughts?

I want to say &quot;brephedrone&quot; but don&#039;t quote me on that.&nbsp; The conventional wisdom seemed to be that it was a weaker version of a weaker version of mephedrone and not worth the effort.
