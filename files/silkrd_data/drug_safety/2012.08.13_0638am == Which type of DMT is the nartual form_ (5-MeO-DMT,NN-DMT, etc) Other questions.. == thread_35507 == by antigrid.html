				I am planning on trying DMT for the first time this week and can&#039;t figure out which type I should purchase. I am not sure of the difference between NN-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, or the freebase. I didn&#039;t realize there even were different types until I went to purchase. So for those in the know, which is the &quot;natural&quot; form of DMT? I am not doing it to get &quot;fucked up&quot;, this has been something I have waited a long time to try because I am using it in an attempt to &quot;open doors&quot; of my subconscious. <br /><br />I do not use drugs like this as party drugs, in my opinion they deserve respect and were not meant for that purpose but more expanding ones mind and understanding. Anyways, which of these types is what I am looking for? Like , the type I would get if I was getting a &quot;snuff&quot; out of a tree?<br /><br />What is the difference between the two? (I know I could look it up on Google, I am looking for a short explanation from someone that speaks my language)<br />For those that use substances such as this to expand your consciousness, which type of DMT would you recommend? Any tips for making the most of the experience?

				What you want is NN-DMT freebase. Most dmt sellers on the road sell it in this form.<br />30-50mg and you should be shot into psychedelic hyperspace in a matter of 30 seconds and back on earth in 5-20 minutes.<br /><br />Please be aware that you cant be on any type of prescription medication such as anti depressants as this could make the whole process a lot messier than it should be.<br /><br />5-meo-dmt is on a whole other level and i would recommend nn-dmt before 5-meo, as in my experience 5-meo is much harsher especially if you have never tried any form of dmt at all. <br /><br />I hope this helps

				Both 5-MeO-DMT and N,N-DMT occur in nature actually. 5-MeO-DMT is most popularly extracted from certain species of toads. N-N,DMT is usually found in plant matter, and Mimosa Hostillis is probably the most common source used for extraction.<br /><br />They have different effects, 5-MeO-DMT is usually regarded as less visual and more near death type of experiences, while N,N-DMT is usually far more visual and is known as the &quot;Spirit Molecule&quot;.<br /><br />http://dmt-nexus.me has a ton of info on DMT, and is a great resource<br />http://erowid.org tons of info on just about every drug out there.

What do you mean &quot;once I am a psychonaut&quot;? I would already consider myself somewhat of one. Not as much using drugs as the way to achieve experience but I have had my share of non drug induced experiences. My latest one being about 2 1/2 years ago, a real out of body / near death experience. Wish I could tell more about it but that would compromise my anonymity. Suffice to say I do not want to not do one of the two simply because you think they might be to intense; nothing will be more intense then a real out of body expreince induced by literally almost dying.<br /><br />What other drugs are out there that are better for understanding life and death? I am not looking to do one or the other because one might be more pleasant. I want to connect to the spirit world or whatever aspect of that realm that I believe this chemical allows access. But I also don&#039;t think Toads were meant to be used for spiritual experiences, however I know that plants were. <br /><br />Also, what is DMT freebase? Is that the same thing a NN-DMT? e.g. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/a93d645fd8

				Mescaline number one, any form really but in my experience real peyote gives you more of a natural feel than synthetic but that stuff is still good. Second I would try changa if you find yourself enjoying the n,n dmt experience.Try some different types of shrooms, not just cubensis. Might I recommend the truffles that were sold on SR at one time and still might be. really different trip than normal shrooms. Then obviously LSD or DOB or DOM all are good but those are more for mind expanding rather than just connecting with nature like mescaline and all that. fuck I know this prolly sounds like jibberish right now but I&#039;m sure it should make some sense.
