				This happened exactly a week ago and I came close to almost getting hit by a train.... anyway even after reading up about the importance of set and setting i honestly didn&#039;t think the situation could have ended up as bad as it did but oh well.. here it goes.<br /><br />I met up with some of my friends at night on an oval for some drinks, i took the 1000ug blotter as soon as i met up with them and within 15 minutes i had a huge smile on my face and i couldn&#039;t get rid of it, it was the best feeling in the world and slowly i started to lose the sense of been normal, within an hour everyone was their, i went to the bathroom and the pattern on the wall was moving around like a bunch of bugs, some of my friends were drunk and yelling and screaming a lot so the police were called, when i was running it felt like i was flying, like the world around me was moving extremely fast; we had to jump through a barb wired fence and when the trip was over i had a few cuts, but i felt almost no pain at the time, anyway we went up to the street to a house were one of my friends lived, i couldn&#039;t recognize him so i said something really bad, evidently he and some other people were gonna bash the sh**it out of me, so i was told to go the nearest train station, by myself and to avoid the main road.<br /><br />This is when the bad trip was setting in.. i was walking down a street where a loud police siren kept repeating itself, i looked at a street sign but it was just a bunch of random letters put together, my thoughts kept repeating themselves; i saw a huge highway appear out of nowhere in the middle of the sky.. a plane flew over my head, it looked huge and sounded like it was right next to me. So this is where the bad trip began, i kept stumbling and all of a sudden a giant rat was running right at me... then it disappeared, an old person walking past looked like a witch and i had no clue where i was or what i was doing.. my thought patterns were in &#039;the loop&#039; and I walked near some shops and i could hear cars and trains but i couldn&#039;t see anything except the sidewalk. <br /><br />I recognized one of my friends which probably stopped me from dying, evidently i was walking on the train tracks and almost got hit by a train( which I have NO memory of what so ever)...its funny what your body subconsciously does when you have a bad trip, i got called a taxi home and when i got home i read up on bad trips, on Wikipedia it said stuff like, people must have a happy life and get laid ( which made me laugh), people should NOT mix psychedelic drugs with alcohol,if they do they are fucking&nbsp; idiots&nbsp; . I felt cold and weak so i turned on the tv to see some effects, people were talking but i couldn&#039;t hear anything.. a couple of seconds later i could hear a subliminal message telling me to buy something or that the world was gonna end, i found it funny but i was tired so i went to sleep with heaps of patterns distracting me. the trip told me a lot about myself, not in what i saw but what i felt after the bad trip. I felt a lot better about life in general<br /><br />TLDR: Almost got bashed, almost died, trip was bad but it pretty much told me a lot about myself, I know i was really stupid to do it in a setting like this one and next time ill make sure I&#039;m in a safe place with a sitter :) <br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for sharing this, alot of people underestimate set and setting, anyone who is fairly inexperienced with pyscs should do there first few trips indoors, when you go outside there is no telling what can happen, as you found out :)
