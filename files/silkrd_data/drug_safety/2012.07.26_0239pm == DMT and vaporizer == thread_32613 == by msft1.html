				Post by: <strong>msft1</strong> on <strong>July 26, 2012, 02:39 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve been attempting to find a GOOD way to smoke freebase DMT and I&#039;ve tried many methods so far:<br /><br />* &quot;Classic&quot; DMT glass pipe (so far my favorite)<br />* DMT sprinkled on weed in a bong or in a water pipe<br />* DMT through a set of steel mesh filters placed in a wooden pipe<br />* The &quot;DMT Machine&quot; (small glass bottle with hole drilled and steel wool inserted) - complete fail<br />* DMT through a vaporizer<br /><br />For my last method I use &quot;Arizer Extreme-Q Vaporizer! Remote Controlled and Quieter&quot; which sells for about $150 on Amazon:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036Z5UJC<br /><br />Now, this method has completely failed me as well. I can&#039;t place DMT in the chamber directly as it would simply melt and drip onto the heating elements below. I tried putting it on some weed but the resulting smoke/vapor was quite weak and I think I&#039;m wasting a lot.<br /><br />Does anyone have any experience with this or similar vaporizer? I&#039;ve seen many people saying how great their DMT experience was with one so I must be doing something wrong.<br /><br />Before anyone says to &quot;go Google it&quot; - I did, read lots of guides and manuals. Sadly what works for the writer(s) may not work in practice for all of us.

				Shell out the money for the Sherlock Vapor Genie. Use 7 or 8 screens with it. It&#039;s totally worth it. <br /><br />That&#039;s what I use, and it works perfectly. Smooth hits, unlike from a classic meth pipe.

				Well, now that I own a different brand of vaporizer, I really don&#039;t feel like getting yet another one.<br /><br />What&#039;s so special about the Genie? How do you use it for DMT?

				I made my own vaporizer with a heat gun, some pipes, and an oven bag. It worked relaly well for DMT especially since I put a valve on the mouthpeice that I attache my bag too.<br /><br />I also use the sandwhich method on a vaporizer (usually with basal or something that isn&#039;t weed)

				I&#039;ve used a Volcano to little success (good trip but no breakthrough).&nbsp; But I attribute this to letting the smoke sit in the bag for too long before taking a hit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since modified the bag with a straw that I can take direct hits from as it is vaporizing. Hopefully this will work.

				My personal favorite method is to dissolve it in IPA, as pure as you can get it, and then soak a smokable herb in that, allow the alcohol to evaporate completely, and zippity-zappity-zop, you&#039;ve got DMT enhanced herb. I smoke mine out of a standard meth pipe, nothing special, just add a few screens, and it works just fine for me.

				So I&#039;ve ordered cheapest Vapor Genie since it&#039;s only about $50 on Amazon.com... Will get back with results once I try it. Thanks everyone for suggestions!<br /><br />As far as making Changa, I will also try it once I have enough DMT to waste some (in case I screw up).<br /><br />Finally, I&#039;ve read on the forums about the IV method (injecting DMT solutions) which seems to actually be the safest in terms of dosing and health effects, but I&#039;m just not ready to trust DMT this much :)) Perhaps some day I will!

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend IV unless you&#039;re very certain about the purity of the DMT solution. I&#039;d also want to be very experienced with DMT and have someone do it for me, because I&#039;d rather not blast off into hyperspace with a needle still in my arm.
