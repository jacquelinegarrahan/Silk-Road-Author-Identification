				the bad thing about SR is that anyone can get their hands on drugs...especially careless idiots who dive right in without any research, knowledge, or guidance....back in the day you had experienced drug users right there by your side to show you the ropes...<br /><br />now all you have is a bunch of words on a computer screen trying to walk you through it...

				You must not be in a city with open drug sells. Sometimes the experienced drug users want you to do whatever drug so you can do it with them. At least people here for the most part made the choice them self. I do understand your point tho.

				OP, I see the point you&#039;re trying to make, but just because a user comes to drugs without being guided by an &#039;experienced&#039; user doesn&#039;t mean shit. A little common sense goes a long way to keeping yourself safe.<br /><br />Not only that, but be careful when you say &quot;now all you have is a bunch of words on a computer screen&quot;, because the best advice I can give people is to read, read and read, especially places like Erowid. Does it come to close to explaining how the peak of a 1mg acid trip will be like? No, not a chance. Is it better than seeking out the stoner down the road for his advice just because he&#039;s been into drugs for a few years? Depends on the stoner, but I&#039;m going to say generally yes.<br /><br />Not ragging on you though, I do see what you mean and agree that a qualified (whatever that means in the situation) guide is probably the best, but the resources here and elsewhere aren&#039;t as bad as you think.

				I see what you are saying OP, but this is a problem in any major city in America...and probably the world.<br /><br />I think the bigger issue is kids who are very computer-literate having access to substances they otherwise would never be able to reach. But there is no way to safely prevent that.

				&gt; the bad thing about SR is that anyone can get their hands on drugs<br /><br />So just like in real life?<br /><br />This type of thinking is exactly why drugs are illegal.<br /><br />The failure of logic is that we can protect people from themselves. <br /><br />If someone wants to escape, they find a way either through drugs, sex, video games, whatever. If theres demand, there will be supply.<br /><br />The solution is not shutting down the channels of escape, its teaching self-control, safety and focusing in on the root of the problems... why they want to escape in the first place?<br /><br />The latter is a much harder problem to solve. Drugs are an easy target... so people prefer to go after it. <br /><br />Drugs are the strawman of the all the post-scarcity worlds problems.

				Every person should have common sense and responsibility regarding his actions and taking drugs. I don&#039;t think careless idiots know how to use BTC and order through SR.

				I have to say that I like the SR method. I won&#039;t undersell the dangers of tech savy teens, but they can&#039;t really ship to their house. Also, people must use security and remain anony. I first heard of SR on the local news where a mother claimed her son died from pharmies he got from SR. However, my personal experience has been nothing but positive. I spent years of my life dealing with dealers and vague explainations on what I was getting. But her it is an informed calculated decision. Risk exsists, but optimistically speaking I can research and ask best practices and place an order on my own decision, and I have to say that all my experiences with experimentation have only been beautiful. Keep true, safe, and informed. That&#039;s my 2 cents.

There is always a delay due to shipping times and such.<br /><br />I consider SR to be far safer compared to buying drugs off the streets. Apart from the delay there is also the feedback system, which catches people selling the wrong substance and even those cutting drugs. Compare that to some dude selling drugs out of a car with fake license plates and it should be clear which is the safer option ;)

Here&#039;s another way of looking at it: Some kid at a party could get handed any drug, use it with no research and get sick or die.<br /><br />To buy on SR definitely requires work and research: BTC, PGP, ToR...etc. And there are Harm Reduction posts and forums everywhere that a person is likely to stumble upon when trying to order, even if they&#039;re not looking for it! If they ARE looking for it, the info is plentiful and for the most part pretty accurate and helpful.<br /><br />Many vendors of harder, dangerous drugs even include warnings and harm reduction advice in the listing for the product itself.<br /><br />Keep it safe party peeples!!! ^_^

				I think SR is just as well the same as buying from the street, in many cases there won&#039;t be someone to &quot;guide&quot; you and what drugs you decide to take is up to your discretion.<br /><br />The internet has so many resources you can find information on every drug out there on, even the obscure RCs on the market, and there&#039;s more than enough info about how &quot;dangerous&quot; every drug actually is, from users who&#039;ve walked those roads.&nbsp; Erowid, bluelight, and an assortment of other random drug forums.&nbsp; You spend a few hours browsing those for information on a drug that interests you and you&#039;ll probably very easily know what your decision ends up being by the end of that.

				That&#039;s and interesting concept indeed.<br /><br />I suppose when ordering online, people may first orient on what drug they actually want to take, and then find some way to source the substance.<br /><br />On the streets and in the clubs its often the order way around: most dealers will not ship an array of compounds to choose from, if you want to buy some pills in a club, the choice usually is (mediocre) mdma, aphetamine, or forget about it and have some more drinks. Places like SR at least allow a wider selection what might include substances that are less harmful, and with the feedback system, probably less likely to be cut with whatever you could think of.
