				So quick overview, am a pretty regular cannabis user but need to get a job so i have been trying out spice lately. Smoked most of the after noon, got home was almost sober so smoked a bowl of weed since i am smoking the last of this then i am done with weed, then had a few bowls of JWH - 18 purchased from an SR vendor. <br /><br />So i was pretty high, had to go pee and noticed my genitals in general felt very weird. Get to the bathroom and urinating is very hard, as&nbsp; it begins to flow i am suddenly overwhelmed unable to handle or understand anything and fall ( i dont remember falling) i do remember fighting to be able to focus my eyes, as they did i was laying across the floor my head felt like a car battery was attachted to it. As im typeing i can feel clear damage to&nbsp; my elblow, and when i stood up i was very disoriented and could not understand anything. i slowly came back in front of the mirror washing my face. I feel nothing except the high and elbow pain, slight ache in neck. Should i be worried or did i just get too cocky and over do it?

				JWH-18 is known to trigger seizures in high doses. here&#039;s a report from a medical journal http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21970775<br />So&nbsp; to answer your question, it sounds like you both had a seizure and OD&#039;d.<br />be careful man

				Well sorry for the slow response, on top of this event have been blitzing to get a lot of my shit in order. Thank you for the good response, after more research and other users personal experiences i have absolutely no doubt that i had a minor seizure.<br /><br />&nbsp;As too your question, no i currently take zero prescription pills, and only a natural sleep aid on some nights. ( l-theanine 500mg and melatonin 3mg ) Although 2 days before, I had used a 5mg tab of DOM/STP which may be related? Sadly with the career choices i have in mind, using marijuana at any point after this December is not an option. <br /><br />After that post a second order of spice i had already placed arrived, which at first, I was just going to get rid of. But it was a half O of a blend i knew i liked and i just couldn&#039;t do it, plus having zero cash means i cant get any weed to keep me chill. So now i have noticed ( half an O later) whenever i smoke spice, i am constantly aware of an urge to urinate, and the strange sensation i described in the OP. I intentionally resist this urge as i know i do not need to urinate, nor am i willing to risk it again. I would almost venture to say that the peeing is what triggered the seizure, but have no real basis to argue that. Anyway am holding off on further orders of any Synthetics. <br /><br />Guess i need to look for a better substitute, any suggestions?

				Be extremely careful with how much you smoke if you continue to smoke spice, I remember reading somewhere that once you have your first seizure, its very easy to them to happen again. Hopefully you didn&#039;t hurt your head or anything else when falling, try and take it easy the next few days.<br /><br />I take 1.5mg-3mg of Melatonin every night, I never had a problem with it &amp; spice. Although I haven&#039;t smoked very much spice in my life either. You most likely just OD&#039;d, the DOM wouldn&#039;t affect it.

				In all honesty, i have probably used double or triple the amount (in one sitting) since that night. While realizing the dangers of pushing it, for example death, I guess i just really wanted a slightly better understanding of what happened, that and i definitely have trouble keeping myself sober especially with all this recent stress and lack of good sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;My head was actually not injured which is odd considering my elbow may be actually damaged from the same fall, cant extend fully without slight pain, any pressure extending it backwards beyond 180 degrees is extremely painful. Must have caught all my weight on that arm? But my arm will survive. <br /><br />I have to wonder if either i triggered the seizure somehow or this was due, at least in part, to using JHW specifically. Most articles i see out there only seem to point towards JWH as a high seizure risk, having little to no real data on separate compounds. This could just be due to JWH being a much more common cannabinoid.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Makes you wonder what they will discover about synthetics in the future. Or any RC at that. Im sure i will look back at a few of these and think &quot;Shit that was dumb&quot; :P

				I have been a regular cannabis smoker for a long time. Well before I found SR I was just getting my bud off the street. Well the only guy that could get anything other than Reggie at the time went to prison to do a 6 month stretch. So Spice was in the news quite a bit so I did a little homework and ended up buying some at my local ArabMart. Fast forward a few months and it is outlawed in my state so I find a couple sites on the clearnet that would still ship to me. I found this product called Fubar, smelled like Chocolate and had a smooth smoke to it, but man just a few hits would get you fucked up, seriously fucked up. The shit was expensive too, used to pay like 50 bucks for 3 grams. So I had been smokin it daily for a couple months when weird shit started happening. One time in particular, the time I really knew something was wrong, I had just smoked a bowl and came in to watch tv with my wife. She asked me a question and I responded normally or so I thought. She said, &quot;Are you having a stroke?&quot; Starting to freak out I said I did not think so and she said, &quot;You are talking really slow and slurring your words really bad.&quot; I never blacked out though.<br />I am so glad I gave those up. One big problem, especially the case with Fubar is you didn&#039;t know exactly what synthetic compound was in it but in my case it was well after the JWH bans so I don&#039;t think it was that.

Unless your job is VERY high-profile and related to drug distribution, I doubt they use GC-MS at first. They probably use one of those drug testing kits you can find in your local drug story.&nbsp; They are easily fooled by good fake piss.<br /><br />JWH is NOT like weed. It&#039;s mechanism is different. It&#039;s a full antagonist, as opposed to a partial antagonist.&nbsp; What does this mean? We don&#039;t know. No one has really done extensive research on it. The chemist that made it will tell you that he hasn&#039;t a clue what it does otherwise.<br /><br />It&#039;s your life, and you can risk it however you want. But do note that the only similarity in JWH and weed is the superficial high. Medical literature is being populated now with cases of JWH exposure.&nbsp; Basically, you are the clinical trial, except no one is watching your vitals and ready to administer treatment in the event things go wrong. <br /><br />Then there&#039;s weed that&#039;s been smoked before civilization. There are lots and lots of people trying to vilify weed, but it&#039;s just so fucking (mostly) innocuous that people are seeing that it makes no sense to keep it illegal.

				I understand the lack of similarity between synthetics and cannabis, or lack of any chemical similarity. The job will regularly do full scope piss tests, more then likely draw blood, slight chance they will be doing my hair actually. Now that i think of it would they see synthetics or not unless they were looking for them? I want to try Kratom or similer botanicals because i more then likely would be satisfied with them, Just need a job and cash now, and a Career later.<br />
