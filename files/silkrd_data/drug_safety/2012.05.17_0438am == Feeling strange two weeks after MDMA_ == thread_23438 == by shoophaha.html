				Hello everyone, I&#039;m asking this on behalf of a friend. He took one or two caps (not sure) of tan molly (this is just anecdotal, I didn&#039;t roll with them) and two weeks later, is feeling tingling in his extremities and facial nerves, as well as joint and chest pain. I was wondering if anyone had similar experiences and could provide any advice. I&#039;ve rolled a few times but had never experienced anything like this so I wasn&#039;t sure what to tell him.

				Pills are always adulterated, that&#039;s why lil bro only goes for pure crystals MDMA. Lesson learnt and read the &#039;Pills Reports&#039; before ingestion. <br /><br />What he experienced can be side effects, is this the first time he eat molly?

				I doubt it is the effects 2 weeks later. My guess is that he is anxious and is getting himself more worried with these feelings. At worst, tell him to go to the Dr to get some piece of mind.

				Best see a doc but ll he would say is get more exercise, avoid MDMA for a while and get plenty of sunshine.<br /><br />Possible the MDMA had other things in there and some RC chemicals could leave someone a bit wasted a couple of weeks later maybe.<br /><br />Odds are its nothing.

				That&#039;s most likely psychosomatic / a manifestation of an anxiety problem. It&#039;s possible he got something really nasty (some kind of PMMA/PMA mix maybe?) that caused some vasoconstrictive problems but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s very likely.<br /><br />Now lingering mental effects, that I would say is possible depending on dosage.

				It&#039;s great that we all pull together and try and help each other to relax on drugs we are taking.<br /><br />Much Love <br /><br />Dank<br /><br />(I&#039;m a little high and feeling all cuddly!!)

				Sounds like a lack of oxygen / circulation.&nbsp; Not sure on the cure, or if MDMA was the actual cause, but I&#039;d have him look more into that.&nbsp; I personally have felt that with meth, and never touched the stuff again.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest light exercise, healthy eating, possible detox regimen, maybe quitting smoking if they do that.

				Yeah I&#039;ve had all types of crappy adulterated pills and although I haven&#039;t had those symptoms I&#039;ve had a few weird side effects weeks after.
