				I bought a batch of BuddhaNature&#039;s 20mg Psilacetin &quot;Shroom Pills&quot; (4-AcO-DMT) and a couple of grams from Ivory in the interest of hippyflipping... have flipped before using shrooms and fell in love with it.&nbsp; I only have a slight concern that I&#039;m missing something important... these are safe to take together?&nbsp; <br /><br />RC&#039;s always throw my head for a loop, sorry for my newbness&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Thanks in advance

				It&#039;s safe. 4-aco-dmt is one of the safer RC&#039;s out there imo. Most of the 4-substituted tryptamines lack the harshness that the 5-meo tryptamines can bring.

				Sorry, Buddha, I lost track of this thread!&nbsp; My experience was AMAZING.&nbsp; I would definitely love to see a mixed press from you... I will without a doubt order these shroomies again.&nbsp; The hippyflip was sensational, in the most literal sense of the word, but the pills by themselves even were phenomenal.&nbsp; So cathartic!&nbsp; I laughed, I cried, I came to terms with some very real shit I&#039;d been burying and when I came through, I felt like a new person.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to see what you come up with.<br /><br />I definitely recommend trying Buddha&#039;s products... top notch!<br /><br />Thanks, BN!
