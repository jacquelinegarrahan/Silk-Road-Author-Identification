				I&#039;m curious about my coke habits. I only enjoy coke by myself and not as a social enhancer. I&#039;m much more confident sober than on coke as it makes self-conscious, paranoid, and tired as soon as it wears off unless I keep doing lines and lines. <br /><br />I only do 2-3 small lines about 150mg a night every 2-3 nights. And I feel good for about 3 hours or so then I wait a little then smoke a bowl. <br /><br />Will this kill me if I&#039;m only doing 150mg every 3 or so days at night??<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The first thing to know is everyone is different. A professional basketball player died of a heart attack after doing cocaine once.<br /><br />I myself do roughly an 8th of coke a weekend. I have been doing this for around 2 years. I am a weekend warrior and am completely sober on my work weeks, but I unleash during the weekend.<br /><br />I doubt you will die from that amount, but you never know. Just be careful. You are more likely to get some kind of nasty sinus infection than you are to die. So clean your plate, have a brand new clean razor, and don&#039;t use dollar bills and I think you will be okay.

				The thing about coke is people tend to start neglecting their health in favor of their addiction to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you might start getting bloody noses but continue to use anyway.&nbsp; You might start getting chest/arm pains but continue to use anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp;In other words, even if we could answer your question, if you keep using the answer probably won&#039;t matter much. <br /><br />Generally I would not make a habit of it, long term it will wreak havoc on your body.&nbsp; Fortunately the poster above me hasn&#039;t died but he might die tomorrow (and I pray you don&#039;t buddy).&nbsp; You&#039;ll hear of people using for many years and others who only use a few times having heart attacks.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />IMO I&#039;d rather die than have a serious stroke and live crippled the rest of my life, or have a heart attack and have to pay for an ER visit.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not a choice you really get to make.

				Two very good answers.. Thank you guys it really gives me another perspective. I&#039;ve never thought of the neglecting health issues.. etc.<br /><br />I really appreciate the time you guys took to write your responses!<br /><br />I will probably reconsider my habits or maybe just once every 5 days or so. I&#039;ve been doing this 150mg per 4 days for few months now so I hope I didn&#039;t do too much damage :( I always made sure my nose isn&#039;t sore before I use again. And I only use 89% pure coke :)

				An 8th a month will not kill you nor would an 8th a day but it&#039;ll surely kill your pockets life and your whole being so the moral to this story is just dabble and do when needed ie at a party on your own for some sort of boost etc etc but yeah really an 8th a day wouldn&#039;t kill you it&#039;ll only kill everything and everyone around you hope you like my answer as it&#039;s a common sense truth approach to your question remember just dabble when need be ok

Quality of life is another factor to consider. Even if an 8th a day does not kill you, it probably won&#039;t do any good to your brain nor to your overall well being. There was a post in the DoctorX thread about a guy doing so much coke he was having paranoid hallucinations and terrifying experiences. <br /><br />I&#039;d say whenever you consider doing a drug, ask yourself the following questions : <br /><br />- How safe is it for my health ? <br />- How will it affect my mood and cognitive skills post-use ? <br />- Will I be able to this regularly and still function normally ? <br />- Will it get me addicted ? How fast ? <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m 56 and kinda getting back into the drug thing after a long vacation. <br />Everybody is different, but the most enduring harm that has happened to me due to drugs is my criminal record. Once you get on law enforcements &#039;screen&#039; in your neighborhood, they will keep an eye on you, and &#039;check you out&#039; at the most inconvienient times. Also if you have a habit you&#039;ll be needing to raise money, which can be ok as long as you have a job, but sometimes drug use comes between you and a job, and since w/o a job you still need the money,&nbsp; you might consider some peoples &#039;advice&#039; (&#039;hey just wait for me outside in your car, I&#039;ll be back in a minute&#039;-&#039;hey I know this great way to get some money&#039; is another good one)<br />One of my long &#039;stays&#039; in a county jail, I told them that I was depressed and couldn&#039;t sleep, so they put me in the &#039;psyche&#039; ward and gave me this anti depressant that would help me sleep. You tended to stay in your cell more often than general population, but I didn&#039;t mind this as long as I had something to read, and it was much quieter. It was so fucking noisy in the general population that it was difficult to sleep, they had SO MANY LOUD IDIOTS that thought that they were &#039;budding&#039; thugs, and felt that the noisier that you were the badder your reputation would be. I can&#039;t stand those people. <br />Anyway I did over a year in county jail, and I&#039;d see people come and go. They had this one guy that came in on some drug charge and he said that he scored coke for some minor rock and roll group in the area. The first time that he was there he seemed to be normal to me, then he left and I don&#039;t know how long it was but he later came back. There was something wrong with him when he came back. He used to say that he would do these enormous amounts of coke, he pretty much got it free because he was scoring it for that rock and roll group (that I guess he was a &#039;groupee&#039; of) It was like he was preoccupied all the time when he came back. His personality change was obvious, and I didn&#039;t ask him if he felt any different, and didn&#039;t bring up the subject at all. <br />I think coke is stronger in it&#039;s own way than crank, I&#039;ve known people who thought crank was the best drug in the world, and they would do it for long periods of time. Everybody knew that you can get a type of paranoia from excessive use, part of it is supposed to feel like there are ants crawling on your skin. <br />Coke is the only drug that I would have reservations about it being legal, I mean all the rest of the drugs (well maybe pcp and SOME people-but hell I&#039;ve done a lot of that too) I don&#039;t see a problem being legal. Sure there will be people who get into &#039;trouble&#039; (like DUI, paranoia, etc and addiction with heroin and there are some nasty addictions to some pills like the downers-which I haven&#039;t seen in years with exception of SR and Qualuudes) but I think it&#039;s possible for the AVERAGE person to &#039;get into trouble&#039; with coke. It&#039;s a drug that everybody likes RIGHT off.
