				Both times I&#039;ve smoked DMT it was out of a dry bong with a screen, the kind for oil and waxes. I have one of these but reading online I can&#039;t find anyone else who has smoked DMT, so I&#039;m curious if those who have smoked DMT many times think I&#039;d be better off buying a freebase pipe instead?

				If the bong can vaporize the DMT (not lighting it directly), and capture all of the vapor to get ur lungs full, then that should work fine. I&#039;ve used one and had good success. The vapor pipes are nice because you heat the pipe indirectly, which melts/vaporizes the Deemster to inhale, and it looks cool!

				They put weed on top of the dmt and lit the weed directly, probably wasteful then? I don&#039;t know what a vapor pipe is, same thing as a freebase pipe? I&#039;ll have to see how much those are at my headshop.

				I bought a freebase pipe right off of here for very cheap and I definitely prefer it to any other method. You get that beautiful smell and taste of pure DMT and you don&#039;t waste any material

				I bought it from PriscillaMarie90 http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/279f745639 <br /><br />But it looks like she might be out of comission for a while, never hurts to send a PM though.<br /><br />If anything though I understand that they sell these sort of pipes in wal-mart (lol) for like 3 bucks.<br /><br /><br />And as for the taste, it kind of grows on you. I was scared to try it again after I first tasted it because it just made my throat feel like it was on fire. Now I actually like it

				Have a shitload of DMT. Can anyone else confirm this; DMT freebase is kinda hard to burn, and does not effectively melt when vaped?

There always seems to be enough material left to trip again an hour later with the same dose though, if that is what you are talking about.

				I only use one specific glass pipe for when I smoke DMT sandwiched between bud, because that resin can spark up an unexpected trip which would scare the shit out of my friends. I much prefer using my oilburner though. For one thing it&#039;s not as harsh in my opinion, for another I can easily tell if there&#039;s enough resin left to blast off again or not. This may be entirely placebo effect, but I feel like smoking DMT with tree has a grounding effect and greatly clouds the trip. That being said, smoking from my oilburner seems much more potent and provides a cleaner experience. If you want an easier time &#039;breaking through&#039; on this beautiful substance, go with a freebase pipe. I bought mine at a smokeshop for $3, I see them at every shop I visit and even some gas stations too oddly enough. :D
