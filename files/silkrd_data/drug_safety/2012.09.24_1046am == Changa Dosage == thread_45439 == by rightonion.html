				I am planning on smoking changa for the first time tonight. I plan on starting with a medium dose, probably not breakthrough territory but enough to know what changa is really about :)<br /><br />The changa I have obtained is composed of the following:<br /><br />20% NN DMT (white freebase)<br />20% Jungle Spice (dark DMT)<br />40% B Caapi<br />20% Passionflower<br /><br />I was wondering what would be considered a &quot;medium&quot; dose of this. The vendor recommended 150mg-200mg for a breakthrough, but this seems pretty high if I am right in thinking it is 40% DMT. I was thinking of starting at around 50mg? <br /><br />Any advice would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Right

				The way to go with Changa in my experience is start small and work your way up, acclimatize if you know what I mean. Have a little bit, see how you feel, have a little bit more.<br />I have some of Asylum&#039;s changa too, i.e. the same blend as yours, I&#039;ve not tried this particular changa yet myself, but I&#039;ve been reliably informed by friends that it&#039;s pretty intense. I might give it a bash myself tonight, haven&#039;t been in the right mood for changa the past couple days, I love the stuff, but it&#039;s definitely a &quot;right place, right time&quot; type of drug.<br />Oh don&#039;t be fooled in to thinking that&#039;s 40mg of DMT, Jungle Spice might or might not be a type of DMT, what it actually is is open to debate, read up on DMT nexus, or similar, or ask Asylum, he&#039;s well informative. <br />Hope this helps you a bit, if you don&#039;t mind drop me a PM, let me know how you go, I wouldn&#039;t mind comparing notes on this changa. <br />I&#039;m familiar with changa but never tried Jungle Spice, so little apprehensive.

				Sadly could not sample it tonight. It shall have to wait. I will follow your advice of building up then. Was doing a bit of research on jungle spice. There seems to be very mixed opinions on the stuff. Anyone have any experience?&nbsp; What kind of size bowl do you think I should rip first?
