				I got some LSD of what appears to be a really reliable seller. My best friend flipped out and told me you can&#039;t trust anything online and that it&#039;s most likely laced with Strychnine.<br /><br />This is my first trip I&#039;ll be taking. I was about to go into this thinking everything was perfectly ok. Except how crazy flipped out my buddy is now has me nervous. Paranoid even.<br /><br />How do I guarantee the safety of what I order? I understand that inevitably there is no way to truly ever know with chemicals, aside being a chemist.<br /><br />But what steps can I do to ensure that my newly acquired LSD is pure and healthy and not cut with anything?<br /><br />Thanks so much.

				no offense but your friend is an idiot, and obviously knows nothing about TOR and the underground online drug market. <br />If you type &quot;Buy LSD tabs&quot; in google and find something and buy it, it is likely fake, and this is probably what your friend is thinking you did<br /><br />If the product isn&#039;t legit, you would see some bad reviews or complaints from the customers, if you&#039;re ordering from an established vendor with good feedback and many transactions its very unlikely you&#039;re getting something fake/laced

				There are certain reagent-based tests that can be useful in identifying substances. For LSD, the Ehrlich&#039;s reagent (available amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C2I6Z0/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_details) can be useful in at least ensuring that you haven&#039;t gotten a DOx or something else.<br /><br />But, like everybody said, if the vendor is reputable, I wouldn&#039;t be concerned. The styrchnine is a myth.<br /><br />If it is replaced with something, the effects will be very different than you expect, and I&#039;d take note of that.

				Strychnine-laced LSD is an urban myth. Blotter paper has a very low absorption capacity. LSD is active in the 100-microgram range, so it can be put on a blotter and used effectively. Strychnine is not. You&#039;d have to eat one or two ten-strips of laced blotter to get any ill effects from strychnine poisoning. Your friend has no idea what he&#039;s talking about.

				Acid is generally quite safe on blotter. The only thing people might use is an RC but anyone experienced with LSD will know right away and obviously slap you with a 1.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t taste anything its LSD (or nothing lol) if you can its RC. <br /><br />((On the other hand, 25I blotters are quite nice IMO))<br /><br />The purity of drugs on SR is simply ASTOUNDING, then again there is quite a lot of accountability on SR. I&#039;ve gotten SO much fake acid IRL. <br /><br />

Most of the time people are relatively honest about what they&#039;ve got; I&#039;ve been gipped on acid far too many times in person. One person (SO STUPID) laid it themselves and didn&#039;t know that it wasn&#039;t real acid. I didn&#039;t know people could be so retarded. But most people who can figure out Tor are actually rather intelligent and good people. =]

While it&#039;s true that LSD itself is tasteless, it&#039;s perfectly possible (and frequently happens) that an LSD blotter will be bitter due to the ink from the blotter art.
