				IME, with street coke you can just eye out 1 inch lines till you get to where you wanna be, but the street coke I&#039;m able to get is cut to shit. If the coke you get on here is high quality I would start with just little bumps and see where it takes you. From what I&#039;ve read online and heard overdosing on cocaine&#039;s somewhat hard.

				Whenever I&#039;m trying a new batch, I just start with one baby line, as thin as a match stick and about half as long. I find that gives me an idea of what the coke is like before making too much of a commitment. I think you&#039;d be fine to start with that.

				I read on Bluelight that you should start out with 20mg-50mg (if you&#039;re looking for numbers) and work your way up. Cocaine you get here is 80% pure or better, street cocaine vary&#039;s wildly, but most users will ever only see 1-30%. Don&#039;t automatically assume your cocaine is 30% pure either, the US government had a raid a few years back and got a bunch of cocaine. I remember it tested around 10% pure, and it had lots of levisemole in it.

				The coke on SR ranges from 0-100% purity.&nbsp; I suppose that&#039;s bad news and good news.<br /><br />Overpriced for what it is.&nbsp; I buy it sometimes but I don&#039;t know why.&nbsp; Enjoy it though Apple.&nbsp; :)

				Here&#039;s the dilemma in terms of getting the coke; usually street coke is cut to fuck; the coke on here is usually of high quality(depending on vendor) but expensive to fuck!<br /><br />My advice would buy it of SR,wasting your&nbsp; money otherwise--trust me i&#039;ve been sold talcum powder as coke before off the streets :(<br /><br />My advice on actually taking the drug--start with 50mg-- small dose--and go from there--maybe another 50mg dose after 20 mins-- then knock it up to 100mg--medium dose in my opinion. <br /><br />It may sound strange but unless you&#039;ve had a lot to drink-- it will come naturally how much to do and when--- just go with the flow and you&#039;ll love it (if its decent coke off here)<br /><br />Peace man, hope that helps a little.

Like a night out or something?<br /><br />Because if you are taking it for a night where you want to be high for lets say, at least 5 hours. Buy some more. I like to do my coke in 50mg lines roughly, so 100mg would only do two lines and the high I get from 50mg last about 45mins-1hour, so that would be two hours of fun, followed by 2 hours of hell. I find when I run out of coke, I only really get a two hour comedown and it&#039;s not so much of a comedown it&#039;s just more of that feeling of &#039;Holy shit, I want more coke!! Where&#039;s all the coke!?&#039; <br /><br />But if you are just curious as to what the high is like, 100mg is more than enough for a first timer just sitting at home&nbsp; :)

				With new coke I actually recommend insufflating a very small amount to start due to the fact that you can&#039;t be sure it is any good and worse it might do something harmful.&nbsp; Many people call this an allergy test.

				Everything people said in this thread is correct... I would like to add though that having some Valium handy is recommended... You probably won&#039;t need it but when taking Stims, I&#039;d always recommend it in case. Valium is perfectly safe, it is even given in hospital for Stimulant overdoses... Benzos have little effect on heart rate and BP and therefore can be safely used with Stims. <br /><br />I doubt you&#039;ll get anxious (especially since you&#039;re only planning on getting .1) But keeping a Valium handy for the comedown is a good move.&nbsp; At the very least, it might help you chill out and sleep after. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have any problem sleeping on Coke but it&#039;s always best to have one&nbsp; handy anyway. With Amphetamine I&#039;d definitely recommend Benzos lol... That shit keeps me awake all night.

				Just read somewhere that somebody wasn&#039;t too happy with the coke from the same seller you bought from. They rated it as just above street level so maybe you got the wrong seller to start with!<br /><br />If you go for it again, try get some from Bungee54 or Studio54. These two have the best! You&#039;ll have to keep an eye on Studio&#039;s though as he sells out really quickly! <br /><br />
