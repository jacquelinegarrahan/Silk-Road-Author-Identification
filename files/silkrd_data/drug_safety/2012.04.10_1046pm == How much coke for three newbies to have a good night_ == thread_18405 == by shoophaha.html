				My two friends and I want to try cocaine. We&#039;re poor college students so we were just going to buy some for a special occasion, like one of our birthdays. I have no idea how many grams we&#039;d need though, nor do I know how many lines are in a gram, how long a line lasts, etc. I&#039;ve only ever done key bumps of MDMA. Any advice would be appreciated!

				A gram of good coke from any of the reputable vendors here will last you the night. Start with half a baby-finger nail sized line or bump and only move up from there if you can handle it.&nbsp; Good coke doesn&#039;t require you to refresh a line or bump every 10 minutes either.

				I think 2 grams would be good. I doubt the 3 of you would do 2 grams but there is a good chance that you guys may do the entire gram before the night is over. But once that gram is out you wont be able to party. I also suggest you get a downer for the come down so you can go to sleep. Xanax is great to come down from coke and also Valium.
