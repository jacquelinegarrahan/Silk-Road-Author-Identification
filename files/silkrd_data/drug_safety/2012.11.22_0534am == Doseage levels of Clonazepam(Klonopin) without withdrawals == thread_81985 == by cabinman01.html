				Any advice on what kind of doseage levels for clonazepam that i can take without getting withdrawals?&nbsp; I have been taking small amounts of clon&#039;s regularly, but haven&#039;t seemed to build up much of an addiction.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t pushed the doseage past 1mg though as far as amount in the pill.&nbsp; Any tips?&nbsp; ;D

				In my experience, if you continue to take it for a long time (regardless of dose), you WILL GET WITHDRAWALS - admittedly lesser than if you had been taking a higher dose, but still not fun at all. You&#039;ll feel like you can&#039;t sit still, and all anxious and generally nasty - take a break my man :)

				At the moment that does not seem like such a bad idea...damn it if i didn&#039;t love pills. How long would you say until the withdrawals would occur from ending use?

				I take k-pin 1mg twice a day, for the last couple months. Has really helped my (legitimate) anxiety. This is actually lower dosage than many docs prescribe. I&#039;ve never had issues with withdrawals from benzo&#039;s, and I&#039;ve been taking valium for over 2 years; not every single day but often. If you want to preemptively avoid withdraws, slowly taper off your dosage.

				Thanks for the advice guys, I think that i may bump it up a bit.&nbsp; Kpins are very efficient, love the half life on these pills.

				So i sourced some 2mg Xanax bars around my area, i have been enjoying them to go to sleep.&nbsp; But i guess i had no idea there was some sort of withdrawal symptoms from benzos... does this mean i would be more susceptible to panic attacks?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only ever had one and it was because i was abusing adderol and smoking weed.<br /><br />Other than that i just wanted them for a long night of tripping or a bad hangover.<br />
