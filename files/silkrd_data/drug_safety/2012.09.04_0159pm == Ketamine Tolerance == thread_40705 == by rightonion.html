				Title: <strong>Ketamine Tolerance</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Over the last 6 months my tolerance to Ketamine has hit a rather high level and my wallet is starting to feel the pinch. <br /><br />My question is is this an irreversible tolerance, similar to my tolerance to MDMA which even after 5 months of not touching the stuff has no where near the effects it used to.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will a month off be enough to reduce my tolerance to a sensible level or will I continue to hit lines that look slightly grotesque :P

				I cant see you going back to the point where u do a small line and feeling it but i think a month will reduce your tolerance a little. I think a similar time off to your MD break would do the trick.<br />Do you do k to hole or not? Coz you could look at IM, know its not for evryone but itll save the money!

				I just found something on clearweb that said k tolerance only tends to go one way and thats up.<br />Ime a long break will help but not completely get rid of it. I think it all dependant on your daily usage as well

				I can guarantee you that ketamine tolerance goes down over time, if it didn&#039;t I would need to sniff a gram at a time. After going on monster binges I get to the point that I need to sniff lines as long and thick as a pencil, after not touching it for months I am back to before.

				In the same position right now lol, got a g left and another g coming from fred as there is alot of hype about it once that&#039;s gone then I&#039;m gonna try give it a break for 1-2 months.<br /><br />It hasn&#039;t been affecting my wallet majorly because I buy about 10g at a time then sell it to friends to cover the costs of my own stash.

				What do you guys would be a good frequency of ketamine use to prevent tolerance buildup?

				after a month without touching it, your tolerance falls definitely. I remember getting to the point where I would do a gram in 2 lines.. then after a month and a bit did just over a tenth g line and holed.. <br />But be really careful of what Ianfleming says, your bladder will shrivel up if you do it too much and u´ll be pissing every 5 minutes. and u´ll need to go to hospital to have it stretched out again, its&nbsp; fucking horrible, not from personal experience but what my mates that have had the problem have said. Also one of my ex´s had the problem, do you know how fucking annoying it is to go out with someone that needs to piss every half hour?! K is a drug that its really not worth doing a lot regularly for a long period.. also really screws up your short term memory and Im not sure if that is reversible...
