				So I have truly pathetic chemistry knowledge and skills.&nbsp; I know about acid/base extractions (the high level stuff), acetone washes, solubility and all that, but only in a truly cursory way.&nbsp; My problem is that I take meth daily and I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that even the best meth I can get my hands on is only about 50-70% pure.&nbsp; The other portion appears, unfortunately, to be isopropylbenzylamine or one of its close cousins.<br /><br />My reasons for suspecting this aren&#039;t extensive or anything, but the cut does not seem to be psychoactively inert, it blends *beautifully* with the meth, the vaporization point is only slightly higher than meth HCl, and the shards are too brittle and break/crumble too easily in isolated sections.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible the cut I&#039;m dealing with is something totally different, but iso is my best guess.&nbsp; So the problem is this: how the fuck do I separate my meth from this shit that dulls my mind and seems to be over time degrading my health more than the meth should be on its own?<br /><br />Please understand I&#039;m not the kind of fool who thinks meth is 100% safe.&nbsp; I understand what I&#039;m doing to myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking to pay the price for the meth.&nbsp; Paying the price for the other shit in these shards is not part of my &quot;acceptable cost,&quot; frame of mind.&nbsp; So for one, is it possible to separate isopropylbenzylamine from methamphetamine when they&#039;re so chemically similar (even the molar mass is very similar -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropylbenzylamine)?<br /><br />If so, can it be done by someone with access only to OTC chemicals, only basic glassware, and no real experience to speak of?<br /><br />Either way, even if I can&#039;t do it, I do find the science itself interesting so I&#039;d love to learn whatever I can about the process and why it is or isn&#039;t plausible.&nbsp; Could someone take the time to share their knowledge?&nbsp; I would be truly, truly grateful.&nbsp; This represents my daily ritual: know that whatever time you spare could easily be doing me a world of good years down the line.&nbsp; I will also thank you profusely :)

				Methamphetamine is C10H15N.&nbsp; Isopropylbenzylamine is C10H15N.&nbsp; Molar mass of methamphetamine is 149.23g/mol.&nbsp; Isopropyl is 149.23g/mol.&nbsp; They&#039;re virtually identical; meth melts at 170-175 degrees. Depending on whether I&#039;m dealing with methylbenzylamine, ethylbenzylamine, or isopropylbenzylamine, the cut melts between 180-190 degrees.<br /><br />None, to my knowledge, are acetone soluble.&nbsp; Meaning acetone will do nothing but leech equal parts cut &amp; meth from my product.&nbsp; That&#039;s not exactly what I&#039;m after.<br /><br />I was rather hoping for something I could apply en masse, as it were.&nbsp; But I&#039;ll be totally frank: I have absolutely no clue why in the name of God I&#039;d want to concentrate butane and then ignite it.&nbsp; Exactly what is that supposed to do, other than cause a small burst of flame?&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine how that would do anything except effect the very surface of the product... hrm...

				Hi there folks, <br /><br />My chemistry knowledge is nonexistant, and my meth usage is frequent, so I have come here with the same urgency to find a way of purifying the &#039;meth&#039; that I am consuming. <br /><br />Firstly, I was under the impression that meth was not acetone soluble. Can anyone confrirm this?<br /><br />Also I am now confused about the different melting points. From my own observation of using the pipe, I see the first few turns as blowing off the first cutter/solvent - this one often tastes like acetone -&nbsp; and is highly recommmended not to inhale this part.<br />As the bowl progresses, this taste disappears and we have (hopefully) the familiar taste and mouthfeel of &#039;meth&#039;, the melted bubble tends to get thicker and oily, recrystallises with those wonderful patterns (Mt.Fuji....spokewheels...???) <br /><br />Sometimes I&#039;ve scored pretty average gear that tastes and smokes badly (wet puddle with no form or surface tension, sets to a solid mess rather than recrystallises)...but after about half way through the burn, the good characteristics return to the smoke, the puddle and the recrystallised blob. I have assumed that it was cutters and impurities that are vaped off over the first half of the burn, and &#039;meth&#039; that is left over towards the end. If this was the case it would be the meth that has a higher boiling point, which allows the other stuff to burn away first.<br /><br />...or perhaps I am encountering other unknown chemicals in that first half of the burn, while the &#039;meth&#039; bubble at the end is just a combination of meth and standard cutters. <br /><br />Any informed input would be greatly appreciated here. :D<br /><br />

				According to the DEA meth melts some twenty degrees C below Isopropylbenzylamine... 170C vs. 190C.<br /><br />Besides taking advantage of that you could do some chemistry, but being structural isomers it is not going to be something you can probably do on your own without a working knowledge of&nbsp; organic chemistry.<br /><br />If you want to do some reading I would suggest googling the separation of amine structural isomers.&nbsp; The key to the reaction should be the difference in distance and dipole caused by the difference in location of the amine in these two compounds.&nbsp; <br /><br />

If this was the case it would be the meth that has a higher boiling point, which allows the other stuff to burn away first.<br /><br />...or perhaps I am encountering other unknown chemicals in that first half of the burn, while the &#039;meth&#039; bubble at the end is just a combination of meth and standard cutters. <br /><br />Any informed input would be greatly appreciated here. :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve given up vaping, so I have fewer clues to work with these days about the product and I&#039;m not going to be tempting myself by vaporizing the stuff a foot away from my mouth... long story short, I haven&#039;t found a way yet to separate this one particular cut.&nbsp; Meth is not acetone soluble, nor is the cut.<br /><br />My &quot;leech equal parts&quot; statement is because they&#039;re both water soluble, and even &quot;pure&quot; acetone from the hardware store has H20 impurities.&nbsp; You can leech some of the H20 out by pretreating with... oh, what is it... magnesium?&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember, but they&#039;re epsom salts -- whatever that stuff really is.&nbsp; You heat them at about 400 or 450 in the oven for like an hour or two, and it&#039;ll become brittle and chalky sort of.&nbsp; Then you let some soak in acetone, separate the acetone very carefully after awhile, and you get slightly purer acetone good for doing acetone washes.<br /><br />The problem is that there&#039;s still H20 in there, and it&#039;s still going to leech off some of your meth.&nbsp; It&#039;ll leech off some of the cut too, but I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s more or less soluble in water... so I approximated with &quot;leech equal parts.&quot;&nbsp; Does that answer your question?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, got it now. I reckon if this &#039;dry acetone wash&#039; can be fine tuned, there may small enough levels of H2o left behind, making the amount of meth leeched off reduced to a tolerable level.&nbsp; I would be happy to sacrifice a bit of the real stuff as a tradeoff for removing a high level of cutters/impurities. Might have to hit the kitchen for some trial and error - I have some average gear leftover from an unfortunate transaction that I could donate to science.<br /><br />...and as for the professional cooks out there, I don&#039;t understand why they don&#039;t produce a high purity product and charge extra to make up for the reduced quantities achieved. I for one would fully support a vendor who supplied close-to-pure meth and charged double or even triple for their troubles. Perhaps it&#039;s just too hard these days to find the precursors ???

				Try to get your hands on some dl-methamphetamine, afaik you are aussie, about 10 years ago most of the meth you got from dealers was dl- due to being made via reduction of pseudoephedrine with red p and iodine.&nbsp; Since the replacement of pseudo in flu tablets back in 2006ish,&nbsp; you only get racemic meth these days.&nbsp; It could be that the 50% cut that you are noticing is merely l-methamphetamine.

				That&#039;s a good point, Fractal, except I think you&#039;ve got your cooks mixed up (either that or I do) -- reduction of pseudoephedrine via hydroiodic acid (which is created &quot;in situ&quot; by red phosphorous + i2 + h2o + heat) produces d-methamphetamine, not a racemic product.&nbsp; Since the pseudoephedrine is all dextro-, you end up with dextro- meth.&nbsp; If the p-fed is actually racemic (or was back in the day or something), then I assume it would be as you say.<br /><br />At any rate, the cut doesn&#039;t recrystallize the same way meth does.&nbsp; Infact I actually saw it stay liquid/gooey for literally 1-3 minutes once, so it can&#039;t just be levo- meth.&nbsp; Clever thought though :)

				Nope, you are absolutely right SS.&nbsp; I was the one who made a mixup, although I think it was more musclememory of typing dl constantly rather than d- or l-&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />strelitzia: Its not so much l-meth being more available, but more that large scale production is much more cost efficient when producing racemic meth rather than d-meth.&nbsp; So almost all the meth you get these days is &quot;cut&quot; with at least 50% l-methamphetamine, which is a peripheral stim rather than a CNS stim.&nbsp; Pure d-methamphetamine should have very little body load and quite a bit more kick in the neurological department. Unfortunately, its just slightly more expensive to make(not necessarily true if the red p is reclaimed after successful reduction, however most cooks cbf doing this)

				the l-meth shouldn&#039;t give you a headache though - not impossible but, as a side effect goes, that&#039;s a rare one.<br />Im assuming that the stuff&nbsp; you&#039;re getting is the cosmetic &quot;glass&quot; stuff since it&#039;s what seems to be the trend- so chances are that absolute or denatured alcohol wont wash whatever garbage was added out of it.&nbsp; Denatured Alcohol is&nbsp; what I would use next if acetone wasnt doing the job-it works the opposite way than the acetone- meth dissolves in it and i insoluble impurities get filtered behind. Might be worth a try but I have some doubts itll work against that cut agent.<br />Can try MEK- might work. Ether - if you can obtain it- I couldnt find much info on Isopropylbenzylamine&nbsp; other than it&#039;s water soluable and a possible skin irritant
