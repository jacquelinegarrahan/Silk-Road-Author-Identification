				I&#039;ve been browsing the Drug Safety forum and have found a number of threads on how to IV/insufflate some of the pills with the anti-abuse technology,&nbsp; specifically Opana ERs and Oxycontin OPs.&nbsp; However, there&#039;s no real detailed information on how to prepare an OP for insufflation outside of a mention that letting it sit in water for a while works, and of course there&#039;s the crisping method, but that doesn&#039;t really work that well either.&nbsp; So, assuming I&#039;m going to let my OPs sit in water for a long amount of time and then try to evaporate the water to leave the active ingredient, any tips on how I should do it?&nbsp; Oink&#039;s Opana Tek suggests just leaving the pills intact, no crushing or anything.&nbsp; But is it the same for OPs?&nbsp; I know the coating on OPs is just for decoration so was thinking that it might just be better to grind them up with a ped egg first.&nbsp; That way the active ingredients are extracted quicker.&nbsp; And, after letting the water extract all the active ingredients, should I use some kind of strainer/filter to remove the gunk?&nbsp; What kind of filter?&nbsp; Also, what&#039;s the best way to evaporate it?&nbsp; Just let the water spread out over a plate and put a fan on it?&nbsp; Or no fan since once it&#039;s dried the powder might be blown away?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help.<br /><br />On a side note, I&#039;m nearly 100% positive that a method similar to this works as I actually ran across a PDF document hosted on the fda.gov servers that has detailed information on the amount of oxycodone released in various substances and with various types of grinding tools.&nbsp; It seemed to conclude that the new OPs are hard to defeat if you want an instant release of the oxycodone, but if you&#039;re willing to wait then all of it can be had.&nbsp; I was actually trying to find the link again just now, but I can&#039;t so maybe they removed it?&nbsp; I found two versions of the document; one was obviously meant for public consumption, while the other looks nearly identical but has &#039;CONFIDENTIAL&#039; written on it, and has lots of extra information about all the testing and how to defeat the pill.&nbsp; It&#039;s still missing some information, but has a decent amount as well so I&#039;m curious as to whether or not it was meant to be released.&nbsp; Where is a good place to host the file so I can share it?
