				Just feel like sharing as I&#039;m buzzing my tits off.<br /><br />Speedball - IV injection of Cocaine and Heroin combined (warning can be very dangerous).<br /><br />I&#039;ll just repeat that warning, it can be very dangerous doing speedballs especially if your not experienced at judging the safe amount of BOTH combined (knowing your tolerance for each on there own may not be enough) and test the strength of each drug separately first if they&#039;re a new batch (you should always have a SMALL test shot on a new batch when IVing, saved me from poisoning once! Not to mention ODing!).<br /><br />(God you can see I&#039;m fucked, look at the size of that sentence above!) :o<br /><br />Anyway, speedballs and why I love them. To me they feel like my two favorite drugs, but combined to give ten fold the buzz. They seem to complement each other perfectly. The amazing rush and euphoria of the Coke that then seamlessly flows into the warm contentment of the H. The H totally smooths out the coke buzz, so at the time when a coke shot begins to tail off and might start to make you feel like re-dosing (or even a bit jittery if it&#039;s not the best coke), instead you feel that H glow of contentment (the &#039;back in the womb&#039; feeling). Speedballs are definitely greater than the sum of it&#039;s parts.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a little drug snobbery for you. To me I can see why Coke and H have stood the test of time. They both (separately or together) feel like...FUCK! I forgot what I was going to say! Mmmm. Er, yer, I can see why there the worlds favorite drugs. And as I get older, I don&#039;t feel up to the all consuming effects of some of the other drugs (MDMA, LSD, etc.). I like a drug that I can still function relatively normal on. And aren&#039;t to intense (in the way of LSD) and long acting.<br /><br />By the way, I don&#039;t drink alcohol (don&#039;t have anything against people that do :) ) only on social occasions. I only do my IV drugs at the weekend and I don&#039;t smoke weed anymore (or very rarely). What I&#039;m trying to say is I don&#039;t let my love for these things take over my life anymore. And, it&#039;s fucking expensive (in the UK I pay £100 a G of H and £125 a G of Coke. You can get cheaper here, but I have good conects and quality comes at a price!), so I try to keep my habit down.<br /><br />This is maybe a bit irresponsible this thread, because I wouldn&#039;t recommend you try speedballs or H, if you have never done it before and your in that 10% like me who have addictive and self-destructive personalitys. I&#039;m currently over 10+ years down this road after trying H. And it&#039;s only in the last couple of years I&#039;ve started doing coke regular. If you already have just an H habit, do you really want another one?<br />Oh, and don&#039;t get me started on IVing (worse life choice ever) because it hard to go back once you felt it&#039;s power and how at the start it cuts the cost of getting high in quarter.<br />So please make up for me with your own responsibility and if your are going to try speedballs and do your research and be safe! :)<br /><br />Anyone feel like sharing their experiences?

				Well some people say IV&#039;ing Dialudid is better than Heroin, more intense rush, nearly impossible to get in the UK though.<br /><br />
