				Alright, I&#039;ve been selling pressed pills for a while now, but to make a little more money I&#039;d like to start selling capsules of powder/crystal. The only issue I have, is how much I should put in each capsule.<br /><br />I was thinking 100mg, that way they could buy 2, drop one originally then boost with the other, but 100mg doesn&#039;t look like much inside of a capsule which isn&#039;t good marketing.<br /><br />If I do more powder, it&#039;ll be too much for them to drop at once which isn&#039;t good either.<br /><br />Any suggestions on how I should do this?

				I&#039;d have them around 125mg in a small gel capsule.<br /><br />Just sell it as pure mdma.

				I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s really the most upfront thing to do, but you do have a point -- if it looks like a small amount, the occasional buyer will probably assume it really is.&nbsp; Nothing stopping you from putting some water soluble vitamin powder in there if you really want to.&nbsp; Just make sure you double check that you don&#039;t put one a person can actually take too much of in, of course.<br /><br />Just saying it doesn&#039;t have to be a choice between too much or too little: just tell them exactly how much actual MDMA there is and they get exactly what they bought and wanted whether they get some vitamin C with it or anything else.

				Not to be too obvious, but you can get colored gel caps and probably just fix that problem right up. Can&#039;t look empty if they can&#039;t see in there.

				you could just get size 4 caps then put .1 in each and sell for 10 so like they could officially roll for $20 because that&#039;s most consumer&#039;s target

				I&#039;m getting 1G in a few days, but I don&#039;t have a proper scale.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if its going to be crystals or powder - how would you be able to estimate about how much 100mg is without dividing it up into 10 &#039;equal&#039; piles?&nbsp; Any tips from people with no scales??<br /><br />Thanks!!

				I&#039;m going to point out that before I came to SR, I was under the impression that purchasing a digital scale like that was a major red flag.&nbsp; I mean seriously, who needs to measure in the milligrams except drug dealers and jewelers (who would buy different, higher quality scales)?<br /><br />Nobody here seems to give it a second thought though, so I may well have been totally misinformed.&nbsp; I took the precaution of not ordering any of mine from Amazon, ebay, or anything like that.&nbsp; Just something to consider when you purchase yours.&nbsp; And yes, seriously, buy one.&nbsp; Even one with +/- 5mg accuracy is like, 30 bucks.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be eyeballing stuff for someone else.&nbsp; If you wanna do that for yourself, they&#039;re your eyes and your body, but I&#039;d be fucking pissed as fuck if I bought something from someone and they had eyeballed it.<br />

				(hope this doesn&#039;t raise any red flags, I just need to vent)<br /><br />I don&#039;t usually get upset or angry over what people post on the internet, but when someone asks something like&quot;how do I tell how much drugs i have if i have no scale??&quot;, it makes me want to yell through the screen &quot;BUY A FUCKING SCALE I HAVE OWNED LIKE 30 SCALES SINCE I WAS 13 YEARS OLD THEY ARE SUCH AN INVALUABLE TOOL&quot; they have like so many shapes and sizes of scales it seems like there would be one for every application. Once you own a scale you will find yourself using it for drug and non drug related purposes like weighing hamburger meat or all kinds of shit. <br /><br />I&#039;m definitely not advocating carrying one around with you...just saying that if you do drugs and don&#039;t want to have an unpleasant experience/die, a scale is a must. <br /><br />EDIT:<br />If you have a comment about owning a scale, post it in the SCALES = SAFETY thread I just made (thanks)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=115128.msg779298#msg779298<br /><br />That being said you could just grab some caps and just fill them up (size 4 for example hold around .11-.12 from my experience)................... but if you&#039;re sketched out about about buying a scale, I would be even more sketched out buying &quot;1000 empty geletin capsules&quot;<br /><br />sorry for derailing the thread but I honestly don&#039;t know what to say to people who don&#039;t own scales. <br /><br />It will allow you to leave better feedback for the vendor too... i feel like i could go on all day about the benefits of having a scale(s). <br />
