				So I&#039;ve been curious about psychs for YEARS, and was never able to find any. Now that I&#039;ve found SR, I can finally explore them. I&#039;m going to start with shrooms as I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re a better introduction, then I&#039;ll be trying LSD provided my experience doesn&#039;t completely turn me off by then.<br /><br />So anyway, I&#039;ve been reading dozens of trip reports at work lately to prepare myself and get an idea of what to expect. I&#039;ve come up with a couple of questions that I&#039;d really like to know before I dive in.<br /><br />First off, how does everyone know EXACTLY how much they&#039;re taking? In almost every trip report, the user can say with certainty that they took 2 grams or whatever (LSD is a bit less clear, obviously). For me, I&#039;ll get 7 grams in a package and wonder how to create specific doses. There&#039;s no way people just eye ball it, since I feel like that would be incredibly unreliable. I have a food scale, but it&#039;s only accurate within a gram, so if I wanted to take half an eighth (which I do), there&#039;s no way to tell. I could easily end up overdosing or underdosing. And I find it hard to believe that everyone who tries psychs have accurate scales that measure to the tenths of a gram.<br /><br />My second question is about bad trips. What stops a person from just.. turning one around? I feel like if I was tripping hard, and saw something scary or weird that bothered me, I could just be like.. well this is a mushroom trip so I&#039;ll just enjoy it since it&#039;s not real. Or I&#039;d start envisioning myself on a beach or somewhere happy. Am I looking at it too rationally? It seems like people &#039;forget&#039; that they took a drug and almost always think they&#039;re dying or something crazy. I don&#039;t understand how you can come to a conclusion like that and not just realize you&#039;re tripping balls and to not worry.<br /><br />Lastly, I&#039;m curious about the mental racing people seem to have trouble with. Like there&#039;s a thousand thoughts in your head at once. I&#039;m just hoping someone can describe what that&#039;s like in more detail. What I&#039;m picturing is that crazy shit is happening, and different things are flashing in front of your eyes so fast that you can&#039;t even concentrate on one thing. This is something I would NOT enjoy, and I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s a realistic fear. If I&#039;m having a trip that puts me somewhere else other than my body, I don&#039;t feel like that would be a terrible thing as long as it&#039;s &#039;calm,&#039; as in there&#039;s just one thing going on and I can focus on it. If I&#039;m having different visons and thoughts fly through my head to the point of making me dizzy, I can see where a bad trip would come from.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks in advance for anyone who can answer even one of these.

				Hi Slade17, I thought my first trip through quite well, like you&#039;re doing now, and I think that it is very much a good thing, though most people will tell you it still won&#039;t prepare you, in the sense that you can&#039;t &quot;rationally&quot; expect something, because you&#039;re opening up to the &quot;rationally irrational&quot; or the &quot;super-rational&quot;.<br />first thing i would say is don&#039;t rush into it and make sure you take it at the right time. <br />Secondly, I would really recommend having a good friend with you, and being somewhere super safe where you&#039;re not afraid of anyone interrupting you or acting weird (e.g. a load of annoying drunk people storming in after a party or something).<br />Thirdly, I personally have found mushrooms to be a lot more head-racey than other things, but this is the big one that I personally have to watch out for (any weird or scary visions I can laugh off really easily, but the head-trips can be really exhausting and really stressful).<br /><br />My two cents above all: start with 5-strength salvia divinorum. Here you smoke as much as you can in a pipe or a bong within about 60 seconds, lie down with some really nice good chilled music, and trip for about 5 minutes, and come back around and process it for about half an hour. I really think this is a great introduction to psychedelics which won&#039;t freak you out or put you in a shitty headspace that you have to stay in for hours. It comes on fast and leaves fast, and once you smoke enough in one go, it can show you a vast quantity in about 3 minutes. Lie down. Nice music.<br /><br />There are plenty ways to get out of a bad headspace, but prevention is better than cure, which means safe space and everything prepared that you might need - your favourite music ready on a playlist, nice cushy bed ready, bit of food and water or spliffs rolled, whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />Regarding weights and dosage, maybe buy an electronic scale? depending on what kind of mushrooms you&#039;re buying it would be easier to &quot;eyeball&quot; in that you might just want to eat a few mushrooms, with liberty caps a small handful, that type of thing.<br /><br />Peace and Love

				Thanks for the reply, lots of good information there. I&#039;ve always been uneasy about smoking salvia because of some of the stories I&#039;ve heard about people reliving their entire lives in those 5 minutes, or stuff like that. It seems to be more prone to causing bad experiences, I guess. Mind you, it&#039;s still legal so getting some would not be difficult.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t want to have to buy a scale that costs the same as the shrooms I&#039;m buying. I might go look at some and see what they&#039;re priced like, but I was really hoping there&#039;d be some other way to tell since I really don&#039;t deal with drugs enough to justify buying an accurate scale. I&#039;ll see what they look like when they arrive, though; maybe I can just separate the 1/4 oz into quarters so I have 4 1/16ths instead.

				Yeah you might end up splitting it by eye or something, doubt that a few mg would make a huge difference - go with what you feel is right maybe.<br /><br />i&#039;m going to make a new thread about salvia

				Salvia is a POOR introduction to the world of psychedelics- jarring, uncomfortable, physically strenuous. A hell of a weird time, but very different from the peacefulness and euphoria you&#039;re more likely to get with LSD and shrooms. That being said, those drugs too can induce pervasive anxiety of unspecified length, particularly shrooms. <br /><br />And that&#039;s where the bad trip comes in for people like you, who know themselves and know the type of experience they may confront. Usually not in seeing anything scary or thinking bad thoughts, but in the inexplicable force that, despite your eagerness to accept the experience with openness, just makes you anxious and uncomfortable. You spend the whole anxious part of the trip looking for something, anything to allow you to escape the anxiety and it&#039;s very exhausting. Giving into it is what can put you through hell and back, spiralling deeper into negative thinking until either the drug wears off or the bad effects do. The most important thing to do is know that this too shall pass, there is only a certain amount of time it lasts and do whatever you have to do to keep your chin up and have a good time. I think this is different from the &quot;bad trip&quot; that people who are initially resistant to the psychedelics get, where they confront some serious demons they were never ready to integrate into their selves. <br /><br />With quite large doses of LSD and shrooms, you&#039;re right, it is easy to forget what sober-brained thinking is like and that your current thinking is transcendental and correct. In such cases, the best your sober voice can hope for is that you&#039;re in a safe place, maybe with good-vibin&#039; people you love, and be open to some weird lessons. <br /><br />Generally, creepy images are easy to shake off I find- I just do something to distract me. A few weeks ago I was trying to fall asleep after an acid trip, following some beautiful closed eye visuals, and then they turned into worms and insect limbs for more time than I was comfortable with. 4 am though it may have been, I fired up the tv and zoned out to some Seinfeld. Would&#039;ve liked to sleep, but it wasn&#039;t the will of the acid.

				ok so here is my opinion.<br /><br />forget about salvia now. that&#039;s a bit dissociative anyways. visual but not a pure psychedelic. <br /><br />mushrooms are a great choice!!<br /><br />so.. dosing.<br />its unreliable. potency is all over the place. what i do is&nbsp; test the batch (low dosing) and then estimate a medium dose. <br />you should ask your vendor about specifics. some kind of mushrooms trip you out harder than others. there are many strains. <br />with&nbsp; Cubensis the medium dose is 2-2,5 grams. <br />this is average for the experienced but could be very hard for a beginner. start with 1 gram.. if you like it. next time take 2. <br />smoke cannabis to bring out the visuals. <br /><br />bad trips..<br />yes you can turn&nbsp; them around. But psychedelics are not&nbsp; strictly visual. its a mental thing. <br />these drugs make you batshit crazy. a little adventure to schizo land. so your not gonna be thinking straight. <br />and your mind will be influenced very easily by your surroundings. <br /><br />here is an example: i tripped on acid this week and i was listening to modjo - lady on repeat. a love song. its groovy. i was dancing an feelin good. <br />and then :daft punk: harder better faster stronger comes up (workout song) and it literally made me run out of the house. <br /><br />Trips feel real. Because they are real. you are really crazy. so you cant just shake it off. <br /><br />Dieing...<br />well.... this is something that happens on good and bad trips. psychedelics will make you feel like you are dieing/already dead.<br />You cant get around this one. All you can do is accept it. You have to be ready to die. If you try to fight it that&#039;s gonna land you on bad trip territory. <br />go with the flow. <br /><br />ok .. the mental thing..<br />remember your first day at work? when you went home and you couldn&#039;t sleep because your mind was racing?<br /><br />something like that.<br />and random thoughts pop up. crazy shit. things you wouldn&#039;t think about sober.<br />its like psytrance. you have a basic groove. your mind is clicking on it and all the noise around. those are the thoughts. <br /><br />and you can get into crazy loops. <br />eg:<br />I got a plant in a vase.<br />The soil under the plant is dry. Should i water it? <br />Im gonna stand up to get some water. <br />I filled up a cup with water. <br />I poured the water on the plant. <br />The soil is still dry. <br />Did i water the plant?<br />I&#039;m gonna stand up and go get some water. <br />I pour the water on the plant. <br />The soil is still dry under the plant.<br />Did I pour the water on the floor?<br />No. There is no water on the floor. <br />But the soil is still dry.<br />Where did the water go?<br />I&#039;m gonna try to water the plant again. <br />I fill up the cup with water. <br />I taste it. Yes there is water in the cup. <br />I pour the water on the plant. <br />The soil is still dry.<br /><br /><br />so your gonna go back and fourth back and fourth till you realize that you are stuck in a loop and&nbsp; its dry and you have no clue what the fuck is going on. (the next day your gonna notice that the soil is fuckin wet and there is water all over the floor and on the carpet and you have to clean it up). <br /><br /><br />what i recommend is that you get a chill room, nice lighting. chill music, your favorite stuff something you can loop if you have to. Some xanax in the cupboard to give you a good feelin (so you can abort if you feel like it)<br />food, porn (here is a hint: you can escape bad trips using the power of masturbation!)<br />maybe someone in the next room who can help you out if you need a sitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;turn off your mind, open up your eyes, dilate your pupils, breathe. breathe in the air. Don&#039;t be afraid to care.

Its not so much the visuals its the emotions that can get overwhelming. Just don&#039;t over think it and you will be fine. If you are really worried, I would keep some benzodiazapines on hand just in case (like xanax, or valium).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lastly, I&#039;m curious about the mental racing people seem to have trouble with.

Thoughts are accelerated during a trip sure, but I assure you its like nothing you could possibly imagine, trying to guess what it would be like is kinda pointless because it wont be anything like what you expect. The most difficult thing during a psychedelic trip is typically not the visuals its the emotional roller coaster ride. One moment you can be laughing hysterically and the next moment you could be crying. The best advice I could possibly give you is to just let go, let what happens happen. Remember that it will end, and that you will be alright, that you cannot die no matter how much it feels like it.<br /><br />Ask yourself this, even if all your worst fears came true, how bad could it possibly be. Just go with the flow and whatever you do don&#039;t try and fight the experience. 99.99% of bad trips occur because the tripper is trying to fight the experience, tripping is an exercise in giving up your will and power to influence the situation. Do not try and &quot;control&quot; the trip, it wont work.<br /><br />I suggest you read through erowids experience vaults, and perhaps read some books about tripping to help familiarize yourself with the experience. While I dont particularly like timothy leary, his book &quot;the psychedelic experience&quot; is one of the best &quot;tripping manuals&quot; there are.<br /><br /><br />

				Interesting stuff. I&#039;m definitely going to implement some of the stuff in this topic.<br /><br />The vendor has a sort of guide suggesting how much to take for a light, moderate, strong and WOW trip so that&#039;ll come in handy. I also found a few scales around the 20-30 dollar mark so I&#039;ll probably just pick one up or order one. I&#039;d rather just spend the money and know how much I&#039;m taking.<br /><br />Anway, thanks again to everyone who contributed.
