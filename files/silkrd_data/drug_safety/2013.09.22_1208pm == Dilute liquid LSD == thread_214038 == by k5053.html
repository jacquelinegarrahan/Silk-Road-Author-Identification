				hello!<br />i have some liquid lsd. Obviously it a solution... each drop (made by the dropper that contains it) contains 200ug of lsd... and my intention was to turn down the concentration of acid to 150ug.<br /><br />What do i need??? a syringe with some distilled water?<br />someone has already done? suggestions??<br /><br />N.B: please, spare me comments like &quot;you can&#039;t cut lsd asshole....&quot; etc... cause i&#039;m doing this not for business but just for safety... in my are drops are usually 50ug-100ug ... never more than 120ug so disseminate such a powerful stuff would be DANGEROUS!<br /><br />thanks

				Dilution is simple math. <br />You need a measuring device so a syringe would work.<br />First of all, I need (and you need) to know your volume of liquid LSD <br />I&#039;m going to assume that you have 5mL<br />So if you want a 150 ug/drop solution, you multiply 5mL by the ratio of your original solution to your desired solution.<br /><br />e.g. 5mL*200/150 = 6.6667== 6 2/3 mL<br />The amount of water you must add to achieve such a solution will be 6.6667 mL - 5 mL = 1.6667 = 1 2/3 mL water<br /><br />Therefore, measure out 1 and 2/3 of a mL of distilled water in your syringe, and expell it into your 5mL of 200 ug/drop LSD solution, and voila! You have 6.6667 mL of 150 ug/drop LSD solution.<br /><br />That&#039;s all the math there is behind it.<br />If you can&#039;t figure out the calculations on your own, give me your exact volume so I can calculate it for you.

				thanks mate! i will reproduce your calculation with my quantities... to be sure to not get wrong (maybe didn&#039;t need it, cause i study math at a good level ;)<br /><br />but now i&#039;m sure in how much water adding...<br /><br />now my only doubt is if water is the best adulterant to use...

				Why use water? Bacteria? I would use EtOH (alcohol) think about it, it won&#039;t go bad after a long time of storage.

				i have read in some forum, that alcohol was dangerous for lsd... what do you think? do you mean that 98% alchol used for homemade liquors?<br /><br />if u tell me that using alchool is 100% safe i trus... but please assure me :) <br /><br />thanks for help guys<br />

				I have only seen vendors selling it in EtOH, not one of them in water. My guess is because of bacteria and conservation.

				I suggest diluting it in alcohol. High-proof vodka should do just fine. There is a discussion about it in JoR&#039;s thread.... http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46574.0

				Everclear(95%) is ideal. High proof vodka(50%) will do. If it is already in an alcohol then distilled water is fine, you don&#039;t need much alcohol to prevent bacteria. Just make sure there is NO CHLORINE!<br /><br />Chlorine kills LSD fast and effectively.
