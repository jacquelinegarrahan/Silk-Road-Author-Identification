				hey guys, so most of the time I&#039;ve rolled it&#039;s mainly been pills. It&#039;s just been easier to obtain, and since being on the road for a bit, I&#039;m pretty open to trying a lot of things that previously I would have no access to. The dutch pressed pills really intrigue me however where I live the customs are pretty tight to say the least, and it seem powder would be much easier to import than an already pressed pill. It was mentioned in another thread that by mixing say (meth)amphetamines, dmt, ketamine etc it&#039;ll be almost the same as something I&#039;d import. What have you guys found to be the best? Pure mdma or mixing it with a stimulant? (I&#039;m thinking of replicating something like the partyflock, nintendos, redbull and so on)

				A friend and I was having this conversation recently.<br /><br />I ordered some MDMA powder from a vendor and did some fairly large doses. Even after the large doses, I never got the same feeling I used to with pressed pills. The powder just didn&#039;t quite get me where I wanted to be.<br /><br />If I were to get powder MDMA again, I would ABSOLUTELY add about 75-100mg of methamphetamine to the mix, Hammertime&#039;s meth to be specific. (best meth vendor IMO)<br /><br />Don&#039;t blindly follow my amounts though, I&#039;m just pulling them out of my ass. Do the appropriate research for your own personal dose.<br /><br />But yeah, I would definitely take all my future MDMA with some crystal meth thrown in there. The powder MDMA just didn&#039;t cut it by itself.<br /><br />Maybe try your powder all by itself first, and if that doesn&#039;t cut it, add a little meth when you do your booster.<br /><br />Just my opinion.

				I love molly because I can dose to the T and I have taken so many dirty pills in the past that I just love the clean feelimg it gives me.&nbsp; Plus you can sleep good and feel better the next day.than you would on any normal day.&nbsp; The best thing I have mixed witj molly is shrooms.&nbsp; The euphoria the shrooms gives off goes really good with the mdma buzz.&nbsp; Im thinking the next best thing would be 2ci cuz you can mix it in a capsule.&nbsp;

				I like to take about 125 mg of tan molly and after the first waves insulfate 12-14 mg of 2cb. You will feel like a god and you wont do all the shit to your heart meth does. The 2cb will also let your dick get hard, also increases the empathic response and is a lot safer than the other 2c&#039;s. I recommend POLYGAMUZ molly and 2CB from GREENPEAS (if it is available) or from Nawlins. His product is real good.&nbsp; 2CB is great alone at 25 mg oral. If you snort it adjust lower because it hits hard and quick that way.

				I have mixed practically everything with MDMA. <br /><br />(See my listings)<br /><br />Some of those are experimental but I&#039;ll be making some new ones soon.<br /><br />A MDMA, 2C-B, ketamine roll comes to mind. <br /><br />and maybe a bit of 2C-B or 4-aco-dmt to an existing Jeffrey Roll.<br /><br />Yikes. <br /><br />&nbsp;:o :o

				2CB really puts you in your body and it has visuals very comparable to good LSD. I haven&#039;t raved yet on the mix but I did have a great time dancing in my house to a great mix on soundcloud. This would be a great combo if sex is in your plans as well. It seems like the 2CB has an effect on helping the next day feel smoother from the seretonin squeeze high doses of MDMA give. 200 mg of the tan molly i do from POLY&nbsp; will make you fucking crosseyed ;)&nbsp; :o

				You can still drop the beez, you&#039;ll just have to take more and it&#039;ll take 45 mins or so to come on.<br /><br />Snorting it is my preferred ROI (even though it stings like hell), because you get an almost instantaneous rush if you&#039;ve dropped some Molly a few hours earlier, and for some reason the Molly dulls the not so awesome come-up which is a bonus.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />It&#039;s a good combo.&nbsp; Stay safe and have fun&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;m just throwing in my inevitable recommendation for 5-MeO-MiPT. Go look that shit up, it might be what you&#039;re looking for.<br />Here is what I wrote in another thread:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93417.msg660801#msg660801">Quote from: Ballzinator on December 15, 2012, 12:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5-MeO-MiPT aka &quot;Moxy&quot; is a psychedelic tryptamine invented by Shulgin, with typical dosages ranging from 6-12mg. Duration of effects seven hours. It&#039;s sometimes called the MDMA of the tryptamines because of the emotional opening, increased tactile sensations and erotic feelings it causes. Despite these similarities with MDMA it feels vastly different (at least for me). It gives you a happy, sometimes giggly headspace that can change to loved-up and erotic, given the situation. The body-high is extremely speedy but at the same time much more clean and nice-feeling than cathinones, amphetamines and phenethylamines. It also doesn&#039;t have side-effects like jaw-clenching and the comedown is essentially non-existent but most importantly:<br />No more erectile dysfunction! You just poached that hot chick using MDMA as a confidence-booster? You&#039;ll realize what a no-brainer that was when you&#039;re about to plow her vagina to shreds and you can&#039;t even get your fuck-stick up. You don&#039;t need to worry about that with Moxy. It is amazing for fucking without making you trip like 2C-B does.<br /><br />If you have any questions, just ask me ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Duration of effects seven hours. It&#039;s sometimes called the MDMA of the tryptamines because of the emotional opening, increased tactile sensations and erotic feelings it causes. Despite these similarities with MDMA it feels vastly different (at least for me). It gives you a happy, sometimes giggly headspace that can change to loved-up and erotic, given the situation. The body-high is extremely speedy but at the same time much more clean and nice-feeling than cathinones, amphetamines and phenethylamines. It also doesn&#039;t have side-effects like jaw-clenching and the comedown is essentially non-existent but most importantly:<br />No more erectile dysfunction! You just poached that hot chick using MDMA as a confidence-booster? You&#039;ll realize what a no-brainer that was when you&#039;re about to plow her vagina to shreds and you can&#039;t even get your fuck-stick up. You don&#039;t need to worry about that with Moxy.

				They say if you are takinv shrooms together you are suppose to dose half of wat you normally would.&nbsp; First time I took 100mg of mdma and half an 8th of shrooms.&nbsp; I felt so amazing!&nbsp; My eyes got stuck in the back of my head and my bpdy felt even more sensitive to the touch then just with mdma if thats even possible!&nbsp; The waves of euphoria are more pronounced and I was so satisfied I didnt redose on anything.&nbsp; About 8 hours later when I was trying to sleep it really felt like my head was floating in the clouds.

				i have found that ketamine and acid mix very well with mdma so all 3 at once be ready for some crazy time. mdma makes you feel good so not tense for the LSD and ketamine is like rocket fuel&nbsp; for acid so its a hell of a time. trust me
