				Good (but long) article about MDPV.<br /><br />http://www.pbs.org/newshour/multimedia/bath-salts/<br /><br />(do we really need to warn each other about clearnet links? Who exactly can&#039;t tell the difference?)<br /><br />TL/DR <br /><br />This GIF shows the different effects of drugs on dopamine levels using kitchen sink metaphor. <br />http://i.imgur.com/P4csH.gif<br /><br />&quot;MDPV is irreversible, it won&#039;t let go,&quot; De Felice said. &quot;I don&#039;t know of any other drug that has that same feature of not allowing you to escape from it.&quot;<br /><br />

				MDPV is some nasty shit. from being a coke user for years, I decided to try MDPV out as cheaper alternative. I used 1 G. I was high for five days. I wasn&#039;t able to sleep three days after my last line. My throat was soar as hell, couldn&#039;t swallow a thing for a whole week. A whole month after my use. I still can&#039;t feel the side of my leg and got some numb sensations in my toes. My teeth are sensitive to hot and cold. This shit fucked me up. Stay away from this shit as far as you can.......Your better off snorting battery acid. BEWARE !!! This shit is bad !!!

				wow i didnt realize just how fucked up that particular chem is... <br /><br />this is so sad, these deaths are the direct result of these barbaric drug laws which prevent access to the more thoroughly researched drugs with a decent safety profile... by making amphetamine and cocaine illegal, stimulant users are forced to look for more available options, which are thousands of times more dangerous due to the lack of information about them and no regulation of their production. companies/individuals are able to market these dangerous concoctions because we cannot stop an individuals desire to use drugs, we can only provide the proper resources to obtain and use them in a safe, well informed manner. <br /><br />the long term activation and inability of neurons to replenish their exhausted store of dopamine is without a doubt extremely stressful on the cells - and in many cases, similar situations produce substantial dopaminergic toxicity, potentially causing loss of the neurons <br /><br />in the short term it seems to be causing all sorts of nasty effects, from insomnia to anxiety to hallucinations resembling those of schizophrenia which is very scary...&nbsp; but who knows in the long term, if those neurons are now more susceptible to stress in the future, we MAY see heavy users finding themselves dealing with all sorts of absolutely horrible dopaminergic neurodegenerative conditions which cause people to suffer immensely, including alzheimers or parkinsons... really nasty stuff all caused by stressing the dopamine neurons and losing their function or at the least an increased susceptibility to mental disorders like anxiety, depression and schizophrenia long term from chemical imbalances...

) *DEEP BREATH*<br /><br />It&#039;s also completely acceptable to show the public images of radiolabelled MRI&#039;s of MDMA and non-MDMA users and state that the &#039;dark spot&#039;s&#039; were devoid of serotonin (which they should be !), or were Olsney&#039;s lesions (which they are not).<br /><br />Fuck that German lab in 2002 for publishing a paper using fMRI to prove that in fact MDMA doesn&#039;t substantially reduce functional serotonin levels during intoxication and rebound back to normal serotonin levels within 24 hour&#039;s.&nbsp; Why the nerve of those scientists, they made the original US team have to REDACT that awesome study in 1985 where they were injected monkey&#039;s with meth, claiming it was MDMA.&nbsp; I mean it was the tax payer&#039;s dollars that paid for that study !&quot;&nbsp; &lt;/SARCASM&gt;<br /><br />Ok in reality the DEA can suck my big fat hairy nut sack because they knowingly circumvent their own laws and policies, knowingly distribute already illegal (schedule I) narcotics to their labs (the very first word in the publication they used to present to Congress in this debacle they slanged the &#039;Rave Act&#039; was METHAMPHETAMINE) and then blame &#039;ignorant and wreckless teenager&#039;s&#039; for consuming &#039;untested&#039; (such as MDPV)&#039; compounds when they themselves won&#039;t even test the compounds but rather provide the lab&#039;s they use with already known dangerous narcotics whose names &#039;look&#039; close enough to the drug name to any congressman (who aren&#039;t scientist&#039;s, to them Methamphetamine = Methylenedioxymethamphetamine just because the DEA told them so).&nbsp; Thanks a lot DEA for protecting the public&#039;s interest by locking up countless harmless people in prison and making the tax payer&#039;s pay over $100k a year to house/feed/clothe these dangerous drug addicted maniac&#039;s in prison.&nbsp; Sometimes I think the USA just likes building new prison&#039;s for fun.<br /><br />Let&#039;s protect the public by NOT studying all the phenethylamine analogs until they&#039;ve become mainstream and present their dangers to the drug crazed public, so that we can lock up these dangerous drug crazed felon&#039;s who&#039;ve not been presented with any evidence by the body that claims to protect their interest&#039;s against harmful compounds (DEA) until long after it&#039;s too late to do so.&nbsp; Seems like a perfectly tangible and credible means of doing your job and making the tax payer&#039;s pay your salaries for doing such a wonderfully inept job at it.<br /><br />FUCK, it makes me want to punch a kitten in the face !!! Except I love kittens and would never do that.<br /><br />Ok rant over, don&#039;t do MDPV though, or you might end up sounding like me.

				Why are people giving this PBS special so much attention? That kitchen sink metaphor makes no fucking sense at all. It&#039;s not how the brain works and just so you guys know reuptake inhibition is how MANY drugs work, MDMA being a popular one.&nbsp; This article also cites no sources whatsoever. <br /><br />Your brain isn&#039;t going to fill up with dopamine until you explode and its very typical the DEA is funding this &quot;study&quot;. &quot;Scared of coke? Good! Now that we set the bar there why not keep going higher!&quot;

				flicky, i think you missed the point that mdpv doesnt follow the standard re-uptake drug pharmacokinetics.&nbsp; instead of the common receptor binding profiles it seems to hold much more tightly and continues to effect the cells much longer than any other drugs of a similar mechanism <br /><br />and mdma doesnt act to prevent re-uptake as you seem to be suggesting, its very different than the mechanism of strict re-uptake inhibitor like cocaine. in addition to re-uptake inhibition - it targets the intracellular monoamine vesicular transporter, which loads vesicles with monoamine neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, norep, and actually causes them to run in reverse. by dumping the contents of the vesicles into the cell, the intracellular concentration is increased which forces the monoamines across the cell membrane into the synapse<br /><br />that is what they referred to as turning up the faucet... and the sink would be the synapse. (although mdpv may cause release through another mechanism cause i am not familiar with its exact pharmacology) and then the re-uptake transporter inhibition (like cocaine) was like plugging the drain. <br /><br />i thought it was a fairly good analogy for people who do not have a knowledge of neuropharmacology.&nbsp; can you please explain why you disagree using the actual mechanisms you are referencing?&nbsp;

Since your body is not recycling it wouldn&#039;t long term users develop symptoms very close to Parkinson&#039;s disease, although I&#039;ve never heard of a single case of this. Also this &quot;drain&quot; analogy suggests that the dopamine ONLY fate is to be transported back into the axon. There are enzymes in the brain that will degrade dopamine and other monocyte derivatives that will also work to break them down. Your body isn&#039;t just going to have an &quot;over flowing&quot; sink for the rest of your life.<br /><br />In addition, I&#039;m aware MDMA causes more effects than just inhibiting re-uptake but the artcle is trying to make it seem like inhibiting re-uptake and causing excess release of a transmitter is very very bad. Well, thats just about what MDMA does and we prescribe plenty of medication to people for EVERYDAY use based on this theory. I&#039;m of course talking about SSRI&#039;s like Prozac and Lexapro. <br /><br />Also this entire stupid story is being told like its some horrible drama of a kid who took MDPV and then shot himself, he didn&#039;t even OD on it and the article mentions no statistics of people having OD&#039;s on this drug. <br /><br />Also in the video the scientist is explaining the negative effects and he notes that he EXPECTS to see them in the mice. They haven&#039;t even run the study yet but the DEA is sure to let everyone know that these thing are very bad. I can seem to think of plenty of studies under the supervision of the DEA that turned out to be complete bullshit and the lack of findings and sources for this one makes me just want to chalk it up with the rest of that list.

				i see, you were basically talking about something completely different then i was trying to comment on.<br /><br />you are definitely correct there are multiple more mechanisms than just pre-synaptic reuptake... although it is the main one, you even have the surrounding glial cells taking MA back up as well, but mdpv could potentially effect them as well. the analogy has to be oversimplified to try to get the biggest point across to people without any previous knowledge.<br /><br />if you read my first post i was just commenting mainly on how the drug seems to &quot;reportedly&quot; effect individuals for days. i thought it was interesting, but i didnt give much time to actually reading the article or even meaning to comment on the articles legitimacy.&nbsp; <br /><br />i was just conjecturing on my knowledge of other stimulants what could &quot;possibly&quot; be occurring. should mdpv actually be holding onto the receptor so tightly or even more crazy - if it is covalently linking to a transporter, it is fascinating to me because of how rare and unusual that is... most receptor binding is a reversible and forms an equilibrium, but it would be awesome if mdpv breaks those rules<br /><br />and if it does then stress may likely be occurring to those neurons. but in the first post i used words like MAY and my entire point was not actually on the safety of mdpv but the lack of information actually makes it dangerous just because we dont know.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />you seem to be commenting on how they are trying to scare people from drugs, like cocaine and i was saying cocaine and amphetamine are safer than mdpv because we know more about them (especially pharms with the production being regulated). i think its fucked people turn to using these &quot;potentially&quot; dangerous RCs because they cant obtain the better researched drugs.

) *DEEP BREATH*<br /><br />It&#039;s also completely acceptable to show the public images of radiolabelled MRI&#039;s of MDMA and non-MDMA users and state that the &#039;dark spot&#039;s&#039; were devoid of serotonin (which they should be !), or were Olsney&#039;s lesions (which they are not).<br /><br />Fuck that German lab in 2002 for publishing a paper using fMRI to prove that in fact MDMA doesn&#039;t substantially reduce functional serotonin levels during intoxication and rebound back to normal serotonin levels within 24 hour&#039;s.&nbsp; Why the nerve of those scientists, they made the original US team have to REDACT that awesome study in 1985 where they were injected monkey&#039;s with meth, claiming it was MDMA.&nbsp; I mean it was the tax payer&#039;s dollars that paid for that study !&quot;&nbsp; &lt;/SARCASM&gt;<br /><br />Ok in reality the DEA can suck my big fat hairy nut sack because they knowingly circumvent their own laws and policies, knowingly distribute already illegal (schedule I) narcotics to their labs (the very first word in the publication they used to present to Congress in this debacle they slanged the &#039;Rave Act&#039; was METHAMPHETAMINE) and then blame &#039;ignorant and wreckless teenager&#039;s&#039; for consuming &#039;untested&#039; (such as MDPV)&#039; compounds when they themselves won&#039;t even test the compounds but rather provide the lab&#039;s they use with already known dangerous narcotics whose names &#039;look&#039; close enough to the drug name to any congressman (who aren&#039;t scientist&#039;s, to them Methamphetamine = Methylenedioxymethamphetamine just because the DEA told them so).&nbsp; Thanks a lot DEA for protecting the public&#039;s interest by locking up countless harmless people in prison and making the tax payer&#039;s pay over $100k a year to house/feed/clothe these dangerous drug addicted maniac&#039;s in prison.&nbsp; Sometimes I think the USA just likes building new prison&#039;s for fun.<br /><br />Let&#039;s protect the public by NOT studying all the phenethylamine analogs until they&#039;ve become mainstream and present their dangers to the drug crazed public, so that we can lock up these dangerous drug crazed felon&#039;s who&#039;ve not been presented with any evidence by the body that claims to protect their interest&#039;s against harmful compounds (DEA) until long after it&#039;s too late to do so.&nbsp; Seems like a perfectly tangible and credible means of doing your job and making the tax payer&#039;s pay your salaries for doing such a wonderfully inept job at it.<br /><br />FUCK, it makes me want to punch a kitten in the face !!! Except I love kittens and would never do that.<br /><br />Ok rant over, don&#039;t do MDPV though, or you might end up sounding like me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol shit like this is why I like being on this forum. +1 mate.

I don&#039;t doubt for a second that MDPV could be dangerous I just think this article provides absolutely nothing to the scientific community and is only geared to scare people. I also don&#039;t understand how these types of scientists could be so uninspired when they conduct studies like these. As you pointed out, if this drug has unusual effects it would be fascinating and could further aid in our understanding of the human brain. All these people seem to care about is showing that it&#039;s bad.

They are claiming that MDPV does exactly what MDMA does only with different neuron transmitters and receptor sites.

				@TheBusiness <br /><br />The funny thing is, I&#039;ve never even tried MDPV or mephadrone. I don&#039;t even like stimulants other than normal amphetamine. I&#039;m just being skeptical is all, I&#039;ll have to thumb through some more articles but due to how new it is I doubt I&#039;ll see any sort of biochemical evidence. <br /><br />@Limitless, well chemically they are very similar the only difference is the secondary carbon near the benzene ring is double bonded to an Oxygen in Cathinones and isn&#039;t in amphetamine. I wish I could answer your question biochemically though but I can&#039;t. I have a long way to go in my field of research.
