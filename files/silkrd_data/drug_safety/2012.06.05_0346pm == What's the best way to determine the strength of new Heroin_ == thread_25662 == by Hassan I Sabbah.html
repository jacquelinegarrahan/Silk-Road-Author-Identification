				Been shooting for 25 years now...but after a few years of sobriety and methadone maintenance getting back into it.It sure takes the edge off of Meth.&nbsp; I am expecting some very good H from NoGenXRx very soon and I don&#039;t want to waste one mg. Should I snort it? Or just do a good size fix? (I have a high tolerance). Or is this just completely relative based on weight/medications/ROI/ etc..etc.. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!!<br /><br />Keep on Rockin&#039; in the Free World.

				Matchhead snort for #4 and wait 30min or a couple of runs on foil for #3... <br /><br />In my experience going straight for the needle is bad move, if you are going to shoot, cook half the amount up.. You can always re-dose (as long as your veins ain&#039;t fucked!)

On the basis of the appearance of a pill (including diameter, thickness, color and logo) and an acid test to see whether the pill prevents the recognition list. This list includes pills in the past period several times in the laboratory were analyzed. The list is updated weekly. If your pill on this list, you get to hear the results. That is to say, which substance (s) is in it, and how much. If the pill is not recognized, you can use the pill to be sent to the laboratory.<br /><br />Powders, capsules and liquids<br />In order to determine exactly which substances are present in it and in what quantities, these drugs always forwarded to the laboratory. For powders and capsules there is an immediate acid test is done to get an indication to what means it goes. Of powders, we have a little less than 1/10 gram (80 mg) are required for analysis in the laboratory.<br /><br />The results<br />after a week you can call for the results. You get the full laboratory results. For some drugs (GHB and LSD) takes longer (2 to 4 weeks).<br /><br />Conditions for testing<br />at the test and recreational drugs information center will also give details about the various (entertainment) drugs.<br />You can get tested resources such as ecstasy, cocaine, speed, GHB, LSD. The following resources can not be tested: mushrooms, drugs, hashish and marijuana, steroids and raw materials for drugs.<br /><br />We test only for consumers. We did not test for dealers, parents or police.<br />You remain anonymous, we note only information about means, not about individuals.<br />You may up to three times per drug samples tested.<br />For powders, a maximum of 1 g and 10 ml for liquids. If you exceed the above quantities with you, we test not for you.<br />We test any ingredients that can be used for drug production.<br />The test result can not legally binding.<br />The tester, the participating organization and the laboratory can not be held liable for the consequences of the use of any drug.<br /><br />Self-testing<br />in smart shops and via the Internet, self-testing (eg EZ Test and Dope Test on sale). In these tests, it is a color test, based on the Marquis-test. It is not possible on the basis of this test a reliable judgment on the contents of a pill. The color reaction is merely an indication of the content and gives no information about the amount of a substance.<br />The great danger of a self-test is that the test has a false appearance of certainty can give.<br /><br />Pills that higher amounts of substances to give a self often confusing or misleading results. This danger exists especially with pills next to a XTC-like substance (MDMA, MDEA, MDA) another undesirable substance. Examples of such substances from the past, strychnine (rat poison) and PMA.<br /><br />The only way to the actual content of a pill to find out, it is tested at an official testing services on this site. These testing services also use the Marquis test, but only as an indication. In a testing service allows you to get complete results on the contents of a pill (or another drug).<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;wasta say&#039;s;&quot;&quot;<br />&nbsp;I live in the range of 20 miles from such a point and I am willing to help.<br />Everything for your safety !&quot;&quot;<br /><br />You can go there by yourself too.<br />This is the address;<br />Test Service Drug<br />Drug use is not without risks. You can see on the outside can not see what a drug is and what strength. Addicts Northern Netherlands has a testing and information point. Users of recreational drugs, these resources (both pills, powders and liquids) tested. In the Netherlands there are several places a testing service or a drop-off point.

				A lot is going to depend on what your meth maintenance dose is.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the meth is going to counteract the H, so in order to get a decent rush/buzz from the H, you may need more than you would normally.&nbsp; The higher your meth dose the more H you are going to need before you feel anything.<br /><br />Someone doing 35mg of meth a day is going to need around 50-100mg of H if they want to get a nice buzz.&nbsp; But I wouldn&#039;t start with more than 50mg for your first H dose.&nbsp; &nbsp;Wait at least 30 minutes before trying anymore.<br /><br />Also, I would try and do the H at least 12 hours after you have taking your meth.
