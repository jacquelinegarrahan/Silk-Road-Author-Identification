				I&#039;m on day 3 now no sleep or food. At what point does it start to get really unhealthy and dangerous. I&#039;ve heard 7 days from some, 10 from others. I&#039;m not going for the record but it&#039;s weird how the days and nights just creep on by without noticing. I can see why this shit ruins lives now.<br /><br />&nbsp;Funny thing is I thought this was the first time I was trying Meth..ha! This shit reminds of way back when long time ago snorting coke and dropping pills same fucking feeling with all the sketch and tweaking after. Any advice is appreciated though cause I think I may be underestimating this drug. I&#039;ve been addicted to vikes before and it was a bit hard to stop but I think Meth if you become addicted is way harder. It&#039;s like a big mind fuck game when you finish the last snort, smoke, or IV(pls dont IV it) then you get like this command in your head &#039;You shall go forth and get more meth!&#039; lol.. idk I&#039;m was hoping to crash tonight but couldn&#039;t resist if I get to Day 4 then ppl will for sure be start asking questions. Any tips from meth users how to set a cut off time and then end it even if you have more? Is that just self control? I&#039;m not a weak person but I can get addicted to shit but with this if it&#039;s there I have to do it. It really has potential to be a great drug but where a drug like Oxy may just want your soul Meth wants all of you. Fuck w/e you guys are going to read this and be like what a noob tweaker..buauhaha...peace!

				Im no authority on the topic, but any amount of consecutive days is terrible for your body.. i think that like 10 days or more, and your basically only alive from the meth , lol..<br /><br />but seriously , maybe you should put the pipe down some time soon..3 days is w.e..but that can easily turn to 6 to 9 to hosptial, ya know.

				Longest I ever went without any sleep at all was 8 days.&nbsp; It was... an odd experience.&nbsp; Was a bad time in my life; relationship was ending, etc., so I was pushing myself pretty hard.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been taking stimulants and skipping sleep for years, and I tell you with full confidence: anything over 36-48 hours is too much.<br /><br />Don&#039;t misunderstand me.&nbsp; I still hit 50-60 hours awake once every week or two, but skipping more than one night of sleep is not good.&nbsp; Pay attention: you can really feel yourself deteriorate exponentially after that first night.<br /><br />... I think it&#039;s been about 30 hours right now.&nbsp; Give or take.&nbsp; Honestly, I don&#039;t actually count anymore.&nbsp; Just kinda... try to remember when I woke up and do the math.&nbsp; It is not a lifestyle that I recommend.

Like yesterday I thought it was Thursday and I feel like today should be Friday. I did crash last finally like around 6am so I think that was like 70 hours or something? Not a good look at all but know better for next time I guess.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Using meth like you are is not good...

I can handle it! lol.. no but for real I think I&#039;m good cause I still had this pile of meth on my nightstand from last night and first thing I did when I got up was eat a huge breakfast and not even tempted to use that today. But the real test comes at night, haha... but on a side note now that I think of it, is there a good way to use meth as opposed to a bad way? lol.. That&#039;s funny shit. Well no you kinda right some people will just go fucking nuts and turn into zombies doing it every waking hour and some do a few bumps at the club. The mind fuck of it is don&#039;t think one or the other is better because no one knows if that person who does their first bump at a club will turn into a meth zombie. <br /><br />When I partied I meet a lot of people and I always tried to figure out why one person would get so hooked on a drug and another could just stop it anytime just so I could maybe stop myself. It was weird shit, I never came to a good answer. Like here&#039;s a example some people will say if you have good self control and self discipline than you can just be a casual user. People that work out seriously I would say have extreme self control and discipline but I&#039;d always be amazed that these hugo mofos at the club once they first started using that was it. Everything else didn&#039;t matter. Quite an anomaly.<br /><br />&nbsp;I just came to the conclusion that there&#039;s two many variables in every persons life that affects whether someone gets addicted or not. Like mental health, emotional maturity, financial situations, outlook, just way so many so it&#039;s almost impossible to answer why someone gets addicted to a drug and another doesn&#039;t. The simplistic answer would be well the drug fills some need in your life that isn&#039;t being met. Umm no you like it cause it makes you fucking high and your happy! lol.. but the former answer has some truth to it. People that had more rewarding and worthwhile things in their lives seemed to be less prone to get addicted to drugs as opposed to be others with less worthwhile things in their life being more suspectible.
