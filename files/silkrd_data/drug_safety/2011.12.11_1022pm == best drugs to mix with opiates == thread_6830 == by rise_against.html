				most people know drinking alcohol with opiates intensifies the effects, but what other drugs are fun to mix with opiates such as hydrocodone or oxycodone?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Really I hate alcohol and opiates, but that being said to answer your question. May I recommend this a line of heroin and a line of coke both about the same size. Thats a warm feeling and makes the coke jitters coming down better and you don&#039;t feel like you gotta do another line of coke every 20 minutes.

				All CNS depressants synergize with opiates to combine the effects making one more intoxicated... and overdose much more likely. Obviously any drug that increases dopamine release will intensify the pleasurable effects as well. <br /><br />The true gems with opiates however are the potentiating compounds. These actually serve to intensify the effects pharmacologically, rather than just blending the effects together... it is like the difference between 3+3=6 and 3x3=9, where the mechanisms of the drug are actually interacting and producing an enhanced experience. Therefore, you will achieve the same subjective high while less of the opiate is required (2x3=6). This can be dangerous for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Potentiating chemicals include first generation anti-histamines like promethazine and hydroxyzine among many others, H-2 antagonist cimetidine, alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptor agonist clonidine, anti-cholinergics like hyoscamine and dicyclomine, drug efflux pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, other opioids such as loperamide, and catabolic enzyme inhibitors such as compounds in grapefruit juice. Plenty of others I am sure I am forgetting... like DXM, naproxen and quinine. A high fat meal has also been reported to increase bioavailability. Depending on the class of opioid ingested some potentiators have varying effect fyi.<br /><br />Oh and the best one, some good herb! of course...<br /><br />

				i would say weed only and the potentiating compounds mentioned by microRNA. opiates with coke is how jim belushi died(and many other comedians). mixing extreme uppers and downers like coke and heroin will cause tachychardia, or arythmia, which can then lead to cardiac arrest and death

				marsvolta12 gave some great advice, the combination of stimulants and depressants is extremely stressful on the heart and is extremely dangerous. I found a link to fairly decent site on some info about certain potientating compounds if anyone is interested:<br /><br />http://opioids.com/opiates/index.html

				Assuming you are asking for the best (most pleasurable) and not the safest....<br /><br />IV speedball. 60% heroin or opiate of choice, 40% quality cocaine, that will dissolve in water pretty much without stirring. <br /><br />If you can argue with that, you&#039;ve probably never done it.

				At the time when I was limited in supplies I tried (2) Vicodin ES pills along with the 2Mgs of Xanax and that was rocking.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve got more things to mix together,I&#039;d try the Cocaine/H mixture, but since I&#039;m a novice/noob in that respect I&#039;d defer to others experiences and does recommendations.

				i try not to directly mix anything together anymore.&nbsp; but i find opiates the ultimate &quot;nightcap&quot; after doing intense and wearing substances, like stims, MDMA, or psychedelia.&nbsp; one of my best nights ever was having 3.5 g of good coke and a half G of good H and about 5 good friends.&nbsp; we did half the coke, then half the H as we came down off the coke.&nbsp; slept like babies.&nbsp; next day..&nbsp; did the other half of coke and then the rest of it.&nbsp; They transitioned so smoothly into each other...&nbsp; <br /><br />cannabis always seems to cancel the effects of opiates for me, even strong stuff.&nbsp; so that&#039;s my ultimate ultimate nightcap, and it brings back an opiate buzz for me too!<br /><br />*destiny*

I&#039;m just adding a note on the &quot;high fat meal.&quot; It doesn&#039;t even have to be a meal. It could be a large glass of milk. The purpose is that it gets your liver working and spikes plasma levels in the blood. Therefore when the opiate is taken, the bio-availability is highly increased.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br />

				On Friday nights when I have nothing to do the next day, I take this cocktail and feel pretty freakin&#039; deakin&#039; good (I do it in this order too without about 20 mins in between dosing to make sure I don&#039;t get ahead of myself):<br /><br />-Two 50 mgs gelcaps of Vistaril<br />-Your desired dose of your favorite opiate (I use around 25 mgs of oxies or a few bumps of h)<br />-Smoke a bowl of dank<br />-Take a small dose of shrooms (two grams or less). Not a full blown trip, but enough to cause euphoria and some cool, light visiauls. It complements the warmth of the opiates quite nicely.<br /><br />I&#039;m flying really high for around three hours. The comedown is really nice too. I take an MAOI though, so keep in mind that you might need a higher dose of opiates/shrooms to get the desired effects.
