				So I want to use xanax long term, I heard that you can very easily build up a tolerance to it and then end up getting the same kick out of 4MG that you used to out of 1 or 2.<br /><br />I just started using it and have for the past week been doing about 1-2MG a day.<br /><br />Is there any way I can take &quot;drug vacations&quot; maybe once a month for a week or go like 2 weeks on and then a week off? <br /><br />I do not want to become dependent on it to the point where I have built my tolerance up to having to take 4 or 5MG a day. <br /><br />So basically, how can I use it for the long term but safely for the long term so my tolerance stays low and I do not become dependent?

				I agree with everything Vanquish said. There is no possible way to safely use xanax &quot;long term&quot; without building severe physical dependence.<br />Your options are.<br />1) Use Xanax ONLY when you are anxious to the point where you simply cannot function. Using it sporadically will help you avoid building any sort of dependence. However, self control is quite difficult with a drug like xanax, and I doubt that you would be able to use it infrequently.<br />2) Explore safer options for anxiety treatment like the drugs suggested by vanquish<br />3) Learn how to deal with anxiety without drugs. See a psychologist if you have to.<br />Xanax works great in the short term, but if you push it too far you can end up living a pretty miserable existence. It&#039;s just not worth it.

				It also depends on how frequently you need it. <br /><br />If you need it on a daily basis to cope, that is very unfortunate because tolerance will eventually build and you will need ever increasing doses to achieve the same effect. With xanax is is not -that- bad though, as tolerance to its anxiolytic effects builds up relatively slowly. Over a timeframe of years it certainly will, though.<br /><br />If you need it only once a week or so the risk of tolerance/dependence is significantly lower, and you may be able to&nbsp; use it for a long time to deal with whatever situation you need it for. <br /><br />I am perfectly aware of how much relieve it can provide though, and can see why you want that effect to last forever. Sadly it rarely does, unless you only need it on rare occasions. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m with those saying there is no safe predictable long-term benzo use. I only dabble with them nowadays, but I&#039;ve gone thru 3 1000 10mg Valium pharmacy pill bottles. Took those little blue fuckers for months, obviously. Eventually was trading them straight across to stupid kids for Ecstasy tablets that I could either eat to get high or sell to put gas in my wheels and keep living the life of a boss player. Also had an earlier binge of hundreds of 10mg diazepams in my late teens that required hospitalization &amp; LE intervention, screaming threats at the cops in front of my then gf and my poor mother. I still remember driving into a dumpster thinking I was going to miss it by half the parking lot and watching slow-motion as I plowed into it, and the &quot;bang, bang, bang&quot; as it thundered from the impact.<br /><br />Moderation or occasional use is probably the only way, unless you&#039;re on some serious grown man shit and just chip/dabble.

				I&#039;ve always just bought 50-100mg of xanax, and once its gone I take a break for a couple weeks to let my tolerance recover<br /><br />tbh I&#039;ve never experienced any withdrawals from benzo&#039;s but I&#039;ve only taken 50-100mg max before taking a break

				As mentioned you should be very very careful when driving when using benzodiazepines, especially if you have little or no tolerance to them. If someone with no experience at all would take 2 mg xanax and attempted to drive, that would be rather dangerous - probably more so than having 3 beers (if you are used to drinking alcohol) and driving off. <br /><br />Even as an experienced user of moderate doses i do notice some effect: a bit slower reaction time (to be expected), but also more subtle things like seeing other road users later. This obviously has its dangers, and they would be greatest when driving into unknown territory where you do not know where the threats usually come from. <br /><br />This is a bit of a side discussion, but i think its worth thinking about when considering using benzo&#039;s on a regular basis, since that would probably also involve driving under their influence.

				To reiterate most of the posts above, particularly Vanquish&#039;s warning, there isn&#039;t really a &quot;safe&quot; way to use Xanax or any benzo on a long term basis (whether it be for medicinal or recreational purposes). It is unfortunate, because they are incredibly effective and efficient medications. They certainly work quickly to relieve worry, stress, and societal inhibition. Keep in mind, the most effective medications for pain are opiates and for ADD/ADHD/narcolepsy are stimulants. The simplest drugs carry the highest rates of success, addiction, and abuse.<br /><br />If you begin a long-term benzo regimen, you will undoubtedly build a tolerance and eventually suffer physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if/when you run out of pills. I have been on and off Xanax for over 6 years. Currently, I take Xanax multiple times a day.&nbsp; I am prescribed for a DSM verified anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. I have been on Xanax and other benzos for 2 straight years at present. Within just 48 hours after my last dose, I start to experience an ungodly amount of discomfort, twitching, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and general &quot;jonesing&quot; that only gets worse every day. I&#039;ve never made it past day 4.<br /><br />As an avid psycho-pharmacological researcher and benzo user, I have read studies showing that only two substances have list &quot;death&quot; as a direct outcome of immediate cessation. They are alcohol and benzos. They manipulate the amount of GABA in the brain causing CNS depression (among other things) and have similar rebound effects following a &quot;cold turkey&quot; approach. <br /><br />One doctor described a story to me of a young woman who was taking upwards of 16mg per day. She was taking a 30 day script in barely a week, ran out of money and pills, went into severe withdrawal, and began seizing within 24 hours. She was one of the lucky few able to receive treatment, and she made it out alive and straight into rehab.<br /><br />Follow the advice of the others on this thread. I urge you not to end up in my position or worse, but rather seek alternatives to Xanax such as other medications or therapies.

I take 4mg of Suboxone (1/2 strip) once a day and have been opiate free for around 6 months give or take a bit. Benzos I have used previously to help with opiate withdrawal and they are so powerful they basically helped me sleep away the pain before I had the ability to start taking Subs. Benzos are extremely addicting. I took them for just 8 days in a row and more than doubled my tolerance. I had mild withdrawal to them when i stopped but i was&nbsp; kind of depressed for about 2 days and that&#039;s with me taking my Suboxone. I could not imagine how severe this would have been if i was taking them for 2 months or a year you know. I still take them but I&#039;m careful. I take them a couple times a week at most and stay off of them on my work days. Sometimes not even at all in a week. Speaking from someone familiar with addiction unfortunately too well I just recommend you tread lightly. I wish I had listened to those that warned me years ago but i was too young and too stupid. Good luck to you.

				You&#039;re getting better advice here than you will get from your average physician.&nbsp; Word to the wise.<br /><br />Yeah Xanax should always be abused, never used.&nbsp; A wise fellow once described it as &quot;powdered alcohol.&quot;&nbsp; Without the hangover!&nbsp; We live in a beautiful world.&nbsp; We just have to keep our eyes open.<br /><br />With regard to social anxiety, c&#039;mon man.&nbsp; Get an analyst.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; It&#039;s the best money you will ever spend.&nbsp; Look at him or her as a life coach.&nbsp; It&#039;s the best thing I ever did.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only drug you should consider for social anxiety is MDMA, taken in moderation, with a patient and loving teacher.&nbsp;

				Well, the &#039;powdered alcohol&#039; analogy isn&#039;t that far off really in certain regards. It surely reduces anxiety in much the same way that alcohol does. But it does stop about there. <br /><br />If you take enough alcohol to mitigate moderate social anxiety, you&#039;ll probably need to drink quite a bit of it. Not directly dangerous amount, but 1 mg of xanax would probably equate a liter of beer or so for the otherwise moderate drinker. <br /><br />Drinking a liter of beer will result in &#039;side effects&#039; that are much worse compared to taking 1 or even 2 mg of xanax. Both will reduce your reaction speed, but you&#039;ll do a lot worse on the beer. Also, you are probably notable affected by the alcohol, and its not something you could acceptably drink in the morning before a workday. <br /><br />Also, xanax does not trigger breathalyzers when you are driving, though you should be aware that driving while using xanax is actually dangerous, and can end very badly especially if you are not tolerant to it at all.

				xanax is withrawal is no fun. I was taking 1 mg a nite for 3 months and i quit and the WD&#039;s were terrible, even tho i was only taking 1 mg a day. For me it was worse than heroin withdrawal. you might not get terrible chills but benzo WD gave me bad stomach cramps and the worst anxiety and depression in the world. I wasnt able to talk to anybody for a week and whenever i tried to talk or sit still my body would shake terribly, kinda like the RLS from opiate withdrawal but alot worse

				I know I made this thread a long time ago, but I have managed to stay off the xanax other than once every 4-5 days. Maybe it is the batch I got, or maybe it is just me but these things put me on the couch, that is mostly why I take them. Compared to alchohol they are the same for me, alchohol does not make me crazy social it just allows me not give a fuck and get rid of the stress from the day. I sleep like a rock on both of them, I use both generally at the end of a long day and end up enjoying myself until I wake up the next morning. I use amphetamines to get rid of my anxiety, then xanax as I comedown at night. <br /><br />What does what I explained (easily amused, satisfied, cozy, clears the mind, by just sitting and watching TV or something) but is not as harmful as alchohol or benzos? I have phenibut but have yet to use it and am waiting for my kratom that is taking forever to get here.

				I&#039;m not saying this is standard, but you should consider biting the bullet and taking psychedelics.<br /><br />Psychedelics can help you find the root cause of your suffering, and they give you a special time where you are able to change the deep things. It takes a strong intentional effort, though for them to work as therapy. I also like what Henry said about the MDMA. If you want to fix the problem rather than medicate it... psychedelics/MDMA are intense and direct<br /><br />They don&#039;t always work, because it depends on the leadup and the sincereness of intentions you have about the experience... like foreplay. But when they work, man they work.

				I think the main conclusion is that either being on or withdrawing from large amounts of xanax adversely effects your typing skills ;)<br /><br />Kidding aside, you should be aware that is is very important to reduce your benzo intake gradually, regardless of which exact substance you have been on. Kicking a benzo habit is by no means impossible, if you do try to do that cold turkey you are probably in for a very nasty period that can last weeks or months... so do not attempt it. Try to figure a schedule that slowly reduces your consumption without triggering paradoxical reactions.
