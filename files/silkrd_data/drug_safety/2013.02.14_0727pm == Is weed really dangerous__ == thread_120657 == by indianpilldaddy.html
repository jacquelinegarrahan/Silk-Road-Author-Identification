				Why do people say that weed is dangerous when there are no recorded deaths for smoking weed?? I have heard people say that it can cause cancer and other health problems. If that is so then why is medical marijuana available and legal??

				unfortunately, misinformation is all too common when it comes to drugs, especially cannabis and psychedelics it seems... people just don&#039;t understand them and are quick to jump to conclusions. humans tend to fear the unknown, so i guess it makes sense.

You get all kinds of nasty tar and carcinogens in your lungs and that&#039;s just not healthy.<br /><br />The only dangers of cannabinoids are psychological. THC can induce symptoms of psychosis and CBD, the second main active chemical is proven to be an antipsychotic. Many modern strains of marijuana are grown with optimization of THC content in mind and CBD is completely ignored. That&#039;s why weed newbies are more likely to freak out on the newest Haze strain with 25% THC and 0.25 % CBD than on a good old Afghani with a healthy CBD content.<br /><br />The reason it&#039;s used medicinally is that the benefits outweigh the dangers in many cases. Nobody&#039;s saying it&#039;s completely safe. It has it&#039;s side effects just like any other medication.

				Ballzinator is on the money here. Smoking is the damage causer not the drug. I vape weed on the occasions that I do use it anymore which helps reduce, but of course doesn&#039;t eliminate, the dangers of inhaling the weed. <br /><br /><br />

				There is significant evidence that marijuana is carcinogenic, however exactly how much so is a matter of debate. There have been studies showing that marijuana smokers are at increased risk of lung cancer, cigarette smokers are well established as having a much higher risk of lung cancer, but smokers of marijuana and cigarettes have a lower risk of lung cancer than smokers of only cigarettes. Marijuana may have some cancer inhibitory effect as well as being carcinogenic, I have not seen any conclusive evidence as to why users of marijuana and cigarettes are at lower risk of lung cancer than users of only cigarettes. Additionally most marijuana smokers also are cigarette smokers. There was a study saying that marijuana use in childhood leads to lowered IQ through adulthood, but there was another researcher who pointed out flaws in this study so it is not really conclusive. There is strong evidence that marijuana can trigger latent psychological disorders in those who are susceptible, much like pretty much all psychedelics. Marijuana can lead to panic attacks as well, and panic attacks are imo the most negative effect most users are likely to experience. Overall marijuana is quite a safe drug, if you eat it or vaporize it or even use a water pipe of some sort you can eliminate or greatly reduce the increased risk of cancer. This leaves you with the risk of triggering a latent psychological disorder, but if you do not have a family history of mental disorders the risk of this happening is quite small. You could possibly become mentally dependent on marijuana, I have seen this happen to a few people but they are few and far between. There is some risk that you could become demotivated as well, but this is also not particularly common in my experience, I know a lot of highly accomplished marijuana smokers. <br /><br />So in summary:<br /><br />A. You could increase your risk of cancer, but this can be eliminated or greatly reduced depending on the way you consume marijuana. Also, it is apparently safer to smoke marijuana and cigarettes than to smoke only cigarettes.<br /><br />B. You could trigger a latent psychological disorder, schizophrenia is of particular concern. The chances of this happening if you don&#039;t have a family history of mental illness are quite small.<br /><br />C. You could come to depend on marijuana to not be bored, or have mental cravings for marijuana and feel uncomfortable when you are not high, but this is fairly rare and I have only seen it effect the heaviest of users. <br /><br />D. You could lose motivation, but this is pretty rare as well and there are lots of accomplished doctors, scientists and others who have mentally and physically demanding jobs who use marijuana. This is also much more likely to effect heavy users than light to moderate users.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />E. You could suffer from quite intense panic attacks while under the influence, this is not particularly rare and it seems like it effects quite a lot of marijuana users at one time or another. Some people are more sensitive than others. The panic goes away when the high does, and you can probably stay in control&nbsp; of yourself, and if you keep some fast acting benzo on hand you will be even better off. <br /><br />F. Driving skills are negatively effected while under the influence of marijuana, but not to the same extent as when under the influence of alcohol. <br /><br />I think that is a pretty comprehensive list of the negative health effects of marijuana, and as you can see many of them are preventable / reducible with responsible use and thoughtful planning.&nbsp;

				i have psychological addiction to marijuana. my day starts with a joint and ends with a joint, with another bunch through the day...<br />the demotivation thing is true.. i am experiencing it, although not very intensely.<br /><br />my fault, but it has taken me 5 years to realise this.<br /><br />and now i find it extremely hard to stop....even for a few hours....<br /><br />so the dangers associated with weed are definitely based on how you use it. If you are a regular ( or heavy ) smoker, it isn&#039;t really safe, cos any kind of smoke, when inhaled, will deposit particulate matter, which is already bad for you.<br />in response to this, your lungs produce mucus, which traps the particles, as well as any other things you are inhaling ( nicotine, tar, etc). this also results in prolonged exposure of lung tissue to such chemicals, thus risk of cancer or damage is higher.<br /><br /><br />if you notice that you have a persistent cough ( when not smoking ), and itchy feeling in the lungs / throat, its a sign that your body cannot cope with the load of shit you are inhaling.. so time to slow down...<br /><br />by the way, if anyone has any suggestions on how to stop smoking weed ( even for a day or two ), please provide suggestions.<br />i have tried the following:<br /><br />1. cut supply ( nope, does not work.. 5 years of hard work ensured there&#039;s always weed around me, even if i don&#039;t want to smoke )<br />2. do not smoke weed ( results in smoking way too many cigarettes )<br />3. do not meet people who smoke ( again, not possible, they are all smokers )<br />4. do other drugs ( not really a solution )..<br />5. alcohol......? yuck....<br /><br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s right!<br /><br />But, weed is not really dangerous as we can say about all the other drugs that are listed on the road, in fact, it is the less dangerous ... But it is !<br /><br />I smoke since 17 years each days several joints per day, and i always had a work, a wife and some great friends, always did what i wanted to do. I smoked cigarettes 10 years before i quit smoking those but i never stop smoking MJ.<br /><br />When i stopped tobacco it was a real nightmare for 4 months with real psychological craving, i felt completly drained and my body tired. My brain ask me to smoke each minutes but it never happens with MJ.<br />I never stop smoking MJ and now, i just understand the real way of the MJ high, it is way subtle that what i imagine. I always smoked with tobacco and now pure it is completly different, way more controlable.<br />And the high of the weed is the best because it can be strong enough to feel great vibes without being out of this world, you can be serious if needed what is impossible with any other drugs! Don&#039;t forget it is the only one that is really medicinal too.<br /><br />But, i understand it can be dangerous to a weak mind too, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />Two things i can see here,<br /><br />1. You have a strong dependency on the MJ and it is not common. MJ induce only psychological dependencies. You need to work on your thoughts, find occupations, things to do ...<br /><br />2. Try e-cigarette, i find it to work good. You have some herbal taste and mint taste that can put you far away from weed and maybe cigarette ?...<br /><br />Honestly, i would stop smoking tobacco, it is hard but you will feel ten years younger in your body, you can trust me !

				You have to go with the Ego, it is the best e-cig on the market, best price-quality. It produces a decent amount of vapor and a good throat hit.<br /><br />You can go here: vapeworld, alba vapors, and so on ...<br /><br />You will receive it in your mailbox few days later and will start using it right away, forgiven the normal tobacco :) You have to choose different e-liquids and cartomizer, clearomizer, it will cost you around 150$ overall but you will find a taste that suits your needs.<br /><br />Good life vapors make an e-liquid name magic fairy that is absynthe taste with lime. It is a complex taste where we can find notes of cannabis, same for the radiator pluid from Mad Murdock, it is the same kind of taste but even more powerful and near of cannabis.<br /><br />Try it you should stop using tobacco.<br /><br />I feel tobacco was the main problem for me in fact ...<br />I realize after stopping it that the main problem in my life was not marijuana but tobacco i was putting in my joint that created a dependency in my mind and body, creating nervous disorder that i finally manage to live with closed eyes. When each time you smoke a cigarette, you finally admit to close your eyes in front a complex situation, what is bad for your mental stability :)<br /><br />When you stop tobacco you start to feel your body and soul again. But it is hard for someone who is a real tobacco smoker i can tell you :( You need many months to really forget all your habits with it.
