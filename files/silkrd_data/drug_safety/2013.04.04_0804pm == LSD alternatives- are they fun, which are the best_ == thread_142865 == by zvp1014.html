				Hi allâ€“<br /><br />I&#039;ve been browsing over the psychedelics section rather than LSD specifically, and it&#039;s become rather hard to justify spending the same amount of cash for 2-4 LSD tabs when I see offers for 50 x 25i-NBOMe and whatnot for the same price.<br /><br />It&#039;s got me curious- why are so many people paying a premium for LSD? Is it really that much better, or is it simply over hyped relative to other psychedelics due to its fame?<br /><br />I absolutely love the &#039;acid&#039; trips I&#039;ve had- and I presume they were real LSD as they&#039;ve lasted 8-12 hours and felt similar despite buying different tabs from different vendors. The only time a psychedelic felt different was when I took 8 tabs at once from Lucydrop- it was significantly weaker, but I presume that was the incredibly low dose from the scammer.<br /><br />My favorite things about my trips would have to be time dilation (experiencing it backwards, rewinds, de ja vu), closing my eyes and seeing various animations + what I call &#039;high definition reality&#039; in my mind, and the feeling of being one with technology / electrical energy pulsating through my body.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m not sure I can afford my acid habit, so- opinions on alternate psychedelics? They all seem cheaper albeit shrooms and cacti come closer.<br /><br />Mescaline? Psilocybin? 2C-family? NBOMe?<br /><br />Being completely honest without overhyping it, are they truly not rivals to acid?<br /><br />Any resources or opinions would be appreciated!

				Dude nothing compares to good ol&#039; LSD. Also nothing else besides Mushrooms &amp; Mescaline have the same safety profile as LSD.&nbsp; 25i-NBOMe is a fun substance but like I said nothing compares to good ol&#039; LSD but I will say that 2C-B is a pretty good substance as well that&#039;s worth a try.&nbsp; Also try out any of the NBOMe. Like I said nothing compares to LSD and nothing else is as safe as LSD (Besides Mushrooms &amp; Mescaline). <br />go ahead and try out new psychedelics but I bet you&#039;ll be clinging onto LSD. Also when you do take a trip with a substance other than LSD try not to have an LSD trip in mind. Take the experience for what it is without comparing it to LSD.

				I guess there&#039;s been a lot more research into LSD as well as LSD not being nearly as &quot;toxic&quot; as the alternatives.<br />I&#039;m a lot more comfortable ingesting LSD.

				As expert David Nichols says LSD affect lots of serotonin receptors. 25i-NBOMe is very &#039;selective&#039; i. e. it binds only to one receptor (I believe 2Ta, not sure if I remember correctly).<br /><br />I guess this is where the difference comes from.

The only outright hallucination where I became scared was nearing the end of a trip I decided to eat a stuffed pepper and I felt like it was squirming like a slug; albeit I still knew it was a pepper and simply in my head. Objects did start to warble though, shadows made faces and text would do flips and dances; pornographic art would start to animate and whatnot.<br /><br />Having the colorful experience, though, would be very excitingâ€“ hopefully I can vape some DMT for it without fucking it up like my last time, or have some fun with 2Cs. I&#039;m especially interested in 2C-family drugs that have MDMA/euphoric overlap; I really regret having not candyflipped with LSD+Molly yet.<br /><br />I&#039;m seriously considering buying 100 tabs of NBOMe for the equivalent of $0.55 each; though the rational part of me is saying to buy less and see if I like it (albeit at a 1000% markup per tab).

				All psychedelics have their own respective similarities and differences, you should lurk on Erowid and find the information there.<br /><br />LSD has this familiar cosmic spirituality about it, also if you get pure stuff, the energy you feel is unreal. often makes you think of life and death in the same breath; hence why its being studied in Switzerland for helping patients with terminal cancer accept their fate.<br /><br />Mushrooms &amp; Peyote are a very organic; but variable trip. many experience large body loads, many dont. undoubtedly a classic hallucinogen that man has consumed over eternity, i do recommend but as with everything, education, set and setting<br /><br />2CB is always a good bit of fun and a nice starting point. with lower doses you get to dip your toes into the psychedelic stream, experience the visual and audio distortions without being totally headfucked. I find you can still socially interact on 2CB, wheras the headspace i enter on other psych&#039;s leaves me rather spaced.<br /><br />DMT is for those with a fair bit of experiance; just because of the mental and physical intensity of the trip, like having a sumo wrestler sit on your brain then blast you through time and space.<br /><br />

				Love acid but haven&#039;t tripped in a year now. But I&#039;m going to give 25i-nbome a go in a few weeks and I&#039;ll see what&#039;s it&#039;s like.<br />Planning another acid trip in June - so I should be able to compare and contrast both trips as they&#039;ll both be relatively fresh in my mind.

Literally no two trips are exactly the same. The range of effects LSD can cause is enormous and full of all kinds of awesomeness. Nothing can compare to LSD in this aspect. It is beyond a doubt the best psychedelic I have ever tried. I have only tried mushrooms a few times and they were not exceptionally bad or good. Have not tried mescaline. I have tried a lot of old school research chemical psychedelics though, and they tend to be much more scripted feeling than LSD. Some, like 2c-b, have decent ranges of effect....but they are largely much more similar between two trips&nbsp; than in the case of LSD. LSD continues to surprise me to this day, and I have taken it hundreds and hundreds of times. Most research chemical psychedelics I have tried were enjoyable as well, I particularly enjoyed 2c-t-2, but after having taken any of these given drugs a few times you really are not going to get anything new out of them. Taking LSD is painting a masterpiece, taking 2c-i or whatever tends to be more like watching a motion picture. Entertaining, you might watch it again a few times, and mostly enjoyable. But not creating a masterpiece with a fresh canvas and new set of paint every time. Of course this is just in general though, I have had awesome +4 experiences on research chemicals, but these experiences imo tend to be exceptional where as with LSD it just always seems to happen :).

There were a few years that I&#039;d been a vegetarian (and now more of a meat minimalist), butâ€“ I thought about how a cow consumes grass or grains, the cow&#039;s slaughtered, cut into steaks which I eat, eventually my body will die and rot to feed the earth&#039;s worms and grubs and bacteria and whatnot, which could grow fertile soil that a rabbit might eat grass from, or a bird may consume the grubs... It was a very much about the cycle of life and death and how death isn&#039;t exactly an ending, as the molecules that make me up will eventually make up something else; how consumption is more of a recycling than murder. The images in my mind eventually went very violent; gore, my brain splitting in two, and similar imagery; Yet strangely it didn&#039;t bother me.<br /><br />Sound like a real LSD trip to you?<br /><br />Another trip I&#039;d been playing Portal 2, so when the drugs kicked in I was somehow able to solve all the puzzles while feeling like I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. When I eventually stopped gaming, my mind wandered to sci-fi, teleportation, space... the concept of âˆž, numbers, and I had lots of exciting vibes where I lost any sense of spatial awareness. Time rewinded a lot; when I close my eyes, I saw sharp, more high definition than life text, with companion cubes flying all around and the like.<br /><br />Yet another trip- I had been watching a marathon of Futurama a few hours earlier, so I just had constant images of Bender flying throughout my closed eye visuals. Yet another trip, I became fixated on this piece of pornographic art, pretending it was an image of a goddess; my vision warped the two drawn eyes into six, and every time I stared into them I felt like I was being drawn deeper and deeper into a hypnotic trance; a bit like the song of a Siren.<br /><br />So.... does this sound like legitimate LSD? What psychedelic would you say would give me experiences similar to these- or is LSD the only one?

				I had some of the best visuals I&#039;ve had in a long long long time on some DOC. I also peaced out to some crazy fuckin dream lands a few times listening to music. Then I would come back and be like WTF was that!?!? Awesome. Then go dance and shit. I&#039;ve had a long love affair with LSD for years that turned sour, we have reconnected but I like the other shit too.

The colors, the colors the colors... So damn beautiful. I swear to god it makes your vision so awesome! I could literally see skin cells on skin without the use of anything but my eyes. I had the light on the whole trip so I could see everything, it was so goddamn magical. Not a lot of visual hallucinations, but at the peak I swear every knick and knack in my room had a face and was moving. Only lasted a couple minutes, though. <br /><br />I can&#039;t really compare it to LSD (since I&#039;ve never done LSD), but it&#039;s definitely a cool drug.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />See, one of the weird things for me with my acid (Presuming they are acid) was I never got the stereotypical kaleidoscope colors or whatnot (which I presume are attributed to other psychedelics); Turning on a blacklight and a blue floodlight combined with a redder light some distance away certainly helped though. The only outright hallucination where I became scared was nearing the end of a trip I decided to eat a stuffed pepper and I felt like it was squirming like a slug; albeit I still knew it was a pepper and simply in my head. Objects did start to warble though, shadows made faces and text would do flips and dances; pornographic art would start to animate and whatnot.<br /><br />Having the colorful experience, though, would be very excitingâ€“ hopefully I can vape some DMT for it without fucking it up like my last time, or have some fun with 2Cs. I&#039;m especially interested in 2C-family drugs that have MDMA/euphoric overlap; I really regret having not candyflipped with LSD+Molly yet.<br /><br />I&#039;m seriously considering buying 100 tabs of NBOMe for the equivalent of $0.55 each; though the rational part of me is saying to buy less and see if I like it (albeit at a 1000% markup per tab).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve done a fair share of different psych&#039;s and to be honest nothing really compares. Each has its different little nuances. I would say, like others have already said, try the 2C family. I&#039;ve sampled B, E, I, and T-7 and my favorite has been I. The B i&#039;ve done has been in pill form, powder form, and solutioned powder absorbed on a paper towel and put in a gel cap and this was the best version. Nothing too overbearing at 25mg but nice visuals with a warm MDMA feel to it. E i have taken as a powder in a pill and I have railed it. Needless to say if you havent insufflated a psych then you are in for a wild ride. Burns and taste terrible on the drip and comes up strong. Although if you have done DMT this is nothing as far as come up is concerned. Just know that if you snort a psych you need to curtail your dose cause if you dont then you could have severe adverse effects (ie death). Overall it was a very enjoyable but mild experience. 2c-i is by far the best. at my most i&#039;ve done 30mg powder in a gel cap and It was the most intense experience visually and mentally i ever had (this of course was increased with a nice heavy blunt when the peak hit). I have never had a more blank expression while my mind was going all over. I was in a completely dark room, yet it was as bright as if it was day time with the hippie color burst all around me. AMAZING!! 2c-t7 was the easiest trip ive had where i was still able to be completely social. i took 30mg and people didnt have a clue until i told them. <br /><br />As far as none 2c family psychs, DOM was another favorite of mine. You melt into your surroundings and dont need very much to entertain you. Just be aware that it is made with amphetamine so you do have a bit of a rush. But if you want a rush and trip heavy then DEFINITELY candyflip. My first experience with this was 2 hits of LSD and 2 rolls and Infected Mushroom playing before me. Amazing experience, no fear, and lasers just kept the ambiance going. I dont think I can ever take LSD again without adding MDMA; it makes the experience that much better, and you do not even notice the rush/roll feeling unless you consciously focus on it. Its not overbearing; it is just the perfect feeling.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps you out when deciding. I honestly have the mentality of if you come across it, try it. you never know what you are going to like!

				lol well i respect your opinion, im just saying I&#039;VE been there and done that. ive done a couple of dox substances, one 2c-x, 25-(i,b,c) nbome.... <br /><br />they all have moments of extreme body loads and like i said, you cant replace the divine nature of lsd.<br /><br />the psychedelics that bring you to &quot;god&quot; are- psilocybin/psilocin mushrooms, lsd, and dmt.<br /><br />all indole tryptamines&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />out of all of the research phenethylamines, i would pick dom.<br /><br />i would never encourage its use, but if i had to pick&nbsp; ::)

				Would fucking love to see Infected Mushroom live on a psychedelic. They&#039;ve got a sound no other psy/goa group has; every album is completely different from the last yet somehow still has an IM feel to it. I think it was the second time I tripped on LSD, I was listening to all of Legend of the Black Shawarma- I got into this time loop where my brain would keep rewinding and playing the same scene over and over. Was great fun.

They also played with a full band with Amit singing and Erez playing the keyboard while mixing live too. Then they brought in a drummer and guitarist too. it was sooo sexy lol. Im kinda glad i didnt see them this last tour cause they didnt continue with this concept and just had them mixing on stage which is awesome, but i&#039;ve been spoiled lol.

Just them sitting in their two spheres with a few keyboards and presumably Ableton live, while the lighting guys create the entire show. They did come fairly close to me but unfortunately I couldn&#039;t take the time off to see them.<br /><br />I have seen recordings of their other concerts though- I absolutely love when they bring entire bands on stage to perform with them. I&#039;m a big fan of their songs with a metal vibe (like a lot of the tunes off Shawarma), but Converting Vegetarians has a lot of my favorite tunes. IM the Supervisor is also great.<br /><br />I must admit I was disappointed with Army of Mushrooms (a lot of dubstep pandering) though The Messenger 2012 and their The Pretender cover are pretty sweet.
