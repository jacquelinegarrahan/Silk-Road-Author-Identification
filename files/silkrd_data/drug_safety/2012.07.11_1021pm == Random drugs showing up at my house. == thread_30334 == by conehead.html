				I placed an order for some DMT a couple weeks ago. I canceled it after it seemed there was some shipping problems with the vendor, and I had some transient HPPD symptoms and decided that maybe more psychs were a bad idea.<br /><br />Today a package showed up that screamed SR. It contained a capsule with close to the amount of DMT I ordered (lost some trying to transfer it to the scales, which is probably the discrepancy. It is yellow crystalish powder.<br /><br />I sent a message to the vendor, but it&#039;s possible they won&#039;t respond anytime soon.<br /><br />Should I just set it aside until (if) I hear from the vendor? I know this the right thing to do, but I&#039;m itching to go around town hunting some copper wool or screens to use to vaporize it in a hash pipe. haha..... &quot;My mind&#039;s tellin me no!!! But my Body!!! My BODY is tellin me yes!!!&quot;<br /><br />Seems it&#039;s 99% sure to be DMT and 1% possibility it&#039;s some narco terrorist plot to send anthrax to people disguised as [what it was disguised as].

Of course I kinda take the &quot;all chemicals are unidentified&quot; stance. I&#039;ve ordered 2ci-nbome twice and the experiences were the same both times. I still don&#039;t know if I got 2ci-nbome or a totally different substance (and the same different substance each time.)<br /><br />That said, it very easily melted into the steel wool in my pipe which is loaded up while I try to make a decision.

				Wait. Tripping is fun and dandy, but over dosing on a unknown substance is a bad idea. <br /><br />Don&#039;t do it until you hear a response.

				Wow @ the MDMA IV story. hah. Crazy.<br /><br />I never have too many chemicals around. I&#039;m not a big drug user. I&#039;ve just been experimenting a little this summer because I discovered SR.<br /><br />I was not expecting any substances in the mail. there was no reason that it should have arrived unless it was sent on accident. It weighed out. The color matched (was suppose to be yellow.)<br /><br />It melted easily into the stainless so I took a risk and took 1 medium hit and held it. Holy shit. It&#039;s DMT. High pitched buzz with an extreme, inhalant kind of high. Intense open/closed eye visuals. CEV&#039;s were vivid colors like nothing I&#039;ve seen before. sort of a flowing mesh of rainbow colors in a wall floating twards me. Had some brief &quot;fear&quot; because this stainless steel will melt/burn if it gets too hot and I didn&#039;t want to inhale melting metal.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t dare take a 2nd/3rd hit because it came on so fucking strong and I was without a babysitter (someone in the next room though.) I had to put down the pipe so I didn&#039;t drop it. It did not get hot as I did not put the flame into the steel but held it out in front. No fire risk. I&#039;m not completely insane. :)<br /><br />After my 1 hit, I know now that I need a babysitter. I felt some of the acceleration that people report, and collapsed onto my bed and my breathing became very purposeful. The audio hallucinations were incredible. Very much a &quot;utopia&quot; chime / giggling sound experience. I could hear the sounds that preceded the distortions and the audio kinda formed into the new sound. I loaded ~40mg into the pipe and certainly didn&#039;t use it all. Entirely intense and incredibly interesting. The open eye visuals were the most cell shaded/cartoony that I&#039;ve ever seen. It was very cool. However it was the most extreme experience I&#039;ve ever had. I wish I didn&#039;t have such a fear of MAOI&#039;s, or I would try an oral dose. It came on so fast and strong that I had to tell myself &quot;it&#039;s ok, this is a drug, it will be over very soon.&quot; I recently overdosed on 4-aco-dmt and had just a terrible experience, and maybe I should take a break to let my psyche heal more completely before I dose again to avoid getting into nasty headspace. The thing is, I feel better than ever otherwise. I think there was maybe some fear put into the picture because I was doing it on the down-low, real quick in my house.

				Yes indeed I was lucky. I still feel bad because it happened because I cancelled the order and it fell through the cracks. I&#039;m going to tip him what btc I still have in my account as well as be sure to order (and just be patient.)<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty damn sure after 4 experiences that I&#039;m going to try it orally with an MAOI next. It is an amazing experience. If there is a god, I met god.

				Heh it&#039;s true though, I went a bit nuts when I first started SR ordering &quot;bit of this, bit of that&quot; then quickly realised I was going to lose track of various unidentified powders showing up... not to mention updating vendor feedback etc. Easy to do!

I come out of it and feel like I&#039;ve taken a long long nap. I feel amazing.<br /><br />The ayahuaska shaman from South America say you need to do it once every two months at least. I think I&#039;m going to have a session or two once a month at the most for a little while. I see the tremendous potential for this substance to effect my grip on reality and I&#039;m going to be very careful.<br /><br />It is the most profound substance I&#039;ve ever encountered. I would recommend it to anyone interested in asking questions about reality. I would not recommend it for people who just want to dose and &quot;get fucked up.&quot; I&#039;m not saying no one should try it for that purpose, just that it doesn&#039;t seem to work that way for me.
