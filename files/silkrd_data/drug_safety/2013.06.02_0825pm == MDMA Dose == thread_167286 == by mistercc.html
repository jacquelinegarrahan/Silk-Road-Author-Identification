				I was just reading a post about MDMA and I have not really been aware of how much you should take in one go and done it by eye from experience. My body weight maybe a factor from what I have read my partner is half the body weight ( i suppose thinking about it it is the same for alcohol which I can drink twice as much as my partner ) so my partner should get less...<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any advice.&nbsp; ;)

				It&#039;s usually somewhere around 100mg for most people but I&#039;d just check it out on erowid, the dosages are pretty well explained.

				1.5mg of MDMA per 1kg of body weight is the recommend dosage for MDMA.<br /><br />For example if you weigh 80kg&#039;s..<br />1.5*80 = 120mg

				I did a 150 in the end which was just right. The next day I was ok but my partner felt a bit buzzed still they seem to suffer from a mdma hangover. I think more fluids would help?

				dose at 120mg-150mg and if you must redose...dont do more than another 100mg (250mg max). If you plan on redosing, it is best to do it after like 60-90 minutes and not wait until you have started to come down...you will be wasting it.

By that formula; I would need 125 MG. But with 84% pure, PMK White MDMA, I really, honestly, actually, only need about 85 mg to roll hard. So... yeah, it&#039;s really case by case, and there&#039;s no exact science to it. Though, 1.5 x weight in KG is a good way to avoid over-dosing, as you likely don&#039;t want to exceed that number until you&#039;re more experienced.

				Nice thread and helpful answers , thanks!<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried like 3 times mdma, always use 0.250 mg , getting pretty high, sometimes more sometimes less.. I bet it was never that good product.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to go for my first buy and get a good mdma and really experience with less quantity, a better sensation.<br /><br />I read many times in the forum that Sr&#039;s mdma it&#039;s always pretty good (besides scamers), experiences?<br /><br />

				Note that these are pure mdma doses. If you buy crystal 80% pure you will have to take a little bit more in order to have the effects expected.<br />I usually take around 120mg and I am 60kg. If you take it, don&#039;t redose or only once, so don&#039;t take 100mg, then 100mg and then 50mg, it is better to take 150mg and then more in function of your feelings.<br /><br />But remember that in mdma more doesn&#039;t mean better.

				I asked the good DoctorX this the other day.&nbsp; 1.5mg of MDMA per 1kg seems like the general consensus and typically women don&#039;t need as high as a dose although it affects different people differently.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.195
