			<dd class="postbody">
				Hi all!<br /><br />Someone posted a question about 2CB earlier and I realized there really wasn&#039;t a lot of consolidated information on the drug so I thought I would put something together from my limited experience and research. It seems to be one of the more played with substances out there right now and I know a lot of you are probably like me, want to have some fun but want it to be safe as well. So here we go:<br /><br />Dose:<br /><br />Dosage varies based on Route of Administration (ROA) and tolerance to the substance. Insufflation (aka snorting) tends to require the smallest dose with the fastest onset and quicker duration while taking it orally requires a slightly larger does and provides a longer effect. Plugging (aka rectal administration), seems to be somewhere between the two. The dosing information below would be most relevant to oral administration. For insufflation I would suggest lowering by at least 25% until you understand how the drug effect you. Plugging seems to require about the same dose as oral administration for me.<br /><br />Threshold Dose seems to be approximately 5-10mg and provides a light and manageable body high.<br />Active Dose seems to be between 15-25mg and provides body high with some visuals.<br />Stoned Dose seems to be between 25-35mg and similar body high with greatly increased visuals.<br /><br />While insufflation hits you pretty quickly (a matter of minutes) it&#039;s been my experience that regardless of ROA this drug continues to get you higher well after you think it&#039;s hit. If you will be redosing it&#039;s important to wait long enough to make sure you have felt the full effects of the previous dose. Fortunately, when you eventually do over do it, the likely outcome is just going to be some good strange visuals but since not everyone wants to get out of their mind trippy when they do drugs it&#039;s worth noting the long come up so you can stay in a good place for your adventure.<br /><br />Unlike something like MDMA where it&#039;s pretty safe to say to a first time user that ~120mg is going to get them going, with 2CB one person might easily fly to the moon on 15mg while another could just find that slightly above threshold. My personal advice with this substance is to take a 7-10mg dose orally, wait approximately 1.5 hours and then top off the dose with a CAREFULLY measured insufflated bump of between 5-15mg more based on how much more you would like to be tripping. As mentioned above this drug is nice in that it provides a nice body high even at lower doses so you&#039;ll probably still enjoy finding your threshold dose before bumping to your active dose.<br /><br />Keep in mind, your dose is not your friends dose. If at all possible I recommend you take this staggered approach to dosing with anyone that is unfamiliar with the substance just because the does range varies so much from person to person and really we just want everyone to have a good time right?<br /><br />With insufflation, one thing to mention is that this is not nose candy and it really burns a good bit. Imagine snorting pepper and you are in a good ballpark for the experience. The burn only lasts a few minutes and is mostly negated by the body high of an existing dose though so it is manageable.<br /><br />Experience:<br /><br />All right, so you have the drugs in you what is likely to happen now?<br /><br />Fun.<br /><br />At the threshold dose you are likely to start feeling a little lighter and happier. Body sensation is increased to the point where if no one is looking you will likely be touching yourself / rubbing your hands together. Little emanations of joy will likely pulse through you, similar in a way to MDMA but more casual, like a breeze compared to MDMA&#039;s wind. At a low dose, colors and light will likely be slightly enhanced but not to the point of seeming out of place or odd, more like you increased the sharpness and color on a TV. There is some mild stimulation at this point but I&#039;ve never felt overwhelmed by it. <br /><br />Talking is pretty easy and I can see this does range being about where I would want to be if I was at a club or hanging out with some friends at an event.<br /><br />At the active dose things are going to start changing a little bit. You will still be in a good headspace most likely and enjoy the body high but those visuals are going to start amping up pretty aggressively. That color and sharpness thing from before is going to be replaced with out right oddity. Patterns will start to shift. You&#039;ll still be able to see what is there but it will look markedly different. People become etched in place. Cigarettes start to vibrate. Sound distortions become somewhat obvious. The mindspace becomes a little more fuddled as the visual experience is pleasantly distracting. Walking around and moving is possible but you&#039;ll likely look a little high. Talking isn&#039;t that hard but trying to talk to someone sober is less fun since the most interesting thing to talk about is all the crap you are seeing happing to the world around you. The colors and lights at this point are noticeably more pronounced. <br /><br />At the stoned dose you are moving closer to a full psychedelic experience. At this does range things sometimes start to... well... melt for lack of a better term. If you are watching something move there will likely be trails and the movement will blend together in a slightly odd out of sync way.&nbsp; It&#039;s sort of like watching the world in slow motion and normal speed at the same time. They really should not fit together but somehow they do. At this point in the journey I am prone to reaching out and touching fractal creations that exist only in my mind. If I am smoking a cigarette the pattern of smoke might start the visual feast but even after the smoke is gone those patterns stick around. <br /><br />Not being hugely experienced with psychedelics this is normally the point where I need to remind myself that I am enjoying all the insane shit that I am seeing and want to be exactly where I am in my mind at that point. Time seems significantly less relevant as you get this high and the mildly stimulating effects of 2CB will likely make sleep a little harder when you are ready to call it a night. Moving around is still possible but I have all the grace of a turkey in a duck pond once I get this high. <br /><br />Duration:<br /><br />In my experience the active duration of the trippy part of the trip lasts about 2-3 hours. A little less if snorted and a little more if taken orally. Eating is still possible if you are high although you might not want to if you are much above the threshold effects. <br /><br />Tolerance:<br /><br />It&#039;s been reported that tolerance build up pretty quickly for these 2C class of drugs but I really haven&#039;t dosed frequently enough to comment extensively on that. If you are a once a weekend user it will likely require a little more over time but if you stick with the dosing suggestions above you should still be able to get where you are going. <br /><br />After Effects:<br /><br />Unlike a lot of drugs, this one actually leaves me feeling better the day after I take it. Things still seem a little sharper and touch still feels a little nicer. It&#039;s not like I am still high by any stretch, just in a slightly better mindspace even if the previous night took the dose pretty high. <br /><br />Mixing with other drugs:<br /><br />The most popular combination with 2CB seems to be to take it at the end of an MDMA roll. Having tried this myself, I can safely say that it really is a pleasant way to come down off of MDMA and makes the &quot;E Hangover&quot; quite a bit less pointed. If I were taking it orally, I would probably want to does sometime shortly after the peak of MDMA just because it takes a while for the oral does to kick in. Plugging I would do about an hour after peak and insufflation maybe an hour and a half after peak. While the 2CB compliments the come down, it really doesn&#039;t enhance the high so taking them together for me isn&#039;t something I normally do.<br /><br />In general what you can expect from dosing 2CB after MDMA is a transition of the roll into a slightly different place. Often on MDMA I feel like I am high and all is great and then I&#039;m not and I wish I was again. By taking the 2CB at the right time in your trip that empty not high feeling gets replaced with a new sort of fun experience. It keeps me from fiending on more MDMA which is nice and at lower doses it eventually lets me curl up and go to sleep if I want even though I am still pretty high off the 2CB. Most people find their threshold dose of 2CB to be the best fit for finishing up an MDMA roll. More can get you to the visual wonderland but when combining with MDMA it will be more jarring to get there vs. just slipping comfortably into mild trippiness. <br /><br />Bad Trips:<br /><br />Last but not least I think it&#039;s important to note that not every trip is going to be a happy one for you. This drug can take different people different places so you want to make sure you are in a safe comfortable place for the degree of tripping you are planning on doing. My girlfriend and I did a dose the night after we had binged a little on MDMA and she was in a pretty sad spot at the time that 2CB did little to fix. She got a little weepy and quiet not really wanting to interact at all. The moral of the story being that if you are in a bad mindset 2CB is likely going to just enhance that bad mindset for you. There is no inherently &quot;Feel Good&quot; push with this drug it simply amplifies what you take into it. <br /><br />Hope this helps a few people as they experiment with this substance. Feel free to ask anything if you need some advice. The above information is based primarily on my usage of the substance and is by no means all inclusive. Always find out for yourself where the safe limits are for you.

				excellent information DiamondSky +1 for you...<br /><br />it seems that every source of information on 2C-B I look at regarding dosage they always go from 5-10mg and skip up to 15mg+<br /><br />what happens at 11mg - 14mg???<br /><br />also what is the tolerance for 2C-B like? will tripping on 2C-B one day then tripping again the next day result in decreased effects? how long in between trips should one wait?

Honestly it&#039;s likely dependent on the person and going to be on one of the two steps of either a threshold or active dose. It&#039;s pretty weird but there&#039;s not a huge amount of middle ground so far with me playing with the stuff. I either dose enough for the body high or dose enough for that and the visuals. I&#039;ve never had much an an in between sort of experience where it was only just slightly visual but maybe I just need better scales.<br /><br />Everything I have read and experienced so far says that once a week is more than enough spacing. However, I&#039;ve dosed aggressively and a day or two later taken a bump and gotten right where I thought that size bump would take me. If there is an eventual tolerance to this it&#039;s not a double the does the next day sort of deal at all. I&#039;m actually testing it right now at barely threshold levels a few times a week to see how it helps in... well.. the bedroom. I noticed my girlfriend and I get quite a bit more romantically entangled a day or two after I use 2CB. More passion, more romance, more confidence... so I figured I would try a tiny bump every few days less to get high than to see if that&#039;s a predictable outcome. If those bumps keep getting larger I&#039;ll have a better idea on tolerance.<br /><br />Have fun!

Doesn&#039;t have to be too scientific, split it in unequal halves and do the bigger side first. If you&#039;ve done psychedelics before there really shouldn&#039;t be too much of an issue going all in on the first time but if you&#039;re new to seeing pretty colors and shifting shapes you might want to work into it a little. The effects from 15mg oral, even if that is just starting the high for you, is pleasant enough and worth getting to know.&nbsp; After an hour and a half if you snort the last 10mg or so that will likely push you into a visual place anyway so you still get the full ride if you want it.<br /><br />I watched Wall-E on it the other night with the GF, was a nice colorful time.<br /><br />Have fun and let us know how it goes.

				Thanks for the info DiamondSky.<br />I&#039;ve got 100mg on the way to me from Mahakala and I&#039;m excited to try it. I haven&#039;t got scales so I&#039;m going to use volumetric dosing. If I mix it with 250ml of water + vodka, a 25ml shot will be 10mg, so that should be a reasonable starting dose. Does that sound like a good plan to you guys? <br />Thanks for any advice

				After readying this thread, I&#039;m really excited to try 2C-B for the first time. For experienced users, I have a question. Does 2C-B effect your tolerance to MDMA? For example, If the last time I rolled was 2 months ago, but I took 2C-B last week, will this cause a tolerance issue? Just wondering. I guess my question can be extended to the other 2-Cs as well.

I can see things going a little bad if someone slipped 500mg in the first bag you ordered from them but that seems unlikely. If you get it and just keep looking at it funny wondering if there&#039;s really 100mg in there or not I would likely take a trip to a tobacco shop and pick up a $20 scale and make sure it comes out about right. If you use water with the alcohol you might want to pickup a small bit of distilled water from the store, again not a big deal but the water companies throw chlorine into the tap water which if stored for long could have have a negative effect on the dose.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.msg731488#msg731488">Quote from: dreams189 on January 16, 2013, 04:14 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">After readying this thread, I&#039;m really excited to try 2C-B for the first time.

I looked around all the known sources and didn&#039;t find anyone that seemed to really disagree with that assessment. The simple fact that I can take 2CB at a standard to low dose at the END of a huge MDMA roll and still feel the effects tells me that they operate on at least slightly different brain functions. If they were playing with the same neurons that end of the night 2CB does would be ineffective or at least need to be much higher but that has never been the case for me. 2CB itself doesn&#039;t seem to establish much tolerance in that if 20mg gets you high this week 20mg will very likely get you the same high again a week later. <br /><br />Like most people I suspect you want to hold onto the magic that MDMA provides by making sure your brain doesn&#039;t get to used to being on the stuff and 2CB seems like a nice spacer substance for that so far for me.

I haven&#039;t got scales so I&#039;m going to use volumetric dosing. If I mix it with 250ml of water + vodka, a 25ml shot will be 10mg, so that should be a reasonable starting dose. Does that sound like a good plan to you guys? <br />Thanks for any advice<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah that should work pretty well with the caveat that ordering 100mg is not exactly the same as getting 100mg. I can see things going a little bad if someone slipped 500mg in the first bag you ordered from them but that seems unlikely. If you get it and just keep looking at it funny wondering if there&#039;s really 100mg in there or not I would likely take a trip to a tobacco shop and pick up a $20 scale and make sure it comes out about right. If you use water with the alcohol you might want to pickup a small bit of distilled water from the store, again not a big deal but the water companies throw chlorine into the tap water which if stored for long could have have a negative effect on the dose.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I hadn&#039;t considered the chlorine, thanks! I&#039;ll probably just use alcohol in that case. After doing a bit more reading, I&#039;ve decided to start with a super low dose (&lt;1mg) and build up to about 15mg slowly, just to make sure it isn&#039;t something far more potent or way more than I ordered.

Most other psychedelics put you into mental world that matches your visual world but 2CB is almost all visual (at the right does) with a decent body high, the mind stays remarkably clear given the world you see around you. For the first time you really just need to dial in about 10mg and see where you are at. Take the 10mg early and after an hour and a half bump more as needed. Once you get a feel for the drug the doses are constant it&#039;s just that first time you don&#039;t really want to go too big to start as the body load when coming up can be pretty sizable.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.msg825882#msg825882">Quote from: smogmonster13 on February 14, 2013, 11:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I agree with Dreams.

I notice I really get into porn a great deal more, like I&#039;m closer to the actors if that makes sense. I notice if I take a bump while jerking off I can cum just a few seconds later but I think that&#039;s because of a quick rush from snorting. So there are sexual effects but I don&#039;t think it is an overwhelmingly sexual drug. While it makes things physically and visually more interesting, the clearheadedness is sort of a downside as it doesn&#039;t get you into that near worshipful mindset that other drugs can. <br /><br />The lovey feeling of MDMA is sadly missing. You&#039;ll bond with people over the crazy shit you all will be seeing but it doesn&#039;t do much to tear down defenses like MDMA.&nbsp; My favorite use for this drug really is at the end of an MDMA trip. Placed at the right time, it smooths out the down from MDMA and takes you to a nice new place. When I take it on it&#039;s own I normally end up wishing my head was as fucked up as my eyes were.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.msg827091#msg827091">Quote from: cyberscour on February 15, 2013, 05:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thanks Diamond Sky, great information as always!

Longer trips, more diversity for the experiences, every time is a new adventure.

				My experiences with friends and 2c-b is that 20mg seems to be a good starting dose, its a little more intense for people who are naturally sensitive, but not too weak for those who aren&#039;t.<br />Also I find IR is the best method of administration - none of the burn you get with nasal, and clearer, stronger effects then you would get with oral with around the same duration but a significantly shorter come on/ come up.<br /><br />Also people need to be aware that MAO-B inhibition is not a 2x potentiation (see MAO-A inhibition and lsd), but rather a 4x potentiation. This can be dangerous !! I took 25mg with MAO-B inhibition and it was one of the most intense experiences of my life. ever trip for 16 hours on 2c-b? - Yeaahhhh<br /><br />That being said I love 2c-b its one of my top 3 drugs&nbsp; ;D

				so happy to see 2cb &#039;awareness&#039; take off on SR<br /><br />not gonna lie...i was apprehensive at first...the acronym..or initials of a drug that has multiple variations (2c class)<br /><br />So i read a little and saw alex shulgin saying how great it was....i mean, come on.. a fucking genius who created as well as perfected the art of synthesizing over 200 drugs?!&nbsp; and he names this one as one of the top, creme de la creme?&nbsp; I am in...but wait..still kinda...nervous....<br /><br />..then i read about its &#039;forgiving; qualities...not much of a mind fuck- responsible-hold the steering wheel kinda mentality..and I was SOLD<br /><br />8+ trips in now i can say the following:<br /><br />Oral has a little squirmy..anxious come on aspect to it..nothing crazy<br />Nasal is awesome!&nbsp; i alsways do exactly half of what i would swallow if i snort <br /><br />anything above 20mg gets almost exponentially more intense.&nbsp; &nbsp;example..20-25mg me and all my friends were looovving it..but kinda felt like...OK..we own this..i want more &#039;ampage&#039;....what do we do?&nbsp; next time we drop 30-35mg and it was NUTS<br /><br />everything had this fuzzy like quality...literally everything looked like some type of felt or furr...and the GLOWING LIGHTS was ASTOUNDING....subtle glows everywhere....but..it was kinda overwhelming for some..(me included)&nbsp; we all laid down and practiced breathing techniques&nbsp; to calm some of us down (2 people actually forced themselves to go to sleep 2hrs into it...which was fucking impressive)...actually..i did too..hahah i forced myself to nap off some of the intensity....<br /><br />but here is the thing...IF it gets intense...its at most..for 30min to an hour ....then..you &#039;get it&#039; and its fucking cool.&nbsp; idk...i said as much as I could...OP killed it with his explanation...which got me all excited to write something. seriously, great post and explanation..as this drug...ALL of my friends laugh at how hard it can be to explain &#039;the bees&#039;<br /><br />waves....glows...giggles...and wiggles&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sounds like the best way to describe it...hahaa<br /><br /><br />tits

I can eyeball 15mg of 2CB within normally about 20-30mg of accuracy if I am high enough. So we were finishing up a nice roll and decided to hit the 2CB to kind of even things out. We take about 30mg to the brain and the next hour is a flash show of things that may or may not have happened. I normally take the 2CB pretty lightly because I enjoy the body high but at high doses this shit just straight fucks you up. Put me off into an alternate fragmented reality which was one of the few times the head space matched my visual insanity.<br /><br />The down side to getting there on this is that the body load is pretty harsh, I think we both hugged our party buddy the puke basket a few times. <br /><br />Made me appreciate the drug more since it really does have a mental lift off point but man it takes a good bit to get there. This last weekend we did a nice mix of MDA and 2CB and I was sort of enjoying that combination. The eye wiggles of the MDA added to the visual fun of the 2CB. I&#039;m not as big a fan of MDMA with 2CB (at the same time) just because the visuals can fuck with the lovey feelings I enjoy from pure MDMA but with MDA they sort of go hand in hand.

Someone else mentioned them in another thread but Amazon sells these cool little milligram scoops that can get you pretty close to the dose you are looking for. A scale is the best way to do it, or volumetric dilution, but after bonding with the stuff for a while now I&#039;m not terrified of scooping without measuring since it consistently gets me 10-13mg&#039;s off the particular supply I have been using with the scoop I have. Different stashes will be more or less clumpy and might weigh more or less so it&#039;s not fool proof.<br /><br />From a safety standpoint measure every time. From a drug users sometimes altered perspective, at least try really hard to be careful especially if you are dosing someone else. Most people don&#039;t realize what just a few MG more of this stuff can do to you.

Drop it in some water, let it dissolve and drink it. Or juice. Or Parachute it by putting it in some toilet paper and swallowing it. Can place it under your tongue and let it dissolve before swallowing it. The trick with oral is that it takes a while to come on, hour or so. I prefer snorting it now mostly because it comes on so quickly and is more potent mg for mg than oral. For your first go start slow. It&#039;s a really fun drug but it&#039;s good to get to know it a little before you go all in. You see some of us talking 20-30mg but that would just be a little risky and could make you hate the stuff when used in moderation at a good dose for your body it can be real fun.

				Just did my first medium-high dose of the B, 26mg, oral (parachuted). Come up still took a solid hour - hour-and-a-half, but man, when I started coming up, wow! Me and a good buddy took the same dose, two other friends of ours stayed in the 15-16mg range. It was one of their first times on any psychedelic, and all you out there take note: 2C-B is a great one to start with!<br /><br />Probably the most impressive open-eye visuals I&#039;ve ever had on anything, solid for a good 2 hours, then slowly tapered down for the next 2. I just got lost staring at simple things, like wood grain, cracks in concrete, and bricks. Wasn&#039;t in the optimal setting, so I didn&#039;t get to spend too much time with eyes closed, but next time I will definitely be exploring that space, as the few glimpses I got were colorful and fantastic.<br /><br />B is definitely the &quot;funnies&quot; drug I&#039;ve ever taken: I cried from laughter several times, and I was cracking people up all night. Just a really great time with friends, I hardly smoked any pot (1 hit out of a bowl at t+1h and +2h, then a huge hit out of a vape bag at t+3h), had a beer or two, and drank a bunch of water (not enough though, still had the worst cottonmouth ever at t+5h).<br /><br />There are times for the place that LSD takes you, and sometimes that weird place that mushrooms takes you is just what you need. Molly and Foxy are fun, but can be a bit physically taxing at times. 2C-P is great, but I haven&#039;t explored it enough to really pass judgement on it. What I&#039;m trying to say is, exceptional situations aside, 2C-B just might be my favorite drug on the planet!

Just a really great time with friends, I hardly smoked any pot (1 hit out of a bowl at t+1h and +2h, then a huge hit out of a vape bag at t+3h), had a beer or two, and drank a bunch of water (not enough though, still had the worst cottonmouth ever at t+5h).<br /><br />There are times for the place that LSD takes you, and sometimes that weird place that mushrooms takes you is just what you need. Molly and Foxy are fun, but can be a bit physically taxing at times. 2C-P is great, but I haven&#039;t explored it enough to really pass judgement on it. What I&#039;m trying to say is, exceptional situations aside, 2C-B just might be my favorite drug on the planet!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Glad you had a good time! Out of the hallucinogens I&#039;ve tried I would probably consider 2CB to be one of the most predictable. Most the others can take you on some neat adventures while 2CB tends to be more like a special effect filter applied to my eyes. The body high is great and the visuals are just fun, I can always tell when it hits by just checking any old picture and seeing if it&#039;s become 3d yet. If I&#039;ve taken enough 2CBthe pictures become not just 3d but moving works of art as well. It doesn&#039;t always take me into a funny mindset though, not like shrooms or acid where I might just break out laughing at nothing, but the novelty of the visuals is normally more than enough to entertain, especially with friends.<br /><br />The next step up the ladder is probably 5-10mg more when the world just fucking breaks down all together but be careful if you ever take that ride. I was literally lost for about an hour on a big dose. If something had happened there would have been no way to flip back into control of the situation at all, I was all in.<br /><br />Anyway, happy adventures to you! I&#039;m trying to work up a guide on Moxy next but compared to 2CB that drug is just freaking complicated. The doses are all over the place with reactions from sexual to psychedelic like 2CB but so freaking hard to nail down what gets you where. With 2CB I can dose for the trip I want while with Moxy I can dose big or small and get a wide mix of reactions.

				Okay guys here is some information on some extremely high doses, since I&#039;ve been silly enough to try it. I would NOT recommend any of these doses and I had some liquid xanax on hand to knock me out if things went bad.<br /><br />SUMMARY: STICK TO THE RECOMMENDED DOSES!<br /><br />My first try was 20mg but I had been dumb enough to have a small amount of xanax somewhat recently, so it did basically nothing except give me a bit of a crampy come-up feel similar to an MDMA come up.<br />Over the next 2 hours I bumped 10mg lines up to about 50mg to see if I could get it going. Got nothing but an uncomfortable feeling restless feeling like a long intense come up. Slight visuals at the end and a bitch of a headache.<br /><br />Second time I snorted a bunch of lines probly up to about 30mg while clubbing. Visuals were decent but I found it hard to interact with people so had to head home - I didn&#039;t enjoy that dose clubbing. Might try a small dose of around 15mg some time.<br /><br />Next time I tried it I was in a pretty fucked up mood and wanted to be fucked (worst time ever to do drugs), so I put 90mg in a cap and ate that, then snorted 10mg to get a quick kick in. Now THIS was an experience.<br /><br />I felt reasonably uncomfortable physically and was sweating like crazy but circulation/pulse etc was okay so I wasn&#039;t too worried. Visuals were nuts and when I lay on my bed and closed my eyes I really tripped out hard - first thought that I was dead or in a coma after a car accident, then some crazy shit went on where it was all lights and colours and I thought the universe didn&#039;t exist.<br /><br />As I&#039;ve found with 2c-b it tends&nbsp; to go in waves and I&#039;d sober up a fair bit every now and then to drink some water, and evaluate whether to tap out with xanax. I stuck with it for an hour or so tripping absolute balls before it started to get too bad and I was struggling to comprehend anything at all - like what my xanax was and how much I was supposed to use. I decided to take a sizable dose of xanax and sleep it off before things got (more) dangerous. Only after effects where a headache and groggy feeling after waking up from the xanax for the next 24 hours.<br /><br />DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DOSE - unless you want to end up in a mental hospital.<br /><br />Last night myself and 3 friends tried it again. Based on my 100mg experience we went for 40mg for a strong trip. <br /><br />Surprisingly this fucked us up WAY worse than the 100mg dose. Really not sure the cause of this, perhaps due to lack of sleep and some dex-amphetamine the night before. We totally lost our shit, could not work out where we were, how we got there or what day of the week it was and had to have a convoluted conversation about whether we were supposed to be at work! <br /><br />Taking a piss I became convinced I was dreaming and pissing the bed, had no idea who&#039;s house I was in (mine), lost all sense of time, couldn&#039;t remember what we had actually taken (dangerous!!) and was basically just a mess. It was still quite fun (I don&#039;t get anxious easily) and we were laughing like crazy for a few hours but definitely a confusion level that was not safe or pleasurable. It took me about 30 minutes to work out how to get to my room to grab xanax to end the trip<br /><br />As everyone above has mentioned - stick to 15-30mg. I think there are probably better and safer drugs out there if you want to completely lose your mind.<br />

				For anyone wondering how to measure out 15mg-30mg, take a known measure of 2C-B and a known measure of vodka; place 2C-B in vodka and shake up until no 2C-Bits are left floating around. [The HBr takes a little longer to dissolve than the HCl.] If you have, say, 1g 2C-B : 1L vodka, you measure out 20ml of vodka for a 20mg dose. How do you do that? Well, you buy a syringe! [Extra points: remember to measure from the bottom of the meniscus.] For anyone confused about the maths, simply take the mg amount of 2C-B and divide it by the ml amount of vodka. <br /><br />In my experience, eating the 2C-X family is a lot &#039;friendlier&#039; than snorting; snorting feels a bit dirty to me when it comes to these chemicals because of the intense burn. I find it very distracting and, given set / setting, starting your trip off with a sharp pain in your nose and tears in your eyes isn&#039;t ideal. However, if you only have a small amount of 2C-B, say a 20mg dose, you can split this into two, between you and a friend, and snort it to yield essentially the same trip as eating 20mg.<br /><br />Another advantage to putting 2C-B in a bottle of vodka is storage - it&#039;s a lot easier to &#039;hide&#039; a bottle of 2C-B in plain sight than a bag of off-white powder in your fridge.<br /><br />Last point: if you&#039;re taking NBOMe psychedelics, you&#039;ll need to wait at least a week before using 2C-B - I snorted ~100mg at one point because of cross tolerance issues, but felt nothing more than a bit loved up. Don&#039;t waste your 2C-B like this! [Kind of interesting that ~100mg 2C-B up your nose doesn&#039;t have any physical side effects that I noticed?]

				Hey guys, just wondering if any one else experiences severe nasal congestion when dosing on 2cb.. Every time i dose, with in no more than 30 min my nose is absolutely closed for business. I am beginning to think its some sort of allergy.<br /><br />Also, everytime i dose ill seem to peak really really hard, like total panic for at least 15-20 min, very short of breath and a very faint like feeling comes over me. So much so that i cant seem to even articulate a sentance. It soon passes, and my buddy gets it too, but it seems to be very intense for me. More so than anything else, i can almost compare it to taking a hit of DMT. Can any one shed some light on this..am i just dosing too strongly for my weight or something? Much love every one

				Do you guys think re-dosing works?

Then another (broken, but still half full) capsule after that. The effects seemed slightly intensified, but it certainly didn&#039;t seem like a 40+mg experience at all!<br />

And I&#039;m looking for that lovey MDMA thing that connectedness. I didn&#039;t hear anyone mention that. I know Shulgin thinks it has aphrodisiac properties, but I didn&#039;t hear much on that note either. <br /><br />How&#039;s it for connecting with friends, and how is it for sex? Anyone? Thanks in advance. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>.<br /><br />So the sex thing is sort of odd with 2CB. I notice I really get into porn a great deal more, like I&#039;m closer to the actors if that makes sense. I notice if I take a bump while jerking off I can cum just a few seconds later but I think that&#039;s because of a quick rush from snorting. So there are sexual effects but I don&#039;t think it is an overwhelmingly sexual drug. While it makes things physically and visually more interesting, the clearheadedness is sort of a downside as it doesn&#039;t get you into that near worshipful mindset that other drugs can. <br /><br />The lovey feeling of MDMA is sadly missing. You&#039;ll bond with people over the crazy shit you all will be seeing but it doesn&#039;t do much to tear down defenses like MDMA.&nbsp; My favorite use for this drug really is at the end of an MDMA trip. Placed at the right time, it smooths out the down from MDMA and takes you to a nice new place. When I take it on it&#039;s own I normally end up wishing my head was as fucked up as my eyes were.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OK I had to laugh at this one a little. Smog asked about sex with a woman, not yourself&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />My experience with 2CB and sex is the more you take, the less good sex is. I&#039;ve tried it at about 10, 15, 18, 22 mg, a couple times at the end of a roll, almost all involving sex. The higher the dose, the less good sex feels.<br /><br />Last night I did about 10mg with my girlfriend, with 3ml GHB (she did 10mg/2ml GHB), and a few hits of weed. She squirted like within 5 minutes of having sex, I had an incredible orgasm where I literally felt the ejaculation occur as a separate instance from the emotional/energetic orgasm. It was crazy :)<br /><br />Sex...there is a sweet spot, it doesn&#039;t include visuals IMHO.

				Oh I totally got that he was asking about sex with others, I was just getting at the fact that there wasn&#039;t for me, a pronounced sexual aspect to the drug. The rush I get from snorting it gets me off pretty quick as mentioned but it doesn&#039;t have as powerful a sexual component to it as sort of seemed hyped up to have with me and my girl at least. Here&#039;s sort of my experience though, if I take a light dose in the afternoon and my girl comes home at the tail end of it, sex it normally easy, fun and a little kinky. It&#039;s more like a gentle push in that regard rather than a primary function of the drug. Oddly, my girl never seems to get randy if she takes it but everyone is different.<br /><br />I guess from the hype I heard about it I was sort of expecting to take some with her and we would just naturally want to start getting down and that does not at all seem to be the case with us. I think you sort of nailed it in that the magic is at smaller doses and for me at least, normally after the dose starts winding down. Everyone is different though. GHB hasn&#039;t been the magic bullet for sex with us either but most people really enjoy it. I only tried one source for it though so want to try another before I pass judgement. Mostly it just made me feel drunk.<br /><br />Honestly I think the best combo for sex so far has been a light dose of LSD followed by some good MDMA. For some reason that just hit the sweet spot for me and my wife but as always, more study is needed!

				Dosed 18mg orally + 9mg up the dome ~30 min later. <br />Protip: It burns until you start tripping. shouldnt have snorted until I felt the effects.<br /><br />Got sick of listening to people in the room talk about how awesome they thought their artwork was so I went to listen to some music and close my eyes. Upon doing this, I realized I was an idiot for not being outside. So I went outside.<br />Pretty extreme visuals especially when I would stand still or look at something for a bit.The pavement especially. Walked around the neighborhood in the cold winter night for a couple hours.<br />The highlight had to have been standing next to a train passing by. Noticed a ton of stuff I wouldnt usually notice. When the train passed and left me sitting in the void/vacuum behind it I was suddenly overtaken with visuals. Was a good feeling<br />Pretty big body load for me at this dose. Felt as if i was loaded with physical energy and shaking uncontrollably although this was not actually happening to the degree I was imagining. <br />The main psychedelic effects seemed to disappear pretty abruptly after 3.5 hours or so.<br /><br />TL;DR - GO OUTSIDE<br /><br />happy travels,<br />~whirl<br />

(this is equivalent to somewhere between 75-100mg)<br />I tripped balls for 16 hours. Felt the come up 15 minutes after taking it, and started peaking after 30, by the 10th hour of the peak I had to take a xanax to prevent myself from freaking out over the intense body tripping (highly dissociated from my body but feeling everything 2x) (ie, feel things, but don&#039;t know where I&#039;m feeling them.) it got so bad that I felt like my legs were cramping (previous experience with mda/mdma) and lost the ability to determine if the muscles were clenched, tight or cramped and ended up just laying down listening to music for the next two hours. The visuals were about the strength of ~5 hits of acid although no where near as personality invasive and much more plastic in that it was possible to change out visuals by thinking very hard or changing music or the level of comfort of your body.<br /><br />I took it at 5:30pm and had only slight visual noise at around 10 although I&#039;m not sure it was completely gone till around 10:30AM the next day.<br /><br />I would not recommend this. Mixing 8mg of 2c-b with MAO-B inhibition though, is a pretty good time.

This was one of the drugs I kept wanting to try but the info was so all over the place for it I just didn&#039;t know what to expect. Figured one thread that talked about the good the bad and the ugly would be the way to go. Really hoping we get more people chiming in on combinations as we go along. Still curious about how it works with other stuff I haven&#039;t tried it with yet (LSD, Shrooms, other visual drugs that fuck with the head a bit more). Seems like you could get to a fun head space that was pretty fun but still controllable off a small dose of LSD for instance but up the visuals with a little 2CB.

The visual stuff can distract from the lovey MDMA feeling for us. Gets in the way of a bit of the magic if you will. With MDA though I&#039;m all about taking it at the same time, they don&#039;t fight at all, the visuals sort of complement the MDA nicely and since MDA is more physically great than mentally connected, I don&#039;t feel there&#039;s as much a conflict when I do it that way. Honestly though, if it works good for you rock it! I think we all have a secret formula for getting our brains happy and it&#039;s just a quest to find it.

				So i recently got some 2CB and have a few questions.<br /><br />#1.&nbsp; Whats the best way to handle this stuff?&nbsp; I still have it in the ziploc it shipped in but getting small amounts out is a pain.&nbsp; Dilution would be much better, but does anybody know how that affects the stability?&nbsp; <br /><br />#2.&nbsp; Anybody have any good resources to learn about the metabolism?&nbsp; I saw somewhere in this thread using MAOIs with it.&nbsp; Which MAOIs specifically?&nbsp; Are they Rx only or can I find some OTC solutions.<br /><br />I had a few days prior taken some MDA, not much tho.&nbsp; And impatience got the best of me and I had to try the 2CB.&nbsp; Started small, just ~5mg, nothing, took another 5 30 min later.&nbsp; This eventually became a total of 20mg over the course of 2 hours, with the last bit insufflated (the burn was acutally not that bad).&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately i never really got off.&nbsp; I did notice a silght body buzz and definitely noticed visual effects, but not much.&nbsp; I am guessing it would be due to cross tolerance as well as not taking enough of a dose at once.&nbsp; <br /><br />Waiting now on some MDMA and plan on trying 2CB on the comedown.

The good news is that you&#039;ll stay in a pretty functional mindset until you start playing with the 20-30mg doses. There&#039;s a point where reality sort of breaks down a little and nothing good would come of that at a rave, especially since you can get good visuals / body high without loosing track of space and time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said this before but it bares repeating, this is one of those drugs you likely want to start low on and work your way up. If you take too much out of the gate you&#039;ll probably just hate it but if you spend a little time getting to know the stuff it&#039;s one of the easiest most predictable drugs I&#039;ve taken.

I have earlier gotten the impression that 2c-b is an empathogen stronger than shrooms, weaker than MDMA (though I haven&#039;t tried it, I assume it to be stronger). Another thing is that I&#039;ve always gotten the urge to dance while tripping on 2c-b so I thought it would fit the environment well. trip duration is a bit low, which can be both good and bad :)<br /><br />Music was amazing, the dancing was engaging, and the visuals surprisingly strong and but not overwhelming. I felt that I learned extremely much about human psychology from dancing with and observing the others. I had a sense of egolessness (not ego death), but rather a fusion of my self with the organism that was the dance ;)<br /><br />Thinking was clear, but creative, minor mind fucks, no paranoia, even when an undercover cop busted a girl two meters in front of me. It just made me angry at society, not afraid of getting fucked myself.<br /><br />Sweating and body heat got out of hand at times, but all in all I found it the best psychedelic I&#039;ve yet ingested at any party, but it&#039;s the only one I&#039;ve had at a rave. Hope this is helpful info :) I think 2c-b is a great alternative for us who shy away from MDMAs neurotoxicity.<br /><br />Edit: It goes without saying that you should test the drug in a controlled environment the first time you use it. not only to make sure you like the drug, but also to minimize pre-trip anxiety. If you know your drug, then bad trips are less likely, since you learn to handle the mindstates you venture through.

				For those concerned about MDMA neurotoxocity, bk-MDMA is a non-neurotoxic alternative [READ: less neurotoxic than MDMA at responsible levels of usage] and is just as good with 2C-B. Along with some ketamine and you&#039;ve got a magical trio.

				Non-neurotoxic was overstating it, but certainly it is a lot less neurotoxic. &quot; Methylone alone was not toxic to cells except at high concentrations[...]&quot; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137202/<br /><br />http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23099177<br /><br />So this is why I tell people not to overdo it with bk-MDMA, because the diminishing returns from each redose are the first sign that you should call it a night. Above these levels [IME: ~200mg] sure, neurotoxicity can occur. However, if you&#039;re sensible (responsible, etc.), then it can be used to great effect with only a small adverse effect on your brain.<br /><br />Thanks for your addition to this conversation though, StickAFinger, you&#039;ve clearly displayed your intellectual prowess.

				Yeah I take all the neurotoxic stuff with a grain of salt. There are tons of studies pumping rats full of drugs using ROA&#039;s and dosages that rarely match human consumption so trying to correlate the results with human use is difficult at best. I think it&#039;s safe safe to say that drugs are bad for us but so is everything else. Artificial sweeteners, preservatives, high fructose corn syrup, SSRI&#039;s and the list goes on. Fortunately, we all get this thing called a brain that sort of evaluates real time what a drug is doing to us and we can decide if the perceived damage is worth the perceived reward. <br /><br />2CB has never made me feel bad or worse afterwards so it is still okay in my book. MDMA can have a bit of a hangover effect but the high I get from it seems worth it to me and diet / supplements / exercise bounce me back to normally fairly quickly. Until there are studies on real live human beings measuring typical doses and&nbsp; actual recorded before and after damage I am going to keep using my brain as the measuring stick. If bk-MDMA is less &quot;neurotoxic&quot; it&#039;s probably because it acts less on the serotonin receptors than MDMA does which is the thing that makes most people like MDMA. Even those horrible rat tests have a hard time saying if the &quot;damage&quot; is permanent or just a passing change as a result of the drugs use. <br /><br />All about harm reduction and there are tons of threads out there on the subject but I don&#039;t think most people understand that if you took ANYTHING and injected it into a rat at the dose levels they do with the drugs they test that rat is going to be pretty fucked regardless of the substance being a drug or a artificial sweetener.

				That&#039;s precisely why I prefer bk-MDMA over MDMA, because it has less of a serotonin dump. Whether or not that equates to &#039;less neurotoxicity&#039; I do not know, so that was bad phrasing on my part.

MY experience of bk-MDMA is that it is a more relaxed, less brain scrambling and overall more &#039;grounded&#039; experience than MDMA produces, especially with the different batches of MDMA floating about with more or less of each MDxx [or whatever causes subjective differences in effects] in there. Again, read my post. I admitted that non-neurotoxic was a bad choice of words. I think Diamond Sky put it very well.<br /><br />What I was trying to say was that if you don&#039;t like MDMA, for whatever reason, but want to try the magic of 2C-B and MDMA together, bk-MDMA is a good alternative. Better?

I thought I&#039;d grown too old for MDMA or it had lost it&#039;s magic on me but this combo&nbsp; really was something, my jaws dropped from pleasure and amazement and the snorting was definitely worth (it hurts a little but pain is weakness leaving the body). Felt like first time on MDMA, but better. I rarely have visuals on any substance. Will definitely snort again :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve done this combo before, but always taken 2c-b orally combined with MDMA and that didn&#039;t give me 10% of what was felt when snorted. Did drink GHB also during the experiences so it took all the edginess away. The next morning I felt rejuvenated, taking 2c-b and GHB makes me feel like I&#039;ve been to spa. Take care, work out, be humble!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />when you snort the 2c-b after the 5 hours of the mdma, the 2c-b made the effects of the mdma come back? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not really. In my experience it creates a new high that detracts from the MDMA come down. Normally when I have MDMA I&#039;ll keep bumping it for a good long time but if I take some 2CB it sort of transitions me off the MDMA high into another comfortable place with much less of a comedown. Totally different sort of high though. You get a nice body rush but not the waves of rolling pleasure you get off MDMA. It gives you some nice visuals too but keeps you in a mostly grounded mindset. In my mind it&#039;s the perfect way to end a roll because every time I have taken 2CB at the end of the night I end up feeling better the next day than if I hadn&#039;t.<br /><br />Oh and as far as the snorting pain goes, I feel obliged to mention that on it&#039;s own most people have a hard time snorting the stuff. It stings something fierce. Oddly, if you snort it while still on MDMA it goes down much easier. Personally I&#039;ve gotten used to the sting but my girl still hates it unless she&#039;s already high.

				One of my best drug experiences so far has been an LSD and 2c-b combination. I took about 300ug of LSD, then once I hit peak about 3-4 hours later, I dosed with a 20mg cap of 2c-b. Really kicked the visuals up a notch. I had full on synesthesia while listening to music with some really amazing, hard to describe CEVs. The CEVs were like tiny, multi-colored points of light that moved with the music and my own thoughts to create rapidly morphing three dimensional images. After a while the CEVs turned into a crazy laser light show and I found myself drifting towards ego death if I kept my eyes closed long enough. And I could taste music, in addition to seeing it as fractal patterns of color in the room when I opened my eyes (lots of prismatic light glowing off of things). <br /><br />We watched an episode of Louie and something else (can&#039;t remember) and I was inserting all kinds of visual elements into it that weren&#039;t there, but I was coherent enough to talk about them with my (sober) wife. The art on our walls was changing constantly, sometimes flowing and melting into other images entirely. The curtains and walls glowed and breathed. The clock danced around the wall if I looked at it for long enough. There was a coral-like texture to the paint on the walls. <br /><br />The LSD/2C-B combo made for a really nice body high, too. The couch felt like a magic carpet ride at times ,&nbsp; I was flying all over the room. But I could still get up and walk around.<br /><br />For me 2c-b enhances sex more than anything I&#039;ve taken, but I missed the ideal window this time and was already coming off the 2c-b a bit before we made it to the bedroom. The LSD seemed to overwhelm the 2c-b effects once the dual peak was over (roughly three hours after I took the 2c-b).<br /><br />My only complaint is that the combo seemed to increase thought-loops and fixations a little. <br /><br />Anybody out there done LSD and 2c-b together? My next trip is going to be a candyflip, but over the summer I think I want to try this combo again with a higher 2c-b dose, maybe about the same for LSD. Or maybe LSD, 2c-b and MDMA.

Totally recommend this combo!

In general the nose really isn&#039;t designed for snorting anything so it&#039;s never a good idea to do too much snorting of any powdered substance. Most people that have nasal issues end up dealing with them from coke which has a much shorter activity period, larger doses and more frequent redosing. I would say the smaller doses of 2CB work in our favor but I would still tread with caution. Lots of people that do coke swear by nasal irrigation, keeping the nose wet and using a saline nasal spray to clear it out after wards. If you are especially worried you can just put the 2CB is a nasal spray and kill two birds with one stone.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t noticed any painful effects from snorting but it&#039;s not an every night all the time thing for me either. Listen to your body, if it starts getting uncomfortable, you get random nose bleeds, it just feels off, mix up the ROA for a while.&nbsp;

I&#039;m normally not looking for a huge high when I dose at the end of a roll, just a smoother transition into a nice mellow high. At about 15mg post MDMA, I normally get some slight visual activity that I don&#039;t normally get if I do 15mg alone.<br /><br />The reason you weren&#039;t feeling 20mg until you snorted the 15mg is that it takes 2CB a LONG time to kick in orally. My visual dose snorted is about 20+ mg while 30+ mg tends to take me to a weird sort of place where reality breaks down a bit. Oral seems to be a little less active and again, takes a lot longer to hit. I&#039;d just hate to see you drop 30mg at the end of a good roll only to find life confusing and likely unpleasant for the next few hours. <br /><br />Anyway, hope that helps.

				WOW! LSD+2c-b is an amazing combination. I took 450ug LSD+20mg 2c-b. The result was wonderful. Here it goes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3:00 pm- Dropped three Gandalf tabs (150ug). My girlfriend and I try to figure out what we will do during our trip. We decided that we wanted to be outdoors. Since it&#039;s still pretty cold where I live, I ended up gathering some leaves,&nbsp; twigs, and logs for a camp fire. At this point we are still on the come up. The acid is kicking in. It feels great. The fire is keeping us warm even though it&#039;s only about 35 degrees outside. It&#039;s perfect. The brisk air combined with the smokey heat of the fire is amazing. I can smell the different types of wood we are burning. They each seem to have their own unique smell. The acid definitely accentuates these scents.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4:00 pm- We smoke a little weed to catalyze the intensity. We continue chatting and poking at the fire for about an hour. The visuals are starting to set in. Classic LSD visuals. Everything seems to have an interchanging purple to green tint to it. The dead grass in our back yard seems to turn into liquid as it gently ripples, and flows. I start to see hexagon patterns in the sky, and in the flames.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6:00 pm- Okay, the trip is getting to be quite enjoyable. However, I&#039;m looking to experience something a little different. Something new.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6:15pm- I weigh out 20 mg of my fluffy white 2c-b powder. I fold it up in a small piece of paper and send it down the hatch. We return to the campfire, and smoke some more weed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;approx 8:00 pm- The 2c-b starts to kick in. It&#039;s still subtle but I can already tell that it&#039;s going to be great. I noticed that my thoughts had become deep, and philosophical. I start thinking about the world as a big game. A game we all are forced to play. Also my visuals seem to have evolved. I look up at the tree in my backyard. It&#039;s leafless branches are slowly waving around. The air in front of me seems to have swooshes of purple, red, and green. As if the slight breeze revealed itself as these colors.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9:30- This is so fucking cool. A few friends join us at the fire. They don&#039;t know we are tripping face. It&#039;s amazing how well we are able to maintain composure. We all talk about the world, and how we are destroying our planet. We talk about our up-coming trip to NYC. I try to convince them all to do acid with me while we walk around Manhattan.&nbsp; As we are conversing I almost forget that I am tripping. It&#039;s such a comfortable trip. Once I remember to pay attention to my visuals, some very interesting things start to happen. My friend is standing in front of me. His entire body is outlined in a thin line. The line is made of color, the same interchanging purple, red, and green from before. Now it has some blue, pink, and gold it seemed like. The colors have also evolved into an electric glow. As if they were neon lights.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Later that night: Laying in bed with my girlfriend felt so comfortable. I was tracing her skin with my finger tips when I started to notice the flower of life pattern was all over her skin. That was one of the coolest parts. To end the night we watched the new 007 movie. Which was &quot;okay&quot;. I think I like 1990&#039;s Pierce Bronson bond better than the new Daniel Craig bond. They&#039;re both pretty bad ass though.<br /><br />I&#039;m debating re-dosing today. Even though it would be kind of a waste as I would have to take at least double dose of both. I&#039;ll probably do it anyway.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I highly recommend this combination. If i could turn back time, I would have taken 35 mg of 2c-b. Maybe even 40.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for reading!

				Hey DiamondSky, can you tell me a little about tolerance for the beez? <br /><br />The first 5 times doing it (which was 5 weekends in a row) seemed to be just as great every time. Peaking multiple times, and it was always very intense. Those where roughly any where from 15-35mg doses, pending pretty much on what time of the night it was. Most all of which was taken orally. Then just the other night, i did a collective ,maybe, 60mg, over a ten hour span, and didnt really peak at any point like i had expected to. Any thoughts?

My only thought would be potentially having ate / drank something that might have neutralized an oral dose. As mentioned earlier, it takes a long time to get into the system through the stomach and I know with other drugs there are interactions that can slow or stop absorption all together. Maybe you just won the drug testing lottery and found out that 7UP and skittles kills 2CB...<br /><br />I took small bumps, 15mg or so daily for over a week to test tolerance and never noticed too much even in that compressed usage. My doses needed to increase by maybe 10-15% by the end of it, not 100% after a week off. <br /><br />Assuming it was the same stash and you had control over it the whole time (i.e. no friends decided to take a little and replace it with baking soda) I would probably just chalk it up to a freak occurrence. If you want to make sure the stuff still works for you just take a 5-15 mg dose and snort it on up. None of that waiting a few hours, you&#039;ll feel it real quick. It stings like a bitch for a while but you get used to it.

				I think 2C-B is going to be my reintegration into psychedelics. I have gotten pretty bad anxiety with psychedelics that last couple of times that I&#039;ve taken them (including being dosed without my consent once) and have ended up &quot;aborting&quot; the trip with benzos. <br /><br />I have a little bit of work to do on myself first so I think this will be my plan.<br />MDMA experience in order to accept myself fully,&nbsp; and have a ceremony releasing a couple of frustrations and issues that I&#039;ve been having.<br />-Maybe another MDMA experience 2 weeks later if I feel like it will be beneficial.<br />2 weeks later try a small dose of 2C-B (14-15mg) (after an allergy test in the preceding weeks)<br />~2 weeks later try a fully psychedelic dose of 2C-B (maybe around 25mg, depending on how the first one goes)<br />Try the MDMA + 2C-B combo on the tail-end of the roll at some point.<br />Then I have some LSD if I feel like I&#039;d be ready for it after that.<br /><br />I think that&#039;s a pretty decent game plan in order to get myself back into the psychedelic world. I&#039;ve heard that 2C-B is the best psychedelic to do this with so I feel blessed to have this opportunity. I do have etizolam/xanax on hand to dull down trips that get too intense but the point of this plan is to not have to do that.

				I always imagined that 2CB would be some kind of speedy (amphetamine-esque)<br />aphrodisiac.&nbsp; I remember reading in Phenylethylamines I have Known and Loved, many years ago, how 2CB made the user much more sensual, much more open to sexual experience.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember him (Alexander Shulgin) saying much about the trippy part...&nbsp; perhaps i have simply forgotten those details.&nbsp; &nbsp;And i think he mentioned 2CB as an adjunct to MDMA.<br />Yet.. the theme of sex doesn&#039;t seem to come up in people&#039;s experience reports.<br />Was sex,or sensuality, not a prominent feature of this experience ? <br />I would be interested to hear. :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				It heightens my sense of touch significantly, maybe more than I would like.&nbsp; It also increases by sex drive.&nbsp; I think that 5-meo-mipt might be even stronger than 2-cb for both of these things though.<br /><br />Hallucinations can be a big distraction from sex for many people though.&nbsp; You might say that a low-dose of 2c-b is more of a sex drug but a high dose of 2c-b is just too visual and fucked up for sex.<br /><br />everyone is different though.

				The problem with 2c-b plus candy is that 2c-b tastes like concentrated plutonium :/ It would be cool though to have in chocolate or candies, easy to dose and one would immediately notice that there is something &quot;special&quot; about the candy.

				20mg (oral) might be a good starting dose.&nbsp; Always safer to start even lower though.&nbsp; If you&#039;re at a festival then I&#039;d say start with 10mg.&nbsp; You can always take more.&nbsp; Might take 45 minutes+ for the effects after dosing.<br /><br />From what I understand 2C-B will not deplete your serotonin so makes sense to use it the day before the MDMA if you want to go two days.

				So what is a safe dosing range if you were to do this frequently? I mean like, MDMA is usually 1-3 months (can be taken safely since your serotonin levels will be back to normal) What about 2cb&#039;s? how often should one take it &quot;safely?

				The reasoning for spacing MDMA 1-3 months is due to the fact it specifically targets the 5-HT (serotonin) neurons and it takes a while for a full recovery. 2C-B, however, has not shown to have any SERT activity. 2C-B is the most well study of all phenthylamines and has found to have a good safety profile. I know of individuals that go on 2C-B binges at festivals (3+ days) with no physical side effects on the short and long term. When it comes to 2C-B and &quot;safely&quot; dosing, it&#039;s more of a tolerance issue as with LSD where you won&#039;t experience the full effect if you aren&#039;t to wait a few days in between each use (granted, LSD takes longer to reach baseline). If you were to take 2C-B every weekend for months on end, there will be no ill physical side effects, but your appreciation of the experiences may diminish over time.

				I would definitely recommend taking a full 13mg pill. In fact, if you&#039;re looking for a better introduction into the 2C-B world, taking 1 1/2 would be better suited in my opinion for 13mg can leave much to be fulfilled.<br /><br />2C-B is considered to be a very safe recreational drug, even more-so than MDMA due to the reasons I outlined above.<br /><br />Much love!

				I recently tried about 17-18 mg of 2cb with alcohol (4-5 drinks) and had an amazing time. Usually when I do 2cb I become really inward and anti social, but this time the alcohol helped ease that tension. I would highly suggest it. I am curious as to how safe this is though, I felt fine, but I&#039;m thinking of trying it again at edc and I&#039;ll probably be pushing the alcohol up a few notches...

				So I ended up trying it at the end of a roll.&nbsp; Music was fantastic, loads of energy, laughing, dancing.&nbsp; I think I ended up having 25-30mg.&nbsp; I&#039;d say not to be reckless with the dosing if you&#039;re inexperienced as it can be a little uncomfortable IMO at the peak.&nbsp; Overall pretty fun!

				I&#039;ve taken 2C-B plenty of times, but mainly in pill form, so no idea of dosages. I recently bought some 18-20mg dose caps and took one at a festival.<br />Tripped my nuts off WAY more than I ever have done before. Was rolling around on the group laughing my ass of for ages with my girlfriend, she&#039;d done it too.<br /><br />We decided it&#039;d be best if we went home as we were wasted. As well as the usual sharpness of vision, really heightened colours we were also getting lots of crazy lights too. We started to walk towards the exit and past the security and some police, we were stepping over loads of tape that was all over the floor, only there was nothing there! They must have thought we were crazy. Or wasted.<br /><br />Fortunately the festival was walking distance from home, though in my state I wasn&#039;t confident so we tried to flag a cab. <br />We had to cross a road to get the cab in the right direction but it was dark and a busyish road, as the cars went past it was like a photo on long exposure, really long light trails!<br /><br />A proper toff girl was next to us trying to do the same and was going the same direction so we got a lift together, stupid idea! She was talking the whole way and I was just laughing, no idea what she was talking about.<br />We got out at the end of our road and walked the last few hundred meters wondering how the fuck we&#039;d managed to get that far!<br /><br />Once we were indoors and had some jungle on I started to relax and the visual came on a lot more. Everything was pixelated and the trails from my hand moving in front of me were really slow motioned and long trails.<br />I was also getting lots of bright lights flashing in my vision. Enjoyable though.<br /><br />We took them around 4-5pm, started to come up after around 1hr 20mins I think. Was at the peak at about 2hrs 30 probably.<br /><br />Was up and still high until I went to be around 3am I think. Quality trip.<br /><br />Next time I was going to another festival, also in my city centre, this time we decided to do half the previous dose as I wanted to stay this time. Was enough to feel the affects physically and also heighten vision, sharper colours and slightly brighter. This was all during daylight, so things aren&#039;t always quite as obvious.<br /><br />Then we walked back to a mates house for some more drinks, looked at a picture on the wall and the detail of it was moving all over the place! Man I love 2C-B. Felt fine the next day and went back to the festival. Just drinking on day two.<br /><br />Off to another festival in a few months and this time I fancy taking around 14mg during the day to enjoy it in the sunshine, then on to some pills in the late afternoon/early evening. Ninja turtles to be exact.<br /><br />Was planning to do this for a couple of days in a row, any advice on this?<br /><br />I imagine there will be alcohol involved during all of this too.

				@VitaminC: Ironically enough, I&#039;d try taking vitamins before taking 2CB, also having good nutritional food intake throughout the day before taking it is important.&nbsp; More than all of that though, is that your body temperature will be raised and you will lose a lot more water than usual, so make sure to stay well hydrated.&nbsp; Generally speaking 2CB has little to no hangover.<br /><br />@djtiesto: It will take anywhere from 20-75 minutes to hit you orally.&nbsp; Probably closer to 30-45.&nbsp; The total experience is approx 6 hours with several hours of after-effects.&nbsp; 13mg will have you feeling something, but definitely won&#039;t be overwhelming.&nbsp; some people are more sensitive to it&#039;s effects than others so it&#039;s generally best to start low, you can always take more.&nbsp; I&#039;d say you would probably enjoy those 2 tabs over the course of a day.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that re-dosing nasally is more effective, faster, and you can easily titrate up to the desired effects.&nbsp; DON&#039;T snort a whole pill!&nbsp; start with MAYBE a quarter and see how you feel, especially if you&#039;re re-dosing.&nbsp; <br /><br />My 2CB is very pure and strong.&nbsp; I currently have 16-18mg caps that I think are a comfortable level for most people where they can still function if they need to.&nbsp; Since there&#039;s so much less product when it&#039;s pure like mine, it&#039;s much less unpleasant to snort than a crushed pill would be.

				Does anyone find the duration is a lot longer than the usually stated 4 hours?&nbsp; I&#039;ve still had mild effects about 7 hours after dosing!<br /><br />Tried it again on its own last night and had quite a bit of come up nausea, but it&#039;s great fun once that passes.&nbsp; Definitely preferred at the end of a roll though I must say.

I took 120mg of MDMA, then a 50mg booster at T+2h, then 10mg of 2C-B at T+4h, and 5mg of 2C-B at T+5h. The MDMA was amazing but I was uncomfortable for the entire 2C-B experience. It was my first time with that compound and was also my first psychedelic experience in a while (I tend to get anxiety on psychs). I had some bad body load that felt like a knot in my stomach, it was also much more intense than I was expecting. I think if I were to do it again I would stay with 10mg of 2C-B and switch that for the first MDMA redose, at T+2h.

				BreakOnThrough: There&#039;s generally 2-4 hours of &#039;after effects&#039; so that&#039;s pretty normal.<br /><br />Preacherman444: I&#039;m sorry if you had an unpleasant time.&nbsp; Who&#039;d you get the 2CB from?&nbsp; I&#039;d say the reason behind that is likely taking the second dose of it.&nbsp; I generally advise against redosing psychedelics because people will often think they haven&#039;t kicked in yet, take more, then 5 or 10 minutes later start getting nice and high from the first one.&nbsp; At that point it&#039;s too late and you&#039;re in for a ride. <br /><br />Completely disregarding the fact that you took more, there are two other things that could have made it unpleasant for you.&nbsp; The first is this particular substance tends to have a rather strong body component/load.&nbsp; Some people find this incredibly uncomfortable, others think of it as erotic.&nbsp; There are people with opinions all the way in between those two extremes.&nbsp; The second is that one of the &#039;effects&#039; listed on erowid is a &#039;feeling/sense of impending doom&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve felt this way several times and couldn&#039;t put my finger on why I was uncomfortable till someone pointed that out.&nbsp; Since then when I&#039;ve had such feelings, I consider them, decide whether they are real(valid) or imagined(drug induced), and then decide if I should pay such feelings any heed.&nbsp; For the record, every time since then I&#039;ve concluded that such feelings were drug induced and once I realized that, they didn&#039;t bother me anymore.<br /><br />I think you&#039;ve got a good idea for your next try if you do attempt it.&nbsp; I would also recommend if you&#039;re going to, to have some xanax on hand.&nbsp; It can almost entirely bring you out of a bad trip(in higher doses), and if you&#039;re prone to anxiety like myself, it helps a LOT just knowing I have it on hand when tripping.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to add that I have both xanax and 2CB for sale, but that&#039;s my honest advice.&nbsp; I&#039;d highly recommend having a little xanax on hand if you&#039;re gonna trip even if you don&#039;t get it from me.&nbsp; That being said, if you DO order some 2CB from me, and mention this post, I&#039;ll throw a couple xanax blotters in for you just cause. :D<br /><br />DjTiesto: Generally alcohol doesn&#039;t combine well with psychedelics.&nbsp; I feel like it diminishes the effects of both.&nbsp; It&#039;s always best to do psychedelics(including MDMA) when well rested, not already tired.&nbsp; Already suffering fatigue takes so much away from a trip!&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely say it&#039;s a combination of both drinking and having already expended a full day&#039;s worth of energy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found a little energy supplement isn&#039;t a bad idea on 2CB, but it is a slight stimulant in and of itself so you probably won&#039;t need the additional energy if you&#039;re taking it well rested.&nbsp; I&#039; recommend some coffee.&nbsp; A red bull if you really need it.

				Ok, so on the heels of that last comment by me, I have a serious question.<br /><br />This holiday weekend I would like to enjoy the following:<br /><br />- a moderate dose of LSD (400-500u)<br />- a decent hit of high-q molly (100-120mg)<br />- 2-CB on the come up<br /><br />The problem being, as noted earlier, that I do *not* have a milligram scale. In point of fact, I have a *0.1g scale* - accurate grams, less accurate 1/10ths, and no help whatsoever below that.<br /><br />oldtoby has a package that he knows to contain 0.5g of 2-CB, and gel caps. How dumb would it be to try to eyeball this? Yes, &quot;pretty dumb&quot; is an acceptable answer.<br /><br />Thanks.

				1) order a scale now so that you&#039;ll have it in the future.&nbsp; They are damn cheap on Amazon<br /><br />2) If you have .5g then divide it up into 10 equal parts that all look the same, thus giving you ~50mg in each pile.&nbsp; Split those piles in half for ~25mg or into thirds for ~16-17mg.&nbsp; When in doubt take less.&nbsp; Like split that 50mg pile into 5 parts (~10mg) and take that to start.<br /><br />3) I personally feel that the 2C-B is better on the come-down and at that point you&#039;ll probably be more tolerant to variations in dosage.&nbsp; That&#039;s just my perspective for thought.<br /><br />4) enjoy the trip

				Whoops - I actually meant on the come-down. :)<br /><br />Amazon.com, yes. Amazon.ca, no. I&#039;m not super keen to order milligram scales cross-border if I could get them to deliver here... <br /><br />Yeah, that&#039;s what I was thinking in terms of how to figure the dose. Still a lot of guesswork - .5g doesn&#039;t look like much. But I would definitely err on the side of caution.<br /><br />Thanks!

				hey Oldtoby, heres my eyeballing experiences...with 2CB you have to be reasonably careful with the dose, 30mg will be pretty full on in most people though usually not in any way unpleasant, I usually take 25-30mg (I bought my 1mg super scales after eyeballing 2CI and getting it a &quot;bit wrong&quot; (35mg)&nbsp; I was fine but it took me over 16 hrs to come down properly!)<br /><br />A mate of mine had what was probably 50-70mg at a party (someone just took some out of a baggie on a knife, we worked out the dose he probably had by comparing it to a similar looking pile on my scales a few weeks later) and snorted it (must have hurt like hell).&nbsp; He had a pretty nasty time both with the trip (very full on and dark) and with the body load which combined with quite severe tachycardia (rapid heart rate).&nbsp; He was pretty scared and wont be taking random bumps again.<br /><br />So as others have said, get the scales in! 2C compounds are one of my favourite types of drug and low dose 2CB is great for sex, bigger doses are great for hillarious tripping, 2CI is great when you want the night not to end etc...but they are potent so be careful out there!

				If this is your first time using 2C-B you might want to aim for 17-20mg.&nbsp; If you take 35mg you should be ok.&nbsp; I always regret not taking more.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to do at least 35mg next time.&nbsp; I might need to go with 2C-I for a while though (new to me) since I&#039;m still waiting for $90/g US domestic 2C-B to return.

				You will be physically fine taking 30, even 50mg, though it will assuredly be a traumatic experience at that level.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly, 2CB has a pretty steep dose curve.&nbsp; Just a couple extra mg makes a significant difference.&nbsp; I&#039;d greatly enjoy a 16mg experience, but at 25mg I definitely wouldn&#039;t want to be in public.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard of people taking 25mg+ at an event, but that&#039;s not what I&#039;d consider the norm.&nbsp; Especially if your product is good.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d contact the vendor to make sure they didn&#039;t hook up your bag and give you an extra 10-15% because that much difference would throw me off pretty bad.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably do a liquid suspension and dose volumetrically after determining the true weight. considering you don&#039;t have an accurate scale this would be the safest method in my opinion.

				Ahaha, eh, hmm. &quot;16 hours&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;traumatic&quot;. I shouldn&#039;ve checked back on this thread before setting up doses for the evening. I eyeballed the 2-CB (from the baggie yet, deciding I&#039;d lose too much from surface contam if I shook it out and tried to subdivide) and guess I&#039;m in the neighbourhood of 35mg, +/- 15mg, now in a cap mixed with filler. *sigh* If this stuff wasn&#039;t worth more than its weight in gold, I would toss the cap and try a more conservative second.<br /><br />Ok, new plan. Will make up another, aiming for about 75% of this dose, and take that one tonight on the come down from the candyflip. If that doesn&#039;t feel on the edge of being too intense, I will take the other one another time. If this ends up being as much as I figure I can take, I&#039;ll sadly toss the first cap. <br /><br />And order a milligram scale.<br /><br />Thanks for the help, all.

				Oh, well that could very well be!<br />I bought from him a while ago (about 6 months) and I didn&#039;t bother looking for him on the Road...<br />well, I guess you can find &quot;threw the roof&quot; 2C-B at other vendors also...<br />

				On the topic of the burn.&nbsp; It&#039;s rather excruciating.&nbsp; However, once you start coming up(seconds to minutes), it will fade to a low priority.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really sure how else to describe it.&nbsp; If you think about it, yeah, it hurts pretty badly.&nbsp; That tends not to bother people though, because their tripping balls and if you&#039;re not actively thinking about it, it slips from the front of your mind as you&#039;re too engrossed in your trip.

				when i had some 2c-b from Gammagoblin<br /><br />i had decided it a good idea to stretch out my remaning 30mg<br />so i split it in half and snorted it.<br />OW. you wouldnt think that small of a line would hurt so bad&nbsp; :&#039;( though it wasnt like a fine powder. kinda stuck together.<br />didnt have a hot plate from the microwave to maybe draw any moisture out.nevertheless<br />i felt my nasal passages enflamed and highly irritated for about 20 minutes.<br />wasnt fun. but the trip that followed was nice.<br />trails n such.<br />swallowed the rest about 2 hours later<br />didnt bring me up anymore but kept me where i was at.

				Reviving this great topic.<br /><br />Do you think smoking pot before/during/after taking 2C-B can lessen the effects?<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna try 2C-B for the first time but I feel like smoking too.

				Damn guys this was hell of a day :) <br /><br />Dropped a 20mg pill after smoking some pot. Almost nothing for like 2.5 hours, then I got really nauseous and a little overwhelmed in the brains.<br /><br />Then laid down for like 15 minutes to try to calm down and do some slow breathing, when the nausea started to fade away while the walls started flickering. The clouds on the posters began to move out of places, and I was tracking a fly with my eyes which pulled like a pretty long trajectory behind it, it was amazing.<br /><br />Great visuals for like 1-2 hours, then a very gentle and long comedown, with euphoric feelings and occassional laughters. I smoked some hash during this and it was a different, very nice calm feeling once again.<br /><br />This 2C-B is some weird stuff, never had anything where I have the overwhelming first and then the comedown IS the euphoric part :) It was a great experience overall.<br /><br />So I&#039;d like to thank MrPsych! http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0441b3fc36
