				I took LSD 3 times now :D..but its too expensive for me :( 25i-Nbome is way cheaper..and legal in my country :(....anyone tried it with benzydamine(not benzodiazepines..benzydamine a.k.a Tantum Rosa)? Any combos? <br /><br />Thank you all for your time!

				I just ordered what the vendor called &quot;weekend anti-boredom kit&quot; with 2 X 1000 micrograms (ie, 1 mg) 25i-NBOME as part of it. This will be my first time for this drug, should I take only 0.5 mg instead? I like the 2C family of compounds, but I don&#039;t think I can take too high a dose without getting sick. I&#039;ve taken 2C-B in 18 mg doses before with no bad effects, but 28 mg of 2C-B makes me feel quite ill for about 1 hour or a little longer , 1.5 hrs perhaps. I recall Shulgin (the chemist) saying in &quot;Phihkal&quot; that 16 mg (of 2C-B) was &quot;museum level&quot;, where you could feel the effects, but no one around you could tell you took something. Any opinions? (yes, I&#039;d rather have LSD, but I don&#039;t).<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				Well...without my trollerance (a term which i discovered while tripping), 1 mg of 25i-nbome COMPLEXED, was mindblowing...perfect in every ways :X only the vasoconstriction is not nice :( <br /><br />Your legs tend to hurt when the trip is almost over...the comedown on 25i is the best thing ever :X you experience feelings when looking into colors ..for me ..sky blue is the most pleasant color on comedown...in my oppinion 1 mg is a good dose if you are familiar with Shulgin`s magic :D <br /><br />My first dose ever was 1 mg....(only taken ~ 120 ug LSD, ~20 trips on DXM, ~ 10 trips on benzydamine(not benzodiazepines), 2 amanita trips before)...and was mindblowing in a good way :D<br /><br />Stay safe!<br /><br />Love &amp; peace

				I tryed 500 micrograms of 25i and... I had a dreaful badtrip. Ok, I smoked far too many joints before, and when the come up arrived, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM I didn&#039;t assume, 3 hours of fear, paranoia, and all that horrible fucking-badtrip-messes.<br /><br />I tryed a month later 250 micrograms, it was so funny , everything was perfect, then I took 250 micrograms more, and the comeup was a little scaring me, and other things that made me sad (my mother who calls me, tells me I had to come back home (I planned to sleep with my girlfriend... lol) <br /><br />I tryed several times later 250 micrograms and it is very funny, but if you want an advise, try it safely... the bad trip I made was so FUCKING awfull.<br /><br />cheers! nice substance anyway, good hallucination, lot of laughs, good ;)
