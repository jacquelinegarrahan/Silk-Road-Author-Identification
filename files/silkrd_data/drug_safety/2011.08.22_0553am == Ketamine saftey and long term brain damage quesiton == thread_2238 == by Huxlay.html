				Was wondering how safe it is using ketamine i have never tried and was thinking of trying some with a friend... Had a question regarding brain damage or what really happens when you use it; lets say we try a medium dose twice would if have negative health effects or mental side effects ?

				The only known damage Ketamine is popular for is the kidneys and metabolizing the Ketamine cocentrations build up. It is also said that extreme abuse of Ketamine can cause a thickening of the bladder and blood ij the urine, but I have been doing Ketamine for years and never had any side effects.<br />There is a factor that has not been proven know as Olney&#039;s diesease lesion&#039;s on the brain but this is a theory and never proven as far as I know. The occasional use of ketamine does not lead to prolonged harm and that any damage that might occur may be reversible when ketamine use is stopped<br /><br />I am known to use ketamine on a weekly basis or have Ketamine binges, your introduction to keatmine with as little as you have planned to do will have no negative side effects on your body.<br /><br />Ketamine is a very clean experience, much liked to your brain being sucked into a vortex a very delightful vortex, my mind usually stays cler of thought while my vision goes out the door.<br />Do you be scared to experiment with Ketamine , but know there are issue that can arise in individuals with prolonged abuse...not short term abuse.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				I see , i see... Well glad to have gotten some feedback from an experienced ket user as your self bloodbath, appreciate the info sir. And yes i was doing some research on Onley&#039;s Lesions; NMDA Antagonist neurotoxicity my self , but it really wasn&#039;t proven... So who knows. Like i said i have never experienced dissociative of any type before i am usually just tripping on cid, dmt, and love cannabis. A friend of mine was getting about 1.5 of some high grade k and decided to give .7 of it if i wanted it since he owes me ; him on the other hand has tried it a few times. The only thing i was worried about was end up liking the K alot and probably doing the whole .7 pretty quick which im sure i can control myself from doing so, but just wanted someone Else&#039;s point of view on this ; someone more experienced with K&nbsp; as your slef..

I can easily say this is the last dosage tonight and not do anymore.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath
