				I&#039;m not entirely sure what you&#039;re asking for here. All you really have to do is use the bacteriostatic water as a diluent to whatever drug you&#039;re injecting. However, you absolutely need to make sure the substance you are injecting is suitable for intravenous use. If you&#039;re going to be injecting IV, you need to have an overall isotonic solution. As far as actually preparing the solution, you&#039;re going to have to supply more information. <br /><br />sdesu

				Hatter26 has a TEK on how he was able to isolate the opiate medicine from the silica gel in OP/Opana. That what I am trying to do.

				I&#039;ve heard that contact lens liquid as been used as a saline substitute in bush medicine, although i&#039;m really not sure its all that safe since it does contain small amounts of surfactants as well as chelating agents like EDTA. In unopened bottles it is sterile however, and certainly preferable over non-isotonic things like distilled water.

				Eh, I&#039;d be weary of using contact lens liquid for intravenous use. It&#039;s sterility is due to its ophthalmic use. If anything, you could use Lactated Ringer&#039;s soln or isotonic saline (I&#039;m sure this can be found in a drug store?). <br /><br />Anyway, sorry OP about the bad luck, I would help you if I could.<br /><br />sdesu

				I wouldn&#039;t use it myself either. I&#039;m not sure that proper IV bags can be that easily obtained though - its not really a product that is sold directly to consumers.
