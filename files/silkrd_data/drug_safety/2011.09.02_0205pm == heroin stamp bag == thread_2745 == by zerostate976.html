				I saw the newest posting for these and was interested in trying it, but I have no clue about heroin. I freebased tar off tin foil a long time ago and it was enjoyable.&nbsp; How much would be enough for one person with no tolerance at all? one bag?&nbsp; also i plan on smoking or snorting it depending on which you think would be better? I do not want to I.V for any reason. Any info would be appreciated! <br />Thanks

				One .1(tenth) will get your high for 5-6 times maybe more for low tolerance people sniffed.<br />Also do small half inch lines. At first and then you decide on your dosages.<br />It also takes about 15-20 minutes to kick in sniffed.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				If it&#039;s close to pure the shit&#039;s amazing. Extremely euphoria with a nice cozy fuzzy warm feeling. Almost sedated with a hypnotic trance. Very content.

				It feels like heaven, like that feeling of complete comfort when you lay in bed just right and are warm and cozy.

				I got a 1/10th as a first time a little while ago.&nbsp; I -LOVED- it.&nbsp; I had always like pills, but this was even better.&nbsp; Like others said SMALL lines, as I had done coke before and would do rails, but I literally started with a real small amount, like a few match heads or so, and then gradually proceeded to a little larger.<br /><br />The only other pill that has been equal for me was an IR Roxy 30.&nbsp; The IR Oxy 30s didn&#039;t have the same effect, but that&#039;s a different story.
