				How is it caused? Is it higher amounts that cause the brain damage or do smaller doses cause it as well? Which class of drugs causes the most? Can brain cells regenerate? <br /><br />To anyone that knows the answer to these questions, please help me out. I know I&#039;m not the only individual wondering the answers to these questions... maybe it&#039;ll help me curb my binge :/

				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotoxicity<br />Basically, a lot of drugs are either cardiotoxic or neurotoxic, mostly just in higher doses, but also a lot of drugs arent either, mostly opiates like heroin and such cause they&#039;re not toxic, stimulants and things are more cardiotoxic, dissociatives, meth, mda, inhalants, nicotine and alcohol are all neurotoxic.

				It&#039;s important to note not only what drugs can be damaging, but also at what dosages neurotoxic effects begin to manifest. It usually depends on your body weight.

Such as taking something to put back the dopamine and serotonin. L-tryosine for dopamine and 5HTP for serotonine. Both can be found at your local vitamin shop. Also taking a multi vitamin and taking vitamin c while rolling helps. Also diet and exercise are a big factor. I don&#039;t recommend exercise while on stimulants though. <br /><br />Also, there is a guy selling a product called mindfood or brain food. I would link you but sr won&#039;t load for me at the moment. i keep getting the problem loading page. When sr starts working again, i&#039;ll post the link. You might wanna try taking that supplement. <br /><br />Think of it like this. Drugs will empty your tank. Supplements and diet are gas. You have to keep putting in gas if you don&#039;t wanna break down. Believe&nbsp; me break downs are not fun.

It&#039;s like doing an hour yoga session or meditation, for the rest of the day you just feel relaxed and nothing bothers you that normally would. <br /><br />

				I&#039;d just like to point out Alcohol is one of the most neuro toxic drugs hence pregnant women are advised against drinking. So if you start there and compare it&#039;s effects to other &#039;neurotoxic&#039; drugs such as MDMA you been to see things in a true light.

				My answer might be the opposite of what you need to help curb your drug binging, but I&#039;ll respond with an honest story of my own experiences.&nbsp; I started smoking weed heavily in my late teens.&nbsp; I smoked about 2 grams a day, but my usage was far more efficient than most smokers&#039; (meaning my usage might have been more accurately compared to a normal, non-efficient smoker smoking 4 or 5 grams a day):&nbsp; I would hold each hit in for at least a minute; by the time I let my breath out, no smoke could be seen.&nbsp; I was stoned all day, every day, for four years or so, with a handful of one or two day breaks each year.&nbsp; Result:&nbsp; my short term memory was fucked.&nbsp; For example, when answering the phone at work and being given a name and phone number to relay to my boss, the only way I could remember it was by repeating the phone number in my head over and over during the 15 second walk it to me to cross the office and provide said information -- otherwise, I&#039;d forget the number and just tell my boss &quot;so-and-so called&quot; (assuming I didn&#039;t forget their name, as well).&nbsp; I started writing everything down after that happened a couple dozen times, and luckily didn&#039;t get fired.&nbsp; Being high all the time also made me extremely self-conscious and unable to talk to strangers of almost any kind.&nbsp; I developed this weird habit of closing my eyes while talking to anyone I wasn&#039;t comfortable with (which was almost everyone, at that point).&nbsp; I quit smoking at 22 for half a year, and my brain was mostly back to normal after that.&nbsp; Then I started using cocaine.&nbsp; After building up my tolerance quite a bit (took me three months), I was blowing 1/4 oz. of high quality cocaine every day (befriend a respected Mexican gang member in California, and you&#039;ve got a good chance of getting amazingly pure and inexpensive coke whenever you want).&nbsp; That lasted for another month before my family found out about my abuse and coerced me into rehab...&nbsp; Cocaine also made me extremely self-conscious; I would just lock myself in my room, take line after line and watch science fiction TV series.&nbsp; The only time I would talk to anyone was when I was shit-faced drunk (at which point I would also talk to everyone in sight).&nbsp; After rehab, I moved to a different city.&nbsp; My brain at this point was still pretty messed up, but at least I could talk to other people without giving them an unexpected, wild-eyed eyebrow raise, or some creepy, overly-focused stare.&nbsp; I was 23 at the time.&nbsp; Then I started using ecstasy.&nbsp; After building up my tolerance to that, I was taking upwards of 20 strong pills a weekend.&nbsp; Three months of that kind of usage lost me my computer-tech job with Sony, got me kicked out of my apartment, and had me living out of parks around the city.&nbsp; As soon as I was homeless, I quit everything -- I was 24 at the time.&nbsp; The first three months were shitty.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t speak a complete sentence to anyone.&nbsp; I would stutter no matter what I tried to say, and I was suicidally depressed on top of it all.&nbsp; My mother let me move back in with her after three months of homelessness, with the stipulation that I go to the local community college full time and work full time.&nbsp; After my first semester in college, during which I studied intensely the entire time, the fog in my brain started to lift.&nbsp; After a year and a half, my brain was in perfect condition.&nbsp; I ended up getting accepted and transferring into one of the best computer engineering programs in the world after my fourth semester.&nbsp; During all that time in college, however, I never touched a drug, albeit caffeine.&nbsp; I&#039;m still in the engineering program, though I took this semester off because of, guess what, stimulant abuse!&nbsp; Drugs are fun, but they can fuck up your brain.&nbsp; My experience has shown that at least that fuckedupedness is not long lasting, so long as you exercise your brain to enable it to heal more quickly.&nbsp; Otherwise, I suspect, you&#039;ll stay fried much longer.&nbsp; Good luck.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; 5-HTP supplementation does not seem like a healthy thing to do.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Take ecstasy, you feel shitty the next day.&nbsp; Take ecstasy, but then take 5-HTP the next day, you feel fine.&nbsp; This indicates you&#039;re elevating the serotonin levels in your brain to feel &quot;normal&quot; the day after taking ecstasy.&nbsp; This might lead some to assume they&#039;re helping their brains by keeping serotonin levels stable, but that&#039;s not the way nature works.&nbsp; Action, reaction.&nbsp; If you party hard, expect to feel really good, then really shitty.&nbsp; Keeping neurotransmitter levels artificially high to feel &quot;normal&quot; after taking a neurotransmitter-depleting drug is only going to ensure your body takes longer to heal itself.&nbsp; 5-HTP is not neuroprotective by any properly-controlled studies that I&#039;ve read.&nbsp; I will admit that 5-HTP does help you feel less shitty the days after a good roll; I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s good for you in the long run.&nbsp; All in all, however, taking 5-HTP after a roll is not going to significantly decrease healing time (i.e., increase brain damage).&nbsp; It&#039;s too mild to make much of a difference either way.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t take it regularly, otherwise you might really do some damage.

Let me extend and revise what you said. &quot;Drugs are fun, but they fuck up your brain if you are careless&quot;. You should always respect what you are taking and research what you&#039;re doing to yourself. Have a goal and reason for taking a substance and know your own personal limits.

				A couple of seconds can be enough. Just consider cigarettes - you don&#039;t need to hold the smoke down for long to feel the effects of nicotine at all.<br /><br />2 seconds may be too short an estimate, but it will not take more than a minute to get a substance you inhale into the brain. <br /><br />Inhalation is probably the fastest way to deliver a substance to the brain. Injection is more dramatic, but not faster per se - if you inject something it has to pass through the veins, take a round trip though the lungs and then get into the brain. Not that the difference in timing is that dramatic - inhalation can work to its brain in 10 seconds or so, injection takes under half a minute if your bloodflow is normal.
