				Going to try to keep this short, sweet, &#039;n simple.<br /><br />I wanna try mixing amphetamine-like stimulants with something for anxiety, since amphetamines give me this nasty jaw-clenching, almost paranoid feeling. I like the drive, focus, and energy they give, much more useful than other stimulants I&#039;ve tried, but I need something to take the edge off. Trying to be really cautious about it too, since I&#039;m hoping to do it to get stuff done, not for fun.<br /><br />I heard azapirones aren&#039;t as sedating and are less habit-forming, so I&#039;m leaning to that. I think Buspar and Sediel are all that been commercialized so far. Benzos have done bad things to people in my family, so that&#039;s something I don&#039;t want to screw around with. They haven&#039;t destroyed anyone yet, but they have left people really jumpy, neurotic, and passive-aggressive when they try to stop.<br /><br />Any thoughts or comments?

				First of all, if you&#039;re looking to get stuff done then try Ritalin, or methylphenidate.&nbsp; That gives you energy, focus, and keeps you awake.&nbsp; In my experience, people who use amphetamines get stuff done alright, but it&#039;s usually for projects that have no end; i.e., a friend of a friend was high on amphetamine and thought it would be great to do a little work on his car.&nbsp; He wound up disassembling the top end of his engine and was too spun out/tired afterwards to put it back together.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried xanax to cut the edge off of other stimulants like coke, but I keep finding that once the xanax kicks in, I get much less paranoid, feel better -- and want to go score some more coke.&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;ve tried Ritalin before. It works pretty well. Problem with it is that it dulls me in a way. Hard to describe. It&#039;s like I get the focus and energy I want, but it makes me more like a robot or a zombie. Makes my thinking more rigid. I have this task I need to do, so I do it and that&#039;s that. Things like Adderall, meth, that sort of thing, taken in a reasonably small dose, they make me more lucid. I&#039;ll need to be at the peak of my creativity in the coming months.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about pilfering some Xanax from someone. Seems like one in three or four people in my life uses it these days, so it&#039;s all around me. But I&#039;m afraid of how much it can fuck me up. Heard of someone trying Buspar with Adderall, but I got the impression that they just completely cancel each other out.<br /><br />I dunno, I might try Xanax once or twice to see what happens then lay off if I don&#039;t like it. But I&#039;d hate to see my nascent career sink just because I&#039;m going through a nasty bout of withdrawal.

				I&#039;ve never heard about the magnesium thing. Interesting.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t like Xanax. It takes away my inhibitions and messes with my memory. I suggest clonazepam or diazepam instead if you can get them. They relax me without making my head as cloudy.

				id highly recomend benzos<br /><br />i generally dont like uppers mainly due to anxiety but a small amount of benzos, generally 0.5mg xanex or 5mg tempazepam completely eases out the edginess of speed or ice for me and allows me to enjoy it

				1mg of clonazepam (Klonopin) or 5mg of diazepam(Valium) should be good to start. Everybody is different of course so you might need a little more or less. Start low since you can always take more if it&#039;s not enough but if you take too much it could dull your mind too much when you need to get things done.

				Magnesium is also very effective at countering amp tolerance. It won&#039;t reverse it, but it&#039;ll slow it down to an absolute crawl from the point you&#039;re at now. I&#039;ve been at my same dosage of dexedrine for god knows how long now, still as effective as it was during week 1. There&#039;s two kinds, and Magnesium OXIDE is the one you want. Magnesium stearate has a bioavailablity of like 2-5% or something stupid and won&#039;t do shit.

				Limechip, if you have not already purchased your&nbsp; Magnesium here is another piece of advice.&nbsp; Make sure you &quot;chelated magnesium.&quot;&nbsp; Chelated is bound with an amino acid that your body needs in order to acheive the effects you are looking for.&nbsp; That teeth grinding lock jaw neck tightening is really annoying isnt it?&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Also, on the day you know you are going to take amphetamine or whatever you are going to do take your chelated magnesioum with a meal a few hours prior.&nbsp; I take 500 mg with lunch and then pop another 500 after the event on the comedown.<br /><br />Also, you would be amazed at how many people make a mistake of buying manganeese!&nbsp; It is different altogether.&nbsp; If you talk to the employees at nutritional supplement stores they are a wealth of information.&nbsp; I used to disguise what I was up to and instead of saying things like we are going to raill some amphetamine paste I would say my doc put me on Ritalin ......&nbsp; then one day the this really cool hippy clerk said &quot;have you seen our section over there for recreational drug users!&quot;&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; That was many moons ago in the 90s L.a. area.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck!

				everyone has a different chemistry and different opinions, but for me:<br /><br />dextroamphetamine&nbsp; plus&nbsp; (clonazepam or alprazolam) - and baby you should be runnin real smooth.<br /><br />that&#039;s my stack when shit just needs to happen.

				I only know that benzos go quite well with amphetamines.&nbsp; They seem to just balance the effects of one another perfectly.&nbsp; Or taking a higher dose to comedown and sleep after.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had any benefits of taking magnesium but many people find it helpful.

				&quot;I&#039;m hoping to do it to get stuff done, not for fun.&quot;<br /><br />If you&#039;re having anxiety issues or speaking problems (public or performance type stuff), Google beta-blockers. Essentially, it slows your heart rate, so you remain calm.&nbsp; Many actors and speakers use it.&nbsp; In fact, a lot of pro-golfers use it - never worked for me!&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking this is what you&#039;re looking for... anxiety meds often create the &quot;cognitive fog&quot; that amphetamines lifts.&nbsp; I use Adderall and Bystolic everyday.&nbsp; Of course, be careful... don&#039;t want that heart beating too slow.<br /><br />

				beta blockers are great, <br />coupling propranolol with an amphetamine will put you in machine mode.<br /><br />only reason I use benzos more often is for the anxiolytic effects.
