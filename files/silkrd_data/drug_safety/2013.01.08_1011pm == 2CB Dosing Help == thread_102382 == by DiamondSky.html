				Hi there! So me and my girl have been playing with 2CB after our MDMA rolls and are liking it. Decided to order some powder instead of the pills we have been getting to stretch it out a little more. We just got .5 grams to start but I wanted to get some advice if anyone has it on getting the doses measured out just right. I have a cheap AWS .01 mg scale but clearly don&#039;t think that is going to do the trick for me. I know on Amazon I can get a .001 mg scale but I was curious if it would really be effective at the 10-25mg range. On my current scale, I can dumb a lot more than .01mg on the scale before it moves and I&#039;m worried the &quot;more sensitive&quot; is going to add more numbers but not any more accuracy.<br /><br />Since 2CB seems to curve up pretty aggressively as the dose increases I just want to make sure I don&#039;t get my girlfriend TOO high on the stuff.<br /><br />If the scale is the answer I&#039;ll just pick one up, I guess I mostly just want to confirm that they really do work OK at that level. My alternative idea was to just dilute the stuff but I wasn&#039;t sure how long it would stay and what the best liquid medium would be. We normally just plug the 2CB with some water but I didn&#039;t want to dilute .5 grams only to find out that the water killed the does over time if you know what I mean. Alcohol seems like it might work but with plugging I don&#039;t really like to put booze up there.<br /><br />Anyway, if anyone has a good answer for me would appreciate it. I&#039;m pretty sure the difference between 20mg and 30mg would be pretty significant and I know for a fact my eyeball isn&#039;t going to be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />Thanks and long live the Road!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Dont quote me on this, but I was doing some research yesterday for something similar but for 2c-p and from what I gathered all the 2c&#039;s were dilute able in water, but with various amounts per ml. My research seemed to suggest that it does keep for a good while as someone on blu light forums mentioned it keeping for a few years and only losing about 20% of its potency. <br /><br />It seems like a fairly accurate way to dose, and I think you can just drink it as well if you dont want to plug it. I guess in your case 0.5g diluted into say 250ml of water would give 2mg per ml of water.Looking up there now confirms that the hcl will dissolve but it takes a bit of work and maybe some light heat. <br /><br />You could weigh out 100mg as a starter on the scales you have and dilute that as well and see if that works.

				<br />Quit screwing around and get an .001 scale. The ones on amazon for like $20-$25 bucks work fine. They come with weights to recalibrate and such. That&#039;s what I have. I had the .001-10grams scale, then I bought the .001-20grams scale as well. Same company. <br /><br />Scales are most accurate in the mid range of the max and minimum. So when I am dealing with 2cb doses what I do is place a piece of paper on the scale that is a few grams (or piece of cardboard), then push the tare button (zero it out). Then you tap out 10, 15, 20mg, etc. Put in a gelcap for later (can get a health food store). <br /><br />When measuring such small doses you have to make sure there is no moving air in the room---fan or heat/air cond. Fluctuations in the air make the scale go up and down wildly. Also don&#039;t breathe on the scale or you will see it move as well. <br /><br />Do this and you&#039;ll be good.

				Yeah I guess that was mostly what I was wondering is if those little Amazon scales would work all right. I can pretty well eyeball 100mg MDMA with enough confidence that I won&#039;t be sending anyone to the ER even if the scale I have now isn&#039;t too sure if it&#039;s 90mg or 120mg. Truthfully though if it&#039;s water soluble as mentioned by soralangg (thanks!) I&#039;ll probably cut it into points and dilute it since me and my GF seem to be about 25mg dosers each and that would be a good half now half next time deal.<br /><br />I&#039;ll end up getting the .001 scale eventually though since it sounds like it&#039;ll do the trick. The little guy I have right now doesn&#039;t inspire confidence even in the .01 range so I just thought all the cheap ones might be the same only with more zeros.<br /><br />Thanks All!<br /><br />

				I have a gemini mg scale off amazon and it works great. I use it for DMT and MDMA amongst other things. <br /><br />As for your 2cb dosage advice, that stuff does indeed ramp up pretty aggressively. 2CB is more forgiving than say 2c-e but it can be prettyyyyy powerful at high doses.<br /><br />A good dose for me was always 25 mg. I got lots of visuals and nice body load from 25mg.<br /><br />50mg or more and people would start to get a little freaky, and lose touch with reality.<br /><br />100mg+ is ego death territory and quite frankly I wouldnt want to go there.<br /><br />Anyway have fun, legit 2cb is a great drug.

				...water works.... and i usually run it at 25-35mg range for my personal dosing so as u can see there is a lot of&nbsp; lie-way there to where your scale wont be the deal breaker... now i noticed u said u were plugging this, some friends and i have tossled the idea around but none of us has done it... from what i understand absorption goes from some 30% orally to 90+% rectally so i would dose in fractions accordingly...

At 20mg plugged me and my girl were definitely high but not too high. Some nice visuals, good body high, not too distracting since we eventually went to bed while still feeling it. I want to try it a few more times with a couple of different samples though because my plugging experience has always been more bio-availability but this felt about like what a 20mg oral does should feel like. The plus side was a faster come up with less of the &quot;am I feeling it yet&quot; game. It definitely was not all at once though, about an hour plus in me and her walk around the house for a bit and were like, we are definitely still getting higher...<br /><br />Oddly, I tried a much smaller does plugged on my own (5-7mg) and got a nice light body high off of it but none of the visuals (maybe a little color enhancement and second looking but minimal). So it seems to absorb great but I suspect the dosing is really close to the oral dose which would make this unusual as far as other compounds I have tried that ROA with.<br /><br />If you ever do try plugging I strongly suggest trying it alone with a drug you are comfortable with. First time I tried it with my GF I had no idea what we were doing and mostly just squirted drugs all over her ass which didn&#039;t get her all that high..

				I wouldn&#039;t dissolve 2c-b in water. It might prove a challenge and even impossible. It&#039;s quite soluble in alcohol though. From my understanding drugs are even more stable in alcohol as well. I didn&#039;t have a scale at all when I bought my 2c-b, so what I did was putting the whole gram in half a liter cheap vodka and then measured the dose with a syringe. One ml equals two mg 2c-b.<br /><br />So just measure 100 mg or something with your fairly inaccurate scale and put it in a deciliter of some spirit and let it dissolve for a couple of hours. Should be about good enough with 2c-b.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend 25 mg as a first dose. Something more like 15-20mg&nbsp; to get to know the drug first, then increase if confortable. I myself dosed more or less 24 mg of quality product and went up really fucking high , unconfortably high.

I&#039;d say for me, 7-10mg is about threshold but it provides a nice mood elevation and body high. From what I can tell, increasing dosage beyond threshold seems to just add more to the visuals. I went up pretty high last night and the increased doses reaffirmed the body high from the initial hit but mostly got my eyes seeing some pretty fun visuals.<br /><br />Unlike a MDMA for instance where it&#039;s important to take a get high dose to start with, 2CB lasts a good long time in the system and it&#039;s really easy to start small and add more once you know where it is taking you. The key is understand that 2CB hits in layers. You get pretty high and then you get higher. The come up can take as long as an hour after alerts so if you start small you just want to make sure you are all in before you go take some more. As far as taking more, I normally plug my first does (it gets in you a little faster vs. oral) and then sniff any extra I want to do. Burns a little to sniff the stuff but not nearly so bad once you are a little high :-&gt;

No less than 8 mg though. 8 mg combined with alcohol (and probably coffee at least some of the times) makes me in a really, really good partymood. It&#039;s quite stimulating and makes me smile a lot. I really like myself and my thoughts. It makes me unreactive and takes away negative thoughts. No psychedelic confusion. It boosts my confidence quite a lot. Some people I have taken it with seems to a bit sensitive, open and feeling á la MDMA. I don&#039;t get that feeling at all. It&#039;s more of a ego inflation for me, but in a quite honest way, not superficial. It just gives me a really good state. Except the first time. I was quite tuned in to the music and everything was more enjoyable. I was more accepting and able to tune in to whatever happened, when I&#039;m normally gets a bit pissed of when someone is playing music I don&#039;t like, I was able to enjoy it this time.<br /><br />Okay. Now it sounds like this is some super fucking amazing party drug. It is, in a way. But it&#039;s subtle. Some people I have given it to say that they don&#039;t really feel it. That I find strange, but they might expected something like MDMA. <br /><br />Higher doses so you can understand my tolerance to the drug:<br /><br />10 mg gave me a bit to much body load for partying. Too stimulating and made me restless.<br /><br />14 mg was slightly confusing and quite psychedelic. I did it alone in a club. It was cool, but too psychedelic to be in public with people you don&#039;t know imo. <br /><br />20 mg is quite psychedelic, but not very visual.<br /><br />26 mg is more visual, but still only slight.<br /><br />32 mg is quite a bit visual, but seems to be about as visual as many of my friends says 20-25 mg is for them.

				Thanks to both of you, Diamond Sky and Happy Kitten ! Your reports are exactly the kind of information I was looking for : 2CB as a mood enhancer (and all its subsequent benefits). When coming up on 2CB, I had a hunch that this drug could do wonders in terms of mood elevation at low doses. And Happy K, the point about ego inflation is fascinating, really&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to try 8mg. I&#039;ll report back here.
