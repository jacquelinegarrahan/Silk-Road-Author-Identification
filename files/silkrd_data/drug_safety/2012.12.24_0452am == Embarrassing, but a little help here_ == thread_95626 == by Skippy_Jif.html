				Aside from trying to create a new user name and miserably failing this may work......<br /><br />So, I was cleaning up some lab equipment(and I really mean cleansing, not some BS attempt at rewording getting high) and I think I may have ingested/absorbed some nbome. It has happened within the last 4 hours and the effects are coming on somewhat strong, but not too overwhelming. Obviously I&#039;m coherent(or at least I think so, LOL) and there isn&#039;t too much for concern, but is there any safety precautions I need to take in consideration so I don&#039;t have to go to the emergency room?<br /><br />

				Unless you took a bottle of NBOMe and drank it than you&#039;re fine. There&#039;s no possibility of overdosing or getting addicted to it as far as I know. If it&#039;s been 4 hours than you&#039;re over the worse part of it, and you&#039;ll be back to normal soon.
