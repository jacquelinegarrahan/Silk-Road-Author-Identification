				i&#039;ve tried both and have had different results.&nbsp; heroin and meth for me seem mutually exclusive...the meth always overpowers the H and doing H just amplifies the basic meth high.&nbsp; now doing some H at the far tail end of a meth buzz might be nice tho..&nbsp; &nbsp; however with coke and H the effect is the opposite..&nbsp; the coke amplifies the H.&nbsp; i prefer substance following substance polyuse nowadays.&nbsp; and H following coke is the best.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />*destiny*

				I&#039;ve had experience with both. Heroin/meth never works out for me too well, since it usually makes me feel like more meth, which has led to some scary near-OD situations. <br /><br />As far as heroin/coke... it&#039;s my absolute favorite thing in the world. I&#039;ve yet to experience something that can provide more physical pleasure than an IV speedball. Stopping the heroin after the first shot or two then just hitting the coke while the heroin high is still going strong is a great experience too (don&#039;t want to od). Only down side is I hate puking and my stomach is very sensitive to IV coke, so I have to use much less than most people per shot.

				So H and coke it sounds gives the most pleasure. Thanks for the tips, so do you go 1:1 ratio on coke to H or something a little different?

				If you try it let me know the ratio you used and how it was for your first time trying it and lessons learned. Like did you do them at the same time or different times and what would you do different next time.

				bsalt...going all the way back to The Beluschi Era...a Speed Ball or Spit Ball is a 50/50 or 1 to 1 Ratio of H to Coke. <br />HOWEVER, Beluschi had a huge Tolerance and he Over did it!<br /><br />Since the typical starting dose for IV&#039;ing Big Boy drugs like Opana, H and Diluadid is 2.5 Mgs..I would start with 1 mg of H and 1 mg of Coke.<br />You can always go up, but if you over buzz you cant go back.

				If your going to do this BE CAREFUL<br />remember when combing drugs they can synergies to produce an effect much<br />greater than each drug individually so do smaller amounts than usual.

				Ya I thought of him too when I thought of trying it. But he was a full time pro at it, very high tolerance. I am gonna wait for the coke section to settle out a bit before I try. But to have that coke rush with the H euphoria will be unreal. This is gonna be a fun ride.

				Tolerance is the biggest factor when it comes to dosing, but if you have no tolerance to either 50mg of both would be a good starting point if both were very high quality. Might be safer to go even less with some of the nearly pure stuff around here. Always start small and go up.

				I&#039;ve never done H, but I enjoy my prescription opiates.&nbsp; Years back at a New Years Eve party I discovered the joy of mixing coke with oxycontin.&nbsp; Since I have never done H I can&#039;t compare a speedball to my mix of oxy and coke, but it is a very nice buzz.&nbsp; It surprised me how the high was nothing like I figured it would be... it wasn&#039;t just 1 + 1 = 2, more like 1 + 1 = x?&nbsp; Just a totally different feel from the high of either one.&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda going on a bit of rant, but I think my original point was that oxy isn&#039;t a bad substitute.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve always snorted it, never smoked or injected.

				hybridmike had both around new years (and he seems like a decent seller, but no personal exp).&nbsp; option to get small quantities of either as well which was kewl (for the user on a budget like myself).&nbsp; i went for mdma instead and seems he must have got out of the H but he gets strong scripts every now and then (oxy, hydromorph).&nbsp; <br />this is of course if ur like me and want to keep ur shipments limited, otherwise pick two good people.<br /><br />*destiny*

				I think it is really dangerous what you guys talking about and planing to do. I do it iv and you can&#039;t even say you need this amount or this because it depends on you and the quality of the h and the coke. I had coke many years ago, a really little amount of it to much (speaking about less than a head of a match) and over. From the last batches i had i can take much more. So you don&#039;t know. What happen. Star with a very little amount, look what happen and go on....<br />

				I&#039;ve been meaning to try those combinations for a little while, now. I&#039;ve got all of those stocked. My ROA is going to be smoking, though. I&#039;m not ballsy enough to IV, and snorting usually seems to cause more problems than it&#039;s worth.
