				I did 28mg 2cb and a defqon (150mg+ mdma) a few days ago. I&#039;ve never felt so amazing in my life. So happy, crazy orgasmic body high, so many colors and shapes, etc. I&#039;ve yet to candy flip but that&#039;s probably up next. I was also with my girlfriend.

				Well I&#039;m assuming you just mean combo in general, right? Cause I&#039;ve never taken 2C-B.<br />Anyway, my fave is definitely Heroin+Coke IV&#039;d (speedball). What can I say? I&#039;m scum and I know it. I just don&#039;t think anything could ever take first place after experiencing that rush, at least IMHO.

				Could someone kind of explain the 2C-B experience to me? I&#039;ve never tried it and I&#039;m just curious what it feels like. I&#039;ve done E plenty of times, and shrooms a few. Never tried acid though. Is there anything I might be able to relate the feeling too?

				i can&#039;t speak for everybody but my experience:<br /><br />yeah 2c-b is very much like acid but more visual and not as giggley. it was for me anyway - a kaleidoscope of colours and patterns dancing in front of your eyes. acid is a bit like shrooms but far more intense, and if you are having a heavy one with shrooms you can lie down in a dark room and it calms you down - with acid that doesn&#039;t happen, if you have a bad one it&#039;s your tough luck and you have to ride it out.<br /><br />felt like my brain was &#039;resetting&#039; every 30 seconds or so, can&#039;t really describe what that means though, but i&#039;ll try: whatever your train of thought was went back to square one after 30 seconds or so. make sense?<br /><br />i had a really intense experience with it. weren&#039;t keen at all on the body load, i had really bad tremors with it. when i did it after doing an E i had a much better time, the body load was nothing.<br /><br />time slowed down immensely as well.<br /><br />can&#039;t focus on SHIT - took me over an hour to skin up, but because time was going so slowly it felt like it took a good 3 or 4 hours<br /><br />good times ;)

Going into a dark room to get rid of a bad shroom trip would be the worst thing I could do. I personally find acid trips much more lucid and easy to control. Haven&#039;t tried 2c-b yet, really want to. My favorite combo? Probably a shit-ton of molly, ketamine, and lsd consumed over a 18hr period the other weekend. Pretty epic.&nbsp; :o

				LSD (a nice quantity) + 2CB is visual heaven. Very nice combo.<br /><br />LSD + MDMA at tail end + Ketamine = Wonderland.<br /><br />MDMA + Ketamine = also Wonderland.<br /><br />LSD + Ketamine = yuck!<br /><br />Don&#039;t know why but I really don&#039;t like K without MDMA in the mix.

				I had 2C-B for the first time last fall, and it is a very interesting little compound. I would LOVE to try it again with some MDMA this time.<br /><br />What would be a good dosing schedule? Should I dose like a candyflip (MDMA about 2 hours after LSD)?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				A gram of hash in a chocolate medium and 20mg of 2C-B.<br /><br />The experience was quite a bit more intense than necessary, but it was incredibly beautiful.<br />Next time I&#039;ll probably just eat less than half a gram of hash.
