				So I had an interesting experience using Ivory&#039;s MDMA and wanted to share and get some thoughts since I&#039;m a bit confused.<br /><br />I had been hardly waiting to test some of his MDMA and got a batch. Regent, Mecke and Simon tests were perfect! This stuff is textbook.<br /><br />Two of my friends and I (one girl, one guy) went to a show and decided to take it. Background: I have done MDMA 5-6 times in my life, most recent 3 months ago. The girl has done it only once also 3 months ago. The other guy, was his first time. All 3 of us are skinny and in shape (me - 165 pounds, girl-125 pounds, guy probably 140pounds). To start, I took 125mg, they each took 100mg.<br /><br />One hour later nothing for any of us. I took a 40mg kicker. At the 1 1/2 hour mark the guy said he was feeling slightly different. Myself and my girl didn&#039;t feel anything so took another 40mg kicker each. At almost 2 hours I was feeling some of the effects and so was the girl. I took another 40mg (so by now 245mg total). Shortly after I was rolling ballz!! The girl stopped at 140mg total and said she had a mild roll. The guy eventually took another 40mg kicker for 140mg total and had a decent first trip.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Me - 245mg (125mg with 3 40mg kickers) - no effects until about 1 1/2 hour later - rolled ballz for about 4 hours afterwards.<br />Girl- 140mg - (100mg with 1 40mg kicker) - good mild, clean roll<br />Guy - 140mg (100mg with 1 40mg kicker) - good roll, but not mindblowing like your first roll ever should be<br /><br />Question - What happened????? Clearly we all underdosed for the initial dose and the effects took forever to come up. I don&#039;t particularly have high tolerance to MDMA (usually roll balls off one US pill which are usually very weak) and my gf was out of her mind off one pill the first time she rolled 3 months ago.<br /><br />Did I get a weak batch? The stuff was fizzling and smoking when I tested it so it couldn&#039;t be. I&#039;m very confused since I have read dozens of posts about how 120mg of Ivory&#039;s stuff is plenty.<br /><br />Any thoughts? I&#039;m a bit confused right now...

				It&#039;s just very pure and you&#039;ve probably had contaminated MDMA before. I find I have very different reactions on it depending what I&#039;ve eaten that day. I&#039;ve had all three reactions you listed above for all three of you, from the same batch of Ivory&#039;s MDMA.<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely good stuff though!! And his 2C-B rocks too. Taking some of his 2C-B after the MDMA is like MIND = BLOWN!&nbsp; ;D

				140MG should be enough for someone who has done MDMA just a couple of times with no tolerance. However, do keep in mind that even if you have had the purest MDMA 83%+-&nbsp; you actually only took 106MG and if you spread this amount over a evening it&#039;s really just a threshold dose tbh. I don&#039;t want to support extreme drug use but from my personal experience if you want to roll &#039;normally&#039; take 180-200+ mg, with normally i mean just rolling in bliss at a nice setting, i wouldn&#039;t recommend this for a party as usually your legs feel like concrete with such doses (it&#039;s fine if you want to sit but i you want to dance, no.)<br /><br />- OS

				So what&#039;s a good recommended dose for partying?<br /><br />Last time I took 140mg + a booster of 100mg around an hour later (PF&#039;s molly), and it was a good roll. Would this be considered a heavy dose?<br /><br />tbh I was expecting more, as OP says. I&#039;m not a newbie to molly but hadn&#039;t done it in years, literally. I know about the disappearing magic and everything, and it seems to have started affecting me. I can still roll, but I don&#039;t feel that molly has that same intense effect on me as it did in the past. <br /><br />Any recommendations - with particular emphasis on Ivory&#039;s molly because that&#039;s what I am going to try next?

				I was fucked up, mind you. But it didn&#039;t seem to be a good, clean roll (I cannot explain it very well I&#039;m sorry). And I was left expecting a bit more. I don&#039;t know whether it was a dosage issue, a molly issue, or one of tolerance.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll try decreasing my dose rather than increasing it next time. Perhaps something like 100mg + 80mg would do the trick. That&#039;s like 140mg if you assume 80% purity.
