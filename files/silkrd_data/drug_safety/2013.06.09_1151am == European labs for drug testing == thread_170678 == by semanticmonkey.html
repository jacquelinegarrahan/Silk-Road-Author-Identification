				hello silk road users!<br /><br />about 1,5 year ago i&#039;ve tested a new substance called &quot;solaris&quot;. it was little white pill, 6 doses of very powerful psychedelic. i was pretty amazed of its effect and decided to find out what substance it is. google told me that &quot;solaris&quot; is a street name for nbome-2c-i. So i start to use it on a regular basis. But about half year ago by seller was arrested and i&#039;ve lost the source of this pills. and decided to buy it here, on silk road. i&#039;ve ordered some amount of nbome-2c-i from tyler durden and after testing it realized that this is completely different substance. It has similar time of action, but starting effects was much harder and visual&#039;s structure was absolutely different. And i liked first substance much better. <br /><br />so, couple days ago i&#039;ve got a chance to buy that old white &quot;solaris&quot; pills. and i want to find out what substance is REALLY inside them. <br /><br />i have heard that there are laboratories which can perform a test for any substance and tell what it really is. Can you please recommend me couple good ones, desirely not very expensive and located in europe. <br /><br />thanks in advance!
