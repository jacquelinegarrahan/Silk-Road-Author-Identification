				So having experimented with mushrooms for several years now, with every experience being highly euphoric and rewarding, I decided since I had discovered silkroad it was my time to try LSD.<br /><br />I bought 3 tabs from a reputable vendor, and a day or so later decided to take them, alone in my own bedroom as I had done so many times before with mushrooms. Set and setting and all that.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m going to try and break this up into sections to make it a bit more readable, but please try to bear with me here:<br /><br />19:00 - Took all three tabs at once (First mistake?), held in the mouth for 10 minutes or so, then swallowed.<br /><br />19:30 - I felt the tabs beginning to take effect, no visual distortions, just a sensation that something wasn&#039;t quite right<br /><br />19:30 -???&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know what happened here. The next thing I remember I&#039;m lying face up staring at the ceiling. My sister, having discovered me lying here is calling my name and asking a lot of basic face aid questions. (&quot;Does anything hurt, what have you taken, etc&quot;<br /><br />Sometime later - The first thing I remember saying is &#039;and that was that&#039;. EVERYTHING is moving and twisting, very very intense visuals. There&#039;s a blue green tinge to the walls and ceiling. I told my sister I had taken LSD. &quot;Yeah, your eyes are enormous&quot;. As she says this her face begins to distort into a snarl and turn a violent bloody red color. If you&#039;ve ever seen the &#039;smile dog&#039; picture thing, It was a little like that.<br /><br />Time is meaningless at this point - People morphing into insects, giant ungodly things with more eyes than I can count, blood red outlines, shocking white wings. So many stingers digging into my skin, I can still see my sisters face morphing into that insane grin. I am totally and utterly fucked at this point.<br />I begin to wonder if I&#039;m going schizophrenic, and keep asking the same questions again and again. Looping thought patterns. I can hear my sisters voice saying &#039;everything is okay, chill out I&#039;ve got you&#039;. I&#039;m screaming like an animal and thrashing around like a dingy raft in a whirlpool.<br />The only sane thought going through my head is how intense this is. I expected mild hallucinations, distortions of the reality I knew and loved. This was no kaleidoscopic hallucination, this was a full blown state of delusion. I&#039;m pretty sure I vomited sometime around here. <br /><br />At some point in the middle of this everything fades and I suddenly see space. Stars, ripples and rainbows and for about 30 seconds everything is relaxed and calm.. then back to the insects and madness.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure I was bleeding chocolate milk at one point, I could taste it. I don&#039;t even like chocolate milk.<br /><br />These nightmarish visuals repeating about 7 or 8 times until I begin the decline. Singing parts of songs seemed to help me calm down. The meaning of the word the word &#039;trip&#039; crosses my mind and I get stuck on that.<br /><br />I manage to convince myself that I have somehow crossed some kind of spiritual barrier, and that I was going to be trapped in this room for eternity. I felt that my sister was trapped there too.. all because of me. The guilt is soul destroying. The insects gradually fade to become shapes, like little pieces of glass floating in the foreground. These too eventually fade until only the corners of my vision and distorted, slightly blurry. <br /><br />4:00 - The next day. I&#039;m still tripping, still convinced that I&#039;m trapped in this limbo. Resigned to it. My sisters went to bed at some point, but has since returned and is sitting in silence.<br /><br />7:00 - I&#039;m back to reality.. still not sure what&#039;s real, not quite believing what happened.<br /><br />To cut a long story short, I haven&#039;t slept properly in about 3 weeks and certainly wont be experimenting with anything psychedelic for a loong loooong time.

				Psychedelics ask to be treated responsible because you can fuck shit up quite fast if you challenge the drug.<br /><br />Anyhow, bad experiences are not always bad because there is a lesson in every trip. I have learned a lot with &#039;darker&#039; experiences (don&#039;t like to call them bad trips).<br /><br />Every + has a - , remember that&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Shulgin.

				sounds like you experienced Timelessness and were also struggling against Ego Death.<br /><br />Timelessness can be infinite bliss... it can also be scary at first.<br /><br />This sense of Eternity is what scares some people from LSD. <br /><br />LSD is a very powerful spiritual molecule.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would suggest having a guide especially if you are prone to The Fear.<br /><br />

				I see &quot;Ego Death&quot; a lot on these forums, I should check this out on wikipedia as I have no idea what it is but it sounds unsettling.<br /><br />I have taken LSD four times in my life and it was a flop all four times. Well, I felt some trippyness like when you come up on shrooms when things just start to glitter/shimmer and paint on walls seems to run, but nothing noteworthy at all. I was always a bit apprehensive when taking it so I only ever took one &quot;normal&quot; tab at a time - 150ug? I&#039;m hoping the tabs were fake or rather feeble as I don&#039;t want to be immune to LSD lol! But I can&#039;t imagine having such a bad experience like you did by taking more than one tab but I can tell you one thing, I&#039;ll have at least 6mg of strong Xanax with me whenever I attempt a trip like you did, just in case as they can be lifesavers. Though, a thoughtful friend told me that merely making that provision sets you up for disaster so it&#039;s a catch-22 I guess.

It&#039;s when you&#039;re on the no-man&#039;s land between ego-consciousness and ego-annihilation -- that&#039;s when people have bad trips. If you take enough for ego death, it is the most liberating feeling on earth&nbsp; No fear, no anxiety, no paranoia. You feel lighter than air. You can do anything you want. It&#039;s also the best confidence boost you can get, because there&#039;s no ego defending itself all the time. Everything is done effortlessly.<br /><br />It is the initial stages of ego death that can be hellish for some people... but once the ego is finally dead, or rather transcended, it is pure bliss. If you are still experiencing fear, that means that ego death hasn&#039;t occurred, because it is the ego that is responsible for fear.<br /><br />It is possible for people with very strong or resistant egos to get &#039;stuck&#039; in this state of fear by holding on to their ego throughout the entire drip, even if they&#039;ve taken a dosage that would annihilate the ego of a typical person.<br /><br />The best thing to do is not to try to resist or control anything, but let LSD do what it wants with your mind. Like floating on water on your back. Have faith in the drug. And learn to meditate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158139.msg1113614#msg1113614">Quote from: happertand on May 11, 2013, 12:14 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I only ever took one &quot;normal&quot; tab at a time - 150ug?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Probably not.

				3 tabs is intense, especially for your first time. <br /><br />I did the same and was overwhelmed as soon as I started coming up. It felt like these waves were crashing into me and I was drowning on many levels. My mind was stuck on the fact that I was going to suffer brain damage. At some point I thought it was years later and my brain was simply reliving that one night. Everything felt like a memory and a few brief moments I feared that I was just someone&#039;s memory and was about to be wiped out of existence once that person stopped thinking of me. <br /><br />I ended up having anxiety and sleep issues for a while after that. Eventually I realized I had to go into the rabbit hole again if I were ever to get back to normal. So I went for 100ug and worked my way up. I think those first few small doses reversed the negative after-affects of that first trip. Everything after that was a quest to unravel how I ended up in that place to begin with. <br /><br />I have taken 3 tabs since and it ended up being a good trip. I&#039;m sure it was a combination of learning what I was getting into this time via lower doses and also having the hindsight of that bad trip. I was able to recognize everything that made the trip turn bad and what made it better this time. <br /><br />One of the sensations that was terrifying turned out to be euphoria. It was just so much more than I had ever experienced that I feared I must be doing a lot of damage to feel this much good at one time. Then there was an overwhelming sense of things being so right that it felt as though I had already lived it (leading to deja vu and thought loops). I also learned some basic meditation techniques to help keep thoughts from turning in on themselves. <br /><br />So if you ever feel ready again, start small :).

				Sounds somewhat similar to my first mushroom trip. It was my first time tripping and I experienced complete death of my ego and I was lost in &quot;timelessness&quot; to this day it still feels like I was curled up in the back seat for years. <br /><br />With that being my first trip I learned a lot and it didn&#039;t deter me, it actually made me want to experience a &#039;mild&#039; trip.<br /><br />Having such a powerful experience my first time I learned I needed to respect psychedelics and now every time I feel like I am going to a &#039;dark place&#039; I can very easily take myself out of that and everything is blissful again. You must always remember that all you have done is taken a drug and sooner or later it is going to pass through your system and you will return to normal. Depending on what you took from the experience.

				Take LSD in increments of 50.<br /><br />That is, first trip -- 50ug.<br /><br />Second trip (at least a week later, preferably longer) -- 100ug.<br /><br />Third trip (week later) -- 150ug.<br /><br />Etc.<br /><br />You will find your sweet spot if you do it this way.

				Anyway, you think this is bad? Guess what I did on my first acid trip? I took 5 tabs (of good, potent acid) in a fucking MALL. I didn&#039;t have any companions with me either.<br /><br />By the peak of the trip, I was standing in the middle of a busy intersection crying and mumbling insane things to myself, terrified of everything and certain that I was dead.<br /><br />Time was meaningless of course. I thought it would go on forever and ever.&nbsp; At various points in the trip, I thought that God (or the devil) was taking full possession of my body. At other times I felt that God was literally beside me. At other times I felt I was God. The hallucinations were profound, and indistinguishible from reality (lots of vines,&nbsp; snakes, and insects).

				I suspect taking a large dose like that the first time around was the culprit indeed. <br /><br />If you are taking a drug that is new to you, or from a new source, just start with small amounts.

One respected poster on this forum even says that 1,000ug of LSD is &quot;perfectly fine&quot; for a first trip. (His name is DMT-something or other.) <br /><br />The OP was probably just following the bad advice that is quite common on these forums with regard to LSD.<br /><br />Psychedelic people are often the worst for this. They just don&#039;t understand what a truly hellish trip is like. They everyone will react to high dosages of the drug the same way they do. <br /><br />LSD is an extremely powerful psychedelic. People nowadays underestimate it because they&#039;ve taken low dosages of the drug. Low potency trips are the norm with today&#039;s weak acid. But the LSD on silkroad is much stronger than typical street acid, I find. So be prepared for very powerful experiences.

				I once had a shitty trip like this from 25i-NBOME.<br /><br />Xanax was a lifesaver, i&#039;ll tell you that man. It stopped the trip dead on it&#039;s tracks in 30 minutes.<br /><br />But it was all in my mind you see. I knew I would be safe once I took the xanax. Before swallowing the 2 mg of xanax (which is quite a lot for me and will put me to sleep usually in no-time) I was scared I had overdosed and will die cause my heart was racing and my arms were twitching. It&#039;s some scary shit. I heard 25i has some speedy effects so I was worried my heart would blow up.<br /><br />But the SECOND I took the xanax pils and knew I was safe, that SECOND my trip went from bad to bliss. I felt so good because I was 100% sure the xanax would make everything OK (xanax/diazepam/benzos are known for killing trips and helping with stimulant overdoses, it is what is given in hospitals in case of cocaine overdose and for LSD/MDMA/psychedelics it will also kill the trippy side of things instantly, it inhibits the neurons from working so they won&#039;t be overcharged anymore). The xanax didn&#039;t kick in at all but my trip turned fucking great. I had an awesome blissfull trip for about 30 more minutes until the xanax kicked in after which all visuals stopped (before I was getting insane visuals and after I didn&#039;t almost see anything), all the confusion stopped, I was sobered up. A bit woozy, but sober.<br /><br />So I realized it&#039;s all in the mind.<br /><br />I also realized that if you try and fight the drug you&#039;re trying to fight yourself. And since psychedelics enhance all emotions and states of mind, the fight with yourself turns your reality into a real horrifying struggle. It&#039;s only when you stop fighting, when you accept your trip, when you accept your future, when you accept everything that will come, that is when the trip will turn good.<br /><br />You were worried that you might have become a schizophrenic, that you would somehow permanently lose your mind - these worries are the things that destroy your trips. Once you accept the fact that OK you might be a schizophrenic and you might or might not be like that but it&#039;s irrelevant since you can&#039;t do anything about it anymore - even accept death if that&#039;s what you&#039;re afraid of. That&#039;s the key, accepting whatever comes next. Accepting yourself. Don&#039;t fight your fears, understand they are a part of you and live with them in peace :)<br /><br />Easier said than done, I agree. But it can be done.

They won&#039;t be able to handle it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />wow dude, you&#039;re kind of a dick, and really making clear the points I&#039;m trying to make about LSD being inferior.&nbsp; you&#039;re so spiritually evolved, yet you talk to yourself (me) with such contempt and superiority.&nbsp; Also that last bit about maybe I&#039;m some villain trying to keep people from learning about acid hints that perhaps you&#039;re indeed delusional or at least paranoid.&nbsp; the only thing missing is some line about the &quot;illuminati&quot; or &quot;zionists&quot; trying to control the minds of the masses, lol<br /><br />You&#039;ve made a number of assumptions about me that are simply not true.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken lots of acid, man, in small, medium, large, and mystery doses.&nbsp; paper, liquid, geltabs...lots of acid.&nbsp; i used to have a couple friends like you who were religious zealots about LSD.&nbsp; i&#039;m a musician, and its part of our job to take lots of psychedelics to come up with original ideas.&nbsp; Also, i don&#039;t think mushrooms are better strictly because they are older, though that does help.&nbsp; I find the messages they send are more concise and applicable to everyday life.&nbsp; I agree with you that ketamine is a wonderful drug, though far less challenging than other psychedelics.&nbsp; i like it a lot though, and have had too many positive experiences to count.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think anthropomorphizing chemicals is moronic.&nbsp; I quite enjoy Animist religions and folklore, and find it to be an excellent way of articulating abstract opinions regarding these drugs.&nbsp; can you really deny that they all have their own personality?<br /><br />Take note, readers, of this man&#039;s tone &amp; disrespect for others&#039; opinions and, not coincidentally, his declaration of solipsism as truth.&nbsp; this is a man who has taken enough acid to convince himself that he is the only person in existence, and thus the only one that actually matters.&nbsp; i wouldn&#039;t be surprised if he secretly thinks he is a messiah, but is too afraid to declare it so.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent years and years in various corners of the psychedelic underground and have met more self-righteous acid worshipers than I can count.&nbsp; These people walk around with their third eye open and their other two closed.&nbsp; if you step back and think about it, its almost kind of funny, like their unwittingly the victims of a cosmic practical joke.&nbsp; unfortunately i usually can&#039;t step back from it because I have to deal with these people, and its just fucking annoying.&nbsp; they break out of the box and then build a nice little dome around them where the box used to be.<br /><br />I&#039;m not gonna argue anymore, or defend against your dismissive attitude towards DMT.&nbsp; And I&#039;m sure you think Ayahuasca is just old world superstition too... some dirty plant concoction that can&#039;t even begin to reveal anything more about reality than the all mighty LSD.&nbsp; <br /><br />your post speaks for itself, and you&#039;ve clearly already got the whole world figured out.&nbsp; so congratulations!&nbsp; enjoy your life of enlightenment :)

				This reminds me of my first bad trip, although I didn&#039;t have anyone there to support me through it. Although maybe that made it worse.<br /><br />It took me a month or so to feel better. Just be strong and you&#039;ll get through it. It&#039;ll probably take you a good 6 months before you ever try anything again but that is part of the stage to recovery. Having a good experience. I candy flipped and made sure it was a great environment to minimize the risk of anything as bad again.<br /><br />Life is just a series of experiences, good and bad!

It really doesn&#039;t matter what drug it is, the worst thing that can happen with a small dose is &#039;nothing at all&#039; - which would be a waste of money, but otherwise just fine.<br /><br />Taking it slow really is best for virtually all drugs: alcohol, cannabis, benzo&#039;s, barbiturates, opiates, hallucinogens, do not overdo any of them on a first attempt. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bit like putting salt on food: adding some more later on is a lot easier than taking off too much you put on in the first place. The difference is that too much salt will ruin one meal, and too much dope can ruin a decent part of your life in a single serving.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think this could also be the result of bad advice that is often given on these forums.<br /><br />Many times I have seen people on these forums recommend that noobs should take 300ug or more of the drug. One respected poster on this forum even says that 1,000ug of LSD is &quot;perfectly fine&quot; for a first trip. (His name is DMT-something or other.) <br /><br />The OP was probably just following the bad advice that is quite common on these forums with regard to LSD.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This may be the case - advise on dosages can wildly vary, and some are intended for novice users while others are intended for people with extensive experience with similar substances. <br /><br />It&#039;s like trying to answer how much beer one should drink to get a decent effect. If the person asking has never taken any alcohol before i&#039;d say a can, may be two. If the person asking drinks a bottle of wine a day but never had beer before, i&#039;d say &#039;half a case&#039;.<br /><br />I would strongly advise to err on the side of caution whenever taking a new substance, even if you have experience with a similar substance. Just take 1/10th of the recommended dose once to see what happens. Probably very little or nothing will happen, which is all good. But if you are, for any reason at all, overly sensitive to the substance you can save yourself a lot of hardship while retaining 90% of your stash for later.&nbsp;
