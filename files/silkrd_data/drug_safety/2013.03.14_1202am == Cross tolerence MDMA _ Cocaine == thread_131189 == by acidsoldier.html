				Go through the amount of MDMA as you see fit and as the peak is wearing off start railing the Coke. Make sure you pre/post load properly with the right vitamins though, and you might want a few Xanax or something for the comedown because it ain&#039;t gunna be pretty. <br />Word of advice... Don&#039;t rail the coke before taking MDMA as it can dull the effects (I&#039;m sure someone will comment explaining why, I&#039;m not sure off the top of my head) and be sure to stay hydrated!

				Its almost impossible to roll longer than 8/9 hours without just achieving the stimulating effects of MDMA as you deplete your serotonin, so I would start with a 120mg bomb of MDMA then just bump your way through the mandy until you can no longer peak from it, then start bumping the coke! Will be a good night for sure man, comedown will be shit though.

				From my own experience, if you take the coke first it kind of kills the MDMA. <br /><br />I would drop your usual dose of MDMA, wait until you up and then start railing the coke. Once you feel more &#039;coked&#039; than on the Molly, then drop another 50-100mg of MDMA. <br /><br />As long as you don&#039;t take the coke first you&#039;re going to have a wicked time. <br /><br />Have fun&nbsp; :)

				through my personal experience snorting coke before mdma doesnt affect my roll,however i do make sure to wait at least an hour from my last line to drop the molly.<br /><br />whatever you do,dont touch the coke while your peaking.i done it once after a rave,still rolling hard sniffed the line then...bang i was back to normal,never again.always wait till the effects are wearing off or youll just ruin the roll.<br /><br />all in all looks like youre gonna have one hell of a ride<br /><br />good luck with the comedown&nbsp; ;)

The leathal dose is over 5000mgs. Personally ive had a gram to myself, or 5-6 pills (200mgs like partyflocks or defqons) multiple times during a session. It is overkill though. When you have that much you can expect to be rambling nonsense, shaking, sweating not remembering what you said 10 seconds ago. I find cocaine kind of levels you out when high on mdma.

				Well from what I have hear MDMA+Coke = No Good<br />Cant remember off of the top of my head so u may google it or something but MDMA+Coke can be a bad combo.<br />I kno for a fact that once all of your serotonin is depleted you will have dopamine floating around and attatching to your serotonin receptors.<br />Dopamine is HIGHLY neurotoxic to your serotonin receptors.<br />When you do a line of coke it is a SDRI or maybe its DSRI? all I kno is it works like an ssri but with dopamine.<br />So when you do it it releases dopamine but doesnt let it return into the dopamine receptors... Well these dopamine will be looking for receptors and hey guess what?? You have empty serotonin receptors.. Bad combo and highly advise against it...<br />Im REALLY surprised that no one has brought this up yet....<br />You really should research more about this before you try it..<br />I hope I helped&nbsp; ;D
