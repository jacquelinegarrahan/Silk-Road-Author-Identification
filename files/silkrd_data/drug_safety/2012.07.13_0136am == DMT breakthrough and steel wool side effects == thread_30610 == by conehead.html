				So for lack of a better word, I met god today. what an amazing experience. It is by far the scariest at first (because it is overwhelming as fuck) but it is the cleanest / best feeling trip I&#039;ve ever done. You &quot;wake up&quot; and feel 1000% good, like you just woke up from an amazing afternoon nap, straight out of a dream.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had 4 doses so far. I did two yesterday by myself where I did it alone. Both times I only took 1 hit but I put the flame too close to the steel wool and I&#039;m certain (because of the taste) that I was smoking the steel wool. Both times I had the &quot;carrier wave&quot; high pitched buzz and audio halucinations. It also had a different effect including some nausea. It also felt terrible on my lungs and had a horrible taste.<br /><br />I had two doses today but it was professionally administered. The flame was carefully kept 1/4&quot; from the steel so there was no burning and I took three hits. Neither time did I have the negative effects from the first two doses. Even the smell was non-existent. There was no carrier wave. I literally started to trip with my eyes open, handed the pipe to my friend and laid back, closed my eyes, and went into hyperspace. The second time was less so than the first, although it was barely 1 hour later. Still an immerse trip, but I opened my eyes half way through and there was less interaction with the dream people. My people are just regular people. No mechanical elves, no glowing energy Buhdas, etc. A black man was trying to coax me into a doorway that a little white girl was holding open. They were very nice. The black guy was very happy to see me. Total N.D.E.<br /><br />I&nbsp; thought I would mention it. I think some of the negative side effects people are having are side effects from poor consumption methods. Although for me, I&#039;m in charge of my motor functions enough to dose 3 hits all by myself and set the pipe down safely, I won&#039;t dose by myself again because I can&#039;t hold the lighter correctly. This is definitely a drug I&#039;m interested in experimenting more with. I&#039;ll probably buy some of the MAOI/DMT capsules so I can have a longer experience. I definately prefer vaporizing the raw crystal to changa though. Coughing sucks.<br /><br />If you are into halucinagens and have no done DMT, it should ABSOLUTELY be the next substance on your to-do list. It is very strong, very intense, but it is equally amazing and you feel fantastic afterward, unlike with some body-load psychs I&#039;ve had.<br /><br />I am so happy this showed up at my house unexpectedly and will be placing a large order with this vendor in appreciation of the quality product and loss on his part with a misshipment.

				I&#039;m new to DMT and have tried it a few times over the last week.

What surprised me a little were the people. I met &quot;god&quot; on a salvia trip once but salvia has some terrible side effects for me (makes me feel like a puppet and like my jaw is disconnected, plus the sweating.) It&#039;s seriously unpleasant. DMT has that buzz/euphoria that completely takes over, but it&#039;s over before you know it, and the effects are more intense than salvia (which I didn&#039;t think was damned possible.)<br /><br />I really feel like I&#039;ve checked a box on my bucket list. Everyone who is a fan of psychs should be trying this. What a fantastic drug. Also, tonight I had some intense and vivid dreams. I stole my brother&#039;s shoes? wtf?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30610.msg342412#msg342412">Quote from: sickboy on July 13, 2012, 06:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m new to DMT and have tried it a few times over the last week.

It&#039;s worked great for me, but I&#039;m loading 50mg so I may be wasting 10mg or more. I tend to have average tolerance to psychs though, so I doubt I&#039;m wasting much.<br /><br />I split the last ~40mg that I had.............................................. hahaha. I&#039;m going to try to hit the thing again and see if there is any still in there. This is definitely a drug I could see myself wanting to do more of. I was already shopping for pharmahuaska or whatever, but I don&#039;t think MAOI&#039;s are for me. I had problems with SSRI anti-depressants which I haven&#039;t taken for years. Plus I know this drug jacks my cardio system. I&#039;m afraid a 3-5 hour trip would be rough on my heart as I have high blood pressure.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30610.msg342483#msg342483">Quote from: sickboy on July 13, 2012, 07:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30610.msg342446#msg342446">Quote from: Gary Oak on July 13, 2012, 07:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30610.msg342412#msg342412">Quote from: sickboy on July 13, 2012, 06:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m new to DMT and have tried it a few times over the last week.

I mean I fucking met &quot;god&quot;, or at least someone/thing with a better understanding of metaphysics than any human ever had. Or maybe just a figment of my imagination. Who knows. haha.<br /><br />Unless you rig up IV DMT into a dripper with a flow-conrol device, I can&#039;t see it being fun recreationally. I think it&#039;s just too powerful of an experience to have with people you don&#039;t know/trust. Breakthrough experiences are the only ones worth having for me. Daytime-dosing is highly recommended. The visuals from less-than-breakthrough experiences are indeed fantastic, but they are also fleeting and you don&#039;t remember them well. It&#039;s the first drug I&#039;ve done that I think is sort of holy in a way.<br /><br />For me it&#039;s a dream. It&#039;s EXACTLY like a dream. While I scoffed at Joe Rogan for talking about it as if it was proven fact that it&#039;s the chemical released when you dream, when it is not and that is only purely conjecture, now I get it. It clearly plays a part of dream cycle although probably a much smaller dose than we are using combined with other chemicals. That would explain why dreams look like reality and we have more &quot;verbal&quot; interaction with those &quot;people&quot; than I experience with in my DMT dreams. Again, it&#039;s not scientifically proven, but having done the damned drug I&#039;m convinced! haha ;)<br /><br />On my last dose yesterday, I had a great geometric trip with the fractals twisting and moving, but there were little &quot;worker bees&quot; built into the mesh of colors. I saw lots of different dream people, which all seemed to be working to do something. Maybe they were stitching together the fabric of our shared &quot;reality.&quot; :) They had their heads down and were busy doing something with their hands. They noticed me, looked up and saw me, but quickly went back to work. It was very interesting.<br /><br />God damn. I&#039;ve gotta get away from the forums because the more I think and type about the experiences, the more I want to do more. haha. I think I should wait a while before I get more. I fear becoming a drug addict pretty strongly because I have a lot to lose. I don&#039;t want to become a member of the cult of Joe rogan (&quot;You should all smoke DMT and join my cult motherfucker!&quot;)<br /><br />So long, and thanks for the great experiences SR.

				the general consensus among DMT smokers is that the &quot;glass vapor genie&quot; is the absolute best way to smoke.&nbsp; totally smooth, no burning, easy to break through...<br /><br />it costs something like $100, but if you&#039;re invested in smoking DMT, you should really consider it.

I believe DMT is a fine starting place. Anyone who is going to try DMT should research his ass off, even if you are experienced with tripping. Anyone who is going to try it should also start with a very small dose. My first time I used 1 single hit with 40mg loaded into the pipe. It would have taken 3 hits to go into hyperspace, and probably 6-7 to actually get all the substance out of the pipe. Start with a small dose and acclimate to the body buzz and general idea of the drug. Work your way up to a higher dose and USE A BABYSITTER. This is NOT a party drug, and NOT a drug that you should do by yourself until you are very comfortable with it and able to do so safely. Even then it&#039;s very risky and you should probably use a babysitter for peace of mind if nothing else. My two best trips were with a babysitter and extremely profound.<br /><br />LSD in reasonable doses is a great place to start tripping. 2ci-nbome is a good visuals-only drug to try. I do not recommend ayahuasca until you are very comfortable with DMT. Although DMT is very fast to come up, knowing it will only last a couple minutes will help if things go bad. On Ayahuasca, you may be there for hours and have to work through it. I pity the fool!<br /><br />With any drug, read read read read read read. Take DMT seriously. It&#039;s not a party drug. I&#039;m not saying that some people can&#039;t use it casually, but the majority of information I&#039;ve read, seen, and experienced myself tells me that this drug is a spiritual drug. It should not be used for a &quot;good time&quot; except perhaps in the lowest of doses or by very experienced users. I had the most spiritual experience of my life when I was using it properly, as well as the very most terrifying experience of my life when I was attempting to use small doses casually.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m done with it for a while, at the least. It was a great ride and certainly mind expanding. It is absolutely my drug of choice now and the drug I would recommend to anyone interested in a seriously meaningful experience.
