				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m curious and I&#039;d like to hear what you know about cutting/diluting drugs. My questions:<br />1. How common is it that seriously harmful cutting agents are used?<br />2. What are the most common cutting agents?<br />3. How do cutting practices differ with specific drugs?<br />4. Most importantly, which can you generally expect to be the most physically harmful in the harder drugs: the chemicals left over from the production, the side effects caused by the drug itself, or the cutting agents if used?<br /><br />Street heroin seems to have the worst reputation. Maybe this is more of a scare tactic than anything else, but I understand that some street dealers will use substances like chalk or bleach to cut the H (tell me if I&#039;m wrong). Is it just me or is this literally the scariest part about non-prescription drugs? Then again I&#039;ve never experienced serious addiction so I can&#039;t speak about the other side of the coin.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the odds of getting goods cut with something as terrible as chalk or bleach is incredibly low in general, and microscopic on a place like SR. Still, I feel like it doesn&#039;t take much for one vendor to make a poor decision in hopes of profiting somehow. Cutting with research chemicals or something seems more likely, though.<br /><br />Also just to be clear, I&#039;m aware that even completely pure drugs are not something to take lightly as there is always a risk involved. I don&#039;t want any condescending replies, at least not along the lines of &quot;what do you expect it&#039;s a black market,&quot; haha.<br /><br />If you have links to articles about this kind of thing, I would like to see them as well. Thanks !

				Cutting drugs with something harmful is bad for business, you are not going to want to kill your client-base. Who&#039;s gunna buy your product? Corpses? Last I heard, dead peoples checks bounce. <br /><br />When you a junkie, nothing else matters in the world than your next hit and you are almost completely ignorant of the risks.<br /><br />Hope that clears things up for you.

				Obviously they wouldn&#039;t want to use something that would flat out kill on the first use. Maybe the bleach/chalk example is too harsh. I&#039;m pretty sure there have been cases of it but probably not many.<br /><br />I would really like to know what people have to say about the 4th question.

				Consistent maximum purity quality = Consistent Customers = Consistent expanding cash flow<br /><br />Cutting, like a bitch = whoever in the area that cuts less is the competitor = different cuts used by different people, better cuts, worse cuts? = Not consistent cash flow, you&#039;d also be a bitch.

				Cuttings means scamming your customers, no doubt about that.<br /><br />But as it is, many drugs are cut with various substances. These can be inactive like lactose, but also active like cutting cocaine with caffeine. Its mostly a street drug activity though, i doubt any cut drugs would be welcome on silkroad, and i have little doubt they would be discoverd soon enough considering the arsemal in analytical equipment being available between members here.

				Late response I know (thanks for the replies) but I found an decent example of what I was talking about. Apparently drnarco has been cutting his coke with something other than speed or caffeine. Several people have said that he cuts it with MDPV as there have been some horrible reports.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25324.msg395317#msg395317">Quote from: darkd on August 08, 2012, 02:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have no idea what was in this stuff, but it wasn&#039;t cocaine. I rocked some of it up after I received it and it turned a hideous neon yellow. After smoking it, I found that my eyes are having trouble focusing and I can no longer write by hand without extreme concentration. I don&#039;t know what the fuck this stuff is, but&nbsp; stay away!! hopefully my eyes and hands go back to normalâ€¦ <br /><br />Fuck this guy. I can&#039;t understand people who aren&#039;t honest about what their drug is. It is unbelievable that someone would be willing to play with other peoples minds like this. i don&#039;t know what the fuck was going through this seller&#039;s head other than greed, greed, GREED. Spend $100, buy some decent coke, cut it to 50% and it would still be 100x better than this stuff.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25324.msg429033#msg429033">Quote from: RexHarris78 on August 24, 2012, 07:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Don&#039;t buy drnarco&#039;s &#039;cocaine&#039;.<br /><br />My friend and I shared about a gram between us.

A very bad experience indeed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25324.msg407574#msg407574">Quote from: redlight on August 14, 2012, 09:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is NOT Cocaine.<br /><br />DO NOT under any circumstances buy from this vendor. Not sure if I&#039;m an isolated case or not, but his product fucked me up permanently in a bad way.<br />Used around 1.5g over 40 hours or so and was sent into a stimulant psychosis for 2 days. Straight paranoid schizophrenia, delusions, overheating, etc.<br /><br />He&#039; won&#039;t tell what he&#039;s cutting with, but I&#039;m convinced it&#039;s either straight speed or cut mdpv, most likely the latter. 25 days later I still don&#039;t feel right and feel like I damaged myself pretty seriously. It&#039;s very confusing though since I&#039;m still fully functional, just extremely &quot;foggy&quot;, feels like I haven&#039;t slept for a month. Psychological issues, still can&#039;t sleep for shit, sweating when it&#039;s not hot, etc. Will be seeing a neurologist/psychologist soon.<br /><br />If anyone has any experience with these types of symptoms after a massive dose of any drug, pm me. Could really use some input on my situation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Did I mention, it&#039;s the best-selling cocaine on SR.<br /><br />It&#039;s really, really not good enough to just say &quot;cutting with harmful substances is bad business.&quot; I get it, everyone here loves whacking off with the invisible hand and that&#039;s another issue, but there is no denying there will always be irresponsible vendors. If you are considering Drnarco&#039;s coke, like I was, you probably are not even an irresponsible buyer. I definitely consider myself responsible. At first glance I saw the guy has a 90% rating, and I looked at his listing for 1g &quot;good&quot; cocaine and assumed from the price and rating that he cuts either cuts it with speed, or he just has sub-par communication, or some had trouble with people not receiving their orders, or a combination of those things. That&#039;s usually what gets vendors a low rating, and besides, he is number 1 in sales. The risk here didn&#039;t seem that terrible, and I may have bought from him if I wasn&#039;t paranoid of low prices and responsible enough to actually read the feedback and especially the forum.<br /><br />So what I&#039;ve learned: ALWAYS READ THE FORUM as close as possible and don&#039;t buy unless other people have had consistently good experiences. And of course remember that addiction and LE are not the only threats! There can be harmful contaminants even on SR.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the full topic about Drnarco&#039;s coke.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25324.0
