				I&#039;ve ordered some changa from Asylum on SR. We (my wife and I) have done plenty of other psychedelics in the past, LSD, Shrooms etc. but this will be our first time using changa (haven&#039;t done DMT either). We chose it over dmt as from reading the forums and trip reports etc. it seems like a good gateway into the DMT domain and a more grounded trip, albeit slightly longer. <br /><br />We&#039;ve read conflicting reports about the MAO inhibitor in the changa. Is it important to limit ones tryptamine intake before/after even if the changa will be smoked? Or is it not necessary unless you&#039;re taking it by other means. Asylum&#039;s listing has a warning suggesting so. However from searching on the forums here I&#039;ve read posts from people saying it&#039;s fine to disregard this if you&#039;re smoking it (I wasn&#039;t really aware of another method for taking it tbh) It&#039;s really no problem to do so just to be safe, however is it needed? Do others take these precautionary measures or are we fine to just, well, have at it. <br /><br />

				Cheers for the advice. I&#039;ll report back when we&#039;ve done it. Not looking likely that it will be this weekend, hopefully early next week.

				since changa is smoked and it never hits the stomach there should be no need for diet. But i would do it anyways. just to be safe and because it feels awesome. Clean body feeling.

				Check out the DMT nexus for really good advice<br /><br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/<br /><br />Oral MAOI are what you watch your diet with, even then fasting for a day before and eating light for a few days after, and you will be fine. Avoid, alcohol, red meat, cured and processed meats, chocolates and cheese, especially fermented kinds, and bananas. They are high in tryptamine.<br /><br />But no MDMA with any form of MAOI smoked or ingested, that isn&#039;t safe.<br /><br />Break through with changa.<br /><br />Normally you need double the dose of DMT, but if you don&#039;t know the ratios then the best way is to, light a cone, take a small drag and then top up ever 10 minutes of so. You can keep your self in the zone for a while that way.<br /><br />You may get some tremors from the MAOI though, nothing to worry about, just a little unnerving feeling your body vibrate apart&nbsp; :o <br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wow. The feedback given is greatly received and much appreciated. Thank you all for taking the time to do so. Of course I&#039;ll fill you in on how it went. All things going to plan we&#039;ll probably do it next Friday. Oh the nervous excitement in anticipation of a new experience!

				Enjoy, ease your self in with changa, no need to toke huge amounts, build it up over a few puffs, each one will take you deeper.<br /><br />No more than an 40 mins to an hour. After that the tolerance is too high, you&#039;ll need to leave it for 24-48 hours. A week is better, and if you do breakthrough you may fine yourself leaving time naturally to just get over the experience. But in a positive way.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t hit a breakthrough first time, relax and come back to it again.<br /><br />Changa is more of a journey, rather than a trip.

				I&#039;d recommend to start with a minimal dose to get familiar with Changa, afterwards you surely can blow your mind by smoking avg. doses or even heroic ones.<br /><br />I&#039;m planing on smoking a heroic one next time I&#039;ll order some Changa.

And spot on about tolerance, before anyone touches DMT I&#039;d recommend reading DMT: The Spirit Molecule and read through Dr Strassman&#039;s findings. He gives people IV doses of DMT and finds that there is no difference in effect even on the third dose at 40 minutes intervals. Ergo, DMT has an incredibly short half-life and you most certainly do not need to wait a week before re-dosing for full effects.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>couldn&#039;t agree more. that book is a wonderful source of information. anyone interested in dmt (or psychedelics in general for that matter) should read it.

				Hey guys. Just checking back in. This arrived in the post today. Since I&#039;m mostly thumbs I&#039;m certainly not even going to try and get my McGeyver on by fashioning a vaporiser from a lightbulb and a coke bottle. I don&#039;t need foresight to know that wont end well, only past experience. <br /><br />As a contingency I have a bong there; which I&#039;ll probably use by filling a bowl with weed and the changa stuffed in the middle. We&#039;re going to head out now to see if we can buy a vaporiser/crack pipe or similar. Without giving too much away, where we live English wouldn&#039;t be the first language, and no, we don&#039;t speak the native speak as we&#039;re only here a couple of months. I anticipate hilarity.<br /><br />Later on tonight I&#039;ll check back in post-trip, If I&#039;m in any state to do so. Worst case-scenario it will be tomorrow. Thanks again for all the feedback.<br /><br /><br />

				Finally got around to this over the weekend! <br /><br />Really was a pleasant trip. Over the course of about 4 trips we did about half the bag; which weighed in at about 0.7g full<br /><br />We managed to pick up a Vapor-Genie to hit it with. Quite an acquired taste, the changa! I didn&#039;t mind it, however the other half had to mask it with some weed accompanying it in the bowl.<br /><br />I know they weren&#039;t exactly heroic doses by any means, but we thought it safe to take it easy as it was our first time. <br /><br />But sweet-mother-almighty regardless of the above we did fairly blastoff! <br /><br />It was as if someone just came along, gave you this big, warm, loving hug and lifted you into the naphta. I was always conscious of the fact I was tripping balls, which I&#039;ll assume was down to dosage, and as I said earlier was fine. I was looking at the coffee table during one trip and the wood stains on it coalesced to form this belly-dancing girl, moving in time to the music, It&#039;s funny, I can now, looking at the table, see the outline that triggered it. The OEVs overall are really quite animated, sparkly, but not intense. Music wasn&#039;t affected, it was just a welcome accompaniment as we drove down Moonview Highway :)<br /><br />The CEVs were incredibly detailed, mostly geometric patterns and fractals. At one stage I was watching these patterns move into a black hole, I was underneath it with a view of the funnel below. Time was never really knocked off any sort of linear path throughout. The trips lasted about 5-7 minutes each. It was funny as the both of us would come to at about the same time. We weren&#039;t talking to each other while tripping, just enjoying the ride. <br /><br />My other half said at one stage the place we live in transformed back to how they imagined it was in the 60&#039;s, complete with furniture, decor etc! <br /><br />I think next time we&#039;ll definitely hit a little more, was nice to test the water. I think we nailed the dosage for our first time. It seems like a love you could lose if you don&#039;t give it its due respect. Right now I&#039;m debating rolling a joint with just a wee sprinkle of it therein. Could be good for a giggle! <br /><br />Overall, really delighted with how it went.&nbsp; Thanks for all the advice. You guys really are the balls.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br /><br />
