				Has anyone tried both eazyjet&#039;s and CloudSurfer&#039;s MDMA? If so, did you find one stronger than the other one? How do they compare? <br /><br />I&#039;m trying to establish good dosing for CludSurfer&#039;s stuff, which I just received, and all the reviews seem to suggest to dose lower than normal.. so I&#039;d like to know if I should dose lower than with eazyjet&#039;sspecifically, who also got some strong stuff.<br /><br />Thanks!

				After not touching MDMA for almost a year, my girlfriend and I took 90mg and 100mg of CS MDMA respectively. After an hour we felt virtually nothing, so we took another 30mg and 40mg respectively. At that point our pupils were larger and there were slight waves of euphoria, but it left us both wanting much more.<br /><br />Planning to cap at least 140mg for myself sometime soon and give it a go.

				never tried CS&#039;s product, but if the above description is accurate and you don&#039;t feel much from 100 mgs of it, eazyjet&#039;s is definitely stronger. Had some of it a whole back, not quite as clean as Dutchaanbods, but 100 mg&#039;s of Eazyjet had me feelin it quite a bit, a nice medium strength roll.

				Just kind of my 2 cents, I used to roll off pills all the time back in the old days before the road and real drugs were available to all. I never tested anything or knew anything, just popped it into my happy little mouth and went along waiting to trip. Coming here and trying some MDMA I was sort of left a little underwhelmed. The stuff described as SuperTrips molly powder seems to be pretty close to great but even that was lacking a little bit of the physical push I was sort of missing from the old days. Grabbed a little MDA recently and that really did the trick for me, leading me to think that the pills I took were more MDA than MDMA in the past or I just like MDA a little better now a day.<br /><br />If 1.5mg/1kg isn&#039;t getting you going on MDMA and you get stuff off the road try adding a little MDA to the mix (most people seem to like 50/50 or 75/25 MDMA to MDA). I&#039;m pretty sure the pills I used to get were cut with at least some MDA if for no other reason than it&#039;s a natural part of the synthesis. I just use it with my GF to chill out and pure MDMA seems to make us talk and kiss while MDA adds a lot more teenage petting to the equation.
