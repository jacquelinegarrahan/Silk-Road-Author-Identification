				I have heard of it, but have not tried.<br /><br />If a few caps of actual, quality 6-apb fell into your hands then you are a lucky chap!<br /><br />6-apb was available a couple years to several months ago and it has slowly dried up so that now anything that you find is weak or not really 6-apb. Apparently it is very challenging to make.<br /><br />I have heard some incredible things about it. I&#039;ve read that it&#039;s a long come-up, a long ride, and a gentle comedown, with the euphoria of MDMA stetched out to nearly the length of an LSD trip. Anyone who says that it is &quot;safe&quot; compared to X is speaking out of ignorance. No one knows the consequences of taking 6-apb. The safety of its use compared to X is likely because many people do not experience a harsh comedown and feel fine the next day, compared to X which can be quite rough; but this is not indicative of safety. That being said, because it does not produce terrible after-effects, then if used sparingly, there&#039;s a good chance that it&#039;s not doing anything too damaging if at all, but again, this is just speculation.<br /><br />anyways, good find!<br /><br /><br />

				on bluelight there is a huge thread about it, I read some pages and someone say it&#039;s more powerful than mdma, but more powerful means more dopamine e serotonin depletion, and it&#039;s not good, at least not better than mdma if we speak about possible damage.<br /><br />I&#039;m far to know what really is and how it works, don&#039;t take my words for truth, but it makes sense.

				For those interested in 6-APB also check out PlanetExpress:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a90545fe08<br /><br />He&#039;s a newer vendor but he&#039;s been a pleasure talking with and his prices are the best I&#039;ve seen.<br />He offers 200 mg, 500 mg, and 1g listings. <br /><br />I just put an order in and I&#039;ll be reporting back asap.

From reading his report and comparing to the several reports I&#039;ve read from over the past few years, it sounds like 6-apb to me, albeit not as potent.<br /><br />I have not taken it myself, I&#039;ve only been very interested in it for a little while now and tried to learn as much as I could. Other reports I&#039;ve read mention no effects start until anywhere from 1-2 hours after dosing, then the come-up period is as long as 2 hours, slowly increasing in strength, then usually a 3-4 hour peak, then usually about 2-3 hours of gently coming down. The only difference in his report that I noticed is that his peak was only about 2 hours where other reports I&#039;ve read have mentioned a consistent peak for at least 3 if not more. <br /><br />With the few details that trippinface gave in his report it sounds pretty on par with a 6-apb experience, especially noting the similarity to MDMA/MDA euphoria, some visuals, length of effect and gentle come-down. I doubt it&#039;s cut with anything nor do I think it&#039;s another euphoric stimulant, but I guess a reagent test would be very helpful for this matter!<br /><br />When you mention that Fiberoptic is not getting consistent reviews are you referring only to vanquish&#039;s 120mg report vs. trippinface&#039;s 200mg report? I have been looking frequently but have not seen any other reports on the forums about FO&#039;s 6-apb, other than feedback comments on his SR vendor page.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested to see what other people have to say once more people try it. I will be one of those people as well as I have an order on the way from FO&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If I read correctly, FO sent out a couple hundred samples so we should see many more reports coming in other than from the two people that have written reports.

Lots of slow breathing as it came on as it kept building and building, but after 2 hours it never really turned into anything mindblowingly euphoric like other people have said. Maybe my expectations were high, but I mostly just felt kinda silly and content. It was very nice, but didn&#039;t quite get me &quot;there.&quot; Maybe I was comparing it too much to MDMA euphoria.<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway, I decided perhaps I hadn&#039;t taken enough so I decided to take more and eventually started railing 30-50mg lines. I finished off 300mg over 4 or 5 hours or so. Worst crash I have EVER experienced. Not an emotional crash at all, but physically I felt like I had been hit by a truck. With that high of a dose things got quite visual though. Some really weird stuff too. For example, my gf had gone to bed, upstairs, but as I was laying on the floor downstairs just zoning out and getting lost, I would start to think my bookbag next to me was her. I would be totally convinced that she was sitting next to me and then I&#039;d turn to say something and it was my bookbag. So funny to experience, really bizarre. I&#039;ve read some hilarious reports online about people having similar experiences like thinking there are stairs and just walking into a wall, and lots of other stuff that makes me lol now that I&#039;ve experienced those hallucinations. Wow, I digress.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not read a report about 8 hours of euphoria from 6-apb, most I read said 4-6 hour plateau. Although, the euphoria may be that which is in the comedown too, which is long and drawn out. And I agree, 200mg should produce something super long and strong based on other reports. I wonder what 250mg of FO&#039;s stuff would do. Maybe it would be on par with many 125mg-150mg reports of high potency 6-apb.<br /><br />

				Everything that has posted has been accurate.<br />The 6-APB was indeed from FiberOptic.<br />All of the trip reports on Erowid etc, had lead me to believe that 100-120mg would be the right dosage.<br />Given that I&#039;m rather skinny (140lbs) and had no cross tolerance build up at all.&nbsp; I was definitely expecting it to hit me much harder.<br /><br />Plus in my honest opinion I wouldn&#039;t push the dosage much higher in the sake of harm reduction.&nbsp; Overall I had some slightly concerning side effects.&nbsp; Including vasoconstriction in my legs among other things.<br />I&#039;d be careful.<br /><br />Maybe the powder was from a new supplier of Fiber&#039;s and he wanted to see what kind of quality it was before buying bulk.&nbsp; That&#039;s my theory, until then we will have to see more trip reports come in.<br /><br />Vanquish

				People get confused about the duration of 6-APB, because the after-glow is so potent a trip.&nbsp; But 6-8 hours is accurate.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had EXTENSIVE experience with PB before.<br /><br />The Three Musketeers bombed the sample of 6-APB from PlanetExpress last night.&nbsp; Not only is it the real deal, it&#039;s probably as potent as they suggest.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, guys, seriously you guys, no srsly!&nbsp; $20/g??&nbsp; Fuck yes, I&#039;m in love.<br /><br />Buy with confidence, fellers, they even sell smaller amounts.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m off to go try and score some of their BTH samples they listed ^.^<br /><br />Much love,<br />~Ali &lt;3

				I finally got around to trying 100 mgs of planetexpress&#039;s stuff and oh my fucking god hahaha.<br /><br />I almost feel like this substance shouldnt be called a research chemical honestly. it has a sacred &quot;magic&quot; aspect to it that is extremely similar to the true mdxx substances.<br /><br />I took it with my girl yesterday(100 mgs each, both experienced with mdma and mda) and within 30-40 minutes we both started feeling light effects. within 1 hour we were both laid out, to the point to where the thought of moving was just a real fucking bummer hahaha. she was laying her head on the table and i was sprawled out in my seat.<br /><br />at that point we had a few interesting conversations, and a few really cool ideas popped up in my head while talking. the most memorable one was the idea that i could build a &quot;neighborhood&quot; in a forest, without chopping down any trees and ridding it of all life. Imagine if humans built houses AROUND the environment instead of just mowing it over. work with mother nature harmoniously instead of just killing it all so we can build some useless shit and put it there......<br /><br />anyways......&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />slowly but surely the outside world started taking on a sort of fairy-land appearance just like my FIRST experience with mdma. everything was getting more vivid in color and things began to trace lightly.<br /><br />she told me that her visuals were very intense whether her eyes were open or shut, and i definitely had some rainbow fishscale patterns on the back of my eyelids at somepoints, even though i took lsd 6 days ago and had one of the most visual trips ive ever had hahaha.<br /><br />once we finally got over that main peak, we started to feel at one with the universe. the main come up is definitely a bit intense but once you level out you feel AMAZING. my limbs felt so loose and wobbly. my body felt like it weighed a ton and my temperature fluxuated a bit at some points during the experience. sometimes i would feel like i was wrapped in a blanket. other times i would be getting goosebumps because of a breeze hitting my skin.<br /><br />music was awesome as expected, and sex was very interesting as well. (a good interesting, we tried out a few new things&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />the main &quot;in your face&quot; euphoria started dying down at about 7 hours, but i was still left with plenty of visual movement and a great body high at that point. the only real bummer about the experience happened shortly after. I started to get some head pressure that was pretty unpleasant. i took an ibuprofen and me and my girl went to her room and had sex again, which completely healed the headache and had me feeling high as fuck again once i had an orgasm.<br /><br />we hit the lights shortly after and went to bed. (at this point its been around 11 hours or so since we took it.)<br /><br />we woke up this morning cuddled up with eachother and we both still felt great. cuddling was so fucking comforting and nice! we had sex again in the morning and it was still &quot;enhanced&quot; to an extent, but obviously not as intense as it was the night before.<br /><br />all in all, I would feel like a fucking retard if i didn&#039;t get a shit ton more of this 6-apb... seriously that experience for that price.... it just doesnt happen folks.<br />

Apparently it is very challenging to make.<br /><br />I have heard some incredible things about it. I&#039;ve read that it&#039;s a long come-up, a long ride, and a gentle comedown, with the euphoria of MDMA stetched out to nearly the length of an LSD trip. Anyone who says that it is &quot;safe&quot; compared to X is speaking out of ignorance. No one knows the consequences of taking 6-apb. The safety of its use compared to X is likely because many people do not experience a harsh comedown and feel fine the next day, compared to X which can be quite rough; but this is not indicative of safety. That being said, because it does not produce terrible after-effects, then if used sparingly, there&#039;s a good chance that it&#039;s not doing anything too damaging if at all, but again, this is just speculation.<br /><br />anyways, good find!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Felt the come-up start 20 minutes after eating 2 x (unknown dosage) of 6-ABP Pressed Pills. from 20m on, it was like a slow climb on a roller coaster, up that first monster hill... feel your nerves flutter like an acid or MDMA come-up, and all that, but there&#039;s no real &#039;peak&#039; ... It&#039;s like it just keeps going up til its coming down.&nbsp; Very hard to describe.&nbsp; On the way up it&#039;s heavily psycho-stimulating, like the strongest Sativa you ever smoked, the first time you smoked it, but more clear-headed.&nbsp; Almost &quot;speedy&quot; ... definitely &quot;trippy&quot; ... Colors were not what they were supposed to be, edges of dimensional planes were sharpened, and I was haloing off everything.<br /><br />Very clean feeling stuff, no hang over.<br /><br />I&#039;ve eaten them about 5 times, always 2, 1 of whatever dosage the pills were was shitty.<br /><br />Also tried 5-APB, noticed little to no difference.

He said it was an intense euphoric high that reminded him of MDA. To me it felt like bunk acid or something.&nbsp; I donno.&nbsp; My brain chemistry ain&#039;t right.&nbsp; I&#039;m hyper-sensitive to some things, and super super resistant to others.&nbsp; I do remember music had some depth to it, but nothing in comparison to Fluff or top-end Molly. <br /><br />Everyone I sold them to loved them, and the only people who told me they needed 2, were other people who ate a lot of molly at the time; so I&#039;m assuming there&#039;s some kind of major cross-tolerance issue? I don&#039;t know enough about 6-APB, and there isn&#039;t a whole lot out there aside from trip-reports, which is as good as me taking it myself. :P<br /><br />I blame drugs.&nbsp; As in, using ALL of them for the last 20+ years of my life on steady rotation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aside from a handful of RC&#039;s and a slew of synths out of the Tihkal and Pihkal, I have done just about everything, and I can say that most of that was before the age of 14.&nbsp; We&#039;re talking permanent brain damage!<br /><br />Which reminds me, I really want to name a strain of weed, or a drug: &quot;This is Permanent&quot; as mentioned in the movie TED.<br />
