				THE PSYCHEDELIC ALLYLBENZENE THEORY<br /><br />This is a compilation of information me, 69ron, and many many other members of herbs.maxforum and drugs forum have compiled on our Psychedelic allylbenzene theory. I am providing links to the entire theory and every work that has ever been done on the topic. This is very complex and technical but we try to explain it as well as possible (your basically learning drug metabolism here).<br /><br />The psychedelic allylbenzene theory is the theory that allylbenzene compounds in everyday common household herbs and spices can be converted into psychedelic alkaloids similar to mescaline and other more well known psychoactives by inhibiting certain enzymes thereby forcing the compounds to metabolize into the end product we desire. This could in fact be the biggest blow to the drug war ever discovered. If you can trip on common everyday items available at your local aromatherapy shop and make the effects just like mescaline or MDMA then the drug war is pretty much over. I cant see them coming in to raid grannies spice cabinet or make aromatherapy illegal.&nbsp; <br /><br />The most basic of these are forcing elemicin to metabolize into s 3-(dimethylamino)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one, 3-piperidin-1-yl-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one, or&nbsp; 3-Pyrrolidin-1-yl-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one. These compounds have psychedelic activity similar to mescaline and all act as 5ht2a agonists. <br /><br />Here are links to the complete allylbenzene theory and everything on oilahuasca.<br /><br />This link will take you to the allylbenzene theory homepage, you can select from this page the allylbenzene oil you would like to convert into a psychedelic alkaloid. A chart is also provided explaining sources for specified allylbenzene.<br />http://herbpedia.wikidot.com/allylbenzenes<br /><br />Here is a general overview of Oilahuasca and how to make it. Note: the ingredients necessary will vary depending on which allylbenzene you want to activate.<br />http://herbpedia.wikidot.com/oilahuasca-activation<br /><br />All about enzyme inhibitors and inducers, the oilahuasca diet (which must be followed), and enzyme interactions.<br />http://herbpedia.wikidot.com/oilahuasca-activators<br /><br />Our entire collection of data on various herbs, essential oils, supplements, ect. The most comprehensive compilation of information regarding psychoactive drugs you didn&#039;t even know existed.<br />http://herbpedia.wikidot.com/start

				Everyone seems to find it interesting. Its based on the oswald and peele theory and shulgins early work with nutmeg.

				I have huge respect for this, and it sends off my thinking less about tripping out on household stuff, and more about the medicinal benefits of all these plants being worked with in a new way. SR is an example of many people learning to self-medicate (and enjoy themselves) with illegal substances (mostly). Firstly we can remember that many plants are legally available which have very positive effects on our bodies, and for people who like to trip we can use them for that purpose. but each plant holds specific medicines for us, and learning different ways to use them is amazing. even the existence of essential oils is a profound practical step in learning alchemy.<br />Clear minds with research like this will help many people. All respect.

				^^ Yeah that&#039;s more the way I look at it and discuss it over at herbs.maxforums. There are numerous medical benefits to these oils and the compounds contained within them and numerous medical benefits to psychedelics in general. It seems most people here are more the recreational drug users than using for medicinal or spiritual purposes (although there are some of them too,) so I decided to touch more on that front.<br /><br />There are essential oils with psychedelic, dissociative, nootropic, stimulant, and sedative properties. In fact aromatic compounds have some of the most diverse (and in some cases completely unique) pharmacology of any class of compound, and depending on which end product you force the aromatic to metabolize into one can significantly change the effect that one receives.<br /><br />Do be careful though, some of these EOs are extremely toxic if metabolized by the wrong metabolic pathways, if the enzyme inhibitor doesn&#039;t take, for some of these (like the apiols) it could result in a toxic reaction. Also some enzymes (not the CYPs, but aldehyde dehydrogenase and a few others may very well have food restrictions like MAOIs. This is all treading into the unknown, and while cutting edge it should be treated with the same caution and respect that you would use when sampling new research chemicals.

				DMtryptamine285, I have to say, this is all very mindblowing to think that the pharmacology is integrating more with aromatherapy. This gives me great hope. Do you know about field research, or have you published papers on this? for example, your books and guides, have they been published in some way as a thesis or otherwise? are there universities or medical faculties aiming their research at medicinal uses of oils like this? perhaps I am naive, but I am sure it is far from conventional, yet this is a forefront of herbalism that can easily be integrated as a medical pharmacopeia.<br /><br />My mind gets completely blown just sniffing ylang ylang for a while, I might not be experimenting with these amazing mixes, but I really want to understand them to some degree so that I can use them in my later practices.

				I have not published any work (other than online) on this as its still experimental but people are reporting amazing effects.<br />There have been published works written on the subject which me and others over at that forum have drastically expanded on. The old oswald and peele allybenzene theory is where the framework came from, as well as earlier work published by alexander shulgin on myristicin metabolism. We discovered that it isnt only myristicin and elemicin but many many compounds which are psychoactive. It could explain many of the benefits elicited by aromatherapy, seeing as these compounds are aromatic and small quantities will be absorbed via inhalation even when dispersed in the air.<br /><br />I plan to do my thesis on the allylbenzene theory and design an objective experiment, while we have enough anecdotal evidence to confirm it does indeed work with most of the allylbenzenes, a double blind placebo controlled study has yet to be performed. I am however designing one.<br />

				They say 90% of elemental gases have a consciousness changing effect in humans. This includes nitrogen and oxygene. Which makes me think, if we didn&#039;t breath air, would we think the same way that we do, would we be the same people?
