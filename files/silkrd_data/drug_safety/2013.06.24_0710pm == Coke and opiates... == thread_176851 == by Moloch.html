				Was thinking of maybe taking a dose of 30mg morphine sulphate (oral), plus however many lines feels right. I&#039;m a relatively new to both; although I feel quite comfortable with coke already.<br />So, I&#039;m just looking for advice from those more knowledgeable than I in this regard; is this an appropriate plan/dose, any useful advice/thoughts? This would be my first time mixing the 2.<br />Thanks in advance.

				You&#039;ll be fine.. 30mg of oral morphine isn&#039;t a lot. Mixing coke and opiates or downers is not very good for your heart though...

				Thanks. Hmmm... Bad for the heart, you say? I thought it may be better for the heart than coke on its own. Guess I was wrong.

There&#039;s other weird effects when you mix opiates with SOMA where one pupil is constricted from the opiate and the other is dilated from the SOMA, you look pretty fucked up but it&#039;s funny and it feels really good (I&#039;m pretty sure it isn&#039;t very good for your health either).

It&#039;s far less bad for your heart than taking morphine and doing lines during the peak though! And SOMA is from a brave new world but it&#039;s the brand name for a really good downer that mixes really well with opiates (carisoprodol). I personally prefer mixing downers with downers than uppers with downers but during a comedown an opiate is pretty good!

				Personally I use to prefer benzodiazepins, to calm those jumpy nerves, when using cocaine. My favorite was of course rohybnol. *sigh* Miss them.<br />But like it has been mentioned in this thread already. Mixing uppers with downers isn&#039;t good for your heart. I call it: &quot;Doing an Elvis&quot; :D<br /><br />But purely for the comedown... Hmm, None of us is a doctor. But I would still say it isn&#039;t without risk. <br /><br />Before I sound too &quot;holy&quot; let me just say that if I can get my hands on something good to come down on, I take it for sure ;)

				I only do coke if there&#039;s opiates around, since I can&#039;t stand the coke comedown, and opiates are the only thing that really completely gets rid of a coke comedown.&nbsp; Usually I do the coke first, with a few hits of H here and there to even myself out, and save the lion&#039;s share of the H for when the coke&#039;s gone.<br /><br />Taking them together isn&#039;t too dangerous, provided you go slow.&nbsp; Do small bumps/hits, and keep track of how much you&#039;re doing.
