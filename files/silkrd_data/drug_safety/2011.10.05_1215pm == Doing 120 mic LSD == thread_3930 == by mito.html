				I&#039;ve done LSD in the past, but not too many times.&nbsp; My first time was very very good, it was a hot and beautiful summer day.&nbsp; <br /><br />When the effect kicked in I was walking in a park with lots of trees,&nbsp; some squirrels began fighting, birds were chirping, an intimate moment with nature I had.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll never forget this wonderful experience.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered 120 mic from Mitanox.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How strong is it compared to 150 mic?<br /><br />I have no idea how many mics (ug) the LSD I&#039;ve had in the past had, the supplier was the same, an honest guy.<br /><br />I was thinking of taking two 120 mic doses, but won&#039;t that be too much?<br />Or take one first, then take the second after an hour?<br />The method I did was letting it melt under my tongue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there another method?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to hear your experiences.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />

				just drop both at the same time, i find you have to at least hit 200mcg to bring the visuals out, id go with under the tongue, or one under the tongue and one between your bottom lip and gum, sadly the mcg doesnt always mean all that much ive had cases where a 150mcg has seemed stronger than a 180mcg one, depends on the crystal used and how your tolerance for psychedelics is really, but for my money you may as well go all in and eat the two together for best experience unless your previous single tab experience gave strong results, some people are more sensitive to psychedelics than others. you can rest assured though you could eat ten of them tabs with no real physical health risks at all so safety isnt a concern really, its just a case of how intense you like your trip (dont eat 10 tabs though, youre body may well be fine, cant promise your mind will be though!)

				It depends on what kind of experience you want and whether the mcg estimate is anywhere near accurate.<br /><br />Unless you are an experienced psychonaut (and as this is the drug safety section)&nbsp; less is is more in my opinion. <br /><br />You can always drop another tab a couple of hours in.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just make sure you fast before you drop the first tab, and that your (mind)set and setting is good.

				My first experience was on 180 mics (as best I can tell) and I found it pretty mild. Not that that was a bad thing, I was in control and went for a nice long walk, got caught in the rain and didn&#039;t care, a really great day actually. I tried twice that next and spent the entire time in bed unable to speak, just watching the colours and thinking life through. Again, not a bad thing, but there is no way I would be able to socialise in that state.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also tried close to, or maybe more than, 1000 mics (7 tabs) and that was one hell of an experience. Lasted about 14 hours before I got to sleep, vomited a couple of times and thought I was going to lose my shit a couple of times. But again it had it&#039;s positive elements. I learnt a lot about myself that night, and once I got a few hours in I could settle and enjoy it more. And I will always remember the sunrise that morning :)<br /><br />So to sum up, the above posts are right on the money, everyone is different, and it&#039;s probably best to start small and build up as once you have an idea of how strong your tabs are, and how they&#039;ll affect you, you can dial in the experience you want.<br /><br />One more thing I would say is have music ready, if you start heading to a place you don&#039;t want to be I find music can be really calming. Sugary foods are also good for this, or really anything that would normally make you happy will help keep you happy if you have negative thoughts. Other than that, remember that you&#039;ll come down, and to enjoy yourself and you should be sweet.<br /><br />This is all just me, so take it with a grain of salt, but hopefully it helps. Have fun mate :)
