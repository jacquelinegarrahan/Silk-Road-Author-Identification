				hey guys. This is probably a really dumb question, but i just got two 130 mg mdma capsules. Normally i would just bump it and be done with it, but since these are in plastic pill shaped capsules, can i just swallow em whole? That way i wouldnt get that nasty nasal drip, or have to taste it since its still in the plastic pill shaped container

				are you sure it&#039;s plastic? if it&#039;s a capsule i&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;d be made of gelatin...

				plastic wouldn&#039;t digest in your stomach! your body would just coat it in mucous and you would shit it out in a day or two. it is likely gelatin as gestalt said. actually if it is pure molly, snorting it would probably be safer than if you snorted crushed up rolls. i dont like snorting ecstasy because of the AWFUL taste of the drip, but a lot of people swear by it. i tend to allow small things to ruin my fun though. if i were you i would just swallow the gel caps. it will last longer but won&#039;t hit you as fast or as intensely, obviously. but when it comes to ecstasy i think a slower mellow buzz keeps me from having a catastrophic comedown. if you are really concerned with getting the most effect out of the caps, rectal administration is supposedly far more effective than intranasal. never tried it myself as i quit taking mdma long ago, but there are a couple guides on bluelight that make it seem like the shit, figuratively speaking that is ??? ... truth is, mdma is not much more bioavailable intranasally than it is orally, but it *is* much more bioavailable rectally. oral or rectal are unlikely to hurt you, but snorting anything causes damage to the nasal cavity. it&#039;s really up to you. snorting mollies is not likely to be any different from snorting pressed pills, except the high will be cleaner of course

				yes, put one against your tongue and see if it gets gooey. a gel cap will begin to melt when your saliva touches it. i can&#039;t imagine what anyone could use a plastic pill-shaped capsule for.

				They are gelatin, use one at a time. Definitely swallow, snorting is horrible and doesn&#039;t work anywhere close to swallowing a pill in my experience.
