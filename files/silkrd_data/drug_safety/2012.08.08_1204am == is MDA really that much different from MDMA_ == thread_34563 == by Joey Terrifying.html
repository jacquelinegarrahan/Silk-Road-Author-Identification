				just curious.&nbsp; i always hear people say its &quot;more psychedelic&quot; but i have never gotten a more articulate explanation than that.&nbsp; <br /><br />if any experts could elaborate on the distinctions between the two, i&#039;d greatly appreciate it. <br /><br />i would also appreciate any comments regarding MDA/MDMA combos.<br /><br />thanks!

				i guess i should just swallow some and find out for myself, eh?<br /><br />i&#039;ve had some of montel williams&#039; mda for a while now but only once took some and it was in combination with mdma while i was tripping on mushrooms.&nbsp; soooo, i didn&#039;t really get a good feel for its unique character, haha

				I&#039;ve only tried 3Jane&#039;s MDA, and less was more. 100mg was much more enjoyable than 150mg. It does have a unique character. It&#039;s really chill and you don&#039;t necessarily want to get up and dance. I just laid in bed for a while and stretched and rolled around. Felt pretty awesome. Smoke some weed about halfway in.

				mda is less predictable in its effects, but it tends to be more psychedelic and stimulating. i.e. you will trip instead of roll.

				More trippy instead of rolly in my opinion. Kind of like MDMA lite or something. I prefer MDMA, but they&#039;re both pretty fun. Not as similar as I thought they&#039;d be, but they do have a similar feel that is noticeable.

				i had a low dose of MDA and tings were damn fine until i smashed A load of&nbsp; Regretamine and K-holed into one of the most intense trips ever.<br /><br />everything was black except for a rotating shape that moved closer gradually as i explored it.<br />only way to describe it was like if you got some alluminum foil, squashed it into a ball and span it round slowly.<br />every line,facet and face was alive with octarine iridescence.<br />beauty.

				Yeah people forget that the dose range for MDA is lower than MDMA. It&#039;s about 20% more potent by weight.

				One time a couple of months back I snorted a roughly 80mg line of mda, while rolling on MDMA for a couple of hours beforehand.&nbsp; Despite the obvious tolerance to the MDMA I was still rolling on, this had a dramatic effect!&nbsp; I could see my friends&#039; faces flasing in high speed, changing their expressions!&nbsp; I saw hats, veils, aqua-coloured geometric stationary pattens on friends&#039; faces and also on the horizon and in the atmosphere. Depth perception all out of whack!&nbsp; It was so much fun!<br /><br />Then, a couple of months later, I was feeling rather impulsive (doesn&#039;t happen often with this sort of thing), and since I had eaten a big meal, I decided to snort some of the same MDA alone, not in combination with MDMA this time, to properly gauge it&#039;s effects.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s tolerence from dosing 40mg of 2cb 3 days beforehand (I bet this is it), or whether it was potentiated to the impressive heights I experienced that night from the MDMA I was already on, but the effects were minimal, and quite slow to come on.&nbsp; The whole roll felt really weak, although I eventually got to a nice happy place, it wasn&#039;t anywhere near as intense as I would have liked.&nbsp; My dosage on this occasion was about 230mg snorted, but in 50mg increments.&nbsp; Perhaps, even when snorting MDA, and particularly with a tolerence, one needs to pack all the punch into one initial line?<br /><br />Snorting MDMA/MDA is something new for me, that I&#039;ve only tried recently for the first times. Although my first MDA roll was amazing, tolerance has probably made my second roll much more underwhelming.<br /><br />Overall, AWESOME DRUG! Less lovely, more visual!<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to try high oral doses sometime, when i get my tolerence down, and also to combine with MDMA.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking 120 of Ivory&#039;s clear, with 75 mg of 3Jane&#039;s clear MDA<br /><br />Could possibly be the best thing i&#039;ll ever do!!!

				I mixed my MDA with my MDMA so i took MDMA instead of MDA by accident, first time trying it and took around 500mg, i was fucked up about 20 hours later. I know that if i only took a little bit i would have enjoyed it way more, it lasted way too long it became uncomfortable because it was way too much. Stupid me

				What is a good mix of MDMA and MDA?&nbsp; Might be an interesting experiment.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking 120mg MDMA + 60mg MDA would be a pretty good combo.&nbsp; Anyone have experience with this?

				I definitely gotta chime in on this one.&nbsp; I recently tried MDA on its own for the first time, and it is much much more trippy than MDMA.&nbsp; MDA is pretty serious, or at least the dosage I took was.&nbsp; 180lbs. male who is experienced with Molly and other drugs took 150mg then re-dosed like an idiot a few hours later with another 150mg.&nbsp; <br /><br />DO NOT RE-DOSE!&nbsp; MDA really really is unlike MDMA in the sense that more is not always better.&nbsp; I read someone else&#039;s warnings about re-dosing on MDA and I thought...&quot;not me, I can take it...I&#039;m special etc.&quot;&nbsp; The next day, I can&#039;t describe to you the pain I felt.&nbsp; It was the worst next day I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; If you plan on Re-dosing on MDA, also plan on not having a gun in the house for the next week because you will likely be suicidal.&nbsp; I&#039;m really not joking...the hangover lasts for days and it is really bad.&nbsp; So bad I won&#039;t take MDA again.&nbsp; It just isn&#039;t worth it, for what you get v.s. the health of your body and brain.<br /><br />150mg was a good dose and I&#039;m glad I took that, I was rolling quite hard off of it...the onset was really quick too, about 35 min. and I was already feeling it big time.&nbsp; MDA really doesn&#039;t give you the body high that MDMA gives and it also doesn&#039;t give you the sense that everything is amazing with the world.&nbsp; At the dosage I was at: My teeth were chattering, I had horrible headache 6 hours in that persisted for days, my mouth and tongue were very chewed up, and I was having some of the realest 2 sec. hallucinations I&#039;ve ever had and I&#039;ve experimented with LSD, DMT, 2ci, 2ce, 2ct2 etc....<br /><br />In summary: MDA is trippy as fuck, worth trying on its own, but don&#039;t do what I did and re-dose like its Molly.

				Done MDA by itself a couple times now.. i do enjoy it however i like MDMA better&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Like most have said i found it more chargy and trippy and no way could i sit down i had to move lol unlike MDMA where if i sit down i practically blow my load from it feeling so good haha<br /><br />Also i found on MDA that i kept thinking that everyone in the club was looking at me lol maybe they were but in reality i think it was the MDA tricking me lol also why in the toilet cubicle i had to keep looking over my shoulder coz kept seeing those damn shadow people haha and then proceeded to throw up lol but i always throw up, whether mdma or mda, ever since i got really drunk one night and decided to drop some pills(mdma)...that night i threw up and since then even when i drop and havnt had a drink i still chuck&nbsp; :-\ oh wells<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve yet to do an MDMA/MDA combo but really want to...have heard awesome things<br />Was thinking 100 or 120mg of MDMA about 70mg MDA<br />Does that sound alright??<br /><br />also whose good to get MDA of here?<br /><br />cheers guys <br />PLUR

				oh yeah there much to be gained from MDA.... in some ways they are similar but they also have there own unique effects,&nbsp; personally i like to mix them,&nbsp; MDA on its own it okay but nothing like the two together.

				I&#039;ve gotten some crazy visuals on MDA in the past. Once, we were out at a desert party and I swore we were partying in the middle of a valley with condos rising up on either side.&nbsp; When the sun came up I was confused as to where all the buildings went.&nbsp; Same party, someone gave me a camera to take a photo of them and I couldn&#039;t for the life of me figure out what it was. It looked like some weird Atlantean or alien technology until they told me it was a camera and I could see it for what it was.&nbsp; Staring up at the moon was fun, too - it looked like an eye that was absorbing the stars around it into it. Fun stuff.<br /><br />Was walking down a sidewalk once with a friend who had dropped 2 MDA pills, he stopped and started moving his hands in the air like he he was conducting something. I asked him what he was doing and he was like, &quot;shhh... I&#039;m reorganizing my medicine cabinet.&quot;<br /><br />Haven&#039;t had MDA in a looong while, will probably get my hands on some once things get sorted out.

				I&#039;d like to know how MDA compares to 2c-i.<br />I have a lot of experience with 2c-i and I&#039;ve had MDMA. <br />Everyone says that MDA is a trippier and less rolly MDMA.<br />Well 2c-i is mildly entacnogenic like MDMA and fairly trippy too.

				Back when I was young and my metabolism was fast, MDMA felt way too short. MDA lasted a bit longer, and had more of an amphetamine push, which I liked back then. <br /><br />It was my favourite back in those days, good for partying. It could be unpredictable, and the come down required a lot of care. Not as bad as meth, but pretty bad. Insomnia could be a bitch. But it was fun. Energy, physical and emotional warmth, some mild visuals.<br /><br />Despite getting pretty fucked up a couple of times I never found it that trippy. Pretty stoning, remember describing the feeling after a heavy dose as like being hit round the head with a baseball bat. But not what I&#039;d call trippy.<br /><br />The most important difference between MDMA and MDA for me was that MDMA would cause lingering panic attacks - had one when it came on, that&#039;s cool, it&#039;s a drug it does stuff. But had another one a week later completely straight. Seemed to cause and then exacerbate these things. MDA didn&#039;t though.<br /><br />For ianfleming - I can&#039;t compare it to 2c-i, but I&#039;ve had a bit of 2c-b (maybe similar to 2c-i?), and I wouldn&#039;t say 2c-b is like MDA at all. I prefer 2c-b, overall, for the smooth body load/come down/headspace, but they&#039;re different things.<br /><br />It&#039;s been well over a decade, but I&#039;m gonna try MDA again - just to see if it&#039;ll get me off the couch and get me to give my ladyfriend a night on the town.
