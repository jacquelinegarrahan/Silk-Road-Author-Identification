				Going to try this for the first time hopeffuly this weekend. Blotter form. Anyway saw a post where it was said that it takes a very long time for it to hit you and you must chew the tab for it to hit? Reports I have read never mentioned that? Any quick tips mates?

				As I understand it (as someone who&#039;s enjoyed the NBOMes but has no deep knowledge of their chemistry) the active chemicals in the NBOMes are destroyed in the stomach, as many things are. So, just as you&#039;re recommended to put LSD under your tongue to absorb through the thinner membrane there before swallowing, NBOMes you must keep under your tongue (or in your cheek, or you can try plugging them, but I digress) since, unlike LSD, none or essentially none will be absorbed from your stomach.<br /><br />I&#039;ve generally heard it advised that you keep the tab under your tongue for 45 minutes, and try not to swallow your saliva. Basically you just want the membranes in your mouth awash in the good stuff for as long as possible.<br /><br />As far as chewing - I usually keep blotters (of anything) under my tongue for however long, then chew them quickly, then back under the tongue for a bit more before swallowing, hoping that by chewing I&#039;ll wring some more of the chemical out. Does that actually happen? Maybe not, maybe it all comes out of the blotter naturally, but it costs nothing so why not.<br /><br />So, the gist is put it under your tongue for 30-45 minutes, try to not swallow your saliva for as long as possible, and feel free to chew at some point if you so desire.

				Best way of taking NBOMe is to place the tabs between your gum and lip (upper or down), however you feel more comfortable.<br /><br />Do not swallow or spit your saliva for 30+ mis, I know it might be hard, it was for me I was not used to the process. If you can&#039;s keep it for 30 mins 20 will do it but repeat the process one more time. After these 20, 30 mins I swallow the saliva but i suppose it will hit you even if you spit it. <br /><br />I have 10+ trips with NBOMe and trust me I tried all possibilities and the method above hits you the hardest.<br /><br />As the guy above me said the fluids in your stomach fight the drug and will lower the effects so if you swallow your saliva on normal basis the trip will be weaker as much of the drug itself gets destroyed by the stomach fluids.<br /><br />Hope this makes sense I&#039;m tripping.
