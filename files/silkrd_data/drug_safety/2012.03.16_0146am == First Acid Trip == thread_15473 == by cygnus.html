				I&#039;ve been wanting to try acid for ~9 months, but there was none around, and then I found the silk road. So, now I have 5 mayas from juergen :).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve researched the effects, I&#039;ve read people&#039;s stories of good trips and bad trips, and I feel pretty prepared. These will however be my first psychedelic experience. I used to smoke weed a lot, i used to do coke a fair amount, same with heroin, and i&#039;ve rolled once. Circumstances have arisen where i can&#039;t do drugs as much anymore, so i&#039;ve been clean from all these for ~3months, except for smoking some weed. I&#039;ve heard that its beneficial for an acid trip when you have less chemicals from other drugs in your system, not sure how true that is, I&#039;d like to hear some of your opinions on this.<br /><br />I&#039;d also like to hear any tips you guys have for a first time acid trip. Thanks for anything you would like to share :)

				if its the 300 one then i would be kind of cautious seeing as this LSD is VERY potent especially for a first timer. I would have probably gotten some 100ug&nbsp; but just be careful and maybe get a trip sitter just in case. Or have some benzos ready.

				thanks guys :).&nbsp; i&#039;m excited because i&#039;m a fairly introverted person, and i enjoy just observing everything going on, so i want to see what the world can be like after taking acid. <br /><br />Anybody have any idea if the whole &quot;you&#039;ll have a better trip with less traces of other drugs in your system&quot; has any truth to it? just curious

Just make sure you do it in a place your comfortable, with people your comfortable with.. <br /><br />If at any point things get too hard to handle just remember it is a trip and it will end, then go try to focus on something else, change the music, go to another room.<br /><br />My first trip I took about ~700ug, was an absolutely amazing night, only a few moments of slight panic but far far far outweighed by the rest of the amazing experiences.<br /><br />In short, Set/Setting :)

My sixth trip was 1x of 300ug mayas from juergen and I must say I have never had such a fucked up experience in my life. I wouldn&#039;t say it was a bad trip just very fucked up like alice tumbling down the rabbit hole I felt lost.<br /><br />So with that said just wanted to warn you the mayas are very powerful just be careful when taking them.<br /><br />Here is a good FAQ about lsd you should read before you start your trip.<br />http://www.drugsandbooze.com/showthread.php?28887-Brand-New-LSD-FAQ<br /><br />There is also a good lsd documentary on you-tube that provided me with some good insight into lsd usage. In fact this documentary is what encouraged me to take lsd.<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJrRBWbtJZ0<br /><br />And last but not least if you want some insight into what an lsd trip is like you should take a look at a few of my trip logs. But with that said log&#039;s will never compare to actually doing the real thing.<br />My First LSD Trip (Trip log included)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12204.0

				@shadowrundeusex<br />that highly depends on what you&#039;ve got, if it&#039;s 200ug I&#039;d just go with the whole thing. I&#039;ve done LSD once so while I may not be the most informed of people, I took between 120 and 150 mics and felt little if anything. 25mg of 2c-b fucking blew LSD out of the water for me, which I don&#039;t think should&#039;ve happened.

Also note if you have to take diazepam during your trip it will make the rest of the trip very boring.<br /><br />Out of 8 LSD trips that I have done so far I have only had 2 bad trips and to be honest the bad trips ain&#039;t necessarily a bad thing yeah they can scare the shit out of you but the 2 bad trips that I have had I have learned a lot from them.<br /><br />Hmm it seams I tend to ramble on when I post but the bottom line of what I am trying to say is if you do LSD start with a 150-200&nbsp; µg dose and don&#039;t be afraid of potential bad trips embrace them and remember it&#039;s only a drug everything that is happening to you is only in your head and will go away in about 12 hours,<br /><br /><br />Kind Regards<br />SpeedCrunch

As I have taken blotters advertised as 150 µg lsd and have been blown away by colors.<br /><br />But without proper lab testing no one can be sure of LSD dosages.<br /><br />Kind Regards<br />SpeedCrunch

I&#039;d recommend 200ug if you want to trip, as raven92 said, he took 700ug his first time and experienced minimal negative effects, which hopefully should reassure you a little.
