				Seems to be a matter of some controversy. Normally one would assume the longer one holds it the more is absorbed in the lung, while the quicker you exhale the more of the vaporized meth you just blow out into the air again. I normally hold it around 4 secs or so, but I do notice if I hold longer (like 10 seconds) the amount exhaled is clearly reduced, i.e. the plume of meth is nearly gone vs. a huge cloud you breathe out when you exhale quickly.<br /><br />So shouldn&#039;t it be more effective to hold it long? Regarding greater health hazards, is there any objective information that holding it in is more damaging? As far as I know the recrystalization myth is nonsense, so what other greater hazards should result, asides from meth being quite a shock to the system in general of course, especially vaporized/inhaled.<br /><br />Probably this subject has been gone over before, if some moderator wants to he can move it into another thread that deals with the subject.<br /><br />Ironically when I first took meth in Asia they were also of split opinion with some people ( a guy from a night club and a prostitute who were consuming with me) saying &quot;hold it! hold it! So you can feel the effect&quot; while I was inhaling, while my main drug supplier at the time, some kind of low level local mafia thug told me I was damaging my lungs unnecessarily holding it in after inhaling.

				No, it is not more effective to hold it in longer. All the meth is absorbed in about 3 seconds, 5 seconds probably maximum, holding it in any longer is just a waste of time and lung tissue.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there are any major risks involved when you hold it in for a long time, don&#039;t let anyone tell you it will recrystalize in your lungs, that&#039;s a bunch of bullshit.<br />But hold it for just a few seconds and that&#039;s about all you&#039;re gonna get from your hit.

At least seems to make sense to me.<br /><br />Like if you took a plastic bag and always exhaled into that after each hit after a while the exhaled meth would recrystalize in the bag and I assume you would see that puffing large clouds into that bag would cause much more meth to recrystalize in the bag, that&#039;s the meth that&#039;s not in your body but flying around in the athmosphere. Could be I&#039;m wrong, but appears logical to me.

				I might experiment with exhaling through a straw rigged to filter smoke through water, after a gram I suspect there will be a substantial amount of meth that had been absorbed by water.&nbsp; The thing I haven&#039;t figure out is how to minimize water volume but maximize dispersal of vapor.

				I&#039;ve experimented with holding smoke in but did not notice any substantial difference. I will say, after smoking weed every day for several years now, it&#039;s really hard not to have the impulse to hold the smoke in, though.

Holding in the smoke makes your body absorb more of it, just like any other drug that is smoked. <br /><br />So, this is from firsthand experience. Sometimes I blow the smoke out quick just to make sure that I am hitting it right and not burning it, just verifying that I can get a big cloud if I wanted to, but holding the smoke in allows me to only have to take 2-3 hits every 2 hours or so and remain really really really high until it&#039;s time to stop.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what people think they are blowing out when they exhale early if holding it in doesn&#039;t do anything? I would certainly like to know what they think it is, because pets, especially small dogs and cats, can get spun out from secondhand passive inhalation, so if it&#039;s not meth smoke, what is it that you think you&#039;re blowing out?

It&#039;s simply harder to hold it in for very long because of how you breathe when you&#039;re spun.

				late to the party but I&#039;m high and lookin for something to do.<br /><br />I hold it in for 5-7 seconds. After the first second or two I try to draw in a little bit of air (not from the pipe). I do this for two reasons: 1) move any vapor in my trachea/bronchial tubes into my lungs, where it can be absorbed and 2) to get some cooler air in my lungs to cause the vapor to condensate. Then, after 4 or 5 seconds I let a small amount out, then suck air back in, for pretty much the same reason as the first little gasp.<br />I continue to do this until there is only wispy vestiges of vapor when I exhale. <br /><br />The other thing I do (when I am alone, because it is pretty ghetto) is to fully exhale into a plastic bag, take a few breaths, then inhale the contents of the bag. I *know* there is good meth in the bag, one time a noob friend of mine took my exhale bag as his first hit and he rushed.

				Lol at breathing smoking into a bag, because I once smoked crack with an old crackhead from the &quot;hood&quot; or predominately black part of the city where you are likely to find a lot of addicts. <br /><br />He had a contraption that was a pipe with a condom fastened on the end and it had an on and off valve, so you would take your hit of crack, flip open the valve on the pipe with a condom on the end blow the smoke in there and flip the off valve and all your smoke would stay put in the ballooned up condom so you could catch your breath and inhale your shotgun.<br /><br />It was a pretty awesome invention in my opinion. Crack heads can be pretty nifty, at least the ones that were actually okay to chill and feel safe with, but not too many of those.
