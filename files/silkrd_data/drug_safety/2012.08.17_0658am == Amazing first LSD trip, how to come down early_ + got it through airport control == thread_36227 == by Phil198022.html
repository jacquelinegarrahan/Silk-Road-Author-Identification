				So I had my first LSD experience last week, first with 2 150 µg blotters, then a second one with 3 150 µg blotters. I really, really loved the ride, and I may have found a new drug of choice to replace all the other stuff I have tried before. A really strong and positive experience, no bad come down to speak off at all. Like if you take amphetamine-type stimulants or mdma you feel down and mentally drained for days afterwards, nothing of the kind with LSD, much nicer than alcohol too, the whole experience is both entertaining and feels therapeutic too, if you want to think about your problems etc., but you can also just sit back, listen to music and enjoy the ride or watch a movie. <br /><br />Anyway, what I want to ask is: One disadvantage I see is that the trip lasts many, many hours, there may be situations where you have to come back to reality earlier, is there any medication to basically cut short a trip effectively, let&#039;s say if the trip goes badly, or if you need to meet somebody etc.? Don&#039;t know if benzos are the answer here?<br /><br />As an alternative: Are there drugs with pretty much the same effects as LSD but with a shorter duration of effects?<br /><br />A second thing I found interesting: I took the blotters along on my vacation and got through airport controls without any problems. They were vacuum sealed, like I received them in the mail, then I rolled up the plastic wrapping until it was about the size of a thimble, stuffed it in a condom, tied up the condom and stuck it in my rectum. I know that&#039;s not very appetizing, but basically I don&#039;t see any way how airport control could find any drugs you transport that way: You can&#039;t smell them, you can&#039;t feel them if they touch you, and a scanner can&#039;t see them either, after you arrive just eat some dulcolax or something similar and take a dump.

				They say http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroquel stops it, but antipsychotic medications are really really shit. They hardly have any recreational value whatsoever. Bascially they rip out all of the serotonin and dopamine out of your brain making you like a freakin&#039; zombie. No feelings can&#039;t be happy etc. So personally they do nothing for me lsd or otherwise.<br />Benzos are noted to clam down LSD trips but still its not an off switch, its just turning down the volume.<br />What you are after are silent antagonists of the 5-HT2A receptor, that is the LSD trip switch in the brain, if you get LSD into that receptor you start tripping balls. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor#Silent_antagonists <br />As you can see anti psychotics are there, but i would really stay away from them. My favorite personally to stop a trip is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine <br />It is an Anti-depressant and a silent antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, also about 30 -60 mins after taking it, it feels like you haven&#039;t sleep in 2 weeks, and its really easy to sleep. And you can have some really lucid dreams on it.<br />Also because its an Anti-depressant it tops up your happy chemicals serotonin and adrenergic so you will feel better the next day.<br />And because of my love of benzos, It acts as a anxiolytic so helps with my social anxiety, bascially it feels like you have taken a klonopin for the whole next day, you are so relaxed nothing can make you angry, able to go outside interact with people despite them being so horrible, bascially acts like benzos the next day.

				I&#039;d go with benzos, as far as I understand they should dampen the whole experience and probably let you sleep. Not tried yet, hope I won&#039;t ever have to.<br /><br />Can&#039;t you plan ahead to have enough free time afterwards. I&#039;d never want to end it early. I know it can get tiring towards the end, but I just love the afterglow. Such a great feeling, I wouldn&#039;t want to ruin that unless there&#039;s no other way.

				I personally just focus on recovering full functionality whilst retaining non-impairing effects during the comedown, and for as long as I can after.

				1. Was it really LSD? LSD is powerful and it always brings some tragic feelings to the trip.<br /><br />2. Blotters in rectum? Really? You can always hide them within the papers or book. I did that few times, worked smoothly.

				Valium (diazepam) is the go-to choice for aborting an LSD trip. That&#039;s not to say you won&#039;t feel under the influence of the stuff, but it mostly eliminates any accompanying anxiety/ worry and can perhaps curtail the duration a bit.<br /><br />In fact, IV diazepam is what is used in hospital settings to treat patients having a bad trip. DO NOT ever IV diazepam tablets, though -- there&#039;s no way to leech out the binders and, to my knowledge, valium isn&#039;t water soluble. Ss unless you have an IV ready solution, just pop a couple valium and wait.

				Diazepam and many other Benzos work great&nbsp; for aborting&nbsp; LSD trips. Its very helpful for people who are freaking out on acid.<br />Cocaine works great too, it stops the visual side of the trip.

				By the way, why don&#039;t you try 25i-NBOMe? For me it&#039;s the same as LSD, but has shorter effect (around 7 hours from 1000mg).
