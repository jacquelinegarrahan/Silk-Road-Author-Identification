Our information is they knew what they were buying.&quot;<br /><br />Tracking down the dealer and source of the deadly batch of the drug commonly called acid will be a key focus of the police investigation.<br /><br />It follows a number of recent incidents on the coast and Sydney in which people have been hospitalised after taking so-called &quot;bad&quot; drugs.<br /><br />Insp Trayhurn said detectives would rely on intelligence of the local drug supply networks, the other boy&#039;s statements and &quot;some members of the public that have provided information&quot; to apprehend the dealer.<br /><br />Nick had breathing problems and heart complications as a result of the drug but it will be another five weeks before toxicology results are known.<br /><br />Gosford High students were shocked by Nick&#039;s death with many of them learning about it during assembly.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/warning-to-students-of-pill-danger-after-the-lsd-death-of-teenager-nick-mitchell/story-e6frg6n6-1226531614617

				&quot;LSD, if that&#039;s what it was, is an insidious drug. It&#039;s got a smiley face on it and looks harmless, but it kills,&quot;<br /><br />wat o_o<br /><br />This kind of blind and terrified ignorance of &quot;dem illegal drugs&quot; pisses me off like nothing else can. For the majority of civvies, LSD and the likes are some evil entity demon death drugs, that creep up on unsuspecting users, slaughtering the addicts by the thousands.<br /><br />Also, what the fuck were 15 year olds doing with stupidly potent hallucinogens? First time I tripped, I spent DAYS reading up on my chosen compound beforehand.

				Well, it is the was LSD can kill you. <br /><br />Taking the drug will not result directly in death at all, but if you get a physchotic episode that involves wanting to hug a train, you&#039;ll be just as dead.<br /><br />These things do happen though, and also with legal drugs. I remember a case where a tourist thought he had contracted malaria on holiday in africa, and decided the best course of action would be to take a rather large dose of anti-malarial drugs (lariam). This in turn caused a psychotic episode ending up with the poor fellow running around and eventually onto an intersection where he was ran over by a bus. <br /><br />It happens with legal substances too though: people drink too much, stumble across a road and get hit by traffic, eventually resulting in death. If that happens, its mostly marked as an &#039;unfortunate accident&#039;, while the exact same scenario involving illicit drug use is usually explained as &#039;death due to narcotics abuse&#039;. No matter how unfortunate these things are, i cannot see a proper reason to view them differently. <br /><br />

				This thread is quite poignant. I think that people do die all the time from drugs.<br />It is not the fault of the drug dealer or pusher.<br />It is the fault of the drug user for trying to get high and being a weak-o who wud probz die off ne think.

				This sort of thing really pisses me off. Some asshole takes some research chemical and puts it on blotter and calls it LSD with no regard to the results.<br /><br />&quot;Nick&#039;s 11-year-old brother found him unconscious in his granny flat bedroom&quot;, no way that was LSD. He would be wide awake on real acid not unconscious.<br /><br />There is a special hell for people like that. A special hell.

				im just speculating but when i read the story i wondered if it was a reaction to 25i-NBOME and the police/family/friends thought it was lsd because they might have found/seen the familiar blotters which are commonly associated with lsd
