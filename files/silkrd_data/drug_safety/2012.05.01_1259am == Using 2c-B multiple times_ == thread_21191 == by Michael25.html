				Is it safe to use 2c-b couple days in a row or is it better to wait a week or multiple weeks each time? I mean if it doesn&#039;t release serotonin or dopamine then why can&#039;t use it couple days in a row? Anyway, I used a little last night and used a little tonight but didn&#039;t get a good rush like I normally do. So I&#039;m thinking maybe you have to wait between taking? Also, if you know that you need to wait between taking why do you need to wait? What chemical in your body needs to replenish? Hard to find good accurate info and looking for it. Thanks.<br />

				Most psychedelics (2C-B included) are 5-HT2 (serotonin) receptor agonists (most are 5-HT2A agonists, 2C-B is a 5-HT2C agonist).<br />This means they stimulate the receptors, and the body tries to bring serotonin activity back to baseline level by making the receptors less sensitive - a process known as downregulation. So if you take another dose while your receptors are downregulated you&#039;ll feel less effects because they&#039;re less sensitive. Once the chemical that caused the receptors to downregulate is out of your body they slowly get back to normal sensitivity. This process takes time - around 1 or 2 weeks depending on the chemical and its affinity for the receptor (more affinity -&gt; more bond receptors -&gt; more downregulation -&gt; more tolerance). There&#039;s nothing to replenish - you just have to wait for your receptors to get back to baseline. It&#039;ll take about a week for 2C-B.<br />I suppose that an inverse antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptor (like an antipsychotic such as Zyprexa) may lower the tolerance, but I&#039;m not sure.

Downregulation is a reversible process (but it can take some time, depending on how much the receptor is downregulated).
