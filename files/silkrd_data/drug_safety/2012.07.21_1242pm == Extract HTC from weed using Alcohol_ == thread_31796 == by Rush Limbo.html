				I was told that I can extract the oils with HTC from weed using alcohol (using something that&#039;s 150 or more proof). I was told that i can dump half or an ounce of crushed weed into the bottle, shake it couple times a day and let it sit in it for a week or so. Eventually the alcohol will separate the HTC oils from the plant material, and the HTC oils will gather up top, and will be very potent. Then I can put a drop on a cigarette and get high like this.<br /><br />Has anyone tried this method? Does it work? Is there a lot of wasted weed in the process? Should I even bother?<br /><br />Thanks Gang!

				For best results with Alcohol extractions, go the QWISO route.&nbsp; The &quot;QW&quot; part means &quot;quick wash&quot;, which means that you don&#039;t leave your material soaking for any real length of time.&nbsp; THC dissolves very quickly in isopropyl, and the longer you leave the material in, the more other stuff dissolves in with it (chlorophyll, plant waxes etc.).&nbsp; <br /><br />You can always do a second, longer run with the material afterwards, but the first extraction will give the best quality and the majority of the yield.<br /><br />Plenty of stuff about this on youtube etc.

				Don&#039;t just read something on the internet and do it.&nbsp; It is important that you UNDERSTAND what you are doing.&nbsp; There are some fire hazards along the way, depending on the guides you follow, and they may ask you to do something that isn&#039;t safe.&nbsp; Ever month or so I run across an article of some kid that blew up his apartment or has 3rd degree burns on his face due to keeping a flammable substance near an open flame.
