				I keep reading that every experienced tripper has a stash of benzos in case anything goes wrong. First of all, does the benzo always make things better or could things get worse? Second, which would be the best benzo to keep at hand in said stash? thank you :)

				I myself prefer Thorazine (I believe davidd offers this, but for opiate potentiation instead. Still good at killing trips) though most benzo&#039;s have been known to kill trips or dull them down significantly.<br /><br />I have also read that large doses of Vitamin C can kill an acid trip. Never tried it myself, never had a bad acid trip :D.

				It doesn&#039;t kill the trip at all. It doesn&#039;t do anything like that. If anything, it will enhance the visual effects that you&#039;re getting. The difference will be that you won&#039;t be freaked out by any of them at all; whereas you may have been nervous about that spider about to eat you, the anti-anxiety benzo will make you totally okay with everything going on around you.

Take some xanax. From everything I have heard, It wont kill it for you, but it WILL make it a much more enjoyable experience. As stated by the highly intelligent gentleman in the above quote.

				I find that taking benzos dulls it a bit. It&#039;s nice to have them around, but I prefer not using them.<br />Tbh if you&#039;re having a bad time you&#039;re better off thinking about why and solving it mentally, it seems you &#039;learn&#039; this way - if you can&#039;t do this then benz away

				i concur about xanax.&nbsp; doesn&#039;t kill the trip, just makes you more content with whats happening.&nbsp; if you&#039;re freaking out about something it will soon make you feel like everything&#039;s all right.

				Xanax saved me one time because I took some sketchy acid and I was peaking for the longest time. Long story short, I freaked out and thought I took something else. I would personally only use it if you&#039;re REALLY having a bad time though.

				I once dosed 2mg Clonazepam when I decided to Candyflip, I couldn&#039;t remember anything the next day so I wouldn&#039;t recommend it but I&#039;m sure I had fun. I always keep a stash of benzos for coming down though, I usually get horrible come downs with bad insomnia, benzos are now a must have for me, awesome tool to invest in!

				My preference is diazepam just cause its easily available to me, has helped me out in some difficult times. Any of the short lasting anxiolytic benzos would work well. I occasionally get anxiety or feel overwhelmed by its intensity, in many ways that&#039;s part of the rollercoaster of tripping for me. I would also never describe any of my many trips as being &#039;bad&#039;. Some have been very scary and intense but I&#039;ve got more out of those trips than others. Its a bit like sky diving, it can be scary but that can be fun. ;D<br /><br />Taking them does have its down sides for me, trips definitely feel less intense and significant. It reduces my memory of the experience and has also caused me to make some poor decisions while tripping, similar to alcohol does. Also, it isn&#039;t an instantaneous fix for anxiety, it will take minimum 20-30 mins before it kicks in and that can feel like an age while tripping. One main risk I can see is it could be easy to OD forgetting you had taken it or thinking they weren&#039;t working so take more and end up passed out for the rest of the trip, so be careful if you do keep them around while tripping.<br /><br />I agree its good to find ways of dealing with anxiety or &#039;bad trips&#039; without resorting to benzos. Sometimes just changing the setting can help, move to another room, go outside, change the lighting / music, put on a movie, find something to occupy yourself with. Any anxiety usually passes quite quickly so try not to reach for the benzos unless you really feel you have to, you will get more out of it.<br /><br />Happy tripping. :)
